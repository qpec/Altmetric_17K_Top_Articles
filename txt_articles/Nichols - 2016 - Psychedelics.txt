Abstract——Psychedelics
(serotonergic
hallucino-
gens) are powerful psychoactive substances that alter
perception and mood and affect numerous cognitive
processes. They are generally considered physiologi-
cally safe and do not lead to dependence or addiction.
Their origin predates written history, and they were
employed by early cultures in many sociocultural and
ritual contexts. After the virtually contemporaneous
discovery of (5R,8R)-(+)-lysergic acid-N,N-diethylamide
(LSD)-25 and the identification of serotonin in the
brain, early research focused intensively on the
possibility that LSD and other psychedelics had a
serotonergic basis for their action. Today there is a
consensus that psychedelics are agonists or partial
agonists at brain serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A
receptors, with particular importance on those expressed
on apical dendrites of neocortical pyramidal cells in layer
V. Several useful rodent models have been developed over
the years to help unravel the neurochemical correlates of
serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor activation in
the brain, and a variety of imaging techniques have
been employed to identify key brain areas that are
directly affected by psychedelics. Recent and exciting
developments in the field have occurred in clinical
research, where several double-blind placebo-controlled
phase 2 studies of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in
patients with cancer-related psychosocial distress have
demonstrated unprecedented positive relief of anxiety
and depression. Two small pilot studies of psilocybin-
assisted psychotherapy also have shown positive benefit
in treating both alcohol and nicotine addiction. Recently,
blood oxygen level–dependent functional magnetic
resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography have
been employed for in vivo brain imaging in humans
after administration of a psychedelic, and results
indicate that intravenously administered psilocybin
and LSD produce decreases in oscillatory power in
areas of the brain’s default mode network.
I. Introduction
I was delighted when the editors invited me to write a
review on “psychedelics,” perhaps a watershed moment,
representing a shift in opinion that has been developing
for more than 3 decades with respect to research and
understanding of psychedelics. When I began my
graduate studies in 1969, it was politically correct in
scientific circles to refer to these substances only as
psychotomimetics, a negative term suggesting that they
fostered a mental state resembling psychosis (Hoffer,
1967). Later, as it was realized that these compounds
did not provide very realistic models of psychosis or
mental illness, it became more correct to refer to them
as hallucinogens, again a pejorative term suggesting
that they principally produce hallucinations. Yet that is
not what they do in most users at ordinary doses, so this
term likewise is not particularly descriptive or useful,
although it is still widely used and seems to remain the
preferred name for these substances in most scientific
writing. In addition, the term hallucinogen is often used
as a rather broad category to include all kinds of
psychoactive molecules, including cannabinoids, “ec-
stasy,” dissociative agents, and others.
This review will focus exclusively on the so-called
classic serotonergic hallucinogens (psychedelics), which
are substances that exert their effects primarily by an
agonist (or partial agonist) action on brain serotonin
5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 2A receptors, as discussed
later. The discussion will not consider cannabinoids,
dissociatives such as ketamine, salvinorin A (a specific
opioid k agonist), or entactogens such as 3,4-methyl-
enedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). In certain con-
texts, all of these and some related agents have been
swept into the catchall category “hallucinogens.” Al-
though they all can produce profound changes in
consciousness, they have a different mechanism of
action and will not be discussed unless there is a
specific reason to do so.
The name psychedelics for these substances was
coined by Humphrey Osmond in 1957, connoting that
they have a mind-manifesting capability, revealing
useful or beneficial properties of the mind (Osmond,
1957). This name has been popular among the lay public
for more than 5 decades, but it has generally been
frowned upon by the scientific community because it
implies that these substances have useful properties.
The notion that psychedelics can have beneficial effects
has thus far not been embraced in most medical or
scientific circles; indeed, federal funding agencies (e.g.,
the National Institutes of Health National Institute
266
Nichols
 on Drug Abuse and the National Institute of Mental
Health) have no mission to support research on poten-
tially useful properties of psychedelics. Yet this term
has remained popular with the public and even appears
to be gaining popularity. As I intend to show in this
discussion, however, the idea that psychedelics may
have useful properties is not at all farfetched, and very
recent clinical studies have reinforced the belief by
many that psychedelics are well worth studying from a
number of different perspectives. Indeed, one of the
most striking developments in this field has been the
initiation and successful completion of a variety of
clinical studies of psychedelics in the past 15 years,
most of which have been targeted to specific medical
indications. As will be discussed later, the results have
been, in the main, remarkably positive.
It should be kept in mind that the relative dearth of
research on psychedelics in the past half century did not
result from a lack of scientific interest, but rather
occurred as a consequence of political forces that
manifested principally in the United States in the
1960s and 1970s (Grinspoon and Bakalar, 1979). Use
of (5R,8R)-(+)-lysergic acid-N,N-diethylamide (LSD) and
marijuana by so-called hippies who demonstrated
against the Vietnam War during the 1960s created
great consternation among authorities and legislative
bodies, both at the federal and state levels. Antiwar
attitudes and rejection of conventional social norms by
adolescents and college students were often perceived
by the mainstream culture to be a consequence of drug
use; hence, these substances were often believed to be
“perverting” the minds of our youth. Furthermore, the
outspoken Harvard University professor and firebrand
Timothy Leary encouraged young people to “turn on, tune
in, and drop out,” essentially coaching them to take drugs,
discover their true selves, and abandon convention. Such
messages did not play well with the mainstream culture, all
while the mass media fanned the flames of public hysteria
with greatly exaggerated reports of drug-induced insanity,
chromosomal damage, attempts to fly, and so forth.
Strict laws were quickly passed. After the passage of
the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, LSD and other
psychedelics known at the time were placed into the
most restrictive category of drugs, Schedule 1. This
classification made them virtually impossible to study
clinically and effectively ended any significant research
into the pharmacology and medical value of psyche-
delics for more than 3 decades. Nevertheless, there can
be no doubt that psychedelics played a substantial role
in defining the youth culture of the 1960s and 1970s,
with books and essays too numerous to cite being
written on this topic. It is believed that more than 30
million people have used LSD, psilocybin, or mescaline
(Krebs and Johansen, 2013). One suspects that had LSD
never been discovered, the world might look very
different today than it does now, for better or worse,
depending on one’s perspective.
Despite the recreational use of psychedelics, a quote
from a book by Grinspoon and Bakalar (1979 Pg 192)
needs to be kept in mind:
Many people remember vaguely that LSD and other psyche-
delic drugs were once used experimentally in psychiatry, but
few realize how much and how long they were used. This was
not a quickly rejected and forgotten fad. Between 1950 and the
mid-1960s there were more than a thousand clinical papers
discussing 40,000 patients, several dozen books, and six in-
ternational conferences on psychedelic drug therapy. It aroused
the interest of many psychiatrists who were in no sense cultural
rebels or especially radical in their attitudes.
One very important scientific consequence of the
discovery of LSD also is often overlooked. The powerful
psychologic effect of LSD was accidently discovered in
1943 (Hofmann, 1979a), followed only a decade later in
1953 by the detection of serotonin in the mammalian
brain (Twarog and Page, 1953). The presence of the
tryptamine moiety within LSD was also quickly seen to
be the scaffold for the chemical structure of serotonin
(Fig. 1).
This recognition led to a proposal only 1 year later by
Woolley and Shaw (1954) that “mental disturbances
caused by lysergic acid diethylamide were to be attrib-
uted to an interference with the action of serotonin
in the brain.” Therefore, one could reasonably argue
that the whole field of serotonin neuroscience, and
especially the role of serotonin in brain function, was
catalyzed by the discovery of LSD! By way of illustra-
tion, in 1952, there were only 10 publications in the
National Library of Medicine concerning serotonin,
nearly all of them dealing with some aspect of its ability
to constrict blood vessels. Only 8 years later, in 1960,
there were 300 publications on serotonin, 35 of which
were now focused on studies of serotonin in the brain.
For comparison, in 1960, there were only 197 publica-
tions about norepinephrine (NE)/noradrenaline, a
neurotransmitter that had been discovered and stud-
ied in the mid-1940s. Green (2008) provides an in-
teresting overview of the 1950–1970 period of intense
research activity after the discovery of serotonin in the
brain.
There have been numerous recent reviews on this
topic, usually titled as hallucinogens, and the reader is
encouraged to consult these works for further details

Halberstadt, 2014; Tyl�
s et al., 2014). I wrote a com-
prehensive review on the subject in 2004, so the
literature considered for this review will focus pri-
marily, but not exclusively, on the years from 2004
to the present.
A. Historical Use
Psychedelics are a class of drug that cannot be fully
understood without reference to a number of other fields
of research, including anthropology, ethnopharmacol-
ogy, psychiatry, psychology, sociology, and others. This
review will focus mostly on pharmacology, both pre-
clinical and clinical, but on occasion reference will be
made to aspects of some of those other areas.
Psychedelics may be the oldest class of psychophar-
macological agents known to man. Important examples
of these substances include a substance used in ancient
India known as Soma, which was highly revered and is
frequently mentioned in the Rigveda, with numerous
Vedic hymns written in praise of Soma (Wasson and
Ingalls, 1971). In the ancient village of Eleusis, outside
Athens, for more than 2000 years there was an annual
all-night secret ceremony that is believed to have
involved ingestion of a hallucinogenic brew known as
kck«on (Wasson et al., 1978). We know almost nothing
about the ceremony other than that profound insights
about life could be achieved, and it was apparently a
treasured once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for any Greek
citizen who had not been convicted of murder.
Psilocybin mushrooms were used by the Aztec sha-
man in healing and in a variety of religious and
divinatory rituals. These mushrooms were known as
teonanacatl, meaning “god’s flesh” (Ott and Bigwood,
1978; Schultes and Hofmann, 1979). The use of various
psychoactive plant materials and substances was com-
mon in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican societies, includ-
ing the Olmec, Zapotec, Maya, and Aztec cultures
(Carod-Artal, 2015). In the Bradshaw rock art in the
Kimberly region of Australia and in the Sandawe rock
art in the Kolo region of Eastern Tanzania, one finds
uniquely shared images such as the “mushroom head”
symbol of psilocybin use, suggesting that the two
cultures were linked and had shamanic practices that
used psychoactive mushrooms (Pettigrew, 2011).
Peyote (Lophophora williamsii) is a small cactus
native to the American Southwest and Northern Mexico
that has been used for millennia and is consumed as a
sacrament during services of the Native American
Church. Two peyote samples from a cave on the Rio
Grande River in Texas were analyzed and subjected to
radiocarbon dating. The average age of the samples,
both of which contained mescaline, dated to 3780–3660
BCE (El-Seedi et al., 2005). This evidence supports the
use of peyote by Native North Americans as long ago as
5700 years (Bruhn et al., 2002). Classic psychedelics
that have been extensively studied include LSD, shown
earlier, mescaline, psilocybin, and N,N-dimethyltrypta-
mine (DMT) (Fig. 2).
Ayahuasca, also known as yagé or hoasca, has a long
history of use by natives in the Amazon valley of South
America (Dobkin de Rios, 1971; Schultes and Hofmann,
1979). Ayahuasca is a decoction prepared from an
admixture of two plants: the pounded bark from
Banisteriopsis caapi vines and leaves from Psychotria
viridis. The latter contains the hallucinogen DMT, a
Schedule 1 controlled substance under U.S. law, and it
is generally considered that the psychoactive effects of
ayahuasca can be attributed to its DMT content.
Although DMT is not orally active, B. caapi contains
b-carboline alkaloids that inhibit the liver monoamine
oxidase (MAO) that normally breaks down DMT; thus,
ayahuasca is taken orally as a “tea.” Its use has been
incorporated as a sacrament into the religious practices
of two syncretic Brazilian churches [União do Vegetal
(UDV) and the Santo Daime] that have branches in the
United States, with the U.S. Supreme Court rendering
a 2006 decision to allow the use of ayahuasca by the
UDV under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
B. What Are Psychedelics?
In view of the widespread historical use of psyche-
delics as sacraments in a variety of other cultures,
Jaffe’s (1990) definition for the class of psychedelics can
perhaps be appreciated: “…the feature that distin-
guishes the psychedelic agents from other classes of
Fig. 2. Chemical structures of classic psychadelics mescaline, psilocybin, and DMT.
268
Nichols
 drug is their capacity reliably to induce states of altered
perception, thought, and feeling that are not experi-
enced otherwise except in dreams or at times of re-
ligious exaltation.” All pharmacologists will recognize
that this definition for a class of psychoactive drugs is
indeed quite unique!
One of the pioneers of LSD research, the late Daniel
X. Freedman, noted that “…one basic dimension of
behavior… compellingly revealed in LSD states is
‘portentousness’— the capacity of the mind to see more
than it can tell, to experience more than it can explicate,
to believe in and be impressed with more than it can
rationally justify, to experience boundlessness and
‘boundaryless’ events, from the banal to the profound”
(Freedman, 1968). Freedman’s observation is com-
pletely consistent with Jaffe’s definition.
The use of psychedelics as a central feature of many
religious practices, as well as the profound and unique
psychopharmacological effects suggested by Jaffe’s def-
inition and the observations of Freedman, surely makes
us aware that psychedelics are an exceptional category
of mind-altering substances. Indeed, this knowledge
prompted Ruck et al. (1979) to coin the word entheogen
as a replacement for the terms hallucinogen and
psychedelic, both of which they felt had negative
connotations. Entheogen is derived from the Greek
roots entheos, meaning “God (theos) within,” and gen-
esthe, meaning “to generate.” The word entheogen thus
essentially refers to a substance or material that
generates God or the divine within someone. Although
the term entheogen is now seeing fairly wide acceptance
within the culture of those who use these substances
“recreationally,” a search of the term in the National
Library of Medicine finds only five hits. Although it
seems unlikely that the term entheogen will be adopted
within the formal scientific community, the reader
should realize that in some circles entheogen is gener-
ally synonymous with psychedelic. Nonetheless, it
should be appreciated that the effects produced by
psychedelics are highly dependent on the set (mental
expectation) of the user and the setting (environment).
A set and setting designed to facilitate a mystical
experience will increase the probability of such an
occurrence, whereas an unstructured or party-type
setting is less likely to lead to a positive outcome.
Studerus et al. (2012) investigated the importance of
24 predictor variables on the acute response to psilocy-
bin and confirmed that nonpharmacological factors play
an important role in the effects of psilocybin. Variables
examined included age, sex, education, personality
traits, drug pre-experience, mental state before drug
intake, experimental setting, and drug dose. Their
analysis was based on pooled data from 23 controlled
experimental studies involving 261 healthy volunteers
who had participated in 409 psilocybin administrations
over a 19-year period in the authors’ laboratory. Multi-
ple linear mixed-effects models were fitted for each of 15
response variables. Drug dose was shown to be the most
important predictor for all measured response vari-
ables, but several nonpharmacological variables signif-
icantly contributed to the effects of psilocybin.
Specifically, having a high score in the personality trait
of absorption, being in an emotionally excitable and
active state immediately before drug intake, and having
experienced few psychologic problems in past weeks
were most strongly associated with pleasant and
mystical-type experiences. High emotional excitability,
young age, and an experimental setting involving
positron emission tomography (PET) most strongly
predicted unpleasant and/or anxious reactions to psilo-
cybin. Interestingly, in addition to confirming that
nonpharmacological variables play an important role
in the effects of psilocybin, an experimental setting
involving PET most strongly predicted unpleasant and/
or anxious reactions to psilocybin.
Two instruments have been most widely used to
assess the subjective effects of hallucinogenic drugs.
The first of these, the Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS)
was developed by Strassman et al. (1994) during their
studies of the intravenous administration of DMT. The
HRS was first drafted based on interviews with 19
experienced DMT users and was modified during the
early stages of their study. The final version, used for
their double-blind study, contained 126 individual
items. HRS items were placed into six conceptually
coherent clusters: somaesthesia (interoceptive, visceral,
and
cutaneous/tactile
effects),
affect
(emotional/
affective responses), perception (visual, auditory, gus-
tatory, and olfactory experiences), cognition (alteration
in thought processes or content), volition (a change in
capacity to interact willfully with themselves, the
environment, or certain aspects of the experience),
and intensity (strength of the various aspects of the
experience). Subjects were asked to recall their experi-
ences from the immediately preceding session. Most
questions were scored on a 0–4 scale (0, not at all; 1,
slightly; 2, moderately; 3, quite a bit; and 4, extremely).
The second assessment instrument widely used to
quantify the subjective effects of hallucinogens is the
Abnormal Mental States (APZ) questionnaire, first
developed by Dittrich (1994, 1998) to measure altered
states of consciousness (ASCs). In a series of 11
experiments using different induction methods in 393
healthy subjects, the hypothesis was tested that ASCs
have major dimensions in common, irrespective of their
mode of induction. The original version contained 158
items covering a range of phenomena potentially occur-
ring during an ASC. The common denominator of ASCs
was described by three primary oblique dimensions,
designated as “oceanic boundlessness” (OSE, later as
OBN), “dread of ego dissolution” (AIA, and later as
DED), and “visionary restructuralization” (VUS, later
as VRS). The APZ questionnaire became the interna-
tional validated standard for the assessment of ASCs
Psychedelics
269
 and the name was further revised to the OAV scales
(Bodmer et al., 1994) and later to the five-dimensional
altered states of consciousness (5D-ASC) (Dittrich et al.,
2006). Details of the development of the original APZ
questionnaire and its further refinements were sum-
marized by Studerus et al. (2010). To overcome a variety
of methodological limitations, Studerus et al. (2010)
carried out a psychometric evaluation of the OAV and
5D-ASC in a relatively large sample from 43 pooled
experimental studies of healthy subjects who had re-
ceived psilocybin, ketamine, or MDMA. The total
sample was composed of 591 drug sessions. After
comprehensive and detailed statistical analyses, the
authors found that the original OAV scales were
multidimensional constructs, and arrived at an im-
proved final model that had 11 factors: experience of
unity, spiritual experience, blissful state, insightful-
ness, disembodiment, impaired control and cognition,
anxiety, complex imagery, elementary imagery, audio-
visual synesthesia, and changed meaning of percepts.
Correlations between the 11 factors and their associa-
tion with the original OAV scales were presented. The
new lower-order scales were proposed to be better
suited to assess drug-induced ASCs.
Mechanistically, psychedelics have agonist or partial
agonist activity at brain serotonin 5-HT2A receptors.
This molecular characterization will be elaborated in
some detail later in this review, and aspects of the
anatomic and functional importance of this receptor
type will also be extensively explored. Discussions over
the years with many colleagues working in the phar-
maceutical industry have informed me that if upon
screening a potential new drug is found to have
serotonin 5-HT2A agonist activity, it nearly always
signals the end to any further development of that
molecule.
A recent study by Turton et al. (2014) reported on the
subjective experience of intravenous psilocybin admin-
istered during a functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) examination. Fifteen volunteers were adminis-
tered an intravenous infusion of either placebo or 2 mg
psilocybin and were blinded as to whether they would
receive placebo or drug for a particular experiment.
Drug infusion began 6 minutes after the start of a scan
in a magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Subjects
completed a visual analog scale rating the intensity of
the drug experience at the start of the scan and prior to
drug infusion, 5 minutes postinfusion, and 12 minutes
postinfusion. All subjects subsequently were inter-
viewed about the drug effects, and interviews were
analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analy-
sis, a qualitative method. All subjects reported that the
onset of drug effect was very rapid and intense, with a
duration of effect lasting 10–15 minutes. The investi-
gators identified nine broad categories of phenome-
nology. Altered somatosensory, visual, auditory, and
proprioceptive sensations were reported, with 14 of 15
subjects describing perceptual changes as the primary
effect of the drug. Thirteen subjects reported changes in
perception of time, either speeding up or slowing down.
The report describes a variety of effects on cognition,
mood, memory, and spiritual or mystical experiences.
Overall, subjects found the experience difficult to de-
scribe, yet most found it pleasant and positive.
In a new study by Schmid et al. (2015), LSD (200 mg)
was administered orally to 16 healthy subjects in a
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover
study. LSD produced a pronounced alteration in waking
consciousness that lasted for 12 hours and included
visual hallucinations, audio-visual synesthesia, and
positively experienced derealization and depersonaliza-
tion phenomena. Compared with placebo, LSD in-
creased subjective well-being, happiness, closeness to
others, openness, and trust. Increases in blood pressure,
heart rate, body temperature, pupil size, plasma corti-
sol, prolactin, oxytocin, and epinephrine also were
measured. On the 5D-ASC scale, LSD produced higher
scores than did psilocybin or DMT. The authors also
described subjective effects on mood that were similar to
those reported for MDMA that might be useful in
psychotherapy. No severe acute adverse effects were
observed and the effects subsided completely within
72 hours.
In a very recent study by Carhart-Harris et al.
(2015a), LSD was shown to enhance responsiveness to
suggestion. Their study was prompted by very early
reports indicating that LSD increased suggestibility
(Sjobergand Hollister, 1965; Middlefell, 1967). Thus,
Carhart-Harris et al. (2015a) administered LSD (40–80
mg, i.v.) to 10 healthy volunteers in a within-subject
placebo-controlled design. Suggestibility and cued men-
tal imagery were assessed using the Creative Imagi-
nation Scale and a mental imagery test. The two
instruments were administered between 110 and 140
minutes after drug infusion, at the peak of the drug
effect. Subjects scored significantly higher on the Cre-
ative Imagination Scale, but not the mental imagery
test after LSD administration, compared with placebo.
The magnitude of suggestibility enhancement was
positively correlated with the subject’s baseline trait
conscientiousness. This enhanced suggestibility may
have implications for the use of LSD as an adjunct to
psychotherapy, but it also indicates that individuals
with a high trait conscientiousness are particularly
sensitive to the suggestibility-enhancement effect of
LSD.
It has been axiomatic among users of psychedelics
that music takes on an intensified and more enjoyable
quality under the effects of LSD or other psychedelics,
yet no modern placebo-controlled study had ever been
carried out to confirm that widely held belief. Early
studies at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center
found that music was a very effective stimulus and
complement to the effect of LSD (Bonny and Pahnke,
270
Nichols
 1972). Gaston and Eagle (1970) also reported that the
presence of music was much preferable to its absence in
alcoholic patients undergoing treatment using LSD
therapy, both by patient preference and treatment
results. Numerous other studies had been reported on
the value of music in the context of various shamanic
and therapeutic approaches (see references in Kaelen
et al., 2015). Very recently, therefore, Kaelen et al.
(2015) tested the hypothesis that the emotional re-
sponse to music is enhanced by LSD. Ten participants
were administered placebo or various doses of LSD,
including 40, 50, 70, or 80 mg, infused intravenously
over 3 minutes. They then listened to five different
instrumental music tracks on each of two study days: a
placebo day followed by an LSD day, separated by 5–7
days. Music tracks were chosen that produced the
highest liking and lowest familiarity by a separate
sample of nine participants. The question “How emo-
tionally affected were you by the music?” was asked
immediately after each track and served as the study’s
primary outcome. The nine-category Geneva Emotional
Music Scale (Zentner et al., 2008) was also used. Mean
scores for all music stimuli in response to the question
“how emotionally affected were you by the music?” were
significantly higher for the LSD condition than for
placebo. In addition, all nine factors on the Geneva
Emotional Music Scale were scored higher after LSD
administration than after placebo. Emotions related to
transcendence also were enhanced by LSD. Specific
emotions showing the strongest enhancement included
wonder, transcendence, tenderness, and power. Fur-
thermore, there was a significant positive relationship
between ratings of the intensity of the LSD effect and
emotional arousal to music. The results of Zentner et al.
(2008) support the hypothesis that LSD enhances
music-evoked emotion.
C. Psychedelics Can Engender Ecstatic States with
Persistent Positive Personality Change
The experimental study of mystical or ecstatic states
engendered by psychedelics perhaps began with the so-
called “Good Friday experiment,” carried out at Boston
University’s Marsh Chapel in 1962 by Walter Pahnke as
his research for the Ph.D. in religion and society at the
Harvard Divinity School. Pahnke (1963) examined the
similarities and differences between experiences de-
scribed by mystics and those induced by psilocybin. On
Good Friday in 1962, 20 Christian theological student
volunteers attended a 2.5-hour religious service in
Boston University’s Marsh Chapel. The setting and
preparation of the subjects was designed to optimize a
spiritual or mystical experience. In a double-blind pro-
cedure, subjects were given either an oral dose of 30 mg
psilocybin, or a 200-mg placebo dose of nicotinic acid,
administered in identical capsules. Based on responses
to a variety of instruments and questionnaires, subjects
who received psilocybin had experiences that were
indistinguishable from those experienced by mystics.
The experiences were powerful and personally mean-
ingful. Doblin (1991) reported a follow-up to the Pahnke
study in 1989 and was able to locate and interview 19 of
the original 20 experimental participants. All of the
psilocybin subjects felt that the experience had signif-
icantly affected their lives in a positive way and they
expressed appreciation for having participated in the
experiment.
An extension of the Good Friday experiment was
recently carried out by Griffiths et al. (2006). The
investigators
used
rigorous
double-blind
clinical
methods to evaluate acute and longer-term effects of
psilocybin (30 mg/70 kg) compared with an active
comparator compound (40 mg/70 kg methylphenidate).
A complex design was used to obscure which treatments
were administered from the study participants and the
monitors, and the study was designed to minimize
adverse effects. Thirty-six healthy volunteers were
enrolled, all of whom indicated some participation in
regular religious or spiritual activities. Instruments
used to assess effects 7 hours after drug administration
were the HRS, the Addiction Research Center Inven-
tory, the States of Consciousness questionnaire, and the
Mysticism Scale. Seven to 8 weeks after each session,
and before any additional session, subjects completed
the Persisting Effects Questionnaire, the Mysticism
Scale–Lifetime, the Spiritual Transcendence Scale,
the NEO Personality Inventory, and the Positive and
Negative Affect Schedule Expanded Form. Based on
measures of mystical experience, 22 of the 36 volunteers
had a complete mystical experience after psilocybin
administration, whereas only 4 did after the methyl-
phenidate (placebo) sessions. Based on ratings of per-
sonal meaningfulness and spiritual experience, 67% of
the volunteers rated the psilocybin experience to be
either the single most meaningful experience of their
lives or among the top five most meaningful experiences
in their lives. Based on community observer ratings,
psilocybin sessions were associated with signifi-
cant positive changes in the volunteer’s behavior and
attitudes.
Thus, when psilocybin was administered under struc-
tured conditions to well prepared volunteers, it occa-
sioned experiences that had marked similarities to classic
mystical experiences, imparting to the participants sub-
stantial personal meaning and spiritual significance. The
investigators point out that the high value some subjects
placed on the psilocybin experience may in part explain
the long-term historical use of psychedelics within some
cultures for divinatory or religious purposes. Griffiths
et al. (2006) conclude with the statement that, “The
ability to prospectively occasion mystical experiences
should permit rigorous scientific investigations about
their causes and consequences.”
Griffiths et al. (2008) subsequently conducted a
14-month follow-up of the subjects from their earlier
Psychedelics
271
 study. Subjects were asked to identify in which session
they experienced the “most pronounced changes in your
ordinary mental process.” It was found that the 14-
month retrospective follow-up ratings for the psilocybin
session did not differ significantly from the immediate
postsession ratings. Compared with methylpheni-
date, the psilocybin experience produced significant
increases in ratings of positive attitudes, mood, social
effects, and behavior at 14 months of follow-up. At the
14-month follow-up, 58% of the 36 volunteers still rated
the psilocybin experience as among the five most
personally meaningful experiences of their lives and
67% rated it as among the five most spiritually signif-
icant experiences of their lives.
A second study using a similar protocol with 18
volunteers examined dose effects of psilocybin, using
0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 mg/70 kg (Griffiths et al., 2011). The
percentage of subjects who met the criteria for having a
complete mystical-type experience increased with dose.
Overall, 72.2% of volunteers had complete mystical
experiences at either or both doses of 20 and 30 mg/70
kg. Positive ratings about life, attitudes about self,
mood, social effects, and behavior also increased as a
function of dose. Ratings at the 14-month follow-up
were undiminished compared with ratings at 1 month
after the sessions.
MacLean et al. (2011) analyzed the data from the two
double-blind controlled studies of psilocybin reported by
Griffiths et al. (2006, 2011). In particular, their goal was
to use the NEO Personality Inventory to analyze
possible personality changes that might have occurred
after the high-dose psilocybin sessions in those studies.
It is generally believed that personality traits are
relatively enduring and that an individual’s personality
is predominantly stable across the lifespan. Yet evi-
dence also exists that significant life events may
dramatically change adult personality (see references
in MacLean et al., 2011). The most widely accepted
model of personality structure is the five-factor model,
which describes five broad domains of personality:
neuroticism, extroversion, openness, agreeableness,
and conscientiousness (see references in MacLean
et al., 2011). The authors suggest that numerous sub-
jective claims of long-term changes after hallucinogen
use appear to align with the personality trait of
“openness,” which encompasses aesthetic appreciation
and sensitivity, imagination and fantasy, and broad-
minded tolerance of others’ viewpoints and values.
Thus, they hypothesize that the mystical experiences
reported in the studies by Griffiths et al. might lead to
enduring increases in openness. Analysis of personality
was assessed 1 to 2 months after a high-dose psilocybin
session and again 16 months later to determine the
persistence of any personality change(s). Consis-
tent with their hypothesis, a mystical experience after
psilocybin administration was significantly correlated
with increases in openness. No such effect was seen
after methylphenidate treatment. In addition, there
were no significant changes in any of the other four
personality factors after psilocybin administration. At
the 16-month follow-up, openness levels still remained
significantly elevated. The authors note that “This is
the first study to demonstrate changes in personality in
healthy adults after an experimentally manipulated
discrete event.”
Studerus et al. (2011) pooled raw data from eight
double-blind placebo-controlled experimental psilocy-
bin studies conducted between 1999 and 2008. The data
were analyzed for acute, short- and long-term subjective
effects of psilocybin in 110 healthy human subjects
who had received between one and four doses of 45–315
mg/kg psilocybin. Studerus et al. (2011) reported that
nearly 40% of the participants in their laboratory
studies of psilocybin claimed positive long-term changes
in aesthetic experience and in their relationship with
the environment (i.e., nature) after their psilocybin
sessions. At 8–16 months after psilocybin sessions,
more than 60% of subjects rated the experience as “very
enriching,” and more than 90% described it as enriching
to at least a medium degree. These effects occurred
despite the fact that no attempt was made in their
experiments to optimize conditions for a spiritual or
mystical experience, which contrasts with the setting
and preparations used in the two Griffiths studies cited
above.
Bouso et al. (2012) compared 127 regular ayahuasca
users with 115 actively religious controls who did not
use ayahuasca. Baseline measurements were taken of
general psychologic well-being, mental health, and
cognition and the groups were then compared 1 year
later to determine whether regular ayahuasca use had
an effect on these measurements. Regular ayahuasca
users showed lower scores on all psychopathology scales
as assessed by the Symptom Checklist 90–Revised, as
well as on measures of harm avoidance and self-
directedness. Participants scored higher on a measure
of psychosocial well-being and performed better on the
Stroop test (an indicator of resistance to emotional
interference) and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (a
measure of working memory). No evidence of psycho-
logic maladjustment, mental health deterioration, or
cognitive impairment was found in the ayahuasca-using
group.
Lerner and Lyvers (2006) compared users of psyche-
delic drugs with users of nonpsychedelic drugs and
nonillicit drug–using social drinkers. Samples were
drawn from Israel and Australia. Compared with the
other two groups, psychedelic drug users scored signif-
icantly higher on mystical beliefs (e.g., oneness with
God and the universe), life values of spirituality, and
concern for others, and scored lower on the value of
financial prosperity, irrespective of culture of origin.
Lyvers and Meester (2012) carried out a website
survey of 337 adults who used a variety of drugs,
272
Nichols
 including psychedelics. Only about 25% reported “spir-
itual” motives for using psychedelics, yet use of high
doses of LSD and psilocybin was significantly correlated
in a dose-related manner with scores on two well known
indices of mystical experiences; use of MDMA, cannabis,
cocaine, opiates, or alcohol was not. Thus, even when
taken recreationally, psychedelics have the potential to
induce mystical experiences.
Quite interestingly, the underlying neuronal basis for
mystical/spiritual experiences has recently been the
subject of scientific investigation. Kometer et al. (2015)
studied the neuronal basis of spiritual experiences
and insightfulness after administration of psilocybin to
human subjects. They conducted a double-blind,
placebo-controlled study and administered psilocybin
(170 or 215 mg/kg, p.o.) to 50 healthy human volunteers.
Electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded
from 64 scalp electrodes. Exact low-resolution brain
electromagnetic tomography was applied to compute
the three-dimensional intracerebral current density
values of the scalp-recorded EEG rhythms. They used
lagged phase synchronization, a new measure that
can capture nonlinear neuronal relationships to as-
sess dynamic functional connectivity (Pascual-Marqui
et al., 2011).
The 11-dimension 5D-ASC questionnaire was used to
quantify the subjective psychologic effects of psilocybin,
with a particular interest in the spiritual experience
subscale, and the related subscales of experience of
unity, comprising experience of oneness with the envi-
ronment and the self, insightfulness, measuring pro-
found insights into life and existence, blissful state,
measuring experiences of pleasure, inner peace, and
love. Voxel-wise product-moment correlations between
current source density in the psilocybin condition and
the 11-dimension 5D-ASC subscale scores were com-
puted by regression analysis.
Psilocybin significantly increased scores of all sub-
scales on the 5D-ASC but significantly decreased cur-
rent source density of oscillations in all frequency bands
up to 20 Hz (eyes-closed condition) or up to 30 Hz (eyes-
open condition). There was a significant and consistent
psilocybin-induced reduction of current source density
across low frequency bands (,20 Hz) in the posterior
cingulate cortex (PCC) and the retrosplenial cortex
(RSC). Psilocybin decreased the current source density
of neuronal 1.5- to 2.0-Hz oscillations within a neural
network comprising the PCC, anterior cingulate cortex
(ACC), and parahippocampal regions. The intensity of
psilocybin-induced spiritual experience and insightful-
ness correlated with the lagged phase synchronization
of 1.5-to 2.0-Hz d oscillations between the RSC, para-
hippocampus, and lateral orbitofrontal area.
The extent of lagged phase synchronization within a
network of deep cortical structures strongly and posi-
tively correlated with score on the insightfulness sub-
scale of the 5D-ASC and spiritual experiences subscales
of the 5D-ASC during the eyes-closed condition. Lagged
phase synchronization of 1.5- to 4-Hz d oscillations
within a network comprising the RSC, parahippocam-
pus, and lateral orbitofrontal area was associated with
spiritual experiences and insightfulness.
These findings of Kometer et al. (2015) provide
further evidence that decreased ongoing oscillations
below 20 Hz, particularly u/a oscillations, may be a
common mechanism of action of psychedelics. The
decrease in lower frequency oscillations was found to be
localized within an extended network that included the
PCC, RSC, ACC, and parahippocampal regions, a
network that strongly overlaps with the default mode
network (DMN). Thus, psilocybin may modulate default
mode functions by decreasing ongoing lower frequency
oscillations within this network.
Lower frequency oscillations, particularly in the a
range, mediate rhythmic cortical inhibition of neuronal
ensembles (see references in Kometer et al., 2015). The
marked decrease in lower frequency oscillations ob-
served in this study may indicate that psilocybin
induces a shift of the resting excitation/inhibition
balance toward excitation, which would be expected to
disrupt the ordinary temporal structure of neuronal
processes within the extended DMN.
Lagged phase synchronization was strongly associ-
ated with the psilocybin-induced state of consciousness,
supporting the view that neural integration, rather
than activity, underlies the state of consciousness.
Scores of the spiritual experiences subscale of the 5D-
ASC questionnaire were also associated with increased
lagged phase synchronization of d oscillations between
parahippocampal regions and the RSC. Kometer et al.,
(2015) speculate that the neuronal network processes
they identified may constitute a crucial pathway that
can be modulated by serotonergic receptors to regulate
mental health, a conclusion that would be consistent
with some of the potential positive mental health
outcomes discussed earlier in this section.
II. Safety of Psychedelics
For decades, the media have largely portrayed psy-
chedelics as extremely dangerous drugs; in fact, the
classic serotoninergic psychedelics are generally con-
sidered very physiologically safe, certainly compared
with opiates and psychostimulants. Jaffe (1985) stated,
“In man, deaths attributable to direct effects of LSD are
unknown,” and this statement remains true even today.
Nonetheless, despite the relative physiologic safety
of psychedelics, they can lead to serious psychologic
consequences. In addition, as will be discussed later,
some of the newer highly potent synthetic phenethyl-
amine hallucinogens have proven to be unexpectedly
toxic. This section will detail studies indicating that
psychedelics can be safely used under supervision, and
that few documented serious adverse effects occur even
Psychedelics
273
 after recreational use. The discussion will then turn to
some generally recognized adverse reactions, followed
by case reports of some more serious and even fatal
reactions to psychedelics. It should be emphasized
that these latter fatalities, which are rare, have
occurred after use of newer synthetic phenethylamine
compounds, and not as a result of ingestion of LSD,
psilocybin, mescaline, or DMT.
Analysis of early published reports on adverse reac-
tions and long-term negative sequelae induced by classic
psychedelics failed to identify significant adverse events;
if long-term adverse effects from repeated use did occur,
they were subtle or nonsignificant (Strassman, 1984;
Halpern and Pope, 1999). Their reviews were based on
reports from supervised clinical studies using pure drugs,
so the same conclusions might not apply to recreational
use of drugs with unknown identities or purity.
These substances do not lead to addiction or depen-
dence and are not considered to be reinforcing (O’Brien,
2001). This is understandable when one realizes that the
serotonergic hallucinogens do not have direct effects on
brain dopaminergic systems, a pharmacology that ap-
pears essential for nearly all drugs that can engender
dependence. Attempts to train animals to self-administer
hallucinogens, an animal model that can predict abuse
liability, have generally been unsuccessful.
Using 2001–2004 data drawn from the National
Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), Krebs and
Johansen (2013) recently evaluated possible associa-
tions between lifetime use of psychedelics and current
mental health in the U.S. adult population. In a large
sample of respondents, 13.4% reported lifetime psyche-
delic use. No significant associations were found be-
tween lifetime use of any psychedelic or past-year use of
LSD and increased rate of any mental health outcome.
Surprisingly, in several cases, use of psychedelics was
associated with a lower mental health problem rate.
A statewide survey of the adult population in Colo-
rado sought to determine whether psychedelic use was
correlated with the lifetime risk of panic attacks (Bonn-
Miller et al., 2007). No association was found between
psychedelic use and panic attacks, but psychedelic
abuse and dependence were significantly related to an
increased lifetime risk of panic attacks. It should be
noted that in this study, however, phencyclidine (PCP)
was included in their survey as a psychedelic, and this
substance, in contrast with the classic serotonergic
psychedelics, can cause dependence.
Peyote (L. williamsii) is a small cactus that grows in
the Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico.
It contains the psychedelic compound mescaline and
has been used for centuries by Native American pop-
ulations in rituals and ceremonies. Mescaline is also
found in the San Pedro and Peruvian Torch cacti, and
these have also been used ceremonially. Although
peyote is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance,
members of the Native American Church have a legal
exemption to use it in their religious services. Halpern
et al. (2005) compared 61 Navajo Native American
Church members who regularly ingested peyote with
79 individuals reporting minimal use of peyote, alcohol,
or other substances. Cognitive function was assessed
using the Rand Mental Health Inventory and 10
standard neuropsychological tests of memory and
attentional/executive functions. The peyote-using group
showed no significant deficits on the Rand Mental
Health Inventory or on any of the 10 other tests used.
For the peyote-using group, total lifetime peyote
exposure was not associated with neuropsychological
performance.
By contrast, recreational use of peyote has led to
adverse events, although peyote exposures reported to
poison control centers are relatively rare compared with
other drugs of abuse. In 2007, for example, only 116
peyote or mescaline exposures were reported to U.S.
poison control centers out of more than 2.4 million total
drug exposures (Bronstein et al., 2008). Carstairs and
Cantrell (2010) retrospectively reviewed the California
Poison Control System electronic database between
the years 1997 and 2008 for reports of cases involving
adverse reactions to peyote or mescaline ingestion when
it was the sole intoxicating agent. A total of 31 cases
were identified that met their inclusion criteria. Life-
threatening symptoms did not occur, and most expo-
sures were associated with only mild to moderate
clinical effects, which most commonly included tachy-
cardia and central nervous system (CNS) effects. Symp-
toms typically resolved within 24 hours or less and did
not usually require anything more than supportive
measures or sedation. One case of a prolonged peyote-
induced psychosis was reported by Lu et al. (2004), in
which the psychosis resolved after sleep. The case
involved a 54-year-old Native American man with no
prior history of psychosis. He drank peyote juice during
a healing ceremony and within a few hours became
convinced that he was hunted by animal spirits. He was
unable to sleep for 2 weeks, at which time he developed
visual and auditory hallucinations of the spirits and
became increasingly depressed. He was persuaded to
enter a hospital, where he received trazodone to help
him sleep. He fell asleep and slept for 15 hours, which
led to complete resolution of his psychotic symptoms.
The authors speculated that his psychosis was a result
of his prolonged sleep deprivation.
Hasler et al. (2004) studied eight subjects given either
placebo or 45, 115, 215, or 315 mg/kg psilocybin (a very
low, low medium, or high dose, respectively). Instru-
ments used to assess psilocybin effects included the
5D-ASC, the Frankfurt Attention Inventory (FAIR),
and the Adjective Mood Rating Scale (AMRS). Several
physiologic and plasma hormones were also measured.
Psilocybin dose-dependently increased all measures on
the 5D-ASC. The medium and high doses of psilocybin
led to a 50% reduction in performance on the FAIR test.
274
Nichols
 The only scores that were increased on the AMRS were
“general
inactivation,”
“emotional
excitability,”
and
“dreaminess.” Hasler et al. (2004) found no evidence that
psilocybin is hazardous with respect to somatic health.
Bouso et al. (2015) used magnetic resonance imaging
to examine potential differences in cortical thickness in
22 Spanish regular users of ayahuasca, compared with
22 matched controls. Inclusion criterion for ayahuasca
users was that they had used it at least 50 times in the 2
previous years. Subjects also were assessed using three
neuropsychological tests, including the two-back test to
assess working memory, the Wisconsin Card Sorting
Test to assess executive function, and a switching task
to assess set shifting. Personality was also assessed by
self-report using the Spanish version of the Tempera-
ment and Character Inventory–Revised questionnaire.
Ayahuasca users scored significantly better than con-
trols on several variables derived from the neuropsy-
chological tests. No increased psychopathology or worse
neuropsychological performance was observed in the
ayahuasca group, consistent with findings reported
earlier by Grob et al. (1996) for ayahuasca users who
were members of the Brazilian church, the UDV.
Indeed, ayahuasca users scored significantly better
than controls on “harm avoidance,” and its subscale
“anticipatory worry,” and significantly higher on “self-
transcendence.” Cortical thinning was found for six
brain areas in the ayahuasca group: the middle frontal
gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus, the precuneus, the
superior frontal gyrus, and the PCC. By contrast,
cortical thickening was seen in the precentral gyrus
and the ACC. Correlation analysis revealed that life-
time use of ayahuasca was inversely correlated to
cortical thickness in the PCC.
A. General Issues of Safety and Mental Health in
Psychedelic Users
Although there is a general public perception that
psychedelic drugs are dangerous, from a physiologic
standpoint they are in fact one of the safest known classes
of CNS drugs. They do not cause addiction, and no
overdose deaths have occurred after ingestion of typical
doses of LSD, psilocybin, or mescaline. Cohen (1967) and
Jaffe (1985) have both stated that death due to direct LSD
toxicity is unknown. Indeed, recreational users who have
consumed massive doses of LSD have survived. For
example, eight individuals who believed they had cocaine
accidentally insufflated an extremely high dose of LSD.
Their plasma LSD levels were reported as between 1000
and 7000 mg/100 ml (recall that a typical total oral dose of
LSD might be 100–200 mg). These individuals all became
comatose, with hyperthermia, vomiting, light gastric
bleeding, and respiratory problems. With hospital treat-
ment, however, all eight survived and without apparent
residual effects (Klock et al., 1974).
Although the classic psychedelics have not been
directly responsible for causing death, the judgment of
users is certainly impaired while under the influence of
these drugs. This is a particular concern when halluci-
nogens are used in unsupervised settings. Users may
believe that they are invincible or possess superpowers
and may do things they would not normally consider,
such as believing they can fly (Reynolds and Jindrich,
1985), jumping from buildings (Keeler and Reifler,
1967), or incurring severe ocular damage by prolonged
staring at the sun (Schatz and Mendelblatt, 1973;
Fuller, 1976).
Studerus et al. (2010) analyzed acute, short-, and
long-term subjective effects of psilocybin in healthy
humans. Again, using pooled raw data from eight
double-blind placebo-controlled experimental studies
conducted between 1999 and 2008, their analysis in-
cluded 110 healthy subjects who had received between
one and four oral doses of psilocybin (45–315 mg/kg
body weight). Psilocybin dose-dependently induced pro-
found changes in mood, perception, thought, and self-
experience, but most subjects described the experience
as pleasurable, enriching, and nonthreatening. Acute
adverse reactions were characterized by strong dyspho-
ria and/or anxiety/panic, but occurred only at the two
highest doses of psilocybin in a relatively small number
of subjects. All acute adverse drug reactions were
successfully managed through interpersonal support
and did not require psychopharmacological interven-
tion. Follow-up questionnaires indicated no subsequent
drug abuse, persisting perception disorders, prolonged
psychosis, or other long-term impairment of functioning
in any of the subjects. The results indicate that the
administration of modest psilocybin doses to healthy,
high-functioning, and well prepared subjects in the
context of a carefully monitored research environment
carries an acceptable level of risk.
The recent resurgence of interest in the clinical uses
of psychedelics led Johnson et al. (2008) to propose
appropriate procedures for using them in clinical prac-
tice. The guidelines they outline have certain parallels
with ritual uses of hallucinogens by older indigenous
cultures. In particular, Johnson et al. (2008) cite the
need for structured use (expressed as ritual in indige-
nous use) and restrictions on use, including the need for
guidance and appreciation of the powerful psychologic
effects of hallucinogens (expressed as reverence in
indigenous use). Psychedelic administration in hu-
mans results in a unique profile of effects and poten-
tial adverse reactions that need to be appropriately
addressed to maximize safety. The primary safety
concerns with psychedelics are largely psychologic rather
than physiologic in nature. Somatic effects vary but are
relatively insignificant, even at doses that elicit powerful
psychologic effects. The proposed guidelines extend and
complement the recommendations of Fischman and
Johanson (1998) for high-dose hallucinogen research.
The guidelines include 1) the presence of two “moni-
tors” with some medical knowledge, knowledge of
Psychedelics
275
 ASCs, and a degree of clinical sensitivity; 2) a physical
environment that is safe, aesthetically pleasing, and
comfortable; 3) careful subject preparation, including
several meetings to establish rapport and trust with the
monitors; 4) a detailed consent form and explanations of
the study procedures, detailed discussions about the
range of potential experiences, and time of onset and
duration of the effects; and 5) an available physician in
the event of an untoward medical reaction. Anyone
contemplating carrying out a clinical research program
with a psychedelic is strongly encouraged to read the
detailed guidelines presented by Johnson et al. (2008).
Krebs and Johansen (2013) evaluated any association
between lifetime use of psychedelics and current mental
health in the adult population. Data were analyzed for
2001–2004 for 130,152 randomly selected NSDUH
respondents; 21,967 respondents (13.4% weighted) re-
ported lifetime psychedelic use. The authors found no
significant association between lifetime use of any
psychedelic and increased rate of any mental health
outcomes. Indeed, they discovered that psychedelic use
was associated with a lower rate of mental health
problems in several cases. Johansen and Krebs (2015)
subsequently analyzed a new data set of 135,095
randomly selected U.S. adults that included 19,299
users of psychedelics. Data were from the NSDUH for
2008–2011. As in their earlier study, the authors found
no significant associations between lifetime use of
psychedelics and increased likelihood of past-year
serious psychologic distress, mental health treatment,
depression, anxiety, or suicidal thoughts, plans, or
attempts. Johansen and Krebs (2015) failed to find any
evidence that use of psychedelics is an independent risk
factor for mental health problems. Indeed, they report
that lifetime use of psychedelics was associated with
decreased inpatient psychiatric treatment.
Hendricks et al. (2014) analyzed data from 2002–2007
for 25,622 individuals charged with a felony in the
Southeastern United States and under community
corrections supervision in the Treatment Accountabil-
ity for Safer Communities program, which is a case
management intervention program for individuals with
a history of substance involvement. The authors exam-
ined relationships between any hallucinogen use dis-
order (versus no hallucinogen use disorder) and all
available sociodemographic and psychosocial variables.
They report that any hallucinogen use disorder was
associated with a decreased probability of supervision
failure. They note the contrast with any cannabis,
cocaine, alcohol, opiate, or amphetamine use disorder,
each of which was associated with an increased proba-
bility of supervision failure. Their results suggest that
hallucinogens may promote alcohol and other drug
abstinence and prosocial behavior in a population with
high rates of recidivism.
In a more recent report by Hendricks et al. (2015), the
authors evaluated any relationship between use of a
classic psychedelic and psychologic distress and suici-
dality among more than 190,000 U.S. respondents
pooled from the NSDUH for 2008–2012. Lifetime use
of a psychedelic was associated with significantly re-
duced odds of past-month psychologic distress, past-
year suicidal thinking, past-year suicidal planning, or
past-year suicide attempt. By contrast, lifetime use of
other illicit drugs was associated with an increased
likelihood of these outcomes. The authors suggest that
classic psychedelics may hold promise in the prevention
of suicide. These findings are consistent with the
surveys of Krebs and Johansen (2013) and Johansen
and Krebs (2015); in all three studies, the authors
suggest that their data are not compatible with the
highly restricted legal status of psychedelics and that
more extensive clinical research is warranted.
B. Adverse Reactions
Use of high doses of psychedelics can lead to vascular
problems because the 5-HT2A receptor is associated
with vascular smooth muscle contraction, platelet ag-
gregation, thrombus formation, and coronary artery
spasms (Nagatomo et al., 2004). Acute vasoconstriction
caused by serotonin is usually shared by activation of
5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptors; however, in intracranial
arteries, only the 5-HT1B receptor mediates constriction
(Kaumann and Levy, 2006). Both 5-HT2A and 5-HT1B
receptors can mediate coronary artery spasm. 5-HT2A
receptors also constrict the portal venous system, in-
cluding esophageal collaterals in cirrhosis. Data from
studies by Ootsuka et al. (2004) suggest that spinal
5-HT2A receptors contribute to sympathetically induced
cutaneous vasoconstriction regulated by the raphe/
parapyramidal neurons in the brainstem.
Balíková (2005) reports a fatal and nonfatal overdose
after ingestion of the psychedelic phenethylamine 2,5-
dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine (DOB) by two male
individuals. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
was used to detect the presence of DOB in both gastric
and urine samples of the two men. Although one subject
survived, the other suffered convulsions and metabolic
acidosis and died 6 days after admission.
Psilocybin, when administered in a controlled set-
ting, has frequently been reported to cause transient,
delayed headache, with incidence, duration, and sever-
ity increased in a dose-related manner (Johnson et al.,
2012). Bickel et al. (2005) reported the case of a 25-year-
old hepatitis C–infected man, who presented with
severe rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure after
Psilocybe mushroom ingestion. He later developed
encephalopathy with cortical blindness. Respiratory
and cardiovascular support, mechanical ventilation,
continuous venovenous hemodialysis, and corticoste-
roid treatment led to improvement and the patient
recovered completely over several months.
Psilocin was identified in the urine of a subject who
was investigated
for driving under the influence
276
Nichols
 (Tiscione and Miller, 2006). The subject apparently did
not exhibit any response to the crash of his automobile,
seemingly unaware of the severity of his situation or
immediate surroundings.
Although very rare, there have been reports of
rhabdomyolysis after ingestion of LSD (Berrens et al.,
2010). A newer tryptamine, 5-methoxy-N,N-diisopro-
pyltryptamine (“foxy”) also produced rhabdomyolysis
and transient acute renal failure in an otherwise
healthy 23-year-old man (Alatrash et al., 2006).
Although many ergot alkaloids are known to produce
vasospasm, especially after chronic use, LSD has rarely
been associated with this adverse effect. Nevertheless,
Raval et al. (2008) reported on a 19-year-old woman who
experienced severe lower-extremity ischemia related to
a single use of LSD 3 days prior to presentation. After
intra-arterial nitroglycerin and verapamil failed, bal-
loon percutaneous transluminal angioplasty therapy
led to rapid clinical improvement in lower-extremity
perfusion. As of the date of the report, the patient had
not required a major amputation.
Sunness (2004) described a 15-year-old female pa-
tient with a 2-year history of afterimages and photo-
phobia after a history of drug use that included LSD,
marijuana, and other illicit drugs. She had discontinued
LSD 1 year prior to examination. Although the author
connected her visual problems with her prior LSD use,
it is not at all clear from the report that her LSD use was
the cause of her visual problem.
Bernhard and Ulrich (2009) reported a case of cortical
blindness in a 15-year-old girl. She had headache and
nausea 5 days after taking LSD and suddenly developed
complete blindness in both eyes. The blindness per-
sisted for 48 hours. Over the next 3 months, the subject
had three more episodes of complete blindness that
lasted 12–36 hours, with no visual disturbances be-
tween episodes. The authors suggested that the tempo-
rary blindness might be a correlate of “flashbacks”
caused by LSD.
Toxicity also has been noted for several of the so-
called designer drugs. For example, Jovel et al. (2014)
reported the case of a healthy young male individual
who ingested 5-methoxy-N,N-diallytryptamine, one of
the emerging new tryptamine-type research chemicals.
The patient was admitted with extreme agitation,
tachycardia, diaphoresis, and combativeness that re-
quired physical restraint and intravenous sedation, but
the patient did recover.
Andreasen et al. (2009) reported a fatality involv-
ing the potent synthetic psychedelic phenethylamine
compound 1-(8-bromobenzo[1,2-b; 4,5-b9]difuran-4-yl)-
2-aminopropane, known commonly as Bromo-Dragonfly.
An 18-year-old woman was found dead after ingesting 1
ml of a “hallucinogenic liquid.” She and her boyfriend
had ingested it between 10 and 11 PM on the previous
evening and then they both fell asleep. On awakening
at 5 AM the next morning, the woman’s boyfriend
discovered that she was dead. Autopsy findings 3 days
after her death included edema of the lungs, slight
edema of the brain, spleen enlargement, irritation of the
mucous membrane in the stomach, and ischemic
changes in the kidneys. Her femoral blood concentra-
tion of the drug was 4.7 mg/kg. The bottle containing the
hallucinogenic liquid was recovered and analyzed by
ultraperformance liquid chromatography time-of-flight
mass spectrometry, high-performance liquid chroma-
tography diode array detection, 1H nuclear magnetic
resonance, and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance and
found to contain a solution of almost pure Bromo-
Dragonfly. Based on the solution concentration and
the amount of solution consumed, it was estimated that
she had ingested approximately 700 mg. Although that
would seem to be a relatively small dose, no other drugs
were discovered in her system, including the absence of
ethanol.
It is often difficult to establish whether the drug is
pure or has been coingested with other unknown
drugs of unknown purity. For example, Ovaska et al.
(2008) reported a case of “sympathomimetic toxicity”
in a patient who was reported to have ingested 2,5-
dimethoxy-4-chloroamphetamine (DOC), yet toxico-
logical screening showed the patient had ingested
both DOC and MDMA.
Data for 2005 to 2006 from the Texas Poison Con-
trol Centers were reviewed for mushroom exposures
(Barbee et al., 2009). There were a total of 742
exposures, which were all acute and intentional. Of
those, 59 individuals were admitted to a hospital, with
17 requiring admission to a critical care unit. Nonethe-
less, only 10 of the admissions that were identified
involved psilocybin. Of all of the admissions, major toxic
reactions were uncommon, with no deaths reported.
C. Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder
One adverse effect of hallucinogen use, particularly
associated with LSD use, is hallucinogen persisting
perception disorder (HPPD). This term has displaced an
earlier somewhat more nonspecific one known as “flash-
backs,” which was a re-experiencing of one or more of
the perceptual effects induced by a hallucinogen at some
later time, after the acute drug effects had worn off.
HPPD is composed of afterimages, perception of move-
ment in peripheral visual fields, blurring of small
patterns, halo effects, and macro- and micropsia long
after the drug has been used.
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders,
4th
Edition
(DSM-IV),
Text
Revision
lists the following three criteria for HPPD: A) re-
experiencing, after the use of a hallucinogen, of one or
more of the perceptual symptoms that were experienced
while intoxicated with the hallucinogen; B) the symp-
toms in criterion A cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other impor-
tant areas of functioning; and C) the symptoms are not
Psychedelics
277
 due to a general medical condition and are not better
accounted for by another mental disorder.
Halpern and Pope (2003) noted that when LSD was
used in a therapeutic or research setting, HPPD
appeared less frequently than when LSD was used
recreationally. The authors concluded, however, that
some individuals, especially users of LSD, can experi-
ence a long-lasting HPPD syndrome with symptoms
of “persistent perceptual abnormalities reminiscent
of acute intoxication.” Nevertheless, the incidence of
HPPD is very small given the many tens of millions of
persons who have taken LSD, most often in a recrea-
tional setting. Litjens et al. (2014) provided a recent
comprehensive review on the subject of HPPD. The
actual incidence of HPPD is not known and depends on
the prevalence of use in different countries, but epide-
miologic information is scarce.
Hermle et al. (2008) reviewed MEDLINE data for 1997–
2007, searching for reports of hallucinogen-induced psy-
chosis, flashbacks, and HPPD. The authors reported that
adolescent intoxication with psychedelic drugs rarely
produced acute psychotic syndromes, further stating that
“The clinical relevance of flashback phenomena as a post-
hallucinogenic psychiatric disorder has to be disputed.”
Although LSD was most widely used and therefore
has led to the greatest number of HPPD cases, it is clear
that other hallucinogens also can evoke the syndrome.
For example, Espiard et al. (2005) reported HPPD in an
18-year-old man after mixed intoxication with psilocy-
bin and cannabis. The symptoms persisted for more
than 8 months. Ikeda et al. (2005) reported flashbacks
after use of 5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine
(5-MeO-DIPT) by a 35-year-old man without a previous
psychiatric history. He had used the substance six or
seven times over 5 months but discontinued it after he
had a bad trip, with anxiety, palpitations, auditory
oversensitiveness, and visual distortions. Treatment
with oral risperidone ameliorated his symptoms. An-
other case study described a 33-year-old woman who
developed HPPD after LSD use for a year. Although
treatment with antidepressants and risperidone did not
ameliorate her symptoms, treatment with the antisei-
zure drug lamotrigine almost completely abolished her
visual disturbances (Hermle et al., 2012).
D. N-(2-methoxybenzyl)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-substituted
phenethylamines (NBOMe) Compounds
Although the classic serotonergic hallucinogens are
not recognized to be particularly toxic, a new class of
substituted phenethylamines with toxic properties has
recently become very popular as recreational drugs
(Nikolaou et al., 2014). Unfortunately, there are now
several reports of hospitalizations and fatalities attrib-
uted to these compounds (Poklis et al., 2013, 2014; Rose
et al., 2013; Nikolaou et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2014;
Walterscheid et al., 2014), but it is not clear whether
deaths resulted from ingestion of lethal amounts of pure
bulk drug or whether the drug has some inherent toxicity
that is not normally associated with other psychedelics.
Suzuki et al. (2015) provided a comprehensive litera-
ture review of toxicities associated with NBOMe inges-
tion. The most common adverse reactions were agitation
(including aggressiveness), tachycardia, and hyperten-
sion, with seizures reported in 40% of the patients. In the
20 individual cases they reviewed, 3 (15%) were fatalities.
The most potent of these new recreational chemicals
are shown in Fig. 3, with potency increasing going from
X = H to X = I.
For purposes of law enforcement the iodo compound
(X = I; 25I-NBOMe) is presently considered by the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration to be an analog of
2C-I [2-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxy)aminoethane], which is
currently a Schedule 1 controlled substance. The pro-
cedure to classify 25I-NBOMe as a Schedule 1 sub-
stance has been initiated and it has been placed
temporarily into Schedule 1 (Drug Enforcement Admin-
istration, 2013). Global interest in these compounds and
closely related analogs has attracted increasing inter-
est. For example, the European Monitoring Centre for
Drugs and Drug Addiction has received a range of
notifications from European Union member states
about analytically confirmed nonfatal and fatal intoxi-
cations associated with 25I-NBOMe. This was followed
by a risk assessment conducted by the European Mon-
itoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction Scientific
Committee to assess health and social risks associated
with the iodo analog (European Monitoring Centre for
Drugs and Drug Addiction, 2014). In addition, the
World Health Organization’s Expert Committee on
Drug Dependence reviewed the status of a range of
new substances for its 36th meeting in June 2014,
which included 25I-NBOMe and its 4-bromo and
4-chloro analogs (World Health Organization, 2014).
In the mouse head-twitch assay, 25I-NBOMe and a
related analog were extremely potent in inducing this
behavior, which was blocked by preadministration of
the selective 5-HT2A antagonist M100907 [(R)-(+)-a-
(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethyl]-4-
pipidinemethanol] (Halberstadt and Geyer, 2014). As
discussed in the section on mouse models later in this
Fig. 3. NBOMe compounds.

 review, the mouse head twitch has shown a high
correlation with human psychedelic activity.
A relatively large series of 48 NBOMe-type com-
pounds has been evaluated for affinity and function at
5-HT2 family receptors (Hansen et al., 2014). Their work
was directed toward development of potential radio-
ligands for in vivo PET imaging of 5-HT2A receptors that
would be selective over 5-HT2C receptors. One com-
pound was discovered that had approximately 100-fold
selectivity for both affinity and function at the 5-HT2A
versus 5-HT2C receptor. Their high affinity and relative
selectivity for the 5-HT2A receptor has made some of
these compounds useful as agonist ligands for in vivo
PET imaging (Ettrup et al., 2010; Finnema et al., 2014).
Curiously, the NBOMe-type compounds do not ap-
pear to be orally active and are typically administered
bucally, or by nasal insufflation. Their potency is so high
that they are often distributed on blotter papers and
marketed as being LSD. Users place the blotters
against their gums to effect absorption. One hypothesis
put forward to explain the lack of oral activity for
these highly active compounds is a significant first-
pass metabolic effect (Leth-Petersen et al., 2014). In
that study, the microsomal stability of 11 phenethyl-
amines and their N-benzylated congeners was studied
using human liver microsomes. It was found that the N-
benzylated compounds had a much higher intrinsic
clearance than did the simple phenethylamines, and
the authors hypothesized that their low hepatic stabil-
ity was the reason for their lack of oral activity.
Stellpflug et al. (2014) reported a clinical case of a
nonfatal overdose with 25I-NBOMe. They identified a
major metabolite of the compound in the urine that had
a concentration 80-fold higher than the parent drug.
The subject’s urine was treated with b-glucuronidase
and then analyzed using ultraperformance liquid chro-
matography electrospray ionization plus tandem mass
spectrometry to identify a major metabolite with a mass
that was one methyl group lower than the parent
compound. Comparison of the full fragmentation pat-
tern was then assessed and concluded to be an O-
demethylated metabolite at the 2- or 5-position of the
trisubstituted ring, but the investigators were not able
to determine which position had been metabolized.
They detected two other very minor metabolites that
also appeared to be O-demethylated. The concentration
of the unmetabolized parent 25I-NBOMe in the urine
was 7.5 ng/ml, whereas the desmethyl metabolite was
600 ng/ml. This metabolite and the two other minor
metabolites were not present in the urine in the absence
of prior enzymatic treatment, indicating that they were
all glucuronidated.
Most recently, Leth-Petersen et al. (2015) identified
the basis for the high first-pass effect of NBOMe
compounds and the likely basis for their inactivity after
oral administration. Using in vivo studies in pigs, they
determined that the 5-methoxy of the trisubstituted
phenylringisrapidlyO-demethylated.Afterintravenousad-
ministration of 25B-NBOMe [N-(2-[11C]methoxybenzyl)-2,
5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine (Cimbi-36)] to
a pig, analysis revealed that plasma levels of the
parent drug rapidly declined, with a new metabolite
rapidly appearing and accumulating in plasma. At
the 30-minute mark, there was more than twice as
much of this metabolite present in plasma as there
was of the parent compound. This metabolite
was definitively identified as the 5-O-glucuronide
using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and
chemical synthesis. Evidently, the highly hydropho-
bic nature of the N-benzyl phenethylamines readily
targets them to the mixed function oxidases in
the endoplasmic reticulum, where they are effi-
ciently 5-O-demethylated and then very quickly
glucuronidated.
III. Mechanism of Action
Stanislov Grof characterized LSD as a powerful
“nonspecific amplifier of the unconscious” (Grof, 1975).
This empirical observation was based on his personal
supervision of more than a thousand clinical adminis-
trations of LSD. Barr et al. (1972) also stated that “…the
phenomena induced by LSD… cannot be predicted or
understood in purely pharmacological terms; the per-
sonality of the drug taker plays an enormous and
critical role in determining how much effect there will
be and of what particular type.”
However, until we understand the fundamental
nature of consciousness and its underlying neuronal
substrates, as well as the unconscious, it will not be
possible to scientifically test Grof’s hypothesis. What
can be discussed are the findings that point to in-
volvement of specific receptors in certain brain areas
that lead to the overt effects of psychedelics. In addi-
tion, recent brain scanning technologies, including
PET, fMRI, EEG, magnetoencephalography (MEG), and
pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI),
have also allowed the identification of key brain areas
that must be involved in the actions of psychedelics.
One should keep in mind that the effects of psyche-
delics are highly variable and are not necessarily dose
dependent. At low doses of LSD (e.g., ,100 mg), sensory
and cognitive processes may be distorted and altered
but the user generally remains aware that the effects
are attributable to having ingested the drug. For the
purposes of clinical investigations, such doses allow the
use of various questionnaires, instruments, and inter-
views to determine the intensity and qualitative aspects
of the drug effect. Even lower doses of LSD are popular
for recreational use or group events in which the user
wishes to remain in contact with their surroundings.
By contrast, high doses have a greater propensity to
transport the user to an alternate reality, where they
lose contact with their everyday environment. These
Psychedelics
279
 occasions are often described as “peak experiences,”
“transcendent,” or “mystical” and are profoundly al-
tered states of consciousness. Users may feel that they
have transcended time and space or encountered their
concept of “God,” or they may feel that they have
encountered otherworldly beings, feelings of being at
one with the universe, reliving past memories, and so
forth. With respect to medical value, this state of
consciousness is most closely associated with dramatic
therapeutic improvement. Although this phenomenon
is more likely to occur after high doses of psychedelics, it
can occur at nearly any dose if the set and setting have
been optimized to promote such an ASC. These experi-
ences are often characterized as among the most
meaningful of the subject’s life (e.g., see Griffiths
et al., 2006) and can lead to persisting positive effects
on attitudes, mood, and behavior.
A. Evidence for Agonist or Partial Agonist Action at
Serotonin 5-Hydroxytryptamine 2A Receptors
It was only a decade after the discovery of the
remarkable psychopharmacology of LSD that the pres-
ence of serotonin was demonstrated in the mammalian
brain (Twarog and Page, 1953). A comparison of the
chemical structures of LSD and serotonin (shown
earlier) led to early hypotheses that the action of LSD
was due to an interaction with serotonin systems in the
brain. Ten years after the discovery of LSD, Gaddum
(1953) reported that LSD antagonized the action of
serotonin in peripheral tissues. Only 1 year later,
Gaddum and Hameed (1954) and Woolley and Shaw
(1954) independently proposed that the effects of LSD
might result from serotonin receptor blockade in the
CNS. Shaw and Woolley (1956) later modified their
hypothesis to include the possibility that LSD might
mimic the actions of serotonin. Numerous studies in the
subsequent decade examined the possibility that LSD
blocked the actions of serotonin, but it was a concept
that proved untenable. It was clear, however, that LSD
did have a potent effect on brain serotonin systems,
elevating whole brain serotonin content (Freedman,
1961) and reducing brain levels of the major metabolite
of serotonin, 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (Rosecrans
et al., 1967).
Ultimately, Andén et al. (1968) suggested that LSD
might have direct agonist actions at serotonin receptors
in the brain. Subsequently, studies from numerous
laboratories provided support for that idea, with an
initial focus on serotonin 5-HT1A receptors (see discus-
sion in Nichols, 2004). When serotonin receptor–
selective antagonists became available, it was Glennon
et al. (1983, 1984) who demonstrated in a rat drug
discrimination model that the 5-HT2 antagonists ketan-
serin and pirenperone blocked the discriminative cue of
a psychedelic. Further studies in numerous laboratories
over the next 2 decades, primarily with rodents, then
focused attention on the 5-HT2A receptor as the primary
target for psychedelics. Agonist or partial agonist
activity at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor was ultimately
concluded to be a necessary pharmacology for psyche-
delic effects, but it may not be sufficient to explain all of
the qualitative differences between different drugs.
As Ray (2010) pointed out, different molecules may
also have significant affinity for other types of brain
receptors.
The first definitive experiment pointing to the central
role of the 5-HT2A receptor for the action of psychedelics
in humans came from a clinical study by Vollenweider
et al. (1998), who showed that the effects of psilocybin
were blocked by the 5-HT2A receptor–selective antago-
nist ketanserin or the atypical antipsychotic risperi-
done but were enhanced by the dopamine antagonist
and typical antipsychotic haloperidol. These data pro-
vided the first evidence that psilocybin-induced effects in
humans were due to 5-HT2A receptor activation. Sub-
sequently, Vollenweider and colleagues have carried out
several additional clinical studies, discussed later, of
various aspects of the action of psilocybin and have shown
that ketanserin can block most of those effects.
Kometer et al. (2012) carried out a randomized,
double-blind study in 17 healthy human subjects. On
4 separate days, subjects received placebo, psilocybin
(215 mg/kg), the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin (50 mg,
p.o.), or psilocybin plus ketanserin. Mood states were
assessed, and behavioral and event-related potential
measurements were used to quantify facial emotional
recognition and goal-directed behavior toward emo-
tional cues. Psilocybin was found to enhance positive
mood and attenuate negative facial expression recogni-
tion. Furthermore, psilocybin increased goal-directed
behavior toward positive compared with negative cues,
facilitated positive but inhibited negative sequential
emotional effects, and valence-dependently attenuated
the P300 component. Ketanserin given alone had no
effect but blocked the psilocybin-induced mood enhance-
ment and decreased recognition of negative facial
expression. This study demonstrated that psilocybin
shifts the emotional bias across various psychologic
domains and that activation of 5-HT2A receptors is
central in mood regulation and emotional face recogni-
tion in healthy subjects. The authors suggest that their
findings have implications not only for the pathophys-
iology of dysfunctional emotional biases, but they may
also provide a framework to delineate the mechanisms
underlying psilocybin’s putative antidepressant effects.
Quednow et al. (2012) investigated the role of 5-HT2A
receptors in automatic (sensorimotor gating) and con-
trolled (Stroop interference) inhibition processes in a
model psychosis approach using psilocybin (260 mg/kg)
in 16 healthy humans pretreated either with the
5-HT2A–selective receptor antagonist ketanserin (40
mg) or placebo, using a placebo-controlled, crossover,
counterbalanced, and double-blind design. They found
that
psilocybin-induced

 controlled inhibition were significantly attenuated by
ketanserin. They also replicated their previous findings
that most of the subjective hallucinogenic effects of
psilocybin were abolished by ketanserin.
Kometer et al. (2013) assessed the effects of psilocybin
(215 mg/kg) on both a oscillations that regulate corti-
cal excitability and early visual evoked P1 and N170
potentials in 16 healthy human subjects. They
employed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-
subject,
randomized
design.
Psilocybin
generally
significantly increased 5D-ASC scores after placebo
pretreatment, but not after ketanserin pretreatment.
Psilocybin strongly decreased both prestimulus parieto-
occipatal a power and decreased N170 potentials
associated with the appearance of visual perceptual
alterations, including visual hallucinations. Preadmi-
nistration of the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin (50 mg)
blocked all of these effects. The authors conclude that
5-HT2A receptor activation by psilocybin profoundly
modulates the neurophysiological and phenomenologi-
cal indices of visual processing. They further propose
that 5-HT2A receptor activation may induce a process-
ing mode in which stimulus-driven cortical excitation is
overwhelmed
by
spontaneous
neuronal
excitation
through modulation of a oscillations.
Indirect evidence for a role of 5-HT2A receptors in
mediating psychedelic-induced hallucinations comes
from a study by Huot et al. (2010). In that study, [3H]
ketanserin binding was used to compare 5-HT2A re-
ceptor density in postmortem brains of patients with
Parkinson’s disease (PD) who experienced visual hallu-
cinations with the brains of PD patients who did not
experience hallucinations. Six brains from patients
with idiopathic PD who experienced visual hallucina-
tions were compared with six PD patients without
visual hallucinations and five healthy, age-matched
controls. In PD patients with visual hallucinations,
[3H]ketanserin binding was increased 45.6% in infero-
lateral temporal cortex compared with PD patients who
did not have visual hallucinations. The authors suggest
that increased 5-HT2A density in the inferolateral
temporal cortex may be the basis for visual hallucina-
tions in PD patients and that 5HT2A antagonists may
alleviate this symptom.
Similarly, Ballanger et al. (2010) measured 5-HT2A
binding in vivo using [18F]setoperone PET in brains of
seven PD patients with visual hallucinations and seven
age-matched PD patients without visual hallucinations.
Patients with visual hallucinations had significantly
increased 5-HT2A receptor binding in several cortical
regions and one subcortical region. These increased
levels of 5-HT2A receptor expression were clustered
mainly in the ventral visual pathway. With the evidence
of increased 5-HT2A receptor expression as a possible
basis for visual hallucinations in PD patients, a seroto-
nin 5-HT2A inverse agonist, perhaps not surprisingly,
demonstrated phase 3 clinical efficacy in treating
several symptoms of PD psychosis, including visual
hallucinations (Hacksell et al., 2014).
Halberstadt et al. (2011a) examined the effects of
several psychedelics on the mouse head twitch response
(HTR) in wild-type (WT) male C57BL/6J or 5-HT2A
knockout (KO) mice. They also assessed investigatory
and locomotor activity in the mouse behavioral pattern
monitor (BPM). Psilocin and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyl-
tryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) produced the HTR in WT
mice but not in KO mice. Psilocin and 5-MeO-DMT
reduced locomotor activity, investigatory behavior, and
center duration in the BPM, and these effects were
blocked by the selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-
100635 (N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-
N-(2-pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide), indicating that
psilocin and 5-MeO-DMT act as mixed 5-HT1A/5-HT2A
agonists. Halberstadt and Geyer (2011) reviewed the
extensive literature covering various indoleamines as
well as LSD and concluded that although the phenethyl-
amines primarily exert their effects through activation of
5-HT2A receptors, indoleamines can have a significant
behavioral component mediated by activation of 5-HT1A
receptors.
Quednow et al. (2010), using [18F]altanserin PET,
found that the intensity of psilocybin-induced subjective
effects measured using the 5D-ASC was directly corre-
lated with the level of 5-HT2A receptor occupation by
psilocin in the ACC and medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC).
B. Production of Tolerance
Repeated administration of psychedelics leads to a
very rapid development of tolerance known as tachy-
phylaxis, a phenomenon believed to result from 5-HT2A
receptor downregulation. Daily administration of LSD
leads essentially to complete loss of sensitivity to the
effects of the drug by day 4 (Cholden et al., 1955;
Belleville et al., 1956). Likewise, in humans, daily
administration of the hallucinogenic amphetamine
2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM) also led
to significant tolerance to the drug effect by day 3
(Angrist et al., 1974). In humans, cross-tolerance occurs
between mescaline and LSD (Balestrieri and Fontanari,
1959) and between psilocybin and LSD (Isbell et al.,
1961). Tolerance and cross-tolerance to hallucinogens
also develops in animal models (Freedman et al., 1958;
Smythies et al., 1966; Appel and Freedman, 1968;
Winter, 1971; Freedman and Boggan, 1974; Wallach
et al., 1974; Trulson et al., 1977; Commissaris et al.,
1980).
Several studies have shown that rapid tolerance to
psychedelics correlates with downregulation of 5-HT2A
receptors. For example, daily LSD administration selec-
tively decreased 5-HT2 receptor density in the rat brain
(Buckholtz et al., 1985, 1990). Not only LSD, but the
hallucinogenic amphetamines DOB and 2,5-dimethoxy-
4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) also produced 5-HT2 receptor
Psychedelics
281
 downregulation after repeated dosing in rats (Buckholtz
et al., 1988). McKenna et al. (1989) also reported that
chronic treatment of rats with DOI led to downregulation
of brain 5-HT2 receptors. The structures of DOM, DOB,
and DOI are shown in Fig. 4.
Repeated treatment of rats with DOM also led to
rapid desensitization and downregulation of central 5-
HT2 receptors (Leysen et al., 1989), with a significant
reduction in the total number of cortical 5-HT2 sites
after only two drug treatments (2.5 mg/kg s.c. every 8
hours). Smith et al. (1999) similarly found that toler-
ance to the discriminative stimulus effect of DOI in rats
correlated with downregulation of 5-HT2A receptors,
but they observed no change in density of 5-HT2C
receptors. Short agonist treatment also led to desensi-
tization of 5-HT2A receptor–mediated phosphoinositide
(PI) hydrolysis in transfected cell lines (Ivins and
Molinoff, 1991; Roth et al., 1995; Gray and Roth, 2001).
In contrast with most other G protein–coupled recep-
tors (GPCRs), the 5-HT2A receptor undergoes down-
regulation in response either to agonist or antagonist
treatment (Gray and Roth, 2001). Two nonconserved
residues in the 5-HT2A receptor, S421 in the C terminus,
and S188 in intracellular loop 2, have been reported
to be essential for agonist-induced desensitization in
cloned receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney
293 (HEK-293) cells (Gray et al., 2003). When either
residue was mutated to alanine, 5-HT–induced desen-
sitization was markedly attenuated.
Damjanoska et al. (2004) examined levels of Gaq, Ga11,
RGS4, and RGS7 proteins after chronic R-(2)-DOI
treatment of rats. They used comparison of 5-HT versus
guanosine 59-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPgS)–stimulated
phospholipase C (PLC) activity (inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate
production) and DOI-induced increases in plasma levels of
adrenocorticotrophic hormone, corticosterone, and oxyto-
cin. Rats were injected with R-(2)-DOI (1 mg/kg, i.p.) for 1,
4, and 7 days, or saline. 5-HT–stimulated PLC activity
decreased 24% after 4 days and 30% after 7 days of DOI
treatment. DOI treatment did not affect GTPgS-
stimulated PLC activity in the frontal cortex. DOI
treatment for 1 or 54 days did not alter Gaq; however,
treatment for 7 days decreased Gaq by 47%, although
levels of Ga11 were not changed. RGS4 and RGS7 levels
did not change. Basal plasma adrenocorticotrophic hor-
mone, corticosterone, and oxytocin levels were not signif-
icantly altered after any time of DOI treatment, but daily
DOI for 4 days significantly reduced the response to a DOI
challenge. Data suggest that desensitization of 5-HT2A
receptor signaling is not due to reduced ability of Gaq/11
proteins to stimulate PLC but rather is due to a change in
5-HT2A receptors or their coupling to G proteins. The
desensitization of 5-HT2A receptors is most likely attribut-
able to post-translational modifications of the receptor
(e.g., phosphorylation), Gaq or Ga11 proteins, altering the
5-HT2A receptor to G protein interface.
Shi et al. (2008) examined agonist-induced desensiti-
zation of 5-HT2A receptors in the rat hypothalamic para-
ventricular nucleus (PVN) with 1 mg/kg R-(2)-DOI.
Treatment with R-(2)-DOI for either 4 or 7 days caused
a significant approximately 50% decrease in high-affinity
5-HT2A binding, compared with saline-treated controls.
Oxytocin and acetylcholine (ACh) release induced by
5-HT2A receptor activation were also suppressed in a
dose-dependent manner after treatment with DOI. By
contrast, Western blot analysis revealed a significant
increase in receptor protein. Taken together, the de-
creased high-affinity binding and decreased hormone
release, but increased receptor protein, suggested a
functional uncoupling of the 5-HT2A receptors after
chronic treatment with DOI.
LSD and DOB induce a ketanserin-sensitive increase
in shaking behavior in mice and rats, which includes
both head twitches and wet dog shakes. Substan-
tial evidence suggests that shaking behavior primarily
results from metabotropic glutamate mGlu2/3-sensitive
glutamate release downstream of frontocortical 5-HT2A
activation (this review). Buchborn et al. (2015) investi-
gated whether behavioral tolerance to LSD and DOB
resulted from adaptations of 5-HT2A and mGlu2/3
signaling, or of 5-HT2A and/or overall-glutamate bind-
ing sites in the frontal cortex. Male Sprague-Dawley
rats were administered LSD tartrate (0.025 mg/kg, i.p.)
or DOB HCl (0.25 mg/kg, i.p.) seven times over 4
consecutive days (a low dose every morning and a high
dose on the evening of days 1–3). Immediately after agonist
administration, the occurrence of body shaking behavior
was monitored for 30 minutes. Twenty-four hours after the
last treatment, rats were decapitated and the frontal
cortices were dissected and homogenized. For binding
studies, aliquots containing 175–200 mg protein were
incubated at 37°C with either [3H]spiroperidol (0.25 nM,
30 minutes) or [3H]glutamate (50 nM, 40 minutes). For
measurement of 5-HT2A and mGlu2/3 coupling to G
proteins, crude synaptic membrane pellets were resus-
pended and aliquots containing 15–20 mg protein were
incubated with 3 mM GDP and 0.05 nM [35S]GTPgS.
Both LSD (0.025 mg/kg, i.p.) and DOB (0.25 and
0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) induced significant shaking behavior,

 with LSD being about 10-fold more potent than DOB,
although the maximal effect of LSD was much lower.
LSD induced more wet dog shakes than head twitches,
but the pattern was reversed for DOB. Ketanserin, a
5-HT2A–selective antagonist, (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg, i.p., 30
minutes before agonist), blocked the overall shaking
behavior of both psychedelics. Both LSD and DOB
shaking behavior significantly decreased over the time
course of the experiment (Buchborn et al., 2015).
Repeated DOB treatment significantly reduced DOB-
sensitive [3H]spiroperidol binding to membranes of the
frontal cortex, but glutamate-sensitive [3H]glutamate
binding remained unaffected. By contrast, repeated LSD
treatment significantly reduced frontocortical [3H]gluta-
mate binding, but there was only a nonsignificant trend
for reduction of [3H]spiroperidol binding. After repeated
DOB, but not LSD, treatment, there was a significant
decrease in DOB-induced [35S]GTPgS binding to fron-
tocortical membranes. LY354740 [(1S,2S,5R,6S)-2-
aminobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid], a
mGlu2/3 agonist, induced [35S]GTPgS binding that was
significantly reduced after repeated treatment with
either DOB or LSD. For DOB-tolerant animals, both
5-HT2A and [3H]glutamate binding were highly corre-
lated with the number of shaking behaviors observed on
the last day of repeated DOB treatment, whereas only
[3H]glutamate binding correlated with shaking behav-
ior for LSD-tolerant animals.
Buchborn et al. (2015) concluded that the differential
receptor adaptations observed for DOB and LSD, re-
spectively, indicate that tolerance to serotonergic hallu-
cinogens can arise at two levels. That is, if a psychedelic
(e.g., LSD) for some reason fails to downregulate 5-HT2A
receptors, glutamate receptors might adapt instead and
thus prevent cortical overstimulation.
Moreno et al. (2013) investigated the effects of chronic
treatment with the mGlu2/3 receptor inverse antago-
nist
LY341495
[2-[(1S,2S)-2-carboxycyclopropyl]-3-
(9H-xanthen-9-yl)-D-alanine] on the 5-HT2A receptor–
dependent cellular and behavioral responses induced
in mice by LSD. Male 129S6/SvEv mice or mGlu2-KO
mice were injected daily for 21 days with the mGlu2/3
inverse agonist LY341495 (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle.
Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation 1 day
after the last injection of LY341495 and changes in
[3H]ketanserin and [3H]LY341495 binding were assessed
in the bilateral somatosensory cortex. The head-twitch
behavioral response was also measured 1 day after the last
injection with chronic LY341495. Induction of c-fos, egr-1,
and egr-2 by LSD (0.24 mg/kg) was measured 1 day after
the last injection with chronic LY341495.
Analysis of the maximum number of binding sites
(Bmax) by Moreno et al. (2013) revealed a lower density
of mGlu2/3 receptors in the somatosensory cortex from
mice chronically treated with LY341495. The number of
[3H]ketanserin binding sites was also decreased in WT
mice, but not in mGlu2-KO mice; there was no effect on
KD. The head-twitch behavior induced by LSD was also
decreased in mice chronically treated with LY341495. A
single dose of LSD induced expression of c-fos in mice
chronically treated with saline, but not in mice chron-
ically treated with LY341495. A single dose of LSD
induced expression of egr-1 in the somatosensory cortex
of mice chronically treated with saline, but not in mice
chronically treated with LY341495. A single dose of
LSD also induced egr-2 expression in both saline-
injected mice and in mice chronically treated with
LY341495, but egr-2 expression induced by LSD was
lower in mice chronically treated with LY341495 com-
pared with that observed in mice chronically treated
with vehicle.
This study by Moreno et al. (2013) demonstrates that
chronic treatment with the mGlu2/3 receptor inverse
agonist LY341495 downregulates 5-HT2A receptor
binding in the mouse somatosensory cortex through a
mechanism that requires expression of the mGlu2
receptor, because this effect was not observed in mGlu2
KO mice. The lower density of 5-HT2A receptors corre-
lates with changes in hallucinogen-like behavioral and
cellular responses that require expression of the 5-HT2A
receptor in the mouse brain cortex. Thus, chronic
treatment with LY341495 decreases LSD-dependent
head-twitch behavior as well as LSD-dependent in-
duction of expression of c-fos, egr-1, and egr-2 in the
mouse somatosensory cortex. In conclusion, data from
Moreno et al. (2013) support the hypothesis that chronic
blockade of mGlu2 receptor–dependent signaling down-
regulates 5-HT2A receptor binding in the mouse so-
matosensory cortex and its hallucinogen-like cellular
signaling and behavioral effects. Given that mGlu2
receptors are located presynaptically, their blockade
would lead to excessive glutamate release, potentially
resulting in feedback downregulation of 5-HT2A recep-
tors expressed on the pyramidal apical dendrites.
C. Functional Selectivity at the Serotonin
5-Hydroxytryptamine 2A Receptor
Although there is very strong evidence that psyche-
delics act by an agonist or partial agonist action at
5-HT2A receptor, the past 15 years has seen increasing
awareness of the fact that GPCRs can and do couple to
more than one intracellular signaling pathway. That
is, although the canonical signaling pathway for the
5-HT2A receptor is Gaq coupling and activation of PLC, it
is now known that other signaling pathways can be
activated. The relative activation of these different
pathways is ligand dependent, has most often been
referred to as “functional selectivity” (and also as ligand
bias) (Urban et al., 2007), and has recently been
reviewed (see Seifert, 2013; Zhou and Bohn, 2014).
One can readily envision that when an endogenous
neurotransmitter (e.g., serotonin) binds within the
orthosteric site of one of its receptors, the receptor
protein will collapse around the ligand to generate a
Psychedelics
283
 transient and distinct ligand-receptor ensemble. That
ensemble will result in conformational changes on the
intracellular face of the receptor that lead to comple-
mentary association with a subset of available cellular
signaling molecules. For example, the ethylamine side
chain of serotonin is relatively flexible, and the recep-
tor and the ligand will “adapt” to each other through
complementary steric, electronic, and conformational
changes in both the ligand and the receptor to generate
a transient and specific ligand-receptor ensemble. By
contrast, LSD is a synthetic conformationally rigid
tetracyclic agonist molecule. When it binds to the same
receptor, LSD and the receptor will again “adapt” to
each other through complementary steric, electronic,
and conformational changes. With LSD, however, be-
cause of the differences in the overall molecular struc-
tures of serotonin and LSD, and the flexibility of
serotonin versus the conformational rigidity of LSD,
the LSD-receptor ensemble will differ from the one
formed when serotonin binds to the receptor. One can
easily imagine that each and every structural change
made in a series of agonist molecules might lead
to distinct ligand-receptor complexes (i.e., a ligand-
dependent state) and that these different complexes
may lead to activation of different subsets of intracel-
lular signaling molecules. Thus, although functional
selectivity has already been demonstrated for the 5-
HT2A receptor, it presently remains unknown which
particular signaling pathway(s) may be most relevant
for the actions of psychedelics. Therefore, when a
molecule is classified as a 5-HT2A agonist, what exactly
does that mean in terms of cellular responses? Further-
more, how will different proportions of intracellular
signaling events affect the qualitative aspects of a
“psychedelic” intoxication? It will take a great deal
more research before these questions can be answered.
The most well understood and recognized signaling
pathway mediated by the 5-HT2A receptor is coupling to
Gaq, resulting in stimulation of PI-specific PLC (Conn
and Sanders-Bush, 1984; Roth et al., 1984). This
enzyme
hydrolyzes
phosphatidylinositol
membrane
lipids at the sn-3 position, generating inositol-1,4,5-
triphosphate and diacylglycerol (Conn and Sanders-
Bush, 1986; Williams, 1999). The inositol phosphates
lead to release of Ca+2 from intracellular stores and
diacylglycerol remains bound to the membrane and
activates protein kinase C (PKC).
For a long time, it was assumed that PI hydrolysis
signaling was most relevant for the action of psyche-
delics, but this hypothesis has certain problems. To
begin with, LSD has very low efficacy in activating PI
turnover (Sanders-Bush et al., 1988; Egan et al., 1998).
In addition, Rabin et al. (2002) noted a lack of correla-
tion between the behavioral potency in drug substitu-
tion in rats trained to discriminate LSD or DOM from
saline, and efficacy in stimulating PI hydrolysis. They
concluded that 5-HT2A–mediated stimulation of PI
hydrolysis did not appear to be the critical signaling
mechanism involved in the discriminative stimulus
effects of hallucinogens. Similarly, Roth et al. (1997a)
found no significant relationship between high-affinity
agonist binding and ability to stimulate PI turnover,
and they proposed that additional transition states
of the receptor-ligand complex must be essential for
agonist efficacy.
Activation of 5-HT2A receptors also leads to stimulation
of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which preferentially hydro-
lyzes arachidonic acid (AA)–containing phospholipids at
the sn-2 position to produce freeAA and lysophospholipid.
This PLA2 pathway is independent of PLC-mediated
signaling (Berg et al., 1998; Kurrasch-Orbaugh et al.,
2003b) and has been demonstrated in hippocampal slices
(Felder et al., 1990) and cellular systems (Berg et al.,
1994; Tournois et al., 1998). The PLA2 signaling pathway
is more complex than the PI turnover cascade, appar-
ently involving multiple G proteins and the extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and p38 mitogen-
activated protein kinases (MAPKs), at least in NIH3T3
cells (Kurrasch-Orbaugh et al., 2003a).
Although the significance of this pathway has not
been investigated in detail, Qu et al. (2003) found that
administration of 2.5 mg/kg DOI to rats led to signifi-
cantly increased incorporation of [3H]AA in brain
membranes. Quantitative autoradiography revealed
large increases in [3H]-labeled AA incorporation, par-
ticularly in the neocortex. The largest increases were
seen in brain regions having high densities of 5-HT2A
receptors, compared with 5-HT2C sites.
It is clear that specific ligands interact with the
5-HT2A receptor to activate the PLC and PLA2 path-
ways to different extents. At the rat 5-HT2A receptor
expressed in NIH3T3 cells, for example, LSD, DOB,
psilocin, and 5-MeO-DMT have different EC50 values
and intrinsic activities in activating the AA and PI
turnover pathways (Kurrasch-Orbaugh et al., 2003b).
In that study, nearly all of the compounds studied had
greater potency in inducing AA release than in stimu-
lating PI turnover. Some of these differences are
noteworthy; for example, in psilocin, the potency for
activating AA release was nearly 30-fold greater than
for stimulating PI turnover.
Moya et al. (2007) compared two homologous series of
substituted psychedelic phenethylamines and phenyl-
isopropylamines for signaling at the 5-HT2A receptor
through PLC and PLA2 responses. They employed
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-FA4 cells stably express-
ing the human 5-HT2A receptor that had similar maxi-
mal responses for inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation
and AA release in response to serotonin. Relative
efficacies for AA release and IP accumulation varied
within the series, and the substituted amphetamines
had higher efficacy in both pathways. The amphet-
amines also produced a more robust in vivo rat HTR,
mediated through the 5-HT2A receptor.
284
Nichols
 The kinases participating in 5-HT2A receptor phos-
phorylation had proven elusive, but Sheffler et al.
(2006) first identified RSK2, one of the p90 ribosomal
S6 kinases (RSKs), which is a member of the ERK/
MAPK cascade. They reported that RSK2 has a regula-
tory function on GPCR signaling by exerting a “tonic
brake” on second messenger production. RSK2 was
coimmunoprecipitated with the FLAG–5-HT2A receptor
transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells, indicating an
in vitro association. Sheffler et al. (2006) showed
that RSK2 interacts with intracellular loop 3 (i3) of
the 5-HT2A receptor, within a conserved region contain-
ing an RSK2-like consensus phosphorylation motif
(275RAKLSD280). A number of comparison studies were
carried out with fibroblasts derived from RSK2+/+ and
RSK22/2 mice. In both types of fibroblasts, 5-HT in-
duced increased PI accumulation that was abolished by
the specific 5-HT2A antagonist M100907. In RSK22/2
fibroblasts, however, PI hydrolysis was enhanced rela-
tive to RSK2+/+ fibroblasts. Controls were run to de-
termine that there were no global changes in gene
expression in the absence of RSK2 and that the
augmented signaling in RSK2/2 fibroblasts was not
due to changes in expression of genes that regulate
GPCR second messenger production. The authors also
demonstrated that basal and 5-HT–stimulated ERK1/2
phosphorylation was increased in RSK22/2 compared
with RSK2+/+ fibroblasts. Their results showed that
RSK2 exerts a tonic brake on 5-HT2A receptor signaling.
The absence of RSK2 led to an increase in agonist
efficacy, measured as PI hydrolysis, without a change in
agonist potency. Their findings implied that RSK2 acts
proximal to activation of the receptor, at the level of
receptor–G protein coupling, perhaps by phosphoryla-
tion of the receptor.
In a follow-up study, Strachan et al. (2009) carried out
a more detailed examination of RSK2 and its relation-
ship to 5-HT2A receptor signaling, finding that RSK2
phosphorylates a conserved Ser314 within i3. In this
study, they reported that RSK2 negatively regulates
signaling in fibroblasts not only during the initial 0- to
90-second phase of signaling, but during the 0- to 60-
minute extended periods of signaling. Again, using
mouse RSK22/2 fibroblasts, they ectopically expressed
WT RSK2, N-terminal kinase-dead RSK2 (K100A), or
C-terminal
kinase-dead RSK2 (K451A) constructs.
They determined that RSK22/2 fibroblasts transfected
with WT RSK2 and RSK2-K451A, but not with the
RSK2-K100A mutant, expressed amounts of RSK2
similar to RSK2+/+ fibroblasts. RSK22/2 fibroblasts
expressing WT RSK, but not kinase-dead RSK2
(K451A) had attenuated agonist-mediated 5-HT2A sig-
naling levels comparable to RSK2+/+ fibroblasts, in-
dicating that RSK2 kinase activity was required to
regulate 5-HT2A receptor signaling. Incubation of puri-
fied 5-HT2A receptors with activated RSK2 and [g32P]
ATP led to robust [32P] incorporation into the receptor,
and the selective RSK inhibitor SL0101 (3-[(3,4-di-O-
acetyl-6-deoxy-a-L-mannopyranosyl)oxy]-5,7-dihydro-
2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4H-1benzopyran-4-one) blocked
this phosphorylation. These data supported the con-
clusion that activated and purified RSK2 phosphory-
lates the 5-HT2A receptor in vitro.
Using a peptide composed of the i3 loop amino acids
252–328, purified and activated RSK2, and [g32P]ATP,
Strachan et al. (2009) were able to demonstrate robust
[32P] incorporation into the purified i3 loop protein. The
residue within i3 that was phosphorylated was then
identified from among the 18 potential Ser/Thr kinase
phosphorylation sites using trypsin digestion and tan-
dem mass spectrometry. A major phosphorylation site
was identified as Ser314, with a minor site at Ser280.
The investigators then created S280A and S314A
mutants, rendering these sites phosphorylation defi-
cient. Activated RSK2 incorporated [32P] into both WT
and the S280A mutants to a similar extent, but the
S314A mutation completely abolished RSK2 phosphor-
ylation compared with the WT peptide. These results
thus confirmed S314 as the phosphorylation site within
i3 of the 5-HT2A receptor. This assignment was verified
using a phosphospecific antibody against phospho-
Ser314. These studies were all carried out with the
synthetic i3 peptide; the next experiments focused on
the intact full-length 5-HT2A receptor, where it was
confirmed that Ser314 was indeed phosphorylated.
Strachan et al. (2009) then immunopurified WT and
5-HT2A–S314A receptors from 32Pi-labeled fibroblasts
after RSK2 activation by epidermal growth factor
(EGF). EGF time-dependently activated RSK2 in both
types of fibroblasts. However, although phosphoryla-
tion was detected in the WT 5-HT2A fibroblasts, no
phosphorylation could be detected in the 5-HT2A–S314A
fibroblasts, showing that activated RSK2 phosphory-
lates Ser314 not only in vitro but also in intact cells.
Finally, the authors compared the IP accumulation and
intracellular Ca2+ release signaling pathways in both
WT and 5-HT2A–S314A expressed in intact cells. Three
5-HT2A receptor agonists [5-HT, DOI, and a-methylser-
otonin (AMS)] all showed increased efficacy and potency
in phosphorylation-deficient 5-HT2A–S314A fibro-
blasts, compared with WT receptors, both in mobilizing
significantly more Ca2+ and in IP accumulation. Taken
together, these studies show that removing the phos-
phorylation site at Ser314 in the 5-HT2A receptor i3 loop
renders it resistant to negative regulation by RSK2,
indicating that Ser314 phosphorylation possibly uncou-
ples the 5-HT2A receptor from its cognate G protein.
Strachan et al. (2009) also showed that RSK2 was
necessary for EGF-mediated heterologous desensitiza-
tion of the 5-HT2A receptor, showing for the first time
that a growth factor can heterologously desensitize
5-HT2A receptor signaling.
In a third study, Strachan et al. (2010) carried out a
focused screen to evaluate the effect of RSK2 expression
Psychedelics
285
 on the signaling of a set of chemically diverse 5-HT2A
receptor agonists using IP accumulation, Ca2+ release,
and ERK1/2 phosphorylation as readouts. They found
that genetic deletion of RSK2 significantly increased
relative efficacies of agonists at multiple effector path-
ways. 5-HT, AMS, and DOI elicited significantly greater
maximal increases in IP accumulation, Ca2+ release,
and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in RSK2 KO mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The relative efficacies
of quipazine, 5-MeO-DMT, lisuride, and meta-chloro-
phenylpiperazine (m-CPP) were significantly increased
at all three effector readouts in RSK2 KO MEFs. In
contrast with effects on maximal signaling, relative
agonist potencies were not potentiated, with few excep-
tions. The ratios of the Emax responses for RSK2 KO
MEFs and WT MEFs differed for each agonist and
response, with the greatest changes seen for IP accu-
mulation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Strachan et al.
(2010) compared responses in WT and KO MEFs for a
variety of agonists and partial agonists, with a detailed
discussion of the effects; overall, their data suggested
that 5-HT2A agonists were differentially responsive to
RSK2 deletion. Their study provides the first evidence
that a relatively minor change in the cellular kinome is
sufficient to elicit profound alterations in relative
agonist efficacy, and they demonstrate that patterns
of functional selectivity can vary depending on the
cellular milieu of the receptor studied.
In addition to RSK2, other kinases can affect 5-HT2A
signaling. For example, PKC phosphorylation of serine
residue S291 in the 5-HT2A receptor is also thought to
play a role in modulation of receptor signaling. Using
five different ligands that activate the 5-HT2A receptor,
Raote et al. (2013) showed that different biochemical
pathways are involved in receptor trafficking. These
investigators used the fluorescence of rat 5-HT2A en-
hanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) to follow
receptor internalization. This transcript was stably
transfected into HEK-293 cells to generate what the
authors designated as an SB1 cell population. Seroto-
nin, dopamine, DOI, and clozapine all produced robust
internalization, whereas the 5-HT2A antagonist ketan-
serin did not. PKC activation by a phorbol ester (PMA)
was sufficient to cause endocytosis in the absence of any
agonist. In an earlier study, the authors had shown that
PKC activation was required for internalization by
5-HT, but not by dopamine. DOI, but not clozapine,
also required PKC to cause internalization. Sphingo-
sine, an inhibitor of PKC activation, almost completely
prevented 5-HT– or DOI–mediated receptor internali-
zation but did not affect dopamine-mediated internali-
zation. The inverse agonist clozapine caused receptor
internalization independent of PKC activation. Serine
residue 291 in the 5-HT2A receptor was identified as a
possible PKC phosphorylation site, which when mu-
tated to an alanine (5-HT2A–S291A–EGFP) completely
blocked internalization in response to 5-HT and DOI,
but internalization by dopamine and clozapine was not
affected, with behavior like the WT receptor. Because
5-HT2A receptor internalization can be induced by PKC
activation in the absence of ligand, the investigators
hypothesized that the PKC-phosphorylation–deficient
5-HT2A–S291A mutant would be insensitive to PMA-
induced internalization. Consistent with their hypoth-
esis, no internalization could be detected after PKC
activation by 4 nM PMA. The recycling time for the
5-HT2A receptor after treatment with the different
agonists was also shown to be ligand dependent, in
which 5-HT or dopamine receptors internalized and
were completely recycled after 2.5 hours, whereas
recycling of DOI-internalized receptors was only com-
plete in 7.5 hours. In addition, receptors that required
PKC for internalization also required protein phospha-
tase 2A, a pH-sensitive, endosome-localized enzyme
that may play a role in receptor recycling internalized
in a phosphorylation-dependent manner.
Cussac et al. (2008) reported differential agonist
action for a series of serotonergic ligands, including
LSD and DOI, and using CHO cells stably expressing
the human 5-HT2A receptor. [They also used cells
transfected with the human 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C (VSV
isoform) receptors, obtaining generally similar results,
but the discussion here will focus on their work with the
5-HT2A receptor.] They measured specific activation of
Gq/11 proteins using a scintillation proximity assay and
used a fluorescent imaging plate reader assay to
measure intracellular Ca2+ responses. Serotonin and
5-carboxytryptamine gave a 20- to 50-fold greater
potency for Ca2+ release than measured for Gq/11
activation, whereas DOI showed only a modest 2-to
3-fold preference for Ca2+ release. As anticipated,
M100907 potently blocked serotonin-stimulated Gq/11
proteins. LSD showed a 20-fold higher potency to
stimulate Gq/11 than to induce Ca2+ release. The most
striking separation between activities was for the non-
hallucinogenic 5-HT2A agonist lisuride, which was as
potent as DOI in stimulating Gq/11, more than 1000-fold
more potent than at Ca2+ release, and was a partial
agonist for the two pathways. Interestingly, Ca2+ mobi-
lization is classically considered to be a downstream
consequence of Gq/11 activation and subsequent PLC
stimulation. Yet the results presented here suggest that
Gq/11 signaling may not be the only determinant of Ca2+
signaling. The main result of this study, however, was the
ability of different agonists to differentially activate two
signaling pathways in the same cell type.
b-Arrestins are intracellular scaffolding proteins that
can attenuate or facilitate GPCR signaling, and repre-
sent another potential signaling path that may depend
for their activation on specific ligands. Schmid et al.
(2008) tested whether 5-HT2A receptor regulation by
b-arrestins contributes to serotonergic responsiveness
in vivo by comparing WT mice with mice that lack
b-arrestin-2. L-5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) produced
286
Nichols
 the HTR in WT mice but gave a greatly attenuated
response in b-arrestin-2 KO mice. DOI, however, pro-
duced an HTR of equal magnitude in both genotypes,
indicating that b-arrestin-2 mediates the 5-HTP–
induced HTR, whereas the HTR produced by DOI is
b-arrestin-2 independent. In addition, the investigators
used transfected MEFs derived from b-arrestin-1
and b-arrestin-2-KO embryos. Culturing WT MEFs
transfected with a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)
C-terminally tagged 5-HT2A receptor in complete media
(containing 10% fetal bovine serum) revealed that the
majority of the 5-HT2A–YFP was internalized in WT
MEFs. This expression could be reversed by removing
the serum from the media for a 2-hour incubation,
indicating that serotonin in the media was probably
causing receptor internalization. Consistent with this
reasoning, adding serotonin to serum-free media for the
culturing resulted in 5-HT2A–YFP internalization in
WT MEFs. The b-arrestin-1 KO and b-arrestin-2 KO
MEFs both retained 5-HT2A–YFP surface expression,
even in media containing serum; adding serotonin to the
media did not lead to internalization. Yet DOI produced
5-HT2A–YFP internalization not only in WT MEFs but
also in b-arrestin-1 KO and b-arrestin-2 KO MEFs.
These findings demonstrate that DOI-induced 5-HT2A
receptor internalization is b-arrestin independent,
whereas serotonin-mediated internalization requires
b-arrestins.
Examining ERK1/2 signaling, Schmid et al. (2008)
reported that serotonin induced robust ERK1/2 phos-
phorylation in b-arrestin KO cells, which was signifi-
cantly greater than that produced by DOI. Both
serotonin and DOI induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation
in KO cells, but the degree of stimulation was much
lower than in WT cells. Inhibition of PLC by U73122
(1-[6-[[(17b)-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl]amino]
hexyl]-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione) blocked approximately one-
third of serotonin-mediated activation of ERK1/2 in
WT cells in the canonical pathway but completely
blocked DOI-induced activation. In b-arrestin KO MEFs,
U73122 completely prevented ERK1/2 phosphorylation
induced by either serotonin or DOI. Thus, when the
5-HT2A receptor is expressed in MEF cells, DOI stimu-
lates ERK1/2 primarily through a PLC-dependent path-
way, whereas serotonin activates ERK1/2 predominantly
through a b-arrestin–dependent pathway.
To examine in vivo signaling, Schmid et al. (2008)
treated mice with either 5-HTP or DOI, and the frontal
cortices were dissected 15 minutes after drug treat-
ment, when behavioral responses were maximal. Sero-
tonin induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in WT mice but
not in b-arrestin-2 KO mice, whereas DOI led to
significant ERK1/2 activation in both genotypes. These
results demonstrate that b-arrestin-2 is necessary for
serotonin-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the fron-
tal cortex, but that DOI can activate ERK1/2 indepen-
dent of b-arrestin. These data emphasize that the
nature of the ligand determines the receptor signaling
pathway activated, which will determine the nature of
the ultimate physiologic response produced by that
ligand.
Schmid and Bohn (2010) demonstrated in vivo func-
tional selectivity at the 5-HT2A receptor by serotonin
and N-methyltryptamines, as well as in the mouse
frontal cortex and in primary cortical neurons, where
they showed that the actions of these neurotransmit-
ters were functionally distinct. In their earlier study,
Schmid et al. (2008) showed that in mice lacking
b-arrestin-2, an intraperitoneal dose of 100 mg/kg
5-HTP failed to induce the HTR in mice. When the dose
of 5-HTP was doubled, however, the HTR in b-arrestin-
2 KO mice approached that observed in WT mice. After
intracerebroventricular injection, low doses of serotonin
produced a robust HTR in mice that markedly exceeded
those observed in b-arrestin-2 KO mice. In fact, with
higher doses of serotonin, the HTR in b-arrestin-2 KO
mice even exceeded the response in their WT litter-
mates. The HTR induced by either serotonin or 5-HTP
was blocked by M100907, which demonstrated its
mediation through the 5-HT2A receptor. Although sero-
tonin is principally metabolized by MAO-A to afford
the inactive metabolite 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, at
high concentrations of serotonin, metabolism can occur
by N-methyltransferases to give N-methylserotonin
and N,N-dimethylserotonin (bufotenin). To determine
whether these metabolites might be formed and rele-
vant, mice were pretreated with the MAO-A–elective
inhibitor clorgyline. After clorgyline administration, the
HTR dose-response curve was left-shifted and occurred
in b-arrestin-2 KO mice at 5-HTP doses that were
ineffective if given alone. Again, M100907 blocked these
responses. When methimazole, an N-methyltransferase
inhibitor was preadministered, the number of HTR
responses after 5-HTP treatment was decreased in both
WT and b-arrestin-2 KO mice, although the inhibitory
effect was more marked in the b-arrestin-2 KO mice.
The effects of clorgyline and methimazole pretreatment
suggest that the HTR after 5-HTP treatment may be
due to N-methyltryptamines instead of serotonin itself.
Direct intracerebroventricular injection of N-methyl-
serotonin gave a greater HTR in b-arrestin-2 KO mice
than in their WT littermates. Systemic injection of
5-MeO-DMT gave a greater HTR in b-arrestin-2 KO mice
than in their WT littermates. These results were interpreted
to suggest that N-methyltryptamines do not require
b-arrestin-2 for the HTR, and that b-arrestin-2 may be a
negative regulator in this cascade because KO mice consis-
tently display greater responses to N-methyltryptamines.
Thus, the behavioral response to serotonin in b-arrestin-2
KO mice may fundamentally differ from that in WT mice.
Schmid and Bohn (2010) then assessed activation of
the serine threonine kinase Akt in the frontal cortex of
WT and b-arrestin-2 KO mice after treatment with
5-HTP (100 mg/kg) or 5-MeO-DMT (10 mg/kg). This
Psychedelics
287
 dose of 5-HTP produced the HTR only in WT mice, and
the dose of 5-MeO-DMT induced the greatest HTR in
both genotypes. Treating WT mice with 5-HTP led to
phosphorylation of Akt at threonine 308, but no Akt
phosphorylation was observed in KO mice. 5-MeO-DMT
did not lead to Akt phosphorylation in either genotype,
but there was no difference in Akt phosphorylation after
vehicle treatment in either genotype. These findings
suggest that serotonin and 5-MeO-DMT have differ-
ent abilities to activate Akt, and that serotonin re-
quires b-arrestin-2, whereas 5-MeO-DMT does not. The
5-HT2A receptor was then immunoprecipitated from the
frontal cortex of both WT and b-arrestin-2 KO mice after
drug treatment. A dose of 5-HTP in WT that stimulates
Akt phosphorylation in the cortex revealed a depletion
of protein PSD-95 from the complex and recruitment of
b-arrestin-2, Src, and Akt. In the cortex of b-arrestin-2
KO mice, however, no depletion of PSD-95 or recruit-
ment of Src or Akt was observed in response to 5-HTP.
After
5-MeO-DMT
treatment,
no
recruitment
of
b-arrestin-2, Src, or Akt to the 5-HT2A receptor occurred
in either genotype. These results demonstrate that
b-arrestin-2
is
essential
for
mediating
serotonin-
induced assembly of the 5-HT2A/Src/Akt complex, and
that 5-MeO-DMT differs from serotonin by not recruit-
ing this complex.
Schmid and Bohn (2010) followed up on this in vivo
finding by studying Akt phosphorylation in primary
neuronal cultures from the frontal cortex of WT and
b-arrestin-2 KO neonates. Serotonin (1 mM) gave a
robust phosphorylation of Akt in WT cortical neurons,
but neither N-methylserotonin nor 5-MeO-DMT acti-
vated Akt. Pretreatment with M100907 blocked Akt
phosphorylation in WT neurons after serotonin treatment,
showing that the effects of serotonin were mediated
through the 5-HT2A receptor. None of the tested agonists
led to Akt phosphorylation in neurons from b-arrestin-2
KO neonates. Inhibiting individual components of the
signaling cascade in the neurons also prevented Akt
phosphorylation. That is, pretreatment with the phosphoi-
nositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 (2-morpholin-
4-yl-8-phenylchromen-4-one) prevented serotonin-induced
phosphorylation of Akt in WT neurons, as did treatment
with the Src inhibitor PP2 [4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-
(dimethylethyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine].
To disrupt the function of the signaling complex in
vivo, the HTR in normal C57BL/6J mice was assessed
after intracerebroventricular administration of inhibi-
tors of PI3K, Src, and Akt prior to treatment with
5-HTP. Each of the three different inhibitors reduced
the HTR by approximately 50%. The Akt inhibitor had
no effect on the number of HTRs after 5-MeO-DMT
treatment, however. By contrast, pretreatment of
b-arrestin-2 KO mice with PI3K, Src, or Akt inhibitors
prior to 5-HTP did not reduce the HTR, suggesting that
the HTR in b-arrestin-2 mice is independent of these
signaling components. Schmid and Bohn (2010)
suggested that the HTR induced by high doses of 5-
HTP or serotonin in WT mice could reflect activity of
both serotonin and its N-methylated derivatives. Thus,
when WT mice were pretreated with the Akt inhibitor
together with an N-methyltransferase inhibitor prior to
5-HTP, the HTR was nearly abolished.
These results demonstrate functional selectivity at
the 5-HT2A receptor, in which serotonin and its
N-methylated derivatives promote differential signal-
ing in the mouse frontal cortex and in primary cortical
neurons and thus have different mechanisms underly-
ing manifestation of the HTR. That is, serotonin
activation leads to a signaling complex that involves
b-arrestin-2, Src, and Akt, whereas N-methylated de-
rivatives produce the HTR through a signaling mecha-
nism that is independent of b-arrestin-2 and does not
require activation of Akt. Bohn and Schmid (2010)
reviewed functional selectivity of the 5-HT2A receptor
and the role of arrestin as one of the signaling pathways.
Different agonist ligands acting at the 5-HT2A re-
ceptor also can lead to different downstream gene
expression patterns. González-Maeso et al. (2003)
quantified concentration-dependent gene changes in
response to various agonists in HEK-293 cells express-
ing the human 5-HT2A receptor, followed by exam-
ination of the in vivo gene expression responses in
the mouse somatosensory cortex. They identified 23
transcripts in these cells for which expression levels
were regulated after application of 10 mM 5-HT.
Concentration-response curves for gene induction by
four distinct agonists in these cells showed that the
agonists differed in their ability to activate different
genes; the different cellular signaling patterns trans-
lated into unique transcriptome fingerprints. The psy-
chedelics LSD and DOI induced the mouse HTR,
whereas the nonhallucinogenic ergoline lisuride failed
to induce the HTR. In 5-HT2A
2/2 mice, neither LSD nor
DOI produced the HTR, demonstrating that the HTR
was mediated by the 5-HT2A receptor.
González-Maeso et al. (2003) then compared effects
on in vivo gene expression of three agonists evaluated in
the HTR. Transcript levels in the mouse somatosensory
cortex 1 hour after agonist injection were compared by
quantitative
reverse-transcription
(RT)
polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) to those from vehicle-injected
controls. Thirteen transcripts showed significant
changes after at least one agonist, with each agonist
showing a unique and reproducible transcriptome fin-
gerprints. Of the genes identified, only early growth
response protein 1 (egr-1), early growth response pro-
tein 2 (egr-2), and period-1 were similarly activated by
DOI and LSD but were unaffected by lisuride. Their
data support the hypothesis that agonists acting at the
same receptor in vivo can induce unique patterns of
signaling, thereby eliciting different behavioral re-
sponses. Unique behavioral and signaling responses
elicited by each agonist studied in vivo appear to result
288
Nichols
 from agonist-specific differences in the activation of
multiple signaling pathways coupled to the 5-HT2A
receptor. Only the psychedelics DOI and LSD induced
increased expression of egr-1, egr-2, and period-1 tran-
scripts and were activated by changes in cortical
signaling that appear to be specific effects of the two
psychedelics, which correlate with the generation of the
mouse HTR.
Nichols and Sanders-Bush (2002) carried out the first
unbiased microarray screen on the action of LSD in the
rat brain by assessing the effects of intraperitoneal
administration of 1.0 mg/kg LSD in the prefrontal
cortex (PFC) 90 minutes after drug administration.
Their first screen yielded a collection of five genes that
were upregulated by LSD identified as serum glucocor-
ticoid kinase (sgk), inhibitor of nuclear factor kB (Ikb-a),
neuron-derived orphan receptor 1 (nor1; nr4a3), ania3,
and krox-20. RNase protection was used to validate
these genes as differentially expressed, in the PFC,
along with Arc and c-fos. Krox-20 is also known as early
growth response protein, or egr-2, and is the same gene
identified by González-Maeso et al. (2003) whose
expression is specifically increased in response to
treatment with hallucinogenic 5-HT2A agonists, as
contrasted with a nonhallucinogenic 5-HT2A agonist
(i.e., lisuride). Krox-20 (egr-2) has been shown to be
necessary for normal brain development and may be
involved in the maintenance of long-term potentiation
(LTP) (see references in Nichols and Sanders-Bush,
2002).
Nichols et al. (2003) subsequently examined the time
course, dose response, and sensitivity of the LSD re-
sponse to 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptor antagonists.
Most gene expression peaked at 90 minutes after drug
administration and returned to baseline 3–5 hours after
LSD treatment. The nor1 gene, however, remained
maximally elevated through the final 5-hour time point.
At the 0.20-mg/kg dose of LSD, two genes (krox-20, Ikb-
a) were significantly upregulated, and most expression
levels increased with successively higher (0.5–1.0 mg/
kg) doses of drug. The transcriptional effects of LSD
were unaffected by pretreatment with the selective 5-
HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 but were signif-
icantly attenuated by the 5-HT2A receptor–selective
antagonist M100907 [(R)-(+)-a-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-
1-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethyl]-4-piperinemethanol],
with
the exception of sgk and Ikb-a, which were unaffected
by MDL100907. Thus, the majority of LSD-related gene
expression alterations were induced through 5-HT2A
receptor activation, but other receptors contribute to its
effects (Nichols et al., 2003).
Extending this work further, Nichols and Sanders-
Bush (2004) performed a second microarray screen
using a different Affymetrix gene chip version, identi-
fying and validating three additional transcripts in-
creased by 1.0 mg/kg LSD in the rat PFC: MAP kinase
phosphatase 1 (mkp1), core/enhancer binding protein
b (C/EBP-b), and the novel gene, induced by lysergic acid
diethylamide 1 (ilad1; subsequently renamed arrestin
domain containing 2 or arrdc2). As with the other LSD-
induced differentially expressed genes, these also fol-
lowed a dose- and time-dependent expression pattern.
At the highest 1.0-mg/kg dose of LSD, expression of
mkp1, C/EBP-b, and ilad1 was only partially blocked
by MDL100907, indicating that activation of multiple
receptors probably contributes to the effects of LSD on
gene expression at this dose. Indeed, LSD is a relatively
nonselective serotonin and dopamine receptor ligand,
with high to moderate affinity for a number of receptors
that may contribute to its effects (Nichols, 2004).
The general functions of the genes induced by LSD
are varied, and little is known for some genes mentioned
above. A common theme linking the transcriptional
changes, however, appears to be an effect on synaptic
plasticity. For example, Ania3 is a splice variant within
the Homer1 gene family that encodes synaptic proteins,
and Ania3 has been implicated in metabotropic gluta-
mate receptor (mGluR)–mediated plasticity. C/EBP-b
is known to affect memory consolidation and synaptic
strength; Ikb-a inhibits nuclear factor kB, which is
important in synapse regulation; nor1 is a member
of the Nr4a family of activity-dependent transcription
factors, demonstrated to be important for transcription-
dependent LTP in the hippocampus; and sgk plays a
role in long-term memory and the expression of LTP in
hippocampal neurons (see references in Nichols and
Sanders-Bush, 2004). The way in which these genes
contribute to downstream transcriptional, structural,
and functional sequelae of neuronal activation, how-
ever, remains poorly understood.
Martí-Solano et al. (2015) compared relative signal-
ing bias of several putative 5-HT2A agonists in both the
PI hydrolysis and AA release pathways. They relied on
extensive molecular dynamics to generate binding
poses for the ligands in the receptor and then considered
how the ligand poses could potentially engage different
residues within the receptor to explain observed signal-
ing bias. Although in principle one could employ such an
approach to identify structural determinants for func-
tional selectivity, the molecular dynamics should be
guided by published mutagenesis studies. Although
some of the compounds studied by Martí-Solano et al.
(2015) did have a high bias for PI signaling over AA
release, the basis for their structural conclusions must
be considered suspect because of significant flaws in
their molecular modeling. For example, Braden and
Nichols (2007) showed that TM5 serine 239(5.43) in the 5-
HT2A receptor was critical for high affinity and potency
of 4- or 5-oxygenated tryptamines, potentially serving
as a hydrogen bond donor to the ligand, but Martí-
Solano et al. (2015) essentially ignore its role in their
molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, they (in-
correctly) state that “S5.43 is able to establish indirect
interactions with different serotonergic agonists,” citing
Psychedelics
289
 Braden and Nichols (2007). What Braden and Nichols
actually report was that the 5-HT2A–S5.43A mutant
receptor had markedly reduced affinity for 5-HT, 5-
methoxytryptamine, and 5-MeO-DMT, consistent with
the loss of a hydrogen bond (0.5–1.5 kcal/mol). Further-
more, the potency of 5-oxygenated tryptamines to
activate the PI hydrolysis pathway was also signifi-
cantly attenuated in the S5.43A mutant. Martí-Solano
et al. (2015) point out that in their molecular dynamics–
derived ligand binding mode S5.43 does not show direct
contacts with serotonin, but rather indirect ones via
N6.55. Other aspects of the binding modes they present
also are unexpected, because F6.52 (known to engage
the aromatic rings of 5-HT2A agonists) does not engage
the indole ring of serotonin or any of the other ligands
they explored. Previous site-directed mutagenesis stud-
ies have identified both F6.51 and 6.52 to be within the
5-HT2A agonist binding pocket (Choudhary et al., 1993,
1995; Roth et al., 1997b; Braden et al., 2006). It also is
well known that the 2-methoxy of phenethylamines
(e.g., 2,5-dimethoxy-4-nitrophenethylamine, one of the
ligands studied) is crucial for activity, yet their molec-
ular dynamics simulations and docking poses assign no
evident role to a complementary residue in the receptor.
Although Martí-Solano et al. (2015) argue that interac-
tion with N6.55 in helix 6 favors receptor conformations
with a preference to signal through the AA pathway,
with S5.46 responsible for facilitating signaling through
the IP pathway, significant problems with their docking
poses call these conclusions into question. Nonetheless,
if properly done, the type of approach employed by
Martí-Solano et al. (2015) likely could be used to help in
the identification of the structural basis for functional
selectivity.
D. Role of Glutamate
Research over the past 2 decades has clearly shown
that psychedelics enhance glutamatergic transmission
in the cortex at the neuronal level and also in behavioral
responses. At the neuronal level, using whole-cell re-
cording in rat brain slides, Aghajanian and Marek
(1997) first reported that 5-HT induced a calcium-
dependent rapid and dramatic increase in frequency
and amplitude of spontaneous (nonelectrically evoked),
glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic potentials
(EPSPs)/excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in
cortical pyramidal cells of layer V. The effect was most
robust in the mPFC and other frontal areas with a
high expression of 5-HT2A receptors in pyramidal api-
cal dendrites. The effect was completely blocked
by M100907 and also by the a-amino-3-hydroxy-
5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid/kainate antagonist
LY293558 [(3S,4aR,6R,8aR)-6-[2-(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)ethyl]-
1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid].
In a subsequent study, it was found that Sr2+ fully
substituted for Ca+2 in supporting the 5-HT–induced
increase in spontaneous EPSC frequency, but only
partially with respect to amplitude (Aghajanian and
Marek, 1999b). In the presence of Sr2+, however, late
asynchronous evoked EPSPs followed each electrical
stimulus, with an absence of synchronous EPSCs.
Serotonin reduced the amplitude of synchronous evoked
EPSCs, with an increase in frequency of spontaneous
excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) both before
and after electrical stimulation. Although late evoked
EPSCs were not evident, when 5-HT was washed out
and synchronous evoked EPSCs and sEPSCs were
returning to normal, late evoked EPSCs began to
appear that resembled the asynchronous evoked EPSCs
observed after Sr2+ substitution. It was speculated that
5-HT produced a hyperpolarizing effect, mediated
through 5-HT1A receptors, which might be masking
the 5-HT2A–mediated excitatory late component. As the
5-HT was washed out of the preparation, the 5-HT2A
receptor–mediated late component would be unmasked.
After application of DOI, a mixed 5-HT2A/2C agonist that
lacks 5-HT1A effects, the late component was evoked by
every stimulus in all tested cells. Application of
M100907 reversed the DOI effect. The authors note
that their data with Ca2+ and Sr2+ point to a presynaptic
5-HT2A action, although 5-HT2A receptors are known to
be expressed primarily postsynaptically on pyramidal
cell apical dendrites.
Delving more deeply into these mechanistic findings,
Marek et al. (2000) studied the effect of the selective
mGlu2/3 agonist LY354740 and the selective mGlu2/3
antagonist LY341495 on the 5-HT–induced EPSPs and
electrically evoked EPSPs in pyramidal cells from layer
V in the rat mPFC. They also examined the effect of
these two ligands on the effects of DOI, reporting that
the mGlu2/3 antagonist LY341495 enhanced the fre-
quency and amplitude of 5-HT–induced EPSCs by 30%–
65% and 12%–21%, respectively. The mGlu2/3 agonist
LY354740 was equipotent in suppressing both 5-HT–
induced EPSCs and DOI-enhanced electrically evoked
late EPSPs. Their findings were consistent with the
hypothesis that mGlu2/3 receptors function as inhibi-
tory autoreceptors in cortical glutamatergic terminals
that are positively regulated by activation of 5-HT2A
receptors. Using autoradiography, these authors fur-
ther demonstrated that the highest density of mGlu2/3
receptor binding in the mPFC is expressed in cortical
layers I and Va, in a laminar distribution similar to
5-HT2A receptor expression.
Administration of LSD to rats (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) led to a
significant increase in fos-like immunoreactivity in the
rat PFC and ACC that was completely blocked by
systemic pretreatment with the specific 5-HT2A antag-
onist MDL100907 (Gresch et al., 2002). Double staining
for both fos immunoreactivity and the 5-HT2A receptor
revealed that LSD did not induce fos in pyramidal cells
expressing 5-HT2A receptors in either the PFC or
parietal cortex. Increased fos expression was induced
in cortical cells in layers III and IV, with only rare
290
Nichols
 occurrence of a doubly labeled pyramidal cell, suggest-
ing fos induction by some indirect mechanism. Based on
the work from Aghajanian’s laboratory (Aghajanian and
Marek, 1997; Marek and Aghajanian, 1998a), the
authors speculated that this activation could result
from glutamatergic thalamocortical inputs.
In vivo microdialysis after systemic administration of
DOI revealed significantly increased extracellular glu-
tamate in the rat somatosensory cortex (Scruggs et al.,
2003). Intracortical reverse dialysis of DOI also in-
creased extracellular glutamate. The increase in gluta-
mate after intracortical DOI was blocked by the
selective 5-HT2A antagonist M100907. Similarly, using
microdialysis, extracellular glutamate also was signif-
icantly increased in the rat PFC 30 minutes after
0.1 mg/kg intraperitoneal LSD administration and con-
tinued for 30 minutes. This glutamate release was blocked
by preadministration of 0.05 mg/kg M100907 15 min-
utes prior to LSD administration (Muschamp et al.,
2004). Reverse dialysis of LSD for 30 minutes into the
rat PFC, followed by perfusion of drug-free solution for
45 minutes, led to a significant increase of glutamate
that remained elevated for at least 45 minutes after the
LSD perfusion ended. DOM (0.6 mg/kg, i.p.) similarly
increased extracellular glutamate measured in the rat
PFC (Muschamp et al., 2004).
Studies by Lambe and Aghajanian (2006) further
examined the basis for the enhanced late wave of
extrasynaptic transmission of glutamate in PFC brain
slices of the rat. They retarded the diffusion of gluta-
mate beyond the synapse by increasing the viscosity of
the extracellular space using a solution of dextran, a
procedure known to suppress glutamate spillover. They
also assessed the subtypes of N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptors involved in the late wave of increased
glutamate produced by LSD and DOI. They found that
the wash-in of a 5% dextran solution dramatically
attenuated the late EPSCs induced by LSD or DOI
without changing the fast EPSC. The suppression of the
late EPSCs (UP states) by dextran suggested that the
late wave of glutamate release induced by psychedelics
stimulates extrasynaptic, rather than synaptic, gluta-
mate receptors. Thus, the NMDA receptor subtype 2B
antagonists Ro25-6981 [(aR,bS)-a-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-
b-methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-piperidinepropanol]
and
ifenprodil markedly suppressed the DOI-induced late
EPSCs but had no effect on the fast EPSC. The effect
of psychedelics on UP states also could be partially
mimicked by a glutamate uptake inhibitor after block-
ing mGluR2/3. Their results indicate that psychedelics
increase glutamate spillover in a phasic manner.
Two explanations had been offered for the increase in
cortical glutamate after application of a 5-HT2A agonist.
The first was that glutamate was released from terminals
arising from the mediodorsal thalamus (Aghajanian and
Marek, 1997; Marek and Aghajanian, 1998a; Scruggs
et al., 2000). Some evidence for that mechanism was
provided by Marek et al. (2001), who found that lesions of
the medial thalamus in rats led to a significant decrease
in the frequency of 5-HT–induced EPSCs recorded from
layer V pyramidal cells. Autoradiographic experiments
showed that medial thalamic lesions led to a significant
decrease in the density of group II mGlu2/3 receptors
in the mPFC, consistent with the loss of presynaptic
glutamate terminals. Unexpectedly, however, these le-
sions led to increased density of cortical 5-HT2A receptors,
a finding that would not be entirely consistent with
presynaptic 5-HT2A receptor localization.
A major problem with the presynaptic glutamate
release hypothesis was the fact that immunocytochem-
istry studies had revealed that the majority (73%) of
5-HT2A immunopositive profiles were postsynaptic
processes, mostly proximal and distal dendritic shafts,
with only 24% of identifiable immunoreactive profiles
on presynaptic structures (Miner et al., 2003). These
latter structures only rarely formed synaptic contacts in
single sections, and 5-HT2A receptor labeling was not
typically observed in presumed glutamate axon termi-
nals, a finding consistent with other studies that had
failed to identify substantial numbers of 5-HT2A immu-
noreactive axon terminals with features characteristic
of glutamate profiles. Interestingly, the remaining
labeled profiles (4%) were glial processes, suggesting
that perhaps activation of 5-HT2A receptors on glial
processes might also induce glutamate release. These
results were not compatible with the hypothesis that
5-HT2A receptors might serve as presynaptic hetero-
receptors on mediodorsal thalamic glutamate terminals
in the middle layers of the PFC.
Evidence against the hypothesis of presynaptic glu-
tamate release from thalamic glutamate terminals was
provided by Puig et al. (2003), who examined the effect
of intravenous administration of cumulative doses of
DOI on pyramidal cell firing in vivo in the mPFC of
control animals and compared the responses with those
observed in animals with electrolytic lesions of the
mediodorsal and centromedial nuclei of the thalamus,
which project densely to the mPFC, as well as several
other nuclei that also project to the mPFC. They found
that DOI evoked a dramatic increase in the firing rate of
a subpopulation of mPFC pyramidal neurons that was
unaffected by prior lesioning of thalamic nuclei that
project to the mPFC, and the authors concluded that
DOI does not affect pyramidal cell firing by acting on
presynaptic 5-HT2A receptors putatively located on
thalamocortical afferents to the mPFC.
In a subsequent study, Celada et al. (2008) reported
that systemic administration of DOI markedly reduced
the amplitude of low frequency oscillations in the
mPFC, an effect that was completely blocked by pre-
administration of the selective 5-HT2A antagonist
M100907. They also compared responses to DOI in
control rats with rats that had been given electrolytic
lesions of several thalamic nuclei that project to the
Psychedelics
291
 mPFC. DOI was found to be equally effective in both
control rats and in rats with thalamic lesions, again
refuting the earlier hypothesis of the role of putative
thalamocortical 5-HT2A receptors as mediators of hal-
lucinogen action.
A second explanation for the increase in cortical
glutamate after hallucinogens was offered by Lambe
and Aghajanian (2001), who suggested that 5-HT2A
receptor activation on postsynaptic cells might lead to
release of a retrograde messenger. This substance
would then diffuse out from the postsynaptic membrane
and block K+ channels on presynaptic glutamate termi-
nals, leading to glutamate release. Neither of these
hypotheses survived further scientific scrutiny, how-
ever, because the ultimate source of glutamate was later
identified by Béïque et al. (2007), as discussed later.
Molinaro et al. (2009) studied the in vivo interac-
tion between 5-HT2A and mGlu2/3 receptors in the
mouse frontal cortex. Male CD1 mice first were in-
jected intracerebroventricularly with [myo-3H]inositol.
Twenty-four hours later, mice were treated with LiCl
subcutaneously, followed 1 hour later by drug adminis-
tration. The mGlu1/5 agonist dihydroxyphenylglycine
given intracerebroventricularly increased [3H]IP for-
mation by approximately 50% in the frontal cortex. DOI
(2 mg/kg, i.p.) was as effective as dihydroxyphenylgly-
cine in stimulating [3H]IP in the frontal cortex. The
effect of DOI on [3H]IP formation was abolished by
pretreatment with 5 mg/kg ketanserin, indicating an
action through 5-HT2A receptors. Pretreatment of mice
with the mGlu2/3 agonist LY379268 [(1R,4R,5S,6R)-4-
amino-2-oxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-4,6-dicarboxylic acid]
(10 mg/kg, i.p.) 5 minutes before DOI reduced stimulation
of PI hydrolysis, indicating that mGlu2/3 receptor agonists
selectively inhibit 5-HT2A receptor–mediated PI hydroly-
sis; this effect was blocked by the mGlu2/3 antagonist
LY341495.
LY566332
[N-(49-cyano-biphenyl-3-yl)-N-(3-
pyridinylmethyl)-ethanesulfonamide hydrochloride], an
mGlu2 positive allosteric modulator also attenuated
DOI-stimulated PI hydrolysis when combined with a
subthreshold dose of LY379268. Coadministration of the
mGlu2/3 agonist LY379268 with the mGlu2/3 antagonist
LY341495 blocked the effect of LY379268. These investi-
gators also used mGlu2(2/2), mGlu3(2/2), and double-KO
mGlu2(2/2)/mGlu3(2/2) mice. None of the mGlu2/3 ligands
had any effect on PI hydrolysis in the absence of DOI.
In WT, mGlu2/3(2/2), and mGlu3(2/2) mice, LY379268
reduced DOI-stimulated levels of PI hydrolysis to a similar
extent, but it did not reduce DOI-stimulated PI hydrolysis
in the cortex of the double mGlu2(2/2)/mGlu3(2/2) mice.
Local intracortical injection of LY379268 attenuated DOI-
stimulated PI hydrolysis in the ipsilateral frontal cortex to
an extent similar to that seen in mice after systemic injec-
tion of LY379268. DOI (2 mg/kg) or LY379268 (10 mg/kg)
increased phosphorylated ERK1/2 by approximately
50% in the frontal cortex, but no increase in ERK1/2
phosphorylation was seen in the mouse cortex when mice
were treated with the combination of DOI and LY379268.
In cortical slices, however, the mGlu2/3 agonist LY379268
amplified DOI-stimulated PI hydrolysis, and this effect
was blocked by the mGlu5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-
(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP). The authors propose
that the slice preparation may unmask an mGlu2/3
interaction with mGlu5 receptors, which can confound
data obtained with LY379268 and DOI, indicating that
cortical slice preparations are not appropriate for the
study of 5-HT2A and mGlu2/3 receptor interactions. Their
findings suggest that in frontal cortex mGlu2/3 receptors
negatively regulate the Gq phospholipase C3 pathway that
is activated by 5-HT2A receptors.
Wischhof et al. (2011) examined interactions between
5-HT2A and mGlu2/3 receptors in the orbitofrontal
cortex (OFC) and mPFC with respect to impulsive
choice and impulsive action in Lister Hooded rats.
Impulsive choice was assessed in rats trained in a
delay-discounting T-maze task, after bilateral infra-
OFC
infusions
of
DOI
or
the
mGlu2/3
agonist
LY379268. In a second group of rats trained in the
five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), impul-
sive action was assessed after bilateral intra-mPFC
infusions of DOI and LY379268. Intra-OFC DOI in-
creased impulsive choice, an effect that was blocked by
LY379268. LY379268 had no effect on choice when
given alone. Impulsive over-responding in the 5CSRTT
was observed after intra-mPFC DOI, an effect that was
attenuated by coinjection of both DOI and LY379268.
Their results indicate that 5-HT2A receptors in the OFC
and mPFC are differentially involved in the regulation
of impulsive choice and impulsive actions.
Wischhof and Koch (2012) followed up on their earlier
study by further examination of the interactions be-
tween the 5-HT2A and mGlu2/3 receptors involved in
impulse control. Hooded Lister rats were trained in the
5-CSRTT and treated with DOI and/or the mGlu2/3
agonist LY379268. Drug-induced changes in neuronal
activity were measured by c-fos immunoreactivity.
Colocalization of c-fos and GABAergic markers was
detected by double immunofluorescence labeling. Im-
pulsive over-responding induced by DOI was reduced in
animals pretreated with LY379268, whereas LY379268
had no effect by itself on 5-CSRTT performance. DOI
treatment led to increased c-fos immunoreactivity in the
frontocortical and limbic brain areas, an effect that was
blocked by pretreatment with LY379268. Double im-
munofluorescence labeling revealed colocalization of
DOI-elicited c-fos with glutamate decarboxylase
GAD67–positive GABAergic cells lacking parvalbumin,
whereas LY379268 increased c-fos immunoreactivity in
both GABAergic and non-GABAergic cells. They con-
clude that impulsivity may possibly be due to a primary
increase in glutamatergic transmission that is medi-
ated by 5-HT2A receptor activation.
The selective mGlu2/3 agonist LY379268 also atten-
uated the DOI-induced increase in c-fos mRNA in rat
292
Nichols
 mPFC slices (Zhai et al., 2003). DOI enhanced the
amplitude of the complex EPSP evoked in pyramidal
neurons by 30%, an effect that was blocked by
LY379268, demonstrating that excitatory glutamater-
gic responses of prefrontal cortical pyramidal neurons
are positively and negatively modulated by agonists at
5-HT2A and mGlu2/3 receptors, respectively.
Applying these approaches to the mouse, the selective
mGlu2/3 agonists LY379268 and LY354740 suppressed
the increased frequency of spontaneous EPSPs induced
by bath-applied DOI in layer V pyramidal cells,
recorded in slices of mouse medial frontal cortex
(Kłodzinska et al., 2002). These two mGlu2/3 agonists
also inhibited mouse head twitches induced by DOI.
Using a variety of different techniques, Béïque et al.
(2007) challenged the hypothesis that activation of
5-HT2A receptors led to the production of a retrograde
transmitter, which resulted in release of glutamate
from thalamocortical afferents. In one experiment, they
transfected cortical pyramidal cells with a construct
coding for the C-terminal portion of PLCb1, which acts
as a dominant negative to suppress Gaq/11 signaling.
The 5-HT2A agonist AMS induced a small inward
current in nontransfected cells, but not in neighboring
neurons transfected with PLCb-ct. The investigators
reasoned that if postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptor signaling
induces glutamate release from presynaptic terminals,
then inhibition of postsynaptic 5-HT2A signaling should
also inhibit the ability of the cells to increase sEPSCs.
They found, however, that the ability of AMS to increase
frequency of sEPSCs was no different between control
cells and those transfected with PLCb-ct.
Béïque et al. (2007) then examined prefrontal cortical
neurons from 5-HT2A KO mice. Reasoning that if 5-
HT2A signaling led to an increase in sEPSC by release of
a retrograde transmitter, transfection of a cell with the
5-HT2A receptor should rescue the ability of AMS to
increase sEPSCs only in cells where 5-HT2A receptors
were expressed. AMS did not induce an inward current
in control (nontransfected cells) but elicited an inward
current in neighboring neurons transfected with the
5-HT2A receptor. The authors found that expression of
5-HT2A receptors in pyramidal cells from 5-HT2A KO
mice rescued the ability of 5-HT2A receptors to signal an
inward current but not the ability to increase sEPSC
frequency. Thus, these results failed to support the
retrograde message hypothesis. In another experiment,
they used GTPgS, a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, to
render G protein–mediated responses irreversible.
AMS induced a small inward current that recovered
on agonist removal from control cells, as well as an
irreversible inward current in cells loaded with GTPgS.
Yet AMS induced comparable increases in sEPSCs in
both control and GTPgS-loaded neurons. Importantly,
however, the sEPSC increases for both types of cells
recovered after agonist removal, something that would
not be expected in cells with irreversible signal
production by GTPgS. These experiments were very
strong evidence that 5-HT2A receptor signaling was not
generating a retrograde messenger.
However, in current-clamp recordings in acute rat
PFC slices, Béïque et al. (2007) noticed a subpopulation
of large neurons in deep layers that was highly sensitive
to 5-HT and that responded with strong membrane
depolarizations capable of initiating spiking activity.
Approximately one-third of the largest cells were ex-
cited by 10–30 mM 5-HT. Thus, their results indi-
cated that within the cortex, there is a subpopulation
of 5-HT2A–expressing cells that when excited by a
5-HT2A agonist leads to increases in the frequency of
sEPSCs in layer V pyramidal neurons. Finally, they
note earlier work by Marek and Aghajanian (1998a),
who showed that m-opioid agonists abolished the ability
of 5-HT to increase sEPSC activity and who also
suggested that there was possibly a subcortical source
for afferents on which 5-HT2 receptors could induce
glutamate release. Thus, Béïque et al. (2007) carried out
current-clamp recordings from the deep large cells they
had identified and found that the selective m-opioid
agonist D-Ala2, N-MePhe4, Gly-ol]-enkephalin, (DAMGO)
DAMGO completely blocked the ability of AMS to de-
polarize and excite these neurons. Thus, this subpopula-
tion of cells in deep layers of the cortex that are very
sensitive to 5-HT2A agonists also expresses m-opioid
receptors. Taken together, their results indicate that the
increased sEPSC activity seen in PFC layer V pyramidal
neurons in response to 5-HT2A receptor stimulation results
from excitation of a subpopulation of pyramidal cells in the
deep layers of the PFC, and not through activation of
thalamocortical axon terminals by a retrograde messen-
ger. Therefore, 5-HT2A receptors in the PFC enhance
overall excitability of the PFC network by regulating the
properties of a key subpopulation of pyramidal neurons.
Much of the work on neuronal effects of psychedelics
has been obtained from single cell recordings from brain
slices, which do not represent an intact and functioning
cortex. The neocortex is constantly active in vivo, as
cortical and subcortical networks generate rhythmic
patterns of activity at a variety of frequencies (Steriade
et al., 1993). The propagation and synchronization of
slow cortical oscillations depends at least in part on
corticocortical connections and is proposed to be gener-
ated by recurrent excitation among large networks of
cortical neurons. Unfortunately, no one has yet exam-
ined the effect of hallucinogens on spontaneous rhyth-
mic activity in cortical circuits, experiments that would
likely provide important new data. For example, Shu
et al. (2003) demonstrated that operation of local
cortical circuits could generate activity that exhibited
a proportional increase in feedback excitation and
inhibition, keeping the network in relative balance. It
would be most interesting to carry out a similar
experiment, but with the addition of DOI or LSD to
observe the effect on cortical circuit activity.
Psychedelics
293
 All of the in vitro electrophysiological studies of
cortical slices discussed in this review appear to have
employed a “standard” and essentially identical slice
bath
composition.
Sanchez-Vives
and
McCormick
(2000) noted that when ferret prefrontal cortical slices
are maintained in vitro in the traditional bathing
medium, no spontaneous rhythmic activity is observed.
By contrast, when these investigators used a bath
solution with an ionic composition that closely mim-
icked brain interstitial fluid, spontaneous rhythmic
oscillations appeared that could be continuously main-
tained and were nearly identical to those observed in
vivo. Slow oscillation was most robust and occurred first
in or near cortical layer V, after a short delay by activity
in deeper layers. The activity maximum in layer V was
always larger and persisted longer than in any other
layers and seemed to be initiated in layer V as an
excitatory interaction between pyramidal neurons that
propagated through the neocortex. These workers sug-
gest that the basic operation of cortical networks is the
generation of self-maintained depolarized states that
are tightly regulated through interaction with local
GABA/GABAergic neurons and intrinsic membrane
conductances. They suggest that the ability of cortical
networks to generate persistent and recurring activities
even in the absence of ongoing subcortical inputs may be
a process that underlies perceptual influences on
sensory information processing.
Most recently, Nichols and Martin (2015) discovered a
subpopulation of cortical cells that are activated by the
5-HT2A receptor agonist DOI, and this subpopulation
may represent the cells described by Béïque et al.
(2007). Nichols and Martin (2015) found that only about
3%–5% of total cortical cells were activated by DOI but
the neurons within this subpopulation had a 10-fold
higher expression of 5-HT2A receptor mRNA than the
nonactivated neuronal population. This activated cel-
lular subpopulation included pyramidal neurons, inter-
neurons, glia, and astrocytes. High levels of both 5-HT2A
receptor protein expression and cellular activation were
observed in the claustrum, where nearly one-half of the
neurons were activated by DOI. Furthermore, Nichols
and Martin (2015) reported that DOI activated only
subsets of inhibitory GABA interneurons, which included
somatostatin and parvalbumin GABA interneurons. The
reader is directed to the section in this review on the
claustrum, which demonstrates that the claustrum would
be a logical target for activation by psychedelics, particu-
larly because it is involved in corticocortical interactions.
There is also extensive evidence for the interaction
of glutamate systems in serotonin 5-HT2A receptor–
mediated behaviors. For example, both competitive
and noncompetitive NMDA antagonists given intra-
cerebroventricularly were able to potentiate the HTR in
mice produced by a subsequent intracerebroventricular
injection of 5-HT, providing the first evidence of gluta-
matergic modulation of serotonergic function in intact
mice (Kim et al., 1998). Competitive and noncompetitive
NMDA receptor antagonists also markedly enhanced
the 5-HT–induced HTR in mice that had been treated
with p-chlorophenylalanine to deplete endogenous se-
rotonin (Kim et al., 1999).
In particular, data indicate that group II mGluR
agonists can counteract the effects of psychedelic
5-HT2A agonists. For example, DOI-induced rat head
shakes mediated by 5-HT2A receptor activation were
enhanced by pretreatment with either competitive or
noncompetitive NMDA antagonists (Dall’Olio et al.,
1999). Preadministration of the mGlu2/3 receptor ago-
nist LY354740 attenuated the frequency of DOI-
induced head shakes in rats, whereas administration
of the selective mGlu2/3 antagonist LY341495 potenti-
ated DOI-induced head shakes in rats (Gewirtz and
Marek, 2000). As noted above, DOI-induced head
twitches in mice were inhibited in a dose-dependent
manner by the selective mGlu2/3 agonists LY354740
and LY379268 (Kłodzinska et al., 2002). This action is
presumably due to a presynaptic effect on glutamate
neurons, in which mGlu2/3 agonists suppress gluta-
mate release and antagonists block the presynaptic
autoreceptor agonist effect of endogenously released
glutamate (Conn and Pin, 1997).
In a study by Winter et al. (2000a), rats were trained
in a two-lever fixed ratio (FR) 10 schedule of reinforce-
ment to discriminate saline from a training dose of 0.6
mg/kg DOM. Pretreatment of the trained rats with PCP,
an NMDA antagonist, dramatically shifted the dose-
response curve leftward. When a dose of 0.1 mg/kg DOM
was administered, rats emitted only 32% DOM-
appropriate responding. Yet when combined with a
range of doses of the noncompetitive NMDA antagonists
PCP, dizocilpine, or ketamine, DOM-appropriate lever
selection was increased to 73%, 84%, and 79%, re-
spectively. Consistent with other studies, the data show
that the stimulus effects of phenethylamine hallucino-
gens are potentiated by pretreatment with noncompet-
itive NMDA antagonists.
Using a two-lever FR10 food-reinforced drug discrim-
ination task, the stimulus effect of LSD was enhanced
by pretreatment with both the mGlu2/3 antagonist
LY341495 and the NMDA antagonist PCP. Stimulus
control by LSD was significantly but incompletely
blocked by the mGlu2/3 agonist LY379268, whereas
the 5-HT2A antagonists pirenperone and M100907
completely
antagonized
stimulus
control
by
LSD
(Winter et al., 2004). By contrast, the mGlu2/3 antag-
onist LY341495 had no effect on stimulus control by
PCP, and the training dose of PCP was significantly,
but incompletely, antagonized by the mGlu2/3 agonist
LY379268.
Although the in vivo functional interaction between
5-HT2A receptors and mGlu2 receptors is now widely
accepted, González-Maeso et al. (2008) proposed that
the 5-HT2A receptor formed a heterodimer with the
294
Nichols
 mGlu2 receptor and identified this complex as a possi-
ble site of action for hallucinogenic drugs. They reported
that the 5-HT2A and mGlu2 receptors directly interact
in recombinant cell lines and are present in the same
neuronal cells in culture. Their results indicated that
this heterodimeric complex enhanced Gai activation by
psychedelic 5-HT2A agonists, a signaling event proposed to
be involved in hallucinogen-specific signaling (González-
Maeso et al., 2007). Fribourg et al. (2011) further extended
the original findings presented by González-Maeso et al.
(2008).
Delille et al. (2012) subsequently coexpressed mGlu2
receptors in an inducible manner in a constitutive 5-HT2A
background in HEK-293 cells. They determined the
reciprocal influence of the two receptors on receptor
expression and measured intracellular Ca+2 as well as
cAMP levels after stimulation with agonists, antagonists,
psychedelics, and positive allosteric modulators. The
formation of the 5-HT2A–mGlu2 heterocomplex did not
result in functional cross-talk. In addition, psychedelic
5-HT2A agonists had no effect on Gai-mediated signaling.
The results of Delille et al. (2012) indicate that the
functional interaction of mGlu2 and 5-HT2A receptors
may not be mediated by heterodimer interaction.
In a subsequent report, Delille et al. (2013) reviewed
the evidence for a heterodimer presented by González-
Maeso et al. (2008), including their report of coimmu-
noprecipitation of 5-HT2A and mGlu2 receptors, data
from bioluminescence resonance energy transfer as-
says, and many other detailed data. Delille et al.
(2013) note that formation of a heterodimer in a
recombinant system is not proof for its occurrence in
vivo. They further point out that the preponderance of
evidence suggests that mGlu2 receptors are expressed
presynaptically, whereas the 5-HT2A receptor is pre-
dominantly expressed postsynaptically. Delille et al.
(2013) also point out that most anatomic data indicate
that the predominant fraction of 5-HT2A and mGlu2
receptors is expressed in different compartments, soma-
todendritic (postsynaptic) or axons (presynaptic), re-
spectively. Furthermore, an allosteric interaction of
5-HT2A and mGlu2 receptors has not been indepen-
dently replicated in any other laboratory. They conclude
that until ultrastructural studies can be completed, the
physiologic relevance of a 5-HT2A–mGlu2 heterodimer
“remains questionable.”
E. A Role for g-Aminobutyric Acid
Although the focus of most research on amino acid
neurotransmitters in the frontal cortex has been on
glutamate, GABA interneurons play an important role.
Using in vivo microdialysis in the rat mPFC, adminis-
tration of DOI through the perfusion probe led to a
significant dose-dependent increase in extracellular
GABA (Abi-Saab et al., 1999). Double-labeling immu-
nohistochemical examination of cortical cells after
systemic administration of DOI showed a significant
increase in the number of interneurons expressing both
GAD and fos-like immunoreactivity. These authors
concluded that 5-HT regulates cortical GABA interneu-
rons, an effect similar to that seen in piriform cortex
interneurons (Marek and Aghajanian, 1994). In the rat
frontal cortex, 5-HT–enhanced spontaneous inhibitory
postsynaptic potentials in pyramidal cells can be pro-
duced through activation of 5-HT2A receptors located on
GABAergic interneurons (Zhou and Hablitz, 1999).
Thus, activation of 5-HT2A receptors in the cortex can
produce both excitation and a feed-forward inhibition of
cortical pyramidal cells.
F. Possible Role of Other Receptors
Ray (2010) reported on receptor screening of 25 hal-
lucinogens and analogs by the National Institute of
Mental Health Psychoactive Drug Screening Program,
with affinities of 10 additional drugs taken from the
literature. The 35 drugs of the study had very diverse
patterns of interaction, which may underlie some of the
qualitative psychopharmacological differences between
the drugs. Functional effects of the various compounds
were not studied, however, which would have strength-
ened the conclusions and given more detailed insight
into the possible relevance of receptors where some of
the tested drugs had relatively high affinity.
The most consistent finding for involvement of other
receptors in the actions of psychedelics is the 5-HT1A
receptor. That is particularly true for tryptamines and
LSD, which generally have significant affinity and
functional potency at this receptor. It is known that
5-HT1A receptors are colocalized with 5-HT2A receptors
on cortical pyramidal cells (Martín-Ruiz et al., 2001),
where the two receptor types have opposing functional
effects (Araneda and Andrade, 1991). In addition to
functioning as somatodendritic autoreceptors in the
raphe, postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors are also localized
in a number of other important brain regions. Their
highest density is found in limbic regions of the brain
such as the hippocampus (Hamon et al., 1990), areas
where emotion and affect would be modified by agonist
and antagonist drug interactions. Autoradiographic
studies demonstrated the presence of 5-HT1A receptors
in layer V of the rat PFC (Glaser et al., 1985; Pazos and
Palacios, 1985), and neurons in the human neocortex
contain mRNA for the 5-HT1A receptor, with pyramidal
cells in layer III more heavily labeled than those in layer
V (Burnet et al., 1995).
LSD and potent tryptamine hallucinogens such as
5-MeO-DMT and psilocin all have high affinity for
5-HT1A receptors (McKenna et al., 1990; Blair et al.,
2000). LSD is a full agonist at central 5-HT1A receptors
linked to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (De Vivo and
Maayani, 1986). Deliganis et al. (1991) reported that
DMT affinity for 5-HT1A receptors (Ki = 130 nM), was
reduced (Ki = 464 nM) by addition of guanyl nucleotides,
suggesting that DMT was an agonist. This hypothesis
Psychedelics
295
 was
confirmed
by
their
finding
that
DMT
was
equally efficacious to the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT
[7-(dipropylamino)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-ol]
in inhibiting forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation in
rat hippocampal homogenate. DMT also enhances the
acoustic startle response (ASR) in rats (Davis and
Sheard, 1974), an effect now attributed to 5-HT1A
receptor activation (Nanry and Tilson, 1989). The
closely related N,N-diethyltryptamine is also a full
agonist in inhibiting forskolin-stimulated cAMP pro-
duction in cloned human 5-HT1A receptors expressed in
CHO cells (Blair et al., 2000). Similarly, 5-MeO-DMT is
a full agonist at 5-HT1A receptors (Dumuis et al., 1988;
Blair et al., 2000). No clinical research has yet identified
a 5-HT1A receptor–mediated component of action for
any psychedelic, but it would seem surprising if the
psychopharmacology of psychedelics was not affected to
some extent when the molecule had a potent 5-HT1A
agonist effect, given the brain areas that express high
levels of this receptor.
The evidence for involvement of 5-HT1A receptors in
the behavioral actions of psychedelics has been gleaned
primarily from animal studies. Halberstadt and Geyer
(2011) reviewed the evidence and concluded that the
5-HT1A receptor can play an important role in the
behavioral effects of tryptamine-type psychedelics. Sev-
eral examples illustrating the importance of 5-HT1A
receptor activation in the action of tryptamine halluci-
nogens are provided in the later sections of this review
on animal models, but two examples are provided now
to illustrate how these conclusions were developed.
As one illustration, Fantegrossi et al. (2008b) exam-
ined the effects of N,N-dipropyltryptamine (DPT) in the
mouse HTR and in rat drug discrimination assays. Rats
were trained to discriminate LSD, psilocybin, or MDMA
from saline; in addition, one group of rats was trained to
discriminate DPT from saline. The paradigm was a two-
choice FR10, with diluted sweetened condensed milk as
the reinforcer. In the mouse, DPT elicited the HTR in a
dose-dependent fashion, producing a maximum of 15
twitches at 3 mg/kg. Pretreatment with 1 mg/kg of the
5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 gave a 3-fold right-
ward shift in the dose-response curve, indicating com-
petitive antagonism at the 5-HT1A receptor. A 10-mg/kg
dose of DPT produced a greater HTR, but a 3-mg/kg dose
of WAY-100635 gave no greater antagonism than the
1-mg/kg dose. Pretreatment with 0.1 mg/kg of the
5-HT2A–selective antagonist M100907, however, nearly
abolished the HTR. In drug discrimination studies in
LSD-trained rats, the training stimulus generalized to
DPT
with
approximately
60%
LSD-appropriate
responding at the 3-mg/kg dose of DPT. Pretreatment
with 0.3 mg/kg WAY-100635 produced a parallel right-
ward shift in the DPT dose-effect curve, but 0.1 mg/kg
M100907 completely blocked the LSD-like discrimi-
native stimulus effects of 1.5 or 3.0 mg/kg DPT. In
psilocybin-trained rats, DPT gave an intermediate
degree of generalization (55%) at a dose of 3 mg/kg.
Neither 0.3 mg/kg WAY-100635 nor 0.1 mg/kg M100907
affected the psilocybin-like discriminative effects of
DPT, but surprisingly, a combination of the two antag-
onists completed abolished the stimulus effects of DPT.
DPT dose-dependently and fully substituted in MDMA-
trained rats, and pretreatment with 0.3 mg/kg WAY-
100635 had no effect on the discrimination. By contrast,
0.1 mg/kg M100907 completely blocked the MDMA-like
stimulus properties of DPT.
Fantegrossi et al. (2008b) also trained rats to dis-
criminate 1.5 mg/kg DPT from saline. The discrimina-
tive stimulus effects of DPT were not affected by prior
treatment with WAY-100635, but they were signifi-
cantly attenuated by pretreatment with 0.1 mg/kg
M100907. A combination of the two antagonists again
essentially abolished the stimulus effects of DPT. Both
the mouse HTR and drug discrimination data from this
study indicate that DPT has potent effects as a 5-HT2A
agonist, but that some component of the mouse HTR is
mediated by the 5-HT1A receptor. With respect to the
drug discrimination assays, the authors suggest that
the 5-HT1A–mediated components of the stimulus prop-
erties of DPT may be more salient at lower doses,
whereas the stimulus properties resulting from activa-
tion of the 5-HT2A receptor are more prominent at
higher doses of DPT.
A second example is work by Halberstadt et al.
(2011a), who compared the effects of psilocin with those
of 1-methypsilocin and 5-MeO-DMT in mice using the
BPM and the mouse HTR. 1-Methylpsilocin is a de-
rivative of psilocin that is reported to act as a selective
5-HT2C receptor agonist (Sard et al., 2005). Psilocin at
doses of 0.6–2.4 mg/kg produced an inverted U-shaped
dose-response curve for the HTR. In 5-HT2A KO mice,
however, psilocin did not produce the HTR. The HTR
also was produced by 1-methylpsilocin, which was only
about one-fourth the potency of psilocin, and again, the
HTR was absent for 1-methylpsilocin in 5-HT2A KO
mice. The HTR was also produced by 5-MeO-DMT at 10
and 20 mg/kg. As with psilocin and 1-methylpsilocin,
5-MeO-DMT did not induce the HTR in 5-HT2A KO
mice. In the BPM, 4.8 mg/kg psilocin was maximally
effective in significantly reducing locomotor activity, yet
hole poking, rearing, and center duration were signifi-
cantly reduced at doses # 1.2 mg/kg, a dose that had no
effect on locomotor activity. Pretreatment with the
5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 (0.5 mg/kg) completely
blocked the ability of psilocin to reduce locomotor activity.
WAY-100635 partially blocked the ability of psilocin to
reduce hole-poking behavior but failed to reverse the
reduced rearing behavior induced by psilocin.
In the study by Halberstadt et al. (2011a), the response
to psilocin was not affected by deletion of the 5-HT2A
receptor gene. The 5-HT2C antagonist SB-242084
(6-chloro-5-methyl-N-{6-[(2-methylpyridin-3-yl)oxy]pyridin-
3-yl}indoline-1-carboxamide) slightly potentiated the
296
Nichols
 ability of psilocin to reduce motor activity but had no
effect on rearing, hole pokes, or center duration. Doses
of 10 or 20 mg/kg 5-MeO-DMT also reduced distance
traveled in the BPM, with the larger dose having a
more prolonged effect. Both doses of 5-MeO-DMT also
significantly reduced hole pokes throughout the test.
Pretreatment with 0.5 mg/kg WAY-100635 signifi-
cantly blocked the distance traveled by mice given
5-MeO-DMT, similar to psilocin. Also like psilocin,
pretreatment with SB-242084 potentiated the effects
of 5-MeO-DMT in reducing distance traveled. Halber-
stadt et al. (2011a) concluded that the reduction in
locomotor activity, investigatory behavior, and center
duration produced by psilocin were all mediated by the
5-HT1A receptor because of the blockade of these
effects by WAY-100635 and the fact that neither the
5-HT2C antagonist SB-242084 nor 5-HT2A receptor
gene deletion had any effect on these behaviors. The
effects of 5-MeO-DMT on locomotor activity were also
blocked by WAY-100635. By contrast, 1-methylpsilocin
had no effect on locomotor activity in the BPM, despite the
fact that it produced the HTR. These findings are further
evidence that the 5-HT1A receptor can play a role in the
behavioral effects of indoleamine-type psychedelics.
Is the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor involved in the
actions of psychedelics? All known psychedelics are
agonists at both the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. The
most salient behaviors induced in rodents by psyche-
delics generally have been shown due to activation of
the 5-HT2A receptor. Nevertheless, higher doses of
particular psychedelics may lead to activation of the
5-HT2C receptor, which often functionally opposes the
effects of 5-HT2A receptor activation. For example, low
doses of DOI increase locomotor activity in mice,
whereas higher doses attenuate it, leading to an
inverted U type of dose-response curve. The same
phenomenon can be observed in the mouse HTR. This
effect has been attributed to activation of 5-HT2A
receptors at low doses, but 5-HT2C receptor agonist
activity at higher doses (Halberstadt et al., 2009). This
interaction is explored more fully in the section in this
review on the use of animal models.
Although it is believed that dopaminergic systems are
not directly involved in the mechanism of action of
classic serotonergic hallucinogens, LSD is a unique
agent with known high affinity and agonist activity
at dopamine receptors (e.g., see Watts et al., 1995).
Marona-Lewicka et al. (2005) first demonstrated that
the effect of LSD as a training stimulus occurs in two
temporal phases. When rats are trained to discriminate
0.08 mg/kg LSD, given 30 minutes prior to training
(LSD30 rats), the stimulus generalizes to classic psy-
chedelics and is blocked by 5-HT2A receptor antagonists.
If, however, LSD (0.16 mg/kg) is administered 90
minutes prior to training (LSD90 rats), the stimulus is
no longer blocked by 5-HT2A antagonists, does not
generalize to classic psychedelics, and is blocked by
dopamine D2-like antagonists. In rats trained to dis-
criminate LSD administered 90 minutes prior to train-
ing, the cue generalized to the dopamine D2-like
agonists apomorphine, N-propyldihydrexidine, and qui-
nelorane. Although a slightly larger dose of LSD is
required to maintain the salience of the LSD cue out to
90 minutes, if the higher dose of LSD is administered 30
minutes prior to training, the cue is still found to be
mediated by 5-HT2A receptor activation. Therefore, the
time between administration of LSD and training
determines the nature of the discriminative cue.
In a subsequent study, Marona-Lewicka and Nichols
(2007) compared the stimulus effects of LSD adminis-
tered either 30 or 90 minutes prior to training and
employed a number of different agonist and antagonist
ligands to elucidate the nature of the cues. Mescaline,
DMT, N,N-diethyltryptamine, and psilocin fully
substituted in LSD30 rats but produced only saline-
appropriate responding in LSD90 rats. The highly
selective 5-HT2A antagonist MDL11939 [a-phenyl-1-
(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidine
methanol]
blocked
the
LSD30 cue, but not the LSD90 cue, confirming that
activation of the 5-HT2A receptor is not essential for the
delayed effect of LSD. The 5-HT1A antagonist/D4 ago-
nist WAY-100635 did not block the LSD-90 cue, but
surprisingly fully substituted in LSD90 rats. Neverthe-
less, earlier studies had shown that WAY 100635 had
potent dopamine D4 agonist properties, and that rats
could be trained to discriminate the dopamine D4
agonist effect of WAY-100635 from saline (Chemel
et al., 2006; Marona-Lewicka and Nichols, 2009).
Thus, in a third study, Marona-Lewicka et al. (2009)
examined whether the LSD90 cue resulted from dopa-
mine D4 receptor activation. Again, LSD30 and LSD90
rats were tested and compared with DOI-trained rats.
Combinations were tested of training drugs with the
5-HT1A antagonist/D4 agonist WAY-100635, the selec-
tive D4 antagonists L-745,870 [3-[[4-(4-chlorophenyl)
piperazin-1-yl]methyl]-1-1H-pyrollo[2,3-b]pyridine]
and
A-381393 [2-[4-(3,4-dimethylphenlyl)piperazin-1-ylmethyl]-
1H benzoimidazole], the selective D4 agonist ABT-724 [2-[(4-
pyridin-2-ylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl]-1H-benzimidazole)], and
the atypical antipsychotic drugs clozapine and olanza-
pine. WAY-100635 produced full substitution in LSD90
rats, only partial substitution in LSD30 rats, and saline-
appropriate responding in DOI-trained rats. ABT-724
partially mimicked the LSD30 and LSD90 cues but
produced no substitution in DOI-trained rats. In combi-
nation tests, ABT-724 potently enhanced the LSD90 cue;
the D4 antagonists significantly attenuated the LSD cues
but had no effect on the DOI cue. It was concluded that
dopamine D4 receptor activation plays a key role in the
discriminative stimulus properties of LSD when admin-
istered to rats 90 minutes prior to training but is not
involved in the cue produced by DOI. Furthermore,
functional tests in human embryonic kidney cells stably
expressing the human D4.4 receptor demonstrated that
Psychedelics
297
 LSD was a full agonist with an EC50 virtually identical
to the standard D2-like agonist quinpirole (11 versus
9.6 nM, respectively) for inhibiting forskolin-stimulated
cAMP accumulation.
The significance of this delayed dopamine D4-
mediated pharmacology of LSD in rats remains unclear,
but Daniel X. Freedman first described the clinical effects
of LSD as occurring in two temporal phases: an early
“psychedelic” phase, followed by a later phase 4–6 hours
after LSD administration, and at times out to 10 hours,
where subjects reported “they had been at the least self-
centered, and usually suspicious, with ideas of reference
or even paranoid convictions” (Freedman, 1984). The
only other report to indicate that LSD had two phases of
action was the finding that LSD-induced spontaneous
behavioral effects in rats occurred in two phases, an
initial suppression of behavioral responding, followed
by a subsequent increase in locomotor activity that was
not observed with other serotonergic agonists (Mittman
and Geyer, 1991). Because of the limited number of
pretreatments employed in that study, one could not
clearly deduce a mechanistic basis for these different
effects. Nonetheless, the delayed increase in locomotor
activity that is peculiar to LSD would be consistent with
a
dopaminergic
action.
Although
the
dopaminergic
properties of LSD have been recognized for many years
(Nichols, 1976); also see references in Watts et al.,
1995), the significance of this dopaminergic action has
perhaps not been widely appreciated.
With Freedman’s (1984) comments in mind, it was
noted that the rats trained with 0.16 mg/kg LSD for
several months began to show increased hyperactivity,
irritability, and hyper-reactivity to external stimuli,
behavioral effects that had not been previously reported
by others who had used this training dose of LSD for
drug discrimination studies. Based on the dopaminergic
nature of the LSD90 cue, it was speculated that these
animals might manifest behaviors that resembled core
symptoms of schizophrenia. Thus, these animals were
further investigated by Marona-Lewicka et al. (2011) to
determine whether chronic treatment of rats with LSD
might represent a new animal model of schizophrenia.
Drug discrimination followed the methods described in
their earlier studies and used a two-lever FR10 food-
reinforced paradigm. A variety of different drugs were
used in combination tests and antagonism tests to
examine in more detail the differences between animals
trained with the lower 0.08 mg/kg LSD dose 30 minutes
prior to training (LSD30 rats), which did not lead to
long-term behavioral changes, and the animals trained
90 minutes after 0.16 mg/kg (LSD90 rats).
In separate experiments, groups of rats were given
either 0.08 or 0.16 mg/kg LSD every other day for 3
months. These rats did not receive drug discrimina-
tion training but were used for behavioral tests
and for analysis of mRNA isolated from the mPFC
1 month after cessation of LSD treatment. In the drug
discrimination
experiments,
M100907,
olanzapine,
and clozapine completely blocked the LSD30 cue, but
haloperidol produced only a slight 20% nonsignificant
inhibition of the cue. In LSD90 rats M100907 produced
a maximum of only 32% inhibition of the cue, but
ziprasidone, olanzapine, clozapine, and haloperidol
reduced drug-appropriate responding up to 80%.
The nonselective NMDA antagonists PCP, ketamine,
and MK-801 [(5R,10S)-(2)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-
dibenzo[a,d]cylcohepten-5,10-imine] were also tested in
both groups of rats, in both young and old (.12 months)
rats. MK-801 and PCP produced partial substitution in
both young and old LSD30 rats, with more than 50%
disruption at higher doses. Ketamine was recognized as
saline by some rats but produced behavioral disruption
at higher doses. In young LSD90 rats, all three NMDA
antagonists produced partial substitution (60%–71%);
however, in older rats (.12 months), all three NMDA
antagonists surprisingly produced full substitution
with little disruption at high doses.
Two weeks after ending the 3-month 0.16 mg/kg LSD
treatment, rats had significantly elevated locomotor
activity compared with saline-injected controls, which
was not blocked by M100907 but was blocked by
haloperidol and olanzapine. Rats also were hyper-
reflexive to external stimuli. One month after cessation
of 0.16 mg/kg LSD treatment, rats also had significantly
altered social behavior, with reduced sniffing, groom-
ing, and following and markedly enhanced aggressive
(boxing, kicking, wrestling) and exploratory (sniffing,
rearing, hole poking) behaviors. The preference for
sucrose solution in control rats was also lost in rats
chronically treated with 0.16 mg/kg LSD, indicating a
state of anhedonia in these rats. On the basis of these
results and their earlier studies, the authors suggest
that rats chronically treated with LSD may represent a
new animal model of psychosis, with the advantage that
the animals can be used long after the LSD treatment
has been ended.
Altered behaviors that persisted at full strength long
after LSD was discontinued (Marona-Lewicka et al.,
2011) suggested that long-term LSD administration in
rats permanently shifted brain neurochemistry and
gene expression from a normal to a pathologic state
resembling that observed in rodent models of schizo-
phrenia. To investigate how long-term LSD adminis-
tration affected gene expression in the brain, Martin
et al. (2014) performed RNA sequencing on RNA
isolated from the mPFC of rats 4 weeks after cessation
of a 90-day treatment protocol with LSD or saline. They
identified several hundred relatively low-magnitude
(,2-fold) but significant transcriptional changes in the
mPFC of LSD-treated animals long after drug admin-
istration ended. Functional clustering analysis indi-
cated that the altered genes were significantly
concentrated in pathways related to neurotransmis-
sion, synaptic plasticity, and metabolism (Martin et al.,
298
Nichols
 2014). Several unanticipated clusters of genes were
identified that included those involved in RNA process-
ing and endocrine function, with a significant enrich-
ment of altered transcripts that have been implicated in
schizophrenia by others, including genes for the dopa-
mine D1 and D2 receptors, brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF), receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-4
(ERBB4), and various NMDA and GABA receptor
subunits (see references in Martin et al., 2014).
Minuzzi et al. (2005) used [11C]raclopride PET in
living pig brain to examine the effects of LSD on
dopamine D2/3 receptor binding. They observed an
unusual progressive displacement of the PET ligand
that only reached a maximum 240 minutes after LSD
administration. The authors speculate that “This time
course seems consistent with the prolonged psychoac-
tive action of LSD in humans.” Optimal receptor
occupancy might be expected fairly quickly after in-
travenous LSD administration, however, not 4 hours
later. The authors also suggest that “…LSD might
evoke a serotonin 5-HT2 receptor–mediated sensitiza-
tion of dopamine D2/3 receptors,” a mechanism that also
has been offered to explain an enhanced behavioral
response to amphetamine after a 2- or 3-hour pre-
treatment with DOI or LSD (Marona-Lewicka and
Nichols, 1997). One might speculate that the initial
phase of pharmacology for LSD involves activation of
serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, and that this action leads to
a sensitization of dopaminergic systems in the CNS.
Then, the intrinsic dopaminergic effects of LSD would
become potentiated, leading to a delayed dopamine-
mediated action in the effect of LSD. It also seems
possible that one of the metabolites of LSD (e.g.,
13-hydroxyLSD; see Parli et al., 1978) might be a highly
potent dopaminergic agonist; thus far, no one has
studied the pharmacology of hydroxylated metabolites
of LSD.
Interestingly, Fontanilla et al. (2009) reported that
DMT bound to s-1 receptors and inhibited voltage-
gated sodium channels in both native cardiac myocytes
and heterologous cells expressing the s-1 receptor.
DMT reduced locomotor activity in WT mice, but not
in s-1 KO mice. Patch-clamp recordings in HEK-293
cells stably expressing the human cardiac Na+ channel
hNav1.5 showed that application of 100 mM DMT
inhibited the INa by 62%. The KD for DMT at s-1
receptors, however, was 14.75 mM. The authors con-
clude on the basis of this and other data in their report
that DMT may serve as an endogenous sigma receptor
ligand. Although that conclusion may be valid, the low
KD for DMT at the s-1 receptor, and the fact that only
trace amounts of DMT are apparently produced within
the body and are rapidly broken down by MAOs would
seem to argue that the relevance of s receptor activation
to the psychedelic effects of DMT is questionable, at best.
In addition to direct receptor effects, Cozzi et al.
(2009) have demonstrated that DMT, DPT, and N,N-
diisopropyltryptamine also inhibit the serotonin trans-
porter (SERT) in human platelets, with KI values of 4
mM, 8.88 mM, 0.59 mM, and 2.3 mM, respectively. They
also were inhibitors of rat vesicle monoamine trans-
porter 2 expressed in Sf9 cells, where they were
somewhat less potent. However, they were poor inhib-
itors of [3H]paroxetine binding to the SERT and of [3H]
dihydrotetrabenazine binding to vesicle monoamine
transporter 2. These high binding to uptake ratios were
taken to support the hypothesis that the studied
tryptamines were transporter substrates, rather than
uptake blockers. The authors suggest that as substrates
they might be accumulated within neurons and perhaps
function as releasable transmitters. Another possibility,
not considered by the investigators, is that these trypt-
amines might be taken up into serotonin neuron termi-
nals and might displace stored intraneuronal serotonin,
in a mechanism similar to a 5-HT releasing agent such as
MDMA. The release of stored serotonin would enhance
synaptic levels of 5-HT, potentially adding an additional
component to the pharmacology of certain tryptamines.
Nagai et al. (2007) studied the ability of a variety of
psychoactive drugs to block reuptake of dopamine,
5-HT, and NE into rat brain synaptosomes. Several
known psychedelic phenethylamines were studied, as
were selected tryptamines. They included DPT, one of
the drugs examined by Cozzi et al. (2009). The six
phenethylamines had very weak uptake inhibition
properties, with IC50 values ranging from 30 to 80 mM.
DPT had IC50 values for reuptake inhibition of dopa-
mine, 5-HT, and NE of 23 mM, 2.9 mM, and 9.1 mM,
respectively, somewhat less potent than those found by
Cozzi et al. (2009) using human platelets. The ability of
the compounds to induce release of stored monoamines
from rat brain synaptosomes also was studied. The six
phenethylamines were virtually inactive, as was DPT,
having no effect at 1024 M of the drug. These results
seem to suggest that, in general, effects of psychedelics
on monoamine reuptake and release may not be rele-
vant and that direct receptor actions remain most
important.
IV. Where Is the Serotonin 5-Hydroxytryptamine
2A Receptor Expressed?
To invoke a mechanism of action for psychedelics that
involves activation of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, it is
instructive to examine brain areas where that receptor
is highly expressed. One would expect to find high
receptor levels in key brain regions that are responsible
for sensory processing and cognition. The 5-HT2A re-
ceptor is in fact expressed in those very brain areas that
include, among others, the neocortex, thalamus, locus
coeruleus (LC), and ventral tegmental area (VTA), and
recognizing the functional importance of these brain
regions will help to understand the complex pharma-
cology of psychedelics.
Psychedelics
299
 A. Serotonin 5-Hydroxytryptamine 2A Receptor
Expression in the Cortex
The PFC is the executive area of the brain where
incoming sensory information and affective output from
the limbic areas converges, creating our sense of
awareness of our environment and being involved in
higher cognitive functions. The PFC in primates coor-
dinates actions such as complex cognitive and affective
functions, with many reciprocal fiber connections from
other neocortical areas, as well as with numerous
subcortical and limbic structures. The concept that
psychedelics would have their major site of action in
the cortex is certainly consistent with the powerful
psychoactive effects of these substances.
Early receptor mapping studies in rat brain using
autoradiography with tritiated antagonist ligands iden-
tified brain areas with high 5-HT2 receptor density
(Pazos et al., 1985). Highest binding was seen in the
claustrum, but with high expression also in all laminae
of the neocortex. The highest receptor density within
the cortex was localized to a continuous band that
included lamina IV and extended into lamina III,
depending on the area studied. In humans, PET with
N1-[11C]-methyl)-2-bromo-LSD revealed highest bind-
ing in the frontal and temporal cortices, lower expres-
sion
in
parietal
cortex
and
motor
regions,
with
intermediate levels in basal ganglia, and only low levels
in thalamus (Wong et al., 1987).
Pazos et al. (1987) examined 5-HT2 receptor distri-
bution in the human brain using light microscopic
autoradiography with the 5-HT2A antagonist ligand
[3H]ketanserin. A heterogeneous distribution of 5-HT2
receptor densities was observed, with high expression
localized over layers III and V of several cortical areas,
including the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital
lobes, the anterogenual cortex, and the entorhinal area.
Their findings were consistent with the observation of a
dense band of 5-HT2 receptors in upper cortical layer V
in register with a dense plexus of fine 5-HT axons (Blue
et al., 1988). A mRNA in situ hybridization study of
human cortex demonstrated the 5-HT2A receptor on
both pyramidal and nonpyramidal cells (Burnet et al.,
1995).
Autoradiography in the rat brain using R-(2)-[125I]
DOI revealed highest binding in the claustrum and the
frontal cortex (McKenna and Saavedra, 1987). Lower
expression was observed in the caudate, nucleus accum-
bens, and olfactory tubercle. Other autoradiographic
and in situ hybridization studies have observed high
densities of 5-HT2A receptors and transcripts in the
cortex (Blue et al., 1988; Mengod et al., 1990; Wright
et al., 1995).
Séguéla et al. (1989) found that cortical synaptic 5-HT
terminals always made asymmetric junctions exclu-
sively located on dendritic spines and shafts, expressed
more frequently on spines in the deep frontal and the
upper occipital cortex. They reported that cortical 5-HT
innervation in the adult rat was predominantly (approx-
imately 60%) nonjunctional throughout the neocortex.
Willins et al. (1997), using 5-HT2A receptor anti-
bodies, reported dense 5-HT2A receptor expression in
apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in the rat cortex,
with most of the 5-HT2A–like immunoreactivity associ-
ated with the plasma membrane. A small amount of
labeling was also seen on cortical interneurons. Local-
ization of 5-HT2A receptors on cortical pyramidal cells is
consistent with electrophysiological data suggesting
that psychedelics have excitatory effects on projection
neurons in the neocortex (Araneda and Andrade, 1991;
Ashby et al., 1994). Furthermore, microiontophoresis of
serotonin in “hot spots” near the border of layers I/II and
IV/Va induced EPSC frequency increases in layer V
pyramidal cells (Aghajanian and Marek, 1997), an area
with dense 5-HT2A receptor expression. This finding is
consistent with the hypothesis that the most potent 5-
HT2A receptor–mediated cortical actions of psychedelics
occur at hot spots on proximal apical dendritic shafts.
A later study of 5-HT2A receptor localization in the rat
cortex by Miner et al. (2003) employed immunoperox-
idase labeling to determine the localization of 5-HT2A
receptors in the middle layers of the rat PFC. Using a
polyclonal antibody, they found most 5-HT2A receptors
to be expressed on postsynaptic structures, predomi-
nantly on proximal and distal dendritic shafts, appar-
ently on both pyramidal and local circuit neurons. Most
often, Miner et al. (2003) observed that 5-HT2A recep-
tors were restricted to a particular area of the dendrite,
usually extrasynaptic regions apposed to unlabeled
dendrites. They reported that 73% of the immunopos-
itive sites were postsynaptic, and 58% of those were
on dendritic shafts, with 42% expressed in dendritic
spines. This study provided the first evidence of exten-
sive localization of 5-HT2A receptors to the heads and
necks of dendritic spines, and the findings were consis-
tent with those of Séguéla et al. (1989), who found that
synaptic serotonin terminals always made asymmetric
junctions exclusively found on dendritic spines and
shafts, appearing more frequently on spines than shafts
in the deep frontal and the upper occipital cortex. A
postsynaptic localization is also consistent with the
reports by Xia et al. (2003a,b), who demonstrated that
5-HT2A receptors interact with PSD-95, the major pro-
tein of postsynaptic densities in asymmetric synapses.
The finding by Miner et al. (2003) that a significant
fraction of 5-HT2A receptors were localized to extra-
synaptic portions of dendritic shafts suggests that
serotonin within the PFC may exhibit at least some of
its actions through volume transmission mechanisms
(e.g., see Agnati et al., 1995; Zoli et al., 1998). This
hypothesis is consistent with immunocytochemical
studies by Jansson et al. (2001), in which 5-HT2A
receptor labeling was located distal from 5-HT termi-
nals in other regions of rat cortex. Miner et al. (2003)
300
Nichols
 also found little evidence for significant presynaptic
5-HT2A receptor expression. Séguéla et al. (1989) esti-
mated that only about 38% of serotonin axons in the
cortex engaged in synaptic contact. Furthermore, sero-
tonin reuptake transporters are frequently located at
extrasynaptic sites in the PFC (Miner et al., 2000). On
the basis of their results as well as other data, Miner
et al. (2003) proposed that cortical 5-HT innervation is
primarily nonjunctional and that the entire cortical
volume may be reached by serotonin. They suggest that
some of the cortical actions of 5-HT may be constantly
exerted, with more or less efficacy at the various 5-HT
receptors, thus providing widespread global and/or
sustained influence in the neocortex.
Nevertheless, Miner et al. (2003) did identify a
significant 24% fraction of 5-HT2A receptor immunore-
active profiles that were presynaptic. The structures
were thin, were unmyelinated, rarely formed synaptic
contacts in single sections, and sometimes contained
dense-core vesicles, suggesting that they might be
monoaminergic axons. Miner et al. (2003) suggested
that these might include dopaminergic fibers, consis-
tent with a report by Pehek et al. (2001) that 5-HT2A
receptors may modulate cortical dopaminergic function.
Using double in situ hybridization to quantify mRNA
colocalization of the 5-HT2A receptor with the vesicular
glutamate transporter 1, and with the GABAergic
marker GAD65/67, and in parvalbumin and calbindin
GABAergic cell populations, de Almeida and Mengod
(2007) reported that 86%–100% of glutamatergic cells in
cortical layers II–V in both monkey and human brain
expressed 5-HT2A receptor mRNA. Layer VI had only
13%–31%
expression.
In
GABAergic
interneurons,
5-HT2A mRNA was expressed in 45%–69% of parvalbu-
min and 61%–87% of calbindin-positive cells. Parval-
bumin cells are fast-spiking interneurons with the
morphology of chandelier and large basket cells,
whereas calbindin cells are nonfast-spiking interneu-
rons with a double-bouquet cell
morphology (see
Mengod et al., 2015, and references therein). Thus, the
authors concluded that the majority of glutamatergic
neurons express 5-HT2A receptors, whereas this expres-
sion occurs only in a limited population of GABAergic
neurons.
To determine the specific cell types expressing
5-HT2A receptors in the cortex, Weber and Andrade
(2010) used BAC transgenic mice engineered to express
EGFP under the control of the 5-HT2A receptor pro-
moter. EGFP expression was used to identify 5-HT2A
gene-expressing neurons both in vivo and in vitro. They
also used 5-HT2A KO mice, as well as a third strain of
mice that expressed YFP under control of the Thy-1
promoter in pyramidal cells of layer Vb. Data were
compared using these three transgenic mice to demon-
strate that 5-HT2A receptors in the cortex are expressed
predominantly by three discrete populations of cells:
layer V pyramidal cells of the anterior cerebral cortex, a
subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons restricted to
the middle layers of the cortex, and nonpyramidal cells of
the subplate/layer VIb. A large percentage of the
GABAergic interneurons were parvalbumin-expressing
fast-spiking interneurons, consistent with work from
other laboratories (de Almeida and Mengod, 2007; Puig
et al., 2010). Taken together with results from others, the
authors indicate that “5-HT2A receptors are expressed at
loci critical for controlling information processing in
cerebral cortex” (Weber and Andrade, 2010).
Most recently, Mengod et al. (2015) reviewed the
cartography of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor subtypes in
the PFC and its projections. They conclude that in the
rat PFC, 5-HT2A receptors are expressed in pyramidal
tract neurons that project to the dorsal raphe nucleus,
VTA, and nucleus accumbens.
Nordstrom et al. (2008) used [11C]N-methylspiperone
(NMS) PET analysis in four human subjects with
the 5-HT2A receptor inverse agonist ACP-103 [N-(4-
fluorophenylmethyl)-N-(1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)-N9-(4-
(2-methylpropyloxy)phenylmethyl)carbamide]. Cortical
[11C]NMS binding was measured by PET after escalat-
ing single oral doses of ACP-103. Displacement of
[11C]NMS was about half-maximal after a 5-mg dose
and near maximal displacement after 10- to 20-mg doses.
Ettrup et al. (2010) evaluated [11C]CIMBI-5 [N-(2-
methoxybenzyl)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenethylamine]
(25I-NBOMe) as an agonist radioligand for PET imag-
ing of 5-HT2A receptors. [11C]CIMBI-5 showed high
cortical uptake in vivo in pig brain. CIMBI-5 was
the first 5-HT2A agonist PET ligand developed.
[11C]CIMBI-5 and the 5-HT2A antagonist PET ligand
[18F]altanserin showed similar cortex-to-cerebellum
uptake and had similar target-to-background ratios.
In a subsequent publication, Ettrup et al. (2011)
examined a series of nine structural congeners of
CIMBI-5 to identify one with improved target-to-
background binding. Their most promising candidate
proved to be [11C]Cimbi-36, which was further charac-
terized by Finnema et al. (2014) as an improved agonist
PET radioligand for in vivo imaging of 5-HT2A and
5-HT2C receptors in the nonhuman primate brain.
B. Serotonin 5-Hydroxytryptamine 2A Receptor
Expression in the Thalamus and Reticular Nucleus
In addition to the cortex, the thalamus and reticular
nucleus of the thalamus may also be important sites
of action for psychedelics. The 5-HT2A receptor is
expressed in the thalamus, primarily in sensory and
“nonspecific” nuclei (Cornea-Hébert et al., 1999). In the
rat brain, significant levels of 5-HT2A receptor mRNA
are expressed in the reticular nucleus, lateral genicu-
late nucleus, zona incerta, and the anterodorsal and
ventromedial nucleus of the thalamus (Cyr et al., 2000).
Pompeiano et al. (1994) also found 5-HT2A mRNA in the
reticular nucleus, lateral geniculate, and zona incerta,
but none in the midline or intralaminar nuclei. The
Psychedelics
301
 thalamus, along with the amygdala, represents the major
source of glutamate afferents innervating the neocortex.
The thalamus not only processes somatosensory inputs,
but it also receives afferents from both the raphe nuclei
and the LC (Asanuma, 1992). It is interesting that very
small bilateral lesions in the intralaminar nuclei, which
project axons widely to all cortical areas, can lead to
permanent loss of consciousness (Bogen, 1997).
The reticular nucleus is of particular interest here
because it is thought to serve as a sort of gate for
processing signals to the cortex. It is a thin sheet of
GABAergic neurons that has functionally distinct af-
ferent and efferent connections with thalamic nuclei,
the neocortex, the basal forebrain, and the brainstem.
Rodríguez et al. (2011) found that the two major post-
synaptic serotonin receptors in the reticular nucleus
were of the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A subtypes. Serotonergic
projections from the dorsal raphe and supralemniscal
nucleus (B9) were demonstrated to be the principal
sources of raphe projections to the reticular nucleus.
The reticular nucleus is known to regulate the flow of
information between the thalamus and the cortex and
sends inhibitory projections into the thalamus, appar-
ently serving a negative-feedback regulatory role in
thalamic function. It has been proposed to serve as a
sort of “searchlight” of attention (Crick, 1984; Sherman
and Guillery, 1996) and to control elements of signal to
noise or the quality of information being sent to the
cortex (see Vollenweider and Geyer, 2001, and refer-
ences therein).
C. Serotonin 5-Hydroxytryptamine 2A Receptor
Expression in Primary Visual Cortex V1
One of the prominent clinical features of psychedelic
drugs is their effect on visual perception, even at
relatively low doses. Subjects report visual phenomena
such as “walls breathing,” “curtains waving,” or un-
dulating patterns in carpets, visual arabesques, com-
plex textures, and so forth. Certainly these illusory
effects could arise through a variety of mechanisms,
because 5-HT2A receptors are expressed in many areas
of the brain responsible for cognition and sensory
processing. It has not been widely appreciated, how-
ever, that mammalian primary visual cortex area V1,
the largest known visual cortical area, expresses a high
density of 5-HT2A receptors (Watakabe et al., 2009;
Moreau et al., 2010). Microiontophoresis of DOI into
macaque V1 gave a bidirectional modulatory effect on
the neuron’s firing rate. Analysis of recordings from
44 neurons showed that DOI facilitates visual responses
of neurons with a low firing rate but suppressed those of
neurons with a high firing rate. This effect of DOI was
blocked by ketanserin. The authors suggest that neu-
rons in the input layers of V1, which abundantly express
the 5-HT2A receptor, may act as gain controllers by
enhancing weak signal response and suppressing ex-
cessive response.
D. Effects of Psychedelics on Raphe Cell Firing
Midbrain raphe cells send serotonergic projections
throughout the forebrain and are the source of serotonin
afferents in the PFC (Moore et al., 1978). Raphe cells
fire at a characteristic regular rate that is generally
correlated with a mammalian organism’s level of vigi-
lance or attention. When the organism is awake, the
cells fire at a characteristic slow regular rate; as the
organism grows drowsy, the rate of firing slows. During
the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stage, raphe cell
firing essentially stops completely. As a consequence of
slowed raphe firing, serotonin release in projection
areas declines or ceases.
Early experiments found that LSD potently sup-
pressed cell firing in the dorsal raphe nucleus if it was
given systemically (Aghajanian et al., 1968, 1970) or
applied by microiontophoresis directly to the raphe cell
bodies (Aghajanian et al., 1972). Tryptamine psyche-
delics all inhibited dorsal raphe cell firing (Aghajanian
et al., 1970; Aghajanian and Hailgler, 1975; deMontigny
and Aghajanian, 1977), leading Aghajanian and
Hailgler (1975) to hypothesize that this suppressant
effect on raphe cell firing might be the underlying basis
for the action of psychedelics.
In subsequent studies, phenethylamine psychedelics
failed to have a direct suppressant effect on raphe cell
firing. After additional experiments, it was ultimately
discovered that suppression of raphe cell firing by
psychedelic tryptamines resulted from stimulation of
5-HT1A somatodendritic autoreceptors, and nonhalluci-
nogenic 5-HT1A agonists were identified that also sup-
pressed raphe firing (Sprouse and Aghajanian, 1987,
1988). Phenethylamine-type psychedelics such as mes-
caline lack 5-HT1A agonist activity, so this hypothesis
for the mechanism of action of psychedelics was,
therefore, not tenable. Nevertheless, phenethylamine-
type psychedelics do suppress firing of a subset of raphe
cells when given systemically but not when adminis-
tered directly into the raphe (Aghajanian et al., 1970;
Haigler and Aghajanian, 1973). This suppressant effect
by phenethylamine psychedelics is thought to occur
through an indirect GABA-mediated mechanism (Liu
et al., 2000; Martín-Ruiz et al., 2001). Thus, an in-
creased GABA release onto raphe cells may explain the
previous observation of an indirect suppression of 5-
HT cells in the dorsal raphe induced by phenethylamine
psychedelics in vivo.
E. Serotonin 5-Hydroxytryptamine 2A Receptor
Expression in the Ventral Tegmental Area
Anatomic and physiologic data suggest that a likely
site for serotonergic modulation of dopaminergic trans-
mission is through direct actions on mesolimbic and
mesocortical dopaminergic transmission in the VTA
(see Doherty and Pickel, 2000, and references therein).
A variety of reports provide evidence for direct and
302
Nichols
 indirect modulation of VTA dopaminergic neurons
through activation of 5-HT2A receptors in this region.
Cornea-Hébert et al. (1999) identified somatodendritic
localization of 5-HT2A receptors in the VTA, and de-
polarization of dopamine cells in VTA slice preparations
can be blocked by the 5-HT2A–selective antagonist
ketanserin (Pessia et al., 1994).
An electron microscopy immunocytochemical study
showed localization of 5-HT2A receptors in both the
parabrachial and paranigral regions of the VTA, with
label identified primarily as dendrites and unmyelinated
axons (Doherty and Pickel, 2000). Dendrites commonly
showed 5-HT2A receptor immunoreactivity colocalized
with tyrosine hydroxylase. Thus, 5-HT2A receptor activa-
tion may directly affect local dendritic release of dopa-
mine as well as release of dopamine in mesocortical and
mesolimbic terminal fields. A substantial number of 5-
HT2A–labeled dendrites were also detected that did not
contain tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity, suggest-
ing 5-HT2A receptor modulation of other nondopaminer-
gic, perhaps GABAergic, interneurons in the VTA.
In a study using fluorescence immunohistochemistry
with confocal microscopy, Nocjar et al. (2002) found that
5-HT2A receptors were colocalized, in part, to tyrosine
hydroxylase–containing cells throughout all subnuclei
of the VTA, most prominently in the anterior region,
principally within the rostral and midparanigral, para-
brachial, and intrafascicular nuclei. Thus, activation of
5-HT2A receptors by psychedelics would be expected to
modulate dopaminergic activity of VTA cells either
directly or indirectly through nondopaminergic neu-
rons, and effect excitatory dopamine release from
projections in cortical and limbic structures.
Pehek et al. (2001) used in vivo microdialysis in the
rat mPFC to show that direct infusion of the selective
5-HT2A antagonist M100907 through the dialysis probe
produced a concentration-dependent block of K+-stimulated
dopamine release. Direct infusion of M100907 into the
mPFC also blocked increased extracellular dopamine
produced by systemically administered DOI. They con-
cluded that activation of cortical 5-HT2A receptors poten-
tiated the phasic release of mesocortical dopamine.
Similarly, systemic administration of DOI to freely
moving rats dose-dependently increased dialysate lev-
els of dopamine and NE in the frontal cortex. This effect
was abolished by the selective 5-HT2A antagonist
M100907, which by itself did not change dopamine
or NE levels. By contrast, the selective 5-HT2B/2C
antagonist SB-206553 (3,5-dihydro-5-methyl-N-3-
pyridinylbenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b’]dipyrrole-1(2H)-carboxamide
hydrochloride) potentiated the effect of DOI. The authors
concluded that 5-HT2A receptors exert a phasic facilita-
tory influence on cortical levels of dopamine and NE,
whereas 5-HT2C receptors exert an inhibitory effect.
Finally, in healthy human volunteers, PET has been
used to study a possible role for dopamine in the effects
of psilocybin. An effective dose of psilocybin, which lacks
significant affinity for dopamine receptors, signifi-
cantly decreased binding of the dopamine D2 antagonist
[11C]raclopride in both the caudate nucleus and
putamen, a finding that would be consistent with an in-
creaseinextracellulardopamine(Vollenweideretal., 1999).
F. Effect of Psychedelics on the Locus Coeruleus
Although the majority of studies point to a major site
of action for psychedelics in the frontal cortex, perhaps
with important involvement of the thalamus, psyche-
delics also have a potent effect on the LC. This finding is
very intriguing because the LC is a point of convergence
for widely ranging somatosensory and visceral sensory
inputs from all regions of the body. The LC has been
likened to a “novelty detector” for salient external
stimuli (Cedarbaum and Aghajanian, 1978; Aston-
Jones and Bloom, 1981). The LC sends NE projections
diffusely to all parts of the neuraxis, including the
cerebral cortex (Aghajanian and Marek, 1999a). Within
the cortex, 5-HT2A and a1-adrenergic receptors share a
similar regional and laminar distribution, with heaviest
concentrations in layer Va (see Marek and Aghajanian,
1999, and references therein). Furthermore, activation
of either 5-HT2A or a1 adrenergic receptors modulates
cortical pyramidal cells and interneurons in a parallel
fashion (Marek and Aghajanian, 1994, 1996, 1999).
Using double in situ hybridization, Santana et al.
(2013) performed a quantitative study of the expression
of a1A, a1B, and a1D adrenergic receptors in pyrami-
dal vesicular glutamate transporter 1–positive and
GABAergic (GAD65/67–positive) cells of rat PFC. Given
the common signaling pathways shared by 5-HT2A and
a1 adrenergic receptors, they examined the coexpres-
sion of both receptors in the rat PFC using double in situ
hybridization histochemistry. They found that virtually
all subdivisions of the PFC contained cells expressing
one or more a1 adrenergic receptors. The most abundant
transcripts were those corresponding to a1A and a1D
adrenergic receptors. The various a1 adrenergic re-
ceptor transcripts showed an almost nonoverlapping
regional distribution within the mPFC that was partic-
ularly evident for a1A and a1D adrenergic receptors. The
former transcript was densely expressed in deep layers
VIa and VIb of the medial, dorsal, and lateral (agranular
insular) PFC and the claustrum, as well as in ventral
areas such as the orbital and piriform cortices and the
tenia tecta. By contrast, the a1D adrenergic receptor
transcript was especially abundant in layers II to III,
and outer layer V in medial and dorsolateral aspects of
the PFC. All three types of a1 adrenergic receptors were
observed to be present in pyramidal (vesicular glutamate
transporter 1–positive) and GABAergic (GAD65/67–
positive) neurons. Pyramidal neurons expressing a1A
adrenergic receptors were more abundantly localized in
deep layers V to VI in the three mPFC subdivisions.
The regional distribution of a1 adrenergic receptor
and 5-HT2A receptor mRNA was very similar in the
Psychedelics
303
 PFC, with the exception of layer VI, and the more
ventral part of the infralimbic cortex, with low 5-HT2A
receptor mRNA expression, whereas virtually all other
areas in the PFC showed an abundant expression of
both receptor transcripts. Taking 5-HT2A–expressing
cells as 100%, the percentage of cells also expressing a1
adrenergic receptors varied between 44% in the infra-
limbic area to 75% and 80%, respectively, in the
prelimbic and cingulate areas. Each a1 adrenergic
receptor type was extensively coexpressed with 5-
HT2A receptors, indicating a convergence of excitatory
noradrenergic and serotonergic signals in the same PFC
neurons. The different a1 adrenergic receptors also were
expressed in a high proportion of GABAergic interneu-
rons, similar to that seen in pyramidal neurons (69%–
74% in superficial layers; 52%–73% in deep layers).
Overall, the presence of a1 adrenergic receptors in such
a large proportion of pyramidal and GABAergic neurons
suggested to the authors that NE can modulate the
activity of most PFC output neurons via direct or
indirect actions.
Systemic administration of LSD, mescaline, or other
phenethylamine psychedelics to anesthetized rats de-
creased spontaneous activity of LC cells but surpris-
ingly enhanced the activity of LC neurons evoked by
sensory stimuli (Aghajanian, 1980; Rasmussen and
Aghajanian, 1986; Rasmussen et al., 1986). Direct
microiontophoretic application of the drugs onto LC cell
bodies did not have the same effect, indicating some
indirect effect of the drugs. The action did depend on 5-
HT2A receptor activation, however, because systemic
administration of ritanserin, a 5-HT2A antagonist,
blocked the effect.
Similarly, systemic, but not local, administration of
DOI suppressed spontaneous LC activity but enhanced
responses to somatosensory stimulation, with both
effects being blocked by systemic administration of
ketanserin, a 5-HT2A–selective antagonist (Chiang
and Aston-Jones, 1993). DOI-induced suppression of
LC firing was blocked by local infusion of GABA
antagonists, and enhanced responses to external stim-
uli were blocked by an NMDA antagonist. These
investigators proposed that systemic administration of
5-HT2 agonists suppressed LC firing indirectly, through
tonic activation of inhibitory GABAergic inputs to the
LC. They proposed that the facilitating effect on sensory
inputs was mediated through excitatory amino acid
receptors in the LC.
As a “novelty detector,” the LC has been viewed as
enhancing the signal to noise ratio in modulating post-
synaptic activity throughout the brain; suppression of
basal activity concomitantly with enhanced responding
to external sensory stimuli would amplify this effect
(see Marek and Aghajanian, 1998b, and references
therein). Thus, after application of a psychedelic, one
might speculate that sensory events that would be
perceived as ordinary might instead be perceived as
having increased novelty. Indeed, it is a well known
anecdote that under the influence of psychedelics, one
may perceive very ordinary objects as new or novel.
The LC sends noradrenergic projections to the cortex,
where a1 adrenergic and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors
both share a similar laminar distribution and similar
signaling pathways in pyramidal cells. Thus, changes in
LC firing would also affect pyramidal cell excitability. It
would be very surprising, therefore, if changes in LC
firing induced by psychedelics also did not modulate the
direct effects of 5-HT2A agonists on cortical cells.
G. Serotonin 5-Hydroxytryptamine 2A Receptor
Expression in the Amygdala
The amygdala is a structure located in the medial
portion of the temporal lobe and is involved in numerous
tasks that include the generation of emotional behavior,
the formation of emotional memories related to fear and
anxiety, and modulation of the consolidation of explicit
memories for emotionally arousing events. Fear condi-
tioning is known to be a model of emotional learning in
which amygdala circuits play an important role (see
references in Bombardi, 2014). The amygdala receives
substantial
serotoninergic
innervation
originating
mainly from the dorsal raphe nucleus and, to a lesser
extent, from the median raphe nucleus (Pralong et al.,
2002; Hensler, 2006; Asan et al., 2013). Autoradiogra-
phy with [3H]ketanserin has shown light to moderate
expression of 5-HT2A receptors in most nuclei of the
amygdala, with higher expression in the cortical nu-
cleus and dorsolateral subdivision of the lateral nucleus
(Pazos et al., 1985). Similarly, in situ hybridization has
demonstrated that most nuclei of the amygdala have
moderate levels of 5-HT2A receptor mRNA, with higher
levels in the cortical nucleus and dorsolateral subdivi-
sion of the lateral nucleus (Wright et al., 1995).
McDonald and Mascagni (2007) used single- and
double-labeling immunohistochemical techniques to
examine the expression of 5HT2A (and other serotonin
receptors) in rat basolateral amygdala. They obtained
different patterns of immunostaining, depending on
which of three different antibodies they employed.
Two of the antibodies (BD and Ab51) gave immunos-
taining, suggesting that virtually all pyramidal cells in
the basolateral nuclear complex of the amygdala ex-
press 5-HT2A receptors that are primarily associated
with dendrites.
Serotonin regulates amygdalar activity through acti-
vation of the 5-HT2 receptor family, which includes
the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. In the
deep nuclei of the amygdala, the 5-HT2A receptor is
expressed on both excitatory (glutamatergic) pyramidal
and inhibitory (GABAergic) nonpyramidal neurons,
potentially playing a crucial role in the formation of
emotional memories. In the rat, 100% of pyramidal cells
in the deep nuclei express the 5-HT2A receptor, where it
is strongly expressed in the apical dendrites, similarly
304
Nichols
 to cortical pyramidal cells, and may induce excitatory
synaptic currents. In the rat deep nuclei, 5-HT2A
immunoreactivity is seen in both GABAergic interneu-
rons and projection neurons. 5-HT2A receptor immuno-
reactivity is also observed in every superficial nucleus of
the rat amygdala.
The 5-HT2 receptor family plays a crucial role in
regulating the activity of amygdalar microcircuits and
projections, modulating both excitatory and inhibitory
neurons, in parallel to what is seen in the cerebral
cortex. Although the exact role of the 5-HT2A receptor,
and other 5-HT2 receptor family members, is not well
understood with respect to the amygdala, it is clear that
the 5-HT2A receptor plays an important role in emotional
responses and is an important target to be considered in
the actions of 5-HT2A agonist psychedelics.
H. A Role for the Claustrum?
Crick and Koch (2005) speculated on the possible
relationship of the claustrum to the processes that give
rise to integrated conscious percepts. That is, they
proposed that the claustrum may play a key role in
information processing in the brain by correlating
activity in different sensory cortices into one coherent
activity that binds separate sensations into the unitary
objects that we experience in consciousness. They
suggested that the claustrum may be analogous to a
conductor, coordinating the musicians in an orchestra.
Autoradiography studies in the rat brain using tritiated
antagonist ligands have identified brain areas that
expressed 5-HT2 receptors (Pazos et al., 1985). Although
high receptor density was seen in all laminae of the
neocortex, the highest binding was observed in the
claustrum. Similarly, rat brain autoradiography using
the 5-HT2A/2C agonist R-(–)-[125I]DOI confirmed the
highest binding in the claustrum as well as the frontal
cortex (McKenna and Saavedra, 1987). The very high
density of 5-HT2A receptors in the claustrum indicated
that further inquiry into the structure and function of
the claustrum was warranted for this review. The
claustrum lies at the confluence of a large number of
simple loops with the cortex, so it is natural to ask
whether the claustrum might be a previously unrecog-
nized target for psychedelics.
The claustrum has remained one of the most enig-
matic structures in the brain for several centuries. It is a
thin, irregular sheet of gray matter, with one located on
each side of the brain. It lies under the inner surface of
the neocortex, below the general region of the insula,
and above the outer surface of the putamen, with fiber
tracts on each side: the extreme and external capsules.
Because of the claustrum’s location, small size, and
shape, however, it has been difficult to study its
connections and functions. Nevertheless, it is generally
accepted today that the claustrum exhibits widely
distributed reciprocal anatomic projections to virtually
all regions of the cortex as well as to many subcortical
structures, including the hippocampus, amygdala, and
caudate nucleus. Substantial evidence now exists that
the major target of claustral projections is the cortex,
and that the major input to the claustrum comes from
the cortex (see reviews by Smythies et al., 2012, 2014;
Baizer et al., 2014; Mathur, 2014; Torgerson and Van
Horn, 2014).
Claustral neurons are of two kinds: type I and type II.
Golgi type I neurons comprise approximately 85% of all
claustral neurons and are evenly distributed through-
out the body of the claustrum. They have spiny den-
drites with axons projecting out of the claustrum either
medially or laterally and are excitatory neurons that
send projections to, and receive projections from, the
cortex. They express the vesicular glutamate trans-
porter Vglut2 and are thus inferred to be glutamatergic.
The remaining cells are Golgi type II neurons, lacking
spines, with axons that do not project outside of the body
of the claustrum. These are thought to be inhibitory-like
interneurons that provide a substrate for local informa-
tion processing (Mathur, 2014). Anterograde labeling
studies in the cat have demonstrated the abundance of
claustral terminals in the inner parts of layers III (IV in
some PFC zones) and VI, as well as in layer I, but layer
V is remarkably free of terminals (Clascá et al., 1992).
Immunohistochemical studies in rats and cats sug-
gest that the claustrum receives a diffuse serotonergic
innervation, most likely from the brainstem dorsal
raphe nucleus (Baizer, 2001; Rahman and Baizer,
2007). Although knowledge of claustral function is
seriously lacking, most evidence suggests that the
claustrum may serve as a subcortical relay nucleus
through which different sensory cortices can access each
other to associate modalities. The claustrum theoreti-
cally synchronizes cortical areas to accomplish the feat
of crossing modalities.
Milardi et al. (2015) used constrained spherical
deconvolution tractography to elucidate the complex
relationships between the fiber systems in the claus-
trum. They detected four groups of white matter fibers
connecting the claustrum to the cortex (anterior, poste-
rior, superior, and lateral) and provided a detailed
representation of brain areas connected to the
claustrum.
Although Crick and Koch (2005) proposed that the
claustrum might mediate consciousness, or provide
perceptual integration across sensory modalities,
Baizer et al. (2014) argue against this hypothesis,
stating that intraclaustral processing would require
that the claustrum be a continuous structure, which it is
not in every species. Furthermore, as the cortex has
expanded through evolution in different species, the
size of the claustrum has actually decreased in relative
size (Kowianski et al., 1999).
Most recently, Torgerson et al. (2015) carried out the
first population-level study in 100 healthy human
subjects to quantitatively examine the structural
Psychedelics
305
 connectivity of the claustrum using in vivo brain
mapping and graph analytic methods. Using diffusion
tensor imaging tractography and graph theoretical
analytics, they computationally verified that the human
claustrum is widely connected, with the highest density
of fiber connections per unit volume of all brain regions
examined. The claustra had their densest diffusion
tensor imaging fiber connections to frontal cortices,
with more modest degrees of connectivity to parietal,
temporal, and occipital lobes, respectively. Their results
are consistent with the notion that the claustrum plays
a central role in linking multiple disparate structural
brain networks. Torgerson et al. (2015) conclude that
the claustrum occupies a unique, and presumably
critical, “location” in the overall architecture of network
connectivity in the brain, and they suggest that the
“claustrum may serve to filter signals about the rela-
tionships of all the thousands of sensorimotor inputs
from the outside world to and from frontal and cingulate
processing subnetworks. Its differential influence on
brain region subnetworks typically associated with high
cognitive activity, attention, and action suggest that the
claustrum plays a central role in linking multiple
sensory networks with those regions that can interpret
and take action on such information.” They contend that
their results are in concurrence with the proposal of
Crick and Koch (2005).
Stiefel et al. (2014) presented a further argument to
support a key role of the claustrum in consciousness, by
considering the very potent hallucinogenic effects of
salvinorin A. Salvinorin A is a natural product derived
from Salvia divinorum, which is a specific high-affinity
k-opioid agonist (Roth et al., 2002). Stiefel et al. (2014)
argue that its psychotomimetic effects may result from
stimulation of k receptors in the claustrum. They base
their hypothesis on work by Peckys and Landwehrmeyer
(1999), who measured k-opioid mRNA receptor expres-
sion in the human brain using in situ hybridization. The
strongest signal was found in the claustrum, and nearly
all neurons exhibited high k opioid receptor signals. In
addition, Sim-Selley et al. (1999) measured a very high
level of k receptor-stimulated [35S]GTPgS in the claus-
trum of the cynomolgus monkey brain, with “an area of
especially high stimulation in the ventral claustrum,
adjacent to the amygdala.”
Interestingly, Koubeissi et al. (2014) reported the
case of a 54-year-old patient with intractable epilepsy.
Fifteen intraparenchymal electrodes were implanted in
her brain to assess the origin of her seizures. One of the
depth electrodes included a contact in the extreme
capsule in close proximity to the anterior insular cortex
and closest to the claustrum. Stimulation of this
electrode led to immediate impairment of conscious-
ness, 10 of 10 times, with the patient returning to
baseline when the stimulation was stopped. Stimula-
tion of neighboring contacts that were within 2.7 mm
did not elicit such phenomena. Koubeissi et al. (2014)
speculate that the claustrum “could be a key component
of the network supporting ‘conscious awareness’ during
wakefulness.” The authors suggest that the claustrum
might constitute a common gate to the external and
internal awareness networks, perhaps being a compo-
nent of the neural correlates of consciousness mediating
increased synchronization between various cortical
regions.
In a recent review, Goll et al. (2015) proposed that the
claustrum serves the function of segregating attention
between modalities, implicating the claustrum as a hub
for attention. They propose that “the claustrum serves
the function of segregating attention between modali-
ties, enabling us to isolate objects of current priority for
attention” (Goll et al., 2015). They draw certain paral-
lels between the claustrum and the thalamus, pro-
posing that both the thalamus and the claustrum have
the capacity to focus attention, but at different stages of
sensory processing.
All of these results, taken together, along with the
structural and functional knowledge that currently
exists for the claustrum, strongly indicate that the
claustrum must be seriously considered as a previously
unrecognized target for the action of the psychedelics.
There has been increasing interest in the functional role
of the claustrum, particularly since the Crick and Koch
(2005) proposal, and a more intense research focus on
this area of the brain seems likely to lead to very
important results.
As this review was being finalized, Nichols and
Martin (2015) reported that serotonergic hallucinogens
preferentially activate subsets of cortical neurons, in-
terneurons, and glial cells in the rat claustrum and
induce rapid redistribution of 5-HT2A receptor protein
within neurons. Using a refined process of cortical cell
dissociation and sorting by flow cytometry, Nichols and
Martin were able to identify, isolate, and separate
highly purified individual cellular populations that
included pyramidal neurons, the three subtypes of
GABA interneurons, glial cells, and astrocytes. Sorted
populations were processed for RNA extraction and
subjected to quantitative RT-PCR for gene expression
analysis. Only about 3% of total mPFC cells were
activated in response to DOI; after identification, it
was found that these activated cells displayed a 10-fold
higher expression of 5-HT2A receptors than the non-
activated population. The highest 5-HT2A receptor
expression and cellular activation was seen in these
cells, which were identified as claustral cells, in which
nearly one-half of the neurons were directly activated by
DOI.
V. Effects on Visual Perception
Binocular rivalry is a phenomenon that occurs when
different images are simultaneously presented to each
eye. When continually viewing this stimulus, observers
306
Nichols
 experience repeated switches between visual aware-
ness of the two images. Frecska et al. (2004) examined
the effects of the hallucinogenic brew ayahuasca on
binocular rivalry in 10 subjects. As noted earlier,
ayahuasca is a decoction made from two Amazonian
plants, containing DMT as the active psychedelic
component, and b-carboline alkaloids that inhibit the
liver MAO that normally breaks down orally ingested
DMT. Hence, ayahuasca might essentially be consid-
ered to be an orally active form of DMT. In this study, a
variant of stimulus presentation called dichoptic stim-
ulus alternation (DSA) was employed. In DSA, stimuli
are applied to the eyes in rapid alterations instead of
keeping the stimulus presented to each eye constant.
The stimuli consisted of white binocular fixation guides
centered within which is a disk filled either with
horizontal or vertical gratings. Standard binocular
rivalry was presented for 6 minutes to obtain the
endogenous perceptual alternation rate. Dichoptic re-
versal stimuli were presented at 3.75, 7.5, 15, and 30
reversals per second in four 1.5-minute epochs. At a low
DSA rate of 3.75 or 7.5 Hz, normal subjects reported
horizontal and vertical switching at a very high rate. At
15 and 30 Hz DSA, however, a blended percept (cross-
hatch) was consistently reported. By contrast, after
subjects had ingested ayahuasca, they were able to
maintain much longer horizontal or vertical dominance
periods, even when the stimuli were alternating at rates
almost two orders of magnitude faster than their
endogenous rivalry rate. To explain their results, the
authors favor a view that the persistence of binocular
rivalry at high DSA rates “requires a neural context
that involves the primary visual cortex and visual
pathways below.”
Carter et al. (2004) studied whether psilocybin could
impair motion processing in humans. They found that a
215-mg/kg dose of psilocybin selectively impaired global
motion, but not local motion processing in nine healthy
human subjects. They argue that because local motion
discrimination is thought to be a relatively low-level
process resolvable at the level of primary visual cortex
V1, the lack of effect of psilocybin on local motion
thresholds indicates that visual disturbances associ-
ated with the drug do not likely reflect changes at the
level of the retina or in transfer of information from the
retina through the lateral geniculate nucleus to primary
visual cortex.
Carter et al. (2005b) studied perceptual rivalry with
low-dose (115 mg/kg) and high-dose (250 mg/kg) psilocy-
bin in 12 healthy human volunteers. Stationary green
vertical and horizontal gratings were presented to the
subject’s left eye and right eye, respectively. Vertical
and horizontal gratings were presented alternately, in
rapid succession at 120 Hz. Subjects reported a domi-
nance of vertical gratings by pressing one computer key,
and by pressing another when they experienced a
dominance of horizontal gratings. They could also
respond if they experienced a stable mixed percept (grid
or patchwork). Psilocybin dose-dependently increased
binocular rivalry phase duration in a manner reflecting
subjective changes in state of consciousness, as assessed
with the 5D-ASC rating scale developed by Dittrich
(1998).
Carter et al. (2007) explored the proposed relation-
ship between binocular rivalry switch rate and sub-
jective changes in psychologic state associated with
5-HT2A receptor activation. Ten healthy human sub-
jects were tested after administration of psilocybin
(215 mg/kg) and after pretreatment with the selective
5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin (50 mg). Psilocybin
significantly reduced the rate of binocular rivalry
switching. Pretreatment with 50 mg ketanserin blocked
most of psilocybin’s positive psychosis-like hallucino-
genic effects but had no effect on the suppression of
binocular rivalry switching induced by psilocybin, indi-
cating that the psilocybin-induced rate reduction likely
was not mediated by 5-HT2A receptor activation.
Carter et al. (2005a) investigated the effects of
psilocybin (215 mg/kg, p.o.) on attentional function in
eight healthy volunteers using a multiple-object track-
ing task. The task required subjects to track a subset
(up to eight) of 20 visually indistinguishable randomly
moving green dots. This task is believed to test an
individual’s capacity to maintain multiple foci of atten-
tion simultaneously. They also tested spatial working
memory using an electronic version of Corsi’s block
tapping task, in which subjects were required to re-
member and reproduce a sequence of up to nine spatial
locations. Because the effects of psilocybin are thought
to be mediated primarily by activation of the 5-HT2A
receptor, the selective 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin
(50 mg, p.o.) was used to determine whether it would
attenuate any psilocybin-induced changes in atten-
tional tracking or spatial working memory. The 5D-
ASC rating scale (Dittrich, 1998) was also used to assess
the subjective effects of the drug.
Carter et al. (2005a) found that psilocybin signifi-
cantly increased four of the five factors in the 5D-ASC,
but only the factor of reduced vigilance remained
significantly elevated after ketanserin pretreatment.
Performance on the tracking task varied inversely with
the number of targets subjects had to track, and it
dropped off markedly when the number of targets
exceeded three. The number of dots successfully tracked
was significantly reduced from placebo in both the
psilocybin and psilocybin plus ketanserin pretreatment
conditions; ketanserin alone had no effect. In the spatial
working memory task, psilocybin had no significant
effect on the number of boxes remembered correctly in
sequence “span length,” indicating that psilocybin had
no effect on spatial working memory performance.
Thus, psilocybin impaired multiple-object tracking
through a non–5-HT2A receptor–dependent mechanism
but had no effect on spatial working memory. In view of
Psychedelics
307
 the fact that psilocybin has agonist actions at the
5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT1A receptors, the authors
suggest that the deficit in attentional tracking might be
due to the 5-HT1A receptor agonist action of psilocybin. In
that event, activation of somatodendritic autoreceptors in
the raphe would lead to a reduction of 5-HT release into
forebrain regions, possibly disrupting multiple-tracking
ability mediated by those regions and consistent with
work from other laboratories suggesting involvement of
5-HT and the 5-HT1A receptor in attention (see references
in Carter et al., 2005a).
To further characterize the role of 5-HT1A/2A receptors
in visual processing, Kometer et al. (2011) assessed the
effect of psilocybin (125 and 250 mg/kg) versus placebo
on spatiotemporal dynamics of modal object completion
in 17 healthy volunteers. Modal object recognition
refers to the illusory perception of object boundaries
and their enclosing surface when there is no direct
sensory information to depict those boundaries or
surfaces. The authors employed visual evoked potential
recordings in conjunction with topographic mapping
and source analysis. EEG recordings were made while
participants viewed Kanizsa and non-Kanizsa figures.
Behavioral responses were recorded and high-density
electrical mapping with source analysis was used,
allowing for the measurement of the spatiotemporal
brain dynamics of visual modal object completion and
its association with the appearance of visual hallucina-
tions. Imaging studies have provided evidence that the
intermediate lateral occipital complex (LOC) as well as
the early visual area V2 probably play a major role in
modal completion. Electrophysiological studies have
demonstrated that modal object completion of simple
figures such as Kanizsa figures is predominantly
indexed by modulation of the N170 component (see
references in Kometer et al., 2011).
Kometer et al. (2011) found that psilocybin increased
reaction time, which was generally faster for Kanizsa
than for non-Kanizsa figures. After psilocybin treat-
ment, the P1 amplitude (90–144 milliseconds) was
increased and was locally restricted to occipital elec-
trode sites. Psilocybin dose-dependently decreased the
N170 amplitude (148–223 milliseconds). Source esti-
mation revealed activity within LOC and V2 in both
hemispheres, with current source density stronger
within the right-lateralized LOC and V2 in the Kanizsa
compared with the non-Kanizsa condition. Psilocybin
dose-dependently decreased the differential activation
of the two stimulus conditions and reduced the current
source density within the LOC, V2, and fusiform gyrus
in both stimulus conditions. Psilocybin-induced current
source-density
reduction
over
the
right-lateralized
LOC, V2, and posterior parietal areas correlated signif-
icantly with the increased intensity of visual hallucina-
tions. The three main findings of this study were as
follows. First, there was a strong dose-dependent effect
of psilocybin to decrease the N170 component, but there
was a slight increase of the earlier visual P1 component
over occipital sites. Second, the N170 component re-
duction was stronger for the Kanizsa figure condition
than for the non-Kanizsa condition. Third, during this
time range, the decrease in activation over the right-
lateralized extrastriate and posterior parietal cortex
was correlated with the reported intensity of visual
hallucinations. The preferential reduction of the N170
amplitude in the Kanizsa compared with the non-
Kanizsa condition indicates a key role for 5-HT1A/2A
receptor(s) in object completion. Reduced extrastriate
visual cortex activation during the time range of the
N170 also identifies it as a potential key component of
5-HT2A agonist–induced visual hallucinations.
Kometer et al. (2013) used a similar experimental
approach to assess the effects of psilocybin on both a
oscillations that regulate cortical excitability and early
visual P1 and N170 potentials in 17 healthy humans.
They also tested whether these effects were related to
the formation of visual hallucinations. Parieto-occipital
a oscillations are crucial for modulation of visual
network excitability and strongly influence visual per-
ception (see references in Kometer et al., 2013). The
authors hypothesized that activating 5-HT2A receptors
with psilocybin might modulate a oscillations, leading
to an altered excitability that would promote visual
hallucination formation. They used a double-blind,
placebo-controlled randomized design, in which sub-
jects received pretreatments of placebo or ketanserin
(50 mg, p.o.) and treatments of placebo or psilocybin
(215 mg/kg). Stimuli were Kanizsa figures that induce
the perception of an illusory triangle, or non-Kanizsa
figures in which the figure alignment no longer induces
that perception. EEG data were recorded and the P1
and N170 amplitudes were quantified, with a time
frame from 80–120 milliseconds for the P1 and 150–
190 milliseconds for the N170 amplitude.
Kometer et al. (2013) report that psilocybin robustly
induced visual perceptual alterations that included
complex visual hallucinations of scenes and pictures,
visual elementary hallucinations of regular patterns,
colors, light, and light flashes, but no such effects
occurred after ketanserin pretreatment. Psilocybin
selectively increased P1 amplitudes over the medial
but not the lateral parieto-occipital regions of interest,
and the psilocybin-induced increase over the medial
region was blocked by ketanserin. The N170 amplitudes
were decreased by psilocybin, and this effect was
blocked by ketanserin. Correlation analysis with the
original five main factors of the 5D-ASC revealed that
the N170 decrease was selectively associated with
visual perceptual alterations. Psilocybin also strongly
decreased prestimulus a power (i.e., 98–12 Hz; 2600 to
2200 milliseconds), most evident in the right parieto-
occipital region, and this decrease also was prevented
by ketanserin pretreatment. The psilocybin-induced
decrease in a power was significantly correlated with
308
Nichols
 the psilocybin-induced increase in the medial P1 visual
potential. The high level of prestimulus a power was
strongly attenuated by psilocybin, and this effect was
reversed by ketanserin pretreatment, suggesting that
5-HT2A receptor activation increases excitability of the
visual network in the absence of externally presented
stimuli by decreasing ongoing a oscillations. Further-
more, the strongly decreased prestimulus a power by
psilocybin precluded observation of any subsequent
stimulus-induced decrease in a power. The authors
conclude that 5-HT2A receptor activation induces a
“dysbalance” between the excitability observed in the
absence of an external stimulus and the excitability
induced by the presentation of a stimulus, which occurs
primarily by an attenuation of ongoing a oscillations.
The fact that both the N170 potentials and perceptual
alterations were blocked by ketanserin pretreatment
led the authors to suggest that the decrease in N170
potentials is a crucial mechanism underlying 5-HT2A
receptor–mediated alterations of visual perception.
de Araujo et al. (2012) investigated the neural basis of
imagery induced by the psychedelic Amazonian brew
ayahuasca. They studied 10 regular ayahuasca users who
participated in two fMRI sessions. The first scan was
performed on the subjects before taking ayahuasca, after
which they immediately drank ayahuasca. Psychologic
changes were assessed at various times, and became
significant at 40 and 80 minutes after ingestion. The
second fMRI session began 40 minutes after drug intake
when effects were at their maximum. Subjects performed
three different visual tasks. First, they passively viewed
natural images of people, animals, or trees. Then they
were asked to close their eyes and mentally generate the
same image they had just seen. Finally, they viewed a
scrambled version of the image. Statistically significant
brain areas of blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD)
signal increase were observed after ayahuasca intake,
compared with the predrug condition. The increase in the
BOLD signal was most pronounced in the bilateral
occipital cortex, extending into the inferior and medial
temporal lobe, and to parts of the frontal lobe. The signal
amplitude after ayahuasca intake increased markedly in
occipital areas during imagery, but not when viewing
natural images. The activity of several cortical areas
known to be involved in episodic memory and contextual
association processing was also potentiated by ayahuasca
during the imagery task. A connectivity analysis revealed
that ayahuasca strongly altered fronto-occipital relation-
ships, leading to marked changes in the timing of events
across several brain regions. de Araujo et al. (2012)
speculate that the robust visions induced by ayahuasca
may even be initiated in the primary visual cortex.
VI. Effects on Sleep
Systemic administration of DOM (Dugovic et al.,
1989) and DOI (Monti et al., 1990) was previously
shown to reduce REM and slow wave sleep in the rat,
and to increase wakefulness through a 5-HT2 receptor–
mediated action. In addition, Amici et al. (2004) had
microinjected DOI or ketanserin directly into the
laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, which had been found
to express 5-HT2 receptors (Morilak and Ciaranello,
1993). DOI significantly decreased the number but not
the duration of REM sleep episodes. The authors cite
previous work by others showing that silencing raphe
neurons removes inhibition from cholinergic cells in the
laterodorsal tegmental and pedunculopontine tegmental
nuclei that are involved in generating REM sleep (see
references in Amici et al., 2004). To determine the receptors
responsible for these effects of racemic DOI, Monti and
Jantos (2006a) microinjected serotonergic ligands directly
into the dorsal raphe nucleus of 35 male rats. They also
employed the selective 5-HT2A antagonist EMD 281014
(7-[[4-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethyl]-1-piperazinyl]carbonyl]-
1H-indole-3-carbonitrile
hydrochloride)
and
the
5-HT2C–selective antagonist SB-243213 (2,3-dihydro-
5-methyl-N-[6-[(2-methyl-3-pyridinyl)oxy]-3-pyridinyl]-
6-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-indole-1-carboxamide), which
were microinjected into the DRN. Rats were implanted
with Nichrome electrodes to record EEG from the
frontal and occipital cortex and electromyography
activity from the neck musculature. Microinjection of
2.8- and 5.6-mmol doses (to note, the publication
erroneously reports millimolar doses) of DOI into the
DRN reduced REM sleep during the first and second
2 hours of recording. Microinjection of either the
5-HT2A–selective antagonist EMD 281014 or the
5-HT2C antagonist SB-243213 prevented the DOI-
induced suppression of REM. The authors argue that
DOI inhibits firing in the DRN by activating 5-HT2A and
5-HT2C receptors on GABAergic projection interneu-
rons that synapse on cholinergic neurons in the
laterodorsal tegmental and pedunculopontine tegmen-
tal nuclei that are involved in REM sleep.
In a similar study from the same laboratory, with rats
implanted for chronic sleep recordings, subcutaneous
DOI significantly increased waking and light sleep but
reduced slow wave sleep, REM sleep, and the number of
REM episodes (Monti and Jantos, 2006b). The 5-HT2A–
selective antagonist EMD 281014 blocked the DOI-
induced increase in waking and light sleep and
reduction of slow wave sleep, but REM sleep remained
suppressed. The 5-HT2C antagonist SB-243213 was
without effect on sleep effects induced by DOI. The
results suggest that 5-HT2A receptor–mediated mecha-
nisms are responsible for effects of DOI on waking and
slow wave sleep.
VII. Effects on Time Perception
One of the common subjectively perceived effects of
psychedelics is a strongly altered experience of time
(reviewed in Heimann, 1994). Brief periods, sometimes
Psychedelics
309
 a few minutes of clock time, may be perceived as having
been hours. Time may also be compressed. For example,
one LSD user indicated that he had watched the big
bang and the evolution of the universe all in the space of
only a few minutes. Animal studies of effects of psyche-
delics on time perception have been reported, a few of
which will be briefly discussed here. Two studies of time
perception after psilocybin administration to humans
have also been reported and are also reviewed here.
To study the effect of DOI on the ability of rats to
discriminate time intervals, Asgari et al. (2006a)
trained 20 female rats in a discrete-trials psychophys-
ical procedure to assess temporal discrimination. It had
been previously shown that stimulation of 5-HT2 recep-
tors disrupted temporal differentiation in the free-
operant
psychophysical
procedure. In
this
report,
50-second trials were carried out, with a light presented
for t seconds, after which two levers were presented. A
response on lever “A” was reinforced with a 45-mg food
pellet when trials were t , 25 seconds, and a response
on lever “B” was reinforced if t . 25 seconds, with a
series of different times t. DOI (various doses) and
ketanserin (2 mg/kg) were given subcutaneously, and
M100907 (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) was given by i.p. injection.
DOI (0.25 mg/kg) produced a significant increase in %B
12.5 seconds after trial onset and significant decreases
in %B at 32.5, 37.5, 42.5, and 47.5 seconds after trial
onset. DOI thus disrupted the rats’ ability to discrim-
inate durations of exteroceptive stimuli (temporal
discrimination). The 5-HT2A–selective antagonist
ketanserin had no effect by itself but completely
antagonized the effect of DOI. Likewise, 0.5 mg/kg
M100907 had no effect by itself but completely antag-
onized the effect of DOI, but only at the 47.5-second time
point. At 1.0 mg/kg, M100907 blocked the effect of DOI
at all time points . 22.5 seconds, except 37.5 seconds
after trial onset. Thus, DOI produced a dose-dependent
disruption of temporal discrimination that was most
evident at longer stimulus durations. The authors point
out that it is not clear whether the effect of DOI is
specific to the temporal dimension or whether it may
reflect a more general breakdown of stimulus control.
They also suggest the possibility that stimulus control is
relatively weak and may be more vulnerable to disrup-
tion at longer stimulus durations. These results are
similar to those of Body et al. (2003), who found that
DOI also altered temporal differentiation in the free-
operant psychophysical procedure in rats, an effect that
was similarly blocked by ketanserin.
Asgari et al. (2006b) examined the effect of (2)-DOI
(0.25 mg/kg, s.c.) on the fixed-interval peak procedure in
18 female rats. In fixed-interval trials (16 per session),
reinforcement (45-mg food pellets) was delivered after
the first response emitted after 30 seconds since the
start of the trial. In probe trials (16 per session), there
was no reinforcement and the response lever remained
in the chamber for 120 seconds. Fixed-interval and
probe trials were scheduled in a pseudo-random se-
quence. In probe trials, the response rate in trained
vehicle-treated rats reaches a peak time (tpeak, the peak
of the Gaussian component of the function) close to the
30-second designated time of reinforcer availability and
then subsequently declines. After vehicle treatment,
tpeak (33.2 6 1.3 seconds) was close to the scheduled
reinforcement time of 30 seconds. DOI significantly
decreased tpeak to 29.7 6 1.1 seconds and also reduced
peak response rate compared with controls, and the
effect was significantly antagonized by ketanserin
tartrate (2 mg/kg, s.c.).
Hampson et al. (2010) reported that in an ongoing
series of experiments, DOI had qualitatively different
effects on temporal differentiation and temporal dis-
crimination. They note that previous investigators
(Asgari et al., 2006a) suggested that the disruptive
effect of DOI on temporal discrimination might reflect a
general breakdown of stimulus control rather than a
specific interaction with timing processes. That is,
disruption of temporal discrimination by DOI might
reflect a global impairment of animals’ ability to
perform discriminative tasks. Therefore, one might
expect that DOI would also disrupt stimulus control
exerted by exteroceptive stimuli lacking temporal di-
mensions. These investigators tested this prediction by
comparing the effects of DOI on two dimensions of a
light stimulus: duration and intensity. Twelve female
Wistar rats were used for DOI experiments [the authors
also compared the effects of (+)-amphetamine] main-
tained at 80% of their free-feeding body weight. They
used a two-lever paradigm with apertures 5 cm above
and 2.5 cm on either side of a recess where 45-mg food
pellets were provided. A light-emitting diode was
located 2.5 cm above the food pellet delivery device
whose intensity (luminance in cd/m2) was varied by
computer control. Trials began with illumination of the
light-emitting diode above the central reinforcer recess
at an intensity of 22 cd/m2. For the temporal discrim-
ination procedure, after a predetermined time t, the two
levers were inserted into the chamber. A single re-
sponse on either lever resulted in withdrawal of both
levers, extinguishing of the light, and the chamber
remained dark until the start of the next trial. The
duration of stimulus presentation, t, in each trial varied
between 2.5 and 47.5 seconds. If t was shorter than 25
seconds (the mean duration), a response on lever A
resulted in reinforcer delivery, whereas a response on
lever B had no consequence. Conversely, if t was longer
than 25 seconds, a response on lever B resulted in
reinforcer delivery, whereas a response on lever A had
no consequence. For the light-intensity discrimination
procedure, stimulus duration t was kept at 25 seconds
for each trial, but the intensity of the light i varied in
10 distinct values between 3.6 and 128.5 cd/m2. If
i , 22 cd/m2 (the geometric mean of the intensity range),
a response on lever A resulted in reinforcer delivery,
310
Nichols
 whereas a response on lever B had no consequence.
Conversely, if i was greater than 22 cd/m2, a response on
lever B led to reinforcer delivery, whereas a response on
lever A did not. Doses of DOI were 0.0625, 0.125, and
0.25 mg/kg and were given 15 minutes prior to test
sessions.
In this temporal discrimination task, Hampson et al.
(2010) found that selection of lever B (%B) increased
progressively as a function of stimulus duration t. The
value of the indifference point T50, was close to
the midpoint of the range of durations (25 seconds). In
the light-intensity discrimination task, %B increased
progressively as a function of light intensity i. The value
of the indifference point I50 was close to the geometric
mean of the range of the light intensities (22 cd/m2).
DOI was found to flatten the psychometric function,
tending to displace it rightward, and increased the
Weber fraction, but only for temporal discrimination.
DOI at 0.25 mg produced a significant reduction of %B
on temporal discrimination but had no effect on in-
tensity discrimination. The authors present a detailed
statistical analysis that included slope « and Weber
fraction, but they conclude that that the impairment of
the precision with which the rats discriminated the
durations of the stimulus was not due to a general
disruption of stimulus control. Their results strongly
suggest that DOI has a greater effect on temporal
discrimination than on light-intensity discrimination.
Wittmann et al. (2007) carried out a study to elucidate
the role of the serotonin system in time perception and
temporal behavior. Theirs was the first study to sys-
tematically assess the effect of psilocybin on timing
performance on standardized measures of temporal
processing. They used a placebo-controlled, double-
blind design in 12 healthy volunteers, administering
placebo, a medium psilocybin dose of 115 mg/kg, or a
high psilocybin dose of 250 mg/kg. The standardized
measures of temporal processing included the temporal
reproduction, sensorimotor synchronization, and tap-
ping speed (personal and maximal). They tested spatial
working memory span using the spatial span test.
Psychometric measures included the 5D-ASC scale
and the AMRS.
Wittmann et al. (2007) reported that high-dose
psilocybin led to significant under-reproduction of time
intervals 4 seconds and longer. Psilocybin significantly
impaired the subject’s ability to reproduce interval
durations longer than 2.5 seconds, and it impaired the
ability to synchronize to interbeat interval durations
longer than 2 seconds. High-dose psilocybin also slowed
the personal preferred tapping rate to 949 milliseconds
from a baseline of 692 milliseconds but had no effect on
the maximum tapping rate. No effect at the medium
dose of psilocybin was observed. At the time of peak of
effects, high-dose psilocybin (but not the medium dose)
impaired spatial span task performance as indexed by
span length. The investigators indicate that the
disturbed timing abilities for sensorimotor synchroni-
zation and duration reproduction observed could reflect
impairments of short-term memory, attention, or
decision-making mechanisms. Given the selective effect
of psilocybin on longer-duration intervals in both the
temporal reproduction and sensory synchronization
tasks, it was suggested that the observed temporal
disturbance is induced through interference with cog-
nitive processes like attention and working memory.
In a subsequent study, Wackermann et al. (2008)
reanalyzed the data from the Wittmann et al. (2007)
study and added an additional group of nine subjects
that was administered a very low dose of psilocybin
(12 mg/kg). Their new analysis employed a “dual
klepsydra” model of duration reproduction. They mea-
sured changes in a dual klepsydra parameter desig-
nated k, which proved to be a sensitive measure of the
effect of a psychoactive substance on the internal
representation of time. The results were similar to those
from Wittmann et al. (2007), and the estimate of k was
significantly increased by psilocybin 90 minutes after the
drug was administered, which was interpreted to mean
that psilocybin led to a higher loss rate of the internal
duration representation.
VIII. Use of Animal Models
What can animal models tell us about the unique
psychopharmacology of psychedelics? Unfortunately,
they cannot tell us as much as one would wish.
Obviously, it is impossible to model the complexity of
the psychopharmacology induced by psychedelics in
humans with any nonhuman animal model. As far as
we know, animals administered a psychedelic do not
“hallucinate” or have the same sorts of sensory and
cognitive effects that occur in humans. As with all
animal models, the underlying assumption is that what
happens in the animal system parallels, at least to a
certain extent, what happens in the human. Fortu-
nately, the key brain target for psychedelics, the
serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, is a prominent player in
the brain physiology of all mammalian species and its
activation can produce measurable behaviors. Other
ancillary receptors that may be involved in the actions
of psychedelics, such as the serotonin 5-HT1A and
glutamate mGlu2 receptors, also appear to have similar
roles in the brain physiology of lower mammalian
species. Thus, the observation of a specific and consis-
tent behavior in an animal model after administration
of a known psychedelic, and the finding that the
behavior is primarily mediated by activation of the
serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, is usually taken as a strong
indication that the substance may have some sort of
psychedelic action in humans. In that respect, animal
models have most often been used to confirm an effect
that is already known in humans. For example, when a
new “research chemical” appears on the illicit market
Psychedelics
311
 and becomes popular for recreational use, animal
models can be used to understand how this chemical
compares with other known psychedelics. A sufficiently
large database of known compounds in mouse and rat
models has developed over the years so that it may be
possible in some cases to predict whether a new
chemical substance will possess psychedelic activity
based on a behavioral readout.
More important, however, has been the use of animal
models to dissect the underlying neuropharmacology
and physiology of psychedelics. During the past 5
decades, when human research was essentially non-
existent, numerous laboratories continued to study the
effects of psychedelics in animal models. In vitro and ex
vivo receptor binding studies, production of second
messenger signals, use of receptor-specific antagonists,
and even whole-animal imaging have given insight into
the possible pharmacological and neurochemical effects
of psychedelics. Indeed, many of those experiments
would have been impossible to carry out in humans.
The result has been a further and much more detailed
understanding of the role that the 5-HT2A receptor, and
other receptors, plays in normal brain function.
Although studies have appeared that employed psi-
locybin or LSD or a select few other agents, probably the
majority of animal experiments have used the “psyche-
delic” 5-HT2A agonist DOI. That is another unfortunate
consequence of the current drug laws. DOI has never
been popular as a recreational drug, nor has any clinical
study been carried out to compare its effects with classic
drugs such as LSD, mescaline, or psilocybin, and only
anecdotal reports of its human psychopharmacology
exist (e.g., Shulgin and Shulgin, 1991). Although DOI is
quite potent, it likely never became popular as a street
drug because of its very prolonged duration of action,
so it had never been placed into Schedule I of the
Controlled Substances Act (although as of November
2015, there are congressional moves afoot to change
that). Therefore, DOI has been commercially available
to qualified investigators and did not require a U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration license to work with
it. That situation is somewhat problematic because the
pharmacology of other psychedelics is often more com-
plex. For example, LSD has effects at a variety of
GPCRs other than the 5-HT2A receptor, the presumed
principal target for psychedelics. Although DOI appears
to be primarily an agonist at 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C
receptors, it lacks effects at most other receptors. By
contrast, psilocybin and many other tryptamines are
also agonists at the 5-HT1A receptor. Although it is
certainly true that the salient pharmacology of all
psychedelics in animal models seems to be an agonist
action at 5-HT2A receptors, the complex neuropharma-
cology of other types of psychedelics, especially LSD, is
not as well studied in animal models.
Overall, at least in rodent models, psychedelics seem
to exacerbate neophobia, increase responsiveness to
sensory stimulation, and interfere with response habit-
uation across multiple sensory modalities and behav-
ioral responses (Geyer and Vollenweider, 2008). A
review of the use of animal models of serotonergic
psychedelics was recently published (Hanks and
González-Maeso, 2013).
A. Rat Models
1. Drug Discrimination.
The drug discrimination
procedure in rats has proven to be a sensitive and
powerful technique that has allowed an analysis of the
neuropharmacology of many classes of drugs with an
action in the CNS, including the psychedelics. It has
been widely used in numerous laboratories, and the
topic of hallucinogens as discriminative stimuli was
recently reviewed (Winter, 2009). No attempt will be
made here to provide a comprehensive review of the
drug discrimination literature on psychedelics pub-
lished over the past 3 decades. Rather, a brief back-
ground and a few key experimental studies will be
highlighted. With respect to the popularity of rat drug
discrimination as a model for studying psychedelics,
about two to three times as many publications are listed
for the terms “rat drug discrimination” plus “hallucino-
gen” in the National Library of Medicine compared with
what is now probably the second most popular tech-
nique, the mouse head-twitch assay.
The drug discrimination assay is based on the fact
that rats can learn to recognize a drug-induced in-
teroceptive cue. The rat learns to discriminate the drug
effect (its interoceptive cue, or stimulus property) from
the nondrug effect by a process known as differential
reinforcement. The most popular method utilizes a two-
lever operant test chamber and either a FR or variable
interval (VI) schedule of reinforcement, whereby the rat
receives reinforcement only after responding on the
lever associated with administration of the training
drug (e.g., a psychedelic). Responding on the lever
associated with the nondrug treatment (e.g., saline)
usually has no consequence. Although negative foot-
shock reinforcement has been used on rare occasions,
positive reinforcement is the vastly more prevalent
method, usually using food pellets, diluted sweetened
condensed milk, or water as the reinforcer. Responding
is most robust when rats have had restricted access to
food or water in their home cages. Once the rat has
learned the discrimination task, dose-response curves
can be generated and an ED50 can be determined.
Specific antagonists can be used to assess the nature
of the discriminative cue by blocking responding to the
training drug, various treatments can be used to alter
levels and function of neurotransmitter systems, and
substitution tests can be performed with drugs sus-
pected of having pharmacology similar to the training
drug. Thus, the underlying pharmacological basis of the
interceptive cue produced by the training drug or drugs
with similar or identical pharmacology generally can be
312
Nichols
 elucidated, and experiments can be carried out that
most often could not be done in humans.
Historically, Hirschhorn and Winter (1971) published
the first report of a psychedelic producing a discrimina-
tive stimulus in rats. Using a 1-minute VI schedule of
reinforcement with diluted sweetened condensed milk
as the reinforcer, intraperitoneal injections of both LSD
and mescaline were shown to produce discriminative
stimuli in female rats. Based on testing of varying doses
Hirschhorn and Winter (1971) found that 40 mmol/kg
mescaline and 0.06 mmol/kg LSD were equivalent in
their ability to produce discriminated responding when
paired with saline. This potency ratio, approximately
670, is only 3- to 4-fold off from the ratio in humans
(approximately 2500). ED50 values in several rat drug
discrimination studies have been contrasted with their
dosages in humans and a general correlation is seen, as
shown in Table 1.
One of the features of drug discrimination that makes
it so powerful has been referred to as the “third state
hypothesis,” advanced by Frey and Winter (1978). This
principle essentially states that if an animal has been
trained to discriminate saline from some training drug
and another drug is administered, the animal will
respond as if given the training drug if, and only if,
the new drug has similar discriminative stimulus
properties. Even if the new drug has centrally mediated
effects on behavior, unless it has discriminative stimu-
lus properties qualitatively similar (or identical) to the
training drug, the animal will respond on the saline-
appropriate lever. Thus, when challenged with a new
drug, if the animal responds on the lever associated
with the training drug, it is essentially telling the
investigator “I think you gave me the training drug.”
The drug discrimination procedure does suffer from
the possibility of “false positives,” whereby the rat
responds on the lever associated with the training drug
after receiving a drug that is known not to have similar
psychopharmacology in humans. Appel et al. (2004)
described the series of detailed experiments used in
their laboratory to elucidate the nature of the intero-
ceptive cue induced by the nonhallucinogenic ergoline
lisuride, which produced a false positive in rats trained
to discriminate saline from LSD. Appel et al. (2004)
described the use of a variety of antagonists, a three-
lever drug discrimination procedure, as well as direct
intracerebroventricular injections. Today, the consen-
sus is that discriminative responding after psychedelic
administration is primarily mediated by an agonist or
partial agonist activity at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors
(Winter, 2009), and the most efficacious drug for
antagonizing hallucinogen-induced stimulus control is
the highly selective 5-HT2A antagonist M100907, as
first demonstrated by Schreiber et al. (1994). Fiorella
et al. (1995) used a series of nonselective 5-HT2A/5-HT2C
antagonists to demonstrate through antagonist corre-
lation analysis that 5-HT2A receptor activation is
primarily responsible for the stimulus effects of indole-
amine and phenethylamine psychedelics. A more de-
tailed historical background for this conclusion is
presented in Nichols (2004).
It had generally been assumed that the canonical PI
hydrolysis signaling pathway was the most relevant for
the behavioral actions of psychedelics, but there are
certain problems with this hypothesis. First, it is well
known that LSD has very low efficacy in activating PI
turnover (Sanders-Bush et al., 1988; Egan et al., 1998).
Subsequently, Rabin et al. (2002) pointed out the lack of
correlation between potency in drug substitution in rats
trained to discriminate LSD or DOM from saline and
efficacy in stimulating PI hydrolysis. They concluded
that 5-HT2A–mediated stimulation of PI hydrolysis does
not appear to be the sole critical signaling mechanism
involved in the discriminative effects of hallucinogens.
Similarly, Roth et al. (1997a) found no significant
relationship between high-affinity agonist binding and
ability to stimulate PI turnover, and they proposed that
additional transition states of the receptor-ligand com-
plex must be essential for agonist efficacy.
The site in the rat brain where the stimulus proper-
ties of LSD, and presumably other psychedelics, is
mediated has been identified as the ACC. Gresch et al.
(2007) combined drug discrimination in rats with in-
tracerebral microinjections of LSD into various brain
areas of rats. Rats were first trained to discriminate
subcutaneous injections of LSD from saline. After
training, rats were implanted with bilateral cannulae
in the ACC. Gresch et al. chose the ACC based on prior
studies in their laboratory that had shown increased
c-fos expression in the ACC, medial PFC, and amygdala
after an acute dose of LSD (Gresch et al., 2002).
Furthermore, they also had observed that behavioral
tolerance to repeated LSD administration was associ-
ated with decreased 5-HT2A receptor density in the
mPFC and ACC (Gresch et al., 2005). Reasoning that
the ACC was known to be involved in modulation of
complex behaviors, the authors therefore examined the
effect of bilateral infusion of LSD into the ACC. They
found that local infusion of LSD dose-dependently
substituted for systemically administered LSD, and
also that systemic administration of the highly selective
5-HT2A antagonist M100907 completely blocked the
stimulus effect of locally infused LSD.
That is not to say that other receptor systems have
not been identified as involved to some extent with
specific psychedelic agents. For example, Reissig et al.
(2005) examined the interoceptive cue produced by LSD
in a two-lever FR10 paradigm in rats. Once stimulus
control with LSD was established, they conducted
combination and substitution tests with 5-HT1A ago-
nists and antagonists. Among other results, they ob-
served an intermediate level of LSD substitution with
the 5-HT1A agonist, 8-OH-DPAT. Yet the training dose
of LSD was unaffected by the 5-HT1A–selective
Psychedelics
313
 antagonist WAY-100635. On the basis of all of their
results, Reissig et al. (2005) concluded that 5-HT1A
receptor agonists are able to modulate the discrimina-
tive stimulus effects of LSD given at short times before
testing, but that 5-HT1A receptor stimulation appears to
be a nonessential component of the LSD cue.
Winter et al. (2007) examined the stimulus properties
of psilocybin in the rat using drug discrimination with
an FR10 schedule of reinforcement with water. The
psilocybin stimulus was partially blocked by the 5-HT2A
selective antagonist M100907, but not by the 5-HT1A–
selective antagonist WAY-100635. A selective 5-HT2C
antagonist SB-24084 had only modest effects, arguing
against a contribution by 5-HT2C receptors.
Winter et al. (2000b) trained rats to discriminate 5-
MeO-DMT from saline, or (2)-DOM from saline. In rats
trained with 5-MeO-DMT, the 5-HT1A antagonists
pindolol and WAY-100635 both produced significant
attenuation of the 5-MeO-DMT stimulus, but the non-
selective 5-HT2A antagonist pirenperone produced an
intermediate degree of antagonism. In rats trained with
(2)-DOM, pirenperone but not WAY-100635 blocked
the stimulus. In rats trained with 5-MeO-DMT the
stimulus fully generalized to the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-
DPAT and only partially to (2)-DOM. After additional
similar experiments, the authors concluded that the 5-
MeO-DMT stimulus is mediated primarily by agonist
activity at 5-HT1A receptors, but that it produces a
compound stimulus that includes an element mediated
by 5-HT2A agonist action.
Gatch et al. (2009) trained male Sprague-Dawley rats
under an FR10 food-reinforced paradigm to discrimi-
nate DMT (5 mg/kg) from saline and then tested the
ability of LSD, R-(2)-DOM, (+)-methamphetamine, and
racemic MDMA to substitute in these rats. DMT also
was evaluated for drug-appropriate responding in rats
trained
to
discriminate
LSD,
DOM,
MDMA,
or
(+)-methamphetamine from saline. LSD, DOM, and
MDMA all fully substituted in DMT-trained rats, but
(+)-methamphetamine failed to substitute. DMT, LSD,
and MDMA all fully substituted in DOM-trained rats.
Again, however, (+)-methamphetamine failed to sub-
stitute in these rats. In rats trained to discriminate LSD
from saline, only DOM fully substituted, and DMT and
MDMA only partially substituted. Again (+)-metham-
phetamine did not substitute in LSD-trained rats.
When rats were trained to discriminate MDMA
from saline, LSD and (+)-methamphetamine fully
substituted, but DMT and DOM only partially
substituted. In rats trained to discriminate (+)-meth-
amphetamine
from
saline,
only
MDMA
fully
substituted. DOM, LSD, and MDMA produced full
substitution in DMT-trained rats, but DMT produced
full substitution only in DOM-trained rats. After a
detailed analysis of stimulus generalization between
the various drugs, the authors concluded that DMT
produces a discriminative stimulus that is similar to,
but not completely overlapping with, LSD, DOM, and
MDMA. DMT, DOM, and LSD were psychedelics lack-
ing psychostimulant effects.
Drug discrimination has also been used to determine
that LSD has time-dependent pharmacology. That is,
when LSD was given 30 minutes prior to training the
stimulus was, as expected, mediated by activation of the
5-HT2A receptor. However, when LSD was adminis-
tered 90 minutes prior to training, the cue was found to
be mediated by activation of the dopamine D4 receptor
(Marona-Lewicka et al., 2005, 2009, 2011; Marona-
Lewicka and Nichols, 2007, 2011). Thus, drug discrim-
ination has been used to define a temporal switch in the
nature of the interoceptive cue for LSD, from predom-
inant activation of the 5-HT2A receptor at short times

 before training to a primary action by stimulation of
dopamine D2 receptors at later times after administra-
tion. These experiments were described in greater
detail in the earlier section on the possible role of other
receptors.
2. Effects on Locomotor Activity.
Although not spe-
cific for psychedelics, studies of effects on locomotor and
open field behavior are simple to implement and are
often the first animal model to study. Krebs-Thomson
et al. (2006) reported that 5-MeO-DMT decreased
locomotor activity, investigatory behavior, and center
duration and disrupted prepulse inhibition (PPI) of
startle in rats. All of these effects were blocked by
pretreatment with the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635.
Pretreatment with the 5-HT2A selective antagonist
M100907 failed to attenuate any of these effects,
whereas the 5-HT2C antagonist SER-082 [(+)-cis
4,5,7a,8,9,10,11,11a-octahydro-7H-10-methylindolo
[1,7-bc][2,6]-naphthyridine] reduced only the 5-MeO-
DMT–induced disruption of PPI. In earlier studies, this
laboratory had reported that decreased locomotion,
investigatory behavior, and center behavior induced
by phenethylamine hallucinogens were mediated solely
by activation of 5-HT2A receptors, whereas the decrease
in locomotion produced by LSD was attenuated by a 5-
HT1A antagonist and the decrease in investigatory
behavior was antagonized by a 5-HT2A antagonist (see
references in Krebs-Thomson et al., 2006). There are
numerous studies that report effects of psychedelics on
motor activity, usually in the mouse, but because this
test is not specific, no additional reports will be
reviewed here.
3. Prepulse Inhibition.
PPI of acoustic startle refers
to the phenomenon that occurs when a weak prestimu-
lus attenuates the reaction to a subsequent ASR. PPI
serves as an operational measure of sensorimotor
gating, and psychedelics affect PPI not only in rodents
(Sipes and Geyer, 1994; Johansson et al., 1995; Padich
et al., 1996) but also in humans (Vollenweider et al.,
2007). Sipes and Geyer (1994) first reported that the
selective 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin blocked the
disruptive effects of DOI-induced PPI. In a later study,
dose-response studies showed that the selective 5-HT2A
antagonist, M100907, but not the 5-HT2C antagonist
SER-082, prevented the disruption of PPI induced by
DOI (Sipes and Geyer, 1995). These results support the
hypothesis that the 5-HT2A receptor is involved in the
modulation of sensorimotor gating. In a subsequent
study, infusion of DOI (1.0–5.0 mg/0.5 ml) into the
ventral pallidum (VP) disrupted PPI without having
effects on startle reactivity (Sipes and Geyer, 1997). By
contrast, DOI infusions into the nucleus accumbens, an
adjacent area also expressing 5-HT2A receptors, had no
effect on PPI or startle reactivity. Infusion of M100907
into the VP increased PPI by itself and attenuated the
PPI-disruptive effects of systemically administered
DOI. The authors concluded that 5-HT2A receptors
within the VP are important for the modulation of
PPI, presumably through interactions at intrinsic
GABAergic or cholinergic interneurons.
Similarly, Ouagazzal et al. (2001) demonstrated that
the decrease in PPI induced by LSD in rats also was
mediated by 5-HT2A receptors. The disruption of PPI
induced by LSD in Sprague-Dawley rats was completely
blocked by pretreatment with the highly selective 5-
HT2A antagonist M100907. Pretreatment with a 5-HT2C
antagonist, a 5-HT2B/2C antagonist, a 5-HT1A antago-
nist, a 5-HT6 antagonist, or the dopamine D2 antagonist
haloperidol all failed to affect the LSD-induced effect on
PPI.
Halberstadt and Geyer (2010) also characterized the
effect of LSD on the PPI in rats and compared it with the
nonhallucinogenic ergoline lisuride. It had previously
been shown that lisuride did not evoke the head twitch
in mice (González-Maeso et al., 2007). Although lisuride
was found to decrease PPI, this effect was not blocked by
the 5-HT2A antagonist MDL11939 or the 5-HT1A antag-
onist WAY-100635, but was blocked by the dopamine
D2/3 antagonist raclopride. Thus, lisuride disruption of
the PPI is mediated by dopamine D2/3 receptors. By
contrast, the disruption of PPI by LSD was significantly
attenuated by MDL11939, again illustrating that the
disruption of PPI induced by psychedelics is mediated
by activation of the 5-HT2A receptor.
Wischhof et al. (2012) investigated interactions be-
tween 5-HT2A receptors and mGlu2/3 receptors in the
rat PPI and ASR. Rats were randomly injected with
either vehicle or the mGlu2/3 agonist LY379268 (0.5
mg/kg, i.p.) 20 minutes prior to DOI (3 mg/kg, s.c.) or
vehicle. Ten minutes after the second injection, rats
were placed into the PPI chambers. DOI reduced PPI
and ASR in Wistar, but not in Lister Hooded rats.
Pretreatment of Wistar rats with LY379268 (1 mg/kg)
attenuated the DOI-induced PPI disruption and re-
duction of ASR magnitude. LY379268 had no effect on
PPI when given alone and only slightly increased
magnitude of the ASR. Their data are consistent with
the notion of functionally antagonistic interactions be-
tween 5-HT2A and mGlu2/3 receptors that might regu-
late sensorimotor gating mechanisms.
B. Mouse Models
Although mice have become more popular for study-
ing the action of psychedelics in the past decade or so,
their physiology and pharmacological responses are
probably not as similar to humans as are those of rats.
Mice, however, have the advantage of being signifi-
cantly less expensive to purchase and maintain than
rats or other higher mammals; perhaps more impor-
tantly, the ability to create transgenic mouse lines
represents a significant advantage over other mamma-
lian models.
The first test of a psychedelic in the mouse was
reported by Woolley (1955), in which mice administered
Psychedelics
315
 LSD predominantly walked backward in a prone posi-
tion, as if backing up on an inclined plane. Although
that observation proved not to be particularly informa-
tive, two mouse models have, however, been useful in
dissecting
the
neuropharmacology
of
psychedelics:
mouse HTR and mouse drug discrimination.
1. Head Twitch Response.
Keller and Umbreit
(1956) administered LSD intravenously to mice and
reported “…a rapid and violent head shaking” that did
not occur in normal mice. They indicated that it was
easily observed, that independent observers could re-
liably detect the behavior, and that this HTR in mice
“provided a suitable tool for the behavioral studies”
(Keller and Umbreit, 1956). Subsequently, the mouse
HTR was observed in mice after administration of 5-
hydroxytryptophan, the biochemical precursor to sero-
tonin (Corne et al., 1963). Corne and Pickering (1967),
based on a study that involved several classic
psychedelics that included DMT, LSD, mescaline, and
psilocybin, as well as nonhallucinogenic compounds,
proposed that the mouse HTR might correlate with
the production of drug-induced hallucinations in hu-
mans. Subsequently, numerous studies have been
reported using the HTR to assess potential psychedelic
activity (e.g., Silva and Calil, 1975; Yamamoto and
Ueki, 1981; Darmani et al., 1990b; Fantegrossi et al.,
2005, 2015; González-Maeso et al., 2007; Fox et al., 2010;
Halberstadt and Geyer, 2014; Nichols et al., 2015).
The head twitch in mice is operationally defined as a
rapid rhythmic paroxysmal side-to-side rotational head
movement that occurs after administration of seroto-
nergic hallucinogens (Halberstadt and Geyer, 2011).
Although it has most often been visually scored in real
time, or scored from videos taken during the drug effect,
Halberstadt and Geyer (2013a) recently developed an
automated and relatively rapid method for assessing
the mouse HTR. They first analyzed the kinematics of
head
twitches
using
high-speed
video
recordings,
reporting that the HTR was highly rhythmic, occurring
within a specific frequency range (mean head move-
ment frequency of 90.3 Hz). On the basis of this analysis,
they developed a system using a head-mounted magnet
and a magnetometer coil, followed by extensive valida-
tion using video analysis and an observer blind to the
treatment. This advancement allows the HTR to be
used as a fairly rapid high-throughput assay that has
eliminated the need for tedious visual scoring by an
observer, and it gives reliable, unbiased, and reproduc-
ible results. Use of the mouse HTR to study psychedelics
has recently been reviewed (Fantegrossi et al., 2008a;
Canal and Morgan, 2012; Halberstadt and Geyer,
2013a; Hanks and González-Maeso, 2013).
The power of the HTR is the fact that mice do not
require training and it is a response to activation of
cortical serotonin 5-HT2A receptors (Darmani et al.,
1990a; Schreiber et al., 1995; Dursun and Handley,
1996; González-Maeso et al., 2003, 2007; Carbonaro
et al., 2015). Mice null for the 5-HT2A receptor gene fail
to show a HTR in response to DOI (González-Maeso
et al., 2003), and restoration of cortical 5-HT2A expres-
sion rescued HTR behavior (González-Maeso et al.,
2007).
Furthermore,
lisuride
is
an
ergoline
with
5-HT2A agonist activity that is not hallucinogenic in
humans and also fails to induce the HTR in mice
(González-Maeso et al., 2003, 2007).
Tolerance and changes in receptor functional sensi-
tivity can also develop in response to repeated admin-
istration of psychedelics (at least to DOI) and are
reflected in the HTR assay. Darmani et al. (1992)
administered a single 2.5 mg/kg injection of DOI. A
challenge dose 24 hours later resulted in a significant
41% reduction in the total HTR score. Surprisingly, a
challenge dose of DOI 48 hours later showed a signifi-
cant 51% increase in the number of HTR. This super-
sensitivity persisted for up to 6 days after the first DOI
injection but decreased over time, so that the HTR
response had returned to control levels 8 days after
the initial DOI injection. Chronic DOI administration
also was examined by giving mice daily injections of
2.5 mg/kg DOI for 13 days. Daily HTR responses to DOI
injections were reduced from 24 hours after the first
injection, through day 5, when they returned to the
value observed on day 1.
Dougherty and Aloyo (2011) examined mouse HTR
responding after chronic DOI administration or the
selective 5-HT2A antagonist MDL11939. Mice were
administered 1 mg/kg DOI every day for 8 days, or
2.95 mg/kg MDL11939 daily for either 4 or 8 days.
Twenty-four hours after the last treatment, mice were
challenged with 0.75 mg/kg DOI, and HTR behavior was
scored. Densities of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors in the
mouse whole cortex also were assessed 24 hours after
the last drug treatment using competition binding with
[3H]ketanserin or [3H]mesulergine, respectively. Eight
days of DOI treatment led to a 41% reduction in Bmax for
5-HT2A receptors, with a slight but nonsignificant
increase in Kd. Neither 4 nor 8 days of chronic treatment
with MDL11939 had any significant effect on 5-HT2A
density or function. Mice showed tolerance to the
behavioral effects of DOI that began 24 hours after
the first dose of DOI and persisted to the end of the
experiment. The significant reduction in HTR re-
sponses was consistent with the decreased density of
cortical 5-HT2A receptors. After chronic treatment with
MDL11939, however, a challenge dose of 0.75 mg/kg
DOI gave a HTR not significantly different from vehicle-
treated mice. This result was also consistent with the lack
of effect of chronic MDL11939 on cortical 5-HT2A receptor
density. The authors cite five earlier studies (Table 7 in
Dougherty and Aloyo, 2011) that all reported similar
findings, in which changes in 5-HT2A receptor density
were correlated with changes in the number of HTRs.
Qu et al. (2005) used PLA2 as a measure of regional
brain activation in SERT KO mice (SERT2/2) and their
316
Nichols
 littermate controls (WT; SERT+/+). Unanesthetized
mice were injected intravenously with [3H]AA and the
regional coefficient of incorporation k* of AA from
plasma into phospholipids of individual brain regions
was subsequently measured by quantitative autoradi-
ography in 71 different brain regions. In WT mice,
administration of DOI significantly increased k* in 27
regions known to express 5-HT2A/2C receptors. By
contrast, DOI did not increase k* in any brain region
of SERT(2/2) mice. Furthermore, the HTR was robust in
WT mice after DOI administration but was markedly
attenuated in SERT(2/2) mice. As Rioux et al. (1999)
had previously shown, SERT(2/2) mice had a significant
32% reduction in the density of 5-HT2A receptors in
cortical membranes. Thus, the results were interpreted to
mean that elevated levels of synaptic 5-HT led to down-
regulation of 5-HT2A/2C–mediated PLA2 signaling, as well
as to marked and significant reduction in the HTR.
Although the mouse HTR is clearly mediated by
activation of the 5-HT2A receptor, other neurotransmit-
ter systems can modulate the response. With respect to
the study of psychedelics, activation of the 5-HT2C
receptor has been shown to mask the 5-HT2A
receptor–induced head twitch in the rat (Vickers et al.,
2001). Fantegrossi et al. (2010) noted that phenethyl-
amine psychedelics typically have a biphasic dose-effect
curve in the HTR assay. It is well known that phenethyl-
amine psychedelics such as DOI have similar affinities
and functional effects at both 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C
receptors. Thus, Fantegrossi et al. (2010) proposed that
the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors may functionally
interact to produce the biphasic dose-response effect in
the mouse HTR. That is, activation of the 5-HT2A
receptor at low doses of drug might be responsible for
the ascending limb of the dose-response curve, whereas
activation of the 5-HT2C receptor by higher doses might
be responsible for the descending limb of the curve. Their
experimental results were consistent with this hypothe-
sis. The 5-HT2A selective antagonist M100907 shifted the
DOI dose response to the right but did not alter the
descending limb of the curve. The 5-HT2C–selective
agonist Ro60-0175 [(S)-6-chloro-5-fluoro-1H-indole-2-
propanamine] decreased the DOI-induced HTR in Swiss
NIH mice, whereas the 5-HT2C–selective antagonist
RS102221 [N-{5-[5-(2,4-dioxo-1,3,8-triazaspiro[4.5]dec-8-
yl)pentanoyl]-2,4-dimethoxyphenyl}-4-(trifluoromethyl)
benzenesulfonamide] produced a rightward shift in the
descending limb of the dose-response curve to DOI, and
had no effect on the ascending limb.
Surprisingly, and in contrast with these results,
Canal et al. (2010) reported that the mouse HTR was
significantly attenuated in 5-HT2C KO mice and was
significantly reduced by pretreatment of WT mice with
the 5-HT2C antagonists. Further research may be
warranted to clarify this issue, but all investigators
appear to agree that 5-HT2C receptors may play a
modulatory role in the HTR.
Fantegrossi et al. (2006) demonstrated that 5-MeO-
DIPT induced the head twitch in mice, and the effect
was antagonized by pretreatment with the 5-HT2A–
selective antagonist M100907. The affinity of 5-MeO-
DIPT was measured at rat 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C
receptors using antagonist radioligands, with Ki values
determined to be 35 nM, 5620 nM, and 1700 nM,
respectively. Thus, despite the higher affinity for
5-MeO-DIPT at the 5-HT1A receptor, the head twitch
was mediated through the 5-HT2A receptor.
Although much more has been discussed earlier
about the role of glutamate in the actions of psyche-
delics, it is known that glutamate systems are also
important in the mouse HTR. Moreno et al. (2011) found
that the DOI- or LSD-elicited HTR was completely
abolished in mGluR2-KO mice. They also carried out
[3H]ketanserin saturation binding experiments in fron-
tal cortex membranes from KO mice and found no
decrease in Kd or Bmax, compared with WT mice.
By contrast, Kłodzinska et al. (2002) showed that
30-minute pretreatment of mice with the mGlu2/3
agonists LY354740 and LY379268 significantly decreased
(by 64%–70%) head twitches induced by 2.5 mg/kg
DOI intraperitoneally. Activation of mGlu2/3 receptors,
which are localized presynaptically and serve as autor-
eceptors, would therefore be expected to suppress
glutamate release from terminals. Their findings par-
allel an earlier study by Gewirtz and Marek (2000), who
also had shown that a 30-minute pretreatment with
the mGlu2/3 agonist LY354740 suppressed 5.0 mg/kg
DOI–induced HTR in the mouse. In addition, these
researchers also demonstrated that the mGlu2/3 antag-
onist LY341495 enhanced the frequency of the DOI-
induced HTR. These studies all show that a functional
mGlu2/3 receptor system is required for expression of
the mouse HTR. An earlier section discussed in more
detail what is currently known about the role of
glutamate in the actions of psychedelics.
2. Drug Discrimination.
Although drug discrimina-
tion has been used for studies of psychedelics in rats for
several decades, more recently it has been applied to
studies in mice. Although mice are thought not to be as
similar to humans as rats, their care and maintenance
is more economical than rats. In addition, transgenic
mice have been developed with targeted mutations of
specific genes, which serve as powerful tools to study
mechanisms of drug action. The reader is again referred
to the review of drug discrimination in animals by
Winter (2009).
The first report of drug discrimination studies of a
psychedelic in mice was by Smith et al. (2003). They
trained C57BL/6J mice in a two-lever paradigm to
discriminate racemic DOI from saline on a 30-second
VI schedule of reinforcement. Mice readily acquired the
DOI-saline discrimination task, and the investigators
report that the most significant difference between rats
and mice was that mice required a dose of 2.5 mg/kg for
Psychedelics
317
 acquisition of the discrimination, whereas rats required
only 0.75 mg/kg in their earlier studies. Mice also had
markedly
higher
response
rates
than
rats
when
responding on either the saline or training drug lever.
The DOI stimulus had a rapid onset of slightly more
than 5 minutes and had begun to decay by 60 minutes
postinjection, which was more rapid than in rats,
suggesting that mice metabolize DOI more quickly than
rats. Both LSD and R-(2)-DOB completely substituted
in these mice, and the DOI stimulus was blocked by the
5-HT2A–selective antagonist M100907. Surprisingly,
Smith et al. (2003) also found that the DOI stimulus
was partially blocked by the 5-HT2B/2C antagonist SB-
206553 and was blocked by the selective 5-HT2C
antagonist SB-242084. They interpreted these results
to indicate that the discriminative stimulus properties
of DOI in mice have a 5-HT2C–mediated component,
whereas the cue is mediated solely by the 5-HT2A
receptor in rats.
Winter et al. (2005) examined the stimulus properties
of LSD in C57BL/6 mice. Using a left or right nose-poke
operant on a FR10 water reinforced task, mice were
trained with 0.17 or 0.30 mg/kg LSD subcutaneously or
saline (15-minute pretreatment). Only 6 of 16 mice
could be trained at the low dose of LSD, but 11 of 16
could be trained at the higher dose. In mice trained at
the lower dose of LSD (0.17 mg/kg), stimulus control
was present for at least 30 minutes but then rapidly
declined over the following 30 minutes. When mice were
administered the lower dose of LSD in combination
with the selective 5-HT2A antagonist M100907, LSD-
appropriate responding was reduced to approximately
50%, accompanied by a decrease in response rate.
M100907 when given alone also had a significant rate-
suppressant effect compared with vehicle. In mice
trained at the higher dose of LSD, full generalization
of the LSD stimulus occurred to R-(2)-DOM. The
authors suggest that “certain non-5-HT2A–mediated
elements in the compound stimulus induced by LSD
may be more salient in the mouse than in the rat”
(Winter et al., 2005).
Similarly, Benneyworth et al. (2005) examined the
discriminative stimulus properties of LSD in C57BL/6J
mice using a 30-second VI schedule of reinforcement.
After initial experiments revealed a very short duration
of action for LSD, they used 0.45 mg/kg subcutaneously,
with a preinjection interval of 10 minutes and 15-
minute training sessions. The response rate also de-
creased
significantly
with
higher
doses
of
LSD.
R-(2)-DOB fully substituted in LSD-trained mice, with
a much longer duration of action than LSD. Substitu-
tion tests with the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT also
produced a dose-dependent increase in LSD lever
selection, with the highest dose giving 60% LSD lever
selection. Similar to the results reported by Winter et al.
(2005), the selective 5-HT2A antagonist M100907 gave
only a partial blockade, down to 44% LSD lever
selection. By contrast, M100907 completely blocked
LSD lever selection in substitution tests with R-(2)-DOB.
The 5-HT1A receptor–selective antagonist WAY-100635
also partially blocked the LSD stimulus. The authors
note that the stimulus time course for both LSD and
R-(2)-DOB is consistent with them having a more rapid
pharmacokinetic profile in mice than in rats. Based on
the partial block of the LSD stimulus by M100907, the
partial substitution of 8-OH-DPAT, and the partial
blockade of the LSD stimulus by WAY-100635, the
authors hypothesize that the LSD stimulus has a
significant 5-HT1A receptor component in mice, whereas
the LSD stimulus appears to be solely mediated by
5-HT2A receptor activation in rats.
Krall et al. (2008) investigated stimulus control by
LSD in C57BL/6 mice that were homozygous for the
SERT null mutation (SERT2/2). They used a chamber
with two snout-poke holes and an FR20 schedule of
water reinforcement. They employed both a 0.17 and
0.30 mg/kg subcutaneous dose of LSD. Stimulus control
could be achieved only in 3 of 13 SERT KO mice at the
0.17-mg/kg dose of LSD. Increasing the LSD training
dose to 0.30 mg/kg led to 1 of 10 of the remaining mice
reaching criterion (total mice reaching criterion at both
doses was only 31%). By contrast, Krall et al. (2008)
reported that 9 of 10 WT mice reached criterion at 0.30
mg/kg LSD. They note that when KO mice were trained
to discriminate a visual stimulus, 85% of the mice
exhibited operant behavior, whereas 100% of the WT
mice reached criterion. Elevated synaptic levels of
serotonin occur in the SERT KO mice, which would be
expected to lead to receptor downregulation. Indeed, Li
et al. (2000) showed that SERT KO mice have reduced
densities of 5-HT1A receptors, and Rioux et al. (1999)
demonstrated reduced 5-HT2A receptors in SERT KO
mice. Both of these receptors would appear to be key
components of the LSD cue. Interestingly, in a later
study, Li et al. (2003) reported that 5-HT2A receptor
density was reduced only in the claustrum and ventral
striatum of SERT KO mice, whereas Rioux et al. (1999)
reported decreased expression of 5-HT2A receptors also
in the cortex.
3. Effects on Locomotor Activity.
Although psyche-
delics can increase locomotor activity in mice, this test is
not specific for them. Nonetheless, several laboratories
have investigated the pharmacological basis for in-
creased locomotor activity in mice after administration
of psychedelics. Low to moderate doses of DOI (0.625–5
mg/kg) increased locomotor activity in C57BL/6 mice,
measured as distance traveled, whereas higher doses
(5–20 mg/kg) reduced it (Halberstadt et al., 2009). DOI
administration produced an inverted U-shaped dose-
response function in WT mice but had no effect on
locomotor activity in 5-HT2A KO mice. The hypoactivity
seen after 10 mg/kg DOI in WT mice was prolonged in
5-HT2A KO mice. Furthermore, pretreatment with the
5-HT2C/2B antagonist SER-082 attenuated the decrease
318
Nichols
 in locomotor activity induced by 10 mg/kg DOI. The
5-HT2C–selective
agonist
WAY-161503
[(R)-8,9-
dichloro-2,3,4,4a-tetrahydro-1H-pyrazino[1,2-a]quinox-
alin-5(6H)-one] also reduced distance traveled by WT
mice, and this effect was blocked by SER-082. The
locomotor suppressant effect of WAY-161503 was en-
hanced in 5-HT2A KO mice. These data were interpreted
to mean that the decreased locomotor activity after 10
mg/kg DOI was mediated by activation of 5-HT2C
receptors.
The
authors
suggest
that
5-HT2A
and
5-HT2C receptors exert opposing effects on locomotor
activity, similar to their proposed role in the HTR, as
discussed earlier. Numerous studies have provided
evidence that 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors exert
functionally opposed activity (Bergqvist et al., 1999;
Pozzi et al., 2002; Winstanley et al., 2004; Alex et al.,
2005; Ramos et al., 2005; Bubar and Cunningham,
2006, 2007), especially with respect to CNS dopamine
systems (Carli and Samanin, 1992; Ruotsalainen et al.,
1997; Koskinen et al., 2000a,b; Passetti et al., 2003;
Winstanley et al., 2003, 2004).
Based on literature indicating a functional interaction
between the 5-HT2A and mGlu5 receptors, Halberstadt
et al. (2011b) tested the hypothesis that 5-HT2A recep-
tors are involved in the locomotor hyperactivity
exhibited by mGlu5 receptor KO mice. They tested the
effects of DOM, and the selective 5-HT2A antagonist
M100907, on locomotor activity in the mouse BPM in
mGlu5 WT and KO mice on a C57 background. Male and
female mGlu5 KO mice had increased locomotor activity
and reduced locomotor habituation compared with WT
animals during the last 40 minutes of testing. mGlu5
KO mice also had significantly more rearing than WT
mice after vehicle treatment. The mGlu5 negative
allosteric modulator MPEP (30 mg/kg) also significantly
increased locomotor activity in WT mice, measured as
distance traveled, during the first 50 minutes of the 1-
hour test session, but had no effect on activity in mGlu5
KO animals. DOM (0.5. mg/kg) increased locomotor
activity in WT mice, but only during the third 10-minute
block of testing, whereas DOM significantly and mark-
edly increased locomotor activity in all six 10-minute
blocks of testing in mGlu5 KO mice. Locomotor hyper-
activity in mGlu5 KO mice was significantly attenu-
ated by 1.0 mg/kg M100907, and M100907 completely
blocked the hyperactivity induced by MPEP. One
possible explanation offered by Halberstadt et al.
(2011b) is that the loss of mGlu5 signaling may lead to
increased 5-HT release, which activates the 5-HT2A
receptor (see Stachowicz et al., 2007). The DOM poten-
tiation of activity in mGlu5 KO mice could also be
attributed to enhanced sensitivity of 5HT2A receptors in
these mice, and the authors suggest that the mGlu5
receptor may regulate responses to 5-HT2A activation.
Thus, they conclude that the mGlu5 receptor acts to
attenuate 5-HT2A receptor–induced hyperactivity, and
either the loss of the mGlu5 receptor, or a negative
allosteric regulator of mGlu5, essentially unmasks the
influence of the 5-HT2A receptor.
Halberstadt et al. (2013) tested a series of phenyl-
alkylamine psychedelics in C57BL/6J mice using the
BPM to determine whether they increased locomotor
activity by activating the 5-HT2A receptor. Low doses of
mescaline, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylamphetamine (DOEt),
2,5-dimethoxy-4-n-propylamphetamine (DOPr), 2,4,5-
trimethoxyamphetamine (TMA-2), and 4-bromo-3,6-
dimethoxybenzocyclobuten-1-yl)methylamine (TCB-2)
increased locomotor activity, whereas a nonhallucino-
genic phenethylamine DOTB did not alter activity at any
dose tested. The selective 5-HT2A antagonist M100907
blocked the locomotor hyperactivity induced by mesca-
line and TCB-2. Notably, mescaline and TCB-2 did not
increase locomotor activity in 5-HT2A KO mice. Their
results confirm that low doses of serotonergic psyche-
delics increase locomotor activity through activation of
the 5-HT2A receptor.
C. Rabbit Models
The rabbit has not been widely used as an animal
model to study the effects of psychedelics, but a number
of experiments in this species have been carried out over
the past decade, primarily in the laboratory of the late
John A. Harvey. These studies have examined the
rabbit head-bobbing response, as well as associative
learning. Aloyo et al. (2001) first described the pro-
duction of head bobs by DOI in the rabbit. They found
that daily injections of the 5-HT2A agonists DOI, LSD,
and the antagonist 2-bromo-lysergic acid-N,N-diethyla-
mide (BOL) led to decreased cortical 5-HT2A receptor
density but had no effect on density of cortical 5-HT2C
receptors. Daily treatment with the highly selec-
tive 5-HT2A antagonist MDL11939 surprisingly in-
creased 5-HT2A receptor density by 60%, with no effect
on 5-HT2C receptor levels. DOI-elicited head bobs were
decreased by prior chronic treatment with DOI, LSD, or
BOL, whereas DOI-induced head bobs increased after
chronic treatment with MDL11939, consistent with the
idea that head bob behavior in rabbits is mediated by
the 5-HT2A receptor.
Dave et al. (2002) reported that systemic admin-
istration of DOI to New Zealand white rabbits
dose-dependently elicited head movements (vertical
down-up head bobs) and body shakes (a paroxysmal
shudder of the head, neck, and trunk combined, similar
to wet dog shakes in rodents). They reported that head
bobs were mediated by 5-HT2A receptor activation,
whereas body shakes were mediated by activity at the
5-HT2C receptor. The same workers carried out exper-
iments to determine whether the two behaviors were
mediated by a central or peripheral action (Dave et al.,
2004b). They found that pretreatment with xylamidine,
a peripherally acting 5-HT2A/2C antagonist, had no
effect on DOI-elicited head bobs, even at a high
dose. By contrast, systemic xylamidine significantly
Psychedelics
319
 attenuated DOI-elicited body shakes. Intracerebroven-
tricular administration of DOI significantly increased
head bobs, but not the number of body shakes. Intra-
cerebroventricular administration of either ketanserin
or xylamidine significantly attenuated DOI-elicited
head bobs but had no effect on DOI-elicited body shakes.
These data were interpreted to mean that head bob
behavior was mediated by central 5-HT2A receptors,
whereas body shakes were mediated by 5-HT2C recep-
tors located either peripherally, or else in brain areas
not accessible to infusions of DOI into the lateral
ventricle.
In a subsequent study, Dave et al. (2004a) examined
the role of the hippocampus in 5HT2A receptor–
mediated head bobs in the rabbit. Rabbits received
bilateral injections of DOI into the CA1 region of the
hippocampus after either saline pretreatment or hippo-
campal administration of MDL11939, the selective
5-HT2A antagonist. Head bobs induced by intrahippo-
campal DOI were blocked by prior treatment with
hippocampal MDL11939. Three different cohorts of
animals were injected chronically, once a day for 8 days,
with MDL11939. In the first cohort, density and affinity
of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors in the hippocampus was
determined by radioligand binding studies. In the
second group, brains were examined by quantitative
autoradiography using [125I]DOI. The third group was
implanted with bilateral cannulas into the hippocam-
pus. Radioligand binding studies in the first cohort
found that chronic MDL11939 led to a significant 88%
increase in receptor density with no change in Kd. In the
second group, quantitative autoradiography revealed
that animals chronically treated with MDL11939 had a
significant 232% increase in receptor density in the CA1
field and a significant 231% increase in the dentate
gyrus, compared with vehicle-injected controls. In the
third group, after chronic MDL11939 administration,
DOB was directly infused into the dorsal hippocampus
24 hours after the last MDL11939 injection. In this
experiment, DOI elicited almost twice as many head
bobs as in vehicle-treated control animals.
Harvey (2003) reviewed evidence showing that 5-
HT2A receptor activation can enhance associative learn-
ing. He focused on studies of classic conditioning of the
rabbit nictitating membrane response (a component of
the eyeblink) because it is acknowledged to provide a
reliable measure of associative learning (see references
in Harvey, 2003). The mPFC and hippocampal areas
have a high density of 5-HT2A receptors that are
critically involved in acquisition of the rabbit eyeblink
response during trace-conditioning procedures. LSD
and DOM are both psychedelic 5-HT2A agonists that
enhance acquisition of the rabbit eyeblink response, and
their effects are blocked by 5-HT2A silent antagonists.
Silent antagonists have no effect on the eyeblink re-
sponse when given alone. Interestingly, MDL11939,
ritanserin, and mianserin blocked the effect of LSD and
DOM on the eyeblink response; however, when these
drugs were given by themselves, they retarded learning,
consistent with inverse agonist activity at the 5-HT2A
receptor, suggesting that the 5-HT2A receptor that
mediates associative learning is constitutively active.
In a study reported by Harvey et al. (2004), rabbits
received
eight
daily
injections
of
LSD,
BOL,
or
MDL11939 followed 1 day, or 8 days later by eight daily
60-minute trace-conditioning sessions. Radioligand
binding studies with [3H]ketanserin were used to
estimate 5-HT2A receptor density in cortex of rabbits
injected with MDL11939 for 8 days. Chronic MDL11939
administration led to a significant 62% increase in
5-HT2A receptor binding in the frontal cortex at 24
hours after the last MDL11939 injection, but there was
no change in Kd. Receptor density still remained at 48%
above saline control 4 days after the last MDL11939
treatment, but it returned to basal levels between days
4 and 6. Chronic MDL11939 led to a significant
enhancement of the conditioned response when animals
were tested one day after the last MDL11939 injection.
MDL11939-treated animals also achieved a higher rate
of conditioned response acquisition compared with
controls. Animals who began acquisition training 8 days
after the last MDL11939 injection, at a time when
5-HT2A receptor levels would have returned to baseline,
demonstrated no significant difference from controls.
Surprisingly, LSD and BOL, which produced 33% and
55% decreases in 5-HT2A receptor density, respectively,
had no effect on conditioned response acquisition.
Romano et al. (2006) examined the effect of serotonin
depletion on eyeblink conditioning by bilateral intra-
cerebroventricular administration of 5,7-dihydroxy-
tryptamine. They achieved up to 85% and 90%
depletion of serotonin in the cortex and hippocampus,
respectively. Serotonin depletion failed to change the
expression of 5-HT2A receptors, however, and had no
significant effect on acquisition of trace classic condi-
tioning. Serotonin depletion likewise had no effect on
the enhancement of learning produced by LSD or on the
retardation of learning produced by MDL11939. It was
concluded that acquisition was regulated by constitu-
tive activity of the 5-HT2A receptor.
In another study, Dave et al. (2007) were able to relate
the production of head bobs to 5-HT2A receptor density
in the cortex. DOI was infused bilaterally into the
mPFC. BOL and MDL11939 were injected subcutane-
ously prior to DOI administration to block acute effects
of DOI or were given as eight daily injections for studies
of chronic effects on 5-HT2A receptor density. Receptor
expression was estimated by radioligand competition
binding using [3H]ketanserin. The number of head bobs
induced by DOI was significantly blocked by pretreat-
ment with MDL11939 or BOL. Chronic administration
of MDL11939 led to a significant increase in DOI-
induced head bobs compared with vehicle pretreatment,
with a significant 40% increase 24 hours after the first
320
Nichols
 MDL11939 injection and an 85% increase above con-
trols after the eighth injection. A significant 30% in-
crease in 5-HT2A receptor density was seen in cortex 24
hours after the first MDL11939 injection, increasing to
81% above controls after the eighth injection. These
increases roughly parallel the increases seen in DOI-
induced head bobs after MDL11939 treatments. By
contrast, chronic BOL significantly reduced the number
of DOI-induced head bobs to 19%, 12%, and 11% of
controls, respectively. Perhaps not surprisingly, 5-HT2A
receptor density was reduced by chronic BOL adminis-
tration, with receptor density reduced by 40% 24 hours
after the eighth injection. The authors found a high and
significant correlation between the density of frontal
cortical 5-HT2A receptors and the elicitation of head
bobs for animals given chronic MDL11939 or BOL.
In a later study, Schindler et al. (2012) reported that
both the 5-HT2A and dopamine D1 receptors were
required for rabbit head bob behavior. They carried
out experiments similar to earlier ones from their
laboratory, confirming that LSD and DOI elicit
head bobs by 5-HT2A activation, but also finding
that
SCH23390
[7-chloro-3-methyl-1-phenyl-1,2,4,5-
tetrahydro-3-benzazepin-8-ol], a selective D1 dopamine
antagonist could block head bobs induced by both LSD
and DOI.
Finally, Schindler et al. (2013) reported that rabbit
head bobs induced by DOI, but not LSD, were mediated
by activation of PLC, the canonical signaling pathway
coupled to the 5-HT2A receptor. In this work, both DOI-
and LSD-stimulated PI hydrolysis was measured as
release of [3H]inositol-4-phosphate in rabbit frontocort-
ical tissue prisms. DOI-stimulated PI hydrolysis was
blocked by the 5-HT2A–selective antagonist ketanserin.
The LSD signal was not blocked by ketanserin,
however, but was antagonized by a 5-HT2B/2C–
selective antagonist, SB-206553. The selective 5-HT2C
antagonist SB-206553 also blocked LSD- but not
DOI-stimulated PI hydrolysis. Preincubation of the
frontocortical tissue with the PLC inhibitor U73122
significantly inhibited both DOI- and LSD-stimulated PI
signals. As in earlier studies from this laboratory, bi-
lateral infusion of either DOI or LSD into the mPFC dose-
dependently increased the number of head bobs. Bilateral
infusion of U73122 significantly reduced DOI-induced
head bobs, but it surprisingly had no effect on head bobs
in rabbits that had received an LSD infusion. These
findings indicate that DOI-signaled through 5-HT2A
receptors, whereas LSD only signaled through 5-HT2C
receptors. The results of these experiments demonstrate
that the two psychedelics can induce PI hydrolysis in the
rabbit frontal cortex through PLC activation, but only
DOI uses this signaling pathway to elicit head bobs.
D. Zebrafish Models
Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are emerging as a new non-
mammalian organism for behavioral neuroscience
research. They do have substantial physiologic and
morphologic homology to humans, and they exhibit
robust behavioral responses and are more economical
for use than rodent models. Two studies have now been
published describing the effects of psychedelics on
zebrafish. Grossman et al. (2010) characterized the
behavioral and endocrine effects of LSD on adult zebra-
fish. Behavioral paradigms used were novel tank,
observation cylinder, light/dark box, open field,
T-maze, social preference, and shoaling tests. The tests
are all described in detail in Grossman et al. (2010).
Video-tracking tools were used, and whole-body cortisol
was measured. Low doses of 5–75 mg/l LSD in the tank
water had no effect on zebrafish behavior, although
100 mg/l produced nonsignificant trends. The higher
250-mg/l concentration, however, had significant effects
on nearly all behaviors (e.g., increasing top dwelling and
reducing freezing in the novel tank and observation
cylinder tests). LSD also evoked mild thigmotaxis
(avoidance of the center of the tank) in the open field
test, increased light behavior in the light/dark test, and
reduced the number of arm entries and freezing in the
T-maze and social preference tests, without affecting
social preference. LSD increased interfish distance in
group shoaling and elevated whole-body cortisol levels.
LSD also significantly increased whole-body cortisol
levels in the novel tank, light/dark box, and open field
tests.
In a subsequent study, Kyzar et al. (2012) studied the
effect of mescaline (5–20 mg/l) on zebrafish behavior in
the novel tank test, open field, and shoaling tests.
Mescaline dose-dependently increased top activity in
the novel tank test, also reducing immobility and
disrupting the patterning of swimming. At the highest
dose tested (20 mg/l), mescaline markedly increased
shoaling behavior but had no effect on whole-body
cortisol levels, in contrast with the effects of LSD
reported by Grossman et al. (2010). The pharmacology
of LSD is more complex than mescaline, so it is not clear
that all of the effects reported by Grossman et al. were
due to 5-HT2A receptor–mediated effects.
E. Drosophila melanogaster
The fruit fly (D. melanogaster) is the simplest animal
model with a centralized brain that has been used to
study the effect of a psychedelic. The similarity between
mode of drug action, behavior, and gene response in
Drosophila and mammalian systems make the fly an
attractive system to study neuropharmacological
processes relevant to human disease (Nichols, 2006).
The fly has neurotransmitter receptors that drugs such
as LSD, and more receptor-selective hallucinogens like
DOI, directly target for their behavioral effects, in-
cluding 5-HT2, 5-HT1A–like, and dopamine D2–like
receptors. Furthermore, the fly has glutamate and
GABA systems that are known to be indirectly modu-
lated by psychedelics in mammals that are important
Psychedelics
321
 for the behavioral effects. In the initial study reporting
on the behavioral effects of LSD in the fly, Nichols et al.
(2002) examined the effect of acute LSD on general
activity, and the effects of LSD on the ability of the fly to
follow a moving object (optomotor response). In that
study, feeding was accomplished by starving the fly for
15–18 hours and then placing it on blotting paper
saturated with a solution of LSD spiked with [3H]
glucose so as to be able to measure the amount of drug
consumed after the experiments. With this method, a
single bolus dose ranging from 200 to 1200 ng/fly was
ingested within 1 to 2 minutes.
Flies carrying a mutation in the white gene (w1118)
demonstrated a progressive loss of activity and co-
ordination over about 15 minutes after LSD adminis-
tration, followed by a recovery beginning at about 60
minutes. The more severely affected flies became
completely paralyzed at about 15–20 minutes after
feeding. Ketanserin blocked the LSD-induced decrease
in locomotor activity observed in the mutant fly strain.
WT flies with red eyes, however, did not demonstrate
any overt impairment of coordination or activity even
after ingesting comparatively large amounts of LSD.
The white gene encodes the protein for the tryptophan
transporter (tryptophan is the biosynthetic precursor
for serotonin) and it was later demonstrated by another
group that white mutant flies have low levels of
serotonin (Borycz et al., 2008). Therefore, it seems likely
there is a compensatory upregulation of serotonin
receptors in these flies that results from abnormally
low levels of serotonin that confers the observed super-
sensitivity of w1118 flies to LSD.
Within the fly brain, there is a high density of
serotonergic processes as well as 5-HT1A–like receptors
in the visual centers of the fly brain that mediate visual
processing (Luo et al., 2012). One behavior mediated by
these areas is the optomotor response, or the ability of a fly
to track and follow a moving object. Feeding WT red-eyed
flies LSD produced a profound disruption of this behavior
without overtly affecting locomotor activity. Coadminis-
tration of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptor antagonists was able
to rescue this LSD-induced deficit in behavior. At the
molecular level, analysis of the brains of flies treated with
LSD indicated that it induces expression of the immediate
early gene homolog of cFos, dfos (kayak), similar to what
has been observed in the mammalian brain (Nichols and
Sanders-Bush, 2002; Nichols et al., 2002).
In subsequent studies, the Nichols group used a more
receptor-selective psychedelic, DOI, to probe the role of
the 5-HT2 receptor in fly behavior (Nichols, 2006;
Johnson et al., 2009, 2011). Rather than starving and
feeding as performed earlier, drug was mixed with the
food substrate and the flies were maintained on this for
up to several days before testing. This feeding strategy
was intended to allow the flies to achieve a steady-
state level of drug. Different concentrations of drug
were mixed into the food to perform dose-response
experiments. DOI was found to increase locomotor
activity slowly over several days, disrupt aspects of
circadian behavior, and decrease aggressive interac-
tions between two males when paired in an arena. In
conditioned-stimulus olfactory learning, the psyche-
delic DOI was found significantly to disrupt short-
term learning and memory (Johnson et al., 2011). LSD
has been tested in flies for its effect on learning and
memory, where it also was found to disrupt short-term
memory (C. D. Nichols, personal communication). In
experiments examining aspects of learning and long-
term memory, DOI had no significant effect on acquisi-
tion but significantly disrupted consolidation and recall
(Johnson et al., 2011).
F. Monkey Models
Although nonhuman primates might be the best
animals to model the actions of psychedelics in humans,
almost
nothing
has
been
published
in
the
past
decade using monkeys. Fantegrossi et al. (2004) report-
ed on transient reinforcing effects of phenylisopropyl-
amine
and
indoleamine
psychedelics
in
rhesus
monkeys. They investigated the capacity of several
psychedelics to maintain self-administration in four
rhesus monkeys with a history of MDMA self-
administration. No dose of either DMT or psilocybin
engendered significantly higher mean response rates
than did contingent saline, although one monkey did
exhibit transitory reinforcing effects after DMT and
psilocybin. Similar results were obtained with mesca-
line and DOI, in which no dose tested engendered
significantly higher mean rates than did contingent
saline. Mescaline transiently maintained significant
self-administration in three monkeys, but the appar-
ent reinforcing effects of mescaline did not persist in
any monkey. DOI was not self-administered by any
subject. These results are consistent with a number of
early experiments showing that classic psychedelics
lack reinforcing properties, supporting the conclu-
sion that these drugs do not lead to dependence or
addiction.
Li et al. (2009) examined the discriminative stimulus
effects of DOM, DPT, and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-n-propylth-
iophenethylamine (2C-T-7) in four adult rhesus mon-
keys. The nature of the cue was investigated using three
antagonists:
M100907,
ketanserin,
and
ritanserin.
Monkeys were trained to discriminate 0.32 mg/kg sub-
cutaneous. DOM from vehicle, responding on a FR5
schedule of stimulus shock termination. DOM, 2C-T-7,
and DPT all dose-dependently increased responding on
the DOM-appropriate lever. M100907, ketanserin, and
ritanserin each shifted the dose-response curves right-
ward in a parallel fashion. Potency of the antagonists was
correlated with their affinity at 5-HT2A receptors. Their
results provide evidence that the discriminative cue of
thethreepsychedelics inrhesus monkeysis predominantly,
if not exclusively, mediated by 5-HT2A receptors.

 IX. Potential Therapeutic Value for Psychedelics
Clinical research with psychedelics essentially ended
with the passage of the Controlled Substances Act of
1970. As pointed out in the Introduction, there were
more than a thousand clinical articles discussing 40,000
patients, several dozen books, and six international
conferences on psychedelic drug therapy (Grinspoon
and Bakalar, 1979). There were serious attempts to
employ LSD in various kinds of therapy, with major
emphasis on treatment of alcoholism and other addic-
tions (Bogenschutz, 2013), as well as issues related to
death and dying (e.g., see Grof et al., 1973; Kurland,
1985). Other studies examined the use of psychedelics to
treat anxiety and depression, schizophrenia, and even
autism (e.g., Bender, 1966). A review of psychedelic-
assisted therapy was recently published (Maji�
c et al.,
2015).
After a long hiatus in clinical research, one of the most
exciting and encouraging recent developments in this
field has been the reintroduction of human treatment
studies with psychedelics. Studies discussed in this
section will be seen by the reader to reinforce the early
belief that psychedelics might represent an important
new treatment modality for a variety of disorders. The
fact that these new and positive clinical findings had to
be postponed for several decades dramatically illus-
trates the destructive capacity of politics to hinder
potentially significant medical advances.
It should be pointed out that the efficacy of a
psychedelic in treating a particular condition could be
attributed either to a psychologic effect or to actual
physiologic adaptive changes in brain neurochemistry.
Therefore, in some cases, the discussion will focus on
possible receptor and neurochemical mechanisms that
could serve as the explanation for efficacy. In other
examples, there may be no evident explanation in
known physiology, and efficacy may involve novel acute
psychologic mechanisms, although ultimately one is
still talking about neurochemistry. In any event, after
this discussion of many new clinical findings, it is hoped
that the reader will be convinced that further clinical
research on psychedelics is clearly warranted.
A. Alleviation of Anxiety and Depression in
Life-Threatening Illness
One of the most well documented therapeutic effects
of LSD, first established in the 1960s, was alleviation of
anxiety and depression in acutely ill patients. This
research direction received its original impetus from
observations by Chicago internist Eric Kast. Kast and
Collins (1964) found that LSD had an analgesic effect at
least comparable to opiates, but that the LSD analgesia
outlasted its acute psychologic effects. Subsequent
study revealed that patients treated with LSD had
improved psychologic adjustment, were more respon-
sive to their families and environments, and had
enhanced ability to enjoy everyday life (Kast, 1966,
1970). Beginning in 1963, a group at the Spring Grove
State Hospital in Maryland developed an extensive
research program to study the value of psychedelic-
assisted psychotherapy of patients with alcoholism or
neuroses, patients who were addicted to narcotics, and
patients who were dying of cancer (Pahnke et al.,
1970a). With respect to treatment of dying cancer
patients, this group found that about two-thirds of
cancer patients who received LSD treatment had
improved mood and reduced anxiety and fear of death
(Pahnke et al., 1969, 1970b; Grof et al., 1973).
Building on the positive results from the Spring
Grove group, Grob et al. (2011) recently used a crossover
design and administered 0.2 mg/kg psilocybin versus
niacin placebo to 12 patients with advanced-stage
cancer with a diagnosis of anxiety related to their
cancer. Grob et al. (2011) reported nonsignificant trends
for benefits of psilocybin compared with placebo on
measures of depression and anxiety. Compared with
pretreatment baseline, however, the patients’ Spiel-
berger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) trait anx-
iety subscale scores revealed a significant reduction in
anxiety at 1 and 3 months after treatment. Similarly,
the patients’ Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores
showed an improvement of mood that reached signifi-
cance at 6 months compared with baseline. There was a
trend for mood improvement that approached but did
not reach significance.
These encouraging results in such a small study led to
extension of this approach by two groups, one at Johns
Hopkins University (JHU) and the other at New York
University (NYU), in studies that were recently com-
pleted. These are two reasonably large, well powered
phase 2 trials of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in
patients suffering from cancer-related psychosocial
distress (CRPD). These two studies represent the first
well powered, properly designed, formal double-blind,
placebo-controlled assessment of a psychedelic agent
used for a medical treatment, using modern clinical
approaches and assessment instruments. As such, they
represent a modern watershed moment in clinical
psychedelic research. Perhaps even more importantly,
these studies report remarkable results of efficacy that
are unprecedented for CRPD with any available con-
ventional therapies. Unfortunately, neither study has
yet been published, so complete details cannot be
reviewed here, although I have seen the results.
Nonetheless, a preliminary report of the JHU study
results was presented at the 2015 Annual Meeting of
the American Psychiatric Association; that presenta-
tion will serve as the basis for this summary (Griffiths,
2015).
The first of these trials of psilocybin-assisted psycho-
therapy for CRPD was completed by Roland Griffiths
and his colleagues at JHU (Griffiths, 2015). In that
study, 56 individuals were enrolled and randomized to
Psychedelics
323
 receive two treatments with psilocybin (high dose
versus low dose) in a randomized, crossover design,
and 51 participants completed at least one psilocybin
session. All 51 participants had a potentially life-
threatening cancer diagnosis, with 65% having recur-
rent or metastatic disease. All participants had a
DSM-IV diagnosis [including adjustment disorder with
anxiety; adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed
mood, chronic; dysthymic disorder; generalized anxiety
disorder; major depressive disorder (MDD); or a duel
diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder and MDD, or
generalized anxiety disorder and dysthymic disorder].
The study used a two-session, double-blind, crossover
design to investigate the effects of a high psilocybin dose
(22 mg/70 kg) with a low dose (1 mg/70 kg), both
ingested orally, on a variety of outcome measures
relevant to anxiety or depressive disorders likely caused
or exacerbated by the cancer diagnosis. Expectancy is
likely to be significantly operative in a standard drug
versus placebo design when the drug being evaluated
produces highly discriminable effects and participants
and staff know the specific drug conditions to be tested.
Therefore, a low dose of psilocybin was compared with a
high dose of psilocybin and participants and guides
were given instructions that obscured the range of
possible drug conditions to be tested.
After enrollment and assessment of baseline mea-
sures and before the first psilocybin session, each
participant met with study guides on two or more
occasions to establish rapport and prepare the partici-
pant for the psilocybin sessions. After each psilocybin
session, participants met with the study guides within a
day or two after the session to discuss their experiences.
The duration of each volunteer’s participation was
approximately 9 months.
Data assessments occurred as follows: immediately
after study enrollment (baseline assessment), on psilo-
cybin session day 1 (with multiple assessments across
the day), approximately 5 weeks after psilocybin session
one (postsession 1), on psilocybin session day 2 (multiple
assessments across the day), approximately 5 weeks
after psilocybin session 2 (postsession 2), and about 6
months after session 2 (6-month follow-up). Change in
depressive symptoms was evaluated by the clinician-
administered Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression
(HAM-D) and the self-report BDI. Anxiety symptoms
were assessed with the clinician-administered Hamil-
ton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) and the self-
report Spielberger STAI.
For measures that were assessed in the two dose-
sequence groups at baseline, postsession 1, postsession
2, and 6 months, the following planned comparisons
most relevant to examining the effects of psilocybin dose
were conducted: between-group comparisons at base-
line, postsession 1, and postsession 2; and within-
group comparisons of baseline versus postsession 1 in
both dose-sequence groups, and postsession 1 versus
postsession 2 in the low-dose first group. Therapeuti-
cally relevant outcome measures fulfilling the most
conservative criteria for psilocybin effects all showed
sustained effects at 6 months on the HAM-A, STAI,
HAM-D, BDI, and several other scales. Between-group
differences at 5 weeks after the first intervention
(i.e., postsession 1 assessment) showed Cohen’s d effect
sizes of 1.30 for HAM-D scores, 0.81 for BDI scores, 1.23
for HAM-A scores, and 0.60 for STAI trait anxiety scores
(Cohen’s d is the difference between the two group
means, divided by the pooled standard deviation; d = 0.8
is considered to be a large effect size). Effect sizes for
within-group change scores in the low-dose first group
(i.e., change between postsession 1 and postsession 2
assessments) were 1.33 for HAM-D, 0.69 for BDI, 1.10
for HAM-A, and 0.60 for STAI anxiety. These effects
persisted through the 6-month follow-up period. Other
outcome measures showing sustained effects at 6
months included Community Observer Ratings of Pos-
itive Changes in Attitudes and Behavior, Purpose in
Life, Life Attitude Profile Revised (LAP-R) Coherence,
and several measures of spirituality.
High-dose psilocybin showed a large effect size and a
statistically significant advantage over low-dose psilocy-
bin for reducing clinician-assessed and self-report mea-
sures of depression and anxiety. In addition to large effect
size reductions in depression and anxiety, high-dose
psilocybin produced significantly greater ratings of posi-
tive persisting effects on attitudes about life and self,
social effects, and spirituality. These effects were gener-
ally sustained at the 6-month follow-up. Consistent with
the positive changes, high-dose experiences were also
rated as producing significantly greater personal mean-
ing, spiritual significance, and increased well-being or life
satisfaction than the low-dose experiences, with these
differences sustained at 6 months. Furthermore, the
immediate postsession mystical experience score was
linearly correlated with therapeutic efficacy. Griffiths
(2015) concluded that a single moderate to high dose of
psilocybin, if given under supportive conditions to care-
fully screened and prepared participants, produced sub-
stantial and enduring decreases in anxiety and depression
in patients with a life-threatening cancer diagnosis.
A very similar study was also just completed at NYU
under the direction of Dr. Stephen Ross (S. Ross,
personal communication), in which 29 participants with
significant distress due to a cancer diagnosis were
enrolled and randomized. The therapeutic approach
and clinical setting were very similar to the one
employed in the JHU study, the chief difference being
the use of niacin as the placebo control in the NYU
study, contrasted with the use of low-dose psilocybin,
versus high-dose psilocybin in the JHU study. Eligible
participants had a primary DSM-IV diagnosis (adjust-
ment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood,
chronic; adjustment disorder with anxiety, chronic;
and generalized anxiety disorder), with more than
324
Nichols
 one-half of the participants in advanced stages of their
illness. Participants were assigned to receive psilocybin
(0.3 mg/kg) or niacin (250 mg) administered during two
8-hour treatment sessions.
Dramatic symptom reductions were observed, with
large effect sizes comparable to the JHU study, and
efficacy sustained at least out to 6 months after
treatment. As with the JHU study, it was concluded
that a single moderate dose (0.3 mg/kg) of psilocybin in
conjunction with psychotherapy was safely adminis-
tered to a cohort of patients with life-threatening
cancer, leading to acute and sustained anxiolytic and
antidepressant effects, with clinical benefit associated
with intensity of the subjective mystical experience,
improved attitudes toward disease progression and
death, improved quality of life, and increased spiritual
well-being.
Similarly, Gasser et al. (2014) employed LSD-assisted
therapy in 12 patients with anxiety related to a di-
agnosis of life-threatening diseases. Patients received
either 200 mg LSD (free base) or a 20 mg “active placebo”
dose of LSD with an open-label crossover to 200 mg LSD
after unblinding. There were no serious adverse effects
associated with the treatment. Positive trends found
using the STAI were sustained for 12 months after
treatment. In a subsequent study, Gasser et al. (2015)
followed up the same participants 12 months later to
examine long-term effects on anxiety and explore sub-
jective experiences and lasting psychologic effects. Nine
of the original subjects participated. Gasser et al. (2015)
found that the STAI state and trait scores did not
increase after the end of the study. In semistructured
interviews, seven of nine participants reported a sus-
tained reduction in anxiety. None of the participants
reported lasting negative effects. The authors concluded
that LSD-assisted psychotherapy in patients with life-
threatening illness demonstrated safety and positive
stable treatment outcomes at long-term follow-up.
These studies, taken together, demonstrate remark-
able efficacy in reducing the symptoms of CRPD. On the
basis of the effect sizes, there is no currently available
treatment that can produce such long-lasting and high
therapeutic efficacy. Large-scale, multisite trials now
need to be implemented to determine whether these
results can be repeated in a larger cohort of patients.
Although these studies examined psychedelic-
assisted therapy to treat depression and anxiety after
a life-threatening cancer diagnosis, the question must
be asked as to whether similar results could be obtained
in a patient population that suffers from depression
that does not result from a cancer diagnosis. In that
regard, Osorio et al. (2015) recently reported that a
single dose of ayahuasca had a significant antidepres-
sant effect in patients with recurrent MDD. Osorio et al.
conducted an open-label study of six volunteers with
different severities of depressive symptoms. The aver-
age baseline HAM-D score was 17.56. One day after
ayahuasca ingestion, there was a statistically signifi-
cant 62% decrease in the mean HAM-D score. By day 7,
there was a further drop in the score. Although the
mean score increased by day 14 to a nonsignificant
degree (due to one patient), it was again significantly
below the baseline score by day 21. Scores on the
Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale showed
similar effects, virtually paralleling the effects seen
with the HAM-D.
This study was open label with a very small sample
size, so it remains to be seen whether similar results
could be obtained in a larger, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial. It should be noted, however,
that at the present time, it seems unlikely that the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration would approve clinical
studies employing ayahuasca because of the lack of
control in its preparation and its variable alkaloid
content. Thus, studies of the potential antidepressant
effects of a psychedelic in endogenous depression likely
will have to focus on psilocybin or LSD, at least in the
United States.
Evidence from animal studies suggests that some
psychedelics may alleviate anxiety, in particular DOI, a
nonselective 5-HT2A/2C agonist, which has been perhaps
the most widely studied drug in this class. The four-
plates test–retest paradigm in mice is an animal model
of anxiety that is broadly sensitive not only to benzodi-
azepines but also to nonbenzodiazepine-type com-
pounds. DOI was first shown to possess an anxiolytic
effect in this model by Nic Dhonnchadha et al. (2003).
Subsequently, Ripoll et al. (2005) assessed the ability of
the four-plates to distinguish the anxiolytic effect of DOI
from diazepam, alprazolam, paroxetine, and venlafax-
ine. In contrast with the other drugs, DOI was the only
one able to restore the number of punished crossings to
the same value seen in naïve saline-treated mice. These
authors used the mouse hotplate test to insure that the
effect was not due simply to analgesia produced by DOI.
In a further study, Ripoll et al. (2006) used 5-HT2A–
selective and 5-HT2B/C–selective antagonists to exam-
ine the receptor type involved in the anxiolytic effect of
DOI. Only the 5-HT2A–selective antagonist blocked the
DOI-induced antipunishment effect, suggesting that
the anxiolytic effect of DOI was mediated through the
5-HT2A receptor. The authors discuss many possible
mechanisms whereby 5-HT2A receptor activation could
affect other neurotransmitter systems known to be
involved in anxiety, such as GABA or noradrenergic
pathways, but the mechanism through which DOI
exerts an anxiolytic effect remains to be elucidated.
Massé et al. (2007) investigated the role of the GABA
system in the anxiolytic activity of DOI. They coadmi-
nistered DOI along with GABAA and GABAB receptor
agonists and antagonists, and investigated effects on
the four-plates test of anxiety in mice. Low doses of DOI
that had no effect alone in the four-plates test were
significantly potentiated by alprazolam and diazepam,
Psychedelics
325
 but not by flumazenil. The GABAB agonist baclofen
significantly decreased the anxiolytic effect of DOI.
Their results, as well as a number of articles cited
showing the expression of 5-HT2A receptors on GABA
neurons, led these authors to hypothesize that 5-HT2A
receptor activation on GABA neurons increases GABA
release, which stimulates postsynaptic GABAA recep-
tors. In a separate study, Masse et al. (2008) micro-
injected DOI into the mouse hippocampus, amygdala, or
periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) and then immedi-
ately subjected the mice to the four-plates test to assess
anxiety. They demonstrated that DOI produced an
anxiolytic effect only when microinjected into the
hippocampus, but not into the amygdala or PAG.
Indeed, when injected into the amygdala or PAG, DOI
appeared to have an anxiogenic effect in the four-plates
test, decreasing the number of punished crossings.
B. Possible Use in Depression
The first report describing use of LSD in treating
depression was in 1952 (Savage, 1952). There were no
controls, and LSD was given in variable daily doses for 1
month. Savage concluded that improvement obtained
using LSD therapy was no better than therapy without
LSD but did state that therapeutically valuable insights
into unconscious processes were gained. Since then,
virtually nothing has been reported to suggest that
psychedelics might have specific efficacy against endog-
enous depression. Nonetheless, studies cited in the
previous section concerning treatment of anxiety and
depression secondary to a cancer diagnosis do indicate
that psychedelics may be effective in treating depres-
sion. A small, open-label study of ayahuasca in relieving
depression reported by Osorio et al. (2015) is also
suggestive. It remains to be proven whether psyche-
delics can be useful for treating MDD.
There is good reason to believe that psychedelics
might have efficacy in treating depression, however. For
example, it has been shown that cortical 5-HT2A re-
ceptor expression is increased in postmortem samples of
depressed and suicidal patients (Mendelson, 2000;
Pandey et al., 2002; Shelton et al., 2009), whereas 5-
HT2A binding was decreased in the hippocampus of
depressed patients (Sheline et al., 2004). Furthermore,
it has been shown that medication-free depressed
patients with high pessimistic attitudes have increased
5-HT2A receptor binding in the PFC compared with
healthy control subjects (Meyer et al., 2003; Bhagwagar
et al., 2006; Meyer, 2012).
Frokjaer et al. (2008) used [18F]altanserin PET to
image serotonin 5-HT2A receptor binding in the human
brain of 83 healthy Danish volunteers. They also were
administered a standardized personality questionnaire
to assess the trait of neuroticism. Neuroticism was
positively correlated with frontolimbic 5-HT2A receptor
binding, the correlation being primarily driven by two
constituent traits of neuroticism: vulnerability and
anxiety, with vulnerability displaying the strongest
positive correlation. Within the frontolimbic region,
the highest correlations were found in the entorhinal
cortex, superior frontal cortex, PCC, and inferior frontal
cortex. The authors hypothesize that because neuroti-
cism is associated with the risk of developing depres-
sion, and with the high correlation between neuroticism
and its constitutive trait of vulnerability, perhaps a
high vulnerability score is also associated with risk of
developing depression. Vulnerability was measured by
questions that explored the subject’s ability to cope with
stress and critical situations, among others. The au-
thors speculate that “high frontolimbic 5-HT2A binding
in healthy subjects with high neuroticism scores could
be a genetically determined trait that might lead to a
depressive state when a subject is exposed to stressful
stimuli” (Frokjaer et al., 2008).
Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a high-risk
model for studying suicidal behavior and is a contrib-
uting factor in more than one-third of completed
suicides (Soloff et al., 2007, and references therein);
indeed, BPD is one of the most lethal psychiatric
disorders. Soloff et al. (2007) used [18F]altanserin, a
high-affinity 5-HT2A antagonist, to conduct PET imag-
ing studies of 5-HT2A receptor binding in 14 female
impulsive BPD subjects with recurrent suicidal or self-
injurious behaviors who were considered at high risk for
future suicide. A control sample of 11 matched healthy
subjects was used for comparison. Significantly in-
creased 5-HT2A binding was found for BPD patients in
the hippocampus, medial temporal cortex, and occipital
cortex compared with healthy controls. The most robust
increase was seen in the hippocampus, especially
among nondepressed BPD subjects. Increased binding
is typically interpreted to mean that the 5-HT2A recep-
tors have been upregulated in response to decreased 5-
HT neurotransmission. Although the authors present
an extensive discussion of potential confounding factors
and limitations to their study, it is nevertheless in-
triguing to speculate as to whether a psychedelic might
prove useful in treating BPD.
The amygdala is a central brain structure involved in
the neurocircuitry of emotion processing. Serotonin neu-
rotransmission plays a key role in amygdala activity (see
earlier section III.G. in this review on 5-HT2A receptor
expression in the amygdala) and may be implicated in the
pathogenesis of depression. Kraehenmann et al. (2015)
used BOLD fMRI to evaluate the effects of psilocybin
(0.16 mg/kg, p.o.) on brain activity during emotion
processing in 25 healthy, right-handed subjects, focusing
on the amygdala as a region of interest (ROI). Subjects
first completed a slightly modified version of the amyg-
dala reactivity task, which comprised alternating blocks
of emotional picture discrimination tasks. Shape discrim-
ination tasks were interspersed within the picture dis-
crimination task to serve as baseline tasks and to allow
the amygdala responses to return to baseline.

 Psilocybin significantly increased positive affect, but
not negative affect or state anxiety. Psilocybin in-
creased subjective reports of positive mood but did not
increase anxiety. BOLD fMRI results revealed that
psilocybin significantly attenuated right amygdala
activation to both negative and neutral pictures;
amygdala reactivity to negative and neutral stimuli
was lower after psilocybin treatment than placebo.
Psilocybin-induced attenuation of amygdala reactivity
was significantly correlated with increase of positive
mood. Attenuation of right amygdala reactivity in
response to negative stimuli was associated with the
psilocybin-induced increase in positive mood state. The
authors conclude that their findings may be relevant to
the normalization of amygdala hyperactivity and neg-
ative mood states seen in patients with major depres-
sion, and they suggest that psilocybin has the potential
to normalize limbic hyperactivity in persons with de-
pressed mood.
It has been recognized for some time that psyche-
delics (i.e., 5-HT2A agonists) increase levels of cortical
glutamate (Aghajanian and Marek, 1997, 1999b; Béïque
et al., 2007; also see the earlier section on glutamate in
this review). Vollenweider and Kometer (2010) sug-
gested that indirect activation of glutamate networks
by classic psychedelics may enhance neuroplasticity
through stimulation of a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-
isoxazolepropionic acid–type glutamate receptors and
subsequent increase in the level of BDNF. Serum BDNF
levels are abnormally low in depressed individuals and
treatment with antidepressants is known to normalize
BDNF levels (Sen et al., 2008).
Using olfactory bulbectomy in rats as an animal
model of depression, Buchborn et al. (2014) demon-
strated that repeated LSD treatment reversed the
marked deficits in active avoidance learning in this
animal model. This finding was similar to an earlier
article in which Grecksch et al., (1997) found reversal of
these deficits by imipramine; Buchborn et al. (2014)
conclude that LSD has an antidepressant-like effect in
this model.
Trace fear conditioning in mice has previously been
shown to be a hippocampus-dependent learning para-
digm. Catlow et al. (2013) investigated the role of
psilocybin on hippocampal neurogenesis and trace fear
conditioning in rats. They found that a single low dose of
psilocybin (0.1 mg/kg, once per week for 1 month) led to
more rapid extinction of cued fear conditioning and
increased neurogenesis compared with saline control.
The low dose of psilocybin was also associated with a
slight but nonsignificant trend toward an increase in
hippocampal neurogenesis compared with vehicle con-
trol. Higher doses of psilocybin, or the 5-HT2A antago-
nist ketanserin, had no effect on extinction of the
conditioned fear response but significantly depressed
hippocampal neurogenesis. The authors speculate that
the 5-HT2A receptor might serve as a target for
conditions where a previously neutral set of stimuli is
associated with noxious or life-threatening events, such
as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Depressed subjects need more intensely happy facial
expressions to label happiness correctly and are slower
in responding to positive but not to negative words in
emotional go/no-go tasks. Taking into account an ex-
tensive literature indicating that serotonin 5-HT1A and
5-HT2A receptors are implicated in the pathophysiology
of dysfunctional emotional biases, Kometer et al. (2012)
examined for the first time the effects of psilocybin on
facial recognition, goal-directed behavior, and mood
state. Seventeen healthy human subjects on 4 separate
days received placebo, psilocybin (215 mg/kg), the
preferential 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin (50 mg), or
psilocybin plus ketanserin. Mood states were assessed
by self-report ratings, and behavioral and event-related
potential measurements were used to quantify facial
emotional recognition and goal-directed behavior to-
ward emotional cues. Here, Kometer et al. (2012)
assessed the ability to recognize the emotional state of
another person from facial cues. They also quantified
response selection and inhibition to emotional cues by
behavioral and event-related EEG measurements in an
emotional go/no-go task. In this test, 36 black-and-white
photographs of the eye region of persons expressing
different subtle emotional states were presented on a
computer screen along with four words describing the
states of the persons. Participants were instructed to
choose the word that most accurately described the
state of the person. The total number of correct recog-
nitions was calculated for different valence categories.
In the emotional go/no-go task, emotionally valenced
words were presented in the middle of the computer
screen. Participants were instructed by text appearing
at the beginning of each block to press as rapidly as
possible a response button when words of one valence
category were presented (go cues) and withhold re-
sponses to words of another valence category (no-go
cues). In the EEG analysis, event-related potentials
were referenced to the average reference before N2 and
P300 amplitudes were quantified against baseline
activity.
Kometer et al. (2012) reported that psilocybin en-
hanced positive mood and attenuated recognition of
negative facial expression. Psilocybin also increased
goal-directed behavior toward positive compared with
negative cues, facilitated positive but inhibited negative
sequential emotional effects, and valence-dependently
attenuated the P300 component. Ketanserin blocked
the psilocybin-induced mood enhancement and de-
creased recognition of negative facial expression. This
study demonstrated that psilocybin shifts the emotional
bias across various psychologic domains and that
activation of 5-HT2A receptors is central in mood regu-
lation
and
emotional
face
recognition
in
healthy
subjects.
Psychedelics
327
 The strong effects observed of psilocybin on mood
contrast with many otherdrugs thatmodulate serotonergic
tone, which usually lack acute effects on mood. The
serotonin 5-HT2A receptor also appears to be crucially
involved in the recognition of negative facial expressions,
becauseketanserinblocked psilocybin-induced attenuation
in recognizing negative emotional states from the eye
region of human faces. In the emotional go/no-go task,
psilocybin enhanced the response bias toward positive
relative to neutral and negative emotional stimuli, evi-
denced by the psilocybin-induced increase in reaction times
to negative and neutral compared with positive stimuli.
In a subsequent study, Bernasconi et al. (2014)
carried out electrical neuroimaging analyses on visual
evoked potentials in response to facial expressions
(fearful, happy, and neutral) under placebo and psilo-
cybin treatment. The aim of the study was to identify
neurophysiological modulation induced by psilocybin to
emotional face processing. The experiment consisted of
an EEG passive-viewing emotional face task, in which
participants were instructed to determine the emo-
tional valence of each face; no response was required.
Stimuli were black-and-white images that were neutral
with basic emotional expressions. They found a first
time period of strength (i.e., Global Field Power)
modulation of the 168- to 189-millisecond poststimulus
interval, induced by psilocybin. They also identified a
second time period of strength modulation of the 211- to
242-millisecond poststimulus interval. Source estima-
tions over these two time periods revealed decreased
activity in response to both neutral and fearful faces
within limbic areas that included the amygdala and
parahippocampal gyrus, the right temporal cortex
over the 168- to 189-millisecond interval, and reduced
activity in response to happy faces within limbic and
right temporo-occipital brain areas over the 211- to 242-
millisecond interval. Their results indicate a selective
and temporally dissociable effect of psilocybin on the
neuronal correlates of emotional face processing, con-
sistent with a modulation of top-down control.
C. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a debilitat-
ing medical condition that is very difficult to treat and
for which conventional therapies, such as selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are not highly
efficacious. It has long been believed that serotonin
systems are involved in OCD (Benkelfat et al., 1989),
and the apparent efficacy of serotonergic psychedelics
would point more specifically to involvement of the 5-
HT2A receptor. The earliest indication of efficacy for a
psychedelic in treatment of OCD was reported by
Jackson (1962), in which a patient suffering from
depression and violent obsessive sexual thoughts expe-
rienced dramatic and permanent improvement after
only two doses of LSD. Brandrup and Vanggaard (1977)
report on the outcome of LSD treatment of a 30-year-old
man suffering from a completely disabling OCD. The
treatment took place over 15 months, and surprisingly,
without any other therapy provided. While under the
influence of LSD, the patient was simply left alone
except for brief visits by the doctor or the nurse. At 3
years, the patient was completely symptom free and
remained so at 12-year follow-up, the point at which the
therapists published the case report.
In addition to these reports of LSD treatment,
anecdotal accounts of OCD symptom reduction by
consumption of Psilocybe mushrooms have also been
published (Leonard and Rapoport, 1987; Moreno and
Delgado, 1997). Hanes (1996) reported on a 27-year-old
male patient with body dysmorphic disorder who spent
up to 4 hours every day checking his appearance in the
mirror. The intensity of his somatic distress markedly
improved on occasions when he had ingested psilocybin
mushrooms, noting that at those times, when he looked
in the mirror, he no longer appeared deformed.
Following up on these reports, the effect of varying of
doses of oral psilocybin (100, 200, or 300 mg/kg) was
tested in a small proof-of-concept pilot study of nine
subjects who suffered from OCD (Moreno et al., 2006).
Subjects received up to four different doses, separated
by 1 week. Symptom assessment with the Yale-Brown
Obsessive Compulsive Scale was carried out at 4, 8, and
24 hours after treatment. Marked decreases in symp-
toms were seen in all subjects during one or more
sessions (23%–100% reduction in Yale-Brown Obses-
sive Compulsive Scale score), and most subjects with
symptom
reduction experienced
relief
beyond
the
expected pharmacological life of psilocybin, and beyond
the 24-hour assessment. Unfortunately, only one sub-
ject had achieved long-term remission at the 6-month
follow-up. The authors suggest that their results war-
rant future studies using a traditional blinded, ran-
domized, placebo-controlled trial to explore the efficacy
and duration of effect from a more prolonged exposure to
repeated doses of psilocybin in OCD patients.
Adams et al. (2005) compared cerebral 5-HT2A re-
ceptor binding in 15 untreated OCD patients and 15
matched healthy controls using [18F]altanserin PET
imaging. Increased 5-HT2A receptor binding was found
in the caudate nuclei of untreated OCD patients, but
there was no correlation between the severity of OCD
symptoms and 5-HT2A receptor binding. Compared with
the healthy group, untreated OCD patients had signif-
icantly higher 5-HT2A binding in both the left and right
caudate nuclei. Eleven OCD patients were rescanned
with PET after receiving a minimum of 12 weeks of
daily treatment with an SSRI, and there was no longer a
difference in receptor binding levels between the treat-
ed patients and the healthy controls. The investigators
suggested that the upregulation of 5-HT2A receptors in
OCD patients may be a compensatory mechanism for a
lack of serotonin in the feedback loop between the
thalamus and OFC, the caudate nuclei, and the globus
328
Nichols
 pallidus. It is known that serotonergic psychedelics
cause rapid downregulation of 5-HT2A receptors, which
might have an effect similar to SSRI treatment with
respect to 5-HT2A receptors.
Marble-burying behavior in mice is considered to be
an animal model of OCD. Matsushima et al. (2009)
studied the effect of psilocybin and the dried and
powdered mycelium of a psilocybin-containing mush-
room Psilocybe argentipes on marble-burying behavior
in male mice. P. argentipes at a dose of 0.1–1 g/kg
significantly reduced the number of buried marbles
without reducing locomotor behavior. Pure psilocybin at
a dose of 1.5 mg/kg also significantly reduced the
number of buried marbles. This dose of psilocybin was
higher than that calculated to be contained in the
effective dose of P. argentipes, and the authors speculate
that perhaps other tryptamine components of the
mushrooms may also be involved in the effect.
These promising results provide support for more
extensive controlled clinical trials of a psychedelic,
either LSD or psilocybin, in OCD. The relative lack of
efficacy for current therapies argues for more effort to be
put into studies of the efficacy of psychedelics for this
very-difficult- to-treat condition.
D. Treatment of Alcoholism or Nicotine Addiction
Canadian
psychiatrists
Humphrey
Osmond
and
Abram Hoffer considered LSD for the treatment of
alcoholism to be especially promising. Indeed, there
were a number of publications suggesting that psyche-
delics could be useful in treating substance abuse
(Chwelos et al., 1959; Smart et al., 1966; Hollister
et al., 1969; Savage and McCabe, 1973). Unfortunately,
early investigators did not employ rigorous clinical
methods such as randomized controlled trials, outcome
measures, and treatment settings, and thus those
studies did not provide definitive results. Abuzzahab
and Anderson (1971) reviewed studies of 1100 alcoholic
patients treated with LSD in the period from 1953 to
1969 and came to a similar conclusion; however, they
did find reports of improvement at 10 months for 75% of
patients who received a single dose of LSD compared
with only 44% of controls. For patients who received
multiple doses of LSD, 58% were “improved” compared
with 54% of the controls. Unfortunately, the social
concerns engendered by widespread recreational use
of LSD led to government restrictions that effectively
ended legitimate medical research (Dyck, 2005).
Whether LSD was actually effective in treating alcohol-
ism remained an open question fordecades (Mangini, 1998),
until the recent meta-analysis by Krebs and Johansen
(2012), which concluded that a single dose of LSD, used
in various treatment programs, was associated with a
decrease in alcohol misuse. Their analysis was based on six
eligible clinical trials from the period from 1943 to 2010,
which included 325 adults that received a single (210–800
mg) dose of LSD and 211 adults that were used as controls.
Bogenschutz and colleagues at the University of New
Mexico recently revisited this issue. These investigators
carried out an open-label proof-of-concept trial of psilo-
cybin treatment in a sample of 10 volunteers with a
DSM-IV diagnosis of alcohol dependence (Bogenschutz
et al., 2014). Treatment consisted of psychosocial treat-
ment only, psychosocial treatment coupled with psilo-
cybin, and post-treatment follow-up. There was no
increase in abstinence during the first month of psy-
chosocial treatment only, but there was a significant
increase in abstinence after subjects had received
psilocybin. The strength of the psilocybin experience
was a predictor of drinking behavior improvement,
craving, and self-efficacy. No significant treatment-
related adverse events were reported.
Remarkably, a recent study has shown that thera-
peutic approaches using psilocybin can also be highly
effective in helping long-time cigarette users quit
smoking. Johnson et al. (2014) carried out an open-
label pilot study using psilocybin as an adjunct to
psychotherapy in a structured 15-week smoking cessa-
tion
program.
Subjects
were
15
healthy
nicotine-
dependent smokers who had made multiple unsuccessful
attempts to quit smoking. Subjects received weekly
cognitive-behavioral therapy, with a psilocybin treatment
session at week 5. Weekly therapy sessions continued,
with a second dose of psilocybin at week 7 and a third
optional dose at week 13. At the 6-month follow-up, 12 of
15 subjects (80%) showed abstinence. This smoking
cessation rate exceeds the typical (,35%) rates observed
in other behavioral or pharmacological therapies. These
very promising results certainly argue for further in-
vestigation of this approach.
In a follow-up to the report by Johnson et al. (2014),
Garcia-Romeu et al. (2014) reported that abstainers
scored significantly higher on a measure of psilocybin-
occasioned mystical experience. There were no signifi-
cant differences found between groups in general
intensity of drug effect, suggesting that mystical-type
subjective effects, rather than overall intensity of drug
effect, were responsible for smoking cessation. Smoking
cessation outcomes were significantly correlated with
measures of mystical experience on drug session days.
The authors propose a mediating role for mystical
experience in psychedelic-facilitated addiction treatment.
In a longitudinal study of 25,622 individuals with a
history of substance involvement, Hendricks et al.
(2014) found that use of psychedelics predicted a re-
duced likelihood of noncompliance with legal require-
ments that included alcohol and other drug use. The
authors concluded that psychedelic use may promote
alcohol and other drug abstinence as well as prosocial
behavior in a population with high rates of recidivism.
E. Cluster Headaches
Cluster headache is a devastating idiopathic pain
syndrome. It is the most severe type of headache,
Psychedelics
329
 characterized by unilateral orbital or periorbital pain,
accompanied by ipsilateral autonomic features in the
nose, eyes, and face, with attacks lasting on average
about 90 minutes. Cluster attacks can be acute or
episodic, although the episodic form is most common
(May, 2005). The most effective treatments have been
100% oxygen or subcutaneous sumatriptan (Becker,
2013). Recent evidence, however, has indicated that
psychedelics may be more effective therapies for abort-
ing acute attacks than conventional treatments. Online
interviews of 53 cluster headache patients who had used
either psilocybin or LSD to treat their condition found
that 22 of 26 psilocybin users reported that psilocybin
aborted attacks, and 25 of 48 psilocybin users and 7 of 8
LSD users reported cluster period termination. Exten-
sion of the remission period for attacks was reported by
18 of 19 psilocybin users and 4 of 5 LSD users (Sewell
et al., 2006).
Surprisingly, a nonhallucinogenic LSD derivative,
BOL-148 (2-bromo-LSD), was also found to be an
effective treatment of cluster headaches (Karst et al.,
2010). Three single oral doses of 30 mg/kg BOL-148 in
five sufferers could either break a cluster headache
cycle or considerably improve the frequency and in-
tensity of attacks. The lack of psychedelic activity for
BOL-148 clearly indicates that therapeutic efficacy in
cluster headaches cannot be related to psychoactive
effects, which presumably are manifested through the
5-HT2A receptor, but the mechanism of action remains
unknown. Early reports examined the pharmacology of
BOL compared with LSD, although not much conclusive
was found; however, it does appear that there must be
some overlap between the pharmacology of BOL and
LSD. For example, when 1 mg BOL was given three
times a day for 5 days to 10 human volunteers, the effect
of 1 mg/kg LSD was significantly attenuated (Isbell
et al., 1959). If a single dose of 2–4 mg BOL was given
along with LSD, there was no effect on the LSD
response. When 3 mg/d BOL was given for 2 days prior
to LSD, a trend was observed but not a significant block
of the LSD effect. Early in vitro studies showed that the
“antiserotonin” effect of BOL was at least comparable to
that of LSD (Cerletti and Doepfner, 1958), so down-
regulation of the 5-HT2A receptor by BOL might be
expected to block the effects of LSD. At the 5-HT2C
receptor, however, BOL is a silent antagonist and did
not cause receptor downregulation at the choroid plexus
5-HT2C receptor, whereas the inverse agonist minan-
serin led to reduced 5-HT2C receptor density. A detailed
analysis of the receptor binding profile for BOL, along
with its functional effects, might shed light on the basis
for the therapeutic effects of BOL against cluster
headaches.
F. Autism
During the very early years, when LSD was consid-
ered to be somewhat of a miracle drug, the possibility
was investigated that psychedelics might be useful in
ameliorating the symptoms of autistic spectrum disor-
ders. Between 1959 and 1974, a number of studies were
reported on the use of LSD to treat children with
autism. Sigafoos et al. (2007) reviewed these reports.
Unfortunately, the vast majority of those studies had
serious methodological flaws. Typically, after the drug
was administered, the children were simply observed
and their reactions were recorded in a narrative format.
Thus, the resulting data were for the most part
qualitative and were presented in a form that was
highly subjective, potentially biased by observer expec-
tations, and of unknown reliability and validity. Fur-
thermore, when enthusiastic investigators obtained
neutral or negative findings, they often were cast in a
more positive light than was warranted. Despite a good
number of independent studies, it remains impossible
to determine whether LSD had any therapeutic value
for children with autism. When judged by today’s
standards of randomized controlled trials, or a properly
controlled and systematically replicated single-case
study, most of the early autism/LSD studies were so
flawed as to be little better than anecdotal.
Although a rationale for treating autism with LSD
might seem obscure on the surface, there is a potential
scientific basis for such treatment. Murphy et al. (2006)
used single-photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT) imaging with a 5-HT2A–selective antagonist
[123I]-radioligand (123I-5-I-R91150) to compare cortical
density of 5-HT2A receptors in 10 healthy adult subjects
and 8 adults with Asperger’s syndrome. They found that
the Asperger’s patients had a significant reduction in
cortical 5-HT2A binding in the total, anterior, and
posterior cingulate; bilaterally in the frontal and supe-
rior temporal lobes; and in the left parietal lobe. They
reported that reduced receptor binding was signifi-
cantly related to abnormal social communication. It
therefore seems possible that the use of a 5-HT2A
agonist might improve functioning, at least acutely.
G. Cognitive Function
There are no clinical studies of the effect of psyche-
delics on memory or cognitive function, but there is a
reasonable basis to believe they might have a beneficial
effect on memory or cognitive deficits, at least acutely. It
is known that 5-HT2A receptors have a role in cognitive
function of working memory that involves actions at
both excitatory and inhibitory elements within local
circuitry (Williams et al., 2002). A frequent polymor-
phism of the gene that encodes for the 5-HT2A receptor
is known that attenuates its function and this poly-
morphism has been shown to have an effect on memory.
More specifically, de Quervain et al. (2003) examined a
polymorphism that predicts an amino acid substitution of
His to Tyr at residue 452 (H452Y) of the 5-HT2A receptor.
Heterozygous (His/Tyr) carriers show a blunted response
when the receptor is pharmacologically stimulated.
330
Nichols
 de Quervain et al. investigated the effects of the H452Y
polymorphism on human memory. Memory testing and
genotyping was done in a total of 349 subjects composed
of two independent populations of either university
students or age-matched employees/trainees who were
not studying at the university and did not have a
university degree. After genotyping, 279 participants
were found to be His/His and 70 were His/Tyr. All
subjects underwent cognitive assessment over 2 days.
The His/Tyr subjects showed a 21% poorer memory
performance compared with His/His subjects.
Wagner et al. (2008) followed up on the finding by de
Quervain et al. and reported that the H452Y variant of
the gene encoding the 5-HT2A receptor is associated
with the consolidation of episodic memory in humans.
Carriers of the H452Y allele showed poorer verbal
delayed recall and recognition, whereas immediate
recall and other measure of attentional and executive
function were not affected by the H452Y genotype. They
essentially replicated the findings of de Quervain et al.
(2003), noting that their effect size for recall after 30
minutes was similar to the effect size observed by de
Quervain et al. for 5-minute recall and for recall
24 hours later. Wagner et al. (2008) suggest that
these results may foster further search for memory-
enhancing agents to treat mild cognitive impairment,
and one can infer that this recommendation might well
apply to psychedelic agents, but perhaps at subintox-
icating doses.
Substantial evidence has also accumulated from
postmortem human brain studies, clinical pharmacol-
ogy, animal studies, and PET brain imaging in humans
to point to dysfunction of the serotonergic system in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (see review by Meltzer et al.,
1998). In particular, a consistent postmortem finding in
AD is a marked reduction in the density of 5-HT2A
receptors (Reynolds et al., 1984; Bowen et al., 1989;
Cheng et al., 1991; Lai et al., 2005).
Using PET with the 5-HT2A–selective antagonist
[18F]altanserin, Meltzer et al. (1999) measured 5-HT2A
receptor density in 11 elderly AD patients compared
with 10 age-matched healthy controls. The patients
suffered from depression or AD, with three of the AD
patients also having concurrent depression. Meltzer
et al. (1999) reported finding no reduction in [18F]
altanserin binding in depressed patients, and no effect
of depression on binding in the AD group. By contrast,
the AD patients had significantly lower 5-HT2A binding
potential in several brain regions, compared with
controls. These regions included the ACC, PFC, lateral
temporal cortex, amygdala-hippocampal complex, and
sensorimotor cortex.
Nair and Gudelsky (2004), using in vivo microdialysis
experiments in rats, reported that DOI (given intraper-
itoneally) significantly increased extracellular ACh in
both the PFC and dorsal hippocampus. This increase
was attenuated if rats were pretreated with a 5-HT2–
nonselective antagonist. Although the 5-HT2C–selective
agonist
MK-212
[6-chloro-2-(1-piperazinyl)pyrazine]
significantly enhanced release of ACh in both brain
areas, the 5-HT2A/2C agonist mescaline produced a
2-fold ACh increase only in the PFC. Intracortical, but
not intrahippocampal, infusion of DOI significantly
enhanced the release of ACh in the cortex.
More recently, Hasselbalch et al. (2008) used [18F]
altanserin PET to assess cerebral 5-HT2A receptor
density in 16 patients with mild cognitive impairment
of the amnestic type, compared with 17 age and sex-
matched controls. Patients with mild cognitive impair-
ment are considered at increased risk of developing AD,
and their inclusion criteria were deliberately aimed at
including patients with symptoms of very early AD.
Indeed, at 1-year follow-up, six of their patients had
progressed clinically and fulfilled AD criteria. This
study revealed a significant 20%–30% global reduction
of 5-HT2A binding in most neocortical areas. These
widespread reductions in 5-HT2A density may point to
serotonergic dysfunction in prodromal AD.
H. Creativity
Since the introduction of LSD into popular culture,
there has been a great deal of speculation as to whether
psychedelics might acutely improve creativity. Cer-
tainly, there was a veritable explosion of new music,
art, and fashion during the 1960s, which were charac-
terized as “psychedelic.” Probably few would argue that
the use of psychedelics was not a major factor driving
that revolution; even today, if the adjective “psyche-
delic” is applied to something, for most people it
immediately brings to mind ideas of bright and colorful
objects, swirling patterns, and so forth. Sessa (2008)
wrote an essay about much of the thinking and reported
on creativity from that early period of time.
Unfortunately, from a science perspective, there has
been no well done, controlled study to determine
whether psychedelics actually do improve creativity.
The closest the published literature comes is an early
study by Harman et al. (1966). Harman et al. recruited
27 male participants who were in various professional
occupations, including engineers, physicists, mathema-
ticians, architects, a furniture designer, and a commer-
cial artist. Subjects were instructed to select one or more
problems that required a creative solution. A number of
subjects had worked for weeks or months on their
chosen projects without being able to find a satisfactory
solution. Various psychologic tests and tests of creativ-
ity were administered before and after the drug
sessions, which involved administration of 200 mg
mescaline. Participants were prepared by presession
interviews and instructions regarding how to approach
the drug sessions. The results reported are rather
remarkable. Of the 44 problems brought by the subjects,
20 had new avenues opened for further investigation, 1
was a developmental model that received authorization
Psychedelics
331
 to test the solution, a working model had been com-
pleted for 2, 6 had a solution that had been accepted for
construction or production, and 10 had partial solutions
that were being developed further or being applied in
practice. No solution was obtained only for four of the
problems. Although lacking detailed specifics as well as
a follow-up, this early report does suggest that psyche-
delics might acutely improve creativity.
In 1991, tech journalist Denise Caruso attended
SIGGRAPH, the largest gathering of computer graphics
professionals in the world. Apparently hearing that
the use of psychedelics had played a foundational role in
the development of computer graphics and software,
she took a survey of 180 professionals in the field who
admitted they had taken psychedelics and that they
were important to their work. She published her story in
the August 4, 1991 edition of the San Francisco
Examiner. The late Apple cofounder Steve Jobs was
open about the fact he had experimented with LSD
while in college and said that taking LSD was a
profound experience, and “one of the two or three most
important things I have done in my life.”
Another incidence of psychedelic drug–induced crea-
tivity from the scientific community comes from Nobel
Prize–winning chemist Dr. Kary Mullis, the inventor of
PCR, who is quoted as saying “Would I have invented
PCR if I hadn’t taken LSD? I seriously doubt it… I could
sit on a DNA molecule and watch the polymers go by. I
learnt that partly on psychedelic drugs.”
Nobel Prize winner Francis Crick, who discovered the
double-helix structure of the DNA molecule, is known to
have used LSD on occasion. Although there have been
allegations that he conceived the idea of the double-
helix while on LSD, the story is false. His biographer
has pointed out that although Crick was given LSD on
several occasions from 1967 onward, his major break-
through discoveries occurred prior to that date.
I. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine in
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
Although MDMA is not, strictly speaking, a classic
psychedelic, it is a unique psychoactive agent that, like
the psychedelics, was placed into Schedule 1 of the
Controlled Substances Act. Thus, although numerous
investigators have reported on its effects in animals, no
well designed clinical studies of its medical potential had
been carried out for many years. However, Mithoefer
et al. (2011) recently studied the potential of MDMA,
coupled with psychotherapy, to have therapeutic benefit
in patients with PTSD. Twenty subjects with chronic
PTSD refractory to both psychotherapy and psycho-
pharmacology were enrolled in a randomized placebo-
controlled pilot study. Clinical response was defined as
a .30% reduction from baseline in total severity score
on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale.
In stage 1 (the initial double-blind group), the clinical
response was 83.3% (10 of 12) in the MDMA group
versus 25% (2 of 8) in the placebo group. Likewise, 10
participants in the MDMA group no longer met DSM-IV
criteria for PTSD compared with only 2 in the placebo
group. In stage 2 (a second open-label administration
that was offered to the initial placebo group), the clinical
response rate was 100% in the seven subjects, six of
whom had failed to respond to placebo and one of whom
had relapsed after an initial placebo response. A de-
crease in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale scores
from baseline was significantly greater for the MDMA
group than for the placebo group. The rate of clinical
response in the active treatment groups was 85%
compared with 25% in the placebo group.
J. Use as Ocular Hypotensives for Glaucoma
It has been known for some time that several
serotonin receptor types are expressed in ocular tissues
of the human eye (Martin et al., 1992), and May et al.
(2003) demonstrated that 5-HT2 receptors were in-
volved in local control of intraocular pressure (IOP) in
cynomolgus monkeys. The nonselective 5-HT2A/2C ago-
nist R-DOI also was shown to have a dose-dependent
reducing effect on IOP in the cynomolgus monkey (May
et al., 2003). Sharif and Senchyna (2006) used RT-PCR
to demonstrate that human ocular tissues expressed
mRNA for the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors, with
greatest abundance in the retina, ciliary body, ciliary
epithelium, choroid, conjunctiva, and iris. Sharif et al.
(2006) also reported that human trabecular meshwork
cells expressed robust mRNA signals for 5-HT2A and 5-
HT2B receptors. A number of 5-HT2 agonists were
demonstrated to stimulate PI turnover and Ca2+ mobi-
lization in human trabecular meshwork cells. These
effects were blocked completely by the 5-HT2A–selective
antagonist M100907 but were only weakly antagonized
by selective 5-HT2B or 5-HT2C antagonists. Both R-DOI
and a-methylserotonin were shown to lower IOP in
ocular hypertensive cynomolgus monkeys by 34% and
31%, respectively.
Gabelt et al. (2005) also examined the effects of R-DOI
on IOP and aqueous humor dynamics in normotensive
cynomolgus monkeys. Monkeys were treated topically
once daily with four 5-ml drops of 0.5% R-DOI in one eye
and vehicle in the other eye. The 6-hour IOP was
determined before drug treatment and on the third
day of treatment. Aqueous humor formation was mea-
sured between 3 and 8 hours after the third dose, and
aqueous humor flow was measured 3.5 hours after the
fourth or fifth dose. After the third dose of R-DOI, IOP
was significantly decreased by 1.4 to 4.7 mm Hg over 6
hours. Aqueous humor flow was increased by 13% in
treated compared with control eyes. These effects were
attributed to an increase in uveoscleral outflow, an
important component of aqueous humor dynamics that
contributes to the maintenance of IOP.
May et al. (2006) discovered indazole-based 5-HT2A
agonists with poor CNS activity and solution stability
332
Nichols
 superior to conventional tryptamine-based 5-HT2 ago-
nists such as serotonin and AMS. They identified one
compound, 1-((S)-2-aminopropyl)-1H-indazol-6-ol), with
an EC50 of 43 nM and Emax of 89% that lowered
intraocular pressure by 33% in conscious ocular hyper-
tensive monkeys.
Feng et al. (2007) also identified novel 5-HT2A
agonists with ocular hypotensive activity. They
replaced the 4-bromine atom of DOB analogs with polar
groups to lower their lipophilicity and thus to reduce
potential CNS effects. Three compounds were selected
for further testing based on IC50 values of 0.28, 0.38, and
0.7 nM for [125I]DOI displacement from the rat cerebral
cortex homogenate. All three compounds were potent
partial agonists in an intracellular calcium mobilization
assay in rat vascular smooth muscle cells. After topical
administration of 300-mg doses in cynomolgus monkeys,
they observed maximum IOP reductions of 36.8%, 27%,
and 24%, respectively.
These studies demonstrate that selective 5-HT2A
agonists may have application when topically applied
to reduce IOP in glaucoma. The caveat here, which
drove much of the more recent drug development
efforts, was to identify potent agonists that would not
penetrate the CNS and thus would lack psychedelic
activity. Clearly, highly 5-HT2A receptor–specific ago-
nists would be most desirable, but thus far no such
ligand has been identified.
K. Tissue Regeneration
Psychedelics may also have potential to stimulate
tissue regeneration. Arvanian et al. (2006) carried out a
study in which rats received a staggered double hemi-
section (DH) at postnatal day two (P2) of the left
hemicord at T11 and the right hemicord at T12. A
second group had a complete transection at T11 (CT),
with a third group serving as a sham-operated control.
Drug treatments consisted of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3)
and LSD given either alone or in combination. Drugs
were administered intrathecally above the lesion dur-
ing surgery and again subcutaneously at P4, P6, P8, and
P10. The frequency of rearing in an open field test and
hindlimb kicks during swimming were then used to
assess motor function, and both DH and CT rats showed
severe impairment. DH rats treated with the combina-
tion of NT-3 and LSD showed significantly more kicks
during swimming than untreated DH or CT rats or
treated CT rats. Improvement began as early as P9 and
lasted for the duration of the testing. Rearing frequency
also improved with treatment, beginning only in the
third postnatal week, when it normally develops, and
reached sham values by P40. The authors suggest that
the combination treatment of NT-3 with LSD may be a
promising strategy for facilitating recovery from mod-
erate spinal cord injury (SCI). The possibility that LSD
might promote neuronal regrowth in SCIs is very
exciting.
Lee et al. (2007) presented evidence that 5-HT2A
receptors are upregulated after contusional SCI in rats.
They studied the monosynaptic connection between
primary muscle afferents and a motoneurons using
the Hoffman reflex (H-reflex). The H-reflex is elicited
by electrical stimulation of a peripheral nerve that
innervates the muscle from which the reflex is recorded.
The stimulus generates a short-latency M-wave by
direct stimulation of the motor axons innervating the
muscle, as well as a long latency H-wave (a measure of
the a motoneurons activated by Ia afferents). The
authors had previously observed (Lee et al., 2005)
increased H-reflex amplitude 4 weeks after contusional
SCIs of different severity. In addition, they also noted
that the increased H-reflex amplitude was positively
correlated with serotonin immunoreactivity around the
motoneurons involved in the reflex. DOI had previously
been shown by Miller et al. (1996) to restore excitability
of extensor motoneurons that is abolished after acute
spinalization in the cat. In addition, no serotonergic
innervation of the lumbar-sacral spinal cord remains
after a CT (Lee et al., 2005), because completely trans-
ected animals showed no 5-HT immunoreactivity at the
level of the rostral dorsolateral nucleus.
Thus, Lee et al. (2007) measured H-reflex amplitude
after a standardized incomplete contusive SCI in rats
and measured the H-wave/M-wave ratio. To study the
role of 5-HT2 receptors in the response, they carried out
experiments in which they administered either intra-
thecal DOI or a 5-HT2A antagonist. A mild contusive
SCI was created at T8, and slides containing the rostral
dorsolateral nucleus were used for 5-HT immunohisto-
chemistry. 5-HT2A receptor immunohistochemistry was
performed on spinal cord sections adjacent to those used
for the 5-HT immunohistochemistry. Four weeks after a
mild SCI, the H-wave/M-wave ratio was significantly
increased by 93 nM, but not 31 nM of DOI. Mild SCI
animals had significantly more 5-HT2A receptor immu-
noreactivity 4 weeks after SCI than did uninjured
controls. Lee et al. (2007) concluded that upregulation
of the 5-HT2A receptor “is likely to be involved in the
enhanced H-reflex that develops after clinically rele-
vant incomplete conclusive SCI.” They note that their
results are consistent with other studies providing
evidence for increased expression of 5-HT2 receptors
and increased sensitivity to serotonergic drugs by spinal
motoneurons distal to an SCI. They further speculate
that 5-HT2 receptor modulation of enhanced recruit-
ment of motoneurons in response to afferent input may
contribute to locomotor recovery after an incomplete
SCI. If these results can be translated to humans, it
suggests that administration of a 5-HT2A agonist at
the site of a contusional SCI, possibly by intrathe-
cal administration, might promote recovery from the
injury.
The most significant limiting factor for survival after
liver surgery and transplantation of a partial graft is the
Psychedelics
333
 ability of the remnant liver to regenerate (Furrer et al.,
2011, and references therein). Serotonin, derived from
platelets, is thought to be involved in liver regeneration
after major tissue loss. Platelets are major carriers of
serotonin in the blood, and 5-HT2A/2C serotonin agonist
DOI completely restored liver proliferation in thrombo-
cytopenic mice (Lesurtel et al., 2006). Partial (70%)
hepatectomy was performed in mice, in which platelet
function was inhibited pharmacologically or platelets
were depleted. When mice were treated with a 5-HT2A
antagonist, hepatocyte proliferation was reduced com-
pared with vehicle-treated controls. A 5-HT2B receptor
antagonist also reduced hepatocytes. The authors sug-
gest that 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptor subtypes mediate
serotonin-dependent liver regeneration.
Furrer et al. (2011) identified markers of hepatocyte
proliferation 48 hours after mouse hepatectomy, as well
as the mitotic index at 4 days. Both markers were
dramatically decreased in cell proliferation in 2-year-
old mice, and the mitotic index also was significantly
decreased in old compared with young (7- to 8-week-old)
mice. Upregulation of the 5-HT2A receptor was seen
after hepatectomy in young mice, whereas this upregu-
lation was absent in old mice, possibly reflecting re-
generative impairment. Pretreating old mice with DOI
prior to hepatectomy increased the weight of the liver
remnant compared with untreated animals, signifi-
cantly improved hepatocyte proliferation, and con-
verted animal survival from 48% to 86%. Treating
control animals with DOI alone did not affect 5-HT2A
receptor expression. Their results demonstrate that 5-
HT2A receptor activation by DOI restores deficient
regeneration of old livers. Furrer et al. (2011) also
reported that old animals had characteristic changes
of pseudocapillarization, with loss of fenestration, but
that young animals had a thin sinusoidal lining con-
taining many fenestrae. DOI had no significant effect in
young animals but led to increased numbers of fenes-
trae in old animals.
Furrer et al. (2011) also observed significantly lower
portal blood flow at baseline in old compared with young
mice, and DOI improved portal flow and increased
microperfusion in old livers. Electron microscopy stud-
ies demonstrated deficient platelet adhesion in old
livers after hepatectomy, which was improved by DOI
administration. Mechanistic studies revealed that DOI
increased interleukin (IL)-6 at 48 hours after hepatec-
tomy, but the strongest effect of DOI was to increase
serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF). Thus, application of anti-VEGF antibodies
blunted the proliferative effect of DOI, and administer-
ing exogenous VEGF enhanced liver regeneration to
levels seen in DOI-treated mice. Furrer et al. (2011)
conclude that liver regeneration is impaired in old mice
due to a deficiency in the fenestration of hepatic
sinusoids. Administering DOI ameliorates this de-
fect through a pathway that involves VEGF, which
regulates opening of endothelial fenestrae, improving
microcirculation and enabling normal regenerative re-
sponse after liver injury. In essence, 5-HT2A agonists
can restore the capacity of old livers to regenerate.
L. Effects on Immune Response
Although serotonin itself has long been established to
be involved in inflammation and inflammatory process-
es, the role of psychedelics and their primary target,
the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, in these processes was
unknown until recently. In 2008, Charles Nichols
discovered that psychedelics produced powerful anti-
inflammatory effects against tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-a–mediated inflammatory processes in several
cell types, including primary aortic smooth muscle cells,
through activation of 5-HT2A receptors (Yu et al., 2008).
Whereas several psychedelic drugs, including LSD,
demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory effects, the
drug R-DOI was extraordinarily potent at blocking
inflammation. TNF-a–induced proinflammatory markers
that were inhibited by R-DOI included the expression of
genes encoding for cell adhesion molecules (intracellu-
lar adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion
molecule-1), the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, activity of
the enzyme nitric oxide synthase, and activation and
nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kB. IC50 concen-
trations for R-DOI inhibition were very low (in the
range of only 10–20 pM), and significant inhibition
could be observed even if R-DOI was added several
hours after TNF-a treatment.
Following up on these promising results, the same
group tested the ability of R-DOI to block the inflam-
matory effects of TNF-a in the whole animal (Nau et al.,
2013). Saline, R-DOI (0.01, 0.1, or 0.3 mg/kg), and TNF-a
(10 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally to
C57BL/6J mice, with R-DOI given 30 minutes prior to
TNF-a. The highest dose of R-DOI administered in that
study (0.3 mg/kg) is the lowest dose that can be
behaviorally detected by mice (Smith et al., 2003). Five
hours after TNF-a injection, animals were euthanized
and various tissues were removed for analysis of the
expression of genes for cell adhesion markers (intracel-
lular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion
molecule-1), cytokines (IL-6 and IL-1b), and chemokines
(monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and chemokine (C-X3-
C motif) ligand 1 Cx3cl1). R-DOI was found to block
TNF-a–induced
increases
of
these
inflammatory
markers in the vasculature (aortic arch). In the in-
testine, the lowest amount of drug (0.01 mg/kg) pro-
duced a maximal anti-inflammatory effect and nearly
completely blocked the expression of all proinflamma-
tory markers examined. R-DOI was also able to block
dose-dependently and completely TNF-a–induced lev-
els of circulating IL-6 in the blood. Importantly, antag-
onist studies using the highly selective 5-HT2A receptor
antagonist
M100907
demonstrated
that
the
anti-
inflammatory effects of R-DOI in the whole animal
334
Nichols
 were mediated by activation of the 5-HT2A receptor, as
they were in the earlier cell culture studies.
To test the potential efficacy of R-DOI to treat a
human inflammatory disease, the Nichols group (Nau
et al., 2015) assessed the effects of R-DOI in a mouse
model of allergic asthma. In this model, BALB/c mice
were sensitized with chicken egg white protein [oval-
bumin (OVA)] to generate an IgE allergic response. To
induce asthma-like symptoms after sensitization, the
mice were then exposed to nebulized OVA (nose-only).
This treatment results in the mice developing pulmo-
nary
inflammation,
airways
hyperresponsiveness,
eosinophilia, and mucus hyperproduction, each repre-
sentative of hallmark symptoms of human allergic
asthma. Remarkably, R-DOI at doses as low as 0.01
mg/kg administered nose-only prior to OVA adminis-
tration prevented the symptoms of allergic asthma from
developing, including inflammation and eosinophilia.
In mechanistic studies, cells of the lung were further
analyzed by both gene expression and flow cytometry.
Some, but not all, proinflammatory cytokines were
found to be repressed in the R-DOI pretreated animals.
For example, expression of IL-4, a proinflammatory
cytokine implicated in asthma was unaffected by R-
DOI, whereas expression levels of others including IL-5,
IL-13, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
factor were all significantly reduced. These results
suggested that unlike conventional anti-inflammatory
treatments like steroids, which simply repress the
immune system, R-DOI selectively targets only certain
key components relevant to the pathology.
The nature of proinflammatory markers inhibited by
R-DOI suggested effects on T-helper Th2 cells and/or
innate immune cells, each of which is known to express
5-HT2A receptors. Flow cytometric analysis indicated
that not only was R-DOI leading to a reduction in
overall Th2 cells, but that these cells were also pro-
ducing fewer proinflammatory cytokines. In addition to
its effect on Th2 cells, DOI also has been demonstrated
to have a suppressive effect on spleen and blood
peripheral CD8+ cells (Davydova et al., 2010) and the
recruitment of eosinophils (Kang et al., 2013).
It remains to be determined whether the effects of R-
DOI on these immune cells, and on its ability to prevent
the development of asthma, involves blockade of TNF-a
signaling. Together, each of these studies indicates that
agonism of 5-HT2A receptors may be a novel small
molecule steroid-sparing therapeutic strategy to treat
inflammatory diseases that include asthma, atheroscle-
rosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Importantly, the
doses of R-DOI necessary to produce these therapeutic
effects are orders of magnitude lower than those
necessary to influence behaviors.
Genetic variations in the 5-HT2A receptor may also be
associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Previous
studies had shown an association between the rs6313
(T102C polymorphism) of the 5-HT2A receptor gene and
certain diseases with musculoskeletal manifestations
(Kling et al., 2008, and references therein). To examine
this issue further, Kling et al. (2008) analyzed a
Northern Swedish study population of 292 patients
with RA. For further analysis of additional single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), they used the Epi-
demiologic Investigation of Rheumatoid Arthritis study
population of 2168 patients with RA. Their control
group was composed of 524 subjects drawn from three
Swedish population-based medical biobanks. In the
study population from Northern Sweden, the frequency
distribution of rs6313 (T102C) genotypes differed sig-
nificantly between the RA patients and the controls (P =
0.006). They tested the same variation in the larger
Epidemiologic Investigation of Rheumatoid Arthritis
study population and also performed genotyping for
seven more SNPs along the gene sequence. The rs6313
(T102C) single marker association with RA was repli-
cated in this larger study population. Haplotype anal-
ysis with the inclusion of four of the SNPs revealed
strong evidence for association of variations in the
5-HT2A receptor gene with RA, with both protective
and susceptible haplotypes that associated with a
significantly decreased or increased risk of developing
RA. Although this report made no reference to the effect
of a 5-HT2A agonist or antagonist in RA, taken together
with the studies discussed just above it seems possible
that an agonist ligand for the 5-HT2A receptor might
have some therapeutic efficacy in RA.
In mice, administration of 1 mg/kg DOI led to immune
response suppression and reduction of spleen and
peripheral blood
CD8(+)
T
cell
counts,
with
the
cytotoxic/suppressor function (Davydova et al., 2010).
The effect was blocked by administration of the 5-HT2A–
selective antagonist ketanserin. These data also dem-
onstrate the mediation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor
in the immune response.
Szabo (2015) recently proposed that the psychedelic
tryptamines N,N-DMT and 5-MeO-DMT may have
immunomodulatory effects mediated through the s-1
receptor. Pretreatment of human primary monocyte-
derived dendritic cells with 100 mM DMT or 5-MeO-
DMT was able significantly to attenuate the production
of proinflammatory cytokines after treatment of the
cells with bacterial lipopolysaccharide or high molecu-
lar weight polyinosinic/polycytidylic acid. Szabo (2015)
concluded that dimethyltryptamines may serve as
important regulators of both innate and adaptive
immunity.
M. Effects on Cell Differentiation and Growth
Serotonin is an important modulator of cell differen-
tiation and growth. The receptors most closely linked to
these processes are the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors.
Furthermore, activation of 5-HT2 receptors in multiple
cell types influences actin cytoskeletal structure and
dynamics, which influences processes including cell
Psychedelics
335
 motility and axon growth. The most infamous example
of 5-HT2 receptor activation having an impact on cell
growth is the potentially fatal hyperplasia associated
with the cardiac valvulopathy induced by fenfluramine,
which was a component of the diet drug fenfluramine/
phentermine. Here, fenfluramine and its active metab-
olite norfenfluramine activated 5-HT2B receptors in
heart valve and cardiac tissues, causing them to pro-
liferate and develop heart valve disease and cardiac
fibrosis. Although all known classic psychedelics pro-
duce their behavioral effects through activation of 5-
HT2A receptors, they also have significant 5-HT2B
receptor agonist activity at the doses necessary for
behavioral effects. Activation of 5-HT2A receptors di-
rectly in certain tissues including vascular, placental,
and cancers can also have a proliferative effect (Sonier
et al., 2005; Göoz et al., 2006; Liu and Fanburg, 2008;
Chen et al., 2014), suggesting that the classic psyche-
delics may also have an effect on these processes. The
molecular mechanisms underlying the proliferative
effects largely appear to involve activation of ERK/
MAPK signaling downstream from the receptor.
The 5-HT2A receptor has been identified as a mito-
genic receptor in human placental choriocarcinoma cell
lines (and in a rat glomerular mesangial cell line) as
coupled to several mitogenic signal transduction path-
ways and potentially oncogenic for its transforming
properties in transfected NIH3T3 cells (see references
in Sonier et al., 2006). Thus, Sonier et al. (2006)
examined 5-HT2A receptor expression in human breast
cancer cell line MCF-7. They tested the effect of 5-HT
and DOI on MCF-7 cell proliferation using 3-(4,5-
dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
cell proliferation assays. Their results showed that 5-
HT2A receptor mRNA and protein are expressed in
MCF-7 cells, and that 5-HT has a positive proliferative
effect on these cells, at least partly through stimulation
of 5-HT2A receptors. A dose-response effect was de-
termined for both 5-HT and DOI, revealing that 5-HT
stimulated MCF-7 proliferation up to 52.2% at a
concentration of 10 mM. DOI had a maximum pro-
liferative effect of 34.4% at a concentration of 10 mM.
Hirai et al. (2010) evaluated the involvement of 5-HT
receptor subtypes in mouse MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts.
Both DOI and 5-HT increased proliferative activity of
MC3T3-E1 cells in a concentration-dependent manner,
an effect that was blocked by ketanserin. DOI-induced
cell proliferation and phosphorylation of ERK1 and
ERK2 was blocked by PD98059 [2-(2-amino-3-methoxy-
phenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one]
and
U0126
[1,4-di-
amino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[2-aminophenylthio]butadiene],
selective inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinase (MEK). The results suggest that the 5-HT2A
receptor may be functionally expressed to regulate
mechanisms underlying osteoblast cell proliferation,
at least in part through activation of ERK/MAPK
pathways in these cells.
Oufkir et al. (2010) evaluated the effect of DOI on cell
viability, cell cycle progression, and activation of the
MEK-ERK1/2 and the Janus kinase 2–signal trans-
ducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling path-
ways in trophoblast-like BeWo and JEG-3 cancer cell
lines. JEG-3 and BeWo cells are human placental
choriocarcinoma cell lines that have been widely used
as in vitro models for the placenta. Oufkir et al. (2010)
found that activation of the 5-HT2A receptor by DOI
promoted viability of BeWo and JEG-3 cells. Although
DOI is a nonselective 5-HT2A/2C agonist, these effects
were blocked by pretreating the cells with ketanserin, a
5-HT2A–selective antagonist. DOI treatment signifi-
cantly increased both MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphory-
lation in a time-dependent fashion. DOI also promoted
interaction between Janus kinase 2 and the 5-HT2A
receptor. The work of Oufkir et al. (2010) suggests that
5-HT2A receptors may be involved in regulation of
placentation and may play a role in the pathophysiology
of pregnancy disorders associated with alteration in
placental development.
X. Models of Psychosis
Halberstadt and Geyer (2013b) recently reviewed the
topic of serotonergic hallucinogens as translational
models relevant to schizophrenia. In their review, they
note the many early groups that studied the effects of
LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin, who concluded that
these drugs produced mental states that resembled the
earliest phases of schizophrenia. Although the similar-
ities between the effects of serotonergic psychedelics
and schizophrenia are not as great as were initially
believed, a number of animal models have nevertheless
been developed to facilitate understanding of the role
that 5-HT plays in schizophrenia, to help characterize
interactions between 5-HT and other neurotransmitter
systems, and to identify novel pharmacotherapies. The
four widely used animal behavioral models are startle
habituation, PPI, HTRs in rodents, and deficits in
temporal processing (interval timing). Each of these
models is extensively discussed in this review, and it is
pointed out that the 5-HT2A receptor plays a fundamen-
tal role in each of them and is also known to be an
important target for atypical antipsychotic drugs.
To provide a bit more specific detail here, the actions
of psychedelics such as DOI, psilocybin, and LSD have
been considered to model, to a certain extent, some of
the positive symptoms of schizophrenia (see reviews
by Vollenweider et al., 1998; Geyer et al., 2001;
Vollenweider, 2001; Vollenweider and Geyer, 2001).
Schizophrenia patients with predominantly negative
symptoms exhibit reduced prefrontal activation com-
pared with patients without negative symptoms. For
example, using [18F]fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, it was
found that schizophrenia subjects with predominantly
negative symptoms have a lower glucose metabolic rate
336
Nichols
 than subjects with predominantly positive symptoms,
particularly in frontal, temporal, and cerebellar cir-
cuitry (Potkin et al., 2002). By contrast, schizophrenia
patients with positive symptomatology have increased
frontal metabolic rate of glucose. Soyka et al. (2005)
used [18F]FDG PET in 10 unmedicated schizophrenia
patients with vivid positive symptoms. Schizophrenia
patients had higher, but nonsignificant, regional meta-
bolic rates of glucose in almost all quantified regions
compared with controls, but the right/left frontal-
occipital metabolic ratio was significantly higher for
the schizophrenia patients, indicating a hypermetabolic
pattern.
PPI of the ASR has been used as a measure of
sensorimotor gating and is considered an example of
mechanisms that limit sensory information overflow,
facilitate selective attention, and enable efficient pro-
cessing of relevant information (Vollenweider et al.,
2007). Reductions in PPI have been consistently shown
in schizophrenia; in rats, DOI disrupts PPI, an effect
that could be blocked by M100907 (see references in
Vollenweider et al., 2007). In this study, 16 subjects
received placebo or 115, 215, or 315 mg/kg psilocybin at
4-week intervals in a randomized and counterbalanced
order. PPI at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 30, 60,
120, 240, and 2000 milliseconds was measured 90 and
165 minutes after psilocybin administration. Acoustic
startle stimuli were presented through headphones,
and the eyeblink component of the ASR was measured
with an electromyography startle system. Subjective
effects of drug and placebo were assessed using the 5D-
ASC, and effects of psilocybin on sustained atten-
tion were assessed using the FAIR test. Psilocybin
was found to reduce PPI dose-dependently at short
(30-millisecond) ISIs, had no effect at medium
(60-millisecond) ISIs, and increased PPI at long (120-
to 2000-millisecond) ISIs, without affecting startle re-
activity or habituation. Psilocybin impaired attentional
performance, reducing the FAIR attentional perfor-
mance capacity score P as well as score Q indexing the
number of attentively made decisions relative to the
total decisions, and the attentional continuity perfor-
mance score C. The reduction in the P and C scores was
significant after the low, medium, or high dose, whereas
the reduction in the Q score was significant only after
the peak effect of the high dose of psilocybin. Psilocybin-
induced impairments in sustained attention perfor-
mance were positively correlated with reduced PPI at
the 30-millisecond ISI, but not with the concomitant
increases in PPI observed at long ISIs. Psilocybin also
produced a decrease in PPI at short ISIs that is
correlated with impaired attention and consistent with
deficient PPI in schizophrenia.
In another investigation of effects of psychedelics on
PPI, 15 healthy volunteers were enrolled in a double-
blind crossover study with two doses of DMT and (S)-
ketamine (Heekeren et al., 2007). A low dose of DMT
fumarate (0.15 or 0.2 mg/kg) was given as an intrave-
nous bolus over 5 minutes, followed 1 minute later by a
continuous infusion of 0.01125 or 0.015 mg/kg per
minute over 84 minutes. A high dose of DMT (0.2 or
0.3 mg/kg bolus) was followed by continuous infusion of
0.015 or 0.02 mg/kg per minute. For ketamine, a low
dose was a bolus injection over 5 minutes of 0.1 or
0.15 mg/kg, followed by continuous infusion of 0.0066 or
0.01 mg/kg per minute over 54 minutes, followed by a
continuous infusion of 75% of the previous dose over 30
minutes. The high dose of ketamine was a bolus in-
jection of 0.15 or 0.2 mg/kg, then continuous infusion
with 0.01 or 0.015 mg/kg per minute over 54 minutes,
followed by continuous infusion at a rate of 75% of the
previous dose over 30 minutes. The psychologic effects
of both drugs were fully developed within 15 minutes
and were kept relatively constant over the following 75
minutes (see additional details in Gouzoulis-Mayfrank
et al., 2005). Both drugs dose-dependently induced
symptoms resembling the positive symptoms of schizo-
phrenia, but positive formal thought disorder and
inappropriate affect were stronger after DMT. Phenom-
ena resembling negative symptoms of schizophrenia
were stronger after S-ketamine. Acoustic startle was
then measured and, surprisingly, there was no signifi-
cant difference in PPI between baseline and DMT. Both
S-ketamine doses marginally or significantly increased
PPI compared with baseline at the 100-millisecond, but
not at the 240-millisecond, lead interval. These results
do not support the hypothesis of sensorimotor gating
deficits in humans after administration of hallucino-
gens, although the authors note methodological limita-
tions, including the small sample size.
XI. Use as Tools to Study Brain Function
and Connectivity
The advent of powerful brain imaging technologies
such as fMRI, PET, and MEG has allowed rapid ad-
vances in our understanding of the areas and functions
of the brain responsible for a variety of behavioral and
cognitive tasks. Based on the convergence of ideas about
the substrates of consciousness and the recognition that
psychedelics target the most important of these, it
should be no surprise that psychedelics, in particular
agonist ligands for the 5-HT2A receptor, can be powerful
tools to study how the brain works.
The field of cognitive neuroscience is addressing the
challenge of attempting to understand consciousness
and how it arises within the brain. Surely the psyche-
delics, one of the most potent drug classes known that
alter consciousness, should play an increasingly impor-
tant role in that investigation. We know now that there
is no “seat” of consciousness, and that consciousness is
not a property of a single brain location but more likely
arises as the result of dynamic interactions among
widely distributed groups of neurons that integrate a
Psychedelics
337
 very large number of sensory inputs and motor re-
sponses occurring in parallel. Edelman (1989) empha-
sized that consciousness concerns the rapid integration
of signals from a great variety of modalities and
submodalities to create a unified, coherent scene or
idea. When one considers all of the key brain areas
noted in this review that either express or are directly
affected by 5-HT2A agonist interactions, it should be no
surprise that the psychopharmacology of psychedelics is
so complex.
Even with the development of modern brain scanning
technologies, however, the overall action of psychedelics
in the brain is far from being understood. Psychedelics
act as agonists or partial agonists at serotonin 5-HT2A,
5-HT2C, and 5-HT1A receptors, with downstream effects
on glutamate, GABA, and dopamine, among others, in a
multitude of loci in the brain (Vollenweider and Geyer,
2001). Although it is the scientific consensus that
activation of brain 5-HT2A receptors is the central event
in the action of psychedelics (Nichols, 2004; Halberstadt,
2015), that statement of what outwardly might seem to
be a simple pharmacology fails to completely capture
the overall consequences of that action within the
dynamic interacting human brain.
Brain imaging studies have begun to offer some
preliminary answers, but a tremendous amount of
science remains to carried out before (or if) we can begin
to understand the complex psychopharmacology that
occurs in the intact human brain after administration of
a psychedelic such as LSD. All that being said, however,
a few studies have begun to characterize neurobiologi-
cal effects of psychedelics.
In an early study, Hermle et al. (1992) employed
99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneaminoxime SPECT to mea-
sure regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) in 12 healthy
male subjects after administration of a relatively large
500-mg dose of mescaline sulfate. The functional brain
imaging showed an increase in regional CBF in both
anterior regions and an even more pronounced increase
in right anterior cortical regions, indicating a pattern of
hyperfrontality. The authors note, however, that it was
not known how CBF correlated with neuronal activity.
Acute neurometabolic effects of psilocybin in humans
also were initially measured on the regional cerebral
metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglu) in humans using
[18F]FDG PET in the laboratories of Vollenweider et al.
(1997a,b) and Gouzoulis-Mayfrank et al. (1999).
Correlational analysis between normalized metabolic
activity and psychologic dimensions of the APZ ques-
tionnaire revealed that the severity of “oceanic bound-
lessness” (OB, one factor of the APZ questionnaire)
induced by psilocybin correlated positively with
CMRglu bilaterally in the frontomedial superior, fronto-
lateral, and left inferolateral PFC and ACC, as well as
bilaterally in the inferior parietal and occipitomedial
cortex (Vollenweider, 2001). Negative correlations were
found between OB and CMRglu bilaterally in the
hippocampus and caudate nucleus, and left amygdala
and ventral striatum. The severity of “anxious ego
dissolution” positively correlated with CMRglu in the
thalamus and left temporomedial gyrus and negatively
correlated with CMRglu bilaterally in the OFC and
adjacent ACC. Thus, anxious ego dissolution and the
associated thought disorder appear to depend mainly on
thalamic overactivity and orbitofrontal underactivity.
In the study by Vollenweider et al. (1997b), effective
doses of psilocybin produced a global increase of CMRglu,
with significant and most marked increases in the
frontomedial and frontolateral cortex (24.3%), ACC
(24.9%), and temporomedial cortex (25.3%). In the study
by Gouzoulis-Mayfrank et al. (1999), psilocybin increased
regional cerebral glucose metabolism in distinct right
hemispheric frontotemporal cortical regions, particularly
in the ACC, consistent with the findings of Vollenweider
et al. (1997b). These results indicate that psilocybin leads
to increased cortical activation.
The spatial resolution of ayahuasca-induced changes
in brain electrical activity was investigated in 18
volunteers using low-resolution electromagnetic tomog-
raphy (Riba et al., 2004). Analyses of EEG sources
showed changes in current density in the ACC, but even
more so in the PCC. These electrophysiological findings
have been replicated in a MEG study of psilocybin use
(Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013).
To examine the neural correlates of acute ayahuasca
effects, Riba et al. (2006) used single-photon emission
tomography to study regional CBF after acute admin-
istration of ayahuasca to 15 healthy volunteers. Aya-
huasca administration led to bilateral activation of the
anterior insula/inferior frontal gyrus, with greater
intensity seen in the right hemisphere. Additional
increased blood perfusion was observed in the fronto-
medial wall of the right hemisphere, with the largest
cluster of suprathreshold voxels located in the ACC/medial
frontal gyrus. No significant decreases in regional CBF
were observed anywhere in the brain. These effects were
consistent with the earlier SPECT study by Hermle et al.
(1992) and with data from studies on psilocybin that
employed [18F]FDG PET (Vollenweider et al., 1997b).
Evidence from animal and human studies suggests
that psychedelics disrupt information processing in
cortico–striato–thalamocortical (CSTC) feedback loops
that have been implicated in sensory and sensorimotor
gating of internal and external information to the
cortex (Vollenweider and Geyer, 2001; Geyer and
Vollenweider, 2008). It is widely believed that the
thalamocortical system is essential for conscious activ-
ity (Edelman, 2003), and that thalamocortical interac-
tions play a special role in the integration of distributed
neural activity across wide cortical regions and in
the generation of conscious experience (Tononi and
Edelman, 1998). The so-called CSTC model of informa-
tion processing proposes that deficits in early informa-
tion processing may underlie alterations in perception,
338
Nichols
 cognition, and the sense of self seen in psychedelic-
induced ASC (Vollenweider and Geyer, 2001). This
model suggests that the inability to filter, inhibit, and
screen out exteroceptive and interoceptive stimuli may
lead to sensory overload and a breakdown of cognitive
integrity, leading to hallucinations and alterations of
ego functioning. Deficits in preattentive sensorimotor
gating have been reported repeatedly after psilocybin
and LSD administration (Vollenweider et al., 2007;
Quednow et al., 2012; Schmid et al., 2015) and have
been related to alterations in cognitive functioning
(Vollenweider et al., 2007; Quednow et al., 2012). The
CSTC model proposes that the thalamus plays a key
role within CSTC feedback loops for gating external and
internal information to the cortex, and therefore is
crucially involved in the regulation of the level of
awareness and attention (Vollenweider et al., 2007;
Geyer and Vollenweider, 2008).
This view is consistent with the information integra-
tion theory of consciousness (Tononi, 2004), which
proposes that the thalamus and thalamocortical system
play a key role in integrating information and ensuing
consciousness. Psychedelics may alter thalamocortical
transmission by stimulating 5-HT2A receptors lo-
cated in several key components of the CSTC loops
(Vollenweider et al., 2007; Geyer and Vollenweider,
2008). This interpretation is consistent with the
neuroimaging studies showing that oral administra-
tion of psilocybin, mescaline, and DMT alter neuronal
activity during their peak effects in the frontomedial
and frontolateral cortices (“hyperfrontality”), basal
ganglia, and thalamus (Hermle et al., 1992, 1998;
Gouzoulis-Mayfrank et al., 1999; Riba et al., 2006),
variously correlating with different dimensions of
psychedelic states (Vollenweider and Geyer, 2001).
A recent fMRI study, however, reported an overall
decrease of brain activity in the medial frontal
cortex after intravenous administration of psilocybin
(Carhart-Harris et al., 2012). Notably, the reported
decrease correlates with a suppression of the DMN
(Buckner et al., 2008). Subjective observations support
what might be described as a loosening of the “sense of
self,” or a loss of ego structure, with feelings of unity and
oneness with others and the world (Dittrich, 1998;
Griffiths et al., 2006). As will be discussed shortly, the
fMRI data from this study have been reanalyzed at least
twice to develop further hypotheses about the psyche-
delic state.
Interpretation of fMRI data is not straightforward,
however, because the hemodynamic changes that the
imaging signals depend on, such as the BOLD response,
are not a direct measure of neuronal activity but arise
from the relationship between hemodynamic changes
and underlying neuronal activity (Logothetis, 2008).
The BOLD signal measures local fluctuations in deox-
yhemoglobin concentrations, and some degree of con-
troversy remains as to what the BOLD signal actually
represents (Viswanathan and Freeman, 2007). It is
known that cerebral vasoconstrictors can cause an
increase in deoxyhemoglobin concentration, resulting
in a decrease in the BOLD baseline resting signal
(Mulderink et al., 2002). Thus, using hemodynamic
neuroimaging signals as proxy measures for neuronal
activity makes off-target effects, including nonhalluci-
nogenic and peripheral actions mediated by other re-
ceptor subtypes, an important consideration if a drug
has vasoactive properties in addition to its effects on
neurons.
Early autoradiographic studies by Jueptner and
Weiller (1995) indicated that perisynaptic activity,
representing primarily input and local processing in
the cortex, rather than cell bodies, accounts for the
major part of cortical metabolic energy demands. Con-
sistent with that finding, simultaneous measurement of
intracortical activity and fMRI in the nonhuman pri-
mate has demonstrated that local field potential (LFP)
generated by a local neuronal network is more closely
related to the BOLD signal than multiunit activity
(MUA) of the same network (Logothetis et al., 2001).
In his review on the underpinnings of the BOLD fMRI
signal, Logothetis (2003) concentrated on one aspect of
what is a complex issue, namely the type of neural
activity that plays a dominant role in the generation of
the imaging signal capitalizing on the BOLD contrast
mechanism. LFPs, the low frequency range of the mean
extracellular field potentials, mostly represent slow
events reflecting cooperative activity in neural popula-
tions. Afterpotentials, with a duration on the order of
tens of milliseconds, most likely contribute to the
generation of LFP signals. LFPs represent slow wave-
forms that include synaptic potentials, afterpotentials
of somatodendritic spikes, and voltage-gated membrane
oscillations and reflect the input of a particular cortical
area, as well as its local intracortical processing, in-
cluding the activity of both excitatory and inhibitory
interneurons. Logothetis (2003) initially applied linear
systems analysis to examine the relationship of the
BOLD fMRI signal to the different types of neural
activities and found that the BOLD response “indisput-
ably and directly reflects a local increase in neural
activity assessed by the mean extracellular field poten-
tial (mEFP) signal.”
Rauch et al. (2008) also explored the relationship
between the BOLD signal and LFPs and MUA. They
simultaneously recorded BOLD and electrophysiological
activity in primary visual cortex V1 of anesthetized
monkeys while inducing a dissociation of MUA from LFP
activity by local injections of the 5-HT1A agonist BP554.
Infusion of BP554 (1-[3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenoxy)
propyl]-4-phenyl-piperazine) into the visual cortex reduced
MUA reliably without affecting either LFP or BOLD.
BP554 presumably activated 5-HT1A receptors located on
the axon hillock in layer 3 and 5 pyramidal neurons,
hyperpolarizing the cells so that they could reach a spiking
Psychedelics
339
 threshold only under a much heavier synaptic load. Rauch
et al. (2008) reported that infusion of BP554 had no effect
on either LFP or the BOLD signal, but did significantly
decrease MUA, and they concluded that the BOLD signal
is well predicted by LFP.
Viswanathan and Freeman (2007) used a dual micro-
electrode arrangement to make simultaneous colocal-
ized extracellular measurements of tissue oxygen and
neural activity in the cortex of the cat primary visual
cortex to determine whether the BOLD signal reflected
mainly neuronal input (synaptic activity) or neuronal
output (spiking activity). They report that changes in
tissue oxygen were more closely coupled with LFPs than
with neuronal spikes. Their results suggest that the
BOLD fMRI signal primarily reflects neuronal input,
rather than neuronal output (spiking activity).
As shown in their earlier study (Puig et al., 2003),
systemic DOI evoked a dramatic increase in the firing
rate of a subpopulation of PFC pyramidal neurons.
Celada et al. (2008) extended their earlier approach by
showing the effect of DOI on burst firing and LFPs, in
which firing rate was increased by DOI. Yet DOI
markedly reduced the amplitude of low frequency (3 to
4 Hz) oscillations in the mPFC, an effect that was
completely blocked by M100907 but was not attenuated
by thalamic lesions, supporting an intracortical origin
for the effects of DOI. They demonstrate that DOI
disrupts cortical activity by reducing low frequency
oscillations (3 to 4 Hz) and by desynchronizing pyrami-
dal discharge from active phases of slow oscillations.
Slow oscillatory activity reflects alternating periods of
activity and silence (“up” and “down” states) of cortico–
thalamo–cortical networks that result from synchro-
nized changes in membrane potential and synaptic
activity of neuronal ensembles.
Wood et al. (2012) compared the effect of DOI with
amphetamine and MK-801 on PFC neuronal activity in
freely moving rats. They implanted microelectrode
arrays in male rats and measured neuronal activity in
the OFC and ACC. Their study was the first to in-
vestigate the effects of a psychedelic on cortical neuro-
physiology in awake animals. They analyzed neuronal
population activity, LFP power, and correlations be-
tween spike-discharge power and LFP power. DOI
(1 mg/kg) significantly reduced population activity in
OFC compared with baseline, with larger doses of DOI
producing greater population suppression. DOI (3–
5 mg/kg) suppressed population activity in the ACC in
a similar fashion, although the 1-mg/kg dose failed to
have an effect. The 3-mg/kg dose of DOI significantly
decreased low (30–55 Hz) and high (55–80 Hz) g power
in the OFC. A similar trend was observed in the ACC.
The reduced g in both OFC and ACC power is an effect
that disrupts spike timing. The lowest dose of DOI drove
weak and sporadic increases in ACC single-unit activ-
ity, which did not modulate population activity, but
larger doses of DOI predominantly decreased activity
of individual ACC units in a sustained fashion. The data
of Wood et al. (2012) indicate that a common effect of
psychedelics in the PFC may be to reduce the sponta-
neous coupling of single-unit activity with g oscillations.
The integrity of cortical networks depends on maintain-
ing a delicate balance of inhibitory and excitatory
neurotransmission. Thus, excitation or inhibition pro-
duced by these drugs at any node in a neuronal network
could potentially disrupt the activity of that network,
leading to perceptual disorganization and cognitive
effects. Disruption of spontaneous g power may be
indicative of, or cause, disrupted network signaling.
Taken together, these data demonstrate that psyche-
delics decouple single-unit discharge from rhythmic
oscillation in the OFC and ACC, thereby decreasing
coordination of neuronal populations.
Functional connectivity analysis, using independent
component analysis, of the data from a 2012 study
(Carhart-Harris et al., 2012), revealed increased DMN
and task positive network (TPN) functional connectiv-
ity, therefore showing a decrease in DMN-TPN orthog-
onality after psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2013).
Carhart-Harris et al. propose that increased DMN-TPN
coupling in the presence of preserved thalamocortical
connectivity is related to a state in which arousal is
preserved but the distinction between inner thought
and external focus becomes blurred.
To directly assess the effects of a psychedelic drug on
neural activity in the human brain, Muthukumaraswamy
et al. (2013) performed MEG to record broadband
(1–100 Hz) neural activity directly in 15 healthy
volunteers with prior experience with psychedelics
who were given 2 mg psilocybin intravenously. Sub-
jective effects began within seconds, allowing the
capture of the transition from normal waking conscious-
ness to the psychedelic state. Approximately 6 minutes
after the infusion, participants performed a visuomotor
task designed to elicit stimulus-induced g band oscilla-
tions in the primary visual and motor cortex. Five
minutes of resting MEG was recorded; the participant
was then infused with psilocybin over 60 seconds and
5 minutes of resting MEG was recorded immediately
after infusion. The authors reported decreased oscilla-
tory power across a broad frequency range after psilo-
cybin, mainly localized to association cortices, with
marked decreases in areas of the DMN such as the
PCC. They recovered 11 functional brain networks, 7 of
which showed postpsilocybin infusion decreases in
oscillatory power in the frequency bands from which
they were derived. A further four networks were
identified that did not pass the significance criterion,
but activity in these networks was consistently de-
creased by psilocybin.
Muthukumaraswamy et al. (2013) set up a model in
which drug effects could be accounted for by differential
gain (or excitability) of each of four cell types: inhibitory
interneurons, superficial pyramidal cells, spiny stellate
340
Nichols
 cells, and deep pyramidal cells. Their model showed a
psilocybin-dependent increase in excitability of deep-
layer pyramidal cells. Excitation of deep-layer pyrami-
dal cells is consistent with decreased brain activity and
oscillatory power because the net effect of feedback
connections is thought to be inhibitory. Participants
performed the visuomotor task reasonably well but
were marginally slower after psilocybin than placebo.
The authors conducted exploratory correlations be-
tween resting postpsilocybin infusion decreases in a
power extracted from a PCC mask, because PCC a
power decreases were especially marked. Two items
from their subjective state questionnaire showed posi-
tive significant correlations with a power decreases in
the PCC (“I experienced a disintegration of my ‘self’ or
‘ego’” and “the experience had a supernatural quality”).
Positive correlations also were found between deep-
layer pyramidal cell excitation and the magnitude of the
decreases in PCC a power. Muthukumaraswamy et al.
(2013) observed a broadband desynchronization of
cortical oscillatory rhythms after psilocybin infusions
and decreased brain network integrity. The fact that the
decreases occurred in all of the frequency bands sug-
gested a general collapse of the normal rhythmic
structure of cortical activity, consistent with the sug-
gestion by Carhart-Harris et al. (2012) that psyche-
delics disorganize spontaneous brain activity.
The MEG source localizations they found were con-
sistent with previous fMRI results (Carhart-Harris
et al., 2012) including the PCC, precuneus, superior
and middle frontal gyri, ACC, and supramarginal and
precentral gyri, which represent hub areas of the
association cortex rather than primary sensory cortex.
The PCC showed especially marked effects, which
correlated with the drug’s subjective effects. The
pharmacologically driven suppression of all observed
networks suggested a general disorganization of
network-level activity during resting conditions consis-
tent with EEG studies that found decreased cortical
synchrony after ingestion of the psychedelic plant brew
ayahuasca (Riba et al., 2004). They propose that the
marked a power decreases observed with psilocybin
were likely due to interference with the intrinsic a
oscillations of deep-layer pyramidal neurons via stimu-
lation of the 5-HT2A receptor.
Riga et al. (2014) examined the effect of systemic 5-
MeO-DMT on cortical function in rats using single-unit
and LFP recordings and also assessed regional brain
activity by BOLD fMRI. Their studies were carried out
in chloral hydrate–anesthetized rats pretreated with
the selective MAO-A inhibitor clorgyline to prevent the
metabolism of 5-MeO-DMT and to mimic the effects of
ayahuasca. They found that 5-MeO-DMT disrupted
mPFC activity, increasing and decreasing the discharge
of 51% and 35% of the recorded pyramidal neurons,
respectively, and reducing (231%) the power of low
frequency cortical oscillations (LFCOs); overall, 5-MeO-
DMT increased pyramidal cell firing rate to 215% of
baseline. The latter effect depended on both 5-HT1A and
5-HT2A receptor activation because when WAY-100635
and M100907 were administered together, the decrease
in LFCOs induced by 5-MeO-DMT in the mPFC was
reversed. However, if WAY-100635 and M100907 were
administered separately, neither antagonist blocked
the effect of 5-MeO-DMT on LFCOs. This finding is
consistent with behavioral studies showing that indole-
amines can have a significant behavioral component
mediated by activation of 5-HT1A receptors (Winter
et al., 2000b; Krebs-Thomson et al., 2006; Halberstadt
and Geyer, 2011). The mGlu2/3 agonist LY379268 also
fully reversed the effect of 5-MeO-DMT on LFCOs.
The BOLD responses in visual cortex V1 and mPFC
observed by Riga et al. (2014) were also decreased by 5-
MeO-DMT. Simultaneous recordings in the mPFC and
V1 indicated that 5-MeO-DMT concurrently reduced
the amplitude of LFCOs similarly in both areas. In
parallel with the effect on pyramidal discharge, 5-MeO-
DMT significantly reduced the amplitude of LFCOs in
the
mPFC.
Thus,
5-MeO-DMT
markedly
reduced
LFCOs in the mPFC and V1, an action potentially
related to its psychedelic activity. It evoked a disrupted
activity state characterized by altered pyramidal neu-
ron discharge/pattern and reduced intensity of LFCOs.
Riga et al. (2014) suggest that 5-MeO-DMT–evoked
alterations in PFC activity likely lead to secondary
changes in several brain networks.
Riga et al. (2014) indicate that the reduction in BOLD
signal appears paradoxical, given the overall increase in
pyramidal discharge rate produced by 5-MeO-DMT and
the relationship between neuronal discharge, energy
consumption, and blood flow, noting that some studies
suggest a better correlation with oscillatory activ-
ity rather than spiking activity (Logothetis, 2003;
Viswanathan and Freeman, 2007). They conclude that
reductions in LFCOs appear to be a common signature
of psychedelic drugs but note that further work is
required to understand the relationship between BOLD
signal and neuronal activity.
This study has relevance to clinical studies of psilo-
cybin. Although the salient features of psilocybin
intoxication are blocked by the selective 5-HT2A
antagonist ketanserin (Vollenweider et al., 1998), psi-
locin (the active form derived in vivo by dephosphory-
lation of psilocybin) also has significant agonist activity
at the 5-HT1A receptor (e.g., Blair et al., 2000). It is
unknown to what extent intravenous administration of
psilocybin might produce effects on neuronal function
through activation of 5-HT1A receptors.
Tagliazucchi et al. (2014) carried out a reanalysis of
the previously published data from Carhart-Harris
et al. (2012). Their new analyses were prompted by a
view that more sensitive and specific indices might help
to develop a better understanding of the neurobiology of
conscious states, and specifically that measures that
Psychedelics
341
 include variance over time might be especially informa-
tive. They note that the brain has been described as a
system resting in (or near) a critical point or transition
zone between states of order and disorder (see refer-
ences in Tagliazucchi et al., 2014). They therefore tested
the hypothesis that the brain can explore a maximal
repertoire of its possible dynamic states in this critical
zone, asking the question as to whether changes in
spontaneous brain activity produced by psilocybin were
consistent with displacement from this critical point,
possibly moving toward a more entropic or supercritical
state (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014). To test this hypoth-
esis, the authors focused on variability in activity and
functional connectivity parameters over time and pre-
sented empirical data that tested the hypothesis that
brain activity becomes less ordered in the psychedelic
state, with enhancement of the repertoire of possible
states. The power spectrum density of the spectral
content of spontaneous BOLD fluctuations can be
characterized by a single parameter a, which condenses
the scaling behavior and is demonstrative of the long-
range temporal correlations of any given signal. Both
BOLD signal variance and total spectral power mea-
sures showed increased variability after psilocybin,
both in the temporal and spectral domain, with peaks
in the ACC and bilateral hippocampus.
Tagliazucchi et al. (2014) selected four regions of
interest for BOLD variance and computed the evolution
of their variance. Although these ROIs were selected
precisely because they had fluctuations in their activity
and corresponding increased variance, their analysis
provided additional information about when those
increases occurred. A homogeneous increase in signal
variance was observed during the first 3 minutes of
psilocybin infusion, corresponding to the subjects’ re-
ports that the most intense psychologic effects occurred
within the first 3 minutes of the psilocybin infusion. The
authors also studied the variance of intrahippocampal
connectivity over time and found that variance was
higher in both hippocampi after psilocybin. After psilo-
cybin, diffuse widespread decreases in LFPs and the
scaling exponent a were observed in frontal and parietal
regions, with no changes after placebo. To further
characterize the BOLD fluctuations, the authors trans-
formed whole brain signals into a spatiotemporal point
process and extracted the rate of events and the average
separation between two events. They observed a rate
increase and interval decrease after psilocybin in the
parietal and frontal regions, but no differences after
placebo. Brain networks associated with these changes
were computed from the overlap of the statistical
significance maps with a set of well established resting
state networks. For LFPs and a, significant overlaps were
detected in the default mode, control, and attention
networks, whereas all sensory networks remained un-
affected. For the point-process rate and point-process
interval, the changes were local and confined to the DMN.
Tagliazucchi et al. (2014) also evaluated the entropy
of the distribution of connectivity states in the network
comprised by two ACC ROIs and the bilateral hippo-
campi. An entropy increase was found when comparing
the results between the periods before and after psilo-
cybin infusion, but no change was seen before and after
placebo. Cross-hemispheric connections between hippo-
campal and ACC ROIs were also observed after
psilocybin administration. Thus, the psilocybin state
is characterized by a larger repertoire of states
(i.e., novel motifs that are exclusive to the psychedelic
state). These states were found to be among the most
interconnected states possible.
The resting state networks that exhibited the most
significant changes correspond to higher brain systems
such as the DMN, executive control, and attention
networks, and not primary sensory and motor net-
works. The authors note that the increased amplitude
fluctuations in the hippocampus are particularly in-
triguing considering early depth EEG studies that
recorded similar abnormalities in hippocampal activity
after LSD and mescaline (Schwarz et al., 1956; Monroe
and Heath, 1961). The increased repertoire of meta-
stable states observed with psilocybin may be a mech-
anism by which these phenomena occur. Tagliazucchi et
al. (2014) suggest that altered interhemispheric com-
munication may also be an important component of the
mechanism of action of psychedelics. A primary action of
psilocybin may be to cause a generalized desynchrony
and loss of oscillatory power in higher-level cortical
regions, probably resulting from activation of serotonin
5-HT2A receptors expressed on deep-later pyramidal
neurons.
Scherf and Angenstein (2015) simultaneously mea-
sured generated field EPSPs and BOLD response in the
CA1 region of the rat hippocampus during electrical
stimulation of the contralateral CA3 region. Consecu-
tive stimulations with low-intensity stimulation trains
resulted in clear postsynaptic responses of CA1 pyra-
midal cells, but no significant BOLD response. No
positive correlation was found between the electrophys-
iologic parameters of CA1 pyramidal cell activity and
the BOLD response. Consequently, postsynaptic activ-
ity of pyramidal cells, the most abundant neurons in the
CA1, is not directly linked to the measured BOLD
response.
Palhano-Fontes et al. (2015) used fMRI to inspect the
DMN after ayahuasca administration to 10 healthy
volunteers who were regular users of ayahuasca. Sub-
jects underwent fMRI sessions before and 40 minutes
after ayahuasca intake. Ayahuasca caused a significant
decrease in activity throughout most parts of the DMN,
including its most consistent hubs: the PCC/precuneus
and the mPFC. Their results are consistent with the
notion that the ASC induced by ayahuasca is linked to
the modulation of activity and connectivity of the DMN.
Functional connectivity fMRI maps were constructed
342
Nichols
 before and after ayahuasca administration, and a
comparison of the maps revealed a significant func-
tional connectivity decrease within the PCC/precuneus
after ayahuasca administration, with most of the
contribution for the observed connectivity decrease
driven by the PCC. Although similar to the changes
observed after psilocybin, the changes induced by
ayahuasca did not result in a significantly reduced
coupling between the PCC and mPFC, as observed after
intravenous psilocybin administration (Carhart-Harris
et al., 2012). Overall, these results support the conclu-
sion that the effects of ayahuasca are associated with
diminished DMN activation and decreased functional
connectivity of the PCC/precuneus. They conclude that
the ASC induced by ayahuasca is linked to the modu-
lation of the activity and connectivity of the DMN.
Carhart-Harris et al. (2014) consider the psychedelic
state to be an exemplar of a primitive or primary state of
consciousness that preceded the development of mod-
ern, adult, human, normal waking consciousness. On
the basis of neuroimaging data with psilocybin, they
argue that the defining feature of “primary states” is
elevated entropy in certain aspects of brain function,
such as the repertoire of functional connectivity motifs
that form and fragment across time. They also propose
that entry into primary states depends on the collapse of
the normally highly organized activity within the DMN
and a decoupling between the DMN and the medial
temporal lobes that are normally significantly coupled.
The functional centrality of the DMN is not shared by
other brain networks, implying that as the highest level
of a functional hierarchy, the DMN serves as a central
orchestrator or conductor of global brain function.
Carhart-Harris et al. (2014) previously found a highly
significant positive correlation between the magnitude
of a power decreases in the PCC after psilocybin and the
ratings of the item “I experienced a disintegration of my
‘self’ or ‘ego.’” It is a central hypothesis of their article
that psychedelics induce a primitive state of conscious-
ness. They present a comprehensive model in which
psychedelics 1) activate the 5-HT2A receptor, 2) de-
polarize deep-layer pyramidal neurons, 3) desynchron-
ize cortical activity, 4) “disintegrate” brain networks, 5)
increase network metastability, and 6) increase the
repertoire of connectivity motifs within a limbic/
paralimbic network. The net effect of these processes
is an increase in system entropy as the system enters
criticality proper. Specifically, it is proposed that psy-
chedelics work by dismantling reinforced patterns of
negative thought and behavior by breaking down the
stable spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity upon
which they rest.
The fMRI studies and their various analyses and
reanalyses by Carhart-Harris and colleagues are at
odds with the earlier SPECT and PET imaging studies
and may reflect different methodologies. In particular,
psilocybin is not typically administered to humans by
injection, nor are Psilocybe mushrooms generally taken
in routes other than by mouth. In the Hermle et al.
(1992), Vollenweider et al. (1997a,b), and Gouzoulis-
Mayfrank et al. (1999) studies cited earlier, the drug
was administered orally, but psilocybin was adminis-
tered intravenously in the studies by Carhart-Harris
et al. Subjective reports from the two different routes of
administration indicate profound differences in the
speed of onset, as well as the intensity of the subjective
effects. Psilocybin given orally generally takes about 40
minutes to begin to manifest its effect, with a duration of
action lasting 4–6 hours. By contrast, subjective effects
of 2 mg psilocybin given as an intravenous injection
over 60 seconds begin at the injection period, reach a
sustained peak after 4 minutes, and subside completely
after 45–60 minutes (Carhart-Harris et al., 2011).
Vascular responses resulting from the agonist activity
of psilocin at 5-HT1 family receptors are likely to be
more pronounced after intravenous drug administra-
tion. Oral administration of psilocybin followed by
repeated fMRI scans would lead to perspective on the
temporally related changes in blood flow/brain activa-
tion and the effects of different doses could be examined.
In any event, differences in neuronal activity indices
(metabolic rate of glucose, CBF, or BOLD), and differ-
ences in the intensity, dynamics, and content of
psilocybin-induced symptoms could potentially account
for these apparent discrepancies.
Psilocybin (2 mg/kg, i.v.) administered to rats evoked
phMRI signal increases in a number of regions, including
olfactory and limbic areas and elements of the visual
system (Spain et al., 2015). LFP amplitude in response to
sensory stimuli was decreased by psilocin administration,
concurrently with enhanced CBF. These results suggest
that the hemodynamic signal changes underlying phMRI
responses reflect changes in both neuronal activity and
neurovascular coupling. Thus, phMRI studies cannot be
interpreted solely in terms of the drug effect on neurons.
A further potential confound in BOLD signal interpreta-
tion in the case of psilocin results from its combined
neuronal and vascular effects. Both the 5-HT2A and
5-HT1A receptors can mediate vasoconstriction, and
negative BOLD signals may occur in the presence of
increased neuronal signaling (Angenstein et al., 2009).
The alteration in neurovascular coupling reported by
Spain et al. (2015) might explain, in part, the apparent
discrepancy between fMRI and PET findings of de-
creased CBF (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012) and in-
creased glucose metabolism (Vollenweider et al., 1997b;
Gouzoulis-Mayfrank et al., 1999) in human studies with
psilocybin and related drugs.
Most recently, Carhart-Harris et al. (2016) used
arterial spin labeling (ASL), BOLD, and MEG to image
brain activity in 20 healthy human subjects adminis-
tered 75 mg LSD intravenously. Visual cortex desynch-
ronization and expanded V1 functional connectivity
were found to be correlated with visual hallucinations.
Psychedelics
343
 Dysregulation of high-level regions and networks cor-
related with profound changes in consciousness. The
peak phase of subjective effects of LSD surprisingly
occurred at about 100 minutes after intravenous ad-
ministration, whereas the subjective effects occurred
within minutes after intravenous administration in
their studies with psilocybin. All subjects reported
closed-eye visual hallucinations and marked changes
of consciousness. Decreased parahippocampus resting
state functional connectivity correlated with ego disso-
lution and altered meaning. Principal findings included
the following: 1) increased visual cortex CBF, resting
state functional connectivity (RSFC), and decreased a
power, predicting the intensity of visual hallucinations;
and 2) decreased DMN “integrity”, parahippocampus-
RSC/PCC resting state functional connectivity and d
and a power (e.g., in the PCC), all predicting profound
changes in consciousness, characterized by ego dissolu-
tion. Results more broadly revealed that resting state
BOLD functional connectivity and MEG measures (but
less so CBF) possess considerable power to predict the
psychologic effects of LSD. Strong relationships were
found between the different imaging measures, partic-
ularly between changes in BOLD RSFC (e.g., network
“disintegration” and “desegregation”) and changes
(decreases) in oscillatory power. Surprisingly, although
the effects of LSD on the visual system were pronounced,
they did not correlate with its effects on consciousness.
Consistent with their previous psilocybin research, a
significant relationship was found between decreased
PCC a (and d) power and ego dissolution. An especially
strong relationship was found between parahippocampus
and RSC/PCC decoupling and ego dissolution. Taken
together with their earlier studies (Carhart-Harris et al.
(2011; 2012)), it appears that psychedelics destabilize and
disintegrate normally well established brain networks
and reduce the degree of segregation between them.
The mechanisms of long-term effects of one or several
psychedelic experiences are even less well understood.
The initial agonist action on serotonin receptors does not
explain the long-term effects seen 14 months after these
experiences with “positive changes in attitudes, mood,
life satisfaction, behavior, and altruism/social effects”
(Griffiths et al., 2011). After this “sense of self,” reassembles
at the end of the psilocybin experience, there appears to
be a chance of abandoning habits and repetitive
thoughts that no longer serve a useful purpose for the
person. One open study found that long-term positive
effects may persist for decades (Doblin, 1991) and it
seems possible that long-term adaptation through
changes in gene expression also may occur that can be
therapeutic (e.g., see Nichols and Sanders-Bush, 2002).
XII. Conclusion and Outlook
Dr. Albert Hofmann, the natural products chemist
who accidently discovered the effects of LSD in 1943
while working at the Sandoz Laboratories in Basel,
Switzerland, wrote an autobiographical account of his
discovery titled LSD: My Problem Child (Hofmann,
1979b). In his book, Hofmann talks about the potential
of LSD, which he had hoped would be a promising new
tool for psychiatry, but also expresses dismay at the
social turbulence that ensued when “LSD was swept up
in the huge wave of an inebriant mania that began to
spread over the Western world, above all the United
States…” (Hofmann, 1979b). Hofmann died in 2008 at
the age of 102 years; but in his later years, he was
delighted to see that real science had begun to take a
thorough approach to unraveling the psychopharmaco-
logical mysteries of LSD, which he had always believed
would eventually prove to be a miracle drug for
psychiatry.
With that in mind, if the positive therapeutic effects of
psychedelics continue to be validated by additional well
designed clinical studies, it opens up a whole new
dimension of medical research. If psilocybin or LSD
can acutely abolish depression or anxiety after one or
only a few treatments, the question must be asked,
“How does that occur?” There are many who believe that
such improvement must be related to neurochemical
effects, or neuroadaptation, and refuse to believe that
the mystical experience may be relevant. Yet both
modern and older studies consistently find that those
who experience the most profound mystical experiences
invariably receive the greatest symptom improvement.
Of course, as reductionists, it is understood that the
mystical experience must have neurochemical corre-
lates. Even so, understanding what they are, how and
why they occur, and how they lead to therapeutic
improvement should shed light on the underlying
deficits in brain function that lead to these disorders
in the first place. Before-and-after brain imaging stud-
ies of patients with depression, anxiety, or addictive
disorders will show how brain connectivity has changed
as a result of psychedelic treatment. To understand
these disorders at the present time with standard state-
of-the-art approaches involves a sort of “fishing expedi-
tion,” searching for biomarkers that might be clues to
the basis of the underlying disorder. Genome-wide
association studies plow through many thousands or
hundreds of thousands of genes, searching for candi-
dates that might be the underlying causes of affective
disorders. One generally cannot do prospective studies,
to compare the brain function of the normal patient
prior to the onset of his or her disease, and then examine
it again after therapeutic improvement. Rather, one
begins with a patient who is already sick, and then if
therapeutic improvement occurs, usually over a long
period of time, one tries to understand how it happened.
By contrast, some of the recent treatments of anxiety
and depression with psilocybin or LSD are so dramatic,
and happen so quickly, that there must be some overt
measureable changes in brain function or connectivity
344
Nichols
 that correlate with therapeutic improvement. Learning
what these are is the next big challenge, a process that
promises to completely revolutionize the way we ap-
proach discovering better treatments for a host of
human psychiatric disorders.
Considering the most recent scientific and clinical
developments in understanding the actions of psyche-
delics, a statement made in 1980 by Dr. Stanislav Grof
seems particularly relevant today: “It does not seem to
be an exaggeration to say that psychedelics, used
responsibly and with proper caution, would be for
psychiatry what the microscope is for biology and
medicine or the telescope is for astronomy. These tools
make it possible to study important processes that
under normal circumstances are not available for direct
observation” (Grof, 1980).
