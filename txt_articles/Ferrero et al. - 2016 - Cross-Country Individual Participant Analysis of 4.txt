Abstract
Background
Preterm birth is the most common single cause of perinatal and infant mortality, affecting 15
million infants worldwide each year with global rates increasing. Understanding of risk fac-
tors remains poor, and preventive interventions have only limited benefit. Large differences
exist in preterm birth rates across high income countries. We hypothesized that understand-
ing the basis for these wide variations could lead to interventions that reduce preterm birth
incidence in countries with high rates. We thus sought to assess the contributions of known
risk factors for both spontaneous and provider-initiated pretermbirth in selected high
income countries, estimating also the potential impact of successful interventions due to
advances in research, policy and public health, or clinical practice.

 Methods
We analyzed individual patient-level data on 4.1 million singleton pregnancies from four
countries with very high human development index (Czech Republic, New Zealand, Slove-
nia, Sweden) and one comparator U.S. state (California) to determinethe specific contribu-
tion (adjusting for confounding effects) of 21 factors. Both individual and population-
attributable pretermbirth risks were determined,as were contributors to cross-country dif-
ferences. We also assessed the ability to predict preterm birth given various sets of known
risk factors.
Findings
Previous pretermbirthand preeclampsia were the strongest individual risk factors of preterm
birthin all datasets, with odds ratios of 4.6–6.0 and 2.8–5.7, respectively, for individual
women having those characteristics. In contrast, on a population basis, nulliparity and male
sex were the two risk factors with the highest impact on pretermbirthrates, accounting for
25–50% and 11–16% of excess population attributable risk, respectively (p<0.001). The
importanceof nulliparity and male sex on population attributable risk was driven by high prev-
alence despite low odds ratios for individual women. More than 65% of the total aggregated
risk of pretermbirthwithin each country lacks a plausible biologic explanation, and 63% of
difference between countries cannot be explained with known factors; thus, research is nec-
essary to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of pretermbirthand, hence, therapeutic inter-
vention. Surprisingly, variation in prevalence of known risk factors accounted for less than
35% of the difference in pretermbirthrates between countries. Known risk factors had an
area under the curve of less than 0.7 in ROC analysis of pretermbirthprediction within coun-
tries. These data suggest that other influences, as yet unidentified, are involved in preterm
birth.Furtherresearch into biological mechanisms is warranted.
Conclusions
We have quantified the causes of variation in preterm birth rates among countries with very
high human development index. The paucity of explicit and currently identified factors
amenable to intervention illustrates the limited impact of changes possible through current
clinical practice and policy interventions. Our research highlights the urgent need for
research into underlying biological causes of pretermbirth,which alone are likely to lead to
innovative and efficacious interventions.
Introduction
Preterm birth (birth occurringbefore 37 weeks of gestation) is an enormous global public health
challenge, with 15 million infants born preterm every year and an estimated 35% of deaths in
the first 4 weeks of life directly attributable to prematurity [1, 2]. In 2013, preterm birth compli-
cations were the leading cause of death of the estimated 6.3 million liveborn children worldwide
who died before age 5 years (15.4%), followed by pneumonia (14.9%) and intrapartum-related
complications (10.5%) [3]. Preterm birth also exacts a substantial toll on morbidity and on the
health economy–as preterm birth costs the U.S. health system at least $26B yearly [4].

our adherenceto PLOS ONE policies on sharing data
and materials.
 The World Health Organization (WHO) "Born Too Soon" report (1) concluded that a 50%
reduction of preterm birth specific mortality in resource-poor countries is achievable by 2025.
On the other hand, the prevention opportunity is weak based on current proven interventions.
Assuming even optimum coverage and historical-level reductions of best-in-class countries, a
miniscule 5% rate reduction in preterm birth is possible in 39 countries with very high human
development index (VHHDI). This is a shockingly small absolute reduction opportunity
(0.5%; from 9.6% to 9.1%) given the substantial disease burden of preterm birth [5].
Risk factors known to be associated with preterm birth include multiple medical, genetic,
environmental and socioeconomicfactors, not always considered in combination [6–8]. Previ-
ously observedrisk factors include certain maternal or fetal conditions (e.g. preeclampsia, mal-
formations), previous preterm delivery, multifetal gestation, young or advanced maternal age,
assisted reproductive technology (ART) (especially with multifetal gestation), infection, cervi-
cal anomalies, certain ethnicities, smoking, extremes of body-mass index (BMI), low socio-eco-
nomic status and especially early (and often unnecessary)elective delivery due to errors in
gestational age dating and other reasons. Other less well-validated risk factors include stress,
excessive physical work, sexual activity, alcohol consumption and periodontal disease. Despite
much accumulated knowledge on individual etiologicalfactors, the interactions among risk
factors and the pathophysiology of preterm birth remain unclear [6].
Important differences in preterm birth rates exist across countries. Among countries with
VHHDI, preterm birth rates vary widely, in 2010 from 5.3 per 100 live births in Latvia to 14.7
per 100 live births in Cyprus [5]. Causes behind these wide variations in preterm birth rates are
largely unknown. Understanding the causes of this variation has the potential to guide identifi-
cation and use of impactful interventions.
The purpose of our study was to perform the most robust cross-country analysis of preterm
birth etiology undertaken to date, utilizing individual patient-level pregnancy and birth data
from select countries with VHHDI to 1) assess the relative contributions of known risk factors
of preterm birth to individual preterm birth risk, 2) assess the impact of each factor on popula-
tion preterm birth rates (taking into account relative risk and prevalence of the risk factor), 3)
estimate the potential impact of three key intervention areas (i.e., research, policy and public
health, clinical practice) and 4) explain variability of preterm birth rates across selected coun-
tries with VHHDI. A secondarypurpose was to perform a systematic review of multivariate
studies of preterm birth risk factors in order to situate our analysis.
Methods
We conducted five distinct and interrelated analyses as part of this effort. See Fig 1 for an over-
view of our analytic approach.
Literature search of previously published multivariate analyses of
pretermbirth
We performed a literature search of multivariate studies of preterm birth risk factors published
since 1985 using the combination of key words "premature", "preterm" and "risk", in Web of
Science (Thomson Reuters) and MEDLINE (United States National Library of Medicine). This
search yielded ~11,500 search results, following which we excluded studies that considered
fewer than 6 non-clinical maternal or fetal risk factors as covariates (e.g., maternal age, educa-
tion, poverty). We included all risk factors considered by at least 3 studies. Where categorical
variables were reported, we reported the category having the largest significant odds ratio (e.g.
BMI > 30 for the category of maternal weight).

 Individual patient risk vs. population pretermbirthrate
We use two terms throughout this study to describethe contribution of preterm birth risk factors.
1) Individual patient risk refers to the increased likelihoodof giving birth preterm for an individ-
ual woman with the risk factor. 2) Population attributable risk refers to the contribution of that
risk factor to the overall population preterm birth rate, and is a function of both the increase in
risk when the risk factor is present and the prevalence of the risk factor in that population. Indi-
vidual patient risk is relevant to an individual patient as well as to obstetricians and midwives
seeking to understand and estimate a given patient's risk and determine appropriate clinical care
given the presence of a set of risk factors. Population preterm birth rate by contrast is relevant to
policymakersand public health clinicians seeking to reduce the overall preterm birth rate.
Individual patient-level data sources
Based on published literature, internet searches and prior knowledge of the authors, we identi-
fied a convenient sample of international individual patient-level data sources with at least 5
years of pregnancy outcome data, encompassing at least 10 clinical and non-clinical variables.
Based on data robustness (i.e., datasets previously described)and access provisions (i.e., being

 able to access the data within 4 months of request), we included individual patient-level data-
sets from four countries (Czech Republic, New Zealand, Slovenia, Sweden).
Data sources were as follows: Czech Republic, the National Registryof Reproduction Health—
Mothers at Childbirth and Newborns (http://www.uzis.cz/en); New Zealand, the National Mater-
nity Collectionmaintained by the New Zealand Ministry of Health (www.health.govt.nz/); Slove-
nia, the Slovenian National Perinatal Information System maintained by the Slovenian National
Institute of Public Health (http://www.nijz.si/); Sweden, the Swedish Medical Birth Register main-
tained by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (www.socialstyrelsen.se) and com-
plemented by linked data from Statistics Sweden (www.scb.se). All these data sources have been
previously described[9–13].
As a comparator, we also included data from one state in the USA (California) using the vital
statistics linked birth/death file from the California Department of Health Services(https://www.

aspx) as previously described[14]. For all datasets ethics approval and access permissions were
obtained where required (see S1 Appendix for more details).
Definitions and preparation of the five individual patient-level datasets
Preterm birth and very preterm birth were defined as either spontaneous or provider-initiated
deliveries occurringbefore 37 and 32 weeks of gestation, respectively. We classified preterm
births into two general subtypes in order to explore how the effect of risk factors differs across
these types: (1) spontaneous preterm birth (preterm labor or preterm prelabor rupture of fetal
membranes before 37 weeks of gestation), and (2) provider-initiated preterm birth before 37
weeks of gestation, whether medically indicated or not [7, 15]. Gestational age was estimated
using ultrasonography or in some cases menstrual history (see S1 Appendix for details for each
dataset). We excluded stillbirths and multiple gestations from the analysis. Selection of preterm
birth risk factors to be considered in the analysis was performed by a committee of 11 scientific
experts (co-authors), based on their knowledge of existing risk factors as mentioned in the liter-
ature and the availability of data. Definitions of risk factors are provided in the S1 Appendix;
any registry entry with missing or outlier data was excluded from the analysis (see S1 Appendix
for exclusion criteria).
We further classified risk factors into 3 broad intervention areas which we termed, 1)
research, 2) policy and public health, and 3) clinical practice. We did this for heuristic purposes,
and made these distinctions based on our working group's expertise,as we were unable to find
literature on any other group that had attempted to do this. The intervention area "research"
comprises risk factors for which current biological or etiologicalunderstanding is insufficient to
prevent preterm birth utilizing currently available clinical practice and/ or policy. Thus, more
research is needed, specificallylikely to involve cell biology or molecular underpinning responsi-
ble for association lacking an ostensible plausible explanation. "Policy and public health" inter-
ventions arises from risk factors whose prevalence could be impacted by policy and /or public
health interventions and only to a limited extent by the actions of individual practitioners. "Clin-
ical practice" interventions involve addressing risk factors whose prevalence could be directly
impacted by clinicians adjusting their practice (e.g., elective preterm delivery). Some risk factors
(e.g., diabetes mellitus and chronic hypertension) are relevant to both "policy and public health"
and "clinical practice" and were thus considered into both categories.
Regression models
In order to determine the independent contribution (i.e. after accounting for the impact of
other factors) of each risk factor to an individual's risk for preterm birth, we created a model

 for each country including all risk factors. For analyses on the individual patient-level datasets
(Figs 2 and 5 and Figs A, B, C of S1 Appendix), data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0 (IBM
Corp.). We used logistic regression analysis to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) for each subtype of preterm birth. Full models were used that contained all
appreciated preterm birth risk factors, with no stepwise regression. Sensitivity and specificity
of logistic models were calculated as measures of the predictive capability of the models, i.e.,
the ability of the model to "predict" preterm birth [16]. Receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curves and area under curve (AUC) were also obtained to further assess predictive
capability. Statistical significance of independent variables was defined as p < 0.05. The risk
factor calculated p values for each logistic regression model are provided in S1 Appendix.
Stratification analysis of spontaneous and provider-initiated preterm births was performed on

the reportedodds ratios and 1; positive/negative bars are associated with increased or decreased risks of pretermbirthrespectively. Where
categorical variables were reported,we reportedthe categoryhaving the largest significant odds ratio. We included all risk factors considered by at
least 3 studies. Reference categories are the following: non-Hispanic white (ethnicity) (all studies, except Dekker '12 (non-Caucasian)); prenatal care
beginning before 13 (Berkowitz '09) or 14 (Rodrigues'07) completed weeks of gestation, prenatal care received during first trimester (Lang '96),
"adequate" (Hillemeier '07), received (Kristka '07), or not received (Zhang '12); high education (all, except Lang '96, Rodrigues '07), high-school
graduate (Lang '96), 4–8 years of school education (Rodrigues '07); age > 20 (Kistka '07), age 20–29 (Berkowitz '09, Chiavarini '12), age 25–29

 three datasets where these data were available (New Zealand, Slovenia, and Sweden) (Figs A,
B of S1 Appendix).
Analysis of patient subpopulations with greatest risk of developing
pretermbirths
To determine subpopulations with the greatest risk of developing preterm birth, we combined
all four of the whole country datasets (Czech Republic, New Zealand, Slovenia, and Sweden)
and the California state dataset to generate a total database of ~ 4.1 million singleton pregnan-
cies. We then analyzed risk factors common to all five datasets. The risk factors were combined
to define subpopulations each with a unique combination of preterm birth risk factors. Sub-
populations with prevalence below 1 in 10,000 were excluded.
Estimation of the impact of risk factors on singleton pretermbirth rates
As reflected in Fig 5, we determined the absolute impact of each risk factor on preterm birth
rates using the following equations to estimate the impact of each risk factor:
ProbðPTBj RFÞ ffi ProbðRFÞ � AMEðRFÞ
Where Prob(PTB|RF) is the probability of preterm birth given the risk factor RF, Prob(RF) is
the prevalence of the risk factor RF, and AME(RF) is the average marginal effect of the risk fac-
tor RF. The latter is defined as
AMEðRFÞ � EðY1 � Y0Þ
where E() indicates the expectation, Y1 is the outcome that would be obtained if a subject had
the risk factor, and Y0 is the outcome that would be obtained if a subject had the risk factor [17,
18]. The prevalence was calculated from each dataset, and the average marginal effect was cal-
culated using Stata 14.0 (StataCorp). The data in Fig 5 are displayed as "waterfall charts".
Estimation of risk factor contributions to differences in overall preterm
birth rates across countries
We illustrate in Fig 6 our estimated impact of each risk factor or clinical practice following
methodologyand assumptions describedin detail in S1 Appendix. The majority of risk factors
used previously (see Fig 3) were included in this comparison, as well as additional contributors
including multiple pregnancy and preventive interventions (cervicalcerclage, progesterone)
not previously assessed. For some countries, we were unable to identify the prevalence of some
risk factors which obviated our ability to estimate their contributions (marked as N/A in Fig 6).
Briefly, for education, baby sex, access to maternity care, smoking, age, marital status, nullipar-
ity, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, preeclampsia, and ART, we used a formula analogous to that
applied in Fig 5 using the average AME calculated across the set of four countries and preva-
lence information from multiple sources (see S1 Appendix). For multifetal gestations, we
summed the contributions of twins and triplets which were estimated by multiplying country-
specific prevalence by the average preterm birth rates of twins and triplets both calculated from
the set of four countries. For prior preterm birth and prior cesarean section, we estimated the
prevalence of each risk factor using rates in Sweden, relative differences in preterm birth and
parity, and average AMEs calculated across the set of four countries (see S1 Appendix for more
details). For cervicalcerclage and progesterone use, we used estimation methodologiesand
assumptions similar to those used in a previous study [5]. Data are presented in waterfall charts
(as in Fig 6).

 Results
Choosing Risk Factors
Systematic review of multivariate studies on preterm birth risk factors identified a total of 18
studies that considered a minimum of 6 non-clinical maternal or fetal risk factors as covariates
(Fig 2 and "Research in context" panel) [19–36]. These studies, ranging from approximately
3000 up to 711,000 participants, were conducted in various geographies, including North
America (Canada, USA), Europe (Denmark, Finland, Italy, Portugal, Sweden), Oceania (Aus-
tralia, New Zealand), and Asia (China), on hospital populations, registry data, and surveys.
Most studies (11/18, 61%) were conducted within populations smaller than 15,000. Because
data were generated in disparate locations and not subjected to a common template, the risk
factors analyzed in each study were understandably variable both in number and types of risk
factors collected. Very few studies (4/18, 22%) included more than 20 risk factors. For the 18
identified risk factors that were interrogated in at least 3 studies, reported odds ratios varied
across studies up to 9-fold (Fig 2). At pregnancy inception the four factors most consistently
associated with significantly increased risk of preterm birth were prior preterm birth, advanced
maternal age, pregestational diabetes mellitus, and chronic hypertension. Inconsistent associa-
tion (i.e. <50–75% of studies where studied) was observedwith other factors including BMI,
prenatal care, education, and poverty.
Contribution of each risk factor to individual pretermbirth risk
The contributions of each risk factor (or combination thereof)to individual preterm birth risk
was estimated using logistic regression analysis of the large individual patient-level datasets
from four countries (Czech Republic, New Zealand, Slovenia, Sweden), and compared these
results to one heavily populated state from the United States with robust pregnancy data (Cali-
fornia) (Fig 3). After exclusion of entries with outliers and/ or missing values, the total numbers
of live singleton births and timeframes were: Czech Republic, 1,303K/2000-2013; New Zealand,
247K/2008-2012; Slovenia, 175K/2002-2012; Sweden, 1,086K/1998-2012; California, 1,339K/
2008-2010. Overall, 21 risk factors for preterm birth were assessed in this cross-country analy-
sis of 4.1 million live singleton births.
Odds ratios for each risk factor (Fig 3) were remarkably consistent across countries: 70%
(17/24) of the odds ratios calculated over multiple geographies had maximum variation of less
than 50%, whereas 87% (21/24) showed less than 100%. The two individual risk factors which
were associated with the highest risk of preterm birth were prior preterm birth and preeclamp-
sia (odds ratios 4.6–6.0 and 2.8–5.7 respectively). Other risk factors with association (odds
ratios 1.2–3.6) with preterm birth include chronic diseases (pre-gestational diabetes and
chronic hypertension), advanced maternal age (age > 40), ART, tobacco smoking, and illicit
drug use; the p-values for all of these associations were <0.05. The effect of ethnicity could be
studied in only two geographies where data were available. Significant effects were observedin
the California dataset for several ethnic populations, most notably for Non-Hispanic Blacks
(odds ratio 1.6). In contrast, ethnicity effects were small or nonexistent in New Zealand. Low
BMI was associated with higher risk of preterm birth (odds ratios 1.3–1.4) whereas the effects
of overweight or mild obesity (class I) were small, insignificant or inconsistent. With the excep-
tion of the lowest education level which was consistently associated with higher risk of preterm
birth (odds ratios 1.2–1.4), other socioeconomicfactors had little or no impact on preterm

 birth (odds ratios < 1.3). Consistent but small associations were observedfor other risk factors
including previous cesarean section, lack of prenatal care visit before 20 weeks (except Czech
Republic), and male sex (odds ratio < 1.3). Despite relatively low odds ratios for nulliparity
(1.4–2.1 in the four countries) or male sex (1.2 in 3 of the 4 countries), the high prevalence for
these risk factors generated statistical significance for population attributable risks.
Individual risk factors for spontaneous vs. provider-initiatedpretermbirth
In our stratification analysis, prior preterm birth remained by far the strongest risk factors for
both provider-initiated and spontaneous preterm birth (odds ratios 4.5–7.1, Figs A, B of S1
Appendix). For provider-initiated preterm birth, major clinical risk factors (e.g., preeclampsia,
chronic hypertension) ranked at the top (odds ratios 2.3–5.2) and other risk factors had much
smaller or inconsistent contributions. For spontaneous preterm birth, chronic (pre-gestational)
diabetes was very strongly associated with preterm birth (odds ratios 3.3–4.6). Nulliparity and
prior cesarean birth were important risk factors for spontaneous (odds ratios 1.4–2.4) but not
provider-initiated (odds ratios 0.5–1.6) preterm birth. The impact of other risk factors includ-
ing ART, maternal age, and male sex, was consistently greater for spontaneous versus pro-
vider-initiated preterm birth. In the Swedish dataset, high BMI was a significant risk factor for
spontaneous preterm birth (odds ratios 1.2–1.4) but was small or insignificant for provider-ini-
tiated preterm birth (odds ratios 0.9–1.0). In the Slovenian dataset, high BMI was insignificant
for spontaneous preterm birth but protective for provider-initiated preterm birth (odds ratios
0.6–0.7).
Individual risk factors for pretermbirthvs. very pretermbirth
The same risk factors were drivers for both preterm birth and very preterm birth (Fig C of S1
Appendix) although the magnitude of several risk factors (e.g., ethnicity, lower education,
advanced age, and ART) was greater for very preterm birth. High BMI (obesity classes II-III)
was strongly associated with very preterm birth in both the Swedish and California contexts
(odds ratio 1.5–1.7) but not in the Slovenian context (odds ratio 0.8).
Predictive performance of models
The predictive performance of all risk factors combined in logistic models was only modest.
For example, Fig D of S1 Appendix shows the ROC curve for the Swedish analysis (see Fig 3)
with an area under the curve of 0.662 and a sensitivity of 27% based on 90% specificity. Similar
performance was achieved with the other datasets. Other predictive models were tested, includ-
ing Decision Tree and Naive-Bayes classifiers, but did not show better predictive capabilities
(data not shown).
Because predicting preterm birth is unsatisfactory using available data and tools, we lever-
aged the size and breadth of our datasets and analyzed patient subpopulations having the great-
est risk to develop preterm birth. Strikingly, even for the 10 subpopulations with the strongest
combinations of risk factors of preterm birth, the likelihood of a delivery at term was greater
than 50% (Fig 4; additional subpopulations in Fig E of S1 Appendix).
Impact on population risk for pretermbirth
To estimate the contribution of individual risk factors for preterm birth on overall population
preterm birth rates, we developed a model that combined odds ratios and prevalence of each
risk factor (Fig 5). Risk factors were further classified into 3 broad intervention areas of
research, policy / public health, and clinical practice (see methods). With this model, research

 constitute the most potentially impactful arena of intervention with the greatest estimated con-
tribution to preterm birth (59–74%), followed by implementation of policy and public health
actions (14–39%), and the least potential for impact with altered clinical practice (2–12%).
Identifying the etiology of increased preterm birth risk associated with nulliparity and male sex
within the research arena and eliminating this risk would contribute the most to the overall
population preterm birth rates given the high prevalences of these risk factors (see Fig 3).
Although preeclampsia is second only to prior preterm birth as an individual risk factor, it is
significantly less impactful at the population level due to its relatively low prevalence (5–7%).
Education, smoking, and maternal age constitute the main contributors to preterm birth

 amenable to policy and public health intervention. The baseline rates for lowest-risk popula-
tions (which were calculated from the intercepts of the logistic regression models) appear con-
sistent across countries, ranging from 2.1% in Sweden to 3.2% in Slovenia. This rate reflects the
risk for a pregnancy in which the mother is multiparous, has a female baby, has had no prior
preterm birth, does not develop preeclampsia, is from the highest education group, andis char-
acterized by lowest-risk categories.
Explaining pretermbirth variation across countries
We sought to estimate the relative contributions of identified risk factors to differences in pre-
term birth rate observedbetween Sweden (the country with the lowest preterm birth rate in
our data set) and 15 other VHHDI countries (see S1 Appendix for data sources).
The net contribution of the known set of preterm birth risk factors evaluated in this study is
insufficient to explain the overall differences in preterm birth rates observedamong other
countries with VHHDI and Sweden (Fig 6 and Fig F of S1 Appendix). On average, all factors
combined can explain only 37% of the difference across countries. For each country, the mag-
nitude of the unexplained difference appears to be highly correlated (R2 = 0.96) to the overall
difference in preterm birth rate between that country and Sweden, ranging from 0.1% (Japan)
to 6.2% (Bahrain). Among all risk factors considered, preeclampsia, low education, multifetal
gestation, previous preterm birth, and smoking are the main risk factors accounting for
explainable differences among countries.
Discussion
The unprecedented individual patient-level dataset (~5x larger than any used previously, and
the first that is cross-country) and newly applied analytic approaches allowed us to make sev-
eral intriguing advances with this study. First, we robustly confirmed prior preterm birth and
preeclampsia as the top individual risk factors. We also robustly clarified the magnitude of
impact of other risk factors, confirming some prior findings while not confirming others. Sec-
ond, we identified nulliparity and male baby sex as the top contributors to the population pre-
term rate, and we found that unknown factors requiring further research to act upon account
for ~2/3 of the preterm birth rate. Third, we found that the contribution of risk factors to pre-
term birth burden is remarkably similar across countries–both in terms of individual risk as
well as population preterm rate. Fourth, we found that we are unable to account for ~2/3 of the
difference in preterm birth rates between Sweden and 15 other countries with VHHDI. In addi-
tion to these intriguing advances, even though robust preterm birth prediction remains elusive,
our analysis allows an improved capability to robustly assess preterm birth risk for an individ-
ual pregnant patient with a given set of risk factors.
We not surprisingly found previous preterm birth to be the strongest individual risk factor
for both spontaneous and provider-initiated preterm birth (Figs A, B of S1 Appendix), consis-
tent with a large body of prior published evidence and the known 25–30% heritability of pre-
term birth [19, 23, 24, 32, 37]. This risk factor likely reflects persistent genetic and epigenetic
components, supplemented perhaps by an interaction with deleterious environmental risk fac-
tors which could not be captured by traditional variables either in our model or in other
studies.

 Preeclampsia was also confirmed as one of the top individual preterm birth risk factors, sec-
ond only to prior preterm birth. Our study is novel, however, in that few other multivariate
studies had been able to assess the variable of preeclampsia while controlling for other related
confounding factors such as chronic hypertension.
Our strategy identified two risk factors with relatively low odds ratios but high prevalence,
potentially exerting a strong if yet unexplained impact on population preterm birth rates due
to their high prevalence. Nulliparity (prevalence 40–50%, odds ratios 1.2–2.1) appears to have
the greatest single impact on population preterm birth rates across all risk factors considered,
accounting for up to 28% of the total rate in Sweden. This impact is incremental to that driven
by higher incidence of preeclampsia in nulliparous pregnancies, and could in part be due to the
same unknown factors responsible for risk associated with recurrent preterm birth. Male sex
has been previously identified as a risk factor for preterm birth [38]. Similar to nulliparity, we
find in our very large sample that male sex (prevalence 51%, odds ratio 1.2 in 3 of 4 countries
and California) contributes significantly to the population preterm birth rates (up to 8% in
New Zealand) despite relatively small odds ratios. Based on our models, nulliparity accounts
for 13–28% and male sex accounts for 6–8% of the population preterm birth rates within the
four countries and the 2.8 million singleton births that were analyzed. Yet the biological expla-
nation for these two risk factors remains unclear, and likewise the fashion in which this infor-
mation could be used to reduce preterm birth is unclear.
Other significant risk factors, albeit with lower odds ratios (1.3–3.6, for all preterm births)
confirmed through this analysis include chronic hypertension, pregestational diabetes mellitus,
older maternal age, and ART, all holding for both spontaneous and provider-initiated preterm
birth. Previous cesarean section is associated in our analysis with an increased risk of spontane-
ous preterm birth (odds ratios 1.4–1.9) but appears protective for provider-initiated preterm
birth (odds ratios 0.5–0.9). This most likely reflects risks of early birth related to need for repeat
cesarean delivery.
We confirmed robustly several other risk factors whose effects were not always consistent in
every study using much smaller data sets or lacking multivariate analysis. Being underweight
(BMI < 18.5 kg/m2) is a significant risk factor for both spontaneous and provider-initiated pre-
term birth (OR 1.3–1.4, p<0.01), whereas being overweight (BMI 25.0–29.9 kg/m2) or slightly
obese (class I, BMI 30.0–34.9 kg/m2) are not (OR 0.9–1.1). Interestingly, being very obese
(class II-III, BMI > 35 kg/m2) is a risk factor of preterm birth in Sweden and in California
(odds ratios 1.1–1.3, p<0.001), as has been recently reported, but not in Slovenia [39]. This
effect is greatly amplified for very preterm birth in both geographies (odds ratios 1.5–1.7). Also
of great interest is our finding that being overweight or obese (class II-III) does not increase the
risk of provider-initiated preterm birth (odds ratio 0.6–1.0), a finding that contradicts one
recent report but confirms another [40, 41]. Our results likely are due to the benefit of our
larger set of confounding factors that were available for adjustment. For example, variable and
sometimes modest effects have been reported for tobacco smoking in prior studies (e.g. [19,
23]; however, we found a very robust effect across all five datasets considered (OR 1.3–1.6,
p<0.001). Conflictingresults have been reported on the impact of socioeconomicstatus on
preterm birth (e.g. [24, 26]). Our analysis indicates a higher likelihood of preterm birth for
patients having low education (high-school or less, odds ratios 1.2–1.4, p<0.001), an effect
magnified for very preterm birth (odds ratios 1.3–1.8).
As expected, our results from the comparator U.S. state of California indicate an increased
risk for preterm birth among Non-Hispanic Blacks (odds ratio 1.6). Inasmuch as we had eth-
nicity data only from New Zealand among the other countries analyzed, we are unable to fully
explore the relationship of ethnicity to preterm birth that was evident in the California data.
Since New Zealand’s patient population is fairly homogeneous compared to California’s very
Cross-Country Individual Patient-Level Analysis

 heterogenous population, we did not expect to find a relationship with ethnicity in that country
nor might we in the relatively homogenous populations of Sweden, Slovenia or the Czech
Republic. We also lacked sufficient information in the datasets to explore any possible associa-
tion between migration and preterm birth.
Several investigators have recently addressed how differences in risk factor prevalence could
explain variations in preterm birth rates across countries. A recent review summarized differ-
ences in preterm birth risk factors, reproductive health policy and medical practice, and mea-
surement issues across European countries [42]. Zeitlin et al. [43] showed that a set of 7 key
socio-demographicrisk factors and differences in obstetric intervention are insufficient to
explain the elevated preterm birth rate in the United States compared to France. A similar com-
parison of data from Canada and the United States reached the same conclusion [44]. Yet
despite the inclusion of a larger set of risk factors associated with preterm birth, we were still
able to explain only 37% of the differences in preterm birth rates among the 15 VHHDI coun-
tries considered and Sweden, the country having the lowest preterm birth rate (5.5%). Differ-
ences ranged from 13% in Singapore to 66% in France. Altogether the conclusions from our
study confirm the paucity of factors which are amenable to provider-initiated intervention(s),
as shown by Chang et al. [5].
Although we used very large validated datasets and multiple independent predictors, we
were only able to achieve modest levels of combined specificity and sensitivity for the predic-
tion of preterm birth (see Fig D of S1 Appendix). Two non-mutually exclusive reasons might
explain these difficulties.First, there are doubtless additional key predictors not recognized or
considered in our models such as regulatory genes, recent migration, and fetal growth indica-
tors. Second, it would appear that birth at term could be a very robust process as shown by our
subpopulation analysis (see Fig 4). Even pregnant women with the strongest combination of
risk factors are still more likely to experience a birth at term than a preterm birth.
While we are unable to definitively predict preterm birth, our analysis does allow us robustly
to estimate the risk of preterm birth across different subpopulations. For example, a woman
with no risk factors (i.e. no prior preterm birth, no preeclampsia, multiparous, female baby,
etc.) would have a preterm birth risk of <4%, and a woman with a prior preterm birth, pre-
eclampsia, and prior c-section would have a 48% chance of a preterm birth. A further activity
for this working group is to disseminate widely this capability to providers and potentially to
patients. Although we do not yet know if this capability can be beneficialfor clinical practice,
certainly predictive capacity should be helpful as effective interventions become validated.
Our study is the first multi-country analysis to interrogate the impact of individual preterm
birth risk factors within and across countries with VHHDI. High grade individual patient-level
data from approximately 4.1 million singleton pregnancies were made available for analysis,
including 2.8 million from 4 countries (New Zealand, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Sweden) and
1.3 million from a large comparator U.S. state (California). We were able to assess in various
combinations the association of 21 individual risk factors with preterm birth, adjusting for
multiple confounding effects. This unique dataset also enabled us to perform a first-of-its-kind
analysis in preterm birth. We were able to look beyond simply individual risk to explore rela-
tive contributions of risk factors to population preterm birth rates.
The present investigation was limited to countries with VHHDI because of the scarcity of
very high quality validated data collected in rigidly managed, monitored and nationally sup-
ported systems in low-income countries, even though such countries generally have higher
rates of preterm births [2]. We have assumed our datasets are comparable in their measure-
ment of key variables, including gestational age and others, which may not be the case. Addi-
tionally, we limited our analyses to a set of risk factors with available data and for which direct
comparison across datasets was possible. Future studies will probe the association of other risk

 factors to preterm birth, including diet, stress, periodontal disease, and other maternal or fetal
clinical risk factors, while adjusting for other confounding effects. The cross-country analysis
undertaken was also limited to risk factors for which aggregate data were available for all coun-
tries considered. The effect of "unknown" contributors might be overestimated to some extent
in these models.
In conclusion, our results strongly support the need for additional research to elucidate bio-
logical basis of many of the known associations with preterm birth. First, previous preterm
birth is the top risk factor of preterm birth according to our logistic model, but as discussed
above this risk factor is surely a surrogate for genetic, epigenetic and environmental causes not
ostensibly captured among the risk factors for which we controlled. Likely these same causes
are also responsible for the contribution of nulliparity to preterm birth. Second, classification
of the risk factors into intervention areas highlights the importance for more etiologic research
into the 65% of risk factors not susceptible to current policy, public health, or to clinical inter-
vention (e.g. nulliparity, male baby sex). Third, the aggregated contribution of known risk fac-
tors is insufficient to explain differences in preterm birth rates observedbetween Sweden and
15 other countries with VHHDI. Overall, our results suggest that impactful progress in the pre-
vention of preterm birth countries with VHHDI will only be made possible by research into
the biology of human parturition.
