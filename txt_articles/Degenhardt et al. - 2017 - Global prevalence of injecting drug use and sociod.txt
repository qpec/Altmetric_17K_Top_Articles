Summary
Background Sharing of equipment used for injecting drug use (IDU) is a substantial cause of disease burden and a 
contributor to blood-borne virus transmission. We did a global multistage systematic review to identify the prevalence 
of IDU among people aged 15–64 years; sociodemographic characteristics of and risk factors for people who inject 
drugs (PWID); and the prevalence of HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) among PWID.
Methods Consistent with the GATHER and PRISMA guidelines and without language restrictions, we systematically 
searched peer-reviewed databases (MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO; articles published since 2008, latest searches 
in June, 2017), searched the grey literature (websites and databases, searches between April and August, 2016), and 
disseminated data requests to international experts and agencies (requests sent in October, 2016). We searched for 
data on IDU prevalence, characteristics of PWID, including gender, age, and sociodemographic and risk characteristics, 
and the prevalence of HIV, HCV, and HBV among PWID. Eligible data on prevalence of IDU, HIV antibody, HBsAg, 
and HCV antibody among PWID were selected and, where multiple estimates were available, pooled for each country 
via random effects meta-analysis. So too were eligible data on percentage of PWID who were female; younger than 
25 years; recently homeless; ever arrested; ever incarcerated; who had recently engaged in sex work, sexual risk, or 
injecting risk; and whose main drugs injected were opioids or stimulants. We generated regional and global estimates 
in line with previous global reviews.
Findings We reviewed 55 671 papers and reports, and extracted data from 1147 eligible records. Evidence of IDU was 
recorded in 179 of 206 countries or territories, which cover 99% of the population aged 15–64 years, an increase of 
31 countries (mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and the Pacific Islands) since a review in 2008. IDU prevalence estimates 
were identified in 83 countries. We estimate that there are 15∙6 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 10∙2–23∙7 million) 
PWID aged 15–64 years globally, with 3∙2 million (1·6–5·1 million) women and 12∙5 million (7·5–18·4 million) men. 
Gender composition varied by location: women were estimated to comprise 30∙0% (95% UI 28·5–31·5) of PWID in 
North America and 33∙4% (31·0–35·6) in Australasia, compared with 3∙1% (2·1–4·1) in south Asia. Globally, we 
estimate that 17∙8% (10·8–24∙8) of PWID are living with HIV, 52∙3% (42·4–62·1) are HCV-antibody positive, and 
9∙1% (5·1–13·2) are HBV surface antigen positive; there is substantial geographic variation in these levels. Globally, 
we estimate 82·9% (76·6–88·9) of PWID mainly inject opioids and 33∙0% (24∙3–42∙0) mainly inject stimulants. We 
estimate that 27∙9% (20∙9–36∙8) of PWID globally are younger than 25 years, 21∙7% (15∙8–27∙9) had recently (within 
the past year) experienced homelessness or unstable housing, and 57∙9% (50∙5–65∙2) had a history of incarceration.
Interpretation We identified evidence of IDU in more countries than in 2008, with the new countries largely consisting 
of low-income and middle-income countries in Africa. Across all countries, a substantial number of PWID are living 
with HIV and HCV and are exposed to multiple adverse risk environments that increase health harms.

Introduction
Sharing of equipment used for injecting drug use (IDU) 
causes substantial disease burden. Transmission via 
contaminated injection paraphernalia of blood-borne 
viruses, including HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and 
hepatitis B virus (HBV), is a leading contributor to 
morbidity and mortality as a consequence of IDU.1 
Quantification of the size of the population of people who 
inject drugs (PWID), their demographic characteristics, 
and the extent of their exposure to risk behaviours and 
environments is essential to enable effective health policy 
planning.2–5
In 20086 and, for hepatitis, 2011,7 we did systematic 
reviews to estimate the prevalence of IDU globally and

the prevalence of HIV, HCV, and HBV among PWID. 
These reviews generated new evidence, documented an 
increase in the number of countries where IDU had been 
recorded relative to a review 10 years earlier,8 and 
identified gaps and shortcomings in the available data 
(for example, we identified many countries where no 
studies had been done with PWID).
This Article updates these previous estimates. During 
the past decade, surveillance capacity has been enhanced 
in many countries, including Global Fund support for 
studies of and services for PWID across multiple low-
income and middle-income countries. Patterns of drug 
use 
have 
shifted 
globally, 
including 
increasing 
pharmaceutical opioid use and injection in some 
countries and changes in amphetamine and coca 
derivatives in some regions.9 Targets for reductions in 
HIV and viral hepatitis infection have been developed,10,11 
and drug dependence treatment coverage has been listed 
as one of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.12 All 
of these factors make updating of previous estimates 
crucially important.
Experience of homelessness,13 arrest,14 incarceration,15,16 
and sex work17 can increase exposure of PWID to HIV, 
HCV, and HBV, and increase their risks of physical and 
mental health harms. Age,18 gender,19 and the types of 
drugs injected20–22 are associated with blood-borne virus 
risk among PWID, and could require quite different 
treatment and harm reduction responses.
We aimed to update the estimates of the number of 
PWID at country, regional, and global levels. This Article 
also represents the first global review of sociodemographic 
characteristics of and risk factors for PWID. At the 
country, regional, and global level, we examined the 
number of countries with evidence of IDU and estimates 
of the number of PWID; the prevalence of HIV, HBV, and 
HCV among PWID; and the characteristics of PWID and 
patterns of drug use and risk history, including exposure 
to homelessness, arrest, incarceration, and sex work.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
This study was a global, multistage systematic review of 
peer-reviewed and grey literature. The methods used 
were consistent with previous global reviews6,7 and in 
accordance with the PRISMA23 and GATHER24 guide-
lines (appendix pp 3–5). The protocols were regis-
tered on PROSPERO, numbers CRD42016052858 and 
CRD42016052853. Our search strategy had several stages, 
as in previous reviews.6,7 We did not limit the searches 
by language.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
In 2008 and 2011, global systematic reviews were done to 
estimate the prevalence of injecting drug use (IDU) globally, 
as well as the prevalence of HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) among people who inject drugs (PWID). 
These reviews noted an increase in the number of countries 
where IDU had been identified relative to a review from 1998. 
Although annual updates are produced by agencies such as the 
UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the European 
Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), 
these focus on a limited number of countries (EMCDDA), rely 
on member state reporting (UNODC), and do not involve 
systematic reviews of evidence. These estimates do not adhere 
to the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates 
Reporting (GATHER). Studies suggest that experience of 
homelessness, arrest, imprisonment, and sex work can increase 
exposure of PWID to HIV, HCV, and HBV, and increase risks of 
health harm. Age, gender, and the types of drugs injected affect 
exposure to blood-borne virus risk and might require quite 
different treatment and harm reduction responses. To our 
knowledge, there has never been a global review of these issues 
among PWID.
Added value of this study
In the past decade, surveillance capacity has been enhanced 
across many low-income and middle-income countries. 
Targets for reductions in HIV and viral hepatitis due to IDU 
have been developed, and drug dependence treatment 
coverage has been listed as one of the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals, making updates of previous estimates 
crucially important. This Article updates estimates of the 
number of PWID at the country level, regional level, and global 
level by use of a multi-stage systematic review of 
peer-reviewed and grey literature, data reported by 
government and other agencies, and expert consultation. To 
our knowledge, our work represents the first global review of 
sociodemographic characteristics of and risk factors for PWID, 
and we present the first estimates of IDU by gender at the 
country, regional, and global level. We also summarise 
evidence on PWID, including their experience of incarceration, 
sex work, and homelessness.
Implications of all the available evidence
IDU has now been documented in most countries and 
territories in the world, and HIV and HCV infection are prevalent 
in many populations of PWID, representing a substantial 
challenge to public health. There is a clear mandate to invest in 
blood-borne virus prevention activities such as needle and 
syringe programmes and opioid substitution therapy, and to 
provide treatment and care for those who are living with HIV 
and HCV. Importantly, our results highlight the consistently 
high levels of exposure to significant risk factors faced by PWID 
across countries. These risk factors include those about which 
there might be less capacity for individual control, emphasising 
the clear need to address structural and environmental drivers 
of vulnerability, risk, and harm.

We searched electronic peer-reviewed literature 
databases (MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO) using a 
comprehensive set of search terms developed in 
consultation with a specialist drug and alcohol librarian 
(appendix pp 6–10). We limited the searches to studies 
published since Jan 1, 2008, or since Jan 1, 2011 for 
hepatitis (ie, from the year of the previously published 
reviews). We did the searches in April, 2016, and updated 
them in June, 2017
. Any systematic reviews with 
potentially relevant sources that were identified were 
hand-searched for relevant papers or reports.
We searched grey literature and online databases that 
we had identified as sources of papers or reports on 
IDU and blood-borne viruses25 via their own search 
function or Google advanced search between April and 
June, 2016, limiting our search to records published 
since Jan 1, 2008 (or Jan 1, 2011, for hepatitis). These 
sources included the websites of drug surveillance 
systems, regional harm reduction networks, and 
country-specific ministries of health. We updated our 
methods to identify and systematically search grey 
literature for this review25 and the sites searched are 
detailed in the appendix (pp 11–60).
Between April and August, 2016, we searched key 
documents by relevant international agencies, including 
the UN Office on Drugs and Crime’s (UNODC) World 
Drug Reports,9 Harm Reduction International’s Global 
State of Harm Reduction reports,26 and reports from the 
European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug 
Addiction (EMCDDA), WHO, UNAIDS, and Global 
Fund. We updated the searches between May and 
June, 2017
. We contacted members of these organisations 
directly to obtain data when additional information 
was required.
We also sought data via expert requests. We requested 
data on the epidemiology of IDU and blood-borne 
viruses in October, 2016, via an email distribution 
process and social media. This process consisted of 
initial emails sent to more than 2000 key experts and 
organisations, including contacts in the global, regional, 
and country offices of WHO, UNAIDS, Global Fund, 
and UNODC (appendix p 61). Staff in those agencies also 
forwarded the request to their colleagues and other 
relevant contacts. One member of the research team (SL) 
posted a request for data on Twitter, which was delivered 
to 5525 individual feeds (appendix p 62).
Screening and extraction
We created an Endnote (version X.8) library to catalogue 
papers and reports and remove duplicates. References 
were screened by three researchers (LD, SL, and AP), 
assisted by researchers at the National Drug and Alcohol 
Research Centre, University of New South Wales 
(UNSW); the Kirby Institute UNSW; the University of 
Queensland; the University of Bristol; and the Ukrainian 
Institute on Public Health Policy. The research team had 
members proficient in reading sources written in English, 
Panel: Decision rules for data extraction and estimation processes
Overall
• 
Estimates with sample sizes ≤40 PWID were excluded
• 
Samples which represented a subpopulation (eg, prisoners, all HIV positive or HIV 
negative) were excluded, as were those with 15% or more missing data (eg, due to 
incomplete responding or attrition in follow-up)
• 
Where multiple sources were identified with data from the same sample, the sources 
with the most complete data regarding the various indicators of interest were included
• 
Where possible, if calculation or typesetting errors were detected in reported 
estimates, these were recalculated or clarified with authors
Prevalence of injecting drug use
• 
Where multiple estimates were available, higher grade estimates (grading 
classifications are detailed in the appendix p 62) were selected in preference to other 
grades
• 
Geographic coverage was preferred over recency of an estimate—an older national 
estimate was used in preference to a newer estimate that focused only on one city or 
region; this rule recognises that, especially in large countries (eg, India), there can be 
considerable regional variation in IDU prevalence
• 
Estimates of current PWID defined as those who had injected in the past 12 months 
were selected in preference to estimates for PWID defined by other criteria; other 
estimates were included in the absence of the preferred definition; the definition of 
injecting drug use for each estimate is noted in the findings 
• 
When deriving the prevalence of injecting drug use, it was also assumed that PWID 
were aged between 15 and 64 years of age
HIV, hepatitis C, and hepatitis B among PWID
• 
City, subnational, and national estimates (grade A–C) published within the last 4 years 
of the most recently available estimate were pooled where multiple estimates were 
available for a country
• 
For sentinel surveillance, if no details were provided on whether a single or multiple 
sample types were used, it was assumed that only a single sample type was used and 
graded C
• 
Estimates based on case notifications, self-report, or unspecified methodologies were 
excluded
• 
Studies that excluded PWID according to sex (eg, those actively excluding female 
PWID) were not included if mixed gender studies were available
Characteristics of PWID
• 
All eligible data for each country were pooled where multiple estimates were available
• 
Estimates were excluded if the sample inclusion or exclusion criteria reflected the 
characteristic of interest (eg, samples where participation was restricted to male PWID 
were excluded from meta-analyses of the percentage female)
• 
Where categorical data for age were available, we calculated the percentage who were 
young, defined where possible as ≤24 years
• 
In the case of time-varying indicators (eg, injecting risk behaviours), estimates for 
recent timeframes (ie, ≤12 months) were pooled 
• 
A range of risk behaviours could occur around injecting drug use; we chose to extract 
data on receptive needle-syringe sharing (ie, using a needle after someone else)
• 
Similarly, a range of behaviours could confer risk during sexual activity; we focused on 
extracting estimates of unprotected sex (ie, sex without a condom) 
• 
We also extracted data from surveys of PWID who reported what the main drug was that 
they injected; in some instances we could not locate any studies assessing this, but 
surveys in a country reported “last drug injected”; or if not last drug injected, whether they 
had recently injected—in these instances (appendix) we used those estimates
Full details are available in the appendix (pp 67, 68). PWID=people who inject drugs.

English language data sources were read via Google 
Translate or the Microsoft Word translate function.
Initial screening of title and abstract was done 
independently by one reviewer with a random 10% check 
by another (LD, SL, or AP), with no discrepancies found. 
Screened references were selected for full-text review if 
the title or abstract suggested that the document might 
contain relevant information (panel; appendix pp 63–68). 
Full-text review was also independently done by 
two authors (LD, SL, or AP), with discrepancies resolved 
by consensus except for fewer than 30 records, for which a 
third reviewer was consulted (MH; consensus was reached 
in all instances). 67 authors were contacted to request full-
text where that was unavailable (eg, if only an abstract was 
presented) or to provide details of the methods or results.
Data from eligible studies were extracted into a 
purpose-built database in Microsoft Access 2016. We 
extracted data at all levels reported in the study, including 
city, subnational, and country. Data were then checked 
for accuracy against the original source by one of three 
authors (LD, SL, or AP). All extracted data were 
categorised by country: we included all UN Member 
States, as well as countries or territories for which IDU 
has been reported, or where we identified evidence that 
an intervention for PWID was being implemented.27 We 
extracted data on studies estimating the prevalence of 
IDU. From eligible studies of PWID, we extracted data 
on sociodemographic characteristics and risk variables 
(gender, age, unstable housing or homelessness, recent 
incarceration, arrest, and recent involvement in sex 
work), patterns of drug use and risk (recent injecting 
risk, sexual risk, and types of drugs injected), HIV-
antibody prevalence, HCV-antibody prevalence (previous 
exposure) and reports of HCV-RNA prevalence (active 
infection), and HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence 
(active infection).
Data analysis
Our data analysis approach was informed by methods 
used in earlier reviews6,7 (panel; appendix pp 63–68). On 
the basis of the extracted data, we made initial calculations 
of country-level prevalence estimates in accordance with 
a classification system and a set of decision rules (panel; 
appendix pp 63–71). Estimates were generated by one 
member of the research team (SC or LD), and 
independently reviewed by at least two others (LD, AP, JL, 
or SL); any discrepancies were resolved with discussion 
and consultation (SC, LD, AP, SL, JL). External checks 
were made with specific requests to experts in countries 
where additional data or clarification of identified data 
were needed. JG did a third independent check once 
estimates had been selected and pooled. All authors also 
finally reviewed all selected estimates.
Estimates of the prevalence of IDU were graded by 
quality (appendix pp 63, 64), and higher-grade estimates 
were selected over lower-grade estimates; we also aimed 
to maximise geographic coverage of estimates within a 
country. If two or more estimates of the same quality 
grade were identified, these were pooled via random-
effects meta-analysis. The proportions were pooled across 
studies within a given country via random-effects meta-
analyses in Stata version 14 by use of the metaprop 
command. Metaprop allows meta-analyses of proportions 
for binomial data. The CIs were calculated with the exact 
method based on the binomial distribution. If no estimate 
of IDU prevalence was located of the same or higher 
quality since the previous review,6 the estimate from the 
previous review was used again.
Eligible data on the prevalence of HIV antibody, HBsAg, 
and HCV antibody among PWID were selected and, 
where multiple estimates were available, pooled for each 
country (decision rules around selection of estimates are 
shown in the appendix pp 65, 66). On the basis of these 
extracted data, we made initial calculations of country-
level prevalence estimates in accordance with agreed 
decision rules around the selection of estimates, 
approaches to pooling estimates within-country (panel), 
and determination of uncertainty intervals (UIs) around 
estimates. Estimates were pooled via random-effects 
models. To estimate the number of PWID with blood-
borne virus infections (HIV antibody, HBsAg, and HCV 
antibody) among the country population sizes, we 
multiplied IDU prevalence by the proportion of each 
blood-borne virus variable among PWID. We then 
multiplied this product by the size of the country 
population aged 15–64 years to obtain number of PWID 
with blood-borne viruses. 95% UIs were estimated with 
Monte Carlo simulation taking 100 000 draws. We used a 
binomial distribution because our parameters of interest 
were proportions (product of IDU proportion among 
population and blood-borne virus proportion among 
PWID). Estimated sample sizes were derived on the 
basis of the 95% CIs and standard errors of the 
proportion estimates in each country. The simulated UIs 
incorporated the uncertainty of both IDU and blood-
borne virus estimates.
Following the collation of country-specific estimates, 
regional and global IDU, HIV, and viral hepatitis 
estimates were derived. Regional groupings were 
based on those used by UNAIDS, WHO, and UNODC. 
We made region-specific, weighted estimates of the 
prevalence of HIV, HCV, HBV, and IDU using all the 
observed estimates and 95% CIs of estimates in each 
country within that region and deriving a weighted 
estimate and UIs, taking into account country population

size. We used UN Population Division estimates of 
country population size (age 15–64 years).28 We then used 
regional estimates to estimate the global prevalence 
(appendix pp 69, 70).
Although few prevalence estimates of IDU present 
gender-specific estimates, this information is crucial for 
service planning. We estimated the number of women 
(and men) who inject drugs by extracting all available 
data in each country on the percentage of PWID samples 
who were female. We pooled these proportions across 
studies within a given country via random-effects meta-
analyses in Stata version 14 using the metaprop 
command. To estimate the number of female PWID, we 
multiplied the proportion of women among PWID by the 
prevalence of IDU, then by the population size of the 
country. We calculated population-level prevalence of 
IDU for women and men using UN population estimates 
for men and women aged 15–64 years in each country.28
For pooling percentages of PWID across studies with 
data for sociodemographic characteristics and risk factors, 
we pooled all eligible estimates of each characteristic for a 
country via random-effects meta-analyses in Stata 
version 14 using the metaprop command. We calculated 
the CIs using the exact method based on the binomial 
distribution. We report pooled estimates of the percentage 
of PWID who were young (age <25 years at the time of 
interview), had unstable housing or were homeless 
(current or past year), had a lifetime experience of police 
arrest, had a lifetime history of incarceration, and had 
recently engaged in sex work (current or past year among 
all PWID in a sample, not by gender). We also report 
pooled estimates of the percentage of PWID who had 
recently engaged in injecting risk behaviour (pre-
dominantly receptive needle sharing, typically in the past 
month) and pooled estimates of the percentage of PWID 
who recently engaged in sexual risk behaviour (pre-
dominantly no or inconsistent condom use with casual 
partner, typically within the past month). We also 
extracted data on the reported main drug for injection; we 
report the percentage of PWID across countries whose 
main drug for injection was either an opioid (heroin or 
other opioid) or stimulant (amphetamine or cocaine). 
Further details of this process, including definitions and 
decision rules around selection of estimates for inclusion 
in these pooled estimates, are provided in the panel and 
appendix (pp 67, 68).

Numbers are rounded to the nearest 500. Estimates are for people aged 15–64 years. Country-level estimates of IDU prevalence are available in the appendix. IDU=injecting drug use. PWID=people who inject drugs. UI=uncertainty interval. 
*The country-level pooled estimates of the percentage of PWID who are women, which informed these regional estimates, are presented in the appendix. †No estimates of the prevalence of injecting drug use could be located for the Pacific Island 
States and Territories, so we used the weighted observed global prevalence here; we also did not locate any eligible studies of people who inject drugs in these countries, so the observed global weighted percentage of PWID who are women was used 
in estimating the number of male and female PWID—considerable caution should be used in the interpretation of these estimates.

HBV and HCV, and HIV), 8173 grey literature reports 
from websites listed in the appendix (pp 11–60), and, in 
our supplementary search, 15 420 papers or reports from 
international organisations or from hand searches of 
85 reviews that we identified as relevant. We received an 
additional 61 papers or reports from experts. Across these 
search stages, 1147 records were ultimately eligible for at 
least one aspect of our review (figure 1).
As of June 5, 2017, evidence of IDU was reported in 
179 of 206 countries or territories; these countries hold 
99% of the world’s population aged 15–64 years (table 1). 
This is an increase of 31 countries since the previous 
review of IDU prevalence.6 The additional countries were 
mostly in sub-Saharan Africa (n=23) and four Pacific 
Island States and Territories. The number of studies 
estimating IDU prevalence also increased, with an 
additional 22 countries now having an estimate of IDU 
prevalence since the previous review (nine of these in 
sub-Saharan Africa; table 1), such that 83 countries 
(containing 82% of world population aged 15–64 years) 
now have an estimate of IDU prevalence.
We also noted increases in the number of countries 
with studies quantifying the prevalence of HIV, HCV, 
and HBV infection among PWID (table 1). The region 
with the largest number of countries with new data was 
sub-Saharan Africa, which had new studies of HIV in 
12 countries, HCV in six countries, and HBV in four 
countries. The Middle East and north Africa also had 
increases in the number of countries with studies (four 
on HIV, three on HCV, and two on HBV).
Globally, in 2015 an estimated 15·6 million people 
(95% UI 10∙2–23∙7 million) injected drugs, amounting 
to approximately 0∙33% (0∙21–0∙49) of those aged 
15–64 years (table 2; detailed country estimates are given 
in the appendix (pp 72–78). We estimated that 3·2 million 
(1·6–5·1 million) women inject drugs globally.
At a regional level, prevalence varied from 0·09% 
(95% UI 0∙07–0∙11) in south Asia to 1∙30% (0∙71–2∙15) 
in eastern Europe (table 2). The largest populations 
of PWID were in east and southeast Asia (4∙0 million, 
3∙0–5∙0 
million), 
eastern 
Europe 
(3∙0 
million, 
1·7–5·0 million), and North America (2∙6 million, 
1·5–4∙4 million).
The percentage of PWID who were women varied 
substantially across regions (table 2). We estimated that 
women represented 30∙0% (95% UI 28·5–31·5) of 
PWID in North America and 33∙4% (31·0–35·6) in 
Australasia, compared with 3∙1% (2·1–4·1) among PWID 
in south Asia. The prevalence of IDU among men was 
far higher than in women in all regions.
We noted substantial variation in the estimated country-
level prevalence of IDU (figure 2); country estimates and 
further details are available in the appendix (pp 72–78). 
Georgia and Seychelles had the highest estimates for IDU 
prevalence; however, Russia, the USA, and China 
contributed the largest proportions of the total IDU

population. We estimated much lower prevalence for 
countries in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa than in other 
regions, with some exceptions, for example Seychelles 
and Malaysia.
Globally, we estimate that 2∙8 million (95% UI 
1∙5–4∙5 million) PWID are living with HIV, amounting 
to 17∙8% (10∙8–24∙8) of PWID (table 3). HIV prevalence 
among PWID varied substantially across geographical 
regions, from 1∙1% (0·8–1·4) in Australasia, 3∙6% 
(1·5–6·2) in the Middle East and north Africa, and 4∙5% 
(3·2–6·0) in western Europe, to 24∙7% (15·6–33·9) in 
eastern Europe and 35∙7% (15·0–56·6) in Latin America. 
We estimate that eastern Europe and Latin America have 
the largest numbers of PWID living with HIV.
The prevalence of HIV among PWID varied widely 
across countries even within regions, as shown in 
figure 3 (country estimates and details are presented in 
the appendix pp 79–91). For example, in eastern Europe, 
HIV prevalence estimates ranged from 0∙01% in Slovakia 
to 53∙4% in Estonia, while in western Europe, estimates 
ranged from 0% in Serbia to 32∙6% in Spain.
Globally we estimated that 52∙3% (95% UI 42·4–62∙1) 
of current PWID have been exposed to hepatitis C (anti-
HCV positive), equating to 8∙2 million (4∙7–12∙4 million) 
people. Only 21 countries had eligible studies with data 
on HCV-RNA prevalence. In most regions and countries, 
more than half of PWID have been infected with HCV. 
We estimated that PWID in sub-Saharan Africa had a 
lower prevalence of anti-HCV (21∙8%, 17∙6–26∙5) 
compared with regions where IDU has been established 
for longer. We estimated higher anti-HCV prevalence in 
some countries in east and southeast Asia (eg, Indonesia, 
Taiwan, Thailand), although the regional estimated 
prevalence was lower, largely because HCV-antibody 
prevalence among PWID in China was estimated to be 
lower (figure 4; country estimates and details are provided 
in the appendix pp 92–103).
We estimated that 9∙1% (95% UI 5·1–13∙2) of PWID 
have chronic HBV infection (HBsAg positive), equating 
to 1∙4 million (0∙7–2∙4 million) people. The region 
(table 3) with the highest estimated HBsAg prevalence 
among PWID was east and southeast Asia, although 
countries with the highest prevalence also included the 
Czech Republic, Egypt, Belarus, Lithuania, the Côte 
d’Ivoire, and Azerbaijan (figure 5; country estimates and 
details are provided in the appendix pp 104–112). We 
estimated that PWID in east and southeast Asia represent 
more than half of all HBsAg-positive PWID worldwide 
(table 3).
Regional estimates of the characteristics of populations 
of PWID are presented in table 4 (country-level estimates 
and source references for all pooled estimates are 
available in the appendix pp 113–157). We found 
substantial geographic variation in the age of PWID.

The proportion of young PWID (age <25 years) was lower 
in countries from Australasia (14∙9%, range 9∙5–20∙3) 
and North America (15∙3%, 11∙1–27∙5), and much higher 
in countries from Latin America (51∙2%, 43∙1–59∙6%). 
The lowest proportions of young PWID were in the 
Caribbean and central Asia, although estimates in these 
regions were only based on one country each (Puerto 
Rico and Kyrgyzstan, respectively).
The extent of exposure to risk also varied substantially. 
Exposure of PWID to recent homelessness or unstable 
housing ranged from 6∙7% (range 4∙4–9∙2) in eastern 
Europe to 50∙3% (39∙7–61∙0) in North America. History 
of incarceration ranged from 35∙7% (31∙6–40∙0) in 
eastern Europe to 82∙4% (79∙0–85∙7) in Puerto Rico, the 
only country in the Caribbean for which estimates could 
be calculated, and recent involvement with sex work 
ranged from 3∙3% (1∙2–7∙1) in the Caribbean (ie, 
Puerto Rico) to 21∙3% (11∙0–31∙6) in North America.
The extent of engagement in injecting and sexual risk 
behaviours varied widely among samples of PWID across 
countries. The proportion reporting recent injecting risk 
(using shared needles or syringes) was much higher in 
Latin America (54∙0%, range 44∙5–63∙5) and central Asia 
(46∙8%, 42∙7–50∙7), and lowest in western Europe 
(10∙2%, 7∙7–12∙9). The highest rates of recent sexual risk 
(ie, unprotected sex) were in sub-Saharan Africa (47·5%, 
36·8–58·3), the Middle East and north Africa (40∙1%, 
34·0–46∙3), western Europe (38·0%, 33·5–42∙4), and 
eastern Europe (37∙7%, 33∙4–42∙0), whereas the lowest 
proportion was in Australasia (10∙7%, 6∙7–15∙1).
Opioids were typically the main drug injected (table 4). 
The country with the lowest percentage of PWID reporting 
opioids as their main drug was the Czech Republic 
(21∙6%, range 17∙3–26∙3; appendix pp 113–57). Higher 
proportions of PWID had stimulants as their main 
injected drug in countries in North America, eastern 
Europe, and Australasia (table 4). The pooled percentages 
of opioids and stimulants could exceed 100% because 
different studies could be included in the opioid versus 
stimulant pooled estimates, and in some countries, PWID 
reported that a combination of opioid and stimulants (eg, 
so-called speedballs) was their main drug injected.
The number of estimates and quality grading for each 
country is shown in the appendix (pp 70–109), for IDU 
prevalence and HIV, HCV-antibody, and HBsAg 
prevalence among PWID. Overall, 237 of 343 country-
level estimates were based on evidence from grade A or B 
study 
methods, 
and 
20 
country-level 
estimates 
represented pooled data across multiple grade estimates, 
which included C grade estimates. If we restricted IDU 
prevalence estimates to grade A or B only (ie, indirect 
prevalence estimation studies and household surveys 
only), the global estimated prevalence of PWID would be 
slightly lower than our main calculation, at 0∙27%

(95% UI 0∙17–0∙45). If we restricted the blood-borne 
virus prevalence studies to A and B grade studies only (ie, 
studies including varied samples of PWID from varied 
locations, rather than those with more limited samples 
or locations), the global prevalence among PWID would 
be 15∙6% (9∙8–22∙1) for HIV, 51·5% (40∙6–62∙3) for 
anti-HCV, and 8∙4% (6∙4–10∙8) for HBsAg. The 
timeframe for identifying PWID was not clearly specified 
in 228 (31%) of 735 studies of characteristics and blood-
borne viruses.
Discussion
In the years since the last major systematic reviews,6,7 
there has been a marked increase in the amount of 
evidence documenting injecting drug use (IDU) and the 
prevalence of HIV, HCV, and HBV infection in PWID. 
There is now evidence of IDU in 179 countries that contain 
99% of the world’s population aged 15–64 years, up from 
148 countries in 2007, with the increase largely due to low-
income and middle-income countries. We estimate the 
number of PWID globally to be 15·6 million and that 
roughly one in six are living with HIV, more than half have 
been exposed to HCV, and one in ten have active HBV. We 
also estimate that most PWID are exposed to environments 
that increase their risk of drug-related harm, which, to our 
knowledge, is the first such global estimate.
There have been improved efforts to understand the 
epidemiology of IDU and of HIV, HCV, and HBV 
infection among PWID in many countries. Particularly 
for blood-borne virus prevalence, we located many new 
country estimates, as well as greater coverage of countries 
with prevalence estimates. However, we noted that few 
countries had eligible studies with estimates of HCV-
RNA prevalence among recent PWID, highlighting

Data are % (range). ·· shows that although there is evidence that injecting drug use is occurring in this region, we found no eligible studies involving PWID that examined this characteristic. Some countries are 
not included in our estimates as we did not find documented evidence or reports of injecting drug use for them: Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Botswana, Central African Republic, Comoros, Cuba, 
North Korea, Dominica, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Greenland, Grenada, Guinea-Bissau, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Mauritania, Namibia, Nauru, Republic of Congo, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, São Tomé and 
Príncipe, Saint Vincent and Grenadines, South Sudan, Trinidad and Tobago, and Tuvalu. Decision rules and data extraction procedures for these characteristics and source references for data used in pooled 
estimates for each country are available in the appendix. *Young people who inject drugs were defined as younger than 25 years where possible; some countries had studies that used slightly different age 
groupings. †Recent injecting risk was defined as receptive needle-syringe sharing (ie, using a needle-syringe after someone else); some exceptions to this terminology occurred for some estimates (appendix), 
but all estimates were for behaviours within the past year. ‡Recent sexual risk was defined as unprotected sex with a non-regular (casual) sexual partner; some exceptions to this terminology occurred for some 
estimates (appendix), but all estimates were for behaviours within the past year. §The main drug column estimates are not exactly additive; estimates from different samples of PWID might have been used for 
each indicator (opioids or stimulants), and, in some countries (eg, Mexico), there was a large proportion of PWID who reported injecting a combination of opioids and stimulants together as their main drug 
(so-called speedballs), in which case these were counted as both opioids and stimulants being the main drugs injected.

considerable knowledge gaps that will be important to 
fill in the future as HCV treatments are rolled out 
across countries.
Increases have occurred not only in the number of 
estimates and amount of evidence, but also in the quality 
of that evidence and strength of data generation. For 
example, we found an increase in the number of studies 
using so-called indirect methods to estimate the prevalence 
of IDU in the general population.29 Indirect methods are 
regarded as less susceptible to underestimation than 
general population surveys (ie, direct methods of 
estimating general population prevalence), which tend to 
miss populations who inject drugs.29 These indirect 
methods might involve different sources of data to 
indirectly estimate the total number of PWID, such as 
multiplier 
methods, 
back-projection, 
and 
capture–
recapture methods. Nonetheless indirect estimation also 
can be biased, and needs to be corroborated where possible 
with other evidence.30
We have not presented our new estimates of IDU and 
blood-borne virus prevalence alongside those from the 
previous reviews.6,7 Even in cases where countries had 
new estimates since the previous review, direct 
comparison was often hampered by changes to the 
methods used (ie, improvements), making it difficult to 
identify whether any changes in estimates were due to 
altered methods or changes in epidemiology. The 
exceptions were some countries, particularly in western 
and eastern Europe, where similar study designs have 
been implemented over time, and where the prevalence 
of injecting seems to have declined (eg, the Netherlands 
and Spain31). Additionally, the improvements in data in 
some regions (including region-specific estimates for the 
first time in the case of sub-Saharan Africa) mean that, 
compared with the estimates in the previous iteration 
(which we highlighted in the previous review6 as being 
very uncertain), the current estimates are now much 
more robust and arguably more plausible than those in 
the previous iteration. Furthermore, we improved our 
methods with respect to the selection and pooling of 
estimates, and took an approach that favoured better 
coverage of a country over recency of the data. We used 
multiple estimates to inform a pooled estimate rather 
than selecting a single upper and lower estimate, and we 
took a different approach to the estimation of uncertainty. 
We feel that this approach better considers the potential 
geographic heterogeneity within a country than our 
previous methods (eg, very high IDU prevalence in some 
areas such as in cities in Germany32 and India33).
Our estimates of demographic and risk characteristics 
of PWID revealed variation across countries, but also 
some consistent findings. Although PWID in some 
countries had lower levels of exposure to risk 
environments than others, in general, PWID were 
exposed to adverse risk environments around the world. 
Compared with the general population, PWID are at 
greater risk of police arrest, incarceration, sex work, and 
the experience of homelessness or unstable housing, all 
of which are associated with increased blood-borne virus 
transmission. Notably, these experiences were often 
more common in high-income countries, including 
those in North America.
We found clear variation in the age and gender profile 
of PWID, with a tendency for PWID in high-income 
countries to be older and to include a higher proportion 
of women than in lower-income countries. There is 
increasing evidence of ageing populations of PWID in 
many settings where IDU has been reported for some 
time, particularly in Europe,34 North America,35 and 
Australasia.36 Over roughly the past 5 years, increases in 
IDU and outbreaks of HIV have occurred in the USA, 
which are related to large-scale prescription of 
pharmaceutical opioids and subsequent transition to 
heroin use and IDU.37
Our data have substantial policy importance. There is 
an imperative to invest in blood-borne virus prevention 
activities, such as needle and syringe programmes and 
opioid substitution therapy, and to provide treatment and 
care for those who are living with HIV38 and HCV.39 In 
the special session of the UN General Assembly on the 
world drug problem in 2016, international agencies such 
as UNODC, WHO, and INCB were tasked to improve the 
accessibility of such services to people who use drugs, 
including PWID.40 Access to drug dependence treatment 
has been explicitly highlighted as one of the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) under the 2030 Agenda for 
Sustainable Development12 and targets for preventing 
and 
eliminating 
HIV 
and 
hepatitis 
have 
been 
developed.10,11 We examined the current coverage levels of 
these interventions for PWID separately.27
Simultaneously other drivers of vulnerability, risk, and 
harm among this key population need to be addressed. 
Our review of existing characteristics of PWID suggests 
that there is considerable cause for concern across 
multiple indicators about the level of exposure to high-
risk environments that PWID face and the level of 
engagement in risk behaviours that occurs among PWID 
in some countries.
We have identified various structural barriers to and 
opportunities for reducing risks for PWID and 
improving access to services to prevent and treat HIV 
and hepatitis. For example, roughly three in five PWID 
surveyed globally report exposure to incarceration, 
where high levels of risk often occur both in terms of 
drug use and other risks to wellbeing.4,15 Prisons often 
have limited or no health-care services, an issue of 
importance given that risk of drug withdrawal, suicide, 
and overdose following prolonged abstinence can all be 
elevated in that environment for PWID. Prisons can 
also serve as places where the health of PWID can be 
improved and this must be better addressed, such as 
through ensuring access to drug treatment, blood-borne 
virus prevention and treatment, and other general

There are several limitations related to the nature of 
the data located in this review. IDU is a comparatively 
rare exposure and PWID are a highly marginalised 
population, so traditional general survey methods are 
unlikely to capture the frequency or prevalence of 
exposure or harm, and we had to rely on a mixture of 
indirect methods and specific surveys of PWID. This 
feature could be part of the reason for the poor availability 
of data and national estimates in some countries. 
Definitions of IDU also varied by study; the timeframe 
for identifying PWID was not clearly specified in 31% of 
studies. Poor operationalisation of key variables also 
often applied to the literature on sociodemographic and 
risk characteristics, in that the specific behaviour and 
timeframe (eg, receptive syringe sharing within the past 
month) were not consistently detailed. Importantly, we 
also assumed that studies reported gender (rather than 
sex) in extracting data on the percentage of PWID who 
were women; some studies might have assessed sex 
rather than gender, and people who are transgender or 
gender diverse could have been misclassified in those 
studies.
There has been an increase in research involving 
PWID over the past decade. Nonetheless, there remains 
substantial scope to continue increasing the quality and 
geographical coverage of estimates for all of the indicators 
examined in this study. Until national studies are 
implemented consistently and in repeated fashion over 
time, we will be limited in our capacity to reach firm 
conclusions about changes in population-level IDU 
prevalence or blood-borne virus prevalence among 
PWID. As long as national estimates remain absent for 
some countries, the possibility remains that estimates of 
IDU and profiles of the characteristics of PWID based on 
subnational studies might not provide an accurate profile 
of PWID across the whole country.
Our systematic review was subject to limitations. First, 
despite the wide scope of our online searches and 
requests for information from people across many 
countries, grey literature reports can be difficult to access, 
especially when they are not formally posted online. 
Undoubtedly, we will have missed some of these studies. 
To address this challenge as much as possible, we liaised 
directly with WHO, the Global Fund, UNODC, 
EMCDDA, and UNAIDS staff to facilitate contact with 
people in-country and obtain reports that were not 
available online, and in the case of the Global Fund, this 
was an important source of data from their Integrated 
HIV Bio-behavioural Surveillance surveys.
Second, many documents were reviewed by a small 
research team in a short period of time, so we might have 
missed some information in this process. However, 
internal checks were done by members within this team 
and we used a process of double and triple checking. 
Where queries existed around estimates that we could 
not resolve, we contacted people in-country to request 
their feedback. Furthermore, the estimates produced 
were circulated to all potential authors for input, allowing 
for the identification of missing or incorrect data.
Third, errors could have been made in the data 
interpretation. To reduce such errors, all sources and 
data from which the final estimates were derived were 
double checked by at least two reviewers before inclusion, 
with a further round of checks by a third reviewer before 
finalisation. We have online interactive presentations of 
these data to facilitate transparency and increase the 
potential for many people to interact with the estimates 
and results. We encourage feedback by email.
Fourth, in contrast to the previous global review, in this 
review, we had teams of researchers able to search and 
screen in multiple languages other than English. 
Nonetheless, we might have missed documents in 
languages in which we are not fluent. Again, we 
encourage anyone with access to data or reports in other 
languages to contact us.
It is also important to acknowledge a number of 
features of our approach to synthesis and imputation of 
estimates, which were driven by the gaps in the data 
available. Although there has been a clear increase in 
efforts to quantify the extent of IDU and the prevalence 
of blood-borne virus infection among PWID, there are 
still major gaps in data in some regions. In the Caribbean 
region, Puerto Rico was the only territory from which our 
review found data available on the prevalence of IDU and 
blood-borne viruses. In the Pacific Island States and 
Territories, IDU could be occurring in at least 15 of 
17 countries, but no data estimating the prevalence of 
IDU or blood-borne viruses among PWID were available 
for any country. As such, estimates for this region were 
imputed based on the global weighted average. Although 
this method enables final global estimates that are better 
than assuming zero prevalence in countries where IDU 
occurs, greater availability of national estimates will 
improve precision in the regional and global estimates.
Our current method of calculating regional and global 
estimates of the prevalence of IDU and blood-borne 
viruses essentially assumes a correlation of 1 between 
countries within a given region, which is unlikely. Our 
midpoint estimates are accurate, but our standard errors 
are likely to be overestimated, leading to wider 
uncertainty and confidence intervals. However, without 
data on the correlation of prevalence between countries 
within regions, our current method is more conservative 
than the alternative of assuming zero correlation, which 
would result in narrower intervals. Future work on the 
correlation of IDU prevalence between countries within 
regions would provide data that we can use to improve 
the accuracy of the lower and upper bounds.
We used a hierarchical grading system to evaluate 
estimates on the basis of generalisability geographically 
(eg, from multiple sites) and across various populations 
of PWID (eg, treatment and non-treatment samples). 
Exclusion of estimates on the basis of a study’s 
methodology grade was only applied to estimates of IDU

and blood-borne virus prevalence. Nonetheless, our new 
approach, which involved pooling estimates, and our 
more sophisticated approach to estimating uncertainty 
around all our estimates, including our method of 
estimating uncertainty around imputed estimates, are 
both improvements on previous reviews.
For the purposes of calculating pooled estimates of the 
characteristics of PWID, we needed to make decisions 
about which types of data to pool (appendix pp 69–71). 
For measures of injecting and sexual risk, although we 
selected estimates of receptive needle-syringe sharing, 
and unprotected sexual intercourse, there was variation 
in the specific wording and questions used to assess 
these behaviours. We also report the percentage of PWID 
who had recently engaged in sex work, which was 
typically defined as in the past year; it is likely that levels 
of sex work varied among men and women, but studies 
rarely reported this factor disaggregated by gender.
IDU has been documented in most countries and HIV 
and HCV are prevalent among many populations of 
PWID, representing a significant challenge to global 
public health. Through a process of collating and 
summarising data on a number of characteristics of 
PWID and their experiences, it is also obvious that PWID 
experience substantial exposure to risk environments. 
This study reinforces the importance of IDU to the global 
disease burden of blood-borne viruses. The improved 
data availability should allow for more effective 
programme planning and the allocation of resources at 
both national and international levels, particularly to 
address HIV and HCV, which are highly prevalent among 
PWID in many places of the world. However, considerable 
gaps in knowledge remain that require further research, 
especially on the prevalence of blood-borne viruses 
among populations of PWID. Our data highlight the 
substantial exposure of PWID to risk environments, 
suggesting that efforts to reduce harms among PWID 
also need to address structural and environmental factors 
that predispose PWID to elevated risks of harm.
