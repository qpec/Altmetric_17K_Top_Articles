Management of prosthetic vascular graft infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be a signifi-
cant challenge to clinicians. These infections often do not resolve with antibiotic therapy alone due to
antibiotic resistance/tolerance by bacteria, poor ability of antibiotics to permeate/reduce biofilms and/
or other factors. Bacteriophage OMKO1 binding to efflux pump proteins in P. aeruginosa was consistent
with an evolutionary trade-off: wildtype bacteria were killed by phage whereas evolution of phage-resist-
ance led to increased antibiotic sensitivity. However, phage clinical-use has not been demonstrated.
Here, we present a case report detailing therapeutic application of phage OMKO1 to treat a chronic
P. aeruginosa infection of an aortic Dacron graft with associated aorto-cutaneous fistula. Following a
single application of phage OMKO1 and ceftazidime, the infection appeared to resolve with no signs of
recurrence.

INTRODUCTION
The widespread evolution of multi-drug-resistant
(MDR) bacterial infections poses an escalating glo-
bal threat to human health, highlighted by the recent
World Health Organization’s first ever list of antibi-
otic resistant ‘priority pathogens’ [1]. Consequently,
the increasing failure of traditional antibiotics has
necessitated the development of novel antibacterial
strategies, especially new therapies that target MDR
bacteria
which
frequently
colonize
prosthetics
associated with common surgeries. However, it is
inevitable that pathogenic bacteria will evolve resist-
ance against novel therapeutic intervention. Thus,
new approaches ideally should target MDR bacterial

 pathogens while acknowledging that their further evolution would
be unavoidable. In particular, these newly developed strategies
could be designed to exert selection pressure on the bacteria to
respond evolutionarily to therapy, by becoming on-average less
biomedically problematic (e.g. reduced virulence, pathogenicity
and/or transmissibility) [2–5]. This approach could be capable of
successfully limiting MDR bacterial infections and additionally
directing evolution of the pathogen in a clinically meaningful way.
Prosthetic vascular graft infections (PVGI) are catastrophic
events which present serious challenges to surgeons and place
heavy economic burdens on patients and the healthcare system.
The reported incidence ranges from 0.6% to 9.5% depending on
graft site [6, 7] and there are currently no readily identifiable or
practical algorithms for their management. Traditional interven-
tion strategies involve systemic antibiotics, debridement of in-
fected tissue, partial-to-complete graft excision and secondary
revascularization [8]. However, many patients presenting with
vascular graft infections have significant comorbidities and are
often critically ill, complicating surgical intervention and reducing
likelihood of a positive clinical outcome. Despite best manage-
ment, mortality and morbidity rates remain high with conservative
estimates for both over 20% [9, 10]. Reinfection rates are also
significant, highlighting the inadequacy of current treatment
modalities at eradicating the infecting organism. As the number
of procedures involving vascular grafts continues to increase with
an aging population and prevalence of atherosclerosis and dia-
betes, new approaches to the management of PVGI are needed.
A common source of PVGIs is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a ubi-
quitous Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium prevalent in nat-
ural and artificial environments [11] and listed as an increasingly
antibiotic resistant priority pathogen [1]. Adaptation to myriad
habitats has allowed P. aeruginosa to persist in many human-
associated environments, most notably in hospitals, where it is
increasingly associated with nosocomial infections [12]. These
infections are difficult to manage, in part due to intrinsic antibiotic
resistance resulting from decreased membrane permeability, ac-
tive antibiotic efflux and other chromosomally encoded enzymes.
Further complicating the problem of P. aeruginosa infections is
their ability to form biofilms. Biofilm-mediated infections are no-
toriously difficult to manage, due to their generally greater resist-
ance to chemical antimicrobials [13] and formation following
sub-lethal concentrations of antibiotics [14]. Furthermore, slow-
growing cells present in the biofilm (e.g. persister cells) may have
sufficiently reduced metabolisms, resulting in resistance to bac-
teriostatic antibiotics that target metabolically active bacteria [15].
As a result, biofilms may also act as a reservoir for the dissemin-
ation of infections throughout the body which could greatly pro-
long infection duration and severity.
One potential alternative approach to using traditional antibi-
otics for prevention/treatment of bacterial infections is ‘phage
therapy,’ the application of lytic bacteriophages (or ‘phages;’
viruses of bacteria) for the bio-control of bacteria. As one of the
first classes of antimicrobials discovered in the modern era, their
application has had a controversial past and their clinical use has
not been fully accepted in Westernized countries. However,
studies performed in the latter half of the 20th century [16], recent
clinical trials [17, 18] and individual case reports [19] that demon-
strate safety and potential efficacy have renewed interest in phage
therapy as a possible mechanism by which antibiotic resistant and
biofilm-associated infections might be controlled. As a class of
antibacterials, phages are distinct from traditional chemical anti-
biotics in four seemingly beneficial ways: they are self-amplifying/
limiting in the presence/absence of substrate (i.e. susceptible
bacteria); they are often able to penetrate biofilms to reach infec-
tious bacteria [20–22]; they are capable of infecting/killing
persister cells; and their killing mechanism is distinct from those
of traditional antibiotics. Exploiting the differences between anti-
biotics and phage therapy has been a driving force for continued
research into the potential clinical utility of phage therapy.
However, one obvious drawback to phage therapy is the clear
evidence that bacteria can readily evolve resistance to phage in-
fection [23, 24]. For example, phage attachment to a receptor
binding-site exerts selection pressure for altered or down-
regulated expression of the receptor, thereby allowing bacteria
to escape phage infection [23]. Because evolved phage-resistance
is virtually certain, modern approaches to phage therapy must
acknowledge and capitalize on this inevitability. Trade-offs are
often observed in biology, where organisms evolve one trait that
improves fitness (a relative reproduction or survival advantage),
while simultaneously suffering reduced performance in another
trait [25–29]. Thus, phage therapy could be developed as an ‘evo-
lutionary-based strategy’ that forces a trade-off of greatest rele-
vance to the problem of widespread antibiotic resistance: utilize
phages that drive MDR bacterial pathogens to evolve increased
phage resistance by suffering increased sensitivity to chemical
antibiotics (Fig. 1). This approach to phage therapy should be
doubly effective; success is achieved when phage kills the target
bacterium, and success is also achieved when bacteria evolve
phage resistance because they suffer increased sensitivity to clin-
ically approved antibiotics.
We recently identified phage OMKO1 that appears to utilize the
outer membrane protein M of the mexAB- and mexXY-multidrug
efflux systems of P. aeruginosa [30], exerting selection pressure for
bacteria to evolve increased phage resistance that ‘trades-off’ with
bacterial ability to maintain resistance to antibiotics (Fig. 1).
These data suggest that bacteria evolve resistance to phage
OMKO1 via mutations that alter efflux-pump proteins as binding
sites for phage, thereby decreasing the ability for bacteria to ex-
trude antibiotics and causing them to become antibiotic sensitive.
This outcome is consistent with an evolutionary trade-off, which
should allow phage OMKO1 to act synergistically with antibiotics
in combination therapy. The use of this phage therapeutically,
however, has not been previously tested. Numerous studies have
examined the impact of phages on biofilms [21], but we are

 unaware of a case involving therapeutic application of phages to
disrupt biofilms in a PVGI caused by MDR pathogen. Although
methods to best leverage a phage-resistance/antibiotic-sensitiv-
ity trade-off in a clinical setting would be informed by consider-
ation
of
dosage
strategies
(simultaneous
vs
alternating
administration of phage and antibiotic); of pharmacokinetics
and pharmacodynamics to optimize the trade-off; and of the pos-
sibility that MDR P. aeruginosa can simultaneously evolve resist-
ance to phage and antibiotics, these questions are the targets of
ongoing studies. Nevertheless, based on in vitro evidence that
phage OMKO1 selects for re-sensitization to antibiotics in clinic-
ally relevant P. aeruginosa strains [30], we report the outcome of a
single emergency case of phage therapy to treat a PVGI (chronic
aortic Dacron graft) caused by P. aeruginosa.
LABORATORY ASSAYS
Based on previous results [30], we hypothesized that additive ef-
fects, and potential synergy, between phage OMKO1 and ceftazi-
dime could be utilized to disrupt P. aeruginosa biofilms when
concentrations of antibiotic alone were too low to destroy the
biofilm but sufficient to eliminate planktonic bacteria. Figure 2A
illustrates this hypothetical synergy whereby phage-sensitive
(antibiotic-resistant) cells in the biofilm are lysed, disrupting bio-
film stability and exposing cells to lethal concentrations of antibi-
otic that kills phage-resistant (antibiotic-sensitive) bacteria. To
examine potential synergy or additive effects and exclude con-
cerns of phage/antibiotic antagonism prior to emergency appli-
cation of phage OMKO1, we performed in vitro biofilm reduction
assays using the strain isolated from fistular discharge of the
patient.
Biofilms were grown on 3 mm � 3 mm sections of Dacron by
inoculating each section in 150 ml 0.1 � LB broth in a 96-well dish
with 50 ml of an overnight culture of P. aeruginosa isolated from
fistular discharge of our patient. Dacron sections were removed
from growth media after 72-h and rinsed with 200 ml of 0.1 � LB
three times to remove planktonic cells. Following rinse, sections
were added to 200 ml of LB medium containing treatment (phage
OMKO1, ceftazidime or ciprofloxacin at 2 � MIC, antibiotic at 2 �
MIC + phage OMKO1, or blank control). Following exposure to
treatment for 24 h, Dacron sections were placed in fresh LB me-
dium and allowed to incubate at 37�C for an additional 24 h with-
out agitation. Dacron sections were then removed and cell density
(optical density at absorbance wavelength 600 nm; OD600) was
measured with an automated spectrophotometer (Tecan model
Infinite F200 microplate-reader). Results (Fig. 2B) showed that
phage OMKO1 combined with either ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime
caused mean (n = 3) cell densities grown on Dacron sections to be
statistically significantly lower than those exposed to either anti-
biotic alone (t-test with P < 0.001, ciprofloxacin; and P < 0.007,
ceftazidime). Furthermore, treatment with phage alone was
observed to significantly reduce mean cell densities relative to
no treatment (P < 0.001). However, neither ciprofloxacin nor cef-
tazidime at 2 � MIC was sufficient to eliminate 72 h biofilms
(P = 0.074, ciprofloxacin; P = 0.357, ceftazidime). These data
indicated that the antibiotics were incapable of reducing cell
densities in biofilms, whereas phage OMKO1 alone or in combin-
ation with antibiotic significantly reduced bacterial densities. The
experiment also confirmed that phage OMKO1 and antibiotic
showed no evidence of antagonistic interactions, suggesting that
their co-administered treatment would not adversely affect bio-
film reduction in the patient.
We then determined the minimum dose of phage OMKO1
required to remove biofilms in the absence of antibiotic to provide
guidance for the in vivo efficacy, under the conservative assump-
tion that possible phage-antibiotic synergy would not necessarily

 benefit the patient during treatment. To do so, we conducted
replicated (n = 3) assays measuring minimum bactericidal titer,
where differing concentrations of phage OMKO1 were used to
attack biofilms initiated with constant cell densities identical to
those used in the above-described biofilm reduction assays. Assay
treatments consisted of serial 10-fold dilutions of phage OMKO1
starting at 10e10 plaque forming units (PFU) per ml. Cell densities
(OD600) were then used to estimate the minimum multiplicity of
infection (MOI: phage particles per cell) required to reduce bio-
films on Dacron sections to a value less than OD600 = 0.1 (our limit
of detection of viable bacterial cells using these methods). Results
(Fig. 2C) showed that target biofilm reduction was achieved at
MOI � 0.00001, indicating that phage OMKO1 was highly effect-
ive at reducing biofilm densities even at very low relative
frequencies of phage particles. The data suggested that a single
treatment using 1,000 PFU of phage OMKO1 might be sufficient
to effectively reduce a biofilm of �1e8 CFU of the P. aeruginosa
patient strain, even if phage-antibiotic synergy per se could not be
achieved during treatment.
CASE PRESENTATION
In July 2012, our 76-year old male patient underwent aortic arch
replacement surgery with a Dacron graft for an aortic aneurysm.
This was complicated by a P. aeruginosa mediastinal and aortic
graft infection (confirmed by blood and deep wound culture) for
which the patient returned to the operating room on multiple oc-
casions for debridement and washout of the infected chest wall
(Fig. 3A). The chest wall was eventually closed with omental and
bilateral pectoralis major flaps. The patient was admitted again in
early 2013 for recurrent P. aeruginosa infection (confirmed by
blood and deep wound culture) and a new mediastinal fistula
which drained purulent material. The patient was deemed too
high risk for surgical replacement of his infected aortic graft after
extensive discussions with his treating cardiac surgeon and mul-
tiple other consulting surgeons from other institutions. Therefore,
the patient was conservatively treated with IV ceftazidime and
superficial chest wall debridement. The patient was successfully
discharged from the hospital, completed his multi-week course of
intravenous ceftazidime (2 g IV q8h), and was switched to oral
ciprofloxacin (750 mg q12h) as the isolated P. aeruginosa was sus-
ceptible to ciprofloxacin at this time. Over the course of the next
year into 2014 the patient was admitted three more times for
P. aeruginosa bacteremia (confirmed by cultures) which always
began with subjective fevers and increased purulent drainage
from his mediastinal fistula. CT imaging during the patient’s ad-
mission in October of 2013 showed increased perigraft fluid near
the aortic root with surrounding phlegmonous changes in con-
tinuation with the mediastinal fistula tract (Fig. 3B). This poorly
organized phlegmonous collection was thought to be the source

 of the mediastinal fistula discharge. However, the collection never
became organized enough on subsequent CT scans to attempt
drainage. During these admissions, his P. aeruginosa sample
showed intermediate resistance to ciprofloxacin; therefore, the
patient was treated with several week courses of intravenous cef-
tazidime that successfully suppressed the infection. Between
each admission, attempts were made to restart oral ciprofloxacin
after discussions with the infectious disease physician, but the
patient eventually became septic after each attempt, necessitating
intravenous ceftazidime treatment. The patient stayed abroad for
over a year after his last hospital admission in May of 2014 where
the patient continued to receive intravenous ceftazidime treat-
ment. The patient presented to our clinic in late 2015 complaining
of increased serosanguinous drainage from his mediastinal fis-
tula. While the fistula had intermittently expressed mild
serosanguinous drainage, the patient grew troubled because the
fluid appeared to have become bloodier in nature. Based on this
history, we became concerned that the perigraft, phlegmonous
collection could be eroding into the aorta itself. The patient was
not a candidate for elective surgical management and the patient,
himself, wished to explore options other than indefinite antibac-
terial treatment. It was deemed at this time that the patient would
make an ideal candidate for exploration of phage therapy with
phage OMKO1.
CASE MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME
We proposed a procedure in which we would directly access the
perigraft collection anterior to the aortic root by needle puncture
using image guidance. At this site, we would distribute a mixture
of phage OMKO1 and ceftazidime that had demonstrated syner-
gism in a previous study [30]. This strategy was further supported
by data in the current study (Fig. 2B and C) that used the strain
isolated from the fistular discharge and confirmed re-sensitization
to antibiotic in bacteria with evolved resistance to phage OMKO1.
Importantly, these assays approximated the efficacy of in vivo bio-
film breakdown, as it was unlikely that subsequent applications of
phage OMKO1 would have been possible due to the complicated
involvement of the proposed procedure.
Purification and preparation of phage OMKO1
Application of phage OMKO1 required removal of endotoxins
present
in
the phage
lysate,
because
endotoxemia
(and
associated septic shock) was perceived as the greatest possible
risk to the patient’s health. This endotoxin removal was accom-
plished via spin column (Pierce High Capacity Endotoxin Removal
Spin Columns, Thermo Fisher) followed by dialysis in phosphate
buffered saline. Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) testing was then
performed by a third-party laboratory (Associates of Cape Cod,
East Falmouth, MA) to determine endotoxin concentrations.
Upon receiving endotoxin levels, dilution of the preparation was
performed in injectable saline to produce a final concentration of
12.5 EU/ml and titer of 10e7 plaque forming units per ml (PFU/
ml). This administered titer was determined to be acceptable and
to likely exceed the minimum MOI capable of effectively reducing
72-h-old biofilms of the fistular-discharge strain in preliminary
bactericidal titer assays (Fig. 2C), although the exact MOI at time
of treatment was unknowable.
Procedure
After the risks and benefits of the experimental procedure were
discussed, the patient consented to the procedure. The Food and
Drug Administration and Yale University Human Investigation
Committee gave their approval for the use of phage OMKO1 as

 an emergency investigational new drug (FDA IND#16827). In
January of 2016, pre-procedure CT imaging reconfirmed the
perigraft, phlegmonous collection near the left-anterior aortic root
which was first imaged in 2013. The collection had remained
stable, but due to the chronicity of the infection and inflammation
seen on imaging, heavy scarring was predicted to hinder our at-
tempts at needle aspiration. The chest wall was punctured with a
needle (away from the site of the mediastinal fistula) and
advanced to the perigraft collection under direct CT guidance
and in sterile fashion. Fluid could not be aspirated back or in-
jected, confirming the heavy scarring in this area. Therefore, we
withdrew the needle from the chest and applied 10 ml of phage
OMKO1 (10e7 PFU/ml) and ceftazidime (0.2 g/ml) solution into
the mediastinal fistula which was in continuity with the perigraft
collection. A sterile dressing was placed over the fistula and the
patient was admitted to a telemetry monitored bed for observa-
tion. The following day, the patient had no complaints, exhibited
stable vital signs and had laboratory values within normal limits.
We were confident that no injury to the aorta had occurred, and the
patient was discharged still on his ceftazidime regimen. The pa-
tient returned to his home country shortly, thereafter.
Approximately 4 weeks post-procedure, the patient developed
significant bleeding from the mediastinal wound. Due to serious
concerns that an aortic perforation had occurred, the patient
underwent emergency exploratory surgery. By operative report,
aortic perforation was confirmed under direct visualization,
caused by severe adhesions between the aorta and ectopic bone
from remnants of the sternum. The patient underwent a partial
(3 � 7 cm) aorta and graft excision and replacement, and repair of
the mediastinal fistula. The entire graft could not be removed
despite attempts to do so. Cultures taken during this time only
revealed growth of Candida from the superficial chest wound
which was appropriately treated. Ceftazidime was discontinued
shortly after the surgery, and the patient has not had any evidence
of recurrent infection despite remaining off of antibiotics (based
on blood cultures, clinical symptoms and CT imaging).
DISCUSSION
The argument for use of phage therapy in biofilm-associated in-
fections is old and has a storied past. However, phage ability to
disrupt biofilms where traditional antibiotics fail is a significant
advantage (Fig. 2A) and should be considered for infections re-
fractory to standard management practices. Phage such as
OMKO1 that appear to force a clinically relevant trade-off may
present an effective solution to the inevitable evolution of resist-
ance by pathogenic bacteria. We verified the ability of phage
OMKO1 to re-sensitize bacteria to antibiotics in vitro [14] prior
to application, which provided valuable insight into the potential
clinical
outcome.
This
prior
work
provided
preliminary
data that suggested synergy could occur between phage
OMKO1 and chemical antibiotics. Interestingly, the current study
demonstrates the phage alone is capable of reducing bacterial
biofilm densities in the presence/absence of antibiotic, suggest-
ing phage-antibiotic antagonism should not be a concern during
treatment against P. aeruginosa biofilms. Future work will further
examine the conditions in which phage OMKO1 is effective alone
versus in synergy with antibiotics in killing bacterial pathogens.
The long history of phage therapy in the former Soviet Union
suggests that few, if any, side effects are associated with thera-
peutic application of bacteriophages [17, 18, 31, 32], and we did
not anticipate any negative effects following use of phage
OMKO1. In this case study, we did not observe any noticeable
side effects associated with phage OMKO1. It appears to have
been effective at biofilm reduction on prosthetic graft material,
contributing to eradicating the P. aeruginosa infection. The stand-
ard of care for an infected thoracic aortic graft is complete removal
of the infected graft, debridement of the surrounding infected
tissue, and graft replacement [33]. However, this is many times
deemed too risky, leading to more conservative treatments and/or
lifelong suppressive antibiotic therapy [34]. Despite treatment,
mortality rates for thoracic aortic graft infection range between
25% and 75% [34], and there is an approximately 20% risk of
reinfection if the patient survives graft replacement [35]. In our
case, only partial removal of the aortic graft was possible, greatly
increasing the reinfection risk and necessitating continued life-
long suppressive antibiotics. Yet, the patient has not had a recur-
rent infection in the 18 months since discontinuing antibiotics
after the emergent surgery. Due to these circumstances, we argue
that the phage therapy played a significant role in contributing to
the eradication of the P. aeruginosa infection. Eventual controlled
trials examining phage application as adjunctives may reveal im-
proved clinical outcomes in cases of recalcitrant infection, and we
hope that exploratory studies such as this one can provide pre-
liminary evidence suggesting that phage OMKO1 can greatly im-
prove the effects of antibiotics for the removal of P. aeruginosa
biofilms in PVGI.
Both the current case study and a recently reported treatment of
an Acinetobacter baumanii infection highlight why the understand-
ing of evolutionary biology is vital to the development and admin-
istration of phage therapy in humans. Schooley et al. reported
the personalized phage-based therapy in a 68-year-old diabetic
patient with necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by a MDR
A. baumanii infection [19]. Nine different phages with lytic activity
on the patient strain were identified, and were administered intra-
venously and percutaneously into abscess cavities using combin-
ations (cocktails) of phages. However, the rise of phage resistance
in the infecting bacterial population necessitated an iterative pro-
cess of phage cocktail formulation, because of recurrent failure
[19]. Although the patient’s infection ultimately resolved, this evo-
lutionary process demonstrates one obvious challenge of phage
therapy, where evolution of phage resistance occurs after treat-
ment is administered [23, 24]. In contrast, the current case study
indicates the fortuitous possibility for a single phage to apparently

 resolve the bacterial infection, where pre-treatment understand-
ing of the evolutionary mechanism (phage-resistance/antibiotic-
sensitivity trade-off) underlying bacterial resistance informed the
choice of phage used in experimental therapy. Together, the two
studies illustrate that improved understanding of both pre- and
post-treatment mechanisms of phage resistance are crucial for
further development of phage therapy strategies, for clinical medi-
cine to capitalize on the general utility of phage therapy as an
alternative to traditional antibiotics.
