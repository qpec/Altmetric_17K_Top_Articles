Introduction
Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the unexpected 
death of a seemingly healthy infant. It is the leading cause 
of post-neonatal infant death in high-income countries1 
and accounts for 2400 deaths per year in the USA alone.2 
Incidence varies internationally from approximately 
0·1 per 1000 livebirths in Japan and the Netherlands to 
0·8 per 1000 in New Zealand.1 Death commonly occurs 
at 2–4 months of age.2 Although the cause of death is 
unknown, several intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors have 
been identified, including prematurity, male sex, prone 
sleeping position, and bed sharing.1,3 A failure to rouse 
and respond appropriately to a life-threatening hypoxic 
event is considered to be a common final pathway.3–5
Skeletal muscle channelopathies are inherited neuro-
muscular disorders caused by variants in ion channel 
genes with an estimated prevalence around one in 
100 000.6 NaV1.4 is a skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium 
channel, encoded by the gene SCN4A, that is crucial for 
the generation of action potentials and excitation of 
muscle. Gain-of-function variants in NaV1.4 typically 
cause myotonia or periodic paralysis.7 An infantile 
myotonic phenotype characterised by severe respiratory 
compromise has been linked to such gain-of-function 
variants. Affected infants have brief, recurrent episodes 
of life-threatening respiratory muscle myotonia causing 
apnoea, hypoxia, and cyanosis.8–11 Intensive care and 
tracheostomy are often required.9 The onset of apnoea 
can be delayed by up to 10 months after birth, when 
infants are seemingly healthy (appendix p 3). Two deaths 
from respiratory complications have been reported.8,9
Loss-of-function variants in NaV1.4 have been reported 
in patients with congenital myasthenic synd 
rome and 
congenital myopathies.12–14 These patients had evidence of

Summary
Background Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the leading cause of post-neonatal infant death in high-income 
countries. Central respiratory system dysfunction seems to contribute to these deaths. Excitation that drives 
contraction of skeletal respiratory muscles is controlled by the sodium channel NaV1.4, which is encoded by the gene 
SCN4A. Variants in NaV1.4 that directly alter skeletal muscle excitability can cause myotonia, periodic paralysis, 
congenital myopathy, and myasthenic syndrome. SCN4A variants have also been found in infants with life-threatening 
apnoea and laryngospasm. We therefore hypothesised that rare, functionally disruptive SCN4A variants might be 
over-represented in infants who died from SIDS.
Methods We did a case-control study, including two consecutive cohorts that included 278 SIDS cases of European 
ancestry and 729 ethnically matched controls without a history of cardiovascular, respiratory, or neurological disease. 
We compared the frequency of rare variants in SCN4A between groups (minor allele frequency <0·00005 in the Exome 
Aggregation Consortium). We assessed biophysical characterisation of the variant channels using a heterologous 
expression system.
Findings Four (1·4%) of the 278 infants in the SIDS cohort had a rare functionally disruptive SCN4A variant compared 
with none (0%) of 729 ethnically matched controls (p=0·0057).
Interpretation Rare SCN4A variants that directly alter NaV1.4 function occur in infants who had died from SIDS. 
These variants are predicted to significantly alter muscle membrane excitability and compromise respiratory and 
laryngeal function. These findings indicate that dysfunction of muscle sodium channels is a potentially modifiable 
risk factor in a subset of infant sudden deaths.

respiratory compromise including sudden brief attacks 
of apnoea that required ventilator support.12
These fatal and life-threatening SCN4A respiratory 
phenotypes are compatible with the model of SIDS 
pathogenesis. We hypothesised that rare functionally 
deleterious SCN4A variants might be over-represented in 
infants who had died of SIDS.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did a case-control study, comparing infants who had 
died from SIDS with ethnically matched adult controls. 
We first utilised a small cohort of UK white European 
SIDS cases and then replicated our findings in a larger 
cohort of USA samples. We obtained fully anonymised 
exome data from all SIDS cases from an international 
exome sequencing collaboration. The cohort consisted of 
coroners’ cases from the UK and cases referred to coroners, 
medical examiners, or forensic pathologists from six 
ethnically and geographically diverse populations in the 
USA. We defined SIDS as the sudden death of a seemingly 
healthy infant that remained unexplained despite a 
thorough investigation of the scene and circumstances of 
death, a comprehensive post-mortem examination includ-
ing microbiology and histopathology performed by a 
pathologist or medical examiner with paediatric training, 
and a multiprofessional review of the available infor-
mation.15,16 The control cohort comprised exome sequenc-
ing data from adults of European ancestry without a 
history of cardiac, neurological, or respiratory phenotypes 
reported to the same international collaboration as the 
cases, with no further inclusion or exclusion criteria. 
Genetic studies were undertaken on anonymised 
samples as approved by the National Research Ethics 
Service—Wandsworth (reference: 10-H0803-73) and the 
Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board.
Procedures
Whole exome sequencing for both cases and controls 
was done using 1·5–3 µg of genomic DNA. Samples 
from the UK were sequenced at King’s College London 
using the Sure Select XT Human All Exon v5 Target 
Enrichment System (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA); samples 
from the USA were sequenced at the Mayo Clinic with 
the Sure Select XT Human All Exon + UTR v5 Target 
Enrichment System (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). DNA 
libraries were prepared according to manufacturer’s 
protocols. 100 base pair paired end sequencing was 
performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform.
Sequencing reads from exome sequencing of cases and 
controls were aligned to the GRCh37 human reference 
genome using NovoAlign. Variant calling, multi-sample 
genotyping, and variant quality recalibration was done 
with GATK. Coverage across the protein-coding regions 
of the exome and SCN4A specifically were assessed using 
the Bedtools package. A set of 3847 common variants 
located outside of regions of the genome where there is 
extensive linkage disequili 
brium17 were used to estimate 
relatedness within the study cohort and ethnic ancestry 
alongside the control group using the King software 
package.18 Cases and controls that clustered closely with 
individuals from the Caucasian European population 
from the 1000 Genomes Project were included in the 
downstream analysis to compare individuals from the 
same ethnic genetic background.
Variants identified within the SCN4A locus (chromo-
some 17: 62015914–62050278) were annotated with their 
predicted effect on the SCN4A transcript NM_000334.4 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden and 
unexpected death of an apparently healthy infant. It is the 
leading cause of post-neonatal infant death in high-income 
countries. Placing infants to sleep in a prone position is 
associated with a higher risk of sudden death but unidentified 
risk factors remain. We searched PubMed for papers published 
in English up to March 1, 2017, reviewing the cause or risk of 
SIDS using the terms “sudden infant death”, “SIDS”, “sudden 
unexpected death in infancy”, and “risk factors”. Multiple risk 
factors have been proposed on the basis of epidemiological, 
pathological, and genetic studies that include the notion of a 
vulnerable infantile period due to immature homoeostatic and 
autonomic regulatory pathways or genetic variation—eg, 
cardiac channel gene variants. Respiratory failure is ultimately 
believed to contribute to death. 
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this study is the first to consider direct 
failure of the respiratory muscles due to dysfunction of the 
skeletal muscle ion channel NaV1.4 in the pathogenesis of SIDS. 
We compared rare variants in the SCN4A gene, which codes for 
the NaV1.4 channel, among infants who had died of SIDS with 
variants from ethnically matched controls. We also studied the 
functional consequences of rare variants in both cases and 
controls using a heterologous cell system. Only infants who had 
died from SIDS carried variants that significantly disrupted 
channel function.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our data are compatible with the clinical features of SIDS and 
provides new mechanistic clues to death. Developmental 
regulation of the sodium channel and respiratory muscle fibre 
types might affect the risk of SIDS. Future research is required 
to define this relationship, and our findings should be 
retested in similar and other ethnic groups. Sodium channel 
dysfunction found in muscle channelopathies can be treated. 
Studies should assess whether such treatments could 
ameliorate the risk of sudden death for infants carrying 
SCN4A gene variants.

(GenBank) and allele frequencies derived from the Exome 
Aggregation Consortium. The analysis focused on 
predicted protein-altering alleles that were novel or with 
an allele frequency less than 0·00005. Variants were 
confirmed by Sanger sequencing using methods 
previously described.19 We assessed the effect of intronic 
variants on splicing using Human Splicing Finder.20 
For mutagenesis and in-vitro transcription, we used 
the human SCN4A expression clone, pRc/CMV-
hSkM1,21,22 based on accession M81758.1, which we have 
previously used for functional expression.14,23,24 Site-
directed mutagenesis was done with the QuikChange kit 
(Agilent) and confirmed by sequencing the entire insert.
All identified rare SCN4A mis-sense variants were 
characterised by patch clamp heterologous expression 
studies to evaluate the consequence on NaV1.4 channel 
activity. Functional properties of mutant NaV1.4 channels 
in expression systems show excellent correlation with 
predicted changes in excitability of native cells and the 
clinical phenotype of the patient carrying the variant.7,12–14,25 
We assessed expression in HEK293 cells, which do not 
express endogenous sodium channels.14,26 The cells were 
incubated in a 1·9 cm² well with transfection mixture 
consisting of 0·5 μg of wild type or mutant human 
SCN4A plasmid, 50 ng of plasmid coding for copGFP, 
1·5 μl Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher) in 100 μL of 
Opti-MEM (ThermoFisher) for 16–24 h. Wild type SCN4A 
plasmid was included in every set of transfections to 
control for transfection efficacy. Two independent DNA 
preparations were used for the Glu1520Lys variant to 
control for the effect of the quality of the preparation on 
reduced expression levels.
For whole cell patch clamping, HEK293 cells with 
green fluorescence were voltage clamped at room 
temperature 48–72 h after transfection using an 
Axopatch 200B Amplifier (Axon Instruments), NI-6221 
(National Instruments), or Digidata 1440B digitiser and 
pClamp software (Axon Instruments). Holding voltage 
was –80 mV. The current–voltage and conductance–
voltage relationships were fitted with the Boltzmann 
equation to estimate the midpoint and the slope factor of 
the voltage dependence:
where G is electrical conductance, I is current, A is the 
maximum amplitude, B is the minimum amplitude, V1/2 
(voltage of half-maximal activation or inactivation) is the 
voltage where amplitude is
and Vslope is the slope factor. The time constant of recovery 
from inactivation (τrecovery) and of onset of fast inacti-
vation (τinactivation) were derived by fitting single or double 
exponential functions, respectively, to the timecourse 
data. We analysed only the fast component (routinely 
>95% of the total amplitude) of the double exponential 
function. The series resistance error was kept below 5 mV.
We compared the number of ultra-rare and functionally 
deleterious SCN4A gene variants between cases and 
controls using a one-tailed Fisher’s Exact test. We used 
Kruskal–Wallis rank sum test with Dunn’s pairwise 
multiple comparisons or a one-way ANOVA with Games-
Howell’s post-hoc test to compare the mean of each 
variant against the wild-type mean. We used a Bonferroni 
correction to correct for multiple comparisons across 
all parameters. 
We analysed the data using pClamp, Microsoft Excel, 
Origin, Prism, and SPSS 24 software.

Results
We obtained exome data from 427 SIDS cases (95 from 
the UK and 332 from the USA) and 729 controls. After 
sequence alignment, seven cases were excluded from 
further analysis because less than 75% of the Gencode-
defined protein-coding exome was covered by fewer than 
20 reads. One further case from a half-sibling pair 
was excluded from downstream analysis. 141 cases 
were not white European and were removed from the 
final analysis. A total of 278 cases (84 from the UK, 
194 from the USA) and 729 controls were included in 
the downstream analysis.
More than 81% of the DNA sequences comprising the 
protein coding regions and associated splice sites of the 
SCN4A gene were covered by at least 20 reads in each 
individual in the study cohort and more than 90% were 
covered by at least ten reads (appendix p 5). We identified 
rare alleles in the SCN4A gene in six (2%) of 278 infants 
of white European descent who died of SIDS and in 
nine (1%) of 729 ethnically matched controls (p=0·21, 
one tailed Fisher’s Exact test; table 1, figure 1). One of the 
NaV1.4 variants present in an infant who died from SIDS 
(Arg1463Ser) was also recorded in the UK national 
skeletal muscle channelopathy database in an adult 
patient with myotonia.
Using our whole exome sequencing data, we also 
determined whether any of the six SIDS cases with a rare 
SCN4A variant carried a rare variant in any of 90 genes 
associated with inherited cardiac condition including 
those associated with SIDS (appendix pp 8–9). Only 
one such participant did (with variant Ser682Trp in 
SCN4A). In addition to the SCN4A variant, this individual 
had variants in SCN5A (Gly333Arg) and in NEXN 
(Met38Thr).

Heterologous expression studies showed that four of the 
six variants in infants who died of SIDS, but none of the 
coding variants in controls, disrupted SCN4A function. 
The voltage dependence of activation for each of the 
identified alleles was not significantly different from the 
wild type allele except for a small increase in slope factor 
(VSlope) for variant Ser682Trp (figure 2D, 2E, table 2). 
However, the current density in response to a voltage step 
to 0 mV was significantly reduced for two of the six variants 
identified in the case cohort (Glu1520Lys, Arg1463Ser; 
figure 2A, 2B) and none in controls (figure 2C). In addition, 
the Arg1463Ser variant showed a shift in the voltage of half-
maximal fast inactivation to + 3·6 mV (figure 3A, 3B, 
table 2) and the recovery from inactivation was almost 
three-times faster than in the wild type channel (figure 3D, 
3E, table 2). Furthermore, fast inactivation of Val1442Met 
was enhanced as the voltage of half-maximal inactivation 
was 6·6 mV lower in the variant than in wild type 
and recovery from inactivation was 1·5 times slower 
(figure 3A, 3B, table 2). The time course of open state 
inactivation was significantly slower for the Ser682Trp 
variant at 0 mV (figure 3G–I, table 2). Voltage dependence 
of inactivation (figure 3C), time constant of recovery from 
inactivation (figure 3F), and the time constant of 
inactivation (table 2) of the variants in control cohort did 
not differ significantly from wild type. The intron variant 
in the control cohort was predicted to have no effect on 
splicing (Human Splicing Finder).
We initially tested our hypothesis in a UK cohort. Genetic 
data were available from 84 white Europeans. Of these UK 
cases, one carried a functional SCN4A variant, Arg1463Ser. 
This was an underpowered cohort but this positive finding 
warranted testing our hypothesis in a larger cohort. We 
then analysed genetic data in a second cohort that included 
194 DNA samples from cases of white European descent 
from the USA to assess whether our finding could be 
replicated. Three (1·5%) of 194 infants in this second 
cohort carried functional SCN4A variants, compared with 
none of 729 ethnically matched controls (p=0·009 Fisher’s 
exact test).
Taking the UK and US cohorts of 278 cases together, 
four of the six rare variants in the SIDS cohort had

the 729 ethnically matched controls (p=0·0057, Fisher’s 
exact test). Even if the intron variant in the control cohort 
is assumed to be deleterious, functional variants remain 
over-represented in the SIDS group (p=0·02).
Discussion
We identified rare SCN4A variants in both Caucasian 
European infants who died of SIDS and in living adult 
controls. We showed that rare variants that alter NaV1.4 
channel function in a similar fashion to known pathogenic 
SCN4A variants were over-represented in infants who had 
died of SIDS compared with ethnically matched controls.
Alterations in sodium channel function in SIDS 
are qualitatively similar to those reported in infants 
with life-threatening respiratory events.9,12,14 Both gain-of-
function and loss-of-function SCN4A variants can cause 
severe respiratory presentations in infancy and some of 
these cases have had a fatal outcome.8,9,14 In our study, only 
the SCN4A variants present in white SIDS cases caused 
significant alterations in channel function compared with 
wild type. By contrast, the variants we discovered in control 
adults did not alter channel function. The Arg1463Ser and 
Ser682Trp variants caused impaired fast inactivation that 
resulted in a predominantly gain-of-function effect in 
the NaV1.4 sodium channel. Similar gain-of-function 
alterations in channel function are the hallmark of SCN4A 
variants in patients with myotonia, including in infants 
with severe respiratory complications.25 The pathogenic 
role of Arg1463Ser is also supported by its presence in a 
patient under our care (EM, MGH) with generalised 
myotonia. The heterozygous loss-of-function variants we 
discovered in the SIDS cohort caused either substantial 
enhance 
ment of fast inactivation (Val1442Met) or reduced 
current density (Glu1520Lys). Compound heterozygous or 
homozygous loss-of-function NaV1.4 variants (includ-
ing the previously reported Val1442Met variant) cause 
myasthenic syndrome and congenital myopathy.12,14 Some 
of these patients need respiratory support.12,14 These 
observations support the notion that disrupted sodium 
channel function in the respiratory muscles can contribute 
to life-threatening events.
Developmental regulation of SCN4A expression and 
muscle fibre typing might define a period of SIDS 
vulnerability. The SIDS infants in our cohort would have 
appeared healthy and asymptomatic before death. We 
propose that the functionally deleterious variants we have 
identified can explain this apparent healthiness of infants 
and also represent a major risk factor for SIDS. The gain-
of-function change we observed in the infant with 
Arg1463Ser is consistent with previously reported SCN4A 
variants (appendix pp 1–4) that, after a period of apparent 
clinical normality, cause myotonia of the laryngeal and 
respiratory muscles precipitating an abrupt onset apnoeic 
crisis. For those with heterozygous loss-of-function 
variants (Val1442Met and Glu1520Lys) and the milder gain-
of-function variant (Ser682Trp), the level of channel

perturbation shown in our study might not be sufficient to 
cause respiratory failure but it could be a significant 
contributing factor. Baseline respiratory function could be 
normal but the presence of these variants might impair 
the ability of respiratory muscles to mount and maintain 
rapid and forceful contraction in response to hypoxia.4
Two developmental factors might combine with the 
functional effects of the SCN4A variants we identified to 
render respiratory muscles more susceptible to contractile 
failure—eg, in response to hypoxia. First, developmental 
alterations in skeletal muscle sodium channel expression: 
during embryogenesis two different sodium channel 
isoforms, the cardiac isoform NaV1.5 (encoded by SCN5A) 
and the skeletal muscle isoform NaV1.4 are expressed 
in skeletal muscle although NaV1.4 predominates. The 
expression of NaV1.5 progressively decreases over the first 
2 years after birth. The expression of NaV1.4 progressively 
increases after birth but the level before the age of 5 years 
is 25–40% of that seen in adulthood.27 The presence of 
NaV1.5 expression could compensate to some degree for 
variant-induced NaV1.4 dysfunction and to the delay in 
onset of symptoms reported in patients with myotonia 
who have NaV1.4 dysfunction.27
Low expression of NaV1.4 in infantile muscle is likely 
to be particularly crucial in fast twitch respiratory 
muscles28–30 because their ability to maintain the ampli-
tude of suc 
cessive action potentials when under increased 
demand—eg, in the presence of hypoxia—is dependent 
on the density of sodium channels.31,32 This suggestion is 
supported by the observation that the capacity of muscle 
fibres from NaV1.4 heterozygous null mice to generate 
sustained action potentials diminishes with repeated 
stimulation.33 The enhanced sodium channel inactivation 
we observed with the Val1442Met variant will reduce 
channel availability, which could be particularly detri-
mental during such high frequency stimulation.13
Second, developmental alterations in respiratory 
muscle fibre typing: the proportion of fast and slow 
twitch fibres in respiratory muscles is regulated develop-
mentally. Fast twitch fibres that rely more heavily on the 
density of sodium channels predominate in these 
muscles in infants, compared with those older than 
2 years of age.34
These developmental changes in sodium channel 
expression patterns and in muscle fibre type composition 
could define a period of vulnerability in early life when 
the respiratory and laryngeal muscles are particularly 
dependent on NaV1.4 channel function. Our data support 
the notion that the NaV1.4 dysfunction caused by the 
SCN4A variants will exacerbate this vulnerability.
Several related concurrent events are thought necessary 
for sudden infant death.35 A triple risk hypothesis36,37 
states that for death to occur there must be a conver-
gence of factors: a vulnerable infant, a critical period of 
development, and an external stressor. Our data suggest 
that the presence of an SCN4A gene variant that impairs

Figure 3: Fast inactivation properties of NaV1.4 variants
(A–C) Voltage dependence of fast inactivation. (A) Representative current traces in response to tail voltage step to –10 mV following 150 ms pre-pulse voltage steps ranging 
from –150 mV to 0 mV in 10 mV increments for wild type, Arg1463Ser, and Val1442Met variants. First 5 ms of the voltage step to –10 mV are shown. Current response 
following pre-pulse step to –60 mV is highlighted in red. The voltage protocol is shown to the right. Dashed lines indicate 0 current level. (B,C) The peak tail current 
amplitude at –10 mV is plotted against the pre-pulse voltage for variants in the SIDS cohort (B) and in controls (C). Individual data were normalised to maximum and 
minimum values of the Boltzmann equation and averaged. Voltage of half-maximal inactivation was shifted significantly to more hyperpolarised voltages for Val1442Met 
channels (red) and to more depolarised voltages for Arg1463Ser channels (blue). The solid lines represent the fit of Boltzmann equation to mean data for wild type, 
Val1442Met and Arg1463Ser channels. The data for the variants that did not differ from wild type channels are shown in grey. (D–F) Recovery rate from fast inactivation. 
(D) Representative current traces for wild type and Arg1463Ser channels illustrating the recovery from inactivation. Channels were inactivated by a 10 ms voltage step to 
0 mV and then stepped to recovery voltage of –80 mV for an increasing duration of time. A second voltage step to 0 mV was then applied to see how much the channels had 
recovered from fast inactivation. Only traces with 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 ms duration at recovery voltage of –80 mV are shown. The voltage protocol is shown to the right. 
(E,F) The peak current amplitude during the second step (P2) is divided by the peak current amplitude during the first voltage step (P1) and plotted against the duration of 
the recovery period at –80 mV. Data for variants in the SIDS cohort (E) and in controls (F) is colour coded as in (B) and (C). The solid lines represent fit of exponential function 
to the mean data. (G–I) Rate of fast inactivation. (G) Time constant (τ) of inactivation at voltages ranging from –20 mV to +20 mV for wild type (black) and Ser682Trp 
(magenta) channels. The voltage protocol was as in figure 2A. Only the time constant of the fast component that carries roughly 95% of the amplitude of the inactivating 
current is analysed. (H) Representative current traces at –20 mV to +20 mV for wild type (top) and Ser682Trp (bottom) channels, showing the slower inactivation of the 
Ser682Trp variant. (I) Overlay of mean normalised current traces for wild type (black) and Ser682Trp (magenta) channels in response to voltage step to 0 mV.

sodium channel function exacerbates an infant’s 
vulnerability. In addition, the notion of developmental 
regulation of respiratory muscle fibre types and muscle 
sodium channel expression may define a critical period 
of development when they are particularly vulnerable 
to respiratory stressors. Fasting-induced alterations in 
extracellular potassium that might occur during sleep 
could further exacerbate the deleterious gain-of-channel 
function effects. Our data are consistent with the notion 
that risk factors combine to increase the probability of 
SIDS occurring, but may not be the sole cause of death. 
This hypothesis concurs with the presence of some very 
rare variants with effects on NaV1.4 function in the 
Exome Aggregation Consortium database. If the SCN4A 
gene changes with an effect on channel function were 
individually or universally fatal, they would be unlikely to 
be present in living controls. Parallels can be made with 
studies of variants in SCN5A cardiac sodium channel 
and the β subunits of Nav1.5 in infants who die 
from SIDS.38,39 Functional variants in these genes can 
predispose patients to cardiac arrhythmia but they are 
also rarely found in the Exome Aggregation Consortium 
database, indicating that they contribute to the probability 
of death occurring but might not define it.40 One of our 
SIDS cases (Ser682Trp) did also carry ultra rare variants 
in the SCN5A (Gly333Arg) and NEXN (Met38Thr) 
cardiac genes. Although other variants in SCN5A have 
been linked to arrhythmia syndromes and SIDS, this 
specific variant has not been reported in either of 
these presentations and has not been functionally 
characterised. It occurs in an extracellular loop of the 
protein that is not a critical domain for protein function 
but the aminoacid is conserved across species.41 Variants 
in NEXN have been associated with inherited cardio-
myopathy42 but no link with the risk of SIDS has been 
established. The significance of these variants is therefore 
unknown. Our findings are the first direct evidence that 
a primary defect in skeletal muscle excitability might be a 
risk factor for SIDS.
Our study had several limitations. It was restricted to 
the examination of SCN4A variants in European white 
individuals. SIDS occurs in all ethnicities at varying rates 
and our study should be replicated in other ethnic 
groups. Because of the anonymity of our samples, little 
clinical data were available and other family members 
could not be tested. Our functional analyses were also 
restricted to effects on sodium channel gating properties 
in vitro.
Our data show that functionally disruptive SCN4A 
variants are over-represented in SIDS. We propose that 
such variants impair the ability of respiratory muscles to 
respond to hypoxia. The developmental regulation of 
sodium channel expression and skeletal muscle fibre 
type composition may be factors in the period of 
susceptibility. Although we have studied two cohorts, 
which together form one of the largest SIDS cohorts 
reported,43 replication in other cohorts is needed to 
evaluate the potential role of SCN4A variants as a risk 
factor in SIDS. In addition, prospective studies with 
direct family involvement will help to define the clinical 
correlation 
of 
in-vitro 
muscle 
sodium 
channel 
dysfunction with SIDS.
Sodium channel blockers can reduce the frequency and 
severity of myotonia in patients with gain-of-function 
NaV1.4 variants,44 including those with severe infantile 
myotonia who have life-threatening respiratory com-
promise (appendix pp 1–4).8,9 Furthermore, aceta 
zolamide, 
which may be effective in loss-of-function SCN4A 
channelopathies,12,45 has been reported to abolish attacks 
of respiratory and bulbar weakness in a patient with 
myasthenic syndrome associated with the Val1442Glu 
loss-of-function variant.12 These data suggest that drug 
treatment could reduce the risk of SCN4A variants in 
siblings of an index case, but this requires further detailed 
evaluation. In conclusion, our data suggest that SCN4A 
variants are a genetically and mechanistically plausible 
risk factor for SIDS.
