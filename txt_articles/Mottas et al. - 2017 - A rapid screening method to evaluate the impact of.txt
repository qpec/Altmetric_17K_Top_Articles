Nanotechnology is an emerging and highly promising field to develop new approaches for biomedical
applications. There is however at present an unmet need for a rapid and universal method to screen nano-
particles (NP) for immunocompatibility at early stages of their development. Indeed, although many types
of highly diverse NP are currently under investigation, their interaction with immune cells remains fairly
unpredictable. Macrophages which are professional phagocytic cells are believed to be among the first
cell types that take up NP, mediating inflammation and thus immunological responses. The present work
describes a highly reproducible screening method to study the NP interaction with macrophages. Three
essential questions are answered in parallel, in a single multiwell plate: Are the NP taken up by macro-
phages? Do the NP cause macrophage cell death? Do the NP induce inflammatory reactions? This assay
is proposed as a standardized screening protocol to obtain a rapid overview of the impact of different
types of NP on macrophages. Due to high reproducibility, this method also allows quality control assess-
ment for such aspects as immune-activating contaminants and batch-to-batch variability.
Introduction
Nanomedicine represents a rapidly developing field which
bears
high
promise
for
many
clinical
applications.1
Nanoparticles (NP) are defined as particulate objects from 1 to
100 nm in diameter with specific properties that cannot be
found in bulk materials.2 NP can be designed to possess
unique optical properties allowing novel imaging and diagno-
stic applications,3 or to serve as highly modular drug delivery
systems that target specific organs or cell populations within
the body, thus improving drug efficacy and at the same time
reducing unwanted side effects.4–7 It is even becoming poss-
ible to combine diagnostic and therapeutic characteristics in
engineered NP to yield promising theranostic tools.8 Because
NP themselves can have an impact on cell viability and func-
tion, it is critical to assess their biocompatibility early in the
development process. Indeed, even if NP are individually well
characterized with respect to many factors such as shape, size,
zeta potential, and colloidal stability, the outcome of their
interaction with cells (which also differ in type and function)
is difficult to predict.9 To rapidly and efficiently select appro-
priate NP for clinical applications, it is essential to develop
efficient screening methods to test their interactions with the
cell types that they will encounter in the organism.
Macrophages can be found in all tissues of the body, and
they are particularly abundant at sites that are in direct contact
with the environment such as lungs, skin, and gastrointestinal
mucosa, or in organs with important blood supply such as the
spleen, kidney and liver.10 The prime ability of macrophages is
the engulfment of microorganisms, damaged cells and other
particulate materials by phagocytosis.11,12 For these reasons,
macrophages are a critical cell type with respect to biomedical
NP applications, as they are considered to be one of the first
cell populations that are encountered by NP entering the
body.12 Through their phagocyte function, these cells mediate
clearance of NP from the body and thus modulate NP bioavail-
ability.13 In addition to their scavenger role, macrophages are
among the first cells to initiate an inflammatory immune
response. When they recognize specific microbial components
as a danger signal, macrophages rapidly produce proinflam-
matory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necro-
sis factor-α (TNF-α) in order to initiate a down-stream immune
response.10 If NP themselves are recognized as a danger
signal, or if traces of immune-activating substances are

 present in the NP preparation, macrophages may trigger an
immune response against the material.14 In addition, some
NP have been reported to affect viability of macrophages.15
This immunotoxicity may negatively affect the maintenance of
immunity against pathogens.
It is thus essential to characterize the modes of interaction
of macrophages with NP designed for biomedical purposes at
the early stages of their development. Indeed, such assays
should be performed for every NP batch before further bio-
logical testing, as there can be considerable variation between
individual NP preparations. Several studies have reported
investigation of NP–macrophage interactions,12,16–18 but the
experiments were generally performed in a serial manner,
requiring a high concentration of particles to assess all essen-
tial parameters in order to test the NP. One report described a
screening method to assess liposome interactions with macro-
phages using fluorescence microscopy to quantify uptake and
cell viability.19 However microscopy represents a challenge to
acquire and analyze all samples equally, and the assessment
of more than 3 parameters at the same time is unusual.20
Another group described how to screen NP cytotoxicity on
fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial cells.21 This method could
however not easily be applied to macrophages, as NP internal-
ization and immune activation were not considered. Taken
together, there is an unmet need for a standardized method to
assess the essential parameters of NP–macrophage inter-
actions rapidly and efficiently.
Here we present an automated screening assay by which NP
cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, and immune activating effects on
macrophages in vitro are characterized in a standardized
manner. These three essential aspects of NP–macrophage
interactions can be assessed in a single culture plate within a
24 h experiment. Since NP themselves may interfere with
different readouts,22,23 we proposed adequate controls in order
to ensure that NP interferences do not lead to an over- or
underestimation of the NP effects. Cost effectivity and high
reproducibility of the protocol make the screening method
attractive for identifying a lead candidate for biomedical pur-
poses, for quality control of each NP preparation and for the
detection of immune-activating contaminants.
Materials and methods
NP synthesis
Citrate-stabilized gold NP were synthesized as previously
reported.24 To enhance NP colloidal stability,25 the gold core
was coated with a polymer mixture comprising of polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA; Mowiol 3–85, Mw = 15 000 Da) (Calbiochem,
EMD bioscience, Inc. La Jolla, USA) and a vinylalcohol–vinyl-
amine copolymer (NH2PVA; M12, Mw = 240 000 Da) (Erkol S.A.,
Tarragona, Spain) as previously described for hetero-functiona-
lized AuNP.24 For this study, polymers were fluorescently
labeled with a Cyanine5 NHS dye (Cy5; Lumiprobe, Hannover,
Germany) via ester bond formation for the polyvinyl alcohol
polymer and the amide bond for the vinylalcohol–vinylamine
copolymer. For fluorescently-labeled AuNP the polymer mixture
was composed of 0.5 mg ml−1 of NH2PVA, 0.375 mg ml−1 of
NH2PVA-noCy5, 1.612 mg ml−1 PVA and 4.7 mg ml−1 PVA-
noCy5. For unlabeled AuNP the polymer mixture was com-
posed of 0.875 mg ml−1 NH2PVA-noCy5 and 6.3 mg ml−1 PVA-
noCy5. The following NP were analyzed: citrate-stabilized gold
NP (citrate AuNP) and polymer-coated NP with Cy5 labeling
(NH2PVA-AuNP). Polymer-coated NP without Cy5 labeling
(NH2PVA-AuNP-noCy5) were used only as control in the uptake
experiment (Fig. 2). Additional AuNP formulations were used
in order to validate the method (see the ESI†).
NP characterization and stability
All NP were characterized in terms of their optical properties,
size and zeta potential. Optical properties were characterized
using a UV–Vis spectrometer (Jasco Europe S.R.L., Milano,
Italy), where the spectra of NP were measured in water for
citrate AuNP and PBS for NH2PVA-AuNP and NH2PVA-AuNP-
noCy5. The size distribution of the Au core was determined by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a FEI Tecnai
Spirit (FTI) transmission electron microscope. The hydro-
dynamic radius was determined by dynamic light scattering
(DLS) (LS Instruments A.G., Fribourg, Switzerland) in de-
polarized
DLS
(DDLS)
mode.
DDLS
measurements
were
performed at an angle of 90° in water for citrate AuNP and in
PBS for NH2PVA-AuNP and NH2PVA-AuNP-noCy5. The zeta
potential
was
measured
using
a
ZetaSizer
(Brookhaven
Instruments Corporation, Holtsville, USA) in water for AuNP
and PBS for NH2PVA-AuNP and NH2PVA-AuNP-noCy5.
NP colloidal stability was assessed using UV-Vis and DDLS
for time resolved measurements over 24 h at 37 °C. The stabi-
lity of all three NP was tested in PBS and complete cell culture
medium (cDMEM) consisting of high glucose (4.5 g l−1)
Dulbecco’s
modified
Eagle’s
medium
(DMEM)
(Biowest,
Nuaillé, France) was supplemented with 1% glutamine (PAA
laboratories, Pashing, Austria), 1 nM sodium pyruvate, 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Biological Industries, Beit Ha’Emeq,
Israel) and 0.5% ciproxine (Bayer, Zürich, Switzerland).
Macrophage cell line and NP exposure
J774.1 macrophages (ATCC, Manassas, USA) were cultivated in
cDMEM at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Before each experiment, cells
were concentrated to 5 × 105 cells per mL before adding
100 μl per well (5 × 104 cells per well) in flat-bottom 96-well
plates (Corning, New York, USA). After overnight incubation,
medium was replaced by 50 μl fresh cDMEM. NP, polymers
and other test substances were added as indicated at 2× con-
centration in 50 μl cDMEM. For all NP, the final working con-
centration was 10 μg ml−1 gold (determined by UV-Vis at
400 nm), corresponding to approximately 1.8 × 1010 17 nm
gold particles per mL. For polymer controls (NH2PVA and
NH2PVA-noCy5), the working concentration corresponds to the
concentration of the polymer on the NP. As a positive control
for immune activation, J774.1 macrophages were cultured with
100 ng ml−1 lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Invivogen, Toulouse,
France). Staurosporine was used to induce apoptotic cell death

 (1 nM; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Louis, USA). To control NP inter-
ferences, the positive controls were tested in combination with
NP added after 23 h. After a 24 h incubation, supernatants
were
stored
at
−20
°C
for cytokine
quantification
and
100 μl per well PBS were added to the cells for light microscopy
and flow cytometry analysis. Please refer to the ESI† for a list
of required materials and instruments and to Fig. S1† for
further details on the 96-well plate organization.
Flow cytometry
For flow cytometry, J774.1 cells in PBS were gently detached by
pipetting and transferring to U-bottom 96-well plates for stain-
ing as described below. All parameters were assessed in one
96-well plate in a single measurement (Fig. S1†). Analysis was
performed with a MACSquant analyzer 10 using the chill
96-rack
(both
from
Miltenyi
Biotec,
Bergisch
Gladbach,
Germany). Every well was gently mixed automatically before
acquisition of 50 μl. Data in the FCS 3.1 format were analyzed
using the FlowJo software version 10.0.8r1 (FlowJo Analysis
software, Ashland, USA).
To measure viability, the cells were incubated with Pacific
Blue-labeled annexin V diluted, 1 : 100, in annexin V binding
buffer (both from Biolegend, San Diego, USA). After 30 min
incubation at room temperature protected from light, one
volume of annexin V binding buffer was added. Propidium
iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Louis, USA) diluted, 1 : 200,
in PBS was automatically added by using the MACSquant ana-
lyzer 10 just before mixing and acquisition. For quantifi-
cation of NP uptake, the proportion of Cy5-positive cells
within live cells (annexin V/PI double-negative population)
was determined.
To assess macrophage activation, the J774.1 cells were
stained with a Zombie Green fixable viability dye (Biolegend,
San Diego, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
After washing with flow cytometry buffer consisting of PBS
supplemented with 2 mM EDTA (Calbiochem, Darmstadt,
Germany) and 0.5% BSA (PAA laboratories, Pashing, Austria),
the cells were incubated with unlabeled anti-CD16/32 to block
Fc receptors (Biolegend, San Diego, USA). After 10 min at 4 °C,
specific antibodies for surface activation markers or their
respective isotype controls in flow cytometry buffer were
added:
Pacific
Blue-CD80,
PE-CD86,
PE/Cy7-CD11b
and
APC/Cy7-MHCII (all from Biolegend, San Diego, USA). After
further 30 min at 4 °C, the cells were washed once with flow
cytometry buffer before acquisition.
Bright field imaging
The live cell morphology and density were pictured by bright field
microscopy (CKX53, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at 10× magnification.
ELISA
To quantify cytokine secretion, ELISA Max Deluxe sets for
mouse interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)
(both from Biolegend, San Diego, USA) were used according to
the manufacturer’s protocol in half-well plates. Absorbance
was measured at 450 nm with an Infinite 200 PRO plate-reader
(TECAN, Männedorf, Switzerland) where the reference absor-
bance at 570 nm was subtracted. Cytokine concentrations were
calculated according to the standard curve performed in
duplicate.
Statistical analysis
Graphs were plotted with the GraphPad Prism software
version 6.0e (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA). The stat-
istical significance of multiple groups in comparison to the
control group (untreated sample) was assessed using one-way
ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. An
unpaired t-test was used in Fig. 4 to compare two groups. For all
experiments with the J774.1 cells, graphs show the mean and
error bars indicate the standard error of the mean (SEM) of four
or five independent experiments performed on different days.
Results
This rapid method presented herein to test NP–macrophage
interactions and cellular responses is based on a multi-para-
meter analysis using a macrophage cell line. After exposure of
macrophages to NP in a 96-well cell culture plate, the cells
were analyzed by flow cytometry and bright field microscopy,
whereas supernatants were collected for ELISA quantification
of cytokines. This strategy allows to determine several crucial
aspects of interactions between NP and macrophages in paral-
lel from a single culture plate (Scheme 1): NP-related cyto-
toxicity (1), cellular uptake of NP (2), and proinflammatory
activation (3).
NP characterization and stability
To illustrate the multi-parameter screening method for NP–
macrophage interactions, we chose to use polymer-coated gold
particles (AuNP) as model NP. AuNP possess several advan-
tages which make them promising candidates for biomedical
applications, including tunable sizes, the possibility of surface
functionalization, optical properties that enable their detec-
tion, and low toxicity.26 We selected hetero-functionalized
NH2PVA-AuNP as a model for the assay, as we have previously
shown that these NP are best taken up among the formu-
lations tested.24 Citrate-stabilized AuNP were coated with the
vinylalcohol–vinylamine copolymer/polyvinyl alcohol polymer
mixture through ligand exchange as described.24 In order to
assess NP uptake by macrophages, the first polymer layer was
labeled with the Cy5 fluorescent dye (NH2PVA-AuNP). NP with
unlabeled polymers were used as a control (NH2PVA-AuNP-
noCy5). Cy5 (650/670), a far red dye, was selected to limit
potential
fluorescence
interferences
with
the
gold
core
(Fig. 1B). All AuNP were thoroughly characterized by conven-
tional methods: TEM (gold core size distribution), UV-Vis (par-
ticle size and concentration), DDLS (hydrodynamic size), and
zeta potential (Fig. 1). DDLS was preferred to characterize the
particle size (hydrodynamic radius), as it was previously shown
to have an advantage over conventional dynamic light scatter-
ing (DLS) for measurements in a complex fluid such as cell

 culture medium.27 NP stability in complete macrophage
culture
medium
(cDMEM)
was
determined
after
24
h
incubation at 37 °C by start/end point UV-Vis measurements
and time resolved DDLS (Fig. 2). Although citrate AuNP do not
preserve colloidal stability in PBS (data not shown),27 these
particles were stable in cDMEM, probably due to protein
corona
formation.28,29
Both
NH2PVA-AuNP-noCy5
and
NH2PVA-AuNP were stable in cDMEM over 24 h.
Impact of NP on macrophage viability
As a cellular model, we used the well-described J774.1 murine
macrophage cell line, which possesses many of the defining
Scheme 1
Parameters measured by NP screening assay. J774.1 macrophages are exposed to NP for 24 h. Three effects of NP–macrophage inter-
actions are measured in parallel. (1) Cytotoxicity is assessed by bright field microscopy and measured by flow cytometry with annexin V and
propidium iodide (PI) staining. (2) Uptake of fluorescently-labeled NP by macrophages is determined by flow cytometry. (3) The immune activation
phenotype is determined by flow cytometry measurement of cell surface activation markers (MHC II, CD80, CD86, CD11b) and by quantification of
proinflammatory cytokines in the supernatant (IL-6, TNF-α).

 characteristics of macrophages. To examine macrophage viabi-
lity, morphology and confluency, the J774.1 cells were visually
assessed by bright field microscopy after a 24 h culture
(Fig. 3A). Staurosporine, which induces apoptotic cell death,
strongly
reduced
the
proportion
of
round
live
cells.
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is a bacterially derived endo-
toxin used as a positive proinflammatory control, promoted
adhesion and spreading of cells, inducing the typical mor-
phology of immune-activated macrophages (arrows).30 In con-
trast, exposure to citrate AuNP, the NH2PVA polymer or
NH2PVA-AuNP did not induce any change in morphology, with
cells remaining small and round. Some material aggregates
(arrows) were seen with NH2PVA polymer exposure.
Two major mechanisms of cell death can be distinguished,
apoptosis and necrosis. Whereas apoptotic cell death does not
generally promote inflammation, necrotic cell death leads to
the disruption of the cell membrane and release of pro-
inflammatory substances. To investigate whether AuNP induced
cell death is by one of these mechanisms, macrophages were
assessed by flow cytometry after staining with annexin V and
propidium iodide (PI). Annexin V detects the presence of phos-
phatidylserine on the outer layer of the membrane bilayer, an
early sign of apoptosis, whereas PI intercalates into DNA when
the cell membrane is disrupted.31 This staining allows easy
discrimination between live, apoptotic and dead cells (Fig. 3B,
top left). The untreated J774.1 cells show approximately 60%
live cells under these conditions, as this is a cell line with a
high proliferation rate and turnover. Our results showed that
citrate AuNP, the NH2PVA polymer and NH2PVA-AuNP did not
decrease the proportion of live cells after a 24 h exposure, in
contrast to staurosporine (Fig. 3B and C). The NH2PVA
polymer and
NH2PVA-AuNP
did
increase
the
proportion
of AnnexinV−/PI+ dead cells, although not significantly,
suggesting that the polymer may promote necrotic cell death
at higher concentrations (Fig. S2†). Since the NP themselves
could in principle interfere with the measurements (the gold
core could for instance affect the PI fluorescence signal with a
maximal emission at 538 nm), it was necessary to verify that
the materials did not affect the fluorescence signals of annexin
V or PI. To verify this point, macrophages were incubated for
24 h with staurosporine. For the last hour before assessment
by
flow
cytometry,
AuNP,
the
NH2PVA
polymer
or
NH2PVA-AuNP were added to the staurosporine-treated cells.
Our results showed that none of these conditions interfere
with the annexin V/PI staining, as there was no difference in
macrophage viability compared to the cells incubated only
with staurosporine (Fig. 3C, right panel). We chose to use flow
cytometry rather than a metabolic assay such as the 3-(4,5-di-
methylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5
diphenyltetrazolium
(MTT)
test
to
assess cell viability, because this technique allows a multi-
parametric readout. In addition, some NP have been described
to absorb the MTT reagent32 or to interfere directly with colori-
metric reading,33 and the MTT assay does not directly measure
cell counts but rather depends on mitochondrial enzymatic
activity. In the case where NP could affect mitochondrial
activity, the MTT reading would also be affected.34 Thus, we
confirmed
by
using
two
independent
methods
that
NH2PVA-AuNP do not affect macrophage viability.
Uptake of fluorescently labeled NP by macrophages
Macrophages are specialized in the uptake of particulate
materials such as tissue debris and certain pathogens.12 Since
uptake by macrophages critically modifies the pharmaco-
kinetics and biodistribution of the NP in the body,35 it is
essential to assess NP uptake by macrophages early in the
development process of any particles designed for biomedical
applications.

 Flow cytometry analysis detects morphological changes
proportionally to the size and granularity of the cell by forward
scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC), respectively. In conse-
quence, if NP are taken up, the SSC intensity may increase.36–38
However our data show no significant SSC shift when com-
paring NP-treated cells with untreated cells (Fig. 4A). As the
cell size and granularity change when cells are dying,39 this
technique requires the exclusion of dying cells before the
uptake analysis. Therefore, we first gated on live (annexin V/PI
double-negative) cells.
A
more
sensitive
strategy
to
determine
whether
NH2PVA-AuNP are taken up by macrophages is to use the fluo-
rescently labeled NP. The J774.1 cells were exposed for 24 h at
37 °C to NH2PVA-AuNP labeled with Cy5 and fluorescence
intensity was then quantified by flow cytometry. Macrophages
incubated with Cy5-labeled NH2PVA-AuNP or with the Cy5-
labeled NH2PVA polymer alone showed higher fluorescence
than non-exposed macrophages (Fig. 4B, left panel). Indeed, at
least 80% of the macrophages exposed to NH2PVA-AuNP were
Cy5-positive (Fig. 4C, left panel). To determine whether the NP
were actively taken up by the cells, incubation was also per-
formed at 4 °C, a temperature at which many active processes
are inhibited. At 4 °C, the percentage of Cy5-positive cells
dropped significantly to approximately 40% for cells exposed
to NH2PVA-AuNP (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the NP are taken up
at least in part by an active process. The Cy5-positive macro-
phages exposed to NP at 4 °C may be decorated with NP on
their surface, as this would not require an active uptake.
To verify that the NH2PVA polymer and the NP themselves
do not affect the detection of the Cy5 fluorescent signal, we
incubated
macrophages
with
the
NH2PVA
polymer
or
NH2PVA-AuNP without Cy5 at 37 °C and 4 °C (Fig. 4A and B,
right panels). No increase in fluorescence was seen, indicating
that the NH2PVA polymer and NH2PVA-AuNP do not affect Cy5
detection by flow cytometry.
Production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages
after NP exposure
In addition to cytotoxicity and cellular uptake, it is essential to
assess
NP-induced
immune
activation
on
macrophages.
Indeed, compounds used during NP synthesis often contain
trace contaminations of immune-activating substances that
can lead to important inflammatory reactions. LPS, an endo-
toxin present on Gram-negative bacteria, is a frequent con-
taminant that can induce strong proinflammatory responses
even at picogram concentrations in humans.40
As J774.1 macrophages show high sensitivity to LPS and
other pathogen contaminants,41 we propose to use these cells
as a highly reactive and cost-limiting strategy to detect
immune-activating contaminations. The activation of macro-
phages leads to the secretion of several proinflammatory cyto-
kines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α), which represent the first step towards a generalized
inflammatory response. We quantified cytokine concentration
by ELISA in the culture supernatant from the same wells of
NP-exposed macrophages used for flow cytometry. After 24 h
of
exposure
to
citrate
AuNP,
the
NH2PVA
polymer
or
NH2PVA-AuNP, none of these conditions induced either IL-6 or
TNF-α (Fig. 5, left panels). LPS was used as a positive control

 and for all cytokines a significant increase compared to the
untreated control was observed.
To verify that the NP themselves did not interfere with the
ELISA assay, the J774.1 cells were exposed to LPS for 24 h to
induce proinflammatory cytokines and citrate AuNP, the
NH2PVA polymer or NH2PVA-AuNP were added only for the last
hour of incubation, a time frame which was sufficient for NP
uptake (Fig. S3†). Although the cytokine concentration was
expected to be the same under all conditions, a lower absor-
bance was measured by ELISA under the conditions with NP
or the polymer (Fig. 5, right panels), suggesting that both
materials interfere with the assay at the concentrations used.
The lower signal intensity could be due to cytokine adsorption
to the material surface.
Immune activation phenotype of macrophages after NP
exposure
To verify the NP-induced activation of macrophages by a
second readout, we examined whether NH2PVA-AuNP caused a
switch from a naïve to an activated phenotype of the J774.1
cells. Upon immune activation, the cell surface markers of
macrophages change to enhance their interactions with other
immune cells. We therefore analyzed the up-regulation of key
surface activation markers such as major histocompatibility
complex class II (MHC II) molecules, that mediate antigen
presentation to T cells; CD80 and CD86, two co-stimulatory
molecules that support efficient T-cell activation; CD11b a
leukocyte integrin associated with migration and adhesion
that is essential in inflammation.42 Citrate AuNP, the NH2PVA
polymer and NH2PVA-AuNP did not induce up-regulation of
any of the tested activation markers on the J774.1 cells, in con-
trast to the immune activator LPS (Fig. 6, left panels). To
control NP interference, we incubated the macrophages with
LPS for 24 h to induce the up-regulation of these typical acti-
vation
markers.
Citrate
AuNP,
the
NH2PVA
polymer
or
NH2PVA-AuNP were added for the last hour before assessment
by flow cytometry, in order to determine if the materials
reduce the fluorescence signal of the labeled antibodies. Our
results showed that neither the NP nor the polymer signifi-
cantly modified the fluorescence signal compared to LPS alone

the specificity of the signal increase in LPS-treated macro-
phages. The median fluorescence intensity (MFI) for isotype

Discussion
Interest in NP use for biomedical applications is growing and
there is an urgent need for reliable, rapid and universal
methods to characterize NP interactions with immune cells.
Herein we propose a rapid multi-parameter test to screen the
NP impact on macrophages within one experimental day. We
suggest flow cytometry as a standard method to investigate the
proinflammatory potential of NP using a macrophage cell line,
since it is an automated technique to quantify several para-
meters simultaneously, including cytotoxicity, NP uptake and
proinflammatory-activating effects. The samples are measured
on only one culture plate, thus allowing economical use of NP
and reagents. We have shown exemplary results with polymer-
coated heterofunctionalized AuNP as a model, but this assay
can be run with many different types of engineered nano-
materials, as shown in Fig. S4† with differently functionalized
AuNP. In our laboratory we have also implemented this test for
the screening of protein-based NP, poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid
(PLGA) NP, silica NP and micelles in order to select leading
candidates between different synthesis strategies.
As a macrophage model, we used the widely investigated
J774.1 murine cell line, which possesses characteristic func-
tions of macrophages such as phagocytosis, antigen proces-
sing, cytokine production, and many of the surface markers.43
We found the data obtained with this cell line to be highly
reproducible, allowing direct comparison of results even when
tested on different days. MSC-2, a myeloid suppressor cell line,
can also be used to run the screening assay (Fig. S4†), as can
primary cells generated from animal or human samples.
Indeed, the results obtained with this screening protocol for
NH2PVA-AuNP in J774.1 macrophages mirror data obtained
previously for these NP in primary human immune cells.44 In
any case, the first validation of NP using a cell line limits the
number of experimental animals needed for further character-
ization and avoids the loss of human samples.
For a step-by-step overview of the interpretation of the data
from the screening assay, we propose a flow chart that sum-
marizes the key points of this process (Fig. 7). Because NP–
macrophage interactions are dependent on
particle pro-
perties,45 the physico-chemical characterization of the panel of
NP, including size, shape, charge, and colloidal stability also
in the cell culture medium in which the cells are grown, is
required before exposure. The working concentration for the
screening protocol
should be
selected
according to
the
planned biomedical application and based on the expected
concentration in the organism.46,47 In addition, the working
concentration should not lead to NP agglomeration.22 For
NH2PVA-AuNP, a potential application is the delivery of
immunoactive drugs. We thus selected a working concen-
tration (10 μg ml−1 of AuNP) that would be higher than the
concentration needed to deliver an effective dose of the drug.
At this dose, the NP demonstrated colloidal stability in media.
As a first step, the screening protocol rapidly assesses
potential cytotoxicity. This step allows the selection of the can-
didates inducing the least cell death within a panel of NP. It
also allows rapid screening of NP during the development
process and may alert the necessity of design modifications if
evident cytotoxicity is detected. As a second step, cellular
uptake by macrophages is measured. In general, because

bated for 24 h at 37 °C with NP, the NH2PVA polymer or LPS.
Interference controls (right panels): macrophages were incubated for
24 h at 37 °C with LPS (100 ng ml−1). NP or the NH2PVA polymer were
added for the last hour of incubation. IL-6 and TNF-α were quantified in
culture supernatants by ELISA. Each bar represents mean ± SEM
of 5 independent experiments performed at least in duplicate. Asterisks

 macrophages lead to NP clearance, a low uptake is desirable
and the NP candidates should be selected accordingly. Low
capture by macrophages will result in low NP clearance, allow-
ing them more time to reach their target cells in the body.43
One widely used coating for NP which considerably reduces
their uptake by macrophages is polyethylene glycol (PEG).48 In
the previously established AuNP library in our laboratory,24 the
coating strategies strongly modify the uptake of 17 nm gold core
NP by macrophages.19 For instance PEG-coated AuNP showed a
lower uptake than PVA-coated NP, and carboxyl-functionali-
zation resulted in a lower uptake than amino-functionalization.
For specific applications with the aim to stimulate or to inhibit

SEM of at least 3 independent experiments. Asterisks (*, P < 0.05; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001) indicate significant differences with the untreated

 an immune response, macrophages may be themselves the
target of the NP, in which case the selection of NP with high
cellular uptake may be appropriate.49,50
As third step of the screening assay, the NP immune effects
are determined by two parameters: the concentration of cyto-
kines in the culture supernatant and the expression of typical
markers on the surface of activated macrophages. Cytokines
will diffuse rapidly in the body to initiate a generalized
immune response, whereas surface markers are important for
local cell-to-cell interactions. Except in specific applications
where immune activation is desired, such as in vaccination
strategies, the NP that do not induce immunostimulation
should be selected in order to avoid unwanted proinflamma-
tory effects in the organism.49 Any detected immunostimulat-
ing effect may be caused by the NP themselves, in which case
the design of the particle may need to be adjusted. On the
other hand, the observed immunoactivation may originate
from
immuno-contaminants
introduced
during
synthesis.
This may be verified using a further test, the limulus amebo-
cyte lysate (LAL) assay,51,52 which is used as a gold standard to
test
for
endotoxin
contaminants.
If
contaminations
are
detected, the conventional depyrogenation processes are often
not suitable for NP,53 so that the NP synthesis process may
need to be revisited.
Finally, because NP are well known to interfere with
different aspects of biological assays33,34 and because this may
lead to incorrect interpretation of the NP impact on macro-
phages, the screening protocol includes essential interference
controls at all steps. If interferences are detected during one of
the steps of the test, a complementary assay relying on a
different detection method should be considered. In this
report, we noted that both the AuNP and the polymer decrease
the ELISA absorbance reading at 450 nm in the interference
control for IL-6 and TNF-α (Fig. 5). However, other types of NP
will not necessarily cause these interferences. We found it un-
likely that the gold core directly interferes with the absorbance
reading or the enzyme activity,26 because the polymer alone
also reduced the signal. The lower signal intensity is thus
probably due to cytokine adsorption to the material surface.
To verify IL-6 and TNF-α production by alternative methods,
intracellular cytokines could be assessed with flow cytometry,
or cytokine mRNA levels could be measured by quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).54
The one-plate screening assay presented here is designed to
give a rapid overview of the different aspects of NP–macrophage
interactions. For a more detailed investigation of specific find-
ings, we present a list of possible assays (Table 1). For instance,
several methods are available to further characterize the mecha-
nisms of toxicity (reviewed in ref. 15, 22, 47 and 55). For the
assessment of NP uptake, the flow cytometry technique used in
the screening protocol requires fluorescent labeling of the NP.
In general, it cannot be excluded that the dye may affect NP
uptake,24 or that the fluorophore could detach from the core, or
that fluorescence may be quenched by the NP, as has been
shown for AuNP.56 After the initial screening, we therefore
suggest to confirm the uptake for selected NP candidates by
using a second method adapted to the type of NP used (for
instance, inductively coupled optical emission spectrometry

dated for deeper investigations.

 (ICP-OES) may be used to quantify gold uptake24). To determine
in which cell compartment the NP accumulate, a standard tech-
nique is to use confocal microscopy and cells labeled with dyes
that allow visualization of organelles, such as the endosomes
and lysosomes.57 To determine which is the main mechanism
of uptake,11 pharmaceutical and genetic inhibitors of phago-
cytosis can be employed.58
In conclusion, we present a one-plate automated screening
protocol for the rapid selection of potential NP candidates for
biomedical
applications,
based
on
their
impact
on
J774.1 macrophages. The protocol presented herein can fur-
thermore be easily adapted to screen the impact of NP on
other cells of interest such as endothelial cell lines, human
cell lines or even primary cells, allowing for additional
versatility.
