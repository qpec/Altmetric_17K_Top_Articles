prostate cancer? A systematic review and
meta–analysis

Abstract
Background: Research on a possible causal association between alcohol consumption and risk of prostate cancer is
inconclusive. Recent studies on associations between alcohol consumption and other health outcomes suggest
these are influenced by drinker misclassification errors and other study quality characteristics. The influence of these
factors on estimates of the relationship between alcohol consumption and prostate cancer has not been previously
investigated.
Methods: PubMed and Web of Science searches were made for case–control and cohort studies of alcohol
consumption and prostate cancer morbidity and mortality (ICD–10: C61) up to December 2014. Studies were coded
for drinker misclassification errors, quality of alcohol measures, extent of control for confounding and other study
characteristics. Mixed models were used to estimate relative risk (RR) of morbidity or mortality from prostate cancer
due to alcohol consumption with study level controls for selection bias and confounding.
Results: A total of 340 studies were identified of which 27 satisfied inclusion criteria providing 126 estimates for
different alcohol exposures. Adjusted RR estimates indicated a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer among
low (RR = 1.08, P < 0.001), medium (RR = 1.07, P < 0.01), high (RR = 1.14, P < 0.001) and higher (RR = 1.18,
P < 0.001) volume drinkers compared to abstainers. There was a significant dose–response relationship for current
drinkers (Ptrend < 0.01). Studies free from misclassification errors produced the highest risk estimates for drinkers
versus abstainers in adjusted models (RR = 1.22, P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Our study finds, for the first time, a significant dose–response relationship between level of alcohol
intake and risk of prostate cancer starting with low volume consumption (>1.3, <24 g per day). This relationship is
stronger in the relatively few studies free of former drinker misclassification error. Given the high prevalence of
prostate cancer in the developed world, the public health implications of these findings are significant. Prostate
cancer may need to be incorporated into future estimates of the burden of disease alongside other cancers (e.g.
breast, oesophagus, colon, liver) and be integrated into public health strategies for reducing alcohol related disease.

 Background
Prostate cancer is the development of cancer in the
prostate, a walnut–sized gland in men that surrounds
the top of the urethra and which produces seminal fluid
[1]. Its growth and functions are controlled by male hor-
mones such as testosterone. Prostate cancer is the sec-
ond most common cancer in men worldwide. Around
1.1 million cases were recorded in 2012, accounting for
15% of all new cases of cancer in men [2]. It is most
commonly diagnosed in high–income countries, where
screening is common. It is the fifth most common cause
of cancer death in men worldwide. Therefore prostate
cancer as a chronic disease has become an important
public health concern.
The risk factors for prostate cancer that can be consid-
ered established include age, race/ethnicity and family
history [3]. Many observational studies have investigated
alcohol consumption as a risk factor for prostate cancer.
Conclusions from these studies and of reviews have been
conflicting with some finding increased risk of prostate
cancer [4–6], or decreased risk [7] and others finding no
relationship [8–13]. While many unidentified and un-
controlled factors or biases may have confounded the
relationships of interest in these studies, an additional
concern is that former and occasional drinkers may be
misclassified into the abstaining reference group. Previ-
ous studies have showed that such misclassification can
bias estimates of health risks from alcohol use, for
example, underestimating risks from low–volume drink-
ing [14–19]. Former and occasional drinkers may in-
clude
people
who
have
stopped
or
reduced
their
drinking as they aged and experienced declining health
[16, 20]. Thus including former and occasional drinkers
can bias the abstaining reference group towards reduced
health and by comparison, reduce estimated disease risk
from drinking.
Over the past few decades there have been several
reviews and meta–analyses conducted to examine the
association of prostate cancer with alcohol consumption
[7, 8, 13, 21–25]. Early reviews by Longnecker [13] and
Morton et al. [8] both concluded there was no relation-
ship. Breslow and Weed [24] reviewed 32 studies of
which only six reported significant associations between
risk of prostate cancer and alcohol consumption. Dennis
[22] conducted a meta–analysis on six cohort and 27
case–control
studies,
finding
no
overall
association
between prostate cancer and any alcohol consumption.
However, when they examined 15 studies in which the
relative risks (RR) for drinking levels were available, they
found that three or more drinks per day increased the
risk of prostate cancer. Dagnelie et al. (2004) [7]
reviewed nine studies on prostate cancer and total alco-
hol consumption and found that six studies reported no
association, two reported an increased risk and one a
decreased risk. A meta–analysis by Bagnardi et al. [25]
found a small but significantly increased risk for men
drinking more than 50 g/day of alcohol, with a slightly
higher risk for men consuming more than 100 g/day but
there was no significant dose–response relation. This
meta–analysis was the first to consider potential con-
founding, between–study variation and modifying effects
of tobacco smoking but did not control for drinker mis-
classification errors. A meta–analysis by Fillmore et al.
[21] found a significant relationship between prostate
cancer and heavy alcohol use after controlling for the
effects of median age of study populations, design and
between–study variation. Rota et al. [23] found a signifi-
cantly higher RR of prostate cancer for any drinking,
light (≤1 drink/day) and moderate drinking (>1, <4
drink/day) versus abstaining/occasional drinking but the
analysis found no significant relationship with heavy
drinking (≥4 drinks/day) and did not consider the poten-
tial effects of misclassification. In summary, more recent
reviews and meta–analyses have been more likely to find
positive associations but none have adequately considered
the effects of confounding and bias, including potential
biases caused by misclassification of former and occa-
sional drinkers in the abstainer reference groups.
The objectives of the present meta–analysis were: (i) to
investigate the relationship between prostate cancer and
alcohol consumption; and (ii) to examine whether esti-
mates of this relationship may have been biased by drinker
misclassification errors and other study characteristics.
Methods
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The criteria for inclusion were: (i) case–control and co-
hort studies evaluating the relationship between alcohol
consumption and prostate cancer; (ii) original articles
published in English up till December 2014; (iii) articles
that reported findings in odds ratio, hazard ratio, inci-
dence ratio or standardized mortality ratio; and (iv)
articles reporting at least three levels of alcohol con-
sumption with drinking amounts, including the refer-
ence level. Articles with no abstainer group or a lowest
drinking level greater than 0.33g/d were excluded.
Additionally, studies reporting total alcohol consump-
tion were included while studies based on consumption
of specific beverages only such as wine, whiskey, vodka,
sake or hard liquors were excluded. When the results of
the study were published more than once or if the same
dataset was used multiple times, only the most recent or
more complete data were included in analyses. The primary
outcomes of interest were mortality and/or morbidity from
prostate cancer (ICD–9: 185 or ICD–10: C61) [26].
While published and peer reviewed cohort or case–
control studies were included in the review, all other art-
icle types including narrative reviews, letters, editorials,

 commentaries, unpublished manuscripts, dissertations,
government reports, books and book chapters, confer-
ence proceedings, meeting abstracts, lectures and ad-
dress, and consensus development statement including
guideline statements, were excluded.
Search strategy
The systematic review follows the Preferred Reporting

(PRISMA) guidelines [27]. We identified all potentially
relevant articles by searching Pubmed and Web of
Science, through reference list cross–checking including
those of previous meta–analyses and incorporating pub-
lications up to 31 December 2014. Hand searches of
cited references in the selected articles, reviews and
meta–analysis published on the same topic were also
performed. The following MESH terms and text words
were used: (“prostatic neoplasms” OR (“prostate” AND
“neoplasms”) OR “prostate cancer “OR (“prostate” AND
“Cancer”)) AND (“alcohol” OR (alcohol drinking) OR
“alcohol consumption” OR “alcohol intake” OR (“alco-
hol” AND “consumption”)).
Study selection
Two reviewers trained and supervised by the PI read the
titles and/or abstracts of all the citations retrieved from
the electronic database searches and removed all cita-
tions that were clearly not related to studies of the
relationship between prostate cancer and alcohol con-
sumption.

review. Full–text articles were obtained for all abstracts
except for those that clearly did not meet eligibility
criteria. The investigators were consulted in the event of
any disagreement. Two of the investigators independ-
ently evaluated all studies selected for inclusion. The ini-
tial search identified a total of 340 studies of which 27
studies [4–6, 9, 11, 12, 28–48] satisfied the criteria for
the
meta–analysis
after
removing
313
records
for
reasons identified in Fig. 1.
Data extraction
Two reviewers independently reviewed all eligible papers
to extract and code data from all studies fulfilling the in-
clusion criteria, and any disagreements were resolved by
discussion with the investigators. Each study was coded
with reference to a standardized code–book (available
from authors on request) and under the supervision of
investigators. The coding of all variables in the meta–
dataset was double–checked by the first two authors.
The data to be extracted were: (1) outcome, mortality or
morbidity of prostate cancer; (2) measures of alcohol
consumption; (3) study characteristics; (4) types of mis-
classification error of alcohol measure; and (5) con-
trolled variables in individual studies.
A multitude of different approaches are used for asses-
sing
alcohol
consumption
in
this
literature
[49].
Problematic approaches include assessing some beverage
types and not others, assessing quantity consumed on a
drinking day but not frequency, assessing consumption
over very short time periods (e.g. two days) and
assessing frequency but not quantity of consumption.
We coded alcohol measurement as ‘adequate’ if both
quantity and frequency of consumption was assessed
for all alcoholic beverages and for a period of at least
one week.
The primary exposure variable was level of daily alco-
hol consumption in grams of ethanol assessed at base-
line and compared with a reference group of variously
defined “non–drinkers” or “abstainers”. When studies
did not define the grams of alcohol per unit or drink, we
used 8 g/unit for the UK; 10 g/drink for Australia,
Austria, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands,
New Zealand, Poland, Spain, Sweden; 11 g/drink for
Finland; 12 g/drink for Denmark, Germany, Italy, South
Africa and Switzerland; 13.45 g/drink for Canada; 14 g/
drink for US; 12.5 g/drink for China, 19.75 g/drink for
Japan and 12 g/drink for other countries [50, 51]. We
converted alcohol intake into grams per day using the
mid–points of reported categories to estimate mean
values. Following practice in other meta–analyses involv-
ing self–reported alcohol consumption, the open–ended
top categories (e.g. 6+ drinks/day) were coded by adding
three–quarters of the range of the next lowest category
to the lower bound (e.g. if 3 to 5 drinks this would be 6
+ (5–3)*0.75 = 7.5) [52]. It is necessary to make some
higher estimate than the lowest level possible for these
open–ended categories with no fixed upper level (e.g.,
7.5 in this case instead of 6 for 6+ drinks). We employed
predetermined definitions of “low–volume” drinking (up
to 20g ethanol per day) based on Australian NHMRC
low risk drinking guidelines [53]. This was operatio-
nalised as up to 24 g per day given that respondents
in the studies reported whole drinks or units rather
than grams i.e. 24g per day is closer to two than
three 10g standard drinks per day. All data extracted
from individual studies and analyzed during this study
can be found in Additional file 1.
Studies were classified according to the presence or
absence of two types of potential abstainer group bias:
(i) including former drinkers and/or (ii) including occa-
sional drinkers in the abstainer reference category.
Studies were coded as having former drinker bias if a)
results were not reported separately for former drinkers
and b) there was no mention of removing former
drinkers from the abstainer reference group. Following
Fillmore et al. [16], lifetime abstention was strictly
defined as zero consumption and did not include studies
with any level of occasional lifetime or past year

Page 3 of 13
 drinking (e.g. less than 12 drinks or “rarely” or “hardly
ever” drinking). Our rationale for this strict criterion was
that self–reported infrequent drinkers have been shown
to greatly underreport their personal consumption
[54, 55]. Studies were coded as having occasional
drinker bias if a) results were not reported separately
for occasional drinkers and b) frequency of drinking
was assessed for a “usual” period or over less than 30
days. The rationale here is that if a person reports
“usually” not drinking over the course of a month,
persons drinking less than monthly may still be occa-
sional
drinkers.
When
a
study
used
occasional
drinkers
as
the
reference
category
and
risk
for
abstainers was independently assessed, the risk values
were recalculated using the abstainer category as the
reference group [16].
Strategy for data analysis
Where studies only reported mortality or incidence
rates, these were converted to RR estimates [56]. Other-
wise hazard ratios in cohort studies and odds ratio
estimates
in
case–control
studies
were
entered
as
observations of the estimated risk relationships for
meta–analysis. When the odds ratios (OR as RR esti-
mates) are estimated using logistic regression models in
a case–control study, the OR tends to overestimate RR
when it is more than one and to underestimate RR when
it is less than one if the outcome becomes more frequent
[57]. Therefore, the formula below was used to correct
the adjusted OR and its 95% CIs obtained from logistic
regression in studies and derive an estimate of an associ-
ation that better represents the true RR [57].
RR ¼
OR
1−P0
ð
Þ þ P0 � OR
ð
Þ ;
where RR is relative risk, OR is odds ratio and P0 is the in-
cidence of outcome of interest in the non–exposed group.
Publication bias was assessed through visual inspection
of the funnel plot of log–RR of morbidity or mortality of
prostate cancer due to alcohol consumption against the
inverse standard error of log–RR [56] and Egger’s linear
regression method [58]. We plotted a forest graph to
examine how the RR estimate for any drinking in one
study is different from others [56]. We also assessed
between–study heterogeneity of RRs overall and by
drinking groups using Cochran’s Q [59] and the I2 statis-
tic [60]. As no heterogeneity was detected, fixed effects
models were used to obtain the summarized RR esti-
mates [56]. We also conducted sensitivity tests using
random effects models, but patterns of results were very
similar and are not reported here.
We used the fixed effects models to estimate the
weighted RRs of prostate cancer for any alcohol use and
by drinking groups while adjusting for the potential
effects of study–level covariates [56, 61–63]. Drinking
level in each study group was examined in terms of pre–
defined specific consumption levels. Drinking categories
were defined and reclassified as: (1) lifetime occasional
drinkers (0.02–0.33 g/day); (2) former drinkers now

 completely abstaining; (3) current occasional drinkers,
up to one drink per week (<1.30 g per day); (4) low vol-
ume drinkers, up to 2 drinks or 1.30–24 g per day; (5)
medium volume, up to 4 drinks or 25–44g per day; (6)
high volume drinkers, up to 6 drinks or 25–64g per day;
and (7) higher volume drinkers, 6 drinks or 65g or more
per day. All studies had an open–ended heavier drinking
group, i.e., with no upper limit of quantity consumed
per day for responses accepted as valid. We investigated
the dose–response relationship between the RR and
alcohol consumption for those who drank one drink
or more per week using the midpoint of each expos-
ure category using t-test in multivariate linear regres-
sion analysis [56].
We investigated the potential modification and con-
founding effects of study–level covariates using bivariate
analysis of RR of prostate cancer morbidity or mortality
and any alcohol consumption [64]. According to the
availability of the data from 27 included studies, the fol-
lowing study characteristics were investigated: (1) study
designs which included cohort study, population–based
case–control study and hospital–based case–control
study; (2) outcomes, i.e., morbidity or mortality of pros-
tate cancer; (3) adequacy of drinking measurement
method defined as whether both quantity and frequency
of total alcohol consumption was assessed for at least
one week; (4) mean or median age of individual study
populations at baseline; (5) year at baseline, if recruited
over a number of years then take midpoint; (6) whether
subjects with a history of cancer were excluded at base-
line or prior to randomization (yes, no or unknown); (7)
presence of misclassification errors, i.e., including both
former and occasional drinkers, only former drinkers,
only occasional drinkers or neither former nor occa-
sional drinkers in the abstaining reference group; (8)
whether or not the study and control for social status
(yes or no) using income or occupation measures; (9)
whether or not a study controlled for racial identity
or country of origin (yes or no); (10) whether or not
a study control for smoking status (yes or no); (11)
whether or not a study was conducted in US. We
made stratified RR estimates for studies with different
values for these characteristics and also examined the
differences in the RR estimates between these same
subgroups of studies [64].
The covariates above were selected for control in
multivariate regression analyses on empirical grounds
based on the P–value of bivariate tests of the log–RR of
each covariate, and correlations with other covariates.
Using all 27 studies, any variable whose bivariate test
had a P–value <0.10 was considered as a candidate for
the multivariate regression analyses of the log–RR of
prostate cancer morbidity or mortality [65, 66]. If two or
more covariates were moderately to highly correlated
(coefficient > 0.30), the one with lowest P–value from
the bivariate test was included in the multivariate regres-
sion analyses. Abstainer bias was the main interest of
the present study and thus its potential confounding
effect was adjusted for in the pooled analysis (Table 3)
and further examined in the stratified analysis (Table 4).
On the basis of these criteria, two other covariates were
included in the analyses: (i) whether or not the study
was conducted in the US and (ii) whether smoking was
controlled in the individual studies (Tables 3 and 4).
Although the study design variable was not selected as a
controlled covariate in the final models using bivariate
analysis, the study design was a concern as these were
unevenly distributed across the studies with different ab-
stainer biases and the RR estimates were slightly differ-
ent in case-control studies from cohort studies [23]. We
still examined the potential effect of the design variable
by performing a sensitivity analysis by including and ex-
cluding it in multivariate regression analyses (Tables 3
and 4). However, the estimates remained unchanged.
We also conducted a correlation analysis of the study
design variable and other selected covariates. The design
variable was highly correlated with the abstainer bias
variable (the coefficient = 0.48 and P < 0.001) and it was
not included in the final models.
In multivariate regression analysis, the dependent vari-
able was the natural log of the RR estimated using the
rate ratio, hazard ratio or odds ratio of each drinking
group in relation to the abstainer category. All analyses
were weighted by the inverse of the estimated variance
of the natural log RR. Variance was estimated from
reported standard errors or confidence intervals. The
weights for each individual study were created using
the inverse variance weight scheme used in fixed
regression analysis in order to obtain maximum preci-
sion for the main results of the meta–analysis [56]
and such analyses may adjust for confounding among
the characteristics [63].
Studies with large or small estimates and/or variance
can be highly influential. Univariate analysis [56, 67, 68]
was performed to identify outliers. If a particular RR was
more than twice the standard deviation of the RR esti-
mates by drinking groups it was considered to be an out-
lier; five risk estimates were identified as outliers among
126 risk estimates. Sensitivity analyses were run after
excluding outliers but no substantial changes in the risk
estimates resulted [56]. A sensitivity analysis was also
run after excluding one study by Putnam et al. [41] with
markedly higher risk estimates but, again, the estimates
remained unchanged. There was also no substantial
effect on the RR estimates when each of other studies
were excluded or included.
All significance tests assumed two–tailed P values or
95% CIs. All statistical analyses were performed using
Zhao et al. BMC Cancer  (2016) 16:845 
Page 5 of 13
 SAS 9.3 and the SAS PROC MIXED procedure was used
to model the log–transformed RR [69].
Role of the funding sources
The study funders had no role in study design, data col-
lection, analysis or interpretation, report preparation and
the decision to publish. All authors had full access to all
the data and had final responsibility for the decision to
submit for publication.
Results
There were 126 risk estimates available for different
alcohol exposures across the 27 selected studies. Table 1
presents the basic characteristics of these studies includ-
ing covariates included in individual studies. As shown
in Table 1, there were 16 prospective and one retrospect-
ive cohort studies, five hospital–based case–control and
five population–based case–control studies. A forest plot
(see Fig. 2) displays the weighted RR estimates for the
risk of prostate cancer associated with any level of drink-
ing versus “abstaining” reported in individual studies,
grouped according to the type of misclassification error
present. A visual inspection of Fig. 2 indicates consider-
able cross–study variation in estimates.
Table 2 presents unadjusted mean RR estimates of
prostate cancer morbidity or mortality by level of alco-
hol consumption with tests of publication bias and het-
erogeneity. Figure 3 provides a funnel plot showing the
log–RRs and their inverse standard error from which
there was no indication of publication bias as the plot is
reasonably symmetrical. No significant publication bias
was detected using the Egger’s regression either for the
pooled data or the individual drinking categories data
(P > 0.05 for each drinking category). Similarly, there
was no significant heterogeneity detected using the Q
statistic in either the pooled or individual drinking
category estimates (P > 0.05 in each case). Compared
to the “abstainers” (a heterogeneous group defined
differently in different studies due to presence or absence
of misclassification errors), being a drinker at any level was
associated with increased risk of prostate cancer (RR =
1.08, 95% CI: 1.04–1.12, P = 0.0033). Risk of prostate cancer
was significantly raised for low (RR = 1.09, P = 0.0031) and
higher volume drinkers (RR = 1.15, P = 0.0336) but not
other drinking categories. In unadjusted analysis, a signifi-
cant dose–response relationship in the RR was observed
among active drinkers (t–test statistic = 3.42, P = 0.0009).
We next examined whether study characteristics either
significantly modified or potentially confounded the risk
relationships between alcohol consumption and prostate
cancer morbidity or mortality outcomes. The weighted
RR estimate for any drinking versus non–drinking is sig-
nificantly higher for US than non–US studies (t–test P =
0.0005) but not significant for low volume drinking
versus non–drinking (t–test P = 0.1432) (see Additional
file 2. Weighted RR estimates according to study charac-
teristics”). When further investigating whether the US
vs. non–US variable was a modifier, the interaction term
in the model was not statistically significant (P = 0.9580)
and so meta-analyses are presented on a pool of both
US and non-US studies. When tests with low volume alco-
hol exposure alone were conducted (see Additional file 2) a
borderline modification effect with the misclassification
error variable was evident (P = 0.0767) for the comparison
between studies free of misclassification errors and those
with just former drinker error. Two other variables were
identified in bivariate analyses as potential confounders of
the risk relationship between alcohol consumption and
prostate cancer morbidity or mortality: (i) whether the US–
non–US study (P = 0.0019) and (ii) whether a study
controlled for smoking status (P = 0.0838). The misclassifi-
cation error variable was included as covariates in the
pooled (un–stratified) multivariate regression analysis given
previous research highlighting their importance. Table 3
presents weighted only, partially adjusted and fully adjusted
mean RR estimates of morbidity or mortality due to pros-
tate cancer for different drinking categories. The weighted
RR estimates without further adjustment were significantly
higher for low, medium, high and higher volume drinkers
than abstainers. After further adjusting for the confounding
effect of drinker biases (partially adjusted), the RR estimates
increased. After further adjusting for US-non-US study and
controlled smoking (fully adjusted), there was a statistically
significantly increased risk of prostate cancer for low
(adjusted RR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.04–1.11 and t–test P =
0.0001), medium (adjusted RR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.02–1.12
and t–test P = 0.0041), high (adjusted RR = 1.14, 95% CI =
1.08–1.22 and t–test P = 0.0001) and higher volume
drinkers (adjusted RR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.10–1.27 and t–
test P = 0.0001). There was also still a significant dose–re-
sponse relation between risk of prostate cancer and alcohol
consumption for current drinkers in adjusted analysis (Fully
adjusted model, t–test statistic = 2.79, Ptrend = 0.0063).

Given the previous literature indicating the potential
for misclassification errors to bias risk estimates, visual
inspection of the Fig. 2 and the borderline evidence for
effect modification in Additional file 2, we also present
results stratified by type of misclassification errors
detected in Table 4. These show substantially different
estimates according to the presence or absence of differ-
ent misclassification errors with studies free from errors
having the highest RR estimate for low volume drinkers
(RR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.05–1.45, P = 0.0143) and those
with only former drinker bias having the lowest (RR =
1.01, 95% CI: 0.96–1.06, P = 0.6901). A similar pattern
of results was evident for higher levels of alcohol

 consumption and, also, for estimates of prostate cancer
risk with any level of current alcohol consumption for
which only the error–free studies show a significant risk
for drinking regardless of whether adjustment is made
whether studies controlled for US-non-US study or
smoking. Sensitivity analysis found that inclusion or ex-
clusion of the study design variable in the models made
no difference to the estimates. These results are basically
consistent with the pooled analysis in suggesting an in-
creased risk even for low volume drinking but also indi-
cate the importance of misclassification errors as a
potential cause of bias. In particular, inclusion of former
drinkers in the abstaining reference group appears to re-
duce the risk estimates.
Discussion
Meta–analyses of cohort and case–control studies were
conducted to investigate (i) the role of alcohol consump-
tion as a potential risk factor for prostate cancer and, (ii)
whether this relationship was significantly influenced by
key study characteristics and potential biases, in particu-
lar according to whether former and/or occasional
drinkers were misclassified as abstainers. Unique among
published meta-analyses [21–23, 25], we report a significant

 dose response relationship to be observed with increasing
risk of prostate cancer starting at low–level alcohol con-
sumption (>1.33g and <25g ethanol/day) regardless of ad-
justment for study characteristics in pooled models of all 27
eligible studies. High (45– < 65 g/day) and higher (65+ g/
day) volume drinkers had a significantly higher risk (RR =
1.14 and 1.18). Further, there was no significant heterogen-
eity in study estimates or evidence of publication bias.
However, when analyses were stratified by whether or not
studies misclassified former and/or occasional drinkers as
abstainers, it was evident that former drinker bias reduced
overall risk estimates to the extent that alcohol exposure at
any level was no longer associated with significantly in-
creased risk of prostate cancer. Out of 27 studies included,
16 contained former drinker bias, 15 occasional drinker
bias only, six were free from both types of bias. It can be
concluded that the common practice of combining former
drinkers with abstainers in prospective studies of alcohol

 consumption and health biases risk estimates downwards
and can lead to underestimation of the risks posed by low
volume consumption. There was no indication that mis-
classifying occasional drinkers contributed to significant
downward bias in risk estimates and, further, when esti-
mates were made separately for occasional drinkers the
RRs tended to be slightly lower. We conclude that the com-
mon
practice
of
misclassifying
former
drinkers
as
abstainers, especially in older studies, has sometimes dis-
guised a significant association between alcohol exposure
and risk of prostate cancer.
Alcohol is a known carcinogen causing a variety of hu-
man cancers [70] via different biological pathways de-
pending on the anatomical site. The evidence that
alcoholic drinks are a cause of cancers of the mouth,
pharynx,
larynx,
oesophagus,
liver,
colorectum
and
breast in women is compelling [25, 70, 71]. Alcoholic
beverages
are
multicomponent
mixtures
containing
several carcinogenic compounds such as ethanol, acetal-
dehyde, aflatoxins and ethyl carbamate [72] and all of
these compounds may contribute to increase the risk of
cancer due to alcohol consumption reported in observa-
tional studies. The biological mechanisms by which alco-
hol intake might increase the risk of prostate cancer are
not fully understood but the main mechanisms are likely
to include a genotoxic effect of acetaldehyde, the induc-
tion of microsomal cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and
associated oxidative stress, increased estrogen concen-
tration, a role as a solvent for tobacco carcinogens,
changes in folate metabolism, and changes in DNA
repair [73–75].
Several limitations with our meta–analysis must be
acknowledged. Our meta–analysis was based on 27 stud-
ies including 126 risk estimates. This sample is relatively
small when conducting multivariate regression to con-
trol for study level characteristics that might confound

 the relationship between prostate cancer and alcohol
consumption. Furthermore, adjustment for study level
characteristics such as whether smoking status was con-
trolled is of course not as precise as controlling for this
variable at the individual level within a study. Inevitably,
uncontrolled confounding from unmeasured or impre-
cisely measured variables will be present both within
and between studies. Control for smoking status, for
example, can be done in many ways and some studies
did not distinguish former smokers from lifetime non–
smokers. Our analysis showed a statistically significantly
higher risk of prostate cancer due to any drinking in the
studies conducted in the US than in other countries.
However, this effect disappeared when controls for other

 covariates such as drinker bias and between-study vari-
ation were introduced. This finding might be affected by
the relatively small number of studies available for
analysis and/or other unmeasured confounders and
modifiers. The issue should be revisited in future meta-
analyses when more studies are available. While there
were relatively few studies available for analysis, the
required number of subjects per variable for linear
regression is much smaller than in logistic regression
and a minimum of even two subjects per variable would
not bias the estimate in linear regression analysis [76].
The great majority of identified studies suffered one or
more serious methodological problems including the
widespread practice of misclassifying former drinkers as
abstainers. Our study was unable to incorporate the rec-
ommendation from Liang et al. [77] that former drinkers
should in fact be included within the category of current
drinkers according to previous drinking level so as to
create an unbiased estimate of the risk relationship as
only two eligible studies provided the risk estimates of
differential drinking levels among former drinkers [6, 36].
Finally, as highlighted by Zeisser et al. [19], many studies
classified occasional drinkers as low or medium volume
drinkers creating the possibility of “reverse occasional
drinker bias”. This may have differential effects according
to gender but in the present study male occasional
drinkers mostly had the lowest level of risk of prostate
cancer. If occasional drinkers are included with low vol-
ume drinkers this could also have the effect of minimizing
risk estimates. No studies were identified that were free of
all possible types of misclassification error (ie when
reverse occasional drinker bias is considered).
Conclusions
In summary, the RR of prostate cancer morbidity or
mortality significantly increased at low volume alcohol
consumption levels (>1.3 g and <24g per day) compared
to abstinence and a statistically significant a dose–response
relationship was observed for the first time in a meta–ana-
lysis. The level of increased risk observed for low volume
drinkers was relatively modest in the pooled analysis (8%),
but was as high as 23% in the studies free of misclassifica-
tion error. In either scenario, with a condition as prevalent
as prostate cancer in developed countries, the public health
implications of the findings are significant, so we suggest
these are practically significant levels of risk for prevention
purposes. Different forms of misclassification bias may dif-
ferentially affect risk estimates, particularly the common
practice of including former drinkers in the abstainer refer-
ence group may reduce risk estimates. Prostate cancer may
need to be incorporated in future estimates of the burden
of disease alongside other cancers (e.g. breast, oesophagus,
colon, liver) and be integrated into public health strategies
for reducing alcohol related disease. We recommend that
future prospective studies on alcohol and disease seek to
avoid biasing risk estimates by misclassifying either (i)
former or occasional drinkers as abstainers, or (ii) occa-
sional drinkers as low volume drinkers. Following Liang
and Chikritzhs [77], we also recommend that former
drinkers are classified with drinkers according to their past
level of consumption.
