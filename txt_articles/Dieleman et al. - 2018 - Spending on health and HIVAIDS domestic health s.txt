Spending on health and HIV/AIDS: domestic health spending 
and development assistance in 188 countries, 1995–2015
Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network*
Summary
Background Comparable estimates of health spending are crucial for the assessment of health systems and to 
optimally deploy health resources. The methods used to track health spending continue to evolve, but little is known 
about the distribution of spending across diseases. We developed improved estimates of health spending by source, 
including development assistance for health, and, for the first time, estimated HIV
/AIDS spending on prevention and 
treatment and by source of funding, for 188 countries.
Methods We collected published data on domestic health spending, from 1995 to 2015, from a diverse set of 
international agencies. We tracked development assistance for health from 1990 to 2017. We also extracted 
5385 datapoints about HIV
/AIDS spending, between 2000 and 2015, from online databases, country reports, and 
proposals submitted to multilateral organisations. We used spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression to generate 
complete and comparable estimates for health and HIV
/AIDS spending. We report most estimates in 2017 purchasing-
power parity-adjusted dollars and adjust all estimates for the effect of inflation.
Findings Between 1995 and 2015, global health spending per capita grew at an annualised rate of 3·1% (95% uncertainty 
interval [UI] 3·1 to 3·2), with growth being largest in upper-middle-income countries (5·4% per capita [UI 5·3–5·5]) 
and lower-middle-income countries (4·2% per capita [4·2–4·3]). In 2015, $9·7 trillion (9·7 trillion to 9·8 trillion) was 
spent on health worldwide. High-income countries spent $6·5 trillion (6·4 trillion to 6·5 trillion) or 66·3% (66·0 to 66·5) 
of the total in 2015, whereas low-income countries spent $70·3 billion (69·3 billion to 71·3 billion) or 0·7% (0·7 to 0·7). 
Between 1990 and 2017, development assistance for health increased by 394·7% ($29·9 billion), with an estimated 
$37·4 billion of development assistance being disbursed for health in 2017, of which $9·1 billion (24·2%) targeted 
HIV
/AIDS. Between 2000 and 2015, $562·6 billion (531·1 billion to 621·9 billion) was spent on HIV/AIDS worldwide. 
Governments financed 57·6% (52·0 to 60·8) of that total. Global HIV/AIDS spending peaked at 49·7 billion 
(46·2–54·7) in 2013, decreasing to $48·9 billion (45·2 billion to 54·2 billion) in 2015. That year, low-income and 
lower-middle-income countries represented 74·6% of all HIV/AIDS disability-adjusted life-years, but just 
36·6% (34·4 to 38·7) of total HIV/AIDS spending. In 2015, $9·3 billion (8·5 billion to 10·4 billion) or 
19·0% (17·6 to 20·6) of HIV/AIDS financing was spent on prevention, and $27·3 billion (24·5 billion to 31·1 billion) 
or 55·8% (53·3 to 57·9) was dedicated to care and treatment.
Interpretation From 1995 to 2015, total health spending increased worldwide, with the fastest per capita growth in 
middle-income countries. While these national disparities are relatively well known, low-income countries spent less 
per person on health and HIV
/AIDS than did high-income and middle-income countries. Furthermore, declines in 
development assistance for health continue, including for HIV
/AIDS. Additional cuts to development assistance 
could hasten this decline, and risk slowing progress towards global and national goals.

Introduction
For more than 50 years, health spending has increased 
steadily, in many cases outpacing economic growth.1 As 
health spending grows as a share of the global economy, it 
is essential to know how spending on health is distributed 
among diseases and how national health spending differs. 
Assessing health spending, the source of the financing, 
and the distribution of the funds across different countries, 
populations, and diseases is crucial to ensure that funds 
for health are used optimally and equitably.
In many low-income countries, health spending 
amounts to less than $100 (2017 purchasing-power 
parity-adjusted dollars) per person annually, whereas in 
many high-income countries, health spending exceeds 
$5000 per person.2 While these national disparities are 
relatively well known, estimates of disease-specific 
spending around the world are scarce. Some National 
Health Accounts do exist for specific health areas, 
including maternal and child health, vaccines, malaria, 
tuberculosis, and HIV
/AIDS.3 Disease-specific health 
accounting methodologies—such as National AIDS 
Spending Assessments—have also been developed and 
applied in many countries.4 The System of Health 
Accounts (2011) framework aims to fully allocate spending

by disease area, including spending on cancers, diabetes, 
and other non-communicable diseases.5,6 Finally, country-
specific research on the USA, Norway, and other selected 
countries 
has 
quantified 
spending 
by 
disease 
in an even more detailed and comprehensive manner 
than before.7–10 However, these previous cross-country 
comparisons have focused solely on either specific 
geographical regions or income groups over short time 
periods.11,12 Despite this proliferation of country-level 
and regional estimates, very little is known about 
trends and the drivers of trends in spending by disease, 
because competing methodologies produce incomparable 
estimates. Major data gaps also limit comparisons over 
time and countries. With the exception of development 
assistance for health, disease-specific spending estimates 
have not been calculated in a way that permits cross-
country comparison or comparison across time. 
Our study begins to fill this gap by tracking health 
spending on HIV
/AIDS for 188 countries from 
2000 to 2015. Quantifying HIV
/AIDS spending is an initial 
step in conducting global disease-specific spending 
assessments and is a crucial priority for the international 
community and countries. The position of HIV
/AIDS as a 
top global health priority was solidified in Millennium 
Development Goal 6 and Sustainable Development Goal 
(SDG) 3.13,14 This attention has created an unprecedented 
level of HIV
/AIDS financing data that have largely 
remained 
disparate, 
incomparable, 
and 
untapped. 
Collating and synthesising this information to produce 
comparable results has the potential to reveal the impact of 
looming declines in international HIV
/AIDS financing.15
We aimed to investigate three features of global health 
spending to characterise the variation in health spending 
across health systems and to characterise how international 
and domestic partners have responded to recent global 
health crises, such as Ebola and HIV
/AIDS. First, we 
estimated health spending worldwide, tracking how much 
was spent on health in 188 countries. Second, we tracked 
development assistance for health, tracing disbursements 
from their source, through intermediary channels, to 
recipients in low-income and middle-income countries. 
We aimed to quantify how much of that financing 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Previous evidence about health financing, including global 
resource tracking efforts produced by WHO and the Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) Health Financing Collaborator 
Network, has been published for diverse topics. In 2017, WHO 
updated estimates of health spending disaggregated by source, 
using System of Health Accounts (2011) classifications. Other 
research has captured health spending for subsets of countries 
and spending types. This study builds on those data and 
methods used previously by the GBD Health Financing 
Collaborator Network in 2017. The 2017 study used these data 
to illustrate health financing patterns and changes in health 
spending as countries develop. However, previous work by 
WHO and the Collaborator Network did not estimate 
uncertainty, did not estimate spending for all countries, and did 
not estimate disease-specific spending.
Previous evidence about HIV/AIDS spending includes National 
AIDS Spending Assessments, National Health Accounts, and 
other sources, which captured HIV/AIDS financing for short 
timespans and subsets of countries. To our knowledge, no 
study has collated these HIV/AIDS data and estimated spending 
for all countries across time. Furthermore, no comprehensive 
global estimates of total spending by disease or disaggregated 
by source or type of care exist to date for all countries, building 
from a broad dataset.
Added value of this study
This study improved estimates of health spending published 
in 2017, and expanded the scope to capture disease-specific 
spending. We added four more countries and estimated a 
complete series of health spending, disaggregated by source, 
for 188 countries, alongside 95% uncertainty intervals that 
quantify which estimates are most and least certain. We 
included recently published data from WHO that is based on the 
System of Health Accounts 2011, and built models favouring 
datapoints drawn from an identified source or clear estimation 
methods. We estimated development assistance for health 
disaggregated across health focus areas, expanded to include 
pandemic preparedness. Finally, we collected and harmonised 
5385 datapoints to estimate HIV/AIDS spending across 
188 countries. We report estimates of domestic government 
and private contributions to HIV/AIDS funding and spending 
on HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention.
Implications of all the available evidence
Total health spending continues to outpace economic growth 
in many contexts, but development assistance is levelling off. 
Global HIV/AIDS spending amounted to $562·6 billion from 
2000 to 2015, although the amount of HIV/AIDS spending 
varies substantially across countries, income, and prevalence 
groups. The substantial share of spending sourced externally 
in countries with high HIV/AIDS prevalence highlights the risk 
posed by future reductions in development assistance for 
HIV/AIDS and the vigilance required to ensure that global 
goals, such as the UNAIDS Fast-Track Targets and Sustainable 
Development Goal target 3.3, are achieved. Comparable and 
comprehensive estimates of health spending and 
disease-specific spending are crucial for assessing the 
allocation of resources worldwide and pinpointing important 
gaps in spending. Paired with GBD estimates, these data make 
possible a diverse set of comparisons, including analyses 
across different periods, countries, income groups, regions, 
and funding sources.

focuses on core health focus areas, including HIV
/AIDS, 
pandemic preparedness, and other primary areas of health 
financing. Finally, we tracked international and domestic 
spending on HIV
/AIDS, with funds disaggregated across 
four financing sources and broken down by spending on 
prevention and treatment. This evidence will be particularly 
important to both donors and countries as they coordinate 
responses to future global health challenges, move to 
adopt sustainable health financing polices that reduce 
reliance on development assistance for health, and chart 
courses towards the achievement of the SDGs.
Methods
Overview
Each health financing component we tracked required 
unique input data and, consequently, estimation focused 
on different time periods. We tracked health spending by 
source from 1995 to 2015, development assistance for 
health from 1990 to 2017, and HIV
/AIDS spending from 
2000 through to the end of 2015. Most spending estimates 
reported in this paper are reported using 2017 purchasing-
power parity-adjusted dollars to adjust for inflation and 
to reflect the country-specific purchasing power of the 
resources. Development assistance for health estimates 
that are stratified by source, channel, or health focus area 
are tracked using 2017 US$ to reflect the quantity of 
development assistance for health provided by donors, 
using an internationally recognisable currency (ie, US$). 
Development assistance for health estimates stratified by 
recipient country are converted into 2017 purchasing-
power parity-adjusted dollars based on the country to 
which the resources were provided.
Estimating domestic health spending, government, 
prepaid private, and out-of-pocket spending
We extracted data about transfers from government 
domestic revenue (allocated to health purposes), social 
insurance contributions, compulsory prepayment, volun-
tary prepayment, other domestic revenue from households, 
corporations, and non-profit institutions serving the 
household, and gross domestic product (GDP), each 
measured in local currency, from the WHO Global Health 
Expenditure Database.3 We divided each health spending 
variable by GDP, also reported by WHO. To estimate 
domestic government spending on health, we added 
the value of transfers from government domestic 
revenue (allocated to health purposes), social insurance 
contributions, and compulsory prepayment. To estimate 
domestic prepaid private health spending, we added the 
values of voluntary prepayment, other domestic revenues 
from corporations, and other domestic revenues from 
non-profit institutions serving the household. Out-of-
pocket spending is comprised of payments by households. 
Our tracking of domestic health spending focuses on 
current health spending and excludes major investment, 
such as building hospitals and research and development. 
We multiplied all health financing fractions by the GDP 
per capita series, measured in 2017 purchasing-power 
parity-adjusted dollars, to estimate spending per person in 
that currency.16
Many of the extracted data are not tied to an underlying 
data source and are estimated. Although more information 
is available in recent iterations,6,17 the documentation of 
these tracking, estimation, and imputation methods 
remains, in some cases, poorly defined and inconsistent, 
or simply unreported. Furthermore, for a given country, 
these data vary substantially across time. To estimate 
health spending across time, country, and spending 
category, we used a spatiotemporal Gaussian process 
regression model.18 This model was developed for the 
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study to identify patterns 
across time and geographies.18 A further description of 
spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression model can be 
found in the appendix, along with out-of-sample statistics. 
To prevent data with unclear methods or proper data 
source identification from influencing our spatiotem-
poral Gaussian process regression model estimation, 
we developed a data weighting procedure. Each datapoint 
was assessed and assigned a weight between one and five 
on the basis of the point-specific metadata provided in 
the Global Health Expenditure Database. We based 
weights upon metadata completeness, documented source 
information, and documented methods for estimation. 
Our guidelines for assessing the metadata are included in 
the appendix.
Tracking development assistance for health
Development assistance for health includes the financial 
and in-kind resources provided by development agencies 
to low-income and middle-income countries, with the 
primary objective of maintaining or improving health. 
We estimated development assistance for health using 
project records, annual reports, budgets, and financial 
statements from international organisations. We relied 
on commitment and budget data to generate estimates 
for the most recent years when disbursement data were 
not available.
Our estimates of development assistance for health 
tracked disbursements from the originating source 
through the disbursing agency, called the channel, to the 
recipient country and targeted health focus area or 
programme area. We used disbursement and income 
data to remove resources that were passed between 
development agencies before being disbursed to prevent 
double counting. We also accounted for the administrative 
expenses incurred by estimating in-kind expenses.
We disaggregated development assistance for health 
disbursements into nine health focus areas: HIV
/AIDS, 
tuberculosis, malaria, maternal health, newborn and 
child health, other infectious diseases, non-communicable 
diseases, sector-wide approaches and health system 
strengthening, and other. The other category captured all 
projects that did not align with any of the other health 
focus areas. We further disaggregated these health focus

areas by programme area, which are spending categories 
that represent programmatic aims or implementation 
approaches within the broader health focus areas. For 
example, we disaggregated development assistance for 
HIV
/AIDS into treatment, diagnosis, care and support, 
counselling and testing, orphan and vulnerable children, 
prevention of mother-to-child transmission, and HIV
/
AIDS system support. Additionally, we tracked develop-
ment assistance for pandemic preparedness as a 
programme area within sector-wide approaches and health 
system strengthening, and treatment and diagnosis as 
separate programme areas under tubercu 
losis. We used 
keywords from project titles, descriptions, and budgets to 
determine the targeted health focus and programme areas 
for projects.
We report development assistance for health estimates 
in 2017 US$, but converted disbursements from 2017 US$ 
to 2017 purchasing-power parity-adjusted dollars to add 
them to domestic spending estimates. We did this by first 
deflating disbursements to current US$, exchanging 
disbursements to the current national currency units of 
the recipient country, deflating to constant 2017 local 
currency, and then exchanging to 2017 purchasing-power 
parity-adjusted dollars. Detailed explanations of the 
methods used to track development assistance for health, 
including how disbursements for cross-cutting areas are 
allocated, are included in the appendix.
Estimating HIV/AIDS spending
We estimated HIV
/AIDS spending measures by 
financing source (government spending, out-of-pocket, 
and prepaid private spending) and three HIV
/AIDS 
spending categories (prevention, care and treatment, and 
all other spending).
We extracted HIV
/AIDS spending data from five data 
sources. First, we used the spending data in the AIDSinfo 
database.19 This UNAIDS-curated database collates 
countries’ annual reports on progress towards global 
HIV
/AIDS goals, which capture HIV
/AIDS spending by 
governments and the private sector. Second, we used the 
public and private spending data reported by countries in 
proposals and concept notes submitted to the Global 
Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. We 
included only current and past spending data reported 
in these submissions. Third, we extracted data from all 
National Health Accounts that capture HIV
/AIDS 
spending, including sub-accounts and data produced 
under the updated System of Health Accounts (2011) 
approach. Fourth, we extracted data from all National 
AIDS Spending Assessments, including spending on 
prevention and care and treatment.4,20 Finally, we 
downloaded data for the Asia–Pacific region from the 
AIDS data hub. We converted all reported spending 
measures to 2017 purchasing power parity.
We aimed to adhere to the definition and boundaries of 
health spending as defined by the System of Health 
Accounts 2011 framework. This approach required us to 
harmonise the extracted data to correct for known 
definitional differences between data sources and 
observed biases within the data. The National AIDS 
Spending Assessment’s definition of HIV
/AIDS spending 
included spending on non-health related categories such 
as spending on orphan and vulnerable children, enabling 
environment, and social protection. To correct for this, we 
extracted data from these three non-health-related 
spending categories and subtracted their values from all 
National AIDS Spending Assessment-reported spending 
by financing source. This correction probably accounted 
for most definitional biases between National AIDS 
Spending Assessments and National Health Accounts, 
but the granularity with which the data were reported 
limited further efforts to harmonise these two data 
sources. Similarly, we removed orphan and vulnerable 
children disbursements from our development assistance 
for health data.
Not all data sources reported spending as granularly as 
we required. For example, some data sources only 
reported total domestic spending (sum of government, 
out-of-pocket, and prepaid private) or reported only 
private spending (sum of out-of-pocket and prepaid 
private). Although these spending measures did not 
match our measures of interest, they still provided 
valuable information. To use all available data, we 
estimated a total of five HIV
/AIDS financing by source 
models (domestic, private, government, out-of-pocket, 
and prepaid private). To ensure internal consistency 
across all models, we developed a sophisticated 
aggregating procedure that included information about 
the number of underlying datapoints each series had, 
and how the estimated series related to each other. More 
information is provided in the appendix.
We used a spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression 
model to model each HIV/AIDS financing source and 
spending category model. For all HIV/AIDS spending 
variables, the model consisted of a mixed-effect model 
with random effects on GBD super-region, region, and 
country, as well as covariates ranging from antiretroviral 
therapy coverage to the natural log of lag distributed 
GDP per capita, natural log of HIV prevalence, natural 
log of HIV incidence, natural log of HIV mortality rate, 
and, the natural log of antiretroviral therapy prices. 
We determined the exact specifications of each model 
through out-of-sample prediction tests (appendix). We 
sourced all covariate estimates from the GBD Study 
2016.21 To detect and reduce the influence of outlier 
datapoints, we used our previous model to measure the 
Cook’s distance for each datapoint and excluded the 
datapoint if Cook’s distance, D, was greater than 4/n 
 
where n is the number of extracted datapoints.
Aggregating health and HIV/AIDS spending by income 
groups, regions, and HIV/AIDS severity
We reported health spending for each country, income 
group, and geographical region. We used 2017 World

Bank income groups and GBD Study 2016 regions to 
categorise all years of data.21,22 We aggregated rates by 
calculating total spending for the income group or region 
relative to the total income, number of prevalent cases, or 
health spending for the group or region. These measures 
reflect the income group or region as a whole, rather than 
reflecting the average of the nations that make up 
the group or region. We also grouped countries into 
three HIV
/AIDS prevalence categories: low prevalence 
(<1% prevalence), high prevalence (1–5% prevalence), and 
extremely high prevalence (>5% prevalence). For these 
HIV
/AIDS disease severity groups we extracted data from 
the GBD Study 2016.23 Categories were informed by 
cutoffs developed by UNAIDS.24 Finally, to compare health 
spending to health burden, we extracted country-specific 
disability-adjusted life-year estimates from the GBD Study 
2016.23 We did this analysis using R (version 3.4.0), Stata 
(version 13), and Python (version 3.6).
Role of the funding source
The funder of this study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. All authors had full access to all the data in the 
study, and JLD and CJLM had final responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication.
Results
Total health spending
In 2015, $9·7 trillion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 
9·7 trillion to 9·8 trillion) was spent globally on health. 
Spending per capita varied widely across countries, 
span 
ning from less than $100 per capita per year on 
health (Bangladesh, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, 
Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Mozambique, 
Niger, Somalia, South Sudan, and Togo) to more than 
$5000 per capita (Andorra, Austria, Denmark, Germany, 
Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, 
Switzerland, and the USA; table 1). In 2015, high-income 
countries spent $5551 (5503 to 5605) per person on health, 
whereas upper-middle-income countries spent $949 (942 
to 959) per capita. Lower-middle-income countries spent 
$266 (263 to 268) per capita and low-income countries 
spent $110 (108 to 111) per capita on health.
Globally, health spending per capita grew at an 
annualised rate of 3·1% (95% UI 3·1–3·2) between

1995 and 2015. Growth was largest in upper-middle-
income countries, where health spending per capita 
grew by 5·4% (5·3–5·5) and in lower-middle-income 
countries, where it grew by 4·2% (4·2–4·3). Spending in 
low-income countries increased at a rate of 1·9% (1·7–2·0) 
annually and was the lowest rate of growth observed 
among income groups, whereas in high-income 
countries, which generally aim to slow health spending 
growth, per capita growth was 3·0% (3·0–3·1).
Figure 1 shows annualised rates of change for health 
spending and population across income groups and 
regions. Between 1995 and 2000, spending in low-income 
countries increased by 0·8% (95% UI 0·2–1·5) annually. 
Subsequently, growth rose steeply to 7·8% (7·1–8·5) 
between 2000 and 2005, and then grew by 5·4% (5·0–5·9) 
from 2005 to 2010, and 5·0% (4·7–5·5) from 2010 to 2015 
(figure 1). This finding contrasts with the other income 
groups: the highest rates of growth in health spending 
are observed from 2005 to 2010 for lower-middle-income 
and upper-middle-income countries, and from 2000 to 
2005 for high-income countries (figure 1A). Additionally, 
the growth rates in population have declined for all other 
income groups except for low-income countries, for 
which annualised population growth rates remained at 
roughly 2·8% over the entire period. Because of these 
sustained populations, only marginal increases in per 
capita growth were observed in low-income countries. 
Across regions, health spending grew the most in 
southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, which grew at an 
annualised rate of 9·1% (9·0–9·2) from 1995 to 
2015, while health spending grew the slowest in central 
and eastern Europe and central Asia, at 3·5% (3·4–3·6) 
over the same period (figure 1B).
In addition to spending more on health, wealthy 
nations also tended to finance more health spending 
from public sources of funds. Panels C and D of figure 1 
reflect the annualised rates of change in the source of 
funds for health spending and population, from 
1995 to 2015, by income groups and regions. In low-
income countries, health spending financed by the 
government grew by 3·7% (95% UI 3·4–4·0) annually 
between 1995 and 2015, compared with an annual growth 
of 10·5% in spending financed by development 
assistance for health over the same period. In lower-
middle-income countries, similar levels of growth are 
observed in all the different sources of health spending 
over the same period (figure 1C). From 1995 to 2015, 
spending financed by government increased the most 
each year in upper-middle-income (7·2% [7·1–7·3]) and 
high-income countries (4·0% [3·9–4·1]), compared with 
other income groups. Across regions, southeast Asia, 
east Asia, and Oceania had the highest growth in

spending financed by government sources: 11·2% 
(11·0–11·4) annually from 1995 to 2015. South Asia had 
the highest annualised growth rates in spending financed 
by prepaid private sources (8·9% [8·6–9·3]), whereas 
sub-Saharan Africa had the highest annualised growth 
rates in development assistance for health (10·8%) over 
the same period (figure 1D). Sub-Saharan African 
countries had the highest population growth rates 
(figure 1).
Despite clear patterns connecting total health spending 
and national income, country-level spending varied sub-
stantially, even within income groups and geographical 
regions (table 1). Across the low-income country group, 
health spending per capita, in 2015, spanned from 
$28 (95% UI 27–30) in the Central African Republic to 
$481 (474–488) in Liberia. Within the lower-middle-
income group, health spending per capita spanned from 
$90 (86–94) in Bangladesh to $849 (766–932) in Armenia. 
Within the upper-middle-income group, health spending 
per capita ranged from $241 (229–255) in Tonga to 
$1850 (1719–1990) in the Maldives. Finally, in high-income 
countries, health spending per capita was lowest in 
the Seychelles at $957 (870–1057) and highest in the USA, 
at $9839 (9677–9983; table 1).
Figure 2: Development assistance for health by channel and health focus area, 1990–2017
Development assistance for health annual estimates and annualised growth rates, disaggregated by channel (A, B) and health focus area (C, D). Estimates are shown from 1990 to 2017, in billions of 
2017 US$. Growth rates are shown for 2000–10, and 2010–17. Gavi channel annualised growth rates were excluded from panel B because of high annualised growth rates between 2000 and 2010, resulting 
from large increases in funding from the organisation’s inception (in 2000) to 2010. World Bank includes the International Development Association and the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development; and regional development banks include the Inter-American Development Bank, the African Development Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. NGOs=non-governmental organisations.

Development assistance for health
Figure 2A shows that between 1990 and 2017, development 
assistance for health increased by 394·7% (from 7·6 billion 
to $37·4 billion), although this growth was not consistent 
throughout this period (figure 2B, 2D). From 1990 to 2000, 
the annualised growth rate was 4·8%, with development 
assistance for health reaching $12·0 billion in 2000. From 
2000 to 2010, the annualised growth rate was 11·2%. 
Between 2010 and 2017, development assistance for health 
remained relatively constant (1·0% growth), peaking in 
2013. We estimated the 2017 development assistance for 
health to be $37·4 billion (figure 2).
More development assistance for health was targeted at 
HIV
/AIDS than at any other health focus area, with an 
estimated $9·1 billion spent in 2017 (figure 2C). This is 
a noteworthy increase (11·9% annualised growth rate) 
compared with spending on HIV
/AIDS at the turn of 
the millennium and the onset of the Millennium Develop-
ment Goals. Development assistance for HIV
/AIDS 
reached its peak in 2012, at $12·0 billion, and has since 
declined by 24·3%. This finding stands in stark contrast 
with the growth observed between 2000 and 2012, which 
was 20·0% annually. The US Government was the largest 
source of development assistance for HIV
/AIDS, 
providing more than 50% of this assistance each year 
since 2008 (figure 3A). Development assistance for 
HIV
/AIDS is channelled through many international 
agencies, including inter 
national non-governmental 
organisations (7·3% in 2017) and the Global Fund 
(21·4% in 2017). In 2017, $2·9 billion (31·9%) of 
$9·1 billion of development assistance for HIV
/AIDS was 
spent on treatment, and $1·5 billion (16·8%) was spent 
on prevention (excluding prevention of mother-to-child 
transmission of HIV
/AIDS; figure 3B).
Development assistance for health that targeted other 
health focus areas was also substantial. We estimated that, 
in 2017, $7·7 billion of development assistance for health 
targeted newborn and child health, and $4·2 billion 
targeted sector-wide approaches and health system 
strengthening. There was substantially less development 
assistance targeting pandemic preparedness in 2017
. 
We estimated this amount to be $204·2 million, with 
82·6% ($168·7 million) of these funds channelled through 
WHO (figure 3C).
Health spending on HIV/AIDS
We estimated that between 2000 and 2015, $562·6 billion 
(531·1 billion to 621·9 billion) was spent on HIV
/AIDS.

Global HIV
/AIDS spending peaked at 49·7 billion 
(95% UI 46·2 billion to 54·7 billion) in 2013, but 
decreased slightly to $48·9 billion (45·2 billion to 
54·2 billion) in 2015. Still, the 2015 total remains nearly 
three times that of spending in 2000 ($16·4 billion 
[14·6 billion to 19·3 billion]).
Most spending on HIV
/AIDS occurs in high-income 
and upper-middle-income countries (figure 4A, table 2). 
In 2015, $16·3 billion (95% UI 14·5 billion to 18·4 billion) 
was spent on HIV
/AIDS in high-income countries, and 
$14·7 billion (12·7 billion to 17·6 billion) was spent in 
upper-middle-income countries. Despite more people 
living with HIV
/AIDS in lower-middle-income and low-
income countries, these income groups have experienced 
reductions in HIV
/AIDS spending between 2013 and 
2015, whereas upper-middle-income and high-income 
countries’ spending has continued to grow during these 
same years. By 2015, $9·8 billion (9·0 billion to 11·1 billion) 
was spent on HIV
/AIDS in lower-middle-income 
countries, whereas $8·0 billion (7·8 billion to 8·6 billion) 
was spent in low-income countries.
Figure 4B shows that, globally, governments were the 
largest source of spending on HIV
/AIDS, contributing a 
total of $29·8 billion (95% UI 27·5 billion to 32·8 billion) 
or 61·0% (55·1 to 65·1) of total HIV
/AIDS spending 
in 2015 (figure 4B). Prepaid private spending was the 
smallest, making up only $1·4 billion (0·4 billion to 
3·8 billion) or 2·8% (0·9 to 6·9) of the total in 2015. The 
development assistance for health share of HIV/AIDS 
spending is larger than is the development assistance 
for health portion of total health spending: whereas 
development assistance for health made up $51·8 billion 
or 0·5% (0·5 to 0·5) of total health spending globally 
in 2015, development assistance for health comprised 
$14·5 billion or 29·7% (26·7 to 32·0) of all HIV/AIDS 
spending in 2015.

HIV
/AIDS resources over time. Spending on care and

treatment of HIV
/AIDS has grown substantially. In 2000, 
$8·1 billion (95% UI 6·9 billion to 9·8 billion) in 
HIV
/AIDS resources was expended on care and treatment 
services, including inpatient and outpatient care and 
antiretroviral therapy delivered in these settings. By 2015, 
$27·3 billion (24·5 billion to 31·1 billion) of all HIV
/AIDS 
spending, or 55·8% (53·3 to 57·9), was disbursed for 
these same services. Spending on prevention—including 
general public health programmes and projects focused 
on slowing transmission in at-risk groups—amounted to 
$4·0 billion (3·6 billion to 4·6 billion) in 2000. In 2015, 
spending on prevention reached $9·3 billion (8·5 billion 
to 10·4 billion) or 19·0% (17·6 to 20·6) of all HIV
/AIDS 
spending.

Figure 4D shows that, in 2015, countries with a 
low (<1%) prevalence of HIV/AIDS, which collectively 
had 11·4 million people living with HIV/AIDS, spent the 
most on HIV/AIDS ($31·9 billion [95% UI 29·2 billion 
to 35·7 billion]), and had the highest spending per 
prevalent case ($2788 [2556 to 3118]). In 2015, HIV/AIDS 
spending in high (1–5%) prevalence countries was 
$8·8 billion (7·6 billion to 9·1 billion) and in extremely 
high (>5%) prevalence countries it was $8·8 (7·4 billion 
to 11·3 billion). HIV/AIDS spending per prevalent case 
in 2015 was generally lower in these countries, 
constituting $731 (682 to 814) per prevalent case in high 
prevalence countries, and $681 (570 to 869) per prevalent 
case in extremely high prevalence countries, the lowest 
across prevalence groups. Although spending per 
prevalent case in extremely high prevalence countries 
increased between 2010 and 2015 (1·2% [0·5 to 2·1] 
annually), this recent growth was much slower than the 
annual per prevalent case growth seen between 
2000 and 2010 (10·2% [7·5 to 12·7]).
Figure 5 highlights the financing sources that have 
contributed to HIV/AIDS spending per prevalent case 
growth. There have been major increases in development 
assistance per prevalent case of HIV/AIDS—annualised 
rates of change for all prevalence groups increased by 
19·9% from 2000 to 2010  (figure 5). However, between 
2010 and 2015, annual declines in development 
assistance for HIV/AIDS per prevalent case were 
observed in all HIV/AIDS prevalence groups (figure 5). 
Growth in government spending per prevalent case was 
also substantial in the 10 years after the millennium, 
increasing more than 4·0% annually for all country 
groupings (figure 5). Alongside the decreases in 
development assistance for health for HIV/AIDS 
between 2010 and 2015, the increases in government 
spending on HIV/AIDS were largely sustained. Finally, 
trends in out-of-pocket spending per prevalent case 
are mixed across prevalence groups and time periods. 
In countries with extremely high prevalence, out-of-
pocket spending per prevalent case decreased by 
4·8% (95% UI 4·2–5·5) annually between 2000 and 2010, 
and by 4·5% (2·9–5·2) annually between 2010 and 2015. 
By contrast, out-of-pocket spending per prevalent case 
increased in both periods among low-prevalence 
countries (figure 5).
Table 2 reports total health spending for HIV
/AIDS for 
each person living with HIV
/AIDS in 2015. Some of the 
countries with the highest HIV
/AIDS spending per 
prevalent case, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina and 
Macedonia, have few people living with HIV
/AIDS 
(estimated to be fewer than 80 people in 2015, in both 
countries). Additionally, there was low HIV
/AIDS spending 
per prevalent case in some high-burden countries, such as 
Haiti and Rwanda (table 2). These patterns exist generally 
across each prevalence group. In extremely high pre-
valence countries in 2015, 58·1% (95% UI 54·8–62·1) of 
HIV
/AIDS spending was disbursed as care and treatment, 
whereas 17·9% (15·2–20·0) was spent on prevention. This 
finding contrasts with low-burden countries, where 18·5% 
(16·6–20·9) of all HIV
/AIDS spending in 2015 was used to 
prevent the transmission of HIV. This distinction remains 
even when comparing prevention spending per capita: 
low-prevalence countries spent $516 (456–588) per person, 
whereas high prevalence countries spent just $121 
(105–153), 76·4% (69·7–80·5) less than in areas where 
HIV prevalence is low.
Figure 6 depicts the share of HIV
/AIDS spending 
sourced externally, as development assistance for health, 
for each GBD region in 2015. The size of each pie 
represents the number of people living with HIV
/AIDS. 
Not only does sub-Saharan Africa have the largest HIV-
positive population (24·4 million in 2015), it also depends 
most substantially on development assistance for health, 
which constitutes 63·9% (95% UI 55·7–70·2) of HIV
/AIDS 
spending in the region. South Asia also has a high level of 
dependence on donor financing, with develop 
ment 
assistance for health comprising 45·2% (33·7–55·4) of 
spending on HIV
/AIDS. Develop 
ment assistance for 
health makes up more than 20% of spending on HIV
/AIDS 
in southeast Asia, east Asia, Oceania, central Europe, 
eastern Europe, and central Asia. In high-income 
countries, Latin America, and the Caribbean, development 
assistance for health constitutes less than 13% of 
HIV
/AIDS spending.
For each dollar of development assistance for health for 
HIV
/AIDS, in countries that receive it, there is $2·1

(95% UI 1·9–2·3) in government health spending 
for HIV
/AIDS. In 2015, low-income, lower-middle-
income, and upper-middle-income countries with low 
(<1%) HIV
/AIDS prevalence received just $4·1 billion or 
26·0% (22·8–28·5) of their HIV
/AIDS spending as 
develop 
ment assistance for health, whereas high 
prevalence (1–5%) countries received $6·0 billion or 
76·5% (68·7–81·5) of total HIV
/AIDS spending as 
development for health, and extremely high prevalence 
countries (>5%) received $4·4 billion or 50·5% (39·1–59·6) 
of total HIV
/AIDS spending as development assistance 
for health. In 2015, Haiti received 97·1% (95·9–98·0) and 
Guinea-Bissau received 89·9% (83·0–94·2) of their HIV
/
AIDS spending as development assistance for health; 
both are categorised as high prevalence countries. 
Similarly, of the extremely high prevalence countries, 
Mozambique received 94·0% (90·8–96·1) and Zambia 
received 86·6% (77·2–92·7) of their HIV
/AIDS spending 
as development assistance for health.
Among low-income countries with high or extremely 
high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, $5·3 billion or 85·4% 
(79·8–88·6) of HIV/AIDS spending was sourced 
externally. However, during the past 5 years, the share 
of HIV/AIDS spending that is development assistance 
has been decreasing in countries of high and extremely 
high prevalence. 
Figure 7 depicts spending, population size, and 
disability-adjusted life-years overall and for HIV/AIDS, 
by income group in 2015. High-income countries 
account for 33·3% (95% UI 30·9–35·8) of total global 
HIV/AIDS spending but comprise 1·3% of the burden, 
as measured by disability-adjusted life-years, and 
9·4% of the people living with HIV globally (figure 7). 
In low-income countries, where 32·8% of HIV/AIDS 
burden occurs and 29·2% of HIV-positive people live, 
spending on HIV/AIDS constitutes 16·4% (15·4–17·5) 
of global spending (figure 7). Compared with all-
health spending, a higher proportion of HIV/AIDS 
spending occurs in low-income and middle-income 
countries (including lower-middle-income and upper-
middle-income countries). High-income countries have 
12·9% of the total health burden and spend 66·3% 
(66·0–66·5) of total health spending, whereas low-
income countries constitute 0·7% (0·7–0·7) of total 
health spending and account for 13·7% of global health 
burden (figure 7).

The ratio of development assistance for health to 
government spending, in 2015, was 1·5 in low-income 
countries and 0·1 in lower-middle-income countries, 
although the ratio of development assistance for HIV/
AIDS to government HIV/AIDS spending was 7·7 for 
low-income countries and 1·9 for lower-middle-income 
countries.
Discussion
From 1995 to 2015, global per capita health spending 
increased substantially. Health spending is on the verge 
of surpassing $10 trillion and accounts for 10% of the 
world’s total economy. The USA alone accounted for 
almost a third of the world’s health spending in 2015—
slightly less than what was spent by all low-income and 
middle-income countries combined. Between 1995 and 
2015, per capita health spending grew the fastest in 
middle-income countries, despite the declines in 
development assistance for health that occurred from 
2010 to 2015. More broadly, development assistance for 
health remained relatively flat since 2013, although 
disbursements to some health focus areas, such as 
HIV/AIDS, have declined.
In recognition of the growing threat of infectious 
disease outbreaks and epidemics in an increasingly inter-
connected world, we tracked development assistance for 
pandemic preparedness for the first time. We expect our 
estimates of development assistance targeted towards 
pandemic preparedness to improve over time as global 
initiatives that address these threats, such as the Global 
Health Security Agenda, become well established. 
According to the World Bank, the estimate of the 
economic and fiscal costs of the Ebola crises in the three 
affected countries—Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone—
was approximately $2·8 billion.25 This estimate signals 
that greater invest 
ment in pandemic preparedness could 
be warranted.
In 1995, 18 million people were living with HIV
/AIDS 
globally and 3 million additional cases emerged each 
year. At its peak in 2005, nearly 2 million people died 
from HIV/AIDS each year. Since 2005, the number of 
new HIV/AIDS cases each year have decreased by 23%, 
the global HIV/AIDS death rate declined by 52%, and 
20·9 million people are now on antiretroviral therapy. 
These historic gains were made partly because of the 
extraordinary amount of resources made available to 
fight HIV/AIDS. Between 2000 and 2015, $562·6 billion 
(531·1 billion to 621·9 billion) was spent to combat the 
disease, with annual growth in HIV
/AIDS spending 
surpassing 10% for many years. International support 
played a key part in the escalation of funding.
Domestic governments also played an important role in 
the fight against HIV
/AIDS, constituting the majority of 
worldwide spending on HIV
/AIDS between 2000 and 
2015. Government resources have continued to grow 
in all income groups while development assistance for 
health for HIV
/AIDS declined. Governments played an 
integral part in the development and advancement of key 
prevention and treatment programmes. Still, in low-
income countries and countries with extremely high 
prevalence, development assistance for health constituted 
most HIV
/AIDS spending, even in 2015.
Unique to HIV
/AIDS is the small share spent out-
of-pocket. Domestic HIV
/AIDS spending is drawn 
predominately from government financing rather than 
being out-of-pocket, the latter of which leaves people 
susceptible to financial instability and impoverishment. 
In 2015, out-of-pocket spending accounted for less than 
10% of HIV spending, smaller than overall out-of-pocket 
spending, which comprised nearly a quarter of total 
health spending. Our analysis suggests international and 
domestic government efforts surrounding HIV
/AIDS 
have a major role in mitigating the financial hardship 
associated with HIV
/AIDS.
Despite the considerable domestic response to 
HIV
/AIDS, many low-income and middle-income 
countries remain dependent on development assistance 
for health to fund HIV
/AIDS programmes. Development 
assistance for health made up most of the total spending 
on HIV
/AIDS in high prevalence (1–5%) countries in 
2015. In extremely high prevalence (>5%) countries, 
development assistance for health comprises half of 
HIV
/AIDS spending. Low-income countries make up 
half of high-prevalence countries and a third of extremely 
high-prevalence countries.26 In low-income and lower-
middle-income countries, the ratio of development 
assistance for health to government spending, for 
HIV
/AIDS, is nearly twenty times higher than the ratio 
of development assistance for health to government 
spending overall. Domestically sourced resources are 
crucial to the long-term sustainability of HIV
/AIDS 
programmes, but governments in low-income countries 
often have constrained fiscal space, generally driven by 
low government revenue. Reliance on development 
assistance for health to fight HIV
/AIDS in these countries 
leaves them susceptible to fluctuations in the external 
resources available for HIV
/AIDS, and puts national 
HIV
/AIDS programmes at risk of gaps in support and 
unrealised investment opportunities.
High-prevalence countries reliant on development 
assistance for health must plan strategically so that 
decreases in external financing do not alter trajectories 
towards ending the transmission of HIV and sustaining 
HIV-positive populations with antiretroviral therapy. 
Ageing HIV-positive populations will continue to need 
antiretroviral therapy to live healthy and productive 
lives. Potential ways to offset declines in external 
HIV/AIDS funding include reallocating more govern-
ment resources to the health sector, reallocating more 
government health resources to HIV/AIDS, or re-
allocating government HIV/AIDS resources to focus on 
the most effective approaches to HIV/AIDS prevention 
or treatment.27,28 Improving the efficiency of antiretroviral 
therapy service provision and integrating HIV/AIDS

programmes into the health system are also potential 
strategies that complement the reductions in treatment 
costs, bolstered by heavily negotiated antiretroviral 
therapy prices, which have transpired in developing 
countries since 2000.29,30 Although this set of options 
suggests there might be multiple means to preserve the 
gains made in curbing the HIV/AIDS epidemic, in 
many contexts these options might not be realistic. The 
government of an average low-income country spent 
less than $25 per person on health in 2015. Reallocating 
government resources to HIV/AIDS might not be 
possible in many cases or would be possible only by 
reducing spending on other health priorities.
Apart from the novel tracking of HIV/AIDS spending, 
our analysis provides further evidence of the wide 
variation in health spending, as well as the disconnect 
between health spending and health burden. Although 
these differences are stark, many factors affect how 
much is spent on health and which diseases are 
prioritised for spending in each country. Factors such as 
access to and price of health care, and efficiency of health 
systems, probably explain some variation in spending 
and prioritisation. Additionally, political and social 
preferences, and the availability of cost-effective 
interventions, govern how many resources are directed 
to the health sector, as well as to which patients and 
diseases. Although we would not expect spending levels 
or health system foci to be commensurate across income 
groups or to merely reflect health burden, we believe 
these discrepancies highlight potential gaps and places 
where more attention should be given to determine if 
health need is being met. We hope this exercise and 
future disease tracking spending studies could help 
parse out the factors associated with disease spending 
and identify how donors and governments can reduce 
financial barriers impeding progress towards important 
health-related goals.
This research takes an initial step towards global 
disease-specific resource tracking, which is essential for 
several reasons. Disease-specific spending estimates 
make a host of new, policy-relevant analyses possible, 
including decomposing the drivers of health spending 
growth,31 quantifying disease-specific spending gaps, and 
assessing the effects of health spending. These estimates 
enable researchers to assess how disease-specific funding 
complements or replaces other health spending. Existing 
evidence shows that development assistance for health 
provided to the government tends to replace domestic 
financing for health.32,33 Finally, decision-makers can use 
estimates of this kind to inform the allocation of 
spending across diseases and other disease-specific 
policies. By combining disease-specific prevalence 
estimates, costing estimates, and spending estimates, 
more precise targets can be constructed and disease-
specific spending gaps could be identified. This is 
important work that is only made possible by ongoing 
global disease-specific resource tracking.
Limitations
Although increasingly granular tracking of health 
spending is advantageous for many reasons, it is not 
without challenges and limitations. The estimates for 
development assistance for health do not capture 
transfers of assistance among middle-income and low-
income countries, largely because of the requirement 
that we capture a complete time series of disbursements 
for each agency we track, and that these data are 
comparable with all other data sources. Publicly available 
data that meet these requirements from low-income and 
middle-income countries are sparse, which is a gap we 
aim to fill in the future. Moreover, some of the input data 
used for parts of this study were not precise and required 
modelling. The input data for total health spending and 
HIV/AIDS spending were, in some cases, contradictory, 
had 
incomplete 
underlying 
documentation, 
and 
included many gaps. It is difficult in some cases for 
health accountants and financing experts to disentangle 
HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis funding, which could affect 
the underlying data used. A greater push and adherence 
to an agreed-upon set of spending definitions and 
methods to track resources would help produce more 
precise and comparable estimates of health spending. It 
is our hope that these estimates help demonstrate the 
use of disease-specific resource tracking studies, and can 
be a catalyst for more investment in global resource 
tracking for health. That approach includes necessary 
investment in low-income and middle-income countries, 
as well as in high-income countries, where the 
internationally consistent tracking for HIV/AIDS 
spending was weakest. The wide UIs surrounding our 
estimates should be a recurring reminder of the need for 
sustained investment in health systems capable of 
disease-specific resource tracking. In addition to tracking 
health spending with more rigour and precision, we 
urge that investments be made in tracking spending 
subnationally to assess, with more accuracy and 
consistency, within-country spending disparities across 
important socioeconomic and geographical stratifiers. 
Many country-specific studies have shown that within-
country health spending varies as substantially as cross-
country estimates, with equally as poignant conclusions.21 
Measuring spending subnationally by disease would be 
valuable for assessing the connection between spending 
patterns and disease-specific health outcomes, including 
avertable mortality.
Conclusion
Even as development assistance for health levels off, 
health spending continues to increase, outpacing 
economic growth in many contexts. With growth steady or 
accelerating, it is more important than ever to understand 
where resources for health go and how they align with 
health needs, particularly because major variation in 
spending persists across countries. Estimates of spending 
on HIV
/AIDS are a step toward better understanding this

variation. The noteworthy increases in spending on HIV
/
AIDS has mitigated, at least at present, a major global 
health crisis. Prevention efforts will remain essential in all 
contexts. However, the vulnerability of low-income and 
high-burden countries to reductions in development 
assistance for health is also a crucial finding, capturing 
the risk posed by future reductions in development 
assistance for health for HIV
/AIDS and the vigilance 
required to ensure UNAIDS Fast-Track Targets and 
SDG target 3.3 are achieved.16,31 Despite these advances in 
health resource tracking, we know little about how 
patterns in HIV
/AIDS spending contrast with spending 
on other disease areas. Estimates for a wider set of 
diseases are needed to fully understand what is being 
purchased, with $9·7 trillion being spent on health in 
2015. It is increasingly important—and possible—to track 
health spending with the precision and granularity to 
inform policy, investigate effectiveness, and identify areas 
where more investment could lead to improved health. 
Disease-specific resource tracking is an essential tool for 
understanding health markets and health policy, and for 
deploying that knowledge to improve health.
