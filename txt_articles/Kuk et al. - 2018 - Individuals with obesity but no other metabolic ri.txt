What is already known about this subject
• Obesity is associated with several metabolic disorders.
• Obesity is associated with mortality risk after statistical adjustment of
several risk factors.
• When Metabolic Healthy Obesity (MHO) is defined as obesity with zero
or one metabolic risk factor, MHO is associated with elevated mortal-
ity risk.
What does this study adds
• MHO, defined as obesity with zero other metabolic risk factors, is not
associated with increased mortality risk.
• MHO, defined as abdominal obesity with zero other metabolic risk fac-
tors, is not associated with increased mortality risk.
• Elevations in metabolic risk factors are much more strongly associated
with mortality risk than obesity.

Summary
Studies have examined mortality risk for metabolically healthy obesity, defined as
zero or one metabolic risk factors but not as zero risk factors. Thus, we sought to
determine the independent mortality risk associated with obesity or elevated glu-
cose, blood pressure or lipids in isolation or clustered together. The sample
included 54 089 men and women from five cohort studies (follow-up = 12.8
� 7.2 years and 4864 [9.0%] deaths). Individuals were categorized as having
obesity or elevated glucose, blood pressure or lipids alone or clustered with obe-
sity or another metabolic factor. In our study sample, 6% of individuals presented
with obesity but no other metabolic abnormalities. General obesity (hazard ratios
[HR], 95% CI = 1.10, 0.8–1.6) and abdominal obesity (HR = 1.24, 0.9–1.7) in
the absence of metabolic risk factors were not associated with mortality risk com-
pared to lean individuals. Conversely, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia in
isolation were significantly associated with mortality risk (HR range = 1.17–1.94,
P < 0.05). However, when using traditional approaches, obesity (HR = 1.12,
1.02–1.23) is independently associated with mortality risk after statistical adjust-
ment for the other metabolic risk factors. Similarly, metabolically healthy obesity,
when defined as zero or one risk factor, is also associated with increased mortality
risk (HR = 1.15, 1.01–1.32) as compared to lean healthy individuals. Obesity in
the absence of metabolic abnormalities may not be associated with higher risk for
all-cause mortality compared to lean healthy individuals. Conversely, elevation of
even a single metabolic risk factor is associated with increased mortality risk.

 Introduction
Obesity often presents in conjunction with several meta-
bolic risk factors, and these factors have been indepen-
dently associated with mortality risk (1–9). Current weight
management guidelines recommend that all individuals
with obesity should be prescribed weight loss, suggesting
that obesity even without other risk factors carries health
risk (10). Recently, metabolically healthy obesity has
become a topic of interest, but its association with mortal-
ity risk is under debate (11–16). One of the issues with the
definition of ‘healthy’, used in most existing studies sug-
gesting that metabolically healthy obesity is associated with
increased mortality risk, is that they may not in fact be
healthy as they allow for obesity in the presence of up to
one of the metabolic risk factors (11–15). This would mean
that individuals with obesity and hypertension, for exam-
ple, could have been categorized as healthy. The recent
study by Caleyachetty et al. (16), which examined metabol-
ically health obesity risk for cardiovascular events in 3.5
million adults, defined healthy as the absence of hyperten-
sion, diabetes and dyslipidaemia but did not exclude indi-
viduals with one or more preclinically elevated risk factors
from being defined as healthy. This means that these
‘healthy’ individuals may present with the metabolic syn-
drome, which is also associated with increased mortality
risk (17). Using the most stringent definition, wherein met-
abolically healthy obesity is defined as no clinical or pre-
clinical
risk
factors,
studies
have
suggested
that
metabolically healthy obesity would account for only 1.3%
of the U.S. population (14). To our knowledge, there are
no studies that examine the mortality risk for metabolically
healthy obesity when defined as having no other clinical or
preclinical metabolic risk factors.
Similarly, while it is clear that a clustering of metabolic
risk factors with or without obesity is associated with ele-
vated mortality risk (18, 19), a single metabolic risk factor
may (20, 21) or may not (18). Previous research suggesting
an independent association between risk factors and mor-
tality has mainly used statistical adjustment for the other
metabolic risk factors (1–9, 18, 20, 21) as opposed to
restricting the sample to only individuals classified as
healthy by the absence of risk factor(s). Sample restriction
or categorization may also be the more clinically relevant
approach to risk assessment but requires a very large sam-
ple size as the prevalence at which obesity and cardiometa-
bolic risk factors occur in isolation are quite low (<10%)
(22). Thus, it is unclear whether these cardiometabolic risk
factors are associated with mortality risk when they occur
in isolation.
To our knowledge, there has been no research examining
the mortality risk associated with preclinical and clinically
elevated levels of obesity, dysglycaemia, dyslipidaemia and
hypertension in isolation. This research is important to
understand risk stratification for treatment. Thus, the main
objective of this study is to examine the association
between obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors when
they occur in isolation and to compare this with other com-
monly used approaches in the literature.
Methods
Participants
This sample includes a merged dataset from the ACLS
(Updated December 31st, 2003), Coronary Artery Risk
Development in Young Adults (CARDIA – Updated April
27th, 2017), Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA
– Updated November 15th, 2016) and National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III and con-
tinuous 1999–2008). All study participants gave their
informed written consent as required by the relevant ethics
boards for each survey. Institutional ethics approval to
analyse this merged dataset was obtained from York Uni-
versity’s Research Ethics Board (e2017–364).
ACLS was available through a research collaboration
with study investigators. Limited data access for CARDIA
and MESA was obtained through the National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of
Health (NIH). This manuscript was prepared using research
materials obtained from the NHLBI Data Repository Infor-
mation Coordinating Center and does not necessarily reflect
the opinions or views of the study survey investigators or

 Oakland, CA (23). Mortality follow-up till December
31, 2011 was used in this analysis.
Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is a longi-
tudinal study of 6800 ethnically diverse (White, Black, His-
panic and Asian) men and women beginning in 1999.
Participants were followed up every 9–12 months to ascer-
tain medical events and mortality status through to exami-
nation 5 (August 2015) was used for these analyses.
Mortality status was confirmed using medical records,
death certificates, interviews, questionnaires and other pro-
cedures (24).
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) III and Continuous are a series of nationally
representative cross-sectional surveys collected using a
stratified, multistage, probability cluster design. NHANES
III was conducted between 1988 and 1994 on 33 994 per-
sons, aged 2 months and older. NHANES continuous
cycles are released biannually, with 1999–2000 (n = 9965),
2001–2002
(n = 11 039),
2003–2004
(n = 10
122),
2005–2006
(n = 9950)
and
2007–2008
(n = 9762)
included in these analyses. Public access Mortality Linkage
data file with follow-up through December 31st, 2011 was
used for these analyses.
Survey methods
Age, gender, ethnicity (White or other), smoking status
(non or current), self-reported medical history and medica-
tions were assessed by questionnaire. BMI (kg m−2) was
calculated from measured weight and height. Standard
BMI cut-offs for normal weight (NW: 18.5 to 24.9 kg m−2),
overweight (OW: 25 to 29.9 kg m−2) and obese (OB:
≥30 kg m−2) were used. Waist circumference (WC) was
assessed by trained technicians.
Obesity and metabolic factor measurements
The following cut-off points were used to classify factors
into low, moderate and higher risk categories using stan-
dard Normal, Preclinical and Clinical cut-offs, respectively
(Table 1) (25, 26). The ‘No RF’ group was defined as being
low risk for all other metabolic risk factor categories and
was free of obesity. Hypertension was categorized as
exceeding the clinical cut-offs for blood pressure, as given
in Table 1. Diabetes was categorized as exceeding the clini-
cal cut-offs for glucose, as given in Table 1. Dyslipidaemia
was categorized as exceeding the clinical cut-offs for HDL
and triglycerides, as given in Table 1.
Statistical analysis
Generalized linear mixed models (Proc Glimmix, SAS v9.4,
Cary, NC) were used to examine differences in means and
prevalence. Cox proportional hazards regression was used
to estimate hazard ratios (HR) to examine differences in
all-cause mortality across metabolic risk groups adjusted
for age, gender, smoking status and ethnicity. For each
model, the groups were divided into healthy, preclinical
and clinically elevated risk factors according to BMI, glu-
cose, blood pressure or lipids and were then further divided
into the presence or absence of the other risk factors, with
the healthy–no risk factors (lowest risk) category being the
referent group (HR = 1.00). Proportionality assumptions
for the mortality analyses were assessed using graphical
methods. All analyses allowed for random intercepts to
account for variation between study samples.
To allow for comparisons with previous studies, two sets
of analyses were conducted. First, the relationship between
metabolic factors and mortality was assessed when metaboli-
cally healthy was defined as having zero or only one risk fac-
tor, with men and women collapsed while adjusting for age,
smoking status, ethnicity and follow-up time. Second, a sin-
gle model examining the independent associations between
high-risk glucose, lipids, blood pressure and obesity was con-
ducted. Statistical significance was set at alpha = 0.05.
Results
Characteristics of participants stratified by risk profile are
shown in Table 2. Within the entire sample, 16.7% of par-
ticipants were free from all preclinical or clinical metabolic
abnormalities and obesity, while 52.0% of the sample had
more than one metabolic risk factor or obesity. Among
those with obesity, 5.8% of individuals did not present
with any other risk factors. Participants who were classified
as having one preclinical or clinical risk factor (i.e. glucose,
blood pressure or lipid) or obesity alone ranged from 1.2
to 21.7%. During the 12.8 � 7.2-year follow-up, there
were 4864 (9.0%) deaths. The NoRF and Obesity Only
groups tended to be younger and had the lowest incidences
of death of all groups.
The associations between obesity, metabolic status and
mortality risk are shown in Fig. 1. Obesity (HR, 95% CI =
1.10, 0.8–1.6) without other metabolic risk factors was
not associated with increased mortality risk as compared to
lean healthy individuals, but obesity was associated with
higher risk for mortality when in combination with at least
one other factor (HR range: 1.33–1.80, P < 0.05, Fig. 1) as
compared to lean healthy individuals. In contrast, diabetes

(HR = 1.36, 1.1–1.7), hypertension (HR = 1.64, 1.4–1.9)

ated with increased HR of all-cause mortality as compared
to their healthy counterparts. Furthermore, the mortality

 associated with mortality (HR = 1.24, 0.9–1.7, P = 0.16,
Fig. 2) as compared to healthy low-waist individuals.
When metabolically healthy was defined as zero or one
metabolic risk factor as done in previous research, meta-
bolically healthy obesity was associated with increased
mortality risk as compared to healthy lean (HR = 1.15,
1.01–1.32). In a model with all of the risk factors, obesity
(HR = 1.12, 1.02–1.23), diabetes (HR = 1.13, 1.05–1.21),
hypertension (HR = 1.21, 1.12–1.32) and dyslipidaemia
(HR = 1.17, 1.07–1.28) were independently associated
with all-cause mortality.
Discussion
Results of this analysis illustrate that obesity in the absence
of metabolic risk factors may not be associated with higher
mortality risk than lean healthy individuals. This is in con-
trast to previous studies that have suggested that obesity is
independently associated with mortality risk (14, 15, 27,
28). These differences may, in part, be related to how meta-
bolically ‘healthy’ has been defined in the past due to con-
straints related to sample size as obesity in the absence of
other metabolic risk factors is rare (14). In contrast with
obesity, we observe that other common metabolic risk fac-
tors
in
isolation
are
associated
with
all-cause
mortality risk.
In the literature, the association between obesity and
mortality risk independent of commonly observed comor-
bidities such as diabetes, hypertension or dyslipidaemia is
most commonly demonstrated using a single model with
statistical adjustment for the other health risk factors as
continuous variables in the same model (18–21, 29, 30) or
as categorical variables (High and low risk) (20, 21, 29,
30). When we used statistical adjustment, we also observe
that obesity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes were
all independently associated with mortality risk. When

Metabolic healthy obesity and mortality risk

clinical obesity
 using the stratified analysis, which is more akin to risk
stratification approaches in clinical care, we demonstrate
that the metabolic variables in isolation, but not obesity,
were associated with all-cause mortality as compared to
their healthy counterparts. We also demonstrate that
preclinically elevated risk factors in isolation were not asso-
ciated with mortality risk with the exception of pre-hyper-
tension. This is in line with the metabolic syndrome
concept (17) in that the clustering of preclinical risk factors
is associated with increased risk.
A systematic review and meta-analysis by Kramer et al.
(15) report that metabolically healthy obesity is associated
with increased mortality risk. However, one of the major
limitations of our previous work and other published
research on metabolically healthy obesity is that individuals
with obesity and one (or more) metabolic risk factor(s)
were still considered healthy (11–15). This is clearly prob-
lematic as the current study demonstrates that diabetes,
dyslipidaemia, hypertension and even pre-hypertension in
isolation are associated with increased mortality risk. Thus,
allowing for individuals with risk factors to be included in
the definition of healthy may have incorrectly inflated the
mortality risk associated with this group.
Previous studies have reported that metabolically healthy
obesity, defined as no risk factors, may be as low as 0.4%
(22), and thus, those studies may have elected to use this
more lenient definition of healthy due to sample size issues.
In our study, only 1.2% of individuals presented with obe-
sity and remained free of all clinical and preclinical risk fac-
tors. Thus, this study with over 50 000 individuals and
nearly 5000 mortality events represents one of the first few
sufficiently large studies to date to properly examine mortal-
ity risk in metabolically healthy obesity. In contrast to previ-
ous research, we demonstrate that obesity alone, without
the presence of other preclinical or clinical metabolic risk
factors, is not associated with elevated mortality risk in men
or women. It is suggested by others (15) that individuals
with metabolically healthy obesity are at increased mortal-
ity risk as they are more likely than their normal-weight
counterparts to transition to unhealthy over time. Our study
used a single risk assessment, and changes in obesity and the
risk profile over the 13 year follow-up were not captured.
However, changes in metabolic status would theoretically
elevate the mortality risk with the metabolic healthy obesity
group. That we saw no differences in mortality risk by BMI
in the healthy group may suggest that the true mortality risk

Metabolic healthy obesity and mortality risk
J. L. Kuk et al.

 for the metabolically healthy obesity group that remains
free of metabolic risk factors over time could be lower than
what we report: the obesity paradox (31).
Diabetes, dyslipidaemia and hypertension have been
widely accepted and regularly reviewed clinical criteria and
cut-offs for diagnosis. However, obesity has only been
recently recognized as a chronic disease by the World
Health Organization (32) and the American Medical Asso-
ciation (33). This change acknowledges the unique aetiol-
ogy and health consequences of obesity that necessitates
the development of appropriate medical interventions and
treatments. In these reports, obesity is generally described
as the presence of abnormal or excess body fat that impairs
health (33). However, many current weight management
guidelines do not make the distinction between excess body
fat that does or does not impair health and simply diagnose
obesity using a BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg m−2.
There is much research suggesting that the deleterious
effects of obesity are more closely associated with abdomi-
nal obesity (34). However, even when using WC, the asso-
ciation between obesity and mortality risk remained non-
significant, and the magnitude of the risk estimates were
not substantially different using WC versus BMI. Thus,
whether abdominal obesity should be central to risk cri-
teria, such as some metabolic syndrome criteria (35) or the
hypertriglyceridemic waist (36), is unclear.
Current clinical weight management guidelines prescribe
weight loss for all individuals with obesity as defined by a
BMI > 30 kg m−2 regardless of their metabolic status (10).
If the deleterious effects of obesity occur predominantly
through changes in these other metabolic risk factors, then
this would support risk algorithms such as the Edmonton
Obesity Staging System, which suggest a triaged approach
that only recommends weight loss for individuals with obe-
sity
who
have
physical,
functional,
or
psychological
obesity-related comorbidities (37). However, if abdominal
or overall obesity does carry independent risk, then this
would support current guidelines suggesting that weight
loss should be recommended for all individuals with obe-
sity regardless of their health profile (38). In our study sam-
ple, 6% of individuals with obesity presented without any
other risk factors and were not at significantly elevated
mortality risk as compared to healthy lean individuals.
Thus, it is unclear whether these individuals with metaboli-
cally healthy obesity would benefit from weight loss. Fur-
thermore, given the low success rates for obesity reduction
(39, 40) and the stigma and bias experienced by those
struggling with obesity (41), it may be particularly impor-
tant to confirm whether obesity itself is associated with
increased morbidity and mortality risk or reduced quality
of
life
outcomes.
Furthermore,
whether
metabolically
healthy individuals with obesity benefit from weight loss in
terms of physical, functional, psychological and metabolic
outcomes needs to be confirmed in future research.
The strengths and limitations of this study warrant men-
tion. First, this study uses a harmonized sample from five
separate well-established cohort studies. With this large
sample, we were able to examine the mortality risk associ-
ated with obesity, glucose, blood pressure and lipids in iso-
lation or clustered together. Although the methods used
between studies were not identical and were conducted
over a long time span, they did use standardized and clini-
cally accepted methodologies for the measures used here,
and the statistical analyses used accommodated for some of
the potential differences between the studies. However,
socioeconomic status, medications, physical activity and
diet were not consistently captured between surveys and
may have confounded results observed. It is unclear
whether individuals with metabolically healthy obesity also
had better lifestyle factors, higher socioeconomic status,
better medical care or other factors that may have con-
founded the results. Although the models were adjusted for
white ethnicity, we did not examine other ethnicities as it
was not always captured in a way that would allow us to
use ethnic-specific guidelines for obesity or metabolic risk
factors. Finally, this study was limited to the examination
of all-cause mortality, and it may be expected that the asso-
ciations may be stronger with cardiovascular disease mor-
tality or quality of life measures.
Summary
In conclusion, we suggest that obesity in the absence of
metabolic abnormalities is not associated with increased
risk for all-cause mortality as compared to normal weight
individuals.
