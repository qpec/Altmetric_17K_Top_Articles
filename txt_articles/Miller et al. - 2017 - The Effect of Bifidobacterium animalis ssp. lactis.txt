Abstract: Elderly people have increased susceptibility to infections and cancer that are associated
with decline in cellular immune function. The objective of this work was to determine the efficacy
of Bifidobacterium (B.) animalis ssp. lactis HN019 (HN019) supplementation on cellular immune
activity in healthy elderly subjects. We conducted a systematic review of Medline and Embase for
controlled trials that reported polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell phagocytic capacity or natural killer
(NK) cell tumoricidal activity following B. lactis HN019 consumption in the elderly. A random effects
meta-analysis was performed with standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval
between probiotic and control groups for each outcome. A total of four clinical trials were included in
this analysis. B. lactis HN019 supplementation was highly efficacious in increasing PMN phagocytic
capacity with an SMD of 0.74 (95% confidence interval: 0.38 to 1.11, p < 0.001) and moderately
efficacious in increasing NK cell tumoricidal activity with an SMD of 0.43 (95% confidence interval:
0.08 to 0.78, p = 0.02). The main limitations of this research were the small number of included studies,
short-term follow-up, and assessment of a single probiotic strain. In conclusion, daily consumption
of B. lactis HN019 enhances NK cell and PMN function in healthy elderly adults.

1. Introduction
Globally, elderly people represent the fastest growing population. Older individuals have typically
weaker immune responses to vaccination and elevated risk for infections, certain autoimmune diseases,
and cancer [1]. Many of these health risks are a consequence of declining immune function associated
with the aging process, i.e., immunosenescence [2]. Traditional hallmarks of immunosenescence include
adaptive immunity components such as lower number and/or proportions of peripheral blood naïve
T cells (cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8+)), increased number of memory/effector cytotoxic T cells
(CD8+) [3], as well as altered capacity of peripheral blood T cells to proliferate and secrete cytokines [1].
Furthermore, B-cell function and quantity appear to decline with age [4]. Age-related alterations have
also been reported for innate immune system and specifically for function of neutrophils and natural
killer (NK) cells. Neutrophils, which are important for early immune response for infections, show
decreased chemotaxis, phagocytic activity, and declined superoxide generation in the elderly [5,6].
Polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells in the blood are mostly neutrophils (90%–95%), together with smaller
fraction of eosinophils and basophils. The number of NK-cells increases with age, but their signaling
efficiency, cytokine production, and up regulation of co-stimulatory molecules is suboptimal, leading
to a net decrease in function [7–9]. It has been suggested that underlying defect of the declined innate

cellular function in the elderly may be a result of decreased sensitivity of toll like receptor (TLR)
signaling that is important in recognizing microbial structures [10]. These changes in immune function
may compromise the early recognition and elimination of virus infected and malignant cells [2].
Gut microbiota plays an important role in immunosenescence and is influenced by physiological
aging process, lifestyle, and diet [11–14]. It has been shown that aging gut microbiota has specific
features compared to microbiota of younger adults—like lower levels of bifidobacteria and higher
levels of Bacteroidetes spp. [12,14]. The above changes in microbiota composition may be indicative of
dysbiosis and poorer health. For instance, lower bifidobacteria levels have been found to associate
with increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea [15], hospitalization [16], antibiotic
treatment [17], and frailty [18]. Thus, targeted dietary interventions that restore composition of the
microbiota could reduce the risk of age related morbidities and improve the quality of the life of
the elderly.
It has been suggested that probiotic bacteria could have potential for improving immune system
function in the elderly [19]. Probiotics are known to interact with TLRs and other microbial pattern
recognition receptors on immune system cells in intestinal mucosa and thus directly influence their
functions [20]. Furthermore, specific probiotic strains may induce beneficial changes in the gut
microbiota that have an impact on immune status. For instance, B. longum strains induced changes in
the bifidobacteria population, which correlated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin
(IL)-10 levels in plasma [21], and Lactobacillus (L.) casei and L. plantarum strains improved influenza
virus vaccination responses in the elderly [22,23]. Although there are some clinical trials investigating
probiotics and their effectiveness in improving immune responses in the elderly [19], systematic
information on strain-specific effects of probiotics on the immunity in this population is lacking. One of
the probiotics applied in clinical studies in this area is Bifidobacterium (B.) animalis ssp. lactis HN019.
The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled studies was to evaluate the
effect of B. lactis HN019 versus non-probiotic control on cellular innate immune activity of healthy
elderly subjects.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Literature Search
The study was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [24]. Medline and Embase databases were searched for randomized
or non-randomized controlled studies published in English-language journals that reported PMN
cell phagocytosis activity or NK cell tumoricidal activity following B. lactis HN019 consumption in
reportedly healthy, elderly (≥60 years) adults. No date restrictions were applied to the searches.
The details of the Medline search strategy are listed in Table 1. The syntax for Embase was similar,
but adapted as necessary. Additionally, manual searches were conducted using the Directory of Open
Access Journals, Google Scholar, and the reference lists of included papers and relevant meta-analyses.
The final search was conducted in June 2016.
2.2. Study Selection
One reviewer selected studies for inclusion in the review. Articles were then independently
assessed by a second reviewer, who confirmed eligibility. Titles and abstracts were initially screened to
exclude non-English manuscripts, review articles, commentaries, letters, case reports, animal studies,
and obvious irrelevant studies. Full-texts of the remaining articles were retrieved and reviewed.

2.3. Data Extraction
Data were independently extracted from eligible articles by two reviewers. Data extraction
discrepancies between the reviewers were resolved by consensus. The types of data recorded in the
standardized data extraction forms included general manuscript information, subject characteristics,
study characteristics, PMN phagocytic capacity, and NK cell tumoricidal activity. Potential sources
of bias were assessed by evaluating randomization, blinding, type of control, and main outcome
definitions among studies.
2.4. Data Synthesis
A random effects meta-analysis model was developed based on the a priori assumption that
treatment effects would be heterogeneous among studies. For each outcome, a pooled standardized
mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval were calculated. For reference, SMD values of
0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 are defined as small, medium, large, and very large effect sizes, respectively [25].
Forest plots were used to illustrate individual study findings and pooled meta-analysis results.
Heterogeneity of effects across studies was planned to be estimated using the I2 statistic if at least
10 studies were included in the meta-analysis. p-values were two-sided with a significance level
<0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-analysis version 2.2 (Biostat,
Englewood, NJ, USA).
3. Results
The initial database search retrieved 82 titles and abstracts; hand searching relevant bibliographies
identified three additional records. After screening records for inclusion criteria, 74 records were
deemed irrelevant and 11 full text articles were reviewed for eligibility. Ultimately, four studies [26–29]
were included in the final analysis. A flow diagram of study identification and selection is shown in

Regarding the evaluation of B. lactis HN019 relative to control, one study [28] was a randomized 
trial with a parallel control group and three studies [26,27,29] used a 3‐week run‐in period as the 
control. Subjects in each study were healthy elderly adults with a median age between 60 and 70 
years. The interventions evaluated were daily consumption of low‐fat milk, with or without B. lactis 
HN019. The daily dosages of B. lactis HN019 ranged from 5 × 109 to 3 × 1011 colony forming units (cfu) 
and the treatment durations ranged from 3 to 6 weeks (Table 2). An assessment of potential sources 
of bias are listed in Table 3. One study [28] utilized random allocation and two studies [26,28] blinded 
subjects to the allocated intervention. The main outcome definitions were consistent across studies 
and, therefore, pooling data among studies was appropriate.

Phagocytic capacity outcomes were consistent among individual studies (SMD range: 0.60 to
1.01). Furthermore, each study reported statistically significant improvements in PMN phagocytic
capacity with B. lactis HN019 relative to control. The pooled SMD for PMN phagocytic capacity was
0.74 (95% CI: 0.38 to 1.11, p < 0.001), representing a large treatment effect in favor of B. lactis HN019

4. Discussion
With modern life-style the human life expectancy is increasing and the health in old age is of
increasing concern to individuals and society. It has been suggested that probiotic supplementation
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 191

could offer means to reverse some age-related changes in intestinal microflora composition and
to help maintain the aging immune system that are associated with age-related morbidities [30].
Despite the potential benefits of the probiotics for the elderly, the efficacy of only few probiotic strains
on immune function in this population has been tested in clinical studies. This systematic review
and meta-analysis reports the efficacy of B. lactis HN019 on PMN phagocytic capacity and NK cell
tumoricidal activity in healthy elderly subjects. The final analysis included four controlled clinical
trials with variable designs, doses, and treatment durations. The outcomes in these studies included
either PMN phagocytic capacity or NK cell tumor killing activity or both. The pooled data showed
that short-term, 3 to 6 weeks, consumption of B. lactis HN019 resulted in significantly enhanced PMN
phagocytic capacity and NK cell tumoricidal activity in the healthy elderly population.
Three independent clinical studies assessing the effect of B. lactis HN019 on PMN phagocytic
capacity were included in this study [27–29]. Although the number of subjects in the trials was
modest (Table 2), all consistently showed statistically significant effect (p < 0.05) on phagocytic capacity.
The meta-analysis of the trials showed that HN019 had a large treatment effect (p < 0.001) on phagocytic
capacity of PMN cells (Figure 2), confirming the original study findings. Whether the improvement
in PMN function by HN019 leads to better resistance to infections was not studied in the original
publications. However, it is recognized that phagocytosis is a first-line defense function of PMN cells
against infectious diseases that are found more prevalent in the elderly population [31,32].
Previously published studies on the effect of probiotics on phagocytosis have reported that daily
consumption of B. lactis Bi-07 improved the phagocytic activity of monocytes and granulocytes in
healthy elderly adults [33], but in contrast, supplementation with L. johnsonii La1 decreased phagocytic
activity of neutrophils in the elderly [34]. As intestinal bifidobacteria count decreases with age [12,14],
it is noteworthy that two different bifidobacteria strains Bi-07 and HN019 were efficacious whereas
the lactobacillus strain was not, however, the data is very limited to make any conclusions on the
differences in the efficacy on the genera level. In fact, a recent consensus paper concluded that the
effects of probiotics on immune function are strain-specific [35].
Whereas PMN phagocytosis and NK-cell cytotoxicity are key immune functions against infections,
NK cells function also in the elimination of cancerous cells. This study included three clinical trials that
investigated the effect of B. lactis HN019 on NK-cell tumoricidal activity, but none showed statistically
significant results in the original publications [26,27,29]. However, the group sizes were relatively small
and pooling the data in this meta-analysis resulted in a statistically significant (p = 0.017) treatment
effect for improving NK-cell activity in the elderly (Figure 3). Although the result shows improvement
in NK-cell activity, it remains to be studied if the improved function by B. lactis HN019 results in
health benefit for the elderly. Nevertheless, research in the elderly shows that low NK cell activity
is associated with the development of infectious diseases [7,36]. Also, the incidence of cancer and
mortality rate has been found higher in populations with a low NK cell activity compared with those
with higher NK cell activities [36–38].
Effect of other probiotics than HN019 studies have also been investigated on NK cell activity.
A combination of L. rhamnosus HN001 and L. acidophilus NCFM resulted in a significantly increased
cytotoxicity of the NK cells [39]. In contrast, B. longum BB536 intake for 12 weeks had no effect on NK
cell activity in elderly patients fed by enteral tube feeding [40] and L. gasseri TMC0356 supplementation
for 4 weeks had no significant impact on NK cell counts or NK cell activity [41]. Altogether three
studies have assessed the effect of L. casei Shirota on NK cell function: (i) Takeda and colleagues
showed that L. casei Shirota may elevate NK cell activity after 4 weeks when compared to placebo [42];
(ii) the consumption of L. casei Shirota was associated with a significant increase in NK cell activity
relative to baseline, however the difference was not significant when compared with placebo [43]; and
(iii) a study showed that NK-cell activity was not significantly augmented by a 3-week intake of L. casei
Shirota [44]. In summary, the results on probiotic efficacy on NK cell activity in the elderly vary and
may be strain and study dependent.

Although the impact of B. lactis HN019 on specific cellular immune parameters seems relatively
clear there were still limitations inherent in the findings of this meta-analysis, including a potential
for bias due to relatively small study populations. In addition, the study outcomes may have been
affected by other factors such as the length of intervention, the formula, and the supplementation dose.
In the studies included in this meta-analysis, the B. lactis HN019 supplementation was given to healthy
elderly adulty for 3–6 weeks suggesting that relatively short term consumption of B. lactis HN019
has an impact on immune cell function in blood; however, it remains unknown if the stimulatory
effect would have been maintained in longer term consumption [45]. The daily B. lactis HN019 doses
were between 5 × 1010 and 3 × 1011 cfu/day in PMN studies and 5 × 109–5 × 1010 cfu/day in NK
cell studies, suggesting that HN019 is efficacious with a range of doses typically used in dietary
supplements. In all the B. lactis HN019 clinical trials low-fat milk was used as a delivery vehicle, and as
such, no firm conclusions on the role of the vehicle on these immune outcomes can be drawn. A further
consideration relates to type of control. The study by Arunachalam et al. [28] used a parallel group
assigned to placebo, whereas the other three studies [26,27,29] utilized a run-in period control. Due to
a small number of included studies, subgroup analysis and meta-regression to investigate sources of
heterogeneity in outcomes (e.g., type of control, study duration, patient age) was not possible. Finally,
since this report was focused on a single probiotic strain, the results cannot be generalized to probiotics
as a whole.
5. Conclusions
The findings from this meta-analysis suggest that daily short-term consumption of probiotic
B. lactis HN019 enhances PMN phagocytic capacity and NK cell tumoricidal activity in healthy elderly
adults. As the health of the elderly was not assessed in the original studies, the correlation between
B. lactis HN019 mediated PMN and NK cell activity improvement and resistance to infection and
diseases remains to be confirmed in future trials.
