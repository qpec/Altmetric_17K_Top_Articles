Empirical Article
The term Mediterranean diet refers to dietary patterns 
found in olive-growing areas of the Mediterranean region. 
Although some heterogeneity in traditional patterns of 
food consumption exists in these countries, there are also 
common features, such as consumption of abundant 
plant foods (e.g., high intake of fruits, nuts, vegetables, 
bread, pulses, potatoes, seeds, cereals, and pasta), fresh 
and varied fruits as the main and usual dessert, olive oil 
as the main source of fat and commonly used for salads 
and cooking, frequent consumption of fish, moderate 
wine consumption with meals, low amounts of meat 
(mainly poultry instead of beef and pork), and low to 
moderate consumption of dairy products.
The beneficial role of the Mediterranean diet in several 
diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Estruch et al., 
2013), cancer (Schwingshackl & 
  
Hoffmann, 2014), Type 2 
Diabetes (T2D) (Koloverou, Esposito, Giugliano, & Panagio-
takos, 2014), or dementia (Singh et al., 2014) has been exten-
sively evaluated and confirmed.
Furthermore, other nonnutritional aspects such as 
social, cultural, economic, and environmental features 
have been suggested to contribute to the beneficial 
effects attributed to the Mediterranean dietary pattern. 
Thus, cultural and nutritional aspects, jointly with regular 
physical activity, are fundamental parts of this compre-
hensive Mediterranean model of lifestyle (Donini, Serra-
Majem, Bulló, Gil, & Salas-Salvadó, 2015).

depression has already been evaluated through several

Abstract
This research assessed the association between the adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle beyond the Mediterranean 
diet and the risk of depression in a prospective cohort of Spanish university graduates. Through a dynamic cohort study 
method, diet was assessed with a validated semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire. The baseline assessment 
included a validated questionnaire on physical activity and average time spent with friends (socializing). Mediterranean 
lifestyle was defined as the joint exposure to Mediterranean diet, level of physical activity, and level of socializing. 
After a median follow-up of 8.5 years, 806 cases of depression among 11,800 participants were observed. Participants 
with the highest adherence to the Mediterranean lifestyle showed a 50% relative risk reduction in depression risk as 
compared to those participants with the lowest adherence (multivariable hazard ratio = 0.50; 95% confidence interval = 
[0.32, 0.81]). The Mediterranean lifestyle might reduce depression risk in the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra 
cohort study beyond the known effects of the Mediterranean diet.

observational and experimental epidemiological studies 
(Rienks, Dobson, & Mishra, 2013; Sánchez-Villegas et al., 
2013; Sánchez-Villegas et al., 2015; Skarupski, Tangney, 
Li, Evans, & Morris, 2013), to our knowledge there are no 
studies that have analyzed the Mediterranean lifestyle 
(beyond diet and including other features such as physi-
cal activity or social aspects) and its relationship with 
depression risk. Thus, the aim of our analysis was to lon-
gitudinally assess the association between the adherence 
to an overall Mediterranean lifestyle and the risk of 
depression in a cohort of a Spanish university graduates, 
the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) Project.
Materials and Methods
Study population
The SUN Project is a prospective, dynamic cohort study, 
initiated in December 1999 in Spain. The sample com-
prises Spanish university graduates. Its methods have 
been previously described elsewhere (Martínez-González, 
2006; Seguí-Gómez, de la Fuente, Vázquez, de Irala, & 
Martínez-González, 2006). Information is gathered bien-
nially by mailed or Web-based questionnaires referred to 
as Q2 for the 2-year follow-up, Q4 for the 4-year follow-
up, and so on until the Q14, which was completed by 
participants after the 14-year follow-up. The overall 
retention in the cohort approaches 90%.
Up to June 2014, 22,045 participants had completed 
the baseline questionnaire of the SUN Project. Partici-
pants who were lost to follow-up, who had not com-
pleted at least one follow-up questionnaire, who were 
outside of predefined limits for baseline total energy 
intake (less than 800 Kcal/day or more than 4,000 Kcal/
day in men, and less than 500 Kcal/day or more than 
3,500 Kcal/day in women), and participants with missing 
values in the variables of interest were excluded from 
the analyses. We also excluded those participants who 
were users of antidepressant medication at baseline or 
had reported a present or previous history of clinical 
diagnosis of depression at baseline. Finally, 11,800 par-
ticipants were included in the prospective analyses for 
the present study.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board of the University of Navarra. Written informed con-
sent was not requested from the participants. Voluntary 
completion of the first questionnaire was considered to 
imply informed consent.
Exposure assessment
Mediterranean diet. Dietary intake was assessed at 
baseline with a 136-item, validated, semiquantitative food-
frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (De la Fuente-Arrillaga, 
Vázquez Ruiz, Bes-Rastrollo, Sampson, & Martinez-
González, 2010; Fernandez-Ballart et al., 2009). Nutrient 
intakes were calculated as frequency multiplied by nutri-
ent composition of specified portion size for each food 
item using an ad hoc computer program specifically 
developed for this aim. A trained dietician updated the 
nutrient database using the latest available information 
included in food composition tables for Spain.
Mediterranean diet was defined a priori as follows: For 
each food or nutrient, we fitted a regression model in 
which total energy intake was the independent variable 
and each food or nutrient was the dependent variable. 
Residuals for each variable were standardized. These nutri-
ents and foods were daily consumption of legumes, cere-
als (including bread and potatoes), fruit, vegetables, meat 
and meat products, milk and dairy products, fish, and 
trans fatty acids. Moreover, the ratio of monounsaturated 
to saturated fatty acids was also directly standardized as a 
z value. For scoring moderate alcohol consumption, a 
transformation centered at the level of consuming 30 g/
day for men (30-absolute value [30-alcohol intake]) and 
20 g/day for women (20-absolute value [20-alcohol intake]) 
was used to obtain the highest value for men consuming 
30 g/day or women consuming 20 g/day and progressive 
lower values as the consumption was lower or higher than 
these values. The results of these transformations of alco-
hol intake were also standardized as z values. The final 
score was the sum of standardized residuals of items con-
sidered favorable minus the standardized residuals of 
items considered unfavorable. The total score for the Med-
iterranean diet weighted favorably the consumption of 
legumes, cereals, fruits, vegetables, fish, moderate con-
sumption of alcohol, and the ratio of monounsaturated to 
saturated fats and weighted unfavorably the consumption 
of meats and dairy products and trans fatty acids. The final 
score was converted to relative percentage of adherence 
using the range of values of the sample. A participant with 
the maximum value of adherence in the sample obtained 
100% of adherence. A participant with a minimum value of 
adherence obtained 0% in the relative percentage (Beunza 
et al., 2010; Sánchez-Villegas, Martínez, De Irala, & 
 
Martínez-González, 2002). Finally, the relative percentage 
was categorized into tertiles.
Physical activity. The baseline questionnaire (Q0) 
included a leisure-time physical activity questionnaire col-
lecting information about 17 activities. Average time spent 
in physical activity variables was measured on a 10-point 
frequency scale (none to more than 11 hours per week), 
combined with a 3-point scale reflecting number of 
months per year (<3, 3–6, >6) that the activity was under-
taken. To quantify the volume of activity during leisure 
time, an activity metabolic equivalent (MET) index was 
computed. We assigned a multiple of resting metabolic

rate (MET score) to each activity based on existing litera-
ture (Ainsworth et al., 2011). Time spent in each of the 
activities was multiplied by the MET score specific to each 
activity and then summed over all activities to obtain a 
value of overall weekly MET hours. Finally, the continu-
ous variable was categorized into tertiles. Leisure-time 
physical activity estimated using the questionnaire was 
previously validated in a Spanish sample using a triaxial 
accelerometer as the gold standard. Leisure-time physical 
activity (estimated as MET hours per week) derived from 
the questionnaire moderately correlated with kilocalories 
per day assessed through the accelerometer (Spearman’s 
r = 0.507, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.232, 0.707], 
p < .001) (Martínez-González, López-Fontana, Varo, 
 
Sánchez-Villegas, & Martinez, 2005).
Social activity/socializing. Average time spent with 
friends in the previous year was measured at baseline with 
a question with 11 possible answers, ranging from none to 
more than 9 hours per week in a typical week day or in a 
typical weekend day. We multiplied the first number of 
hours by 5 and the second by 2 and then divided the total 
by 7 to obtain mean hours per day spent hanging out with 
friends and then categorized them in tertiles.
Total activity level. Additionally, physical and socializing 
activities were analyzed together as total activity. Level of 
total activity was categorized into four categories (low, 
medium, high, and very high) according to participants’ 
tertile distribution for the two activity variables. For exam-
ple, those participants in the lowest tertile for both activities 
or in the first tertile for one and in the middle tertile for the 
other were included in the low category. Thus, the groups 
were created as follows—low: T1 and T1, T1 and T2, or T2 
and T1; medium: T1 and T3, T3 and T1, or T2 and T2; high: 
T2 and T3 or T3 and T2; and very high: T3 and T3.
Mediterranean lifestyle. A participant was considered 
with high adherence to the Mediterranean lifestyle if he 
or she reported a high adherence to the Mediterranean 
diet, a high level of physical activity, and a high level of 
socializing. Only participants in the highest tertile of the 
three exposure variables were included in this category. 
Contrarily, if the participant belonged to the lowest tertile 
of adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the lowest 
tertiles of physical activity and socializing, he or she was 
included in the low Mediterranean lifestyle category. The 
rest of the possible combinations were considered as 
medium adherence to this lifestyle.
Outcome assessment
Incident cases of depression were defined as participants 
who were free of any previous history of depression at 
baseline; were not using any antidepressant treatment at 
baseline; positively responded to the question, “Have you 
ever been diagnosed with depression by a medical doc-
tor?”; or reported the habitual use of antidepressant drugs 
in any of the seven biennial follow-up questionnaires 
(Q2 to Q14). Although antidepressants could have been 
prescribed for conditions other than depression, this situ-
ation is extremely unusual in Spain. So we considered 
both the use of antidepressants and physician diagnosis 
as valid criteria to operationally define incident cases of 
depression.
The self-reported diagnosis of depression performed 
by a physician was validated in a subsample of our 
cohort using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th 
edition) by an expert psychiatrist as the gold standard. 
The percentages of confirmed depression and nonde-
pression were 74.2% (95% CI = [63.3, 85.1]) and 81.1% 
(95% CI = [69.1, 92.9]), respectively (Sánchez- 
Villegas 
et al., 2008).
Other covariates
Energy intake was also calculated through the informa-
tion collected from the semiquantitative FFQ adminis-
tered 
at 
baseline. 
Information 
regarding 
sociodemographic 
(e.g., sex, age, marital status, employment status) and 
lifestyle-related variables (e.g., smoking status, supple-
ment use, special diets) was obtained from the baseline 
questionnaire.
Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as weight (in 
kilograms) divided by the square of height (in meters) 
using data collected at baseline.
The prevalence and history of CVD, cancer, dyslipidae-
mia, hypertension, T2D, and obesity was also collected.
Statistical methods
The distribution of several baseline characteristics of the 
participants according to the main variables of the analy-
sis is presented as percentages (categorical variables) or 
means and standard deviations (numerical variables). For 
each participant we computed person–years of follow-up 
from the date of returning the baseline questionnaire to 
the date of depression diagnosis, the date of death, or the 
date of returning the last follow-up questionnaire, which-
ever came first. Cox proportional-hazards regression 
models were fitted to assess the relationship between 
each exposure variable (diet, physical activity, socializ-
ing, and total activity) and the incidence of depression 
during follow-up. Hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% CIs 
were calculated considering the lowest tertiles as the ref-
erence categories. To control for potential confounding 
factors, the analyses were adjusted for sex, age (years,

continuous), BMI (Kg/m2, continuous), smoking (non-
smoker, ex-smoker, current smoker, missing), special diet 
at baseline, total energy intake (Kcal/day, continuous), 
and the presence of several diseases at baseline (CVD, 
T2D, and hypertension). An indicator variable for missing 
responses (n = 131) was created for smoking. Other con-
founding factors, such as marital status, special diets, 
employment status, or presence of cancer or dyslipidae-
mia at baseline, were also explored but not included in 
the final models, as they showed no evidence of intro-
ducing any relevant confounding influence. Moreover, 
each exposure was also adjusted for the others in an 
additional analysis.
In further analyses, possible combinations between 
adherence to the Mediterranean diet (in tertiles) and level 
of total activity were created. The association of the pos-
sible combinations with the risk of depression was also 
ascertained through Cox regression models considering 
the same confounding factors as in the main analysis. 
Finally, the joint effect of the three different exposures 
(adherence to the Mediterranean lifestyle) was evaluated 
in multivariable analyses considering the lowest adher-
ence as the reference category.
Moreover, Nelson-Aalen curves of the incidence of 
depression according to the joint effect of the adherence 
to Mediterranean diet and physical and socializing activi-
ties were calculated.
All p values were two-tailed, and p < .05 was consid-
ered significant. Statistical analysis was performed using 
STATA version 12.0 (StataCorp).
Results
Table 1 shows the distribution of several characteristics 
of the sample according to extreme tertiles of adherence 
to Mediterranean diet, physical activity, or socializing. 
Participants in the highest tertile of the Mediterranean 
diet were more likely to be older, married, and ex-smok-
ers and showed higher prevalence of several chronic dis-
eases, physical activity level, and total energy intake. 
Those participants with the highest level of physical 
activity were more likely to be males, nonmarried, and 
nonsmokers and to show a higher adherence to the Med-
iterranean diet and higher energy intake. On the other 
hand, participants in the third tertile of socializing (those 
who spent more than 1.6 hours/day with friends) were 
more likely to be younger, females, nonmarried, and cur-
rent smokers and to have a lower prevalence of chronic 
diseases and BMI and a higher level of physical activity.
After a median 8.5 years of follow-up, 806 cases of 
depression were reported. The association between ter-
tiles of different features of the Mediterranean lifestyle 
and depression risk is shown in Table 2. The three expo-
sure variables were inversely associated with depression 
risk with significant dose–response relationships. The 
multivariable HRs and 95% CIs for extreme tertiles were 
as follows: HR = 0.82, 95% CI = [0.69, 0.97] for Mediter-
ranean diet; HR = 0.81, 95% CI = [0.69, 0.97] for physical 
activity; and HR = 0.77, 95% CI = [0.64, 0.93] for social-
izing. Further adjustment for each exposure slightly 
attenuated the reported associations. Level of total activ-
ity was also associated with a reduction in the relative 
risk of depression. The HRs and 95% CIs for high and 
very high levels of total activity as compared to low 
activity were 0.79 and [0.64, 0.96] and 0.72 and [0.55, 
0.93], respectively.
When level of total activity was analyzed together with 
adherence to the Mediterranean diet, a reduction of 
around 40% in the relative risk of depression was observed 
for those participants in the highest level of activity (third 
tertiles of both physical activity and socializing) and inter-
mediate–high level of adherence to the Mediterranean 
diet (second and third tertiles of adherence) (Table S1 in 
the Supplemental Material available online).
Finally, those participants with the highest adherence 
to the Mediterranean lifestyle (participants with the high-
est adherence to Mediterranean diet, the highest level of 
physical activity, and the highest level of socializing) 
showed a 50% reduction in the relative risk of depression 
as compared to those participants with the lowest adher-
ence to this lifestyle (multivariable HR = 0.50, 95% 
CI = [0.32, 0.81]) (Table 3).
The Nelson-Aalen curves (Figure S1 in the Supple-
mental Material) showed differences in the incidence of 
depression according to the level of adherence to the 
Mediterranean lifestyle, with a higher incidence for those 
participants situated in the lowest category.
Discussion
In this analysis of the SUN Project, a high adherence to 
the Mediterranean diet, a high level of physical activity, 
and a high level of socializing were independently asso-
ciated with a lower risk of developing depression. 
According to our results, level of activity (both physical 
activity and socializing) could be at least as important as 
diet to reduce the risk of depression. When the three 
features were considered together, the reduction in the 
relative risk was even higher, with a reduction of 50%.
The role of the Mediterranean diet in depression was 
first evaluated in 2009 within the SUN Project (Sánchez-
Villegas et al., 2009). Recently, these results have been 
confirmed in an updated analysis including repeated 
measures of Mediterranean diet adherence (Sánchez- 
Villegas et al., 2015). Other longitudinal studies, both 
observational and experimental, have found a protective 
effect of this pattern on depression development (Rienks 
et al., 2013; Sánchez-Villegas et al., 2013; Skarupski et al., 
 at NORTHERN ILLINOIS UNIV on August 10, 2016

2013). Some food items characteristic of this protective 
pattern, such as olive oil, nuts, fruits, legumes, or fish, 
could be responsible for the reported effect through their 
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties as well as 
their capacity to improve endothelial function and neuro-
nal membranes composition.
On the other hand, engagement in physical activity 
has also been associated with a lower risk of depression 
in several epidemiological studies (McKercher et al., 
2014; Pinto Pereira, Geoffroy, & Power, 2014; Roh et al., 
2015). Several mechanisms may underlie the potentially 
protective effect of physical activity on depression, 
including its anti-inflammatory and neurochemical 
effects, the large amounts of encephalins and endorphins 
secreted during exercise (McMurray, Berry, & Katz, 1990), 
sustained cerebral blood flow (Rogers, Meyer, & Mortel, 
1990), improved aerobic capacity and cerebral nutrient 
supply (Dustman et al., 1984), as well as growth factors, 
specifically the brain-derived neurotropic factor, which is 
a peptide that increases neuronal survival and plasticity 
(Erickson, Gildengers, & Butters, 2013). Other authors 
have suggested improvements in some psychosocial 
parameters such as body image, self-esteem, self-efficacy, 
or self-worth and a decrease in social isolation as a result 
of a greater recreational physical activity (Liu, Wu, & 
Ming, 2015). In this sense, social isolation could increase 
depression risk. In fact, several studies have found a pro-
tective effect of socializing or social relationships on 
depression (Chiao, Weng, & Botticello, 2011; Cruwys 
et al., 2013; Sánchez-Villegas et al., 2009, Teo, Choi, & 
Valenstein, 2013; Teo et al., 2015). In a recent study based 
on a cohort of 4,642 American adults ages 25 to 75 fol-
lowed for 10 years, Teo et al. (2013) found that the qual-
ity of social relationships predicted future depression. 
According to these authors, social relationships might 
influence mental health outcomes through multiple 
mechanisms, including influence on health-related 
behaviors, engagement in social activities, transfer and 
exchange of social support, and access to material 
resources (Kawachi & Berkman, 2001). In agreement

with our results, a recent analysis within that same cohort 
found that the frequency of in-person social contact with 
friends was inversely associated with depressive symp-
toms (Teo et al., 2015).
According to the Mediterranean Diet Foundation (2016), 
“the Mediterranean diet is a valuable cultural heritage that 
is much more than just nutritional, tasty and healthy pat-
tern. It is a balanced lifestyle that includes recipes, cooking 
methods, celebrations, customs, local products and vari-
ous human activities.” Beyond dietary features, the current 
Mediterranean pyramid includes adequate rest, convivial-
ity, and physical activity as essential parts of its setup 
(Mediterranean Diet Foundation, 2016). Moreover, accord-
ing to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cul-
tural Organization (UNESCO), the traditional Mediterranean 
diet involves a set of skills, knowledge, rituals, symbols, 
and traditions, including the sharing and consumption of 
food. Eating together is the foundation of the cultural 
 
identity and continuity of communities throughout the 
Mediterranean basin. It is a moment of social exchange 
and communication, and an affirmation and renewal of 
family, group, or community identity (UNESCO, 2013). 
Thus, the Mediterranean lifestyle includes not only a food 
consumption pattern but also other features related to 
human activities, such as physical activity or engagement 
in social aspects like going out with friends. All factors in 
combination would be responsible for the health benefits 
associated with this lifestyle (Gerber & Hoffman, 2015). In 
this line of thought, age-adjusted rates of depression and 
suicide are known to be lower in Southern Europe (Spain, 
Italy, and Greece) than in Northern or Central European 
countries (Chishti et al., 2003). A suggested hypothesis that 
could explain the south-to-north gradient in depression 
rates is the difference observed in food patterns and habits 
between Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean countries. 
Consequently, the traditional Mediterranean lifestyle might 
have contributed to lowering the risk of depression.
To our knowledge, this is the first time that an overall 
Mediterranean lifestyle is analyzed in association with 
depression. Recently, the combined association of physi-
cal activity and fruit and vegetable consumption with 
depression was analyzed in a cohort study in Taiwan 
(Chi, Wang, & Tsai, 2016). In this study, the simultaneous 
presence of several good lifestyle habits increased the 
beneficial effect of reducing the risk of developing 
depressive symptoms (Chi et al., 2016). In the last

 Association Between Mediterranean Lifestyle and Depression 
7
decades, nutritional epidemiologists have increased their 
interest to study overall dietary patterns more than spe-
cific food items or nutrients, as the analysis of a single 
component does not take into account the interaction 
with other nutrients and their synergistic effects (Jacobs 
& Tapsell, 2013). Using this analogy, the cluster of sev-
eral features (e.g., diet, physical activity, and socializing) 
could add extra protection against depression, as we 
have found in the present study (Houtjes et al., 2014). In 
our line of thought, a recent study by Knight, Bryan, and 
Murphy (2016) analyzing the feasibility of an interven-
tion with the Mediterranean diet on preventing cognitive 
impairment in elders from Western countries suggests 
examining not only the dietary intervention but also its 
combination with other postulated factors such as physi-
cal activity, smoking, or social engagement.
Several strengths have to be highlighted in our study. 
The inclusion of a large number of participants, a high 
retention rate near 90%, the existence of previously pub-
lished validation studies regarding the exposure and the 
outcome, and some other important covariables should be 
mentioned. Some limitations should also be acknowledged. 
Dietary intake, physical activity level, social activities, and 
clinical diagnosis of depression were self-reported. Dietary 
intake, physical activity level, and depression diagnosis 
were validated in subsamples of participants of the cohort 
(Fernández-Ballart et al., 2009; Martínez-González et al., 
2005; Sánchez-Villegas et al., 2008). However, some degree 
of misclassification might exist for these assessments and 
for social activity. Nevertheless, this misclassification is 
more likely to be nondifferential and therefore would bias 
the results towards the null expecting rather than a higher 
magnitude of effects than those found in the present 
analysis.
Another caveat to take into account is the possible 
presence of reverse causation bias. Although participants 
with a prevalence of depression or who used antidepres-
sants at baseline were excluded from the analysis, some 
participants with a subclinical (undiagnosed) depression 
could have responded to the questions regarding diet, 
physical activity, and socializing at the beginning of the 
study. Participants with subclinical depression may have 
changed their food habits and social relationships 
because of their mood disorder. In fact, it is known that 
social isolation is present among depressed patients 
(Jacobs & Tapsell, 2013). However, the prospective 
design of the SUN cohort study reduces the possibility of 
reverse causation bias on the reported associations. 
Moreover, the results for the association between adher-
ence to the Mediterranean lifestyle and depression did 
not change after eliminating the cases of depression 
reported in the first follow-up questionnaire (n = 251) in 
a sensitivity analysis of our data (data not shown).
In conclusion, some already stated protective factors 
of depression such as adherence to the Mediterranean 
diet and the engagement in physical and social activities 
have also been described in the present study. However, 
we found an even higher inverse association between the 
cluster of all these protective factors in a labeled Mediter-
ranean lifestyle and depression risk within the SUN 
cohort study based on a middle-aged population from a 
Mediterranean country. In fact, a 50% reduction in the 
relative risk of depression was found for those partici-
pants with a higher adherence to this lifestyle.
