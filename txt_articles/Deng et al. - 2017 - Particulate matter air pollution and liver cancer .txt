Particulate matter (PM) air pollution exposure has been associated with cancer incidence and mortality especially with lung
cancer. The liver is another organ possibly affected by PM due to its role in detoxifying xenobiotics absorbed from PM.
Various studies have investigated the mechanistic pathways between inhaled pollutants and liver damage, cancer incidence,
and tumor progression. However, little is known about the effects of PM on liver cancer survival.
Twenty thousand, two hundred and twenty-one California Cancer Registry patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
diagnosed between 2000 and 2009 were used to examine the effect of exposure to ambient PM with diameter <2.5 lm
(PM2.5) on HCC survival. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) relating PM2.5 to
all-cause and liver cancer-specific mortality linearly and nonlinearly—overall and stratified by stage at diagnosis (local,
regional and distant)—adjusting for potential individual and geospatial confounders.
PM2.5 exposure after diagnosis was statistically significantly associated with HCC survival. After adjustment for potential
confounders, the all-cause mortality HR associated with a 1 standard deviation (5.0 mg/m3) increase in PM2.5 was 1.18 (95%
CI: 1.16–1.20); 1.31 (95% CI:1.26–1.35) for local stage, 1.19 (95% CI:1.14–1.23) for regional stage, and 1.05 (95% CI:1.01–
1.10) for distant stage. These associations were nonlinear, with substantially larger HRs at higher exposures. The associations
between liver cancer-specific mortality and PM2.5 were slightly attenuated compared to all-cause mortality, but with the same
patterns.
Exposure to elevated PM2.5 after the diagnosis of HCC may shorten survival, with larger effects at higher concentrations.
Air pollution is classified as a carcinogen by the International
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).1 While associations
between ambient particulate matter with diameter <2.5 lm
(PM2.5) and lung cancer have been well documented, associa-
tions with cancers at other sites have received less attention.2
The liver may be a target as PM2.5 can induce oxidative stress,
inflammation, genotoxicity, and accelerate liver inflammation
and steatosis, driving the development and progression of
liver cancer.3 For example, PM2.5 exposure has been linked to
increased serum levels of hepatic enzymes such as alanine
aminotransferase, which is a marker of liver damage and a
predictor of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most com-
mon liver cancer.4 Long-term PM2.5 exposures have recently
been linked to an increased incidence of HCC,4 but the
effects of PM2.5 exposure on survival of HCC have not been
investigated. We hypothesized that PM2.5 exposure accelerates
the progression of HCC and decreases survival after the diag-
nosis of liver cancer.
Material and Methods
To determine whether PM2.5 exposure is associated with sur-
vival in liver cancer patients, we combined data on patients
newly diagnosed with primary HCC (ICD-O-3 site code of
C22.0 and morphology codes of 8170–81765) between 2000
and 2009 from the California Cancer Registry (CCR; http://
www.ccrcal.org) and PM2.5 air pollution data collected by the

characteristics
(including stage of diagnosis), and first course of treatment
within 6 months of diagnosis for all HCC patients diagnosed
in California. Cancer records were geocoded by longitude
and latitude based on residential address at diagnosis, and
then assigned into census tracts and block groups for assign-
ment of area-based estimates of rural-urban commuting area
(RUCA) codes and socioeconomic status (SES). Specifically,
RUCA codes are census tract-level designations from 1 (met-
ropolitan) to 10 (rural) based on the size and direction of
primary commuting flows, using measures of population den-
sity, urbanization, and daily commuting (www.ers.usda.gov/

Routine
CCR
follow-up of cancer patients monitored patient vital status
through information sharing with reporting hospitals and
linkage with a variety of administrative records.12 There were
20,221 eligible HCC cases with PM2.5 exposures included in
the analysis. We censored the date of last follow-up to
December 31, 2011.
Using hourly measurements of ambient PM2.5 (in mg/m3)
in the AQS database, monthly average PM2.5 concentrations
were calculated from hourly and daily measurements,6 and
spatially interpolated to residence locations from up to four
closest air quality monitoring stations using inverse distance-
squared weighting.7,13 PM2.5 exposures were not assigned to
patient residences with unmatched geocodes or with the
nearest monitor located > 25 km away. Survival-period expo-
sure summaries were calculated as the average ambient resi-
dential monthly PM2.5 from date of diagnosis to date of death
or loss to follow-up or the end of study.
Kaplan-Meier curves were used to calculate median sur-
vival stratified by stage at diagnosis and categorized
PM2.5
exposure. Cox proportional hazards models were used to esti-
mate the PM2.5 exposure (<10, 10–25 and >25 mg/m3) and
survival association. We considered both all-cause and liver
cancer
specific
mortality,
where
liver
cancer
was
the
underlying cause of death on the death certificate (ICD-10
code C22.0-C22.9).14 Patient survival was censored due to
loss to follow-up or study end (or, for liver cancer specific
mortality, censored due to death by another cause). Hazard
ratios (HRs)—scaled to a standard deviation (SD) increase in
PM2.5—were obtained from Cox models that adjusted for pre-
determined potential confounders: age, sex, race/ethnicity
(non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, Asian/
Pacific islanders and other/unknown), marital status (single,
married, formerly married and unknown), year of diagnosis,
month of diagnosis, and initial treatment (surgery, radiation,
and/or
chemotherapy
versus
none),
SES,
dichotomized
RUCA (metropolitan core, non-metropolitan core), catego-
rized distance to primary interstate highways and primary
US and State Highways (<300, 300–1500 and >1500 m).
Adjusted Cox models were stratified by tumor stage at diag-
nosis (local, regional and distant). Sensitivity analyses were
performed by further stratifying the stage-specific Cox mod-
els by distance to monitor, geocoding accuracy (street-level
matching vs. city-level matching),
regions
(Los
Angeles
county, San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego county, and other
regions in California), and socioeconomic status. Nonlinear
associations with PM2.5 were examined using a natural cubic
spline with 2 degrees of freedom2 and Cox models with cate-
gorized PM2.5.
Analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS
Institute Inc.) and R version 3.3.1 (http://www.R-project.org).
Hypothesis tests were 2-sided with a 0.05 significance level.
Results
Overall, median survival was 0.64 years and only 324 patients
were lost to follow-up (i.e., not known to be dead and with a
last follow-up date 15 months or longer before the study
end). HCC patients were on average 63.7 years old at diagno-
sis, racially diverse (38.9% non-Hispanic white, 25.9% His-
panic white, 26.1% Asian/Pacific islander) and predominantly
male (75.0%), and living in metropolitan core areas (90.6%;
Table 1). The most common stage at diagnosis was local
(44.8%) followed by regional (27.5%), distant (17.6%), and
unknown (10.0%). The number of patients diagnosed at local
stage increased from 533 (5.9%) in 2000 to 1347 (14.9%) in
2009 while the number decreased from 548 (15.4%) to 395
(11.1%) in distant stage (data not shown). The most common
initial treatments were chemotherapy (32.4%) and surgery
What’s new?
While the lung is a primary site of cancer caused by air pollution, other organs are also affected, including the liver, which
breaks down foreign substances associated with particulate matter (PM). In this registry-based study, potential effects of air
pollution exposure on liver cancer survival were examined in more than 20,000 patients newly diagnosed with hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) from 2000 to 2009 in California. The data show that after HCC diagnosis, PM2.5 exposure was associated
with shortened survival, with adverse effects increasing with PM concentration. The results suggest that reduced exposure to
high PM2.5 levels could benefit survival in non-respiratory system cancers.

Cancer Epidemiology
 (21.9%). In general, patients who lived in areas with high
PM2.5 tended to have lower socio-economic status and were
more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease
(Supporting Information eTable S1).
Median all-cause mortality times were higher in low PM2.5
areas for patients diagnosed at either local or regional stage
(Table 2). For example, median survival times for patients
diagnosed at local stage living in lowest and highest
PM2.5
exposure areas were 2.16 and 0.07 years, respectively. After
adjusting for potential confounders, PM2.5 level was inversely
associated with all-cause mortality with statistical significance.
Allowing for nonlinear associations using splines or catego-
rized exposure, the adjusted PM2.5 HR for all-cause mortality
were significantly higher in high exposure areas in both overall
and in stage-specific models (Fig. 1, Table 2). In stage-specific
models using a linear term for continuous PM2.5 exposure, the
HRs associated with a 1 SD increase in PM2.5 were 1.31 (95%
CI: 1.26–1.35) for local stage, 1.19 (95% CI: 1.14–1.23) for
regional stage, and 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01–1.10) for distant stage.
This indicates the damaging effect of PM2.5 is most substantial
for patients with local disease and diminishes with worsened
stage, which likely reflects the shortened survival/exposure
time for patients with late stage disease. The associations
between liver cancer specific survival and exposure to PM2.5
were slightly attenuated, but the pattern that adjusted PM2.5
HR was larger for patients diagnosed at early stage remained
(Supporting Information eTable S2). Sensitivity analyses show
that stage-stratified HRs were robust to stratification by dis-
tance to monitor, geocoding accuracy, and socioeconomic sta-
tus (Supporting Information eTable S3). Stratification by
various metropolitan areas (LA County, San Diego County
and San Francisco Bay Area) showed a consistent pattern of
larger PM2.5 HR for patients with local stage at diagnosis as
compared to patients with more advanced stage at diagnosis.
Discussion
Our study provides the first evidence that exposure after
HCC diagnosis to a major ambient air pollutant, PM2.5, is
associated with shortened survival. These associations were
strongest for patients diagnosed at local stage and showed
larger adverse effects at higher PM2.5 levels. To our knowl-
edge, no study has related PM2.5 to liver cancer survival, but
several have examined other
PM2.5-liver cancer associa-
tions.2,4 For instance, in a large cohort study (n 5 66,820)
Wong et al. found that PM2.5 was associated with mortality
from accessory organ cancers (liver, gall bladder and pan-
creas) [overall: 1.35 (95% CI: 1.06–1.71), in males: 1.28
(95% CI: 0.83–1.96), in females: 1.37 (95% CI: 1.05–1.80)
and in female never smokers: 1.36 (95% CI: 1.01–1.84)].2 A
key difference between our study and the Wong et al. study
is that we calculated the average PM2.5 exposure after diag-
nosis, addressing the hypothesis that
PM2.5 exposure after
diagnosis adversely affects survival. Wong et al. assigned
exposures based on the subjects’ recruitment year average

 (between 1998 and 2001). Our study specifically targeted
HCC and conducted stage-specific analysis, which limits
carry-over effects at diagnosis.
Our population-based study design—consisting of all Cali-
fornian HCC cases between 2000 and 2009—minimizes selec-
tion and survivorship bias. California also has one of the
largest and longest running air pollution monitoring net-
works and a wide range of PM2.5 exposures allowing large
valid scale exposure assessment using standard methods. Res-
idential addresses were available only at the date of diagnosis,
so there could be exposure misclassification due to patients
relocating. However, patients with HCC were less likely to
relocate after diagnosis, as the survival times were very short.
An important limitation of our registry-based design is that
personal-level data (e.g., alcohol consumption, Hepatitis A/B
status, weight, and residential histories after diagnosis) were
not available in the CCR. We did control for area-level SES
and rural/urban factors, major confounders to the PM2.5-HCC
survival associations, and believe that factors other than SES
and residential location were unlikely to be associated with
the spatio-temporal distribution of ambient air pollution
exposures. Thus, the associations could not have spuriously
induced with the adjustment of these omitted factors. Never-
theless, future studies should consider additional personal-
level factors.
Previous studies have suggested exposure-response rela-
tionships for PM2.5 that were linear for lung cancer mortality
or steeply increasing at low exposure levels and flattening out
at higher exposures for cardiovascular mortality.15,16 How-
ever, our finding of nonlinear (concave upward, quadratic
curved) PM2.5-HCC survival associations has significant public
health implications, providing evidence that relatively small
reductions in high pollution levels could have substantial
health impacts. However, the magnitude of the HRs at the
high pollution levels were large. While these findings were
plausible and consistent with the results from the analysis on
the linear association, we recognize there might be unmea-
sured risk factors such as those personal-level confounders
that are not available in our data. Future research is needed
to confirm this finding.
In summary, we found adverse effects of PM2.5 exposure
after diagnosis on liver cancer survival. Not only were such
effects more profoundly for those diagnosed with early
stage, but they also increased strongly with concentration,
suggesting that reductions in high
PM2.5 exposure could
increase survival for a nonrespiratory system cancer.
