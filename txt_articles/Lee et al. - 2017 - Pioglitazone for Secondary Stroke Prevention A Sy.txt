P
atients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack 
(TIA) remain at increased risk for recurrent stroke and 
future vascular events despite the effectiveness of current pre-
ventive therapies and a temporal decline in stroke incidence.1–
3New preventive strategies to further improve outcomes after 
ischemic stroke or TIA are needed.
Disorders of glucose metabolism are highly prevalent 
among patients with stroke and TIA,4–6 and diabetes mellitus is 
associated with increased risk for recurrent ischemic stroke.7–9 
However, oral antidiabetic drugs have not been associated 
with reduced stroke events,10 and intensive glycemic control 
does not seem to prevent risk of stroke in diabetic patients.11 
Similar to statin drugs, which have potent vascular protective 
properties that go beyond their primary action of cholesterol 
lowering, it is conceivable that hypoglycemic agents with 
pleiotropic properties may better at reducing vascular events 
than traditional hypoglycemic drugs. Pioglitazone is a peroxi-
some proliferator–activated receptor γ agonist that, in addi-
tion to its primary effect on glycemic control, exerts potential 
beneficial effects on inflammation, fat distribution, lipid and 
protein metabolism, and vascular endothelial function.12–15 The 
IRIS trial (Insulin Resistance Intervention After Stroke) found 
that among patients without diabetes mellitus who had insulin 
resistance along with a recent history of ischemic stroke or 
TIA, the risk of combined stroke or myocardial infarction was 
lower among patients who received pioglitazone than among 
those who received placebo, but differences in recurrent stroke 
alone did not reach statistical significance.16
The objective of this study was to use the totality of the pub-
lished literature to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the 
risk of recurrent stroke in stroke patients with abnormal glucose 
metabolism receiving pioglitazone therapy, by conducting a sys-
tematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
Methods
This study was performed in accordance with the recommendations 
of the PRISMA Statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analysis).17
Background and Purpose—Pioglitazone reduced major vascular events after ischemic stroke in a recent randomized 
controlled trial. The purpose of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the 
effect of pioglitazone therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent stroke in stroke patients.
Methods—Pubmed, EMBASE, Medline, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1966 to March 2016 were 
searched to identify relevant studies. We included randomized controlled trials that included comparison of pioglitazone 
versus control and trials in which quantitative estimates of the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval for recurrent 
stroke associated with pioglitazone therapy among stroke patients were reported. Hazard ratios with 95% confidence 
intervals were used as a measure of the association between use of pioglitazone and risks of recurrent stroke (ischemic 
and hemorrhagic) and major vascular events (nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death) 
after pooling data across trials. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic.
Results—Three randomized controlled trials with 4980 participants were identified. Use of pioglitazone in stroke patients 
with insulin resistance, prediabetes, and diabetes mellitus was associated with lower risk of recurrent stroke (hazard ratio 
0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.50–0.92; P=0.01) and future major vascular events (hazard ratio 0.75; 95% confidence 
interval, 0.64–0.87; P=0.0001). There was no heterogeneity across trials. There was no evidence of an effect on all-cause 
mortality and heart failure.
Conclusions—Pioglitazone reduces recurrent stroke and major vascular events in ischemic stroke patients with insulin 
resistance, prediabetes, and diabetes mellitus.

Data Sources and Searches
We searched Pubmed (1966 to March 4, 2016), EMBASE and 
Medline (1980 to March 4, 2016), and the Cochrane Central Register 
of Controlled Trials with the terms pioglitazone or actos and stroke 
or cerebrovascular disease or cerebral ischemia or myocardial 
infarction or coronary heart disease or coronary artery disease or 
cardiovascular disease or macrovascular disease. There were no lan-
guage restrictions. We also reviewed the Introduction and Discussion 
sections of retrieved trials and relevant review articles to identify 
additional trials.
Study Selection
Criteria for inclusion of a study were as follows: (1) randomized 
controlled trial design; (2) comparison of pioglitazone with control 
(eg, placebo or other glucose-lowering agents); and (3) reporting on 
quantitative estimates of the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for recurrent stroke associated with pioglitazone ther-
apy among stroke patients. We excluded trials if they did not enroll 
patients with a documented history of stroke or the outcome of stroke 
was not a prespecified and adjudicated major (primary or second-
ary) end point. Participants of any age or of either sex were included. 
One investigator (M.L.) developed selection criteria and conducted 
literature search. Another investigator (H.-W.L.) assessed these crite-
ria and independently checked the enrolled trials. Discrepancies were 
resolved by discussion with a third investigator (B.O.) and by refer-
encing the original report.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
All data from eligible studies were extracted by 2 independent inves-
tigators according to a standard protocol. Recorded data variables 
were trial name, year of publication, country of origin, eligibility cri-
teria, mean age, proportion of women in the study, baseline charac-
teristics, duration of follow-up, and number of participants and events 
for each group. We assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk-of-
bias algorithm (www.cochrane.org/training/cochrane-handbook).18
Data Synthesis and Analysis
The primary efficacy outcome analyzed was any recurrent stroke 
(ischemic or hemorrhagic). The secondary efficacy outcome was any 
major vascular event, defined as the composite of nonfatal stroke, 
nonfatal myocardial infarction, and vascular death. Safety outcomes 
were all-cause mortality and heart failure.
HR with 95% CI, adjusted for multiple comparisons, was used 
as a measure of the association between pioglitazone versus control 
and risk of stroke. In each study, we converted these values by using 
their natural logarithms, and we calculated the SEs from these loga-
rithmic numbers and their corresponding 95% CIs. For the statistical 
analysis, we combined log HRs and SEs using the inverse variance 
approach. We used a random-effects model and explored for sources 
of inconsistency (I2) and heterogeneity. We considered study-
level estimates to be heterogeneous if the χ2 test was significant 
(P<0.10) or the I2 statistic was >50%. The Cochrane Collaboration’s 
Review Manager Software Package (RevMan 5.3) was used for this 
meta-analysis.
Results
The literature review identified 11 articles for detailed assess-
ment, among which 5 were excluded because of no patients 
with a history of stroke being enrolled, 2 were excluded 
because stroke was not a prespecified and adjudicated major 
end point, and 1 was excluded because it was derived from 
the same study population as another report. Our final analy-
sis included 3 randomized controlled trials that enrolled 4980 
individuals, with 2488 participants (50%) randomly assigned 
to the pioglitazone group and 2492 participants (50%) to the 
control group (Figure 1).16,19,20 The study design and patient 
baseline characteristics of these randomized controlled trials 
are shown in Table 1. Analyzed data were abstracted from 
whole trials that enrolled only stroke or TIA patients (2 tri-
als)16,19 and a separately reported subgroup of stroke patients 
(1 trial).20,21 One trial included patients with insulin resistance 
and having their fasting glucose <126 mg/dL and hemoglo-
bin A1c <7%,16 another trial included patients with impaired 
glucose tolerance or newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus,19 
and a third trial included patients with diabetes mellitus.20 
The number of participants ranged from 12019 to 3876.16 The 
median study duration was 4.4 years (ranged from 2.819 to 
4.8 years16).
Risk-of-bias assessment of included trials was reported in 
Table 2. The results from the PROactive trial (Prospective 
Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events) had high 
risks of selection bias and reporting bias because the data were 
derived from a subgroup of patients with cerebrovascular dis-
ease.20,21 The results from the J-SPIRIT trial (Juntendo Stroke 
Prevention Study in Insulin Resistance and Impaired Glucose 
Tolerance) had high risks of performance bias because it was 
an open, nonblinded study.19
Clinical End Points
The primary efficacy end point of recurrent stroke was reported 
in all 3 trials, whereas the remaining end points were reported 
only in the 2 trials. For the outcome of recurrent stroke, pooled 
results from the random-effects model showed that piogli-
tazone was associated with reduced risk of recurrent stroke 
(HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.50–0.92; P=0.01; Figure 2). There was 
no substantial heterogeneity across trials (P=0.14; I2=49%). 
The estimates from the fixed-effects model (HR, 0.70; 95% 
CI, 0.58–0.86; P=0.0004) were similar to those of the ran-
dom-effects model. For the secondary efficacy outcome of all 
major vascular events, pooled results from the random-effects 
model showed that pioglitazone was associated with reduced 
risk (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.64–0.87; P=0.0001). There was no 
heterogeneity among trials (P=0.74; I2=0%).
For the 2 safety outcomes, there was no evidence of an effect 
on all-cause mortality (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.79–1.12; P=0.48) 
and heart failure (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.81–1.80; P=0.54).

Discussion
In this meta-analysis comprising 3 randomized controlled tri-
als, enrolling ≈5000 stroke patients with evidence of abnormal 
glucose metabolism (ie, diabetes mellitus, prediabetes, insu-
lin resistance), we found that adding pioglitazone to standard 
therapy was associated with a 32% risk reduction of recur-
rent stroke and a 25% risk reduction of major cardiovascular 
events. There was no evidence of an effect on all-cause mor-
tality and heart failure.
One of the challenges with directly translating the results 
of the IRIS trial into clinical practice has been that in IRIS 
patients were classified as having insulin resistance on the 
basis of the HOMA-IR index (homeostatic model assessment-
estimated insulin resistance).16 Although this measurement is 
relatively easy to perform, a component of it (plasma insulin 
level) is not globally standardized, and the test itself has to 
be done ≈2 weeks after the index stroke or TIA meaning that 
there is a potential opportunity lost to prevent early recurrent 
events and a real risk of delaying or not getting this screening 
test done once the patient gets into the community. Our cur-
rent results, which include data from studies beyond just IRIS, 
as well as the association of prediabetes with greater future 
risk of stroke,22 suggest that perhaps more globally standard-
ized tests of abnormal glucose metabolism, which can be 
readily obtained during the index stroke or TIA hospitaliza-
tion such as hemoglobin A1c, might be used to promptly and 
consistently identify patients with abnormal glucose metabo-
lism without frank diabetes mellitus who might benefit from 
pioglitazone treatment.23
Although how pioglitazone specifically decreases vascular 
events is uncertain, several mechanism of pioglitazone may 
contribute to reduce recurrent stroke risk in stroke patients with 
insulin resistance or diabetes mellitus. Pioglitazone is effective 
for improving insulin sensitivity, reducing C-reactive protein 
concentration and triglyceride, increasing high-density lipo-
protein cholesterol, enhancing cholesterol efflux capacity, and 
lowering blood pressure.16,24,25 Pioglitazone, as compared with 
placebo, reduces the risk of conversion of impaired glucose 
tolerance to diabetes mellitus.26 Pioglitazone, as compared 
with glimepiride, slows the progression of carotid intima–
media thickness and coronary atherosclerosis among diabetic 
patients.27,28 However, the observed cardiovascular benefits of

pioglitazone cannot be simply explained by a class effect by 
thiazolidinediones. Another agent in this class, rosiglitazone, 
has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular 
events in several meta-analyses.29,30
There are several limitations in this study. First, meta-analy-
sis may be biased when the literature search fails to identify all 
relevant trials or the selection criteria for including a trial are 
applied in a subjective manner. To minimize these risks, we 
performed thorough searches across multiple literatures and 
trial databases and used explicit criteria for study selection, 
data abstraction, and data analysis. Second, there were only 
3 relevant randomized controlled trials, and the results of this 
meta-analysis were dominated by IRIS trial.16 The data from 
PROactive trial20 were derived from a subfraction of patients 
having previous stroke in a randomized trial. This limits the 
interpretability of the pooled results. Also, only 6% of patients 
in IRIS trial had diabetes mellitus, and pioglitazone reduced 
new-onset diabetes mellitus substantially in this trial.16 
Because it may be too late for a hypoglycemic agent to have 
an effect on macrovascular events once diabetes mellitus is

established, another large-scale randomized controlled trial to 
explore the effect of pioglitazone on stroke patients with dia-
betes mellitus may be warranted. Third, because some poten-
tial adverse effects, such as fracture and weight gain, were 
only reported in one of the trials in this meta-analysis,16 we did 
not report it in our analysis. However, these potential adverse 
effects need to be taken into consideration when weighing the 
risk–benefit profile of pioglitazone. Fourth, the populations 
and frequency of medication use, especially statins, differed 
across trials. The variation in frequency of statin use among 
trials likely reflected the fact that the benefit of statin use in 
secondary stroke prevention was not well established until 
SPARCL trial (Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in 
Cholesterol Levels)31 published in 2006. Increased statin use 
in more recent trials are likely to reduce the recurrent stroke 
risk thereby possibly making the efficacy of active treatment 
drugs less obvious. Although the effect size differed among 
trials, there was no heterogeneity, probably because the sta-
tistical power was too low. Because our study was a study-
level meta-analysis, the issues mentioned above may not be 
well settled. Individual-level pooled analyses of relevant trials 
could provide additional insights. Fifth, the definition of the 
secondary outcome, major vascular events, differed between 2 
available studies. One study16 reported composite of myocar-
dial infarction and stroke, whereas another20 reported nonfatal 
myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and vascular death as 
major vascular events. Because fatal myocardial infarction 
and fatal stroke are likely the major components of vascu-
lar death, the end points categorized as major vascular events 
between 2 available studies may not be substantially different. 
Finally, although these results are largely confirmatory, given 
the paucity of available evidence about the role of antidiabetic 
drugs for secondary stroke prevention in patients with abnor-
mal glucose metabolism, as noted by the prevailing secondary 
stroke prevention guidelines,32 and the potential challenges with 
regularly obtaining HOMA index tests in routine practice, espe-
cially at times beyond the period of highest risk of stroke recur-
rence, a formal meta-analysis to broadly support or refute this 
therapeutic strategy in these patients was probably warranted.
In conclusion, this meta-analysis of randomized trial data 
indicates that pioglitazone may reduce risk of recurrent stroke 
and major vascular events in ischemic stroke and TIA patients 
with insulin resistance, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes mel-
litus. There was no evidence of an effect on all-cause mortality 
and heart failure.
