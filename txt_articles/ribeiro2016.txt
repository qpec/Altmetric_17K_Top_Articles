1. Introduction
Older adults represented 13% of the total Canadian population
in 2005 and will represent an estimated 24% in 2036 [1]. They
represented 19% of the total population in France in 2015 and the
proportion is still growing [2]. Aging is associated with increased
risk of cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease
(CHD) [3]. Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of
death today in Canada (29%) and in the world (30%) and can lead to
$20 billion/year costs in physician services, hospital costs, lost
wages and decreased productivity [3,4] and approximately s196
billion/year in the European Union (s106 billion in healthcare,
s44 billion [22%] in informal care, s27 billion [14%] in early
mortality and s19 billion in absence from work or early
retirement) [5].
Maximal aerobic power V˙O2peak

is an independent predictor of
mortality and morbidity in CHD patients [6]. Therefore, cardiac
rehabilitation programs with an exercise training component such
as continuous aerobic exercise training (CAET) were found to be safe
and to improve prognosis in CHD patients [7–11]. The additional
clinical benefits of exercise training in CHD patients are well
documented and include improvements in cardiovascular, lung and
skeletal muscle functions, endurance, quality of life, inflammation,
depressive symptoms, stress and cognitive functions [12,13]. There-
fore, exercise training such as CAET is now a cornerstone of the non-
pharmacological treatment of patients with CHD and is integrated
into the North American and European guidelines [12–15].
Recently, a strong clinical interest has emerged in high-
intensity interval training (HIIT) in patients with CHD, first
mentioned in the American Heart Association recommendations
for exercise prescription in 2007 [12]. Actually, HITT is increasingly
being mentioned as an exercise modality in the most recent North
American and European guidelines for CHD patients [12–14].

Recently, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) has emerged as an alternative and/or complementary
exercise modality to continuous aerobic exercise training (CAET) in CHD patients. However, the
literature contains descriptions of many HIIT protocols with different stage durations, nature of recovery
and intensities. In this review, we discuss the most recent forms of validated HIIT protocols in patients
with coronary heart disease (CHD) and how to prescribe and use them during short- and long-term
(phase II and III) cardiac rehabilitation programs. We also compare the superior and/or equivalent short-
and long-term effects of HIIT versus CAET on aerobic fitness, cardiovascular function, and quality of life;
their efficiency, safety, and tolerance; and exercise adherence. Short interval HIIT was found beneficial
for CHD patients with lower aerobic fitness and would ideally be used in initiation and improvement
stages. Medium and/or long interval HIIT protocols may be beneficial for CHD patients with higher
aerobic fitness, and would be ideally used in the improvement and maintenance stages because of their
high physiological stimulus. Finally, we propose progressive individualized models of HIIT programs
(phase II to III) for patients with CHD and how to ideally use them according to the clinical status of
patients and phase of the cardiac rehabilitation program.

 Here we review different forms of HIIT, their principles and
their potential combination with CAET to optimize exercise
training adaptations in CHD patients. We discuss only phase II
(short-term) and III (long-term/maintenance) exercise training
programs with HIIT and CAET separately or combined. Finally, we
propose how HIIT with CAET can be integrated into theoretical/
practical progressive exercise training models (phase II/III) for CHD
patients.
2. CAET for cardiac patients
CAET is still the cornerstone of exercise training programs
for CHD patients and is largely recommended worldwide [12–
14,16]. The program improves prognosis, is safe and feasible and
has almost no contra-indications for most patients with stable
CHD [12–14,16]. CAET programs have shown good short- and
long-term clinical benefits, including reduced mortality and/or
morbidity 
[7–10,17–21], 
improved 
V˙O2peak
and 
ventilatory
function, relieved clinical symptoms (dyspnea, sleep disorders
and depressive symptoms), controlled dyslipidaemia, and re-
duced endothelial and muscle dysfunction [12–14,16]. The main
goal of CAET is to perform longer exercise periods in steady-state,
which favours oxidative metabolism. For beginners, walking
programs remain the most prescribed modality for CHD patients
because of the advantages: walking is safe, appropriate for
starting exercising, needs no or little supervision and can be
performed anywhere (indoor or outdoor). Exercise modalities for
CAET include mostly walking, running, cycling, Nordic walking,
rowing, swimming, stepping and stairs climbing [12–14,16]. In
general, CAET leads to higher fat oxidation and longer exercising
bouts at intensities from 40% to 50% V˙O2peak for beginners with low
physical function/greater cardiac risk (i.e., CHD patients) and 50%
to 75% V˙O2peak for CHD patients with higher fitness level or less
cardiac risk [12–14,16].
Traditionally, the exercise intensity for CAET is prescribed using
percentage maximal heart rate (%HRmax), heart rate reserve (%HRR)
and peak power output (%PPO) and patient’s rate of perceived
exertion (RPE) (Borg scale: 6–20), with considerable success [12–
14,16]. The exercise intensity zones for CAET are usually classified as
follows (see review [15] for details): light- to moderate-intensity
zone (40–50% V˙O2peak, RPE: 11–12) and moderate- to high-intensity
zone (50–75% of V˙O2peak, RPE: 12–15). These zones must be mainly
considered with phase II (initiation-improvement) and III (mainte-
nance) cardiac rehabilitation (see progression models in Table 1).
Exercise prescription based on the intensity of the ventilatory
threshold, measured during maximal cardiopulmonary exercise
test, is also often used for CHD patients, especially those receiving
beta-blockers, and corresponds to 50% to 60% V˙O2peak (initial
moderate-zone intensity) [13].
3. General principles of HIIT and exercise training
implementation for CHD patients
In this section, we review the general principles of HIIT
prescription adapted to CHD patients and its place in the context of
exercise training implementation. In a second section, we review
the available studies comparing HIIT to CAET for CHD patients, an
important topic in recent years (Table 2). Finally, we propose a
guide for HIIT prescription and implementation combined with
CAET for CHD patients (Table 1).
The main principle of HIIT is to perform brief periods of high-
intensity exercise (e.g. > 85% V˙O2peak or PPO), interspersed with
periods of low-intensity exercise or passive rest, to allow patients
to accumulate greater time at a higher-intensity than they would
otherwise perform with continuous exercise [22,23]. In CHD
patients, HIIT can be considered a time-efficient substitute and/or
alternative to traditional continuous exercise training [22,23]. Dif-
ferent HIIT protocols (intensity, stage duration, nature of recovery,
number of intervals) have been tested and used for CHD patients
(see reviews [22,23] for details and Table 2 for protocols). Three
different categories of HIIT have been described for CHD patients:
� long intervals: 3 to 15 min at 85% to 90% V˙O2peak;
� medium intervals: 1 to 3 min at 95% to 100% V˙O2peak;
� short intervals: 10 sec to 1 min at 100% to 120% V˙O2peak [22,23].
Furthermore, HIIT can be performed with different exercise
modes such as cycling, running, walking with inclination, rowing,
swimming or other activities. Exercise intensity is generally
determined with % V˙O2peak, %HRmax, percentage maximal aerobic
power, percentage maximal short exercise capacity or RPE (Borg
scale) [22,23]. The HIIT choice in terms of exercise intensity,
duration of intervals and use of active or passive recovery has a
profound effect on acute physiological responses, exercise toler-
ance and RPE for CHD patients [22,23].
3.1. HIIT with short intervals
The acute physiological responses to different HIIT with short
interval protocols have been studied in patients with CHD [22–
26]. Our group investigated an optimal protocol that would allow
CHD patients to spend more time near the V˙O2peak values and
exercise for a longer total time with less feeling of fatigue and
dyspnea 
[24–26].

 physiological responses in 4 protocols (short interval duration:
15 s vs. medium interval duration: 1 min). The optimal protocol
involved 15 s exercise intervals at peak power interspersed with
passive recovery intervals of the same duration [23,25]. Com-
pared with CAET, this optimized HIIT protocol was associated
with lower mean V˙O2, lower ventilation, lower rate of perceived
exertion and higher exercise session compliance and was
preferred by patients. As well, this HIIT protocol had a lower
main exercise time (20 vs. 28.7 min) with the same total energy
expenditure (670 kJ) as CAET [23,26]. Thus, HIIT with short
intervals is well tolerated by CHD patients, is safe and produces
similar physiological responses as CAET [22,23], for possibly
improved adherence to exercise training. This form of HIIT may
be well suited for improvement and maintenance stages (see
Table 1) as an efficient alternative or as a substitute for
continuous CAET for CHD patients [22,23].
3.2. HIIT with medium to long intervals
Other medium to long HIIT protocols have been employed in
the literature previously with length stages from 1 to 4 min (80% to
145% PPO) and involved mainly low-intensity active recovery (10%
PPO to 70% HRmax) [27–33] with a close work/recovery ratio (see
review [23] for details). Although as effective or even superior to
CAET (see the Section 3.1), these HIIT protocols may have some
limitations 
and 
most 
importantly 
were 
chosen 
arbitrarily
[22,34]. Indeed, our previous work demonstrated that longer-
stage HIIT protocols with active recovery had higher mean
intensity (% V˙O2peak), were less tolerated (higher RPE) and were
associated with lower exercise session compliance for CHD
patients [22,23,25]. Therefore, the use of those protocols should
be proposed for the most fit patients or those with less cardiac risk
when used very soon in the improvement stage of training. They
may be more appropriate for the improvement stage for patients
who are less fit and/or at a higher risk, after a certain period of CAET
and/or 
short 
interval 
HIIT 
sessions 
with 
passive 
recovery
[22,23]. Finally, those HIIT protocols may be of use in the
maintenance stage because of their high physiological stimulus
(e.g., 2 times a week); indeed, they were found feasible in a home-
based program for CHD patients [35–38] (see Section 4).
4. Home-based HIIT
CAET has been widely studied in the long-term maintenance
phase and in home-based settings for CHD patients [13], but less is
known about HIIT used for this purpose. Previous study in CHD
patients reported improved or similar exercise adherence after a
cardiac rehabilitation program with HIIT as compared to CAET,
with superior or similar long-term effects on V˙O2peak and self-
reported physical activity [37,38]. More recently, one study
compared 3 different HIIT programs (12 weeks) for CHD patients,
one home-based [35]:
� a treadmill HIIT (hospital-based);
� a multi-modality HIIT (hospital-based);
� a home-based HIIT.
This phase II home-based HIIT program was as efficient in terms
of targeted exercise intensity, exercise adherence and V˙O2peak
increase [35]. The same authors reported the long-term effects
(1 year) of home- versus hospital-based HIIT for CHD patients and
found that home-based HIIT provided similar long-term exercise
adherence (no differences in total time physical activity expended
in moderate or vigorous intensity measured by accelerometry) and
improved V˙O2peak [36]. Thus, home-based HIIT may be as efficient
as hospital-based CAET and/or HIIT programs for CHD patients.
5. HIIT versus CAET programs
V˙O2peak consistently shows greater improvement in HIIT than
CAET studies [39]. The most recent meta-analysis evaluating the
effects of HIIT and CAET on V˙O2peak included 8 studies of CHD
patients (n = 439) and 4 studies of heart-failure patients (n = 58)
[40–42]. To our knowledge, 4 different meta-analyses were
conducted, with different combinations of studies; the results
showed a summarized weighted mean difference of 1.78 [95% CI:
0.45, 3.11] [42], 1.60 [0.18, 3.02] [40] and 1.53 [0.84, 2.23] [41] in
V˙O2peak that favoured HIIT programs. These effects are not exclusive
to CHD patients; the authors of the first 2 meta-analysis also
included studies with heart-failure patients [40,42]. For other
secondary outcomes, results were more conflicting. HIIT showed
superior effects to CAET for V˙O2 at anaerobic threshold in one meta-
analysis [41] and no significant difference in a second [40]. HIIT and
CAET programs were similar for systolic blood pressure, body mass
and VE/VCO2 [40–42]. For other outcomes such as BMI and resting
HR, CAET had superior effects compared to HIIT [42].
To evaluate the benefits of HIIT programs exclusively in CHD
patients, we reviewed protocols from randomized clinical trials
that compared HIIT and CAET for at least 4 weeks of training, with
no distinction in weekly frequency. The 11 studies are described in
Table 2. Some were already included in the previous meta-analysis
and represented part of the summarized effects, but some recent
ones were not included [43–45]. From all reviewed studies,
4 showed a superior effect of HIIT over CAET on V˙O2peak and
prescribed long intervals (4-min intervals at 80-95% HRpeak)
[29,45–47]. Similar benefits were found for HIIT versus CAET for
V˙E=V˙CO2 slope, oxygen uptake efficiency slope [43], partial
pressure of end-tidal CO2 [48], coronary atheroma and plaque
characteristics [44] and quality of life [49]. Furthermore, some
studies evaluated HIIT versus CAET for effects on blood pressure
[43,47,50–52], HR recovery and HR variability [51] as well as
systolic function and systolic volumes [29,49] and found no effects
of training on these variables. Finally, CAET seemed to confer better
improvement in endothelial function as compared with HIIT
[52]. CHD patients may benefit from a combination of aerobic
exercise training (HIIT and CAET), depending on the main goals of
the exercise programs.
6. Safety aspects and risk classification for HIIT prescription for
CHD patients
The clinical status and functional capacity are considered in
prescribing any exercise program for cardiac patients [16] (see
Table 3 for absolute contra-indications). Especially in CHD patients,

 symptoms such as angina, exercise intolerance and functional
status, in addition to ischemia and arrhythmias during exercise,
must be highly considered before prescribing an HIIT program, but
there is no evidence that patients with cardiac risk classes B and C
should avoid HIIT [16,53]. A study comparing cardiovascular risk in
HIIT and CAET that analysed 175,820 training hours showed the risk
of a cardiovascular event very low for both modalities [50].
In evaluating adverse events during HIIT programs, most of the
authors in our review accounted for cardiovascular events (all-
cause mortality, hospitalization for cardiovascular disease, atrial
tachycardia, atrial fibrillation or frequent ventricular arrhythmias).
Altogether, the 11 studies trained 631 stable CHD patients with no
major cardiovascular events during the training period, with the
exception of a cerebral hemorrhage in one HIIT group [44] and
2 myocardial infarctions in CAET programs [47,52]. These 3 adverse
cardiovascular events were not clearly related to the exercise
training and could be better described by authors to determine
causality of adverse events of exercise programs in the future.
Additionally, 2 patients showed angina and discontinued the
programs (1 HIIT and 1 CAET) [29]. No arrhythmia events were
described at any study. Therefore, HIIT seems to be a safe exercise
modality and did not differ in frequency or magnitude of
cardiovascular adverse events during exercise training as com-
pared with CAET, as was shown previously [50].
7. Future perspectives: periodization models for HIIT in CHD
patients
In this section, we develop the concept of progression principles
and theoretical models of periodization applied to HIIT for CHD
patients 
based 
on 
recent 
literature. 
The 
main 
progression
principles for exercise training are progressive overload, specificity
and periodization (variation), mostly applied previously in healthy
populations (see reviews [54–57] for details). Periodization is
defined by the variation in principal elements of an exercise
training program such as intensity, duration and frequency
(session/week) [54–57]. In healthy subjects, periodization aims
to optimize exercise training adaptations as compared with non-
periodized training (NPT), to prevent overtraining and to avoid
plateauing of training adaptations [54–57]. The classical approach
to periodization is linear periodized training (LPT), consisting of an
initial high volume and low-intensity. As exercise training
progresses, the intensity is increased and the volume is decreased
(reduced duration and/or frequency) [54]. This linear model
appears in exercise training guidelines for cardiac patients [13,58]
but has never been compared to NPT in this population. LPT has
superior benefits for aerobic power and muscle function as
compared with NPT in healthy subjects or athletes [54,55]. As
well, LPT was superior to NPT for certain cardiometabolic risk
factors in obese adolescents [59]. According to the progressive
overload principle, body adaptations depend on exercise stress and
the principle is highlighted by the super-compensation phase of
physical adaptations in response to a stressor [54]. However, if this
stress continues at the same level for an extended period, the body
may enter a phase of maladaptation or exhaustion [54,56]. Because
exercise intensity and volume reduction cannot be increased
definitively, other periodization models such as the non-linear
periodized training (NLPT) have been studied in healthy [54,60,61]
and clinical populations [59,62,63]. NLPT is characterized by a type
of 
periodization in 
which 
training 
intensity, duration, 
and
repetition-volume are altered frequently. In patients with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, improvements in aerobic endur-
ance (+125%), maximal strength (leg press +25%), and quality of life
(48–96% for different scores) were greater with NLPT than LPT
[62]. In overweight subjects, improvements in insulin resistance
and muscular strength were greater 
with NLPT than NPT
[63]. However, which exercise training program components such
as frequency, intensity, time (duration) and type (FITT), and their
combination [13], are the most efficient to optimize cardiovascular
adaptations to exercise training for CHD patients remain unclear.
More research is needed on HIIT protocols and their use into
optimal exercise training programs, such as testing different
individualized progressive models with HIIT (short, medium and
long intervals) to optimize training adaptations in CHD patients. In
addition, short interval HIIT has not been assessed in home-based
and/or community settings for cardiac patients. As well, no studies
have compared different HIIT protocols (e.g., short vs. long
intervals) for their cardiovascular effects, adherence, safety and
tolerance/preferences for cardiac patients. In this context, the
study of LPT and/or NLPT for HIIT as compared to more traditional
NPT methods (CAET and/or HIIT) is a promising area of research.
Moreover, the effects of high-intensity interval training on
morbidity and mortality were never tested. The dose–response
effect is recurrently discussed concerning the total amount of
weekly physical activity (time and metabolic equivalents), but
there is no evidence for exercise intensities, for example [11]. Since
the time spent in physical activity is still an important barrier to
exercise adherence in cardiovascular rehabilitation programs,
documenting whether similar cardiovascular benefits could be
obtained with programs involving higher-intensity exercise and
lower total weekly exercise volume would be of interest [13,36].
8. Conclusions
For CHD patients, HIIT showed greater or equivalent benefits as
compared with CAET for most of the parameters reviewed. The use
of HIIT does not seem to decrease exercise compliance or increase
cardiovascular events (when properly prescribed) and is well
tolerated and appreciated by the patients. We question why HIIT is
still not yet a standard for exercise training (at least in partial
substitution of CAET) in clinical routine practice for stable CHD
patients. For example, HIIT could be a good modality when patients
are transferred home and/or to community-based programs
because of its superior benefits for V˙O2peak, time efficiency,
equivalent adherence and patient preference. HIIT should now
become systematically integrated in cardiac rehabilitation pro-
grams for all cardiac patients, while reinforcing existing evidence
on long-term safety and efficacy of this training modality.
