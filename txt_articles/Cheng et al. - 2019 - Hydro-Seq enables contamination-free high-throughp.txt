Molecular analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) at single-cell resolution offers great
promise for cancer diagnostics and therapeutics from simple liquid biopsy. Recent develop-
ment of massively parallel single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a powerful
method to resolve the cellular heterogeneity from gene expression and pathway regulation
analysis. However, the scarcity of CTCs and the massive contamination of blood cells limit
the utility of currently available technologies. Here, we present Hydro-Seq, a scalable
hydrodynamic scRNA-seq barcoding technique, for high-throughput CTC analysis. High cell-
capture efficiency and contamination removal capability of Hydro-Seq enables successful
scRNA-seq of 666 CTCs from 21 breast cancer patient samples at high throughput. We
identify breast cancer drug targets for hormone and targeted therapies and tracked individual
cells that express markers of cancer stem cells (CSCs) as well as of epithelial/mesenchymal
cell state transitions. Transcriptome analysis of these cells provides insights into monitoring
target therapeutics and processes underlying tumor metastasis.

irculating tumor cells (CTCs) are the rare metastatic
cancer cells shed from the primary tumor into the circu-
latory system as the seeds to form secondary tumors at
distant tissues1,2. A strong heterogeneity of CTCs is observed in
the metastatic process with the cancer cell transition between
epithelial and mesenchymal cell types3,4. As such, single-cell
analysis of those CTCs provides critical insights into cancer
metastasis. The access to tumor cells from blood draw or liquid
biopsy represents a promising alternative to tumor biopsies for
tumor molecular heterogeneity characterization as a companion
diagnostic tool5. However, such analysis is challenged by the
scarcity of CTCs and blood contamination in the samples. In
average, less than 100 CTCs are found per 10 mL of blood with
billions of erythrocytes and millions of leukocytes6,7. To over-
come such challenges, substantial research has been focused on
enriching CTCs for downstream analysis1,2,7. Immunoaffinity
enrichment methods can extract the CTCs by their surface
membrane markers such as EpCAM for CTC numeration and
downstream analysis, but this molecular-marker-based selection
biases the sampling population and thus limits the molecular
heterogeneity for comprehensive analysis. Physical property
enrichment methods such as size-based selection can separate
larger CTCs from smaller erythrocytes and leukocytes without
limiting to certain molecular markers for selection. However, the
enriched cell suspension usually still contains a large number of
background cells (erythrocytes and leukocytes), making it difficult
for downstream analysis. Although fluorescent staining with
immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization (ISH), and
single-cell western blotting may be applied to study the protein
and gene expression of CTCs, the bandwidth constraint imposed
by fluorescent imaging limits the number of molecular markers to
be studied in the assays8–11.
To fully characterize the whole transcriptome profile and
pathway
regulation
in
metastatic
CTCs,
single-cell
RNA-
sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been applied to few CTCs picked by
capillary suction and dielectrophoretic microfluidics with the cells
labelled by fluorescent staining2,12–14. Nevertheless, these tech-
niques are constrained by their limited throughput and reliance
upon antibody-based marker expression. Commonly utilized
markers such as EpCAM and cytokeratins may miss a substantial
population of CTCs, which do not express these proteins. As
such, there is still an unmet need to achieve high-throughput
contamination-free scRNA-seq to study the pathway regulation
and heterogeneity of CTCs.
Recent advances of massively parallel microfluidics in scRNA-
seq have enabled high-throughput analysis of cellular hetero-
geneity and identification of cellular types by their gene sig-
natures15–18. By pairing single barcode beads with single cells in
droplets or micro-wells, mRNA molecules from a single cell can
be uniquely labelled by a barcode and identified using single-cell
whole-transcriptome sequencing. However, the low efficiency of
droplet-based technologies such as Drop-seq has limited the
applicability in analysis of rare cell populations presented in
CTCs. Due to the inefficiency of bead-cell pairing, thousands of
cells are required to achieve accurate cell readout. Although
methods using micro-wells or hydrogel barcoded beads may
achieve a better single-cell capture efficiency, the fidelity of single-
cell gene sequencing is still challenged by the massive con-
tamination of erythrocytes and leukocytes even after enrich-
ment16–18.
Thus,
the
development
of
a
high-throughput
technology capable of efficiently capturing and molecularly
interrogating CTCs at single-cell resolution would have sig-
nificant clinical utility for treatment selection and therapeutic
monitoring.
Here, we present Hydro-Seq, a high-efficiency-cell-capture
contamination-free scRNA-seq platform, for gene expression
profiling of CTCs. Hydro-Seq utilizes size-based single-cell cap-
ture to prevent the bias that can be caused by molecular CTC
selection. This cell capture scheme achieves a high cell capture
efficiency (72.85 ± 2.64%, ± represents standard deviation n = 3)
to analyze the small number of CTCs in 10 mL of blood samples.
To achieve contamination-free single-cell sequencing, the Hydro-
Seq chamber incorporates pneumatic valves to enable on-chip
washing for cellular and acellular contaminant removal in the
chambers. Furthermore, the chamber array can be scaled up to
thousands of chambers for massively parallel analysis. We vali-
dated the utility of Hydro-Seq by sequencing 666 CTCs from 21
advanced breast cancer patients, identifying cellular heterogeneity
in critical biomarkers of tumor metastasis and therapy. Hydro-
Seq offers the capability to analyze CTCs with single-cell whole-
transcriptome sequencing for metastasis research and companion
diagnostics applications.
Results
Hydro-Seq CTC single-cell transcriptome analysis method. The
Hydro-Seq chip consists of four modules (Fig. 1): capture
chambers where cells and beads are paired, microfluidic channels
through which cells, beads, and lysis buffer are loaded, control
valves that selectively close flow paths and isolate the chambers
during mRNA extraction, and inlet and outlet ports for intro-
duction of samples and retrieval of beads after RNA extraction.
Cells and barcoded beads are hydrodynamically loaded and
captured in each capture site and paired in each microfluidic
chamber for mRNA barcoding and sequencing (Fig. 1a–e, Sup-
plementary Fig. 1). Each Hydro-Seq chamber contains one cell
capture site and one bead capture site in ~1 nL volume, similar to
the size of micro-well and droplet volume reported in other
scRNA-seq methods. As CTCs are typically larger than other
blood cells, the cell capture site was designed with an opening of
10 × 10 µm1. This capturing hole allows smaller leukocytes, ery-
throcytes, and platelets to pass through, while larger cells (CTC or
larger leukocytes) can be captured (Fig. 1f, g). The bead capture
site was designed with a bowl-shape capture pocket of an opening
of 20 × 25 µm to trap the beads with an average diameter of 40 µm
(Fig. 1h). The entrance to the chambers, cell capture sites, and
bead capture sites can be selectively closed by different Quake
valves controlled by pneumatics for the bead-cell-pairing opera-
tion. We engineered Hydro-Seq chips composed of 800 chambers
per chip to accommodate CTCs from 10 mL of patient blood.
This hydrodynamic capture scheme can be expanded to an array
of 12,800 chambers, and was demonstrated in the previous
work19. In this design, we implement 16 branch channels, each
containing 50 cell-capture chambers. To enable cell lysis and
washing processes, two extra washing channels were added to the
entrance and the exit of each branch channel (Fig. 1c, d). To
minimize cell loss during cell loading, a pipette tip is directly
inserted into the inlet through a punch hole of 1 mm in diameter
formed on the microfluidic chip made of Polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS). To load the reagents, beads, and cells in the suspension,
the negative pressure is applied in the outlet by a syringe pump,
withdrawing the flow from the outlet.
Before loading CTCs into Hydro-Seq, we performed size-based
CTC enrichment, and the enriched CTC sample was then
transferred
to
Hydro-Seq
for
scRNA-seq
preparation7,20.
Although
the
enrichment
step
removes
several
orders
of
magnitude of blood cells, there are still significant numbers of
residual erythrocytes and leukocytes, which are further eliminated
by Hydro-Seq (Supplementary Fig. 2, 3). During cell loading, the
bead flow channels and washing channels were blocked, so CTCs
could be captured at the cell capture sites in the chambers. When
a CTC is captured, it blocks the flow path and the following cells

 are diverted to other downstream chambers, ensuring that only a
single CTC occupies each chamber. After cell loading, the bead
capture site was then opened to wash away contaminants
remaining in the chamber (Fig. 1g). To further remove the
potential contaminating cells in the dead volume near the cell
capture site, the captured cells were retrieved with 100 µL of
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to the inlet, and then repeated
the cell loading. Considering the total volume of chambers
around 800 nL, this reloading process significantly reduced the
concentration of contaminants by two orders of magnitude when
increasing the solution volume from sub 1–100 µL. Thus, the
remaining contaminating cells in the chamber could be effectively

microfluidic circuit design with valve controls for high-efficiency cell capture and contamination removal. a For circulating tumor cells (CTC) application,
Hydro-Seq chip is designed with 16 identical branch channels in parallel. Each branch channel consists of 50 chambers for bead-cell pairing, totaling 800
chambers per chip. b A closer view highlights the arrangement of parallel chambers. To minimize area consumption, each chamber shares the valve with its
neighboring chamber. The entrance valve has a peak height of 45 µm and an area of 200 × 200 µm to enable bead and cell loading. The cell and bead
valves are realized in a height of 15 µm and an area of 100 × 100 µm for high-density chamber arrangement. c, d At the upstream and downstream of

 removed by repeating the cell loading from the diluted sample
followed by the second wash. After washing the chamber, the
barcoded beads were then loaded into the chip to pair with the
captured cells (Fig. 1h, Supplementary Fig. 4). To lyse the cells, all
chambers were first closed by pneumatic valves, and the lysis
buffer was introduced to the branch channels through the
washing channels. After opening the valves connected to the
chambers, cell lysis buffer was introduced into the chambers by a
small leakage flow through bead capture sites. The square shape
of the bead capture opening and the round shape of the beads
make this flow without any additional valve control. Since the
cells can block and seal the capture site, they can stay intact in the
dead volume of cell capture site. When closing the valves to
isolate the chambers, a turbulence flow in the chamber was
generated to lyse the cell at the capture site and the released
mRNA could be hybridized with the barcoded bead (Fig. 1i,
Supplementary Fig. 5, 6). Finally, after 20 min of incubation, the
barcoded beads were retrieved by opening all valves with a back
flow (Fig. 1j). The rest of the downstream sequencing procedures,
including reverse transcription, amplification, library preparation,
and paired-end sequencing, are identical to drop-seq protocols15.
To demonstrate the high cell capture efficiency of Hydro-Seq,
we performed cell loading tests with ~100 cancer cells spiked into
blood samples (from healthy donors) enriched by Celsee
systems20. After loading the enriched spiked samples, we achieved
90.43 ± 6.08% (n = 3) single-cell capture efficiency with the large
cancer cells and other contaminating cells in the same chamber.
After cell capture, a washing procedure was applied to remove
contaminating cells and 89.70 ± 5.06% (n = 3) of the captured
cells remained. Finally, 89.60 ± 6.39% (n = 3) of the remaining
cells were successfully paired with a single bead for barcoding
mRNAs. Accounting for the losses from cell loading, washing,
and bead pairing, 72.85 ± 2.64% (n = 3) of the initially loaded cell
populations were successfully paired with a barcoded bead on-
chip. We also tested loading ~10 cancer cells, and 70.44 ± 21.91%
(n = 3) of the initially loaded cell populations were successfully
paired with a barcoded bead on-chip (Supplementary Table 1).
The experiments verify that by using the precisely controlled
hydrodynamic capture operation, a small number of single cancer
cells can be selectively captured and paired with barcoded beads
for scRNA-seq with high purity, high efficiency, and high
throughput.
Breast cancer patient CTC transcriptome analysis. Before pro-
cessing the actual cancer patient blood samples, we first assessed
the fidelity of single-cell resolution in mRNA sequencing using
Hydro-Seq. We performed a species-mixing experiment using a
mixture of human cells (HEK293) and mouse cells (3T3). After
bead-cell pairing, we utilized fluorescent imaging to confirm 156
human cells and 80 mouse cells successfully paired with barcoded
beads without any instance of two cells from different species in
the same chamber (Fig. 2a). In our design, the cell captured in a
chamber hydrodynamically prevents the next cell being captured
in the same chamber. Even if a cell tailgates after another cell into
the chamber, the second cell is removed later during washing
cycles. Using shallow sequencing (~60,000 reads per cell), the
species-mixing sequencing results demonstrated highly organism-
specific libraries without any mixed genotype cells (Fig. 2b, c).
Using 800 genes per cell as a threshold, we successfully recovered
147 human and 84 mouse cells, consistent with the number of
cells observed by fluorescent microscopy. In addition, the HEK
cells processed on different chips showed similar gene expression
profiles (Fig. 2d). The species-mixing experiment result shows no
cross contamination among the loaded 236 cells as an important
attribute of the system. In addition, visual inspection of bead-cell-
pairing in the Hydro-Seq chip during the protocol ensures the
quality
of
single-cell
RNA-sequencing
experiments.
These
advantages distinguish Hydro-Seq from droplet-based single-cell
transcriptome sequencing technologies.
To demonstrate the clinical applicability of Hydro-Seq, we
utilized this technology to analyze CTCs obtained from 21
patients with metastatic breast cancer, achieving single-cell
transcriptome analysis of 666 CTCs (Supplementary Table 2).
Ten milliliter of venous blood samples were first collected from
the patients using K2-EDTA tubes. To enrich the CTCs, the
samples were processed using the two different size-based CTC
enrichment methods including the commercially available Celsee
technology and an in-house microfluidic technology dubbed as
Labyrinth7,20. Although these platforms significantly enriched
CTCs, there were still significant cell populations of residual
erythrocyte and leukocytes (Fig. 2e). The contaminated cells were
further purified in wash cycles (Fig. 2f, g) and paired with beads
(Fig. 2h, Supplementary Fig. 7). Some larger leukocytes could be
still captured in the capture sites. We applied Hoechst and
CD45 staining in the loaded cells to identify the CD45+
leukocytes and the CD45− nucleated cells as the presumed
CTCs. (Fig. 3a). After sequencing, gene expression data were
analyzed utilizing R-based Seurat kit (Fig. 3b). To ensure high
quality contamination-free scRNA-seq data for analysis, the few
remaining contaminating leukocytes and erythrocytes were
excluded based on the expression of CD45 (PTPRC) or
hemoglobin (Supplementary Fig. 8). A low percentage of genes
expressed by leukocytes and erythrocytes were detected, demon-
strating the capability of Hydro-Seq to successfully screen out the
contaminating cell populations. Unhealthy cells were excluded
based on the percentage of mitochondria genes. The resulting
cells after quality check have at least 800 genes/cell detected from
sequencing. To demonstrate the reproducibility of these proce-
dures, we processed two tubes of blood drawn from the same
patient on the same day. We detected the comparable number of
CTCs (Exp. 1: 13 CTCs, Exp. 2: 12 CTCs) and a similar CTC gene
expression profile from these two biological replicates (Fig. 3c).
Clinical markers identification in CTCs for liquid biopsy.
Current treatments for breast cancer are chosen based on the
expression of receptors estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), as well
as human epidermal receptor 2 (HER2) in the initial biopsy21,22.
However, intra-tumor cellular heterogeneity as well as evolution
of tumors over time and following therapy suggests the potential
utility of accessing these markers in CTCs. In fact, previous
studies have demonstrated the heterogeneity of the expression of
these markers in CTCs as well as the discordance between CTCs
and primary tumors3,23. Utilizing Hydro-Seq, we were able to
detect expression of ER, PR, and HER2 in the CTCs (Supple-
mentary Fig. 9). Consistent with previous reports, we observed
intra-patient heterogeneity as well as discordant molecular pro-
files in CTCs compared to the reported phenotype of primary
tumors (Fig. 4a–d). However, unlike immunohistochemistry
which is limited to assessment of a small number of markers,
Hydro-Seq provides the comprehensive dataset on the expression
of thousands of genes/cell providing important insights regarding
cellular heterogeneity as well as identifying key cell regulatory
pathways in these cells.
Epithelial and mesenchymal state transition of CTCs. When
further investigating the molecular characteristics of CTCs, we
found they were readily separated by t-distributed stochastic
neighbor embedding (tSNE) to two subpopulations: Epithelial
(mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, or MET) cells with HER2+
expression
and
mesenchymal
(epithelial-to-mesenchymal

 transition, or EMT) cells with HER2- expression (Fig. 4a, and
Fig. 4o)24,25. The separation is independent of the number of
genes detected, the number of transcripts per cell, and the per-
centage of mitochondrial genes (Supplementary Fig. 10). MET-like
CTCs express epithelial markers, including E-cadherin (CDH1),
Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EPCAM), Keratin-8 (KRT8),
and Keratin-18 (KRT18) (Fig. 4e–h). In addition, HER2+ MET-
like CTCs have been previously reported to be proliferative,
consistent with high expression of cyclin D1 (CCND1) and c-jun
(JUN) in these cells (Fig. 4i, j)26. On the contrary, HER2− EMT-
like CTCs express the EMT associated PDK1, SERPINE1, tran-
scription factor ZEB2 as well as transforming growth factor β
(TGFB1) (Fig. 4k–n)27–29. These results confirm and extend
previous studies demonstrating heterogeneous nature of CTCs4.

 Cancer stem-like cells within CTCs. It has been previously
reported that CTCs are enriched for cells expressing a stem-like
phenotype (cancer stem-like cells, or CSCs) (Fig. 4p–u) that have
been reported to exist in alternate epithelial or mesenchymal
states23. The most well-documented epithelial CSC markers in
breast cancer are isoforms of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH),
while the mesenchymal CSC are characterized as CD44+ and
CD24−30,31. Consistent with previous reports, ALDH isoforms
are over-expressed in the MET-like CTCs (Fig. 4o and Fig. 4s)
along with other well-known CSC regulatory genes including
such as BMI1, GATA3, and SOX9 (Supplementary Fig. 8). The
CD44+/CD24− mesenchymal CSCs expressed the genes asso-
ciated with EMT, including vimentin (VIM) (Fig. 4o–r). Other
known CSC regulatory genes including STAT3, Notch 1, and
Notch 2 are also expressed in a sub-fraction of CTCs (Supple-
mentary Fig. 11). From the whole-transcriptome sequencing data,
Hydro-Seq enables the elucidation of pathway activation at
single-cell resolution. Furthermore, we could detect a small
population
of CSCs
that
simultaneously express
epithelial
(ALDH1A3) and mesenchymal (CD90, or THY1) markers
(Fig. 4t–u). The presence of these cells is consistent with recent
studies suggesting that CTCs simultaneously expressing epithelial
and mesenchymal markers may be endowed with the highest
degree of cellular plasticity and metastatic potential32,33.
Intra-patient CTC heterogeneity. In addition to substantial
inter-patient heterogeneity of transcriptome expression, we also
found considerable intra-patient heterogeneity. For example, we
detected both HER2+ MET-like and HER2− EMT-like CTCs
(Fig. 5) in the same patient with PR+ breast cancer. This intra-
patient heterogeneity would be missed by the detection techni-
ques utilizing pooled samples. Although EMT/MET cells could be
identified by staining markers, with Hydro-Seq whole-tran-
scriptome sequencing, we can further investigate the difference in
pathway regulation between subpopulations, and identify the
activation of ITG linked kinase signaling, E-cadherin and
Adherens junctions, and FAK kinases involved in EMT/MET
state transitions (Table 1)34,35. Previous studies have demon-
strated that tumor metastasis is dependent on the plasticity of
cancer stem-like cells to transition between epithelial and
mesenchymal states. Consistent with this concept, we found that
the EMT and MET CTCs have distinguishable activation of
crucial CSC regulation pathways, including c-Myc, PDGFR,

 RhoA, telomerase and ERB1 signaling (Table 1)36–40. These
results demonstrate the potential of Hydro-Seq in downstream
transcriptome analysis to provide insights into the biology of
CTCs and cancer metastasis.
Discussion
Although previous studies have demonstrated that CTC enu-
meration provides valuable prognostic information, molecular
analysis of these cells offers far greater potential for obtaining
biological, and clinical insights41. Hydro-Seq achieves the
molecular interrogation of CTCs with whole-transcriptome
analysis, identifying cellular heterogeneity of important clinical
and metastatic biomarkers. Utilizing hydrodynamic cell cap-
tures in parallel chambers, Hydro-Seq attains a high cell capture
efficiency to isolate the limited CTCs available for analysis
(Supplementary Table 3). The bead-cell-pairing chambers with
on-chip pneumatic valves enable the removal of contamination
and the isolation of chambers during transcript capture. Finally,
the chamber array scaling achieves high-throughput analysis
of CTCs.

 To analyze the molecular heterogeneity of CTCs, fluorescent
staining with ISH and IHC remains as the conventional way to
investigate CTC gene and protein expressions. To identify the
CTCs and exclude the leukocytes, the cells are typically stained
with a nucleus marker (DAPI or Hoechst), CD45, and pan-
cytokeratin (Pan-CK), where CTCs are usually the nucleated and
Pan-CK-positive cells and leukocytes are nucleated and CD45-
positive cells. Due to the bandwidth limitation in fluorescence
imaging, multiplex fluorescent assay can only achieve up to 6–7
channels (or markers) at a time. Considering the three markers
used for CTC identification, only 3–4 channels are available for
studies. Although it is possible to remove the antibodies and
apply new ones for staining, the procedure is repetitive and dif-
ficult to scale up42,43. Alternate way of analyzing the whole-
transcriptome profile of CTCs is to use serial cell picking to
isolate single cells in individual tubes for scRNA-seq2,12. The
CTCs are usually first identified by EpCAM or pan-cytokeratin
staining. Single-cell manipulation methods such as capillary
suction and dielectrophoretic microfluidics are then applied to
dispense target cells to different tubes for downstream processing.
Although this methodology has successfully achieved scRNA-seq
of CTCs, the serial picking process is laborious, low throughput,
and difficult to scale up the number of cells to analyze from each
sample, limiting its application for CTC heterogeneity studies.
Furthermore, the molecular selection of EpCAM and pan-
cytokeratin can miss important CTC subpopulations such as
the mesenchymal CTCs presented in this paper. Therefore, there
is a trade-off between the number of cells and genes for CTC
studies using these conventional methods. Fluorescent ISH and
IHC assay achieves high-throughput analysis of CTCs but with a
limited number of biomarkers available for analysis, preventing
the study of pathway regulation for treatment development. Cell
picking with scRNA-seq enables whole-transcriptome profiling of
CTCs but with a limited number of cells for analysis, limiting the
capability to study the cellular heterogeneity, which is a critical
characteristic of tumor cells. To overcome such limitation,
Hydro-Seq
achieves
both
high-throughput
and
whole-
transcriptome analysis of CTCs to access cellular heterogeneity
as well as to elucidate cell regulatory pathways. There are other
massive-parallel microfluidic techniques for scRNA-seq, such as
commercially available Fluidigm C1 system, DEPArray, Drop-
seq, etc. But these techniques cannot provide a high single-cell
capture efficiency for rare cells. The other challenge to overcome
is the massive contamination of residual erythrocytes in the size-
based CTC enriched samples. The inability to further remove the
contamination is detrimental to achieve high-fidelity single-cell
whole transcriptome sequencing results.
CTC analysis represents a promising alternative to analyze the
molecular property of cancer cells for treatment selection and
patient monitoring with the much less invasive venous blood
draw. Conventionally, physicians often need to collect the tissue
samples by invasive surgery or tumor biopsy for molecular tests.
In this study, we demonstrated that drug targets for breast cancer
including ER, PR, AR, and HER2 were successfully detected from
the CTCs, highlighting the potential use of Hydro-Seq for pre-
cision medicine applications. To further validate the value of
Hydro-Seq as a companion diagnostic tool, new clinical trials can
be initiated to study and compare the tumor profile between
CTCs and biopsy samples at the same time. Furthermore, the
ability to readily obtain these cells over time allows for assessment
of treatment effects as well as elucidating mechanisms of treat-
ment resistance. This may aid in treatment selection and patient
monitoring. In this context, Hydro-Seq provides an agnostic
companion diagnostic across a wide spectrum of cancer clinical
trials.
Since CTCs represent the metastatic tumor cells in the cir-
culatory system, scRNA-seq analysis of those cells also provides

 insights into the molecular regulation during cancer metastasis.
It was previously reported that cancer cells perform the tran-
sitions between epithelial and mesenchymal cell types for tumor
metastasis27,44–46. In the primary tumor, the epithelial type
cells are proliferative and cycling to reproduce cancer cells for
tumor growth. To acquire the increased motility and invade the
stroma, some cancer cells can perform the EMT to acquire the
mesenchymal cell property for cell migration and intravasation
into circulatory systems. These mesenchymal cells are also
quiescent, capable of staying dormancy and surviving the harsh
environment during circulation. To form a secondary tumor,
some CTCs can perform the extravasation to a distant tissue
and MET to restore the epithelial cell property, allowing the
cells to proliferate again for colonization. In our sequencing
results, the unsupervised learning tSNE algorithm was able
to cluster the CTCs into two populations with each expressing
EMT-related
and
MET-related
genes,
consistent
with
previous literature on metastasis47. Interestingly, most of the
CTCs
analyzed
in
this
study
were
mesenchymal
cells,
which would be missed using molecular CTC enrichment
methods48,49. Furthermore, we were able to identify a small
population of cells expressing the stemness markers repre-
senting both epithelial CSCs (ALDH) and mesenchymal CSCs
(CD44+/CD24−)30,50–52. These cells exhibit the cancer plas-
ticity to perform EMT/MET and further differentiate into
regular tumor cells. The results have validated the utility of
Hydro-Seq to study metastasis. Examination of other genes
expressed in these cell populations provides further insights
into their regulatory pathways.
In summary, we have developed Hydro-Seq, a platform, which
enables single-cell transcriptome analysis of rare and limited cell
populations such as CTCs with advantages over existing tech-
nologies including: (1) Size-based CTC isolation prevents the bias
caused by marker-based isolation and enables observing hetero-
geneity of CTCs; (2) High-efficiency and high-throughput CTC
profiling facilitates the discovery of rare CTC subtypes; and (3)
Whole-transcriptome sequencing of CTCs provides a compre-
hensive transcriptome analysis compared to the limited fluor-
escent staining techniques. We demonstrated the capability of
Hydro-Seq technology by performing single-cell transcriptome
analysis of 666 CTCs obtained from 21 patient samples. While
there are a number of CTC enrichment technologies that have
been developed and commercialized, Hydro-Seq provides a much
more advanced downstream analysis capability for molecular
characterization of CTCs at single-cell resolution beyond CTC
enrichment. This should be of great utility in therapeutic selec-
tion, monitoring of cancer patients, and fundamental under-
standing of metastasis and cellular heterogeneity of CTCs.
Methods
Device fabrication. The devices were made using soft lithography fabrication
processes. The multi-layer layout of the chip was designed using AutoCAD 2016
(Autodesk®). The masks for photolithography were made using a mask making
instrument (μPG 101, Heidelberg instruments). The mold for the flow channel was
fabricated with 10, 20, 40, and 100 µm thick SU-8 (Microchem) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. The valves were created using AZ®9260 (AZ Electronic
Materials) with a peak thickness of 15 µm and 45 µm, respectively, after thermal
reflow at 150 °C overnight to create a curved structure. The mold for the control
channels was fabricated with 20 µm SU-8. The SU-8 mold was treated by vaporized
Trichloro (1 H,1 H,2 H,2H-perfluorooctyl) Silane (448931 Aldrich) under vacuum
overnight to promote the release of cured PDMS. After coating, the mold was
heated at 150 °C on a hot plate for 10 min. PDMS (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) was
prepared by mixing with 10 (elastomer): 1(curing agent) (w/w) ratio, poured on the
flow channel molds, and cured at 85 °C overnight before peeling. A thin film of
PDMS was spun onto the control channel mold and cured at 85 °C for 1 h. After
peeling the PDMS from the flow control mold, the PDMS piece and the thin film
PDMS were treated using oxygen plasma (80 W for 60 s) and bonded using MJB3
aligner (Karl Suss). The devices after bonding were heated at 80 °C overnight to
ensure bonding quality.
Cell culture. Different cell lines, including MDA-MB-231 (ATCC® HTB-26™),
MDA-MB-231 GFP, HEK293 (ATCC® CRL-1573™), and 3T3 (ATCC® CRL-1658™)
were cultured in petri dishes for device testing. MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained
from Dr. Gary Luker’s Lab (University of Michigan, MI, USA). MDA-MB-231 GFP
cells were obtained from Dr. Celina Kleer’s Lab (University of Michigan, MI, USA).
HEK293 and 3T3 cells were obtained from Dr. Max Wicha’s Lab (University of
Michigan, MI, USA). The cell lines were authenticated and regularly checked to
exclude mycoplasma contamination in those labs. MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-231
GFP, HEK293 and 3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco 11965) with 10% FBS
(Gibco 10082) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco 15070). All the cells were
cultured and passaged when cells reached over 80% confluency in the dish.
Image acquisition. The microfluidic devices were imaged using an inverted
microscope (Nikon) with a XYZ motorized stage (ProScan II, Prior Scientific). The
bright-field and fluorescent images were taken with a ×4 objective and a ×10
objective, respectively, with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Coolsnap
HQ2, Photometrics). A FITC, a TRITC, and a UV-2A filter cube were used for the
fluorescent imaging. To ensure optimized image quality, auto-focusing was done
after imaging every 5 frames. After scanning, the Nikon NIS-Elements Basic
Research software module was used to stitch individual images to a large image for
analysis.
Sealing test. Before testing, the device was placed in a desiccator with vacuum
pressure for 20 min. After the vacuum process, the device was primed using a 5%
(w/w) PEO-terminated triblock polymer (Pluronic® F108, BASF) in DI water for
20 min. The small-molecule dye solution (fluorescein 5(6)-isothiocyanate, F3651,
Sigma–Aldrich, molecular weight of 389 Daltons) was used to test the leakage of
valves in Hydro-Seq chips. After flowing PBS through the chip, all chamber valves
were closed, and dye solution was introduced to the branch channel. The chip was
then imaged at 0, 10, and 20 min after dye introduction to test the sealing of
chambers.
Hydro-Seq device priming and preparation. For scRNA-sequencing, the device
was heated at 150 °C for 30 min. The device was then placed in a desiccator with
vacuum pressure for 20 min. After the vacuum process, the device was sanitized
using UV radiation and primed using a 5% (w/w) PEO-terminated triblock
polymer (Pluronic® F108, BASF) in DI water for 20 min. Before cell loading,
channels were washed by flowing through 150 µL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
To enable pneumatic valve control, the tubing filled with DI water was then
connected to the designated ports with a back pressure of 25PSI when activated.
The syringe pump was connected to the outlet of the chip to drive cell loading
process.
Cell capture efficiency test. MDA-MB-231 cells were first stained by green
CellTracker dye (ThermoFisher C2925) with 10 µM concentration following
manufacturer’s protocol and then suspended using Trypsin–EDTA (Gibco 25200).
Cell concentrations were first calculated using a hemocytometer, and cells were
diluted to a concentration of 500 cells/mL. The suspended cells were sampled three
times by loading 100 µL of the solution to a well in a 96-well plate. Each well was
imaged to count the number of cells and verify that each 100 µL solution contains
50 cells in average. After sampling, another 100 µL cell solution was then loaded to
the Hydro-Seq chip by directly inserting the pipette tip to the inlet. The solution
was then loaded with a flow rate of 10 µL/min until emptying the pipette tip.
During cell loading, bead valves and wash channels were closed to prevent cells
from passing by. After loading the cells, the pipette tip was then removed and
another 20 µL PBS was added to the inlet and loaded to ensure all the cells in the
inlet and branching channels entered the cell-capture chamber array. The number
of captured cells was then quantified by large-area fluorescent imaging. The
washing protocol was applied to the captured cells. During the washing cycle, the
bead valves were opened and 100 µL of PBS was flushed with a flow rate of 50 µL/
min from the inlet to the outlet. After flushing, the bead valves were closed again.
Then, 100 µL of fresh PBS was added to the outlet and withdrawn from the outlet
to the inlet by a pipette. The withdrawn 100 µL solution was then reloaded back to
the chip again with a flow rate of 10 µL/min. The chip was imaged again using
fluorescent microscopy to evaluate the number of captured cells after washing.
Finally, the beads were loaded with a 150 µL bead solution with 10k beads/mL
concentration at a flow rate of 50 µL/min. During the bead loading, only the wash
channels at the upstream branch channels remained closed. After bead loading, the
chip was imaged again using fluorescent microscopy to quantify the number of
bead-cell pairs.
Cell capture efficiency test of the enriched spike samples. MDA-MB-231 cells
were first stained by green CellTracker dye (ThermoFisher C2925) with 10 µM
concentration following manufacturer’s protocol and then suspended using
Trypsin–EDTA (Gibco 25200). Cell concentrations were first calculated using a
hemocytometer, and cells were diluted to a concentration of 2000 cells/mL. one
hundred microliter of the cell solution was then spiked to 7 mL of whole blood
from healthy donors. The blood sample was then processed by Celsee following
manufacturer’s protocol (https://www.celsee.com/). The enriched CTC sample was

 then spun down to 200 µL from 4 mL. The solution was then pipetted up and down
gently for mixing. After mixing, the first 100 µL solution was used for cell loading
following the protocol in cell capture efficiency test. The second 100 µL solution
was then taken to a well in 96-well plate to quantify the number of cells in the
enriched sample. The well was scanned after 30 min to ensure cells precipitate to
the bottom of the well for fluorescent imaging.
Species-mixing experiment. HEK293 cells were stained with CellTracker Red
(ThermoFisher C34552), and 3T3 cells were stained with CellTracker Green
(ThermoFisher C2925) following manufacturer’s protocol. HEK293 and 3T3
cells were suspended using Trypsin–EDTA (Gibco 25200) and diluted into 25k
cells/mL in PBS. The cell suspension solution was then loaded into the device
inlet and cells were driven into the chip by syringe pump with a flow rate of
10 µL/min. The valves in the bead capture sites were closed during cell loading.
After cell loading, all valves were closed and the residual cells in the inlet and
channels were washed away using PBS. Beads stored in TE buffer were then re-
suspended in PBS twice and loaded into the chip with 20k beads/mL by gravity
flow. During the loading, all the chamber valves were opened to enable bead-cell
pairing inside the chambers while wash channels remained closed. Since the
beads settle down easily in the inlet, it was required to pipette up and down
during the loading process to redistribute beads in the suspension. After bead-
cell pairing, the chamber valves were again closed, and wash channels were
opened to allow cell lysis buffer to flow into the branch channel. Then, the
chamber valves were opened for 5 s to allow lysis buffer to enter the chamber for
cell lysis. After lysis, the devices were tilted to move the beads to cell capture site
and incubated for 20 min for mRNA capture. Finally, the valves were opened,
and beads were retrieved by drawing 200 µL of PBS from the outlet to the inlet
using a pipette. The retrieved beads were then processed for sequencing
according to the Drop-seq protocol.
Patient sample CTC sequencing experiments. Whole blood was obtained from
adult patients with metastatic breast cancer at the University of Michigan Rogel
Cancer Center. The blood collection complied with standard ethical regulations
pertaining to work with human subjects; the research protocol and informed
consent were approved by the University of Michigan Medical School Institutional
Review Board (IRBMED). All subjects were consented by a study team member
prior to the blood draw. For experiments with Labyrinth purified samples, the
blood samples (~10 mL) were processed using the protocol reported in a prior
literature7. For experiments with Celsee purified samples, the blood samples
(~10 mL) were processed by the Celsee PREP100 system following manufacturer’s
protocol. For both technologies, the samples were spun down to 100 µL volume
after CTC enrichment. After device priming and preparation, the CTC suspension
was loaded to the device by inserting the pipette tip filled with the 100 µL solution
to the inlet. After closing all the wash channels and bead valves, the CTC sus-
pension was loaded to the chip with a flow rate of 10 µL/min driven by a syringe
pump. After emptying the pipette tip, the tip was removed and 100 µL PBS was
added to the inlet. After washing with PBS at 10 µL/min for 2 min, the bead valves
were opened, and the flow rate was increased to 50 µL/min to wash away residual
red blood cells in the chamber. The PBS solution was refilled during the wash
process. After washing for 3 min, the flow was stopped, and bead valves were closed
again. To further remove contaminating cells in the chamber, 100 µL PBS was
added to the outlet and a pipette tip was inserted to the inlet to retrieve the solution
using a pipette. Then, the solution was loaded back to the chip and washed again
using the same protocol in the first loading. After loading CTCs, the beads were
loaded to the chip and prepared following the same procedure described in the
species-mixing session.
Gene sequencing. We obtained beads from the Hydro-Seq chip and processed the
beads following the Drop-seq protocol including RT (using Thermofisher Maxima
RT kit), PCR (using Kapa HiFi Hotstart PCR Readymix), and library preparation
(using Illumina Nextera XT Library Prep Kit)17. The DNA samples were quantified
and pooled by the University of Michigan Sequencing Core for sequencing. We
pooled 10 samples to be sequenced using a NextSeq 500 mid-output sequencing
lane. Each population is expected to have approximately 10 million reads (paired-
end: one side 25 base pairs for barcode and the other side 115 base pairs for mRNA
quantification).
Read alignment and data analysis. The sequencing reads were aligned using
STAR and processed by Drop-seq_tools-1.12 (https://github.com/broadinstitute/
Drop-seq/releases) flow suggested by Drop-seq17. Then, gene sequencing data were
analyzed using Seurat, an R package for single-cell analysis (http://satijalab.org/
seurat/). Cells with more than 800 genes detected were considered to be success-
fully captured and analyzed. The cells having more than 5% mitochondrial gene
expression were discarded for their poor viability. White blood cells (WBCs) were
removed by eliminating any barcode with more than 0.01% of CD45 (PTPRC)
expression. Erythrocytes were removed by eliminating any barcode with more than
1% of hemoglobin expression. The residual barcodes were considered healthy
CTCs for further analysis. The patients having less than 5 CTCs were excluded. All
ALDH isoforms were pooled together as PanALDH genes for analysis. The gene
expression was log-normalized for principal component analysis (PCA) and t-
distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) methods. Cell clustering was
performed based on the shared nearest neighbor (SNN) method. For pathway
analysis, 1000 significant top-ranked genes were identified using Seurat. Then, the
significantly differential genes were applied to Enrichr (http://amp.pharm.mssm.
edu/Enrichr/), and the pathway dataset of NCI-Nature 2016 was used.
