IMPORTANCE The impact of a biomarker-based (personalized) cancer treatment strategy in
the setting of phase 1 clinical trials was analyzed.
OBJECTIVE To compare patient outcomes in phase 1 studies that used a biomarker selection
strategy with those that did not.
DATA SOURCES PubMed search of phase 1 cancer drug trials (January 1, 2011, through
December 31, 2013).
STUDY SELECTION Studies included trials that evaluated single agents, and reported efficacy
end points (at least response rate [RR]).
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were extracted independently by 2 investigators.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Response rate and progression-free survival (PFS) were
compared for arms that used a personalized strategy (biomarker selection) vs those that did
not. Overall survival was not analyzed owing to insufficient data.
RESULTS A total of 346 studies published in the designated 3-year time period were included
in the analysis. Multivariable analysis (meta-regression and weighted multiple regression
models) demonstrated that the personalized approach independently correlated with a
significantly higher median RR (30.6% [95% CI, 25.0%-36.9%] vs 4.9% [95% CI,
4.2%-5.7%]; P < .001) and a longer median PFS (5.7 [95% CI, 2.6-13.8] vs 2.95 [95% CI,
2.3-3.7] months; P < .001). Targeted therapy arms that used a biomarker-based selection
strategy (n = 57 trials) were associated with statistically improved RR compared with targeted
therapy arms (n = 177 arms) that did not (31.1% [95% CI, 25.4%-37.4%] vs 5.1% [95% CI,
4.3%-6.0%]; P < .001). Nonpersonalized targeted arms had outcomes comparable with
those that tested a cytotoxic agent (median RR, 5.1% [95% CI, 4.3%-6.0%] vs 4.7% [95% CI,
3.6%-6.2%]; P = .63; respectively; median PFS, 3.3 [95% CI, 2.6-4.0] months vs 2.5 [95% CI,
2.0-3.7] months; P = .22). Personalized arms using a “
genomic (DNA) biomarker”had higher
median RR than those using a “protein biomarker”(42.0% [95% CI, 33.7%-50.9%] vs 22.4%
[95% CI, 15.6%-30.9%]; P = .001). The median treatment-related mortality was not
statistically different for arms that used a personalized strategy vs not (1.89% [95% CI,
1.36%-2.61%] vs 2.27% [95% CI, 1.97%-2.62%]; P = .31).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this meta-analysis, most phase 1 trials of targeted agents
did not use a biomarker-based selection strategy. However, use of a biomarker-based
approach was associated with significantly improved outcomes (RR and PFS). Response rates
were significantly higher with genomic vs protein biomarkers. Studies that used targeted
agents without a biomarker had negligible response rates.

understanding of the mechanisms driving the de-
velopment and progression of cancers, the use of
drugs targeting anomalies identified in tumors from patients
with cancer has become possible. Indeed, the main objective
of “precision” or “personalized” medicine is to select pa-
tients (with a protein or genomic biomarker) who might ben-
efit from a specific therapy.
In the past, most drugs were approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) without a biomarker to select pa-
tients likely to benefit, including most cytotoxic chemothera-
pies and some targeted agents. Currently, more and more tar-
geted agents are in development and strategies to maximize
their benefit by selecting patients are also being investigated.
There are already successful examples of drugs approved by
the FDA with a companion diagnostic test to identify a pre-
dictive biomarker, such as vemurafenib for BRAF V600E mu-
tation in melanoma,1 erlotinib for patients whose tumors have
EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution
mutations,2 or crizotinib for patients with metastatic non–
small-cell lung cancer whose tumors are anaplastic lym-
phoma kinase–aberrant.3 As a consequence of high response
rates (RRs) with new paradigms for patient selection, some re-
cent trials leading to FDA approval were nonrandomized,
single-arms studies (eg, the recent approval of crizotinib
for ROS-1–positive tumors in metastatic patients with non–
small-cell lung cancer4). In addition, we can expect that se-
lecting patients likely to benefit from a treatment might al-
low studies to be performed in smaller numbers of patients.
Asanexample,in2006imatinibwasapprovedasasingleagent
for the treatment of multiple conditions associated with Abl,
Kit, or PDGFR protein tyrosine kinase abnormalities (derma-
tofibrosarcoma protuberans, myelodysplastic and/or myelo-
proliferative diseases, aggressive systemic mastocytosis, hy-
pereosinophilicsyndrome/chroniceosinophilicleukemia)with
patient populations matched to drug ranging from 5 to 14
patients.5,6 The extent to which this strategy is generalizable
is the subject of the current analysis.
In this study, we focused our analysis on 346 studies of
phase 1 clinical trials of cancer drugs published between Janu-
ary 2011 and December 2013. Phase 1 studies are designed to
test a new drug or drug combination in a small group of pa-
tients to evaluate safety (through successive dose escalation
steps)andtodetectresponsesignals(albeittraditionallyassec-
ondary end points).
Our goal was to compare patient outcomes between stud-
ies that used a personalized approach (selecting patients with
a cognate biomarker) with those that did not in the early clini-
cal trial setting.
Methods
Search Strategy and Study Selection
A search was conducted using PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm
.nih.gov/pubmed), using the word “cancer” in the search
toolbar. “Clinical Trials, Phase 1,” “Publication dates from
January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2013,” and studies in
“Humans”wereselectedasadditionalfilters.This3-yearperiod
was chosen because we believed this period would include
enough personalized and nonpersonalized trials. (The 3-year
period was chosen before starting data extraction.) Studies
describing combination treatments, supportive care,
locoregional treatments, drugs targeting hormonal receptors,
aswellascellular,viral,orvaccinetherapytrialswereexcluded.
Pediatric studies as well as clinical trials restricted to brain
tumors were also excluded (penetrance of blood-brain barrier
unknown). Whenever possible, if a study comprised both a
biomarker-selected population and a nonselected group (eg,
in the case of several histologies included but one had the
cognate biomarker as disease characteristic), the data were
extracted separately and categorized as personalized and
nonpersonalized, respectively. This was the case for 5 studies.
eFigure 2 in the Supplement depicts, in diagrammatic form,
the study inclusion and/or exclusion steps and the full list of
references can be found in the eReferences in the Supplement.
Data Extraction and Categorization
Data extraction was conducted independently by 2 investiga-
tors (M.S. and M.Z.) and categorization was validated in fre-
quent meetings in the presence of the moderator (R.K.). To be
included, the study had to describe a phase 1 cancer drug trial
published between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2013;
evaluate a drug as a single agent; and report adequate effi-
cacy end points (at least RR). All deaths reported by investi-
gators as “possibly,
” “probably,
” or “definitely” related to treat-
ment were considered toxicity-related deaths.
For assessment of the RRs, only complete and partial re-
sponses (CR and PR, respectively) were considered. Median
progression-free survival (PFS) (or time-to treatment progres-
sion (TTP) if PFS was not reported) and overall survival (OS)
were extracted, as well as their corresponding 95% CIs when-
ever available.
For the purpose of our analysis we defined personalized
therapy when a treatment met one of the following criteria:
(1) test for a cognate biomarker used for treatment selection
or (2) no cognate biomarker used, but at least 50% of patients
areknowntoharborthecognatebiomarker.Fulldetailsofdefi-
nition for personalized vs nonpersonalized therapies can be
found in the eMethods in the Supplement.
Key Points
Question Does the use of a biomarker to select patients in phase 1
trials improve efficacy outcomes?
Findings The meta-analysis of 346 phase 1 trial including 13 203
patients found that using a biomarker-based selection strategy
was associated with improved response rate (median, 30.6% vs
4.9%) and progression-free survival (median, 5.7 vs 2.95 months).
Targeted arms that did not use a biomarker had median response
rates comparable with those of the arms that tested a cytotoxic
agent.
Meaning A biomarker-based (personalized) approach to phase 1
drug development is associated with improved outcomes, even in
a refractory cancer population.

Statistical Analysis
We performed a meta-analysis using a random effects model,7
as this model takes into account for both between and within
studyheterogeneity.Wealsoperformedamultivariablepooled
analysis of the RR and PFS data using the weighted least-
squares method to account for the size effects. Random ef-
fects meta-regression models (linear mixed model) were used
to assess the relationship between the estimates and person-
alized therapy status, adjusted for other potential confound-
ers and/or mediators, as appropriate. Note that the weighted
least-squares method under the multivariable pooled analy-
sis can address the potential small sample size bias (publica-
tion bias) better, while the random effects meta-regression
model is more appropriate for dealing with the between study
heterogeneity.8,9 Both methods were applied such that the re-
sults can be compared to provide a robust inference. The data
were stratified, and only the significant variables in univari-
ableanalysiswereincludedinmultivariableanalysis(eg,meta-
regressions). Nonsignificant covariates were dropped from the
model, with the final model containing only significant covar-
iates in the multivariable analyses. Assessment of continu-
ous variables between independent samples was done using
a Wilcoxon rank sum test. Two-sided P ≤ .05 was considered
statisticallysignificant.Statisticalanalyseswereperformedand
reviewed by M.S. and J.J.L. using SPSS software (version 22)
and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (CMA; version 3).
More details about the statistical analysis can be found in the
eMethods in the Supplement.
Results
Search Results and Clinical Trial Characteristics
Our initial PubMed search identified 1854 results. After a care-
ful review of the titles, only 440 studies met our selection cri-
teria(describedintheMethodssection).Acomprehensiveread-
ing of these 440 studies led to the exclusion of 94 additional
studies, resulting in the inclusion of a total of 346 studies pub-
lished in the designated 3-year time period (January 2011–
December 2013) (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
In total, 351 arms comprising 13 203 patients were in-
cluded (including 5 studies that were dichotomized into 2 dif-
ferentarms,1ofwhichusedabiomarker-selectionstrategyand
the other did not). There were 117 arms using a cytotoxic agent,
andallexcept1ofthemwereconsiderednonpersonalized.Con-
versely, 234 arms used a targeted agent, with 75.6% (177 of 234)
being nonpersonalized and 24.4% (57 of 234) being personal-
ized (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Fifty-eight arms were per-
sonalized and accrued a total of 2655 patients compared with
293 arms for trials using a nonpersonalized strategy (10 548 pa-
tients).Personalizedandnonpersonalizedarmsbothhadame-
dian number of 30 patients per arm.
In our data set, 184 of the 351 arms (52.4%) had an RR
greater than 0% (167 studies had a 0% RR). In a multivariable
analysis, the factors that correlated most significantly with an
RR greater than 0% were (1) the use of a personalized strategy
vs not (86.2% vs 45.7%; P < .001); (2) a higher number of pa-
tients included in the study (62.7% if more than 30 patients
vs 42.9% if 30 or fewer; P < .001); and (3) if study drugs were
FDA/European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved by the time
of the current analysis (75% vs 45.3%; P < .001) (eTable2 in the
Supplement).
Targeted Agents Subanalysis
Of note, while most of the personalized arms (98.3%) used tar-
geted agents, the majority of the arms using targeted agents
used a nonpersonalized approach, that is, they did not select
patientsusingacognatebiomarker(76%).Asubanalysiswithin
targeted arms (n = 234 arms) showed that across both a pooled
and meta-analysis, targeted arms using a personalized strat-
egy had a statistically higher RR compared with targeted arms
thatlackedapersonalizedapproach(P < .001)(seeeTable3and
eFigure 1A in the Supplement). In addition, personalized arms
using targeted agents led, in 86% of cases, to a RR greater than
0% compared with only 49% in nonpersonalized arms using
targeted agents (P < .001) (see eTable 3 in the Supplement). Of
interest, nonpersonalized targeted arms had outcomes com-
parable with arms that tested a cytotoxic agent (median RR,
5.1% and 4.7%; P = .63; respectively; median PFS, 3.3 vs 2.5
months; P = .22).
Association of Personalized Therapy With Higher RRs
The meta-analysis demonstrated that the use of a personal-
ized approach (n = 58 arms) led to a median RR of 31% vs 5%
when a nonpersonalized strategy was used (n = 293 arms)
(P < .001). The other variables that correlated with higher RR
were hematologic malignant neoplasms vs solid tumors (21%
vs 4%; P < .001), if the agent was FDA/EMA approved by the
time of the current analysis (17% vs 5%; P < .001), or the use
of a targeted drug (7.8% vs 4.7%; P = .003).
In a meta-regression analysis including the previously
mentioned variables that were significant (P ≤ .05), the use of
a personalized approach correlated independently with a
higherRR,andwasthemostsignificantcovariableinthemodel
(eTable 4 and eFigure 1B in the Supplement; Figure 1). Outli-
ers of response have also been analyzed (eResults in the
Supplement).
Personalized Therapy Subanalysis
We investigated if there was a difference in outcome when the
biomarker was a protein (eg, protein overexpression) vs a ge-
nomic alteration. Across the meta-analysis and the pooled-
analysis, median RRs were significantly higher (42% vs 22.4%
[P = .001; meta-analysis]; 42% vs 18% [P = .008; pooled analy-
sis]) if the biomarker was a genomic alteration (eTable 6 and
eFigure 1C in the Supplement). Of note, the type of targeted
drug (small molecule vs antibody) highly correlated with the
type of biomarker used (P < .001). Indeed, 95% of the person-
alized studies that used a genomic biomarker (20 of 21 stud-
ies) tested a targeted small molecule. In comparison, 35% of
thepersonalizedtrialsthatusedaproteinbiomarkertestedtar-
geted small molecules (13 of 37 studies), while most tested an-
tibodies (21 of 37 [56.8%]) (the 3 remaining studies were test-
ingarecombinantprotein,ananoparticle,andacytotoxicdrug,
respectively). Because only 1 trial with a genomic biomarker
was applied to an antibody, a robust multivariate analysis was

not possible. However, the median RR for the 20 studies of
small molecules with a genomic biomarker was 41.4%,
while that for the 13 studies of small molecules with a pro-
tein biomarker was 25% (P = .05), suggesting that genomic
biomarkers had a more significant correlation with salutary
effects.

Association of Personalized Therapy With Longer PFS
We performed a pooled analysis including all the studies that
reported a median PFS (n = 45 studies). The following factors
were significantly correlated with a longer PFS: (1) the use of
a personalized strategy (5.70 vs 2.95 months); (2) hemato-
logic malignant neoplasms vs solid tumors (4.30 vs 2.80
months); (3) drugs that were FDA/EMA approved by the time
of the current analysis (4.51 vs 2.80 months), and (4) orally ad-
ministered agents vs injectables (3.80 vs 2.34 months), all with
P < .05. In the multivariable analysis (multiple linear regres-
sion using a weighted least-squares model), only a personal-
ized strategy and hematologic tumors remained indepen-
dent predictors of a longer PFS, with P < .001 and P = .02,
respectively (eTable 5, eFigures 1D and 2C in the Supplement;
Figure 2).
Survival Analysis
Survival were not analyzed owing to insufficient data (data
were provided in only 27 of 346 studies [n = 4 were personal-
ized studies]).
Outcome Subanalysis
Stratification by Tumor Type—Solid Tumors
vs Hematologic Malignant Neoplasms
We conducted a subanalysis stratifying the studies per-
formed in solid (n = 272) and hematologic malignant neo-
plasms (n = 79) because this variable significantly correlated
with both the RR and PFS. In the meta-analysis, the use of a
personalized approach was associated with higher RR in trials
investigating solid tumors (24.5% vs 4.5% for a nonpersonal-
ized strategy; P < .001). Trials investigating hematologic tu-
mors using a personalized strategy achieved a 24.5% RR vs
13.5%forthosethatwerenotpersonalized;P < .001.Thepooled
analysis also showed a benefit from the use of a personalized
therapy, with P < .001 (see eTable 7 in the Supplement).
For the PFS analysis, in both solid and hematologic tu-
mors, trials using a personalized approach reached longer PFS
(4.1 vs 2.8 months in solid tumors; 13.6 vs 4.0 months in
hematologic tumors) although the difference was not statis-
tically significant (see eTable 7 in the Supplement).
Stratification by FDA/EMA Approval
For the RR analysis, 84 studies tested drugs that were ap-
proved by regulatory agencies compared with 267 not ap-
proved at the time of our analysis. In the meta-analysis and
within studies that used an agent later approved by the FDA/
EMA, personalized trials achieved a 50% RR vs 8.8% for those
that did not (P < .001). Among studies that used agents not
currently FDA/EMA approved, personalized trials reached a
16.5% RR vs 4.2% (P < .001). Comparable results were ob-
tained in the pooled analysis (see eTable 8 in the Supple-
ment). The list of agents and classification can be found in
eTable 9 in the Supplement.
For the PFS analysis, within the 16 studies of drugs
that have been approved (and had a median PFS reported),
personalized trials had a median PFS of 9.7 months vs 3.8
for nonpersonalized trials (P = .04) (see eTable 8 in the
Supplement).
Mortality Rate Analysis
Results from a meta-analysis established that median treat-
ment-related mortality rate was 1.89% (95% CI, 1.36%-2.61%)
for arms that used a personalized strategy vs 2.27% (95% CI,
1.97%-2.62%) for nonpersonalized arms, which was not

cluded that there was no statistical difference between arms
that used a cytotoxic agent vs a targeted agent (2.4% [95% CI,
1.9-3.0] vs 2.1% [95% CI, 1.8-2.5]; P = .38).
Discussion
We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis as well as a
weighted pooled analysis of phase 1 studies testing single
agents within a 3-year period. To our knowledge, this is the
largest analysis of its type of phase 1 trials, including 346
trials for a total of 13 203 patients. In our analyses of both RR
and PFS, the use of a personalized strategy was the variable
that correlated best with significantly improved outcomes in
multivariable analysis. In addition, we showed that, within
personalized studies, the nature of the biomarker used for
patient selection had importance, because patient selection
using genomic biomarkers (eg, mutation and/or amplifica-
tion) was associated with a higher RR than “protein”
biomarkers (eg, protein overexpression), with in the meta-
analysis. Importantly, targeted agents were not by them-
selves more effective than cytotoxic agents. Indeed, the
median RR for targeted agents developed without a bio-
marker was only 5.1%, which was comparable with the 4.7%
RR for cytotoxic agents. However, biomarker-driven phase 1
trials of targeted agents demonstrated significantly higher
median RR of 31.1% (eTable 3 and eFigure 1A in the Supple-
ment). Of interest in this regard, a meta-analysis performed
on phase 2 studies demonstrated that targeted drugs used
without biomarker selection had significantly poorer out-
comes than cytotoxic agents, with a median RR of 4% vs
11.9%, respectively; median PFS of 2.6 vs 3.3 months, respec-
tively (P < .001 for all comparisons); and median OS of 8.7 vs
9.4 months (P < .05).10 Taken together, these data suggest
that the poorest outcomes are associated with the use of tar-
geted agents in a nonpersonalized strategy, while targeted
personalized therapy correlated with the best outcomes.
Consistent with our results, this meta-analysis as well as one
looking at clinical trials leading to FDA approval also con-
cluded that a personalized approach consistently and inde-
pendently correlated with higher median RR, prolonged
median PFS and OS.10,11 Personalized therapy was safe, as
toxic death rates in personalized arms were no different from
those in nonpersonalized arms (1.89% vs 2.27%; P = .31). It is
interesting that in a previous meta-analysis of 32 149 patients
on phase 2 studies,10 personalized therapy was associated
with lower rates of toxic deaths (1.52% vs 2.26%; P < .001).
Other interesting observations also emerged from this
analysis. For instance, use of a genomic biomarker had more
impact than use of a protein biomarker (median RR = 42% vs
22.4%; P = .001; meta-analysis). The superiority of genomic
biomarkers has been reported previously.10 Because of the di-
rect relevance of proteins to function, it is plausible that, with
time, the predictive power of protein markers will be refined.
Indeed, with our knowledge and technology expanding, the
simple 1-dimensional genomic drivers will soon be supple-
mented or replaced by multiple profiling tests, including pro-
teomic biomarkers, which are driven by a multitude of ge-
nomic contributors.
Also intriguing is that superperformer and/or outlier trials
with very high efficacy (RR ≥ 60%) were personalized in 8 of
9 cases, again emphasizing the importance or early bio-
marker development.
Conducting a meta-analysis using the random-effects
model is the most appropriate method to analyze combined
andheterogeneousresults.Whilethiswaspossibleforthecom-
parisonofRRs(thenumberofrespondersandsamplesizewere
used to compute the analysis), it was not feasible for the PFS
analysis because most of the arms reporting median PFS did
not include their 95% CIs. For this reason, we also used a
weighted pooled analysis for the multiple linear regressions
models to account for effect size and potential confounders.
Similar to the meta-regression models, the weighted linear re-
gression analysis showed that personalized therapy was in-
dependently associated with increased RR and prolonged PFS.
Survival is, of course, a crucial end point for patients. Pre-
vious meta-analyses of phase 2 and 3 studies showed that sur-
vival was improved with the use of a biomarker-based strat-
egy to select treatment.10,11 For the phase 1 studies analyzed
herein,survivalcouldnotbeassessed,asitwasreportedinonly
a small minority of studies.
Our conclusion that selecting patients with a biomarker is
associated with significantly improved outcomes is also con-
sistent with those of several prior studies conducted in vari-
ous tumors types.12-20 Additional trials, such as NCI-MATCH
and ASCO TAPUR, have recently been launched.21-27 Even so,
not all trials support this approach. SHIVA,28,29 a randomized
clinical trial, showed no benefit for a personalized strategy for
treatmentassignment. However,thistrialmayhavebeenham-
pered by the large number of patients with advanced disease
who were treated with single-agent hormone modulators or
everolimus, both of which are strategies that have been shown
not to work well in this setting.29
Because expedited approval pathways that can acceler-
ate drug development often require demonstration of effi-
cacyinearly-phasetrials,theapplicationofpersonalizedmedi-
cine (molecular tumor profiling for matched therapy) is
increasingly seen in phase 1 studies.30,31 Nevertheless, incor-
porating biomarkers in early-phase drug development has in-
herent challenges. For instance, because most advanced can-
cers have multiple genetic aberrations, the sensitivity to a
targeted drug can be abrogated by secondary molecular al-
terations. In addition, the development of companion diag-
nostics can be expensive, and the value of single gene diag-
nostics in the era of multigene panels is a matter of debate.
There were several limitations relevant to the present
study. First, we included only arms reporting single agents that
were published over a limited 3-year period of time (2011-
2013), and the omission of certain studies (eg, testing hor-
monal agents) and nonpublished study results could have lent
some bias in favor of any of the variables. Second, we have to
acknowledge that the variety of phase 1 study designs (eg, first
in humans or not, dose escalation vs expansion) might have
introducedheterogeneityinourdataset.Forinstance,itisplau-
sible that patients receiving lower doses during drug escala-

tion might have less robust responses. However, it should be
noted that the effect of dose on response is not clear-cut in the
eraoftargetedtherapy.32,33Forcytotoxicchemotherapy,where
dose is known to correlate with response, RRs may have been
underestimated for patients treated in the dose escalation part
of the study.34 Another limitation was that studies with com-
bination therapy were not analyzed because they would have
added an additional layer of difficult-to-dissect heteroge-
neity to our study. Also, trials with zero RRs typically did not
report PFS, and in most studies reporting a PFS, 95% CIs were
not available. Another intrinsic limitation arises from the fact
that patient follow-up times may vary between trials, produc-
ing heterogeneity in the estimation of median PFS.35 Finally,
the low number of studies reporting OS (n = 27) was insuffi-
cient for us to analyze survival as an end point of our study.
