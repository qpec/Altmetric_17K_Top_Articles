Abstract
Background
Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) plus
amodiaquine (AQ), given each month during the transmission season, is recommended for
children living in areas of the Sahel where malaria transmission is highly seasonal. The rec-
ommendation for SMC is currently limited to children under five years of age, but, in many
areas of seasonal transmission, the burden in older children may justify extending this age
limit. This study was done to determine the effectiveness of SMC in Senegalese children up
to ten years of age.
Methods and Findings
SMC was introduced into three districts over three years in central Senegal using a
stepped-wedge cluster-randomised design. A census of the population was undertaken
and a surveillance system was established to record all deaths and to record all cases of
malaria seen at health facilities. A pharmacovigilance system was put in place to detect
adverse drug reactions. Fifty-four health posts were randomised. Nine started implementa-
tion of SMC in 2008, 18 in 2009, and a further 18 in 2010, with 9 remaining as controls. In
the first year of implementation, SMC was delivered to children aged 3–59 months; the age
range was then extended for the latter two years of the study to include children up to 10
years of age. Cluster sample surveys at the end of each transmission season were done to
measure coverage of SMC and the prevalence of parasitaemia and anaemia, to monitor
molecular markers of drug resistance, and to measure insecticide-treated net (ITN) use.

Funding: This study was funded by the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation, grant number 40099.
 Entomological monitoring and assessment of costs of delivery in each health post and of
community attitudes to SMC were also undertaken. About 780,000 treatments were admin-
istered over three years. Coverage exceeded 80% each month. Mortality, the primary end-
point, was similar in SMC and control areas (4.6 and 4.5 per 1000 respectively in children
under 5 years and 1.3 and 1.2 per 1000 in children 5-9 years of age; the overall mortality
rate ratio [SMC: no SMC] was 0.90, 95% CI 0.68–1.2, p = 0.496). A reduction of 60% (95%
CI 54%–64%, p < 0.001) in the incidence of malaria cases confirmed by a rapid diagnostic
test (RDT) and a reduction of 69% (95% CI 65%–72%, p < 0.001) in the number of treat-
ments for malaria (confirmed and unconfirmed) was observed in children. In areas where
SMC was implemented, incidence of confirmed malaria in adults and in children too old to
receive SMC was reduced by 26% (95% CI 18%–33%, p < 0.001) and the total number of
treatments for malaria (confirmed and unconfirmed) in these older age groups was reduced
by 29% (95% CI 21%–35%, p < 0.001). One hundred and twenty-three children were admit-
ted to hospital with a diagnosis of severe malaria, with 64 in control areas and 59 in SMC
areas, showing a reduction in the incidence rate of severe disease of 45% (95% CI 5%–
68%, p = 0.031). Estimates of the reduction in the prevalence of parasitaemia at the end of
the transmission season in SMC areas were 68% (95% CI 35%–85%) p = 0.002 in 2008,
84% (95% CI 58%–94%, p < 0.001) in 2009, and 30% (95% CI -130%–79%, p = 0.56) in
2010. SMC was well tolerated with no serious adverse reactions attributable to SMC drugs.
Vomiting was the most commonly reported mild adverse event but was reported in less
than 1% of treatments. The average cost of delivery was US$0.50 per child per month, but
varied widely depending on the size of the health post. Limitations included the low rate of
mortality, which limited our ability to detect an effect on this endpoint.
Conclusions
SMC substantially reduced the incidence of outpatient cases of malaria and of severe
malaria in children, but no difference in all-cause mortality was observed. Introduction of
SMC was associated with an overall reduction in malaria incidence in untreated age
groups. In many areas of Africa with seasonal malaria, there is a substantial burden in older
children that could be prevented by SMC. SMC in older children is well tolerated and effec-
tive and can contribute to reducing malaria transmission.

Author Summary
Why was this study done?
• SMC was originally intended for children under five years of age. In many areas of the
sub-Sahel, there is a substantial burden of malaria in older children; this may justify
extending the age range of SMC.

 • This study was done in central Senegal to evaluate the effectiveness of SMC when given
to children up to ten years of age.
What did the researchers do and find?
• SMC was introduced into the area servedby 54 health posts by district health teams over
three years using a randomised stepped-wedge design.
• Malaria cases were detected at outpatient clinics and in hospitals, and deaths were
recorded through a demographic surveillancesystem.
• SMC reduced the incidence of malaria in children up to ten years of age by 60%. No
reduction in all-cause child deaths was observed,but the incidence of severe malaria was
reduced by 45%.
• SMC administered to children up to ten years of age led to a reduction in malaria inci-
dence in older age groups by 26%.
What do these findings mean?
• SMC given to children up to ten years of age is highly effective in preventing malaria in
children and can contribute to reducing overall malaria transmission.
• SMC programmes have started in 11 countries. In many of these countries, there is a
substantial burden of malaria in older children. The findings of this study indicate that a
much greater impact could be achieved by extending the age range of SMC.
Introduction
In 2012, WHO recommended that children under five years of age living in areas of highly sea-
sonal malaria transmission in the Sahel and sub-Sahel should receive seasonal malaria chemo-
prevention (SMC) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) plus amodiaquine (AQ) for up to
four months of the year to prevent malaria [1]. It has been estimated that about 25 million chil-
dren under five years of age resident in 15 countries live in areas suitable for SMC, defined as
areas where 60% of annual cases fall in four consecutive months of the year. About 20 million
of these children live in areas where estimates of the parasite rate (PfPr2-10) were consistent
with an incidence of malaria in excess of 0.1 cases per child per year, areas where SMC is likely
to be most cost effective [2,3]. Following regional meetings of malaria control programme
managers to develop SMC implementation plans and the publication of an implementation
guide detailing methods of delivery, monitoring, and evaluation of SMC [4,5], National Malaria
Control Programmes have been quick to adopt this policy. SMC schemes have started in eleven
countries (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Nigeria,
Senegal, and Togo). Seven of these countries are expanding access to SMC through a UNI-
TAID-funded programme (ACCESS-SMC, [6]).
In some parts of the areas suitable for SMC, the proportional burden of malaria in older
children is increasing [7], reflecting slower acquisition of natural immunity; in these areas,

 extending the age range for administration of SMC above five years may be justified [8]. The
size of the burden in older children is often not apparent to programme managers, because
standard reporting templates report the number of malaria cases in three groups (those under
five years of age, those over five years of age, and pregnant women) and do not disaggregate
age groups above five years of age.
This study was planned prior to the WHO policy recommendation for SMC to evaluate the
effectiveness of SMC using a stepped-wedge design. The study was designed to determine the
feasibility of delivering SMC on a large scale to children under five years of age, its safety, and
its costs. After the first year of implementation, it was apparent that there was a substantial
malaria burden in older children. The intervention was therefore expanded to include all chil-
dren up to ten years of age in the second and third years of the study in order to be able to eval-
uate the effectiveness of SMC in this wider age group. This paper reports the study design and
the results on effectiveness. The pharmacovigilance system, analysis of coverage, and the eco-
nomic evaluation are reported separately [9].
Methods
Ethics
A series of meetings were held with local government authorities and district health staff to
explain the aims and activities of the project. On the first occasion, when the intervention
drugs were delivered through house-to-house visits, verbal consent to participate in the SMC
programme was sought from the mother or carer of each eligible child using a standard script
translated into the appropriate local language (Wolof or Serer), which mentioned the aims of
the project and the potential side effects of the study drugs. Verbal consent or refusal was
recorded in a register by the community worker. Consent was sought separately for participa-
tion in surveys and demographic surveillance.The study protocol was approved by the ethics
committee of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and by the Conseil Nationale
de Recherche in Senegal. The same committees approved an amendment in 2009 to include
older children in SMC administration. A Data Safety Monitoring Board monitored the safety
aspects of the study.
Study Site
The study was undertaken in the health districts of Mbour, Bambey, and Fatick in central Sene-
gal, which have a combined population of about 600,000 and which are served by 54 health
posts and three district health centres. The trial profile is shown in Fig 1, and the study area
and phased design are shown in Fig 2 and S1 Fig. (Note that Fatick district was subdivided in
2010, part of the original health district forming the new health district of Niakhar; both areas
remained in the study). The climate of the study area is sudano-sahelian, with a single rainy
season from July to the beginning of October;monthly mean temperature range from 24°C
(December–January) to 30°C (May–June). The main vector species is Anopheles gambiae sensu
lato (predominantly Anopheles arabiensis). The mean indoor man-biting rate of An. gambiae s.
l. ranged from 0.3 to 6 bites per night in 2008, 0.2 to 10 in 2009, and 0.2 to 22 in 2010, with sim-
ilar results for outdoor biting (S1 Fig).
Formative Research
Before the study, formative research was done to identify the most suitable methods for deliver-
ing SMC, and a pilot implementation was undertaken to assess acceptability to communities

 and to health staff, to measure compliance, to identify any important constraints, and to pro-
vide data to support a funding application for the main study.
Stepped-Wedge Design
SMC (then known as intermittent preventive treatment in children [IPTc]) had been shown
prior to the planning of this study to be highly effective in clinical trials [10,11], but it was ques-
tioned whether the intervention could be delivered on a large scale at reasonable cost, whether
it would be acceptable to families, and whether the drugs used for SMC would be safe when
deployed on a large scale. It was also unknown if SMC had an impact on mortality. These con-
siderations guided the design and the sample size of the new study. A stepped-wedge design
[12] was chosen, as it was not considered justifiable to include an individual- or community-
randomised control group, and, because there was no established delivery channel, implemen-
tation needed to be phased in gradually for logistic reasons. It was considered that results from
an uncontrolled “before and after” design would be difficult to interpret due to the variability
in malaria incidence from year to year.
Randomisation
Health officials and community leaders agreed to randomisation by health post but asked that
intervention progressed at the same rate in all three districts. The health post was the natural
cluster, as each health post is responsible for community programmes in their catchment area
(median about 9,000 people) and supervisesa network of community health workers. The
three districts were served by 77 health posts, 54 of which were situated in rural and semi-
urban areas and were included in the study. SMC was introduced in steps that were one year
apart—9 health posts implemented in year 1, an additional 18 in year 2, and an additional 18
in year 3, leaving 9 that would start in year 4 if the study was extended (Fig 1, S1 Table, and S2
Fig). Constrained randomisation was used to avoid chance imbalance between intervention
and control areas at each step. Data on the key outcomes (confirmed malaria incidence, all-

 cause deaths) by cluster were not available prior to the start of the trial, so the randomisation
had to be based on proxy variables (distance from river, distance from health centre, popula-
tion size, number of villages). An assessment of the performance and experience of the staff at
each health post (on a 3-point scale) was also included to avoid imbalance in ability to imple-
ment SMC. A geographical constraint was included to avoid randomisations that resulted in
clumps of intervention and control clusters. The randomisation process was kept secret; health
staff knew their status for that year (implement or control) only at the start of the year. Further
details are provided in S3 Text.

 Delivery
Delivery was organised by health post using community health workers who visited each
household once per month during the transmission seasons of 2008, 2009, and 2010 (in mid-
September, mid-October, and mid-November) to administer SMC to children aged 3–59
months (in 2008) and to children up to 10 years of age in 2009 and 2010. The dose of SP and
the first dose of AQ was administered by the health worker or by the mother/carer under
supervision by the health worker; the remaining daily doses of AQ were left with the mother to
administer at home over the next two days. Dates of SMC administration were documented by
the health worker in registers and on a family-held record card. Usage and wastage of drugs
was tallied. Coverage was estimated independently from surveys each year, sampling from each
intervention cluster to yield an overall estimate of annual coverage.
Drugs
In 2008, co-blister packs of Dualkin (Pfizer) (SP [500/25 mg tablets] and AQ [200 mg tablets])
were used. These tablets had to be broken and crushed to make half doses for infants. In 2009,
200-mg AQ tablets (Chongqing Qinyang Pharmaceutical) and 500/25-mg SP (Shijizhuang
Ouyi Pharmaceutical) tablets were used, and, in 2010, sweetened dispersible tablets of SP (500/
25 mg) and of AQ (153 mg) (Kinapharma, Ghana) were given. Clinical episodes of malaria
were treated with AQ-artesunate or quinine in 2008 and with artemether-lumefantrine or qui-
nine in 2009 and 2010, following a clinical algorithm that required suspected cases to be tested
with an RDT (Paracheck-Pf test, Orchid Biomedical Systems, Goa, India). Amoxicillin and
cotrimoxazole were the most commonly used antibiotics.
Surveillance
Parasitological diagnosis for malaria was introduced nationally by the SenegaleseMinistry of
Health the same year our project started. Malaria cases were detected at health facilities by a
government nurse or physician at hospitals, district health centres, and health posts, by nurses
at mission clinics, or by a community health worker working in “health huts” and in the com-
munity. The percentage of malaria treatments that were based on confirmation by RDT or
slide was 69% in 2008, 97% in 2009, and 96% in 2010. The number of health huts in the study
area increased from 47 in 2008 to 76 in 2010. The breakdown by study zone is shown in S3
Text. Apart from this expansion, which occurred in all zones of the study area, there were no
major changes in the level of surveillance.Training workshops were held for health post nurses,
and close contact was maintained with them through supervisors who visited each health facil-
ity once every one to three months, to ensure guidelines were followed and to promote good
record-keeping. Confirmation of a clinical diagnosis of malaria was made using an RDT, fol-
lowing an algorithm that required measuring axillary temperature with a thermometer and
testing with an RDT (First Response) all persons with fever (temperature �37.5°C) who did
not have signs of respiratory infection or other obvious causes of the fever. Malaria cases were
linked to clusters based on village of residence (we did not attempt to link cases to household
members listed in the Demographic Surveillance System [DSS]). Surveillance was maintained
in all age groups to allow estimation of the indirect effect of the intervention in terms of a
reduction in incidence of malaria in older age groups.
A pharmacovigilance system was established based on the national system but strengthened
through training, supervision,and use of SMS messaging. A simplified DSS was set up, with
household visits undertaken approximately every ten months. Deaths were recorded through
DSS rounds (referred to as DSS1, conducted from October 2008 to June 2009, DSS2 conducted
from October 2009 to July 2010, and DSS3 from October 2010 to December 2010). In 13 health

 posts, village reporters were trained to record any deaths in their communities, and verbal
autopsies were undertaken in these cases. Cluster sample surveys of children were conducted at
the end of each transmission season to measure SMC coverage and to take a finger-prick blood
sample for parasitology and measurement of haemoglobin (Hb) concentration. Households
were randomly selected from the DSS, and all children who would have been eligible for SMC
resident in those households were included in the survey. Surveillance for malaria and for mor-
tality was continued in 2011 to look for rebound effects.
A series of in-depth interviewswere held with mothers and carers, community leaders, com-
munity health workers, health post nurses, and district medical staff using structured interview
guides to find out their views on SMC, their knowledge of its benefits and risks, and the accept-
ability of the intervention. Interviews were recorded and transcribed into French, and tran-
scripts were analysed.
Laboratory Methods
A finger-prick blood sample was taken during the cross-sectional surveys to make thick films,
to take blood spots on filter paper for molecular analysis, and for measurement of Hb concen-
tration using a portable Haemocue machine (Haemocue AB, Ängelholm, Sweden). Slides were
dried at room temperature for 48 hours and stained with 6% Giemsa solution. Slide reading
was done at the malaria laboratory of the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD).
All positive slides and a sample of negative slide were re-read by a second reader; if readings
disagreed (about slide positivity or if there was a more than 2-fold difference in parasite den-
sity), a third reading was done, and the geometric mean density of the closest readings were
used if the slide was judged positive. A subset of slides were read at the Parasitology Depart-
ment of the Université Cheikh Anta Diop (UCAD) of Dakar for quality control purposes. Fur-
ther details are given in S3 Text. Two hundred high-power fields were read to determine
parasitaemia and presence of other species (Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale, and Bor-
relia) before a slide was declared negative. Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia density was cal-
culated as the number of parasites per 100 leukocytes,expressed per μl assuming 8,000 white
blood cells per microliter of blood. Gametocyte densities were estimated based on the number
of gametocytes seen in 200 microscopic fields and the average number of white blood cells seen
per field. Samples found positive for P. falciparum by microscopy were analysed by reverse
transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and sequencing for the presence of mutations in the pfdhfr,
pfdhps, pfmdr1, and pfcrt genes associated with resistance to SMC drugs. Children with an
Hb < 7 g/dL were referred to the health post, where the child was given a course of iron tablets;
severely anaemic children were referred to the district health centre for blood transfusion if
required. Children with a fever were referred to the health post, their slide was read promptly,
and the results were provided to the clinic. Samples of the tablets used were tested at the Labor-
atoire National de Contrôle des Médicaments, Dakar for drug content and dissolution.
Statistical Methods
The primary trial outcomes were all-cause mortality, the incidence of RDT-confirmed malaria
treated as outpatients, and the incidence of known drug-related adverse events. Secondaryout-
comes were coverage of SMC, the prevalence of parasitaemia and anaemia at the end of each
transmission season, the prevalence of molecular markers associated with resistance to SP and
to AQ, and the incidence of severe malaria defined as admission to hospital for at least 24
hours with a primary diagnosis of malaria. Sample size calculations to detect an effect on all-
causes mortality were done for a range of scenarios, with the assumption that the mortality rate
(all causes) would be 20 per 1,000 in children 3–59 months of age (based on estimates from the

 Niakhar DSS) and assuming 30% of deaths were due to malaria (determined from verbal
autopsies in Niakhar and the proportion of deaths in hospital attributed to malaria). We also
assumed a coefficientof variation between health posts of 0.25 to 0.3 and SMC effectiveness
against malaria to be 70%. Calculations using the method of Hemming and Girling [13] for the
stepped-wedge design, assuming k = 0.3 and a median population of children aged 3–59
months of 1,400 per cluster, gave a power of about 17%, 52%, and 99% for reductions of 5%,
10%, and 20%, respectively, if the mortality rate was 10/1,000 and 11%, 32%, and 86% power
for the same reductions if the rate was 20/1,000.
Effectiveness of SMC was estimated by fitting a Poisson regression model to the data on the
number of deaths and the number of RDT-confirmed malaria cases in each health post occur-
ring in the period starting from the date of the first round of SMC and ending one month after
the last round of SMC each year. The number of person-months at risk obtained from the DSS
was included as an offset, and a gamma-distributed random effect was used to allow for corre-
lation within clusters. Covariates included in the model were age group, calendar year, and
indicator variables for the effect of SMC in children (under five years in 2008 and under ten
years in 2009 and 2010) and for the indirect effect of SMC in older age groups. Interaction
terms were included to compare effects in the two age groups, and combined effects were esti-
mated where there was no evidence of interaction. The indicator variable representing SMC
direct effects was set to 1 if that age group received SMC in that cluster in that year and set to 0
otherwise.The indicator variable for indirect effects was set to 1 for all non-SMC age groups if
SMC was implemented in children in that cluster and set to zero otherwise.Thus the direct
effect that was estimated represents the sum of direct and indirect effects, and the indirect effect
estimated represents the indirect effect only. Rebound effects were assessed by comparing the
incidence of malaria during 2011 and 2012, after intervention had stopped, in children living
in areas where SMC had been provided for up to three years, with children of the same age in
areas that did not have SMC.
This study is registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT 00712374.
Results
A census undertaken in May 2008 identified approximately 600,000 persons who were nor-
mally resident in the study area, living in 1,247 villages. Coverage with long-lasting insecticide
treated nets (LLIN) in children was similar in all zones, ranging from 45% to 59% in the first
year of the study and increasing to 67% to 77% by the third year (Table 1). SMC implementa-
tion started in September 2008 in Zone 1, treating about 14,000 children aged 3–59 months
each month (mid-September, mid-October, and mid-November). About 90,000 children
under ten years of age were treated in 2009, and about 160,000 were treated in 2010.
Coverage and Adherence
The proportion of children who received three monthly SMC treatments in 2008 was 93%
(95% CI 91%–95%), estimated from a survey of 1,019 children in 9 health post areas; the corre-
sponding figure in 2009 was 84% (95% CI 82%–87%) (n = 3,397) and 93% in 2010 (95% CI
91%–96%) (n = 882). A high level of adherence to daily doses was reported. The main reason
for missed doses was that the caregiver was away when the health worker visited. Fewer than
1% refused, and less than 1% of children missed SMC because of illness on the day of treat-
ment; those who did miss SMC due to illness on the day of treatment were referred to the
health facility. When asked about adherence to the two doses of AQ left for the caregiver to
administer, 9.6% reported difficultiesgiving these doses.

 Mortality
During the transmission seasons, the mortality rate among children aged 3–59 months in SMC
areas was 4.6 per 1,000 child-years at risk (197 deaths) and 4.5/1,000 in control areas (159
deaths). Among children aged 5–9 years, the mortality rates were 1.30/1,000 in SMC areas (45
deaths) and 1.2/1,000 in control areas (43 deaths). Mortality in infants under three months of
age was 19/1,000. The mortality rate ratio SMC: control given by a random effect model that
included cluster, time, and age effects was 0.89 (95% CI 0.65–1.2, p = 0.442) for the 3–59 months
age group and 0.97 (95% CI 0.61–1.6, p = 0.916) for the 5- to 9-year-olds. The pooled estimate
for both age groups combined was 0.90 (95% CI 0.68–1.2 p = 0.496) (S3 Fig, S2 Table).

 Outpatient Cases of Malaria
A total of 1,001 RDT-confirmed cases of malaria were recorded in children <10 years in
2008, 310 in 2009, and 1,111 in 2010. The number treated for malaria without an RDT being
performed was 1,231 in 2008 but fell to 73 in 2009 and 17 in 2010, following expansion of a
new national policy of “test and treat” in 2009. In Zone 6, which did not receive SMC, the
incidence of RDT-confirmed malaria during the transmission season was 2.0/1,000 in chil-
dren under five years of age in 2008, 0.2/1,000 in 2009, and 4.3/1,000 in 2010 (S4 and S5
Figs). The reasons for the very low incidence in 2009 are not known. Rates of confirmed cases
in under 50s in SMC areas were 2.8,0.36 and 2.0 per1000 in the 2008, 2009 and 2010 transmis-
sion seasons respectively and 2.2, 0.51 and 4.3 in control areas in the same years. In the 5-9
age group the rates were 0.83 and 4.1 per 1000 in SMC areas in 2009 and 2010 respectively
and 1.5 and 10.0 in control areas in the same years (S3 Table). The incidence rate ratio com-
paring SMC and control areas, adjusted for effects of calendar time, for RDT-confirmed
malaria during the transmission season was 0.43 In children under five years of age and 0.39
for children five to nine years of age (Table 2), giving reductions of 57% (95% CI 48%–63%)
in the younger group and 61% (95% CI 55%–67%) in the older group, an overall effectiveness
of 60% (95% CI 54%–64%, p < 0.001). The reduction in all cases treated for malaria (con-
firmed and unconfirmed) was 69% (95% CI 65%–72%, p < 0.001). Among age groups too old
to receive SMC, incidence was reduced by 26% (95% CI 18%–33%, p < 0.001) (RDT-con-
firmed), or 29% (95% CI 21%–35%, p < 0.001) (confirmed and unconfirmed cases) in areas
where SMC was delivered to children compared to control areas (Fig 3). When cases of

 malaria throughout the year were included in the analysis, the reduction in confirmed cases
in children under ten years of age was 48% (95% CI 42%–54%, p < 0.001) and in total malaria
treatments was 60% (95% CI 56%–63%). The indirect effect in older age groups was an over-
all reduction of 20% (95% CI 12%–27%) in confirmed cases and 20% (95% CI 13%–25%) in
total treatments (S3 Table).
Severe Malaria
One hundred and twenty-three children were admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of severe
malaria, with 50 under 5 years of age (25 in SMC areas and 25 in control areas, rates per 100
child-years of 0.48 and 0.53, respectively) and 73 children 5–9 years of age (22 before SMC started
in this age group, 34 in SMC areas, and 17 in control areas, rates of 0.95 and 1.2, respectively), giv-
ing a combined rate ratio of 0.55 and an overall reduction of 45% (95% CI 5%–68%, p = 0.031),
with no evidence of difference between the age groups (interaction p-value 0.224) (S4 Table).
Prevalence of Parasitaemia and Anaemia at the End of the
Transmission Season
SMC was associated with a reduction in the prevalence of P. falciparum parasitaemia in both
age groups. In 2008, in children under five years of age, the prevalence was 5.1% in control

 areas and 1.6% in SMC areas, a reduction of 68% (95% CI 35%–85%) p = 0.002. In children
under ten years of age, in 2009, the prevalence was 1.3% and 0.22% in control and SMC areas
(reduction of 84% (95% CI 58%–94%, p < 0.01), and in 2010, 2.5% and 1.86, respectively, a
reduction of 30% (95% CI -130%–79%, p = 0.56) (Table 3). Gametocyte carriage was reduced
in SMC areas in 2008 (2.6% compared to 0.64%, prevalence ratio 0.28 [95% CI 0.10–0.75]). In
2009 and 2010, the number of gametocyte carriers was too low to measure any difference
between SMC and control areas (S2 Table). Mean Hb concentration, which was measured in
2008 and 2009, was similar in SMC and non-SMC areas in each year (S5 Table). The preva-
lence of moderate anaemia in children under five years of age was 27% in SMC areas and 29%
in non-SMC areas in 2008, a prevalence ratio of 0.92 (95% CI 0.79–1.07), and 27.9% and 27.6%
in 2009, a prevalence ratio of 1.0 (95% CI 0.86–1.15). The prevalence of severe anaemia
(Hb < 6 g/dL) was 1.07% and 0.32%, prevalence ratio 0.30 (95% CI 0.07–1.19) in 2008 and
1.0% and 2.2%, prevalence ratio 2.1 (95% CI 0.93–4.9) in 2009. In children 5–9 years of age in
2009, the prevalence of moderate anaemia was 8.9% and 9.2%, prevalence ratio 1.0 (95% CI
0.86–1.15), and the prevalence of severe anaemia was 1.21% and 1.20%, prevalence ratio 1.01
(95% CI 0.44–2.33) (S6 and S7 Tables).
Markers of Resistance to SMC Drugs
One hundred and sixty-one samples positive for P. falciparum parasitaemia were typed, 48
from SMC areas and 113 from non-SMC areas. The proportion with parasites with pfdhfr
and pfdhps mutations was similar in SMC and non-SMC areas (prevalence ratios SMC: non-
SMC, adjusted for study year, were 0.90 [95% CI 0.79–1.02] for the pfdhfr triple mutation
and 0.98 [95% CI 0.80–1.21] for the pfdhps mutation at codon 437), whereas the CVIET hap-
lotypes of pfcrt and the 86Y polymorphism of pfmdr1 were more common in SMC areas
(prevalence ratios 1.46 [95% CI 0.70–3.05] for pfcrt CVIET, 1.86 [95% CI 1.04–3.34] for
pfmdr1 86Y, and 1.09 [95% CI 0.82–1.47] for pfmr1 184F). When the overall prevalence of
pfdhfr, pfdhps, pfcrt, and pfmdr1 mutations was compared (including both infected and
uninfected children in the denominator), the prevalences were lower in SMC areas than in
control areas [14].
Adverse Events
No cases of Stevens–Johnson syndrome were seen in children who received SMC. One child
had an extra-pyramidal syndrome associated with AQ taken during SMC but recovered. Three
serious adverse events were considered possibly related to SMC: an acute diarrhoeal illness, a

 case of rash and facial oedema, and a case of jaundice. The average percentage of children who
attended clinic within ten days of an SMC round with symptoms attributed to SMC drugs was
0.1% in 2008, 0.2% in 2009, and 0.14% in 2010. The most commonly reported symptom was
vomiting. Details of adverse events are describedin [9].
Costs
The average financial cost of delivery was US$0.50 per child per month, and economic cost was
US$0.59. Estimates for each health post varied widely depending on the size of the health post.
Incidence of Malaria in SMC and Control Areas in the Year after
Intervention
Children could have received SMC for up to three years, depending on their age and imple-
mentation zone. The number of previous years of SMC can be defined for each age group in
each zone (S8 Table); for example, those living in areas where SMC implementation started in
2008, if they were aged 3–59 months when SMC started in 2008, could have received SMC for
up to three years; these children would be aged from three years and three months to seven
years at the start of the 2011 transmission season. When the incidence of malaria in 2011 was
compared in relation to the number of years of SMC, the rate ratio for three years of previous
SMC, compared with no previous SMC, was 1.18 (95% CI 0.84–1.67); for two years of SMC,
1.09 (95% CI 0.82–1.45); and for one year of SMC, 0.77 (95% CI 0.59–1.01), after adjusting for
effects of age.
Discussion
This trial showed that SMC delivered to children under ten years of age by district health teams
on a large scale was highly effective in reducing the malaria burden in young and older children
by at least 60%, that the intervention was well tolerated and well accepted by communities, and
that high coverage could be achieved at moderate cost. There was a substantial reduction in the
incidence of malaria and in the prevalence of parasitaemia, and, importantly, our results were
consistent with an indirect benefit in age groups too old to receive SMC themselves.
We found a reduction in the incidence of severe malaria, but we did not observe a reduction
in all-cause mortality. No reduction in the prevalence of anaemia was observed.In previous
studies [14], the effect of SMC on anaemia has differed between studies; this may reflect differ-
ences in the extent to which malaria is an important cause of anaemia in different populations.
In areas of intense transmission, the main burden of severe malaria disease is in young chil-
dren, but, as the intensity of transmission decreases, an increasing proportion of cases occur at
older ages, reflecting slower acquisition of natural immunity; in these areas, wider age group
could be included in SMC programmes.
Despite high coverage and the contribution of a herd effect, SMC effectiveness was some-
what lower than the efficacyobservedin clinical trials (efficacyof 75% against uncomplicated
and severe malaria, [15]). This may be partly due to the use of RDTs to diagnose malaria.
These can give a false positive result, as the HRP (histidine-rich protein) persists after infec-
tions have been treated, reducing specificity and biasing effectiveness estimates downwards.
Care was taken to assign malaria cases to clusters on the basis of their place of residence, but
there could have been some misclassification, which would also reduce estimates of effective-
ness. We may have somewhat overestimated coverage by sampling, at the end of the transmis-
sion season, the population resident at that time, excluding families that were present for only
parts of the transmission season whose children may have missed SMC doses. Our results
could have been influenced by effects of other interventions: these included distribution of

 LLINs and a campaign of mass treatment with azithromycin in Bambey district. However, ran-
domisation, which was balanced by district, should have minimised the impact of this source
of bias. During one year of the trial, malaria incidence was unexpectedlyvery low. The reasons
for this are not known, as malaria surveillancemethods were unchanged and no reduction in
mosquito density was seen in that year in the four areas where entomological monitoring was
done.
An effect on transmission brought about by the clearance of infection in a substantial pro-
portion of the population (children under ten years of age represent about 30% of the popula-
tion and account for about 40% of all outpatient malaria cases) is not unexpected.The use of
microscopy to detect gametocytes may have underestimated the prevalence of gametocyte car-
riage, but there was a substantial reduction in the prevalence of asexual parasitaemia, and it is
likely this was accompanied by a reduction in gametocyte prevalence. We were not able to mea-
sure an effect of SMC on entomological inoculation rates; this would be challenging due to the
very low sporozoite rates. The randomisation zones were well balanced at baseline, and the
stepped-wedge design permits adjustment for pre-intervention incidence, so a chance imbal-
ance is unlikely to account for the observedfindings.
We found no evidence that children who had received SMC for up to three years were at
increased risk of malaria the year after SMC stopped. This is consistent with the relatively low
incidence of malaria and the consequently slow pace of naturally acquired immunity in
untreated children in the study area.
SMC programmes will increase selection pressure for drug resistance, but the rate at which
this will occur is not known. In our study, children who had P. falciparum infection at the end
of the transmission season were more likely to carry the pfmdr1 86Y mutation associated with
AQ resistance if they came from areas where SMC had been implemented [14], but the effect
of this on the spread of resistance may be mitigated to some extent by the much lower preva-
lence of infection in SMC areas; the overall proportion of children carrying parasites with these
mutations was consequently lower in SMC areas than in areas where SMC had not been
implemented.
We did not observe an effect on all-cause mortality. There had been a gradual reduction in
mortality rates in the years before the study related to improved vaccination coverage and
access to primary health care [16], but the sudden drop in mortality in our study was unex-
pected. It may partly reflect a reduction in malaria transmission associated with scaling up of
universal coverage of LLINs and may also be related to increased use of antibiotics. When
RDTs for malaria were introduced in Senegal in 2007 and 2008, there was increased use of anti-
biotics, as guidelines for health facility workers stipulated that persons who tested negative for
malaria should be given a broad-spectrumantibiotic. Although we were not able to demon-
strate an effect on all-cause mortality, a reduction in the incidence of severe malaria was
observed;there may, therefore, have been a reduction in malaria-specificmortality, but the
overall number of deaths and the proportion due to malaria was too low for this effect to be
measured.
Including older children increases the cost of SMC programmes, but in our study, which
employed door-to-door delivery, did not greatly increase the overall time required for delivery,
as older children could readily be treated during health worker visits.
A Technical Expert Group of WHO reviewed evidence about SMC in 2011 [2], including
preliminary results from this study. SMC was recommended for high-incidenceareas [1]; our
study area fell outside these recommendations on the basis of a low incidence of malaria, and
so our implementation was not expanded, but monitoring was continued to assess rebound
effects. SMC is now being implemented in the south of Senegal, where the burden is higher, for
children up to ten years of age. In 2015, SMC programmes took place in nine countries, in

 about 7 million children. Apart from in Senegal, SMC is currently being provided only for chil-
dren up to five years of age, but, in many areas, the burden in older children may justify extend-
ing this range. Our study shows that, in some areas, expanding the age range for SMC could
have a substantial impact on the malaria burden and could contribute to reducing malaria
transmission.
