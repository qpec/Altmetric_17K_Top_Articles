BACKGROUND
The role of image-guided surveillance as compared with planned neck dissection in the 
treatment of patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck who have 
advanced nodal disease (stage N2 or N3) and who have received chemoradiotherapy for 
primary treatment is a matter of debate.
METHODS
In this prospective, randomized, controlled trial, we assessed the noninferiority of posi-
tron-emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT)–guided surveillance (per-
formed 12 weeks after the end of chemoradiotherapy, with neck dissection performed 
only if PET-CT showed an incomplete or equivocal response) to planned neck dissection 
in patients with stage N2 or N3 disease. The primary end point was overall survival.
RESULTS
From 2007 through 2012, we recruited 564 patients (282 patients in the planned-surgery 
group and 282 patients in the surveillance group) from 37 centers in the United Kingdom. 
Among these patients, 17% had nodal stage N2a disease and 61% had stage N2b disease. 
A total of 84% of the patients had oropharyngeal cancer, and 75% had tumor specimens that 
stained positive for the p16 protein, an indicator that human papillomavirus had a role in the 
causation of the cancer. The median follow-up was 36 months. PET-CT–guided surveillance 
resulted in fewer neck dissections than did planned dissection surgery (54 vs. 221); rates of 
surgical complications were similar in the two groups (42% and 38%, respectively). The 2-year 
overall survival rate was 84.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 80.7 to 89.1) in the surveillance 
group and 81.5% (95% CI, 76.9 to 86.3) in the planned-surgery group. The hazard ratio for 
death slightly favored PET-CT–guided surveillance and indicated noninferiority (upper bound-
ary of the 95% CI for the hazard ratio, <1.50; P 
= 
0.004). There was no significant difference 
between the groups with respect to p16 expression. Quality of life was similar in the two 
groups. PET-CT–guided surveillance, as compared with neck dissection, resulted in savings 
of £1,492 (approximately $2,190 in U.S. dollars) per person over the duration of the trial.
CONCLUSIONS
Survival was similar among patients who underwent PET-CT–guided surveillance and 
those who underwent planned neck dissection, but surveillance resulted in considerably 
fewer operations and it was more cost-effective. (Funded by the National Institute for

PET-CT vs. Neck Dissection in Head and Neck Cancer
C
hemoradiotherapy has become a 
mainstay of primary treatment in patients 
with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head 
and neck. However, there are wide variations in 
the management of advanced nodal disease 
(stage N2 or N3) in these patients because of 
the lack of prospective, randomized, controlled 
trials.1,2
Retrospective studies showed persistent dis-
ease on histopathological examination of nodes 
in up to 40% of patients who underwent neck 
dissection after chemoradiotherapy3 and some 
evidence of a significant survival advantage as-
sociated with planned neck dissection.4,5 How-
ever, owing to improvements in cross-sectional 
imaging, consistently low rates of recurrence 
(<10%) have been reported among the 30 to 45% 
of patients who have been found to have a com-
plete response on imaging after chemoradio-
therapy.6,7 Thus, the adoption of image-guided, 
response-based approaches has increased, albeit 
without level I evidence.
Unequivocal data are lacking, and a signifi-
cant percentage of clinicians (35 to 48%) in 
some countries still perform planned neck dis-
section, either before or after chemoradiother-
apy, in these patients.1,2 This procedure is as-
sociated with an attendant risk of clinically 
significant complications.8
Combined morphologic and functional imag-
ing with the use of combined 18F-fluorodeoxy-
glucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography and 
computed tomography (PET-CT) can identify both 
structural and metabolic abnormalities in tumors. 
Meta-analyses of mainly small, single-center 
PET-CT studies involving patients with squamous-
cell carcinoma of the head and neck who have 
received chemoradiotherapy have shown high 
negative predictive values of 94.5 to 96.0%.9,10 
Stratification of these patients for neck dissec-
tion with the use of PET-CT after chemoradio-
therapy may therefore result in fewer neck dissec-
tions and a reduced incidence of complications.11 
However, data from prospective, randomized, 
multicenter trials to support routine adoption of 
this approach are lacking. We therefore per-
formed a prospective, randomized, controlled 
trial to compare the clinical usefulness and 
health economic outcomes of planned neck dis-
section versus PET-CT–guided surveillance in 
patients with nodal stage N2 or N3, metastasis 
stage M0 disease.
Methods
Trial Conduct
The first and last author and the trial manage-
ment group designed the study. The Warwick 
Clinical Trials Unit gathered the data. Tissue 
collection and staining for the p16 protein were 
performed at the University of Birmingham. The 
authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness 
of the data and analysis and for adherence to the 
study protocol, which is provided with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org. No one who is 
not an author contributed to the writing of the 
manuscript. There was no commercial support 
for the study.
Patients
Eligible patients were at least 18 years of age 
and had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of 
squamous-cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, 
hypopharynx, larynx, oral cavity, or an unknown 
primary site in the head or neck, with clinical 
and radiologic (CT or magnetic resonance imag-
ing [MRI]) stage N2 or N3 nodal metastases.12 
Patients had to be suitable candidates for chemo-
radiotherapy with curative intent and could not 
have contraindications to neck dissection. The 
study was approved by the Oxfordshire Multi-
centre Research Ethics Committee. All patients 
provided written informed consent.
Trial Design
In this unblinded, multicenter, randomized, con-
trolled, noninferiority trial, eligible patients were 
randomly assigned to undergo either a planned 
neck dissection (planned-surgery control group) 
or PET-CT 12 weeks after completion of chemo-
radiotherapy (surveillance group). Before random-
ization, each participating center had to specify 
on a per-patient basis whether planned neck 
dissection would be performed within 4 weeks 
before or within 4 to 8 weeks after completion 
of chemoradiotherapy. In addition, before ran-
domization, clinicians selected chemoradiother-
apy regimens from a list of the approved study 
regimens (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix, available at NEJM.org).
Patients underwent central randomization in a 
1:1 ratio. Trial-group assignments were balanced 
with the use of a minimization algorithm ac-
cording to center, timing of neck dissection 
(before or after chemoradiotherapy), chemother-

apy schedule, disease site, tumor stage (T1 or T2 
vs. T3 or T4), and nodal stage (N2a or N2b vs. 
N2c or N3).
Assessments and Outcomes
Imaging assessments of the patients’ response 
to therapy were performed 12 weeks after the 
last radiotherapy fraction was delivered. Patients 
assigned to the planned-surgery group were 
evaluated by means of CT or MRI; those as-
signed to the surveillance group were evaluated 
by means of PET-CT.
All PET-CT findings were interpreted locally 
by PET-CT specialty radiologists and nuclear-
medicine physicians. PET-CT scans were assessed 
qualitatively. Results of PET-CT that showed in-
tense FDG uptake at 12 weeks after chemoradio-
therapy, with or without enlarged lymph nodes 
in the neck, were classified as incomplete nodal 
responses. Mild or no FDG uptake in enlarged 
nodes or mild FDG uptake in normal-sized nodes 
was considered to be an equivocal response. All 
other PET-CT scans were considered to show 
complete responses.
Patients who had an incomplete or equivocal 
response in lymph nodes in the neck and who 
had a complete response in the primary site 
underwent neck dissection within 4 weeks after 
PET-CT. Both modified radical and selective neck 
dissections13 were permitted in both groups, with 
the decision made by the treating surgeon.
Follow-up consisted of clinical examination 
and imaging for at least 24 months after random-
ization. Suspected recurrences were assessed by 
means of biopsy and pathological inspection. 
Complications of surgery were recorded for a 
period of 30 days after the operation. Serious 
adverse events were reported up to 3 months 
after the last treatment (either chemoradiother-
apy or surgery).
Patients completed the European Organisa-
tion for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
Quality-of-Life Questionnaire–Core 30 general 
(EORTC QLQ-C30, version 3) and head and 
neck–specific (EORTC QLQ-H&N35) question-
naires,14 the M.D. Anderson Dysphagia Inven-
tory,15 and the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension 
Self-Report Questionnaire (EQ-5D) at baseline 
before randomization, 2 weeks after completion 
of chemoradiotherapy, and then at 6, 12, and 24 
months after randomization. Health economics 
questionnaires and resource utilization data 
were collected in a subgroup of patients and 
centers at the same time points. EQ-5D ques-
tionnaires were used to derive patient quality-
adjusted life-years (QALYs), which were com-
bined with cost data to assess cost-effectiveness.
Laboratory Studies and Quality Assurance
All treating hospitals were required to be ap-
proved as head and neck treatment centers by 
the U.K. Department of Health. Formalin-fixed, 
paraffin-embedded tumor samples were tested 
centrally for p16 expression by means of immu-
nohistochemical analysis with the use of propri-
etary reagents (CINtec Histology kit, Roche). 
Testing to detect p16 expression was recorded as 
positive if more than 70% of the malignant cells 
showed strong diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic 
staining.16 All PET-CT scans, 10% of other radio-
logic investigations, and 10% of histologic spec-
imens were reviewed centrally by experienced 
specialists (details are provided in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
Statistical Analysis
The power calculations were based on an as-
sumption of a 2-year overall survival rate of 75%. 
We calculated that with a sample size of 560 
patients, the study would have 90% power to 
show the noninferiority of PET-CT surveillance 
to planned neck dissection, at a 5% one-sided 
significance level. Noninferiority was defined as 
an overall survival rate that was no more than 
10 percentage points below the estimated 75% 
2-year overall survival rate among patients in the 
planned-surgery group (i.e., hazard ratio for 
death, <1.50); this calculation allowed for a 3% 
loss to follow-up.
The analysis was performed on an intention-
to-treat basis. Statistical analyses were performed 
with the use of SAS software, version 9.3. A 
prespecified early stopping guideline was ap-
plied, with two interim analyses of overall sur-
vival (details are provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
The clinical primary end point of overall sur-
vival was measured from randomization to the 
date of death from any cause. Data on survival 
among patients who were lost to follow-up or 
who had incomplete follow-up were censored at 
the date when they were last known to be alive.

PET-CT vs. Neck Dissection in Head and Neck Cancer
Kaplan–Meier survival curves were plotted, and a 
forest plot was generated17 to examine the effect 
across risk factors. To test noninferiority, the 
hazard ratio was estimated with the use of a Cox 
proportional-hazards model stratified according 
to intended timing of planned neck dissection 
(before or after chemoradiotherapy), with the 
trial group as the only covariate. Noninferiority 
was considered to have been demonstrated if the 
95th percentile of the estimated hazard ratio was 
less than the inferiority limit (hazard ratio, 1.50).
Time to recurrence was measured from the 
date of completion of chemoradiotherapy. Deaths 
were classified as being due to head and neck 
cancer or to other causes. The standard scoring 
methods for the quality-of-life questionnaires 
were applied. All scores were transformed to 
scales in which higher scores indicated better 
health. On the EORTC questionnaires and the 
M.D. Anderson Dysphagia Inventory,15 a differ-
ence of 10 points in the score was considered to 
be clinically relevant.14,15,18
Results
Patient Characteristics and Treatment
A total of 564 patients (282 in each trial group) 
were recruited from October 2007 through August 
2012 from 37 head and neck treatment centers 
(43 hospitals) in the United Kingdom. Two pa-
tients in the surveillance group were subse-
quently found to be ineligible immediately after 
randomization; they were included in the inten-
tion-to-treat analysis.
There were no notable imbalances in baseline 
characteristics between the two trial groups 
(Table 1, and Table S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). The mean age was 58 years. The major-
ity of patients were male (82%) and had oropha-
ryngeal cancer (84%). A total of 79% of the 
patients had N2a or N2b nodal disease, and 74% 
were either current or past smokers.
Tissue samples obtained from 446 patients 
(79%) were tested for p16 expression; all char-
acteristics (i.e., age, tumor site, tumor stage, 
smoking history, performance status, and neck 
surgery before or after chemoradiotherapy) were 
well matched between the tested and nontested 
cohorts. Of the patients tested, 335 (75%) had 
tumor specimens that stained positive for the 
p16 protein, an indicator that human papilloma-
virus had a role in the causation of the cancer, 
with a nonsignificant preponderance in the 
planned-surgery group as compared with the 
surveillance group (78% vs. 73%).
Nonsurgical treatments (chemoradiotherapy 
and radiotherapy) were very well balanced be-
tween the groups (Tables S2 and S3 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). A total of 536 patients (95%) 
received concomitant platinum chemotherapy.
Planned-Surgery Group
There was little crossover from the planned-
surgery group to the surveillance group; only 
 
8 patients in the planned-surgery group (3%) 
underwent PET-CT after chemoradiotherapy. Of 
the 282 patients in the planned-surgery group, 
61 (22%) did not undergo neck dissection: 8 of 
the 77 (10%) who had been scheduled to undergo 
neck dissection before chemoradiotherapy and 
53 of the 205 (26%) who had been scheduled to 
undergo neck dissection after chemoradiother-
apy. Of the patients who did not undergo 
planned neck dissection after chemoradiother-

apy, half declined surgery and the other half did 
not undergo surgery owing to clinical reasons 
such as progression of disease, inoperability of 
recurrent disease, or insufficient medical fitness 
for surgery (Fig. 1, and Table S4 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
Of the patients who underwent neck dissec-
tion before chemoradiotherapy, 57% underwent 
modified radical dissection, and the rest under-
went selective node dissection. In contrast, of the 
patients who underwent planned neck dissection 
after chemoradiotherapy, only 38% underwent 
modified radical neck dissection (Table S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Surveillance Group
Of the 282 patients who were randomly assigned 
to the surveillance group, 270 (96%) underwent 
PET-CT scanning according to the protocol at 
12 weeks (median, 11.1 weeks; interquartile range, 
10.4 to 12.4). There was a 92% concordance be-
tween local and central PET-CT reviewers with 
respect to assessment of the primary site and a 
97% concordance with respect to assessment of 
nodal disease.
Local PET-CT reports indicated complete im-
aging responses in both the primary site and the 
neck nodes in 185 of the 270 patients who under-
went PET-CT (69%). Four of these 185 patients 
(2%) underwent neck dissection rather than sur-
veillance. Complete responses in the primary site 
with incomplete or equivocal responses in the 
neck nodes were seen in 47 of 270 patients 
(17%). Of these 47 patients, 36 (77%) underwent 
neck dissection. The reasons that patients did 
not undergo a neck dissection are listed in Table 
S6 in the Supplementary Appendix.
A total of 15 patients (6%) had an incomplete 
response in the primary site but a complete re-
sponse in the neck nodes; these patients did not 
undergo neck dissection. An additional 19 pa-
tients (7%) had incomplete responses in both 
the primary site and the neck nodes; 12 of these 
19 patients (63%) underwent neck dissection. In 
4 patients (1%), PET-CT after chemoradiotherapy 
showed new lesions that indicated disease pro-
gression with distant metastases or new primary 
sites in the lung. Two patients underwent neck 
dissection without undergoing PET-CT. Of the 
9 patients with N3 disease, 2 did not undergo 
PET-CT because of early disease progression or 
death, 5 had a complete response, and 2 had 
persistent nodal disease and underwent neck 
dissection. Overall, 54 neck dissections were per-
formed in the surveillance group, as compared 
with 221 in the planned-surgery group.
Outcomes and Efficacy
Patients were followed for up to 5 years, with a 
median follow-up of 36 months; 520 patients 
(92%) were followed for at least 2 years. Overall, 
122 patients died (60 in the surveillance group 
and 62 in the planned-surgery group). The 2-year 
overall survival rate was 84.9% (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 80.7 to 89.1) in the surveillance 
group and 81.5% (95% CI, 76.9 to 86.3) in the 
planned-surgery group. The hazard ratio for 
death with surveillance as compared with planned 
surgery was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.65 to 1.32); this 
outcome slightly favored the surveillance group 
and met the prespecified definition of noninfe-
riority (upper boundary of the 95% CI for the 
hazard ratio, <1.50; P 
= 
0.004). The hazard ratio 
of 0.92 excluded an unfavorable difference of 
more than 4 percentage points (at a one-sided 
alpha level of 0.05) between the two groups. The 
two-sided P value for the difference between 
treatment strategies was 0.66.
The results were similar after adjustment for 
treatment center, tumor stage, nodal stage, pri-
mary tumor site, chemotherapy and radiotherapy 
schedules, sex, and age at randomization. In 
addition, the results were similar after further 
adjustment for HPV status on the basis of avail-
able samples (Table S7 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Disease-specific mortality and mortality from 
other causes did not differ significantly between 
the two groups (P 
= 
0.80 and 0.41, respectively, 
according to Gray’s test for differences).19 Status 
with respect to p16 expression was highly prog-
nostic of overall survival in both groups (Fig. 2), 
a finding that was consistent with results of 
previous studies. There was no significant dif-
ference in overall survival between the planned-

In the surveillance group, a total of 54 patients under-
went neck dissection after chemoradiotherapy, includ-

surgery and surveillance groups among patients 
with p16-positive tumors (hazard ratio, 0.74; 
95% CI, 0.40 to 1.37) and those with p16-nega-
tive tumors (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.58 to 
1.66) (Fig. 3).
Patterns of Relapse
The 2-year rate of locoregional control was 91.9% 
(95% CI, 88.5 to 95.3) in the surveillance group 
and 91.4% (95% CI, 87.8 to 95.0%) in the 
planned-surgery group. In the latter group, the 
2-year rate of locoregional control was 90.4% 
(95% CI, 86.0 to 94.7) among patients who under-
went neck dissection after chemoradiotherapy 
and 94.8% (95% CI, 89.0 to 100) among patients 
who underwent neck dissection before chemo-
radiotherapy.
Documented recurrence in the nodes only 
(without concurrent disease in the primary site) 
occurred in 1 patient in the planned-surgery 
group and in 3 patients in the surveillance 
group. Distant metastases were identified in 23 
patients in the planned-surgery group and in 
21 patients in the surveillance group.

Surgical Complications, Serious Adverse 
Events, and Global Quality of Life
A total of 22 surgical complications after neck 
dissection were noted in the surveillance group, 
as compared with 83 in the planned-surgery 
group. The rate of complications among patients 
who underwent neck dissection in the surveil-
lance group was 42% (95% CI, 24 to 59). The 
rates of complications and severe complications 
in the planned-surgery group were 38% (95% CI, 
30 to 46) and 26% (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.41), respec-
tively, with similar rates among the patients who 
underwent planned surgery after chemoradio-
therapy (39% [95% CI, 29 to 49] and 20% [95% 
CI, 0.13 to 0.28], respectively) and among pa-
tients who underwent planned surgery before 
chemoradiotherapy (35% [95% CI, 21 to 49] and 
23% [95% CI, 12 to 40]). A smaller percentage of 
modified radical neck dissections were performed 
in the groups of patients who underwent planned 
surgery after chemoradiotherapy than in the 
group of patients who underwent planned sur-
gery before chemoradiotherapy (Table S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). A total of 282 serious 
adverse events occurred: 169 in the planned-
surgery group and 113 in the surveillance group 
(Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix).
There was a small difference in global health 
status scores on the EORTC QLQ-C30 ques-
tionnaire in favor of the surveillance group at 
6 months after randomization (mean change in 
the score at 6 months in the surveillance group 
relative to the planned-surgery group, 4.94; 
P 
= 
0.03). This difference narrowed at 12 months 
(mean change, 3.03; P 
= 
0.09) and disappeared by 
24 months (mean change, −0.81; P 
= 
0.85) (Fig. S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Cost-Effectiveness
Over the 2-year minimum follow-up period, PET-
CT–guided surveillance was more cost-effective 
than planned neck dissection. The per-person 
cost saving was £1,492 (approximately $2,190 in 
U.S. dollars), with an additional 0.08 QALYs per 
person.
Discussion
There has been lack of clarity about treatments 
after chemoradiotherapy and wide variation in the 
clinical treatment of patients with squamous-cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck who have ad-
vanced nodal disease and who have received 
chemoradiotherapy for primary treatment.1,2 Our 
trial showed that PET-CT–guided surveillance 
was noninferior to planned neck dissection and 
was equally effective in both HPV-positive and 
HPV-negative patient groups. Patients in the 
surveillance group were not disadvantaged by 
undergoing delayed neck dissection; the global 
quality-of-life scores and rates of surgical com-
plications were similar in this group and in the 
group of patients who underwent earlier planned 
neck dissection. PET-CT surveillance resulted in 
far fewer operations; approximately 80% of pa-
tients were spared neck dissection. Surveillance 
was also more cost-effective than planned neck 
dissection over the trial period.
There was a high concordance between local 
radiologic and central laboratory assessments 
in this multicenter, nationwide trial. This high 
concordance confirms the feasibility of PET-CT–
guided surveillance in routine clinical practice.
Furthermore, our trial may actually underes-
timate the benefit of PET-CT–guided surveil-
lance in patients with advanced head and neck 
cancer. Our protocol recommended neck dissec-
tion in patients with equivocal responses (PET-
CT–negative residual masses or mild FDG up-
take in normal-sized nodes) because of the high 
failure rate (37%) reported among patients with 
equivocal responses on CT after chemoradio-
therapy.1 However, a recent study suggests that 
nodal disease may take longer to involute in 
patients with HPV-positive disease.20 It is there-
fore conceivable that patients in our trial who 
had HPV-positive tumors and equivocal PET-CT 
findings (especially with enlarged nodes) at 
the 3-month assessment might have achieved a 
cure without neck dissection if they had under-
gone PET-CT at a later time. Other researchers 
have reported that nodes with no FDG uptake 
have very high rates of regional control (93%), 
especially in HPV-positive disease.21
We recommend that patients with an equivo-
cal FDG uptake should continue to undergo neck 
dissection, especially if they have HPV-negative 
disease. However, patients with HPV-positive 
cancers who have enlarged nodes but no FDG 
uptake after chemoradiotherapy may be consid-
ered for close follow-up11 with serial CT or PET-
CT; this strategy may spare even more patients 
from undergoing a neck dissection.
Our results are consistent with those associ-

PET-CT vs. Neck Dissection in Head and Neck Cancer
ated with other management approaches that are 
based on nodal response and that use CT.20,22,23 
These approaches have shown high rates of com-
plete response to chemoradiotherapy, with rela-
tively low proportions of patients undergoing 
neck dissection and good rates of long-term 
control of locoregional disease. However, unlike 
our trial, these studies were often limited be-
cause they were retrospective studies from sin-
gle, high-throughput institutions. In addition, 
they performed earlier (at 8 weeks) assessment 
of the nodal response (which is known to be less 
accurate than later assessment), and they used 
histopathological findings of neck dissection 
specimens after chemoradiotherapy as evidence 
of persistent disease (this method is known to 
overestimate persistence).11,24
Studies that have compared PET-CT with CT 
show higher efficacy of PET-CT in patients with 
advanced head and neck cancer. In one study,22 
PET-CT was superior to CT in high-risk patients 
who had a clinically significant history of smok-
ing or alcohol use or HPV-negative, nonoropha-
ryngeal primary tumors. In most countries, 
these groups constitute the majority of both 
HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients.25,26 In 
another study, PET-CT was significantly more ac-
curate than CT in identifying a complete nodal 
response, especially in patients with HPV-posi-
tive disease (93% vs. 50%).21 A prospective single-
institution study also showed that PET-CT surveil-
lance was more cost-effective than CT surveillance, 
regardless of HPV status.24 In the same study, CT 
followed by PET-CT in patients who did not have 
a response was shown to be only marginally 
more cost-effective than PET-CT alone, and with 
small changes in baseline assumptions and 
costs, CT followed by PET-CT ceased to be cost-
effective as compared with PET-CT alone.24 The 
relative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of CT, as 
compared with those of PET-CT–based ap-
proaches, require further evaluation.
At the time of the inception of this trial, it 
was not possible to calibrate standard uptake 
values among various scanning systems. Inter-
pretation of the results presented here is there-
fore limited by the fact that we could not under-
take assessments of standard uptake values in 
determining the patients’ response to therapy. 
Since calibration among systems is now feasible, 
we are undertaking a retrospective evaluation of 
standard uptake values in the scans used in this 
study to assess whether this improves the accu-
racy of the response assessments.
When extrapolating the data presented here 
to routine clinical practice, clinicians should note 
that few patients in our trial had low-prevalence, 
N3 (stage IVb) disease. Although 5 of the 9 pa-
tients with stage N3 disease in the PET-CT sur-
veillance group had complete responses, extrapo-
lation of a PET-CT–guided surveillance policy to 
this higher-risk group of patients cannot cur-
rently be justified because of the small number 
of such patients in the trial.
