The effect of green leafy and cruciferous
vegetable intake on the incidence of
cardiovascular disease: A meta-analysis
Richard Lee Pollock
Abstract
Does the consumption of green leafy vegetables including cruciferous vegetables significantly reduce the incidence of
cardiovascular disease? This research question was answered via employing the statistical methods of meta-analysis by
synthesizing relevant worldwide studies that address the association between the consumption of green leafy vegetables
and risk of incidence of said diseases. All meta-analysis calculations included determination of effect sizes of relative risk,
and their respective 95% confidence intervals, heterogeneity of the studies, relative weights for each study, and signifi-
cance (p) for each study. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria, which investigated the relationship between the
incidences of total cardiovascular disease with the intake of green leafy vegetables. The overall effect size (random
effect model) was: RR ¼ 0.842 (95% CI ¼ 0.753 to 0.941), p ¼ 0.002, which indicates a significant 15.8% reduced inci-
dence of cardiovascular disease.

Introduction
Why choose the topic of green leafy vegetables (GLV)
intake may reduce the incidence of cardiovascular dis-
ease (CVD)? There is a need to research the worldwide
scholarly journals (mostly peer reviewed) to investigate
case–control studies, prospective cohort studies, and
comparative studies dealing with GLV intake and the
incidence of these human diseases. A meta-analysis can
be used to investigate the effects of daily GLV intake on
incidence of CVD, not just in the United States but
worldwide. This study was novel because it was the
first meta-analysis focused solely on GLV including
cruciferous vegetables (CV) intake and how they influ-
ence incidence of CVD. CV are from the family
Cruciferae which are widely cultivated, with many
genera, species, and cultivars being raised for food pro-
duction such as cauliflower, cabbage, cress, bok choy,
broccoli, kale, collard greens, and similar GLV and
their roots. Meta-analysis studies are feasible where
just one researcher can search for relevant studies
from computer search engines, reference lists from stu-
dies, emails to journals and researchers in this field of
study, and physical visits to local college libraries for
review and copying of full-text studies. However,
meta-analysis research demands a significant amount
of time by the meta-analysts to collect and manage
effect sizes throughout an investigation, and be efficient
in that only relevant studies be used in meta-analysis.
After reading the ‘‘Results’’ section of many previ-
ously published articles on this topic, there are apparent
contradictions in research findings on whether GLV
intake does significantly lower incidence of CVD. This
meta-analysis research approach attempted to fill this
knowledge gap by combining risk ratios (RR) from mul-
tiple relevant studies to a common effect size of RR and
statistically examine relations between study character-
istics and findings. Risk ratios and relative risk have the
same meaning and many researchers use these two effect
sizes interchangeably. Findings between these different
studies were compared by transforming the results into
a single common effect size of RR to better understand

 these apparent contradictions in prior research findings.
Also, this meta-analysis has wider implications in scien-
tific research by assembling the latest information from
several epidemiological and experimental studies on the
agents found in GLV that theoretically lower incidence
CVD. Many relevant theories on the mechanisms
behind these protective effects will be located in one
convenient location for all to study.
Problem statement
The problem is that people worldwide are risking their
health by not consuming enough GLV on a daily basis.
In several studies, many nutrients in GLV, such as diet-
ary fiber, potassium, and antioxidants, have been asso-
ciated with reduced risk for CVD.1 What could happen if
we do not solve the problem? The World Health
Organization (WHO) write on their website that an esti-
mated 17.3 million people died from CVD in 2008, rep-
resenting 30% of all global deaths.2 Case–control
studies, prospective cohort studies, and comparative stu-
dies results have indicated that consuming enough GLV
on a daily basis would decrease these deaths rates.3 These
problems are not totally fixable, but the reductions in
mortality could probably be reduced by adequate GLV
intake. More studies such as this one could encourage the
WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention to spend extra capital on educating people
worldwide on the importance of the daily intake of GLV.
Purpose of the study
The goal of this meta-analysis research study was to
investigate the relationship of CVD with the intake of
GLV. This goal was answered by researching studies
that address the association between the consumption
of GLV and risk of incidence of CVD. The effect of
GLV intake on risk of incidences of disease can be
examined by a common measure of effect size such as
a hazard ratio (HR), odds ratio (OR), or relative risk
(risk ratio) (RR). A meta-analysis combines the results
of several studies that address a set of related measure-
ments of effect sizes.4 Advantages of meta-analysis are
to increase validity of research by applying objective
formulas to synthesize data across studies rather than
using data from a single study, control for between
study variation, and make it possible to show if a pub-
lication bias exists.5
Main variables under study
Source studies
The dependent variables (DVs) of the source studies are
the incidence of diseases, and the independent variables
(IVs) are the levels of intake of GLV. The incidence of
diseases collected in this meta-analysis study includes
the following:
DV—Incidence of CVD. Studies that meet all the inclusion
criteria, investigated the relationship of CVD with the
intake of GLV, and had a common effect size were
combined in a meta-analysis. CVD principally refers
to cardiac disease and peripheral arterial disease and
usually caused by atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in
arteries) and/or high blood pressure. In this meta-ana-
lysis study, CVD included myocardial infarction, ische-
mic stroke, coronary heart disease, and ischemic heart
disease. The purpose was to investigate a possible ten-
dency of a significant reduction in risk of developing
CVD due to frequent intake of GLV.
IV—Intake levels of GLV. Leaf vegetables, greens, vege-
table greens, leafy greens, or salad greens, are plant
leaves eaten as a vegetable. They come from a very
wide variety of plants all over the world, with nearly
1000 species of plants with edible leaves are known.
GLV most often come from short-lived herbaceous
plants such as lettuce and spinach. The IV of the
source studies was an adequate daily intake of GLV
and how this influences the DV which was the incidence
of CVD. This study recognized the many theories of
how GLV intake may reduce incidence of disease.
The calculated effect sizes of GLV intake on disease
incidence from each study were combined. Meta-analy-
sis: The output variables from the source studies were
their calculated effect sizes (one for each source study),
which was risk ratio (RR), and were synthesized via
meta-analysis methods, to derive the overall effect size
for CVD.
Measured adequacy intake of GLV
Diet in these types of source studies was usually
assessed by item semi-quantitative food frequency ques-
tionnaire that included fruit and vegetable items. For
each food item, a standard serving size was specified.
Weight or volume of that item was commonly con-
sumed by the US population at one meal was used.
On the dietary questionnaires, participants reported
their average intake of the specified portion size (ser-
ving) for each food over the past year. For each food
item on the questionnaire, several responses were pos-
sible, ranging from ‘‘never or less than once per month’’
to ‘‘six or more times per day.’’ Frequencies and por-
tions for the individual food items were converted to
average daily intake of each fruit and vegetable item for
each participant. The average daily intakes of individ-
ual food items were combined to compute total fruit
and vegetable intake and intakes of composite fruit and
2

 vegetable groups in most source studies. The consump-
tion of GLV (grams/day) was calculated from these
responses; however, intake was not measured consist-
ently for all source studies. Finally, the association
between risk for incidence of disease and the highest
versus lowest tertile, quartile, or quintiles intake of
fruits and vegetables was estimated.
Theoretical assumptions and
conceptual framework
Figure 1 describes the IV as an adequate daily intake of
GLV collected from source studies and how this influ-
ences the DVs which are the incidence of CVD from
these source studies. This study recognized the many
theories of how GLV intake reduces incidence of dis-
ease. The intervening variable facilitates a better under-
standing of the relationship between GLV intake and
reduction of disease. Some of these hypothesized inter-
vening variables found in GLV are folic acid, the anti-
oxidants beta-carotene and vitamin E, soluble fiber,
calcium, and vitamin K. It has been theorized in numer-
ous studies that these essential nutrients and phyto-
chemicals found in GLV, if consumed in adequate
amounts, reduces the incidences of some human
diseases.6
The researchers in these studies theorize on the
mechanisms of disease reduction caused by GLV
intake. In the 2010 decade, researchers are conducting
extensive research studies to discover phytochemicals
connections to disease prevention, but so far, solid evi-
dence is mostly lacking.7
There are thousands of these phytochemicals in
GLV, and researchers are just beginning to understand
and theorize how a handful of these phytochemicals
work, and what is current in the 2010 decade may
change tomorrow.7 There is a need to research the
scholarly journals to investigate case–control studies,
prospective cohort studies, and comparative studies
dealing with GLV intake and the incidence of CVD.
A meta-analysis can be used to investigate the long-
term effects of daily GLV intake on incidence of
CVD. In each of these studies, the IV is the intake
level of GLV; the intervening variable is the levels of
the elements; the DV is the incidence of disease; and the
statistical output is the RR calculated effect size.
Methodology
Most primary studies that investigate the relationship
between GLV intake and incidence of human disease
report HR, OR, or risk ratio (relative risk), and their
95%
confidence
intervals
for
their
effect
sizes.
Unfortunately, with these common reported results,
the three effect sizes cannot be converted into each
other, and thus the power of this meta-analysis could
be reduced. Searching for numerous relevant studies
with these common effect sizes was the goal of this
meta-analysis because the outcome is dependent and
based on the quality and success of an assiduous
search for potential studies.4 Searching for relevant stu-
dies was primarily performed by computer search
engines seeking databases which included information
about the subject. PubMed Central, Academic Search
Complete, Medline, Proquest Central, ScienceDirect,
Google, and Yahoo online were the most online peri-
odical databases used. Reference lists from studies,
physical visits to libraries for review, and copying of
full-text studies were also used to obtain as much rele-
vant data as possible, and the use of interlibrary loan
from the local community college was used to collect

 method for including studies in this meta-analysis was
incorporated by reviewing the full-text publications
from scholarly peer-reviewed journals to ensure that
sound statistical methods were followed, whereas non-
scholarly journals were not accepted. Also, source stu-
dies were the unit of analysis with only one effect size
computed for each source study.4
Selection of final set of relevant studies
All studies collected were assigned a unique identifica-
tion number and compiled into a master database
within a Microsoft Office Excel spreadsheet. This
allowed for convenient repetitive sorting and extracting
of data, and later on for transferring data to supporting
statistical compatible software packages.4 The final set
of studies were selected from those studies that met all
the inclusion criteria. The main criteria for including an
individual study in this meta-analysis were as follows:
did the study include the relationship between GLV
intake and incidence of CVD and did the researchers
from these individual studies include risk ratio and their
95% confidence intervals in their result section.
Inclusion/exclusion of source studies
The criteria for including studies in this meta-analysis
included (1) a time period for collecting source studies
which was from 1989 until 2014; (2) include only full-
text scholarly journal studies; (3) only studies that were
published by peer-reviewed and scholarly journals were
included; (4) the collection of primary studies had to be
a collaborative cohort, case–control, population-based
cohort, or a prospective cohort study design; (5) only
include relations between similar IVs (GLV intake
including CVs) and DVs (incidence of CVD); and (6)
studies that reported an effect size of RR and their
respective 95% confidence interval data.
Data analysis and statistical testing
All meta-analysis calculations were performed by the
software
package
Comprehensive
Meta-Analysis
Version 2 by Biostat (CMA v.2). CMA v.2 was devel-
oped specifically for use in meta-analysis. These calcu-
lations include determining effect sizes (risk ratio
(relative risk), and their 95% confidence intervals), het-
erogeneity of the studies, relative weights for each
study, significance (p) for each study, and for determin-
ing methods for detecting the presence of publication
bias and assessing its impact on the analysis. Risk ratios
were calculated in the source studies, whereas the over-
all effect sizes were calculated by CMA v.2 software.
Relative risk (RR) is defined as ratio of the incidence
rate among exposed individuals to the incidence rate
among unexposed individuals and is used in cohort
study design because these designs have a well-defined
population. To calculate a crude RR, researchers would
use the following formula: RR ¼ (a/a þ b)/(c/c þ d),
where: a ¼ number of individuals with a disease who
were exposed, b ¼ number of individuals without a dis-
ease who were exposed, c ¼ number of individuals with
a disease who were not exposed, and d ¼ number of
individuals without a disease who were not exposed.
Borenstein et al.5 write that the selection of a model
must be based soley on the question of which model fits
the distribution of effect sizes, and when studies are
collected from published literature, the random effects
model is a more plausible match for the meta-analysis.
These same authors write that changing models if the
test for heterogeneity is significant is a mistake, and
should be strongly discouraged. Determination on
which model to use in this study was decided following
analysis of the calculated I2 and Cochran’s Q (Q-value)
statistics of hetrogeneity. The Q-value is calculated as
the weighted sum of the squared differences between
individual source study effects and the pooled effect
across studies, with the relative weights being those
used in the pooling method.8 Q-value is distributed as
a chi-square statistic with number of studies �1 degrees
of freedom. The I2 statistic describes the percentages of
variation across source studies that is due to heterogen-
eity rather than chance.8 These same authors write that
I2 is an intuitive and simple calculation of inconsistency
of studies’ results which does not inherently depend
upon the number of source studies in the meta-analysis.
In interpreting of the Q-value, heterogeneity of the
combined studies exists if its p-value is < 0.05. If the
p-value of the Q-value < 0.05, then the random effect
model should be used for the meta-analysis.9 If the p-
value of the Q-value > 0.05, then the fixed effect model
should be chosen for the meta-analysis. The I2 can also
be used to determine which model to use during a meta-
analysis. The following has been proposed for inter-
preting I2 and used in meta-analysis; low heterogeneity
is I2¼ 25%, moderate heterogeneity is I2¼ 50%, and
high heterogeneity is I2¼ 75%.8
The relative weights for each study were calculated
by CMA v.2 software package. Small studies tend to
have wide confidence intervals, and large studies tend
to have narrow confidence intervals with larger studies
given greater percent relative weights.10 An effect size of
1.00 represents no treatment effect. Whereas when the
effect size falls below 1.00, this indicated participants
who consumed GLV in the highest quartile were less
likely to develop incidence of disease. If the effect size
falls above 1.00, this indicated participants were more
likely to develop incidence of disease due to GLV
intake in the highest intake quartile. The confidence
interval bounding each study reflects the precision of
4

 the estimate, with small studies tending to have wide
confidence intervals and large studies tending to have
narrow confidence intervals.10 The use of 95% confi-
dence interval in this study was used, so each meta-
analysis performed in this study was statistically signifi-
cant (p < 0.05) if and only if the confidence interval
excluded the null value of 1.0 for each effect model
synthesized.10 The conventional value of significance
level for this meta-analysis was pre-set to an alpha of
0.05.11
Subgroups within studies
CMA v.2 allows the meta-analyst to record data by
subgroups within the study. Some studies collected in
this study used subgroups, e.g., gender, GLV, CV, pre-
menopausal,
postmenopausal,
never
tobacco,
ever
tobacco, dark GLV, light GLV, cardia cancer, and
non-cardia cancer. In this study, it emerged that the
effect sizes were comparable for each subgroup, so it
was decided to use the study as the unit of analysis.
This required calculating a ‘‘combined’’ effect size (uti-
lizing the CMA v.2 software) for subgroups within each
study, and imputes the values for the full group which
recorded one treatment effect for each study.
Detecting publication bias
To detect the presence of publication bias, all studies
used in this meta-analysis were examined using a funnel
plot of the natural logarithm of the effect size versus its
precision (1/standard error). The plot by precision is
the traditional form.5 The funnel plot graph, Begg
and Mazumdar’s test for correlation, Egger’s test for
regression, Duval and Tweedie’s trim and fill, and the
classic fail-safe method were calculated by CMA v.2
software for detecting the presence of publication bias
and assessing its impact on this meta-analysis study.
Borenstein et al.5 define these multiple methods for
detecting the presence of publication bias as follows:
(1) Duval and Tweedie’s trim and fill builds on the
key idea behind the precision funnel plot; that in the
absence of publication bias, the plot would be symmet-
ric about the summary effect. If there are more small
studies on the right than on the left of the mean effect
size, the concern is that studies may be missing from the
left. Duval and Tweedie’s method imputes these miss-
ing studies, adds them to the analysis, and then re-com-
putes
the
summary
effect
size;
(2)
Begg
and
Mazumdar’s rank correlation test reports the rank cor-
relation between the standardized effect size and the
variances of the effects. If the rank correlation gave a
p-value of >0.05, this would indicate no evidence of
publication bias; (3) Egger’s linear regression method
uses the actual values of the effect sizes and their
precision. The standardized effect is regressed on preci-
sion and if the regression intercept gave a p-value of
>0.05, this would indicate no evidence of publication
bias; and (4) Classic fail-safe N test computes the
number of possible missing studies with the mean
effect of zero that would need to be added to the
meta-analysis to yield a statistically non-significant
overall effect. If the number of missing studies that
would bring the p-value to >0.05 is relatively small,
then there is indeed cause for concern regarding the
strength of the meta-analysis’ overall result. If the
number is large, the meta-analyst can be confident
that the treatment effect size is not nil.
Data analysis and results
Eight studies met the inclusion criteria, which investi-
gated the relationship between the incidences of total
CVD with the intake of GLV. Eight studies shown in
Table 1 had a similar common effect size (RR), and a
random effect model was used to combine results from
the eight studies. Figure 2 shows a Forest plot of the
eight studies and the random effect model. Subgroups
GLV and CV were combined in five of the studies to
calculate one treatment effect for each study as shown
in Figure 2. The heterogeneity of the eight studies was
Q-value ¼ 37.473,
p ¼ 0.00, I2¼ 81.32.
The random
effect model indicates an overall RR effect size of the
‘‘almost every day’’ highest versus lowest quantile
intake category of GLV on CVD as: RR ¼ 0.842
(95% CI ¼ 0.753 to 0.941), p ¼ 0.002.
Figure 3 shows a possible presence of publication
bias in the eight CVD studies with the studies distrib-
uted to the left about the mean effect size. Duval and
Tweedie’s method imputes missing studies to the right
and adjusts new RR ¼ 0.897, 95% CI ¼ 0.803 to 0.99
from the observed values (0.842, 95% CI ¼ 0.753 to
0.941).

p-value (two-tailed) ¼ 0.137, indicating no evidence of

would be 78 missing studies that would bring the
p-value to >0.05.
Discussion and summary of the study
A noteworthy finding of this study is the protective
effect associated with high consumption of GLV includ-
ing CVs. These vegetables are a characteristic and trad-
itional dietary habit of worldwide populations. It has
been previously postulated that this could explain the
very low diabetes, CVD, and cancer incidence rates
observed in populations that consume these vegetables.
The role of diet in the causation of human disease is

 complex, partly because diet and dietary habits include
a wide variety of foods and because the methods by
which these habits can be measured are cumbersome
as well as difficult to apply to a large number of indi-
viduals. This study has been able to provide some clues
for further investigation into the role of diet of GLV
prevalent in regions where causation of CVD occurs.
In this study, there were only 13 relevant studies
found that tested the association between intake of
GLV and the incidence of CVD. These included myo-
cardial infarction, ischemic stroke, total stroke, cere-
brovascular
disease,
coronary
heart
disease,
and
ischemic heart disease. Eight studies used the effect
size RR which included over 540,000 participants
including controls in prospective cohort and case–con-
trol studies. These eight studies included a total of
26,173 known cases of CVD. The research question
of this study was does an increased intake of GLV sig-
nificantly reduce the incidence of CVD? The random
effect model calculated a multivariate RR ¼ 0.842 (95%
CI ¼ 0.753 to 0.941), p ¼ 0.002 which does indicate an
increased intake of GLV significantly reduces the inci-
dence of CVD by 15.8%.
Several agents found in GLV may cause reduction in
the incidence of CVD. Bile acid binding capacity has
been related to the cholesterol-lowering potential of
foods. Lowered recirculation of bile acids results in util-
ization of cholesterol to synthesize bile acid and
reduced fat absorption, thus bile acid binding potential
has been related to lowering the risk of heart disease.19
These same researchers found that steam cooking sig-
nificantly improved the in vitro bile acid binding of
collard greens, kale, mustard greens, broccoli, and cab-
bage and concluded that GLV, when consumed regu-
larly after steam cooking, would lower the risk of CVD.
Nitric oxide pathway represents a critical advance in
understanding CVD, and today a number of human
diseases are characterized by nitric oxide insufficiency.20
The same authors write that regular intake of nitrate-
containing food such as GLV may ensure that blood
and tissue levels of nitrite and nitric oxide pools are
maintained at a level sufficient to compensate for any
disturbances in endogenous nitric oxide synthesis. Also,
in observational studies, magnesium intake has been
inversely associated with hypertension and CVD.21
The same researchers found the available evidence indi-
cates that dietary magnesium may favorably affect a
cluster of metabolic abnormalities including insulin
resistance,
hypertension,
and metabolic
syndrome.
Metabolic syndrome is prevalent worldwide and is
associated with greater risks of major chronic diseases,
particularly type 2 diabetes and CVD. As previously
stated, GLV are high in magnesium.22
Several epidemiological and experimental studies
have been published on the cardiovascular benefits of
omega-3 fatty acids and that alpha-linolenic acid is an
omega-3 fatty acid present in seeds and oils, GLV, and
nuts and beans.23 Antioxidants are important in pro-
tection
against
hypertension,
diabetes,
CVD,
and
cancer.24 Molecular evidence suggests that trace elem-
ents and antioxidant molecules found in GLV lower
risk of cancer and CVD through mechanisms that
modulate free radical attack on nucleic acids, proteins,
and
polyunsaturated
fatty
acids.26,25
Lutein
is
a
member of the carotenoid family, a group of powerful
antioxidants, and is a non-provitamin-A carotenoid
found in dark GLV. The mechanism by which lutein
is involved in the prevention of cardiovascular heart
disease
may
also
be
related
to
its
role
as
an
antioxidant.27
Implications of study
This meta-analysis study found a high daily intake of
GLV significantly reduced incidence of several types of
CVD. This is the first meta-analysis study that has
focused solely on GLV including CV intake and how
they influence incidence of these specific human dis-
eases. Relevant studies for the past 25 years were
synthesized to demonstrate the importance GLV have
in reducing the incidence of these extremely lethal
chronic diseases. The study’s positive findings should
further influence healthcare practitioners, educational
instructors of nutrition, and especially government
agencies to continuously educate people about the
importance of consuming GLV on a daily basis.
Recommendations for further research
Since results from any single epidemiologic meta-ana-
lysis study may not provide conclusive evidence; add-
itional studies in other worldwide populations should
be done. Further epidemiologic studies will be needed,
since large long-term randomized, controlled trials of
nutrition would be difficult to pursue to a significant
conclusion. Cross and Lim’s28 review of the epidemio-
logic literature on diet and disease reveals a number of
future research directions that should be pursued.
These same authors believe overall, more studies are
required to resolve inconsistent findings, especially
where significant findings are limited to retrospective
studies. They write, ‘‘Prospective cohorts would deliver
risk estimates less biased by differential recalls by
patients or any recent dietary changes due to disease.’’
Cross and Lim28 also state that a thorough ascertain-
ment of data on potential confounders and adjustments
are imperative to assess the ‘‘true’’ diet-disease associ-
ations because this is a common problem of all obser-
vational studies. Furthermore, Cross and Lim28 state
that more biomarker studies should be researched
Pollock

 because they may provide more direct evidence for cer-
tain nutrients and their interactions with relevant gen-
etic polymorphisms and this may shed light on the
potentially complex involvement of nutrition in disease
incidence. Thus, this meta-analysis type of study can
and
should
be
repeated,
once
more
studies
are
published.
Further research in the 21st century should be
focused on conducting extensive research studies to dis-
cover phytochemicals connections to disease prevention
because solid evidence is mostly lacking.7 Researchers
are just beginning to understand and theorize how a
small percent of the different phytochemicals in GLV
work. There are potentially thousands of phytochem-
ical compounds from extracts of plant roots, leaves,
and stems that have shown promising potential as
anticancer drugs, or for serving as lead compounds in
the synthesis of new drugs.28–30 The potential is here
just waiting for new researchers to cure cancer, type 2,
and CVD via new phytochemical drug discoveries.
