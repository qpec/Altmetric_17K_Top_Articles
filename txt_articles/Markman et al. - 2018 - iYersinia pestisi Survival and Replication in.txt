 Plague ecology is characterized by sporadic epizootics, 
then periods of dormancy. Building evidence suggests en-
vironmentally ubiquitous amebae act as feral macrophages 
and hosts to many intracellular pathogens. We conducted 
environmental genetic surveys and laboratory co-culture 
infection experiments to assess whether plague bacteria 
were resistant to digestion by 5 environmental ameba spe-
cies. First, we demonstrated that Yersinia pestis is resistant 
or transiently resistant to various ameba species. Second, 
we showed that Y. pestis survives and replicates intracellu-
larly within Dictyostelium discoideum amebae for ˃48 hours 
postinfection, whereas control bacteria were destroyed in <1 
hour. Finally, we found that Y. pestis resides within ameba 
structures synonymous with those found in infected human 
macrophages, for which Y. pestis is a competent pathogen. 
Evidence supporting amebae as potential plague reservoirs 
stresses the importance of recognizing pathogen-harboring 
amebae as threats to public health, agriculture, conserva-
tion, and biodefense.
T
he etiologic agent of plague, Yersinia pestis, is a gram-
negative coccobacillus and a facultative intracellular 
pathogen. Y. pestis exhibited the highest overall mortality 
rate of any infectious disease from its earliest recorded 
emergence through 1941 (1). During 2010–2015, a mean 
of 650 cases were reported globally each year, with a case 
fatality rate of 23%–41% (depending on manifestation 
as bubonic, pneumonic, or septicemic plague), rising to 
66%–100% when adequate medical care was not promptly 
received (2). Y. pestis primarily infects small ground-dwell-
ing mammals, specifically of the taxonomic order Roden-
tia, but maintains high spillover potential to other verte-
brates, including humans, caused by its high virulence and 
fleaborne transmission. Epizootic plague is typically vec-
tored by multiple flea species and is transmitted within and 
between meta-populations of hosts by flea bites (Figure 1).
Plague ecology is characterized by sporadic epizo-
otics, followed by 2–5-year cryptic dormancy periods 
(3–9). Despite much information on epizootic transmis-
sion mechanisms, little is known about the origin of re-
emergent plague cases in wild animal populations (Figure 
1). Plague among wild animals commonly re-emerges 
in plague foci after multiple years of inactivity, despite 
ongoing biosurveillance and attempts at detection during 
interepizootic periods. The existence of environmental 
plague reservoirs has been theorized for >80 years (3–
13). Various avenues of recent research suggest that soil-
dwelling amebae may be competent environmental res-
ervoirs of Y. pestis. Amebae are a taxonomically diverse 
group of phagocytic organisms residing in every major 
lineage of eukaryotes. Amebae are pervasive in soil and 
water environments and are recognized for their ability to 
harbor pathogens that drastically affect ecologic commu-
nities (14–19). Free-living amebae cycle between 2 dis-
tinct life-states: trophozoites, an active, mobile, feeding 
state; and cysts or spores, a robust dormant state induced 
in part by adverse environmental conditions.
Ameba reservoir potential for Y. pestis is indicated by 
4 major factors: the ability of related Y. enterocolitica and 
Y. pseudotuberculosis bacteria to persist in protozoan ame-
bae (20–22); correlative data indicating plague epizootics 
temporally follow periods of increased precipitation known 
to reanimate ameba cysts (5,23,24); the demonstrated abil-
ity of Y. pestis to express various proteins enabling escape 
of the phagolysosome in a diverse array of phagocytic cells 
including human macrophages (25–27); and prior associa-
tions between Y. pestis and the soil amebae, Vermamoeba 
(formerly Hartmanella) rhysodes and Acanthamoeba cas-
tellanii, that demonstrate intracellular persistence up to 5 
days (13,28,29). Amebae display a high degree of func-
tional homology with mammalian macrophages, leading to 
the description of amebae as feral macrophages. The ameba 
reservoir hypothesis is compelling for many pathogens with 
unexplained sporadic occurrence and cryptic dormancy pe-
riods as supported by a growing catalog (>225) of intra-
cellular pathogens capable of surviving and/or replicating 
within amebae under diverse conditions (14,17,18,30).

 Yersinia pestis in Potential Ameba Reservoir
We tested the hypothesis that 5 species of environ-
mentally ubiquitous amebae demonstrate reservoir poten-
tial for the maintenance of Y. pestis. We implemented field 
and laboratory investigations to assess environmental co-
occurrence of study ameba species with plague epizootics; 
experimental infection prevalence in amebae; experimental 
infection intensity; intraameba bacterial location; bacte-
rial viability postphagocytosis; and bacterial replication 
inside trophozoite amebae. We discuss the potential for 
D. discoideum ameba to act as interepizootic reservoirs, 
the functional homology between phagocytic amebae and 
mammalian macrophages, and the ability of ameba to exert 
selective pressure on the evolutionary trajectory of patho-
gen virulence and transmission mode. Further, we stress 
the importance of recognizing pathogen-harboring amebae 
as potential threats to global health, agriculture, conserva-
tion, and biodefense.
Materials and Methods
By using field experiments, we molecularly assessed the 
co-occurrence of amebae and Y. pestis in prairie dog bur-
rows in the Pawnee National Grassland of northeastern 
Colorado, USA. This grassland is an established plague 
foci that has exhibited recurrent plague epizootics since 
≈1940 (31). We used molecular analyses of soil and ame-
bae cultured from the soil to identify candidate ameba spe-
cies that may act as reservoirs for plague persistence.
Plague-Endemic Soil Isolates
We selected 24 prairie dog burrows from 8 prairie dog colo-
nies, which can contain hundreds of animals, on the basis of 
suspected plague presence indicated by sustained decreases 
in population size during a 3-week observation period in 
August 2016 (online Technical Appendix Figure 1, http://
wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/24/2/17-1065-Techapp1.pdf). 
We selected individual burrows within the colony bound-
aries on the basis of apparent prairie dog activity (feces, 
freshly excavated soil, and noncollapsed burrow structure) 
and along a gradient from the center of the colony to the 
periphery. We collected soil by attaching 50-mL conical 
tubes to a 6-m flexible metal probe, maneuvering the probe 
into the prairie dog burrow to maximum achievable depth, 
and using the probe to scrape soil into the tubes. We sealed 
viable soil samples (>20 mL from >3 m deep) and stored 
them at 22°C until processing within 12 hours.
Cultivation of Amebae from Soil
We isolated amebae from soil in plague-affected prairie 
dog burrows by using modified culture methods (32) (on-
line Technical Appendix Figure 2), incubated culture plates 
at 28°C, and observed for changes daily. We supplemented 
liquid medium with gentamicin (200 μg/mL) after 72 hours 
or at earliest detection of any bacterial growth. We asep-
tically transferred ameba cultures without bacterial con-
tamination to 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks in ameba-specific 
media containing penicillin/streptomycin. We identified 
ameba by using multiplex and endpoint PCR after extract-
ing DNA by using a QIAGEN DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit 
(QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) (33,34) (online Technical 
Appendix Figure 3).
Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions
We cultured Y. pestis strains from frozen stocks in ly-
sogeny broth (LB) medium. We used 2 strains of Y. pes-
tis throughout the study: a nontransformed prototypical 
strain of Y. pestis CO92 and a recombinant gfp-express-
ing strain, Y. pestis CO92 pgm+, pCD1, pGFPuv, amp+, 
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Fort 
Collins, CO, USA). We cultured the transformed strain 
by using 100 μg/mL carbenicillin to maintain selective 
pressure for retention of gfp plasmids. Culture conditions

Figure 1. Infection pathways for plague. During plague 
epizootics, transmission occurs through flea vectors within 
meta-populations of ground-dwelling rodents. It is unknown by 
what route or mechanism Yersinia pestis is maintained during 
interepizootic periods of plague quiescence. Previous research 
on fleas has not strongly supported their reservoir potential 
across interepizootic periods (3). The experiment and analysis  
of this study test the hypothesis that ameboid species 
demonstrate reservoir potential for Y. pestis. If Y. pestis is 
maintained within ameba reservoirs, we suspect that epizootic 
recrudescence may occur when infected soilborne amebae 
enter the bloodstream of naive rodent hosts (by entering 
wounds from antagonistic host-to-host interactions or burrowing 
activities). Amebae typically lyse when incubated at 37°C and 
simultaneously release their intracellular cargo, potentially 
initiating an infection.
 RESEARCH
simulated a mammalian host environment (37°C for 24 h 
to stationary phase) and then an extra-host environment 
(28°C for 24 h) to activate phenotypically plastic expres-
sion profiles. We monitored bacterial growth spectropho-
tometrically at OD600.
Ameba Strains and Culture Conditions
We obtained stocks of A. lenticulata (ATCC 30841), A. 
castellanii (ATCC 30234), A. polyphaga Linc-Ap1 (CCAP 
1501/18), and V. vermiformis (ATCC 50237) from the 
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) 
and the Culture Collection of Algae and Protozoa (https://
www.ccap.ac.uk/) and Dictyostelium discoideum (NC4A2) 
from DictyBase (http://dictybase.org/). We axenically cul-
tivated ameba stocks with genera-specific media in T25 tis-
sue culture flasks at 28°C and verified them to be axenic by 
using standardized methods (19,35–37).
Co-culture Experiments
Intraameba Infection Prevalence and Intensity Assays
We individually co-cultured laboratory ameba species with 
Y. pestis by using established methods (21). We adjusted 
viable ameba trophozoite densities to 5 × 105 trophozoites/
mL in triplicate 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks and combined 
Y. pestis (CO92 pgm+, pCD1, pGFPuv, amp+) cultures 
with ameba flasks (excluding ameba controls), resulting in 
5 × 107 viable Y. pestis cells/mL and a multiplicity of in-
fection (MOI) of 100 on the basis of OD 600 calculations. 
We incubated co-cultures at 28°C for 4 h before remov-
ing infected amebae, ameba controls, and bacteria controls 
from the surface of the flasks and washing them 3 times 
with Page amoeba saline (PAS) at 100 × g for 5 min (36). 
We then exposed amebae to gentamicin (100 μg/mL) for 
either 1 or 4 h to eliminate residual extracellular bacteria, 
then washed them 3 more times to remove antibiotic drug 
residue. Finally, we removed the supernatant from the last 
wash, concentrated it via centrifugation (4,400 × g for 10 
min), then plated it on LB agar to ensure no extracellular 
bacteria persisted.
We fixed aliquots of each infected ameba treatment in 
4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min before washing (4,400 
× g, 5 min) and resuspending in 1× PAS for microscop-
ic analysis. We used a fluorescent confocal microscope 
(Zeiss LSM 510 with ZEN 2009 SP2 software [Carl Zeiss 
GmbH, Thornwood, NY, USA]) to determine mean infec-
tion prevalence (the percentage of amebae containing >1 
intracellular Y. pestis bacterium across 16 fields of view 
per treatment replicate). We determined mean infection 
intensity and its distribution by quantifying the number of 
intracellular bacteria per individual infected ameba, veri-
fied by z-stack confocal microscopy across 16 fields of 
view per treatment replicate. We used 1-way measured 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) on prevalence and intensi-
ty means across all 5 amebae species. We log-transformed 
data as necessary to meet model assumption and used 
least-squared mean analyses with Tukey’s adjustments 
for pairwise comparisons.
Ultrastructural Description of Intraameba Bacterial Location
We used Y. pestis (CO92 pgm+, pCD1, pGFPuv, amp+) 
in similar co-culture infection assays with A. castellanii 
(MOI 100 in PAS at 28°C). We co-cultured bacteria for 
durations of 10 min, 30 min, and 24 h to assess proxi-
mal and delayed effects of phagocytosis on bacterial cell 
viability and intraameba bacterial location. After co-cul-
ture, mixtures were fixed in standard electron microscopy 
fixative for 2 h, then washed 2 times in 0.1 M cacodylate 
buffer. We then shipped fixed samples in 0.1 M cacodyl-
ate buffer to the Cryo-electron Microscopy Laboratory at 
the University of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston, TX, 
USA) for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) ac-
cording to standardized procedures. We determined bac-
terial location within amebae by ultrastructural analysis 
of transmission electron micrographs and studied intra-
cellular bacterial morphology to assess ameba-mediated 
bacterial lysis as measured by cell size, shape, and appar-
ent membrane integrity.
Intraameba Bacterial Survival and Quantification of 
Intraameba Bacterial Replication
We performed intraameba bacterial survival and replica-
tion assays in triplicate across 5 ameba species (A. cas-
tellanii, A. lenticulata, A. polyphaga, D. discoideum, and 
V. vermiformis); 2 bacteria species (Y. pestis CO92 and 
Escherichia coli); 5 postinfection time points (0, 1, 4, 24, 
and 48 h); and 3 antibiotic drug exposure periods (0, 1, and 
4 h) for removing extracellular bacteria postinfection. We 
used E. coli as an ameba-susceptible control bacterium. 
We performed co-cultures in 200-μL volumes within 96-
well plates at a MOI of 100 in 1/2× dilute ameba growth 
medium at 28°C for 1 h and used control ameba and bac-
teria as monocultures. After initial infection, we removed 
the supernatant of each well, washed wells 3 times with 
PAS, exposed them to gentamicin (100 μg/mL), washed 
3 times more, and incubated them in PAS. PAS was veri-
fied to be bacteriostatic to Y. pestis, thereby precluding 
extracellular bacterial replication and continuous inges-
tion by amebae. We lysed infected ameba trophozoites 
selectively with 100 μL 0.5% sodium deoxycholate for 5 
min before serially diluting and plating on LB agar. We 
incubated plates at 28°C for 48 h before counting CFUs to 
determine bacterial survival and replication after phago-
cytosis by amebae. The 0.5% sodium deoxycholate lysing 
detergent had no effect on CFU counts in bacterial mono-
culture controls (data not shown).

 Yersinia pestis in Potential Ameba Reservoir
Results
Y. pestis and 5 species of amebae co-occur in soils of prai-
rie dog burrows undergoing plague epizootics. We cultured 
a wide diversity of amebae from soil within plague-positive 
prairie dog burrows in northeastern Colorado and identi-
fied live amebae of each study species (online Technical 
Appendix Figure 3). Among 8 prairie dog colonies, 24 bur-
rows sampled yielded 15 heterogeneous ameba cultures 
free of bacteria or fungi. We identified >1 Acanthamoeba 
spp. from 86.6% of cultures (n = 13), D. discoideum from 
53.3% of cultures (n = 8), and V. vermiformis from 6.6% of 
cultures (n = 1).
Y. pestis is phagocytosed by amebae with heteroge-
neous prevalence and intensity. Representative fluorescent 
confocal micrographs of A. castellanii and D. discoideum 
illustrate differences in infection intensity and prevalence 
(Figure 2). ANOVA F-test results indicate significant dif-
ferences in infection prevalence (or phagocytic efficiency) 
among ameba species (p = 0.0231) (Table). Repeat experi-
ments maintained relative ranking of mean infection inten-
sity and infection prevalence across ameba species (A. cas-
tellanii, n = 1,441; A. lenticulata, n = 1,156; A. polyphaga, 
n = 737; D. discoideum, n = 624; and V. vermiformis, n 
= 528). Pairwise comparisons indicate V. vermiformis has 
significantly lower infection prevalence than A. lenticulata 
(p = 0.0344). Infection prevalence ranged from 24.07% in 
1 replicate of V. vermiformis to 54.83% in 1 replicate of 
A. lenticulata.
Infection intensity was also significantly different 
among ameba species (p = 0.0014) (Table). Pairwise com-
parisons showed V. vermiformis has a significantly lower 
infection intensity than both A. lenticulata (p = 0.0014) and 
A. polyphaga (p = 0.0082) and that D. discoideum has a 
significantly lower infection intensity than A. lenticulata (p 
= 0.0455). These findings demonstrate genus-level differ-
ences in infection intensity. Infection intensity frequencies 
followed a strong negative binomial distribution (Figure 
3). Each ameba species had several high-intensity outliers 
ranging up to a maximum of 84 intracellular bacteria ob-
served in 1 A. lenticulata ameba (Figure 3).
Y. pestis resides in digestive and central vacuoles of 
both D. discoideum and A. castellanii amebae. Green fluo-
rescent protein expressed by intracellular Y. pestis co-lo-
calizes with ameba vacuoles (Figure 2). TEM micrographs 
depict intracellular Y. pestis maintaining cellular shape and 
apparent membrane integrity inside A. castellanii ameba 
for <24 h postinfection (Figure 4). Ultrastructural analy-
sis of TEM images reveals Y. pestis persistence within the 
niche of a tight-fitting vacuolar membrane visually similar 
to Yersinia-containing vacuoles (YCVs) observed in in-
fected macrophages (27).
Y. pestis can survive inside D. discoideum amebae 
for >48 hours, but we found genus-level differences in in-
traameba survival of Y. pestis (Table). The bacterium did 
not survive beyond 24 h postinfection in A. castellanii, A. 
lenticulata, A. polyphaga, or V. vermiformis. However, Y. 
pestis co-cultured with D. discoideum exhibited consistent 
intracellular survival for >48 h postinfection under variable 
treatment conditions (Table; Figure 5). Y. pestis exhibited 
significantly higher survival/recoverability when co-cul-
tured with amebae as compared to Y. pestis monoculture 
controls (p<0.001). Y. pestis monoculture controls yielded

determined the prevalence and 
intensity of bacterial uptake by 
manual counting of amebae 
by using z-stack fluorescent 
confocal microscopy and 
averaging across 15 fields 
per replicate of each ameba 
species. Confocal count 
data represent the minimum 
prevalence/intensity values. 
Bacteria adherent to the 
outside of ameba or those with 
uncertain intracellular status 
were discarded. The minimum count threshold to reduce random count bias to accepted levels was determined to be 500 per 
ameba species. Scale bars indicate 30 μm.

a mean of 17 CFUs after 1 h of gentamicin exposure with 
no recoverable control bacteria across all other treatments. 
Conversely, E. coli bacteria did not significantly persist un-
der any treatment conditions when co-cultured with ameba 
(p<0.001). Uninfected ameba control lysates consistently 
yielded zero bacteria across all ameba species and treat-
ments (data not shown). All Y. pestis co-cultures exposed 
to antibiotics had supernatants free of extracellular bacte-
ria. Y. pestis had no cytopathic effect on any of the tested 
ameba species as verified by comparing ameba abundance 
between co-culture treatments and ameba monoculture 
controls (data not shown).
Y. pestis replicates intracellularly in D. discoideum 
amebae for >48 hours postinfection (Table; Figure 5). In 
D. discoideum, the abundance of viable intracellular Y. 
pestis was significantly greater at each successive time 
point (24 and 48 h postinfection) after 1 h of antibiotic drug 
 
exposure (p = 0.01 and p = 0.002, respectively). Addition-
ally, the abundances of viable Y. pestis in D. discoideum at 
24 and 48 h postinfection were significantly greater than 
immediately after the 4-h antibiotic treatment (p = 0.008 
and p = 0.001, respectively). After 48 h postinfection, vi-
able intracellular Y. pestis was only recovered from D. dis-
coideum treatments. Because the data did not meet standard 
ANOVA assumptions of normality despite transformation 
attempts, we used a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis rank-
sum test to compare treatment means by species. Results 
indicated that the increased abundance of Y. pestis in D. 
discoideum was significant compared with all other species 
at 48 h postinfection (p<0.001).
Discussion
We demonstrate that Y. pestis (CO-92) can survive and rep-
licate intracellularly within the social, heterogamous ameba

 Yersinia pestis in Potential Ameba Reservoir
D. discoideum, whereas Y. pestis is only transiently resis-
tant to 4 species of free-living and cyst-forming amebae 
(A. castellanii, A. lenticulata, A. polyphaga, and V. vermi-
formis). Relative to E. coli controls, Y. pestis demonstrated 
significantly increased survival and replication within ame-
bae despite the 4 cyst-forming amebae successfully killing 
the bacteria by using unidentified mechanisms.
Amebae cultured from soil in prairie dog colonies with 
active plague epizootics confirm that ameba species used 
in our experiments co-occur spatially and temporally with 
Y. pestis under natural conditions. Interactions between 
amebae and Y. pestis could select for increasingly ameba-
resistant phenotypes, considering the transient resistance 
already observed in 4 cyst-forming ameba species. Other 
research has demonstrated the potential for amebae to af-
fect pathogen transmission mode, alter virulence, and act as 
training grounds for intracellular pathogens by selecting for 
traits enabling macrophage invasion or avoidance (17,38).
Genus-level differences in ameba infection intensity 
and infection prevalence confirm that various ameba spe-
cies have greater reservoir potential than others. In accor-
dance with super-spreader theories, a minority of individu-
al ameba harboring atypically high numbers of intracellular 
bacteria may be disproportionately causative for pathogen 
maintenance and re-emergence.
We observed a shorter duration of survival for Y. pestis 
in A. castellanii compared with prior experiments (24 h vs. 
5 d in 13), likely from differing co-culture conditions and 
ameba strains. Incubation temperatures differed between 
this and prior experiments (28°C vs. 4°C and 25°C in 13). 
Many Y. pestis virulence factors are temperature regulated 
and may differentially facilitate cellular invasion, inhibition 
of the phagolysosomal pathway, and intracellular persis-
tence (1,17,38). Additionally, A. castellanii (ATCC 30234)

successive time point (24 and 48 hours) after the 1-hour antibiotic 
drug treatment (p = 0.01 and p = 0.002, respectively). After the 
4-hour antibiotic drug treatment in D. discoideum, the abundance 
of viable intracellular Y. pestis at 24 and 48 hours was significantly 
greater than at 4 hours (p = 0.008 and p = 0.001, respectively). 
The abundance of viable Y. pestis within D. discoideum at 48 
hours postinfection was not significantly different between the 
1-hour and 4-hour antibiotic drug treatments (p = 0.1624). Viable 
intracellular Y. pestis abundance was significantly greater in 
D. discoideum compared with all other species at 48 hours 
postinfection (p<0.001).
 RESEARCH
used in this study was originally derived from yeast cultures 
in London in 1930, whereas A. castellanii (ATCC 30010), 
used by Benavides-Montaño et al. (13), was originally 
 
isolated from California soil in 1957 and enabled longer 
intracellular survival of Y. pestis. Intracellular survival may 
be affected by traits acquired by co-evolution between ame-
bae and resistant bacteria in soil environments (17).
In macrophages, Y. pestis recruits host Rab1b protein 
to the phagosome, resulting in inhibition of phagosome 
acidification and disruption of the remaining phagolyso-
somal metabolic pathway (26,27,39–41). Y. pestis then 
establishes a replicative niche within the YCV, character-
ized by a tight-fitting vacuole that expands commensurately 
with bacterial replication (27). Examination of TEM micro-
graphs shows that intracellular bacteria are localized with-
in form-fitting vacuolar membranes, similar to the YCVs 
found in macrophages (Figure 4).
The successful intracellular survival of Y. pestis in 
D. discoideum for >48 h demonstrates that Y. pestis is an 
ameba-resistant bacterium. This classification supports 
the potential for D. discoideum or related ameba species 
to be environmental reservoirs of plague. Intracellular sur-
vival of the observed duration is consequential given that 
typical interactions between bacteria and phagocytic cells 
result in bacterial death in <40 min (27). Most phagocy-
tosed bacteria cannot survive digestive processes char-
acteristic of phagocytic cells including phagolysosome 
fusion and acidification, or the subsequent recruitment 
of endosomal lytic factors (26,27,41). Ongoing research 
assesses the maintenance of viable Y. pestis through the 
entire D. discoideum life cycle, including transmissible 
dormant spores.
Ameba-resistant pathogens often replicate in vacuoles 
before escaping into the cytosol or outside of the phago-
cytic cell entirely. In addition to viable intracellular per-
sistence, we observed active intracellular replication of Y. 
pestis (CO-92) in D. discoideum (Figure 5) and possible, 
but unconfirmed, replication of Y. pestis (CO92 pgm+, 
pCD1, pGFPuv, amp+) in A. castellanii (Figure 4A). Anal-
ysis of TEM micrographs proved inconclusive for identify-
ing the bacterial division septum; thus, only D. discoideum 
has conclusively demonstrated intracellular replication of 
Y. pestis. Y. pestis CFUs recovered from within D. discoi-
deum increased significantly (p = 0.001–0.01; Figure 5) in 
successive postinfection time points across both antibiotic 
treatment conditions (except in 1 instance where Y. pes-
tis increased nonsignificantly [p = 0.1624; Figure 5]). The 
consistent absence of extracellular bacteria in all D. discoi-
deum co-cultures indicates resistance to digestion and the 
exploitation of an intraameba replicative niche.
Intracellular replication of Y. pestis in macrophages 
occurs within YCVs, and the formation of YCVs requires 
metabolic pathway inhibition by recruitment of Rab1b 
GTPases. Orthologous mechanisms are likely the cause 
for observed Y. pestis replication and survival within 
amebae. We searched for macrophage Rab1b by using 
BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) against 
full genome sequences of each study ameba species and 
located homologous genetic sequences (99.8% similarity) 
within A. castellanii and D. discoideum (GenBank acces-
sion nos. XM_004347056.1 and XM_637217.1, respec-
tively [42,43]). Future research should attempt to establish 
whether these ameba sequences are functionally ortholo-
gous to those identified in macrophages and whether the 
presence of particular host GTPases is diagnostic of ameba 
permissiveness to intracellular bacteria.
Results of this study support the reservoir potential of 
environmental ameba but do not definitively prove that this 
mechanism occurs in situ. Further research is necessary to 
determine if the maximum duration of intraameba Y. pestis 
survival corresponds with the durations of cryptic interepi-
zootic persistence that are characteristic of plague dynamics. 
Increasing evidence for dormant or viable but noncultur-
able forms of Y. pestis may provide explanations underly-
ing hypothesized multiyear survival in ameba spores or cysts 
(12,25,44–46). Outcomes of this research prompt ques-
tions regarding evolutionary selection imposed by amebae 
on environmental pathogens and applications of the ameba 
reservoir model for other cryptic environmental pathogens. 
Further research into ameba-mediated pathogenesis and per-
sistence will offer practical insights for public health, conser-
vation, agricultural management, and biodefense.
In conclusion, the mechanisms underlying plague re-
emergence following dormancy have eluded researchers 
for centuries (1,11). Plague persistence within soilborne 
microorganisms has been hypothesized as an elusive 
maintenance mechanism (6,11,12,25). We demonstrated 
spatiotemporal co-occurrence of plague bacterium and 
various ameba species during an active plague epizootic. 
Further, we observed the persistence of viable and repli-
cative Y. pestis in D. discoideum amebae for ˃48 hours 
postinfection and persistence of Y. pestis in 4 cyst-form-
ing ameba species for <24 hours postinfection, where-
as ameba-susceptible control bacteria were eliminated 
by amebae in <1 hour. Thus, Y. pestis are respectively 
ameba-resistant and transiently ameba-resistant under 
the tested infection conditions. Y. pestis bacteria resided 
within ameba structures that were visually analogous to 
YCVs observed in infected macrophages. These results 
encourage research into the eco-evolutionary interac-
tions between pathogenic bacteria, amebae, and host 
immune factors. The reservoir potential of amebae and 
their shared infection-permissiveness with phagocytic 
macrophages show promise in explaining the cryptic 
properties underlying interepizootic plague transmission 
and persistence.
