IMPORTANCE Obesity is common in children and adolescents in the United States, is
associated with negative health effects, and increases the likelihood of obesity in adulthood.
OBJECTIVE Tosystematicallyreviewthebenefitsandharmsofscreeningandtreatmentforobesity

STUDY SELECTION English-language trials of benefits or harms of screening or treatment
(behavior-based, orlistat, metformin) for overweight or obesity in children aged 2 through 18
years, conducted in or recruited from health care settings.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and
full-text articles, then extracted data from fair- and good-quality trials. Random-effects
meta-analysis was used to estimate the benefits of lifestyle-based programs and metformin.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Weight or excess weight (eg, body mass index [BMI]; BMI
z score, measuring the number of standard deviations from the median BMI for age and sex),
cardiometabolic outcomes, quality of life, other health outcomes, harms.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Lifestyle-based weight loss interventions with 26 or more
hours of intervention contact are likely to help reduce excess weight in children and
adolescents. The clinical significance of the small benefit of medication use is unclear.

 D
ata from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey indicate that an estimated 17% of US 2- to
19-year-olds had obesity in 2011-2104,1 and 31.8% were
either overweight or had obesity in 2011-2012.2 These data repre-
sent substantial increases over the past 3 decades, although the
rate of obesity may be stabilizing overall. Excess adiposity in
childhood increases the risk of adult obesity, which is associated
with many health issues. In addition, obesity during childhood—
particularly severe obesity—is associated with problematic cardio-
metabolic measures such as high blood pressure, dyslipidemia,
and insulin resistance1-7 as well as asthma, obstructive sleep
apnea, orthopedic difficulties, early maturation, polycystic ovar-
ian syndrome, and hepatic steatosis.8
In 2010, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)
recommended that clinicians screen children 6 years and older
for obesity and offer them or refer them for comprehensive,
intensive behavioral interventions to improve weight status
(B recommendation).9 This review was undertaken to provide
current evidence to the USPSTF for an updated recommendation
on this topic.
Methods
Scope of Review
This systematic review addressed 5 key questions (KQs) about the
benefits and harms of screening and treatment for obesity in chil-
dren and adolescents in primary care or primary care–relevant set-
tings (Figure 1). Detailed methods are available in the full evidence
report available at https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org
/Page/Document/final-evidence-review151/obesity-in-children
-and-adolescents-screening1. Sub-KQs exploring the effect of
intervention components (KQ3a) and key patient subgroups
(KQ3b) on health outcomes had insufficient data and are presented
in the full report but are not discussed here. Similarly, a small group
of behavior-based trials that were not lifestyle-based interventions
designed to reduce excess weight (eg, maintenance-only trials and
those using psychotherapeutic approaches without emphasis on
lifestyle factors) are not discussed here.
Data Sources and Searches
In addition to evaluating all studies from the previous USPSTF
reviews11,12 and selected studies from other reviews identified
through an initial search for existing systematic reviews, we
searched for newly published literature in MEDLINE/PubMed,
PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials,
PsycINFO, and the Education Resources Information Center. For
screening studies we searched from January 1, 2005, through
January 22, 2016 (bridging from the 2005 USPSTF review11), and
for treatment studies we searched from January 1, 2010, through
January 22, 2016 (bridging from the 2010 USPSTF review12).
Reference lists of other relevant publications were also reviewed
to identify additional studies published in or after 1985. Since
January 2016, we continued to conduct ongoing surveillance
through article alerts and targeted searches of high-impact
journals to identify major studies published in the interim that
may affect the conclusions or understanding of the evidence
and therefore the related USPSTF recommendation. The last sur-
veillance was conducted on December 5, 2016, and identified no
relevant new studies. The search strategies are listed in the
eMethods in the Supplement.
To reduce the risk of reporting bias for trials of metformin and
orlistat, both the Drugs@FDA and ClinicalTrials.gov websites were
used. Drugs@FDA was searched for the drug approval package for
orlistat using the method described by Turner.13 We did not search
for the metformin drug approval package, because it is a generic
name and the Food and Drug Administration reviews for generics
are focused on bioequivalence rather than efficacy and safety.13
The package inserts were examined to review known harms and
adverse effects of both drugs. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched using
the terms “
orlistat”and “
metformin.”For study titles that appeared
relevant, the full records were reviewed by 2 investigators; studies
meeting eligibility criteria were matched with published articles
where possible. One study published results in ClinicalTrials.gov
without a subsequent journal publication,14 although correspon-
dence with study authors indicated that a manuscript submission
was expected.
Study Selection
Twoinvestigatorsindependentlyreviewed9491abstractsand464
full-text articles against inclusion and exclusion criteria (Figure 2).
Disagreements were resolved through discussion or consultation
with a third investigator.
Eligible studies were fair- or good-quality studies published in
English that were conducted in “
economically developed”coun-
tries according to membership in the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development.15 Randomized clinical trials
(RCTs) and nonrandomized controlled trials that examined the
benefits or harms of screening or weight management interven-
tions (counseling, metformin, orlistat, and health care system–
level approaches) among children and adolescents aged 2 to 18
years were included. In addition, large observational studies that
examined harms of metformin and orlistat in children or adoles-
cents were eligible; no such studies met the inclusion criteria.
Included trials had to be conducted in or recruited from health
care settings and have a primary aim of reducing excess weight
(through weight loss or limiting weight gain with growth in height)
or maintaining previous reductions in excess weight. Studies of
weight management interventions also could take place in tele-
phone, virtual, community, or research settings as long as there
was a connection to a health setting (eg, recruitment primarily from
a health care setting). We excluded studies conducted in settings
that were not generalizable to primary care, such as school class-
rooms or residential treatment facilities. We excluded studies with
components that would not be feasible for an outpatient health
care setting, such as interventions that provided most or all of the
participants’food or that included community-wide media or built
environment components.
Trials were required to target individuals meeting the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)16 or other simi-
lar criteria for overweight or obesity, those who had excess
weight previously and were engaged in weight maintenance, or
high-risk populations with a high proportion of youth with excess
weight. Therefore, studies were also included if at least half the
sample met the criteria for overweight or obesity and the study
targeted a population with elevated risk of obesity (eg, children

 with overweight parents; Hispanic, black, or American Indian/
Alaska Native ethnicity) or with obesity-related medical problems
(eg, type 2 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, hypertension, lipid
abnormalities). Studies were excluded if they were limited to
youth who had an eating disorder, who were pregnant or postpar-
tum, who were overweight or had obesity secondary to a medical
condition, who had an intellectual or developmental disability, or
who were in college.
Control groups of behavior-based interventions could include
usual care, no intervention, waitlist, attention control, or minimal
intervention (eg, pamphlets or 1 to 2 brief sessions with no more
than 60 minutes of total estimated direct contact). Pharmaco-
therapy trials had to include a placebo control. Trials that included
a concomitant lifestyle intervention were required to have the
same lifestyle intervention in both the pharmacotherapy and
the placebo groups.
Trials of screening or treatment benefit had to report at least
1 weight outcome. Other outcomes included health outcomes
(eg, reduced orthopedic pain, sleep apnea, or asthma; improved
quality of life, functioning, or depression; avoidance of adult obe-
sity), intermediate cardiometabolic outcomes (blood pressure,
lipid, insulin/glucose measures), and adverse effects of screening
or treatment (eg, labeling, stigma or increased body image con-
cerns, eating disorder, exercise-induced injury). Outcomes other

Evidence reviews for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) use an
analytic framework to visually display the key questions that the review will
address to allow the USPSTF to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a
preventive service. The questions are depicted by linkages that relate
interventions and outcomes. The dashed line indicates a relationship between
an intermediate outcome and a health outcome that is presumed to describe
the natural progression of the disease. Refer to USPSTF Procedure Manual for
further details.10 BMI indicates body mass index; CV, cardiovascular; KQ, key
question; QOL, quality of life.
a Blood pressure, lipid levels, and insulin resistance are secondary outcomes
when reported with weight.

 than harms had to be reported at a minimum of 6 months after
randomization; 12 months was the preferred outcome point.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Two investigators independently assessed the quality of the
included studies by using criteria defined by the USPSTF (eTable 1
in the Supplement).10 Each study was assigned a final quality rat-
ing of good, fair, or poor; disagreements among investigators
were resolved through discussion or consultation with a third
investigator. We excluded studies as poor quality if there was
a major flaw (eg, attrition >40%, differential attrition >20%)
or multiple important limitations that could invalidate the results,
such as noncomparable groups at baseline, differential reason
for dropout, imbalances on important variables due to dropout
or baseline differences that were not controlled for, problematic
measurement procedures, nonblinded allocation, and attrition
of 20% to 39%. One investigator abstracted data from the in-
cluded studies, and a second investigator checked data for accu-
racy. We abstracted study design details, population characteris-
tics, intervention characteristics, and outcomes.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
We created summary tables of study, population, and intervention
characteristics to examine the consistency, precision, and relation-
ship of effect size with key potential modifiers. Weight-related
measures at 12 months’follow-up were the primary outcome, with
a body mass index (BMI) z score or standard deviation score
selected as the primary outcome if available. We refer to either of
these measures as BMI z score, which is the number of standard
deviations the child’
s BMI differs from the median according to
norms such as those of the CDC16 or International Obesity Task
Force.17 We chose BMI z score as the preferred outcome because it
was the only widely available measure that could be used to com-
pare relative degree of excess weight across ages. The BMI z score
values associated with the 85th and 95th percentiles according to
CDC standards are 1.036 and 1.645, respectively. If BMI z score was

 not reported, BMI (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared), weight, waist circumference, or BMI per-
centile were used. The closest follow-up to 12 months was used
(range, 6-24 months).
Hours of contact were estimated based on the number of
planned treatment sessions and the length of each session. When
information on session length was not provided, assumptions
developed a priori were used to estimate contact hours, for
example, assigning phone sessions to be 15 minutes and “brief”
phone sessions to be 5 minutes. Interventions were grouped
by hours of contact (0 to 5 hours, 6 to 25 hours, 26 to 51 hours,
�52 hours). We carried forward the 26-hour cutoff from the previ-
ous review, which was comparable to weekly 1-hour sessions for 6
months. For this review we added 2 additional cutoffs post hoc
when heterogeneity in effect sizes remained high and appeared
related to contact hours. We selected the 52-hour cutoff to extend
the logic of weekly visits from 6 months up to 1 year and selected
the 6-hour cutoff because all trials with fewer than 6 hours of con-
tact involved only individual visits, while almost all (25/27) inter-
ventions above this cutoff included group sessions. For trials with
interventions that lasted longer than 12 months but that reported a
12-month outcome, estimated hours of contact in the first 12
months only are shown in the forest plots.
Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted using the
DerSimonian and Laird estimation method to examine group differ-
ences in change from baseline.18 Sensitivity analyses were con-
ducted using a restricted maximum likelihood model with the
Knapp-Hartung modification for small samples, which is a more
conservative approach when there is substantial statistical hetero-
geneity or the number of studies is small.19,20 When only 4 or 5
trials could be included in a meta-analysis, we attempted to use the
profile likelihood method21 for sensitivity analysis, but if this model
did not converge, the restricted maximum likelihood model results
were used. For the lifestyle-based weight loss trials, we analyzed
BMI z score, any weight measure, and, among trials with 52 or more
contact hours, cardiometabolic outcomes. When pooling any
weight measure, standardized mean differences in change
between groups were used. Because hours of contact appeared to
be a strong effect modifier, separate pooled estimates were gener-
ated for each level of contact hours. For metformin, separate meta-
analyses were conducted for BMI, BMI z score, and cardiometa-
bolic outcomes reported in at least 4 trials.21
The I2 statistic was used to assess statistical heterogeneity.22
Funnel plots and the Egger test were used to examine the risk of
small-study effects for the lifestyle-based weight loss trials, com-
bining trials across all levels of estimated contact hours (36 trials
had sufficient data to include in a funnel plot) (eFigure in the
Supplement). There were not sufficient data to perform these
analyses for other outcomes or for metformin trials.
Analyses were conducted in Stata version 13.1 (StataCorp). All

tistically significant at P � .05.

management with the aim of reducing excess weight in young
people (by weight loss or limiting further weight gain as the child
grows) and are referred to here as lifestyle-based weight loss
interventions.23,25,26,28-55,57-66 Other behavior-based approaches
were studied in 3 small trials that showed neither benefits nor
harms and are not discussed further.24,27,56

 Lifestyle-Based Weight Loss Trials
Most of the lifestyle-based weight loss trials were conducted in
a primary care (43%) or other health care (43%) setting; the others
involved health care–based recruitment, but the intervention
was outside of a health care setting. Eight trials were rated as
good quality,28,29,39,57-59,62,63 and the remaining were given a fair
rating. Mean baseline BMI z score values ranged from 0.94 to 4.3.
TheweightedmeanBMIzscorewas2.3,wellabovetheBMIzscore
value of 1.645 that corresponds to the 95th percentile for age and
sex according to CDC norms. The trials included children as young
as 2 years53,54,57 and up to 18 years32,38,40 or 19 years.41 The major-
ity of trials targeted elementary-aged children or both elementary
and adolescent ages.
The lifestyle-based weight loss interventions provided at
least dietary counseling and some information about behavior
change principles, and most also provided information related to
physical activity or sedentary behavior. All trials involved parents,
except 1 that targeted adolescents. The number of sessions
ranged from 1 to 122, and estimated contact hours ranged from
0.25 to 122 over 2.25 to 24 months. The interventions with higher
estimated contact hours included group meetings, with or with-
out separate individual family meetings. These group interven-
tions frequently involved separate groups for parents and chil-
dren as well as joint activities, and they often included supervised
physical activity sessions. These interventions typically incor-
porated behavior change techniques such as goal setting,
monitoring diet and activity behaviors, and problem solving.
The interventions with fewer than an estimated 6 contact hours
did not include group sessions. These interventions were fre-
quently conducted in primary care settings with the involvement
of the primary care physician, and several included motivational
interviewing–based counseling by the primary care physician or
another healthy lifestyle counselor.28,35,38,48,57,58,60,66
Weight management interventions above a threshold of 26
estimated contact hours were generally effective in reducing
excess weight in children and adolescents after 6 to 12 months,

 typically with absolute BMI z score reductions of 0.2 or more
compared with little or no reduction in control groups (Figure 4).
There was a general dose-response pattern, with greater contact
being associated with larger effects that were more likely statisti-
cally significant. However, across all levels of contact, children in
both groups showed a wide range of effects, as demonstrated by
large SDs relative to the mean change: some children in both
groups showed fairly large reductions in excess weight, some
showed no or modest changes, and some continued to gain
excess weight.
The 7 trials with an estimated 52 or more contact hours (over
6 to 12 months) all showed benefits of treatment,36,45-47,51,52,64
with a pooled standardized mean difference in change of −1.10
(95% CI, −1.30 to −0.89; 6 trials; I2 = 43.4%)45-47,51,52,64 over 6 to
12 months, among those with sufficient data to pool. Absolute
BMI z score reductions in the pooled intervention groups typically
ranged from 0.22 to 0.34, while control groups generally
reported small to moderate increases in BMI z score. The remain-
ing trial reported a statistically significant between-group differ-
ence in BMI z score of −0.15 (−0.16 in the intervention group vs
−0.01 in the control group).36 In terms of absolute change in
pounds, the range of mean weight change in intervention groups
was from +2.6 lb to −7.0 lb, while children in the control groups
typically gained a mean of 8 to 17 lb (among children with base-
line weights ranging from a mean of 112 to 203 lb). However, 6 of
these 7 trials reported results only immediately after the inter-
vention ended, when the effect was likely at its largest.
The 9 interventions with an estimated 26 to 51 contact hours
(over 2.25 to 12 or more months)26,29,33,34,42,49,53,54,61 generally
showed smaller effects than trials with contact hours estimated
at 52 or more, with a pooled standardized mean difference in
change of −0.34 (95% CI, −0.52 to −0.16; 9 trials; I2 = 24%)
(Figure 4) over 6 to 12 months. Change in BMI z score in the 7
of these studies reporting BMI z scores ranged from −0.11
(SD, 0.16)26 to −0.59 (SD, 0.75)53 in the intervention groups,
whereas the control groups generally showed mean reductions of
0.10 or less. Absolute weight changes were highly variable, but
typically intervention groups showed mean 1- to 5-lb weight gains
compared with mean 5- to 10-lb gains in control groups (with
baseline mean weights ranging from 58 to 190 lb). Seven of the 9
demonstrated statistically significant group differences based on
either study-reported analyses or calculations using reported
means and SDs.29,34,42,49,53,54,61 Five of these trials reported
results from 3.75 to 9 months after the last treatment session,
and all 5 demonstrated a statistically significant benefit of treat-
ment, suggesting some degree of postcontact maintenance of
weight benefit.29,42,49,53,54
Only 4 of the 26 interventions with fewer than an estimated
26 hours of contact over 3 to 24 months showed statistically sig-
nificant benefits (based on either study-reported analyses or cal-
culations using reported means and SDs) at 6- to 12-month
follow-up,28,48,50,55 and the standardized effect sizes were
usually small, generally reflecting absolute BMI z score reductions
of 0.10 or less in the intervention groups. Pooled effects for
the 21 trials that provided sufficient information to be included
in the meta-analysis are shown in Figure 4, with separate re-
sults for those with an estimated 6 to 25 hours and fewer than
6 hours. Two of the 4 lower-intensity interventions that showed
a benefit of treatment targeted children who were overweight
but did not have obesity.28,55 However, even though results were
statistically significant in only 4 trials, the intervention group chil-
dren showed statistically nonsignificantly greater mean re-
ductions in excess weight than control group children in 21 of
these 24 trials.
Four of the included trials reported outcomes at 18 to
24 months in addition to 12-month outcomes, allowing explora-
tion of longer-term trajectories.28,33,45,59 With estimated con-
tact hours ranging from 1 to 78, beneficial effects were fully
maintained (or improved on) at 24 months in 2 trials, with esti-
mated contact hours of 6 (over 24 months)59 and 78 (over 12
months).45 In the highest-contact trial, there was a BMI z score
difference between groups of −0.30 at both 12- and 24-month
assessments, when the intervention had ended at 12 months.
However, group differences were attenuated at longer-term
follow-up in the other 2 trials.
Metformin
One good-quality69 and 7 fair-quality67-74 trials (n = 616) com-
pared the use of metformin for weight loss with a placebo pill.
None of these trials was conducted in primary care; all were con-
ducted in pediatric obesity or endocrine clinics or other types of
clinical research settings. Included ages were 6 to 19 years.
Participants in metformin trials had a higher BMI than
those in behavior-based interventions, with a weighted mean
baseline BMI of 36.0. Six of the 8 metformin trials required
abnormalities of insulin or glucose metabolism, such as
hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, or impaired glucose
tolerance67,69-73; 1 trial explicitly excluded participants with
elevated levels of fasting or 2-hour glucose or hemoglobin
A1c (HbA1c).74 One metformin trial restricted inclusion to par-
ticipants with a previous unsuccessful lifestyle intervention,
defined as BMI change less than 2 points over 6 months and per-
sistent insulin resistance.67
The total daily metformin dose ranged from 1 to 2 g.68
The lowest adherence rate occurred in a trial reporting that 60%
of the metformin group and 75% of the control group filled
4 prescriptions over 6 months, equating to a maximum dose
for 2 months.70 Adherence was greatest in a trial in which 93.2%
of pills were taken in the metformin group and 92.2% in the pla-
cebo group.69 All but 1 of the metformin trials73 also provided
a concomitant counseling intervention to all participants. The
estimated number of contact hours was highly variable, ranging
from 15 minutes to 86 hours. Two trials provided physical
activity sessions.67,74
Metformin was associated with a small but statistically signifi-
cant reduction in weight, with minimal statistical heterogeneity in
trials of 6 to 12 months’duration. In pooled analyses, metformin
was associated with a lower BMI z score (−0.10 [95% CI, −0.17 to
−0.03]; 6 trials; I2 = 13.1%) and lower BMI (−0.86 [95% CI, −1.44
to −0.29]; 6 trials; I2 = 0%) (Figure 5). Results were almost identi-
cal when using the more conservative profile likelihood pooling
method to account for the small number of trials being pooled:
BMI z score weighted mean difference (WMD), −0.10 (95% CI,
−0.19 to −0.04); BMI weighted mean difference, −0.86 (95% CI,
−1.45 to −0.28). Results of trials that could not be pooled were
generally consistent with pooled results.70,72,73

 When individual trials adjusted for characteristics such as
baseline weight, age, sex, or race/ethnicity, several trials became
statistically significant, which was not reflected in the unadjusted
analyses.68,69,71 The trial with the most intensive concomitant
lifestyle therapy, with an estimated 86 contact hours, showed
a statistically nonsignificant net difference in BMI z score between
the intervention and placebo groups at 12 months (−0.22
[95% CI, −0.46 to 0.02]).74 Despite the intensive lifestyle inter-
vention in both groups, mean BMI z score increased by 0.05
(SD, 0.40) in the placebo group; BMI z score decreased by
0.17 for participants taking metformin. The estimated weight
change for this study, based on baseline BMI and assuming
the median height for age, amounted to a mean reduction of
3.1 lb with metformin compared with 1.4 lb with placebo. This
was the largest reduction in BMI z score of all included metformin
interventions; the remaining interventions showed reductions
of 0.12 lb or less, generally compared with extremely small re-
ductions or BMI z score increases in the placebo groups.
Across all metformin trials, mean weight change ranged from
a 5-lb reduction to a 5-lb weight gain with metformin, and from a
2-lb reduction to an 11-lb weight gain with placebo. Baseline mean
weight ranged from 168 to 239 lb. Despite differences in metfor-
min dose and concomitant therapy between trials, statistical
heterogeneity was very low, and dose did not appear to modify
the weight effect of metformin. Limited data were available about
the persistence of metformin effect after discontinuation.
Orlistat
Three fair-quality trials (n = 779) examined the use of orlistat
(360 mg/d) for weight loss compared with a placebo pill over 6 to
12 months; trials were collectively limited to adolescents aged 12
to 18 years.14,75,76 The baseline weighted mean BMI across the 3
orlistat studies was 37.4. One orlistat study required the presence
of 1 or more obesity-related comorbidities (including type 2
diabetes),14 but the other 2 had no health-related requirements
beyond excess weight. Concomitant counseling interventions
ranged from an estimated 3.5 to 15 hours of contact. Adherence
to orlistat based on pill counts was 72% to 73% in 1 trial75 and
greater than 80% in another trial76; the third trial did not report
adherence level.14
Orlistat trials reported small between-group BMI differences
ranging from −0.94 (95% CI, −1.58 to −0.30) to −0.50 (95% CI,
−7.62 to 6.62) (Table 1).14,75,76 Over 6 to 12 months, mean BMI
change with orlistat ranged from −1.44 (SD, 2.6) to −0.55 (SD not
reported), whereas control groups had BMI changes ranging from
−0.8 (SD, 13.4) to 0.31 (SD not reported). In terms of absolute
weight, mean changes ranged from 1-lb weight gain to 12-lb
weight loss with orlistat, compared with 7-lb weight gain to 4-lb
weight loss, with very wide variability within studies. Youth in
these trials had baseline mean weights of 215 and 244 lb in the 2
studies reporting baseline weight. BMI reduction was statistically
significant in the 2 larger trials (n = 539 and n = 200)14,75 but not
in the smallest trial (n = 40).76 Only 1 trial reported change in BMI
z score, which was a reduction of 0.12 (SD, 0.2) with the use of
orlistat compared with a reduction of 0.06 (SD, 0.2) in the pla-
cebo group over 6 months (P = .007).

 Lifestyle-Based Interventions
The interventions offering an estimated 52 or more hours of con-
tact showed fairly consistent improvements in blood pressure
(systolic blood pressure [SBP] pooled mean difference in change
between groups, −6.4 mm Hg [95% CI, −8.6 to −4.2]; 6 trials;
I2 = 51.3%; diastolic blood pressure [DBP] pooled mean differ-
ence in change between groups, −4.0 mm Hg [95% CI, −5.6 to
−2.5]; 6 trials; I2 = 17.3%) but no statistically significant improve-
ment for lipids (Table 2). Some improvements in insulin and glu-
cose measures other than fasting plasma glucose (homeostatic
model assessment, 2-hour oral glucose test, insulin levels) were
found in individual trials. Neither the individual trials nor the
pooled estimate for fasting plasma glucose showed any benefit.
Fasting plasma glucose was the only insulin or glucose measure
with sufficient data to pool. Cardiometabolic outcomes were
sparsely reported in trials of less intensive interventions and
were generally not associated with improvements in blood pres-
sure, lipid levels, or insulin or glucose levels.
Metformin
Four of 5 trials reporting fasting glucose values reported a small or
no decrease in fasting glucose level with the use of metformin
(ranging from −1.6 to 0.6 mg/dL [to convert glucose values to
mmol/L, multiply by 0.0555]) and small increases with placebo
(ranging from 0.2 to 3.5 mg/dL) (Figure 6). Pooled analyses
showed a between-group difference in fasting glucose levels of
−3.7 mg/dL with wide confidence intervals (95% CI, −9.9 to 2.5; 5
trials; I2 = 64.0%; Table 3). One outlier study showed a statistically
significant difference of −17.9 mg/dL (95% CI, −27.9 to −7.9)
between the metformin and placebo groups.73 This small, fair-
quality study without lifestyle modification components also exhib-
ited the largest metformin effect on BMI z score; however, this trial

baseline and questionable fasting glucose balance between groups
that were not adjusted for. Between-group change in fasting
glucose levels in other studies was small and generally statistically
nonsignificant (range, −0.90 to −4.35 mg/dL).67,69,71,72,74 This pat-
tern of results was similar for other glucose- and insulin-related

 Components of Efficacious Interventions
Key Question 4b. Are there common components of efficacious
interventions?
For lifestyle-based weight loss trials, the relationship between
weight outcomes and a number of intervention-related variables
were explored, including estimated hours of contact; number
of sessions; intervention duration; whether group, individual, or
supervised physical activity sessions were offered; and whether
sessions were offered to children with or without parents present.
Estimated contact hours and number of sessions were the only
intervention components associated with effect size (P < .001
in both cases).
Efficacy of Interventions by Patient Subgroups
Key Question 4c. Does efficacy differ by key patient subgroups
(ie, age, race/ethnicity, sex, degree of excess weight, and socioeco-
nomic status)?
Across all interventions, subgroup analysis of the prespecified
subpopulations of interest (ie, age, race/ethnicity, sex, degree
ofexcessweight,socioeconomicstatus)wassparse,sothatnocon-
clusions could be drawn about differential effectiveness on weight
outcomes.Analysesweregenerallylimitedbysmallstudysizesand
the absence of statistical interaction testing.
Harms of Interventions
KeyQuestion5.Doweightmanagementinterventionsforchildren
and adolescents have adverse effects?
Lifestyle-Based Interventions
Three of the lifestyle-based weight loss intervention trials
reported no adverse events in the intervention group,26,47,49 and
2 additional trials (published in the same article) reported that
there were no serious adverse events.44 Five trials similarly found
no group differences on measures of disordered eating or body
dissatisfaction.29,39,50,62,63
Metformin
We included 3 trials reporting harms in addition to the trials in-
cluded for benefits of treatment.77-79 The 3 trials had follow-up of
lessthan6months,sotheywerenotincludedwithbenefitsoftreat-
ment. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were common but not seri-
ousinparticipantstakingmetformin.Adverseeffectswerealsofre-
quentlyreportedbythosereceivingplacebo.Forexample,vomiting
was reported by 15% and 42% of those taking metformin in 2 trials
and by 3% and 21% of control group participants.68,69 Discontinu-
ations due to adverse effects, however, were relatively rare (<5%)
and occurred in relatively similar proportions between groups. Re-
portingtrialsgenerallyshowednodifferencesinliverorkidneyfunc-
tion,andtherewerenoreportedcasesoflacticacidosis.68,69,71-73,78,79
None of the trials reported on hypoglycemia.
Orlistat
Gastrointestinal adverse effects were very common among pa-
tients taking orlistat. For example, abdominal pain or cramps were
reported by 16% to 65% of participants taking orlistat and by 11%
to 26% of those taking a placebo. Flatus with discharge was re-
portedby20%to43%ofthosetakingorlistatand3%to11%ofthose

ing placebo.75,76 Nevertheless, discontinuations due to adverse ef-
fectswererelativelyrare(<5%)butabouttwiceascommonamong

Discussion
ThesummaryofevidenceforthisreviewisshowninTable4.There
was no direct evidence on the benefits or harms of screening chil-
dren and adolescents for excess weight, but a fairly large and re-
centbodyofevidencesuggeststhatlifestyle-basedweightlosspro-
grams with at least 26 hours of contact are likely to promote
reductions in excess weight in children and adolescents. The litera-
turealsorevealednoevidenceoftheseprogramscausingharm.Rela-
tive reductions in BMI z score of 0.20 or more were typical, but the
absolute amount of weight loss was highly variable within studies,
suggesting a wide possible range of benefit. Those with the most
contact hours also demonstrated approximately 6–mm Hg reduc-
tionsinSBPrelativetothecontrolgroups,smallerreductionsinDBP,
and some improvement in insulin and glucose measures, but typi-
cally no improvements in levels of fasting plasma glucose or lipids.
Behavior-based interventions with fewer estimated hours of con-
tact rarely demonstrated benefit, although limited evidence sug-
gested that briefer interventions may be effective in children who
areoverweightbutwhodonothaveobesity.Estimatedhoursofcon-
tact was the only characteristic clearly related to effect size, with
larger effects seen in trials with more contact hours.

withabnormalitiesofinsulinorglucosemetabolism,mostofwhom

for metformin and even smaller for orlistat, with only 3 trials.
The clinical importance of these changes in weight is difficult
to determine. A German expert panel considered a BMI z score
reduction of 0.2 to be associated with clinically significant
improvement,80 but the current review found no data to support
any particular cutoff. Several small prospective studies of children

in cardiometabolic risk factors, starting with BMI z score reduc-
tions of 0.125 to 0.50. However, there was no clear or consistent
threshold for benefit. Similarly, a study showing greater improve-
ment in insulin sensitivity with an 8% reduction in BMI did not pro-
vide data showing that this level of BMI change is an important
threshold (eg, compared with 6% or 10%) or whether the amount
of improvement in insulin sensitivity reported was clinically
important.84 Analysis of participants who completed a short-term,

11 trials reported generally small statistically nonsignificant
relative increases in health-related QOL or functioning scores,
using a variety of specific measures, except for 1 trial in young
children that reported improved physical functioning with a
larger effect size. High variability in effects suggests a wide
range of benefit to individuals within trials. In addition,
5 trials each reported self-esteem and body satisfaction, with
most finding no group differences. One trial reported no
differences in percentage screening positive for depression.
Consistency: QOL or functioning
results reasonably consistent.
Other outcomes either inconsistent
or had insufficient data to rate
consistency.
Precision: QOL or functioning
results imprecise, primarily owing
to confidence intervals that
straddle 1.0 and a wide variety of
specific measures. Other outcomes
imprecise owing to inconsistency or
insufficient data to rate precision
for other outcomes.
Wide variety of measures and
specific outcomes reported, raising
concerns about reporting bias.
However, since most results were
not statistically significant, this
concern is mitigated.

high variability in effects, suggesting a wide range of benefit
to individuals within trials.
In trials with ≥52 h of estimated contact, improvements were
seen in SBP (−6.4 [95% CI, −8.6 to −4.2] mm Hg) and DBP
(−4.0 [95% CI, −5.6 to −2.5] mm Hg) and some insulin or
glucose measures in some trials, but benefits were rare and
cardiometabolic outcomes were sparsely reported in trials of
lower-contact interventions.
Consistency: reasonably consistent
for weight outcomes, reasonably
consistent for blood pressure and
lipids, inconsistent for
insulin/glucose measures
Precision: imprecise
No evidence of reporting bias was
identified, but many included trials
limited by small sample sizes (n <40
per treatment group) and fairly
high (2%-40%) attrition. Sixteen
trials were excluded for poor
quality. For cardiometabolic
outcomes, reporting bias was not
apparent because most of the
highest-contact trials reported
these outcomes. Reporting was
sparest in trials with fewer than
52 h of contact, in which benefits
were rarely found.
Fair to good
(8 good, 34 fair)
Almost half of the trials were
conducted in the United States,
and more than one-third were
conducted in primary care settings,
but trials with the most contact
hours and largest effects were not
conducted in primary care. Access
to similar programs is likely limited.
Metformin
8 (RCTs)
n = 616
Metformin was associated with a small, statistically significant
weight reduction with very low statistical heterogeneity,
despite differences in dose and background therapy. In pooled
analyses, metformin reduced BMI z score by −0.10 (95% CI,
−0.17 to −0.03; 6 studies; I2 = 13.1) and BMI by −0.86 (95%
CI, −1.44 to −0.29a; 6 studies; I2 = 0) vs placebo over 6 to
12 mo. Results of trials that could not be pooled were
generally consistent with pooled results. Metformin was
associated with no statistically significant benefit for fasting
glucose, lipid, or blood pressure outcomes.
Consistency: Reasonably consistent
Precision: imprecise
Small studies with wide CIs
Short trials, primarily of
6-mo duration
Limited data about persistence of
effect after discontinuation
Fair (1 good,

Seventy-five percent of trials
required abnormalities of insulin or

Orlistat was associated with small between-group reductions
in BMI ranging from −0.94 (95% CI, −1.58 to −0.30) to
−0.50 (95% CI, −7.62 to 6.62)a and weight ranging from
−3.90 (−25.54 to 17.74) to −2.61 (95% CI not reported,
P < .001) kg over 6 to 12 mo. The 1 trial reporting BMI
z score showed a between-group difference of −0.06 (95% CI,
−0.12 to 0.00) favoring orlistat. Where reported, changes in
cardiometabolic risk factors were generally statistically
nonsignificant, except for DBP reduction in a large trial
(mean between-group difference, −1.81 mm Hg
[CI not reported], P = .04).

Lifestyle-based
weight loss
interventions
42 (3 CCTs,
39 RCTs)
n = 6956
Hours of contact was the only treatment characteristic clearly
associated with effect size. Most successful interventions took
place outside of the primary care setting, targeted both the
parent and child, provided didactic information, helped
parents and children engage in stimulus control (eg, limiting
access to tempting foods, limiting screening time), identified
or helped participants identify specific goals, encouraged
self-monitoring and problem-solving to help achieve the
goals, and included supervised physical activity sessions.

were more or less effective in subpopulations defined
by age, race/ethnicity, sex, degree of excess weight,
or socioeconomic status.

mal levels of these measures.85 Setting aside the issue of degree of
excess weight needed to improve cardiometabolic health, in many
trialschildreninthecontrolgroupsweremorelikelytocontinuegain-
ingexcessweight,incontrasttochildrenintheinterventiongroups.
Arresting the gain in excess weight likely constitutes a clinically im-
portant benefit for many of the interventions.
The results of this review are consistent with a recent review
commissioned by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health
Care, which included a different but overlapping body of evidence,
including trials with no connection to a health care setting and lim-
iting evidence to RCTs.86 They found that behavioral weight man-
agement interventions were associated with a small but robust
mean reduction in BMI (pooled mean difference, −1.15 [95% CI,
−1.59 to −0.72]) as well as small improvements in blood pressure
(SBP pooled mean difference, −4.64 [95% CI, −7.46 to −1.82]; DBP
pooled mean difference, −4.08 [95% CI, −6.07 to −2.09]) and qual-
ity of life (pooled mean difference, 2.05 [95% CI, −0.31 to 4.40],
based on instruments with possible ranges of 0 to 100 and 0 to
37). Those pooled effect sizes were entirely consistent with the
findings of the current review. Differences in BMI change in the cur-
rent review were typically greater than 1.0 for interventions with
26 or more hours of contact and most commonly less than 1.0 for
those with fewer hours of contact. Other reviews have reported
similar favorable effects of lifestyle-based weight management
interventions, particularly comprehensive programs involving par-
ents and at least a moderate level of intervention intensity.87-89
For metformin, the results for BMI change were generally simi-
lar to but smaller in magnitude than those reported in a recent sys-
tematic review that showed a pooled BMI reduction of −1.16 (95%
CI, −1.60 to −0.73).90 That review included trials that the current
review excluded based on duration,77-79 setting,91 no use of a pla-
cebo pill in control groups,92,93 quality,94 and study aim other than
weight loss.95 It nevertheless reached similar conclusions: that the
magnitude of BMI change was small compared with the reductions
needed for long-term health benefits.90
Limitations
We identified several limitations to the evidence base, including no
evidence related to the benefits or harms of screening for obesity.
Inthetrialsoftreatmentforexcessweight,limitationsincludedmini-
mal follow-up beyond 12 months, many studies with small num-
bers of participants, methodologic limitations, and sparse report-
ing of health outcomes. Given the propensity for people to regain
lost weight, the lack of long-term follow-up is a serious limitation.
In addition, it was difficult to interpret average effects in the pres-
ence of high within-study variability in results. Results rarely al-
lowed determining the proportion of children falling below obesity
and overweight thresholds after participating in the interventions.
The degree to which control group children independently sought
outandparticipatedinformalweightmanagementprogramsisun-
known but could attenuate the apparent benefit of the interven-
tion. In addition, heterogeneity in population, study, and interven-
tion characteristics, along with inconsistent reporting, precluded
assessing how most of these characteristics affected the study re-
sults. The evidence base for pharmacologic studies was small, and
one of the orlistat trials has not yet been published in a peer-
reviewed journal. Most pharmacotherapy trials followed up chil-
dren for only 6 months, and only 1 trial had planned follow-up after
the medication was discontinued.
Therewasarelationshipbetweenestimatedhoursofinterven-
tioncontactandeffectsize,althoughtheestimateofcontacthours
was imperfect. First, not all studies reported a detailed description
that included hours of contact, so session duration had to be esti-
mated in many cases. Planned hours of intervention were esti-
mated, but generally there was no access to actual hours received
by participants. In addition, the continuous variable for estimated
contact hours was divided into categories post hoc on the basis of
maintainingmethodsofthepreviousreview,extendingsimilarlogic,
andthedistributionalpropertiesoftheincludedstudiesratherthan
oncleardifferencesineffectivenessatspecificcutpoints.Thus,itis
notapparentthata25-hourinterventionwouldbesubstantiallyless
effective than a 26-hour intervention.
Some bodies of literature not included in this review may pro-
vide relevant information. We limited the review to trials in which
either the intervention or recruitment occurred in a health care set-
ting, thereby increasing applicability to primary care, but interven-
tions in some of the excluded studies were likely very similar to
those in the included studies and at least somewhat applicable. In
addition, multilevel trials, such as those that involve school- and
community-level interventions as well as individually targeted
interventions, may have included components in health care set-
tings that were very similar to interventions in the included trials
but that were not included because of the presence of other non–
health care components. These trials might highlight the ability of
health care–based interventions to potentiate other initiatives.
Also, this review did not include a systematic search for observa-
tional evidence of harms of behavior-based interventions, although
these interventions are unlikely to cause serious harms. In addition,
the review did not include comparative effectiveness studies,
which might have enabled better identification of specific compo-
nents associated with effectiveness.
Conclusions
Lifestyle-based weight loss interventions with 26 or more hours of
intervention contact are likely to help reduce excess weight in chil-
dren and adolescents. The clinical significance of the small benefit
of medication use is unclear.
