Introduction
Achondroplasia (ACH) is the most common form of dwarfism, 
which occurs with an estimated prevalence of between 1/16,000 
and 1/25,000 live births (1, 2). ACH patients are characterized 
by disproportionate short stature, with a long trunk deformed 
by excessive lordosis. The head is large with frontal bossing and 
the midface is hypoplastic (2). ACH is an autosomal-dominant 
disorder, and patients with ACH have been found to have a gain-
of-function mutation (p.Gly380Arg) localized in the transmem-
brane domain of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), 
a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family (3, 4). The FGFR3 
mutation disturbs the balance of proliferation and differentia-
tion in the growth plate. Several papers reported both decreased 
and increased proliferation related to stage-specific development 
(5–8). Chondrocyte differentiation is also impaired (9, 10) and 
seems to be controlled by SRY-box 9 (Sox9) expression in the 
growth plate (11). The ACH mutation activates the tyrosine kinase 
activity of the receptor and facilitates the transautophosphoryla-
tion of key tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain and acti-
vates mainly the downstream canonical MAP pathway. Other 
signaling pathways have been implicated in addition in ACH, e.g., 
STAT, Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K/AKT, and PLCγ pathways (9, 12, 13).
Potential therapeutic strategies have emerged for ACH over 
the last 5 years; these have aimed at reducing excessive activa-
tion of FGFR3 and its signaling pathways to stimulate linear bone 
growth. Our group conducted preclinical studies on a C-natriuret-
ic peptide (CNP) analog (14), BMN111, and we showed that this 
treatment led to a substantial improvement of skeletal parameters 
in the Fgfr3Y367C/+ mouse, which is a preclinical model of ACH (15). 
BMN111 (vosoritide) is currently in a (phase 2) clinical trial in pedi-
atric patients with ACH (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02055157). Other 
preclinical studies using different strategies and various com-
pounds, such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) (16), soluble FGFR3 
(17), statin (18), and meclozine (19), reported changes in the dwarf 
Fgfr3ach mouse phenotype (7). For most of these strategies, the 
mechanism of action in the growth plate needs to be elucidated. 
However, the most direct therapeutic strategy would be to coun-
teract the hyperactivity of FGFR3 using a tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(TKI). NVP-BGJ398 was identified as a panspecific FGFR inhibi-
tor that was equally active against FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 and 
less active against FGFR4 (20). Recently, cell-free kinase assays 
showed that NVP-BGJ398 was more selective for FGFR3 than the 
other FGFRs (21). This TKI is effective in reducing FGFR3 acti-
vation and has been used in preclinical murine models for the 
treatment of several FGFR-related pathological conditions, such 
as hypophosphatemic rickets (22), malignant rhabdoid tumors 
(23), and hepatocellular carcinoma (24). We therefore decided 
to investigate whether NVP-BGJ398 could penetrate into the car-
Achondroplasia (ACH) is the most frequent form of dwarfism and is caused by gain-of-function mutations in the fibroblast 
growth factor receptor 3–encoding (FGFR3-encoding) gene. Although potential therapeutic strategies for ACH, which aim to 
reduce excessive FGFR3 activation, have emerged over many years, the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) to counteract 
FGFR3 hyperactivity has yet to be evaluated. Here, we have reported that the pan-FGFR TKI, NVP-BGJ398, reduces FGFR3 
phosphorylation and corrects the abnormal femoral growth plate and calvaria in organ cultures from embryos of the 
Fgfr3Y367C/+ mouse model of ACH. Moreover, we demonstrated that a low dose of NVP-BGJ398, injected subcutaneously, 
was able to penetrate into the growth plate of Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice and modify its organization. Improvements to the axial and 
appendicular skeletons were noticeable after 10 days of treatment and were more extensive after 15 days of treatment that 
started from postnatal day 1. Low-dose NVP-BGJ398 treatment reduced intervertebral disc defects of lumbar vertebrae, loss 
of synchondroses, and foramen-magnum shape anomalies. NVP-BGJ398 inhibited FGFR3 downstream signaling pathways, 
including MAPK, SOX9, STAT1, and PLCγ, in the growth plates of Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice and in cultured chondrocyte models of ACH. 
Together, our data demonstrate that NVP-BGJ398 corrects pathological hallmarks of ACH and support TKIs as a potential 
therapeutic approach for ACH.

with WT femurs, +43.6% compared with untreated Fgfr3Y367C/+ 
femurs). These data show that the induced femoral elongation by 
NVP-BGJ398 was dose dependent, confirming the role of FGFR3 
as a negative regulator of bone growth (5).
In Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice, the coordinated proliferation and differen-
tiation of chondrocytes that ensure the continuous elongation of 
the growth plate are defective (29). We observed that in Fgfr3Y367C/+ 
explants cultured for 6 days, chondrocyte proliferation (i.e., Ki67 
expression) was increased (7 times more than WT) as previously 
reported (ref. 26 and Figure 1, D and E). NVP-BGJ398 significantly 
reduced chondrocyte proliferation at 100 nM (–56.4% compared 
with untreated). Differentiated chondrocytes in the growth plate 
were assessed using an antibody against collagen X (Col X), and 
we observed that the growth-plate hypertrophic zone was reduced 
in Fgfr3Y367C/+ explants (–58.4% compared with WT) as previously 
reported (refs. 15, 30, and Figure 1, D and F). The area of the hyper-
trophic zone was increased (+167.6%) with NVP-BGJ398 treatment 
compared with vehicle alone, indicating that the defective differ-
entiation of the chondrocytes was ameliorated (Figure 1, D and F).
To analyze the membranous ossification defect in the 
Fgfr3Y367C/+ skull vault, we used ex vivo cultures of embryonic 
mouse calvaria. Previously, we reported a calvarial defect in ACH 
and Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice, indicating a role of FGFR3 in skull bone 
growth (28). This defect gradually disappears during skull growth, 
as it does in mouse calvaria cultures. We observed that the cal-
varial defect, corresponding to a bone ossification delay, resolved 
faster and more completely in NVP-BGJ398–treated cultures (100 
nM) compared with untreated Fgfr3Y367C/+ calvaria from culture day 
4 (+20.1%) to culture day 14 (+46.1%) (Figure 2, A and B). These 
data confirm that the calvaria-formation defect is directly related 
to the overactivation of FGFR3.
Together, these results indicate that in ex vivo bone models of 
ACH, NVP-BGJ398 can rescue chondrocyte proliferation and dif-
ferentiation defects and can reduce the bone-growth anomalies of 
the growth plate and the skull vault, thus modifying both chondro-
genesis and osteogenesis during embryonic bone development.
NVP-BGJ398 improves growth of the appendicular skeleton in 
Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice. On the basis of those encouraging in vitro and 
ex vivo data, we treated Fgfr3Y367C/+ newborn mice (P1) daily with 
subcutaneous injections of NVP-BGJ398 (2 mg per kg body weight 
per day) for 15 days (protocol 1). The Fgfr3Y367C/+ mouse phenotype 
mimics human ACH in several respects; short stature, macroceph-
aly, prognatism, fused synchondroses, and foramen magnum (FM) 
stenosis (28, 29). Our objective was to evaluate whether and how 
NVP-BGJ398 inhibition of the overactivity of FGFR3 would affect 
bone growth in vivo. The treatment was well tolerated by Fgfr3Y367C/+ 
and Fgfr3+/+ mice without noticeable modification of behavior.
X-ray analyses of the forelimbs (Figure 3A) and hind limbs 
(Figure 3B) showed in NVP-BGJ398–treated Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice a 
tilage and bone and improve the skeletal phenotype in ACH via 
its inhibitory action on FGFR3 and downstream signaling path-
ways. In our study, NVP-BGJ398 inhibited the hyperactivity of 
FGFR3 and the canonical MAPK in ACH human cartilage cells. 
NVP-BGJ398 rescued the anomalies of fetal calvaria and femur in 
organ cultures of tissue taken from the Fgfr3Y367C/+ mouse model of 
ACH. Moreover, NVP-BGJ398 treatment of Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice was 
able to correct the dwarf phenotype. The reduction in the activ-
ity of FGFR3 improved all pathological hallmarks of ACH in long 
bones, skull base, calvaria, intervertebral disc (IVD), and verte-
brae. The timing and type of the treatment were 2 important cri-
teria for the improvement of bone growth in Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice. At 
cellular and tissue levels, chondrocyte proliferation was restored, 
as demonstrated by STAT pathway downregulation, and chondro-
cyte differentiation was improved, as demonstrated by SOX9 and 
MAPK downregulation. Our data suggest that TKIs may represent 
a pharmacological approach for the treatment of FGFR3 hyperac-
tivation-related disorders.
Results
NVP-BGJ398 inhibits FGFR3 phosphorylation. We evaluated the 
ability of NVP-BGJ398 to inhibit FGFR3 phosphorylation in tran-
siently transfected human control chondrocyte lines (Figure 1A) 
and HEK293-Vnr cells (Figure 1B). Cells were transfected with 
constructs expressing FGFR3WT and FGFR3 gain-of-function 
mutations localized in different domains of FGFR3 responsible for 
chondrodysplasias (FGFR3G380R [transmembrane domain; ACH], 
FGFR3Y373C [extracellular domain; thanatophoric dysplasia type 
1 [TDI], FGFR3K650E intracellular domain; thanatophoric dyspla-
sia type 2 [TDII]) (25, 26). Twenty-four hours after transfection, 
phosphorylated FGFR3 was detected for each mutant (Figure 1, A 
and B). For all transfected cells expressing FGFR3 with activating 
mutations, NVP-BGJ398 reduced FGFR3 phosphorylation (Figure 
1, A and B). No phosphorylated FGFR3WT was detected in HEK293-
Vnr cells (Figure 1B).
NVP-BGJ398 restores bone growth in Fgfr3Y367C/+ embryonic 
femurs. In ACH, FGFR3-activating mutations disturb endochon-
dral and membranous ossifications (27, 28). Our in vitro findings 
therefore prompted us to test the impact of NVP-BGJ398 on long 
bone and skull growth. To investigate the effect on endochondral 
ossification, we used ex vivo cultures of embryonic femurs iso-
lated from Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice (E16.5) with various concentrations 
of NVP-BGJ398. At day 6, untreated Fgfr3Y367C/+ femurs exhibited 
a reduction of length (–16.7%) compared with WT femurs (Fig-
ure 1C and Table 1). Six days of ex vivo culture with 10 nM NVP-
BGJ398 did not affect bone growth of WT femurs, whereas 100 
nM NVP-BGJ398 rescued completely the bone growth defect of 
Fgfr3Y367C/+ femurs (Figure 1C and Table 1). At 1 μM, NVP-BGJ398 
induced bone overgrowth of Fgfr3Y367C/+ femurs (+19.6% compared

taining (Figure 4C and Supplemental Figure 1B). In these treated 
mice, the expression of Col X was observed in the calcified carti-
lage, showing an active process of bone growth at the subtrabecu-
lar bone level (Figure 4C and Supplemental Figure 1B). Previously, 
we reported that angiogenesis was disturbed in Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice 
(29). We hypothesized that the action of NVP-BGJ398 on cartilage 
could affect angiogenesis in the growth plate and thus activate 
mineralization reflected by the altered size of the secondary ossi-
fication center (Figure 4A, and Supplemental Figure 1B). In sup-
port of this hypothesis, CD34, a marker of immature endothelial 
cells, was higher in the chondroosseous junctions of Fgfr3Y367C/+ 
mice with the NVP-BGJ398 treatment in comparison with the 
control treatment (Supplemental Figure 1C). These data suggest 
that NVP-BGJ398 treatment increased formation of endothelial 
sprouts and initiation of angiogenesis in Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice.
NVP-BGJ398 improves growth of the axial skeleton in Fgfr3Y367C/+ 
mice. Most ACH patients exhibit kyphosis, lordosis, platyspondyly, 
spinal stenosis, and short pedicles, indicating that the axial skel-
eton is also affected (1). For this reason, we investigated the spine 
of Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice. The rate of tail-length growth in Fgfr3Y367C/+ 
mice was increased with NVP-BGJ398 treatment from day 9 until 
the end of the treatment in comparison with the control treatment 
(+14.9% at day 9, +26.5%, at day 16) (Figure 5A).
Coronal and sagittal x-ray analyses of the axial skeleton did 
not reveal obvious scoliosis and kyphosis in Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice at 2 
weeks of age. In order to assess differences in the size of the axial 
skeleton, we decided to study lumbar vertebral bodies, which are 
usually affected in ACH. On x-rays and μCT, we observed that lum-
distinct increase in size of these limbs compared with those of 
control Fgfr3Y367C/+ littermates. At necropsy, long bones of treated 
Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice (NVP-BGJ398 and vehicle) and their Fgfr3+/+ con-
trol littermates were measured. In Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice, the lengths 
of proximal and distal long bones were significantly higher with 
NVP-BGJ398 treatment than control treatment (femur +20.9%, 
humerus +11.9%, tibia +32.6%, ulna 22.3%, and radius +24.1%) 
(Figure 3C and Supplemental Figure 1A; supplemental mate-
rial available online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI83926DS1). 
μCT imaging confirmed these data and also showed that NVP-
BGJ398 treatment expanded the total cross-sectional tissue area 
of Fgfr3Y367C/+ mouse distal femur metaphysis (+30% vs vehicle) 
(Figure 3, D–F). The long-bone growth of Fgfr3+/+ mice treated with 
NVP-BGJ398 was not affected (data not shown), and no prema-
ture death was observed, confirming the mild or null effect of the 
inhibitor on Fgfr3+/+ mice.
Histological analyses of the epiphyseal growth plate of long 
bones showed that NVP-BGJ398 improved growth-plate cartilage 
homeostasis in both distal and proximal femurs (Figure 4A) and 
tibias (Supplemental Figure 1B).
Chondrocyte proliferation was lower in Fgfr3Y367C/+ untreated 
mice (–59.9%) compared with Fgfr3+/+ mice, as measured with 
BrdU incorporation into the growth plate. By contrast, chondrocyte 
proliferation was significantly higher with NVP-BGJ398 treatment 
than control treatment in Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice (+162.1%) (Figure 4B).
Likewise, the impaired differentiation of hypertrophic chon-
drocytes in femurs and tibias of Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice was rescued by 
NVP-BGJ398 treatment, as demonstrated by Col X immunos-

with NVP-BGJ398, the size was greater than with the control treat-
ment (+12.1%) (Figure 5D and Supplemental Figure 2A).
To complete these analyses, we focused on IVDs, where 
FGFR3 is expressed (Supplemental Figure 2B). The IVD con-
tains the cartilage endplate (CEP) and fibrocartilaginous tissues, 
including the annulus fibrosus (AF) and the nucleus pulposus 
bar pedicles were shorter (–62.4%) in Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice compared 
with Fgfr3+/+ mice. After treatment with NVP-BGJ398 in Fgfr3Y367C/+ 
mice, the lumbar pedicles were greater in size than with the con-
trol treatment (+21.8%) (Figure 5, B and C, and Supplemental Fig-
ure 2A). We noted a lower size of the L4–L6 segment in Fgfr3Y367C/+ 
compared with Fgfr3+/+ mice (–29%), and after 15 days of treatment

(NP) (31). The NP is a gelatinous tissue located in the center of 
the IVD surrounded by the lamellar structured AF. First of all, we 
observed a lower width (–52.6%) and a greater length (+54.2%) of 
the NP in Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice compared with Fgfr3+/+ mice at 16 days 
(Figure 6, A and B). These defects were significantly ameliorated 
by NVP-BGJ398 treatment compared with control treatment for 
both the width (+73.3%) and length (–17.1%) in Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice. 
In order to analyze the AF extracellular matrix (ECM), we stud-
ied Col I and II expression. The cartilaginous area (Col II) cor-
responds to the inner AF (IAF), and the fibrous area (Col I) forms 
the outer AF (OAF) (31). Interestingly, we observed for what we 
believe is the first time that the length of the IAF was higher in 
Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice (+72.4%) than in Fgfr3+/+ mice (Figure 6C and 
Supplemental Figure 2B). This IAF phenotype was significantly 
ameliorated by NVP-BGJ398 treatment compared with control 
treatment (–60%). As a consequence, the IAF
/OAF ratio was also 
modified with the treatment.
In addition, we observed that the size of the CEP was lower in 
Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice (–18%) compared with Fgfr3+/+ mice, probably due 
to defective hypertrophic-chondrocyte differentiation (Supple-
mental Figure 3, A and B). This CEP phenotype was significantly 
ameliorated by NVP-BGJ398 treatment compared with control 
treatment (+29.3%) (Supplemental Figure 3, A and B).
Taking these data together, we demonstrate here that 15 
days of NVP-BGJ398 treatment corrected the size of L4–L6 and 
pedicles and modified collagen expression in the IVD. These data 
suggest a possible improvement of the ACH spinal stenosis phe-
notype with treatment.
NVP-BGJ398 improves the growth of the craniofacial skeleton in 
Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice. The cranial base is severely affected in humans 
with ACH and in Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice and hence contributes greatly to 
the craniofacial phenotype (28).
Therefore, we assessed whether early treatment with NVP-
BGJ398 could correct the cartilage defects of the skull base and thus 
prevent the premature loss of synchondroses. Imaging of the skull 
using μCT revealed that after 2 weeks of NVP-BGJ398 treatment 
compared with control treatment, the brachycephalic appearance 
of Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice was less obvious because the anterior-posterior 
length of the skull was greater (+5.9%) (Figure 7A). In addition, we 
observed that the size of nasal-bone length was lower in Fgfr3Y367C/+ 
mice (–33.8%) than in Fgfr3+/+ mice. This nasal-bone phenotype was 
significantly ameliorated by NVP-BGJ398 treatment compared 
with control treatment (+20.45%) (Figure 7A). NVP-BGJ398 treat-
ment partially prevented the loss of 4 synchondroses: the spheno-
occipital synchondrosis (SOS), the intersphenoidal synchondrosis 
(ISS), and the 2 interoccipital synchondroses (IOSs) in Fgfr3Y367C/+ 
mice (Figure 7, A and B). The efficacy of the NVP-BGJ398 treat-
ment was more prominent on the IOSs (all treated mice had at least 
one IOS active) than on the SOS and ISS (Table 2).
The size of the FM is much smaller in ACH patients and

which controls proliferation (32). The FGFR3 canonical down-
stream MAPK signaling pathway is more active in FGFR3-related 
disorders (33, 34). Consistent with decreased FGFR3 phosphoryla-
tion, the activation of MAPK and PLCγ pathways was reduced with 
NVP-BGJ398 dosing in HEK293-Vnr cells and human chondro-
cytes transiently transfected with constructs encoding activation 
mutants of FGFR3 (Supplemental Figure 5, A and B). These results 
were confirmed using human immortalized ACH (p.Gly380Arg/+) 
and TD (p.Ser249Cys/+) chondrocytes (ref. 25 and Supplemental 
Figure 5C) and using human (ACH, control) and mouse primary 
chondrocytes (Figure 9, A and B). With these cell cultures, we also 
observed a NVP-BGJ398 dose-dependent decrease in the level of 
phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Supplemental Figure 5C).
High levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 were observed in 
Fgfr3Y367C/+ chondrocyte cultures and in the growth plate of 
Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice in vivo, thus confirming the constitutive activa-
tion of the MAPK pathway in those mice (Figure 9C). Interestingly, 
ERK1/2 phosphorylation was undetectable in NVP-BGJ398–treat-
ed chondrocyte cultures, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was lower 
in growth-plate cartilage after NVP-BGJ398 treatment compared 
with control treatment in Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice (Figure 9, A–C, and 
Supplemental Figure 5, A–C). These data show that NVP-BGJ398 
inhibited FGFR3 activity in a RAS-ERK–dependent fashion.
NVP-BGJ398 treatment (area, +16.8%; transversal length, +15.8%; 
and sagittal length, +7.6% as assessed by μCT) (Figure 8, A and B). 
The rescue of the synchondroses phenotype presumably played a 
role in the amelioration of the FM phenotype.
These data indicate an impact of FGFR3 on both mesenchy-
mal (synchondroses) and neural crest–derived osteoblasts (nasal 
bone) and suggest an important role of FGFR3 on both intramem-
branous and endochondral ossification processes.
NVP-BGJ398 rescues defective FGFR3 signaling. FGFR3 is 
expressed in proliferative and prehypertrophic zones of the growth 
plate and modulates both proliferation and differentiation of the 
chondrocytes (32). The activating mutation stabilizes the receptor 
in cells, as demonstrated by the high expression of the receptor in 
the growth plate. The treatment of NVP-BGJ398 had a beneficial 
effect on the turnover of the receptor and lowered its expression in 
chondrocytes (Supplemental Figure 4A). In our Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice, 
as expected, another tyrosine kinase, FGFR1, was expressed in the 
hypertrophic zone of the growth plate, and its expression was not 
modified with NVP-BGJ398 treatment (Supplemental Figure 4B).
FGFR3 negatively regulates chondrocyte proliferation and dif-
ferentiation via several signaling pathways. The 2 principal signal-
ing pathways are the MAPK pathway, which regulates matrix pro-
duction and chondrocyte differentiation, and the STAT1 pathway,

this process comes to a halt at puberty and corresponds to the 
disappearance of the growth plate. Therefore, in ACH patients, 
treatment effectiveness may be better if the treatment commenc-
es before puberty. For this reason, we chose to treat Fgfr3Y367C/+ 
mice from day 1 for 15 days (protocol 1). However, in order to 
compare the efficacy of NVP-BGJ398 with that shown in previ-
ously published data, we also tested a second protocol (protocol 
2), similar to the one used for BMN111 (start at day 7 for 10 days) 
(15). The gain of growth of femurs and tibias was 50% higher in 
animals treated earlier and longer with NVP-BGJ398 (from day 1) 
than those treated from day 7 (Supplemental Figure 6 and Table 
3). When NVP-BGJ398 treatment was compared with BMN111 
treatment in Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice using protocol 2, we observed a 
greater amelioration of several aspects of the dwarfism pheno-
The role of the transcription factor SOX9 in chondrogenic dif-
ferentiation is well recognized (35, 36). Previously, it was reported 
that activated FGFR3 prevents the downregulation of transcrip-
tion factor SOX9 in differentiated chondrocytes (11). This mecha-
nism was also observed in Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice where the high expres-
sion of SOX9 in the prehypertrophic chondrocytes was lowered 
with NVP-BGJ398 treatment (Figure 9D). Also, the downregula-
tion of SOX9 correlated with the modification of the size and the 
shape of hypertrophic chondrocytes (Figure 4, A and C).
In FGFR3-related disorders, it has been demonstrated that 
the STAT1 pathway regulates chondrocyte proliferation (37, 38). In 
the Fgfr3Y367C/+ growth plate, the level of phosphorylated STAT1 is 
higher than in Fgfr3+/+ mice, and the level of phosphorylated STAT1 
is lowered by NVP-BGJ398 treatment (Supplemental Figure 5D). 
Hence, these data provide an underlying molecular 
explanation for the higher rate of chondrocyte prolifer-
ation with NVP-BGJ398 treatment in Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice, 
as shown with BrdU data (Figure 4B).
Overall, the data suggest that NVP-BGJ398 treat-
ment in Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice restores the activity of FGFR3 
downstream-signaling pathways to that of levels 
observed in Fgfr3+/+ mice.

ment of bone growth. Bone elongation relies on an active 
process controlled by proliferation and differentiation 
of chondrocytes within the growth plate. In humans,

signaling through the control of SOX9 (32) and chondrocyte pro-
liferation is suppressed by STAT1 activation (12).
One therapeutic strategy to rescue the defective skeletal 
development caused by FGFR3 gain-of-function mutations is to 
reduce or counteract the hyperactivity of FGFR3. Among the puta-
tive therapeutic approaches for ACH, the use of TKIs seems the 
most suitable. Although TKIs have been successfully used in can-
cer (45–47), TKIs have so far not been applied in skeletal disorders. 
Here, we demonstrate that NVP-BGJ398, a pan-FGFR inhibitor 
(20), was able to reduce the increased phosphorylation of FGFR3 
and the activation of its downstream signaling pathways in vitro, 
in human and mouse (Fgfr3Y367C/+) chondrocyte models of ACH, 
and to rescue the growth-plate phenotype in vivo in Fgfr3Y367C/+ 
mice. We believe the result obtained with NVP-BGJ398 is novel, 
as previous in vivo experiments using TKIs failed to demonstrate 
any rescue of the dwarf phenotype (48). Previously, NVP-BGJ398 
was tested in animal models for cancers, including hepatocellu-
lar carcinoma (24) and malignant rhabdoid tumors (23) as well as 
FGF23-dependent hypophosphatemic rickets (22). The effective 
doses administrated in these preclinical studies for cancer were 
10 to 100 times higher than the doses used in this present study 
to correct the dwarfism phenotype. Other therapeutic strategies 
were explored for ACH, with protocols using soluble FGFR3 (17), 
statin (18), or meclozine (19) in another mouse model of ACH 
(Fgfr3Ach) in which the Fgfr3 transgene with the ACH mutation 
is expressed under the control of Col2a1 (7). The comparison of 
those results with the results from our study is made complicated 
by the differences among the mouse models (genotypes, skeletal 
type with NVP-BGJ398 than with BMN111 (femur, tibia, tail, 
L4–L6) (Supplemental Figure 6, Table 3, and ref. 15). In conclu-
sion, NVP-BGJ398 treatment of Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice appeared more 
effective when administered earlier postnatally and for a longer 
period. NVP-BGJ398 treatment also appeared more effective than 
BMN111 treatment, suggesting that directly targeting FGFR3 with 
a TKI represents a better approach than targeting FGFR3 down-
stream-signaling pathways.
Discussion
Elevated kinase activity of the FGFR3 receptor due to germinal or 
somatic mutations disrupts several biological functions, as dem-
onstrated in FGFR3-related disorders (ACH, TD, hypochondro-
plasia, Muenke syndrome) (1, 2, 39) and numerous cancers (blad-
der cancers and multiple myeloma) (40–42). Hyperactive FGFR3 
signaling causes dwarfism, including ACH, which is character-
ized by anomalies in bone development, and the gain-of-function 
Fgfr3Y367C/+ mutation can be used to model ACH in mice (6, 28, 29, 
43). Conversely, a total impairment of the FGFR3 signaling path-
way can cause bone overgrowth, confirming that FGFR3 is a nega-
tive regulator of bone growth (5). On a functional level, FGFR acti-
vation affects various cell behaviors via the downstream activation 
of the MAPK intracellular signaling cascade. The MAPK pathway 
plays an important role in bone development, as demonstrated in 
MEK1 gain-of-function mice (12) and ERK1 and ERK2 null mice 
(44), leading to a dwarf or skeletal overgrowth phenotype, respec-
tively. The underlying mechanisms in FGFR3-related disorders 
suggest that chondrocyte differentiation is regulated by MAPK

tion (2). Here, we demonstrate that the axial skeleton was affected 
in Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice and the size of the lumbar vertebral bodies and 
pedicles was reduced. In addition, we showed that the 3 compo-
nents (NF, AF, CEP) of the IVD were affected. One of the findings 
of this study is that NVP-BGJ398 treatment remarkably corrected 
the lumbar vertebral body and pedicle size defects and modified 
the components of the ECM of the IVD. These data demonstrate 
that overactivation of FGFR3 disturbs cartilage, IVDs, and bone-
forming lumbar rachis, thus explaining the spinal stenosis, herniat-
ed disc, and kyphoscoliosis phenotypes of ACH patients. The posi-
tive impact of NVP-BGJ398 treatment is particularly noteworthy in 
this context: an improvement of axial skeletal development in ACH 
could reduce the need for decompressive laminectomy surgery, a 
procedure required for treating severe spinal stenosis (52).
The duration of the NVP-BGJ398 treatments were probably 
too short for the amelioration of the defective bone structure of 
the long bones in Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice (43). Longer treatments might 
be necessary to improve the bone architecture, as demonstrated 
previously with 2 months of PTH injection in an Fgfr3-related 
phenotypes, and FGFR3 expression pattern) (17–19). Interestingly, 
NVP-BGJ398 treatment for 10 days improved the bone growth 2 to 
3 times more than what had been reported for BMN111 (15). NVP-
BGJ398 (2 mg/kg) treatment of WT mice did not affect skeletal 
growth (data not shown), and treatment of Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice did not 
modify the expression of FGFR1 in the hypertrophic zone of the 
growth plate. Thus, in this preclinical study, NVP-BGJ398–medi-
ated effects were mainly due to FGFR3 inhibition, with no other 
gross side effects being observed.
The rescue of the growth-plate disorganization, the defective 
chondrocyte proliferation, and the delay of differentiation and 
secondary ossification were remarkable. The disrupted down-
stream FGFR3 signaling pathways were corrected with the NVP-
BGJ398 treatment, confirming the key role of ERK1/2, SOX9, and 
STAT1 signaling during skeletal development (32).
Of major importance, NVP-BGJ398, when applied from birth 
onwards, increased the size of the reduced FM and inhibited the 
premature fusion of synchondroses. In addition, the size of the 
neural crest–derived nasal bone was increased, reflecting that 
intramembranous ossification is also affected 
in ACH (28). These treatment-related effects 
on the skull suggested the potential of correct-
ing facial appearance in ACH patients and, 
most importantly, the potential of reducing 
the risks related to the cervicomedullary com-
pression and early death that can occur in ACH 
children (1, 49, 50).
The spine anomalies of children and adults 
with ACH are kyphosis at the thoracolumbar 
junction (51) and spinal stenosis (52), eventually 
leading to leg paralysis and neurogenic claudica-

with ImageJ (https:/
/imagej.nih.gov/ij/). Protocol 2 was as follows: 
Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice were 7 days old at treatment initiation and received 
daily subcutaneous administrations of NVP-BGJ398 (2 mg/kg body 
weight) or vehicle (HCl 3.5 mM, DMSO 5%) for 10 days; this protocol 
is similar to the BMN111 protocol previously described (15).
Genotyping. Genomic DNA was isolated from tail tips by protein-
ase K digestion and extracted with NucleoSpin Tissue (Macherey-
Nagel) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR was per-
formed using primers as previously described (29).
Femoral culture system. Ex vivo femur cultures were conducted 
as described previously (30). Right femur was cultured with NVP-
BGJ398 at a concentration of 10–100 nM to 1 μM and compared with 
the untreated left femur. The bone length was measured at the begin-
ning (before treatment) and at the end of time course. Each experi-
ment was repeated at least 5 times. Images were captured with an 
Olympus SZX12 stereo microscope. The size of the femur was mea-
sured using cellSens software (Olympus).
Calvarial culture system. Ex vivo calvarial cultures were con-
ducted as described previously (28). Calvaria (E18.5) were placed in 
24-well plates on top of 250 μl of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) previous-
ly placed at the bottom of the well. Calvaria were cultured in α-MEM 
(Gibco, Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, Life 
Technologies), 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1% 
penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Life Technologies) and NVP-BGJ398 
at 100 nM over 14 days. Images were captured with an Olympus 
SZX12 stereo microscope. The size of the calvaria defect was mea-
sured using ImageJ software.
Histological and immunohistochemical analyses. Fetal femur 
explants, long bones (femurs, tibias), and L4–L6 vertebrae were fixed 
in 4% paraformaldehyde, decalcified with EDTA 0.4 M, and embed-
ded in paraffin. Serial sections of 5 μm were stained with H&E and 
safranin O. For immunohistochemistry, sections were labeled with 
antibodies against Ki67 (monoclonal antibody, Abcam ab92353; 
1:3,000 dilution), Col X (BIOCYC, N.2031501005; 1:50 dilution),

clonal antibody, Abcam, catalog ab63601; 1:75 dilution), and FGFR3 
(polyclonal antibody, Sigma-Aldrich, catalog F0425; 1:250 dilution) 
using the Dako Envision Kit. Proliferation was analyzed with the BrdU 
Staining Kit (Life Technologies). Images were captured with an Olym-
pus PD70-IX2-UCB microscope and cellSens software. Labeled cells 
were counted using ImageJ software.
X-rays and CT scanner. The whole skeletons of the mice were 
radiographed using Faxitron (MX-20). μCT analyses were performed 
using a μCT40 Scanco vivaCT42 (Scanco Medical) instrument and the 
following settings: integration time, 300 ms (skull) or 175 ms (femur); 
45 E(kVp); 177 μA. For determination of femoral structural param-
eters, a segmentation threshold of 270 was applied and a Gaussian 
filter (σ = 0.7, support of 1 voxel) was used to suppress the noise. The 
evaluated volume was proportional to the femoral length, as measured 
on plain radiographs using a specimen radiography system (Faxitron 
LX-60), and corresponded to an average of 142 μm (metaphysis) or 
dwarf mouse model (16). Because short-term NVP-BGJ398 treat-
ment improved the chondroosseous junction in the long bones of 
the growing Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice, there is potential that longer NVP-
BGJ398 treatments could lead to a secondary positive effect on the 
resulting bone structure.
The different skeletal phenotypes and molecular pathways 
evaluated in our study provide a wide range of markers that can 
be monitored for further optimization of dosing schedules of TKI 
in addition to prolongation, such as reductions in dose quantity or 
frequency (e.g., intermittent injections every 2 or 3 days).
In summary, we have shown that NVP-BGJ398 inhibits FGFR3 
and its downstream signaling pathways, which are overactive in 
cartilage in ACH. As a consequence, NVP-BGJ398 rescues the 
endochondral and membranous ossification processes in a mouse 
model of ACH. Our results provide a rationale for targeting FGFR3 
with a specific TKI for the treatment of children with ACH.
Methods
Transient transfections of cDNA FGFR3 constructs. Human control 
chondrocyte lines (25) and human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells (26) 
at 80%–90% confluence were transiently transfected with FGFR3 
human constructs (FGFR3WT, FGFR3G380R, FGFR3Y373C, FGFR3K650E, 
FGFR3K650M) obtained as previously reported (26) using JetPrime 
(Polyplus-transfection) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Transfected cells were incubated with NVP-BGJ398 (Novartis Basel, 
ref. 20) at concentrations of 100 nM, 1 nM, or 10 μM overnight. Trans-
fected cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 
mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, and 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, supplement-
ed with protease and phosphatase inhibitors; Roche). Immunoprecipi-
tations were performed by incubating 3 μl rabbit anti-FGFR3 (Sigma-
Aldrich F0425)/500 μg protein with protein A–agarose (Roche).
Primary and immortalized human chondrocytes and mouse chondro-
cytes cultures. Primary and immortalized mutant cells were obtained 
as previously described (25). The protocol used for mouse chondro-
cytes was previously reported (24). Human and mouse cells were incu-
bated with NVP-BGJ398 (1, 10, 50, 100, 250, and 500 nM) overnight.
Immunoblotting. Whole-cell lysates and immunoprecipitated 
proteins were subjected to NuPAGE 4%–12% bis-tris acrylamide gels 
(Life Technologies). Blots were probed with antibodies using standard 
protocols: anti-FGFR3 polyclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich F0425; 
1:1,000 dilution), anti–phospho-tyrosine P-Tyr-100 monoclonal anti-
body (Cell Signaling catalog 9411; 1:1,000 dilution), anti–phospho-
ERK1/2 monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling catalog 4370; 1:1,000 
dilution), anti-ERK1/2 polyclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich M5670; 
1:1000 dilution), anti–phospho-PLCγ polyclonal antibody (Cell Sig-
naling catalog 2821; 1:1,000 dilution), and anti-PLCγ polyclonal anti-
body (Cell Signaling catalog 2822; 1:1,000 dilution).
Mouse model and drug treatment. Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice were described 
previously (29). All mice were on a C57BL/6 background. Cartilage 
and bone analyses were performed in 16-day-old mice. Protocol 1 
was as follows: Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice were 1 day old at treatment initiation 
and received daily subcutaneous administrations of NVP-BGJ398 for 
15 days (2 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle (HCl 3.5 mM, DMSO 5%). 
Treated and control mice received an intraperitoneal BrdU (Invitro-
gen) injection (1 ml per 100 g body) 2 hours before sacrifice. Long 
bones were measured by caliper (VWRi819-0013, VWR Interna-
tional), while vertebrae measures were determined from radiograph

120 μm (diaphysis) for vehicle-treated and 169 μm (metaphysis) or 143 
μm (diaphysis) for compound-treated Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice.
Statistics. Differences between experimental groups were 
assessed using ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test or Mann-Whitney U 
test. The significance threshold was set at P ≤ 0.05. Statistical analyses 
were performed using GraphPad PRISM (v5.03). All values are shown 
as mean ± SD.
Study approval. Experimental animal procedures and protocols 
were approved by the French Animal Care and Use Committee.
