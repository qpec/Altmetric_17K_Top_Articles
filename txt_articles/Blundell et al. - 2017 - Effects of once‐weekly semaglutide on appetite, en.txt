Aim: The aim of this trial was to investigate the mechanism of action for body weight loss with
semaglutide.
Materials and methods: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period cross-
over trial investigated the effects of 12 weeks of treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous
semaglutide, dose-escalated to 1.0 mg, in 30 subjects with obesity. Ad libitum energy intake,
ratings of appetite, thirst, nausea and well-being, control of eating, food preference, resting
metabolic rate, body weight and body composition were assessed.
Results: After a standardised breakfast, semaglutide, compared with placebo, led to a lower ad
libitum energy intake during lunch (−1255 kJ; P < .0001) and during the subsequent evening
meal (P = .0401) and snacks (P = .0034), resulting in a 24% reduction in total energy intake
across all ad libitum meals throughout the day (−3036 kJ; P < .0001). Fasting overall appetite
suppression scores were improved with semaglutide vs placebo, while nausea ratings were sim-
ilar. Semaglutide was associated with less hunger and food cravings, better control of eating
and a lower preference for high-fat foods. Resting metabolic rate, adjusted for lean body mass,
did not differ between treatments. Semaglutide led to a reduction from baseline in mean body
weight of 5.0 kg, predominantly from body fat mass.
Conclusion: After 12 weeks of treatment, ad libitum energy intake was substantially lower with
semaglutide vs placebo with a corresponding loss of body weight observed with semaglutide.
In addition to reduced energy intake, likely mechanisms for semaglutide-induced weight loss
included less appetite and food cravings, better control of eating and lower relative preference
for fatty, energy-dense foods.

INTRODUCTION
Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1, an incretin hormone secreted from
the L-cells in the small intestine, stimulates insulin and inhibits
glucagon
secretions
from
the
pancreatic
islets
in
a
glucose-
dependent fashion, leading to lower blood glucose levels.1,2 In
clinical studies, GLP-1 has been shown to enhance satiety, reduce
hunger and lower energy intake.3,4 Additionally, research conducted
in rats suggests that these effects may be due to GLP-1 acting
directly on receptors in the brain, affecting perceptions of the
reward value of food.5
GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) have been shown to reduce body
weight and blood glucose levels in people who are overweight or
obese, with or without diabetes.6–10 Furthermore, activation of

 GLP-1 receptors in the human brain helps to regulate appetite and
food reward.11 Animal studies have shown that a GLP-1RA, liraglu-
tide, can access specific areas of the brain involved in appetite regula-
tion.11,12 Combined, these studies indicate a central mechanism for
liraglutide-mediated weight loss due to the direct activation of dis-
crete sites within the hypothalamus.
Semaglutide is a human GLP-1 analogue currently in develop-
ment for the treatment of T2D, with a similar structure to liraglutide.
Semaglutide
has
94%
structural
homology
with
native
human
GLP-113 with three important modifications: an amino acid substitu-
tion at position 8 makes semaglutide less susceptible to degradation
by dipeptidyl peptidase-4; lysine acylation of the peptide backbone
with a spacer and C-18 fatty di-acid chain at position 26 provides
strong, specific binding to albumin; and another amino acid substitu-
tion at position 34 prevents C-18 fatty di-acid binding at the wrong
site.13 These modifications give semaglutide an extended half-life of
approximately one week,13 making it suitable for once-weekly admin-
istration.14,15 Once-weekly administration may improve patient com-
pliance and quality of life,16,17 compared with first-generation GLP-
1RAs that require once-/twice-daily dosing.18 Semaglutide is associ-
ated with dose-dependent reductions in HbA1c and body weight in
individuals with diabetes.19 As a GLP-1RA, the trial of the effect
of semaglutide on appetite control may provide additional clarity
concerning the role of GLP-1 receptors in this process.
The primary aim of this trial was to investigate the role of sema-
glutide compared with placebo on body weight loss in subjects with
obesity by evaluating the effect of semaglutide on ad libitum energy
intake. In addition, further aspects of homeostatic (ad libitum energy
intake after lunch, appetite ratings and energy expenditure) and
hedonic (food preference and food cravings) regulation of energy bal-
ance were assessed. This trial also evaluated glucose and lipid metab-
olism, and gastric emptying in the same subjects; these data will be
reported elsewhere.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1
| Trial design
This was a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-con-
trolled, two-period crossover trial (NCT02079870, EudraCT number:
2013-000012-24) (Figure S1). The trial was conducted in compliance
with the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical
Practice guidelines20 and the Declaration of Helsinki.21
2.2
| Trial population
Eligible
subjects
were
≥18 years
of
age,
with
a
body
mass
index (BMI) of 30 to 45 kg/m2, HbA1c < 6.5% and stable body
weight (< 3 kg change during the 3 months prior to screening). Key
exclusion criteria were: diagnosis of type 1 or 2 diabetes; history of
chronic/idiopathic
acute
pancreatitis;
personal/family
history
of
medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia syn-
drome type 2; previous surgical treatment for obesity; smoking or
use of any nicotine products; use of any medication that could
interfere with trial results; or anticipated change in lifestyle (e.g., eat-
ing, exercise or sleeping pattern) during the trial. Written informed
consent was obtained from all participants before any trial-related
activities commenced.
2.3
| Interventions
The trial consisted of two 12-week crossover treatment periods, sepa-
rated by a wash-out period of 5 to 7 weeks. Eligible subjects were ran-
domised 1:1 to one of two treatment sequences: semaglutide–
placebo or placebo–semaglutide. Subjects received either semaglutide
(1.34 mg/mL) or matching placebo administered subcutaneously (s.c.)
once-weekly. The starting dose was 0.25 mg (4 weeks), escalating to
0.5 mg (4 weeks) and then 1.0 mg (4 weeks). Subjects received a fifth
dose (administered at the clinic) of 1.0 mg at the last visit of each
treatment period and assessments were conducted. Subjects attended
the clinic for each dose escalation and were reminded, by text mes-
sage or telephone, to administer the remaining doses at home.
2.4
| Endpoints
The primary endpoint was ad libitum energy intake during a lunch meal
(5 hours after a standardised breakfast meal) after 12 weeks of treat-
ment. Secondary endpoints included: ad libitum energy intake during a
subsequent evening meal and from an evening snack box; total day-
time ad libitum energy intake until midnight; duration of ad libitum
lunch; ratings of appetite parameters, thirst, nausea and well-being
before and after a standardised breakfast meal; palatability of ad libitum
meals; energy expenditure (resting metabolic rate [RMR] and respira-
tory quotient [RQ]); control of eating and food cravings over the past
week; food preference; body weight; and body composition (fat and
fat-free mass). In addition, the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics (PK),
and safety and tolerability of semaglutide were investigated.
2.5
| Assessments
At the end of each 12-week treatment period, subjects attended an
in-house stay. On Day 1 of their stay, subjects were standardised
with regard to meals, physical activity and sleep. The last dose of trial
drug was administered in the evening.
On Day 2, a 5-hour standardised breakfast meal test was
performed (macronutrient composition: approximately 30 energy per-
centage [E%] fat, 15 E% protein, 55 E% carbohydrate); meals were
served at ~8:00 AM. Following this test, a homogeneous ad libitum
lunch was served in excess (Appendix S1) and meal duration was
recorded. At ~6:00 PM, subjects were given a self-served ad libitum
evening meal. For both lunch and evening meals, subjects were
instructed to eat until pleasantly satiated; food consumption was
measured. At ~7:00 PM, subjects received their evening snack box
comprised of four food categories (four items of 100 g each: high-fat
and sweet; low-fat and sweet; high-fat and non-sweet; low-fat and
non-sweet; individualised by preference), which they were allowed to
keep until midnight. The consumption of each food category was
recorded.

 Subjective ratings of appetite parameters (hunger, fullness, satiety,
prospective food consumption), thirst, nausea and well-being were
assessed on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) before and up to
5 hours after the standardised breakfast meal, with the end of each VAS
line indicating the most extreme sensation the subject had experienced.22
Overall appetite suppression score was calculated based on the four appe-
tite parameters (Appendix S1).10 Palatability (taste, visual appearance,
overall pleasantness) was assessed on a 100 mm VAS after each ad
libitum meal.
On Day 3, fasting RMR and RQ were assessed in the morning by
indirect calorimetry using a ventilated hood system.23 RMR and RQ
were calculated from the volume of oxygen consumed and volume of
carbon dioxide produced (Appendix S1). Control of eating and the
degree of food cravings were measured using a validated 16-item
short form Control of Eating Questionnaire (COEQ),24,25 which
included questions related to food cravings, control of eating, hunger
and fullness. Based on the previous 7 days, subjects were asked to
rate 15 questions on a 100 mm VAS. One question was open-ended.
As well as measuring preferential energy intake from the evening
snack box by food categories on Day 2, food preference was
assessed in the fasted state at ~8:00 AM on Day 3. The Leeds Food
Preference Task (LFPT)26,27 measures components of food prefer-
ence and reward (explicit liking and implicit wanting). Validation of
this method has been described previously.28–30 Subjects were pre-
sented with pictures of food items common in the diet from the same
four
categories
as
were
included
in
the
evening
snack
box
(Figure S2). The array was either predominantly high (>50 E%) or low
(<20 E%) in fat, and sweet or non-sweet (savoury) in taste, with
similar familiarity and palatability. To measure explicit liking, rando-
mised food images were presented individually, and subjects rated
the extent to which they liked each food (i.e., how pleasant would it
be to taste this food now?) using a 100 mm VAS (Figure S3A). Implicit
wanting and relative preference were assessed using a forced choice
methodology. Images of each of the four food categories were paired
to every other category in 96 combinations. Subjects were instructed
to respond as quickly and as accurately as they could to indicate their
preference at that time (i.e., which food do you most want to eat
now?). For implicit wanting (Figure S3B), reaction times for all
responses were covertly recorded and mean response times for each
food category (adjusted for frequency of selection) were calculated.
A positive rating indicated an immediate response to a given food
category,
and
a
negative
rating
indicated
the
opposite.
The
frequency-weighted algorithm was used to account for both selection
and non-selection, which positively or negatively contributed to the
rating, respectively.
Body composition was measured in a fasted state using air dis-
placement plethysmography (Bodpod®, Concord, USA), which has
been validated for both normal-weight adults31 and obese adults.32
Body weight was measured prior to subjects entering the Bodpod
and data were automatically transferred into the system. Body com-
position (including percentage body fat)33 was determined via density
measurements (Appendix S1).
PK endpoints (trough values) were assessed for semaglutide in
steady state after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment. Additionally, PK
endpoints derived from the concentration-time curves (0-168 hours)
at semaglutide 1.0 mg steady state were assessed after the last dose.
Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), hypoglycaemic
events and blood pressure.
2.6
| Statistical analysis
Based on a previous trial,10 30 subjects were needed to provide a
power of 80% to detect a treatment difference in energy intake of
500 kJ at a significance level of 5%, assuming a dropout rate of about
15%. The primary endpoint was analysed in a linear mixed model on
original outcome values, including treatment and period as fixed
effects and subject as a random effect. Statistical analysis of the pri-
mary endpoint was performed for the full analysis set (FAS; all rando-
mised subjects who were exposed to ≥1 dose of trial product). Energy
intake, duration of ad libitum lunch and COEQ endpoints were ana-
lysed as per the primary endpoint. The ad libitum evening snack box
energy intake also included interaction between treatments, with
high-/low-fat and sweet/non-sweet food categories as fixed effects.
Furthermore, treatment differences were estimated for the two food
categories of high-fat combined and the two categories of low-fat
combined, using a linear mixed model. Treatment period, and interac-
tions between treatments and high-/low-fat food categories were
fixed effects; subject was a random effect. A similar approach was
used for sweet/non-sweet food categories. Endpoints for the LFPT28
were analysed in a statistical model similar to that used for energy
intake of the evening snack box with the same four food categories.
Body weight, body composition and palatability assessments of the ad
libitum lunch, evening meal and evening snack box were summarised
descriptively. For VAS profiles of appetite, thirst, nausea and well-
being, the fasting rating and mean postprandial increase in rating were
analysed as per the main analysis of the primary endpoint. For the
mean postprandial increase in ratings, the fasting ratings were added
as a covariate. Palatability was analysed post-hoc using a linear mixed
model; treatment and treatment period were fixed effects; subject
was a random effect. Treatment difference in RMR was estimated post
hoc using a linear mixed model; treatment, treatment period and sub-
ject were fixed effects. Treatment difference in RQ was similarly esti-
mated. Treatment difference in RMR was also estimated with lean
body mass as a covariate. All statistical analyses were two-sided and
on a 5% significance level. The primary endpoint was controlled for
type 1 error. Other analyses were not controlled for multiplicity.

RESULTS
3.1
| Trial population
Thirty subjects were randomised to once-weekly semaglutide or
placebo, and 28 completed both treatment periods of the trial. Two
female subjects took contraceptives during both treatment periods.
Two subjects withdrew during treatment period 1 while receiving
semaglutide due to gastrointestinal (GI) AEs. Baseline characteristics
are shown in Table S1. Mean age, body weight and BMI were
42 years, 101.3 kg and 33.8 kg/m2, respectively. Two-thirds of sub-
jects were male.

| Ad libitum energy intake and macronutrient
composition
Ad libitum energy intake at lunch was approximately 35% lower with
semaglutide vs placebo (primary endpoint; estimated treatment differ-
ence (ETD) [95% confidence interval (CI)], −1255 kJ [−1707; −804];
P < .0001) (Figure 1A). In addition, ad libitum food intake and meal
duration were significantly lower with semaglutide vs placebo
(Table 1). Lower ad libitum energy and food intake were also observed
at subsequent evening meals and the evening snacks (Figure 1A and
Table 1). Total energy intake across all ad libitum meals was approxi-
mately 24% lower with semaglutide vs placebo (ETD [95% CI]
−3036 kJ [−4209; −1864]; P < .0001) (Figure 1A). Energy intake of
food categories in the ad libitum evening snack box showed an
approximately 35% lower intake from high-fat and non-sweet foods
with semaglutide vs placebo (P = .0184) (Figure 1B). Macronutrient
compositions of foods consumed in the ad libitum evening meal and
evening snack box were similar between treatments.

 3.3
| Appetite, thirst, nausea and well-being
At the standardised breakfast meal, the fasting overall appetite sup-
pression score was higher with semaglutide vs placebo, indicating less
appetite with semaglutide (P = .0023). Overall appetite suppression
scores remained higher at all time-points with semaglutide, with the
difference increasing towards the end of the 5-hour postprandial
period (Figure 2A). In general, VAS ratings of individual appetite para-
meters indicated less appetite with semaglutide vs placebo (Figure 2B
and C). Ratings for thirst, nausea and well-being were similar between
treatments (Figure 2C).
Postprandial increases from fasting VAS ratings showed greater
increases in satiety with semaglutide vs placebo; however, differ-
ences in the overall incremental appetite suppression score were
not significant (Figure S4). Postprandial increases from fasting rat-
ings in nausea, thirst and well-being were comparable between
treatments.
3.4
| Palatability
Palatability ratings were similar between treatments for both ad libitum
lunch and evening meal, except for taste of the ad libitum lunch (ETD
[95% CI] −8.5 mm [−16.5; −0.4]; P = .0398) and visual appearance of
the ad libitum evening meal (ETD [95% CI] −7.4 mm [−14.6; −0.2];
P = .0432). Mean ratings of all parameters were above 50 mm for all
meals regardless of treatment.
3.5
| Energy expenditure
RMR was lower following 12 weeks of treatment with semaglutide vs
placebo (ETD −602 kJ/24h [−959; −245]; P = .0019), while there was
no significant difference in RQ (ETD −0.03 [−0.06; 0.00]; P = .0698).
When adjusted for lean body mass, the difference in RMR was not
significant between treatments (ETD RMR, −508 kJ/24 h [−1061;
46], P = .0704).

 3.6
| Control of eating and food cravings
The COEQ indicated less hunger, better control of eating and meal
portion size, less food cravings, particularly for savoury foods, and
lower ratings for the pleasantness of food for semaglutide vs placebo
(Figure 3).
3.7
| Food preference
LFPT indicated lower explicit liking for high-fat and non-sweet foods
with semaglutide vs placebo (P = .0016). Differences between treat-
ments in explicit liking for other food categories were not significant.
Ratings of implicit wanting were lower for high-fat and non-sweet
foods (P = .0203) and higher for low-fat and sweet foods (P = .0401)
with semaglutide vs placebo (Table S2).
3.8
| Body weight and body composition
After 12 weeks of treatment with semaglutide, a change from base-
line in mean body weight of −5.0 kg was observed, vs +1.0 kg with
placebo. A three-fold greater loss of mean fat over lean body mass
was observed with semaglutide vs placebo (Figure 4).
3.9
| PK endpoints
The PK profile for semaglutide was as expected, supporting com-
pliance with the treatment regimen during the trial (mean [coeffi-
cient of variation (CV)] AUC0-168h: 4467 [17.7] nmol × h/L; Cmax:
32.0 [19.1] nmol/L; tmax: 33.2 [59.8] hours). Mean trough values

| Safety
AEs were reported more frequently with semaglutide vs placebo.
All AEs were mild or moderate in severity; no serious AEs were
reported. The most common AEs were GI events. Two AEs led to
withdrawal from the trial during semaglutide treatment. No severe
or
blood
glucose-confirmed
symptomatic
hypoglycaemic
events
were reported. Observed systolic and diastolic blood pressure were
stable throughout the trial for subjects receiving either treatment;
at week 12, observed mean changes from baseline were within
2 mm Hg.

DISCUSSION
This trial investigated the mechanism of body weight loss with semaglu-
tide in subjects with obesity. The results suggest that the significantly
lower energy intake provides a plausible mechanism to explain the
decrease in body weight associated with semaglutide treatment. Not
only was energy intake during ad libitum lunch (primary endpoint) sub-
stantially lower with semaglutide vs placebo (approximately −35%), the
same pattern also held true for subsequent ad libitum evening meal and
evening snack box, demonstrating no compensatory effect due to a
reduced lunch intake earlier in the day. Total ad libitum energy intake
across all meals on the test day was reduced by 24%. A reduction in
body weight of approximately 5.0 kg over 12 weeks was observed with
semaglutide, consistent with previous findings.19 Energy expenditure
appeared to be lower with semaglutide vs placebo, though not statisti-
cally significant after correcting for lean body mass, suggesting that
semaglutide-associated weight loss was not attributable to increased
energy expenditure.
Given recent findings regarding the association between energy
intake and changes in weight,34,35 it is not possible to ascertain to what
degree reductions in energy intake led to the 5.0 kg loss of body weight.
Since RMR did not increase with semaglutide, it can be inferred that the
whole of the body weight loss was most likely caused by a reduction in
energy intake. However, RMR represents only one dimension of energy
expenditure and the impact of semaglutide on the thermogenic effect or
physical activity is unknown.
It should be noted that the reduction in energy intake was
observed during/after body weight loss, despite known counter-
regulatory effects during a period with an energy deficit.36 In terms of
body composition, a three-fold greater reduction in body fat vs lean
body mass was observed with semaglutide, indicating no unintentional
excess loss of lean body mass.
The effect on energy intake is consistent with previous data from
non-clinical37 and clinical studies with other GLP-1RAs,38,39 as well as
studies with native GLP-1,3 with the reduction in energy intake correlat-
ing with reduction in body weight.3,38,39 However, the effects with sema-
glutide appear to be greater than those of other GLP-1RAs, consistent
with larger weight reductions observed in larger semaglutide trials of
longer duration;40 however, caution is required when drawing an indirect
comparison between trials.
Furthermore, by accessing specific areas of the brain relevant for
appetite regulation, GLP-1RAs (e.g., liraglutide) may mediate weight loss
via direct activation of discrete sites within the hypothalamus.11 This may
help explain how treatment with semaglutide led to reduced appetite and
food cravings, and better control of eating. The COEQ, which assessed
control of eating and food cravings, demonstrated less hunger, better con-
trol of eating and less food cravings, particularly for savoury foods, com-
pared with placebo. These effects probably reflect both direct and indirect
effects of semaglutide treatment on body weight and fat mass. The LFPT,
which assessed food reward (explicit liking and implicit wanting), showed
a relatively lower liking and wanting of high-fat, non-sweet foods com-
pared with placebo, consistent with results of the COEQ. The LFPT
results also corroborated actual ad libitum energy intake from the same
food categories of the evening snack box, suggesting that the lower intake
of fatty, energy-dense food may be the result of semaglutide-mediated
reduction in preference for such foods.
Semaglutide
treatment
was
not
associated
with
significant
changes in nausea vs placebo, either in the fasted state or post-
prandially. Mean palatability ratings of all meals were above 50 mm
for both treatments, meaning that meals were generally well liked.
Combined, these results suggest that the lower energy intake
and body weight loss with semaglutide was a general effect on both
homeostatic and hedonic systems of appetite control, rather than a
response caused by nausea or food aversion.
Overall, semaglutide was well tolerated. No new safety concerns
were identified, in line with other GLP-1RAs and longer-term semaglutide
trials.6,7,40
By having subjects act as their own control, the crossover design
of this trial can be considered a major strength of our overall findings.
With regard to changes in weight and body composition, however,
this trial could be conversely limited by the crossover design. During
the wash-out period, body weight in subjects receiving semaglutide
likely had recovered before crossing over to placebo, but may not
have had sufficient time to reach pre-treatment levels; which might
have contributed to the small weight gain observed with placebo.
In conclusion, data after 12 weeks of treatment indicate that
semaglutide-induced weight loss is probably caused by the reduced
energy intake associated with reductions in appetite, and is not the
result of increased energy expenditure. Other mechanisms include
improvements in the control of eating, fewer food cravings and a
lower relative preference for fatty, energy-dense foods. Further-
more, semaglutide-induced weight loss was associated with propor-
tionally greater losses of body fat than lean body mass.
