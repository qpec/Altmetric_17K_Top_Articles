Aims
Vancomycin is commonly added to acrylic bone cement during revision arthroplasty 
surgery. Proprietary cement preparations containing vancomycin are available, but are 
significantly more expensive. We investigated whether the elution of antibiotic from ‘home-
made’ cement containing vancomycin was comparable with more expensive commercially 
available vancomycin impregnated cement.
Materials and Methods
A total of 18 cement discs containing either proprietary CopalG+V; or ‘home-made’ 
CopalR+G with vancomycin added by hand, were made. Each disc contained the same 
amount of antibiotic (0.5 g gentamycin, 2 g vancomycin) and was immersed in ammonium 
acetate buffer in a sealed container. Fluid from each container was sampled at eight time 
points over a two-week period. The concentrations of gentamicin and vancomycin in the 
fluid were analysed using high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.
Results
The highest peak concentrations of antibiotic were observed from the ‘home-made’ 
cements containing vancomycin, added as in the operating theatre. The overall elution of 
antibiotic was, fivefold (vancomycin) and twofold (gentamicin) greater from the ‘home-
made’ mix compared with the commercially mixed cement. The use of a vacuum during 
mixing had no significant effect on antibiotic elution in any of the samples.
Conclusion
These findings suggest that the addition of 2 g vancomycin powder to gentamicin-
impregnated bone cement by hand significantly increases the elution of both antibiotics 
compared with commercially prepared cements containing vancomycin. We found no 
significant advantages of using expensive commercially produced vancomycin-impregnated 
cement and recommend the addition of vancomycin powder by hand in the operating 
theatre.

Total hip (THA) and knee arthroplasty (TKA)
are among the most successful of all surgical
procedures. Post-operative satisfaction scores
are high and demand is on the increase.1 More
than 180 000 hip and knee arthroplasties were
recorded in the National Joint Registry (NJR)
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland for
2014, an increase of 20% compared with
2010.2
Periprosthetic infection is one of the most
serious complications following arthroplasty,
with an incidence of between 0.5% and 2% in
most series.3-9 Infection was listed as the indi-
cation for surgery in 9.6% of revision THAs
and 23% of revision TKAs in the NJR in
2014.2 Although the rates of revision have not
changed over recent years, the number of revi-
sions for infection has increased due to the
increased number of primary arthroplasties.2
Many strategies are used to minimise the risk
of infection, one of which is the use of antibiotic
impregnated polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)
bone cement which was introduced in the
1970s.10,11 The use of antibiotic impregnated
cement for primary arthroplasty is still
controversial9,12-14 but it is widely accepted to
be an important component of revision arthro-
plasty for infection, allowing targeted antibiot-
ics to be delivered locally in a high
concentration.12,15-17
The treatment of prosthetic joint infection
with a single- or two-stage exchange, using
gentamicin-impregnated bone cement, is suc-
cessful in about 90% of cases.16-22 However,

gentamicin-resistant organisms are increasingly com-
mon.23,24 Vancomycin elutes effectively from PMMA
cement and its use in this way has been shown to reduce the
need for the administration of vancomycin systemically,
thus avoiding the potential side-effects such as nephro-
toxicity ototoxicity and renal failure, which can be seen due
to its narrow therapeutic range.17,25
It is widely known that the addition of antibiotics to
PMMA cement reduces its strength in vitro, however this has
not been shown to cause a problem in clinical practice and it
has been shown that the addition of up to 5% of vancomycin
is safe.26,27 The method of mixing does not appear to affect
the strength of the cement.28 We have been using ‘home-
made’ vancomycin-impregnated cement successfully at the
Northern General Hospital, Sheffield, United Kingdom, for
20 years.17 Various commercially prepared PMMA cements
containing vancomycin are now available but they are about
five times more expensive than standard cements containing
only gentamicin. Locally, a double mix Palacos R+G and 2 g
vancomycin powder costs approximately £72 compared
with £350 for a double mix of Copal G+V.
The aim of this study was to compare the elution of van-
comycin and gentamicin from various preparations of
cement to determine whether there is any significant differ-
ence in elution between commercially available cements
containing vancomycin, and ‘home-made’ cement to which
we added vancomycin by hand in theatre.
Materials and Methods
Three different preparations of PMMA cement were com-
pared:
- Group 1 (commercially prepared cement): 40 g Copal G
+ V (Heraeus Medical, Hanau, Hessen, Germany), contain-
ing 0.5 g gentamicin and 2 g vancomycin.
- Group 2 (‘home-made’, manufacturer mixed cement):
40 g Palacos R+G (Heraeus Medical) + 2 g of vancomycin
powder added according to the manufacturer’s instructions
by gradually combining equal volumes of antibiotic and
cement powder and repeating until all antibiotic is mixed
into the powder.
- Group 3 (‘home-made’, ad hoc mixed cement): 40 g
Palacos R+G (Heraeus Medical) + 2 g of vancomycin pow-
der mixed following a method similar to that used in the
operating theatre when all vancomycin is added to the
cement at once and mixed together to ensure that the anti-
biotic is incorporated homogeneously into the cement pow-
der.
Each of the three preparations therefore contained the
same quantities of antibiotic: 0.5 g gentamicin and 2 g van-
comycin per 40 g mix.
Antibiotic elution. The cement and vancomycin powder
were stored at room temperature for at least 24 hours
before mixing. Three separate batches of each of the three
groups of cement preparation were mixed, both with and
without vacuum, using the Palamix system (Heraeus
Medical). During the working phase, between two and
three and a half minutes after adding the liquid monomer,
the cement was set in 5 mm × 9 mm diameter plastic moulds
and allowed to cure for one hour before storing at -20°C.
Antibiotic elution assays were carried out as described by
Barker et al29 as follows: the samples were placed in Nunc
24 well plates and submerged in 0.1 M ammonium acetate
solution (pH 7.4); the plates were incubated at room tem-
perature, gently agitating and aliquots taken 0, one, two,
six, 24, 48, 72, 168 and 336 hours (14 days) later.
The cumulative eluted concentrations of antibiotic in the
aliquots were measured using high performance liquid
chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) with a
Phenomenex Luna C18 column (150 mm × 1 mm) (Phe-
nomenex, Torrance, California), coupled to a Finnigan
LCQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corporation,
San Jose, California). The system was run with a single
mobile phase comprising an aqueous solution of 20%
methanol with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The mass spec-
trometer was run in positive ion mode using selected ion
monitoring to scan for the parent ions at 478 m/z (proto-
nated gentamicin ions) and 1450 m/z (protonated vanco-
mycin ions). Ammonium acetate buffer was used for the
elution experiments to avoid the need for a desalting step
before HPLC-MS. The buffer solution was not replaced at
the time of sampling and the cumulative elution of anti-
biotic over the 14-day period of the study was measured.
Statistical analysis. Results were recorded in Excel 2010
and the statistical analysis was carried out using Excel
(Microsoft, Redmond, Washington) and R (R Foundation
for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Analysis of the
elution of antibiotic was undertaken using analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) testing for the type of cement, the method
of vacuum mixing and interactions. The interactions
between the type of cement and the method of vacuum mix-
ing were tested sequentially. A p-value of < 0.05 was con-
sidered significant.
Results
The elution of gentamicin and vancomycin from the ‘ad
hoc’ preparations (group 3), mixed both with and without
vacuum, were significantly higher than from the other meth-
ods of preparation (p = 1.56 × 10-4 and p = 2.02 × 10-5,
respectively). The mean peak concentration of gentamicin
was 756 μg/ml (543 to 1132) and the mean peak concentra-
tion of vancomycin was was 677 μg/ml (475 to 1028) with
the ‘ad hoc’ mixed cement. This group also showed more
variation in elution kinetics compared with the other prep-
arations (Figs 1 and 2).
When vancomycin was added to Palacos R+G cement fol-
lowing the manufacturer's instructions (group 2), the results
were comparable with commercially prepared cement
(group 1), with mean concentrations of vancomycin ranging
from 68 μg/ml to 149 μg/ml and concentrations of gen-
tamicin ranging from 301 μg/ml to 471 μg/ml (Figs 1 and 2).
The use of a vacuum during mixing of the different
cements was tested sequentially and found to have no

significant effect on the elution of either gentamicin or
vancomycin for any of the cement groups (p = 0.92 and
p = 0.97, respectively).
Discussion
The manual addition of antibiotic powder to PMMA
cement intra-operatively has been standard practice in
arthroplasty surgery for many years. Infecting organisms
have become increasingly resistant to the antibiotics pre-
sent in commercially prepared cement and so manual addi-
tion according to sensitivities is essential. Furthermore, we
believe the dose of antibiotic in commercial preparations is
insufficient when contemplating single stage surgery for
infection. Concentrations many times the minimum inhibi-
tory concentration (MIC) are important for the treatment
of periprosthetic infection as organisms are in the sessile
phase and antibiotic concentrations far greater than the
MIC are necessary to achieve a bactericidal effect.30,31
The elution characteristics of many antibiotics have been
studied. Vancomycin has been shown to elute less well than
some antibiotics, but it is effective, and its use was dis-
cussed and recommended at the International Consensus
Meeting on periprosthetic joint infection.32 Commercially
prepared cement which is impregnated with vancomycin is
available and we wished to assess whether this offered any
advantage over the manual addition of vancomycin in the
operating theatre.
The results suggest that our current practice of adding
vancomycin powder manually to PMMA cement contain-
ing gentamicin in the operating theatre can achieve a

greater than fivefold increase in cumulative elution of
vancomycin and greater than twofold increase in the cumu-
lative elution of gentamicin compared with commercially
prepared cement loaded with the same antibiotics. This ‘ad
hoc’ mixing method, however, produces wider variation in
elution compared with the other preparations.
Nugent et al33 showed that increasing the porosity of
antimicrobial-loaded cement by the addition of soluble par-
ticulate poragens, increases the elution of antimicrobials.
Salih et al34 showed that increasing the surface area of anti-
biotic impregnated cement discs, by making multiple inden-
tations in the surface, significantly increases eluction of
antibiotic. We believe that the increased elution of
antibiotics from the ad hoc preparations (group 3), where
the antibiotic was added all at once to the PMMA powder,
is due to clumping of vancomycin within the cement. This
effectively increases the porosity of the cement, exposing a
larger surface area for elution when compared with the
more finely combined commercial Copal G+V and ‘manu-
facturer mix’ preparations (groups 1 and 2 respectively).
Traditionally, when mixing antibiotic impregnated
cement, the use of a vacuum reduces the porosity, and
therefore the potential for elution, of the cement. Meyer et
al35 showed that this does not apply to all cements, and
indeed the effect of vacuum mixing appears to be specific to
product. Our results suggest that mixing the cement in a
vacuum produces small variations in elution of the antbi-
otic which are unlikely to be of clinical relevance.
The manual addition of antibiotic powder to PMMA
cement disrupts its structure and potentially reduces the
mechanical properties. Some authors have investigated this
and concluded that the addition of up to 5% vancomycin
does not substantially reduce the strength.26,27 Lilikakis
and Sutcliffe26 investigated the compression strength of
Palamed G and Copal cements (Heraeus Medical) contain-
ing up to 10% vancomycin. All the samples of cement
exceeded the International Organisation for Standardisa-
tion’s standard for compression strength,36 but Copal spec-
imens containing 10% vancomycin did not significantly
exceed them. They recommend that the addition of up to
5% vancomycin is safe but that care should be taken with
the method of mixing which can significantly alter the com-
pressive strength. In contrast, Laine et al28 found that while
the manual addition of vancomycin reduced the strength of
the cement, the method of mixing did not appear to affect
the strength significantly.
In conclusion, the practice of preparing ‘home-made’ van-
comycin impregnated cement by the mixing, by hand, of
powdered antibiotic into cement powder produces elution
comparable with, if not greater than, commercially available
alternatives, but at a significantly lower cost. We recognise
that these results are derived from an in vitro study and may
not fully reflect the performance of cement in vivo.
Home-made ad hoc mixed vancomycin-impregnated
cement appears to produce the highest level of elution pre-
sumably due to increased porosity, and would be
recommended when preparing cement beads when
mechanical strength is not important. This technique is also
quicker and requires less precision, compared with mixing
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Commercial vancomycin-impregnated cement, or more
careful hand mixing tends to produce a less porous, more
consistent mix, which may be a better compromise between
elution and strength, and thus more suitable for second or
single-stage reconstruction surgery.
Take home message: 
The addition of 2 g vancomycin powder to gentamicin-
impregnated cement by hand (as in the operating theatre), sig-
nificantly increases the elution of both antibiotics compared with com-
mercially prepared cement containing the same antibiotic quantities.
