S
ystemic blood pressure (BP) is a dynamic measure, influ-
enced by multiple factors, and it can vary spontaneously 
from beat to beat, minute to minute, day to day, and from visit to 
visit. The magnitude of this variability can be influenced by fac-
tors affecting regional and systemic circulations, including arte-
rial stiffness, sympathetic tone, release of vasoactive substances, 
and baroreceptor sensitivity.2,3 Visit-to-visit office blood pressure 
variability (OBPV) can also be affected by medication nonad-
herence, class of antihypertensive medication, timing of medica-
tion administration, intensity of BP treatment, and patient age.4–6
An initial report by Rothwell et al7 suggested that OBPV 
was a strong risk factor for stroke, independent of average 
Abstract—Studies of visit-to-visit office blood pressure (BP) variability (OBPV) as a predictor of cardiovascular events and 
death in high-risk patients treated to lower BP targets are lacking. We conducted a post hoc analysis of SPRINT (Systolic 
Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), a well-characterized cohort of participants randomized to intensive (<120 mm Hg) 
or standard (<140 mm Hg) systolic BP targets. We defined OBPV as the coefficient of variation of the systolic BP using 
measurements taken during the 3-,6-, 9-, and 12-month study visits. In our cohort of 7879 participants, older age, female 
sex, black race, current smoking, chronic kidney disease, and coronary disease were independent determinants of higher 
OBPV. Use of thiazide-type diuretics or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers was associated with lower OBPV 
whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker use was associated with higher OBPV. 
There was no difference in OBPV in participants randomized to standard or intensive treatment groups. We found that 
OBPV had no significant associations with the composite end point of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events (n=324 
primary end points; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–1.69, highest versus lowest quintile) 
nor with heart failure or stroke. The highest quintile of OBPV (versus lowest) was associated with all-cause mortality 
(adjusted hazard ratio, 1.92; confidence interval, 1.22–3.03) although the association of OBPV overall with all-cause 
mortality was marginal (P=0.07). Our results suggest that clinicians should continue to focus on office BP control rather 
than on OBPV unless definitive benefits of reducing OBPV are shown in prospective trials.

BP. Since then several other studies seem to have confirmed 
OBPV as an independent predictor of cardiovascular events, 
stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality.8–12 
However, other studies have failed to show an association of 
OBPV with clinical outcomes,13,14 particularly in patients at 
low or intermediate cardiovascular risk.15 Other prior stud-
ies were performed in highly selected populations, targeted 
higher levels of BP, and some failed to adjust for important 
comorbidities. Data from high-risk patients with hypertension 
treated to lower BP targets are lacking.
We conducted a post hoc analysis of SPRINT (Systolic 
Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), a well-characterized, con-
temporary trial that enrolled patients with hypertension, aged 
>50 years at higher than average cardiovascular risk, and ran-
domized patients 1:1 to intensive (<120 mm Hg) versus stan-
dard (<140 mm Hg) systolic BP targets.1,16 We hypothesized 
that higher OBPV during the study follow-up would be asso-
ciated with higher risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause 
mortality.
Methods
Study Participants
SPRINT was a multicenter randomized outcome trial sponsored by 
the National Institutes of Health comparing 2 strategies for control 
of systolic BP and effects on cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and 
kidney outcomes.1,16 Briefly, between November 2010 and March 
2013, participants with treated or untreated systolic BP 130 to 180 
mm Hg and age >75 years, or age ≥50 years with at least one of the 
following indicator of cardiovascular risk were enrolled: evidence of 
clinical or subclinical cardiovascular disease, 10-year Framingham 
risk score for cardiovascular disease events ≥15%, or chronic kidney 
disease (CKD), defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 
20 to 59 mL/min per 1.73 m2 using the 4-variable Modification of 
Diet in Renal Disease equation.17 Participants with a history of stroke, 
diabetes mellitus, polycystic kidney disease, dementia, heart failure, 
nonadherence to medication, estimated glomerular filtration rate < 20 
mL/min per 1.73 m2, or ≥1 g of proteinuria/d (or the equivalent) were 
not eligible for participation. Participants were randomly assigned to 
a standard systolic office BP target (<140 mm Hg) or to an intensive 
systolic BP target (<120 mm Hg).
All participants provided written informed consent for participa-
tion in the trial. The trial was approved by the institutional review 
board at each site and was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov.
Covariates
Trained study personnel ascertained information about participant 
baseline sociodemographic data, comorbid conditions, and antihy-
pertensive medications during the screening or randomization visit. 
Fasting blood and urine samples were collected at that time. All 
assays were performed in a single central laboratory. Serum and urine 
creatinine were measured using an enzymatic procedure and an auto-
analyzer. Urine albumin was measured using an immunoturbidomet-
ric method on an auto-analyzer.
Outcomes
The primary composite outcome in SPRINT and in the current analy-
sis was the first occurrence of a myocardial infarction, acute coronary 
syndrome not resulting in myocardial infarction, stroke, acute decom-
pensated heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes. We also 
examined all-cause mortality, a pre-specified secondary outcome. We 
examined hospitalized heart failure and stroke as separate outcomes 
given reported association of OBPV with these outcomes in prior 
studies.7,8 Outcomes were adjudicated by a committee blinded to the 
treatment group assignments.
Assessment of Visit-to-Visit OBPV
The BP was measured in the clinic 3× in the seated position after 
the participant had rested quietly for 5 minutes in a chair with back 
support, legs uncrossed, with 1 minute between readings using a vali-
dated automated (oscillometric) BP monitor, Omron 907XL (Omron 
Healthcare, Lake Forest, IL). The device was initiated by an observer 
to take 3 sequential BP measurements separated by 1 minute. The 
3 measurements were averaged, and this value was recorded as the 
study visit BP.18
Because SPRINT focused on systolic BP control, our analyses of 
OBPV also focused on systolic BP. For the current analysis, we used 
office BP measurements from the 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month study vis-
its only. We excluded 998 participants who were missing any one of 
these 4 BP measurements. We chose to use these BP measurements 
to avoid changes in BP because of medication titration as much as 
possible. Most participants in the intensive treatment group required 
successive changes in their medical regimen until the 3-month visit1 
to reach target systolic BP. After the 3-month visit, average systolic 
BP remained relatively stable in both groups. In a sensitivity analy-
sis, we also considered 2 alternative methods to calculate OBPV: (1) 
based on 5 BP measurements taken at randomization, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 
12-month study visits; and (2) based on 6 BP measurements taken at 
the 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, 15-, and 18-month study visits.
We excluded 151 participants from the analyses who experienced 
the primary outcome before the 12-month study visit because this 
was the observation period during which we ascertained OBPV. We 
excluded 1 participant who developed end-stage renal disease before 
the 12-month study visit and 332 participants without any follow-up 
after the 12-month study visit.
We defined OBPV as the coefficient of variation (SD of mean sys-
tolic BP divided by mean systolic BP). We then categorized the co-
hort by quintiles of OBPV, with Q1 designated as the lowest quintile 
and Q5 the highest quintile.
Statistical Analysis
We performed multivariable linear regression analysis to identify 
independent correlates of OBPV and considered all variables listed in 
Table 1. We calculated rates (per 1000 person-years) and associated 
95% confidence intervals (CI) for the primary composite outcome 
for heart failure, for stroke, and for death from any cause by quintile 
of OBPV. To examine the association among quintiles of OBPV and 
clinical outcomes and to avoid assumptions of linearity, we conducted 
proportional hazard regression with the lowest quintile as the referent 
(ie, Q1) and present results as an adjusted hazard ratio and 95% CI. 
We used the Wald test to determine whether OBPV overall had a sig-
nificant association with the specified outcomes. We used 2 models: 
a model with adjustments for age, sex, race (black versus non-black), 
and randomized group, and a full model, which additionally included 
baseline CKD status, baseline history of coronary artery disease, cur-
rent smoking status, mean systolic BP, and the number of antihyper-
tensive medication classes received at the 3-month study visit. These 
variables were selected a priori for inclusion in the regression models. 
We did not include all the variables in Table 1 because of concerns 
about collinearity of the variables and possible overfitting of the mod-
els due to relatively few end points.
We were interested in 2 potential effect modifiers of OBPV and 
outcomes: randomized treatment group and baseline CKD status. We, 
therefore, stratified the crude event rates by these subgroups and in-
cluded a multiplicative interaction term in the respective models to 
test for significant interaction.
Given that only 0.47% (n=37) of participants had missing data, we 
conducted complete case analysis. We defined statistical significance 
based on 2-sided P<0.05. All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 
(Cary, NC).
Results
Of the original 9361 participants enrolled in SPRINT, the 
current analysis includes 7879 participants (84%) who met 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The mean OBPV ranged

from 2.7% in the lowest quintile (Q1) to 14.5% in the highest 
quintile (Q5; Table 1). The mean systolic BP was 128 mm Hg 
and mean diastolic BP was 72 mm Hg for the overall cohort 
during the period of OBPV ascertainment.
Correlates of OBPV
Participants in higher quintiles of OBPV were generally at 
higher cardiovascular risk: older, more often female and of 
black race, and had a higher prevalence of coronary artery dis-
ease, CKD, and albuminuria (Table 1). Participants in higher 
quintiles of OBPV required more medications to achieve the 
target BP and were more likely to report use of angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor block-
ers, β-blockers, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and 
less likely to report the use of thiazide-type diuretics or dihy-
dropyridine calcium channel blockers at the 3-month study 
visit (Table 1).
In multivariable-adjusted regression models, we found 
that current smoking, female sex, older age, and black race 
were associated with higher OBPV (Figure 1). Baseline 
CKD and coronary artery disease were associated with 
higher OBPV; history of heart failure, peripheral vascular 
disease, or myocardial infarction were not associated with 
OBPV. Prescription of more antihypertensive medication 
classes and reporting less-than-perfect adherence were asso-
ciated with higher OBPV while randomization group was 
not. Finally, in terms of antihypertensive medication classes, 
reported use of thiazide-type diuretics or dihydropyridine 
calcium channel blockers remained significantly associated 
with lower OBPV whereas reported use of angiotensin-con-
verting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker 
remained significantly associated with higher OBPV; the 
reported use of β-blockers was not associated with OBPV 
(Figure 1).

Association of Visit-to-Visit Variability of BP With 
End Points
Primary Composite End Point
A total of 324 participants experienced the primary compos-
ite end point during an average of 2.3 years (18 122 patient-
years) of follow-up starting from the 12-month visit (Table 2). 
The crude event rate for the primary composite end point was 
15.6/1000 patient-years for participants in the highest quintile 
of OBPV (Q5) compared with a crude event rate of 10.9/1000 
patient-years for participants in Q1 (Figure 2A). However, 
in demographic- and fully-adjusted models, OBPV was not 
significantly associated with the primary composite end point 
(P=0.23; Table 3). Results were not materially changed in sen-
sitivity analyses that calculated OBPV using BP measured at 
randomization, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month study visits or using 
BP measured at the 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, 15-, and 18-month study 
visits (Table S1 in the online-only Data Supplement).
Participants randomized to the standard treatment group 
had a higher incidence of the primary composite end point 
compared with participants randomized to standard treat-
ment (Table 2; Figure S1A and S1B). However, we found 
no evidence that randomized treatment group modified the 
association of OBPV with the primary composite end point 
(Pinteraction=1.0).
Heart Failure and Stroke Hospitalizations
There were 97 heart failure hospitalizations and 77 stroke hos-
pitalizations during the follow-up period (Table 2; Figure 2A).

 Chang et al  Visit-to-Visit BP Variability in SPRINT  755
For both end points, the crude event rates were slightly higher 
in the highest quintile (Q5) of OBPV compared with the low-
est quintile (Q1, Figure 2B and 2C). However, in adjusted 
models, we found no significant association of OBPV with 
heart failure or with stroke hospitalizations (Table 3; Figure 
S1C–S1F) and no evidence that the associations were modi-
fied by randomized treatment group (Pinteraction=0.09 and 0.4 for 
heart failure and stroke, respectively). Results were not mate-
rially changed in sensitivity analyses using alternative study 
visits to calculate OBPV (Table S1).
All-Cause Mortality
We observed higher crude rates of all-cause mortality in the 
highest quintile of OBPV compared with the lowest quintile: 
12.5 versus 5.1/1000 patient-years (Table 2; Figure 2D). 
In demographic-adjusted models, OBPV was significantly 
associated with all-cause mortality (Q5 versus Q1; hazard 
ratio=2.23; 95% CI, 1.42–3.50; overall P=0.007), but the 
association was attenuated in fully adjusted models (hazard 
ratio=1.92; 95% CI, 1.22–3.03; overall P=0.07; Table 3). 
Although the results were not materially changed when 
using OBPV calculated from randomization through the 
12-month study visit, the analysis calculating OBPV using 
BP from 3- to 18-month study visits did show a significant 
association of OBPV with all-cause mortality (P=0.01; 
Table S1).
Participants randomized to the standard treatment group 
had a higher crude rate of all-cause mortality than patients 
randomized to the intensive group (Figure S1G and S1H), but 
we did not observe any interaction of randomized treatment 
group on this association (Pinteraction =0.9).
CKD Subgroup Analyses
Participants with baseline CKD generally experienced more 
heart failure and stroke hospitalizations and more deaths 
compared with participants without baseline CKD (Table S2; 
Figure S2). In multivariable-adjusted models, CKD was asso-
ciated with significantly higher risks of the primary composite 
end point and heart failure (Table S3). However, there was no 
evidence that baseline CKD status significantly modified the 
association of OBPV and any of the 4 end points (Pinteraction>0.4 
for all end points).
Discussion
In this analysis of SPRINT, we found that OBPV was not signif-
icantly associated with the primary composite end point of fatal 
and nonfatal cardiovascular events or with heart failure or stroke 
hospitalizations. Results were consistent between our primary 
analysis (which calculated OBPV from the 4 BP measurements 
taken from 3- to 12-month study visit), and sensitivity analy-
ses using OBPV calculated from randomization through the 
12-month visit and from 3- to the 18-month visit. In our primary 
analysis, we found that the highest quintile of OBPV (versus 
the lowest quintile) was associated with all-cause mortality, but 
the association was attenuated and no longer significant after 
adjusting for other factors. In sensitivity analyses using alter-
native methods of calculating OBPV, the association of OBPV 
with all-cause mortality was strengthened.

Our results contrast with other studies using data from 
randomized clinical trials that showed a significant asso-
ciation of OBPV with cardiovascular events. For example, 
Rothwell et al7 examined data from the ASCOT-BPLA 
(Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial Blood Pressure 
Lowering Arm), which randomized patients with hyperten-
sion and ≥3 additional cardiovascular risk factors (but no 
coronary artery disease) to either an amlodipine-based or 
atenolol-based regimen; target clinic BP was set at <140/90 
mm Hg or <130/80 in patients with diabetes mellitus.7 These 
authors found that the highest decile of OBPV (defined by 
coefficient of variation) had a 2.06-fold (95% CI, 1.28–3.31) 
higher unadjusted risk of stroke and 1.57-fold (95% CI, 1.14–
2.16) higher risk of coronary events compared with the lowest 
decile. There has also been a post hoc analysis on OBPV and 
outcomes using data from the ALLHAT (Antihypertensive 
and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial), 
which randomly assigned patients with hypertension and ≥1 
additional cardiovascular risk factor to receive amlodipine, 
lisinopril, or chlorthalidone, targeting a BP <140/90 mm Hg.8 
In ALLHAT, the highest quintile of OBPV (defined as the 
SD of systolic BP) was associated with a 1.30-fold (95% CI, 
1.06–1.59) higher risk of fatal or nonfatal coronary heart dis-
ease, again, in contrast to our findings.
One reason for why our findings differed from ASCOT-
BPLA and ALLHAT could stem from the lower achieved 
systolic BP in SPRINT (128 mm Hg for the overall cohort), 
which may have led to lower OBPV in our cohort (7.8%). 
For example, in Rothwell’s reanalysis of different trials,7 the 
mean achieved systolic BP was ≈145 mm Hg, and the OBPV 
across the 4 trials included (defined as coefficient of varia-
tion) ranged from 8.2 to 10.0, higher than the mean OBPV 
in our analysis. Importantly, however, we did not find any 
evidence that the randomized treatment group modified the 
(nonsignificant) association of OBPV with the risk for the 
primary composite end point or heart failure. Moreover, an 
analysis of the European Lacidipine Study on Atherosclerosis 
trial15 that had a higher mean systolic BP (163 mm Hg) but 
lower median OBPV (5.7%) when compared with SPRINT 
also found no significant association of OBPV with cardio-
vascular outcomes. Thus, achieved BP alone does not account 
for differences among the studies. A recent comprehensive 
systematic review of >312 analyses of OBPV with cardiovas-
cular events or death found that 42% showed no significant 
association12 while 58% did show a significant association. 
Heterogeneity in terms of patient characteristics, variables 
included in adjusted models, number of visits used to calcu-
late OBPV (from as few as 39–3519 or more), metrics of OBPV 
used, and modeling of OBPV as a continuous or categorical 
variable could also contribute to the mixed results.20 Clearly, 
standardized definitions and approaches to OBPV are needed.
We found that SPRINT participants who were older, current 
smokers, and with coronary artery disease had higher OBPV— 
clearly higher risk patients, suggesting that OBPV may be a 
marker of high risk but not necessarily causally related to out-
comes. Baseline mild-to-moderate CKD was associated not only 
with higher OBPV but also with markedly higher crude rates of 
the primary composite end point and death from any cause com-
pared with participants without CKD, consistent with numerous 
previous studies.21,22 The contribution of these variables to the 
risk of death from any cause was evident in our analysis because 
the association of OBPV with all-cause mortality was significant 
but attenuated in fully adjusted models that included CKD (haz-
ard ratio, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.22–3.03; Q5 versus Q1). Our results 
are consistent with the findings from ALLHAT, which showed a 
1.58-fold (95% CI, 1.32–1.90) higher risk of all-cause mortality 
for patients in the highest quintile of OBPV compared with the 
lowest quintile in fully adjusted models.8
Participants with less-than-perfect medication adherence 
had higher OBPV in our analysis, which is consistent with 
previous studies.6,11 Also consistent with previously reported 
results, we found that use of thiazide diuretics or dihydro-
pyridine calcium channel blockers was associated with lower 
OBPV whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or

angiotensin II receptor blockers use was associated with higher 
OBPV. Similar findings were observed in ASCOT-BPLA, 
where participants randomized to the amlodipine-based group 
had lower OBPV compared with the atenolol-based group.23 
Interestingly, in ASCOT-BPLA, the reduction in OBPV com-
pletely accounted for the lower risk of stroke and coronary 
events found in the amlodipine group as compared with the 
atenolol group.23 In contrast, participants in ALLHAT ran-
domized to receive chlorthalidone and amlodipine had lower 
OBPV compared with patients randomized to the lisinopril 
arm, but there was no difference in cardiovascular outcomes.24 
It is possible that calcium channel blockers and diuretics pro-
vide more consistent and reliable BP control, thus lowering 
OBPV, but the exact mechanism remains uncertain. Moreover, 
whether lowering OBPV per se can reduce the occurrence of 
cardiovascular events independently of BP lowering effects 
has yet to be tested directly in prospective clinical trials.
The strengths of this analysis include but are not limited 
to the following: inclusion of a large, diverse hypertensive 
population at high risk for cardiovascular events; measure-
ments of BP that were carefully ascertained to limit over- or 
underestimation of clinic BP; assessment of OBPV starting 
from the 3-month visit so as to avoid period when medica-
tions were most actively titrated; models adjusted for random-
ized treatment group, demographics, and other comorbidities; 
and inclusion of information on medication adherence. There 
are, however, several limitations to this analysis as well. First, 
OBPV may have differential association with different clini-
cal outcomes (ie, stroke).7,25 SPRINT was not powered to 
examine individual components of the primary end point, and 
there were relatively few heart failure and stroke events in 
SPRINT. Second, we did not have information on medication 
timing relative to the study visit, which could have affected 
OBPV measurements. Third, although SPRINT was diverse 
in terms of age, sex, race, and inclusion of patients with base-
line kidney and heart disease, the study excluded patients 
with diabetes mellitus or history of stroke, which may limit 
the generalizability of our findings to those important patient 
populations.
Perspectives
In summary, in this analysis of SPRINT, we found no signifi-
cant association of OBPV with cardiovascular outcomes. The 
association of OBPV with all-cause mortality was sensitive to 
the other variables included in the models and to the particular 
study visits used to define OBPV. Our results suggest that cli-
nicians should continue to focus on absolute BP targets rather 
than on efforts to reduce OBPV until and if definitive benefits 
of reducing OBPV are shown in prospective randomized trials.

What Is New?
• This is one of the few studies to examine visit-to-visit office-based blood 
pressure variability (OBPV) in patients at high cardiovascular risk.
• SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) is unique in that par-
ticipants were treated to lower blood pressure targets than in previous 
studies on this topic.
• OBPV is not significantly associated with cardiovascular events in this 
high-risk patient population.
What Is Relevant?
• SPRINT participants who were older, current smokers, had coronary 
artery disease or chronic kidney disease had higher OBPV, suggesting 
that OBPV is a marker of high risk but not necessarily causally related to 
poorer outcomes.
• Clinicians should continue to focus on office blood pressure control rath-
er than on efforts to reduce OBPV.
Summary
In this post hoc analysis of SPRINT, we found no significant asso-
ciation of OBPV with cardiovascular outcomes. The association of 
OBPV with all-cause mortality was sensitive to the other variables 
included in the models and to the particular study visits used to 
define OBPV. Definitive benefits of reducing OBPV from prospective 
randomized trials are needed before OBPV can become a target of 
therapy.
