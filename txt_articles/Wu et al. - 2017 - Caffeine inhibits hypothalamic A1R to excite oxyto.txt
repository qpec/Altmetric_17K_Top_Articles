Caffeine, an antagonist of the adenosine receptor A1R, is used as a dietary supplement to
reduce body weight, although the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we report that
adenosine level in the cerebrospinal fluid, and hypothalamic expression of A1R, are increased
in the diet-induced obesity (DIO) mouse. We find that mice with overexpression of A1R in the
neurons of paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus are hyperphagic, have glucose
intolerance and high body weight. Central or peripheral administration of caffeine reduces the
body weight of DIO mice by the suppression of appetite and increasing of energy expenditure.
We also show that caffeine excites oxytocin expressing neurons, and blockade of the action of
oxytocin significantly attenuates the effect of caffeine on energy balance. These data suggest
that caffeine inhibits A1Rs expressed on PVN oxytocin neurons to negatively regulate energy
balance in DIO mice.

n the United States, the overall prevalence of obesity in
adults reached 37.7% during the years 2013–2014 (ref. 1).
The
population
of
obese
individuals
has
also
been
increasing rapidly in the developing countries. For example, in
China, the percentage of obese adults has increased from 3.6%
in 1992 to 12.2% in 2012 (ref. 2). Obesity is a risk factor
for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and certain types of
cancers.
Currently,
medical
treatment
of
obesity
includes
pharmacological and surgical approaches3. Only three drugs
have been approved by FDA for long-term management of
obesity3.
Consumption of caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine), one of the
active ingredients in coffee, tea and soft drinks, has been linked to
the long-term reduction of body weight gain4, however, the
underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Caffeine is a
recognized antagonist for adenosine receptor, which includes 4
subtypes in mammals: A1R, A2AR, A2BR and A3R. Adenosine
receptors are G protein-coupled receptors, with A1R and A3R
mainly coupled to the inhibitory Gi or Go protein, and A2AR as
well as A2BR mostly coupled to the stimulatory Gs, Gq or Golf
protein5–8. In addition, adenosine receptors could regulate other
intracellular signalling molecules, such as mitogen-activated
protein kinase, to modulate cell physiology6. A1R is widely
distributed in the body, with particularly high level of expression
in the brain. A2AR is abundantly expressed in the striatum5,7.
A2BR is also widely expressed throughout the body, but the
overall abundance is low. A3R is expressed at low levels in most
tissues.
Adenosine, the natural agonist for adenosine receptors, is a
prototypic neuromodulator9. In the nervous system, adenosine acts
on A1R to suppress neuronal activity, mainly through the regulation
of downstream signalling molecules, such as the inhibition of
protein kinases A and C, phospholipase C, calcium channels and
activation of potassium channels5–8. In contrast, activation of A2AR
or A2BR stimulates neuronal activity by increasing the activity of
protein kinase A and/or mitogen-activated protein kinase5–8.
Adenosine receptor is involved in an array of physiological and
pathological
processes,
including
memory,
sleep,
anxiety,
aggression, locomotion, pain, cardiac and immune functions, as
well as neurodegenerative diseases5,10. However, the precise role of
neuronal adenosine receptor in energy balance remains less well
understood.
The hypothalamus is the central regulator of energy balance in
animals. Previously, studies have identified several key hypotha-
lamic nuclei that are involved in the regulation of energy
homeostasis (for example, paraventricular nucleus (PVN), arcuate
(Arc), ventromedial and dorsomedial (DMH) nuclei)11,12. Several
neuropeptides synthesized and released from the neurons in these
nuclei, such as oxytocin (Oxt) in the PVN, Agouti-related peptide
(AgRP) and a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone in the Arc, have
also been identified as the key neurotransmitters regulating energy
balance11,12. In these neuropeptide-synthesizing neurons, studies
have discovered several key genes and signalling pathway that are
involved in energy balance and/or the pathogenesis of dietary
obesity, such as, PTP1b (ref. 13), IKKb (ref. 14), ER stress14,15,
JNK1 (ref. 16), GABA (ref. 17), Synaptotagmin-4 (ref. 18), PPARg
(refs 19,20), NOS1 (ref. 21), Mitofusin22 and P2Y6 (ref. 23).
However, it is still unclear whether neuronal adenosine receptor is
involved in the regulation of these neuropeptides.
Here, we show that there are aberrations of the adenosine
receptor signalling in the hypothalami of diet-induced obesity
(DIO) mice. Mice with ectopic expression of A1R in the PVN
neurons gained more body weights and consumed more foods
than controls. Central or peripheral caffeine treatment reduces
the body weights of DIO mice. Moreover, caffeine treatment
improves glucose intolerance and lipid outcomes in these mice.
Central or peripheral administration of caffeine excites neurons
in the PVN. Lastly, we show that Oxt mediates, whereas blockade
of the action of Oxt, but not arginine vasopressin (AVP) or
thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), significantly attenuates
caffeine’s effect of negatively regulating energy balance. We have
therefore uncovered a role for hypothalamic adenosine signalling
in the regulation of energy balance, and found that caffeine
regulates energy metabolism by relieving A1R-mediated inhibi-
tion of PVN Oxt neurons.
Results
Elevated levels of adenosine in the DIO mice. Adenosine is a
natural ligand for adenosine receptors. To examine whether there
is any change of adenosine in the DIO animals, we fed male C57
BL/6 mice with a regular chow or high-fat diet (HFD). After 24
weeks of dietary treatment, we analysed the plasma adenosine
level by using a sensitive fluorometric Elisa. The results showed
that HFD feeding led to significantly elevated plasma adenosine
level (Fig. 1a), and the plasma adenosine levels were well
correlated with the body weights (Fig. 1b), suggesting adenosine
metabolism was abnormal in the DIO mice. In addition, we
measured the adenosine level in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of
24 weeks HFD-fed mice. The CSF adenosine levels in these mice
were evidently higher than the controls (Fig. 1c), and were also
correlated with body weights (Fig. 1d). Moreover, when the
hypothalamic adenosine was examined, we found that its
contents in DIO mice were significantly elevated compared to
chow-fed controls (Fig. 1e). Hypothalamic adenosine contents
were also correlated to the body weights (Fig. 1f). To examine
whether the change of brain adenosine occurs before the animal’s
body weight is significantly increased, we measured the CSF levels
in chow- or 2 weeks HFD-fed mice, at which time the animals’
body weights did not significantly differ (Chow, 21.50±0.88 g;
HFD, 22.41±0.79 g. P ¼ 0.45, two-tailed Student’s t-test.). We
found that the mean adenosine level was moderately, but sig-
nificantly increased in HFD-fed animals (Supplementary Fig. 1a).
Moreover, to exclude the effect of diet, we analysed the CSF
adenosine levels in chow-fed ob/ob and wild-type mice. The result
demonstrated that CSF level of adenosine was also elevated in the
ob/ob mice (Supplementary Fig. 1b), indicating that alteration of
brain adenosine is related to obesity, but not diet. Together, these
results suggest that hypothalamic adenosine signalling might be
involved in dietary obesity.
To examine the effect of intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.)
administered adenosine on food consumption, we implanted
cannula directed to the third ventricle of C57 BL/6 mice. After the
animals were fully recovered, we injected control artificial
cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) or adenosine to the brain. We found
that adenosine at doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg slightly, but significantly
increased animal’s appetite (Fig. 1g).
Overexpression of A1R in the PVN of DIO mice. Next, we
examined the expression of adenosine receptors in the hypothalami
of DIO mice. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)
result demonstrated that A1R, but not other subtypes, was
significantly increased in the DIO mice (Fig. 1h). Western blot
analysis further confirmed that A1R is overexpressed in the
hypothalami of these animals (Fig. 1i; Supplementary Fig. 16). To
verify these results, we did immunofluorescence staining on mouse
brain sections, after confirming the specificity of A1R antibody
(Supplementary Fig. 1c). Interestingly, we found that there was
more aggregated fluorescence of A1R in the PVN of DIO mouse
(Fig. 1j), indicating higher level of expression in this region. The
immunofluorescence results did not reveal any significant change
of A1R in other hypothalamic nuclei and extra-hypothalamic

(Supplementary

We
also
examined
the
expression of A2AR, A2BR and A3R in the hypothalamus by
immunofluorescence but did not notice any obvious changes
(Supplementary Figs 3–5). Lastly, to test whether central A1R sig-
nalling is involved in the regulation of energy balance, we delivered
N6-Cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), a selective agonist of A1R, to
mouse brains by the i.c.v. route. Mice administered CPA consumed
more chow foods than the controls (Fig. 1k), demonstrating that
brain A1R regulates animal’s appetite.
Overexpression of A1R in PVN neurons leads to obesity. To
study whether A1R is expressed in the neurons of PVN, we
performed a double immunofluorescence staining on brain section.
Indeed, we found A1R was expressed in most of the neurons
(Fig. 2a), suggesting it may regulate energy balance via the action
in these cells.
Next, we asked whether overexpression of A1R in PVN neurons
would affect systemic energy balance. Besides, given a recent report
showing that A1R in the Arc played a role in short-term regulation

 of food intake mainly by using chemogenetic approach24, we also
included the Arc and DMH in our observation. We generated two
lentiviral plasmids in which the expression of mouse A1R cDNA or
enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP, as control) was driven by
the neuron-specific Synapsin promoter25. These two plasmids were
designated as A1R-Lenti or Ctrl-Lenti, respectively. We delivered the
lentiviruses to mouse PVN, Arc or DMH by utilising a stereotaxic
instrument. After confirming the success of surgery (Fig. 2b;
Supplementary Figs 6 and 7a,d), we monitored the animal’s body
weights and food intakes. We found that mice with ectopic
expression of A1R in the PVN, but not Arc or DMH, gained more
body weights than the controls (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 7b,e).
Mice with overexpression of A1R in the PVN were intolerant to
glucose challenge (Fig. 2d,e) and hypertriglyceridemic (Fig. 2f).
In addition, mice with overexpression of A1R in PVN were

(Fig.

suggesting
the
reduction of energy expenditure. Indeed, calorimetry analysis
showed that these mice consumed significantly less O2 and
produced
less

as
well
as
heat
than
the
controls
(Fig. 2k; Supplementary Fig. 8a,b). We also extended our
observation to arousal and anxiety-like behaviour. However, the
data did not reveal any significant changes (Supplementary
Fig. 8c–g).
We
were
also
interested
to
know
whether
reduced
expression of A1R in PVN would affect energy balance. To do
this, we generated a lentiviral plasmid that expresses short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting mouse A1R (designated as
shA1R-Lenti). After confirming the efficiency of knockdown
(Fig. 2l), we delivered the shA1R-Lenti or control (shCtrl-Lenti)
virus
to
mouse
PVN.
As
expected,
mice
with
reduced
expression of A1R in PVN consumed significantly less foods
and gained less body weights (Fig. 2m,n). Collectively, these data
reveal an anabolism-promoting role of A1R expressed in the PVN
neurons.
Caffeine targets PVN neuronal A1R to regulate energy balance.
Given that hypothalamic A1R is involved in energy balance (Figs 1
and 2), next, we asked whether caffeine, the antagonist of
adenosine receptors, would directly regulate the activities of
hypothalamic neurons. Initially, we found that i.c.v. administration
of caffeine at doses Z10 mg per mouse significantly reduced
animal’s appetite (Supplementary Fig. 9a). Hence, we chose the
dose of 10mg per mouse whenever caffeine is administered via the
i.c.v. route, unless otherwise noted. Administration of caffeine into
mouse brain significantly increased the numbers of c-Fos þ cells in
the PVN, Arc and DMH nuclei (Fig. 3a,b), indicating that caffeine
stimulates the activities of neurons in the hypothalamic nuclei
involved in energy balance control.
The aforementioned results led us to ask whether caffeine
modulates energy balance through its action on hypothalamic
A1R. To do this, we injected Ctrl-Lenti or A1R-Lenti virus into the
PVN, Arc or DMH nucleus. In addition, the animals were
implanted cannula directed toward third ventricles, and allowed
to fully recover from surgeries. We then injected aCSF or 10 mg of
caffeine into the brain. Intriguingly, overexpression of A1R in
PVN, but not Arc or DMH, significantly abolished caffeine’s
effects on appetite (Fig. 3c,e,g) and body weight balance
(Fig. 3d,f,h), demonstrating that PVN is a critical site for caffeine
to regulate energy balance.
Since A1R is mainly coupled to Gi/o protein, its antagonism will
evoke the activity of neurons. Hence, central administration of
caffeine would excite A1R þ neurons in the PVN. To test this
prediction, we i.c.v. administered control or caffeine into mouse
brains. After double immunostaining by using antibodies against
A1R and c-Fos, we found that caffeine readily excites A1R þ cells
in the PVN, shown by the greater number of cells expressing both
c-Fos and A1R (Fig. 3i,j), and the increased ratio of double
positive cells among A1R þ cells (Fig. 3k).
Brain administration of caffeine ameliorates dietary obesity.
Given that A1R is overexpressed in the PVN of DIO mice
(Fig. 1h–j), and PVN is the key hypothalamic region for caffeine
to regulate energy metabolism (Fig. 3c–h), it seems intuitive that
caffeine might counteract obesity through its action in the PVN.
To test this, we performed third ventricle cannulation surgery on
HFD-fed mice. After that, we i.c.v. injected aCSF or 10 mg of
caffeine to these animals on a daily basis. Mice administered
caffeine in the brain gained significantly less body weights than
the controls on day 7 of the treatment and thereafter (Fig. 4a).
The adipocyte sizes of epididymal white adipose tissue were much
smaller than the controls (Fig. 4b–d). In addition, plasma
triglycerides (TG) levels of caffeine-infused mice were lower than
the controls (Fig. 4e). Glucose tolerance of these mice was also
improved (Fig. 4f,g).
To elucidate the causes of caffeine-related reduction of dietary
obesity, we measured both energy intake and expenditure. We
found that mice given caffeine consumed significantly less HFD
(Fig. 4h) but had more spontaneous wheel-running activities
(Fig. 4i). Mice administered caffeine immediately before the dark
cycle tended to have shorter duration of food intake, but did not
spend more time on non-food intake-related locomotor activities
(Supplementary Fig. 9b,c), indicating that the increasing of
spontaneous locomotor activity (Fig. 4i) did not directly contribute
to the reduction of food intake (Fig. 4h). In addition, after caffeine
treatment, the insterscapular temperature and expression levels of
thermogenesis-promoting genes in the brown adipose tissue were
significantly elevated (Fig. 4j,k; Supplementary Fig. 9d). Indirect
calorimetry analysis showed that brain administration of caffeine
promoted the consumption of O2, and the production of CO2 as
well as heat (Fig. 4l–n). To examine the effect of 11-day caffeine
treatment on the expression of adenosine receptors, we performed
western blot analysis on hypothalamic samples. The result did not
show any significant change between the two treatment groups
(Supplementary Fig. 9e).
Since PVN is the major site for A1R and caffeine to regulate
energy balance (Figs 2 and 3), we were interested to know
whether injection of caffeine directly to this nucleus would affect
appetite and body weight balance. Caffeine administered at
r0.5 mg per mouse did not show a significant effect (food intake:
control, 3.11±0.26 g d � 1; caffeine (0.5 mg), 2.50±0.40 g d � 1.
P ¼ 0.18, two-tailed Student’s t-test). However, the food intakes
and body weights of mice given caffeine at the dose of 1 mg were
significantly reduced in comparison with the controls (Fig. 4o,p),
further confirming PVN is the key brain region for caffeine to
counteract obesity.
We also analysed the effect of i.c.v. administered caffeine on
anxiety-like behaviour and arousal. In the open field test, mice
acutely given caffeine tended to stay longer in the central region
(P ¼ 0.07, Supplementary Fig. 9f), suggesting an anxiolytic function
of caffeine. We did not notice any significant changes in the
elevated plus maze and light/dark box tests (Supplementary
Fig. 9g,h). It is well recognized that caffeine is a psychoactive
agent that promotes wakefulness26. However, considering that the
main purpose of our study is to investigate the roles of caffeine and
hypothalamic adenosine receptor in energy balance, we performed
most of the injections of reagents immediately before the onset of
dark cycle, because for C57 BL/6 mice, 67–83% of the amount of
food was consumed during this period27. In contrast, studies
focusing on arousal were mostly conducted during the light cycle,
mainly because mouse is a nocturnal species. Nonetheless, i.c.v.
administration of caffeine immediately before the dark cycle did
not alter the wakefulness time during the first 4 h of the following
light cycle (Supplementary Fig. 9i,j), demonstrating that caffeine
administered at this time point did not affect the sleep/wakefulness
homeostasis. Taken together, these data demonstrate that central
caffeine treatment reduces the body weights and improves
obesity-related symptoms in the DIO mice.

administered at doses Z60 mg kg � 1 by oral gavage significantly
suppressed the appetite of DIO mice (Supplementary Fig. 10a), so

 We found that peripherally administered caffeine significantly
reduced the food intakes (Fig. 5j), and increased the wheel-
running activities of DIO mice (Fig. 5k). Mice receiving caffeine
consumed more O2, and produced more CO2 as well as heat
(Fig. 5l–n). We also analysed the expression of adenosine
receptors in the hypothalami of 2-week caffeine or saline-treated
mice by using western blot, but did not find any significant
change (Supplementary Fig. 10d). Together, the results demon-
strate that peripheral caffeine treatment ameliorates obesity
through both the reduction of food intake and the promotion
of energy expenditure.
Blocking Oxt attenuates caffeine’s effect on energy balance. We
have shown that caffeine regulates energy balance mainly through
its action on A1R in the PVN (Fig. 3c–h). It is well recognized that
in the PVN there are several types of peptidergic neurons, such as
Oxt,
AVP,
TRH
and
corticotropin-releasing
hormone
(CRH)12,18,28. Next, we investigated the type(s) of neurons that
express A1R in the PVN by double immunofluorescence staining
with antibodies against A1R and Neurophysin I (NP-Oxt),
Neurophysin II (NP-AVP), TRH or CRH. NP-Oxt and NP-AVP
are carrier proteins that are specifically associated with Oxt
(Supplementary Fig. 11a) or AVP, respectively29,30. The data
demonstrated that A1R was expressed in both the Oxt (NP-Oxtþ)
and AVP (NP-AVP þ) neurons (Fig. 6a). A1R was also expressed in
very few TRH, but not CRH neurons (Supplementary Fig. 11b,c).
To identify the PVN neuropeptide(s) that mediate caffeine’s effects
on energy balance, we performed the following pharmacological
study. We i.c.v. administered Oxt receptor (OTR) antagonist,
L-368,899, or antibodies against AVP or TRH to mouse brains.
An hour later, aCSF or 10mg of caffeine was infused into mouse
brains
via
the
same
route.
The
results
demonstrated
that
pre-treatment with Oxt receptor antagonist L-368,899, but not
AVP or TRH antibody, significantly attenuated caffeine’s effects on
food intake and body weight (Fig. 6b–g), indicating Oxt is the key
mediator of caffeine’s effect on energy metabolism.
We were also interested to find out the type(s) of neurons in
which the expression of A1R was elevated in the DIO mice
(Fig. 1j). To do this, we employed single-cell RT-PCR to examine
the messenger RNA levels of A1R in specific neurons isolated
from PVN. Interestingly, the messenger RNA level of A1R was
significantly elevated in the Oxt, but not the other two types of
neurons (Fig. 6h), suggesting A1R might play a role in DIO
through its action in the Oxt neuron.
Oxt neuron-specific knockdown of A1R mitigates DIO. To
further explore the Oxt neuron-specific role of A1R in DIO, we
constructed
a
Cre-inducible,
A1R-targeted
shRNA
lentiviral
expression plasmid based on the pSico vector (Supplementary
Fig. 12a)31. We designated this and the control plasmids as shA1R-
pSico and shCtrl-pSico, respectively. Double immunofluorescence
staining revealed that, after the transduction of shA1R-pSico
lentivirus, expression of A1R in PVN Oxt neurons reduced B40%
(Supplementary Fig. 12b,c). We then injected the shA1R-pSico or
control lentivirus into the PVN of Oxt-Cre mice32, respectively.
The results showed that Oxt neuron-specific knockdown of A1R
significantly reduced the food intakes and body weight gains of
mice under HFD treatment (Fig. 7a,b).
Effect of caffeine or A1R on Oxt release from the PVN.
Previously, we have shown that impaired Oxt release from PVN is
involved in the pathogenesis of DIO18. Next, we asked whether
caffeine or A1R would regulate the releasing of Oxt. We first
examined the Oxt neuron activity after the mice had been i.c.v.
administered caffeine or aCSF. We were able to find that caffeine
greatly stimulated the activities of these neurons in the PVN
(Fig. 7c–e), suggesting that it may evoke Oxt release. We then
performed an Oxt release assay to examine this possibility. When
PVN slices dissected from DIO mice were treated with caffeine
(2 mmol l � 1), the ex vivo Oxt releasing rate was significantly
increased
(Fig.
7f).
Indeed,
caffeine
seemed
to
augment
Oxt-induced
OTR
signalling
in
the
mouse
brain
(Supplementary Fig. 13), although A1R did not interact directly
with OTR (Supplementary Fig. 14). Moreover, when we induced
overexpression of A1R in the PVN of chow-fed mice by the
injection of A1R-Lenti virus, the rates of spontaneous and high
potassium evoked Oxt release were significantly attenuated
(Fig. 7g). The modulation of Oxt release by A1R does not seem
to be a direct effect, because double immunofluorescence staining
of NP-Oxt and A1R did not reveal any significant co-localization
in the nucleus of solitary tract (Supplementary Fig. 15), a region
heavily innervated by Oxt neurons.
Lastly, we interrogated the role of brain Oxt in A1R-mediated
regulation of energy balance. To do this, we injected A1R-Lenti or
Ctrl-Lenti virus to the PVN, and implanted cannulas directed to
the third ventricle of chow-fed mice. After the animals were
recovered from surgeries, we administered control or Oxt
(1 mg per mouse) into the brain. Consistent with our previous
result (Fig. 2g), mice consumed more foods when A1R was
overexpressed in the PVN neurons. However, treatment with Oxt
significantly abolished this effect (Fig. 7h), demonstrating that it
indeed antagonizes A1R’s effect on energy balance.
Discussion
Coffee consumption has been linked to better metabolic out-
comes4,33, however, the underlying mechanisms remain largely
unknown. Caffeine is one of the major active ingredients in coffee,
tea and soft drinks, and hypothalamus in the brain plays a
fundamental role in controlling animal’s energy homeostasis11,12.
Here, we found that adenosine levels were increased in the plasma,
CSF and hypothalamus (Fig. 1a–f), and A1R was overexpressed in
the PVN Oxt neurons of DIO mice (Fig. 6h). Ectopic expression of
A1R in PVN neurons enhanced appetite and promoted body
weight gain (Fig. 2c,g). Central or peripheral administration of
caffeine negatively regulated energy balance in the DIO mice,
demonstrated by the reduction of food intake and body weight, as
well as the increasing of energy expenditure (Figs 4 and 5). In both
treatments, administration of caffeine improved the glucose
tolerance and decreased the plasma TG levels in DIO mice
(Figs 4 and 5). Moreover, we found that caffeine targets the A1R
expressed in PVN Oxt neurons to regulate energy metabolism
(Figs 6 and 7; Supplementary Fig. 11). Collectively, our results
demonstrate that central caffeine treatment negatively regulates
energy balance by promoting the release of Oxt.
Caffeine is a CNS stimulant and antagonist of adenosine
receptors. To date, four subtypes of adenosine receptors have
been identified in mammals5. Characterization of the expression
pattern showed that adenosine receptors are widely distributed in
the body5. Within the CNS, both A1R and A2AR show high levels
of expression5, albeit that the A2AR is enriched in the basal
ganglia, whereas A1R is widely distributed on neurons5,7. In this
study, we found that A1R is expressed in the hypothalamic nuclei
regulating energy balance (Figs 1j and 2a), suggesting that it may
regulate systemic energy balance via actions in the hypothalamus.
We examined the four subtypes of adenosine receptors by
utilising qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence.
Interestingly,
we
found
that
only
A1R
showed
elevated
expression in the PVN of DIO mice (Fig. 1h–j; Supplementary
Figs 2–5). Moreover, caffeine-evoked excitation of a significant

 agreement with the neuronal inhibitory function of this receptor.
Indeed,
previous
studies
displayed
that
agonist-mediated
activation of A1R decreased the neuronal activities in the dorsal
root ganglia34, lateral horn35, entorhinal cortex36, whereas
caffeine could facilitate the release of glutamate from neurons
in the cerebral cortex37. Furthermore, overexpression of A1R in
the
PVN,
but
not
Arc
or
DMH
neurons
significantly
attenuated caffeine’s effect on energy metabolism (Fig. 3c–h),
indicating that A1R expressed in the PVN is a critical target for
caffeine
to
control
energy
balance.
Together,
our
results
demonstrate
that
the
anti-obesity
effect
of
centrally
administered caffeine is primarily mediated by antagonizing
A1R expressed in PVN neurons.
A
recent
study
reported
that
adenosine
released
from
astrocytes in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) inhibits food
intake of mice24. The authors found that in mice fed a regular
chow diet, acute activation of MBH astrocytes by using
chemogenetic approach suppresses the firing rates of Agrp
neurons. The inhibitory function of adenosine/A1R is consistent
with our result showing that A1R plays an inhibitory role in
neuropeptide exocytosis (Fig. 7g). However, it seems unlikely that
the inhibition of Agrp neurons by astrocyte-released adenosine
could play a role in dietary obesity, because under HFD feeding,
mice tend to accumulate astrocytes in the MBH38. Hence, the
physiological and pathological significance of such a regulatory
system is not yet clear.
In the present study, other than A1R, we did not find any
significant change of the hypothalamic expression of adenosine
receptors between the DIO and chow-fed mice (Fig. 1h,i;
Supplementary Figs 3–5). Previously, it had been shown that

 striatal A2AR plays a critical role in habit formation39–41, and
stimulation of A2AR reduces the affinity of agonist binding to
dopamine receptor D2 (ref. 42). Given that downregulation of
striatal D2R is required in addiction-like reward dysfunction and
compulsive eating in obese rats43, it is conceivable that A2AR
expressed in the striatum might be involved in the pathogenesis
of DIO. Antagonism of A2AR by caffeine would presumably
increase the activity of D2R, and consequently alleviate the food
addiction of DIO animals.
Neuropeptides are a subfamily of neurotransmitter playing a
pivotal
role
in
the
regulation
of
energy
homeostasis11,12.
Dysregulation of hypothalamic neuropeptides at various levels
is linked to obesogenesis18,44. Since we found that PVN is the
main brain region for caffeine to regulate energy metabolism
(Fig. 3c–h), we focused on this particular structure, aiming to
elaborate the mechanism of caffeine-A1R interaction on energy
metabolism. Our data showed that A1R was expressed in the Oxt

 caffeine led to the excitation of Oxt neurons (Fig. 7c–e).
Moreover, the results of two complementary experiments show
that the caffeine-A1R signalling system does use Oxt to suppress
appetite and reduce body weight (Figs 6b–g and 7h), which is
consistent
with
the
anorexic
effect
of
Oxt
(refs
18,27).
Interestingly, previous studies have shown that A1R played a
crucial role in the regulation of peptide and hormone release.
For
example,
activation
of
A1R
by
selective
agonist,
2-chloroadenosine, suppressed KCl evoked release of Dynorphin
A(1-8) from the hippocampal synaptosomes45.
Endogenous
adenosine was able to cause tonic inhibition of transient Ca2 þ
current and evoked exocytosis in neurohypophysial terminals46.
In addition, stimulation of A1R in the spinal cord inhibits the
exocytosis of calcitonin gene-related peptide47. These studies
unequivocally
showed
that
A1R
inhibits
the
release
of
neuropeptides and hormones. Taken together, the evidences
demonstrate that Oxt is a critical mediator of caffeine-induced
negative regulation of energy balance in the DIO mice.
There are few available medications for the long-term treatment
of obesity3. Efficacy and safety are two major concerns over anti-
obesity medications. Caffeine, however, has been deemed safe when
consumed up to 400mg d � 1 for the general population48. In
agreement with our observations (Figs 4j–n and 5l–n), both the
energy expenditure and skin temperature of human subjects
administered caffeine were increased compared to controls49,50.
Moreover, the combinatorial modality of caffeine and ephedrine,
the principal active ingredient in the Chinese herbal plant Ma
Huang, was once widely used as a dietary supplement to reduce
body weight. The adverse effect associated with ephedrine led to the
cessation of using it as an anti-obesity supplement51. However,
given that caffeine negatively regulates energy balance, caffeine or its
derivatives might be interesting candidate agents to combat obesity.
In the present study, we found that central or peripheral
administration of caffeine improved the glucose tolerance of DIO
mice (Figs 4f,g and 5h,i). This is in agreement with previous studies
conducted in human populations showing that consumption of
coffee reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus52,53. With regard
to the mechanisms, we show that caffeine excites Oxt neurons
(Fig. 7c–e) and stimulates the release of Oxt from PVN (Fig. 7f).
Given that Oxt treatment improved the glucose tolerance in DIO
animals27,54, it is likely that caffeine modulates glucose metabolism
via its action on Oxt neurons. It should be noted that peripherally
expressed adenosine receptors were shown to be involved in the
regulation
of
glucose
homeostasis.
For
example,
selective
antagonism of A2BR increased glucose infusion rate and uptake
into skeletal muscle as well as brown adipose tissue55. In contrast,
other studies employing whole-body knockout mice showed that
A2BR is required to maintain normal glucose level and insulin
sensitivity56,57. Clearly, adenosine receptors play a pivotal role in
animal’s glucose homeostasis, although the tissue specific functions
need to be further elucidated.
Caffeine plays a prominent role in fatty acid metabolism. It was
initially discovered that theophylline elicits the release of glycerol and
free fatty acids from adipose tissue58. Moreover, A1R is expressed in
adipose tissue and its activation inhibits lipolysis. Thus, peripherally
administered caffeine might promote lipolysis by directly inhibiting
A1R expressed in adipocytes. The role of adenosine in brown adipose
tissue lipolysis is more complexed59–61. In the present study, we
found that brain administration of caffeine reduced the TG levels in
DIO mice (Fig. 4e), and caffeine stimulates the activities of Oxt
neurons (Fig. 7c–e). Given that one study found that Oxt neurons
are part of the sympathetic nervous system outflow from brain to
white adipose tissue (ref. 62), caffeine might employ the brain-fat
axis to regulate lipid metabolism.
In summary, we found that aberrations of the adenosine-A1R
signalling pathway occur in the hypothalamus of DIO mouse.
A1R expressed in PVN Oxt neurons plays a critical role in the
regulation of energy homeostasis. Administration of caffeine by
central or peripheral route suppresses appetite, increases energy
expenditure, and reduces the body weight of DIO mice. PVN Oxt
is a critical mediator of the anti-obesity effect of caffeine. Hence,
targeting PVN A1R by caffeine or its derivatives could represent a
relevant strategy to counteract obesity and related comorbidities.
Methods
Animals. Adult male C57 BL/6 and ob/ob mice were purchased from the National
Resource Center of Model Mice (Nanjing, China), and housed under a 12-h light/
12-h dark cycle in a temperature-controlled room (22–24 �C). Oxt-Cre mice were
obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME)32. The animals had ad
libitum access to tap water and diet, except where noted. All of the experimental
procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
the Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Rodent chow (9.4% kcal from
fat) and high-fat (60% kcal from fat) diets were purchased from the HFK
Bioscience (Beijing, China) and Medicience (Yangzhou, China), respectively. For
diet-induced obesity, mice were fed the HFD for 12 weeks starting at 6 weeks of age
unless otherwise noted.
Antibodies and chemicals. The detailed information of antibody is provided in
Supplementary Table 1. Rabbit anti-A1R antibody was purchased from Alomone
labs (Jerusalem, Israel). Goat anti-A1R, anti-c-Fos, anti-CRH, anti-Neurophysin I
and anti-Neurophysin II, rabbit anti-c-Fos, anti-TRH, anti-A2AR, anti-A3R and
anti-p-Creb1 (Ser 133), and mouse anti-b-Actin and anti-HA antibodies were
obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse anti-Hu C/D
and anti-Myc antibodies were purchased from Thermo Fisher (Waltham, MA) and
Proteintech (Wuhan, China), respectively. Rabbit anti-Oxt antibody was obtained
from Immunostar (Hudson, WI). Rabbit anti-A2BR and anti-AVP antibodies were
purchased from Bioss (Woburn, MA). Alexa Fluor 488/555 goat anti-rabbit, Alexa
Fluor 488/555 goat anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 488/555 donkey anti-rabbit and Alexa
Fluor 488/555/633 donkey anti-goat secondary antibodies were also obtained from
Thermo Fisher. Adenosine was obtained from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). Caffeine,
CPA and Avertin was purchased from Amresco (Solon, OH), Tocris (Bristol, UK)
and Sigma (St Louis, MO), respectively. Oxt was purchased from Sangon Biotech
(Shanghai, China). OTR inhibitor L-368,899 was obtained from Santa Cruz.
Plasmid construction and lentivirus production. To generate a neuron-specific
lentiviral vector, we replaced the cytomegalovirus promoter in the Lentilox 3.7 vector
by the human Synapsin promoter25. This plasmid expressed EGFP in neurons and
was designated as Ctrl-Lenti. We amplified the full-length mouse A1R cDNA with
gene-specific primers (Supplementary Table 2) and ligated the fragment to Ctrl-Lenti
at the NheI site. This A1R-expressing plasmid was designated as A1R-Lenti. To
generate pcDNA3 HA-A1R, HA-tagged mouse A1R cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3
between the HindIII and EcoRI restriction sites. shA1R-Lenti plasmid was
constructed by inserting shRNA-expressing cassette (Supplementary Table 2) to
Lentilox 3.7 between the HpaI and XhoI sites63. shA1R-pSico lentiviral plasmid was
constructed by using the same expression cassette as previous described31. The
corresponding empty vectors were used as controls. Successful constructions of the
plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Lentivirus was produced in HEK293T
cells by transfecting the cells with lentiviral and packaging plasmids, and
concentrated by using ultracentrifugation14.
Surgery. Third ventricle cannulation: stereotacxic surgery was performed as previously
described14,18. Briefly, mouse was anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital
(75mgkg� 1) or Avertin (300mgkg� 1) and placed on an ultra-precise stereotaxic
instrument (David Kopf, Tujunga, CA). Then a 28 G guide cannula was implanted
targeting the ventral third ventricle (coordinates: A/P -2.0mm posterior to bregma, D/V
� 5.0mm). For double cannula directed to PVN, the coordinates were A/P � 0.85mm
posterior to bregma, D/V � 4.2mm. Mice were allowed to recover for 2 weeks and
successful implantation was shown by Angiotensin II evoked water-drinking behaviour.
For lentivirus injection, mice were anaesthetized and placed on the stereotaxic
instrument. With the help of a guide cannula, the viral solution was injected bilaterally
to PVN, ARC or DMH at the coordinates � 0.85, � 1.80 or � 1.90mm posterior to,
0.2, 0.2 or 0.3mm lateral to, and � 4.8, � 5.8 or � 5.0mm below bregma.
I.C.V. administration of reagents. Caffeine: HFD-fed mice were cannulated and
allowed to recover from surgeries, and then caffeine was administered at the dose of
10mg per mouse immediately before the light was turned off. Food intake and body
weight were measured on a daily basis (Supplementary Fig. 9k). The mean daily
consumption of food was presented. To initially characterize the dose-response
effect, we administered 1, 5, 10 or 15 mg of caffeine to mouse brains and measured
the consumed foods in 24h.

 Adenosine and CPA: chow-fed mice were cannulated, allowed to recover and
then injected the indicated doses of adenosine, CPA (50 ng per mouse) or control
immediately before the dark cycle. Four and 24 h food intakes were measured.
Caffeine or Oxt administered to A1R-Lenti or Ctrl-Lenti virus-injected mice:
virus-injected and 3rd ventricle-cannulated mice were given caffeine (10 mg per
mouse) or Oxt (1 mg per mouse)27, and aCSF as control. Twenty-four hours food
intake and body weight change were measured.
OTR antagonist, AVP or TRH antibody and caffeine administered to DIO mice:
Third ventricle-cannulated DIO mice were i.c.v. administered OTR antagonist
L-368,899 (2 mg per mouse), AVP antibody (0.5 mg per mouse), TRH antibody
(0.5 mg per mouse)64 or aCSF/non-immune IgG as control. An hour later and
immediately before the light was turned off, caffeine (10 mg per mouse) or aCSF
was injected. Twenty-four hours food intake and body weight change were
measured and presented.
Intra-PVN injection of caffeine. DIO mice were implanted double cannula
directed to both sides of PVN. After the mice were recovered form surgeries,
caffeine was administered at the doses up to 1 mg per mouse immediately before the
dark cycle. Twenty-four hours food intake and body weight change were measured.
Oral gavage of caffeine. Caffeine (60 mg kg� 1) and saline were delivered to the
DIO mice by using a gavage needle immediately before the dark cycle. Daily food
intake and body weight were measured (Supplementary Fig. 10e). The mean daily
food intake was presented. To characterize the dose-response effect, we administered
caffeine at the indicated doses, and measured the consumed HFD in 24h.
Indirect calorimetry and locomotor activity. O2 consumption, CO2 production
and energy expenditure were measured by using the OxyletPro indirect calorimetry
system (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain). We defined the value immediately before the
delivery of caffeine or control as basal value. The parameters were normalized by
lean body mass (lbm), which was measured by using a Minispec LF50 body
composition analyzer (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany). For wheel-running loco-
motor activity, mice were housed in cages with steel wheels (diameter¼ 11.5 cm),
and were accustomed to the cages and running wheels for 3 days. Reagents were
administered at 11:00 AM and the revolution number was recorded by a digital
counter connected to a magnet sensor.
Glucose tolerance test and plasma TG analysis. Glucose tolerance test (GTT)
was performed as previously described14. Briefly, mice were fasted overnight and
intraperitoneally administered glucose (2 g kg � 1). Blood glucose levels were
measured by using a glucometer at the indicated time points (Omron, Beijing,
China). Plasma TG analysis: fasting plasma TG was determined with reagent from
Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, China) according to the
manufacture’s instruction.
Thermography. Infrared images were taken from lentivirus-injected mice, or 4 h post
i.c.v. administration of aCSF or caffeine at 22 �C with an infrared camera (Flir, Boston,
MA). Data were analysed with Tool þ software (Flir, Boston, MA). Mean of the
highest 10% values in the interscapular area was presented as previously described65.
Behavioural analyses. Open field test: mice were administered aCSF or caffeine
(10 mg per mouse) 2 h before the test. The animals were then placed in an
opaque, square open field (40 cm L � 40 cm W � 40 cm H). Mice were allowed to
freely explore in the field for 5 min and monitored with the ImageOF software
(https://cbsn.neuroinf.jp/modules/xoonips/detail.php?id=ImageOF). The open field
was divided into a peripheral region and a 13.3 cm � 13.3 cm central region. Time
spent in the central versus peripheral region of the field during the 5 min period
was presented.
Elevated plus maze test: the plus maze had two walled arms (the closed arms,
35 cm L � 6 cm W � 22 cm H) and two open arms (35 cm L � 6 cm W). The maze
was elevated 74 cm from the floor. Mice were placed on the center section and
allowed to explore the maze freely and monitored with ImageEP software66. Time
spent in the open versus closed arms during the 5 min period was presented.
Light/dark box text: the apparatus was comprised of a dual compartment box
(20 cm L � 20 cm W � 40 cm H) with free access between them. The dark box was
made of black Plexiglass and the light one was exposed to room light. The
exploratory activity was monitored for 5 min by using the ImageLD software67.
Time spent in the light versus dark box was presented.
Sleep/wakefulness test: caffeine (10 mg per mouse) or aCSF was i.c.v. administered
immediately before the dark cycle. Mice were monitored in home cage with a camera
during the first 4 h of light cycle. Sleep durations were calculated when animals were
immobilized for 40s or longer by manually inspecting the videos68.
Time spent in food intake or non-food intake-related locomotor activity.
Caffeine (10 mg per mouse) or aCSF was i.c.v. injected immediately before the dark
phase. Mice were monitored in home cage with an infrared camera (Flir, Boston,
MA) during the first 4 h of the dark cycle. Time spent in food intake or other
locomotor activities were calculated by manually inspect the videos.
Histology. Mice were administered control or caffeine (i.c.v., 10 mg per mouse; oral
gavage, 60 mg kg � 1). Two hours later, mice were anaesthetized by sodium
pentobarbital and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde via transcardial perfusion.
Brain tissues were cryoprotected by 20% and 30% sucrose solutions, and sectioned
on a cryostat. Tissue sections were blocked with 5% serum/0.3% Triton X-100/PBS,
incubated with primary antibodies at 4 �C overnight, and fluorophore-labelled
secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. For double immunostaining of
TRH or CRH and A1R, mice were i.c.v. administered colchicine (40 mg per mouse)
2 days before the perfusion. Immunofluorescence staining of cell: HEK293T cells
were plated on cover glasses and transfected with pcDNA3 HA-A1R or control
plasmid. Two days later, cells were washed with 1 � PBS and fixed with 4% PFA.
Immunostaining of A1R and HA antibodies were then performed. Image sets
encompassing only c-Fos and DAPI were collected with a conventional AE31
fluorescent microscope (Motic, Xiamen, China). Other fluorescent images were
acquired with a FluoView FV1200 confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
All of the images were processed with ImageJ software. The number of c-Fos þ,
A1R þ, NP-Oxt þ and double positive cells were manually counted in one side of
the nucleus of one representative brain section per mouse.
Haematoxylin and eosin staining: epididymal white adipose tissue tissues were
removed and fixed in Bouin’s solution, and embedded in paraffin. Tissues were
sectioned and stained with haematoxylin and eosin solutions sequentially. Images
were collected on the AE31 microscope. We measured the size of adipocyte by
using the ImageJ.
Analysis of adenosine level. Twenty-two weeks HFD or chow-fed, ob/ob and
wild-type C57 BL/6 mice were implanted cannulas (0.48mm OD� 0.34 mm ID)
directed to the third ventricle, and allowed to recover from surgeries. Freely released
fluid was then collected as CSF. Plasma and Hypothalamic tissues were collected
from 24 weeks HFD-fed mice and matched controls. Hypothalamic tissues were
lysed with tissue lysis buffer. Protein concentrations were then determined. Plasma,
CSF and hypothalamic tissue samples were measured by using an adenosine assay kit
obtained from Biovision (Milpitas, CA). Hypothalamic adenosine content was
normalized against the amount of protein.
qRT-PCR. Tissue RNA was extracted by using the TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher,
Waltham, MA). cDNA was generated with MMLV reverse transcriptase (Promega,
Madison, WI). After the combination of cDNA, gene-specific primers
(Supplementary Table 2) and PCR master mix (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA), the
assay was performed on an ABI 7900HT real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher,
Waltham, MA). We used the 2 � DCt method to analyse the relative expression level
of genes, where DCt is the difference between the Ct value of a given gene and that
of Gapdh control.
Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation. Western blot: proteins were
extracted from hypothalamic tissues, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to
PVDF membranes. The membranes were then blocked by 5% non-fat milk and
incubated with rabbit anti-A1R (1:1,000), anti-A2AR (1:1,000), anti-A2BR (1:1,000)
or anti-A3R (1:500) antibody, or mouse anti-b-Actin antibody (1:2,000). After
incubation with horseradish peroxidase labelled secondary antibody (1:4,000), the
membranes were exposed to the Supersignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity
Substrate (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). Chemiluminescence was recorded with
the GeneGnome system (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). Co-immunoprecipitation:
HEK293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3 HA-A1R and Myc-OTR
(Origene, Rockville, MD) expressing plasmids. Cell lysates were incubated with
2 mg of non-immune IgG, anti-HA or anti-Myc antibody. Immunoprecipitates were
prepared by incubation with protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Technology, Santa
Cruz, CA), and subjected to western blot with either anti-Myc or anti-HA
antibody. Uncropped blot images with molecular weight reference are shown in
Supplementary Fig. 16 through 18.
Single-cell RT-PCR. For single-cell RT-PCR, mice were fed the chow or high-fat
diet for 24 weeks. The animals were euthanized with sodium pentobarbital
overdose and brains were removed and sectioned to slices at 300 mm thickness. The
brain slices encompassing PVN were then treated with papain (Worthington
Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ) and cells in the PVN region were harvested by using a
capillary pipette filled with 1 � buffer for reverse transcription. The cells were then
expelled to a 0.2 ml tube containing dNTPs, Oligo(dT)15 primer and MMLV
reverse transcriptase. The mixtures were incubated at 42 �C to generate cDNA. We
performed a two-stage RT-PCR to detect A1R, Oxt, AVP and TRH. In each stage
there were 35 cycles for amplification. The internal control Gapdh was amplified in
one stage. PCR products were visualized with ethidium bromide on a 2% agarose
gel. Uncropped gel images with molecular weight reference are presented in
Supplementary Fig. 19. All primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 2.
Oxytocin release assay. Caffeine: to determine the effect of caffeine on Oxt
release, PVN slices from HFD-fed mice were dissected and balanced in Locke
solution supplied with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37 �C. The solution was changed
every 5 min for 10 times and the 10th sample was collected to measure the basal

 release rate. The tissues were then incubated in the same solution containing
caffeine (2 mmol l � 1)69 for 5 min and this solution was measured to determine
caffeine-evoked Oxt release.
Effect of overexpression of A1R in PVN on Oxt release: the detailed procedure
has been described previously18. Briefly, A1R-Lenti or Ctrl-Lenti virus was injected
into the PVN of chow-fed mice. The PVN slices were then dissected and incubated
in the Locke solution for 10 times. The tissues were incubated in High K þ Locke
solution containing 70 mmol l � 1 KCl for 5 min and this solution was measured to
determine KCl stimulated Oxt release. An EIA kit (Enzo, Farmingdale, NY) was
used to determine the Oxt concentration in the solution.
Statistical analysis. Data are expressed as mean±s.e.m. The two-tailed Student’s
t-test was used to compare two groups. One-way analysis of variance followed by
the Bonferroni’s or Newman–Keuls post hoc test was used for comparisons of more
than 2 groups. Two-way analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni’s post hoc
test was used for multiple comparisons. Linear regression was employed to analyse
the relationship between adenosine levels and body weights. Pearson’s correlation
coefficient and the best-fit line were calculated. Po0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Data availability. All data generated or analysed during this study are included in
this published article (and its Supplementary Information file), or available from
