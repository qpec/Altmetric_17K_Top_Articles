Allergy immunotherapy (AIT) is a treatment option for respiratory allergy that is complementary to
pharmacotherapy, with a distinct mechanism of action. Alternative methods to subcutaneous adminis-
tration of AIT that enable patients to safely self-administer AIT is considered an unmet clinical need.
The sublingual immunotherapy tablet (SLIT-tablet) is an orally disintegrating pharmaceutical formu-
lation (oral lyophilisate) containing standardized allergens. SLIT-tablets have been developed for sub-
lingual immunotherapy (SLIT) of cedar-pollen, grass-pollen, ragweed-pollen, tree-pollen, and house dust
mite allergies. It is a once-daily tablet treatment to be self-administered after the first dose has been
provided under the supervision of a physician with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of allergic
diseases. Once the first dose is adequately tolerated, subsequent doses may be self-administered.
SLIT-tablets have proven efficacy for allergic rhinitis (AR) with and without conjunctivitis (C) and
allergic asthma (AA) in adults, children, and poly-sensitized allergic patients. Meta-analyses indicate that
SLIT-tablets have superior or similar efficacy compared with anti-allergic pharmacotherapies for seasonal
AR and superior efficacy for perennial AR. SLIT-tablets have also demonstrated clinically relevant
improvements of asthma, with significant reductions in the following: daily inhaled corticosteroid use,
risk of asthma exacerbations, and asthma symptoms. SLIT-tablets are generally well tolerated, with a low
risk of systemic allergic reactions. The most common treatment-related adverse events are mild-
moderate oral reactions. Current evidence supports SLIT-tablets to be considered as an alternative or
add-on treatment to pharmacotherapy for AR/C and asthma. Future SLIT developments may include early
intervention to prevent the development or progression of allergic disease in children.

Introduction
Allergy immunotherapy (AIT) is a treatment option for respira-
tory allergy that is complementary to pharmacotherapy, with a
distinct mechanism of action on the immune system. AIT is per-
formed by repeated sublingual or subcutaneous doses of allergens
to an allergic person in order to gradually induce immunological
tolerance towards the allergens. AIT modulates the basic immu-
nologic mechanism of the allergic disease and is the only known
treatment option with the potential to provide long-term, post-
treatment benefits and alter the natural course of allergic disease.1
Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT)-tablets are an alternative to
subcutaneous immunotherapy that provide the benefits of AIT
without the cost and inconvenience of frequent office visits or the
discomfort of injections. The original idea supporting sublingual
administration was to achieve a prompt systemic absorption of the
allergen through the sublingual mucosa. However, biodistribution
studies with radio-labeled allergens in humans have shown that
the systemic absorption of the allergen through the oral mucosa
was absent or negligible. Therefore, the clinical effect should be
ascribed to the local interaction of the allergen with the mucosal
immune system.2,3 Although not fully understood, a possible
mechanism of sublingual immunotherapy is that the oromucosal
contact with allergen results in tolerance development through the
interaction of dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, and T-cells within
the mucosa or in the regional lymph nodes4
Sublingual immunotherapy tablet (SLIT-tablet) is an orally
disintegrating pharmaceutical formulation (oral lyophilisate) con-
taining standardized allergen extracts that been developed as
sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for allergic rhinitis with and
without conjunctivitis (AR/C) and allergic asthma (AA). SLIT-tablets
have been developed for treatment of AR/C for cedar-pollen, grass-

Professional

AR/C
guidelines
recommend
AIT
for
patients with seasonal or perennial AR/C and the recent 2017 GINA
asthma guideline update recommends SLIT-tablet for patients for
whom there is a clear relationship between asthma symptoms
and exposure to HDM.5,6 Despite these recommendations, AIT is
underutilized, with only about 20% of patients with AR/C and even
less patients with asthma, having ever received AIT.7,8 The purpose
of this review is to describe the current development and evidence
of SLIT-tablets as an add-on or alternative treatment option to
pharmacotherapy for AR/C and allergic asthma.
Treatment options for allergic asthma and
rhinoconjunctivitis (AR/C)
Currently, the treatments for allergic diseases are based on
allergen avoidance, allergy pharmacotherapy, and AIT.
The purpose of allergen avoidance is to decrease exposure to
allergens. For patients allergic to widespread inhalant allergens
such as grass and tree pollen, allergen avoidance which creates a
low-exposure allergen environment (such as, the patient's home) is
not a practical treatment option. For perennial allergens, such as
house dust mite, this implies extensive sanitation and environ-
mental control measures, e.g., mattress/pillow covers, frequent
washing of bed clothing, focus on ventilation and decreasing hu-
midity, increased frequency of vacuuming. Even if allergen levels
are reduced in the home, other locations such as schools and day
cares, are important sources for continuing exposure. Evidence
suggests that mite allergen avoidance is not sufficient to relieve
patients' symptoms; therefore, international treatment guidelines
question whether the effect justifies the cost and effort.5,9
Pharmacotherapy for respiratory allergy most commonly in-
cludes antihistamines (oral or topical), local corticosteroids (nasal
and/or inhaled), leukotriene antagonists, and inhaled b2-agonists,
depending on the clinical manifestation and severity. Despite
availability of these medications, rhinitis patients note that they are
dissatisfied with treatments due to incomplete relief, slow onset
of action, relief that lasts for <24 h, and decreased effects with
continued use.10 In addition, asthma exacerbations remain a signif-
icant problem in many patients despite conventional treatment
(e.g., inhaled corticosteroids [ICS] or ICS/long-acting beta agonists
(LABA) combination). Newer biologic therapies, such as anti-IgE,
have demonstrated efficacy with respect to reduction in asthma
exacerbations, but are generally reserved for the most severe
patients, and are associated with significant costs. Common to all
approved forms of allergy pharmacotherapy treatments is that they
do not provide long-term, post-treatment benefits or alter the nat-
ural course of the allergic disease.
AIT is another treatment option for respiratory allergies and is
delivered either subcutaneously (SCIT) or sublingually (SLIT). SCIT
is generally administered weekly or biweekly under medical
supervision in a physician's office, whereas SLIT is generally
administered daily at home via drop or tablet formulations. In some
parts of the world, SLIT drops are an off-label use of extracts
intended for SCIT.6,11 Such off-label use is concerning, as there is
little evidence to support the efficacy of such practice, the allergen
extracts are not adequately standardized, and a safe and effective
dose has not been established through rigorous clinical trials.
Additionally, when utilizing SLIT drops, multiple allergens may be
mixed together which augments the dosing variability of this
treatment. In contrast, SLIT-tablets are well-characterized, stan-
dardized oral formulations that have been evaluated in large clin-
ical trials and have been recently approved by regulatory agencies
in the marketed countries. Furthermore, the Timothy SLIT-tablet
has been shown to provide preventive and long-term benefits,
including sustained improvement and persistent efficacy beyond
the treatment period both in adults and children.12,13
Key development goals of sublingual immunotherapy tablets
for AR/C and asthma
The three key development goals for SLIT-tablets include: (1)
Prevention of allergic symptoms: Efficacy in the first pollen season
after start of specific immunotherapy and some months of treat-
ment; (2) Sustained clinical effect: Maintenance of significant and
clinically relevant efficacy during 2e3 treatment years of continuing
daily treatment; and (3) Disease-modifying effect: Sustained sig-
nificant and clinically relevant efficacy in post-treatment years.14e16
Table 1 provides an overview of the different SLIT-tablets and their
current development status in adults and children.
Many pivotal clinical trials conducted in countries worldwide
have demonstrated efficacy of SLIT-tablets for AR/C, for asthma and
for the prevention of disease progression.17e36 Two SLIT-tablets are
currently approved in Australia, Europe, the United States, and
Canada for grass AR/C. These tablets are the timothy grass SLIT-tablet
(GRASTEK®/GRAZAX®, ALK, Hørsholm, Denmark) for patients aged
5 þ years, and the 5-grass (sweet vernal, orchard, perennial rye,
timothy, and Kentucky blue grass) SLIT-tablet (ORALAIR®, Staller-
genes, Antony, France/Greer Laboratories, Lenoir, NC, USA) for
patients aged 10 þ years in the US and 5 years and older in other
countries.37,38 One SLIT-tablet is approved in the United States,39
Canada and Europe for ragweed AR/C (RAGWITEK®, RAGWIZAX®,
ALK, Hørsholm) for patients aged 18 þ years. Two SLIT-tablets for
HDM (ODACTRA®/ACARIZAX®/MITICURE®, USA/ALK/Torii Pharma-
ceutical,
Tokyo,
Japan
and
ACTAIR®
(Stallergenes/Greer)
are
approved in Europe (not ACTAIR®), Australia, and Japan for treat-
ment of AR, and also for allergic asthma (ACARIZAX® only) in Europe
and
Australia.
The
HDM
(ODACTRA®/ACARIZAX®/MITICURE®)
SLIT-tablet is approved for patients 18 þ years in North America,40
12 þ years in Europe and Australia, and recently for 5 þ years in
Japan. Two tablets (Torii Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan and Staller-
genes/Greer) are approved for Cedar pollen AR in Japan. A tree tablet
(ALK-Abello)
containing

extract
is
in
Phase
III
development.
The key learnings from multiple SLIT-tablet trials are that the
magnitude of efficacy is dose-dependent. Dose dependent efficacy
may be most notable in an EEC design (chamber trial), where the
variability of allergen exposure, which is inherent in any in-field
trial, is removed. The onset of effect on allergic symptoms occurs
approximately 4e8 weeks (earliest assessment in EEC) after treat-
ment initiation.41,42 Onset of effect occurs slightly later in field
trials (12e16 weeks) with a treatment effect that was maintained
throughout the year/season with continued treatment.36 The overall
treatment effect is consistent regardless of age group, gender, race,
asthma status, or allergen sensitization profile (monosensitized/
polysensitized).43 Fig. 1.44
Other key findings from numerous SLIT-tablet trials are that the
magnitude of the observed treatment effects range from approxi-
mately 16%e40% in relative reduction in symptom and medication
scores. The variation is related to allergen exposure during the
season and year of the trial.45 When allergen exposure during the
trial year is high the greatest treatment effects are observed. In
lower pollen exposure years, the treatment effect is less pro-
nounced. The treatment effect appears to be similar in patients

 with milder and moderate/severe AR/C.34,36 However, the treat-
ment effect may be more easily detected in moderate/severe
patients as the symptoms scores will be higher and subjects can
better discern an improvement. .
A particular focus has been to develop an effective and safe HDM
SLIT-tablet. Although, HDM allergen (D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus
allergens) products for subcutaneous use are commercially avail-
able in many parts of the world, only a small number of clinical
trials have been conducted to demonstrate their efficacy. In an
evidenced-based analysis of HDM trials conducted with commer-
cially available SCIT extracts (maintenance dose ranged from 7 to
70 mcg of Der p1 or Der f1), only 3 out of 7 studies reported a
significant effect on AR/C symptoms and 9 out of 19 studies re-
ported a significant effect on asthma symptoms. The lack of efficacy
in many of these trials may have been due to inadequate or non-
standardized HDM extract formulations, inadequate numbers of
subjects, use of sub-therapeutic doses, or ill-defined efficacy end-
points and inclusion/exclusion criteria.46 The premise for designing
and conducting more rigorous clinical HDM AIT trials was the need
for consistency among the extracts, which had been previously
largely missing from available AIT products. It prompted the opti-
mization of the development of the SLIT HDM-tablet extract
formulation to ensure a consistent and well characterized process.
SQ HDM SLIT-tablets (ODACTRA®/ACARIZAX®/MITICURE®, ALK,
Hørsholm, Denmark) contain extracts that are produced by a
controlled process which allows for the use of body and fecal
fractions of D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus to achieve a 1:1:1:1 ratio
between Der f 1/2 and Der p 1/2 allergens. In addition to an equal
and controlled ratio of the four major allergens, the use of body and
fecal particles ensures that the content of each tablet has the
broadest possible range of HDM allergens to which patient are
most frequently sensitized across geographic regions.47 The new
approach to HDM tablet formulation optimization was proven
successful in a controlled dust mite exposure setting (environ-
mental exposure chamber) that demonstrated a 49% improvement
in rhinitis symptoms with an onset of effect after only 8 weeks of
treatment.41 The key findings from that study are that optimal
extract formulation is important and that AIT is dose and time-
dependent. Few studies have documented adequate therapeutic
SCIT doses, mostly due to lack of extract standardization and
characterization. Furthermore, onset of action studies have not
been conducted. Thus, most SCIT therapy dosing is variable and
based on individual and empirical knowledge rather than being
evidence based.
Immunotherapy acts on the immune system and allergens are
not metabolized or excreted. Thus, sublingual or subcutaneous
routes of administration are not expected to result in differences in
efficacy as long as adequate therapeutic dosing has been estab-
lished for each treatment modality. However, the comparative
efficacy of SLIT vs SCIT is inconclusive. There are no head-to-head
trials of SLIT tablets and SCIT products. A robust head-to-head
trial of SLIT versus SCIT would require a double-dummy design in
order to maintain blinding between treatment groups due to the
use of patient-reported outcomes. This study would require thou-
sands of patients per arm to be appropriately powered due to a
higher dropout rate in double-dummy trials and due to the onerous
administration of both injections and tablets. As a result of these
reasons, the relative efficacy of SLIT versus SCIT is most appropri-
ately assessed using meta-analyses and indirect comparisons. Ef-
ficacy of SLIT vs SCIT has been indirectly compared in several meta-
analyses of double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. The most recent
meta-analysis, which includes the recent large grass SLIT-tablet
trials, was published in 2015 and focused on commercially avail-
able SCIT, SLIT-tablets, and SLIT-drops for grass AR/C48 Improve-
ments in AR symptoms vs placebo based on standardized mean
difference (SMD) were grass SLIT-tablet equal to SCIT and larger
thanSLIT-drops, with no significant differences between treat-
ments. There are no current systematic reviews or meta-analyses
including the new large HDM trials. Durham et al. reviewed the
available PAR (predominantly HDM) SLIT and SCIT trials published
up to 2015. In a comparison of Cochrane meta-analyses for SLIT and
SCIT versus placebo for perennial allergens (predominantly HDM),
the mean effect size for improvement in symptom scores for SCIT
and SLIT compared to placebo were similar (�0.93 [95% CI �1.69
to �0.17] versus �0.86 [�1.48 to �0.23]), while the mean effect size
for improvement in medication scores was numerically greater
with SLIT compared to SCIT (�0.43 [95% CI �0.89 to 0.02] versus
0.05 [95% CI �0.23 to 0.32]).49 However, these analyses were based
on between 4 and 10 studies that had considerable heterogeneity,
with I2 statistic values ranging from 26% to 92%, highlighting the
limitations of performing meta-analyses across allergic rhinitis
trials. Data from the Cochrane meta-analyses suggest that both SCIT
and SLIT are effective for perennial allergic rhinitis, with no sta-
tistically significant differences in symptom and mediation scores.
The need for alternatives to pharmacotherapy for AR is under-
scored by results of a survey of healthcare practitioners, in which
the primary reason for prescribing AIT was identified as “other
therapies don't work”.50 However, there is no direct comparison of
the efficacy of pharmacotherapy vs SLIT for AR as no head-to-head
trials have been conducted. Indirect comparisons between phar-
macotherapies and SLIT are hindered by substantial differences in
trial designs.51 However, an observed treatment effect size of
approximately 20% or more with SLIT is fairly impressive, consid-
ering meta-analyses of pharmacotherapy trials have reported an
estimated treatment effect vs placebo of 5% for leukotriene antag-
onists, 7%e9% for antihistamines, and 17%e26% for intranasal cor-
ticosteroids (INCS).52e55 Although heterogeneity in trial designs
exists, attempts have been made to indirectly compare the effect of

 effect size vs placebo for seasonal AR was 22.2% with an INCS, 17.1%
with a ragweed SLIT-tablet, 16.3% with a timothy grass SLIT-tablet,
8.5% with an oral antihistamine, and 5.4% with a leukotriene
receptor antagonist (Table 2). For perennial AR, the effect size vs
placebo was 16.1% with a HDM SLIT-tablet, 11.2% with an INCS, 4.8%
with an oral antihistamine, and 3.7% with a leukotriene receptor
antagonist (Table 2). These data indicate that SLIT-tablets are
comparable to INCS and more effective than antihistamines
and leukotriene receptor antagonists in reducing seasonal AR
symptoms. SLIT-tablets also appear to be more effective than
pharmacotherapies for perennial AR.
No head-to-head trials have been performed to evaluate the
efficacy of pharmacotherapy vs SLIT-tablets for treatment of
asthma. Several clinically-relevant benefits for asthma have been
demonstrated with HDM SLIT-tablets. In a trial of subjects with
mild-to-moderate asthma controlled by ICS, 1 year of treatment
with HDM SLIT-tablet resulted in an 81 mcg/day greater ICS
reduction compared with placebo28 ICS use was reduced even more
in the subgroup of patients with partially controlled asthma, with a
327 mcg/day greater ICS reduction compared with placebo.65 A trial
of up to 18 months of HDM SLIT-tablet treatment in asthma sub-
jects inadequately controlled by ICS demonstrated a 34% relative
reduction in the risk of moderate or severe asthma exacerbation vs
placebo (hazard ratio ¼ 0.66 [95% CI, 0.47e0.93]; P ¼ 0.02)31
Furthermore, in a trial of HDM SLIT-tablet in subjects with AR
with or without asthma, up to 1 year of treatment improved asthma
symptom scores by 19% vs placebo in the overall trial population,
and by 25% in the subjects with a history of asthma.34 Thus, there is
compelling evidence that HDM SLIT-tablet decrease ICS use, asthma
exacerbations, and improve asthma symptoms.
Three long-term trials with SLIT-tablets have been conducted to
evaluate the disease-modifying effects of AIT. The first study, a 5-
year study in adults with daily timothy grass SLIT-tablet demon-
strated a significant beneficial effect on AR/C symptom scores up to
2 years after ending a 3-year treatment period.12 This study led to
an indication of timothy grass SLIT-tablet as a disease-modifying
treatment in Europe and led to recognition by the FDA as having
a sustained effect. The second study, a 5-year study with a 5-grass
SLIT-tablet administered pre-and co-seasonally demonstrated a
significant combined symptom/medication score compared with
placebo up to 2 years after a 3-year treatment period.66 The third
long-term SLIT-tablet trial (GAP) was a 1:1, randomized, parallel-
group,
double-blind,
placebo-controlled
trial,
including
812
children (5e12 years at study entry) with a clinically relevant
history of grass pollen allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (AR/C) and no
medical history of asthma. The primary objective was to investigate
whether 3 consecutive years of daily treatment with timothy grass
SLIT-tablet (GRAZAX (2800 BAU/75,000 SQ-T) compared with
placebo reduces the risk of developing asthma based on the time to
onset of asthma. Asthma was defined by a composite endpoint of
asthma symptoms, medication use, and reversible impairment of
lung function (forced expiratory volume after 1 min [FEV1] � 12%
after beta-2-agonist administration).13 Subjects were followed in a
blinded fashion for an additional 2 years after cessation of treat-
ment. The trial did not meet the primary endpoint and a notable
number of subjects did not reveal lung function reversibility
despite reporting asthma symptoms and medication use. Although
the trial did not show a significant effect in terms of time to first
diagnosis of asthma, defined by the composite endpoint of symp-
toms, asthma medication use, and reversible lung function, the trial
demonstrated that timothy grass SLIT treatment significantly
reduced the proportion of children reporting asthma symptoms
and/or asthma medication use. This effect was observed after two
years of treatment and was sustained for the rest of the study
including two years (Year 4 and Year 5) without daily treatment.
The odds ratio (OR) for experiencing asthma symptoms or using
asthma medication in the GRAZAX group versus placebo was in
favor of GRAZAX each year, with statistical significance (p-value
<0.05) from Year 2 and onwards; the corresponding relative
risk reductions ranged from 36.2% to 50.7% (odds ratio ¼ 0.66,
P < 0.036). Also, grass allergic rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms were
22%e30% reduced (P < 0.005 for all 5 years). At the end of the trial,
the use of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis pharmacotherapy was
significantly less (27% relative difference to placebo, P < 0.001).
These data provide further support to the concept that a lung
function criterion may not be adequately sensitive (although specific)
for the purpose of diagnosing asthma in children. Conversely, asthma
as determined by symptoms and/or medication use, but not lung
function, may be appropriately sensitive and specific for the purpose
of early intervention trials. In summary, the GAP trial is important
because it replicates adult data and show a disease-modifying effect
of sublingual allergy immunotherapy with a notable prevention
effect in AR/C children whom are at risk of further progression to
asthma. In addition, the design based on 3 years of daily treatment
followed by 2 years without treatment therefore seems adequate to
delineate asthma prevention in a younger age group.

 Safety of AIT
The majority of adverse events with SCIT are injection site
reactions, and the majority of adverse events with SLIT are local oral
reactions (e.g., oral pruritus, throat irritation). In general, SLIT-
tablets offer a favorable safety profile suitable for home treatment
and requires no up-titration. Both therapies carry the risk of
systemic allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. Cases of anaphylaxis
are estimated to be 1 per 33,300 injections of SCIT, and 1 per 100
million administrations of SLIT.51 SCIT has been associated with
fatal and near-fatal systemic allergic reactions,55,56 whereas no fatal
reactions have been reported with SLIT.57
The four most common side effects for SLIT-tablets are mild to
moderate oral site reactions (ie, oral pruritus, throat irritation, ear
pruritus, mucosa swelling67; Table 3a, b). The oral site reactions
generally have an onset with the first dose of the SLIT-tablet and recur
for less than 14 days.58 The duration of the reactions is approximately
30e60 min. Oral site reactions typically do not require any treatment
and are more of a tolerability issue than a serious safety concern.
Systemic allergic reactions are possible with SLIT-tablets. To
date, none of the reported systemic allergic reactions from the
clinical development programs associated with SLIT-tablets have
been life-threatening or reported as serious. Across the clinical
development program of the ALK timothy grass, ragweed, and HDM
SLIT-tablets, representing 8152 treated patients, there have been
11 (0.1%) reported systemic allergic reactions. Epinephrine was
administered for SLIT-tablet-related events at a rate of 1.80
administrations per 100,000 SLIT-tablets.59 It is generally recom-
mended that SLIT-tablets should not be prescribed to patients with
a history of severe, uncontrolled asthma, severe systemic allergic
reaction or prior severe local reaction to SLIT.
Therefore, with regards to safety, the assumption of therapeutic
equivalence of SCIT and SLIT, the analysis favors SLIT leaving the
patient in clinical equipoise. Thus, it appears at this point, the
decision to administer either SCIT or SLIT should be determined on
the grounds of availability of standardized extracts, safety consid-
erations, patient preference, convenience, cost, and readiness of
clinic resources. Regardless, the availability of SLIT as an alternative
treatment option for AIT should result in more patients choosing
and completing AIT.
When to prescribe SLIT-tablets
HDM SLIT-tablets can initiated at any time of the year. For pollen
SLIT-tablets, it is recommended to initiate treatment 2e4 months
before the start of the respective pollen season. Thus, patients need
to be evaluated for potential SLIT-tablet treatment months before
regional pollen, which may be challenging as patients often do not
seek treatment until symptoms appear. Some physicians may be
reluctant to start AIT during the pollen season due to concerns
about an increased risk of severe or serious systemic allergic
reactions. However, a recent systematic review has demonstrated
that there does not appear to be an increase in systemic allergic
reactions or significant local reactions when AIT is initiated during
the pollen season.68 If SLIT-tablets are initiated during pollen
season, patients should be advised that improvement in symptoms
and medication use may not be readily apparent during the
initiating season.
Given the risk of severe or serious local or systemic allergic
reactions, the first dose of SLIT-tablet should be administered under
the supervision of a physician experienced in the diagnosis and
treatment of allergic diseases, followed by at least a 30 min
observation period. Patients should be educated on how to recog-
nize the symptoms of a systemic allergic reaction and should
be told to seek immediate medical care if they experience a severe
allergic reaction. The current immunotherapy guidelines recom-
mend continued treatment for at least 3 years for all allergen
immunotherapy before discontinuing treatment to allow for the
development of the disease-modifying effect.
Whom to prescribe SLIT-tablets
Although traditionally AIT was reserved for patients with severe
allergies, according to guidelines, AIT should be considered for
patients who have positive allergenspecific IgE against clinically
relevant allergens and who have corresponding allergic rhino-
conjunctivitis symptoms. In some countries, AIT is reserved for
patients who are symptomatic despite pharmacotherapy. In the US,
there are no such restrictions. Patients who have troublesome side
effects with pharmacotherapy and patients who need to improve
health-related quality of life (ie, sleep quality, work/school pro-
ductivity) are groups for whom SLIT-tablets should be considered
as useful treatment options. Also, SLIT-tablets may be particularly
beneficial for children who fear injections and needles. SLIT-tablets
provide the benefits of AIT without the inconvenience of time-
consuming frequent office visits for children and caregivers and
without the need of injections, which may deter children and their
caregivers from traditional SCIT. Not only are SLIT-tablets effective
in allergic children, but the ability of AIT to potentially reduce
the risk of developing asthma symptoms and need for asthma

 medication, as recently shown with the Timothy grass tablet, is
appealing.
As with any long-term treatment, adherence and persistence is
key to AIT efficacy. The ability of a patient to be compliant to daily
SLIT-tablet treatment should be determined before prescribing.
Furthermore, the presence and severity of asthma needs to be
evaluated before prescribing SLIT-tablets. If asthma is present, it
should be stable and well-controlled. The safety of SLIT-tablets has
not been evaluated in patients with severe, unstable, uncontrolled
asthma, and the presence of such a condition is a contraindication.
Reasons for patients choosing not to opt for AIT is reluctance to
initiate therapy because of the need for long-term commitment,
regular office visits, or symptom burden is considered acceptable
by the patient and does not justify the cost and inconvenience of 3
years of treatment. In fact, only a minority (2e9%) of US AR patients
initiate SCIT and studies indicate a preponderance of patients
who initiate treatment discontinue therapy prematurely (~53%
completed less than 1 year of treatment and 84% completed less
than 3 years of treatment).60 However, multiple studies have
shown that over the course of several years, AIT is more cost-
effective than pharmacotherapy (reviewed in Hankin and Cox,
201461). The cost-savings with AIT appear to be due to decreased AR
pharmacotherapy use, decreased asthma medication use, and
decreased asthma-related healthcare. A potential disadvantage is
the relatively slow onset of action (4e8 weeks) and the potential
nuisance of oral reactions at tablet intake during the first weeks of
treatment. Although, side effects are mild to moderate in intensity,
approximately 5% of subjects will discontinue due to local adverse
events.44 In some countries, cost to patients due to inadequate or
no AIT insurance coverage may be a deterrent to initiating AIT or
result in discontinuing treatment early. Further adding to cost is
that in the United States patients receiving SLIT-tablets are required
to be prescribed an epinephrine auto-injector. Epinephrine auto-
injectors are not mandated outside of the US, as the risk of
anaphylaxis is very low. Thus, adherence to AIT is variable and not
just related to patient motivation but also very much related to
product specific (i.e. year round treatment vs pre-and co-seasonal
treatment) and country specific factors. Therefore, adherence rates
may range from rates as low as 25%e84%.62e65
Conclusions/future directions of SLIT
SLIT-tablets have similar or superior efficacy when compared
to pharmacotherapies for AR and can provide clinically relevant
benefits for asthma patients. The safety of SLIT-tablets is favorable;
the self-administration of oral administration AIT provides a safe
and convenient alternative to traditional SCIT. As such, SLIT-tablets
should be considered as an alternative or add-on treatment to
pharmacotherapy for AR with or without conjunctivitis, and with
or without asthma.
There is now significant progress in the development of SLIT for
treatment of several respiratory allergies. The recent GAP trial has
demonstrated that early SLIT treatment may also prevent asthma
development. It, therefore, seems reasonable to consider even
earlier
intervention
with
immunotherapy,
e.g.
in
infancy.
The rationale is based on studies indicating that weakly primed
fetal Th2 responses are subjected to a variety of immunoregulatory
processes driven by direct contact with allergen from the outside
environment. The outcomes of which can include effective sup-
pression of allergen specific reactivity by T cell deletion/anergy,
further boosting of Th2 responses, or immune deviation towards
the Th1 cytokine pattern characteristic of adult non-atopic sub-
jects. Recent clinical trial data (LEAP, MAPS) are consistent with a
general model for postnatal control of allergen-specific T cell re-
sponses in which (as for the animal models) the nature of the
regulatory mechanisms employed is dictated by the respective oral
allergen exposure levels. High tolerance to food or inhalant anti-
gens which are encountered at high concentrations, may lead to
silencing of reactive T cells via anergy/deletion, versus immune
deviation (low tolerance) of weakly primed Th2 responses against
inhalants towards a Thl phenotype.69,70 This suggests that sub-
lingual immunotherapy with high daily allergen loads may be a
preferred way to administer high levels of aeroallergens to sup-
press Th2 immunity towards inhalant allergens and that early
immunotherapy may facilitate development of a normal Th1/Th2
balance. Thus, it may be possible to optimize the “mucosal toler-
ance” process by enhancing the level of allergen exposure via a
mucosal route in young children who have T cell responses that
can be most influenced toward tolerance. If successful, this
approach has the potential for long term (perhaps permanent)
protection against atopic sensitization and potentially the devel-
opment of asthma and other allergic disease.
