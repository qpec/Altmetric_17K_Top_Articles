Summary
Background Ebola virus has been detected in semen of Ebola virus disease survivors after recovery. Liberia’s Men’s 
Health Screening Program (MHSP) off
 ers Ebola virus disease survivors semen testing for Ebola virus. We present 
preliminary results and behavioural outcomes from the fi
 rst national semen testing programme for Ebola virus.
Methods The MHSP operates out of three locations in Liberia: Redemption Hospital in Montserrado County, Phebe 
Hospital in Bong County, and Tellewoyan Hospital in Lofa County. Men aged 15 years and older who had an Ebola 
treatment unit discharge certifi
 cate are eligible for inclusion. Participants’ semen samples were tested for Ebola virus 
RNA by real-time RT-PCR and participants received counselling on safe sexual practices. Participants graduated after 
receiving two consecutive negative semen tests. Counsellors collected information on sociodemographics and sexual 
behaviours using questionnaires administered at enrolment, follow up, and graduation visits. Because the programme 
is ongoing, data analysis was restricted to data obtained from July 7, 2015, to May 6, 2016.
Findings As of May 6, 2016, 466 Ebola virus disease survivors had enrolled in the programme; real-time RT-PCR 
results were available from 429 participants. 38 participants (9%) produced at least one semen specimen that tested 
positive for Ebola virus RNA. Of these, 24 (63%) provided semen specimens that tested positive 12 months or longer 
after Ebola virus disease recovery. The longest interval between discharge from an Ebola treatment unit and collection 
of a positive semen sample was 565 days. Among participants who enrolled and provided specimens more than 
90 days since their Ebola treatment unit discharge, men older than 40 years were more likely to have a semen sample 
test positive than were men aged 40 years or younger (p=0·0004). 84 (74%) of 113 participants who reported not using 
a condom at enrolment reported using condoms at their fi
 rst follow-up visit (p<0·0001). 176 (46%) of 385 participants 
who reported being sexually active at enrolment reported abstinence at their follow-up visit (p<0·0001). 
Interpretation Duration of detection of Ebola virus RNA by real-time RT-PCR varies by individual and might be 
associated with age. By combining behavioural counselling and laboratory testing, the Men’s Health Screening 
Program helps male Ebola virus disease survivors understand their individual risk and take appropriate measures to 
protect their sexual partners.

Introduction
In March, 2015, a 44-year-old female from Monrovia, 
Liberia, contracted Ebola virus disease and died in an 
Ebola treatment unit (ETU). An extensive investigation 
revealed one epidemiological link to Ebola virus 
exposure: unprotected sexual intercourse with a male 
Ebola virus disease survivor.1 A semen specimen 
collected from the Ebola virus disease survivor tested 
positive for Ebola virus RNA by real-time RT-PCR (rRT-
PCR) 199 days after he fi
 rst became ill with Ebola virus 
disease. Although no infectious virus was isolated from 
the semen, genetic analysis of the Ebola virus collected

from the semen of the Ebola virus disease survivor 
closely matched the Ebola virus recovered from the 
female patient.2
Based on virus-isolation results from previous Ebola 
virus disease and Marburg virus disease survivors,3–5 
Ebola virus disease survivors were encouraged to practice 
abstinence or use condoms for 90 days after recovering 
from the disease. However, the possibility of infectious 
Ebola virus persisting in the semen of survivors beyond 
this timeframe prompted WHO to issue new guidance. 
In May, 2015, WHO released interim guidance for male 
Ebola virus disease survivors.6 This interim guidance 
recommended the following: (1) in addition to receiving 
condoms and sexual risk reduction counselling at ETU 
discharge, all male survivors should be off
 ered semen 
testing for Ebola virus RNA by rRT-PCR until their 
semen tests negative twice for Ebola virus RNA; (2) male 
survivors and their sexual partners should be provided 
with condoms and receive counselling to ensure safe 
sexual practices until their semen has twice tested 
negative; and (3) if a survivor’s semen has not been 
tested, he should practise safe sex for at least 6 months 
after onset of symptoms.
At the time WHO released their interim guidance, 
semen testing for Ebola virus RNA was not widely 
available in Liberia. To address this gap, on July 7, 2015, 
the Liberian Ministry of Health, in collaboration with 
WHO, the Academic Consortium Combating Ebola in 
Liberia, and the US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), launched the Men’s Health Screening 
Program (MHSP). Based on the principles outlined in 
WHO’s interim guidance,6 the MHSP provides male 
Ebola virus disease survivors with semen testing for 
Ebola virus RNA by rRT-PCR and behavioural counselling 
on safe sex practices. We describe Liberia’s national 
semen testing programme for Ebola virus, present 
preliminary semen testing results, and report sexual risk 
behaviours.
Methods
Study design and participants
The MHSP operations manual is provided in the 
appendix (pp 2–34). The MHSP operates out of three 
locations in Liberia: Redemption Hospital in Montserrado 
County, Phebe Hospital in Bong County, and Tellewoyan 
Hospital in Lofa County (fi
 gure 1). Men are eligible to 
enrol if they are aged 15 years or older and can provide an 
ETU discharge certifi
 cate. Due to insuffi
  cient laboratory 
capacity and challenges in specimen transportation 
during the height of the Ebola virus disease outbreak in 
Liberia, laboratory confi
 rmation of Ebola virus infection 
was not available for all patients with suspected Ebola 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed and MEDLINE for the following search 
terms: “Ebola” and “sexual transmission”, “semen”, and “viral 
persistence”. The search was done from Nov 15, 2015, to 
May 30, 2016. Search results were then limited to research 
studies using RT-PCR or virus culture, or both, to detect the 
presence of Ebola virus in semen of survivors of Ebola virus 
disease. This search yielded seven articles. Four publications 
reported results for Ebola virus disease survivors of the 2014 
west Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak treated in west Africa. 
Of these, the largest cohort of Ebola virus disease survivors tested 
was 100. The longest period of time between disease onset and 
the detection of Ebola virus disease RNA by RT-PCR was 
276 days. Viral culture results were not reported in the four 
articles reporting semen test results of Ebola virus disease 
survivors cared for in west Africa. One article reported semen test 
results from fi
 ve male Ebola virus disease survivors cared for in 
the USA. The longest period of time between disease onset to 
the detection of Ebola virus disease RNA by RT-PCR in these men 
was 290 days. The highest cycle threshold value for the 
nucleoprotein gene target for semen specimens from which 
Ebola virus disease was isolated by viral culture was 30. 
Added value of this study
We describe the preliminary test results and behavioural 
outcomes for, to our knowledge, the fi
 rst national semen 
testing and counselling public health programme for Ebola 
virus disease survivors. We present serial RT-PCR semen test 
results for 429 Ebola virus disease survivors in Liberia, and 
report a possible association of age and the duration of 
detection of Ebola virus RNA by RT-PCR. We also report, to our 
knowledge, the longest interval between discharge from the 
Ebola treatment unit and the collection of a positive semen 
sample (565 days). We found that counselling paired with 
laboratory testing favourably aff
 ected reported condom use by 
men enrolled in the programme, with 74% of participants who 
reported not using a condom at enrolment subsequently 
reporting using a condom at their last sexual encounter.
Implications of all the available evidence
We found that the duration for which Ebola virus is detected in 
the semen of Ebola virus disease survivors varies by individual. 
As such, semen testing programmes that combine behavioural 
counselling and laboratory testing can play an important part 
in educating male survivors of Ebola virus disease of their risk of 
transmitting Ebola virus through sex and could potentially 
mitigate future outbreaks associated with sexual transmission. 
The Men’s Health Screening Program can serve as a model for 
future semen testing programmes for Ebola virus. We also 
found that the duration in which Ebola virus is detected in the 
semen of Ebola virus disease survivors might be associated with 
age. Future studies should be designed to investigate this 
possible association and to identify other factors that might be 
associated with prolonged viral persistence in semen.

virus disease.7–9  As such, possession of an ETU discharge 
certifi
 cate was used as proof of survival from the disease.
Potential programme participants are identifi
 ed 
through two primary methods: informational events held 
in conjunction with Ebola virus disease survivor 
association meetings and through the national Ebola 
virus disease survivor registry. Maintained by the Liberia 
Ministry of Health, as of June 17, 2015, the national Ebola 
virus disease survivor registry listed 1541 laboratory-
confi
 rmed Ebola virus disease survivors, 534 of whom 
were males individuals aged 15 years or older.
Created to implement a WHO-recommended semen 
testing programme for male Ebola virus disease 
survivors, the MHSP was granted a non-research 
determination by the CDC. On June 18, 2015, the Liberian 
Ministry of Health offi
  cially adopted the MHSP as a 
public health programme of Liberia. Programme 
participation was voluntary and written informed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
from 
participants 
before 
programme enrolment.
Procedures
Upon programme enrolment, trained counsellors collect 
information from enrollees on sociodemographics and 
sexual behaviours since ETU discharge of the enrollee 
using a standardised baseline questionnaire (panel; 
appendix pp 35–47); provide counselling on safe sexual 
practices (appendix pp 48–69); and provide condoms and 
instruction on condom use. Date of discharge from an 
ETU is established from the participant’s discharge 
certifi
 cate. Additionally, all participants receive a 
brochure listing health-care facilities that provide clinical 
care services to Ebola virus disease survivors. Participants 
presenting with physical or psychological complaints are 
referred for health-care services as needed or if requested. 
In keeping with the MHSP’s non-research status, data 
collection was limited to those items that directly aff
 ected 
programme delivery and services. As such, participants 
were not asked about any pre-existing medical disorders 
(eg, hypertension, diabetes, or HIV).
Participants were also asked to provide a semen sample 
for testing by rRT-PCR. After collection of the fi
 rst semen 
sample, the frequency of subsequent semen tests was 
dependent on the test result of the previous sample 
(fi
 gure 2). Participants whose previous semen sample 
tested positive for the presence of Ebola virus RNA were 
tested once a month. Participants whose previous semen 
sample did not detect Ebola virus RNA were tested every 
2 weeks, which is the minimum turnaround time for 
specimen transport and processing. In accordance with 
WHO guidelines,6,10 participants graduate from the 
programme after receiving two consecutive semen test 
results that do not detect the presence of Ebola virus 
RNA by rRT-PCR. Participants who are repeatedly unable 
to produce a specimen (at least three unsuccessful 
attempts) are referred for health-care services but may 
remain enrolled in the programme.
During follow-up visits, participants are informed of 
their individual rRT-PCR results, asked about their sexual

practices since their last visit using a standardised follow-
up questionnaire (panel), counselled on safe sexual 
practices, and provided with condoms. In addition to 
questions about their sexual practices, questions were 
added on Oct 20, 2015, to assess graduating participants’ 
satisfaction with programme services, and their 
confi
 dence in correctly putting on and taking off
  a 
condom (graduation questionnaire; panel). Consistent 
with other semen testing services for Ebola virus disease 
survivors in Liberia, MHSP participants were given US$5 
to cover transportation costs and $20 for semen samples.
The primary location for service delivery for both the 
enrolment and follow-up visits was the programme 
clinic. However, Ebola virus disease survivors who were 
unable to travel to the programme clinic were off
 ered 
services at a location of their choosing by a two-person 
mobile team composed of a counsellor and a semen 
technician. In addition to the services off
 ered in the 
clinic setting, participants who receive services from the 
mobile team were off
 ered the opportunity to include 
their sexual partners in their counselling sessions.
The risk reduction behavioural counselling used in the 
MHSP was adapted from the Ebola virus disease Viral 
Persistence Study in Sierra Leone.11 The goal of the 
counselling programme was to (1) encourage abstinence 
or condom use among programme participants until 
they had received two consecutive semen test results that 
did not detect the presence of Ebola virus RNA by rRT-
PCR; and (2) refer programme participants to available 
Ebola virus disease survivor services in the community 
as needed for other health concerns.
Behavioural counselling to reduce the risk of spreading 
Ebola virus disease was provided at each visit (appendix 
pp 48–69). At the fi
 rst visit, counsellors introduced the 
participant to the session; provided information about 
the semen rRT-PCR test; conveyed the importance of 
abstinence or condom use, or both, to reduce risk of 
transmitting Ebola virus; engaged the participant in a 
conversation regarding his sexual behaviour and intimate 
relationships; negotiated risk reduction steps with the 
participant; and demonstrated how to safely use and 
dispose of condoms using a wooden penis model. At 
each subsequent visit, counsellors delivered the semen 
test results from the previous visit, explained what the 
test results mean, and provided education on ways to 
reduce the risk of sexual transmission of the virus. These 
processes continued until the participant was discharged 
from the programme after having two consecutive 
negative semen test results. At all counselling sessions, 
counsellors asked participants to report any medical, 
psychosocial, or other issues they were experiencing. 
Counsellors referred these participants to appropriate 
health-care services.
All self-collected semen specimens submitted by the 
MHSP were stored and transported at –20°C or colder to 
the Tappita Ebola virus disease laboratory in Nimba 
County. Upon receipt in the laboratory, specimens were 
maintained at –20°C or colder until testing with the 
CDC’s Ebola Virus NP and VP40 Real-Time RT-PCR 
Assays (CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA).12 Briefl
 y, semen 
specimens were allowed to thaw for up to 30 min before 
total nucleic acid isolation using the MagMAX Pathogen 
RNA/DNA Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, 
USA). Inactivation of the semen specimen with MagMax 
lysis buff
 er (ThermoFisher Scientifi
 c, Waltham, MA, 
USA) was done in a glove box. After proper exterior 
decontamination of the vial, automated nucleic acid 
extraction was done using the BeadRetriever platform 
(Applied Biosystems). rRT-PCR was done on the Bio-
Rad CFX96 Touch (Hercules, CA, USA) instrument 
as per the Emergency Use Authorization protocols.12 
The combined Emergency Use Authorization assays 
detected specifi
 c sequences of the Ebola virus’ 
nucleoprotein and viral matrix protein (VP40) genes and 
the human RNase P gene that controlled for nucleic 
extraction and specimen quality. Samples of the 
extracted nucleic acids were stored at –70°C or colder for 
potential retesting.
Interpretation of the rRT-PCR results was done in a 
similar way to that described previously.11 Semen test

results were reported to the MHSP with target PCR cycle 
threshold values (ie, the number of cycles needed for the 
fl
 uorescent signal to exceed the background level) and 
interpretation. Specimens were deemed positive if both 
targets (nucleoprotein and VP40) were amplifi
 ed within 
40 cycles of replication. Specimens were deemed negative 
if neither of the Ebola virus targets was amplifi
 ed within 
40 cycles of replication and the RNase P target yielded 
amplifi
 cation in less than 30 cycles of replication. 
Specimens were considered indeterminate if only one 
of the Ebola targets showed positive amplifi
 cation. 
Specimens without amplifi
 cation of either Ebola virus 
target and RNase P amplifi
 cation of over 30 cycles of 
replication were judged to be of poor quality and re-
collection was requested. Testing of semen samples was 
limited to rRT-PCR because undertaking virus isolation 
was not possible in Liberia.
Statistical analysis
Data were collected through the use of questionnaires at 
baseline and all follow-up visits and were entered into a 
Microsoft Access database. We used the χ² test to test for 
an association between categorical variables and the 
Kruskal-Wallis test to test for a diff
 erence between the 
median of non-normally distributed numerical variables 
across categorical groups. McNemar’s test was used to 
test for diff
 erences between paired nominal data between 
baseline and the fi
 rst follow-up visit. We used SAS 
version 9.3 for data analysis. Because the programme is 
ongoing, data analysis was restricted to data obtained 
from July 7, 2015, to May 6, 2016.
Results
As of May 6, 2016, 466 Ebola virus disease survivors had 
enrolled in the programme. Median time from ETU 
discharge to programme enrolment was 384 days 
(range 7–697; table 1); four survivors who were a part of 
an Ebola virus disease cluster in July, 2015 (fi
 gure 1), were 
enrolled within 2 weeks of ETU discharge. The median 
age of participants was 33 years (range 15–79), 266 (57%) 
were residents of Montserrado County, and 79 (17%) 
chose to receive services from the mobile team.
rRT-PCR results were available for 429 of 466 pro 
-
gramme participants. Semen test results for nine 
participants were not available at the time of data analysis 
for this manuscript (May 6, 2016); fi
 ve cited personal or 
religious objections to masturbation; seven were unable to 
provide a semen specimen because of erectile dysfunction; 
two reported being unable to produce a specimen as a 
result of ongoing medical issues, one because he was 
recovering from a hernia operation and the other because 
of testicular pain; eight were lost to follow-up according to 
the programme protocol after missing several follow-up 
appointments despite several attempts to re-engage them; 
and six were unable to produce a specimen at enrolment 
and had follow-up appointments scheduled after the 
cutoff
  date for data analysis for this report (May 6, 2016). 
Among the 429 programme participants with rRT-PCR 
results, 38 (9%) had at least one semen sample test 
positive for Ebola virus RNA by rRT-PCR. The median 
age for those with positive Ebola virus results was 
40 years (range 18–68) compared with 32 years (15–70) 
for those who never had a positive test (table 2). The 
proportion of men reporting at least one sign or 
symptom of a sexually transmitted disease did not diff
 er 
between those who had at least one semen sample test 
positive for Ebola virus RNA (42%) and those who never 
had a semen sample test positive for Ebola virus RNA 
(39%; p=0·74).
24 (6%) of 429 participants provided semen specimens 
that tested positive for Ebola virus RNA at least 12 months 
after their ETU discharge. The longest interval between 
ETU discharge and the collection of a positive specimen 
was 18 months (565 days). One participant whose semen 
tested rRT-PCR positive more than 12 months after ETU 
discharge self-disclosed that he was diagnosed with HIV 
infection in 2009 and was taking antiretroviral therapy.
Ebola virus RNA was detected in the initial semen 
specimen of all four participants who were enrolled 
within 90 days of their ETU discharge, eight (22%) of 
37 enrolled within 181–270 days, ten (8%) of 123 enrolled 
within 271–360 days, 11 (8%) of 133 enrolled within

361–450 days, and fi
 ve (7%) of 72 enrolled within 
451–540 days (table 3). No participants were enrolled 
91–180 days after ETU discharge. 
In semen specimens collected within 90 days of ETU 
discharge, the mean cycle threshold value was 32·28 
(range 27·55–36·38) for VP40 and 33·37 (29·17–37·10) for 
nucleoprotein (table 4). After 90 days, mean cycle 
threshold values for both gene targets plateaued (VP40 
range of means 35·91–36·82, nucleoprotein 36·99–38·70).
Among participants who enrolled and provided 
specimens more than 90 days since their ETU discharge, 
men older than 40 years were more likely to have at least 
one semen sample test positive for Ebola virus RNA by 
rRT-PCR than were men aged 15–40 years (p=0·0004; 
table 5). Also, reported sexual frequency did not diff
 er 
between the two age groups (p=0·45). Participants who 
were tested within 90 days of ETU discharge were excluded 
from this analysis because Ebola virus persists in semen 
during this time period.3,5
427 (92%) of 466 participants reported being counselled 
by ETU staff
  to either abstain from sex or to use condoms 
for 90 days after recovering from Ebola virus disease. At 
enrolment, 424 (91%) participants reported having 
resumed sexual activity; 42 (9%) reported current 
abstinence (table 1). Of the 410 participants who reported 
the date they resumed sexual activity, 363 (89%) waited 
90 days or more after their ETU discharge before 
resuming sex. Frequency of sexual intercourse was not 
associated with age (p=0·41; appendix p 69). 
Of the 424 participants who reported resuming sexual 
activity on their initial enrolment questionnaire, 
190 (45%) reported using a condom the last time they 
had sexual intercourse. At the fi
 rst follow-up visit, 
84 (74%) of 113 participants who reported not 
using condoms at enrolment reported use at their 
last 
sexual 
encounter 
(intrasubject 
comparison 
between enrolment and follow-up visit: p<0·0001). At 
graduation, 80 (76%) of 105 participants who reported 
not using condoms at enrolment reported use at 
their last sexual encounter (intrasubject comparison 
between 
enrolment 
and 
graduation: 
p<0·0001). 
Additionally, 176 (46%) of 385 participants for whom 
follow-up data were available who reported being 
sexually active at enrolment reported abstinence at the 
fi
 rst follow-up visit (intrasubject comparison between 
enrolment 
and 
fi
 rst 
follow-up: 
p<0·0001). 
At 
graduation, 109 (36%) of 300 participants who reported 
being sexually active at enrolment and for whom 
graduation data were available reported abstinence 
(intrasubject comparison between enrolment and 
graduation visit: p<0·0001).
326 participants graduated from the programme after 
two consecutive semen samples tested negative for Ebola 
virus RNA. 24 (63%) of 38 participants who had at least one 
semen sample that tested positive for the presence of Ebola 
virus RNA have graduated from the programme. The 
median time from programme enrolment to graduation 
was 50 days (range 24–226). Of the 299 programme 
graduates who were asked, 290 (97%) reported that they 
would refer a family member or friend to participate in the 
semen testing programme and 257 (86%) shared or 
planned to share their semen tests results with their sexual 
partners. Of the 294 programme graduates who provided a 
response to the graduation questionnaire question about 
confi
 dence with condom use, 220 (75%) reported feeling 
“very confi
 dent” about knowing how to correctly put on 
and take off
  a condom, 52 (18%) reported feeling 
“somewhat confi
 dent”, and 22 (7%) reported feeling “not 
confi
 dent” or “not at all confi
 dent”.
Discussion
Among participants enrolled in the MHSP, 38 (9%) of 
429 produced at least one semen sample that tested 
positive for Ebola virus RNA by rRT-PCR. Of these, 
24 provided semen specimens that tested positive for the 
presence of Ebola virus RNA at least 12 months after 
ETU discharge. The longest interval between ETU

discharge to the collection of a positive semen sample 
among MHSP participants was 565 days, which exceeds 
previously 
reported 
time 
intervals.11,13,14 
However, 
detection of Ebola virus RNA by rRT-PCR does not 
necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus.3,5,9,11
Consistent with fi
 ndings from previous studies,11,14 the 
lowest mean rRT-PCR values for both gene targets 
occurred in MHSP participants who were within 
3 months of ETU discharge. Also consistent with 
fi
 ndings from previous studies,11,13,14 the total number of 
MHSP participants whose semen tested positive for the 
presence of Ebola virus RNA declined over time. Unlike 
fi
 ndings from previous studies,11,14 the mean cycle 
threshold values for both gene targets for MHSP 
participants seemed to plateau. Although some of these 
diff
 erences probably occurred because this study had a 
larger sample size and longer follow-up period than 
previous studies, this fi
 nding also suggests that 
heterogeneity exists in Ebola virus persistence in semen 
among survivors of Ebola virus disease.
Among men for whom more than 90 days had passed 
since their ETU discharge, age older than 40 years seemed 
to be a factor in the likelihood of having at least one 
semen sample test positive for Ebola virus RNA by rRT-
PCR. This possible association, to our knowledge, has not 
been reported previously and the reason for this fi
 nding 
is not clear. Also, for men enrolled in the programme, 
reported sexual frequency was not associated with age. In 
view of these fi
 ndings, diff
 erences in the persistence of 
Ebola virus RNA in semen might be a result of age-related 
factors such as changes in semen composition15,16 or age-
related changes in immune function. Because participants 
are not asked about pre-existing medical disorders, 
sustained viral persistence in semen could also be a result 
of the presence of other immunocompromising 
disorders, such as HIV or diabetes.
91% of men reported having resumed sexual activity at 
the time of programme enrolment. This fi
 nding is not 
surprising because the programme launched 9 months 
after the peak of the Ebola virus disease outbreak in 
Liberia. Initial examination of condom use and abstinence 
showed that counselling, paired with laboratory testing, 
led to a reduction in reported high-risk sexual behaviours. 
This reduction was noted at the fi
 rst follow-up visit and at 
programme graduation. However, because these measures 
are all self-reported, the implications of these fi
 ndings are 
limited by social desirability bias.
Preliminary data analysis of participants enrolled in the 
MHSP suggests that duration of detection of Ebola virus 
RNA by rRT-PCR varies by individual and might be 
associated with age. In view of this fi
 nding, semen testing 
programmes such as the MHSP, which combine 
behavioural counselling with laboratory testing, can play 
an important part in educating male Ebola virus disease 
survivors of their risk of transmitting Ebola virus through 
sex and could potentially mitigate future outbreaks 
associated with sexual transmission. However, our 
experience shows that implementing and sustaining such 
a programme is time and resource intensive. Health-care 
facilities caring for survivors after ETU discharge should 
off
 er semen testing and behavioural counselling as part of 
a standard package of health-care services. In addition to 
fostering a holistic approach to survivor care, integration 
would probably reduce the time and costs associated with 
implementing a semen testing programme and ensure a 
better surveillance for potential future transmission events.
