BACKGROUND: Healthcare provider burnout is consid-
ered a factor in quality of care, yet little is known about the
consistency and magnitude of this relationship. This
meta-analysis examined relationships between provider
burnout (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and
reduced personal accomplishment) and the quality (per-
ceived quality, patient satisfaction) and safety of
healthcare.
METHODS: Publications were identified through targeted
literature searches in Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of
Science, CINAHL, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses
through March of 2015. Two coders extracted data to
calculate effect sizes and potential moderators. We calcu-
lated Pearson’s r for all independent relationships be-
tween burnout and quality measures, using a random
effects model. Data were assessed for potential impact of
study rigor, outliers, and publication bias.
RESULTS: Eighty-two studies including 210,669
healthcare providers were included. Statistically signifi-
cant negative relationships emerged between burnout
and quality (r = −0.26, 95 % CI [−0.29, −0.23]) and safety
(r = −0.23, 95 % CI [−0.28, −0.17]). In both cases, the
negative relationship implied that greater burnout among
healthcare providers was associated with poorer-quality
healthcare and reduced safety for patients. Moderators
for the quality relationship included dimension of burn-
out, unit of analysis, and quality data source. Moderators
for the relationship between burnout and safety were
safety indicator type, population, and country. Rigor of
the study was not a significant moderator.
DISCUSSION: This is the first study to systematically,
quantitatively analyze the links between healthcare pro-
vider burnout and healthcare quality and safety across
disciplines. Provider burnout shows consistent negative
relationships with perceived quality (including patient
satisfaction), quality indicators, and perceptions of safety.
Though the effects are small to medium, the findings
highlight the importance of effective burnout interven-
tions for healthcare providers. Moderator analyses sug-
gest contextual factors to consider for future study.

INTRODUCTION
Professional burnout is characterized by high levels of emo-
tional exhaustion, cynical attitudes, and a diminished sense of
personal accomplishment at work.1 A number of reviews have
highlighted the problematic nature of burnout for a variety of
healthcare professions, including medical residents,2 nurses,3
and mental health workers.4, 5 Recent changes in healthcare
delivery have also raised concerns that provider burnout may
worsen if increased patient care and administrative demands
outpace resources.6 Indeed, a recent national study found
significant increases in burnout among physicians compared
to the general population.7
Burnout is associated with a number of problems, not only
for individual providers, but also for their employer organiza-
tions, patients, and the healthcare system as a whole. Workers
with burnout often experience physical health problems (e.g.,
insomnia, headaches, poor overall health), relationship prob-
lems, reduced job satisfaction, and increased mental health
problems (e.g., depression, anxiety, substance abuse).8–15 Burn-
out has also been negatively associated with organizational
functioning, including excessive employee absences, tardiness,
frequent breaks, reduced job commitment, and in some studies,
poor job performance and increased turnover.11, 13, 16, 17
Burnout can impact healthcare quality and safety in a num-
ber of ways. According to the job demands-resources model of
burnout,18–21 job demands (e.g., interacting with patients with
intensive service needs, balancing competing priorities) re-
quire effort over time and can result in costs to the healthcare
provider (e.g., emotional exhaustion), particularly when re-
sources are low. As providers become exhausted, they with-
draw emotional energy from work, leading to depersonaliza-
tion. This conservation of resources20 can also lead to pro-
viders spending less time with patients, and potentially be-
coming more directive than collaborative and patient-centered.
Furthermore, burnout has been associated with cognitive im-
pairments, including attention deficits,22 which can lead to

 errors. Williams and colleagues23 describe a cyclical model
whereby burnout negatively affects the quality of the patient
encounter, leading to dissatisfied patients, poor adherence, and
worse health outcomes, which can cause additional provider
burnout.
While links between burnout and quality of care have been
theorized since the term burnout was introduced,24 research
empirically linking burnout to quality of care has varied wide-
ly across healthcare specialties and types of quality domains
(e.g., patient satisfaction, self-reported quality, errors). Some
studies have reviewed aspects of these relationships, but none
has attempted a comprehensive, quantitative review across
disciplines and domains. For example, the relationship be-
tween burnout and job performance was summarized,25 but
this meta-analysis included only 16 studies, was not restricted
to healthcare settings, and included limited measures of per-
formance. Within healthcare, Lee and colleagues26 studied
correlates of burnout, but the sample was restricted to physi-
cians, and few studies assessed quality. Another review27 took
a broader approach, including a variety of healthcare profes-
sionals, but restricted studies to hospital settings, and because
it was a narrative review, the authors were unable to quantify
relationships or assess other contributing variables.
The objective of the current study was to systematically
review and quantify empirical studies linking healthcare pro-
vider burnout to quality and safety in order to better under-
stand the magnitude and consistency of these relationships.
We explored potential moderators to examine whether the
relationships would vary as a function of the aspect of burnout
or quality being studied. Given the importance of multidisci-
plinary teams in patient-centered care,28, 29 we included a
variety of healthcare providers, and explored possible differ-
ences among provider types (e.g., nurses vs. physicians) and
settings (inpatient vs. outpatient). We hypothesized that there
would be negative relationships between each aspect of burn-
out (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced
personal accomplishment) and quality and safety. We further
hypothesized that the effects would be largest for provider
perceptions, compared to more objective indicators of quality
(e.g., observation or medical records). Other relationships
were considered exploratory.
METHODS
Data Sources and Searches
We followed guidelines provided by the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA).30 A systematic literature search of Ovid
MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, and
ProQuest Dissertations & Theses was conducted to identify
all studies involving health professionals, burnout, and quality
of care through March 2015. The full electronic search string
used for PsycINFO included the following: ((DE
Boccupational stress^) AND (SU Bburnout^)) AND ((DE
Bquality of care^) OR (DE Bquality of services^) OR (DE
Bsatisfaction^) OR (DE Bclient satisfaction^) OR (DE
Bsafety^) OR (DE Bperceived quality^)). Similar search strat-
egies were used for the other databases. All search strategies
and the coding protocol are available from the authors.
Study Selection
We included published and unpublished studies of any design
(e.g., cross-sectional surveys, intervention studies), as long as
empirical data was used to assess the relationship between
burnout and quality (including patient satisfaction) and/or safe-
ty; if these variables were assessed but the bivariate association
was not reported, the authors were contacted to gather addition-
al data for analyses. Attempts were made to contact 63 authors,
of whom 21 provided usable data, 6 responded that data did not
meet inclusion criteria or could not be obtained, 3 could not be
located, and 33 did not respond. Although review articles were
not included in our analyses, we examined reference sections of
review articles to identify primary studies for inclusion.
We retained articles that specifically examined burnout. The
Maslach31 three-dimensional scale of burnout (emotional ex-
haustion, depersonalization or cynicism, and reduced personal
accomplishment) was used most often, although any study
measuring at least one dimension of burnout or a global
burnout score was included. We focused on healthcare pro-
viders and excluded studies of burnout in other occupations
(e.g., education, probation officers, vocational rehabilitation).
We categorized quality of care along two dimensions: per-
ceived quality (rating scales or items reflecting provider’s
perception, patient satisfaction) and safety (perceived safety,
adverse events, Bnear misses,^ medical errors). Included stud-
ies are briefly summarized in Table 1 of the supplemental
online material.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Articles were coded independently by a pair of coders (from a
group of six coders comprising a clinical psychologist and five
doctoral students). To maintain consistency and ensure reli-
ability, coders met to review and come to consensus for each
independent sample. We extracted information on burnout
type and measure(s) used, quality and safety indicators, pro-
vider type (nurses, physicians, interdisciplinary), setting (out-
patient, inpatient, or mixed inpatient/outpatient), and country
(coded by region: North America, South America, Europe,
Asia, Australia, Africa). Where available, we coded provider
characteristics (age, gender, experience/length of time in the
field) and patient characteristics (age, gender). We extracted
information on potential methods-related moderators includ-
ing study year, unit of analysis (individual, dyad, service unit,
hospital/organization), and quality or safety data source (pro-
vider, patient, observer, medical records).
We rated the quality of each study to account for bias in
individual studies (see Table 2 of the supplemental online
material). Because quality rubrics commonly recommended
476

 for meta-analyses32, 33 include items not relevant for correla-
tional designs (e.g., blinding, allocation of intervention), we
created items based on common sources of bias in observa-
tional studies.34, 35 We tested and refined the initial rating
system on several studies before rating the full sample. Two
raters independently coded each study; disagreements were
resolved through discussion. Measures of central tendency
highlighted the presence of eight items as a potentially valu-
able cutpoint (mean = 8.12, median and mode = 8). Following
other meta-analyses that examined subgroups based on quality
ratings,36–38 we used quality rating as a moderator, examining
the effect sizes for those with high quality (8 or above)
compared to effect sizes of studies scoring below 8.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
We extracted effect size information at the level of burnout and
quality (or safety) relationship. All associations were first con-
verted into Pearson’s correlations; Fisher’s Z-transformation was
conducted to adjust for the non-normal distribution of Pearson’s
r. When a study reported multiple measures of the same con-
struct, we averaged the effect sizes and weighted them by
sample size in order to maintain statistical independence.39 We
calculated an overall relationship, with one effect size per inde-
pendent sample, to describe the relationships between burnout
and perceived quality and safety. We conducted separate meta-
analyses to examine the relationships aggregated at the level of
predictor (burnout type) and aggregated at the level of the quality
indicator (perceived quality and safety). We conducted modera-
tor analyses for perceived quality and safety.
We used a random effects model to calculate the mean effect
sizes using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software,
version 2.40 At the aggregate level, Z-scores and confidence
intervals were examined to determine the statistical signifi-
cance of each association. The strength of the mean effect sizes
were interpreted in light of Cohen’s41 recommendation for
correlations, where 0.10 is small, 0.30 is medium, and 0.50
is large. We conducted one-study-removed sensitivity analy-
ses to determine whether any single sample unduly influenced
the results (indicating a potential outlier); because the point
estimate of the mean effect size did not change substantially
upon removal of any study, we performed the remainder of the
analyses with the full sample.
We examined heterogeneity with the Q-statistic and the I2
index; a significant Q-statistic informs whether moderation
may be present, and the I2 index informs the extent of the
heterogeneity, ranging from 0 to 100 %, with higher values
indicating greater heterogeneity.42–44 Although I2 is of value
in determining the need for moderation analyses, it does not
speak to the source of heterogeneity or dispersion of effects.45
We used I2 values of 25 % or more as a cutoff to examine the
presence of moderators, as this suggests that between-study
variability in effect size is greater than expected by chance.43
To document dispersion of effects, we report 95 % confidence
intervals for each effect size.
We tested study-level moderators for both quality and safe-
ty, including year, type of report, provider type and setting,
region, and quality of study. Additional moderators for burn-
out and perceived quality included burnout type, quality
source, and unit of analysis. Additional moderator analysis
for safety compared perceived safety (e.g., questionnaires)
versus events (e.g., reported adverse events, near misses).
For categorical moderators, we used an analysis of variance
(ANOVA) analog. To test continuous moderator variables, we
conducted random effects meta-regressions using unrestricted
maximum likelihood estimation. Because meta-regressions
use list-wise deletion, each moderator was examined indepen-
dently to maximize the number of studies included in the
analysis. Continuous moderators were considered significant
if beta weights were significant and I2 decreased. We
interpreted statistical tests at p < 0.05. All moderator analyses
were conducted in CMA, version 2.40
Finally, we assessed the potential influence of publication
bias by examining funnel plots and testing for asymmetry
using Egger’s46 regression approach. Although Egger’s test
may be prone to bias in low-power situations, our sample size
was well beyond the recommended minimum of ten sam-
ples.47 In addition, Failsafe N was not appropriate because of
the high level of study heterogeneity and the random effects
model used.39
RESULTS
The search yielded 1674 citations, resulting in 102 studies
with 82 unique samples of healthcare providers (see Fig. 1
for PRISMA flow diagram30). A summary description of the
included studies appears in Table 1, and a detailed table
showing each study including individual effect sizes is pre-
sented in Table 1 of the supplemental online material. A total
of 210,669 healthcare providers were included, from 32 coun-
tries on 6 continents. The majority of studies measured at least
the emotional exhaustion component of burnout; about half
studied depersonalization and reduced personal accomplish-
ment. Some (19.5 %) included a total or global measure of
burnout. Most assessed perceived quality, and about half
assessed safety. Most studies took place in a setting that
included both inpatient and outpatient care. Nurses were the
most frequent target populations.
The meta-analysis of the relationship between burnout and
perceived quality including 63 independent samples resulted
in a significant negative relationship (r = −0.26), with 95 % CI
ranging from −0.29 to −0.23. The Q-statistic of the overall
effect was significant, with a large amount of heterogeneity
(I2 = 93 %). A second meta-analysis was conducted between
burnout and safety, including 40 independent samples, which
also yielded a significant negative relationship (r = −0.23) and
95 % CI ranging from −0.28 to −0.17. The burnout–safety
relationship also demonstrated high levels of heterogeneity
(I2 = 97 %). Forest plots for the meta-analyses of perceived

 quality and safety are shown in Tables 3 and 4 of the supple-
mental online material.
Moderator analyses for the relationship between burnout
and perceived quality are shown in Table 2. Three categorical
moderators were significant: type of burnout, unit of analysis,
and source of quality rating. The relationship between burnout
and perceived quality was strongest for emotional exhaustion
(r = −0.27) or overall burnout (r = −0.25), whereas effects for
depersonalization (r = −0.21) and reduced personal accom-
plishment (r = −0.20) were weaker but still significant. Effect
sizes were significantly stronger when examining individuals
(r = −0.27) compared to service units (r = −0.12). Effect sizes
were significantly stronger for provider report (r = −0.28)
compared with patient reports of quality (i.e., patient satisfac-
tion, r = −0.17). No continuous moderators were significant
predictors.
Moderators for the safety meta-analyses are shown in
Table 3. None of the continuous moderators were significant,
but three categorical moderators were identified: safety indi-
cator, study population, and the country in which the study
was conducted. Though both types of safety indicators were
statistically significant, burnout had a stronger relationship
with perceptions of safety (r = −0.28) than events
(r = −0.16). In terms of discipline, the strongest relationship
was for nurses (r = −0.27), followed by interdisciplinary sam-
ples (r = −0.24) and physicians (r = −0.15). Regarding coun-
try, effect sizes were stronger in studies from Europe

 (r = −0.36) than in those from North America (r = −0.18).
Discipline, however, was confounded with location. Most
European studies with safety outcomes consisted of nursing
samples (78 %), whereas only 26 % of North American studies
focused on nursing samples. Follow-up analyses to parse the
overlap in these results indicated that in North American
studies, nurses (r = −0.22) and physicians (r = −0.15) did not
differ in relationships between burnout and safety (Q = 0.59,
df = 1, p = 0.44). There were not enough studies of physicians
within the European sample to conduct a parallel analysis.
We created a funnel plot, displaying overall study effect as a
function of precision (calculated as 1/SE; see Figures 1 and 2
in supplemental online material). Egger’s test of the intercept
was not significant for either perceived quality (t = 1.13, p =
0.26) or safety (t = 0.72, p = 0.48). As both meta-analyses had
substantially more than the recommended minimum number
of ten samples,47, 48 the lack of significance suggests that
publication bias did not influence these findings.
DISCUSSION
Summarizing all available empirical literature on
healthcare provider burnout, we found small to
medium-sized relationships between burnout and both
decreased quality of care and decreased safety. For
perceived quality, the effect size of r = −0.26 translates
into approximately 7 % of variance accounted for by
provider burnout. For safety, the effect size of r = −0.23
translates into approximately 5 % of the variance in
safety being attributable to provider burnout. These re-
lationships were robust to potential publication bias and
ratings of study rigor, which increases confidence in the
findings. Given the increasing rates of burnout, particu-
larly among physicians,7 these findings could have im-
portant ramifications.
Of the burnout components, emotional exhaustion had the
strongest relationship with quality, followed by depersonali-
zation and reduced personal accomplishment. These findings
parallel a meta-analysis of burnout and objective job perfor-
mance in other service industries.25 Together, these findings
suggest that emotional exhaustion may be the most critical
element of burnout to address. Earlier conceptualizations of
burnout also posit a primary role for emotional
exhaustion—that it may be the driving element that leads to
other aspects of burnout.49
In terms of quality, burnout had a medium-sized rela-
tionship with lower perceived (provider-reported) quality
and a weaker, but still significant, relationship with
reduced patient satisfaction. This is important, given
the increasing role of satisfaction as a benchmark for
performance evaluations. Medicare payments are now

 tied to performance outcomes, which began with, and
still include, patient satisfaction.50 In addition, satisfac-
tion has important implications for retaining patients in
competitive markets and for engaging patients in good
self-care strategies, both of which could impact patient
outcomes over the long term. For example, relationship
variables such as working alliance51 and perceptions of
patient-centered care52,
53 have important associations
with improved patient outcomes. In an era of increasing
attention to collaborative care, burnout may be interfer-
ing with the provision of optimal care.
The relationship between burnout and safety risk is of
particular concern. Similar to quality, the relationships
were stronger for self-reported perceptions of safety (all
provider-reported), yet a significant negative correlation
(−0.18) was still found for safety events (i.e., errors and
adverse events), some of which included external sources
of data such as medical records or observer ratings. Al-
though the effect size translates into about 3 % of the
variance, these findings represent an instance where small
statistical effects are still noteworthy;54 provider burnout
may contribute in part to real-world outcomes for patients,
putting them at higher risk of an error or adverse event. In
addition to the obvious implications for patient health and
well-being, a greater number of errors also leads to greater
liability for healthcare organizations.
Moderator analyses for safety suggest that the impact of
burnout might be greater for nurses than for physicians or
mixed provider samples. This finding is consistent with
research showing that nursing care is more predictive of
patient ratings of quality than physician care.55 As noted
by Leiter and colleagues56 in one of the first studies
linking nurse burnout with patient satisfaction, nurses
have more direct patient contact and perform more of
the daily care activities than other healthcare professionals
such as physicians, which may have a more central impact
on patients. Alternatively, there may be a reporting bias,
as nurses have been shown to report more minor errors
and safety events than physicians.57 However, subsequent
analyses suggest that geographic location might be the
driving factor. European samples, which were predomi-
nantly based on studies of nurses, showed stronger rela-
tionships between burnout and safety than those conduct-
ed in North America. It is possible that systemic differ-
ences across countries in how healthcare services are
provided or experienced could affect the relationship be-
tween provider burnout and safety. For example, Aiken
and colleagues58 found wide variability in nurse- and
patient-reported safety and quality across 12 countries,
and those samples were included in our study. More
research is needed to clarify which explanation is most
accurate.

Salyers et al.: Burnout, Quality of Care, and Safety
JGIM
 As a meta-analysis, this study is limited by some of the
same constraints as the primary studies examined. Studies
were predominantly cross-sectional. Thus, while the con-
sistent negative relationships between burnout and both
quality and safety indicators suggest that provider burnout
may be negatively impacting healthcare, we cannot rule
out the possibility that poor quality itself could contribute
to increased burnout, or that other factors (e.g., negative
organizational culture) may be causing both burnout and
poor quality. Cross-sectional studies may also limit our
ability to detect delayed consequences of burnout, such as
a gradual erosion of quality or safety over time, or the
impact of burnout on staff turnover that subsequently
impacts quality and safety in clinical settings. Studies
were predominantly based on self-reports, and few used
objective indicators of quality. At the same time, the
findings regarding patient satisfaction and some studies
of safety events did include external sources of data. The
fact that these were still significantly related to burnout
suggests that the relationships go beyond common method
variance. Furthermore, the majority of studies were at the
level of the individual provider, despite the fact that team-
based care models are the norm. More research is needed
on the impact of burnout within a team. For example, it is
possible that the impact of one team member with burnout
on the total delivery of care would not be enough to affect
outcomes; alternatively, burnout may be subject to a
Bcontagion effect,^59 in which one or a few burned-out
team members could negatively impact the whole team.
Finally, meta-analyses were characterized by high levels
of heterogeneity; in most moderator analyses, I2 values
remained above 25 %, indicating likely additional moder-
ators. Future studies should continue to investigate rela-
tionships between burnout and healthcare quality and
safety, including potential moderators not examined here.
Similarly, the overall effects accounted for less than 10 %
of the variance in quality and safety. Clearly, provider
burnout is not the primary factor in these outcomes. How-
ever, our findings do suggest a consistent role, perhaps as
an important contextual variable, in addition to other
predictors of quality and safety (e.g., organizational poli-
cies, staffing ratios, communication).
Despite limitations, this study has several notable
strengths. It is the first to systematically, quantitatively
analyze the links between healthcare provider burnout
and healthcare quality and safety across disciplines. We
aggregated findings from a large number of independent
samples; analyses suggested that publication bias and
study rigor were not important factors in our findings. In
addition, the studies spanned 6 continents and 33 coun-
tries, enhancing the generalizability of the results. Taken
together, our findings suggest that healthcare provider
burnout is an important area for future research and a
target for intervention that could have benefits for pro-
viders, patients, and the healthcare system at large.
