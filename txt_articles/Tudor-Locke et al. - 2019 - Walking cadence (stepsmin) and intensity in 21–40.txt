Abstract
Background: Previous studies have reported that walking cadence (steps/min) is associated with absolutely-defined
intensity (metabolic equivalents; METs), such that cadence-based thresholds could serve as reasonable proxy values
for ambulatory intensities.
Purpose: To establish definitive heuristic (i.e., evidence-based, practical, rounded) thresholds linking cadence with
absolutely-defined moderate (3 METs) and vigorous (6 METs) intensity.
Methods: In this laboratory-based cross-sectional study, 76 healthy adults (10 men and 10 women representing
each 5-year age-group category between 21 and 40 years, BMI = 24.8 ± 3.4 kg/m2) performed a series of 5-min
treadmill bouts separated by 2-min rests. Bouts began at 0.5 mph and increased in 0.5 mph increments until
participants: 1) chose to run, 2) achieved 75% of their predicted maximum heart rate, or 3) reported a Borg
rating of perceived exertion > 13. Cadence was hand-tallied, and intensity (METs) was measured using a portable
indirect calorimeter. Optimal cadence thresholds for moderate and vigorous ambulatory intensities were identified
using a segmented regression model with random coefficients, as well as Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
models. Positive predictive values (PPV) of candidate heuristic thresholds were assessed to determine final
heuristic values.
Results: Optimal cadence thresholds for 3 METs and 6 METs were 102 and 129 steps/min, respectively, using
the regression model, and 96 and 120 steps/min, respectively, using ROC models. Heuristic values were set at
100 steps/min (PPV of 91.4%), and 130 steps/min (PPV of 70.7%), respectively.
Conclusions: Cadence thresholds of 100 and 130 steps/min can serve as reasonable heuristic thresholds
representative of absolutely-defined moderate and vigorous ambulatory intensity, respectively, in 21–40 year
olds. These values represent useful proxy values for recommending and modulating the intensity of ambulatory
behavior and/or as measurement thresholds for processing accelerometer data.

Introduction
Objective monitoring of physical activity has quickly
advanced since the millennium with the increasing and
widespread availability of a variety of research- and
consumer-grade wearable technologies. It is evident, how-
ever, that despite the diversity of design, most technologies
capable of monitoring the wearer’s physical activity offer
step counting as one of the detectable metrics. Step count-
ing has been embraced by researchers [1], clinicians [2], and
consumers [3] as an intuitively simple approach to commu-
nicating physical activity volume, expressed typically as
steps/day. More recently, it has become recognized that the
time-stamped sampling nature of accelerometry-based phys-
ical activity monitors also uniquely lends itself to the
minute-by-minute study of ambulatory behavior in terms of
cadence (steps/min) enacted in free-living contexts [4].
Cadence and stride length combine to determine
speed of ambulation. Cadence is the principal strategy

 for increasing over-ground ambulatory speed, at least up
to a self-selected preferred speed [5]. At least six studies
[6–11] have proposed a cadence of 100 steps/min as a
reasonable heuristic threshold (evidence-based, practical,
rounded value) associated with absolutely-defined mod-
erate intensity (3 metabolic equivalents, METs; 1 MET =
3.5 mL/kg/min of O2 consumption), which is the min-
imal level of intensity recommended in public health
physical activity guidelines [12, 13]. Further investigation
is required to confirm this heuristic threshold in a pur-
posefully sex-and-age structured sample, and also to
consider other cadence thresholds across a broader
spectrum of MET-determined levels of intensity up to
and including vigorous intensity (i.e., 3, 4, 5, and 6
METs). This information is critical to providing a
minimally processed and translatable objectively mon-
itored
metric
with
established
intensity
thresholds
across the lifespan.
The primary aim of the CADENCE-Adults study was
to identify heuristic cadence thresholds associated with
increasing
intensity during walking. It
expands
on
CADENCE-Kids, a preliminary study of cadence and in-
tensity in 6–20 year olds [14]. This initial manuscript in
the adult data series reports sex-and-age balanced data
collected
from
21
to
40 year
olds
(comparable
to
previously published samples). It represents the first in-
stallment in a planned series arising from the CADENCE-
Adults study which upon completion will establish
heuristic cadence-intensity thresholds for walking across
the adult lifespan of 21–85 years old.
Methods
Study design and regulatory information
CADENCE-Adults is a laboratory-based cross-sectional
study, conducted in the Physical Activity and Health La-
boratory, Department of Kinesiology, University of Mas-
sachusetts Amherst. The study protocol was approved
by the University of Massachusetts Amherst Institutional
Review Board. Informed consent was obtained from all
participants prior to enrolment and data collection.
The study was also registered with Clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT02650258). Study recruitment for this cohort
(21–40 year olds) began in December 2015, and the data
was collected between January and October, 2016.
Participants and sample size calculation
Based on unpublished pilot testing, we determined that
a minimum sample size of 8 participants per 5-year age
category between 21 and 40 years (21–25, 26–30, 31–35,
36–40 years of age) was required to estimate the sample
mean value of cadence associated with 3 METs to
within ±10 steps/min with 95% confidence. To ensure
a balanced sex-and-age distribution across the targeted
age range, and to accommodate for the possibility of
attrition and/or incomplete data, 10 men and 10 women
for each 5-year age-group category were recruited, for a
total of 80 participants. This strategic recruitment plan
minimizes important sources of bias (i.e., sex and age) and
improves the generalizability of the findings. Because the
study’s intended focus was on ambulatory activity, poten-
tial participants who used wheelchairs or had other
impairments that prevented normal ambulation were ex-
cluded. Additional exclusion criteria were Stage 2 hyperten-
sion (systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic blood
pressure ≥ 100 mmHg), current tobacco use, hospitalization
for mental illness within the previous 5 years, body mass
index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/m2 or > 40 kg/m2, cardiovascular dis-
ease or stroke, conditions or medications that could affect
heart rate response to exercise, pacemakers or other im-
planted medical devices, and pregnancy. The 2013 edition
of the American College of Sports Medicine Resources for
The Health Fitness Specialist as well as the American Heart
Association’s risk stratification recommendations presented
in the same American College of Sports Medicine resource
[12] were used to establish risk stratification. Following this
screening process, low risk individuals were enrolled in the
study and prepared for metabolic testing. Moderate risk in-
dividuals were also enrolled in the study and prepared for
metabolic testing, but with blood pressure monitored
throughout the procedures. High risk individuals received a
physical examination including a resting electrocardiogram
test prior to testing.
Measures
Race/ethnicity was self-reported and captured for de-
scriptive purposes.
Standing Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm
(without
shoes)
using
a
wall-mounted
stadiometer
(ShorrBoard® Infant/Child/Adult Portable Height-Length
Measuring Board; Weigh and Measure LLC, Olney,
Maryland, USA). Measurements were repeated and a
third measurement was taken if the first two differed by
> 0.3 cm. The two closest measurements were averaged.
Leg Length was derived from seated height measured
to the nearest 0.1 cm with a stadiometer. The participant
was seated on a bench with their legs hanging freely and
hands set on knees. Again, measurements were repeated
and a third measurement was taken if the first two dif-
fered by > 0.3 cm. The two closest measurements were
averaged. Seated height reflects the difference between
the floor-to-crown measure and the static height of the
bench. Leg length was then calculated by subtracting the
seated height from standing height.
Weight was assessed (without socks or shoes) using
a scale (DC-430 U; Tanita Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).
Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg. Again, up
to three measurements were taken if the first two
Tudor-Locke et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity            (2019) 16:8 
Page 2 of 11
 measurements differed by > 0.5 kg. The two closest
measurements were averaged.
Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated by dividing
body weight by height squared (kg/m2). BMI-determined
weight categories were: normal or healthy weight (18.5–
24.9 kg/m2),
overweight
(25.0–29.9 kg/m2),
or
obese
(≥30 kg/m2) [15].
Waist Circumference was measured using a non-elastic
anthropometric measuring tape to the nearest 0.1 cm.
The measurement was taken at the narrowest point be-
tween the iliac crest and lower costal border. Two mea-
surements were taken, with a third required only if the
first two differed by > 0.5 cm. The two closest measure-
ments were averaged.
Physical Activity Intensity (oxygen consumption; VO2
mL/kg/min) was measured using a validated portable in-
direct calorimeter (Jaeger Oxycon Mobile; CareFusion
BD Germany 234 GmbH, Höchberg, Germany) [16].
Heart rate was measured with a chest strap (Polar T31
Coded Transmitter; Polar Kempele, Finland). Self-re-
ported rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was queried of
each participant during the last minute of each bout
using the Borg scale [17].
Cadence (steps/min) was directly observed (hand-tallied)
and counted as steps accumulated during each bout. A
video camera was also aimed at the participant’s feet to pro-
vide a redundant recording. Total steps tallied in each bout
were divided by the duration of the bout (tallied steps/
5-min) to calculate cadence in steps/min.
Treadmill testing procedures
Participants began by sitting in a chair positioned on the
treadmill for at least 5 min to establish baseline oxygen
consumption values. The chair was then removed and
participants were asked to walk for up to twelve 5-min
bouts at a 0% grade. The test increased in 0.5 mph incre-
ments from 0.5 mph (13.4 m/min) to a maximum of 6.0
mph (160.9 m/min), with a 2-min standing rest between
bouts (for a complete list of miles/h, km/h, and m/min
conversions, see Additional file 1). Treadmill testing was
terminated following completion of the bout when the
participant: 1) naturally selected to run instead of walk;
2) exceeded 75% of age predicted heart rate maximum
[0.75 x (220-age)]; 3) indicated an RPE > 13; or 4) chose
to stop the protocol. Additionally, research staff could
terminate the protocol if concerned for the partici-
pant’s safety.
Data processing and aggregation
Metabolic data were imported in 5-s epochs, and step
data were entered, into MATLAB (The MathWorks,
Natick, MA) for all analyses using custom scripts. Mean
VO2 values during minutes 2:45–3:45 and 3:45–4:45 of
each 5-min trial were averaged. Metabolic equivalents
(METs) were obtained by dividing the mass-specific VO2
(mL/kg/min) by 3.5 [18]. Moderate intensity ambulation
was defined as ≥3.0 and < 6.0 METs, while vigorous in-
tensity ambulation was defined as ≥6.0 METs [19].
Analytic sample
Data from four of the 80 enrolled participants were not
included for analysis due to equipment malfunction.
Specifically, their oxygen consumption data did not in-
crease during treadmill testing, remaining relatively
similar to resting levels. Thus, a total of 76 participants
were included in this analysis. The analytical data set
comprised 612 treadmill walking bouts. All walking
bouts were included in the analytical sample, irrespective
of whether the individual did or did not reach an
absolutely-defined moderate or vigorous intensity, since
these bouts remained important for the statistical mod-
elling procedures used. In addition, bout data for indi-
viduals who reached one or more of the termination
criteria (see Treadmill Testing Procedures above) were
included, provided they completed (walked) for the full
5-min bout. Running bouts (only achieved by 15 partici-
pants) were excluded from this analysis as the findings
reported herein expressly focused on walking cadences.
The final analytic dataset and corresponding data dic-
tionary can be viewed in Additional files 2 and 3, re-
spectively, formatted in accordance with the preceding
CADENCE-Kids study [14] for compatibility.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using R (version
3.0.2, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria). Statistical significance was set at α = 0.05. De-
scriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation for con-
tinuous variables, counts and percentages for categorical
variables) were calculated for participant characteristics.
Preliminary analyses
The initial intent was to fit a linear or curvilinear model
to the data representing the relationship between ca-
dence and VO2, with cadence and METs as the inde-
pendent and dependent variables, respectively. However,
upon visual inspection of the data, a nonlinear relation-
ship was observed between cadence and intensity that
could not be appropriately described using a curvilinear
fit. Moreover, the curvilinear model exhibited an eco-
logically invalid description of the data. That is, this
model displayed increasing intensities at decreasing ca-
dences below ~ 50 steps/minute and approached a verti-
cal asymptote at the higher cadences. Thus, a segmented
regression or ‘hockey stick’ model with both random
and fixed coefficients was implemented. This model
assigned two distinct (i.e., different slopes and inter-
cepts) linear portions to the data. The value for the

 segment break point was chosen based on an iterative
process to determine the point that minimized mean
square error. A random coefficients model was selected
to account for the repeated measurements of each par-
ticipant. To compare the fit of the segmented regression
to the curvilinear model, we performed a k = 5 cross-val-
idation analysis with 10 repetitions and ascertained the
root mean square error (RMSE).
Primary analyses
A fixed and random coefficients model was applied to
the data to quantify the cadence-intensity relationship.
Because participant repeated measures were accounted
for in the model, marginal R2 values were obtained and
reported as a description of model fit. Using the model’s
regression equation and ± 95% prediction intervals (PIs),
we solved for incremental cadence thresholds corre-
sponding to 3, 4, 5 and 6 METs. Sensitivity, specificity,
positive predictive value (PPV; i.e., the probability that
an individual walking at a given cadence threshold
would achieve the desired intensity level) and negative
predictive value (NPV) were then quantified for each
regression-identified threshold. In addition, Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was per-
formed and optimal cadence thresholds corresponding
to 3, 4, 5 and 6 METs were identified using Youden’s
index [20]. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and area
under the curve (AUC) of these cadence thresholds are
reported. Confidence intervals (99%) for optimal thresh-
olds, and area under the curve (AUC) were obtained
using the bootstrap with 20,000 replicates. Based on pre-
viously published standards [21], AUC values were inter-
preted as excellent (≥ 0.90), good (0.80–0.89), fair (0.70–
0.79), and poor (< 0.70).
Secondary analyses
Leg length and sex are two participant characteristics
that can affect cadence [5], and thus may affect the
cadence-intensity relationship. Therefore, both of these
variables were included as additional factors in separate
segmented regression models. A k = 5 cross-validation
analysis with 10 repetitions was performed to assess
whether models that include either of these additional fac-
tors improved overall prediction (measured via RMSE).
Heuristic cadence threshold determinations
Heuristic cadence thresholds were set as rounded multi-
ples of 5 steps/min from the more precise MET-associ-
ated estimates identified from the segmented regression
model and ROC curves. In the event that the two analyt-
ical approaches produced estimates that differed, we con-
sidered the trade-off in sensitivity, specificity, PPV and
NPV for each candidate threshold to ultimately select a
single heuristic threshold corresponding to 3, 4, 5, and 6
METs. While being mindful of the potential tradeoff in
sensitivity and specificity of the thresholds, we leaned to-
wards selecting values to produce a harmonious and in-
cremental set of cadence thresholds that would have
greater utility for researchers, clinicians and practitioners
to flexibly recommend, modulate, and/or analyze ambula-
tory intensity. The set heuristic thresholds were then sep-
arately evaluated using ROC curve analysis to determine
the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and AUC for identify-
ing increasing levels of intensity. In addition, the classifica-
tion accuracy of these heuristic thresholds (i.e., counts and
percentages of correctly classified bouts as true positives
and true negatives and falsely classified bouts as false posi-
tives and false negatives) were calculated.
Results
Sample characteristics
Descriptive characteristics of the 76 adults included in
this analytic sample are reported in Table 1. As per our
strategic recruitment plan, the sample was evenly dis-
tributed by sex and age. The sample was 30.4 ± 5.8 years
of age, with a BMI of 24.8 ± 3.4 kg/m2, and predomin-
ately Caucasian (63.2%). In addition, we have also in-
cluded a data summary table (Table 2) comprising the
sample sizes, cadences, VO2, and MET values for each
treadmill speed.
Segmented regression with random coefficients model
As indicated above, the data displayed two distinct linear
trends, with the second displaying a much steeper rela-
tionship than the first (model break-point = 104 steps/
min, marginal R2 = 0.84, Fig. 1). Adding leg length or sex
to separate models did not change the break point. The
segmented regression exhibited considerably less RMSE
(0.68 ± 0.10) compared to the curvilinear model (2.74 ±
0.48). Moreover, the addition of leg length or sex to the

 segmented regression model did not improve the RMSE
(0.68 ± 0.10 and 0.69 ± 0.10 when adding leg length and
sex, respectively). Optimal cadence thresholds for in-
creasing intensity levels (identified using the regression
equation) are reported in Table 3. Briefly, the optimal ca-
dence threshold for 3 METs was 102.2 steps/min and
129.1 steps/min for 6 METs.
Receiver operating characteristic analyses
Optimal cadence thresholds for increasing levels of in-
tensity (identified using ROC analyses) are presented in
Table 3. In summary, cadences of 96 steps/min and 120
steps/min corresponded to absolutely-defined moderate
and vigorous intensities, respectively. Sensitivity and spe-
cificity values for these moderate and vigorous cadence
thresholds were all > 85%, and AUC values were > 0.95,
indicating excellent overall accuracy.
Heuristic thresholds
Heuristic cadence thresholds consistent with all incre-
mental MET values anchored by 3 and 6 METs are pre-
sented in Table 3. To reiterate, these cadence thresholds
were selected based on a compromise between the re-
gression and ROC curve-based thresholds (rounded to

 the nearest 5 steps/min). Where the regression and ROC
approaches yielded different candidate heuristic thresh-
olds, we considered the trade-off in sensitivity, specifi-
city, PPV and NPV for both candidate thresholds to
ultimately select heuristic thresholds corresponding to 3,
4, 5, and 6 METs. As noted above, we deliberately leaned
towards selecting values to create a harmonious and
incremental
set
of
thresholds
consistent
with
the
intentional use of these heuristic thresholds to recom-
mend, modulate or quantify ambulatory behavior from a
public health perspective. Ultimately, a heuristic cadence
threshold of 100 steps/min emerged for 3 METs and 130
steps/min for 6 METs. Further, each 10 steps/min in-
crease was roughly associated with an increase in inten-
sity of 1 MET. Specifically, 4 METs was associated with
110 steps/min and 5 METs with 120 steps/min. Sensitiv-
ity and specificity for these heuristic thresholds closely
resembled the regression- and ROC curve-based optimal
thresholds.
Classification accuracy
determined
using
counts and percentages of correctly classified bouts (true
positives, true negatives) and falsely classified bouts
(false positives and false negatives) using moderate and
vigorous intensity cadence thresholds are reported in
Fig. 2. In total, 87.6% of bouts were correctly classified
using the 100 steps/min threshold (Fig. 2; true positives
plus true negatives), and 93.5% of bouts were correctly
classified using the 130 steps/min threshold. The PPV
for achieving a moderate intensity at 100 steps/min was
91.4%, and the PPV for achieving a vigorous intensity at
130 steps/min was 70.7%.
Discussion
The CADENCE-Adults study is the first calibration
study to employ a sex-and-age balanced sampling ap-
proach to establish heuristic cadence thresholds associ-
ated with increasing absolutely-defined intensity during
walking. Using two distinct analytical methods, we con-
firm that 100 steps/min is a reasonable heuristic threshold
associated with absolutely-defined moderate intensity (i.e.,
3 METs) ambulation in 21–40 year olds. We also provide

 further evidence for additional cadence thresholds associ-
ated with incremental MET-defined intensity up to and
including 130 steps/min as a heuristic threshold associated
with 6 METs. These additional heuristic values are
important indices useful for public health purposes to
guide 1) generalized cadence-based walking recommenda-
tions and 2) analysis and interpretation of minimally
processed ambulatory data obtained from contemporary
wearable technologies.
Heuristic values are evidence-based, practical, rounded
numbers that are grounded in evidence, but may not be
necessarily precise. They serve as useful and easy to re-
call mental short cuts, quickly conveying generalized or
broadly representative information to guide decisions. A
simple daily-use example of a heuristic value is the esti-
mated time it would take to drive between two cities.
Other common public health-related examples of heur-
istic values include “eat 5 fruits and vegetables per day”,
“be active 30 min/day”, and “limit time spent watching
TV to 2 h/day”. It bears emphasizing here that heur-
istic values, while evidence-based and thus appropri-
ate for public health purposes, are by definition not
individualized.
We first proposed the heuristic value of 100 steps/min
as a proxy indicator of moderate intensity in 2005, based
on a linear regression model of treadmill walking [9]. A
number of other studies [6–8, 10, 11] subsequently con-
firmed this heuristic value, despite acknowledging evi-
dence of a tolerable range of inter-individual variation.
Notably, these studies have been generally small, in-
cluded predominantly younger samples, did not always
employ a direct observation criterion standard of step
counting, and employed various analytical approaches.
This initial article focused on 21–40 year olds from the
CADENCE-Adults
study
represents
the
largest
sex-and-age structured sample to date employing a dir-
ect observation standard and using both regression and
ROC analysis to inform evidence-based but generalized
heuristic cadence values associated with absolutely-defined
moderate and vigorous intensity. The 100 steps/min thresh-
old for absolutely-defined moderate intensity continues to
be confirmed for this age group. The stability of this heuris-
tic across the adult lifespan up to 85 years of age will con-
tinue to be tested as part of the CADENCE-Adults study as
data collection is completed.
To date, there have been three studies that have re-
ported values congruent with a heuristic value of 130
steps/min associated with 6 METs (i.e., absolutely-defined
vigorous intensity) in ostensibly healthy adults [6, 9, 22].
Herein, the optimal absolutely-defined vigorous intensity
cadence thresholds were 129 and 120 steps/min, identified
using regression and ROC analyses, respectively. Both al-
gorithms are commonly accepted means of determining
associations between independent and dependent vari-
ables and establishing thresholds. However, both analyses
have different assumptions, and therefore different limita-
tions. Regression models may be overly influenced by out-
liers, while ROC curves are organized in a rank-order
fashion. By incorporating both methods, we provide more
robust support for the heuristic thresholds reported
herein. With that said, setting a lower threshold increases
sensitivity, but reduces the specificity and PPV; the oppos-
ite is true for higher thresholds. Considering these
trade-offs, we settled on a final heuristic threshold of 130
steps/min for absolutely-defined vigorous intensity.
The heuristic thresholds of 100 and 130 steps/min
demonstrated good-to-excellent classification of absolutely-
defined moderate and vigorous intensity ambulation, with

 an overall accuracy (true positive and true negative rates of
> 85%). Moreover, for individuals walking ≥100 steps/min
(~ 53.6–67.1 m/min or ~ 2.0–2.5 mph; Table 2), the prob-
ability (PPV) of achieving an absolutely-defined moderate
intensity was 91.4%. For 130 steps/min (107.3 m/min or ~
4.0 mph), the probability (PPV) of achieving an absolutely-
defined vigorous intensity was 70.7%. This value is less than
ideal and may be influenced by the lower number of partic-
ipants (n = 49) who achieved 6 METs. However, this num-
ber still reflects 65% of the participant pool, and the
associated NPV of 95.8% conversely suggested a very high
probability that individuals walking at < 130 steps/min were
at an intensity < 6 METs. Overall, this evidence supports
the use of 100 and 130 steps/min, corresponding to
absolutely-defined moderate and vigorous intensity ambu-
latory activity, respectively, as direct translations of public
health recommendations for the minimum desired ambula-
tory intensity required to achieve health and fitness im-
provements [12, 13].
In the current study, we employed an absolutely-de-
fined measure of intensity (i.e., METs), as opposed to a
relatively-defined
measure
of
intensity
(e.g.,
%VO2-
Reserve, % Heart Rate Maximum [HRmax] or Heart Rate
Reserve [HRR]). This approach is consistent with previ-
ous studies that have determined accelerometer activity
count cut points related to absolutely-defined moderate
and vigorous intensities [23–25], and also with U.S.
Federal physical activity guidelines [13, 26] and the
American College of Sports Medicine position stand
[27] that express their physical activity recommendations
(intended for public health applications) using METs
(e.g., 500–1000 MET-min/week). However, the use of
absolute intensity may not be ideal for all adults, espe-
cially individuals who are older or have low fitness levels,
whereby an indicator of absolute intensity represents a
higher percentage of maximal capacity (relative to a
younger or fitter adult) [27]. Few studies have examined
the cadence-intensity relationship using relatively-de-
fined measures of intensity, which may be more suitable
for clinical or other types of individualized applications.
For example, Serrano et al., [28] and Slaght et al. [29] re-
ported cadence thresholds of 115 ± 10 and 114 ± 11
steps/min, respectively, associated with 40% of VO2re-
serve. In addition, Pillay et al., [30] found that 122 ± 37
steps/min corresponded to 60% of HRmax, whereas
O’Brien et al., [11] reported that ~ 120–125 steps/min
corresponded to 40% METmax, dependent on the model-
ling technique and the covariates included in the model
(e.g., height, leg length). The differences observed be-
tween these cadence thresholds (employing different
relative indicators of intensity) and those reported herein
(absolutely-defined) reflect the inconsistencies between
the implemented intensity definitions. Unlike absolute
intensity measures, for which there is consensus in the
literature regarding what constitutes a moderate or vig-
orous intensity (3 and 6 METs respectively) [26, 27],
there appears to be less consensus regarding relatively-
defined intensity [31]. Using a single example of %HRmax,
moderate intensity has been defined as 64–76% HRmax
[27], 55–69% HRmax [32], and 60% HRmax [30]. While
there are strengths to using a relative intensity approach,
especially for clinical and other types of individualized ap-
plications, there are also weaknesses, such as the need for
a maximal fitness test to establish relative moderate and
vigorous intensity levels based on individualized maximal/
peak VO2 or HR values. Although it is possible to use
equations to estimate %HRmax or HRR [33–37], such esti-
mates are based on assumptions that may introduce an
additional source of error. Indeed, there is no universally
accepted HR-based equation with a minimal and accept-
able (< 3 bpm) level of error [38]. Furthermore, some
equations may be age (e.g., Åstrand [37]) or sex specific
(e.g., Gulati et al., [34]), so care must be taken when apply-
ing these equations to various populations. Collectively,
this makes such indicators of relative intensity less prac-
tical for public health applications including translations
of physical activity guidelines as they are currently
expressed [13, 26]. In summary, we believe our approach
to using absolutely-defined intensity is reasonable and de-
fensible given the consistency with previous studies and
with public health guidelines. Still, we anticipate future re-
search will be able to delve into the utility and limitations
of individualizing cadence-based exercise prescriptions for
clinical and more individualized applications (e.g., per-
sonal training).
An innovation of this study includes proffering a more
comprehensive
set
of
incremental
cadence-intensity
thresholds, including optimal and heuristic cadence
thresholds for the intermediary values of 4 and 5 METs.
Notably, with each increasing intensity level, the preci-
sion estimates (prediction intervals for regression; confi-
dence intervals for ROC curve) tended to narrow,
suggesting greater confidence that individuals walking at
higher cadence thresholds will indeed achieve the de-
sired higher intensity level. Based on the values pre-
sented herein, it is reasonable to conclude that, starting
from 100 steps/min, each 10 steps/min increase is
roughly associated with an increase in intensity of 1
MET, confirming the findings of a small preliminary
study conducted in 2005 [9]. Notably, based on the re-
gression and ROC optimal thresholds (both 112.5 steps/
min) corresponding to 4 METs, we may have selected ei-
ther 110 or 115 steps/min. However, considering our
definition of a heuristic threshold (not only evidence-
based, but also practically useful) and the complete set
of cadence-intensity thresholds being put forth herein,
we settled on 110 steps/min. In numerical terms, this
was associated with a decrease in the PPV (8.3%) and
Tudor-Locke et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity            (2019) 16:8 
Page 8 of 11
 increase in the NPV (4.6%) for this intensity level. Not-
ably, these cadence thresholds, including that associated
with 6 METs, are all achievable within the range of walk-
ing cadences for healthy adults; the walk to run transi-
tion occurs at ~ 140 steps/min [39]. Moreover, in the
current study we deliberately excluded the bouts where
15 participants transitioned to running, so the evidence
presented herein solely arises from walking cadence.
With walking being the most commonly reported and
widely accessible form of physical activity [40], this
intentional focus greatly improves the utility of this set
of cadence-intensity thresholds for application in the
general population.
Regarding precision of regression
predictions, we
chose to report prediction intervals (PIs). While confi-
dence intervals are more commonly reported, PIs are
more appropriate for repeated measures dataset regres-
sions, as they account for not only the uncertainty of the
actual population mean, but also the overall spread of
the data. For this reason, PIs appear wider in distribution
compared to confidence intervals. Cadence PIs for 3
METs were seemingly large (45.9–111.2 steps/min). It is
important to note that we intentionally included all
walking bouts (e.g., starting at 0.5 mph) in order to in-
corporate a maximal range of ambulatory speeds. How-
ever, extremely slow speeds (e.g., 0.5 and 1.0 mph) may
be considered non-ecological, as young healthy adults
do not typically walk at these slow speeds and we ob-
served our own participants struggling to find a comfort-
ably paced execution of these speeds. In a different
study, even when instructed to walk ‘rather slowly,’
healthy young adults (19–39 years old) chose to walk at
a pace of 2.1 ± 0.4 mph [41]. When excluding the two
slowest walking speeds employed herein, the mean ca-
dence associated with 3 METs slightly decreases (96.4
steps/min), but more importantly the PIs tighten consid-
erably (72–114 steps/min).
While the purpose of this analysis was to establish
heuristic cadence-intensity thresholds in 21–40 years
olds using group aggregate data, we acknowledge that
inter-individual variability exists and that any heuristic
threshold will have limited precision in terms of applic-
ability to any single individual. While we accounted for
the potential influence of both leg length and sex in the
overall model fit across all participants, these additional
variables did not change the model prediction (RMSE
0.68 ± 0.10 and 0.69 ± 0.10, respectively, compared to
0.68 ± 0.10
for
the
base
model).
Furthermore,
the
addition of leg length only marginally improved the
model fit (R2 = 0.85; compared to the basic model, R2 =
0.84). Notably, the regression model including leg length
predicted only a 0.58 MET difference at a given cadence
between participants with the longest versus shortest leg
length
(95.5 cm vs. 65.7 cm, respectively). Similarly,
when BMI was added to the regression model, the
model fit did not change (R2 = 0.84), and there was only
a 0.57 MET difference in predictions for participants
with the highest and lowest BMI (36.9 vs 19.4 kg/m2, re-
spectively). Given the limited change in model accuracy
when adding these additional factors, we considered it
reasonable to only include cadence in the final model.
We acknowledge that any remaining variance in inten-
sity at a given cadence may be better explained by other
factors. In addition, we did not measure VO2peak or
VO2max in this study, and as such are unable to make
any conclusions regarding fitness and its impact on our
study outcomes, or provide cadence thresholds corre-
sponding to relative intensity measures. It bears repeating
here, however, that the goal of establishing cadence-based
thresholds corresponding to absolutely-defined intensity
levels is to provide clear guidelines with little or no add-
itional individual information required. Finally, we also ac-
knowledge that cadence is specific to bipedal locomotor
movements and further that these thresholds are most ap-
plicable to walking behaviors that are characteristically
rhythmic, purposeful, continuous, and advancing forward
through space.
Despite these limitations, cadence thresholds associ-
ated with absolutely-defined moderate and vigorous am-
bulatory intensity can serve as important heuristic
values in efforts to measure and modulate adult walking
behaviors, thus extending the potential utility of contem-
porary wearable technologies that offer step counting
and cadence tracking features. One clear application of
these cadence thresholds is for implementation in walk-
ing interventions. In our recent systematic review [42],
we identified a limited number (n = 9) of intervention
studies that had used a cadence-based goals to modulate
walking behavior, or used cadence thresholds to quantify
physical activity intensity from accelerometers and wear-
able device data. Based on the small number of studies
and the observed associated high risk of bias, we con-
cluded that it was premature to synthesize their findings.
Rigorously designed walking intervention studies that
utilize these cadence thresholds to convey and evaluate
ambulatory behavior are required to elucidate the associ-
ated health benefits (e.g., improvements in aerobic
fitness, blood pressure and glucose levels, body compos-
ition). In addition, future research should also explore
ways to individualize cadence-based intensity prescrip-
tions (e.g., using indicators of relative intensity) similar
to Slaght et al., [29] and to modulate intensity in predict-
able ways (e.g., manipulating cadence using rhythmic
auditory cueing [music or metronome]).
Conclusions
In summary, 100 steps/min and 130 steps/min are ac-
ceptable heuristic cadence thresholds associated with

 absolutely-defined
moderate
and
vigorous
intensity
walking, respectively, in 21–40 year olds. Each 10 steps/
min increase is roughly associated with an increase in
intensity of 1 MET such that 4 METs is associated with
110 steps/min and 5 METs with 120 steps/min. Future
reports from the CADENCE-Adults study will either
confirm these values or establish age-appropriate heuris-
tic thresholds for walking across the adult lifespan of
21–85 years of age. Additional research is needed to
gauge
the
utility
and
limitations
of
individualized
cadence-based prescriptions potentially linked to indica-
tors of relative intensity.
