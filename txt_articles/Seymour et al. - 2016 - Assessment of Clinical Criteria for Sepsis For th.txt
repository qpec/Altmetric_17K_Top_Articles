 Abstract
IMPORTANCE—The Third International Consensus Definitions Task Force defined sepsis as 
“life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection.” The 
performance of clinical criteria for this sepsis definition is unknown.
OBJECTIVE—To evaluate the validity of clinical criteria to identify patients with suspected 
infection who are at risk of sepsis.
DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND POPULATION—Among 1.3 million electronic health record 
encounters from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2012, at 12 hospitals in southwestern 
Pennsylvania, we identified those with suspected infection in whom to compare criteria. 
Confirmatory analyses were performed in 4 data sets of 706 399 out-of-hospital and hospital 
encounters at 165 US and non-US hospitals ranging from January 1, 2008, until December 31, 
2013.
EXPOSURES—Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, systemic 
inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, Logistic Organ Dysfunction System (LODS) 
score, and a new model derived using multivariable logistic regression in a split sample, the quick 
Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score (range, 0–3 points, with 1 
point each for systolic hypotension [≤100 mm Hg], tachypnea [≥22/min], or altered mentation).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—For construct validity, pairwise agreement was 
assessed. For predictive validity, the discrimination for outcomes (primary: in-hospital mortality; 
secondary: in-hospital mortality or intensive care unit [ICU] length of stay ≥3 days) more common 
in sepsis than uncomplicated infection was determined. Results were expressed as the fold change 
in outcome over deciles of baseline risk of death and area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC).
RESULTS—In the primary cohort, 148 907 encounters had suspected infection (n = 74 453 
derivation; n = 74 454 validation), of whom 6347 (4%) died. Among ICU encounters in the 
validation cohort (n = 7932 with suspected infection, of whom 1289 [16%] died), the predictive 
validity for in-hospital mortality was lower for SIRS (AUROC = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.62–0.66) and 
qSOFA (AUROC = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.64–0.68) vs SOFA (AUROC = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.73–0.76; P < .
001 for both) or LODS (AUROC = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.73–0.76; P < .001 for both). Among non-ICU 
encounters in the validation cohort (n = 66 522 with suspected infection, of whom 1886 [3%] 
died), qSOFA had predictive validity (AUROC = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.80–0.82) that was greater than 
SOFA (AUROC = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.78–0.80; P < .001) and SIRS (AUROC = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.75–
0.77; P < .001). Relative to qSOFA scores lower than 2, encounters with qSOFA scores of 2 or 
higher had a 3- to 14-fold increase in hospital mortality across baseline risk deciles. Findings were 
similar in external data sets and for the secondary outcome.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Among ICU encounters with suspected infection, the 
predictive validity for in-hospital mortality of SOFA was not significantly different than the more 
complex LODS but was statistically greater than SIRS and qSOFA, supporting its use in clinical 
criteria for sepsis. Among encounters with suspected infection outside of the ICU, the predictive 
validity for in-hospital mortality of qSOFA was statistically greater than SOFA and SIRS, 
supporting its use as a prompt to consider possible sepsis.

 Although common and associated with high morbidity and mortality,1,2 sepsis and related 
terms remain difficult to define. Two international consensus conferences in 1991 and 2001 
used expert opinion to generate the current definitions.3,4 However, advances in the 
understanding of the pathobiology and appreciation that elements of the definitions may be 
outdated, inaccurate, or confusing prompted the European Society of Intensive Care 
Medicine and the Society of Critical Care Medicine to convene a Third International 
Consensus Task Force to reexamine the definitions. Like many syndromes, there is no “gold 
standard” diagnostic test for sepsis. Therefore, the task force chose several methods to 
evaluate the usefulness of candidate clinical criteria, including clarity, reliability 
(consistency and availability), content validity (biologic rationale and face validity), 
construct validity (agreement between similar measures), criterion validity (correlation with 
established measures and outcomes), burden, and timeliness. Unlike prior efforts, the task 
force used systematic literature reviews and empirical data analyses to complement expert 
deliberations.
Based on clarity and content validity and after literature review and expert deliberation, the 
task force recommended elimination of the terms sepsis syndrome, septicemia, and severe 
sepsis and instead defined sepsis as “life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a 
dysregulated host response to infection.”5 Of note, the task force did not attempt to redefine 
infection. Rather, it next sought to generate recommendations for clinical criteria that could 
be used to identify sepsis among patients with suspected or confirmed infection. The 
purpose of this study was to inform this step by analyzing data from several large hospital 
databases to explore the construct validity and criterion validity of existing and novel criteria 
associated with sepsis.
Methods
This study was approved with waiver of informed consent by the institutional review boards 
of the University of Pittsburgh, Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), Veterans 
Administration (VA) Ann Arbor Health System, Washington State Department of Health, 
King County Emergency Medical Services (KCEMS), University of Washington, and Jena 
University Hospital.
Study Design, Setting, and Population
A retrospective cohort study was performed among adult encounters (age ≥18 years) with 
suspected infection. The primary cohort was all hospital encounters from 2010 to 2012 at 12 
community and academic hospitals in the UPMC health care system in southwestern 
Pennsylvania. The cohort included all medical and surgical encounters in the emergency 
department, hospital ward, and intensive care unit (ICU). We created a random split sample 
(50/50) from the UPMC cohort, the derivation cohort for developing new criteria, and the 
validation cohort for assessment of new and existing criteria.
We also studied 4 external data sets: (1) all inpatient encounters at 20 KPNC hospitals from 
2009 to 2013; (2) all encounters in 130 hospitals in the United States’ VA system from 2008 
to 2010; (3) all nontrauma, nonarrest emergency medical services records from 5 advanced 
life support agencies from 2009–2010 transported to 14 hospitals with community infection

 in King County, Washington (KCEMS)6; and (4) all patients from 2011–2012 at 1 German 
hospital enrolled with hospital-acquired infection in the ALERTS prospective cohort study.7 
These cohorts were selected because they included patient encounters from different phases 
of acute care (out of hospital, emergency department, hospital ward) and countries (United 
States and Germany) with different types of infection (community and nosocomial). The 
UPMC, KPNC, and VA data were obtained from the electronic health records (EHRs) of the 
respective health systems; KCEMS data were obtained from the administrative out-of-
hospital record; and ALERTS data were collected prospectively by research coordinators.
Defining a Cohort With Suspected Infection
For EHR data (UPMC, KPNC, and VA), the first episode of suspected infection was 
identified as the combination of antibiotics (oral or parenteral) and body fluid cultures 
(blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, etc). We required the combination of culture and antibiotic 
start time to occur within a specific time epoch. If the antibiotic was given first, the culture 
sampling must have been obtained within 24 hours. If the culture sampling was first, the 
antibiotic must have been ordered within 72 hours. The “onset” of infection was defined as 
the time at which the first of these 2 events occurred (eAppendix in the Supplement). For 
non-EHR data in ALERTS, patients were included who met US Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention definitions or clinical criteria for hospital-acquired infection more than 48 
hours after admission as documented by prospective screening.7 For non-EHR data in 
KCEMS, administrative claims identified infection present on admission (Angus 
implementation of infection using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, 
Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes).6
Determining Clinical Criteria for Sepsis Using Existing Measures
In UPMC derivation and validation data, indicators were generated for each component of 
the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria4; the Sequential [Sepsis-
related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score8; and the Logistic Organ Dysfunction 
System (LODS) score,9 a weighted organ dysfunction score (Table 1). We used a modified 
version of the LODS score that did not contain urine output (because of poor accuracy in 
recording on hospital ward encounters), prothrombin, or urea levels. The maximum SIRS 
criteria, SOFA score, and modified LODS score were calculated for the time window from 
48 hours before to 24 hours after the onset of infection, as well as on each calendar day. This 
window was used for candidate criteria because organ dysfunction in sepsis may occur prior 
to, near the moment of, or after infection is recognized by clinicians or when a patient 
presents for care. Moreover, the clinical documentation, reporting of laboratory values in 
EHRs, and trajectory of organ dysfunction are heterogeneous across encounters and health 
systems. In a post hoc analysis requested by the task force, a change in SOFA score was 
calculated of 2 points or more from up to 48 hours before to up to 24 hours after the onset of 
infection.
Deriving Novel Clinical Criteria for Sepsis
In the derivation cohort (UPMC), new, simple criteria were developed according to the 
Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or 
Diagnosis (TRIPOD) recommendations.10 This entailed 2 steps: (1) assessing candidate

 variable quality and frequency of missing data and (2) developing a parsimonious model and 
simple point score.3,8,11 Because of the subjective nature and complexity of variables in 
existing criteria, we sought a simple model that could easily be used by a clinician at the 
bedside.
Based on the assumption that hospital mortality would be far more common in encounters 
with infected patients who have sepsis than in those who do not, all continuous variables 
were dichotomized by defining their optimal cutoffs using the minimum 0/1 distance on the 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for in-hospital mortality.12 
Cutoffs were rounded to the nearest integer, and standard single-value imputation was used, 
with normal value substitution if variables were missing. The latter approach is standard in 
clinical risk scores8,13,14 and mirrors how clinicians would use the score at the bedside. 
Multiple logistic regression was used with robust standard errors and forward selection of 
candidate variables using the Bayesian information criterion to develop the “quick SOFA” 
(qSOFA) model. The Bayesian information criterion is a likelihood-based stepwise approach 
that retains variables that improve the model’s overall ability to predict the outcome of 
interest while incorporating a penalty for including too many variables. Favoring simplicity 
over accuracy, a point score of 1 was assigned to each variable in the final model, 
irrespective of the regression coefficients. Model calibration was assessed by comparing 
clinically relevant differences in observed vs expected outcomes, as the Hosmer-Lemeshow 
test may be significant due to large sample sizes.15
Assessments of Candidate Clinical Criteria
The test:retest or interrater reliability of individual elements was not assessed, in part 
because most elements have known reliability. However, the frequency of missing data was 
determined for each element because more common missing data for individual elements 
will potentially affect the reliability of integrated scores such as the SOFA score. Construct 
validity was determined by examining the agreement between different measures analogous 
to the multitrait-multimethod matrix approach of Campbell and Fiske, using the Cronbach α 
to measure agreement or commonality.16,17 Confidence intervals were generated with the 
bootstrap method (100 replications).
Criterion validity was assessed using the predictive validity of the candidate criteria with 
outcomes (primary outcome: in-hospital mortality; secondary outcome: in-hospital mortality 
or intensive care unit [ICU] length of stay ≥3 days). These outcomes are objective, easily 
measured across multiple hospitals in US/non-US cohorts, and are more likely to be present 
in encounters with patients with sepsis than those with uncomplicated infection. To measure 
predictive validity, a baseline risk model was created for in-hospital mortality based on 
preinfection criteria using multivariable logistic regression. The base-line model included 
age (as a fractional polynomial), sex, race/ethnicity (black, white, or other), and the 
weighted Charlson comorbidity score (as fractional polynomial) as a measure of chronic 
comorbidities.18,19 Race/ethnicity was derived from UPMC registration system data using 
fixed categories consistent with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services EHR 
meaningful use data set.20 Race/ethnicity was included in the baseline model because of its 
described association with the incidence and outcomes of sepsis.21

 Encounters were then divided into deciles of baseline risk. Within each decile, the rate of in-
hospital mortality ± ICU length of stay of 3 days or longer was determined comparing 
encounters with infection with 2 or more SIRS, SOFA, LODS, and qSOFA points vs 
encounters with less than 2 criteria of the same score (threshold of 2 points was determined 
a priori). Model discrimination was assessed with the AUROC for each outcome using the 
continuous score(s) alone, then added to the baseline risk model. Analyses were separately 
performed in ICU encounters and non-ICU encounters at the onset of infection. New, simple 
criteria in external data sets were assessed in both ICU and non-ICU encounters.
Because serum lactate is widely used as a screening tool in sepsis,22 how its measurement 
would improve predictive validity of new criteria was assessed in post hoc analyses. 
Evaluation included qSOFA models that did and did not include serum lactate at thresholds 
of 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 mmol/L (18, 27, and 36 mg/dL) and as a continuous variable.23 Only 
KPNC data were used for these analyses because an ongoing quality improvement program 
promoting frequent serum lactate measurement across the health system minimized 
confounding by indication.24
Several sensitivity analyses were performed to assess robustness of the findings. These 
included a variety of restrictions to the cohort, more rigorous definitions of suspected or 
presumed infection, alternative ways to measure clinical variables (such as altered mentation 
in the EHR), and multiple imputation analyses for missing data. There are many possible 
time windows for criteria around the onset of infection. A variety of windows differing from 
the primary analysis were tested, including (1) 3 hours before to 3 hours after; (2) 12 hours 
before to 12 hours after; and (3) restricting to only the 24 hours after the onset of infection. 
Detailed descriptions are in the Supplement.
All analyses were performed with STATA software, version 11.0 (Stata Corp). All tests of 
significance used a 2-sided P ≤ .05. We considered AUROCs to be poor at 0.6 to 0.7, 
adequate at 0.7 to 0.8, good at 0.8 to 0.9, and excellent at 0.9 or higher.25
Results
Cohorts and Encounter Characteristics
At 177 hospitals in 5 US and non-US data sets between 2008 and 2013 (Table 2), 4 885 558 
encounters were studied. In the primary cohort of 1 309 025 records (UPMC derivation and 
validation; Figure 1), 148 907 encounters had suspected infection, most often presenting 
outside of the ICU (n = 133 139 [89%]). As shown in Table 3, first infection was commonly 
suspected within 48 hours of admission (86%), most often presenting in the emergency 
department (44%) compared with the ward (33%) or ICU (11%), and mortality was low 
(4%). The median time from the start of the encounter until the onset of suspected infection 
(defined as culture or antibiotics order) was 4.2 hours (interquartile range, 1.6–19.2 hours). 
In KPNC hospitals (eTable 1 in the Supplement), first suspected infections occurred outside 
the ICU (98%) with similar mortality (5%) and proportion identified within 48 hours of 
admission (81%). Serum lactate was measured in 57% of suspected infection encounters in 
KPNC hospitals compared with less than 10% in the other cohorts. In VA hospitals, 
encounters with suspected infection had similar mortality (6%) but were more likely to be

 first identified in the ICU (19%). A minority of first infection episodes occurred following 
surgery, and positive blood cultures were found in 5% to 19% of encounters. In the baseline 
risk model, using only demographics and comorbidities, there was a 10-fold variation for in-
hospital mortality across deciles of baseline risk, ranging from 0.7% to 8% (eFigure 1 in the 
Supplement).
Frequency of Missing Data Among Clinical and Laboratory Variables
In the UPMC derivation cohort, SIRS criteria and selected laboratory tests in SOFA and 
LODS were variably measured in the EHR near the onset of infection (eFigure 2 in the 
Supplement). Tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension, although present in less than 50% of 
encounters, were the most common clinical abnormalities. Encounters in the ICU were more 
likely to have SIRS and SOFA variables measured and values were more likely to be 
abnormal. For encounters outside of the ICU, laboratory data were less available, with total 
bilirubin, ratio of PaO2 to fraction of inspired oxygen, and platelet counts absent in 62%, 
74%, and 15% of encounters, respectively.
Performance of Existing Criteria in the ICU in the UPMC Cohort
Among ICU encounters with suspected infection in the UPMC validation cohort (n = 7932 
[11%]), most had 2 or more LODS points (88%), SOFA points (91%), or SIRS criteria 
(84%) near the time of suspected infection, with mortality rates of 18% for all scores at this 
threshold (Figure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement). SOFA and LODS had greater 
statistical agreement with each other (α = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.87–0.88) but lower with SIRS (α 
= 0.43 [95% CI, 0.41–0.46] for SOFA; α = 0.41 [95% CI, 0.38–0.43] for LODS) (Figure 3). 
Encounters in the ICU with 2 or more vs less than 2 SIRS criteria were compared within 
decile of baseline risk and observed a 1- to 2-fold increased rate of hospital mortality 
compared with a 3- to 11-fold increase in mortality comparing those with 2 or more vs less 
than 2 SOFA points (Figure 4). The fold change in the LODS score was even greater than 
that for SOFA.
In the ICU, the predictive validity for hospital mortality using SOFA (AUROC = 0.74; 95% 
CI, 0.73–0.76) and LODS (AUROC = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.73–0.76; P = .20) were not 
statistically different but were statistically greater than that of SIRS (AUROC = 0.64; 95% 
CI, 0.62–0.66; P < .001 for either LODS or SOFA vs SIRS) (Figure 3 and eFigure 4 and 
eTable 2 in the Supplement). Results for a change in SOFA of 2 points or more were 
significantly greater compared with SIRS (AUROC = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.68–0.71; P < .001 vs 
SIRS criteria). The SOFA score was 2 or more in 98% of decedents (95% CI, 97%–99%); 
among survivors, the SOFA score was less than 2 in 10% (95% CI, 10%–11%). These 
proportions were similar for a LODS threshold of 2 or 3 (eTable 3 in the Supplement). 
Among decedents, 2 or more SIRS criteria were present in 91% (95% CI, 89%–92%). 
Results were consistent for the combined outcome (eFigures 5 and 6 in the Supplement).
Performance of Existing Criteria Outside the ICU in the UPMC Cohort
For encounters with suspected infection outside of the ICU (n = 66 522 [89% of cohort]), 20 
130 (30%) had no SIRS criteria, 27 560 (41%) had no SOFA points, and 29 789 (45%) had 
no LODS points (Figure 2). Agreement followed a pattern similar to that in the ICU

 encounters but with generally smaller Cronbach α statistics (Figure 3). Over deciles of 
baseline risk (Figure 4), encounters with 2 or more vs less than 2 SIRS criteria had a 2- to 7-
fold increase in the rate of in-hospital mortality compared with up to an 80-fold change for 2 
or more vs less than 2 SOFA points.
The discrimination of hospital mortality using SOFA (AUROC = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.78–0.80), 
LODS (AUROC = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.81–0.83), or change in SOFA (AUROC = 0.79; 95% CI, 
0.78–0.79) scores was significantly greater compared with SIRS criteria (AUROC = 0.76; 
95% CI, 0.75–0.77; P < .01 for all) (Figure 3 and eFigure 4 and eTable 2 in the Supplement). 
Sixty-eight percent (95% CI, 66%–70%) of decedents had 2 or more SOFA points and 67% 
(95% CI, 66%–67%) of survivors had less than 2 SOFA points. In comparison, only 64% 
(95% CI, 62%–67%) of decedents had 2 or more SIRS criteria, whereas 65% of survivors 
had less than 2 SIRS criteria (95% CI, 64%–65%) (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Results 
were consistent for the combined outcome (eFigures 5 and 6 in the Supplement).
Performance of New, Simple Criteria
The final qSOFA model included Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13 or less, systolic 
blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or less, and respiratory rate of 22/min or more (1 point each; 
score range, 0–3) (Table 4). Most encounters with infection (73%–90%) had less than 2 
qSOFA points, and mortality ranged from 1% to 24% over the score range (eFigure 7 in the 
Supplement). Calibration plots showed similar observed vs expected proportion of deaths 
across qSOFA scores (eFigure 8 in the Supplement). The qSOFA agreed reasonably well 
with both SOFA (α = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.73–0.74) and LODS (α = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.78–0.79) 
and, unlike SOFA and LODS, also agreed more with SIRS (α = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.68–0.69) 
(Figure 3). The 24% of encounters with infection with 2 or 3 qSOFA points accounted for 
70% of deaths, 70% of deaths or ICU stays of 3 days or longer.
In the ICU, the predictive validity for hospital mortality of qSOFA above baseline risk 
(AUROC = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.64–0.68) was statistically greater than SIRS criteria (P = .01) 
but significantly less than SOFA (P < .001) (Figure 3 and eFigure 4 and eTable 2 in the 
Supplement). Outside of the ICU, there was a 3- to 14-fold increase in the rate of hospital 
mortality across the entire range of baseline risk comparing those with 2 or more vs less than 
2 qSOFA points (Figure 4). The predictive validity of qSOFA was good for in-hospital 
mortality (AUROC = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.80–0.82), was not statistically different from LODS (P 
= .77) and was statistically greater than SOFA or change in SOFA score (P < .001 for both) 
(Figure 3, Figure 4, and eFigure 4 and eTable 2 in the Supplement). Seventy percent (95% 
CI, 69%–72%) of decedents had 2 or more qSOFA points and 78% (95% CI, 78%–79%) of 
survivors had less than 2 qSOFA points (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Results were 
consistent for the combined outcome (eFigures 5 and 6 in the Supplement).
Among encounters with 2 or more qSOFA points, 75% also had 2 or more SOFA points 
(eFigure 9 in the Supplement). This proportion was greater among decedents (89%) and ICU 
encounters (94%) and increased as the time window for evaluation was extended to 48 hours 
(90%) and 72 hours (92%) after the onset of infection.

 External Data Sets
The qSOFA was tested in 4 external data sets comprising 706 399 patient encounters at 165 
hospitals in out-of-hospital (n = 6508), non-ICU (n = 619 137), and ICU (n = 80 595) 
settings (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Among encounters with community infection 
(KCEMS) or hospital-acquired infection (ALERTS), qSOFA had consistent predictive 
validity (AUROC = 0.71 and 0.75, respectively) (Table 5 and eFigure 4 in the Supplement). 
Results were similar in the VA data set (AUROC = 0.78), in which no GCS data were

During model building in UPMC data, serum lactate did not meet prespecified statistical 
thresholds for inclusion in qSOFA. In KPNC data, the post hoc addition of serum lactate 
levels of 2.0 mmol/L (18 mg/dL) or more to qSOFA (revised to a 4-point score with 1 added 
point for elevated serum lactate level) statistically changed the predictive validity of qSOFA 
(AUROC with lactate = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.79–0.81 vs AUROC without lactate = 0.79; 95% CI, 
0.78–0.80; P < .001) (eFigure 10A in the Supplement). As shown in eTable4 in the 
Supplement, this was consistent for higher thresholds of lactate (3.0 mmol/L [27 mg/dL], 4.0 
mmol/L [36 mg/dL]) or using a continuous distribution (P < .001). However, the clinical 
relevance was small as the rates of in-hospital mortality comparing encounters with 2 or 
more vs less than 2 points across deciles of risk were numerically similar whether or not 
serum lactate was included in qSOFA (eFigure 10B in the Supplement).
Among encounters with 1 qSOFA point but also a serum lactate level of 2.0 mmol/L or 
more, in-hospital mortality was higher than that for encounters with serum lactate levels of 
less than 2.0 mmol/L across the range of baseline risk. The rate of in-hospital mortality was 
numerically similar to that for encounters with 2 qSOFA points using the model without 
serum lactate (eFigure 11 in the Supplement). Because serum lactate levels are widely used 
for screening at many centers, the distribution of qSOFA scores over strata of serum lactate 
level was investigated. The qSOFA consistently identified higher-risk encounters even at 
varying serum lactate levels (eFigure 12 in the Supplement).
Time Windows for Measuring qSOFA Variables
When qSOFA variables were measured in the time window from 3 hours before/after or 12 
hours before/after the onset of infection in KPNC data (eTable 4 in the Supplement), results 
were not significantly different from the original model (P = .13 for 3 hours and P = .74 for 
12 hours). When qSOFA variables were restricted to only the 24-hour period after the onset 
of infection, the predictive validity for in-hospital mortality was significantly greater 
(AUROC = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.83–0.84; P < .001) compared with the primary model.
Additional sensitivity analyses are shown in eTable 4 in the Supplement. The predictive 
validity of qSOFA was not significantly different when using more simple measures, such as 
any altered mentation (GCS score <15 [P = .56] compared with the model with GCS score 
≤13). The predictive validity was also not significantly different when performed after 
multiple imputation for missing data and in a variety of a priori subgroups.

 Discussion
The Third International Consensus Definitions Task Force defined sepsis as a “life-
threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection.”5 In the 
absence of a gold-standard test for sepsis, several domains of validity and usefulness were 
used to assess potential clinical criteria to operationalize this definition. Among encounters 
with suspected infection in the ICU (Figure 3), SOFA and LODS had statistically greater 
predictive validity compared with SIRS criteria. Outside of the ICU, a simple model 
(qSOFA) of altered mentation, low systolic blood pressure, and elevated respiratory rate had 
statistically greater predictive validity than the SOFA score (Figure 3). The predictive 
validity of qSOFA was robust to evaluation under varied measurement conditions, in 
academic and community hospitals, in international locations of care, for community and 
hospital-acquired infections, and after multiple imputation for missing data. It was, however, 
statistically inferior compared with SOFA for encounters in the ICU and has a statistically 
lower content validity as a measure of multiorgan dysfunction. Thus, the task force 
recommended use of a SOFA score of 2 points or more in encounters with infection as 
criteria for sepsis and use of qSOFA in non-ICU settings to consider the possibility of sepsis.
Criteria Outside of the ICU
For infected patients outside of the ICU, there is an increasing focus on early recognition of 
sepsis. Potential criteria for organ dysfunction like SOFA or LODS required clinical and 
laboratory variables that may be missing and difficult to obtain in a timely manner. These 
characteristics may increase measurement burden for clinicians. In comparison, a simple 
model (qSOFA) uses 3 clinical variables, has no laboratory tests, and has a predictive 
validity outside of the ICU that is statistically greater than the SOFA score (P < .001). The 
qSOFA and SOFA scores also had acceptable agreement in the majority of encounters.
However, 3 potentially controversial issues are worth noting. First, qSOFA was derived and 
tested among patient encounters in which infection was already suspected. The qSOFA is 
not an alert that alone will differentiate patients with infection from those without infection. 
However, at least in many US and European hospital settings, infection is usually suspected 
promptly, as evidenced by rapid initiation of antibiotics.26,27
Second, mental status is assessed variably in different settings, which may affect the 
performance of the qSOFA. Although the qSOFA appeared robust in sensitivity analyses to 
alternative GCS cut points, further work is needed to clarify its clinical usefulness. In 
particular, the model evaluated only whether mental status was abnormal, not whether it had 
changed from baseline, which is extremely difficult to operationalize and validate, both in 
the EHR and as part of routine charting. An alternative to the GCS (eg, Laboratory and 
Acute Physiology Score, version 2, in KPNC encounters)28 found similar results.
Third, serum lactate levels, which have been proposed as a screening tool for sepsis or septic 
shock, were not retained in the qSOFA during model construction. One reason may be 
because serum lactate levels were not measured commonly in the UPMC data set. When 
serum lactate levels were added to qSOFA post hoc in the KPNC health system data set, in 
which measurement of lactate levels was common, the predictive validity was statistically

 increased but with little difference in how encounters were classified. This analysis assessed 
only how serum lactate levels at different thresholds contributed above and beyond the 
qSOFA model. However, among intermediate-risk encounters (qSOFA score = 1), the 
addition of a serum lactate level of 2.0 mmol/L (18 mg/dL) or higher identified those with a 
risk profile similar to those with 2 qSOFA points. Thus, areas for further inquiry include 
whether serum lactate levels could be used for patients with borderline qSOFA values or as a 
substitute for individual qSOFA variables (particularly mental status, given the inherent 
problems discussed above), especially in health systems in which lactate levels are reliably 
measured at low cost and in a timely manner.
Criteria in the ICU
Among ICU encounters, the diagnosis of sepsis may be challenging because of preexisting 
organ dysfunction, treatment prior to admission, and concurrent organ support. In this study, 
as others have reported in a distinct geographic region and health care system,29 traditional 
tools such as the SIRS criteria have poor predictive validity among patients who are infected. 
Yet in our study, SOFA and LODS scores had superior predictive validity in the ICU and 
greater agreement, perhaps because more variables were likely to be measured, abnormal, 
and independent of ongoing interventions. These results are consistent with prior studies of 
SOFA and LODS in the ICU.30,31 On average, only 2 of 100 infected decedents in the ICU 
had a SOFA or LODS score of less than 2. The qSOFA score had statistically worse 
predictive validity in the ICU, likely related to the confounding effects of ongoing organ 
support (eg, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors).
Advances Using EHRs
The data from these analyses provided the Third International Consensus Task Force with 
evidence about clinical criteria for sepsis using EHRs from 3 large health systems with both 
academic and community hospitals. More than 60% of US nonfederal, acute care hospitals 
(and all US federal hospitals) now use advanced EHRs. Adoption of EHRs has increased 8-
fold since 2009 in the United States and will continue to increase.32 The EHR may present 
hospitals with an opportunity to rapidly validate criteria for patients likely to have sepsis, to 
test prompts or alerts among infected patients with specific EHR signatures suggestive of 
sepsis, and to build platforms for automated surveillance.33 In addition, criteria such as in 
the qSOFA can be measured quickly and easily and assessed repeatedly over time in patients 
at risk of sepsis, perhaps even in developing countries without EHRs.
Limitations
This investigation has several limitations. First, we studied only patients in whom infection 
was already suspected or documented. We did not address how to diagnose infection among 
those in whom life-threatening organ dysfunction was the initial presentation. Therefore, 
these data alone do not mandate that hospitalized patients with SOFA or qSOFA points be 
evaluated for the presence of infection.
Second, we chose to develop simple criteria that clinicians could quickly use at the bedside, 
balancing timeliness and content validity with greater criterion validity. We acknowledge 
that predictive validity would be improved with more complex models that include

 interaction terms or serial measurements over time.3,34,35 We tested how the change in 
SOFA score over time would perform, and although similar to the maximum SOFA score, 
the optimal time windows over which change should be measured are not known.
Third, no organ dysfunction measurements evaluated in this study distinguish between 
chronic and acute organ dysfunction, assess whether the organ dysfunction has an 
explanation other than infection, or attribute dysfunction specifically to a dysregulated host 
response. For example, a patient with dementia with an abnormal GCS score at baseline will 
always have 1 qSOFA point but may not be as likely to have sepsis as a patient with a 
normal baseline sensorium. As such, we illustrated the predictive validity of various criteria 
across a full range of underlying risk determined from comorbidity and demographics.
Fourth, we chose 2 outcomes associated more commonly with sepsis than with 
uncomplicated infection. These out-comes have high content validity and were generalizable 
across data sets, but there are certainly alternative choices.36
Fifth, we compared predictive validity with tests of inference that may be sensitive to sample 
size. We found that statistically significant differences in AUROC were often present, yet 
these resulted in differences in classification with debatable clinical relevance. We 
reconciled these data by reporting the fold change in outcome comparing encounters of 
different scores to provide more clinical context.
Sixth, the acute, life-threatening organ dysfunction in sepsis may also occur at different 
times in different patients (before, during, or after infection is recognized).37 Results were 
unchanged over a variety of time windows, including both long (72-hour) and short (6-hour) 
windows around the onset of infection. Prospective validation in other cohorts, assessment in 
low- to middle-income countries, repeated measurement, and the contribution of individual 
qSOFA elements to predictive validity are important future directions.
Conclusions
Among ICU encounters with suspected infection, the predictive validity for in-hospital 
mortality of SOFA was not significantly different than the more complex LODS but was 
statistically greater than SIRS and qSOFA, supporting its use in clinical criteria for sepsis. 
Among encounters with suspected infection outside of the ICU, the predictive validity for in 
hospital mortality of qSOFA was statistically greater than SOFA and SIRS, supporting its 
use as a prompt to consider possible sepsis.

is 10-fold greater if she has 3 SOFA points compared with 1 SOFA point. On the other hand, 
she has only a small increase in the chance of dying if she has 3 SIRS criteria compared with 
1 SIRS criterion. For an older woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease admitted 
to the ward with pneumonia (panel B, decile 6), her chance of dying in the hospital is 7-fold 
higher if she has 3 qSOFA points compared with 1 qSOFA point. On the other hand, she has 
only a 3-fold increase in odds of dying if she has 3 SIRS criteria compared with 1 SIRS 
criterion.

aData derived from electronic health records.
bPresumed infection is a subset of suspected infection in which encounters received 2 or more doses of an antibiotic within 96 hours of onset of infection. Confirmed bacteremia is a subset among which 
blood cultures were positive during the encounter.
cSIRS criteria range from 0 to 4, wherein 1 point is given for perturbations of the following variables: respiratory rate, white blood cell count/bands, heart rate, and temperature (see Table 1).29 Maximum 
score is determined from 48 hours before to 24 hours after onset of infection.
dThe SOFA score ranges from 0 to 24, where 0 to 4 points are assigned for 1 of 6 organ dysfunctions: hematologic, hepatic, respiratory, neurologic, cardiac, and renal.8 A greater score corresponds to 
greater severity. Maximum score is determined from 48 hours before to 24 hours after onset of infection.
eThe LODS score, modified for available data, ranges from 0 to 22 points, wherein points are assigned with increasing severity to hematologic, hepatic, pulmonary, neurologic, cardiovascular, and renal 
dysfunction.9 Maximum score is determined from 48 hours before to 24 hours after onset of infection.
