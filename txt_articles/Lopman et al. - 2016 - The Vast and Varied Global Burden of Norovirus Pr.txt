Abstract
Globally, norovirus is associated with approximately one-fifth of all diarrhea cases, with
similar prevalence in both children and adults, and is estimated to cause over 200,000
deaths annually in developing countries. Norovirus is an important pathogen in a number
of high-priority domains: it is the most common cause of diarrheal episodes globally,
the principal cause of foodborne disease outbreaks in the United States, a key health
care–acquired infection, a common cause of travel-associated diarrhea, and a bane for
deployed military troops. Partly as a result of this ubiquity and burden across a range of
different populations, identifying target groups and strategies for intervention has been
challenging. And, on top of the breadth of this public health problem, there remain impor-
tant gaps in scientific knowledge regarding norovirus, especially with respect to disease in
low-income settings.
Many pathogens can cause acute gastroenteritis. Historically, rotavirus was the most
common cause of severe disease in young children globally. Now, vaccines are available
for rotavirus and are universally recommended by the World Health Organization. In
countries with effective rotavirus vaccination programs, disease due to that pathogen
has decreased markedly, but norovirus persists and is now the most common cause of
pediatric gastroenteritis requiring medical attention. However, the data supporting the
precise role of norovirus in low- and middle-income settings are sparse. With vaccines
in the pipeline, addressing these and other important knowledge gaps is increasingly
pressing.
We assembled an expert group to assess the evidence for the global burden of norovirus
and to consider the prospects for norovirus vaccine development. The group assessed the
evidence in the areas of burden of disease, epidemiology, diagnostics, disease attribution,
acquired immunity, and innate susceptibility, and the group considered how to bring norovi-
rus vaccines from their current state of development to a viable product that will benefit
global health.

 Introduction
Significant progress has been made towards the control of diarrheal diseases. Global diarrheal
deaths for all ages have declined dramatically, from an estimated 2.6 million annually in 1990
to approximately 1.3 million in 2013 [1]. Over the same period, improvements specifically for
children under 5 years of age have been most impressive, with rates of decline in diarrheal
deaths at around 5% per year, in absolute numbers, to an estimate of 578,000 deaths in 2013
[2]. Diarrheal disease is now the fourth most common cause of mortality overall, but morbidity
has not changed at the same pace, with diarrheal disease remaining the second most common
cause of morbidity worldwide in children under the age of 5 years [3]. Many bacterial and para-
sitic pathogens are controllable through improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene, facili-
tated by economic development, as is evidenced by the rapid declines in mortality; rotavirus
disease has been significantly impacted through vaccination in virtually every setting where it
has been introduced, and can be further impacted with additional introduction of rotavirus
vaccines in countries [4].
Norovirus is ubiquitous, associated with 18% (95% CI: 17%–20%) of diarrheal disease
worldwide, with significant burden of disease in high-, middle-, and low-income settings. It is
estimated to cause 212,000 deaths annually worldwide; approximately 99% of these are esti-
mated to occur in middle- and high-mortality countries [5]. According to these estimates, nor-
ovirus is the most common cause of diarrheal cases across for all ages, the second most
common cause of diarrheal death in children under the age of 5 years, and the most common
cause of diarrheal death over 5 years of age, with similar patterns across WHO regions. So
while the overall mortality risks are likely to be much lower in high-income settings, high inci-
dence of disease appears universal. For example, the Malnutrition and Enteric Disease Study
Summary Points
• Diagnostic improvements have fundamentally changed our understanding of norovirus.
The current evidence suggests that disease burden of norovirus is high, second only to
rotavirus as a cause of severe acute gastroenteritis in children in developed countries, and
that it is a key cause of diarrhea-associated morbidity and mortality worldwide.
• Young children experience the highest incidence of disease; severe outcomes are most
common among young children and the elderly.
• Immunity is of limited duration and is strain- or genotype-specific, with little or no
protection conferred across genogroups.
• Innate susceptibility to noroviruses is determined by the host’s genetics of glycan
expression; individuals with a functional FUT2 gene (known as secretors) have greater
susceptibility to certain common viruses.
• Recent progress has been made in the development of in vitro cell culture for norovirus
as well as in the identification of candidate immune correlates of protection.
• Norovirus vaccines are steadily moving through the development pipeline. All of these
products are based on the production of virus like particles (VLPs) or P particle sub-
unit in expression systems. Initial human challenge studies have demonstrated safety,
immunogenicity, and efficacy.
• One of the challenges for developing targeted interventions, including a norovirus vac-
cine, is that many distinct population groups, based on demographics (e.g., children,
elderly) or risk (e.g., food handlers, military, travelers, health care workers), are affected.

 (MAL-ED), conducted in eight low- and middle-income countries, found norovirus to be the
first and second most common cause of diarrheal disease in the first and second year of life,
respectively [6]. And in high- and middle-income countries with successful rotavirus vaccina-
tion programs, norovirus is the most common cause of pediatric gastroenteritis [7,8].
The increase in norovirus-related research over the last 15 years has been tremendous, con-
current with improvements in and more widespread availability of diagnostic methods. Included
in this body of work are fundamental advances in our understanding, ranging from better bur-
den-of-disease estimates [5,9,10], to the first demonstration of in vitro cell culture [11], to eluci-
dation of key interactions that noroviruses have with other agents in the microbiome [11–13], to
the demonstration that vaccination against human norovirus infection and disease is possible
[14,15]. While many challenges remain before norovirus can be considered “controllable,” the
confluence of recent advances gives us optimism. To this end, in February 2015, Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), led by a
scientific organizing committee from the areas of government, academia, and philanthropy, con-
vened a symposium in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, with representatives from all these sectors
in addition to vaccine developers. Our charge was to review the most up-to-date knowledge on
norovirus with the aim of identifying key gaps and detailing the most critical studies to address
them, all with the ultimate goal of guiding the development of a norovirus vaccine for the popula-
tions that stand to benefit most: children in the developing world. The full report from the con-
vening can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/downloads/global-burden-report.pdf.
Many of the papers in this PLOS Collection were either presented at or inspired by the meeting.
Critical Knowledge Gaps
1. Basic epidemiological and disease burden data are lacking, especially from developing coun-
tries. There remains uncertainty and some scientific controversy in defining the norovirus
disease burden.
2. With sensitive real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays, norovirus is frequently
detected in stool of healthy individuals, complicating the interpretation of diagnostic results
and disease attribution.
3. Understanding of natural immunity to norovirus remains incomplete.
4. The implications of genetic susceptibility for population health, viral evolution, and vaccines
remains unclear.
5. Genotype-specific immune responses and antigenic variation of norovirus suggest that a
polyvalent vaccine will be needed and may require updating when new pandemic strains
emerge.
6. There is limited understanding of the relative roles that different age groups play in virus
transmission. Better data coupled with appropriate models could help to devise vaccination
strategies that lead to the greatest benefits at the population level.
Insights from this Collection
Global Economic Burden
In a recent PLOS Collection, the World Health Organization’s Global Estimates of the Burden
of Foodborne Disease in 2010 were published. These estimates position norovirus as the most
common cause of cases of and deaths from foodborne diarrhea disease and the fourth greatest

 burden in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Norovirus was estimated to cause
684 million (95% Uncertainty Interval 491–1,112 million) episodes of diarrheal disease and
212,000 deaths, annually, for all ages and from all modes of transmission [5,10].
In our current Collection, Bartsch et al. extend those findings to consider global economic
impacts of norovirus [16]. They estimate that globally, norovirus results in an economic bur-
den of US$4.2 billion (95% UI: US$3.2–US$5.7 billion) in direct health system costs and US
$60.3 billion (95% UI: US$44.4–US$83.4 billion) in societal costs annually. Two-thirds of that
burden is a result of disease in children under the age of five years. Low-, middle-, and high-
income countries all have a considerable economic burden, indicating that norovirus gastroen-
teritis is a truly global economic problem.
Local Burden Data
While there is clearly a lack of local, national, and regional studies from developing countries
on the epidemiology and molecular diversity of norovirus, those gaps are beginning to be filled.
In their systematic review, Mans et al. included data on 19 studies from 14 African countries.
Overall, in these studies, norovirus was associated with 13.5% of diarrheal disease in children,
and GII.4 strains predominated in the majority of studies. The authors identified lack of data
in older children and adults as a critical gap in Africa [17]; the same gap exists for low- and
middle-income settings globally [9].
A number of papers in this collection also offer new epidemiological data from specific pop-
ulations from Asia, Africa, and North and South America. Shioda et al. present some of the
first age-specific community and outpatient incidence rates of diarrheal disease associated with
norovirus (as well as sapovirus and astrovirus) in Kenya [18]. Their community-based inci-
dence estimate is about twice that of estimates from the US, United Kingdom, and the Nether-
lands, suggesting higher overall incidence in this developing country.
Grytdal et al. provide some of the first estimates of age-specific incidence rates for norovi-
rus-associated acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in outpatient and community settings for the US
[19]. In a population served by a managed care organization, norovirus gastroenteritis inci-
dence in the community was estimated at 6% per year, with substantially higher rates among
children under 5 years of age, particularly in outpatient settings (i.e., medically attended dis-
ease). Also for the US, Rha et al. estimated medically attended norovirus AGE rates for active-
duty military personnel and their beneficiaries [20]. Like Grytdal et al., they reported that out-
patient rates were approximately five times higher among children under 5 years of age com-
pared to the rest of the population. Overall, rates of medically attended norovirus in this
military population were considerably higher than estimates for the civilian population from
Grytdal et al. [19] or previously published estimates [21–24], perhaps owing to more frequent
exposure for military personnel.
Molecular Epidemiology
A signature biological feature of norovirus is its genetic diversity and rapid, immune selection-
driven evolution. A number of papers in this collection highlight this diversity and give insight
into its mechanistic underpinnings and implications for health and disease. Most of our under-
standing of the molecular epidemiology of norovirus comes from outbreak samples. However,
Allen et al. examined samples from sporadic cases in diverse settings: the UK and Malawi [25].
Certain GII.4 strains that caused global increases in outbreak activity could be found in spo-
radic samples in both of these settings many years before becoming globally predominant.
Based on this, the authors suggest the importance of surveillance of sporadic disease. Such
data, especially from high incidence settings in the developing world, may be crucial for

 understanding and anticipating strain emergence and for predicting the potential strains for
vaccines.
Fumian et al. and Lee Kim et al. present data on the molecular epidemiology of norovirus
outbreaks from Brazil and Australia/New Zealand, respectively [26,27]. Despite their obvious
geographical differences, the observations are remarkably consistent. GII.4 viruses were identi-
fied in 72% and 63% of outbreaks in Brazil and Australia/New Zealand, respectively. Of the
non-GII.4 outbreaks, the majority in both settings were inter-genotype recombinant viruses,
highlighting this important evolutionary mechanism, especially for less common strains.
Natural History, Host–Pathogen Interactions
Vomiting is a cardinal symptom of norovirus and key to its transmission, but it has also been a
challenge to study directly. Using data from a collection of intentional-exposure volunteer
studies, Kirby et al. show that over two-thirds of participants experience vomiting and that
virus can be detected in most emesis samples from these participants [28]. Cases with vomiting
but without diarrhea are typically excluded from studies of acute gastroenteritis; Kirby et al.’s
study reminds us that in doing so, we exclude an important syndrome caused by norovirus
infection and therefore underestimate its disease burden.
It is from these and other volunteer studies that much of our knowledge of norovirus immu-
nity is derived. More recently, clinical trials using virus-like particles (VLPs) as candidate vac-
cines have further advanced our knowledge. Ramani et al. highlight two recently identified
potential correlates of protection against norovirus gastroenteritis: norovirus-specific salivary
IgA and norovirus-specific memory IgG cells [29]. Currently, however, serum antibody that
blocks the binding of norovirus VLPs to histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) is the best-stud-
ied and leading candidate correlate of protection.
In their Pearls article, Nordgren et al. discuss the implications of heterogeneity in innate sus-
ceptibility to norovirus in terms of burden of disease, viral genetic diversity as a function of
human host diversity, and what the implications of this might be for norovirus vaccines and
clinical trial design [30].
Quantifying Disease Burden and the Need for a Vaccine
The current evidence suggests that norovirus disease burden is great, but there remains consid-
erable uncertainty and some scientific controversy in defining the precise role of norovirus in
severe pediatric gastroenteritis. Epidemiological and etiological data are lacking, especially
from developing countries. Routine testing is rarely performed in ongoing surveillance plat-
forms, in part because molecular diagnostics are the standard reference for norovirus detection,
and have only recently been widely available. Real-time quantitative reverse-transcription PCR
(RT-qPCR) is the most sensitive and specific diagnostic for noroviruses, but use of these assays
is mainly restricted to public health and research laboratories in middle- and high-income
settings.
A robust estimate of the disease burden is critical to establishing a public health case to
guide interventions and norovirus vaccine development. A vexing problem is how to identify
when norovirus is disease-causing and then to attribute a fraction of the acute gastroenteritis
disease “envelope” to norovirus. For norovirus, attribution has been particularly challenging
since detection is based on highly sensitive RT-qPCR and virus is frequently detected in stool
of individuals with gastroenteritis, but also in stool of healthy controls. Reinfection is common
and sometimes asymptomatic; viral shedding can persist for weeks or months after symptoms
and, fundamentally, we lack a diagnostic that readily discriminates between disease-causing
and asymptomatic infection.

 The recent Global Enterics Multi-Center Study (GEMS) is the largest systematic assessment
for understanding the etiology of childhood diarrhea in developing countries [31]. GEMS and
other case-control studies use the odds ratio of a microbe being present in cases versus healthy
controls to calculate an attributable or etiologic fraction. When detected as frequently in
healthy controls as in cases, some study authors have concluded that norovirus is a minor path-
ogen. We think that the conclusion is inaccurate for a virus that commonly causes reinfection
and has long excretion patterns. An alternative explanation is that high levels of asymptomatic
infection are a result of frequent exposure, some of which will result in asymptomatic infection
because of acquired immunity [32]. Therefore, high prevalence of norovirus detection in
healthy controls may be characteristic of “hyper-endemicity” where burden is higher, not
lower. Quantitative and multiplex diagnostics may be important tools for ascribing etiological
fractions for norovirus and other enteric pathogens, especially when coupled with rigorous
field studies, such as the multi-center MAL-ED study [33]. Indeed, in that study, norovirus was
identified as the pathogen with the first- and second-highest attributable fraction for diarrhea
in the first and second year of life, respectively, but still only about 5% of disease could be
attributed to norovirus [6].
Developing a Vaccine and Addressing Biological Challenges
Noroviruses are a genetically and antigenically diverse group of ssRNA viruses, which presents
serious challenges both for creating broadly reactive diagnostics and eliciting a broadly protective
immune response, following either natural infection or vaccination. The norovirus strains that
infect humans are found among 29 genotypes among genogroup (G) I (n = 9), GII (n = 19), and
GIV (n = 1) [34]. Among this array of different noroviruses are the GII.4 strains, which rapidly
evolve in a boom-and-bust cycle, with novel viruses emerging every 2–4 years and replacing pre-
vious dominant ones, a process driven by evasion of immunity in the human population [35]. In
addition to their evolutionary dynamics, there are public health reasons that a successful norovi-
rus vaccine must provide protection against GII.4 viruses: they are the predominant cause of
pediatric infections worldwide [36], they predominate overwhelmingly as a cause of disease
amongst the elderly in health care–associated outbreaks, and they result in more severe illness
and death [37]. Studies published in this Collection are consistent with the view that GII.4 viruses
predominate globally [17,25,26], with rare exception in the last 20 years [38].
Understanding of natural immunity to norovirus is far from complete, but the current view
is that immunity is strain- or genotype-specific, with little or no protection conferred across
genogroups. Immunity is not lifelong, with estimates of duration ranging from 6 months to 9
years [32,39–42]. Accordingly, genotype-specific immune responses and antigenic variation
suggest that a polyvalent vaccine will be needed and may require updating when new strains
emerge. To date, vaccine trials and challenge studies have been conducted among adults, leav-
ing much to learn about how “unprimed” children who have not experienced (as many) noro-
virus exposures develop immunity and therefore respond to vaccination.
The lack of a robust in vitro cell culture system for human norovirus has hampered the
development of assays to measure protective neutralizing antibodies conferred by either natu-
ral or vaccine-induced immunity. However, important progress has been achieved very
recently in this area [11] as has identification of candidate immune correlates of protection
(e.g., [43]). These are important breakthroughs that may accelerate vaccine development.
Overcoming Logistical and Programmatic Challenges
Many distinct population groups are affected by norovirus, which could complicate the formula-
tion of a research agenda and clinical development plan for specific products (Tables 1 and 2).

 But, if harnessed, this diversity in disease burden could also serve to stimulate development and
generate demand from difference sources. A development plan for a target population of young
children will look quite different than for older adults, or for a specific risk group, such as

 travelers, military personnel, or health care workers. From a public health perspective, it is clear
that young children experience the highest overall incidence of disease [21], and severe disease
outcomes are most common among young children and, at least in developed countries, the
elderly [24]. Young children also seem to be the most important group in driving transmission in
the community [44]. Accordingly, vaccinating young children would likely be most efficient for
directly preventing disease burden, and would offer the greatest potential for impact at the popu-
lation level through indirect benefits resulting from reduced transmission. Defining the relative
roles of different age groups in transmission is challenging and may well differ in high- and low-
income settings, but a combination of empirical (e.g., household) studies and mathematical
modeling analysis may help to optimize the direct and population-level effect of vaccinating
through targeting different groups.
In the absence of an outside stimulus, such as major global public health donors, developed
world markets are likely to provide the initial economic impetus for private industry to develop
norovirus vaccines. To date, early-phase trials have been conducted among adults in high-
income settings, and there have been no clinical studies in children, so we see a need for a

 targeted pediatric development plan. Such a plan should include studies to generate data on the
compatibility of a norovirus vaccine with current routine childhood immunizations, and in
particular the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI). Adding a vaccine to the EPI sched-
ule involves great effort to demonstrate the added value of the vaccine, on both economic and
health grounds. The economics of a norovirus vaccine requiring multiple doses and/or periodic
reformulation will be scrutinized carefully by policy makers. At the earliest stage, clinical devel-
opment plans should define a target product profile (TPP) that will maximize public health
gains by focusing on young children, with the aim of developing a vaccine that can be incorpo-
rated into the logistical arrangements of current immunization programs.
Future Directions
Norovirus as a target for vaccination is unique in many ways. First, the public health need is not
restricted to a specific region, income level, or even age range, so the groups with a stake in vac-
cine development are many and diverse. Second, much of the totality of economic and health bur-
den results from relatively mild disease. But even if the proportion of cases with severe outcomes
is relatively low, the sheer incidence of norovirus still results in a considerable severe disease bur-
den. Third, given the current state of knowledge, we expect that progress in understanding of dis-
ease burden and epidemiology, human–virus interactions, and vaccine development will be
interdependent. More robust estimates of the disease burden of children in low-income settings
should stimulate more research in vaccines that will benefit those populations; vaccine trials
themselves can be used to better characterize the disease burden and also to identify correlates of
protection, which have the potential to make subsequent vaccine evaluations faster and less costly;
mathematical modeling studies can serve as a framework to integrate this variety of data and to
predict the impact of vaccination strategies, and to objectively identify the most critical gaps in
our knowledge (Table 3). Addressing these key issues will be vital to accelerate and achieve the
development and implementation of interventions such as vaccines to control and prevent the
tremendous global morbidity and mortality from norovirus.
