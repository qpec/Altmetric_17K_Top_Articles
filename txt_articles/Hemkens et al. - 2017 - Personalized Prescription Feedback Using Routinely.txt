IMPORTANCE Feedback interventions using routinely collected health data might reduce
antibiotic use nationwide without requiring the substantial resources and structural efforts of
other antibiotic stewardship programs.
OBJECTIVE To determine if quarterly antibiotic prescription feedback over 2 years reduces
antibiotic use when implemented in a complex health care system.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Pragmatic randomized trial using routinely collected
claims data on 2900 primary care physicians with the highest antibiotic prescription rates in
Switzerland.
INTERVENTIONS Physicians were randomized to quarterly updated personalized antibiotic
prescription feedback over 2 years (n = 1450) or usual care (n = 1450). Feedback was
provided both by mail and online from October 2013 to October 2015 and was supported by
an initial 1-time provision of evidence-based guidelines.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the prescribed defined daily
doses (DDD) of any antibiotic to any patient per 100 consultations in the first year analyzed
by intention-to-treat. We further analyzed prescriptions of specific antibiotics, age groups,
and sex for the first and second year to investigate persistency of effects over time.
RESULTS The 2900 physicians had 10 660 124 consultations over 2 years of follow-up,
prescribed 1 175 780 packages of antibiotics with 10 290 182 DDD. Physicians receiving
feedback prescribed the same amount of antibiotics to all patients in the first year
(between-group difference, 0.81%; 95% CI, −2.56% to 4.30%; P = .64) and second year
(between-group difference, −1.73%; 95% CI, −5.07% to 1.72%; P = .32) compared with the
control group. Prescribing to children aged 6 to 18 years was −8.61% lower in the feedback
than in the control group in the first year (95% CI, −14.87% to −1.90%; P = .01). This
difference diminished in the second year (between-group difference, −4.10%; 95% CI,
−10.78% to 3.07%; P = .25). Physicians receiving feedback prescribed fewer antibiotics to
adults aged 19 to 65 years in the second year (between-group difference, −4.59%; 95% CI,
−7.91% to −1.16%; P < .01). Prescribing to other patient groups or of specific antibiotic types
was not significantly different between groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This nationwide antibiotic stewardship program with routine
feedback on antibiotic prescribing was not associated with a change of antibiotic use. In older
children, adolescents, and younger adults less antibiotics were prescribed, but not
consistently over the entire intervention period.

A
ntibiotic resistance is closely correlated with antibi-
otic use in primary care and is a major threat to public
health.1 Various antibiotic stewardship approaches in-
volving communication training, specific education interven-
tions, point-of-care testing, electronic decision support sys-
tems,anddelayedprescribinghavethestrongestevidencebase
forbeneficialeffectsonantibioticprescribing.2,3However,their
system-wide implementation would often require time, ma-
jor resources, and substantial structural efforts. Prescription
feedback interventions are less resource intensive, timely
implementable and beneficial effects have been found across
various medical fields.4 For antibiotic prescribing, however,
current evidence is inconsistent and scarce,2,3 in particular for
a large-scale system-wide implementation with no direct pa-
tient or physician contact.5-13 Existing large-scale trials evalu-
ating prescription feedback did not continuously or specifi-
cally target high prescribers, were of short duration, and were
implemented in settings not sharing the complexity of the
Swiss or US health care system.5,6
We investigated in a nationwide trial the feasibility and ef-
fectiveness of a large-scale, quarterly prescription feedback in-
tervention on antibiotic use in primary care over 2 years using
routinely collected claims data in Switzerland.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
Wedidapragmaticnationwiderandomizedparallelgrouptrial.
We identified the primary care physicians with the highest an-
tibiotic prescription rates in Switzerland using routinely col-
lected claims data of prescriptions of antibiotics and outpa-
tient consultations collected by SASIS, a data warehouse
company of an umbrella organization of Swiss statutory health
insurers (Santésuisse). These data are collected by over 60
statutory health insurers covering 64% of the Swiss popula-
tion (5.1 million residents).14 We included among all board cer-
tified primary care physicians the 2900 top antibiotic pre-
scribers (based on prescribed defined daily doses [DDD] per
100consultationsintheyearpriortorandomization;2900was
the calculated necessary sample size; 2484 [86%] prescribed
above the median). Physicians were identified via the Swiss
central physician registry that allows health insurers to iden-
tify all physicians and claims for any of their services or pre-
scriptions. Registration numbers belonging to any ambula-
toryfacilitiesofhospitalswereexcluded.Physicianswithfewer
than 100 patients per year were excluded. We used no other
selection criteria. No informed consent was obtained but all
physicians in the intervention group could decline to be con-
tacted at any time. This trial was approved by all ethic com-
mittees responsible for all 26 cantons of Switzerland. Details
on the rationale and design are described elsewhere.14
Eligible physicians were 1:1 randomized to the interven-
tion or control group by an independent researcher, using a
computeralgorithm.Physiciansintheinterventiongroupwere
not aware of being part of a controlled trial; physicians in the
control group were not informed. Investigators were blinded
owing to the anonymized nature of the trial. The outcome as-
sessmentwas,formally,blindedbecauseallstudy-relevantdata
were collected by health insurance personnel not involved in
the study.
Intervention
Physicians in the intervention group received a quarterly up-
dated personalized prescription feedback. Physicians in the
control group received no material.
In quarterly intervals, beginning in October 2013, we sent
physicians in the intervention group a letter enclosing a quar-
terly updated single-page graphical overview showing the in-
dividual amount of antibiotic prescriptions per 100 consulta-
tions in the preceding months and displaying the adjusted
averageinpeerphysicians,thatistheentirepopulationofSwiss
primary care physicians (eFigure in the Supplement). This let-
ter also included an individual access code to the study web-
site, where we offered more detailed online prescription feed-
back (for example with details on the prescriptions per age
group or sex or for certain antibiotic types) and answers to fre-
quently asked questions on antibiotic use. Overall, 8 postal
feedbacks were provided, the last in July 2015.
With the first mailing, we sent further information pro-
viding basic details on the study and its rationale, clarifying
privacy and data protection issues, and justifying the use of
anonymized insurance data for research purposes. The inter-
vention was described as quality improvement program and
no details about the conduct and design of the trial were pro-
vided. This mailing also included a response postcard for opt-
ing-out of the intervention and evidence-based guidelines for
optimized antibiotic use in primary care, adapted for Switzer-
land. The guidelines focused on the 7 most frequent reasons
for antibiotic prescribing in primary care (acute unspecific up-
per respiratory tract infection, sore throat/acute tonsillitis/
pharyngitis, acute rhinosinusitis, acute otitis media, acute
bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, and uncompli-
cated urinary tract infection). There was no other change of
concomitant care or practice.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the prescribed DDD of any type of
antibiotics to any patient per 100 consultations (DDD/100c) in
the first year. The prescribed DDD is “the assumed average
Key Points
Question Does quarterly antibiotic prescription feedback to
primary care physicians over 2 years reduce antibiotic use when
implemented in a complex health care system?
Findings This nationwide pragmatic randomized trial included
2900 Swiss primary care physicians. Physicians receiving
feedback prescribed the same amount of antibiotics to all patients
as physicians without feedback. Although physicians receiving
feedback prescribed fewer antibiotics to younger patients, this
finding was not consistent over the entire intervention period.
Meaning These findings suggest that quarterly feedback does not
change overall antibiotic prescribing. Whether antibiotic use can
be reduced in some patient groups remains to be shown.

maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indica-
tion in adults.”15 Antibiotic prescriptions (in DDD/100c) were
further assessed in young children (0 to 5 years), older chil-
dren and adolescents (6 to 18 years), younger adults (19 to 65
years), elderly (older than 65 years), and women or men. We
also assessed prescriptions by specific antibiotic types (ie, tet-
racyclines, amphenicols, β-lactams/penicillins, other β-lact-
ams, sulfonamides/trimethoprim, macrolides/lincosamides/
streptogramins, aminoglycosides, quinolones, other
antibacterials, unspecified/unknown). We measured the out-
comes for the first and second year separately to evaluate early
on intervention effects in the first and any weaning effects in
the second year.
Statistical Analysis
We calculated a necessary sample size of 2900 physicians to
detectwithapowerof90%(1-β)anda2-sidedsignificancelevel
of .05 (α) a 5% between-group difference for the primary out-
come in the first year. We assumed that physicians who regu-
larly access the online service (expected to be 30% of the in-
tervention group physicians) would reduce their antibiotic
prescriptions by 5%, the remaining physicians by 2% with no
change in the control group.
We log-transformed the data for analysis because antibi-
otic prescription data were asymmetrical. We obtained least
square means from the linear mixed model and back-
transformed them to estimate and report medians in the origi-
nal scale. We estimated the intervention effect separately for
each year by comparing the between-group (intervention mi-
nuscontrol)meandifferenceoflog-transformedantibioticpre-
scription rates in the year before randomization with the be-
tween-group difference in the first and second year after
randomization using a linear mixed model. The model in-
cluded as fixed effects the randomized group (intervention or
control);time(baselineperiod,firstyear,secondyearoffollow-
up); an interaction of randomized group with time; and pre-
defined baseline covariates. As random effect, the physician
identifier was included.
All baseline covariates were selected prior to unblinding
intervention allocation. They were: the total number of con-
sultations at baseline (low, medium, high, according to ter-
tile); medication dispensing status of the physician (self-
dispensing, not self-dispensing, or mixture of both); and
patient-mix type treated by the physician. The patient-mix
was derived by a hierarchical cluster analysis of prescrip-
tions related to 4 major comorbidities, ie, immunosuppres-
sion (including rheumatic disease, cancer, HIV/AIDS, organ
transplant), asthma/COPD, cardiovascular diseases, and dia-
betes. We used the Ward method to define 2 clusters of phy-
sicians who have either a patient-mix type including many
or including few patients with these comorbidities.16 For
very few physician identifiers (n = 28), the routine data
showed implausibly high values for baseline covariates, or
an atypical combination of values for baseline variables indi-
cating group practices (eg, extremely high use of antiretrovi-
ral drugs) or data errors. We thus excluded them from the
cluster analysis using the Mahalanobis distance (highest 1%
values).17
The main analysis is by intention-to-treat not excluding
physicians who declined to receive feedback. When we had no
prescribing information for a certain month we assumed that
a physician actually prescribed no antibiotics whenever there
was at least 1 consultation in this month, otherwise we kept
thevalueofantibioticsasmissing.Wedidnotimputeanymiss-
ing data. In some cases there was no information on baseline
characteristics used for the linear model; then we excluded
those physicians from this analysis.
We conducted a combined on-intervention/per-protocol
analysis excluding intervention group physicians who opted
out (and thus did not receive the intervention over 24 months)
and excluding physicians who, in retrospect, were ineligible
based on our inclusion criteria when using the most recent and
complete data set to verify the selection criteria (see below).
This analysis was explorative, fully acknowledging the asso-
ciated selection biases.
We conducted several sensitivity analyses. We used a dif-
ferent outcome definition (prescribed packages instead of
DDD), we excluded physicians who opted out, we calculated
a model without using the baseline covariates, we excluded
physicians with incomplete follow-up data, and we excluded
physicians with outlying outcome values at any time point. We
also used the Wilcoxon rank test instead of a linear mixed
model.
Differences between self-dispensing and non–self-
dispensing physicians and between physicians treating many
or few patients with multiple comorbidities were explored in
prespecified subgroup analyses. We tested the effect modifi-
cation with a formal test for interaction in the linear model. All
analyses were done using SAS statistical software (version 9.4,
SAS Institute Inc) and R statistical software (version 3.3.0., the
R Foundation).
Source and Use of Routinely Collected Data
The data used for recruitment, intervention, and main out-
comemeasurementwasroutinelycollectedbystatutoryhealth
insurers for claims of drug prescriptions and health care ser-
vices. Owing to administrative processes, there is a lag be-
tween prescription and reimbursement dates. After 3 months,
84% of prescriptions and health care services are recorded in
the claims database, after 6 months approximately 97%. For
each quarterly feedback we used an updated data set, the fi-
nal analysis data set was provided in December 2015. Further
details are elsewhere.14
In the first study year, the feedback on antibiotic prescrip-
tions per month was based on the date of the claim (eFigure,
A, in the Supplement). This was changed in the second year
totheactualprescriptiondateswhentheprovideddataforyear
2 allowed this (eFigure, B, in the Supplement). All analyses are
based on the prescription dates.
Results
Of 2900 randomized physicians, all 1450 physicians in the in-
tervention group received the evidence-based guidelines and
first feedback information (Figure 1). Of the 1450 physicians,

lescentsand165000dosesprescribedlesstoyoungandmiddle-
aged adults. However, the findings for these populations were
not consistent over the intervention period and need to be cau-
tiously interpreted.
The costs for the intervention were low despite the large
scale: the budget for this study, including the design, imple-
mentation, and evaluation of the feedback intervention, was
in a range of $300 000 but may be higher in other settings.
We observed no impact on prescribing of specific antibi-
otic types, with the exception of reduced prescribing of mac-
rolides.However,thismightbejustachancefindingandshould
be very cautiously interpreted.
We conducted a rapid systematic review to put the re-
sultsincontext,specificallyfocusingonlarge,countrywideap-
proaches not involving elements that would be difficult to be
implemented on a large scale (such as on-site visits18 or edu-
cational elements) (eAppendix in the Supplement). Two trials
evaluated feedback on a large scale, involving more than 1000
physicans.5,6 One trial found no impact on antibiotic prescrip-
tions when 2 mailed feedback packets (that addressed also 4
other drug groups besides antibiotics) where given to unse-
lected Australian general practitioners.6 The other trial found
that a single feedback letter sent to the top 20% of antibiotic
prescribing general practitioners in 2014 in England reduced
antibiotic prescribing by 3.3% over 6 months.5 Smaller stud-
ies similarly showed inconsistent findings.7-13
In contrast to many previous feedback approaches to re-
duce outpatient antibiotic prescribing, our intervention used
several elements of feedback interventions that are increas-
ingly recognized to enhance feedback effectiveness.19 We tar-
geted individuals with suboptimal baseline performance,
aimed to decrease (instead of promote) a behavior, and gave
repetitive feedback over a longer period. We gave physicians
not only the opportunity to compare their own prescribing be-
havior to that of peers; they could also evaluate long-term
trends in their own prescribing over up to 2 years. We also

official character of the sender, however, may have increased
the awareness of the feedback. The abovementioned recent
trialfromEnglandprovidedfeedbackthatcamefromEngland'

eralSwisshealthcaresystemthereisnoofficialnationalhealth
authority that we could have involved.
Ourstudyshowsthatquarterlyprovidedprescriptionfeed-
back over 2 years is possible at low costs on a nationwide scale.
Remarkably, the intervention was feasible in a country with
multiple official languages, a complex health care system with
numerous health insurers, a large private health care sector,
and a highly federal structure allowing for self-dispensing in
some cantons. However, the online feedback system met very
little response despite promoting the online service with each
mailed feedback and repeatedly providing the website log-in
information.
We did not disclose the complete study design to partici-
pating physicians before completion to preserve generaliz-
ability of findings and avoid bias that we expected when phy-
sicians would be aware of the trial setting. The feedback was
also linked to the individual physician’s registration number
and less than 5% of the control group physicians had the
same contact data as the intervention group physicians (what
might indicate group practices), thus making relevant con-
tamination to the control group unlikely.20 This approach
maximized external validity and the routine data collection
gave us additionally the unique opportunity to monitor the
prescription behavior of those 15% of physicians who refused
to receive feedback. When we excluded declining physicians
in the on-intervention analysis, we actually observed a stron-
ger (and statistically significant) overall intervention effect
compared with the main intention-to-treat analysis. This
finding is obviously biased owing to the selective exclusion
of the nonparticipating physicians in the intervention group.
We could not identify any characteristic of this subgroup
beyond the fact that they opted out and saw slightly fewer
patients. Thus, physicians who are not approachable with
such a kind of intervention seem to prescribe differently for
reasons that are not reflected by the routine data. From
a public health perspective, the findings from the
on-intervention analysis are also informative because they
demonstrate that general practitioners who decline routine
prescription feedback represent an important special target
group for antibiotic stewardship initiatives.
Several issues may explain why we found no association
of the feedback with overall reduced prescribing rates.
First, Switzerland has the lowest antibiotic prescription
rates in Europe, thus any strategy to decrease antibiotic use
may here be more challenging than elsewhere.1,21,22
Second, the use of routinely collected data in its pres-
ently available structure introduced some limitations. We
had no individual patient data, only data aggregated by
month and physician, and we had no data on diagnoses,
hospitalizations, or mortality because such data are not rou-
tinely provided by Swiss health care providers to health
insurers. This did not allow us to determine how many DDD
were given to a specific number of patients or to measure
patient-relevant benefits and harms. However, we used data
on prescriptions for other drugs to estimate the patient mix
treated by the physicians. The aggregated nature of the data
also precluded more refined time-trend analyses using more
detailed patient-level information and we could not provide
more tailored or detailed feedback (eg, on guideline concor-
dant disease-specific prescribing, on treatment duration, or
comparisons with specific, highly matched peers with
almost identical patient populations). Although the database
is the largest available, it does not cover the entire Swiss
population. Therefore, the feedback could be based only on
a part of a physician’s patient population (this was clearly
communicated to the physicians).
Third, the feedback was based in the first year on the date
of the claim which may have made the interpretation less in-
tuitive. We were able to use the actual antibiotic prescription
date in the second year of the intervention. We then juxta-
posed the monthly personal prescriptions with that of the
peers, but also with the personal previous year prescriptions
as a second benchmark. This may explain some of the differ-
ences between the first and second year findings.
Fourth, the time lag between consultation or prescrip-
tion and database entry decreased the directness of the
given feedback in the first year and introduced some noise in
the data. This noise decreased with continuous data updates
but led to the inclusion of some physicians who would have
been ineligible based on the most updated data set available
2 years later, however the inclusion of these physicians had
no impact on the interpretation of findings, as the sensitivity
analyses show. These deficiencies of routine data collection
may have led to a smaller intervention effect, but they are
probably inevitable in many health care settings with cur-
rent data infrastructures.
Fifth, the peer comparison may have had negative effects
for those receiving positive feedback showing that they are do-
ing better than the average because they might sit back and
tend to underachieve. However, this could also be a positive
reinforcement to sustain the behavior, which would agree with
successfulreductionsofantibioticprescriptionsinarecenttrial
that specifically involved such reinforcing feedback.13
Finally, the aggregated routinely collected claims data do
not allow drawing any conclusion on patient-relevant ben-
efits and antibiotic resistance in the community.
It remains unclear why the intervention affected prescrip-
tions for some but not all patient populations. This might be
just a chance finding owing to numerous subanalyses. An-
other explanation might be that indications to prescribe anti-
biotics in older children and younger adults might be per-
ceivedaslesscompelling,andthusallowingmorerestraintthan
in elderly patients or very young children where medical rea-
sons (eg, comorbidities) and external pressure (eg, parents’ ex-
pectations) might be more compelling.
