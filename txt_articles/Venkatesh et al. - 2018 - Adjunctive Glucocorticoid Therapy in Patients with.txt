BACKGROUND
Whether hydrocortisone reduces mortality among patients with septic shock is unclear.
METHODS
We randomly assigned patients with septic shock who were undergoing mechanical ven-
tilation to receive hydrocortisone (at a dose of 200 mg per day) or placebo for 7 days or 
until death or discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU), whichever came first. The 
primary outcome was death from any cause at 90 days.
RESULTS
From March 2013 through April 2017, a total of 3800 patients underwent randomization. 
Status with respect to the primary outcome was ascertained in 3658 patients (1832 of 
whom had been assigned to the hydrocortisone group and 1826 to the placebo group). At 
90 days, 511 patients (27.9%) in the hydrocortisone group and 526 (28.8%) in the placebo 
group had died (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.10; P 
= 
0.50). The 
effect of the trial regimen was similar in six prespecified subgroups. Patients who had 
been assigned to receive hydrocortisone had faster resolution of shock than those 
 
assigned to the placebo group (median duration, 3 days [interquartile range, 2 to 5] vs. 
4 days [interquartile range, 2 to 9]; hazard ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.41; P<0.001). 
Patients in the hydrocortisone group had a shorter duration of the initial episode of me-
chanical ventilation than those in the placebo group (median, 6 days [interquartile range, 
3 to 18] vs. 7 days [interquartile range, 3 to 24]; hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.22; 
P<0.001), but taking into account episodes of recurrence of ventilation, there were no 
significant differences in the number of days alive and free from mechanical ventilation. 
Fewer patients in the hydrocortisone group than in the placebo group received a blood 
transfusion (37.0% vs. 41.7%; odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94; P 
= 
0.004). There were 
no significant between-group differences with respect to mortality at 28 days, the rate of 
recurrence of shock, the number of days alive and out of the ICU, the number of days alive 
and out of the hospital, the recurrence of mechanical ventilation, the rate of renal-replace-
ment therapy, and the incidence of new-onset bacteremia or fungemia.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with septic shock undergoing mechanical ventilation, a continuous infu-
sion of hydrocortisone did not result in lower 90-day mortality than placebo. (Funded by

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
S
epsis, which has been identified by 
the World Health Organization as a global 
health priority, has no proven pharmaco-
logic treatment, other than the appropriate anti-
biotic agents, fluids, and vasopressors as needed; 
reported death rates among hospitalized patients 
range between 30% and 45%.1-6 Glucocorticoids 
have been used as an adjuvant therapy for septic 
shock for more than 40 years.7 Nonetheless, un-
certainty about their safety and efficacy remains.
Randomized, controlled trials that were con-
ducted in the 1980s showed that the use of high-
dose methylprednisolone (30 mg per kilogram of 
body weight) was associated with higher morbid-
ity and mortality than control.8,9 Two random-
ized, controlled trials that examined the effect 
of lower-dose hydrocortisone (200 mg per day) 
on mortality among patients with septic shock 
showed conflicting results,10,11 although each trial 
showed an earlier reversal of shock in patients 
who had been treated with hydrocortisone than 
in control patients.
Subsequent systematic reviews and meta-
analyses have not provided compelling evidence 
for or against the use of hydrocortisone in pa-
tients with septic shock.12-14 Current clinical 
practice guidelines recommend the use of hydro-
cortisone in patients with septic shock if ade-
quate fluid resuscitation and treatment with vaso-
pressors have not restored hemodynamic stability; 
however, the guidelines classify the recommen-
dation as weak, on the basis of the low quality 
of available evidence.15
The uncertainty about the efficacy of gluco-
corticoids in reducing mortality among patients 
with septic shock has resulted in widespread 
variation in clinical practice.16 Reports of poten-
tial adverse effects associated with glucocorti-
coids, including superinfection and metabolic and 
neuromuscular effects, have compounded clinical 
uncertainty.11 We designed the Adjunctive Corti-
costeroid Treatment in Critically Ill Patients with 
Septic Shock (ADRENAL) trial to test the hypoth-
esis that hydrocortisone results in lower mortality 
than placebo among patients with septic shock.17
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
Our trial was an investigator-initiated, interna-
tional, pragmatic, double-blind, parallel-group, 
randomized, controlled trial that compared intra-
venous infusions of hydrocortisone with matched 
placebo in patients with septic shock who were 
undergoing mechanical ventilation in an inten-
sive care unit (ICU). We conducted the trial in 
Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, 
Saudi Arabia, and Denmark.
The trial management committee designed the 
trial. The trial sponsor (the George Institute for 
Global Health, Australia) coordinated all the 
operational processes and conducted all the sta-
tistical analyses. Trained research coordinators 
collected data at each site and entered the infor-
mation into a Web-based database. Data monitor-
ing and source-data verification were conducted 
according to a prespecified monitoring plan (Ta-
ble S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).
Before enrollment was completed, we pub-
lished the trial protocol (available at NEJM.org) 
and statistical analysis plan.17,18 Approval from a 
human research ethics committee was obtained 
for all the sites before enrollment of the patients. 
Previous written informed consent or written 
consent to continue was obtained for all par-
ticipants, according to the legal requirements in 
each jurisdiction. The authors vouch for the ac-
curacy and completeness of the data and statisti-
cal analyses and for the fidelity of the trial to the 
protocol.
Neither Pfizer (which supplied hydrocortisone) 
nor Radpharm Scientific (which supplied placebo) 
had any input into the design or conduct of the 
study, data collection, statistical analysis, or writ-
ing of the manuscript. Mater Pharmacy Services 
(Brisbane, Australia) was responsible for acquisi-
tion of the drugs and the blinding processes. 
There was no contractual arrangement between 
the trial sponsor, the George Institute for Global 
Health, and either Pfizer or Radpharm Scientific. 
All contractual arrangements were between Mater 
Pharmacy Services and the George Institute for 
Global Health.
Patients
Eligible participants were adults (≥18 years of 
age) who were undergoing mechanical ventilation, 
for whom there was a documented or strong 
clinical suspicion of infection, who fulfilled two 
or more criteria of the systemic inflammatory 
response syndrome,19 and who had been treated 
with vasopressors or inotropic agents for a mini-
mum of 4 hours up to and at the time of ran-

domization. Patients were excluded if they were 
likely to receive treatment with systemic gluco-
corticoids for an indication other than septic 
shock, had received etomidate20 (a short-acting 
anesthetic agent with adrenal-suppressant prop-
erties) during the current hospital admission, 
were considered to be likely to die from a pre-
existing disease within 90 days after randomiza-
tion or had treatment limitations in place, or 
had met all the inclusion criteria for more than 
24 hours. Detailed inclusion and exclusion crite-
ria and the alignment of these criteria with the 
Third International Consensus Definitions for 
Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3)21 are provided 
in Tables S2A through S2C in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
Randomization and Trial Regimen
We concealed the randomized trial-group assign-
ments using a minimization algorithm by means 
of a password-protected, encrypted, Web-based 
interface. Randomization was stratified accord-
ing to participating center and according to 
medical or surgical admission. Surgical admis-
sions were defined as patients being admitted to 
the ICU from the operating room or the recovery 
room; all other admissions were considered to 
be medical admissions.
Patients were assigned to receive an intrave-
nous infusion of hydrocortisone (Pfizer) at a dose 
of 200 mg per day or matching placebo (Rad-
pharm Scientific). Blinding regarding the trial 
regimen was ensured by the supply of hydrocor-
tisone and placebo in identical, masked vials. 
The integrity of the trial-group assignment was 
confirmed by an independent person who as-
sessed a random sample of hydrocortisone and 
placebo packs from 10% of the trial population 
(Table S3A in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
trial regimen was reconstituted to produce a 
concentration of 1 mg per milliliter of hydrocor-
tisone or an equivalent volume (in milliliters) of 
placebo. The trial dose volume was set at 200 ml, 
which was administered by means of continuous 
intravenous infusion over a period of 24 hours 
for a maximum of 7 days or until ICU discharge 
or death, whichever occurred first. A description of 
the blinding process and of the preparation and 
reconstitution of the trial regimen is provided in 
Table S3B in the Supplementary Appendix.
The patients, treating clinicians, and trial per-
sonnel were unaware of the trial-group assign-
ments and sequence. All other aspects of the 
patients’ care were conducted at the discretion of 
the treating clinicians.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was death from any cause 
at 90 days after randomization. Secondary out-
comes included death from any cause at 28 days 
after randomization, the time to the resolution 
of shock,22 the recurrence of shock, the length of 
ICU stay, the length of hospital stay, the fre-
quency and duration of mechanical ventilation, 
the frequency and duration of treatment with 
renal-replacement therapy, the incidence of new-
onset bacteremia or fungemia between 2 and 
14 days after randomization, and the receipt of 
blood transfusion in the ICU. Definitions of the 
secondary outcomes are provided in Table S4 in 
the Supplementary Appendix.
Statistical Analysis
We determined that a population of 3800 patients 
would provide the trial with 90% power to detect 
an absolute difference of 5 percentage points in 
90-day all-cause mortality from an estimated 
baseline mortality of 33%, at an alpha level of 
0.05.6 This calculation allowed for a rate of with-
drawal and loss to follow-up of 1%.
The primary-outcome result is presented as 
the odds ratio for death, with corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals, analyzed with the use of a 
logistic-regression model with adjustment for 
stratification variables, with admission type (med-
ical or surgical) as a fixed effect and trial site as 
a random effect. Additional sensitivity analyses 
were performed by adding the following covari-
ates to the main logistic-regression model: sex; 
age; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evalu-
ation (APACHE) II score, assessed on a scale from 
0 to 71, with higher scores indicating a higher risk 
of death23; the time from the onset of shock to 
randomization; and the use of renal-replacement 
therapy in the 24 hours before randomization.
The primary outcome was also examined in 
six prespecified subgroups, which were defined 
according to the following baseline characteris-
tics: admission type (medical vs. surgical); dose 
of catecholamine infusions (norepinephrine or 
epinephrine at a dose of <15 μg per minute vs. 
≥15 μg per minute); primary site of sepsis (pul-
monary vs. nonpulmonary); sex (male vs. female); 
APACHE II score (<25 vs. ≥25; a score of ≥25 has

been used as a cutoff point to identify patients 
at a higher risk for death24,25); and the duration 
of shock according to four intervals of 6 hours 
each between 0 and 24 hours before randomiza-
tion (<6 hours, 6 to 12 hours, 12 to 18 hours, or 
18 to 24 hours). The secondary binary and con-
tinuous outcomes were analyzed with the use of 
logistic regression and linear regression, respec-
tively, with adjustment for stratification variables. 
The rate of death in a time-to-event analysis was 
reported with the use of Kaplan–Meier plots, 
and differences in survival were tested with the 
use of a Cox proportional-hazards model26 that 
included the randomized trial group, admission 
type, and a random effect for trial site.
The times to the resolution of shock and ven-
tilation and the times to discharge from the ICU 
and the hospital were analyzed by means of two 
approaches: with death treated as a competing 
risk27 and with results described with the use of 
cumulative incidence function; and as a post hoc 
analysis with data from patients censored at the 
time of death and with results described with the 
use of Kaplan–Meier plots. Differences in the time 
to event (e.g., resolution of shock, cessation of 
ventilation, and ICU or hospital discharge) were 
tested with the use of the same Cox model that 
was used for the analysis of time to death.
Physiological data were averaged over the 
period of days 1 to 14 and compared with the 
use of a repeated-measure, linear mixed model 
and were presented as overall mean differences 
with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. 
Post hoc analyses were performed with the use 
of a separate calculation of the mean differences 
over the period of days 1 to 7 (duration of trial 
regimen) and days 8 to 14. The proportions of 
patients who had adverse events and serious 
adverse events were compared with the use of 
Fisher’s exact test.
All the analyses were conducted on an inten-
tion-to-treat basis with no imputation of missing 
data. For secondary outcomes, a post hoc Holm–
Bonferroni procedure was applied to control for 
multiple testing.28 All the analyses were con-
ducted with the use of SAS software, version 9.4 
(SAS Institute).
Two prespecified interim analyses were per-
formed by an independent statistician when 950 
patients (25%) and 2500 patients (66%) could be 
assessed with regard to the primary outcome at 
90 days. These analyses were reviewed by an 
independent data monitoring committee.
Results
Patients
From March 2013 through April 2017, we identi-
fied 5501 eligible patients, of whom 3800 were 
enrolled in the trial at 69 medical–surgical ICUs. 
The ICUs were in Australia (45 sites), the United 
Kingdom (12), New Zealand (8), Saudi Arabia (3), 
and Denmark (1).
Of the 3800 patients enrolled, 1898 were as-
signed to receive hydrocortisone and 1902 to 
receive placebo. A total of 114 patients (3.0%) 
either withdrew (24 patients) or did not have 
informed consent obtained (90), and 28 of the 
remaining 3686 patients (0.8%) were lost to 
follow-up at 90 days. Thus, the trial included 
3658 enrolled patients, of whom 1832 in the 
hydrocortisone group and 1826 in the placebo 
group were included in the analysis of the pri-
mary outcome (Figs. S1 and S2 and Table S5 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
The characteristics of the patients at baseline 
were similar in the two groups (Table 1). The 
mean (±SD) age of the patients was 62.3±14.9 
years in the hydrocortisone group and 62.7±15.2 
years in the placebo group; the percentages of 
male patients were 60.4% and 61.3%, respec-
tively; the median APACHE II scores were 24.0 
(interquartile range, 19.0 to 29.0) and 23.0 (in-
terquartile range, 18.0 to 29.0), respectively; and 
the percentages of patients with surgical admis-
sion were 31.2% and 31.8%, respectively. The 
primary site of infection was similar in the two 
groups and was predominantly of pulmonary 
origin among patients with a medical diagnosis 
and of abdominal origin among patients with a 
surgical admission (Tables S6 and S7 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Trial and Concomitant Regimens
The assigned trial regimen was received by 1834 
of 1837 patients (99.8%) in the hydrocortisone 
group and by 1838 of 1843 (99.7%) in the pla-
cebo group. The median time from randomiza-
tion to the commencement of the trial regimen 
was 0.8 hours (interquartile range, 0.4 to 1.6) in 
the hydrocortisone group and 0.8 hours (inter-
quartile range, 0.4 to 1.5) in the placebo group

Adjunctive Glucocorticoid Therapy for Septic Shock
(P 
= 
0.28). There was no significant between-
group difference in the cumulative duration of 
the trial regimen (median, 5.1 days [interquartile 
range, 2.7 to 6.8] in the hydrocortisone group 
and 5.6 days [interquartile range, 2.9 to 6.8] in 
the placebo group; P 
= 
0.09). The overall mean 
rate of adherence to the dosing protocol was 
95.2±11.3% in the hydrocortisone group and 
94.9±12.1% in the placebo group (P 
= 
0.34) (Table 
S8 and Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Between days 1 and 14 after randomization, 
138 of 1853 patients (7.4%) in the hydrocorti-
sone group and 164 of 1860 (8.8%) in the pla-
cebo group received open-label glucocorticoids 
(P 
= 
0.13). The use of inotropes, vasopressors, 
etomidate, statins, and antimicrobial therapies did 
not differ significantly between the groups (Ta-
bles S8 and S9 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Between days 1 and 7, patients in the hydro-
cortisone group had a higher mean arterial pres-
sure than did those in the placebo group (differ-
ence, 5.39 mm Hg; P<0.001), as well as a higher 
plasma lactate level (difference, 0.08 mmol per 
liter; P 
= 
0.02) and a lower heart rate (difference, 
−6.6 beats per minute; P<0.001). There were no 
significant between-group differences in the daily 
peak dose of norepinephrine among patients 
who were receiving vasopressors between days 1 
and 14. (Details are provided in Fig. S4A through 
S4E in the Supplementary Appendix.)
Primary Outcome
At 90 days after randomization, 511 of 1832 pa-
tients (27.9%) who had been assigned to receive 
hydrocortisone had died, as had 526 of 1826 
(28.8%) who had been assigned to receive pla-
cebo (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 0.82 to 1.10; P 
= 
0.50) (Table 2, and Table 
S10 and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
There was no significant between-group differ-
ence in the rate of death in the time-to-event 
analysis during the 90 days after randomization 
(hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.07; P 
= 
0.42) 
(Fig. 1A).
There was no significant heterogeneity in the 
effect of the trial regimen on the primary out-
come in the six prespecified subgroups (Fig. 1B). 
A post hoc sensitivity analysis that excluded pa-
tients who had received open-label glucocorti-
coids did not alter the primary outcome result 
(odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.12; P 
= 
0.59).
Secondary Outcomes
There was no significant between-group differ-
ence in mortality at 28 days (Table 2, and Table 
S10 in the Supplementary Appendix). The time 
to the resolution of shock was shorter in the 
hydrocortisone group than in the placebo group 
(median, 3 days [interquartile range, 2 to 5] vs. 
4 days [interquartile range, 2 to 9]; hazard ratio, 
1.32; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.41; P<0.001) (Fig. 2, and 
Fig. S6A and S6B in the Supplementary Appendix).
The time to discharge from the ICU was 
shorter in the hydrocortisone group than in the 
placebo group (median, 10 days [interquartile 
range, 5 to 30] vs. 12 days [interquartile range, 
6 to 42]; hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.23; 
P<0.001) (Fig. S6C and S6D in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). After adjustment for multiple 
comparisons, there was no significant between-
group difference in the number of days alive and 
out of the ICU (P 
= 
0.047; threshold level for 
significance after adjustment for multiple com-
parisons, P 
= 
0.005) (Table 2, and Table S11 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Patients in the hydrocortisone group had a 
shorter duration of the initial episode of me-
chanical ventilation than did those in the pla-
cebo group (median, 6 days [interquartile range, 
3 to 18] vs. 7 days [interquartile range, 3 to 24]; 
hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.22; P<0.001), 
but taking into account episodes of recurrence 
of ventilation, there were no significant differ-
ences in the number of days alive and free from 
mechanical ventilation (Table 2, and Fig. S6G 
and S6H in the Supplementary Appendix).
There were no significant between-group dif-
ferences with respect to the rate of recurrence of 
shock, the time to hospital discharge, the num-
ber of days alive and out of hospital, the rate of 
recurrence of mechanical ventilation, the dura-
tion and rate of use of renal-replacement ther-
apy, and the rate of development of new-onset 
bacteremia or fungemia (Table 2, and Fig. S6E 
and S6F in the Supplementary Appendix).
Fewer patients in the hydrocortisone group 
than in the placebo group received a blood 
transfusion (37.0% vs. 41.7%; odds ratio, 0.82; 
95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94; P 
= 
0.004). Among the pa-
tients who received a transfusion, there was no 
significant between-group difference with respect 
to the mean total volume of blood transfused 
(Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).

Adjunctive Glucocorticoid Therapy for Septic Shock
Adverse Events
A total of 33 adverse events was reported in the 
trial population, with a higher percentage in the 
hydrocortisone group than in the placebo group 
(1.1% vs. 0.3%, P 
= 
0.009). There were 6 serious 
adverse events, with 4 occurring in the hydrocor-
tisone group and 2 in the placebo group (Ta-
ble 3). The list of protocol violations and the 
results of the interim analyses are presented in 
Tables S12 and S13, respectively, in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
Discussion
We found that the administration of hydrocorti-
sone did not result in lower 90-day mortality 
than placebo among patients with septic shock. 
This effect did not differ in any of the six pre-
specified subgroups. We observed a more rapid 
resolution of shock and a lower incidence of 
blood transfusion among patients who received 
hydrocortisone than among those who received 
placebo. Patients who had been assigned to re-
ceive hydrocortisone had a shorter time to ICU 
discharge and earlier cessation of the initial epi-
sode of mechanical ventilation than did those 
who had been assigned to receive placebo. There 
were no significant between-group differences 
with respect to mortality at 28 days, the rate of 
recurrence of shock, the number of days alive and 
out of the ICU or hospital, the duration and rate 
of recurrence of mechanical ventilation, the rate 
of use of renal-replacement therapy, or the rate of 
new-onset bacteremia or fungemia. Patients who 
had been assigned to receive hydrocortisone had 
more adverse events than did those who had been 
assigned to receive placebo, but these events did 
not affect patient-centered outcomes.
Our pragmatic trial was designed with statis-
tical power to detect a clinically plausible effect 
on mortality. To reduce bias, we used a central 
randomization process and ensured the conceal-
ment and blinding of trial-group assignments, 
which were independently verified. We published 
our statistical analysis plan before unblinding.
We chose 90-day mortality as a patient-cen-
tered primary outcome and specifically targeted 
a population of patients who had high require-
ments for vital organ support (use of mechanical 
ventilation and ≥4 hours of vasopressor therapy

§  
The values for baseline therapies denote the value in the 24 hours before randomization. The percentages of patients 
who underwent mechanical ventilation or who received inotropic or vasopressor support was not 100% at baseline, 
which indicates the randomization of ineligible patients. Other inotropes or vasopressors include drugs such as dopa-
mine, dobutamine, levosimendan, or metaraminol.
¶  
The values for heart rate, the mean arterial pressure, and the central venous pressure represent the most recent values 
that were observed before randomization. The lowest values for the mean arterial pressure and the ratio of the partial 
pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (the partial Pao2:Fio2) and the highest values for the lac-
tate, bilirubin, and creatinine levels and the white-cell count were measured during the 24 hours before randomization. 
To convert the values for lactate to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.11. To convert the values for bilirubin to micro-
moles per liter, multiply by 17.1. To convert the values for creatinine to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4.

Plus–minus values are means ±SD. Medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) are presented for not normally distributed variables. The analyses of mortality at day 90 and day 28 that are 
reported in this table, with adjustment for stratification variables, were performed with the use of logistic regression, with the inclusion of trial group and admission type as fixed effects 
and trial site as a random effect. Unadjusted mortality is reported in Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix. The notation NA (not available) in the IQR for the time to hospital dis-
charge indicates that less than 75% of the patients (the upper limit of the IQR) had been discharged from the hospital by day 90, so the data are not reported. Adjustments for multiple 
comparisons for all secondary outcomes are reported in Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix. Informed consent could be obtained for the use of all or part of the data (Fig. S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Consequently, the numbers of patients for whom data are available for the analyses varies.

Figure 1. Rate of Survival and the Risk of Death at 90 Days, According to Subgroup.
Panel A shows Kaplan–Meier estimates of the survival rate among patients receiving hydrocortisone or placebo. The P value was calculated 
with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model that included the randomized trial group, admission type (medical or surgical), and a random 
effect of trial center. Panel B shows the odds ratio of death at 90 days in the six prespecified subgroups. The size of the square representing the 
odds ratio reflects the relative numbers in each subgroup, and horizontal bars represent 95% confidence intervals. P values are for heterogene-
ity of the effect of the trial regimen on the primary outcome in each subgroup. Scores on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation 
(APACHE) II are assessed on a scale from 0 to 71, with higher scores indicating a higher risk of death (a score of ≥25 has been used as a cutoff 
point to identify patients at a higher risk for death).23-25 Data on admission type were missing for 1 patient in the placebo group; on the catechola-
mine dose for 15 in the hydrocortisone group and for 26 in the placebo group; on the APACHE II score for 2 and 2, respectively; and on the time 
from shock onset to randomization for 7 and 7, respectively.

before randomization) and a substantial risk of 
death. The trial was successful in enrolling the 
intended population.
A high proportion of eligible patients received 
the trial intervention as planned, and few enrolled 
patients were lost to follow-up. The ratio of pa-
tients who underwent randomization to those 
who were eligible for inclusion was high: 0.69:1, 
a ratio that approaches that seen in other large-
scale trials.29 The inclusion of 69 sites in five 
countries increases the external validity of the 
results.
Our trial differs from previously published 
trials in several respects.10,11 We administered 
hydrocortisone by means of continuous infusion, 
because such a plan has been shown to attenuate 
the inflammatory response and reverse shock.30 
Practice guidelines for septic shock suggest that 
infusions may minimize potentially harmful 
metabolic effects of glucocorticoids.15,31 A taper-
ing strategy was not used for the discontinua-
tion of glucocorticoids, because a beneficial effect 
of these agents on survival was previously re-
ported without tapering.10 A recent study that 
compared abrupt cessation with a tapering strat-
egy showed no benefits from tapering.32 We did 
not perform corticotropin testing, because its 
interpretation in critically ill patients is contro-
versial33-35 and such testing is not recommend-
ed in current clinical practice guidelines.15 We 
excluded patients who had received etomidate 
before randomization. We did not administer 
fludrocortisone, because it has been shown 
previously to be ineffective.36

The determination that an adverse event, serious adverse 
event, or suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction 
(SUSAR) had occurred was at the discretion of the treat-
ing clinician. Prospective definitions of adverse events, 
serious adverse events, and SUSARs and a system of re-
porting are provided in section 11 of the protocol. An ad-
verse event was any adverse reaction that was thought to 
be related to the trial regimen and listed in the product 
information sheet. A serious adverse event was defined 
as any adverse reaction that resulted in death, was life-
threatening, resulted in the prolongation of existing hos-
pitalization, or resulted in persistent or significant dis-
ability or incapacity. A SUSAR was defined as a serious 
adverse event whose nature, severity, specificity, or out-
come was not consistent with the terms or descriptions 
used in the product information sheet. Some patients 
had more than one event. No SUSARS were reported 
during the trial.
†  
A serious adverse event was reported. There were a total 
of four serious adverse events (two of myopathy, one of 
ischemic bowel, and one of circulatory shock) in the hy-
drocortisone group and two events (one of bleeding and 
one of abdominal-wound dehiscence) in the placebo 
group.
‡  
Myopathy was reported on the basis of clinical findings 
of muscle weakness or biochemical evidence of an in-
creased creatine kinase level.

Adjunctive Glucocorticoid Therapy for Septic Shock
of a large pragmatic trial, we collected data on 
only adverse events that had been judged by the 
treating clinicians to be related to the trial regi-
men, and we did not adjudicate this judgment. 
This approach may weaken the inferences about 
adverse events. We did not collect data regarding 
all possible secondary infections, and we record-
ed only bacteremia and fungemia, which are less 
subject to diagnostic error or ascertainment bias. 
We did not adjudicate the appropriateness of 
antibiotic therapy. We used rates of recurrence 
of ventilation as a surrogate for myopathy but did 
not assess long-term neuromuscular weakness.
Our trial provides evidence about the role 
of hydrocortisone as an adjunctive treatment in 
patients with septic shock. Although we did not 
observe a significant difference between the hy-
drocortisone group and the placebo group with 
regard to 90-day mortality, some secondary out-
comes were better in the group that received the 
active treatment. Our observation of the hemo-
dynamic effects of hydrocortisone is consistent 
with those in previous studies.37-39 These hemo-
dynamic effects may represent a beneficial role 
of hydrocortisone. There was a lower incidence 
of transfusion in the hydrocortisone group than 
in the placebo group, a finding that may be re-
garded as hypothesis-generating. A detailed cost–
benefit assessment of these results was not done, 
but such an analysis may inform clinicians about 
the overall cost-effectiveness of hydrocortisone 
in patients with septic shock.
In conclusion, in patients with septic shock 
who were undergoing mechanical ventilation, 
the administration of a continuous infusion of 
hydrocortisone did not result in lower mortality 
at 90 days than placebo.
