 methods, including both protein design and hu-
man B cell probing methods, could be used to
improve and evaluate germline-targeting immu-
nogens for other classes of HIV bnAbs and for
Abs against other pathogens. These methods may
be particularly important to develop and test
germline-targeting approaches for bnAbs that
rely heavily on HCDR3 and hence may have lower
precursor frequencies.

As tumors grow, they acquire mutations, some of which create neoantigens that
influence the response of patients to immune checkpoint inhibitors. We explored the
impact of neoantigen intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) on antitumor immunity. Through
integrated analysis of ITH and neoantigen burden, we demonstrate a relationship
between clonal neoantigen burden and overall survival in primary lung adenocarcinomas.
CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes reactive to clonal neoantigens were identified in
early-stage non–small cell lung cancer and expressed high levels of PD-1. Sensitivity
to PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade in patients with advanced NSCLC and melanoma was
enhanced in tumors enriched for clonal neoantigens. T cells recognizing clonal
neoantigens were detectable in patients with durable clinical benefit. Cytotoxic
chemotherapy–induced subclonal neoantigens, contributing to an increased mutational
load, were enriched in certain poor responders. These data suggest that neoantigen
heterogeneity may influence immune surveillance and support therapeutic
developments targeting clonal neoantigens.
R
ecent studies have highlighted the rele-
vance of tumor neoantigens in the recog-
nition of cancer cells by the immune system
(1–4), prompting a renewed interested in
personalized vaccines and cell therapies
that target cancer mutations (5, 6). However,
although genomic data are revealing the extent
of genetic heterogeneity within single tumors (7),
the influence of intratumor heterogeneity (ITH)
upon the neoantigen landscape and sensitivity to
immune modulation is unclear.
To explore neoantigen heterogeneity and
its influence on antitumor immunity in early-
stage non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we
applied a bioinformatics pipeline to seven pri-
mary NSCLCs subjected to multiregion se-
quence analysis (table S1) (8, 9). In total, 2860
putative neoantigens were predicted across
the cohort, with a median of 326 neoantigens
predicted per tumor (range of 80 to 741) (Fig. 1A).
Neoantigen heterogeneity varied considerab-
ly, with an average of 44% neoantigens found

 heterogeneously, in a subset of tumor regions
(range of 10 to 78%).
To address the clinical relevance of neoantigen
burden and, specifically, the importance of clonal
(presentinalltumorcells)versussubclonal(present
only in a subset) neoantigens, we subjected a
predominantly early-stage cohort of 106 stage
I/II, 43 stage III/IV, and 1 unknown-stage lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and 92 stage I/II and
32 stage III/IV lung squamous cell carcinoma
(LUSC) cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) to neoantigen and clonality analysis (10–12)
(Fig. 1B). In this setting, to determine clonality
from sequencing of a single sample, the cancer
cell fraction, which describes the proportion of
cancer cells harboring a mutation, was deter-
mined for each neoantigen (13).
A high neoantigen burden, defined as the up-
per quartile of neoantigen load, was associated
with significantly longer overall survival in LUAD
(P = 0.025) (Fig. 1, C and D, and fig. S1A), and a
trend for homogeneous tumors (neoantigen ITH ≤
1%) to have longer overall survival times as com-
pared with that of heterogeneous tumors was also
observed (P = 0.061) (fig. S1B). Although tumors
with a high burden of neoantigens were found to
be significantly more homogeneous than those
with a low burden of neoantigens (P < 0.0001,
Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (fig. S1C), a combina-
tion of neoantigen ITH and neoantigen burden
(as outlined in the schematic in Fig. 1C) was more
significant than simply considering either metric
alone and was observed across multiple different
neoantigen ITH thresholds (without ITH thresh-
old, P = 0.025; ITH threshold = 0, P = 0.019; ITH
threshold = 0.01, P = 0.0096; ITH threshold =
0.05, P = 0.021) (Fig. 1D), remaining significant in
multivariate analysis when including the tumor
stage (table S2).
Despite a comparable range of predicted neo-
antigens in LUSC, no statistically significant as-
sociation between overall survival and neoantigen
load was observed in this subtype, even when
incorporating neoantigen ITH (fig. S2, A to D).
To investigate the reason for this disparity, we
explored whether any immune-regulatory genes
were differentially expressed between these two
cancer types. Human lymphocyte antigen (HLA)
class I genes—including HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C,
HLA-E, HLA-F, and HLA-G, as well as b2 micro-
globulin(b2M),acomponentofthemajorhistocom-
patibility complex (MHC) class I molecule—
were expressed at a significantly lower level
in LUSC as compared with LUAD (fig. S3A and
table S3A), and this difference was observed across
all levels of neoantigen burden (fig. S3B and ta-
ble S3B). HLA class I genes were also down-
regulatedcomparedwith matchednormal samples
in LUSC (table S3C). These data suggest that
the presence of a high number of clonal neo-
antigens in homogeneous LUAD may favor ef-
fective immune surveillance, whereas in LUSC,
immune escape may be more prevalent through
HLA down-regulation.
We next evaluated whether immune-related
genes were differentially expressed between homo-
geneous LUAD tumors (≤1% neoantigen ITH) with
a high clonal neoantigen burden (greater than or
equal to upper-quartile clonal neoantigens) com-
pared with heterogeneous (>1% neoantigen ITH)
or low clonal neoantigen burden tumors (less
than upper-quartile clonal neoantigens). Eight
genes were found to be significantly differentially
expressed between these two groups (table S4A).
Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and the
proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) were
the most significantly differentially expressed genes,
up-regulated in the homogeneous and high clonal
neoantigen group. When we specifically compared
tumors in the upper quartile of clonal neoantigen
burden with tumors in the lower quartile, we iden-
tified an additional 25 significantly differentially
expressed genes (table S4B and fig. S4A). CD8A,
CD8B, and genes associated with antigen presen-
tation (TAP-1, TAP-2, and STAT-1), T cell migration
(CXCL-10 and CXCL-9), and effector T cell function
[interferon- g (IFN-g) and granzymes B, H, and A]
were up-regulated in the high clonal neoantigen
cohort and found to cluster together, indicating
coexpression (fig. S4B). PD-1 and lymphocyte
activation gene 3 (LAG-3)—negative regulators of
T cell function (14)—were also identified in this
cluster, as were the ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2.
These data suggest that a high clonal neo-
antigen burden in LUAD is associated with an
inflamed tumor microenvironment enriched with
activated effector T cells, potentially regulated
by inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules and
their ligands. We therefore attempted to identify
and characterize T cells reactive to neoantigens
in patients with early-stage NSCLC. We focused
on two tumors, L011 and L012, with a comparable
number of predicted neoantigens and a similar
smoking history, but divergent levels of neoantigen
ITH (8 versus 74% heterogeneous predicted neo-
antigens) (Fig. 2, A to C). We used 288 and 354
putative neoantigen-loaded, HLA-matched mul-
timers derived from L011 and L012, respectively,
to screen CD8+ T cells expanded from individual
tumor regions and adjacent normal lung tissue,
using a previously described high-throughput
method (Fig. 2, D and E) (15).
CD8+ T cells reactive to mutant MTFR2D326Y
(FAFQEYDSF) were identified in L011, whereas
in L012, two distinct CD8+ T cell responses to mu-
tant CHTF18L769V (LLDIVAPK) and MYADMR30W
(SPMIVGSPW) were observed (Fig. 2, D and E,
and fig. S5, A and B). MTFR2D326Y, CHTF18L769V,
and MYADMR30W all represent clonal neoanti-
gens, suggesting that immune-reactivity against
clonal neoantigens can be detected in both ho-
mogeneous and heterogeneous NSCLC. High HLA
binding affinity was predicted for MTFR2D326Y
and CHTF18L769V in both wild-type and mutant
forms, but only the mutant peptide was found to
elicit a T cell response. Higher binding affinity to
mutant versus wild-type form was predicted for
MYADMR30W; however, in this case, reactivity to-
ward wild-type peptide was also observed (fig. S5C).
The mutation in the MYADMR30W peptide lies in
the anchor residue, primarily affecting HLA bind-
ing and not T cell recognition. Although the data
suggest that T cells in this patient can recognize
both mutant and wild-type peptides when sta-
bilized within a MHC-multimer system, the very
low predicted affinity of the wild-type peptide
to HLA would be expected to prevent adequate
presentation in vivo.
We next used MHC multimers that identify
neoantigen-reactive T (NAR-T) cells to character-
ize NAR-T cells in unexpanded samples (Fig. 3, A
to D). MTFR2D326Y-reactive CD8+ T cells, identi-
fied in unexpanded L011, were analyzed by means
of multicolor flow cytometry. We assessed rela-
tive expression of co-inhibitory immune check-
point molecules and effector cytokines between
tumor-infiltrating CD4+FoxP3+ (regulatory T cell),
CD4+FoxP3– (CD4+ helper T cell), CD8+ multimer
negative, and CD8+ multimer-reactive (MTFR2D326Y+)
T cell subsets. MTFR2D326Y+ CD8+ T cells ex-
pressed high levels of co-inhibitory receptors
PD-1 and LAG-3 (Fig. 3C), which is consistent
with our bioinformatics findings (fig. S4). Almost
all NAR-T cells (97%) expressed high levels of
PD-1, compared with 49% of multimer-negative
tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. CTLA-4 expres-
sion was largely confined to CD4+FoxP3+ regu-
latory T cells, which is consistent with preclinical
findings (16). PD-1+ MTFR2 D326Y-reactive CD8+
T cells coexpressed high levels of granzyme B
(GzmB) (74.8%) (Fig. 3D). Characterization of
CHTF18L769V- and MYADMR30W-reactive CD8+
T cells mirrored findings in L011, with high ex-
pression of PD-1 observed in 97% and 99.6% of
CHFT18L769V- and MYADMR30W-reactive CD8+
T cells, respectively (fig. S5, D and E).
Given the potential ability of clonal neoanti-
gens to promote priming and infiltration by neo-
antigen reactive T cells expressing high levels
of PD-1, we explored whether response to PD-
1 blockade in patients with advanced NSCLC
may be influenced by neoantigen ITH. Exome

an antibody targeting PD-1—was obtained (table
S5) (2), and the clonal architecture of each tumor
estimated (possible for 31 of 34 tumors).
Neoantigen burden was related to clinical re-
sponse to pembrolizumab, with a high neoantigen
repertoire associated with improved outcome, as
previously reported (Fig. 4A). However, consist-
ent with the importance of clonal neoantigens,
the clinical efficacy of PD-1 blockade also ap-

each ITH threshold, the upper quartile of clonal neoantigens is used to separate
tumors with high and low clonal neoantigen burden, and the neoantigen ITH
threshold further groups samples. For example, an ITH threshold = 0 involves

 (Y2087 and SB10944). For example, despite a large
neoantigen burden, ZA6505 exhibited progressive
disease, relapsing after 2 months. ZA6505 was
one of the most heterogeneous tumors within
the cohort, with over 80% of mutations classified
as subclonal.
Tumors with both a high clonal neoantigen
burden and low neoantigen ITH were associated
with significantly longer progression-free survi-
val, and this relationship remained robust to the
choice of ITH threshold, with lower hazard ratios
observed as compared with the use of neo-
antigen burden alone (Fig. 4B). The majority of
clonal neoantigens could be attributed to smoking-
induced mutations (Fig. 4A). Greater PD-L1 ex-
pression was observed in tumors harboring a
large clonal neoantigen burden and low neo-
antigen heterogeneity compared with the remain-
ing tumors (P = 0.0017, c2 test) (Fig. 4A and fig. S6).
Next, we obtained data from 64 melanoma
patients treated with either ipilimumab or tre-
melimumab, which are antibodies against CTLA-
4 (4). Clonal architecture analysis was possible
for 57 of 64 tumors, and significantly improved
overall survival was observed in tumors exhib-
iting a low neoantigen ITH and a high clonal
neoantigen burden. This relationship was ob-
served when multiple different ITH thresholds
were used, similar to the NSCLC cohort (ITH
threshold = 0.01, P = 0.008; ITH threshold =
0.02, P = 0.011; ITH threshold = 0.05, P = 0.083)
(Fig. 4C). The relationship between neoantigen
burden and survival outcome was not statis-
tically significant without an ITH threshold (P =
0.083) (Fig. 4C).
To address whether radiation or cytotoxic ex-
posure might stimulate production of subclonal
neoantigens that could contribute to total neo-
antigen burden but not the efficacy of checkpoint
blockade, sequencing data from a more heavily
pretreated melanoma cohort, comprising 110 tu-
mors, were obtained (17). For the subset of tumors
for which clonal analysis was possible (78 of 110
tumors, a smaller and less adequately powered
cohort as compared with the published analysis),
total neoantigen burden was not significantly
associated with efficacy of immune checkpoint
inhibition [classified as in (17)], although a trend
was observed (P = 0.24, Wilcoxon rank sum test)
(fig. S7A). However, an enrichment for tumors
exhibiting high neoantigen heterogeneity or low
clonal neoantigen burden (both stratified accord-
ing to the median of the cohort) reached bor-
derline significance in patients with minimal or
no benefit compared with patients exhibiting a
clinical benefit (P = 0.06, Fisher’s exact test).
Neoantigen burden was not found to be signif-
icantly associated with overall survival in this
cohort (fig. S7B). Two of the most heterogeneous
tumors (Pat58 and Pat151) with minimal or no
benefit were among those treated with the al-
kylating agent dacarbazine (DTIC) before anti-
CTLA therapy, and for both, >98% of subclonal
mutations were attributable to mutational Sig-
nature 11, a signature associated with prior
exposure to alkylating agents (18, 19). One pa-
tient with stable disease—Pat80, who was also
treated with DTIC before anti–CTLA-4 therapy—
also harbored an increase in Signature 11 and
progressed by 6 months [classified as no durable
benefit according to (2)]. These data suggest that
therapy may induce subclonal mutations that
fail to drive an efficient antitumor response, al-
though further data are needed to confirm this
observation.

 Last, we reasoned that T cells recognizing clo-
nal antigens should be detectable in patients
deriving favorable responses to checkpoint block-
ade. Previous analysis of peripheral blood lym-
phocytes (PBLs) from CA9903, a LUAD patient
with an exceptional response to pembrolizumab,
identified a CD8+ T cell population in autologous
PBLs, recognizing a predicted neoantigen result-
ing from a HERC1P3278S mutation (ASNASSAAK)
(2). Consistent with the relevance of clonal neo-
antigens, this mutation was found to be present
in 100% of cancer cells within the sequenced tu-
mor (Fig. 4D). Similarly, analysis of peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the pa-
tients with CR9309 and CR0095—melanomas that
responded to anti-CTLA-4 therapy, resulting in
prolonged patient survival—identified CD8+ T cell
populations, recognizing tumor-specific neoanti-
gens (4). In both cases, the neoantigens linked to
a T cell response were derived from clonal muta-
tions, predicted to be present in 100% of cancer
cells (Fig. 4, E and F).
Previous studies have reported that neoanti-
gen burden influences sensitivity to immune
checkpoint blockade in NSCLC and melanoma
(2, 4, 17). However, the influence of ITH on this
relationship has not been investigated. Our re-
sults, although limited by access to small and di-
verse patient cohorts and single-site biopsy data
thatlikely overestimatethe numberof clonal muta-
tions,suggestthatclonalandsubclonalneoantigens
do not drive equally effective antitumor immu-
nity. Indeed, using the described approach, de-
spite screening more than 250 peptides against
putative subclonal neoantigens, we were only able
to detect T cells that recognize clonal neoantigens.
Conceivably, higher-neoantigen ITH may result
in lower antigen dosage as compared with homo-
geneous tumors with high clonal neoantigen bur-
den, thus reducing the chances of identifying
T cells reactive to subclonal neoantigens. Fur-
thermore, in cases in which T cells reactive to
subclonal neoantigens are generated, these will
be unable to target all tumor cells, limiting over-
all tumor control.
The observation that certain anti–CTLA-4
refractory tumors were enriched for subclonal
mutations caused by alkylating agents suggests
that mutations induced by therapy may en-
hance total neoantigen burden but might not
elicit an effective antitumor response, possibly
because of the subclonal nature of the neoanti-
gens that results from cytotoxic exposure. These
results highlight the need to consider both the
antitumor effects of alkylating agents as well
as the potential risk of inducing subclonal mu-
tations (19).
The identification of cytotoxic tumor-infiltrating
T cells that recognize clonal mutations, shared by
all tumor cells, might hold promise for adoptive
therapy strategies to address the challenges of
ITH (20). The extensive clonal mutational reper-
toire present in smoking-associated NSCLC (8, 21)
could render this disease vulnerable to vaccina-
tion or T cell therapies targeting multiple clonal
neoantigens, in combination with appropriate
immune checkpoint modulation.

In eukaryotes, P-type adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases) generate the plasma
membrane potential and drive secondary transport systems; however, despite their
importance, their regulation remains poorly understood. We monitored at the single-
molecule level the activity of the prototypic proton-pumping P-type ATPase Arabidopsis
thaliana isoform 2 (AHA2). Our measurements, combined with a physical nonequilibrium
model of vesicle acidification, revealed that pumping is stochastically interrupted by long-
lived (~100 seconds) inactive or leaky states. Allosteric regulation by pH gradients
modulated the switch between these states but not the pumping or leakage rates. The
autoinhibitory regulatory domain of AHA2 reduced the intrinsic pumping rates but
increased the dwell time in the active pumping state. We anticipate that similar functional
dynamics underlie the operation and regulation of many other active transporters.
E
lectrochemical gradients across cellular mem-
branes control many essential biological pro-
cesses. These gradients are generated by
primary active transporters and are used to
drive the exchange of other solutes through
secondary active transporters and to facilitate
signaling through ion channels (1). Patch clamp
recording has made it possible to observe the
functional dynamics of single ion channels, re-
vealing discrete on and off states, subconduc-
tance states, and other mechanistically important
features that macroscopic experiments cannot
probe (2). However, despite extensive structural
and biochemical efforts (3), we currently lack a
similar depth of understanding of transporters,
because they in general do not produce electrical-
ly detectable single-molecule transport signals
(4–8). We monitored at the single-molecule level
the functional dynamics of a eukaryotic primary
active transporter, Arabidopsis thaliana H+–
adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) isoform 2
(AHA2, referred to as the proton pump), which is
responsible for energizing the plasma membrane
of plants and fungi (figs. S1 and S2) (3, 9). This
provided insights into how the activity of P-type
ATPases is modulated by autoregulatory terminal
domains (R domains) and pH gradients (10, 11).
We used total internal reflection fluorescence
(TIRF) microscopy to image with high through-
put single nanoscopic lipid vesicles tethered to a
solid support (Fig. 1, A and B, and figs. S3 and
S4). Tethering was accomplished with a biotin/
neutravidin protocol (12), which maintains the na-
tive function and diffusivity of reconstituted trans-
membrane proteins (13) and the vesicles’ spherical
morphology (14) and low passive ion permeability
(15). The fluorescence intensity of all single vesicles
was quantitatively converted to pH (fig. S5) and
tracked over periods of up to 30 min.
Initial studies were carried out on the well-
studied activated form of AHA2, which lacks the
