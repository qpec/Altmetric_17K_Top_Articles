Abstract
Background—The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas has coincided with an 
increase in the report of birth of infants with microcephaly. On 1 February 2016, the World Health 
Organization declared the suspected link between ZIKV and microcephaly a Public Health 
Emergency of International Concern. However, to date, precise quantification of this association is 
lacking.

 Methods—We retrospectively analysed data from a ZIKV outbreak in French Polynesia in 
October 2013–April 2014, which was the largest ever documented prior to the outbreak in the 
Americas. Serological and surveillance data were used to estimate the probability of ZIKV 
infection for each week of the epidemic. We also conducted an exhaustive search of medical 
records to identify all microcephaly cases from September 2013–July 2015. Simple models were 
developed to determine the period during pregnancy when ZIKV infection may increase the risk of 
microcephaly and estimate the associated risk.
Findings—Sixty-six percent (95% CI: 62, 70) of Polynesians were infected by ZIKV. Of the 
eight microcephaly cases identified during the 23-month study period, seven (88%) occurred in the 
four-month period following the ZIKV outbreak. This pattern was best explained by a model that 
assumed ZIKV infection in the first trimester of pregnancy increased the risk of microcephaly. In 
this model, the risk of microcephaly associated with ZIKV infection was 95 (95 CI: 34, 191) per 
10,000 women infected in the first trimester of pregnancy while the prevalence of microcephaly 
was 2 (95% CI: 0, 8) per 10,000 neonates. Models where the risk of microcephaly also increased if 
infection occurred in trimesters 2 and 3 were not significantly worse fitting than this model.
Interpretation—This study provides the first quantitative estimate of the risk of microcephaly in 
a foetus/neonate whose mother was infected by ZIKV.

Introduction
Since the first case of Zika virus (ZIKV) disease was identified in Brazil in May 2015, 
ZIKV, an arthropod-borne virus in the genus of Flavivirus1, has quickly expanded in Brazil 
and throughout the Americas. As of 19 February 2016, 28 countries of the region have 
reported cases2. Although ZIKV infection often leads to mild disease, the emergence of 
ZIKV in the Americas has coincided with a steep increase in Guillain-Barré syndrome, an 
autoimmune disease causing acute or subacute flaccid paralysis, and the birth of infants with 
neurological complications such as congenital microcephaly3–5.
Congenital microcephaly is a neurologic abnormality, present at birth, which is defined as an 
head circumference < −2 standard deviations (SD) below the mean for sex, age and 
ethnicity6. The term “severe” microcephaly is used for a head circumference < −3 SD7. 
Microcephaly can either be isolated or combined with other abnormalities. Microcephaly is 
associated with a reduction in brain volume and often, intellectual and/or motor disabilities 
including: speech impairment8, poor neurocognitive outcome9 or behavioural issues10. 
Causes include genetic11 or environmental factors12 that can impact brain development13, 
such as prenatal viral infections like rubella or cytomegalovirus14, maternal alcohol use15 
and hypertensive disorders during pregnancy16. Cases have also been reported following 
intra-uterine infections with West Nile17, another flavivirus, and chikungunya18 virus.
On 1 February 2016, the World Health Organization declared the suspected link between 
ZIKV and microcephaly a Public Health Emergency of International Concern19. To reduce 
the risk of microcephaly, a number of recommendations have been made to pregnant women 
and women of childbearing age including to avoid travelling to affected countries, to use 
condom with partners returning from affected countries or to delay pregnancy20,21.

 Assessments are also ongoing to determine the level of monitoring that is required for 
pregnant women during ZIKV epidemics. In this crisis, clinical management of pregnant 
women, individual decisions regarding family planning and the response of the broader 
Public Health community need to be informed by precise estimates of the risk of 
microcephaly in a foetus/neonate whose mother has been infected by ZIKV. However, 
although there is growing evidence that ZIKV can cause microcephaly22,23, to date, a 
quantification of the association between ZIKV and microcephaly is lacking.
A timely assessment of this association may prove difficult from data gathered in an ongoing 
epidemic such as in the Americas. First, delays may occur between infection of a mother and 
diagnosis of microcephaly in her foetus/neonate. It may therefore take time before all cases 
of microcephaly potentially associated with ZIKV are reported. Second, surveillance 
systems only detect a small proportion of ZIKV infections24 and the true number of 
pregnant women that have been infected by ZIKV is therefore unknown. The total number 
of infections can be estimated by serological cross-sectional surveys only once an epidemic 
is over. This means there are important uncertainties about both the numerator and the 
denominator required to calculate the risk of microcephaly per infected pregnant woman.
Here, from the retrospective analysis of a large ZIKV outbreak that took place in French 
Polynesia25 in October 2013–April 2014, we test and characterize the strength and nature of 
the association between ZIKV and microcephaly. In particular, we evaluate the risk of 
microcephaly in a foetus/neonate whose mother has been infected by ZIKV. The French 
Polynesian outbreak presents a number of interesting properties to support such an 
assessment. First, it is the largest ZIKV outbreak ever documented prior to the current 
outbreak in the Americas. Second, French Polynesia has a strong infrastructure for the 
surveillance of infectious diseases and the detection of complications during pregnancy. 
Third, sufficient time has elapsed since the end of the outbreak for all cases of microcephaly 
potentially associated with ZIKV to be detected. Finally, serological data, which are 
necessary to estimate the number of pregnant women that were infected during the epidemic, 
are available26,27.
Methods
Our assessment was based on the joint analysis of four datasets that document i) all cases of 
microcephaly in French Polynesia in the study period (September 1st 2013 – July 31st 2015), 
ii) the weekly number of consultations for suspected ZIKV infection, iii) seroprevalence for 
ZIKV antibodies at the start and end of the epidemic and iv) the number of births in French 
Polynesia.
The general principles of the analysis are as follows. The serological study informs on the 
overall proportion of persons infected during the epidemic while the epidemic curve 
indicates the weeks when these people were likely to have been infected. From these two 
datasets, it is possible to estimate the probability of infection for each week of the epidemic. 
For a cohort of women whose pregnancy started for example on week 45 of 2013, it is then 
possible to calculate the expected proportion that were infected by ZIKV during the first, 
second or third trimester of their pregnancies. With this information, we can estimate

 expected trends in microcephaly for different scenarios about the ‘period of risk’ during 
pregnancy when infection of the mother by ZIKV may increase the risk of microcephaly for 
her foetus/neonate. We ascertain which scenarios are most likely by comparing predicted 
trends with the observed timing of microcephaly cases.
Further details on the data and the analytical framework are provided below and in the 
Supplementary Material.
Microcephaly data
For the study period, we retrospectively identified all complications that satisfied the 
following case definition: infants or foetuses whose head circumference was measured 
below two standard deviations from normal head circumference adjusted for gestational age 
and sex. To constitute this dataset, we performed an exhaustive search of medical records of 
patients who had been referred to the only prenatal diagnosis specialist centre of the 
territory. Other cases were exhaustively looked for in hospital discharge data (Programme de 
Médicalisation des Systèmes d’Information) from neonatology ward records. All suspected 
cases of microcephaly during the study period were reviewed by a group of specialists (MB, 
PGA, DEG, VA, CG) to identify those retained for the analysis. A description of standard 
follow up of pregnancies is provided in Supplementary Material.
Surveillance data
Weekly numbers of patient consultations for suspected ZIKV infection were estimated by 
the local sentinel surveillance system, which has existed since 2005. In normal situations out 
of epidemic periods, the system relies on 20 sentinel general practitioner (GP) sites. 
However, capacity can be expanded during epidemics. During the ZIKV outbreak of 2013–
2014, an average of 50 sentinel sites, covering 30% of all GPs in the territory, reported each 
week to the system. The number of consultations for the whole territory was extrapolated 
from the number of consultations for sentinel sites. The case definition of a suspected ZIKV 
infection is a patient presenting with a rash and/or fever above 38.5°C, associated with at 
least two of the following symptoms: conjunctivitis, joint pain and/or muscle pain and limbs 
oedema. Laboratory confirmation by RT-PCR was obtained for 4.4% of suspected cases.
Serological data
We used data from three serological studies conducted in French Polynesia on: i) 593 
Polynesians aged 18–79 years from Tahiti (the largest island in the territory) who donated 
blood between July 2011 and October 2013, i.e. prior to the epidemic27, ii) 196 persons 
from the general population aged 7–86 (median: 41) years residing in five of the most 
inhabited islands, between February and March 2014, i.e. in the second half of the 
epidemic26 and iii) 476 children from Tahiti aged 6–16 (median: 11) years, between May 
and June 2014, i.e. after the end of the epidemic26. In each of the three studies, serum 
samples were tested for evidence of historic ZIKV exposure using indirect IgG ELISAs27.
Demographic data
The annual reported number of births in French Polynesia is 4,182 (for 2013–2014) for a 
population of 270,000 (December 2013)28.

 Statistical analysis
We developed a simple mathematical/statistical model to characterize the association 
between ZIKV and microcephaly. In the model, we assumed that there is a ‘period of risk’ 
during pregnancy when infection of the mother by ZIKV may increase the risk of 
microcephaly for her foetus/neonate: the risk of microcephaly was therefore ρ0 + ρZ if the 
mother was infected by ZIKV during the ‘period of risk’ and ρ0 otherwise (baseline). Six 
possible ‘periods of risk’ were considered: trimester 1; trimesters 1 & 2; trimesters 1, 2 & 3; 
trimester 2; trimesters 2 & 3; trimester 3. In addition, a scenario with ‘no association’ (i.e. 
no ‘period of risk’) was also considered.
We followed the cohort of nS women who started a pregnancy on week wS. Assuming that 
the birth rate was constant during the study period, we defined nS = 4,182 / 52 = 80.4. The 
probability pI (wI) that these women got infected by ZIKV on week wI was assumed to be 
proportional to the number IwI of consultations for suspected ZIKV infection in that week: 
 where parameter γ was the final attack rate. In our baseline scenario, the 
final attack rate γ was estimated from the third serological study, i.e. the one performed after 
the end of the epidemic.
Once we reconstructed temporal trends in ZIKV infection, we were able to use the model to 
predict trends in microcephaly under the different scenarios about the ‘period of risk’. This 
also required modelling the duration of pregnancy for microcephaly cases (Figure S1).
For each model variant, maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters were obtained 
with a simulated annealing algorithm29. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (95% CI) 
were derived with the likelihood ratio method30. A likelihood ratio test was used to compare 
models with a ‘period of risk’ with the ‘no association’ model. Otherwise, the Akaike 
Information Criterion with a correction for small sample size (AICc) was used31. The best 
fitting model is the one with the smallest AICc. A difference dAICc ≥4 was considered as 
indicative of a considerable improvement in model fit31.
In a sensitivity analysis, we also explored scenarios where the final attack rate was 50%, 
60%, 70% and 80% and where the weekly number of births was 60 or 100. We also fitted a 
saturated model where the risk of microcephaly was estimated for each trimester of 
pregnancy.
Technical details are provided in the Supplementary Material. Data used to fit the 
mathematical model are available as Supplementary Material. Box 1 summarises key 
modelling assumptions.

 Results
Zika epidemic in French Polynesia
The outbreak began in October 2013 (week 41), peaked in December 2013 and was over in 
April 2014 (Figure 1A). By the end of the outbreak, public health officials had recorded 
8,750 suspected cases of ZIKV infections of which 383 were laboratory confirmed by 
molecular testing (RT-PCR). It was estimated that more than 31,000 patients consulted for 
suspected ZIKV infection during this outbreak32 (Figure 1A).
Prior to this outbreak, ZIKV seroprevalence was 0.8%27. It increased to 50% (95% CI 43%, 
56%; 97/196) by the second half of the outbreak26 and reached 66% (95% CI: 62, 70; 
314/476) after the end of the outbreak26 (Figure 2A).
Cases of microcephaly in the study period
Eight cases of microcephaly satisfying our case definition were identified during the study 
period (Table 1). Five cases were pregnancies which had been terminated through medical 
abortion, while three children were born. Median gestational age among foetuses whose 
pregnancies had been terminated following diagnosis of microcephaly was at 30.1 weeks 
(IQR: 26.1–31.4). Normal foetal karyotype was obtained among six infants and was not 
available for the two others.
Association between ZIKV and microcephaly
Of the eight microcephaly cases detected during the 23-month study period, seven (88%) 
were identified in a four-month time period (1 March – 10 July 2014) that immediately 
followed the ZIKV outbreak (Figure 1A).
Of the six models with a ‘period of risk’ during pregnancy, four explained the observed 
pattern significantly better than the ‘no association’ model (p-value in the range: 0.0007–
0.0172) (Table 2). The two models that did not perform significantly better than the ‘no 
association’ model assumed the ‘period of risk’ was restricted to trimester 3 only or to 
trimester 2 and 3.
Three models provided satisfying fits to the data (Figure 1B) and had relatively similar 
model comparison criteria AICc (Table 2). The common feature for these models was that 
they all included trimester 1 in the ‘period of risk’. The best fitting model was the one where 
the ‘period of risk’ was restricted to trimester 1. In this model, the risk of microcephaly 
associated with ZIKV infection was 95 (95 CI: 34, 191) per 10,000 women infected in the 
first trimester of pregnancy while the prevalence of microcephaly was 2 (95% CI: 0, 8) per 
10,000 neonates, consistent with previous estimates from Europe (1.9 per 10,000)33 and 
Brazil (2 per 10,000)34. This corresponds to a risk ratio of 53.4 (95% CI: 6.5, 1061.2). Two 
other models could not be ruled out. They had the following ‘periods of risk’: i) trimesters 1 
and 2 with a risk of microcephaly of 50 (95% CI: 17, 101) per 10,000 women infected in 
trimester 1 or 2; ii) trimesters 1, 2 and 3 with a risk of microcephaly of 42 (95% CI: 13, 86) 
per 10,000 women infected in trimester 1, 2 or 3. Models that assumed trimester 1 was not in 
the ‘period of risk’ were not supported by the data (Figure 1B, Table 2).

 Sensitivity analysis
Estimates in Table 2 were obtained under the assumptions that ZIKV final attack rates in 
women of childbearing age were similar to the 66% rate observed in children26 and that 
there were 80 births per week28. We explored sensitivity of our estimates to these 
assumptions. For the various scenarios we considered and irrespective of the ‘period of risk’, 
the relative change in estimates was between −20% (attack rate of 80%, birth rate of 100 per 
week) and +33% (attack rate of 50%, birth rate of 60 per week) (Table 3). This means that 
for the best fitting model where the ‘period of risk’ is restricted to trimester 1, the estimated 
risk of microcephaly associated with ZIKV infection remains between 80–130 per 10,000 
women infected in the first trimester of pregnancy. Analysis of the saturated model where 
the risk of microcephaly was estimated per trimester provided further support for our best 
fitting model (Table S1).
Discussion
The large outbreak of ZIKV that took place in French Polynesia in 2013–2014 offers a 
unique opportunity to better quantify and characterize the association between ZIKV and 
microcephaly. Of the eight cases of microcephaly that were reported during our 23-month 
study period, seven occurred in the four-month period that immediately followed the ZIKV 
outbreak. Such temporal clustering of cases gives strong support to the proposed association 
between ZIKV and microcephaly. To make a more nuanced assessment of this association, 
we developed mathematical models that predicted temporal trends in microcephaly under 
different scenarios about the link with ZIKV. Key conclusions of this analysis are threefold. 
First, models that assumed that infection of the mother increased the risk of microcephaly 
explained observed patterns significantly better than the ‘no association’ model. Second, in 
the best fitting models, the ‘period of risk’ during which ZIKV infection resulted in an 
increased risk of microcephaly always included the first trimester of pregnancy and the best 
fit was obtained when the ‘period of risk’ was restricted to this trimester. Third, thanks to the 
availability of serological data, we were able to estimate the risk of microcephaly per 
infected pregnant woman.
We estimated that the risk of microcephaly was about 1% if the mother was infected by 
ZIKV in the first trimester of pregnancy. This risk may seem low compared to other viral 
infections associated to birth defects. For example, 13% of primary cytomegalovirus 
infections in pregnancy result in symptomatic congenital disease of the newborn36; the risk 
of congenital rubella syndrome ranges between 38% and 100% if the mother is infected 
during the first trimester of pregnancy37; global adverse foetal outcomes occur for 10% of 
pregnant women infected by parvovirus B19. However, a major difference between ZIKV 
and these infections is that the incidence of ZIKV can be very high during outbreaks (e.g. 
66% of the population in French Polynesia26 and 73% on the island of Yap24). This contrasts 
with estimates for cytomegalovirus (1–4% in pregnant women)38, rubella (<10 cases in 
pregnant women per year in France)39 or parvovirus B19 (0.61–1.24% in women of 
childbearing age)40. So, although ZIKV infection is associated with a relatively low foetal 
risk, the fact that it can infect a substantial proportion of a population makes it an important 
source of concern for public health. These findings highlight the need to protect pregnant

 women or women trying to become pregnant from infection with ZIKV. As there is no 
treatment currently available for ZIKV and development of a vaccine will take time, these 
women should protect themselves from mosquitos in affected countries and avoid travel to 
these countries if they can.
Our analysis provides strong support for the hypothesis that infection in the first trimester of 
pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of microcephaly. Such pattern of risk has also 
been observed for other intra-uterine viral infections like rubella or cytomegalovirus, where 
infections during the first trimester or early second trimester are associated with brain 
damage35. Larger datasets will be required to determine whether infection in the remainder 
of the pregnancy also increases the risk of microcephaly. It will also be important to 
determine if the risk of microcephaly varies with the severity of clinical symptoms in the 
infected mother.
Four datasets that informed on different aspects of this epidemic were used in our analysis. 
The first one consisted of an exhaustive search of all microcephaly cases in French Polynesia 
during the study period. We restricted our analysis to cases that satisfied a strict case 
definition for microcephaly for two reasons. First, the WHO Public Health Emergency of 
International Concern focused on microcephaly and we therefore felt this concern should be 
addressed first. Second, the lack of standardised case definition for microcephaly has been 
identified as an important source of confusion in this epidemic43,44 which may have led to 
overestimating the number of microcephaly cases in South America44. To ensure the quality 
of the diagnostics, a group of five specialists reviewed all potential cases and made final 
decision on the ones to be retained in the analysis. While our analysis was restricted to the 
link between ZIKV and microcephaly, it will be important to ascertain whether ZIKV may 
generate other neurological complications. Other types of complications have for example 
been reported in French Polynesia although the link with ZIKV has yet to be established4. 
This should be the subject of further investigations in French Polynesia and elsewhere.
The second dataset consisted of data from syndromic Sentinel surveillance, which suffer 
from a number of limitations. For example, they typically only detect a small proportion of 
infections. However, this should not affect our analysis because we only used them to 
determine the timing of the epidemic not the size of the epidemic. This was done by 
assuming that the proportion of infections occurring on a given week was proportional to the 
number of consultations for suspected ZIKV infection reported on that week. This 
assumption might be violated if propensity to consult for ZIKV symptoms or reporting 
practices changed substantially during the epidemic. Such phenomenon was for example 
observed in the 2009 H1N1pdm09 influenza pandemic45.
Three seroprevalence studies were used to evaluate the final attack rate of ZIKV. These 
studies were performed in different populations with different age structures. However, there 
is little reason to expect large difference in risk between children and adults. The risk of 
ZIKV exposure in an outbreak on Yap Island was found to be similar across age groups24. In 
addition, the three estimates of seropositivity are entirely consistent with that expected over 
the course of an outbreak in a previously naïve population. Finally, the 66% estimate for the 
final attack rate is consistent with 73% (95% CI: 68%, 77%) found in the ZIKV outbreak on 
Cauchemez et al.

 Yap24. Our estimates for the risk of microcephaly were also relatively robust to large scale 
changes in the overall attack rate (Table 3). Since less than 1% of individuals tested positive 
for ZIKV before the start of the ZIKV outbreak despite high levels of dengue 
seropositivity27, cross-reaction in serological assays is unlikely to be an important issue 
here.
Our analysis also relied on the total number of documented annual birth in French Polynesia. 
French Polynesia is an overseas collectivity of the French Republic and as such population 
statistics there are of a quality relatively similar to that seen in mainland France, including 
carefully tabulated birth statistics. Since birth counts were only available on an annual basis, 
we made the assumption of a constant birth rate during the study period. In practice small 
variations in weekly number of births may be expected but estimates were relatively robust 
to such variations (Table 3). Because we were interested in assessing the risk of 
microcephaly due to ZIKV in foetuses that could have been expected to be live born in the 
absence of ZIKV, it was more appropriate to use statistics on live births than on live births 
and medical abortions, even though medical abortion was performed for a substantial 
proportion of our microcephaly cases.
One needs to be cautious when using data from the ZIKV outbreak in French Polynesia to 
make extrapolations for other settings. First, the spread of an arbovirus like ZIKV is affected 
by entomological, environmental and climatic factors so that attack rates in other ZIKV 
outbreaks may be different than what was observed in French Polynesia. Second, we cannot 
exclude the possibility that the risk of microcephaly associated with ZIKV infection will 
differ in other populations due to genetic factors.
Much more epidemiologic and experimental research needs to be done to evaluate and 
understand the role of ZIKV infection in congenital abnormalities such as microcephaly. 
Research must be undertaken to determine the causal link between ZIKV infection and 
microcephaly. Experimental studies investigating maternal-foetal transmission should be a 
priority. In addition, affected and at risk countries should establish cohorts of pregnant 
women to be followed and tested throughout their pregnancy46. With growing number of 
countries affected by the current outbreak, a minimum level of standardization across these 
cohort studies is required. Our study was retrospective in nature but prospective studies 
evaluating the link between ZIKV and microcephaly are urgently needed. Groups like 
ISARIC47 and CONSISE48 are working with affected countries, WHO, USCDC and others 
to generate these protocols rapidly.
This study provides strong statistical support for the suspected association between ZIKV 
and microcephaly and estimates that the risk of microcephaly increases to about 1% if a 
mother has been infected by ZIKV during the first trimester of pregnancy. The study 
therefore emphasizes the need for a strong and prompt response to protect, inform and 
monitor this at-risk population as well as the need for a strong research agenda to better 
understand the causal link between ZIKV and microcephaly and to develop effective 
treatments and vaccines against ZIKV.

Modelling assumptions
Our estimates of the risk of microcephaly associated with ZIKV infection rely on 
following assumptions:
•
There is a ‘period of risk’ during pregnancy when ZIKV infection of the 
mother may increase the risk of microcephaly for her foetus/neonate.
•
All microcephaly cases in the study period have been identified.
•
The number of ZIKV infections in a given week is proportional to the 
number of consultations for suspected ZIKV infection on that week.
•
The proportion of women of childbearing age infected by ZIKV during the 
epidemic is similar to the proportion of children who seroconverted 
(estimated in a serological study).
•
The birth rate is constant during the study period and can be estimated from 
official statistics.

 Research in context
Evidence before this study
Microcephaly is a condition defined by a measured head circumference below two 
standard deviations from normal head circumference. Its incidence is estimated between 
5.8 per 100,000 live births in the USA and 18.7 per 100,000 live or stillborn births and 
medical abortions in Europe. Long term outcome of this condition is heterogeneous and 
has been associated with several neurologic conditions such as epilepsy or intellectual 
deficiencies. Following current ZIKV epidemic in South America, an outbreak of 
microcephaly among newborns has been reported in several countries, conducting World 
Health Organization to declare ZIKV outbreak an international Public Health Emergency. 
However, the association between ZIKV and microcephaly remains to be quantified.
Added value of this study
From the retrospective analysis of a large ZIKV outbreak that took place in French 
Polynesia in 2013–2014, we were able to: 1) provide strong statistical support for the 
association between ZIKV infection and microcephaly; 2) establish that the period of risk 
(i.e. period in pregnancy when ZIKV infection of the mother leads to an increased risk of 
microcephaly in the foetus/neonate) was likely to contain the first trimester of pregnancy 
but may also include the second and third trimester; 3) estimate that the risk of 
microcephaly associated with ZIKV infection was 95 (95% CI: 34, 191) per 10,000 
women infected by ZIKV in the first trimester.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our work provides strong statistical support for the previously suspected link between 
ZIKV infection during pregnancy and microcephaly. Hence, it emphasises the need for 
health authorities of affected countries to organise foetal monitoring, promote vector 
control and provide evidence-driven information for pregnant women.

the foetus/neonate. Dots indicate the median date while horizontal lines show the 15% and

Sensitivity of the estimated risk of microcephaly associated with ZIKV infection to 
modelling assumptions
The table gives the number of microcephaly per 10,000 women infected during the assumed ‘period of risk’, 
for different assumptions about final attack rates and birth rates. Our baseline scenario (in bold) corresponds to 
a final attack rate of 66% based on a serological study performed after the end of the epidemic26 and 80.4 
births per week based on official statistics28. The change relative to the baseline scenario is also indicated.
