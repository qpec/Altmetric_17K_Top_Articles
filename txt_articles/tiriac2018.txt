Abstract  
70 
 
71 
Pancreatic cancer is the most lethal common solid malignancy. Systemic therapies are often ineffective 
72 
and predictive biomarkers to guide treatment are urgently needed. We generated a pancreatic cancer 
73 
patient-derived organoid (PDO) library that recapitulates the mutational spectrum and transcriptional 
74 
subtypes of primary pancreatic cancer. New driver oncogenes were nominated and transcriptomic 
75 
analyses revealed unique clusters. PDOs exhibited heterogeneous responses to standard-of-care 
76 
chemotherapeutics and investigational agents. In a case study manner, we find that PDO therapeutic 
77 
profiles paralleled patient outcomes and that PDOs enable longitudinal assessment of chemo-sensitivity 
78 
and evaluation of synchronous metastases. We derived organoid-based gene expression signatures of 
79 
chemo-sensitivity that predicted improved responses for many patients to chemotherapy in both the 
80 
adjuvant and advanced disease settings. Finally, we nominated alternative treatment strategies for chemo-
81 
refractory PDOs using targeted agent therapeutic profiling. We propose that combined molecular and 
82 
therapeutic profiling of PDOs may predict clinical response and enable prospective therapeutic selection.  
83

Statement of significance  
85 
 
86 
New approaches to prioritize treatment strategies are urgently needed to improve survival and quality of life 
87 
for pancreatic cancer patients. Combined genomic, transcriptomic, and therapeutic profiling of patient-
88 
derived organoids can identify molecular and functional subtypes of pancreatic cancer, predict therapeutic 
89 
responses and facilitate precision medicine for pancreatic cancer patients.

Introduction  
91 
 
92 
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly malignancy often diagnosed at advanced stages. 
93 
15 – 30% of PDAC patients are diagnosed with clinically localized disease that is amenable to potentially 
94 
curative surgical resection (1, 2). Following surgical resection, the majority of patients will have local or 
95 
distant recurrence (3) and succumb to the disease. Systemic treatment, in the form of neoadjuvant or 
96 
adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy, is used in conjunction with oncologic resection but only adds a modest 
97 
benefit in survival (4, 5). Most patients are not surgical candidates and are diagnosed with locally advanced 
98 
or metastatic disease. Therapeutic options for these patients include the combination chemotherapy 
99 
regimens Gemcitabine/nab-Paclitaxel (6) or FOLFIRINOX (5-Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, Irinotecan, 
100 
Oxaliplatin) (7). Despite therapeutic intervention, median overall survival is 6.7 – 11.1 months (Progression 
101 
Free Survival/PFS = 3.3 – 6.4) for advanced disease (6, 7), compared to 25 – 28 months (PFS = 13.1 – 
102 
13.9) in surgically resected patients (4). Many PDAC patients have chemo-refractory disease, but a smaller 
103 
subset exhibits significant response to chemotherapy. Current therapeutic selection for both local and 
104 
metastatic pancreatic cancer patients is often based on patient performance status and co-morbidities. 
105 
Altogether, this highlights the unmet clinical need to define responsive subgroups to inform treatment 
106 
selection and to nominate alternative treatment options for patients who are resistant to currently approved 
107 
treatment regimens. Therefore, approaches that predict the most effective chemotherapeutic regimen 
108 
should improve patient care. To date, PDAC driver mutations have been hard to target in the clinical 
109 
setting, with the exception of microsatellite instability (8), BRCA2 mutations (9) and potentially targetable, 
110 
uncommon KRASG12C mutations (10). Furthermore, there are a considerable number of patients without 
111 
these particular genetic alterations that would still benefit from alternative treatment strategies. 
112 
 
113 
PDAC molecular subtypes have been described and validated in several independent patient cohorts (11-
114 
13). By growing consensus, two major subtypes of PDAC exist. The Basal-like, Squamous or Quasi-
115 
mesenchymal, subtype identifies PDAC patients with poor prognosis and is characterized by basal markers 
116 
such as cytokeratins. The Classical or Pancreatic Progenitor subtype is characterized by differentiated 
117 
ductal markers and identifies patients with a better prognosis. Moffitt and colleagues (13) found that the 
118 
Classical subtype of PDAC is significantly under-represented in current PDAC cell culture models. 
119 
Additional subtypes including Aberrantly Differentiated Endocrine Exocrine (ADEX) and Immunogenic 
120 
subtypes have been reported (11), but The Cancer Genome Atlas pancreas cancer project recently 
121 
demonstrated their association with tumors exhibiting low neoplastic cellularity, suggesting that stroma and 
122 
normal pancreas contribute markedly to these subtype signatures (14). Regardless of the subtype, the low 
123 
neoplastic cellularity of primary tumors makes it difficult to access molecular details regarding a particular 
124 
profile of genetic alterations and gene expression changes in the neoplastic compartment.  
125 
 
126 
Until recently, the phenotypic study of early and late PDAC has been hampered by a lack of tractable 
127 
patient-derived models that encompass the full spectrum of disease, which would enable rapid evaluation 
128 
of predictive biomarkers of treatment response. Using advances in organoid culture technology, we 
129 
established the methodology to culture PDAC patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from both surgical 
130 
resection specimens as well as fine needle biopsies (FNB) with a high success rate (15, 16). These 
131 
cultures exhibit mutation allele frequencies indicative of pure neoplastic cultures. Seino and colleagues 
132 
have generated and characterized a library of 39 PDO cultures (17), which recapitulate the expected DNA 
133 
signature of PDAC and exhibit a differential Wnt dependence that was inversely correlated with the 
134 
Classical subtype. However, the utility of pancreatic cancer PDO cultures for defining predictive biomarkers 
135 
of treatment response remains to be explored.  
136 
 
137 
Herein we describe a library of 66 PDO cultures obtained from fine needle biopsy, surgical resection, and 
138 
rapid autopsy PDAC specimens collected from multiple clinical institutions. Using deep molecular 
139 
characterization of the PDO genome and transcriptome, we identify the expected hallmarks of PDAC. In 
140 
addition, we find high concordance between the primary tumor and paired PDO samples when sufficient 
141 
neoplastic cellularity was observed in the patient specimen. We establish a PDAC-specific PDO drug-
142 
testing pipeline, termed “pharmacotyping”, and demonstrate that drug sensitivity profiles can be generated 
143 
for each PDO within a clinically meaningful timeframe. In a retrospective analysis of a small subset of 
144 
advanced PDAC patients from whom the PDOs were generated, the PDO chemotherapy sensitivity profile

reflected patient response to therapy. These studies suggest that drug testing in PDO cultures may be 
146 
used to inform treatment selection. In addition, longitudinal sampling in a single patient predicted 
147 
acquisition of resistance to chemotherapy that paralleled clinical disease progression. Furthermore, several 
148 
PDO cultures resistant to all available chemotherapeutic options exhibited exceptional sensitivity to 
149 
targeted agents, providing alternative treatment options for chemo-refractory disease. Finally, to identify 
150 
patients most likely to benefit from chemotherapy, we generated PDO-derived gene signatures predictive 
151 
of chemotherapy sensitivity. We demonstrate that these chemo-sensitivity signatures can retrospectively 
152 
identify large groups of PDAC patients who are more likely to respond to several chemotherapeutics in 
153 
either the adjuvant or advanced disease settings. These chemo-sensitivity signatures may enable more 
154 
rapid treatment stratification of PDAC patients into those that may benefit from currently available 
155 
chemotherapeutic interventions and those that should instead be considered for rationally targeted and 
156 
investigational agents.

Assembling a pancreatic cancer patient-derived organoid library 
160 
 
161 
Previously, tumor models of patients with metastatic PDAC were often difficult to generate because of the 
162 
limited material available from diagnostic biopsies. To comprehensively model the full clinical spectrum of 
163 
PDAC, we obtained 159 human samples from primary tumors (hT) and metastases (hM) in 138 patients for 
164 
PDO generation (15, 17) (Figure S1). Seventy-eight (78) specimens were isolated from surgical 
165 
resections, 60 from fine needle biopsies of primary or metastatic lesions (hF), 20 from metastatic disease 
166 
following rapid autopsies and 1 from a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) resection of a lung 
167 
metastasis. Organoid culture conditions do not enable the survival or outgrowth of non-epithelial cells (15). 
168 
We successfully generated PDO cultures that expanded for at least 5 passages. Using these metrics, the 
169 
PDO generation efficiency was 75% (72% for fine needle biopsies - hF, 78% for tumor resections - hT), 
170 
resulting in a total of 114 PDO cultures from 101 patients (73% of patients) (Figure 1A). As previously 
171 
reported by Seino and colleagues, addition of serum to the culture media was detrimental to the isolation 
172 
and propagation efficiency (17). The pancreatic cancer PDOs exhibited mixed morphology consisting of 
173 
hollow epithelial lined cystic structures with differing degrees of filled lumens (Figure 1B). In parallel, 11 
174 
human normal (hN) pancreatic ductal organoids were established from heathy normal pancreata obtained 
175 
from islet transplant centers (15, 17) (Table S1A), all of which exhibited a hollow epithelial cystic 
176 
architecture. 
177 
 
178 
Patient-derived organoids recapitulate genetic hallmarks of pancreatic cancer and reveal new 
179 
characteristics 
180 
 
181 
We developed a precision medicine pipeline that first focuses on molecular characterization of the PDO 
182 
library as the organoid cultures pass quality control criteria (Figure S1). The criteria to be classified as a 
183 
confirmed tumor PDO culture required the presence of known pathogenic mutations. Eighty-eight (88) PDO 
184 
cultures have thus far been subjected to Sanger (KRAS only) or whole exome sequencing (WES), and 69 
185 
(78%) of the PDO cultures harbored genetic alterations consistent with PDAC (Figures 1C-D, S1, Table 
186 
S1A-D). Nineteen (19, 22%) PDOs exhibited diploid genomes without discernable genetic hallmarks of 
187 
pancreatic cancer, suggesting the outgrowth of normal ductal epithelial cells as previously reported (17), 
188 
and were not further analyzed. The 11 hN organoid cultures isolated from the exocrine compartment 
189 
obtained from normal healthy donors for islet cell transplantation were also subjected to WES and 
190 
maintained a diploid genome without bona fide pathogenic mutations (Figure 1C-D). De-identified patient 
191 
clinical data were available for the 69 confirmed PDAC PDO cultures. 12 PDAC PDO cultures were 
192 
generated from 5 pre-treated patients with metastatic disease while the remaining 57 organoids were 
193 
isolated from 55 patients who were treatment naïve at the time of PDO generation. Given that many 
194 
patients who present with resectable disease typically receive neo-adjuvant therapy prior to surgical 
195 
resection, this PDO library is a unique resource. For 66 of the PDAC patients with clinical stage data, PDO 
196 
cultures were generated from patients with stage 1 (n = 1), 2 (n = 34), 3 (n = 7) and 4 (n = 24) disease 
197 
(Table S1A).  
198 
 
199 
KRAS was mutated in 66/69 PDOs (96%), while 3/69 organoids presented with wildtype KRAS. The 
200 
expected prevalence of KRAS mutations was observed in the PDO cultures, with 31 (45%) cases exhibiting 
201 
G12V, 29 (42%) G12D, 4 (6%) G12R, 2 (3%) Q61H, and 3 (4%) wildtype KRAS. In 2 (3%) cases, multiple 
202 
KRAS mutations were detected within a single PDO culture (Table S1A), with one case exhibiting a bi-
203 
allelic KRASG12V and KRASG12R mutation (hF50) and the other (hF70) exhibiting an amplified KRAS allele 
204 
likely harboring a compound KRASG12D,G179S mutation. Of the KRAS wildtype PDO cultures, hF43 harbored 
205 
an oncogenic PIK3CAE110del allele (18), hF39 exhibited an activating MAP2K1Q58_E62del allele associated with 
206 
MEK1 inhibitor resistance (19, 20), and hT102 harbored a hyper-activating mutation of ERBB2S310F (21) 
207 
concomitant with a copy number gain of the wildtype ERBB2 allele. TP53 mutations were detected in 58/66 
208 
(88%) of the organoids subjected to WES (excluding the KRAS only Sanger Sequenced organoids) and 
209 
were concomitant with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 56/58 cases (97%) (Table S1B). In addition, we 
210 
observed a high rate of deep copy number loss (log2 < -3) or homozygous, inactivating mutation of 
211 
CDKN2A (n = 32% and 24%, respectively) and SMAD4 (n = 8% and 20%, respectively). 35% of KRAS

mutant PDO cultures exhibited inactivation of all three commonly altered PDAC tumor suppressor genes 
213 
(TP53, SMAD4, CDKN2A) while 45% exhibited inactivation of two of these tumor suppressors (Table 
214 
S1C). A small fraction (14%) of the KRAS mutant PDOs harbored inactivation of only one tumor 
215 
suppressor. 64 out of the 66 PDAC PDO cultures subjected to WES were aneuploid, while two cultures, 
216 
hT83 and hF43, maintained a largely diploid genome (Figure S2A). For these cultures, hT83 harbored a 
217 
KRASG12R and TP53 mutation, but did not exhibit TP53 LOH or inactivation of other canonical tumor 
218 
suppressor genes; whereas hF43 had features of mismatch repair deficiency, including MSH6 mutation, 
219 
complete loss of MLH1 and a frequency of insertions and deletions (per megabase) more than 8-fold 
220 
higher than the cohort mean (11.54 versus 1.303 indels/MB) (Fig. S2B) (22).  
221 
 
222 
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on a subset of PDAC-confirmed PDOs derived from 
223 
surgical resections and their matched primary tumor (bulk), and both were germline corrected using normal 
224 
tissue (n = 13) (Figure 2A, S2C). 82.49% - 99.96% (mean 97.43%) of the mutations detected in the 
225 
primary tumor specimen were also detected in the PDO culture. The four most commonly altered genes in 
226 
PDAC (KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4) were also examined for their overlap between matched primary 
227 
and PDO specimens. In 11 of the 13 cases, the PDO cultures completely recapitulated the PDAC core 
228 
mutation profile found in the patient, although in the primary tumor specimens, there were often low 
229 
numbers of reads and the mutation was not confidently called (Table S1D). The primary tumor specimens 
230 
from the two sample pairs that did not exhibit overlap had extremely low purity (<15%) and no alterations in 
231 
PDAC core genes were detected in the primary tumor specimens. High concordance of somatic mutations 
232 
was achieved between the primary tumor and PDO in most cases (6 > 80%, 11 > 59%), with more somatic 
233 
mutations detected in the PDO cultures due to the pauci-cellular nature of the primary tumors and high 
234 
neoplastic purity of the organoids. In 2 cases where there was low tumor purity (<15%), low concordance 
235 
(<10%) was observed, likely due to the limited ability to detect somatic mutations in the pauci-cellular 
236 
primary tumors compared to the increased ability to extract genetic alterations from the purely neoplastic 
237 
PDO cultures. Copy number analyses of the paired primary tumors and PDOs also showed concordance in 
238 
the primary specimen with high purity (purity > 40%, hT98) (Figure 2B), however, most primary tumor 
239 
specimens had insufficient purity to reveal copy number alterations (CNA), whereas CNA and gross 
240 
chromosomal rearrangements were readily discernable in the PDO cultures (Figures 2C, S2D, S3). In 
241 
addition to the hT PDO and primary tumor pairings, WGS with germline correction was also performed on 8 
242 
hF PDO cultures. Due to the small amount of tissue obtained from these biopsies, the entire specimen was 
243 
directed towards PDO generation such that primary tumor tissue from the hF PDO cultures was 
244 
unavailable for comparison. Complex genomic rearrangements were also observed in several of the PDO 
245 
hF cultures (Figures S3). While genetic assessment of PDAC primary tissue specimens is often 
246 
challenging due to their low neoplastic cellularity, these genomic analyses revealed the high depth and 
247 
clarity in which PDAC genetics can be evaluated in PDO cultures, providing alternative means of identifying 
248 
actionable genetic alterations in PDAC patients.  
249 
 
250 
Transcriptomic profiling and subtyping of pancreatic cancer PDO cultures 
251 
 
252 
RNA sequencing was performed on 44 PDAC-confirmed PDOs and 11 hN organoid cultures. The hN 
253 
cultures clustered separately from the PDAC PDOs in principal component analysis (Figure 3A). The 
254 
hM19A-D series of organoids were isolated from different metastatic sites of the same patient following 
255 
rapid autopsy and represent a distinct cluster relative to the other stage 4 PDO cultures. Gene set 
256 
enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the differentially expressed genes in PDAC relative to hN organoids 
257 
indicated an enrichment in MYC and E2F targets, the G2M Checkpoint, as well as pathways involved in 
258 
metabolism that include glutathione metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty 
259 
acids (Table S2). These PDO RNA sequencing data were used to identify the Classical and Basal-like 
260 
subtype signatures previously derived from bulk tissues following virtual microdissection (13) (Figure 3B). 
261 
70% of the PDO cultures are the Classical subtype (31/44) and 30% are Basal-like (13/44) - a notable 
262 
finding as there are very few available cell line models of the Classical PDAC subtype (13) (Table S3A). 
263 
Therefore, in addition to being able to efficiently culture organoids from every stage of pancreatic cancer, 
264 
including previously difficult to access metastatic disease, this culture method enables the propagation and 
265 
study of PDO cultures from both Classical and Basal-like PDAC subtypes.

The PDO transcriptomes were also independently classified using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) 
268 
clustering, revealing two stable clusters in PDAC PDO cultures (Figure 3C, S4A-B and Table S3B). 
269 
Cluster C1 was enriched for TGFβ signaling and EMT by GSEA (Figure 3D, Table S2). In contrast, Cluster 
270 
C2 exhibited enrichment for xenobiotic metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation 
271 
by GSEA. While the genes comprising the C1/C2 signatures did not overlap with those defining Basal and 
272 
Classical subtypes (1 gene overlap is MYO1A), the classifications were largely concordant with 83% of the 
273 
Basal-like PDO cultures falling in the C1 classifier and 93% of the Classical PDO cultures falling in the C2 
274 
cluster. Therefore, PDO cultures revealed unique gene expression programs that divide PDAC into two 
275 
distinct molecular classes.  
276 
 
277 
PDO pharmacotyping corresponds with individual patient treatment responses 
278 
 
279 
Therapeutic profiling or “pharmacotyping” was performed on 66 PDAC-confirmed PDOs using the five 
280 
chemotherapeutic agents most commonly used to treat PDAC patients: Gemcitabine, nab-Paclitaxel 
281 
(Paclitaxel used in PDOs), Irinotecan (SN-38, active metabolite used in PDOs), 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and 
282 
Oxaliplatin. PDO pharmacotyping revealed marked interpatient variability in the PDO response to single 
283 
chemotherapy agents as evaluated using dose response curves and the corresponding area under the 
284 
curves (AUC) (Figure 4A-E, Table S4A). The PDO culture pharmacotyping was stable over multiple 
285 
passages with minor variation only occasionally observed (Figure S5). For each chemotherapeutic agent, 
286 
we divided the PDO library into three subgroups: the least responsive (resistant, top 34% AUC), the most 
287 
responsive (sensitive, lowest 33% AUC) and those exhibiting intermediate response (middle 33% AUC). To 
288 
determine whether this subgrouping was informative for individual patients, we obtained retrospective 
289 
clinical follow-up from 9 patients with advanced PDAC who were treated with these 5 agents (Figure S6A). 
290 
Of the 6 patients with a progression-free survival (PFS) longer than the published median PFS (6, 7), 5 
291 
were treated with at least one drug to which the matched PDO culture was particularly sensitive and no 
292 
drug to which the matched PDO culture was resistant. These 6 patients had a mean PFS of 332 days 
293 
compared to the expected PFS of 180 days (6, 7). Two (2) of the 3 patients who rapidly progressed were 
294 
treated with a chemotherapeutic agent to which their PDO was markedly resistant. One of the nine patients 
295 
exhibited an outcome inconsistent with the matched PDO (hF50) pharmacotyping profile. Altogether, these 
296 
data suggest the potential relevance of this approach.  
297 
 
298 
For one patient, corresponding with PDO hF2, extensive retrospective data was available following the 
299 
generation of the PDO. The PDAC patient from which the hF2 PDO was generated was first treated with a 
300 
four-drug combination including two drugs with an intermediate PDO response profile (Oxaliplatin and 5-
301 
FU) and one drug with a resistant PDO response (Paclitaxel) (Figure S6B-C). This patient exhibited early 
302 
progression in both the primary and metastatic sites (Figure S6C) and was switched to a second line 
303 
regimen that contained two drugs to which the PDO was sensitive (Gemcitabine and SN-38). Following the 
304 
change in regimen, the patient exhibited a partial response for 388 days before adopting third and fourth 
305 
line therapeutic strategies until ultimately succumbing to disease 1,020 days following diagnosis (Figure 
306 
S6C). For this single patient case study, the retrospective clinical data paralleled the PDO chemo-
307 
sensitivity profile. 
308 
 
309 
Temporal evolution of PDO chemo-sensitivity  
310 
 
311 
In an analogous case study manner, we found that longitudinal PDO generation reflected the clinical 
312 
course for an individual patient (Figure 5A). In the hM1 series, the hM1A PDO was isolated from a VATS 
313 
resection of a lung metastasis and following resection the patient was found to respond well to both 
314 
FOLFIRINOX and Gemcitabine/nab-Paclitaxel regimens. Indeed, the hM1A PDO was sensitive to 
315 
Gemcitabine, Paclitaxel, 5-FU and Oxaliplatin and exhibited an intermediate SN-38 response within our 
316 
cohort. Approximately two years later, the patient presented with progressive disease that histologically 
317 
exhibited neuroendocrine/small cell-like characteristics. A repeat organoid culture, hM1E, was established 
318 
from a percutaneous core biopsy of a lung metastasis. The patient succumbed to the disease shortly 
319 
afterwards and a rapid autopsy was performed, leading to the generation of the final hM1F organoid. 
320 
Intriguingly, the hM1E and hM1F PDO cultures showed amplification of the KRAS allele (Figure 1D) and 
321 
were resistant to Gemcitabine, Paclitaxel, and SN-38 while hM1F gained additional resistance to

Oxaliplatin and switched to a more Basal-like subtype (Figure 3B). This case suggests the utility of 
323 
longitudinal PDO sampling following repeat biopsies to evaluate the acquisition of resistance mechanisms 
324 
to first line chemotherapeutic regimens. At the same time, this longitudinal case series revealed resistance 
325 
to all commonly used chemotherapeutics for pancreatic cancer, a common issue observed in several PDO 
326 
cultures and encountered in the clinic. 
327 
 
328 
Spatial intra-patient heterogeneity of chemo-sensitivity 
329 
 
330 
We also examined the therapeutic sensitivity of four different PDO cultures generated from two liver 
331 
(hM19A, B) and one diaphragmatic metastases (hM19C), as well as ascites (hM19D) from the same 
332 
patient following a rapid autopsy (Figure 5B). We found that these four hM19 cultures exhibited similar 
333 
therapeutic profiles to three chemotherapeutic agents, but different sensitivities to 5-FU. While these four 
334 
PDOs harbored similar DNA mutations by exomic sequencing (Figure 1C), they possessed small 
335 
differences in CNA (Figure 1D) and mRNA expression (Figure 3A-C). Whether these molecular 
336 
differences underlie this therapeutic profile heterogeneity remains to be determined, and this case 
337 
highlights the possibility that metastatic patients may possess different cancer subclones that will require 
338 
novel therapeutic regimens to achieve the best clinical response.  
339 
 
340 
Nomination of alternative treatment strategies for chemo-refractory PDO cultures 
341 
 
342 
To ascertain alternative treatment strategies for PDO cultures, pharmacotyping was performed using a 
343 
panel of targeted agents (n = 21) on 66 PDAC-confirmed PDO cultures (Figure S7A, Table S4B). Among 
344 
the PDO cultures lacking sensitivity to any of the five chemotherapeutic agents (n = 22 out of 66, 33%) 
345 
(Table S4C), alternative treatment strategies were evaluated for 21 of these PDO cultures. We were able 
346 
to identify targeted agents with extreme PDO sensitivity (10% most sensitive) for half (n = 11) of these 
347 
chemotherapy-insensitive PDO cultures. For example, hT89 was resistant to four chemotherapeutic 
348 
regimens, but sensitive to the broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor Sunitinib (Table S4C). Targeted agent 
349 
sensitivities were also evaluated for chemo-sensitive PDO cultures. For instance, hT105, which was 
350 
sensitive to Oxaliplatin and Paclitaxel, was also sensitive to several targeted agents including Selumetinib, 
351 
Afatinib, Everolimus and LY2874455 (FGFR inhibitor). In line with previous findings, the PDO hF39 that 
352 
harbors the oncogenic MEK1 allele MAP2K1Q58_E62del was not sensitive to MEK inhibitor Selumetinib (20). 
353 
The ERBB-directed agent Afatinib showed increased activity towards PDOs harboring ERBB2 
354 
amplification, with the most sensitive PDO being the KRAS wildtype PDO hT102 that harbors the hyper-
355 
activating ERBB2S310F allele in the setting of amplifications in EGFR, ERBB2 and AKT2 (Figure 5C). 
356 
Evaluation of other genes involved with homologous repair deficiency revealed that while there are many 
357 
haploid losses in the copy number of these genes, these single copy losses do not correspond with 
358 
Olaparib sensitivity (Figure 5D, 1D, S7B). Deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations were not present in this PDO 
359 
library. Nonetheless, a trend was observed between Olaparib sensitivity and complete loss of PALB2 
360 
(Figure 1C-D). The only organoid harboring a PIK3CA mutation, the KRAS wildtype PDO hF43 that carried 
361 
the oncogenic PIK3CAE110del allele (18), was highly sensitive to the Rapamycin analogue Everolimus 
362 
(Figure 5E). Finally, the previously mentioned hM1 longitudinal series includes hM1A, which was isolated 
363 
from a lung metastasis and exhibited a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma pathology while the two PDO 
364 
cultures, hM1E and hM1F were isolated after the lung metastases switched to a small cell-like 
365 
(neuroendocrine) phenotype. Neuroendocrine tumors are often responsive to mTOR inhibition (24), which 
366 
is potentially paralleled by the switch of the hM1 series from an average to a sensitive Everolimus 
367 
therapeutic profile (Figure 5E). These results suggest that targeted therapy sensitivities empirically 
368 
identified in PDO pharmacotyping may supplement precision medicine approaches for PDAC patients. 
369 
 
370 
PDO pharmacotranscriptomic signature reflects treatment response in pancreatic cancer patients 
371 
 
372 
To investigate whether PDO pharmacotyping could be applied to advanced pancreatic cancer patients, we 
373 
generated drug sensitivity signatures by correlating PDO transcriptional profiles with the pharmacotyping 
374 
results. For each chemotherapeutic agent, we computed the Spearman correlation between PDO gene 
375 
expression and the AUC for each drug, and thereby defined distinct transcriptional signatures (Figures 6A, 
376 
S8, S9A-E, S10A-B and Table S5A-E). We refined the signatures to include genes that increased in

10 
expression when AUC decreased (negative rho value), which is indicative of increased drug sensitivity. By 
378 
clustering the PDO cultures using the individual drug response signatures, the PDOs could be grouped into 
379 
sensitive or non-sensitive classes for each individual chemotherapeutic signature. To determine whether 
380 
the PDO-derived pharmacotranscriptomic signatures reflected treatment responses in patients, we 
381 
obtained neoplastic cell-enriched gene expression data and associated clinical details from 126 patients 
382 
who underwent resection of their pancreatic tumor and then either received adjuvant treatment (n = 95) or 
383 
no treatment (n = 31) (ICGC-CA) (25). In this sample set, 43% of the patient tumors (55/126) were the 
384 
Basal-like subtype of PDAC. Treated patients received either Gemcitabine alone or in combination with 
385 
other chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, we applied the Gemcitabine-specific PDO sensitivity signature 
386 
to this patient cohort and determined that 50% of patients were enriched (Figure S11A). We used this 
387 
signature to evaluate patient response in the subgroup of 55 patients who received Gemcitabine 
388 
monotherapy, and found that patients with enrichment for the Gemcitabine sensitivity signature had a 
389 
significantly better progression free survival (PFS, 772 vs 373 days, HR= 0.54, P = 0.04) (Figure 6B-C), 
390 
and a trend towards improved overall survival (OS) (Figure S11B). Interestingly, in this cohort of 55 
391 
patients, the Basal-like subtype was similarly represented in the Gemcitabine sensitive and non-sensitive 
392 
groups (Figure 6B). Application of this gemcitabine sensitivity transcriptomic signature to a larger subgroup 
393 
of 91 patients who either received Gemcitabine monotherapy or Gemcitabine in combination with 5-FU or 
394 
Cisplatin also identified patients with a significantly better PFS, but not OS (Figure S11C-D). In the small 
395 
cohort of 30 untreated patients, the Gemcitabine sensitivity signature did not identify patients with improved 
396 
PFS or OS, demonstrating that this signature is treatment dependent (Figure 6D, S11E-F).  
397 
 
398 
Finally, the chemo-sensitivity signatures were applied to an independent transcriptomic data set obtained 
399 
from tumors of PDAC patients on the COMPASS trial (26). Patients on the COMPASS trial had advanced 
400 
pancreatic cancer and underwent core needle biopsy prior to treatment with combination chemotherapy. 
401 
The biopsies were of sufficient size to perform laser capture micro-dissection for mRNA isolation and 
402 
transcriptomic analysis. 30% of the tumors (22/73) were the Basal-like subtype of PDAC. We found that 44, 
403 
37, 31, 29 and 36 (60%, 51%, 42%, 40% and 49%) patients exhibited enrichment for the PDO-derived 
404 
sensitivity signatures for Oxaliplatin, 5-FU, SN-38, Gemcitabine and Paclitaxel, respectively (Figure 7A, 
405 
S12A-D). The Basal-like patients were equally distributed between the chemo-sensitive and non-sensitive 
406 
signatures with the exception of Oxaliplatin, which exhibited an enrichment of the Basal-like subtype in the 
407 
non-sensitive patient group (Figure 7A, S12A-D). Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 
408 
measurements were available for most patients 8 weeks following the initiation of therapy. We found that 
409 
the Oxaliplatin signature significantly correlated with response (r = -0.396, P = 0.0078) in patients receiving 
410 
FOLFIRINOX (n = 47). Patients that had an enrichment for the Oxaliplatin signature exhibited better tumor 
411 
responses to FOLFIRINOX than their non-sensitive counterparts, but the 5-FU and SN-38 signatures did 
412 
not provide additional information (Figure 7B). There was also a trend for increased overall survival in the 
413 
Oxaliplatin sensitive patients (Figure 7C), and notably there is a larger number of patients still alive in the 
414 
Oxaliplatin sensitive (n = 13) versus non-sensitive cohorts (n = 5). Intriguingly, of the 6 Basal-like patients 
415 
that lacked enrichment of the Oxaliplatin chemo-sensitivity signature and progressed on FOLFIRINOX, 5 
416 
exhibited enrichment for the Gemcitabine chemo-sensitivity signature (Figure 7B).  
417 
 
418 
19 tumor biopsies from patients with advanced PDAC were obtained prior to treatment with the 
419 
combination chemotherapy regimen Gemcitabine and nab-Paclitaxel, and RECIST criteria was again 
420 
measured at 8 weeks. In this smaller subset of patients, 7 patients harbored the Gemcitabine sensitivity 
421 
signature and 7 patients also exhibited the Paclitaxel sensitivity signature (Figure S12A-B, S13). The 4 
422 
patients that were sensitive to both Gemcitabine and Paclitaxel had reduced tumor sizes by their 8-week 
423 
radiological evaluation and many patients sensitive to either Gemcitabine or Paclitaxel also responded, 
424 
although the sample size is limited and the analysis interim (Figure S13). The ability of the PDO chemo-
425 
sensitivity signatures to expediently identify patients with better response in both the ICGC-CA and 
426 
COMPASS studies suggest that these signatures may have potential clinical utility following evaluation in 
427 
prospective clinical trials.

Discussion  
429 
 
430 
The poor response of PDAC patients to therapies has been attributed to neoplastic cell characteristics such 
431 
as cancer stem cells (17), redox metabolism (27) and intermediary metabolism (28, 29); and to non-cell 
432 
autonomous properties such as limited drug delivery (30-32), impaired intra-tumoral immunity (33) and 
433 
fibroblast- and microbial-mediated drug metabolism (34, 35). While the influence of different matrix 
434 
components or cancer-associated fibroblasts to therapeutic response is worthy of future examination, in 
435 
this study, we employ PDOs as a well-defined model system and demonstrate a broad range of intrinsic 
436 
neoplastic cell drug sensitivities to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. These data reveal the additional 
437 
impact of interpatient diversity to chemotherapeutic drug responses that may supersede or modify other 
438 
potential causes of drug resistance. The biological basis of this interpatient drug responsiveness is 
439 
currently under investigation and may involve drug transport, metabolism and/or response to cell damage. 
440 
Importantly, such questions may be addressed with PDOs as they are representative of the various 
441 
features of PDAC observed across a large population, including a similar distribution of the Basal-like and 
442 
Classical PDAC subtypes: 30% compared to 70%, respectively. By considering individual drug sensitivities 
443 
in organoids, transcriptional signatures were derived that mirrored patient outcomes in two separate clinical 
444 
cohorts following the adjuvant treatment of patients with Gemcitabine, or the palliative treatment of patients 
445 
with modified-FOLFIRINOX or Gemcitabine/nAb-Paclitaxel. These signatures may identify common 
446 
responders to first line chemotherapy agents and enable stratification of patients such that they may rapidly 
447 
achieve clinical benefits while more tailored treatments can be developed for each patient. Interestingly, 
448 
there are a number of patients who exhibit enrichment for the chemo-sensitivity signatures in both the 
449 
adjuvant and the advanced disease setting that are continuing to respond. Whether these long-term 
450 
surviving, chemo-sensitive patients represent exceptional responders to either Gemcitabine or Oxaliplatin 
451 
will require additional investigation. The 5-FU sensitivity signature, which contained a relatively small 
452 
number of genes, did not perform well when evaluated in patients and will require further laboratory 
453 
assessment and optimization. Additionally, while promising in PDOs, the SN-38 signature did not clarify the 
454 
impact of the Oxaliplatin signature in the COMPASS trial patients. This may reflect the reduced Irinotecan 
455 
dosing on the modified FOLFIRINOX regimen and/or the need to further refine the SN-38 signature. On the 
456 
other hand, the Gemcitabine, Oxaliplatin and Paclitaxel signatures show concordance with patient 
457 
responses in our preliminary studies. Cases that lack concordance with the Oxaliplatin, Gemcitabine and 
458 
Paclitaxel chemo-sensitivity signatures may represent intra-tumoral heterogeneity that existed at the 
459 
initiation of therapy or evolved quickly. Methods that utilize non-invasive biomarkers as surrogates for 
460 
disease response may facilitate rapid adjustment to a more effective therapeutic regiment for patients. 
461 
Additionally, while both subtypes of pancreatic cancer were found in the chemo-sensitive and non-sensitive 
462 
transcriptomic subgroups, there was enrichment for the Basal-like subtype in the Oxaliplatin non-sensitive 
463 
group. Of note, some of these Oxaliplatin non-sensitive patients demonstrated enrichment for other chemo-
464 
sensitivity signatures, suggesting that alternative chemotherapies might be beneficial to those patients. 
465 
Going forward, these pharmacotranscriptomic signatures will need to be refined and prospectively 
466 
evaluated on larger cohorts of patients from whom high-quality PDAC transcriptomes can be obtained.  
467 
 
468 
While the pharmacotranscriptomic signatures can conceivably immediately benefit many PDAC patients, 
469 
an additional group of patients may also benefit from organoid profiling with investigational agents that are 
470 
available in a clinical trial setting. Indeed, approximately one third of the PDAC PDOs lacked sensitivity to 
471 
any of the five chemotherapies evaluated. For these chemotherapy non-sensitive PDOs, 52% (11 out of 
472 
21) of the PDO cultures demonstrated sensitivity to one or several targeted agents on the small panel we 
473 
employed. Whether these PDO sensitivities will translate into clinical responses in patients has yet to be 
474 
determined in prospective clinical trials. Additionally, our study has focused on assessing single agent 
475 
activity, and it is likely that drug combinations may yield more clinical opportunities in the future. 
476 
 
477 
Low cellularity is a common problem in primary pancreatic cancer specimens, often making it difficult to 
478 
discern molecular characteristics with high clarity and depth. Indeed, we found few genetic alterations 
479 
when assessing primary tumor specimens in all but 1 out of 13 cases that were analyzed by WGS. In 
480 
contrast, the PDO cultures yielded mutations with the expected allele frequency for pure, neoplastic 
481 
cultures in addition to complex genetic rearrangements. These analyses and the high concordance 
482 
between primary tumor specimens and their associated PDO cultures demonstrate the added benefit of 
483

performing deep genetic analyses on PDO cultures. In addition to thoroughly characterizing the canonical 
484 
genomic hallmarks of pancreatic cancer, three cases of KRAS wildtype pancreatic cancer were identified 
485 
that harbored uncommon oncogenic drivers such as the oncogenic alleles ERBB2S310F, MAP2K1Q58-E62del 
486 
and PIK3CAE110del. In two of these cases, exquisite sensitivities to Afatinib (ERBB2S310F, hT102) and 
487 
Everolimus (PIK3CAE110del, hF43) were observed, suggesting that these are actionable genetic alterations. 
488 
 
489 
Precision medicine approaches for pancreatic cancer are challenging due to the short median survival of 
490 
metastatic pancreatic cancer patients. In some cases, PDO pharmacotyping was completed in less than 6 
491 
weeks, demonstrating the ability of the PDO pharmacotyping to produce recommendations within a 
492 
clinically meaningful timeframe for both early and late stage pancreatic cancer. Complementary genomic 
493 
and transcriptomic profiling has recently been shown to be feasible for advanced pancreatic cancer 
494 
patients (26), thus providing further capacity to validate PDO phamacotyping and pharmacotranscriptomic 
495 
signatures in a prospective manner, even when first-line therapy is being selected. The technology of 
496 
generating and analyzing PDOs will continue to iteratively improve as the methodology is not uniformly 
497 
successful for all patients. Altogether, these early results suggest that chemo-sensitivity signatures may 
498 
stratify and thereby improve the initial care of pancreatic cancer patients. Furthermore, when coupled with 
499 
longitudinal PDO molecular and pharmacological profiling, this approach can be tailored to optimize the 
500 
care of individual patients. This strategy should not be limited to pancreatic cancer.  
501 
 
502 
Conclusion 
503 
 
504 
We generated a pancreatic cancer, patient-derived organoid library that encompasses a broad spectrum of 
505 
disease stage, uncommon genetic events as well as the previously established subtypes of pancreatic 
506 
cancer. PDO cultures facilitate in depth molecular characterization that has been traditionally challenging in 
507 
the unique pauci-cellular state of primary pancreatic tumors. PDO profiling using next-generation 
508 
sequencing of DNA and RNA combined with pharmacotyping may predict responses in pancreatic cancer 
509 
patients and provide a rational for prioritizing therapeutic regimens. This approach merits further evaluation 
510 
in prospective clinical trials for pancreatic cancer patients.

Methods: 
513 
 
514 
Human specimens. Normal pancreatic tissues were obtained from the islet transplant program at the 
515 
University of Miami Miller School of Medicine as described previously (15). Pancreatic cancer tissue was 
516 
obtained from patients undergoing surgical resection or tissue biopsy at Memorial Sloan Kettering, Stony 
517 
Brook University (GI Cancer Clinical Resource Core), Johns Hopkins University, Northwell Health, Weill 
518 
Cornell University, University of California Davis, and Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, MD Anderson 
519 
Cancer Center, Washington University St. Louis, and St. Francis hospital. Autopsy specimens from 
520 
metastatic sites were obtained from Rapid Autopsy Program at University of Nebraska Medical Center and 
521 
Washington University St. Louis. All tissue donations and experiments were reviewed and approved by the 
522 
Institutional Review Board of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and all clinical institutions. Written informed 
523 
consent was obtained prior to acquisition of tissue from all patients. The studies were conducted in 
524 
accordance to recognized ethical guidelines (Declaration of Helsinki). Samples were confirmed to be tumor 
525 
or normal based on pathologist assessment. 
526 
 
527 
Organoids, cell cultures and culture conditions. For human samples, tissues were minced and 
528 
incubated in digestion media (1mg/mL Collagenase XI, 10µg/mL DNAse I, 10.5µM Y-27632 in Human 
529 
complete Medium) at 37˚C with mild agitation for up to 1 hour. Cells were plated with Matrigel and grown in 
530 
Human complete Feeding Medium: advanced DMEM/F12, HEPES 10mM, Glutamax 1X, A83-01 500nM, 
531 
hEGF 50ng/mL, mNoggin 100ng/mL, hFGF10 100ng/mL, hGastrin I 0.01µM, N-acetylcysteine 1.25mM, 
532 
Nicotinamide 10mM, PGE2 1µM, B27 supplement 1X final, R-spondin1 conditioned media 10% final, 
533 
Afamin/Wnt3A conditioned media 50% final (17, 36). Organoid nomenclature is as follows: human normal 
534 
(hN), human tumor obtained from resections (hT), human fine needle biopsies obtained by either fine 
535 
needle aspiration or by core biopsy (hF), and human metastasis obtained from direct resection of 
536 
metastases following rapid autopsy or VATS resection (hM). All organoid models were isolated, cultured, 
537 
and routinely tested for Mycoplasma at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Organoid models were 
538 
characterized by DNA sequencing, and no additional authentication was performed. 
539 
 
540 
WGS library preparation and sequencing. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) libraries were prepared 
541 
using the Truseq DNA PCR-free Library Preparation Kit in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. 
542 
Briefly, 1ug of DNA was sheared using a Covaris LE220 sonicator (adaptive focused acoustics). DNA 
543 
fragments underwent bead-based size selection and were subsequently end-repaired, adenylated, and 
544 
ligated to Illumina sequencing adapters. Final libraries were evaluated using fluorescent-based assays 
545 
including qPCR with the Universal KAPA Library Quantification Kit and Fragment Analyzer (Advanced 
546 
Analytics) or BioAnalyzer (Agilent 2100). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq X sequencer 
547 
(v2.5 chemistry) using 2 x 150bp cycles aiming for 40, 60, and 80X coverage for normal germline, PDO, 
548 
and primary tumor specimens. 
549 
 
550 
Exome panel library preparation and sequencing. Whole exome sequencing (WES) libraries were 
551 
prepared using the KAPA Hyper Prep (Roche) and xGen Research Exome v1 Panel probes (Integrated 
552 
DNA Technologies) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 200ng of DNA was sheared 
553 
using a Covaris LE220 sonicator (adaptive focused acoustics). DNA fragments were end-repaired, 
554 
adenylated, ligated to Illumina sequencing adapters, amplified 7 cycles. The libraries were normalized and 
555 
pooled equal molar in 12-plex ponds. A total mass of 2500ng of the pre-capture ponds were blocked and 
556 
hybridized for 16 hours with the probes following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Resulting captured 
557 
libraries were then amplified 10 cycles. Final libraries were evaluated using fluorescent-based assays 
558 
including PicoGreen (Life Technologies) and Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytics) and they were 
559 
sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer (v4 chemistry) using 2 x 125bp cycles aiming for 50X 
560 
coverage. 
561 
 
562 
Sequencing Pre-Processing and Variant Calling. WGS and WES data for the tumor, organoid and 
563 
matched normal samples were processed by the NYGC somatic pre-processing pipeline which includes 
564 
aligning reads to the GRCh37 human reference genome using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) (37), 
565 
marking of duplicate reads by the use of NovoSort (a multi-threaded bam sort/merge tool by Novocraft

technologies http://www.novocraft.com), joint indel realignment for matched samples, and base 
567 
recalibration via Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) (38). The Exome study used the HapMap NA12878 
568 
sample in place of a matched normal sample, which was processed using the same protocol as the 
569 
organoid samples. Somatic Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV) calling is performed using muTect v1.1.7 (39), 
570 
LoFreq v2.1.3a (40), and Strelka v1.0.14 (41), and indel calling was performed using Pindel v0.2.5 (42), 
571 
Scalpel v0.5.3 (43) and Strelka v1.0.14. Structural nucleotide variants (SNVs) were detected by the use of 
572 
Crest v1.0 (44), Delly v0.6.1 (45), and BreakDancer v1.4.0 (46). Copy-number variants (CNVs) were 
573 
detected using NBIC-seq v0.7 (47) for WGS, and FACETS v0.5.2 (48) for Exome, resulting in segmented 
574 
profiles where the copy number is approximated by a piecewise-constant function of the genomic position. 
575 
 
576 
Organoid-Tumor SNV Concordance. SNV concordance between tumor-organoid pairs was determined 
577 
from the overlap of variant calls and variant allelic fractions. For each SNV called in the tumor or organoid, 
578 
we ran Samtools Pileup (with minimum base quality and minimum mapping quality of 10) at this position for 
579 
both samples to compute the variant allele fractions. If read evidence for the SNV was present in both 
580 
samples (and therefore VAF>0), the SNV was considered concordant. To add confidence to this analysis, 
581 
we only included SNVs that were called by 2 or more variant callers in at least one of the samples.  
582 
 
583 
Organoid-Tumor CNV Comparison. CNVs were compared between organoids and tumors by plotting the 
584 
CNV log2 values across chromosomes. A threshold of -0.235 and 0.2 was used to delineate the cutoff for 
585 
deletions and amplifications, respectively. This threshold is based off of a diploid sample with 30% purity. 
586 
Neutral segments are colored in green, and deletions/amplifications in red. The y-axis range is smaller for 
587 
the tumor samples so that possible CNVs can be more easily identified.  
588 
 
589 
WGS Purity / Ploidy Estimates. Purity and ploidy for each sample was manually calculated by comparing 
590 
the VAF of somatic SNV, BAF, and CNV log2 values of multiple variants within each sample. The final 
591 
average ploidy/purity was taken from the Titan (49) or ABSOLUTE (50) estimate that most closely matched 
592 
the manual calculation. No exact purity estimates were made for tumor samples that seem to have 
593 
extremely low purity (<15%).  
594 
 
595 
SNV and CNV landscape visualization. The SNV landscape is displayed using the Bioconductor package 
596 
GenVisR v1.8.0 (51). The CNV per gene heatmap was generated using the Bioconductor package 
597 
ComplexHeatmap v1.17.1 (52). A log2 value was assigned to each gene using the CNV region that covered 
598 
at least 50% of the gene via a custom R script. When no CNV region respected that threshold, the gene 
599 
was assigned a “No information” label. The CNV landscape per chromosome was illustrated using 
600 
Bioconductor package gtrellis v1.11.1 (53). 
601 
 
602 
RNA-sequencing library construction. For RNA-sequencing experiments, organoids in matrigel were 
603 
lysed directly with 1 mL of TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher) and total RNA was extracted according to the 
604 
manufacturer’s instructions. RNA-seq libraries were constructed using the TruSeq sample Prep Kit V2 
605 
(Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 2µg of purified RNA was poly-A selected 
606 
and fragmented with fragmentation enzyme. cDNA was synthesized with Super Script II master mix, 
607 
followed by end repair, A-tailing and PCR amplification. RNA-seq libraries were sequenced using an 
608 
Illumina HiSeq2500 or NextSeq platform with paired-end reads of 125 bases (Cold Spring Harbor Genome 
609 
Center, Woodbury).  
610 
 
611 
RNA-seq analysis. RNA-seq reads quality was first quantified using FastQC v0.11.5 
612 
[https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc]. Reads were then trimmed using Trimmomatic 
613 
v0.36 (54) and aligned using STAR v2.5.2b (55) on the transcripts corresponding to the human genome 
614 
(GRCh38.p10 assembly) and obtained from GENCODE (release 27) (56). RSEM v1.3.0 (57) was used to 
615 
extract counts per gene. The counts per gene were normalized using Bioconductor package DESeq2 
616 
v1.14.1 (58). For further analysis, genes without at least one count in 10% of the organoids were discarded 
617 
as well as genes not assigned as protein coding according to VEGA gene and transcript annotation from 
618 
Ensembl human (release 91). An average of 50 million reads per sample were aligned to the reference 
619 
genome.

Principal component analysis visualization. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on all 
622 
organoids (normal and tumor organoids) using the normalized and filtered counts per gene (see RNA-seq 
623 
analysis section). A variance stabilization transformation was performed using Bioconductor package 
624 
DESeq2 v1.14.1 (58). The 2000 most variable genes were retained and used as input for the PCA analysis 
625 
which was performed using R stats package (59). K-means clustering was performed on the PDO 
626 
expression data reduced to three principle components, also using R stats package with the parameter for 
627 
the number of clusters fixed to 2. The result of the PCA-based clustering was displayed using the CRAN 
628 
package plotly v4.7.1 [https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=plotly].  
629 
 
630 
Differential gene expression analysis normal vs tumor organoids. A differential gene expression 
631 
(DGE) analysis was performed with Bioconductor package DESeq2 v1.14.1 (58) using the normalized and 
632 
filtered counts per gene from the RNA-seq analysis. The DGE analysis was performed between normal 
633 
and tumor organoids using DESeq2 likelihood ratio test (LRT).  
634 
 
635 
Clustering of tumor organoids. Using only tumor organoids, a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) 
636 
clustering was performed on the 2000 most variable genes, as determined in the RNA-seq analysis, to 
637 
identify stable tumor organoids clusters using CRAN package NMF v0.20.6 (60). The NMF parameters 
638 
were: Brunet factorization method, rank of 2 through 7, 500 iterations. The best-performing clustering result 
639 
was selected using the observed cophenetic correlation between clusters and the average silhouette width 
640 
of the consensus matrices. The NMF clustering generated 2 stable tumor organoids clusters, labeled C1 
641 
and C2. Only the individuals with the higher consensus are included in C1 and C2 clusters. Three PDO 
642 
cultures with poor cluster identity consensus were excluded from the subsequent differential expression 
643 
analysis. The NMF clustering was refined to 245 genes (Figure 3, Table S3). 
644 
 
645 
Differential gene expression analysis tumor organoids. A DGE analysis was performed on the tumor 
646 
organoids only. A differential gene expression analysis was performed between C1 and C2 tumor 
647 
organoids clusters using DESeq2 with default parameters. The CRAN package gplots v3.0.1 
648 
(https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gplots) was used to generate a heatmap of the 250 genes most 
649 
significantly differentially expressed between C1 and C2. Of these, 5 genes with a median expression 
650 
count of zero were removed. 
651 
 
652 
Pharmacotyping of organoids. Organoids were dissociated into single cells. 500 viable cells were plated 
653 
per well in in 20µL 10% Matrigel / human complete organoid media. Therapeutic compounds were added 
654 
24 hours post plating, after the reformation of organoids was visually verified. Chemotherapeutic were 
655 
tested in triplicates: gemcitabine, paclitaxel, SN38 range from 8.1x10-12 M to 2.0x10-6 M, and 5-FU and 
656 
Oxaliplatin range from 1.0x10-8 M to 5.0x10-5 M. Targeted drugs were tested in singlicates (range from 
657 
1.0x10-8 M to 1.0x10-5 M). Compounds were dissolved in DMSO and all treatment wells were normalized to 
658 
0.5% DMSO content. After 5 days cell viability was assessed using CellTiter-Glo as per manufacturer's 
659 
instruction (Promega) on a SpectraMax I3 (Molecular Devices) plate reader. A three-parameter log-logistic 
660 
function with upper limit equal to the mean of the DMSO values was fit to the pharmacotyping data (viability 
661 
vs. dose) with CRAN package drc v3.0-1 (61). Quality control was performed on the curve fitness: rejection 
662 
of the curve if 100% plateau is located beyond 2 standard deviation of the mean DMSO control and visual 
663 
inspection, leading to possible rejection, of the top 5% curves ranked with the highest sum of the squared 
664 
differences between triplicate measurements and fitted curve. The area under the curve (AUC) was 
665 
calculated using CRAN package Bolstad2 v1.0-28 (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Bolstad2/). 
666 
Normalized AUC was obtained by dividing the AUC value by the maximum area for the concentration 
667 
range measured for each drug. The range of the normalized AUC is between 0 and 1. 
668 
 
669 
Pharmacotranscriptomic analysis. For each drug, the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was 
670 
calculated between the organoid drug-specific AUC and the 10,000 most variably expressed genes 
671 
(normalized counts) obtained from the RNA-seq analysis. The Spearman’s rank correlation was selected to 
672 
test for monotonic, but not necessarily linear, dependence between the AUC and the gene expression. For 
673 
derivation of drug-specific transcriptional signatures, genes were filtered using the p-values for the 
674 
Spearman’s coefficient calculation as threshold (p-value < 0.01). Genes positively correlated with sensitivity 
675 
(r < -0.38) to a chemotherapeutic drug were selected for validation in patient derived RNA-seq data (Table

S5). Each filtered gene list was clustered separately using the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients. To 
677 
rank sensitivity of PDOs and patients using RNA-seq data, mean z-score was computed for the individual 
678 
drug sensitivity signature and ranked from high mean expression to low mean expression. A flow chart of 
679 
the pharmacotranscriptomic analysis pipeline is presented in Figure S8.

Figure 1. Genomic landscape of pancreatic cancer PDO. A. Isolation efficiency rate of PDOs from total 
874 
samples, biopsies (hF), and resected surgical specimens (hT). B. PDO morphology in brightfield 
875 
microscopy. Scale bars are 1000 or 500 µm as indicated. C. Single nucleotide variants in the PDO library. 
876 
Mutation frequency indicated in both cancer and normal organoids (cancer % (left) / normal % (right)). Only 
877 
mutations reported in COSMIC were included. Patient staging and type of mutation are denoted by a color-
878 
coded key. FS = Frameshift, Del. = Deletion, Ins. = Insertion, IF = In Frame, NA = Not Available. D. Copy 
879 
number alterations (-2.0 through -0.235 and 0.235 through 2.0 log2 copy number ratio color key) in the 
880 
PDO library. The cancer stages of the patients are indicated.  
881 
 
882 
Figure 2. Deep molecular clarity obtained from PDO genetic analyses. A. Purity, ploidy, concordance 
883 
and percent of the primary tumor mutations found in the PDO cultures using whole genome SNVs of the 
884 
PDO and matched primary tumor specimens following germline variant removal. Representative Venn 
885 
diagrams are shown of PDO and Primary Tumor SNVs. B. CNA in representative matched primary tumor 
886 
specimens and corresponding PDO. Two representative cases with differing degrees of primary tumor 
887 
purity are shown. C. Circos plots demonstrating CNA (red and blue CNA inner circles) and gross 
888 
chromosomal rearrangements (connecting lines) in representative, matched primary tumor and PDOs 
889 
following germline variant removal.  
890 
 
891 
Figure 3. Transcriptomic profiling of PDOs reveals distinct subtypes. A. Principal component analysis 
892 
of organoids isolated from different cancer stages and normal healthy controls. B Clustering of PDO culture 
893 
RNA-seq data reveals concordance with Classical and Basal-like subtypes. Patient staging and subtype 
894 
are indicated. C. Clustering using Non-negative Matrix Factorization defines two distinct clusters of PDO 
895 
cultures, C1 and C2. Patient staging and subtype are indicated. D. GSEA of genes differentially expressed 
896 
genes between C1 and C2. Three Hallmark pathways are shown to be enriched in C1 compared to C2 (top 
897 
panels), and three are enriched in C2 (lower panels, negative enrichment C1/C2).

Figure 4. Pharmacotyping of PDOs reveals heterogeneity of chemotherapy response. A-E: Dose-
900 
response curves and normalized AUC distribution for Gemcitabine (A), Paclitaxel (B), SN-38 (C), 5-FU (D), 
901 
and Oxaliplatin (E) on PDO cultures (n = 63 – 66). The blue portion represents the 33% most sensitive 
902 
samples, the red portion the 34% most resistant samples, and the middle portion intermediate drug 
903 
responses.  
904 
 
905 
Figure 5. Longitudinal, spatial and genetic influences on PDO response. A. AUC distribution of hM1A, 
906 
E and F PDO longitudinal series. B. AUC distribution of hM19 A, B, C, and D PDOs from the same patient 
907 
but different metastatic sites. C-E. AUC distribution and genotype correlation of Afatinib (C), Olaparib (D), 
908 
and Everolimus (E) responders. 
909 
 
910 
Figure 6. PDO-derived Gemcitabine sensitivity signature stratifies pancreatic cancer patients with 
911 
improved response to adjuvant Gemcitabine. A. The Gemcitabine sensitivity prediction signature was 
912 
used to cluster the PDO RNA-seq data. Additional data regarding the Pharmacotyping AUC response (log2 
913 
transformed z-score), C1/C2 subtype, Basal/Classical subtype, and stage are shown. B. The Gemcitabine 
914 
sensitivity prediction signature was applied to RNA-seq data from patients who received single-agent 
915 
Gemcitabine (ICGC-CA). Additional data regarding the Pharmacotyping AUC response (log2 transformed z-
916 
score), C1/C2 subtype, Basal/Classical subtype, and stage are shown. C. Kaplan-Meier analysis of PFS of 
917 
Gemcitabine-sensitive and non-sensitive patients as identified in B. D. Kaplan-Meier analysis of PFS of 
918 
Gemcitabine-sensitive and non-sensitive untreated patients. Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test P value and log-
919 
rank Hazard Ratio are shown.

Figure 7. PDO-derived Oxaliplatin sensitivity signature stratifies advanced pancreatic cancer 
922 
patients with improved response to FOLFIRINOX. A. The PDO-derived sensitivity signatures were 
923 
applied to the RNA-seq data from 73 patients enrolled on the COMPASS trial that received either m-
924 
FOLFIRINOX or Gemcitabine with nab-Paclitaxel. B. A waterfall plot of the patients with RECIST criteria at 
925
