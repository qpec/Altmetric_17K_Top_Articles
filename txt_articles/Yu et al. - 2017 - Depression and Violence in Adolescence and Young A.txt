Objective: Despite recent research demonstrating associ-
ations between violence and depression in adults, links in
adolescents are uncertain. This study aims to assess the
longitudinal
associations
between
young
people’s
depression and later violent outcomes.
Method: We used data from three cohorts with different
measurements of depression exposures and subsequent
violent outcomes. In a Dutch community cohort Research
on Adolescent Development And Relationships (RADAR;
N ¼ 623) and a population-based British birth cohort
Avon
Longitudinal
Study
of
Parents
and
Children
(ALSPAC; N ¼ 4,030), we examined the longitudinal links
between adolescent depressive symptoms and violent
behaviors from age 13 to 17 years. In a total Finnish birth
cohort (FBC 1987; N ¼ 57,526), we estimated risk of
violent convictions in individuals clinically diagnosed
with depression from age 15 to 27 years.
Results: During a mean follow-up period of 4 years, the
adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of violent behaviors per unit of
increase in depressive symptoms was 1.7 (95% CI ¼ 1.2–
2.5) in the Dutch RADAR community sample and 1.8 (95%
CI ¼ 1.4–2.3) in the British ALSPAC birth cohort. In the
FBC 1987 cohort, the aOR of violent convictions was 2.1
(95% CI ¼ 1.7–2.7) among individuals with a depression
diagnosis compared with general population controls
without depression. All risk estimates were adjusted for
family socioeconomic status and previous violence.
Conclusion: Consistent findings across three longitudinal
studies suggest that clinical guidelines should consider
recommending risk assessment for violence in young
people with depression. The benefits of targeting risk
management
in
subgroups
by
gender
need
further
investigation.

ecent empirical work has shown a heightened risk of
violence
in
individuals
with
depression.
This
depression–violence link in adults has been reported
in cross-sectional community surveys and register-based
investigations,1,2 as well as longitudinal cohort studies.3-5
In particular, a recent longitudinal investigation of the
whole Swedish population reported that the risk of violent
crime in individuals with depression was around three
times higher than in the normal population and increased
twofold compared with that in their siblings without
depression.4
However,
research
into
the
depression–
violence link currently lacks a developmental perspective.
The link might even be stronger in adolescents than in
adults because adolescent depression, compared with its
adult form, is more likely to present with temper tantrums
and irritability,6 which may mediate any association with
violence. Prior research has evaluated the depression–
violence link mainly in clinical samples in which depression
is evaluated dichotomously, and further clarification is
required to determine whether this relationship is main-
tained at a nonclinical level. This is potentially important
because minor depressive symptoms in adolescence predict
full-blown depressive disorder and problem behaviors later
in life, and are more common than adult depression.7
Therefore, research into the depression–violence link in
community
adolescent
samples
in
which
both
minor
depressive symptoms and violent behaviors are prevalent8,9
will address current uncertainties.
In addition, high rates of depression have been reported
among adolescents in juvenile detention and correctional
facilities (which have been estimated at 11% in boys and 29%
in girls).10 Despite the fact that that depression may co-occur
with violence or related disorders such as conduct disor-
ders,11 and that factors such as genetic vulnerabilities12 or
peer victimizations13 have been suggested to mediate these
links,
clarifying
the
longitudinal
association
between
depression and subsequent violence among young people is
required with careful adjustment for confounding factors.
Research in adolescents could inform primary prevention
and clinical management in particularly sensitive develop-
mental periods for assessing and managing violence risk in
depression. Adolescent depression is often underdiagnosed
and untreated until later in life.9,14 If a longitudinal
association between adolescent depression and violence is

 identified, prevention efforts could further be shifted to ad-
olescents, especially because there is clear evidence of
effectiveness of treatment in this developmental period.15
Therefore, we have analysed data from three longitudinal
studies to investigate links between depression and violence
using both community and clinical samples of adolescents
and young adults. Data from three European countries (i.e.,
the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Finland) were
used. The epidemiological rates of depression and violence
appear to be broadly similar in these three countries, with
the prevalence of depressive disorders ranging from 2.5% to
3.6%16 and violent convictions around 3% among young
people.17,18
METHOD
Study Samples
We adopted a multiple-sample approach to examine the depression–
violence link. We used three validated longitudinal datasets: a
Dutch community cohort (Research on Adolescent Development
And Relationships [RADAR]; N ¼ 678); a population-based birth
cohort in the UK (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children
[ALSPAC]; N ¼ 13,973) born in 1991 or 1992; and a total birth cohort
of Finns born in 1987 (the 1987 Finnish Birth Cohort [FBC 1987]; N ¼
59,476). These three samples were selected for a number of major
reasons. First, all of the cohorts included high-quality longitudinal
data on depression and violence in young persons from a small-scale
community sample to a total birth cohort. Second, these three co-
horts used complementary measures of the examined variables,
including self-report and clinical diagnoses of depression, and self/
informant-report of violent behaviors and official registration of
violent convictions. The variation in the sample characteristics and
complementary measures of the studied variables provided an op-
portunity to test the link between depression and violence more
comprehensively than previously done.
RADAR is an ongoing longitudinal study in the Netherlands.
Adolescents were recruited from randomly selected schools in the
midwestern part of the Netherlands. Data from 623 Dutch adoles-
cents (341 male [55%]) who were annually followed from age 13 to
17 years were used. The mean age of the sample was 13.1 years
(SD ¼ 0.5 year) at first measurement. The majority of the partici-
pants identified themselves as Dutch (n ¼ 499 [80.1%], with the
other 124 participants [19.9%] being ethnic minorities). The RADAR
cohort study was approved by the ethical-medical committee of
University Medical Centre Utrecht, the Netherlands.
ALSPAC is a population-based birth cohort study in the UK.
ALSPAC recruited 15,247 pregnant women residents in the Avon
area who expected to deliver a child between 1 April 1991 and 31
December 1992, resulting in 15,458 children. For reasons of
confidentiality, triplets and quadruplets were excluded. In the
current study, we used data from a subsample of adolescents who
participated in ALSPAC clinic sessions and were asked to fill in
questionnaires related to depressive symptoms and violent be-
haviors. The total sample included 4,030 adolescents (1,768 male
[43.9%]). Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the
ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee and the local research ethics
committee.
The FBC 1987 study is a prospective nationwide population
investigation in Finland. It consists of 60,069 children born in
Finland in 1987.19 Follow-up information was collected for all cohort
members who survived the first week after birth (N ¼ 59,476; 30,435
male [51.2%]). Data on the use of health care services, criminality, as
well as family and socio-demographic background were obtained
from official registers. The register data from the Finnish Legal
Register Centre, Finnish Hospital Discharge Register (HDR), Statis-
tics Finland Registers, and Population Register were combined using
the participants’ personal identification numbers. The FBC 1987
cohort study was approved by the ethical committee of the National
Institute for Health and Welfare (x28/2009).
Measures
Depressive Symptoms and Diagnosis. In the RADAR and ALSPAC
cohorts, depressive symptoms were assessed with questionnaires. In
RADAR, Reynolds’s Adolescent Depression Scale (2nd RADS-2)20
was used, which is a self-report questionnaire with 23 items (e.g.,
“I feel like nothing I do helps anymore”). At age 13 years, adoles-
cents responded to the questionnaire on a 4-point Likert-type scale,
ranging from 1 (almost never) to 4 (usually). Cronbach’s a of this
scale was .93. In the ALSPAC cohort, depressive symptoms were
measured by the short version of the Mood and Feelings Ques-
tionnaire (SMFQ),21 which is a 13-item checklist of symptoms
experienced in the previous 2 weeks (e.g., In the past 2 weeks, have
you felt miserable or unhappy?). Adolescents reported on their
depressive symptoms at age 13 years, with a three-point scale
including 1 (true), 2 (sometimes true), and 3 (not true). Data were
reversely coded so that higher scores indicated higher depressive
symptoms. Cronbach’s a of the scale was .84. Mean scores of
depressive symptoms were calculated for the logistic regression
analyses.
For FBC 1987, information on clinical diagnoses, rather than
symptoms (which was not collected), was obtained from the Finnish
Hospital Discharge Register (HDR) held by the National Institute
for Health and Welfare (THL). HDR has been found to be a valid
and reliable tool for epidemiological research.22 The register in-
cludes all specialized inpatient and outpatient visits in public hos-
pitals since 1998; participants were on average 11 years of age.
Participants with at least two outpatient episodes as a main diag-
nosis between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2012 (11–25 years)
were identified as having a diagnosis of depression, according to
the International Classification of Diseases–10th Revision (ICD-10; codes
F32-F33.9).
Among the 59,476 participants in the FBC 1987 cohort, 3,666
(6.2%) had at least one outpatient (specialist) episode with a clinical
depression diagnosis. We excluded participants with only one
outpatient visit for a depressive episode (n ¼ 772), or with a sec-
ondary diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophrenia spectrum disor-
der, or bipolar disorder (n ¼ 74), as those cases were most likely
misclassified as depression during the first outpatient visits. We also
excluded those participants with an inpatient diagnosis of depres-
sion (n ¼ 923), as it would lead to selection biases: individuals’
admissions to the hospital might have been secondary to recent
violence or violence risk. In addition, we excluded 262 individuals
with an inpatient diagnosis of depression but without an outpatient
diagnosis of depression from the general control sample. Further-
more, we excluded participants with no exact date of violent crime
(n ¼ 78) from either case or control samples. Therefore, there were
2,050 individuals with clinical depression diagnoses and 55,476
general controls without depression.
Violent Behaviors and Convictions. In the RADAR and ALSPAC
cohorts, violent behaviors in the past 12 months were measured
with questionnaires. In RADAR, a scale based on the International
Self-Report Delinquency Study23 was used. Violent behaviors
included stealing from a person with threat or force, assault, hurting
someone with weapon, and beating or kicking someone. Adoles-
cents who committed at least one of the listed violent behaviors from
the second to the fifth measurements (14–17 years of age) were
categorized as being violent. In ALSPAC, both adolescents and their

 mothers reported on adolescents’ violent behaviors in a confidential
self-reported questionnaire, originally developed in the Edinburgh
Study of Youth Transitions and Crime.24 Adolescents reported when
they were 13, 14, and 17 years of age, and their mothers reported
when adolescents were 16 years of age. Adolescents were catego-
rized as being violent if they had committed any of the following
behaviors from measures at age 14 to 17: stole from person with
force or threats, assaulted, hit, kicked, or punched someone, and
used weapons in fights. Violence measured at age 13 years was used
as a control variable in RADAR and ALSPAC.
In FBC 1987, information on violent convictions was retrieved
from the Finnish Legal Registration Centre that covers crimes
committed for all individuals from the age of 15 years, the age of
criminal responsibility in Finland, to age 27 (i.e., over the period
January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2014). We extracted data for
violent crimes both before (as covariate) and after (as outcome)
diagnosis of depression. For population controls without depres-
sion, violent convictions occurring before and after the mean date
of diagnosis of depression were used as covariate and outcome,
respectively. Convictions for violent crimes in FBC 1987 included
homicide, all forms of assault, robbery, rape, and sexual offense
toward a child.
Statistical Analyses
To calculate the odds ratio of later violence in depression, we con-
ducted logistic regression analyses in Mplus,25 with depressive
symptoms and diagnosis as the independent variable and with
subsequent violent behaviors and convictions as dependent vari-
ables. To examine whether the association between depression and
violent outcomes differed between boys and girls, subgroup
analyses were conducted.
In regard to confounders, we took into account effects of family
socioeconomic status and previous violence in all three cohorts.
Controlling for previous violence could inform us as to whether
adolescent depression predicted changes in violence over time. In
the additional sensitivity analyses, we also adjusted for other factors
including parental criminality, conduct disorder, and maltreatment
where data were available.
RESULTS
Descriptive Statistics
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for depressive symp-
toms, depression diagnosis, and violent outcomes in the
three longitudinal cohorts. The prevalence of violent be-
haviors from age 14 to 17 years was 29.7% in the RADAR
cohort, based on adolescents’ self-reported violent behaviors
in the previous 12 months across four annual waves. In the
ALSPAC cohort, the prevalence of violent behaviors from
age 14 to 17 years was 35.2%, using both self and mother
reports of violence in the previous 12 months. In the FBC
1987 cohort, 3.7% were convicted of violent crimes during
2002 and 2014 (i.e., during ages 15–27 years).
In the RADAR and ALSPAC cohorts, the mean scores of
depressive symptoms at age 13 years were significantly
lower in boys than in girls (t [df ¼ 610] ¼ 3.6, p < .001 in
RADAR and t [df ¼ 3481] ¼ 6.4, p < .001 in ALSPAC). Across
these two cohorts, boys were more likely to commit violent
behaviors

girls (35.2%

In the FBC 1987 cohort, the mean age at the first outpa-
tient diagnosis of depression was 19.7 years (SD ¼ 3.5). The
overall prevalence of depression was 3.6% and boys were
less likely to be diagnosed with depression than girls (2.2%
boys vs. 5.0% girls; c2

during follow-up was 3.7%, with boys more likely to be
convicted of violent offense than girls (6.2% boys vs. 1.2%
girls, c2

146 (7.1%) individuals with depression (97 male [14.5%] and
49 female [3.5%]) were convicted of one or more violent
crimes, compared with 1,981 (3.6%) general population
controls (1,687 male [5.8%] and 294 female [1.1%]).

 Longitudinal Effects of Depressive Symptoms and
Diagnosis on Later Violence
Across cohorts, there were positive associations between
measures of depression and subsequent violent behaviors,
adjusted for the effects of family socioeconomic status and
previous violence (Table 2). An overall adjusted odds ratio
(aOR) of 1.7 (95% CI ¼ 1.2–2.5) was reported in the RADAR
cohort and 1.8 (1.4–2.3) in the ALSPAC cohort; that is, a
1-unit increase in the mean score of depressive symptoms
was associated with 1.7- and 1.8-fold elevated risk of later
violent behaviors, respectively. In the FBC 1987, the overall
aOR of convictions for subsequent violent crime was 2.1
(1.7–2.7) among individuals with a depression diagnosis
compared with general population controls. The full set of
variables included in our regression models are presented on
Table S1, available online.
Across all three cohorts, higher aORs for violent out-
comes were generally found in girls than in boys, although
CIs were overlapping. In the RADAR cohort, an aOR of 2.7
(1.4–5.1) was reported in girls and 1.6 (1.0–2.5) in boys. In the
ALSPAC cohort, the aOR was higher in girls (aOR [95%
CI] ¼ 2.2 [1.6–2.9]) than in boys (aOR [95% CI] ¼ 1.8 [1.2–
2.6]). In addition, in the FBC 1987, the aORs of violent con-
victions were higher for girls with depression (3.8 [2.5–5.6])
than
for
boys
with
depression
(2.7
[2.0–3.6]),
when
compared to their same-gender population controls without
depression. When we right-censored for death during
follow-up, aORs did not materially alter (data not shown).
For FBC 1987, we performed additional analyses to test
the risk of later violent convictions in individuals with an
inpatient diagnosis of depression (n ¼ 1,181), including
those with and without an outpatient diagnosis of depres-
sion, compared to controls without depression (n ¼ 55,477).
The overall aOR of convictions for violent crime was 2.8
(2.2–3.7) among individuals with an inpatient depression
diagnosis
compared
with
general
population
controls
without depression. In addition, the aORs of violent
convictions were significantly higher for girls with depres-
sion (7.1 [5.0–10.2]) than for boys with depression (2.7
[1.9–4.0]), when compared to their same-gender population
controls without depression.
Controlling for additional variables such as parental
criminality, conduct disorder, and maltreatment made little
difference
to the findings. In RADAR, we controlled
for maltreatment experiences including being a victim of
sexual assault, a victim of physical assault, and threatened
with violence, and we obtained similar results (i.e., aOR
[95% CI] ¼ 1.5 [1.0–2.3] in the total sample, 2.3 [1.1–4.6] in girls,
and 1.4 [0.9–2.4] in boys). In ALSPAC, the odds of violence in
depression remained similar after additional adjustment for
parental
criminality,
conduct
disorder,
and
childhood
maltreatment (i.e., aOR [95% CI] ¼ 1.8 [1.4–2.2] in the total
sample, 2.2 [1.6–3.0] in girls, and 1.7 [1.2–2.6] in boys). In
FBC 1987, results were similar after further adjustment of
conduct disorder (i.e., aOR [95% CI] ¼ 2.0 [1.6–2.6] in the total
sample, 3.5 [2.3–5.2] in girls, and 2.5 [1.8–3.5] in boys).
Furthermore, analyses with mean scores of depressive
symptoms standardized in RADAR and ALSPAC revealed
similar aORs. That is, 1 standard deviation of change in the
mean score of depressive symptoms resulted in similar odds
of violence in RADAR and ALSPAC (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
We found a consistent pattern of increased risk of later
violent behaviors in depression in cohorts of adolescents and
young adults in longitudinal analyses, with overall aORs
ranging from 1.7 to 2.1 across all three cohorts. We also found
that the odds of violent outcomes were typically higher in
girls (aORs ranged from 2.2 to 7.1) than in boys (aORs ranged
from 1.6 to 2.7). At the same time, the absolute risks in girls
were considerably lower across the three cohorts.
Previous research has shown high rates of depression in
adolescents in detention and correctional facilities.10 How-
ever, it has been difficult to generalize such findings to the
general population, as the temporal relationship between
depression and serious criminality is unclear in such cross-
sectional investigations. Our longitudinal design allowed
us to control for previous violence, enabling us to test
whether adolescent depression is associated with changes in
violence over time. This is a clear improvement, and we
report similar findings despite geography, differences in
measurements of exposures and outcomes, and increased
violence risk by severity. This could potentially act as a
foundation to test in trials of whether treating depression in
younger persons can reduce crime outcomes. Moreover, our
findings are in line with previous studies in adult samples
showing links between depression and violence.2,4 Although
the associations between depression and violence reported
here were slightly weaker than previous longitudinal studies
in adults,2,4 this may be a consequence of higher base rates of
mild depression reported in younger persons.
Across all three cohorts, there was a trend that the odds
of violent behaviors were higher for girls than for boys,
although CIs overlapped. These findings are in keeping with
research into risk of violence in bipolar disorders26 and

DEPRESSION AND VIOLENCE IN YOUNG PEOPLE
 personality disorders,27 and can be explained by the low
absolute risks of violence by women. In other words, when
the base rate is very low, any positive association leads to
high relative risks, even when the absolute risk difference
remains small. As part of any risk communication, clarifying
both relative and absolute risks needs to be considered.
Our study has several strengths. First, we adopted a
multiple-sample approach by using data from three different
countries to examine the link between depression and
violence, which adds to the generalizability of our findings.
Second, we assessed depression and violence using different
methods. In the RADAR and ALSPAC cohorts, the approach
was potentially more sensitive, because we used continuous
symptom measures and adopted questionnaires to assess
violent behaviors. In the FBC 1987 sample, we investigated
clinical diagnoses of depression primarily in outpatients but
also in inpatients for secondary analyses, and extracted
convictions for violent crime from a comprehensive national
register. Using these multiple approaches, we demonstrated
similar significant associations between depression and
violence. In addition, we captured violent behaviors in
adolescents
who
were
below
the
age
of
criminal
responsibility (i.e., 15 years) and therefore may not acquire a
criminal record as a matter of law. Therefore, our study
extends investigation to different phases of adolescence and
early adulthood as well as testing levels of varying severity
of violence. Third, all the cohorts were longitudinal, allow-
ing us to test prospectively associations between depression
and later violence and hence reduce the possibility of reverse
causality bias.
The following limitations should be considered. First, our
study used data from three high-income countries. The
prevalence of adolescent depressive disorders among the
three cohorts were comparable to the worldwide pooled
prevalence.16 However, the rates of youth violence rates
vary
significantly
among
countries,
with
high-income
countries reporting lower rates than low- and middle-
income countries.18 Therefore, future studies of the depres-
sion–violence link in low- and middle-income countries28
are necessary. Second, different instruments were used to
collect information on depression and violence across co-
horts. Although the ORs in the three samples were highly
comparable,
they
should
be
interpreted
differently.
Furthermore, direct comparison of results for different
methods within cohorts was not possible. In addition,
different measurements across studies will have contributed
to
between-sample
heterogeneity.
To
further
examine
sources of heterogeneity, future research could consider
pooling reported data or individual participant meta-
analysis that synthesizes data using common definitions of
variables.29 Third, no data on violence from other in-
formants were available in the RADAR and FBC 1987 co-
horts. Multi-informant data are recommended in future
investigations to increase the validity of the measure-
ments.30 Fourth, although our study provides evidence that
depression predicts future violence, the possibility exists
that depression and violence reinforce each other and, in
doing so, increase their effects individually and in combi-
nation over time. For instance, it has been shown that
aggression in adolescents may provoke peer victimization,
which in turn leads to depression.13 Finally, although the
rate of violent convictions in FBC 1987 was comparable to
the national youth violence rate in Finland,17 ALSPAC and
RADAR used community populations, and results reflect
each local area. These two cohorts were mostly representa-
tive of the populations from which they were drawn, apart
from possibly coming from a higher socioeconomic status
based on house ownership in ALSPAC31 and employment
type in RADAR.32 If these social class differences are vali-
dated, this would likely mean that our risk estimates are
conservative,
as
lower social
class
is
associated
with
violence outcomes.
The finding that depression in adolescents and young
adults is associated with long-term violent outcomes has
some potentially important implications for intervention and
prevention. Although suicide risk assessment has been a
standard clinical practice for individuals with depression,33
the risk of violence against others in depression has been
largely neglected. Clinical practice guidelines in the United
States34 very briefly discuss this link, which is not considered
in UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
(NICE) guidelines.33 If the findings are replicated and
triangulated (with trials, for example), information on risk
factors could be added. Furthermore, although the relative
risk of violence in adolescent depression did not appear to be
higher than in adult depression, the high absolute rates of
violent behaviors and developmental salience of adolescent
depressive symptoms suggest that consideration should be
given to assessment and management of violence risk in this
population. Compared with severe mental illnesses, such as
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, which are associated
with violent behaviors,35,36 adolescent and young adult
depression is a more prevalent mental health condition.
Furthermore, depression is chronic, recurrent, and appears
to have long-term negative effects on violence. The relatively
higher odds of violence in those individuals with an inpa-
tient diagnosis of depression suggests that severity of
depression may increase violence risk. Alternatively, it may
indicate that inpatient episodes are triggered in part by
violence risk. The former explanation, however, is consistent
with the findings from two cohorts that used continuous
measures.
Overall, this suggests, of course, that the timely treatment
of depression is likely to decrease the subsequent risk of
violent behaviors, and there needs to be more effort to this
end. Thus, early identification and treatment of depression
will have wide public health benefits. In addition, the find-
ings that both depressive symptoms and clinical diagnosis
were associated with future violence indicate that preven-
tion of violence should be undertaken at both the population
level in young persons with depressive symptoms who are
not in contact with health care services, and in a targeted
approach to a clinical population with specialist medical
contact.
The potential importance of the risk management of in-
dividuals with depression in forensic settings, including ju-
venile detention and correctional facilities, is highlighted by
these findings. As odds for violence are higher in girls,

 future
research
could
focus
more on
addressing risk
assessment and management for girls with depression.
Potential mediators and moderators of the reported links
between depression and violence need clarification. The
observed association may stem from shared mediators or
moderators. These may include mediators such as impul-
sivity, hostility, and mood regulation37,38 and moderators
such as history of trauma and alcohol use.39,40 Furthermore,
the associations replicated across three different, relatively
high-income countries suggest that common environmental
factors such as community violence might moderate and
genetic liability and stress sensitivity at an individual level
might mediate the link between depression and violence.12
Future investigation of these potential mediators and mod-
erators is needed. This information could assist in devel-
oping and testing interventions, and also could provide
alternative treatment targets (e.g., impulsivity, mood insta-
bility, and recent victimization) in addition to treatment of
the underlying depression.
This
study
has
identified
longitudinal
associations
between depression and later violent behaviors in three
longitudinal cohorts. We found elevated risks of violence in
adolescents and young adults with heightened depressive
symptoms and in those with a clinical diagnosis of depres-
sion, and higher relative risks in girls than in boys. These
findings highlight the need for improved treatment of
depression in young people, clarification of mechanisms,
and, if further validated, review of clinical guidelines. &
