Background: Seasonal influenza is a major public health concern in vulnerable populations. Here we investigated
the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody (VIS410) against
Influenza A in a Phase 1 clinical trial. Based on these results and preclinical data, we implemented a mathematical
modeling approach to investigate whether VIS410 could be used prophylactically to lessen the burden of a sea-
sonal influenza epidemic and to protect at-risk groups from associated complications.
Methods: Using a single-ascending dose study (n = 41) at dose levels from 2 mg/kg–50 mg/kg we evaluated the
safety as well as the serum and upper respiratory pharmacokinetics of a broadly-neutralizing antibody (VIS410)
against influenza A (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02045472). Our primary endpoints were safety and tolera-
bility of VIS410 compared to placebo. We developed an epidemic microsimulation model testing the ability of
VIS410 to mitigate attack rates and severe disease in at risk-populations.
Findings: VIS410 was found to be generally safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels, from 2–50 mg/kg. Overall, 27 of
41 subjects (65.9%) reported a total of 67 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). TEAEs were reported by 20 of
30 subjects (66.7%) who received VIS410 and by 7 of 11 subjects (63.6%) who received placebo. 14 of 16 TEAEs re-
lated to study drug were considered mild (Grade 1) and 2 were moderate (Grade 2). Two subjects (1 subject who
received 30 mg/kg VIS410 and 1 subject who received placebo) experienced serious AEs (Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs) that
were not related to study drug. VIS410 exposure was approximately dose-proportional with a mean half-life of
12.9 days. Mean VIS410 Cmax levels in the upper respiratory tract were 20.0 and 25.3 μg/ml at the 30 mg/kg and
50 mg/kg doses, respectively, with corresponding serum Cmax levels of 980.5 and 1316 μg/mL. Using these pharma-
cokinetic data, a microsimulation model showed that median attack rate reductions ranged from 8.6% (inter-
quartile range (IQR): 4.7%–11.0%) for 2% coverage to 22.6% (IQR: 12.7–30.0%) for 6% coverage. The overall
benefits to the elderly, a vulnerable subgroup, are largest when VIS410 is distributed exclusively to elderly
individuals, resulting in reductions in hospitalization rates between 11.4% (IQR: 8.2%–13.3%) for 2% cover-
age and 30.9% (IQR: 24.8%–35.1%) for 6% coverage among those more than 65 years of age.
Interpretation: VIS410 was generally safe and well tolerated and had good relative exposure in both serum
and upper respiratory tract, supporting its use as either a single-dose therapeutic or prophylactic for influ-
enza A. Including VIS410 prophylaxis among the public health interventions for seasonal influenza has the
potential to lower attack rates and substantially reduce hospitalizations in individuals over the age of 65.

 (Newton et al., 2000; Schanzer et al., 2008). Despite available therapy
with neuraminidase inhibitors, including oseltamivir, zanamivir,
and peramivir; 10%–44% of hospitalized patients require intensive
care and 25%–50% of these patients die. In the United States, it is
estimated that as many as 400,000 patients are hospitalized with
influenza each year, with as many as 50,000 deaths per year
(http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/us_flu-related_deaths.htm,
n.d.; Hamborsky et al., 2015). Furthermore, as evidenced by pan-
demic influenza A infections such as the 2009 “swine flu” pandemic,
newly emerging influenza subtypes represent a considerable threat
to global public health as they have the potential to cause significant
morbidity and mortality.
The majority of the severe disease burden during seasonal influenza
is experienced by individuals over the age of 65, who are susceptible to a
number of complications following infection with influenza virus (Reed
et al., 2015; Thompson et al., 2004). Currently available public health
interventions have not significantly mitigated disease burden for the
elderly. Vaccination with trivalent or tetravalent killed influenza has
historically had lower measured efficacy in elderly individuals com-
pared to adults and children (Darvishian et al., 2014; Breteler et al.,
2013; Osterholm et al., 2012). Prophylaxis or early treatment with neur-
aminidase inhibitors is the current de facto standard of care; however,
some controversy exists as to whether a direct link can be established
between early oseltamivir treatment and lower hospitalization rates
(Jefferson et al., 2014). Based on these shortfalls in care, there is a
need to develop countermeasures to reduce or mitigate the effects of in-
fluenza in the elderly and other susceptible populations.
Recently, several broadly neutralizing antibodies against influenza
have been reported, including against group 1 of influenza A (Ekiert
et al., 2009), group 2 of influenza A (Ekiert et al., 2011), and against
both group 1 and group 2 (Corti et al., 2011; Dreyfus et al., 2012). The
benefits of broadly neutralizing antibodies are that they may enable
protection of elderly individuals from influenza infection regardless of
immune response and potentially provide a reliable option when con-
sidering the vaccine mismatches that occur against influenza every
three to five years. Initial identification of C179, targeting the stem of in-
fluenza hemagglutinin (HA) (Okuno et al., 1993) was followed by iden-
tification of other stem-binding antibodies, including F10 (Sui et al.,
2009), CR6261/CR8020 (Ekiert et al., 2009; Ekiert et al., 2011), CR9114
(Dreyfus et al., 2012), and FI6 (Corti et al., 2011), among others
(Burioni et al., 2010; Kashyap et al., 2010). Using an antibody engineer-
ing approach, we developed a broadly neutralizing antibody (VIS410)
that targets a unique, conserved epitope on influenza HA and binds to
and neutralizes influenza A virus across group 1 and group 2 subtypes
(Tharakaraman et al., 2015). In vitro, VIS410 has been shown to neu-
tralize groups 1 and 2 influenza strains; over 40 different virus
strains have been tested to date, with EC50 values ranging from
0.1 – 60 μg/mL and representing broad temporal/geographical, sub-
type, and epitope diversity (Tharakaraman et al., 2015; Baranovich
et al., 2016). Additionally, in vivo studies in mouse models demonstrat-
ed that VIS410 administered as a prophylactic or therapeutic protects
mice challenged with lethal doses of influenza A, including A/Puerto
Rico/8/1934 (H1N1), A/California/04/2009 (H1N1), A/Victoria/3/1975
(H3N2), and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1). VIS410 also demonstrated
protection against newly emerging pathogenic H7N9 strains, A/Anhui/
1/2013 and oseltamivir-resistant A/Shanghai/1/2013 in a lethal BALB/c
mouse model (Baranovich et al., 2016). VIS410 is being developed as a
single dose treatment for hospitalized patients with influenza A and is
currently in phase 2 studies.
We report here the safety and pharmacokinetics of VIS410 in the
serum and the upper respiratory tract, the primary target organ of infec-
tion of influenza A. Furthermore, we utilize this information to model
the potential application of a broadly neutralizing antibody, such as
VIS410, during an influenza outbreak to mitigate severe disease, espe-
cially for at risk-populations. We provide evidence that VIS410 is gener-
ally safe and well-tolerated in healthy subjects with protective levels of
antibody achieved in the upper respiratory tract, and that it has a phar-
macokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profile that may allow it to be
used as a prophylactic during or prior to a period of high influenza activ-
ity. Taken together, these data support the development of a broadly
neutralizing monoclonal antibody as a complementary strategy to
existing measures for reducing the severity of seasonal influenza.
2. Methods
2.1. Production of Antibody
VIS410 was produced under current Good Manufacturing Practice
(cGMP) at Gallus Biopharmaceuticals (Princeton, NJ) in a CHO cell
line. After production at a 200 L scale, VIS410 was purified by protein
A and ion exchange polishing steps. Testing of bulk drug substance indi-
cated that the material was N99% monomer, containing b0.1 pg/mg
residual DNA and b0.1 ng/mg of host cell proteins. VIS410 material
was formulated at 25 mg/mL in 40 mM Citrate–Sodium Phosphate,
150 mM NaCl, pH 6.0, containing 0.025% Tween-80.
2.2. Phase I Clinical Trial
A Phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending
dose-escalation study was completed in healthy adult subjects
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02045472). This study was conducted
according to the International Conference on Harmonization Harmo-
nized Tripartite Guideline E6(R1): Good Clinical Practice. Institutional
Research Board approval for the study was obtained in writing before
the study began and all subjects signed an informed consent prior to
entry in the study. The primary endpoint for the study was the safety
and tolerability of VIS410 compared to placebo and the secondary
endpoint was the serum pharmacokinetics of a single dose of VIS410.
Eligible subjects were admitted to the clinic for dose administration
and were discharged 24-h post-infusion. Overall, 30 subjects were
dosed with VIS410 and 11 subjects were dosed with a placebo control
infusion (Fig. 1). Nine subjects were dosed in the first cohort (Cohort
1); 6 subjects received VIS410 (2 mg/kg) and 3 subjects received place-
bo (sodium chloride 0.9%). Eight subjects were dosed in the subsequent
cohorts (Cohorts 2 through 5) and were randomly assigned in a 6:2
ratio to receive either VIS410 or placebo. The detailed phase 1 protocol
is presented in supplemental materials.
Briefly, in the first cohort (Cohort 1) the first four sentinel subjects
were randomly assigned to receive either VIS410 (2 mg/kg; n = 2) or
placebo (n = 2) and received study drug at least 48 h before the remain-
ing subjects in the cohort were dosed. After the investigator had
assessed that the infusions were well tolerated, the remaining subjects
in the cohort were dosed concurrently (VIS410 n = 4 and placebo
n = 1). In each subsequent cohort, the first 3 subjects were randomly
assigned to receive either VIS410 (n = 2) or placebo (n = 1) and re-
ceived study drug at least 48 h before the remaining subjects in the co-
hort were dosed. After the investigator had assessed that the infusions
were well tolerated, the remaining members of the cohort (VIS410
n = 4 and placebo n = 1) were dosed concurrently. Dose escalation
to the next dosing level occurred after the Safety Monitoring Committee
(SMC) comprised of the investigator, an independent medical monitor,
and the sponsor reviewed the safety data through Day 7 after the
infusion.
Assessment of safety by the SMC was determined from vital sign
measurements; physical examinations; hematology, chemistry, and uri-
nalysis laboratory testing; 12-lead triplicate electrocardiograms (ECGs);
use of concomitant medications; and review of adverse events (AEs).
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis and for assessment
of antidrug antibodies (ADA) to VIS410 were obtained before and
after the infusion during the 120-day study period (Days 1, 2, 3, 7,
14 ± 1, 28 ± 3, 56 ± 7, and 120 ± 7). Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, to
assess upper respiratory VIS410 concentrations, were collected before
148
A.M. Wollacott et al. / EBioMedicine 5 (2016) 147–155
 and after the infusion from subjects in the 15, 30, and 50 mg/kg cohorts
(Days 1, 3 and 7).
2.3. Pharmacokinetic and Antidrug Antibody Assays
Blood samples were collected at the time points indicated in Table
S6. Serum was aliquoted and stored at −20 °C to −80 °C. All samples
were tested for IgG antibody concentrations using an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay performed by Charles River Laboratories
(Senneville, QC). Nasopharyngeal swabs (one from each nostril) for
the analysis of the local concentration of VIS410 were taken using
COPAN flocked swabs from subjects in the 15, 30, and 50 mg/kg cohorts
at the time points indicated in Table S6. The swabs from each nostril
were combined in 1 transport tube containing 3 mL COPAN Universal
Transport Medium and stored at −70 °C. Samples were tested for
VIS410 by an immunoassay performed by Charles River Laboratories.
The samples for ADA analysis were collected in serum separator tubes.
Serum was aliquoted and stored at −20 °C to −80 °C. The enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay was performed by Charles River Laborato-
ries. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data between
groups. Statistical comparisons of the frequency of adverse events for
placebo versus VIS410 receiving subjects used Fisher's exact test. All
statistical analyses were conducted using SAS® software Version 9.3
(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC), and the PK analysis was conducted using
Phoenix WinNonlin® Version 6.2.1 (Pharsight Corporation, St Louis, MO).
2.4. Individual-Based Population Model
An individual-based microsimulation was developed based on a pre-
viously developed model (Boni et al., 2013), and is similar in structure
and design to an array of microsimulation models that have been devel-
oped over the past decade (Ferguson et al., 2005; Germann et al., 2006;
Longini et al., 2005). We used standard techniques in individual-based
microsimulation methods to test the population-level effects of
deploying VIS410 during a typical winter influenza A epidemic and to
perform sensitivity analyses on key unknown parameters.
Briefly, the model simulates an age-structured population of one
million individuals living in a city with 1,000 pre-defined neighbor-
hoods or locations. Daily work commutes, random within-city travel,
household structure, pre-existing immunity, and age-based social con-
tacts are included in the model. Influenza infection and potential hospi-
talization are modeled by randomly infecting individuals by location or
household, in proportion to the current level of infections and contacts
in that location or household. Infection, seasonality, contact structure,
hospitalization, and the clinical course and epidemiology of influenza
in the model were validated using characteristics of past influenza epi-
demics of influenza A (see supplemental materials).
In the microsimulation, VIS410 was deployed as a population-wide
prophylaxis strategy. A small percentage of individuals received
VIS410 prophylaxis (between 0% and 6%) in the early stages of the
epidemic, and two modes of distribution were included: randomly to
all individuals or randomly to only elderly individuals (N65 years old).
We varied the distribution time between eight weeks prior to the epi-
demic peak and the date of the modeled epidemic peak. VIS410 levels
in individuals were modeled using an exponential decay function,
with a half-life of 13 days. VIS410 was modeled to be administered at
a level that was 8-fold over a minimally protective dose of approximate-
ly 1–2 mg/kg based on preclinical estimates, corresponding to over 3
half-lives of protection. Levels of VIS410 over the protective threshold
confer a 90% reduction in the probability of being infected, with the pro-
tection decreasing exponentially as a function of VIS410 levels below
the minimally protective threshold. Levels of VIS410 below 0.1-fold of
the protective threshold were considered to be non-protective. This be-
havior is shown in Supplemental Figure S1.

 3. Results
VIS410 is an engineered human IgG1 antibody that targets a unique,
conserved conformational epitope on the stem of Influenza A virus HA
protein (Tharakaraman et al., 2015). Previous studies have identified
that VIS410 has broad reactivity against both group 1 and group 2 influ-
enza A strains and is effective against seasonal H1 and H3 influenza vi-
ruses as well as H7N9 virus (Baranovich et al., 2016).
A Phase 1, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study of VIS410
in healthy volunteers was initiated at a single site in North America. Five
cohorts were dosed with levels ranging from 2 to 50 mg/kg (Table 1). A
total of 41 subjects were enrolled in the phase 1 study. Overall, 36 sub-
jects (87.8%) completed the study and 5 subjects (12.2%) discontinued
early. All 41 subjects (100.0%) who received study drug (VIS410 or pla-
cebo) were included in the safety analysis set. All 30 subjects (100.0%)
who received a dose of VIS410 and had at least one evaluable PK param-
eter were included in the PK analysis set. Five subjects (12.2%) with-
drew consent (4 of 30 subjects [13.3%] who received VIS410 and 1 of
11 subjects [9.1%] who received placebo). For 1 subject (Subject 402;
30 mg/kg VIS410), the investigator was unblinded to the subject's treat-
ment due to serious adverse events (SAEs) of leukopenia and herpes
simplex esophagitis. This SAE was ultimately found to be unrelated to
the study drug as a primary herpes simplex virus type 1 infection was
confirmed based on analysis of pre and post event serology.
3.1. Safety Results
Overall, 27 of 41 subjects (65.9%) reported a total of 67 treatment
emergent adverse events (TEAEs). TEAEs were reported by 20 of 30 sub-
jects (66.7%) who received VIS410 and by 7 of 11 subjects (63.6%) who
received placebo. 18 of 41 subjects (43.9%) overall (16 of 30 subjects
[53.3%] who received VIS410 and 2 of 11 subjects [18.2%] who received
placebo; p N 0.05) experienced TEAEs related to study drug. 14 of 16
TEAEs related to study drug were considered mild (Grade 1) and 2
were moderate (Grade 2).
Overall, the highest percentage of subjects that reported TEAEs were
classified as nervous system disorders (11 subjects; 26.8%) followed by
gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and infections and infestations (10 sub-
jects; 24.4% each). The percentage of subjects reporting nervous system
disorders was similar following administration of VIS410 (7 of 30 sub-
jects; 23.3%) compared with placebo (4 of 11 subjects; 36.4%) and did
not reach statistical significance; no notable differences were observed
across VIS410 dose levels. Gastrointestinal disorders were reported by
subjects who received VIS410 only (10 of 30 subjects; 33.3% for
VIS410 receiving subjects, compared to 0% for placebo, p b 0.05). The
percentage of subjects reporting GI disorders was highest in the
50 mg/kg VIS410 cohort (5 of 6 subjects; 83.3%). The percentage of sub-
jects reporting infections and infestations was similar following
administration of VIS410 (6 of 30 subjects; 20.0%) compared with place-
bo (4 of 11 subjects; 36.4%); no notable differences were observed
across VIS410 dose levels (See Supplementary Tables S7 and S8).
Subjects who developed clinically significant upper respiratory infec-
tions had viral testing of their nasopharyngeal swabs by the site investiga-
tor for the duration of the study (Day 120). None were found to have
influenza although the 30 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg cohorts were dosed
from December 2014 to January 2015 where, based on state reported ep-
idemiology, there were high relative incidences of influenza A and other
respiratory virus infections (http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/idepc/
diseases/flu/stats/2014summary.pdf). A summary table of infections and
infestations lists the relevant infections and dose groups (See
Supplementary Table S10). The most frequently reported TEAEs overall
were diarrhea reported by 10 of 41 subjects (24.4%) and headache report-
ed by 8 of 41 subjects (19.5%). The most frequently reported drug-related
TEAE overall was diarrhea (9 of 41 subjects; 22.0%) that generally oc-
curred following infusion and spontaneously resolved within 24 h. Most
GI TEAEs were mild (Grade 1) with the exception of 2 subjects in the
50 mg/kg dose that had moderate (Grade 2) grading of their symptoms.
There were no subjects with SAEs that were related to study drug.
Approximately 3 weeks following infusion, a subject that received
30 mg/kg of VIS410 developed a primary HSV-1 infection with associat-
ed esophagitis and transient leukopenia. Based on serological data, the
HSV-1 infection was confirmed to be primary and given that the clinical
sequelae of HSV-1 were consistent with the clinical manifestations, the
SAE was considered to be unrelated to the study drug by the site
investigator. This subject resolved their leukopenia spontaneously and
resolved their esophagitis following treatment with valacyclovir admin-
istered by their treating physician. No subjects discontinued from the
study due to a TEAE, and all TEAEs resolved by the end of the study.
Overall, mean clinical laboratory results, vital sign measurements, and
ECG values observed after dosing were similar to baseline levels. Mean
changes from baseline were also similar across VIS410 dose levels, and
no apparent treatment- or dose-related trends were observed.
3.2. Pharmacokinetic Results
Mean AUC0–t, AUC0–∞, and Cmax for VIS410 increased approximately
proportional to dose (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Across the dose cohorts, mean
t1/2 values of VIS410 ranged between 250.72 and 376.38 h and median
Tmax values ranged between 1.92 and 3.50 h. The mean clearance values
of VIS410 ranged from 11.41 to 14.07 mL/h and mean volume of distri-
bution values ranged from 4914.4 to 6189.8 mL, across all of the doses
tested. We observed a dose proportional increase in the Cmax
for VIS410, which ranged from 58.6 μg/mL at a 2 mg/kg dose to
1316 μg/mL at a 50 mg/kg dose. Additionally, we examined PK samples
for the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA). Of note, no preexisting
ADAs were detected before administration of VIS410. We found that

 four subjects (three at 5 mg/ml and one at 15 mg/ml dose levels) devel-
oped low titer ADA, 120 days after administration of VIS410. Notably,
the presence of ADA did not alter drug PK as exclusion of ADA-
positive subject data from the analysis did not substantially affect calcu-
lated PK parameters, including half-life and drug exposure.
Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were collected for the 15, 30, and
50 mg/kg VIS410 treatment groups but not for the 2 and 5 mg/kg
groups. Following a single IV infusion of VIS410 over 120 min, across
the dose cohorts tested, NP VIS410 concentrations appeared to increase
with each increasing dose level, in a similar manner to serum Cmax levels
(Table 3 and Fig. 2). Mean NP VIS410 concentrations reached peak levels
within 24 h after dosing for all the dose cohorts tested and remained
measurable throughout the collection period. Mean NP VIS410 concen-
trations for the ADA-negative subset were comparable to the PK analy-
sis set demonstrating that the ADA status did not influence VIS410 NP
concentrations.
3.3. Modeling of Population-Level Benefits
Using the measured half-life and biodistribution information as
well as information on protective levels in animals, we sought to
model if a population-level prophylaxis strategy with VIS410 would
be able to reduce influenza burden during a single influenza A season.
The microsimulation results indicated that prophylaxis of even a small
percentage of the population can have a substantial impact on the
outcome of the epidemic as measured by the reduction in both attack
rates and hospitalization rates for the elderly. Simulations were carried
out for a range of temperate-zone influenza epidemic scenarios corre-
sponding to attack rates between 4.8% and 27%. Attack rates and hospi-
talization rates for the 3 coverage levels explored in this study are
shown in Table 4. For a prophylactic dose of 8-fold over a protective
threshold of 1–2 mg/kg, as estimated from preclinical prophylactic
experiments, and with administration initiated 0–8 weeks prior to
the epidemic peak, median reductions in attack rates from 50 simu-
lations were 8.6% (IQR: 4.7%–11.0%) for 2% coverage, 16.1% (IQR:
8.1%–20.9%) for 4% coverage, and 22.6% (IQR: 12.7%–30.0%) for 6%
coverage (Fig. 3a). The associated reductions in hospitalization of
the elderly were 8.8% (IQR: 4.9%–11.6%), 16.5% (IQR: 8.8%–21.9%)
and 22.9% (IQR: 13.0%–30.6%), respectively, for the three coverage
scenarios (Fig. 3c).
In addition to investigating coverage levels, we assessed whether ad-
ministration of VIS410 prophylaxis to the elderly would be an improve-
ment over general population administration. In the microsimulations,
general-population administration results in larger reductions in attack
rate than administration to the elderly alone, partially because of the na-
ture of social contacts by which individuals are more likely to associate
with those in their same age group. However, prophylaxis of elderly
populations was associated with a larger reduction in elderly hospitali-
zations than distribution to the population at large. The median reduc-
tions in N65 years old hospitalizations were 11.4% (IQR: 8.2%–13.3%)

 for 2% coverage, 21.6% (IQR: 17.4%–24.9%) for 4% coverage, and 30.9%
(IQR: 24.8%–35.1%) for 6% coverage when VIS410 was administered to
the elderly only. Hospitalization rate in the elderly is an important
outcome measure as this age group makes up the majority of influenza
hospitalizations and is particularly vulnerable to severe outcomes.
Hospitalization rates across all age groups differed by a small amount
(±4%) when comparing general-population prophylaxis to prophylaxis
of the elderly only (Fig. 3b). The impact of VIS410 prophylaxis on sea-
sonal influenza epidemics shown in Fig. 3 represents an aggregation
across a number of simulation variables (including severity of the epi-
demic, and date of administration of VIS410 relative to the date of
peak activity). When the analysis is restricted to a single epidemic
scenario, the effect of VIS410 on the severity of the epidemic is much
more pronounced (Supplemental Figure S5).
An additional critical parameter that had a large influence on attack
rates and hospitalizations was the timing of VIS410 deployment (Fig. 4).
For an influenza season of moderate intensity, in our model, administra-
tion of VIS410 four to eight weeks prior to peak prevalence resulted in a
reduction of hospitalizations of 34.3% (IQR: 31.9%–36.6%) for 6% cover-
age, but the impact on hospitalizations was more marginal when
administered zero to two weeks prior to the peak, with the reduction
of hospitalizations at 13.9% (IQR: 12.1%–15.4%). The absolute case re-
duction of a prophylaxis strategy is very sensitive to the individual pro-
tective period assumed for an administered dose of VIS410, which is
longer than 40 days in our model (Supplemental Figure S1). If prophy-
laxis is distributed too late, the majority of individuals will have already
been infected, but if given too early, the prophylactic effects of VIS410
administration would wane before the major part of the epidemic
wave passes through the population. Administration just prior to the
peak is not optimal for population prophylaxis. At this period, approxi-
mately 30–40% of the season's infections have already occurred, and the
opportunity is lost to protect individuals who become infected during
the early and slow phase of the epidemic.
4. Discussion
Influenza A remains a major public health threat based on seasonal
infections and the potential for pandemic infection. Broadly neutralizing
monoclonal antibodies such as VIS410 represent a potentially important
class of therapies. While vaccination remains the mainstay of public
health prophylactic strategies, we investigated whether passive pro-
phylaxis could provide a reasonable supplemental strategy, especially
for at-risk populations such as the elderly and immunocompromised,
who have suboptimal responses to seasonal vaccination. Given the cur-
rent state-of-the-art in the large-scale production of antibodies, it
should be possible to rapidly ensure availability of an adequate supply
of monoclonal antibody at a reasonable cost (Kelley, 2007) during an in-
fluenza season compared to production of a vaccine that must incorpo-
rate novel strains (generally N6 months).
We are initially developing VIS410 for the treatment of hospitalized
patients with influenza A for the following reasons. (Newton et al.,
2000) There are no approved treatments for hospitalized influenza pa-
tients, representing a large unmet need. (Schanzer et al., 2008) Admin-
istration of polyclonal antisera has demonstrated the ability to reduce
morbidity and mortality in this population (Hung et al., 2013). (http://
www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/us_flu-related_deaths.htm, n.d.) The
data from VIS410 in several preclinical models have demonstrated the

 ability to rapidly reduce viral titers by greater than one log10 and reduce
ARDS in lethal models of H7N9 (Baranovich et al., 2016). Pre-clinical
data in the ferret suggest that VIS410 can also prevent aerosol transmis-
sion of influenza (H1N1) despite its short half-life in this animal model
(Lakdawala et al., 2013). As demonstrated in this Phase 1 study, the rel-
atively safe profile of an antibody therapy enables dosing at high levels
through bolus administration that can potentially enable a more rapid
drop in viral loads compared to many small molecule therapies.
In this study, we sought to investigate whether VIS410 could be a
useful therapy and/or prophylactic countermeasure. To this end, we
demonstrate here that VIS410 is generally safe and well tolerated,
even at the relatively high dose levels of 30 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg. The
most common AE related to study drug was loose stool or diarrhea
(10 of 40 subjects; 24.4%). Most subjects had minor and transient
loose stool that resolved spontaneously. Two of the six subjects at the
highest dose of 50 mg/ml had moderate diarrhea with associated nau-
sea and vomiting that resolved within 6 h. None of the subjects with di-
arrhea had any clinically significant issues such as hypotension and
there were no associated laboratory abnormalities. The time of onset
and transient nature of these AEs suggest that they may be related to
an infusion reaction and options such as slowing infusion or pretreat-
ment can be explored in future development to further mitigate these
AEs. There is precedence for infusion reaction related GI events as previ-
ously observed in both IVIG therapy and licensed monoclonal antibod-
ies such as infliximab and appears to be related to mast cell activation
that correlates to the period around the Cmax phase of the initial infusion
(Gammagard Liquid, 2014; Kang and Saif, 2007; Remicade, 2011).
Serum PK was approximately dose proportional, and nasal PK of the tar-
get organ (nasopharyngeal/upper respiratory tract) demonstrated a
partitioning compared to serum of 1:53. ADA was observed at very
low levels in subjects treated with VIS410 (4 of 30). The presence of
ADA in response to treatment with IgG1 monoclonal antibodies such
as VIS410 is not unique and has been observed in marketed human
monoclonal antibodies such as adalimumab (Bartelds et al., 2011). If
ADAs were to have a clinically-relevant impact on efficacy, a change in
the PK of VIS410 would be expected as a result of ADA appearance.
However, this was not observed in any of the subjects with ADA.
While this was a small study in healthy volunteers, and ADAs will con-
tinue to be monitored thru the development program, these observa-
tions would suggest that an impact of ADAs on acute treatment or a
one-time prophylaxis of influenza is unlikely. However, it may be likely
that the 13% (4 of 30) of subjects who produced ADAs, upon re-
exposure to VIS410, would elicit a similar immune response and pro-
duce ADAs again. Because the time-course to elicit the ADA response
upon re-exposure and clinical significance of this hypothetical concern
is unknown, it would be difficult to speculate on the potential impact
that re-administration may have for VIS410 therapy either as a treat-
ment or prophylactic modality.
Given the phase 1 trial results, we sought to address a complemen-
tary question whether VIS410 could be successfully deployed in the
event of an epidemic outbreak to improve public health outcomes. We
predicted that given VIS410's half-life, its distribution to the primary
site of influenza A infection (nasopharynx) and its potency, that limited,
directed use of the agent would reduce the total burden of disease. We
note that universal prophylaxis is unlikely to be practical or feasible. To
test the hypothesis of the ability of VIS410 to reduce influenza disease
burden, we developed a micro-simulation of seasonal influenza that is
in good general agreement with observed attack rates. In multiple
scenarios, administration of a broadly neutralizing antibody like
VIS410 at an estimated dose of 8–16 mg/kg to the at-risk elderly, for ex-
ample in nursing homes and within the hospital, prior to the peak of an
influenza outbreak reduces the frequency of serious influenza. We find
that this effect can be achieved even with administration of VIS410 at a
relatively low coverage (between 2% and 6%), having a measurable im-
pact on mitigating hospitalization events in an influenza A outbreak.
Sensitivity analysis of the models indicates that timing of adminis-
tration may be a crucial component of the decision-making process for
the deployment of VIS410 as a prophylaxis. Our analysis suggests that
between four to eight weeks prior to an epidemic peak is the optimal
timing for deployment, and this is also dependent on the dose given
which determines the length of an individual's protective period. As re-
cently developed climate-based models have made influenza peak

overall hospitalization rate (b), and hospitalization rate in individuals older than
65 years of age (c) as a function of the population-level prophylaxis coverage. The
boxplots aggregate outcomes over time of administration and transmission setting, as
these epidemiological variables might in some cases be difficult to predict. The boxplots
for 0% coverage summarize 750 individual simulations, while the boxplots for 2% to 6%
coverage summarize 3750 simulations each. The yellow boxplots show results for
VIS410 administration to the elderly only, while the white boxplots show general
population VIS410 administration. The whiskers show the full range of outcomes, and
the median value is shown next to the median line of each boxplot. With one exception,
all pairwise comparisons between different coverage levels, when keeping the group
administration method fixed (“all” or “elderly only”), show a statistically significant
difference by the Mann–Whitney test (p = 0·002); the one exception is in panel A when
comparing no coverage to 2% coverage and distribution to the elderly only (significant at
p = 0·05). Note that in panel B, when comparing elderly versus general population
distribution, the Mann–Whitney p-values are p = 0·21 (2% coverage), p = 0·05 (4%
coverage), and p = 0·005 (6% coverage).

 forecasting possible with a four to six week lead time (Shaman et al.,
2013; Shaman and Karspeck, 2012), it may in fact be possible to have ac-
curate enough influenza prediction to begin the early roll-out of a pro-
phylaxis. One of the key challenges may be determining whether an
influenza season will be short or long, and the forecasting exercises
would need to be re-run with this exact scenario in mind: timed deploy-
ment of a population-level prophylactic whose aim is to stem transmis-
sion and reduce hospitalizations in the elderly.
Desirable outcomes for influenza public health interventions include
reductions in attack rates and hospitalizations across all age groups. For
hospitalization reductions in particular, it is usually not possible to pri-
oritize one age group over another, and for this reason there is a long
unresolved question in influenza about the age-targeting of public
health interventions — should high-contact or high-vulnerability indi-
viduals be targeted for intervention? Targeting high-contact individuals
may have a larger impact on mitigating the epidemic as a whole, includ-
ing larger attack-rate reductions in high-vulnerability individuals
(Fig. 3a). On the other hand, targeting high-vulnerability individuals
has a more direct and measurable impact on the individuals that receive
prophylaxis (Fig. 3c), and it may make it easier to argue for higher cov-
erage levels if it can be clearly seen that protection is highly efficacious
on an individual level.
The general indirect benefits seen in this population modeling exer-
cise are seen in all population-level analyses of public health interven-
tions for infectious disease. It is important to remember that the
precise outcomes from the population exercise come with many ca-
veats, including the geographic, demographic, and contact structure of
the population in question; individual variation in the protective period;
interaction between VIS410 therapy and acquisition/loss of influenza-
specific immunity; and the sometimes unpredictable shape of influenza
epidemics. For long-term effects of VIS410 as a public health strategy,
the relationship with immunity will need to be better understood.
One promising piece of preliminary information is that VIS410 targets
a non-immunodominant epitope. As such, in animals, there is no
measureable difference in the strength of the native immunological
response between infected, untreated animals, and infected VIS410-
treated animals. In both cases, re-challenge with the same virus results
in no infection due to a memory response. For short-term effects (single
epidemic season), it is likely that the general prophylaxis principles de-
scribed in this analysis will be robust to different characteristics of
temperate-zone influenza epidemics, but individual cities or states
will need to perform analyses and make decisions that are specific to
their populations and their past experience with influenza. Finally, an
additional consideration is that VIS410 targets only influenza A. In the
context of a complete prophylactic strategy employing a monoclonal
antibody or antibodies, coverage of influenza B is also anticipated to
be important.
In summary, based on the results presented here, we find that the
safety and pharmacokinetic profile of VIS410 possesses potential for not
only treating influenza A on an individual level but also as a public health
strategy to mitigate the effects of seasonal or pandemic influenza based
on its ability to reduce the overall burden of disease when strategically
administered in a vulnerable population. The findings from this study
warrant and require verification through well-controlled clinical trials.
