The safety profile of the herbicide glyphosate and its commercial formulations is contro-
versial. Reviews have been published by individuals who are consultants and employees 
of companies commercializing glyphosate-based herbicides in support of glyphosate’s 
reapproval by regulatory agencies. These authors conclude that glyphosate is safe at 
levels below regulatory permissible limits. In contrast, reviews conducted by academic 
scientists independent of industry report toxic effects below regulatory limits, as well as 
shortcomings of the current regulatory evaluation of risks associated with glyphosate 
exposures. Two authors in particular (Samsel and Seneff) have published a series of 
commentaries proposing that long-term exposure to glyphosate is responsible for many 
chronic diseases (including cancers, diabetes, neuropathies, obesity, asthma, infec-
tions, osteoporosis, infertility, and birth defects). The aim of this review is to examine 
the evidential basis for these claimed negative health effects and the mechanisms that 
are alleged to be at their basis. We found that these authors inappropriately employ 
a deductive reasoning approach based on syllogism. We found that their conclusions 
are not supported by the available scientific evidence. Thus, the mechanisms and vast 
range of conditions proposed to result from glyphosate toxicity presented by Samsel 
and Seneff in their commentaries are at best unsubstantiated theories, speculations, or 
simply incorrect. This misrepresentation of glyphosate’s toxicity misleads the public, the 
scientific community, and regulators. Although evidence exists that glyphosate-based 
herbicides are toxic below regulatory set safety limits, the arguments of Samsel and 
Seneff largely serve to distract rather than to give a rational direction to much needed 
future research investigating the toxicity of these pesticides, especially at levels of inges-
tion that are typical for human populations.

GLYPHOSATE: THE CONTROVERSY OVER ITS SAFETY
Glyphosate (N-phosphonomethyl glycine) is a small molecule (Figure 1), which acts as an herbi-
cide primarily by inhibiting the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), 
a key component of the shikimate pathway. Inhibition of the shikimate pathway blocks aromatic 
amino acid biosynthesis in plants, resulting in their death (1). Glyphosate was patented as an

herbicide in 1971 (US Patent No. 3799758). Upon its introduc-
tion as an herbicide commercially in 1974, glyphosate quickly 
became the leading pesticide in the global agrochemical market. 
Glyphosate sales and use has increased exponentially since 1996 
after the introduction of novel glyphosate-tolerant “Roundup-
Ready” crop varieties (namely, maize, soybean, canola, cotton, 
sugar beet, and alfalfa), which are genetically engineered to 
be sprayed with Roundup without dying (2). The ubiquity of 
glyphosate in food, water, and air means that it is ingested on 
a frequent basis and regularly found in human urine at levels 
around 1–10 µg/L (3).
The effects of glyphosate are well characterized at concentra-
tions and doses causing acute toxicity, with outcomes increasing 
over time and in a dose-dependent manner. Toxic effects on rat 
liver, measured after the administration of 60 mg/kg body weight/
day of glyphosate over 2 years, formed the basis for calculating the 
acceptable daily intake (0.3 mg/kg bw/day) within the European 
Union for the period 2002–2017 (4). However, data regarding 
health risks arising from ingestion of glyphosate alone at lower 
than the regulatory permitted daily intake, and which is relevant 
for human environmental levels of exposure, are far more limited 
and the subject of much debate (5).
As with any controversial topic, conclusions are not only 
driven by facts but can also be influenced by commercial or 
ideological vested interests. Several reviews have been pub-
lished by individuals who are consultants of companies com-
mercializing glyphosate-based herbicides (6–8) to facilitate 
the process of glyphosate’s reapproval by regulatory agencies. 
These authors conclude that glyphosate is safe at levels below 
regulatory permissible limits. In contrast, reviews conducted 
by independent scientists based on academia report toxic 
effects below regulatory limits (5), as well as shortcomings 
of the current regulatory evaluation of risks associated with 
glyphosate exposures (9, 10). Other authors have published 
reviews proposing that long-term exposure to glyphosate is 
responsible for many chronic diseases (cancers, neuropathies, 
infections, osteoporosis, etc.) (11–15).
These diverse points of view on glyphosate toxicity has led to 
extreme discrepancies in the scientific community, has given rise 
to confusion, and thus deserves clarification. Limitations and 
recommendations for improvement in the regulatory assessment 
of the risks to humans from exposure to glyphosate-based herbi-
cides have previously been extensively discussed (9, 10) and will 
not be detailed here. The aim of this review is to critically evaluate 
the scientific evidence presented in a series of commentaries used 
to conclude on the role of glyphosate in the etiology of chronic 
diseases (11–15).
The five commentaries by Samsel and Seneff propose a link 
between exposures to environmental levels of glyphosate and the 
development of a wide range of chronic diseases (11–15). In each 
commentary, these authors largely construct their arguments 
on deductive reasoning based on a logistic structure called syl-
logism, which is formed when two or more propositions are used 
in order to generate a conclusion. Although syllogisms can help 
in deductive reasoning, to ensure that they are used in science 
in a constructive rather than a misleading way, it is necessary to 
ensure that the two propositions that lead to the conclusion are 
firmly evidence-based. We therefore evaluated the Samsel and 
Seneff commentaries to see whether this was indeed the case.
CAN GLYPHOSATE INHIBITION OF 
CYTOCHROME P450 ENZYMES AND 
AROMATIC AMINO ACID BIOSYNTHESIS 
A CAuSE CHRONIC ILLNESS?
Their first commentary attempts to make a link between 
glyphosate ingestion and “most of the diseases and conditions 
associated with a Western diet” by suppression of the activity of 
the cytochrome P450 class of enzymes (CYP450) and amino acid 
biosynthesis by the gut microbiome (11). The claim that glypho-
sate inhibits the detoxifying CYP450 enzyme system is based 
on inferences from studies performed on plants or with other 
pesticides. However, even if some studies do show inhibition of 
CYP450 at high levels corresponding to agricultural use concen-
trations (typically 10 g/L of glyphosate), they are not relevant in 
terms of environmental exposures to which humans are typically 
exposed (approximately 0.1–1 μg/kg/day) (5). In addition, the 
authors fail to acknowledge the studies performed in mammals 
with environmentally relevant levels of Roundup (16), as well as 
studies on human cell cultures, which actually show an increase 
in CYP450 activity (17).
Some studies are misrepresented and misquoted in the com-
mentary. For example, the authors refer to a study reporting 
that the liver of male and female rats exposed to Roundup in 
their drinking water at glyphosate equivalent levels allowed for 
human consumption in the US (0.7 mg/L), showed a reduction 
in CYP450 enzyme levels (18). Samsel and Seneff conclude that 
this reduction in CYP450 is solely due to glyphosate ignoring 
the fact that Roundup, which contains a large spectrum of 
coformulant adjuvants was administered to the animals and not 
glyphosate alone. It is established that coformulant adjuvants 
are toxic in their own right resulting in commercial pesticide 
formulations being more toxic than the stated active ingredient

alone (19, 20). Thus, the coformulants may have been respon-
sible either alone or in combination with the glyphosate in the 
Roundup formulation tested for the observed decrease in rat 
liver CYP450 levels (18). In addition, the data presented by 
Larsen and colleagues clearly show that although the global 
CYP450 content decreased, the activities of the CYP450 enzyme 
complex in female animals increased (18). Overall, a review of 
the literature shows that glyphosate and Roundup are likely to 
increase the activity of CYP450, disproving the conclusions of 
this first commentary (14).
Samsel and Seneff also postulate that glyphosate disrupts the 
biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids by gut bacteria, based on 
a study showing a decrease in amino acid levels in a carrot cell 
line exposed to glyphosate (21). Although it can be hypothesized 
that glyphosate may disturb the gut microbiome because some 
bacteria possess the EPSPS enzyme and shikimate pathway, and 
thus may indirectly affect aromatic amino acid biosynthesis, 
this has never been studied in a controlled laboratory animal 
experiment. Indeed, the patenting of glyphosate as an antibiotic 
to be used against a wide spectrum of microorganisms was 
based solely on effects in protozoa (not bacteria) and its effec-
tiveness was dependent on the addition of di-carboxylic acids 
(US Patent No. 7771736 B2). At this stage, it is currently not 
clear whether glyphosate has an effect on the mammalian gut 
microbiome, especially at environmentally relevant levels of 
exposure. Nonetheless, some studies have shown that glyphosate 
and glyphosate-based herbicides such as Roundup can selec-
tively affect bacterial populations in vitro (22) while others have 
reported no adverse effects (23). Given these discrepancies addi-
tional research is clearly needed to ascertain whether glyphosate-
based herbicides at environmentally relevant levels of ingestion 
can result in disturbances in the gut microbiome of human and 
animal populations with negative health implications.
GLYPHOSATE LINKED WITH RISE IN 
NON-CELIAC GLuTEN SENSITIVITY 
(NCGS)?
The hypothesis of glyphosate-induced gut microbiome distur-
bances has led Samsel and Seneff in a second commentary (12) 
to propose that glyphosate is the most important causal factor in 
the epidemic of NCGS disease (24). Their arguments are based 
on the following syllogism. Since glyphosate could have effects 
on the gut microbiome and since NCGS disease is associated with 
imbalances in gut bacterial populations, glyphosate could fully 
explain the etiology of this condition. This syllogism is further 
extended by these authors by adding that NCGS disease patients 
have an increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
and reproductive problems such as infertility, miscarriages, and 
birth defects, and thus glyphosate could also explain the rise in 
these latter pathologies (12). Although there have been a number 
of studies showing an association between occupational glypho-
sate-based herbicide exposure and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
and reproductive problems including birth defects (25), a link 
between typical levels of human exposure and these conditions 
has not been demonstrated experimentally. It is true that rates 
of conditions of the gastrointestinal tract such as inflammatory 
bowel disease have dramatically increased with the adoption of 
Westernized diets (consumption of processed foods, high in ani-
mal protein, processed sugars, starches, and fats) (26). Exposure 
to increased levels of toxic chemical pollutants could be a crucial 
factor causing gut microbiome alterations and subsequent gas-
trointestinal disorders (27). However, a causative link between 
glyphosate and gut microbiome-associated intestinal disorders 
remains hypothetical but nonetheless an important area to be 
investigated.
IS GLYPHOSATE CHELATION OF 
MANGANESE A CAuSE OF CHRONIC 
ILLNESSES?
In their third commentary, Samsel and Seneff create multiple syl-
logisms based on the fact that glyphosate can chelate manganese 
(Mn) (13). At face value, there is merit in this supposition, since 
glyphosate was originally patented and used as a divalent cation 
metal chelator (US Patent No. 3160632A). These authors propose 
that the dysregulation of Mn homeostasis by glyphosate chelation 
could cause osteoporosis and osteomalacia (because bone min-
eralization depends on Mn), seizures (associated with reduced 
serum Mn), and prion diseases (since the prion protein, PrP, can 
misfold following binding to Mn instead of Cu). They also claim 
that large-scale environmental damage, such as the collapse of 
coral reefs, may in fact be due to glyphosate because coral mucus 
contains sulfated glycoproteins similar to chondroitin sulfate, 
whose synthesis is dependent on Mn. However, the conclusions 
from this commentary are speculative since the effects of glypho-
sate on metal micronutrient homeostasis have never been char-
acterized. Samsel and Seneff propose that glyphosate chelation of 
Mn can promote binding of this nutrient metal to PrP, causing 
it to misfold, and rendering it capable of catalyzing metal-free 
aggregation of this protein (28), which in turn could lead to prion 
disease. However, the sequestration of Mn by glyphosate would 
effectively make it unavailable to participate in interactions with 
other substances including proteins, making it unable to bind in 
place of Cu to PrP to promote misfolding and prion disease as 
suggested. Indeed, based on the arguments presented, chelation 
of Mn by glyphosate would be protective against, rather than a 
causative agent of, prion disease as this would prevent this diva-
lent cation from binding to PrP.
Out of the 328 references quoted in these authors’ third 
commentary (13), which are used to support their proposal of a 
link between Mn chelation by glyphosate and chronic diseases, 
only one study reports the effects of glyphosate on Mn levels in 
animals (29). This investigation looked at a possible connection 
between urinary concentrations of glyphosate and Mn, and health 
indicators in Danish dairy cows. The results revealed a correlation 
between markers indicative of a disturbance in kidney function 
and glyphosate urinary concentration; i.e., the higher the levels of 
glyphosate found in the urine, the greater the indicators of kidney 
dysfunction. However, although Mn levels were abnormally low, 
they were not correlated with urinary glyphosate levels. Although 
no doubt interesting additional studies are required to clarify

the mechanism of the observed low levels of Mn in these farm 
animals. Thus, this study (29) cannot be used to conclude on an 
effect of glyphosate on Mn homeostasis. The conclusions of the 
third commentary by Samsel and Seneff are thus unsupported 
by evidence.
IS GLYPHOSATE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
STEEP RISE IN CERTAIN CANCERS?
The fourth commentary by Samsel and Seneff discusses the ques-
tion of the carcinogenic potential of glyphosate (14). Conclusions 
are based on correlations between time trends in various cancers 
and glyphosate-based herbicide application on corn and soy crops. 
The reason given is that it appears that increasing cancer rates 
reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
from 1990 and 2010 parallel the dramatic increase in the volume 
of glyphosate-based herbicide application on these crops due to 
introduction of varieties in 1996 that are genetically engineered 
to tolerate being sprayed with this pesticide (2). Although it is 
surprising to see that the trends in increased glyphosate-based 
herbicide use and increasing incidence of certain cancers closely 
overlap, conclusions on a causative link between the two ignores 
two fundamental facts. First, the vast increase in the use of 
glyphosate-based herbicides due to expansion in the cultiva-
tion of glyphosate-tolerant genetically engineered crops did 
not become a substantial proportion of US agriculture until the 
turn of the century, with 66% of the total volume of glyphosate 
applied in the US from 1974 to 2014 taking place between 2004 
and 2014 (2). Thus, significant increases in exposure of human 
populations to glyphosate have also only occurred since the year 
2001. Second, it is well established that there is always a delay or 
lag period between exposure to a carcinogen and formation and 
detection of a cancer, with this delay varying depending on the 
type of cancer. Thus, the fact that increases in glyphosate-based 
herbicide use overlap with, for example, an increase in breast 
cancer incidence is more indicative of an absence of a connection 
rather than a link between the two phenomena. Thus, the increase 
in the use of glyphosate, and thus exposure to this compound, and 
the etiology of cancer are both out of step with the proposed link 
of this herbicide with cancer causation. In addition, cancer can be 
caused by a myriad of factors, some known and most unknown. 
Thus, statistical correlations of cancer incidence with exposure to 
a specific agent is insufficient to establish a causal link.
The known biology of cancer suggests that we look further 
back in history to identify the causative factors that have led to the 
steep increase in this class of diseases starting in the mid-1990s.
This fourth commentary (14) also discusses the World Health 
Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer 
(IARC) classification of glyphosate as a probable (Group 2A) 
human carcinogen (30). However, this IARC categorization of 
glyphosate has no bearing on, and thus cannot be used to sup-
port, the principal message of this commentary, which is that the 
increased incidence of some cancers has paralleled the escalation 
in use of glyphosate-based herbicides since the mid-1990s and 
thus suggests a causative link. The IARC assessment and scoring 
of glyphosate as a Group 2A carcinogen is based on sufficient 
evidence of carcinogenicity in animals (30), limited evidence 
of carcinogenicity in humans (increased rates of non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma in farmers) (30), and strong mechanistic evidence 
(genotoxicity and oxidative stress) (30).
CAN GLYPHOSATE SuBSTITuTE FOR 
GLYCINE IN POLYPEPTIDE CHAINS?
In their fifth and latest commentary, Samsel and Seneff pre-
sent what is arguably their most radical hypothesis regarding 
mechanisms of glyphosate toxicity (15). The core message of 
this publication is that glyphosate, being a derivative of glycine, 
can substitute for the native amino acid in proteins. Based on 
this supposition, it is postulated that such mis-incorporation 
of glyphosate in place of glycine can lead to polypeptide chain 
misfolding and aberrant cellular biochemistry that could lead 
to disease. By this mechanism, the authors argue a link between 
glyphosate exposure and an extremely large spectrum of disease 
conditions, including diabetes, obesity, asthma, chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease, pulmonary edema, adrenal insufficiency, 
hypothyroidism, Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral scle-
rosis, Parkinson’s disease, prion diseases, lupus, mitochondrial 
disease, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, neural tube defects, infertil-
ity, hypertension, glaucoma, osteoporosis, fatty liver disease, and 
kidney failure. However, a number of the conceptual and experi-
mental tenets used by Samsel and Seneff to assert that glyphosate 
can substitute for glycine in proteins are flawed.
First, Samsel and Seneff argue that since glyphosate can poten-
tially form N-substituted glycine polymers known as peptoids 
(31), then it can also replace glycine in regular polypeptides. 
However, as peptoids are laboratory creations that do not exist 
naturally in living organisms, it is not valid to extrapolate from 
these laboratory-manufactured entities to suggest that glyphosate 
can substitute for glycine in naturally occurring polypeptides, 
which are biosynthetically and structurally distinct from pep-
toids. In this context, it is perhaps also noteworthy that to the 
best of our knowledge, there are no reports of glyphosate peptoids 
having been generated.
Second, Samsel and Seneff quote in support of their argu-
ments results from studies conducted by scientists at DuPont, a 
company based in the US. The references provided [numbers 34 
and 35 in Samsel and Seneff (17)] are company reports dating 
back to 2007, which have not been published in the peer-reviewed 
scientific literature and thus are unavailable for scrutiny to verify 
the conclusions drawn from these investigations. Nevertheless, 
Samsel and Seneff make the following arguments, which they 
claim provide strong evidence of glyphosate’s incorporation into 
proteins in place of glycine. First, they state that only 42% of the 
radioactively labeled 14C-glyphosate administered to goats was 
extractable from muscle from these animals and that treatment 
with pepsin and an additional (undisclosed) protease did not 
release any additional 14C-glyphosate from this tissue. In their 
view, this suggests that the 14C-glyphosate had been incorporated 
into proteins and thus was non-extractable by the methods used. 
In addition, they state that to more fully release 14C-glyphosate 
from the liver, kidney, and omental fat of goats or the eggs of 
chickens fed with this substance, required treatment with 
pepsin, which again in their view suggests that the glyphosate 
 5

had been “incorporated” into proteins in place of glycine. These 
arguments not only ignore the apparent contradiction in their 
statements (pepsin/protease treatment of tissues does/does not 
lead to 14C-glyphosate release) but also a far simpler and more 
likely reason for these observations; i.e., the glyphosate was either 
adsorbed onto or trapped within protein structures/aggregates 
and is liberated upon protease digestion.
In contrast to the proposed notion that glyphosate can substi-
tute for glycine in polypeptide chains, it has recently been reported 
that a very high dose (200 mg/kg) of this compound administered 
to mice is metabolized by being cleaved into aminomethylphos-
phonic acid and glyoxylate (Figure 1), with the latter covalently 
modifying certain amino acids, for example, cysteine, within 
proteins (32). It is important to note that it is not glyphosate that 
is able to post-translationally modify proteins but its breakdown 
product glyoxylate. The very high, non-environmentally relevant 
dose administered is acknowledged by the authors of this study, 
who rightly conclude that the implications of their findings to 
human health are unknown.
It also needs to be borne in mind that the incorporation of 
glyphosate into proteins during translation would be in direct 
competition with glycine. Since the translation machinery has 
evolved to function with glycine and not glyphosate, then the 
incorporation of the latter into proteins would be, in all likelihood, 
a very inefficient process. Furthermore, if glyphosate were to be 
incorporated into proteins, causing them to become mis-folded, 
then these in most instances would be recognized as abnormal, 
resulting in their ubiquitination and degradation.
Finally, direct experimentation has shown that glyphosate 
does not incorporate into proteins (33). In these studies, E. coli 
were cultured in the presence of high concentrations (1 g/L) of 
glyphosate and rescued by addition of aromatic amino acids 
in the culture medium. Analysis of these bacteria showed that 
they possessed proteins with the exact same molecular weight 
as in non-exposed control cultures (33), demonstrating that 
glyphosate could not have been incorporated in place of glycine. 
Alternatively, the culture of E. coli in the presence of glyphosate 
and 6-fluorotryptophan resulted in polypeptides containing this 
variant aromatic amino acid and no incorporation of glyphosate 
(34). If glyphosate had been incorporated into the proteins of 
these bacteria, a shift in protein molecular weight would have 
occurred and would have been readily detectable by the sensitive 
and accurate mass spectroscopic analytical methods employed in 
these studies (33, 34).
In summary, the arguments used by Samsel and Seneff do not 
provide evidence for the substitution of glycine by glyphosate 
within proteins; on the contrary, there is good experimental 
evidence that implies that this does not take place.
DISCuSSION
Overall, a scrutiny of the method used in these commentaries 
by Samsel and Seneff reveals a major flaw. These authors employ 
a deductive reasoning approach based on syllogism, which is 
formed by two or more propositions used to generate a conclu-
sion. The first proposition is generally related to glyphosate’s 
properties (e.g., glyphosate is a chelator of Mn) and the second 
proposition is related to human physiology (e.g., sperm motil-
ity depends on Mn). From each of these pairs of propositions, 
Samsel and Seneff conclude a causative link of glyphosate with 
the etiology of different diseases. For instance, since glyphosate 
is a metal chelator (proposition 1), and since sperm motility 
depends on Mn (proposition 2), they conclude that glyphosate 
may partially explain increased rates of infertility and birth 
defects (13). They extend this reasoning to multiple body func-
tions to propose that the dysregulation of Mn utilization in the 
body due to glyphosate’s metal chelating properties explains 
autism, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, anxiety disor-
der, osteoporosis, inflammatory bowel disease, renal lithiasis, 
osteomalacia, cholestasis, thyroid dysfunction, and infertility. 
More recently, Beecham and Seneff have used the same reason-
ing to conclude on a causative link between glyphosate chelation 
of Mn and the large rise in the incidence of autism spectrum 
disorders in children within the US (35). However, there are no 
scientific studies establishing a causative link between glypho-
sate and the described chronic diseases.
Furthermore, again using the same syllogism structure meth-
odology Seneff and Nigh have suggested that the chelation by 
glyphosate of nutrient metals, specifically Zn and Co, could lead 
to developmental and metabolic disturbances that are responsible 
for increasing the risk of anencephaly (36). However, as in the 
case of Mn, there is no evidence to suggest that glyphosate at 
typical levels of daily ingestion disrupt Zn and Co homeostasis 
that could contribute to this increasing the risk of giving birth to 
an anencephalytic child.
Syllogisms can help in deductive reasoning, but they can 
also be used to form incorrect conclusions, which are known as 
syllogism fallacies. Thus, to ensure that syllogisms are used in 
a constructive rather than a misleading manner, it is necessary 
to ensure that the two propositions that lead to the conclusion 
are firmly evidence-based and make biological sense. Frequently 
quoted trivial but informative examples used to illustrate these 
points are “All men are mortal, Socrates is a man, therefore 
Socrates is mortal,” constitutes a meaningful syllogism whereas 
“All cats are mortal, Socrates is mortal, therefore Socrates is a cat” 
is clearly a syllogism fallacy! The syllogisms employed by Samsel 
and Seneff do not appear to have a solid evidential basis and thus 
could be considered misleading.
The underestimation of the toxicity of a commercialized 
product is known to have devastating effects on public health. 
Although it has long been asserted by both industry and regula-
tory agencies that glyphosate is safe even at relatively high daily 
intake levels (for example, 1.75 mg/kg bw/day in the US), 
major gaps in its evaluation have been identified and need to be 
addressed in order to definitely conclude on its safety (9, 10). For 
example, glyphosate has never been tested alone at its accept-
able daily intake or at doses relevant for human exposures. Only 
recently have studies been published that reveal kidney and 
especially liver structure and functional damage in rats follow-
ing chronic ingestion of an ultra-low, environmentally relevant 
dose of a glyphosate-based herbicide (Roundup) (37, 38). In 
addition, major endpoints of toxicity, such as developmental, 
reproductive, transgenerational, and even chronic effects in 
adults still need to be investigated under controlled laboratory

animal conditions, at environmentally relevant doses, using 
feed and water free from incidental glyphosate contamination. 
Indeed, most glyphosate toxicity studies have been performed 
without controlling for glyphosate contamination in food or 
water of laboratory animals used as “non-exposed” controls, 
even though this feed has been found to be regularly contami-
nated by glyphosate residues (39).
CONCLuSION
Our critical analysis of the commentaries published by Samsel 
and Seneff reveals that their conclusions are not substantiated 
by experimental evidence but are based on a type of failed logic 
known as syllogism fallacies. As Nobel Prize-winning theoretical 
physicist Richard Feynman famously said, “It doesn’t matter how 
beautiful your theory is, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. If 
it doesn’t agree with experiment, it’s wrong.” In this regard, the 
mechanisms and vast range of conditions proposed to result from 
glyphosate toxicity presented by Samsel and Seneff in their com-
mentaries are at best unsubstantiated theories or speculations that 
are not supported by experimental observation and thus are likely 
to be wrong. This misrepresentation of glyphosate’s toxicity could 
waste a large amount of time on the part of regulators, industry, 
and the concerned public, tying up resources that should be used
