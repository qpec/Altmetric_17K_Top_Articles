he ability to deliver therapeutic agents to specific disease sites 
with minimal distribution to normal tissues is crucial for the 
effective treatment of cancer1. Conventional chemotherapeutic 
drugs, although having considerable tumouricidal capability, often 
cause severe haematologic, hepatic and renal toxicity in patients, 
hindering the drugs’ clinical effectiveness2. The advent of targeted 
therapies such as small-molecule kinase inhibitors or monoclonal 
antibodies during the past two decades has shifted the paradigm for 
cancer treatment from non-specific cytotoxic regimens to selective, 
molecular-based therapeutics that aim to disrupt unique biochemi-
cal processes essential for tumour survival3,4. By selectively inhibit-
ing cancer-dependent molecular pathways that are non-essential in 
normal cells, the goal of these targeted therapies is to tailor treat-
ments (according to the molecular characteristics of the cancer) 
to the specific subsets of patients who are most likely to respond 
to the therapy, and to simultaneously minimize or eliminate treat-
ment-related toxicity5. Despite some successes of targeted therapies, 
challenges associated with intratumoural molecular heterogeneity, 
mutations that lead to drug resistance, and activation of alternative 
signalling pathways persist6. As a result, systemic chemotherapy 
remains the backbone of oncologic treatment. Improved strategies 
to deliver non-specific therapeutic drugs in a targeted manner are 
thus needed.
Because of the unique physical and chemical properties of nano-
particles, nanoparticle-based platforms have emerged as potential 
means of modifying the pharmacokinetic profiles of conventional 
chemotherapeutic agents and of selectively delivering high concen-
trations of cytotoxic compounds into tumours7,8. Nanoparticles, 
which can be synthesized with a large variety of formulations, can 
encapsulate anticancer drugs within their cores, and their sur-
faces can be modified to incorporate long-chain polymers such 
as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) or specialized coatings to drasti-
cally increase the circulatory half-life of the drug9 
–12. Targeting 
moieties including antibodies, peptides and recombinant proteins 
can also be attached to nanoparticles by various means to further

Two major obstacles facing cancer nanomedicine are the tendency of nanoparticles to be taken up by normal tissues and organs 
and the nanoparticles’ inability to efficiently penetrate solid tumours. Although substantial efforts have been made to improve 
the intratumoural delivery of nanotherapeutics, many strategies have failed to produce meaningful clinical benefits. Recent 
advances in the field of immuno-oncology have led to drugs that boost the host’s own immune system to fight cancer. In con-
trast to conventional therapies, which often target cancer cells, immunotherapies stimulate immune cells in ways that promote 
their recognition and the eradication of tumours. In this Perspective, we posit that this approach represents a new framework 
for cancer nanomedicine, and that immune-targeted nanomedicines could generate tumouricidal effects without the need to 
overcome the pathophysiological barriers that are intrinsic to the tumour microenvironment and that hinder nanoparticle deliv-
ery. The rational design of new immuno-oncology nanomedicines provides opportunities for developing the next generation of 
nanotherapeutics for cancer patients.
enhance their selective accumulation within tumour tissues13–15. 
In addition to the physiological benefits of cancer nanomedicine, 
the unique pathophysiological properties of solid tumours also 
provide opportunities for nanomedicine-based anticancer drug 
delivery16,17. Unlike normal tissues, solid tumours exhibit a mor-
phologically and functionally abnormal microenvironment. The 
hyperpermeability of vasculatures, combined with dysfunctional 
lymphatic drainage within tumours, can enhance the accumula-
tion of macromolecules within the tumour interstitium — a phe-
nomenon known as the enhanced permeability and retention 
(EPR) effect18–20. This pathophysiological property also enables 
nanoparticles to preferentially localize within tumours7,21,22. Over 
the past decade, extensive efforts have been undertaken to test 
nanomedicines of different sizes, shapes, compositions and with 
different surface coatings in mouse models of human cancers23–27. 
Although promising antitumour effects have been reported in 
some preclinical studies, only a limited number of nanomedicines 
are eventually tested in human subjects, and still fewer reach clini-
cal practice (Table 1). Growing evidence suggests that the delivery 
efficiency of nanomedicine into tumours remains suboptimal. This 
limitation is a key factor negatively influencing the clinical transla-
tion of cancer nanomedicine22,26,28.
In this Perspective, we discuss the progress made in the field of 
cancer nanomedicine with respect to intratumoural drug delivery, 
and present a new conceptual framework for the field. We argue 
that effective therapies may not require that nanoparticles enter 
the tumour per se; instead, drawing from recent successes in can-
cer immunotherapy, nanoparticles can be designed to prime anti-
tumour immunity far from the site of disease, so that the activated 
immune cells can then home to the tumour and exert their thera-
peutic effects. This represents a major deviation from the design 
approach of current cancer nanomedicine, where the goal has been 
to minimize the interactions of nanoparticles with the immune sys-
tem and to maximize nanoparticle delivery into tumours. We will 
also highlight progress made in the development of nanomedicines

to modulate immune responses and propose strategies for the 
design of nanomedicines for immuno-oncology.
Nanomedicine and the mononuclear phagocyte system
Nanomedicines systemically delivered via intravenous injection 
encounter numerous physiological barriers en route to the disease 
site22,26,28. The mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), a collection of 
phagocytic cells that resides within organs such as the liver, spleen, 
lymph nodes and bone marrow, sequesters nanoparticles as they 
travel through the systemic circulation (Fig. 1)29–31. The phago-
cytic process begins on initial contact of the nanoparticles with the 
bloodstream, where plasma proteins adsorb onto nanoparticle sur-
faces via opsonization, which marks them as foreign for recognition 
by phagocytes32,33. Proteins such as albumin, apolipoproteins, com-
plements and immunoglobulins are the most common opsonins 
that adsorb onto nanoparticles. These proteins, in combination 
with ions, form a ‘protein corona’34–36. The opsonized nanoparti-
cles are then recognized by specialized receptors, such as scavenger 
and complement receptors37,38, which are expressed on professional 
phagocytes. Extensive research efforts have been dedicated to the 
design of nanoparticle surface chemistries that reduce clearance by 
the MPS. A common technique is to functionalize the nanoparticle 
surface with PEG through a process called PEGylation9. PEGylated 
nanoparticles have prolonged circulatory half-lives because of the 
ability of PEG molecules to form a tight hydrating layer around the 
nanoparticle, hindering protein adsorption and subsequent uptake 
by phagocytes. PEGylated liposome nanoparticles have a circu-
latory half-life of several hours, compared with minutes for non-
PEGylated liposomes39. The stealth benefit of PEGylation varies for 
nanoparticles of different size and surface charge. Smaller nano-
particles seem to benefit most from PEGylation, and the increased 
chain length and density of surface-grafted PEG ligands also help 
nanoparticles to evade clearance by the MPS34,37. Interestingly, a 
recent study suggested that the stealth effect of PEGylation depends 
more on the specific proteins that are adsorbed onto the nanoparti-
cle surface than on the ability of PEG to reduce protein adsorption40.
Biomimetic strategies have also been explored to prolong nano-
particle circulation time, including the use of self-recognizing 
peptides10, erythrocytes41,42, leukocytes11,43, platelet-membrane coat-
ings15, and the loading of nanoparticles into tumour-tropic bacteria 
or cells44. Coating nanoparticles with self-recognizing peptides or 
recombinant protein CD47, which interacts with signal regulatory 
protein α (SIRPα) expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells to 
inhibit the cytoskeletal remodelling necessary for phagocytosis to 
occur45, can significantly reduce both the hepatic and splenic uptake 
of nanoparticles10. When injected into A549 tumour-bearing mice, 
CD47-coated nanoparticles loaded with chemotherapeutic agents 
showed a greater degree of intratumoural accumulation and an 
enhanced therapeutic benefit compared with that of non-coated 
nanoparticles10. Interestingly, reduced uptake of CD47-coated nan-
oparticles by macrophages depends strongly on the activation status 
of the macrophages; the influence of CD47 seemed to be stronger 
for polarized M1 macrophages than for M2 macrophages, thus sug-
gesting that cellular phenotypes, even when derived from the same 
lineage, can have unique roles in determining nanoparticle uptake37.
Renal clearance of nanomedicines
The renal system complements the role of the MPS in the clearance 
of nanoparticles from systemic circulation. In an average adult, the 
kidneys filter approximately 180 litres of fluid each day, or 60 times 
the entire plasma volume46. To undergo renal filtration, molecules 
and nanoparticles need to pass through the fenestrated endothe-
lium of the glomerular capillaries and basement membrane, and 
then through the epithelium formed by podocytes47. Size and sur-
face charge are two critical determinants for the renal clearance of 
nanoparticles48,49. Spherical nanoparticles with diameter less than 
6 nm are effectively filtered by the kidneys, but larger particles seem 
to be excluded from filtration. One important caveat is that these 
criteria for size-based exclusion from renal filtration may not apply 
to many cancer patients, who often also suffer from renal insuffi-
ciency owing to diabetic nephropathy or nephrotoxicity induced by 
systemic chemotherapies50. Accurate quantification of nanoparticle

filtration in these circumstances is essential to avoid excessive toxic-
ity or inadequate dosing.
Specialized physiological barriers
Specialized biological barriers within the body restrict the access of 
nanoparticles to certain organs. The best-known examples include 
the blood–brain barrier (BBB)51, which separates the systemic cir-
culation from the cerebrospinal compartment, and the blood–testis 
barrier52. These barriers can impede the delivery of therapies and 
form sanctuary sites for tumour cells. This is especially the case 
for macromolecules such as monoclonal antibodies and for nano-
particles designed for primary or metastatic tumours in the brain, 
where penetration into the central nervous system can be a chal-
lenge. Many strategies have been explored to improve the delivery 
of nanomedicines across the BBB, including attaching them to pep-
tides that penetrate the central nervous system, and coating nano-
particles with surfactants26,53–55. Mechanical disruption of the BBB 
with techniques such as pulsed ultrasound has produced promising 
results in early-phase clinical trials56. Nevertheless, most strategies 
are experimental at present, and nanoparticle delivery into these 
protected organ systems remains a major challenge.
The presence of specialized biological processes and physiologi-
cal barriers that can influence nanoparticle delivery also present a 
unique opportunity for the design of nanomedicines. Unlike con-
ventional therapeutics, where one formulation and a standard dose 
apply to all patients, nanomedicine allows researchers to design 
therapies that are patient-tailored. For example, larger nanoparticles 
can be used to formulate a cytotoxic cancer agent that minimizes 
renal toxicities by reducing nanoparticle filtration through the kid-
neys. Alternatively, smaller nanoparticles may be used to reduce 
hepatic accumulation of the same agent in patients with cirrhotic 
liver diseases.
Active and passive delivery of nanomedicines
Tumours have long been known for their tendency to preferentially 
take up and retain macromolecules20. The reasons for this phenom-
enon are numerous, but physiological abnormalities in tumour 
vasculatures (blood and lymphatic) play a major role57. In contrast 
to normal vasculatures, tumour vessels have highly irregular archi-
tectures and are largely dysfunctional when perfusing surrounding 
tissues18. This is the result of excessive pro-angiogenic signals within 
the tumour microenvironment, which collectively produce imma-
ture blood vessels that are heterogeneous, disorganized and leaky, 
with leakage resulting from large interendothelial cell junctions 
that are not properly covered by supporting pericytes. Histologic 
evaluations have shown that pores between interendothelial junc-
tions in some tumours can be up to a few micrometres in diameter, 
resulting in significantly higher vascular permeability and hydrau-
lic conductivity relative to normal tissues19,58, allowing macromol-
ecules and nanoparticles to extravasate more easily from the vessel 
lumen into the surrounding tissue spaces17. Once inside the tumour, 
the clearance of nanoparticles from the tumour parenchyma is 
severely reduced, owing to the impaired lymphatic flow caused by 
the elevated compressive forces exerted by the proliferating can-
cer and stromal cells and the condensed extracellular matrix59,60. 
These pathophysiological properties of the tumour microenviron-
ment form the mechanistic basis for the EPR effect and have been 
explored extensively over the past decade as a potential way to pas-
sively deliver nanomedicines into tumours (Fig. 2a).
Although passive targeting can lead to preferential accumulation 
of nanomedicines within tumours, it still has several major limita-
tions. First is the considerable vascular heterogeneity that is present 
even within a single tumour, which leads to non-uniform delivery 
of nanomedicines. Second, the EPR effect differs among tumours, 
depending on their vascularity. For example, highly vascularized 
tumours such as renal cell carcinoma exhibit a different degree of 
the EPR effect when compared with the poorly vascularized pan-
creatic adenocarcinoma61. Third, ubiquitous delivery of therapeu-
tic agents into tumours can result in uptake by unintended targets, 
which can reduce the agents’ therapeutic effectiveness against can-
cer cells and promote drug resistance62. These limitations can be 
overcome by actively targeting nanoparticles to tumour-associated 
receptors (Fig. 2b). By attaching recognition molecules onto nano-
particles, they can bind to specific cells of interest on entering the 
tumour7. Strong interactions between receptor and ligand mol-
ecules allow prolonged anchoring of the nanoparticle to the target 
cells or promote nanoparticle endocytosis followed by the release 
of the encapsulated drugs within intracellular compartments63,64. 
Additional strategies to further improve the therapeutic index of 
actively delivered nanomedicines include selecting tumour markers 
that are highly and preferentially expressed on cancer cells65, engi-
neering ligands with strong binding affinities to the intended tar-
gets66,67, and developing multivalent constructs that can enhance the 
overall binding avidity of nanoparticles by orders of magnitude68.
Improving nanomedicine delivery into tumours
The understanding that malignant cells exhibit distinctive genotypic 
and phenotypic characteristics has resulted in significant research 
efforts being directed towards the identification of molecules that can 
selectively recognize and bind to antigenic targets that are unique 
to cancers69. Monoclonal antibody-based therapy has been the most 
successful platform for several types of cancer69. At present, tumour-
associated antigens targeted by therapeutic antibodies include 
differentiation glycoproteins such as CD20, CD30 and CD33 for 
haematopoietic cancers, and growth-factor receptors such as epider-
mal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER2) for several types of solid tumour70–73. 
Immunoconjugates that rely on modifying antibodies with chemo-
therapeutics or radioisotopes have also been developed for refractory 
metastatic breast cancer74,75, yet the results have been mixed.
In light of these developments, a growing interest has been to 
combine antibody targeting with nanoparticle-based drug carriers 
Figure 1 | Systemically delivered nanoparticles are cleared from the 
bloodstream and accumulate in several tissues or organs before entering 
the tumour. Organs of the mononuclear phagocytic system such as the 
liver and the spleen, and to a certain extent the bone marrow, can entrap 
large amounts of blood-borne nanoparticles as they enter systemic 
circulation. Nanoparticles that are less than 6 nm in diameter may be 
filtered from the blood by the kidneys and excreted in the urine.

to achieve localized, specific delivery of anticancer agents7,28. The 
versatile surface chemistry of most nanoparticles enables the attach-
ment of antibodies, peptides, nucleic acids or even vitamins and car-
bohydrates to selectively transport and release encapsulated cargo in 
a controlled manner. By targeting different tumour markers, nano-
particles can selectively deliver loaded cytotoxic drugs, nucleic acids 
or radioisotopes to selectively eradicate tumour cells while causing 
minimal injuries to normal cells (Fig. 3a). Nanoparticles can further 
be designed to have therapeutic properties beyond drug delivery 
by modifying their geometry, material composition or ligand den-
sities (Fig. 3a)76. Nanoparticles can also be designed to target stro-
mal cells that are essential in supporting tumourigenesis77. Blood 
vessels, as the main supplier of nutrients and oxygen required for 
tumour growth, were identified early on as a potential target for 
cancer nanomedicine78,79. Indeed, different nanoparticle formula-
tions conjugated with the RGD (Arg–Gly–Asp) peptide have shown 
enhanced intratumoural delivery, as a result of the strong affinity of 
RGD for transmembrane αvβ3 integrin receptors, which are highly 
overexpressed in the activated tumour neoendothelium80. Other 
tumour-homing peptides that target vasculatures include modified 
RGD with a CendR motif and CREKA81,82. Beyond vascular target-
ing, nanoparticles have also been modified to recognize and bind to 
other stromal cells such as tumour-associated fibroblasts83, mononu-
clear cells such as tumour-associated macrophages84, or components 
of the extracellular matrix such as heparan sulfate, chondroitin sul-
fate and hyaluronan (Fig. 3b)7,85.
Because vascular dysfunction is a major limitation for molecu-
lar transport into solid tumours, normalization of the abnormal 
tumour vascular network was hypothesized to improve tissue per-
fusion and enhance nanoparticle delivery. Blockade of vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signals in different tumour mod-
els can restore blood vessels to more closely resemble those of nor-
mal vasculatures86. More importantly, these normalized vessels show 
improved perfusion, reduced interstitial fluid pressure, and deeper, 
more homogeneous delivery of macromolecules and nanoparticles 
into tumours87,88. Once nanoparticles are inside the tumour, they can 
be engineered to circumvent diffusional hindrance by the tumour 
matrix by becoming smaller in response to local stimuli as they 
enter the tumour microenvironment27. Alternatively, the tumour 
matrix can be normalized by pre-treatment with collagenase. 
Blocking transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signalling (which 
is critical to matrix remodelling) led to enhanced penetration and 
efficacy of polymeric micelles up to 100 nm in diameter in fibrotic 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma89. These tumour-microenvironment-
priming approaches thus provide a potential strategy to enhance the 
delivery of nanomedicines to tumours beyond what can be achieved 
with nanoparticle design.
Targeting steps along the immune cascade
Although during the past 10 years the focus of cancer nanomedicine 
has been on the direct therapeutic targeting of tumour or stromal 
cells, recent successes in cancer immunotherapy have provided new 
incentives to explore nanoparticles as immune-stimulating agents 
for eliciting antitumour responses90–94. In contrast to the delivery 
of conventional cytotoxic agents, where high concentrations are 
needed to eradicate all tumour cells, stimulation of a small fraction

of immune cells can elicit remarkable antitumour responses given 
the ability of these cells to rapidly expand and proliferate after 
being primed against tumour antigens. Moreover, adaptive immune 
responses generated against tumours are robust and possess unique 
‘memories’ that can prevent disease relapse. Researchers working in 
nanomedicine are thus beginning to explore how nanoparticles can 
be used to deliver immunostimulatory agents or designed to modu-
late specific immune-activation/inhibition pathways to enhance 
antitumour immunity.
Unlike conventional systemic therapies, cancer immunotherapy 
works to boost the host’s own immune system and enable it to detect, 
recognize and destroy malignant cells within the body95. Tumour 
immunity is the result of complex interactions between the innate and 
adaptive immune systems. On the one hand, innate immune cells, 
such as dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages and natural killer (NK) 
cells, use non-clonal receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), 
lectins or nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like recep-
tors (NLRs) to detect specific molecular patterns and recognize for-
eign pathogens. On the other hand, in the adaptive immune system, 
T and B cells have clonal receptors that specifically recognize non-
self or mutated antigens and their derived peptides90,96. The innate 
and adaptive immune systems are intricately connected via antigen 
presentation by professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such 
as DCs and macrophages, to naive T cells in lymph nodes (Fig. 4a). 
This process primes the naive T cells into a memory phenotype that 
has tumour-specific cytotoxic capability. Dying tumour cells release 
chemoattractants such as lipid lysophosphatidylcholine, sphingosine 
1-phosphate and CX3CL1, which recruit DCs and macrophages97. 
These phagocytes recognize membrane-bound receptors expressed 
by tumour cells (for example, calreticulin or phosphatidylserine), 
promoting their phagocytic uptake98,99. Antibodies against specific 
receptors on the tumour cells can also promote their uptake by phago-
cytes through the interaction of Fc receptors expressed on DCs and 
macrophages, or by promoting antibody-dependent cell-mediated 
toxicity mediated by NK cells (Fig. 4b)100. Unfortunately, cancer cells 
have developed numerous mechanisms to evade detection by innate 
immune cells. For example, CD47, a membrane protein that belongs 
to the integrin family, is overexpressed in several types of human 
cancer, and acts as a ‘don’t eat me’ signal to macrophages and DCs 
through its interaction with SIRPα, which is expressed on phago-
cytes101,102. Indeed, binding of CD47 to SIRPα inhibits cytoskeletal 
remodelling within the phagocytes, which prevents phagocytosis103.
To escape from adaptive immunity, tumour cells overexpress 
immune-suppressive ligands such as programmed death-ligand 1 
(PD-L1) or PD-L2 to inhibit T-cell proliferation and function104. 
Similarly, the interaction between galectin-9 and Tim-3 suppresses 
T-cell functions in multiple human cancers105. Cancer cells can 
also downregulate essential immune-activation signals, such as 
the expression of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), to 
evade detection by T cells106. New therapies may be able to enhance 
MHC expression by cancer cells, or to reprogram and engineer 
T cells to recognize tumour cells despite little MHC being present. 
Moreover, cancer cells can promote immune suppression indirectly 
through the recruitment of regulatory cells, such as myeloid-derived 
suppressive cells and regulatory T cells107,108. Tumour cells also 
modulate aspects of the microenvironment such as cytokine signal-
ling to reprogram immune effector cells into immune-suppressive 
phenotypes109, as occurs when tumour-associated macrophages are 
polarized from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory type110. 
These regulatory cells produce immune-suppressive cytokines such 
as interleukin (IL)-10 and TGF-β, express immune checkpoints 
such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), and 
downregulate immune-activating signals such as OX40L and CD40 
to further promote immune evasion by tumours111.
Although we have only highlighted a small fraction of the suppres-
sive mechanisms that cancers use to escape immune surveillance, 
these processes represent some of the most promising targets for 
designing nanomedicines for immuno-oncology. The complexity 
of immune-regulatory processes often requires the targeting of sev-
eral molecular pathways to achieve optimal responses. In this sense,

tumour-cell killing can be mediated by both conjugated and non-
conjugated nanoparticles. Nanoparticles can be conjugated to molecules 
(such as antibodies, peptides or protein ligands) that recognize specific 
tumour-cell markers. In contrast, non-conjugated nanoparticles bind to 
cancer cells non-specifically, often mediated by the interactions of serum 
proteins bound to the surface of these nanoparticles with tumour-cell 
surface receptors. Both conjugated and non-conjugated nanoparticles can 
enter cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis or cell-penetrating 
processes to deliver cytotoxic agents and/or nucleic acids, or to cause 
physical and biochemical disruptions in important cellular activities in 
order to promote antitumour effects. Compared with non-conjugated 
nanoparticles, conjugated nanomedicines often offer improved cancer-cell 
specificity with reduced normal-tissue toxicity. b, By targeting stromal cells 
within the tumour microenvironment, nanomedicines can ablate important 
supportive cells essential for cancer-cell survival. These cells include 
endothelial cells that line the tumour vasculature and tumour-associated 
macrophages. The two approaches can be combined to deplete pro-tumour 
stromal support and to generate direct tumouricidal activities for maximum 
therapeutic effect.

nanomedicine offers the advantage of simultaneous delivery of 
different immune-stimulatory or inhibitory agents. Nanoparticles 
can also offer protection from degradation or interference by the 
environment, as in the case of nucleic acid delivery to reprogram 
APCs or T cells112,113. Moreover, the intrinsic properties of nano-
particles allow them to be taken up rapidly by innate immune cells 
such as macrophages, and to accumulate within lymphoid tissues 
such as the spleen and bone marrow22,28. Although accumulation of 
nanoparticles within these organs has been deemed to be unfavour-
able because of the potential for long-term toxicity, the delivery of 
nanomedicines into these tissues may maximize their effect on sys-
temic immune activation. It is expected that the design of immune 
nanomedicines will shift significantly from conventional nanoparti-
cle design, in that the primary focus is not to completely escape the 
immune system but rather to properly engage it.
Nanomedicine for immuno-oncology
The initial rationale for cancer nanomedicine was to enhance the 
localized delivery of cytotoxic drugs within tumours while reducing 
the unintended accumulation of the drugs within normal tissues114. 
Although nanomedicine has had some successes in modifying the 
pharmacokinetics of conventional drugs, as in the case of nanoparti-
cle albumin-bound paclitaxel (Abraxane)115, tumour targeting with 
nanomedicines still faces many challenges. A recent meta-analysis 
of cancer nanomedicine articles published over the past 10 years 
concluded that, typically, only about 0.7% of the injected nanopar-
ticle dose reaches the tumour, and suggested that the low delivery 
efficiency of nanoparticles is a serious hindrance to the translation 
of cancer nanomedicine into the clinic28.
Recent developments in cancer immunotherapy provide oppor-
tunities to open a new frontier for the development of cancer nano-
medicine. The success of immune-checkpoint blockers such as 
anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies has led to the notion 
that effective cancer treatments may not necessarily require tumour 
targeting. These antibodies block inhibitory signals to T cells that 
promote immune evasion by tumours. Significant clinical benefit of 
their use has been observed in patients with metastatic and often 
treatment-refractory cancers such as melanoma116, non-small-
cell lung cancer91, renal cell cancer92, Merkel cell carcinoma94, 
mismatch-repair deficient colorectal cancer117 and Hodgkin lym-
phoma118. The anti-CTLA-4 antibody directly interferes with the 
interaction between APCs and T cells during T-cell priming in 
lymphoid tissues, and the anti-PD-1 antibody targets surface recep-
tors expressed on activated T cells90. These antibodies, especially the 
anti-CTLA-4 antibody, may not need to be distributed throughout 
the entire tumour to achieve a therapeutic effect, as the activated 
T cells from lymphoid tissue would home to the tumour to promote 
immune-mediated tumour eradication. This immuno-oncology 
approach deviates significantly from conventional cancer therapies 
or even therapies that target tumour-supporting cells such as those 
of the tumour-associated vasculature.
In light of these developments, it is worth considering how cancer 
nanomedicine might take advantage of similar mechanisms. Instead 
of trying to deliver nanoparticles carrying as much cytotoxic drug to 
kill as many cancer cells within a tumour as possible, we argue that 
it could also be beneficial to design nanomedicines that can help 
the immune system to better recognize and kill cancer cells (Fig. 5). 
Immune cells have the remarkable ability to penetrate many of the 
body’s native barriers such as the BBB and the blood–testis barrier, 
and immune-cell cytotoxicity is often highly targeted because of 
antigen-specific responses. Once activated, the immune system also 
possesses memory that would enable the continued production of 
effector T cells that can minimize the risk of tumour recurrence.
Several strategies for designing immune-based nanomedicines 
to target cancers have been explored (Fig. 6). In particular, viral 
proteins and nanoparticles delivering antigens have been used as 
cancer vaccines119–123. Proteins derived from viruses are inherently 
immunogenic, and nanoparticles can serve as a delivery vehicle to 
enable increased antigen access to professional APCs such as DCs 
or macrophages. Although both methods have shown some suc-
cess in animal models of human cancer, their limitations are also 
apparent. On the one hand, a potent immune response against a 
specific tumour antigen may eradicate tumour cells that express 
that particular mutant protein, but would be completely ineffec-
tive against tumour cells that either lack the protein or express a 
mutated version of it. On the other hand, immune stimulation by

cells or cellular debris by professional antigen-presenting cells such as 
dendritic cells (DCs) or macrophages results in antigen processing and 
presentation to T cells by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC; a). 
Cancer cells have several ways of inhibiting antitumour immune activation; 
for example, overexpressing anti-phagocytosis molecules such as CD47, 
releasing cytokines to inhibit DC maturation, and polarizing tumour-
associated macrophages into immune-suppressive phenotypes. The 
primed T cells then home to the tumour and recognize antigen-expressing 
tumour cells to elicit cytotoxic effects. Nanomedicines can be developed 
to target several steps along the immune-activation cascade. This includes 
targeting antigen-presenting cells by using tumour-derived antigens or 
nucleic acids as vaccines (a), promoting T-cell priming and activation by 
delivering inflammatory cytokines or by blocking antibodies or peptides, 
and enhancing natural killer (NK) antibody-dependent cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity (ADCC; b). Nanomedicines can also enhance T-cell priming 
and activation through the delivery of exogenous stimulatory signals, such 
as 4-1BB and glucocorticoid-induced tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-
related protein (GITR; a), by blocking co-inhibitory signals such as 
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4; a) and programmed 
cell death protein 1 (PD-1/PD-L1; b), or by inhibiting immune-suppressive 
functions of regulatory T cells (TReg cells) and myeloid-derived suppressor 
cells (MDSCs; b). TCR, T-cell receptor.

viral nanoparticles or nanoencapsulated antigens carries the risk of 
generating autoimmune responses through molecular mimicry of 
foreign peptides that can cross-react with self-epitopes124.
Moreover, nanoparticles can be designed to deliver nucleic acids 
to immune effector cells and to modulate their functions via both 
genetic and transcriptional manipulation (Fig. 6). For example, nano-
particles delivering RNA to DCs have led to the enhanced expres-
sion and presentation of tumour-specific antigens and subsequent 
T-cell priming, and thus to the production of potent antitumour 
responses112. Alternatively, the downregulation of specific genes 
within monocytes via nanoparticle-delivered siRNA can promote 
antitumour effects by altering the tumour immune microenviron-
ment125. As new genome-editing tools become available, nanopar-
ticles can provide a new and efficient delivery platform to induce 
precise gene editing126, with great potential for engineering immune 
cells that are better at detecting and eradicating tumour cells.
Unlike conventional cancer nanomedicines, nanomedicines 
that target immune cells within lymphoid tissues do not face the 
same pathophysiological barriers, such as those present in solid 
tumours. Instead, nanoparticles can be readily designed to prefer-
entially accumulate within the liver or spleen, where a large portion 
of professional phagocytes resides. How to deliver nanomedicines 
efficiently to different lymphoid tissues and to target them to spe-
cific immune-cell subsets represent new challenges and research 
opportunities for cancer nanomedicine.
Beyond acting as simple delivery vehicles for antigens or 
as immune-modulatory agents, nanomedicines can also be 
designed to promote antigen recognition and T-cell activation. 
Nanoparticle-based artificial APCs using both liposomes and 
biocompatible polymers have been explored to mimic the bio-
logical interactions between APCs and T cells, with promising 
results regarding the ability of such artificial APCs to activate 
T-cell responses127. Alternatively, biological nanoparticles such as 
exosomes — cell membrane vesicles 30–100 nm in size that are 
shed into the extracellular environment — are also being inves-
tigated as both carriers and biological modulators128. Because 
exosomes are involved in cell–cell communication through 
attached or encapsulated proteins and nucleic acids, they can be 
isolated from the extracellular fluid and loaded with therapeutic 
drugs. In addition, exosomes themselves are biologically active. 
For example, DC-derived exosomes (‘Dexo’) are fully equipped 
with the molecular machinery that supports their immunostimu-
latory functions. Dexo membranes are embedded with a variety of 
proteins that facilitate targeting, docking and fusion with recipi-
ent cells, including integrin, intercellular adhesion molecules, 
lactadherin, and the tetraspanins CD63, CD81 and CD9 (ref. 129). 
Dexo also expresses both class-I and class-II MHC molecules and 
the immune co-stimulatory ligand CD86, which help to facilitate 
T-cell activation functions130. Both preclinical and early-phase 
clinical trials of Dexo have shown promising results in generat-
ing antitumour immune responses131. A recently published phase-
II trial of Dexo loaded with interferon gamma (IFN-γ) did not 
reach its primary end point of 50% progression-free survival by 
4 months after chemotherapy for patients with inoperable non-
small-cell lung cancer, but demonstrated that IFN-γ-Dexo can 
activate NK cells through NKp30, a finding that warrants further 
investigation132. As the understanding of vesicle-based intercellu-
lar signalling improves, engineered exosomes remain an exciting 
component in the immuno 
therapy arsenal.
In addition to activating the immune system against tumour 
cells, nanomedicine can also be leveraged to reduce immune-sup-
pressive signalling mediated by the tumour microenvironment. 
Immune stimulatory molecules can be delivered and released in 
a highly controlled manner within tumours, and be combined 
with immune-checkpoint-blockade therapies to augment antitu-
mour immunity133. Similarly, nanoparticles can be engineered to 
selectively deliver nucleotide-based therapies to regulate myeloid 
cell activities134,135. A recent study showed that the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)-approved iron oxide nanoparticle feru-
moxytol has an intrinsic ability to polarize immune-suppressive 
tumour-associated macrophages into pro-inflammatory, antitu-
mour phenotypes. The re-programmed macrophages can inhibit 
tumour growth and prevent the formation of metastases in mice136. 
These findings represent an exciting new area for nanomedicine

to complement immuno-oncology, in that targeted ablation or re-
programming of immune-suppressive myeloid cells within tumours 
can synergize with immune-stimulating therapies to enhance over-
all response rates in cancer patients.
Outlook
One of the limitations of immune-based cancer therapy is that it 
often takes time for the immune system to become activated and 
to acquire the capacity to mount a sufficient antitumour response. 
This is certainly true for patients with advanced cancers; only those 
who can survive for more than 6 months are likely to benefit from 
treatments with immune-checkpoint inhibitors. In addition, the 
outcomes of cancer immunotherapy depend greatly on the indi-
vidual patient and the specific tumour type. Variations in a patient’s 
immune status, genetics (human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type) 
and environmental exposures such as gut microbiota status137,138, 
as well as tumour mutational burden139, vascularity and infiltrating 
T-cell profiles140, can greatly affect a patient’s response to immu-
notherapies. Indeed, only a small proportion (~20%) of patients 
with melanoma respond to anti-CTLA-4 antibody monotherapy93, 
and findings from recent phase-III trials supporting the benefit of 
anti-PD-1 agents for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung 
cancer with more than 50% PD-L1 expression (KEYNOTE-10, 
NCT02142738) but not for those with more than 5% PD-L1

expression (CheckMate-026, NCT02041533)141, emphasize the need 
for careful patient selection142. Hence, how to increase the response 
rates of cancer patients to cancer immunotherapies is an urgent yet 
unmet need. Also, the toxicity profiles of cancer immunotherapies 
are distinct from those of conventional cytotoxic agents, in which 
bone marrow suppression and hepatic and renal toxicity are most 
prevalent. Inflammation-based adverse reactions are more com-
mon among patients receiving immunotherapeutic drugs and can 
include severe dermatitis, colitis and hepatitis143. Therefore, design 
considerations for cancer immune nanomedicine would require a 
different set of preclinical and clinical considerations than those for 
its traditional counterparts.
Nevertheless, we believe that future nanomedicine developments 
can address many of the limitations of cancer immunotherapy and 
augment its antitumour effects. Cancer nanomedicine can provide a 
robust and versatile platform to more precisely deliver combination 
therapies to enhance the activities of immune effector cells while 
inhibiting the activities of immune-suppressor cells. Nanoparticles 
can also act as effective vehicles to enable both genomic as well as 
transcriptional editing of immune cells by protecting encapsulated 
nucleic acids from enzymatic degradation by the harsh tumour 
microenvironment. Going beyond simply acting as delivery vehi-
cles for tumour antigens or vaccines, the next generation of cancer 
immuno-nanomedicines should possess the unique ability to mod-
ulate the immune system to elicit specific antitumour responses. 
On a greater scale, cancer immuno-nanomedicine needs to stimu-
late both the innate and adaptive immune systems to achieve the 
greatest antitumour effect. This can be achieved through enhanced 
recognition of cancer cells by professional APCs, enhanced T-cell 
activation, reduced immune-suppressive signalling, and by geneti-
cally re-programming or engineering artificial APCs to specifically 
express tumour-specific antigens in order to promote antitumour 
immunity144–146. Accomplishing these tasks would greatly facilitate 
the integration of nanomedicine approaches in the design of next-
generation immunotherapeutics.
From a research and development perspective, the design of can-
cer immuno-nanomedicines will require a new mindset that departs 
from that for traditional approaches. Instead of focusing on design-
ing nanoparticles that can efficiently evade the immune system, the 
goal for immune nanomedicine is to selectively target the compo-
nents of the immune cascade of interest. Moreover, further studies 
of antitumour immune responses will certainly add to the com-
plexity of nanomedicine research studies, which traditionally have 
relied on using xenograft tumour models in immunocompromised 
mice. To assess immune responses will require the use of immu-
nocompetent syngeneic mouse tumour models, or preferably more 
clinically relevant patient-derived xenograft models established 
in mice reconstituted with a human immune system (humanized 
mice). Cancer immunotherapy represents the ultimate personalized 
approach to cancer treatment, as each individual’s immune status 
is truly unique. Therefore, patient considerations are essential for 
the initial development of the drug and for the design of clinical 
studies to identify potential target populations. Nanomedicine can 
play an integral and constructive part in the immuno-oncology 
revolution. Research efforts in developing sophisticated nanomedi-
cine platforms to regulate the immune system present a significant 
opportunity for nanomedicine to live up to its potential of helping 
cancer patients.
