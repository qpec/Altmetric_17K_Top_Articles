ABSTRACT
Background A strong focus on individual choice and behaviour informs interventions designed to reduce health inequalities in the UK. We
review evidence for wider mechanisms from a range of disciplines, demonstrate that they are not yet impacting on programmes, and argue for
their systematic inclusion in policy and research.
Methods We identified potential mechanisms relevant to health inequalities and their amelioration from different disciplines and analysed six
policy documents published between 1976 and 2010 using Bacchi’s ‘What’s the problem represented to be?’ framework for policy analysis.
Results We found substantial evidence of supra-individualistic and relational mechanisms relevant to health inequalities from sociology, history,
biology, neuroscience, philosophy and psychology. Policy documents sometimes expressed these mechanisms in policy rhetoric but rarely in
policy recommendations, which continue to focus on individual behaviour.
Discussion Current evidence points to the potential of systematically applying broader thinking about causal mechanisms, beyond individual
choice and responsibility, to the design, implementation and evaluation of policies to reduce health inequalities. We provide a set of questions
designed to enable critique of policy discussions and programmes to ensure that these wider mechanisms are considered.
Keywords dynamic and relational explanations, health inequalities, individualistic explanations
Introduction
Current UK policies designed to reduce health inequalities
through preventing non-communicable disease are based
largely on an individualistic epistemology. The dominant epi-
stemic assumption (i.e. the assumption about what constitutes
admissible evidence to guide action) in the implementation of
public health programmes is that human behaviour is a major
determinant of health, and that behaviour is largely a matter of
individual choice; individuals are therefore responsible for their
own health and for making health-related behaviour changes.
Reliance on such simple, linear causal explanations and of
proximal risk factors in the causes of disease has consistently
led to a focus on changing individual behaviour.1–6
We argue for a greater consideration of how more complex
relational and dynamic factors, beyond just the individual,
impact on health. A number of disciplines including sociology,7
history,8 biology,9 neuroscience,10 philosophy11 and psychology12
have produced evidence of potential mechanisms. The exist-
ence of interactions with place and social context, power, eco-
nomics, institutional relationships and biology, over time and
across generations have been widely cited.2,13–18 Developments
in biology include epigenetics9 and the neuropsychology of execu-
tive functioning;12 and both are highly relevant to understanding
how health inequalities are sustained. These remain largely outside
the purview of current policy interest.
While some of this evidence may sometimes find its way into
policy statements it is seldom realized in interventions.3,19,20

 The six documents chosen for analysis in the study demon-
strate that the main assumptions underpinning interventions to
address health inequalities have not changed significantly since
the mid-1970s, and remain focussed on individual responsibil-
ity. The policy interventions put forward reflect this partial
view of the totality of the evidence about the generation and
amelioration of health inequalities and the social patterning of
disease. We highlight this constancy and propose initial steps to
change the dominant view with an alternative approach.
We argue that the adoption of a dynamic, relational epistem-
ology is fundamental to a fuller realization of causal mechanisms
and for the design and implementation of more effective inter-
ventions to address health inequalities. The success of tobacco
control in the UK stems from its base in the dynamic and rela-
tional aspects of practices linked to tobacco consumption. This
includes, as well as individual choices, both the role of markets
and advertising, and explicit action to counteract ‘dirty tricks’ of
the tobacco industry over time. By dynamic we refer to changes
over time, and by relational we mean the need to consider the
relationships involved in the practice of smoking which go
beyond the individual just physically smoking a cigarette.
Three themes are central to this approach: ‘power’, in
exploring the relations between groups and between groups
and institutions in society; ‘history’, in investigating how rela-
tions change or are sustained over time; and the dynamic ‘rela-
tionship between the biological and the social’. We explore
these themes below.
We first identify evidence of the importance of relational and
dynamic factors in understanding the problem of health inequal-
ities. Second, we examine policy approaches over several dec-
ades concerning health inequalities, demonstrating the repeated
focus on individual behaviour change. Finally, we develop a set
of questions which highlight this broader perspective, to sensi-
tize policy-makers, service developers and researchers when
developing policies to address health inequalities.
Moving towards more dynamic thinking:
power, history and the relationship
between the biological and the social
Power
Health inequalities are seldom described in policy documents in
terms of power relations and competition for scarce resources
between classes, genders and ethnic groups, or the mechanistic
consequences of these power relations on biology. The idea of
‘empowering’ the individual to make healthier choices is a cen-
tral tenet of most policy proposals, but discussions of the
impact of power dynamics between groups and institutions are
overlooked, underplayed or ignored. The interactions and
intersections between different groups are essential to the pro-
duction of social structures and forms of inequality. Power is a
central part of these interactions, but individualistic forms of
analysis are poor at elucidating such dynamics. The focus on
individual lifestyles, for example, precludes any meaningful ana-
lysis of the power dynamics in which individuals are involved
and that, in turn, influence the types of choices they make.
Power relations are intrinsic to social life.21 At their most
basic, power relations affect people’s access to resources,
including health services, and determine the lived experience of
discrimination, disadvantage, bullying, harassment and social
exclusion. They influence educational and employment oppor-
tunities, including the type of work people are able to do and
their contracts of employment. The associations between these
things and their links to health inequalities have been known
for decades22 but the mechanisms of their direct impacts on
people’s lives have not featured in government policy docu-
ments. Of course, attempts to promote equality have been part
of government policy but these have tended to focus on pro-
tected characteristics rather than on the nature of the damaging
or health protecting nature of the relations themselves.23
Following Sen we should consider the degree to which health
policy and its implementation enhance the capacity for health,
for example.24
The historical perspective
Likewise, history and a longer time perspective are largely
absent from policy discussions of health inequalities. Insofar as
history appears it is in terms of a progressive narrative about
public health advances since the 19th century.25–27 There is a
form of institutional memory loss evident in policy where simi-
lar ideas are rediscovered and recycled over a relatively short
period of time,20 and policies demonstrate historical amnesia
about the processes which have led to contemporary health
inequalities. This leads to, for example, the assumption that
health inequalities can be explained by current societal condi-
tions alone and ignores endemic social arrangements which
persist over decades and longer. It leads to overoptimistic
expectations of performance of likely effective programmes,
with rapid payback being expected and public health initiatives
facing cuts if they do not produce results swiftly. An historical
perspective in policy and research informs a clearer understand-
ing of the longer-term intertwining causes, construction and
maintenance of health inequalities. According to Raadschelders,
all too often ‘History … is regarded as a ‘past’ that can be
recorded for its own sake but has little relevance to contempor-
ary challenges. This view of history is the product of a dimin-
ished and anemic sense of time, resulting from organizing the
past as a series of events that inexorably lead up to the present

 in a linear fashion’.28 We argue that bringing a historical per-
spective provides a richer understanding of causation that
recognizes the ‘layered’ nature of how the past leaves its mark
on the ways health inequalities are reproduced over time. This
perspective helps to illuminate the tools available to policy-
makers and the interventions which could have a lasting
impact.29–30
Social epidemiology has long shown recurring patterns of
health disadvantage geographically lasting generations in many
towns and cities in the UK. Notwithstanding policy efforts,
these patterns have remained stubbornly fixed. Generation on
generation, the consequences of the historical reproduction
patterns of health differences remain significantly unchanged.
It is no longer infectious disease that causes premature mortal-
ity in the poorer parts of the country, but non-communicable
disease. Absolute death rates are lower than the 19th century
but relative differences remain. Meanwhile policy is fixated on
simple behavioural solutions not on the reasons why the struc-
tural differences are so intractable.31
The biological and the social
Descriptions of the role of biology and its interplay with social
factors in producing population patterns of disease, was asso-
ciated originally with Engel32,33 and later with Barker.34–37 The
relationship across generations between the environment and
biological moderation of gene expression (epigenetics) is now
providing new evidence of interacting social and biological
mechanisms underlying the transgenerational transmission of
inequalities in health,2,38 leading to a re-consideration of cross-
generational effects on poor health and amelioration or
exacerbation through social conditions. It suggests a re-
emphasis on programmes to support maternal, foetal and child
health as a key strategy in breaking the cycle of inequality in
health.
Policy
We now turn to an examination of existing policy approaches
to addressing health inequalities. We review the extent to which
evidence of the mechanisms considered above are informing
policy recommendations.
We reviewed six key policy documents published by the UK
government or the English Department of Health between
1976 and 201025,27,39–42 using Bacchi’s ‘What’s the problem
represented to be?’ (WPR) framework for policy analysis
(Table 1).43,44 The interrogation of documents using this
framework allows for comparisons over time as well as the
development of an understanding of individual documents and
the assumptions which underpin policy rhetoric. This examin-
ation demonstrated a longstanding continued focus on individ-
ual behaviour in strategies to reduce health inequalities, and
more generally to prevent non-communicable disease (see
Table 2 for verbatim quotations from the policy documents45).
Successive documents did show increasing reference to the
impact of a wide range of factors on health (social, cultural,
economic and environmental). Nevertheless, these were rarely
then used for policy and intervention development or for the
evaluation of programmes; in both, individualism remained
paramount. For example, ‘Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation’
argued that ‘the causes of ill-health are many: a complex inter-
action between personal, social, economic and environmental
Table 1 Bacchi’s43,44 ‘What’s the problem represented to be?’ framework for policy analysis
Questions in the WPR framework
Aim of question
1. What is the ‘problem’ represented to be in a specific policy?
To understand how a phenomenon comes to be understood as a problem
in social policy (problematization), including the causes of the problem.
2. What presuppositions or assumptions underlie this representation of
the ‘problem’?
To understand the discursive practices surrounding the representation of the
problem (archaeology), i.e. what can and cannot be said about a problem.
3. How has this representation come about?
To understand the history (genealogy) of the development of understanding
of a problem.
4. What is left unproblematic in this problem representation?
To identify silences and highlight explanations which are not discussed and
to consider why these views might be excluded from this particular
representation of the problem.
5. What effects are produced by this representation of the ‘problem’?
To understand the creation of subjectivities produced by representations of
problems in policies: how individuals and population groups are
conceptualized.
6. How/where is this representation of the ‘problem’ produced,
disseminated and defended? How has it been (or could it be)
questioned, disrupted and replaced?
To identify where this representation of the problem has been reproduced,
including in other policy documents.

1. Prevention and
Health—Everybody’s
Business (1976)
Many of the current major problems in
prevention are related less to man’s
outside environment than to his own
personal behaviour; what might be
termed our lifestyle (p. 17)
Affluence is not an unqualified boon
and while it has certainly enabled us to
avoid some diseases, for example
those due to nutritional deficiency, it
has opened the door to others arising,
for instance, from unwise behaviour
and over-indulgence in one form or
another (p. 31)
Technological developments in
transport and communications, in
industry, and in the production and
marketing of food, are having an
effect for better or worse on people’s
health, whilst the physical environment
itself is undergoing changes in a
number of relevant ways (p. 31)
To a large extent though, it is clear
that the weight of responsibility for his
own state of health lies on the
shoulders of the individual himself.
The smoking related diseases,
alcoholism and other drug
dependencies, obesity and its
consequences, and the sexually
transmitted disease are among the
preventable problems of our time and
in relation to all of these the individual
must choose for himself (p. 38)
The key to prevention is often the
identification of ‘risk factors’ and thus
of ‘vulnerable groups’. A risk factor is
a characteristic of an individual which
has been found to be statistically
associated with a disease. Where such
an association is known to exist
between a characteristic and a disease,
the persons possessing this
characteristic are a vulnerable group
(p. 92)
There is much potential for prevention
in health education aimed at altering
people’s attitudes towards such things
as tobacco, alcohol and exercise—
persuading them in effect to invest in
their own health (p. 87)
2. The Health of the
Nation: A Strategy for
Health in England
(1992)
On behaviour—lifestyles—a balance of
action is needed. People cannot be
forced to behave sensibly in terms of
their smoking, eating, exercise, alcohol
or personal sexual habits. But efforts
can be made to ensure that when they
choose, they are exercising informed
choice in circumstances where this is
possible. (par. 3.4)
A number of key strategic policy
objectives and guiding principles
underpin the entire approach. They are
the need:…to recognize that as health
is determined by a whole range of
influences—from genetic inheritance,
through personal behaviour, family
and social circumstances to the
physical and social environment—so
opportunities and responsibilities for
action to improve health are widely
spread from individuals to Government
as a whole. (par. 2.6)
The reasons for these variations are
complex. The Government does not
believe there is any panacea—here or
elsewhere in the world either in terms
of a full explanation or a single action
which will eradicate the problem. But
neither difficulty is a reason for inertia.
Progress can be made on three fronts:
• first, through the continued general
pursuit of greater economic
prosperity and social wellbeing;
…there is considerable emphasis in
this document on the need for people
to change their behaviour— whether
on smoking, alcohol consumption,
exercise, diet, avoidance of accidents
and, with AIDS, sexual behaviour. The
reason is simple. We live in an age
where many of these main causes of
premature death and unnecessary
disease are related to how we live our
lives. (Foreword)
In framing action within key areas the
needs of specific groups of people
within the population must be
considered; the particular needs of
children, women, elderly people and
people in black and ethnic minority
groups and certain socio-economic
groups are also considered in the
appendix. (par. 2.15)
Government must ensure that
individuals have the necessary
information with which they can
exercise informed free choice.
Education is the key. Equally,
Government undertakes a variety of
measures designed to ensure that
people live in physical and social
circumstances where such free choice
is possible. (Foreword)
Everyone has a part to play in
improving health… To seize the
opportunity, people need information
to help make the right choices.
Reliable health education in its widest
sense is essential for this—pervading
education at school and also the many
sources of information for people
generally about health and its
determinants. (par. 3.8)
The reasons for these variations are by
no means fully understood. They are
likely to be the result of a complex
interplay of genetic, biological, social,

accounted for by differences in risk

3. Saving Lives: Our
Healthier Nation (1999)
The Government recognizes the
importance of individuals making their
own decisions about their own and
their families’ health. But we also
believe that there are steps we can
take to help support the decisions
people make. (par. 3.4)
Improving health means tackling the
causes of poor health. We know that
the causes of ill-health are many: a
complex interaction between personal,
social, economic and environmental
factors. (par. 1.21)
Individual behaviour is often vitally
important in improving, safeguarding
or damaging health. But poor health
can also spring from a complex
interaction between the genetic make-
up and behaviour of individuals and
social, economic and environmental
factors in the community. (par. 4.1)
How people live their lives—what they
eat, how active they are, whether they
smoke—is central to improving health.
Other factors, including people’s
education, employment, housing and
environment also play a key role. (par.
3.1)
Our modern approach is reflected in
the goals of this White Paper:
• to improve the health of the
population as a whole by increasing
the length of people’s lives and the
number of years people spend free
from illness; and
• to improve the health of the worst
off in society and to narrow the
health gap. (par. 1.17)
• And while death rates are
improving substantially for the best
off in society, the worst off have
not benefited to anything like the
same extent, thus widening the
health gap. (par. 6.1)
Government will play its part by
creating the right conditions for
individuals to make healthy decisions.
Across a range of Government policy,
we are focusing on the factors that
increase the likelihood of poor health
—poor housing, poverty,
unemployment, crime, poor education
and family breakdown. (par. 1.37)
Every day people are faced with
decisions in their daily lives, including
decisions which affect their health.
Sometimes they recognize that certain
decisions put their health at greater
risk than others. But it is not always
clear how great or small a risk they are
taking… We can help people to
understand better about risk. (par.
3.15-3.16)
In short, it is the role of the
Government to provide information
about risk. But in most cases it is for
the individual to decide whether to
take the risk. (par. 3.25)
Ten Tips For Better Health
• Don’t smoke. If you can, stop. If you
can’t, cut down.
• Follow a balanced diet with plenty
of fruit and vegetables.
• Keep physically active.
• Manage stress by, for example,
talking things through and making
time to relax.
• If you drink alcohol, do so in
moderation.
• Cover up in the sun, and protect
children from sunburn.
• Practise safer sex.
• Take up cancer screening
opportunities.
• Be safe on the roads: follow the
Highway Code.
• Learn the First Aid ABC— airways,
breathing, circulation.

 4. Tackling Health
Inequalities: A
Programme for Action
(2003)
Individuals also have to be responsible
for their own health and that of their
children by making appropriate and
informed lifestyle choices on smoking,
diet and exercise, all of which can
widen health inequalities. It is essential
that such choices should be informed
by clear and accurate advice. Schools
have a vital part to play while charities
and healthcare professionals, including
community pharmacists and dentists,
can advise how to quit smoking, offer
exercise on prescription, identify
patients at risk of heart disease and
provide services for substance
misusers. (par. 5.36)
Overall, health and life expectancy are
still linked to social circumstances and
childhood poverty. (par. 1.1)
The Government’s aim is to reduce
health inequalities by tackling the
wider determinants of health
inequalities, such as poverty, poor
educational outcomes, worklessness,
poor housing, homelessness and the
problems of disadvantaged
neighbourhoods. (par. 1.8)
The Acheson inquiry report
emphasized the need for effective
interventions to address the wider
influences on health inequalities.
Government departments have
contributed to progress in addressing
these determinants, such as improving
educational attainment and tackling
low basic skills, improving the quality
of poor housing, improving the
accessibility, punctuality, reliability and
use of local transport, tackling
worklessness and inactivity, and
improving access to social and
community facilities and services.
Regional Development Agencies
(RDAs) have been set up to act as the
strategic drivers of regional economic
development. (par. 3.34)
The challenge, therefore, will be to ensure that future improvements in health
over the next 20 years are shared by all. The widening health gap reflects
current realities. Experience has shown that the potential to generate and share
health gains across the population by preventive action—for example, by
targeting smoking and sedentary lifestyles—has yet to be fully realized. So
policies need to ensure that health gains are matched by a narrowing of the
health gap. (par. 1.5)
The reasons for these differences in
health are, in many cases, avoidable
and unjust—a consequence of
differences in opportunity, in access to
services, and material resources, as
well as differences in the lifestyle
choices of individuals. Unfortunately,
the effects can be passed on from
generation to generation. (par. 1.4)
Generally, the more affluent people
are, the better will be their health;
conversely, the poorer people are the
worse will be their health. But there
are wide differences among social
groups. This Programme for Action
does not, therefore, just address the
most disadvantaged groups and areas.
It also addresses the needs of a large
part of the population as well as those
of socially deprived groups. (par. 1.3)
5. Choosing Health:
Making Healthy
Choices Easier (2004)
Choosing health sets out how we will
work to provide more of the
opportunities, support and information
people want to enable them to choose
health. It aims to inform and
encourage people as individuals, and
to help shape the commercial and
cultural environment we live in so that
it is easier to choose a healthy lifestyle.
(Foreword by Tony Blair)

health is not enough on its own;
people need to be able to make
People who are disabled or suffer from
mental ill health, stretched for money,

immediate priorities. They are often less

of everyday choices about diet, exercise,

Many of the initiatives in this White
Paper will be targeted first at

least well-developed and most
progress is needed. (Chapter 1 par.

healthy choices more accessible to

will be measured first in the increased
number of healthy choices that
individuals make, and then in the lives
saved, lengthened and improved in
quality. (Preface by John Reid, Health
Secretary)

6. Healthy Lives,
Healthy People (2010)
We need a new approach that
empowers individuals to make healthy
choices and gives communities the
tools to address their own, particular
needs. (Foreword)
We are all strongly influenced by the
people around us, our families, the
communities we live in and social
norms. Our social and cognitive
development, self-esteem, confidence,
personal resilience and wellbeing are
affected by a wide range of influences
throughout life, such as the
environment we live in, the place in
which we work and our local
community. This impacts on our health
and our life chances. (par. 1.13)
Wider factors that shape the health
and wellbeing of individuals, families
and local communities—such as
education, employment and the
environment—also need to be
addressed in order to tackle health
inequalities. (par. 2.4)
Our causes of premature death are
dominated by ‘diseases of lifestyle’,
where smoking, unhealthy diet, excess
alcohol consumption and sedentary
lifestyles are contributory factors. (par.
1.2)
When it comes to improving people’s
health and wellbeing, we need a
different approach. We cannot just
ban everything, lecture people or
deliver initiatives to the public. This is
not justified and will not work. Nor
should we have one-size-fits-all
policies that often leave the poorest in
our society to struggle. (par. 2.28)
This includes changing social norms
and default options so that healthier
choices are easier for people to make.
There is significant scope to use
approaches that harness the latest
techniques of behavioural science to
do this—nudging people in the right
direction rather than banning or
significantly restricting their choices.
(par. 2.34)
To meet the challenges set out in
earlier chapters, the Secretary of State
for Health intends to create a new
public health system in England to
protect and improve the public’s
health, improving the health of the
poorest, fastest. (par 4.1)
Our health and wellbeing is influenced
by a wide range of factors—social,
cultural, economic, psychological and
environmental—across our lives. These
change as we progress through the
key transition points in life—from
infancy and childhood, through our
teenage years, to adulthood, working
life, retirement and the end of life.
Even before conception and through
pregnancy, social, biological and
genetic factors accumulate to
influence the health of the baby. (par.
1.12)

 factors’ (Table 2, 3B). Yet the main approach offered to redu-
cing health inequalities focused on ensuring individuals are
informed about risks to their health as ‘in most cases it is for
the individual to decide whether to take the risk’ (Table 2, 3E).
The responsibility falls to the individual to make the least or
less risky decision. Here and elsewhere there is a ‘disconnect’
between policy rhetoric about causes and recommended
remedial actions.
Evidence about the wider determinants of health is used to
justify interventions on health inequalities, which then paradox-
ically concentrate on individual behaviour. Rather than addres-
sing the wider determinants themselves, certain groups are
viewed as lacking the capacity to negotiate successfully the
effects of these determinants, demonstrated by their proclivity
for making unhealthy choices. Thus, a number of interventions
focus on the provision of opportunities to enable individuals to
improve their current social and economic situation through,
for example, education, training and work opportunities.41 A
common argument is that by embracing such opportunities
people will have more control over their lives, which would
result in them being more interested in their health and there-
fore more likely to make healthy choices.42 The idea of the indi-
vidual as a chooser dominates these discussions.45 This idea
shapes the understanding of the problem as one of individuals,
in themselves, being incapable of making healthy choices unless
steered by interventions which change their attributes as indivi-
duals who will then change their behaviours. The result has
been described as ‘lifestyle drift’46 in policy measures and ‘life-
style push’ from politicians and markets.20
This focus on the individual effectively neutralizes the effects
of social context and airbrushes out of the picture a number of
important contextual agents and institutions—specifically the
state, markets and industry. So the state and its retreat from
interventionism consequent on neo-liberal economic thinking,
the role of markets (as a cause of rather than a solution to the
problem), and the (incidental) health damaging roles of the
food, advertising and alcohol industries are conveniently put to
one side.47 Actions addressing these actors and getting them to
change are not central to contemporary policy focus. The alter-
native view that the State has a duty to enable as far as possible
everyone to have a fair opportunity to live a healthy life and
that governments should try to remove inequalities that affect
disadvantaged groups or individuals, including a duty of pro-
portionate regulation, has not always been a dominant motif in
policy documents.23,48 Following Sen, among others, we would
emphasize the importance of addressing how public and pri-
vate actions and organizations shape the capability of indivi-
duals to make positive choices regarding their health.49
For example, obesity as a significant public health threat and
an important cause of health inequalities has become engrained
in policy discourse in the last decade and a half.19 Numerous
policy documents and a raft of guidance have been produced
on the topic, including the recent 2016 childhood obesity strat-
egy.19,50,51 Yet success in curbing obesity has been minimal.
This is despite compelling evidence that an obesogenic envir-
onment is generating the obesity epidemic,15,50 and that its
structure and dynamics should be the target for arresting the
epidemic. Policy solutions have persistently focused on prox-
imal determinants, most prominently individual diet and exer-
cise.52 Similarly with alcohol consumption, the focus remains
on individual capability and how to ensure individuals make
healthy choices,4,53 reinforced by statements by ministers past
and present.54
A most important exception to this perspective was the
Foresight report on ‘Tackling Obesities’, commissioned by the
Government Office for Science and published in 2007. The
report presented evidence demonstrating the social and bio-
logical complexity of obesity, and emphasized the need to
intervene beyond individuals into processes of governance
and decision-making to stem rising obesity and the necessity
of evaluation: ‘The deceptively simple issue of encouraging
physical activity and modifying dietary habits, in reality, raises
complex social and economic questions about the need to
reshape public policy in food production, food manufacturing,
healthcare, retail, education, culture and trade’.15 The mid-
term review of the Report at 3 years drew attention to ‘stake-
holder inertia in adopting more accurately informed perspec-
tives of the roles of the individual and of society (which) can
hinder the development of strategies and interventions to man-
age the current and future obesity epidemic’. Implementation of
the report was terminated long before effects could be appro-
priately evaluated.
There are a small number of other examples where what we
refer to as a relational approach has found its way into the pub-
lic domain. For example the NICE Public Health Guidelines
on Community Engagement,55 Social and Emotional Wellbeing
of Children,56,57 Healthy Working Conditions,58 Preventing
Harmful Drinking59 and Preventing Cardiovascular Disease.60
Not only were these exceptions, but also in the case of the
Cardiovascular Disease and Harmful Drinking guidelines they
were rejected by Ministers. One of the implications of the
focus on individuals and on behaviour change is that it pushes
policy interest towards proximal risk factors (which the NICE
Guidelines did not) and the role of these in the aetiology of
non-communicable disease in particular. However, knowledge
about risk and its links to behaviour in causal pathways of dis-
ease do not on their own provide any solutions as to how to
change those things. For example, knowledge about the dan-
gers of exposure to cigarette smoke or alcohol suggests that
reducing exposure would be beneficial, but does not explain

 how to achieve that. A focus on the dynamics of the sys-
tems involved in the relations between industry, markets,
advertising, human preferences, group behaviour, as well as
the individual actor provides a richer theoretical frame for
developing
and
evaluating
integrated
programmes
to
address the problem. This has been the case with the suc-
cess of tobacco control in the UK. We advocate a similar
‘how to’ approach with respect to obesity, alcohol and phys-
ical activity.31
Discussion
Main finding of this study
We have highlighted extensive cross-disciplinary evidence about
the relational nature of health inequalities, and causal mechan-
isms beyond individual choice and responsibility. We have
shown that this evidence rarely follows through to preventive
programmes.
What is already known on this topic
Health inequalities persist in the UK driven largely by the social
patterning
of
non-communicable
disease.
Interventions
designed to reduce health inequalities are still primarily shaped
by a focus on individual behaviour. Yet, there is substantial evi-
dence of supra-individualistic and relational mechanisms rele-
vant to health inequalities from a range of disciplines including
sociology, history, biology, neuroscience, philosophy and psych-
ology. This evidence is not yet applied systematically in policy
or action, where it may inform the design and implementation
of more effective policies.
What this study adds
A perspective recognizing the complexity of the systems in
which public health must practice, including its politics, shifts
us away from narrowly focussed linear behaviour change mod-
els to a focus on reflexive systems and the power of players in
those systems.61–65 Prioritizing the study of relationships
Table 3 Questions to use in the formulation and critique of policies to address health inequalities
Questions to consider when developing policy recommendations to address
health inequality
Aim of questions
Inclusion of wider determinants
1. Are proximal risk factors used as the primary justification for solutions
to address health inequalities?
To highlight the type of evidence being used to justify solutions and to
identify any gaps particularly around wider determinants of health.
2. Is evidence included relating to the influence of the wider
determinants of health?
Evidence over time
3. Have the recommended approaches to addressing health inequalities
appeared in policy documents in the last 2, 5, 10 and 15 years?
To consider previous attempts to address health inequalities; to highlight
that this is a problem with a long history rather than a contemporary issue;
and to draw attention to both evidence of effect/non-effect and lack of
testing over time.
4. Have these approaches shown cost-effectiveness in formal studies
over sufficient time intervals?
Causal pathways and mechanisms of action
5. Are there clear steps from identification of a cause of the problem to
actionable interventions?
To ensure that factors listed as contributing to health inequalities are
adequately addressed through causal pathways. Policies should include a
guide to implementation of interventions in order to move from rhetoric to
action.
6. Are the mechanisms of action of the recommended intervention
described?
Social context and power
7. Are the recommendations grounded in the social and economic
contexts of everyday life?
To draw attention to the importance of social context in enabling or
restricting change, and to the nature of power.
8. How are the relationships between the state, industry, civil society
and individuals taken account of in explanations for health inequality
and proposals for action?
History and biology
9. What evidence of historical social conditions have been used in the
analysis?
To emphasise the importance of the dynamism of the problem of health
inequalities from a historical perspective; and to acknowledge the interface
between the social and the biological.
10. Are there any considerations of the relationships between social and
biological processes?

 between people and groups of people, how these relationships
are sustained and change over time, and acknowledging links
between power, time and the biological and social, we suggest
will bring into the discourse a wider perspective to complement
the existing focus on individual behaviour change.
In order to move towards integrating this thinking into pol-
icy considerations, we have developed a set of questions to use
in writing and critiquing policy papers, which aim to ensure
that proposed interventions to address health inequalities take
into account relational and dynamic factors, as well as individ-
ual behaviour (Table 3). These questions can be used not only
by policy-makers and service developers but also by academic
researchers to ensure that relational and dynamic factors are
brought to the forefront of policy evaluation.
Limitations of this study
This is not a comprehensive or systematic review of all docu-
ments relating to English policy recommendations to address
health inequalities.
Conclusion
Current policies dominating efforts to reduce health inequalities
through prevention of non-communicable disease target indi-
vidual behaviour change and have not worked well. We have
argued that an individualistic epistemology limits their impact.
Programmes predominantly focus on individual behaviour
change foregrounding individual choice and responsibility.
There exists strong and extensive evidence that interconnecting
and interacting factors, beyond the individual, impact on health
including place, context, power, economics, institutional rela-
tionships and biology, over time and across generations. The
existence of such evidence, however, has not been sufficient to
garner policy action even when existing strategies have failed to
successfully address health inequalities. We propose a list of
questions that researchers and policy-makers can use when
writing or critiquing policy in order to bring this broader per-
spective to the forefront of their analysis of the problem. This
is one small step in moving from the rhetoric of whole systems
interventions to long-term intervention and evaluation and
towards broadening the range of approaches and evidence we
use to unpack the problems of health inequalities and work
towards policies to address them.
