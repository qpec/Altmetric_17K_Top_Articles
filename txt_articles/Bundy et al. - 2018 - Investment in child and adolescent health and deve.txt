INTRODUCTION
Almost every country in the world has a national school 
feeding program to provide daily snacks or meals to 
school-attending children and adolescents. The interven-
tions reach an estimated 368 million children and ado-
lescents globally. The total investment in the intervention 
is projected to be as much as US$75 billion annually 
(WFP 2013), largely from government budgets. 
School feeding may contribute to multiple objectives, 
including social safety nets, education, nutrition, health, 
and local agriculture. Its contribution to education 
objectives is well recognized and documented, while its 
role as a social safety net was underscored following the 
food and fuel crises of 2007 and 2008 (Bundy and others 
2009). In terms of health and nutrition, school feeding 
contributes to the continuum of development by build-
ing on investments made earlier in the life course, 
including maternal and infant health interventions and 
early child development interventions (see chapter 7 in 
this volume, Alderman and others 2017). School feeding 
may also help leverage global efforts to enhance the 
inclusiveness of education for out-of-school children, 
adolescent girls, and disabled persons, as called for in the 
Sustainable Development Goals (see chapter 17 in this 
volume, Graham and others 2017). 
Although the Disease Control Priorities series focuses 
on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), evidence 
from high-income countries (HICs) is included because 
of the near universality of school feeding and the insights 
that inclusion can provide as economies develop. For 
example, the design of school feeding in countries under-
going the nutrition transition1 may provide some lessons 
on how to shift from providing access to sufficient calo-
ries to promoting healthful diets and dietary behaviors 
for children and adolescents (WFP 2013).
Agricultural development has increasingly gained 
attention. It is clear that to enable the transition to sus-
tainable, scalable government-run programs, the inclu-
sion of the agricultural sector is essential (Bundy and 
others 2009; Drake and others 2016). Accounting for 
the full benefits of school feeding through cost- 
effectiveness and benefit-cost analysis is challenging, 
similar to other complex interventions, but undertaking 
this accounting is critical for assessing the tradeoffs with 
competing investments. 
This chapter reviews the evidence about how school 
feeding meets these objectives and provides some indi-
cation of costs in relation to benefits. The costs of the 
intervention are well established; estimates that 
encompass all the benefits of school feeding are more 
 
challenging. The benefits must be quantified and 
translated to the same unit to allow for aggregation. 
Moreover, how school feeding interventions are 
designed and implemented varies significantly across

countries. Given that delivery of school feeding often 
involves multiple sectors, common policy frameworks 
and cross-sectoral coordination are required to achieve 
maximum benefit (Bundy and others 2009). 
Several other chapters in the volume highlight school 
feeding. These include chapter 11 (Lassi, Moin, and 
Bhutta 2017), chapter 20 (Bundy and others 2017), 
chapter 22 (Plaut and others 2017), and chapter 25 
(Fernandes and Aurino 2017). 
THE GLOBAL PICTURE
Almost all countries practice school feeding (Bundy and 
others 2009); about one of three primary and lower- 
secondary schoolchildren benefit, although the number 
of children varies markedly across countries (figure 12.1). 
Approximately 18 percent of schoolchildren in low- 
income countries (LICs) received school meals in 2012, 
compared with 49 percent in upper-middle-income 
countries (WFP 2013). On the basis of global estimates 
of coverage and investment, the authors estimate that an 
additional investment of US$1.7 billion is needed to sup-
port the increase in program coverage in 23 LICs to the 
levels of upper-middle-income countries—the equiva-
lent of 2 percent to 3 percent of total global investment 
in school feeding and a 10 percent increase in total bene-
ficiaries.2 India’s Mid-Day Meal Scheme is the largest 
national school feeding program in the world, serving an 
estimated 113.8 million children each day (Drake and 
others 2016). Brazil’s national program, the next largest, 
provides daily meals to more than 43 million children 
(Drake and others 2016). China’s National Nutrition 
Improvement Plan provided school meals to 33.5 million 
children ages 7–15 years across China in 2015 (Liu 2016).
School feeding interventions, most notably imple-
mentation modalities of delivery, vary across countries. 
School feeding may include hot meals, biscuits, or 
snacks provided in school or as take-home rations, 
where the households of schoolchildren receive a regu-
lar commodity ration on meeting conditions, such as 
regular attendance. School feeding programs vary in 
targeting. School meals may be provided free and at 
reduced, subsidized, or full price. Countries that follow 
a rights-based approach, such as Brazil and India, pro-
vide free school meals to all children in certain age 
groups. In most LMICs, however, free school meals are 
targeted geographically to areas with high prevalence of 
food insecurity and poverty, or individually, based on 
conditions of vulnerability, such as those in orphanages 
or disadvantaged households (WFP 2013).
School feeding programs have evolved with levels of 
development. Many HICs, such as the United States, 
introduced school feeding programs in the first half of 
the twentieth century as welfare interventions and to 
support agricultural markets. More recently, countries 
such as Brazil have systematically incorporated school 
feeding procurement with agriculture development 
interventions. In contrast, national school feeding pro-
grams in many LMICs were introduced more recently,

with education as the primary objective (Bundy and 
others 2009) or as a means of social protection in face of 
crises, given that experience has shown they are relatively 
easy to scale up during emergencies (Alderman and 
Bundy 2011). From 2000 to 2012, at least eight LICs 
launched school feeding programs—six in Sub-Saharan 
Africa—within the broader framework of the Education 
for All agenda (WFP 2013). Some of this growth may be 
due to the inclusion of homegrown school feeding, an 
approach that sources foods for school meals from local 
producers or markets, under the food security pillar of 
the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development 
Programme of 2003 (NEPAD 2003). The number of 
homegrown school feeding programs has grown steadily 
in Sub-Saharan Africa since that time (GCNF 2014). 
THE EVIDENCE FOR EFFECTIVENESS
This section reviews the large evidence base highlight-
ing the effectiveness of school feeding for multiple 
outcomes. The evidence suggests that school feeding is 
a social protection tool that can contribute to educa-
tion, nutrition, health, and agricultural objectives 
supporting child and adolescent development (Bundy 
and others 2009; Jomaa, McDonnell, and Probart 
2011). Figure 12.2 presents ways school feeding can 
affect these outcomes. Homegrown school feeding may 
also contribute to agricultural development, but not 
enough evidence exists yet to be incorporated in this 
review, although box 12.1 presents specific examples.
Design and Implementation Issues
Characteristics such as age, gender, and level of disadvan-
tage may modify the strength of some of these pathways 
(Kristjansson and others 2009). Moreover, external fac-
tors, such as the quality of school inputs, may confound 
the overall impact of school feeding (Adelman, Gilligan, 
and Lehrer 2008; Greenhalgh, Kristjansson, and Robinson 
2007; Kristjansson and others 2009; chapter 22 in this 
volume, Plaut and others 2017; Watkins and others 2015).

affect the results. The key issues that can be reflected in the 
process indicators include consistency of implementation 
of the intervention over the entire study period, compli-
ance of beneficiaries with the intervention, adequacy of 
energy transferred, duration of the study, and palatabil-
ity (Greenhalgh, Kristjansson, and Robinson 2007). 
To illustrate this point, table 12.1 presents a selec-
tion of parameters for nationally led school feeding 
programs in 15 countries (Drake and others 2016). 
Ration design is key, particularly for assessing the 
quality of the meals and the potential link to local 
agriculture. The number of school days may enhance 
the nutritional impact of school feeding, as well as the 
educational impact, while also influencing the imple-
mentation costs.
It is important to understand not only whether school 
feeding is effective but also the causal chain according to 
which impact is achieved, which is context specific. This 
is an important area for further research (Greenhalgh, 
Kristjansson, and Robinson 2007). More rigorous design 
evaluations are also needed on government- 
led school 
feeding programs, given that the bulk of such evidence is 
based on school feeding implemented by the World Food 
Programme (WFP), which may be considerably differ-
ent. For example, WFP school feeding rations typically 
include a basic set of foods, such as multifortified corn-
soy blend, sugar, and salt, which are internationally pro-
cured, in contrast with the rations presented in table 12.1. 
Benchmarking School Feeding Programs across 
Countries
School feeding programs across countries can be bench-
marked using the Systems Assessment for Better Education 
Results (SABER) tool, which is structured around five 
pillars (Bundy and others 2009; Drake and others 2016): 
• Policy frameworks
• Institutional capacity and coordination
• Budget and financing
• Design and implementation
• Community participation.
A national school feeding policy can contribute to 
sustainability and integration with other policy priorities.

Homegrown School Feeding: Supporting Local Agriculture
The O’Meals program in Nigeria (Osun State 
Elementary School Feeding and Health Programme) 
is viewed as a means to combat hunger, increase pri-
mary school enrollment, and encourage local and 
statewide economic growth. The program provides 
hot, nutritionally balanced school meals daily to 
more than 252,000 primary schoolchildren. At the 
same time, it provides employment and income 
to thousands of local caterers, farmers, and trad-
ers, which may indirectly improve their health. 
Recently, the menu replaced yam with the more- 
nutritious cocoyam, and organizers are investigating 
the introduction of orange-fleshed sweet potato 
(Drake and others 2016). 
In Ghana, preliminary evidence from an impact 
evaluation of homegrown school feeding suggests 
sizable gains with regard to income from sales of 
produce and increases in farming households’ agri-
cultural incomes (Aurino and others 2016).

at the national, regional, and local levels are needed, par-
ticularly across different ministries. Channels for 
financing the program and the implementers, for exam-
ple, payments to caterers, need to be defined. Communities 
must be engaged in the program; their contributions, 
such as firewood, condiments, and meal preparation, 
may be needed.
Social Protection
School feeding provides a transfer to households in 
the value of food distributed (Alderman and Bundy 
2011). This transfer can reduce a household’s food 
needs; when provided regularly over the school year, it 
smooths volatility, thereby increasing disposable 
income to meet other immediate needs or invest-
ments. A range of outcomes is possible, including 
better nutrition. A quasi-experimental design analysis 
found that India’s school feeding program mitigated 
the effects of drought on physical growth, which had 
occurred earlier in the lives of the beneficiaries (Singh, 
Park, and Dercon 2014). In response to the food and 
fuel price crises of 2007–08, at least 38 LMICs scaled 
up school feeding programs, in recognition of its 
potential as a social safety net (WFP 2013). A global 
review of social safety net programs found that school 
feeding was one of the largest in estimated number of 
beneficiaries (World Bank 2014; also see chapter 8 in 
this volume, Watkins and others 2017). 
Several factors determine the effectiveness of school 
feeding as a social protection tool. One factor is targeting 
the poorest and most vulnerable households and com-
munities (Alderman and Bundy 2011). The efficiency of 
geographic targeting is conditioned by the degree to 
which poverty and food insecurity are concentrated in 
one or multiple areas, as well as the smallest geographic 
unit at which targeting can be applied. Poor accessibility 
to these areas and insufficient infrastructure to deliver 
school feeding may present barriers. An evaluation from 
the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) indi-
cated that, because of similar barriers, only one-half to 
two-thirds of schools eligible for school feeding in select 
districts actually received school feeding (Buttenheim, 
Alderman, and Friedman 2011). Rising urban poverty 
and income inequality may justify individual or 
school-targeting approaches, although care must be 
taken to ensure that food provided in targeted schools 
does not inadvertently draw students from nearby 
schools receiving no food. Moreover, individual target-
ing may be challenging if some children in a classroom 
receive food while other children do not.
A review of eight social protection programs in Latin 
America and the Caribbean found that school feeding 
focused on the most disadvantaged households in most 
countries. However, in some countries such as Guatemala 
where the poorest children do not attend school, school 
feeding was less well targeted (Lindert, Skoufias, and 
Shapiro 2006). We replicated Lindert, Skoufias, and 
Shapiro (2006) by using data from Malawi, Tanzania, 
and Uganda. The share of households in the lowest 
income quintile were more likely to receive school meals, 
with the largest population share evident in Tanzania 
(figure 12.3). 
In Ghana, the Ministry of Employment and Social 
Welfare, in a review of targeting in the national school 
feeding program in 2010, found that higher investment 
was not consistently made in districts with greater pov-
erty and food insecurity (WFP 2013). The program was 
retargeted in 2012. 
Education
School feeding can promote access to education, as mea-
sured by indicators such as enrollment, attendance, and 
retention (Krishnaratne, White, and Carpenter 2013). 
Evidence for these links helped identify school feeding 
as a means for contributing to the Millennium 
Development Goal 2 of universal enrollment in primary 
education. Given the links between nutrition status and 
cognition, school feeding programs, if integrated with 
interventions to improve education quality, can also 
contribute to learning and academic achievement 
(Adelman, Gilligan, and Lehrer 2008; Krishnaratne, 
White, and Carpenter 2013). Moreover, school feeding 
may directly or indirectly reduce gender disparities in 
education outcomes. The following section reviews the 
evidence, giving greater weight to systematic reviews

and studies with rigorous designs, such as randomized 
controlled trials. 
Access to Education
A review of rigorously designed studies indicated a stan-
dardized effect size of 0.156 for enrollment (p < 0.05, three 
studies), 0.449 for drop-out (p < 0.001, two studies), and 
0.690 for progression (p < 0.001, one study) (Krishnaratne, 
White, and Carpenter 2013). The review did not find 
statistically significant effects on attendance and learning, 
although the coefficients were positive (Krishnaratne, 
White, and Carpenter 2013). In addition to providing an 
incentive to attend school, evidence indicates that school 
feeding reduces absenteeism. A review of studies from 
multiple LMICs found that school feeding was associated 
with an average of four to six more days attendance at 
school per year (Kristjansson and others 2009).
The choice of modality may also play an important 
role. For example, Afridi, Barooah, and Somanathan 
(2014) showed that monthly attendance increases in 
response to a switch to a cooked meal from snacks, with 
modest increases in the state budget in India. Fortified 
biscuits in Bangladesh improved school enrollment by 
14.2 percent, reduced the probability of drop out by 
7.5 percent, and raised attendance by about 1.3 days a 
month (Ahmed 2004). Adelman, Gilligan, and Lehrer 
(2012) in Northern Uganda, and Kazianga, de Walque, 
and Alderman (2009) in Burkina Faso found that both 
school meals and take-home rations effectively increased 
enrollment. Ahmed and del Ninno (2002) showed that 
take-home rations for poor households in rural Bangladesh 
increased school access, with an 8 percent increase in 
school enrollment and 12 percent increase in attendance.
Moreover, the evidence suggests that school feeding 
can mitigate gender disparities in school enrollment 
where girls face greater barriers (Gelli, Meir, and Espejo 
2007). In particular, the provision of take-home rations 
to girls can represent a significant income transfer to 
households, outweighing the forgone benefits of nonat-
tendance (Bundy and others 2009). The WFP experience 
suggests that making provision of take-home rations 
conditional on attendance rates of more than 80 percent 
was effective, especially in low-resource communities 
where child labor is common (WFP 2013). In Burkina 
Faso, the provision of school meals or monthly take-
home rations of 10 kilograms of cereal flour conditional 
on a 90 percent attendance rate increased the enrollment 
of girls ages 6–12 years by about 6 percent (Kazianga, de 
Walque, and Alderman 2014). 
Learning and Academic Achievement
A smaller but still substantial body of evidence explores 
the impacts of school feeding on learning and academic 
achievement. Although some indications of a positive 
relationship have been documented, other studies have 
not found statistically significant results. The mixed 
findings may be due to several factors, including differ-
ences in school quality. These differences are consistent 
with other types of schooling interventions, for which 
evidence on what works is inconclusive (Glewwe and 
others 2013). 
In Chile, more frequent consumption of dairy prod-
ucts improved education outcomes for primary and sec-
ondary students (WHO 1998). Preliminary evidence 
from Ghana suggests improved learning outcomes for 
girls in schools where micronutrients were given in the 
meals. The improvements related to literacy (14 percent), 
mathematics (13 percent), and reasoning ability 
(8 percent) (Aurino and others 2016). Other studies, in 
contrast, have found minimal to no impact of school 
feeding on academic achievement. Timing of delivery of 
the feeding and overall learning environments can con-
tribute to explaining the inconsistency of evidence related 
to school feeding and academic achievement (Powell and 
others 1998; Vermeersch and Kremer 2004). For instance, 
Vermeersch and Kremer (2004) attribute their negative 
finding to the disruptive role of school feeding in the 
school day, whereas the positive outcome from Powell 
and others (1998) may be due to the timing of the pro-
gram (just before the school start). In addition, Chang 
and others (1996) found that school feeding was associ-
ated with improved on-task behaviors in well- 
organized 
classrooms but not in disorganized classrooms.

drawing from a systematic review of studies with rigor-
ous design undertaken in LMICs between 1990 and 2015 
(Snilstveit and others 2015). These studies primarily 
included randomized controlled trials, as well as qua-
si-randomized trials, with adjustments for nonrandom 
selection to groups such as propensity score matching or 
regression discontinuity design. Standardized effect sizes 
were estimated for individual studies, and meta-analysis 
was used to obtain overall estimates. 
Nutrition
The World Health Organization recommends that 
school feeding programs contribute 30 percent to 
45 percent of the recommended daily allowance of 
energy and nutrients for half-day schools, and 60 percent 
to 75 percent for full-day schools (WHO 1998). HICs, 
including Chile, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the 
United States, have introduced nutrient-based  
standards 
in school feeding programs to enhance the contribution 
of school meals to recommended dietary intake. 
Nutrient-based standards are less common in LMICs, 
however, with the exception of India (Drake and others 
2016). A review of national school feeding programs in 
12 LMICs  
indicated that many seek to provide more 
diversified food baskets that include fresh produce, 
although this objective is often only aspirational (Aliyar, 
Gelli, and Hamdani 2015). 
School feeding may help children and adoles-
cents receive sufficient nutrients and grow. The inclu-
sion of micronutrient-rich foods or powders may 
address anemia and support improved cognition 
(Abizari and others 2012; Abizari and others 2014; 
Finkelstein and others 2015). School meals may also 
foster understanding of healthy diets and behaviors that 
can extend beyond school and throughout life, particu-
larly if nutrition education is incorporated into the 
program (Kubik and others 2003; Story, Neumark-
Sztainer, and French 2002). 
However, counteracting factors may weaken these 
relationships. For example, households may allocate 
food to siblings not receiving the school meals, possibly 
offsetting the impact of school feeding on the nutritional 
status of the target child. Studies analyzing this issue 
show, nevertheless, that overall energy intake increases 
almost as much as the transfer provided at school—the 
flypaper effect (Afridi 2010; Ahmed 2004; IFPRI 2008; 
Jacoby 2002). In addition, Jacoby (2002) and Ahmed 
(2004) have shown that children who received snacks 
shared them with their younger siblings. Few studies 
have tracked the nutritional status of siblings too young 
to attend school, however, although Adelman, Gilligan, 
and Lehrer (2012) and Kazianga, de Walque, and 
Alderman (2014) have shown that take-home rations 
improved weight-for-age by 0.4 standard deviations for 
the younger siblings of the beneficiaries compared with 
control groups.
Nutrient Adequacy
Evidence suggests that school feeding can be effective 
in promoting macronutrient and micronutrient ade-
quacy in the diet (Jomaa, McDonnell, and Probart 
2011). For food supplementation programs, evidence 
from a randomized controlled trial in Kenya showed 
that the inclusion of meat or milk in the school feeding 
menus improved plasma vitamin B12 concentrations. 
No other measures of micronutrient status were 
affected, however, probably because of concurrent 
incidence of malaria or other infectious diseases 
(Jomaa, McDonnell, and Probart 2011; Siekmann and 
others 2003). In a quasi-randomized study, Afridi 
(2010) found that in the state of Andhra Pradesh in 
India, the Mid-Day Meal Scheme eliminated daily pro-
tein deficiency and decreased calorie deficiency by 
almost 30 percent and daily iron deficiency by nearly 
10 percent (Afridi 2010). Regarding efficacy, Best and 
others (2011) reported in a review that micronutrient 
supplementation increased micronutrients and 
reduced anemia more than supplementation of a single 
micronutrient or no supplementation. 
In 8 out of 10 studies reviewed in Best and others 
(2011), school feeding raised serum concentrations of 
iron, iodine, vitamin A, and vitamin B, while improv-
ing hemoglobin levels. Two studies identified increased 
levels of zinc (Nga and others 2009; Winichagoon and 
others 2006). The impact of school feeding on micro-
nutrient status may depend on the dose, initial micro-
nutrient status, and interactions with other 
micronutrients supplemented. The iron status of 
Kenyan schoolchildren was associated with the dosage 
of iron-fortified flour (Andang’o and others 2007), 
while a randomized controlled trial in Vietnam 
showed that only multifortified biscuits reduced ane-
mia more than iron supplementation, which suggests 
that other micronutrients affect anemia status (Hieu 
and others 2012).
Food-based strategies in school feeding programs 
can effectively address micronutrient deficiencies. 
The introduction of orange-flesh sweet potato in 
meals, for example, improved vitamin A status in 
South Africa (van Jaarsveld and others 2005), while 
consumption of carotene- 
rich yellow and green leafy 
vegetables improved vitamin A and hemoglobin con-
centration and decreased anemia rates in Filipino 
schoolchildren (Maramag and others 2010). The 
incorporation of locally available, micronutrient-rich

foods may also promote local agriculture. Homegrown 
school feeding programs follow this approach 
(box 12.1). A survey of 36 LMICs (mostly Sub-
Saharan African) indicated that national sourcing 
(local purchasing) resulted in the inclusion of more 
diverse and fresh foods (GCNF 2014).
Last, mixed approaches that combine food supple-
mentation and micronutrient supplementation or food 
fortification can also promote nutrient adequacy. In 
Northern Uganda, school meals and take-home rations 
were found to reduce anemia prevalence in girls ages 
10–13 years by 17 to 20 percentage points (Adelman, 
Gilligan, and Lehrer 2012). In contrast, impacts on ane-
mia were not detected in randomized controlled trials 
from Burkina Faso and Lao PDR, where the rations did 
not include multifortified foods (Buttenheim, Alderman, 
and Friedman 2011; Kazianga, de Walque, and Alderman 
2014). The success of these approaches critically depends 
on the regularity of the supplementation throughout the 
school year.
Nutrition and Cognition
A large body of literature shows the links between mal-
nutrition, including micronutrient deficiencies, and 
poor cognition (Glewwe and Miguel 2008; Grantham-
McGregor and Ani 2001). In this area, studies have 
focused on how school feeding can promote cognitive 
skills such as better attention and short-term memory 
by reducing deficiencies in iron and other micronutri-
ents. One randomized controlled study found that regu-
lar provision of fortified biscuits improved the 
micronutrient status and cognitive function of children 
(van Stuijvenberg and others 1999). Two randomized 
controlled studies from Kenya found that the inclusion 
of animal source foods improved cognition and child 
learning, although the magnitude of effects were small 
(Neumann and others 2003; Whaley and others 2003). 
Afridi, Barooah, and Somanathan (2013) found that the 
provision of free meals increased student effort, as mea-
sured by their performance in solving puzzles of increas-
ing difficulty, in India. 
The timing of the meal may be important. Breakfast 
programs may support cognitive function during school 
hours, especially for children who had previously 
skipped breakfast. Findings from two rigorous studies 
suggest that eating breakfast improves on-task time 
(amount of time spent focused on the school activity) 
and attention (Bro and others 1994; Bro and others 
1996). A universal, free breakfast program in Boston 
public schools in the United States improved school 
attendance and math achievement, and decreased days 
tardy for children at nutritional risk as assessed in a pre-
post study during a six-month period (Kleinman and 
others 2002). Nutritional risk in this study was defined 
as less than 50 percent of the recommended daily allow-
ance of total energy intake or of two or more micronu-
trients, or both. A study from Mexico found that 
children in schools participating in a school breakfast 
program had higher response speed and memory com-
pared with children from nearby schools that did not 
participate in the program (Vera Noriega and others 
2000). A review did not find that the timing of meal 
delivery affects cognition, although one study from 
Israel did find that children performed better shortly 
after a meal (Vaisman and others 1996). 
Anthropometry and Nutrition
A Cochrane review on school feeding (Kristjansson 
and others 2009) conducted a meta-analysis of three 
randomized controlled trials in three LMICs: Jamaica 
(Powell and others 1998), Kenya (Grillenberger and 
others 2003), and China (Du and others 2004). The 
meta-analysis found a small yet significant effect on 
weight (0.39 kilogram, 95 percent confidence interval 
0.11, 0.67) and a small nonsignificant effect on height 
gain (0.38 centimeters, 95 percent confidence interval 
–0.32, 1.08). The three school feeding programs dif-
fered greatly in modality of implementation and tar-
get population. In the Jamaica study, 395 children in 
grades 2–5 were given breakfast for a year (Powell and 
others 1998). In Kenya, grade 1 schoolchildren were 
given meat, milk, or an energy supplement for 18 
months (Grillenberger and others 2003). In China, 
the study focused on girls age 10 years who received 
milk supplementation (Du and others 2004). A more 
recent review (Watkins and others 2015), which 
broadened the inclusion criteria by considering stud-
ies such as controlled before-and-after studies, found 
that school feeding had significant effects on weight 
and height gain.
Micronutrient supplementation and fortified foods 
delivered through school feeding programs may also 
affect nutrition outcomes of children. Best and others 
(2011) reported that 10 studies found that school meals 
with micronutrient supplementation had statistically 
significant impacts on micronutrient status even after 
controlling for baseline status. Findings from several 
controlled before-and-after studies suggest that micro-
nutrient supplementation may also have statistically 
significant impacts on height and weight. Table 12.3 
summarizes the evidence.
Dietary Behaviors
Schools and school feeding programs, through nutri-
tion education, can serve as a platform for shaping 
behaviors and food preferences for healthier nutrition 
CAHD_147-164.indd   155

Child and Adolescent Health and Development
(Hawkes and others 2015). The development of 
healthy dietary habits during childhood can also help 
prevent diet- 
related diseases later in life, with the evi-
dence showing that dietary habits tend to be persis-
tent from childhood through adulthood (Dunn and 
others 2000). Dietary diversity may provide an indica-
tor of better diets among children and adolescents. 
The inclusion of animal-source foods in school snacks 
increased dietary diversity in Kenya (Murphy and 
others 2003).
Encouraging lifelong healthy diet choices has so far 
received more attention in HICs; however, it is increas-
ingly relevant in LMICs, where childhood overweight and 
obesity are increasing (Lobstein and others 2015). Some 
studies conducted in HICs found a positive association 
between school meals and overweight and obesity 
(Schanzenbach 2009). Others suggest instead that pro-
grams targeted to primary-school-age children most 
effectively reduced obesity, especially when healthy meals 
were accompanied by communication promoting behav-
ioral change (Corcoran, Elbel, and Schwartz 2014). 
Initiatives at school that combine healthy eating and 
active living have been introduced in HICs to support 
child and adolescent development (De Bourdeaudhuij 
and others 2011; Herforth and Ahmed 2015; Story, 
Nanney, and Schwartz 2009). Similar action in LMICs 
may be needed to respond to the nutrition transition 
(Faber and others 2014). 
Communication materials aimed at changing behav-
ior, alongside school meals, can help inculcate these 
ideas in schoolchildren and influence household diet. 
For example, radio jingles and posters were developed in 
Ghana to complement initiatives undertaken in the 
Ghana School Feeding Programme to improve nutrition 
among children, adolescents, and their communities 
(Gelli and others 2016). Evidence on the impact of nutri-
tion education is scant, particularly in developing coun-
tries, and more research is needed. 
Agriculture
Initial evidence has shown that home-grown school 
feeding can change the eating preferences of households, 
improve community incomes, support smallholder pro-
duction, and facilitate better market access. Thereby, it 
has an impact on rural economies. The impact on rural 
investments and agricultural development has increas-
ingly gained attention through links to the school feed-
ing market. It is also clear that to enable the transition to 
sustainable, scalable government-run programs, the 
inclusion of the agricultural sector is critical (Bundy and 
others 2009; Drake and others 2016).
Initial evidence has shown that homegrown school 
feeding can not only change eating preferences of house-
holds, community incomes, and smalholder production 
and market access, but can also benefit smallholder 
farmers and investments in rural economies. 
Preliminary findings from an impact evaluation in 
Ghana show a 33 percent increase in agricultural sales and 
a strong increase in household income in interventions in 
which homegrown school feeding is implemented 
(Aurino and others 2016). However, it is clear that rigor-
ous evidence regarding the impacts that school feeding 
has on employment and income in the agricultural sector 
needs to be reinforced (Aurino and others 2016; Drake 
and others 2016; GCNF 2014; Masset and others 2012).
The following issues need further exploration:
• Transparency in price and payment is key for small-
holder trust.
• Timely access to price, quality, and quantity informa-
tion enhances operational efficiencies of aggregators 
and market systems.

• Adaptation of quantity and quality requirements and 
effective communication on them can ease the tran-
sition to supplying structured markets.
• The mobile phone platform can allow easier aggre-
gation and management of commodities despite the 
short period of aggregation.
WEIGHING THE COSTS AGAINST BENEFITS: 
AN ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF SCHOOL 
FEEDING
This section reviews the literature on quantifiable 
costs and benefits for an overall assessment of the 
economics of school feeding. Three issues are particu-
larly salient:
• The heterogeneity in the design and implementa-
tion of school feeding interventions across countries 
underscores the need for standardization when pos-
sible. A comparison of costs with benefits is essen-
tial for any economic assessment of school feeding 
or modification to the intervention. For example, 
retargeting school feeding to the most disadvantaged 
areas, or shifting from geographic to individual tar-
geting, may reach disadvantaged populations more 
efficiently.
• Such changes may also entail significant mone-
tary and other costs, including resistance from local 
government officials whose districts will no longer 
receive the intervention, or risk of stigma that chil-
dren and adolescents may experience for receiving 
free or reduced-price meals if the program is not 
designed to mitigate that risk. 
• Some important drivers of costs may be outside the 
scope of the intervention, such as global food prices 
or poor road conditions. 
Costs of School Feeding
Costs of school feeding include costs associated with 
procuring food, transportation and storage, and staff 
time to monitor program implementation. Some pro-
grams hire cooks or caterers to prepare meals; others 
rely on community volunteers. Communities may pro-
vide other, in-kind contributions, such as fresh fruit or 
vegetables, fuel, condiments, and utensils. The provi-
sion of multifortified biscuits and take-home rations 
entails costs in staffing and delivery. Efficiencies may be 
gained through integrating school feeding with other 
school health interventions, such as water, hygiene and 
sanitation, or deworming (Azomahou, Diallo, and 
Raymond 2014). 
Modality is a key determinant of school feeding costs. 
On average, school meals, biscuits, and take-home 
rations cost US$27, US$11, and US$43, respectively, per 
child per year (Gelli and others 2011). The differences 
are driven largely by differences in meal size or modality 
of the transfer; take-home rations cost more because 
they provide an additional transfer to the household 
beyond the food delivered in school. 
Significant variation in cost is also evident across 
countries. Drawing from a sample of 74 low-, middle-, 
and high-income countries, school feeding costs an 
average of US$173 per child per year, ranging from 
US$54 in LICs to US$82 in middle-income countries 
and US$693 in HICs (Gelli and Daryanani 2013). These 
estimates are standardized for several parameters to 
support cross-country comparability, including the 
number of kilocalories in the ration and the number of 
days school feeding was provided. Food costs were typ-
ically the largest component, accounting for more than 
half of total program costs (Galloway and others 2009; 
Gelli and others 2011).3 Although the contributions of 
communities are not usually reflected in these esti-
mates,4 they are estimated to be about 5 percent of total 
cost in LICs, or about US$2 per year (Galloway and 
others 2009). 
The benchmarking of school feeding costs as a per-
centage of primary school education costs can also 
support comparability across countries. As table 12.4 
shows, school feeding costs become a smaller propor-
tion of primary education costs as the income level of 
the country increases. For LICs, the share is 68 percent, 
compared with 19 percent for MICs and 11 percent 
for HICs. 
As gross domestic product increases, the per capita 
cost of primary school education increases more rap-
idly than the per capita cost of school feeding, which 
drives this finding (figure 12.4) (Bundy and others

Child and Adolescent Health and Development
2009; Gelli and Daryanani 2013). The high cost of 
school feeding relative to education is notable, partic-
ularly in LICs. 
Assessing Costs against Benefits
This section reviews the cost of school feeding by output 
and outcome. For output, figure B12.2.1 presents the 
cost of delivering 30 percent of the recommended daily 
allowances of key micronutrients in 12 countries based 
on school feeding menus (Drake and others 2016). The 
composition of school meals varies widely, and diversifi-
cation may lead to higher costs. Some studies have found 
positive effects on anthropometric indicators from meat 
or milk in the meals (Du and others 2004; Grillenberger 
and others 2003). However, LICs are unlikely to be able 
to sustain the higher costs of meat, and possibly milk, in 
meal programs. As economies develop, these food items 
can be gradually introduced and governments might be 
able to use schools to encourage the development of 
dairy sectors. Bangladesh, Rwanda, and Vietnam are 
encouraging these links through their school feeding 
programs. 
For decentralized programs, setting the appropriate 
reimbursement rate to meet recommended nutrient 
levels is critical (Parish and Gelli 2015). Tools such as 
the School Meals Planner can support the design of 
costed menus that incorporate nutrient-rich foods 
(box 12.2). The addition of supplements such as 
micronutrient powders to school meals may also 
increase cost efficiency relative to nutrient content. In 
Ghana, the provision of micronutrient powders in 
school meals costs only an estimated additional 
US$2.92 per child for the entire school year (Stopford 
and others, forthcoming). 
Estimation of the overall cost-effectiveness of school 
feeding is complicated by the multiple benefits of the 
intervention and the need to transform the units of 
different outcomes into the same unit. To simplify the 
problem, school feeding can be viewed as increasing 
the quantity and quality of education obtained, with 
improved nutrition outcomes contributing to quality 
(Gelli and others 2014). Capturing both education and 
nutrition outcomes in such calculations is critical for 
comparisons with other interventions, such as condi-
tional cash transfers,5 as well as direct schooling invest-
ment. Compared with conditional cash transfers, school 
feeding has high nontransfer costs of approximately 
20 percent to 40 percent (Bundy and others 2009).
Previous studies (Jamison and Leslie 1990; Schuh 
1981) have hypothesized that the benefit-cost of school 
feeding programs are attractive. A recent systematic 
review and meta-analysis (Snilstveit and others 2015) 
found that school feeding had significant effects on 
school attendance equivalent to an additional 8 days 
attended. There were also effects in the expected 
direction on improving enrollment, decreasing drop-
out, and improving various measures of attainment

School Meals Planner
The School Meals Planner software and accompany-
ing materials were developed in response to demand 
from governments to support the design of nutri-
tious, well-balanced meals for homegrown school 
feeding programs. 
The tool is a user-friendly dashboard that helps 
planning officials who may not be nutritionists 
(figure B12.2.1). It was adapted to Ghana and 
tested during the 2014/15 school year. Food com-
position tables and nutrition recommendations 
specific to Ghana were developed through 
high-level political engagement. Officials from 42 
districts located across the 10 regions of Ghana 
designed menus using the School Meals Planner. 
These menus reached more than 320,000 
children. 
A set of handy calibrated measures was provided to 
each school caterer to ensure provision of food 
quantities listed on the menus. A communication 
campaign sensitized schools and communities to the 
health and broader developmental benefits of locally 
grown, healthy diets. 
(cognitive scores, maths scores, and language arts scores), 
although none of these was significant. Higher school 
attendance, in turn, has returns in higher wages upon 
graduation, and the returns to education in Sub-Saharan 
Africa are high. Fernandes and Aurino (2017, chapter 25 
in this volume) estimate the benefit-cost of the effect of 
attendance as around 3 for low-income countries, and 
around 7 for lower-middle-income countries. If there 
are additional effects of improved cognition, the returns 
could be even higher.

Child and Adolescent Health and Development
CONCLUSIONS
School feeding is commonly implemented across low-, 
middle-, and high-income countries; however, there is 
significant variation driven by context to a large degree. 
The research most strongly indicates that school 
feeding has social protection and educational benefits; 
more recent studies have explored its nutritional 
benefits.
School feeding can serve to protect earlier invest-
ments in child welfare, buffering the effects of early 
shocks and contributing to the continuum of interven-
tions from childhood through adolescence and into 
adulthood. Furthermore, school feeding also has the 
potential to address emerging issues such as the nutri-
tion transition and could be integrated with other 
school health interventions, such as deworming, for 
greater impact. 
Homegrown school feeding can not only change eat-
ing preferences of households, improve community 
incomes, and smalholder production and market access, 
but can also benefit investments in rural economies and 
contribute to national food security.
Much still needs to be learned about the barriers to 
these potential benefits. The costs of school feeding vary 
significantly across countries. An economic modeling 
exercise indicates that the returns to greater quantity 
and quality of education are a primary contributor to 
benefits. Future research is needed on the quantification 
of benefits to ensure more valid comparisons with other 
interventions. 
NOTES
World Bank Income Classifications as of July 2014 are as 
 
follows, based on estimates of gross national income (GNI) per 
capita for 2013:
• 
Low-income countries (LICs) = US$1,045 or less 
• 
Middle-income countries (MICs) are subdivided: 
 a) lower-middle-income = US$1,046 to US$4,125 
 
b) upper-middle-income (UMICs) = US$4,126 to US$12,745
• 
High-income countries (HICs) = US$12,746 or more.
 1. The nutrition transition is the rapid transition in LMICs 
from traditional diets rich in cereals and fiber to western-
ized diets high in fat, sugars, and animal-source food. 
 2. Calculation by authors using data from WFP (2013).
 3. One study estimated that commodities contributed 
57 percent to overall costs (Galloway and others 2009). 
Gelli and others (2011) found that commodity costs were, 
on average, 58 percent of total costs, and were highest for 
take-home rations and biscuit programs (68 percent and 
71 percent, respectively).
 4. Gelli and Daryanani’s (2013) study is an exception because 
the authors were able to calculate projections for commu-
nity contributions, where relevant.
 5. The value of increased equity in both school feeding and 
conditional cash transfers is a benefit that is often part of 
the design but not one that is easily quantified (Alderman, 
Behrman, and Tasneem 2015).
