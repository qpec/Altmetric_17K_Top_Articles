Purpose: To investigate the effect of a complex, short-term strength/power training protocol on performance and body
composition of elite early adolescent soccer players. Methods: Twenty-two players (14–15 y) were randomly assigned to (1) an
experimental group (N = 12; participated in a 5-wk training protocol with traditional multijoint power resistance exercises,
Olympic-style lifts, plyometric drills, and speed work; 4 times per week) or (2) a control group (N = 10). Strength and power
performance (jumping, speed, change of direction, repeated sprint ability, endurance, isokinetic strength of knee flexors and
extensors, maximal strength in various lifts, and speed-endurance) were evaluated pretraining and posttraining. Results:
Cessation of training for 5 weeks in the control group induced a marked performance deterioration (∼5%–20%). Training not only
prevented strength performance deterioration but also increased it (∼2%–30%). Endurance and repeated sprint ability declined to
a smaller extent in experimental group compared with control group (15% vs 7.5%). Isometric strength and body composition
remained unaltered in both groups. Conclusions: Results demonstrate that (1) young players exhibit a high level of trainability of
their strength/power performance (but not endurance) in response to a short-term complex training protocol during early
adolescence, (2) Olympic-style lifts are characterized by increased safety in this age group and appear to be highly effective,
(3) lifts incorporating a hip thrust result in increased strength of both knee extensors and flexors, (4) cessation of training for only
5 weeks results in marked deterioration of strength/power and endurance performance, and (5) improvement of strength/power
performance may be related to neural-based adaptation as body composition remained unaffected.

Soccer, an intermittent-type sport, incorporates explosive ac-
tions (eg, sprinting, jumping, tackling, impacts, shooting, changes
of direction, etc) that require high power output by lower-limb
muscles.1 These powerful muscle actions are pivotal for match
performance of adolescent soccer players.2 Although sprinting
represents only a ∼3% of the total distance covered in youth
matches, it is crucial for ball possession, scoring, or allowing
opponents to score.2 Match analysis has shown that the ability
to change direction (COD), that is, the ability to COD using quick
accelerations and decelerations (>2 m/s2), is an important element
for soccer performance with >50 turns recorded per match.3 Initial
acceleration (ie, a 0- to 10-m sprint) is also a pivotal physical
attribute for young players as the average sprint time/match is
2.3 seconds suggesting that most sprints are 10 to 12 m long
rendering power development of the lower-limb muscle groups, an
essential component of athletes’ conditioning plan.4 Improvement
of muscle power of lower-limb musculature depends on the
development of force, velocity, or both through independent
training.5
Implementation of neuromuscular training (ie, strength, plyo-
metric, and sprint training) in peripubertal years is quite effective in
promoting the athletic development of youth due to the increased
plasticity of the neuromuscular system before, during, and after
the period of peak height velocity.6 Strength training (ST) using
more traditional power exercises such as the back squat improves
kicking force, speed, and acceleration in adolescent players even
in response to short-term training.7 These adaptations to ST are
related to an increase of peak ground reaction forces, velocity of
movement, muscle mass, and bone development.8
Although ST with traditional resistance training exercises (eg,
squat) utilizing higher loads at lower movement velocities is effec-
tive in enhancing lower-body strength, it may not develop strength
optimally in athletic movements requiring higher movement veloci-
ties and a greater power output.9 The later requires an increase in
the rate of force development at the ankle, hips, and knees, which
is better developed by exercises using lower resistance and higher
velocities.10 Ballistic, Olympic-style lifts are performed at higher
velocities introducing an acceleration of a lighter weight throughout
the lift.11 Although these lifts may result in lower strength develop-
ment when compared with traditional weight training,12 they induce
a higher output in speed–power performance in adolescent athletes12
with rate of force development being 4- to 5-fold greater during these
lifts than that measured during a squat.13 Utilization of both types of
exercise may produce the best improvement of power performance
due to an increase in both maximal strength and rate of force
development, and it represents the most popular practice among
high school, college, and professional conditioning specialists par-
ticularly during off-season training.14 On the other hand, soccer skills
such as ball kicking and sprinting also rely on the utilization of the

ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION
 stretch-shortening cycle to produce rapid force.9 Plyometric training
(PT) is highly effective in promoting strength, speed, and power
performance in youth soccer players,15 whereas its combination with
resistance or sprint training may be even more effective.16 Complex
training (CT) is a method used to improve both strength and power
combining a resistant exercise of slow velocity and heavy load
(eg, squat) with an exercise of higher velocity, lighter load, and a
similar biomechanical movement pattern (eg, plyometric jumps).17
The available information regarding the responses of soccer players
to periodized complex strength/power training during early adoles-
cence is limited. Therefore, this study used a comprehensive set of
measurements to evaluate the effects of a 5-week periodized strength/
power training program consisting of multijoint, high-intensity
resistance exercises, plyometrics, and speed-endurance drills during
off-season on (1) soccer-specific performance and (2) isometric,
eccentric, and concentric strength of knee extensors (KE) and knee
flexors (KF). It was hypothesized that a 5-week CT program will not
change the performance of early adolescent soccer players.
Methods
Participants
A power analysis, based on previous studies in youth populations of
similar research designs,15 performed before the study using an
effect size of >0.55, a probability error of 0.05, and a power of 0.9 for
2 groups and time points (pre and post) indicated that 16 subjects
were the smallest acceptable number of participants to analyze the
interaction between group and time points of measurements. Ini-
tially, 48 males (13–15 y) were approached, but 34 volunteered to
participate in this investigation. Participants were included in the
study if (1) they had no musculoskeletal injuries for ≥12 months
prior to the study, (2) they were early pubertals (Tanner stage 3),
(3) they participated in ≥95% of training sessions, (4) they partici-
pated in organized youth soccer training for ≥6 years, (5) they
participated in ≥5 practices per week during in-season, (6) they had
no previous experience of ST with multijoint exercises, (7) they did
not consume any medications, and (8) their medical history (re-
ported by parents/guardians) included no previous growth irregu-
larities. Twenty-two boys met the inclusion criteria and completed
the study. Experimental procedures and potential risks, discomforts,
and benefits were fully explained to all boys, parents/guardians, and
coaches prior to participation. Signed informed consents were
provided by participants’ parents and/or legal guardians, the insti-
tutional ethics committee of the Department of Physical Education
and Sports Science of the University of Thessaly approved the study,
and procedures were in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Participants’ characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Study Overview
A randomized, 2-group, repeated measures experimental design
was employed. Participants were assigned to either a control group
(CG, N = 10, did not train; age 14.1 [0.6] y) or an experimental
group (EG, N = 12 completed training; age 14.3 [0.7] y). The study
was conducted 1 week within the off-season period. A familiari-
zation period with experimental/training procedures was utilized to
minimize the learning effect error. Four days following familiari-
zation, participants underwent a 2-day baseline testing (day 1:
anthropometric and strength assessment; day 2: measurement of
speed, repeated sprint ability [RSA], COD, and soccer-specific
endurance). Posttraining measurements were repeated at the same
time and under the same conditions 4 to 5 days after the last
practice. Participants were instructed to follow their usual daily diet
pattern throughout the study.
Training Program
Table 2 highlights study’s training protocol. Training consisted of 4
training sessions per week for 5 weeks. ST, performed on Mondays
and Thursdays, included 13 resistance exercises (squat, Romanian
dead lifts [RDL], lounges or step ups, 1 leg RDL, bench press,
rowing or inverse rowing, shoulder press or shoulders extensions,
arm curls and dips, or push downs). On Tuesdays and Fridays,
participants performed CT (combination of multijoint Olympic-
style lifts, PT, and speed work; eg, barbell cleans, kettlebell
snatches, box jumps, speed/power drills) on a soccer pitch. Train-
ing followed the model of linear periodization for core ST and
PT exercises (intensity increased progressively from 60% to 70%
1-repetition maximum [1RM] in the first week to 80% to 90%
1RM during in the fifth week for core resistance exercises, from
20 to 40 kg for multijoint exercises and from 20 to 50 cm for
plyometric exercises). Sprints were performed at full speed. The
intensity for supplementary resistance exercises was set at 60% to
70% 1RM. 1RM was evaluated every 2 weeks. Athletes of both
groups participated in very light soccer training twice a week. This
training consisted of dynamic warm-up, technical skill training
(10 min), small-sided games (5 min), and light scrimmage
(15 min). Participants were instructed to fully abstain from any
other training and/or strenuous physical activity.
Measurements
Anthropometrics.
Body mass was measured to the nearest 0.5 kg
(Seca 710; Seca, Birmingham, United Kingdom) with subjects
wearing the underclothes and barefooted. Standing height was
evaluated to the nearest 0.5 cm (Seca stadiometer 208; Seca). Body
composition (%fat) was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorp-
tiometry scan (Lunar DPX; GE Healthcare, Madison, WI) as
described.18 Pubertal development was determined using the
Tanner criteria.19
Strength.
Isometric strength, concentric peak torque of KF and
KE, and eccentric peak torque of KF in both dominant and
nondominant leg (dominance was decided based on participants’

180°/s on an isokinetic dynamometer (Isoforce; TUR GmbH,
Berlin, Germany) as described.20 The conventional (KF concentric
peak torque to KE concentric peak torque) and functional (KF
eccentric peak torque to concentric KE peak torque) ratios were
then estimated. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for
repeated measurements were .92 to .94. Maximal leg strength was
also measured using the 1RM test for barbell back squat and RDL
exercises as described.21 The ICC for test–retest trials was .93.
Performance Measurements.
Squat, countermovement, and
depth jumps (ICCs: .92–.95) were utilized to measure jumping
performance using an electronic mat to determine vertical
displacement (NewTest Ltd, Kiviharjuntie, Finland).15 Time to
complete a 30-m sprint with split time at 10 m was measured using
infrared light sensors (NewTest Ltd) in 2 attempts (using a 10-min
rest between attempts) with participants wearing soccer shoes on a
soccer pitch outdoors (ICC: .96).15 The arrowhead test (ICC: .96)
was used to measure COD on a 37.1-m course (2 attempts were
allowed with a 15-min rest in between and the best time was
recorded) using infrared light sensors (NewTest Ltd) at the starting
and finishing point to measure time.22 RSA was evaluated using
infrared light sensors to measure time as previously described.1 The
Yo–Yo intermittent recovery test level 2 (Yo–Yo IR2) was used to
measure speed-endurance.1

statistically meaningful changes were detected.
No changes were noted in isometric peak torque of KF and KE
of both limbs in the 2 groups (Figure 3). Changes in isokinetic
strength measures at 60°/s are shown in Figure 4. In the dominant
limb, concentric peak torque of KF remained unaltered by training
in both groups, eccentric peak torque of KF decreased in CG

and increased in EG (2.1%, F1,20 = 9.92, P < .05, η2 = .33), whereas
both the conventional and functional ratios (Figure 5) remained
unaltered in both groups. In the nondominant limb, concentric
peak torque of KF decreased in CG (−7.5%, F1,20 = 23.94, P < .05,

ratio remained unchanged in both groups.
Changes in isokinetic strength measures at 180°/s are shown in

CG (−6.9%, F1,20 = 4.89, P = .04, η2 = .2) and remained unaltered
in EG, and concentric peak torque of KE decreased in CG (−7.1%,
F1,20 = 7.18, P = .014, η2 = .26) and remained unaffected in EG,
whereas both the conventional and functional ratios (Figure 5)
remained unaltered in both groups at the end of the experimental
period. In the nondominant limb, concentric peak torque of KF
remained unaltered in CG and increased in EG (17.8%, F1,20 =
11.72, P < .05, η2 = .37), eccentric peak torque of KF declined in
CG (−7.6%, F1,20 = 7.12, P < .05, η2 = .26) and remained unaltered
in EG, and concentric peak torque of KE remained unaltered in
both groups, the conventional ratio of KF/KE (Figure 5) increased
only in CG (15.3%, F1,20 = 11.15, P < .05, η2 = .35), whereas the
functional ratio (Figure 5) remained unaltered in both groups.
Discussion
This is the first investigation to study the effects of complex-type
exercise training on performance of elite early adolescent soccer
players. Results indicate that (1) only 5 weeks of off-season
detraining in the CG induced a deterioration of speed–power
and endurance performance, which was more pronounced in
eccentric strength of KF and concentric strength of KE; (2) a
5-week periodized CT program not only attenuated the decline of
strength/power performance observed during off-season detraining
but also enhanced it; and (3) deterioration of endurance perfor-
mance due to off-season detraining cannot be affected by a
strength/power training program.

 Cessation of training in the CG during off-season resulted in
considerable strength detraining of KE and KF strength at low-
speed movements. This reduction of KE strength in CG during off-
season was greater than that observed to that of KF in both limbs
thereby resulting in greater values of conventional and functional
ratios in CG. On the other hand, at high-speed movements,
eccentric strength of KF and concentric strength of KE demon-
strated a greater reduction rate during the same time frame. These
findings suggest that strength deterioration during high-velocity
motions is mainly seen at knee extensions during which KE
contract concentrically and KF act eccentrically. This phenomenon
is also supported by the fact that maximal strength in 2 multijoint
exercises that heavily rely on eccentric strength of KF and con-
centric strength of KE (ie, squat and RDL) was reduced by 8% to
14% in CG. These findings coincide with previous reports suggest-
ing that young athletes may experience a rapid loss of central
adaptations initially and of muscle mass later.23 As no changes
were observed in body composition, a plausible explanation for
these reductions of muscle strength is probably a compromised
neural input. Detraining effects on performance are related to
factors, such as maturation, training level, and total training
load, before training cessation.24 Short-term detraining in this

 study induced a decay of maximal force (eg, 1RM) at a greater
extent (8%–14% vs 2%–9%) than force during higher velocity
movements (eg, peak torque at 180°/s, jumping, speed, COD). The
smaller decline of power performance may be associated with the
smaller decay of torque at higher velocities compared with maxi-
mal strength and/or with an upregulation of the expression of fast
myosin heavy-chain isoforms in muscle following detraining,
which may enhance velocity potential to compensate for the
reduction in maximal force.25
CT implemented through a periodized protocol integrating
traditional multijoint strength exercises, Olympic-style lifts, PT,
and speed drills improved lower-limb strength and power of
early-adolescent soccer players within only 5 weeks. Strength
increase was more evident at high- versus low-velocity testing
in KF versus KE probably due to the utilization of lifts and drills
requiring a substantial recruitment of KF. 1RM increased by 21%
to 30%, a magnitude of improvement that has been previously
reported for youth26 and may be related to participants’ minimal
previous involvement with ST.26 These gains cannot be attributed
to an upregulation of fat-free mass as body composition remained
unchanged suggesting that neural factors have probably contrib-
uted to these adaptations within such a short time frame.23 Further-

 within their physiological range indicating a reduced risk for
hamstrings’ injury.20
Speed improvement (∼4%) was of similar magnitude with that
usually reported for youth exposed to ST.27 However, others failed
to observe changes in speed despite a rise in muscle power in
response to ST.26 This discrepancy among studies is probably
related to differences in the type of exercises used, planes of
movements, and muscles recruited. We emphasized movement
in various planes, recruitment not only of thigh and tibia muscles
but also of hip at the horizontal vector, which seem to be pre-
requisites for development of speed and acceleration.28 It appears
that exercises emphasizing the recruitment of hip musculature,
such as dead lifts, lounges, and Olympic-style, lifts may be well-
tolerated and effective for adolescent athletes when used in the
context of CT. However, this type of training failed to improve
high-velocity movements (ie, the sprint time at 30 m). It appears
that incorporation of lifts characterized by high-velocity and lighter
loads such as the Olympic lifts may be effective for strength/power
development of adolescent soccer players during off-season. This
type of lifts was found to be more effective than traditional strength
exercises for young soccer players.12
The CT protocol used also resulted in improvement of vertical
jumping corroborating previous findings in youth.27 It appears that
even a moderate rise in maximal strength is associated with a
substantial increase in lower-limb muscle power29 and participants
in this study improved both. Maturation could not have affected
these results as the controls demonstrated a different response, the
training protocol was of a very short duration, and participants were
far from their peak growth period.30
Training cessation during off-season reduced speed-endurance
(15% in Yo–Yo IR2 and 40% in RSA). Training in EG attenuated
the deterioration in Yo–Yo IR2 performance but not that of RSA. In
young men, detraining results in reduced endurance performance
mainly due to peripheral adaptations (eg, reduced capillarization of
muscle fibers, substrate utilization, mitochondrial energy capacity,
electrolyte regulation) even after 3 to 4 weeks of detraining.31 The
CT model adapted by this study did not affect endurance as it did
for strength/power measures indicating a specificity effect.
A number of limitations are associated with this investigation.
One limitation is lack of measurement of hormonal levels which
change abruptly during early adolescence in boys.32 As such, our
results can be extrapolated to other groups such as age-matched
female athletes or adults. The training intervention was short-lived
(5 wk/20 training sessions), which might have not allowed parti-
cipants to fully grasp the squat and/or the hip thrust movements of
exercises incorporated in the training program. Changes in accel-
eration were only assessed and not in maximal speed using only
short-distance sprint testing. Although participants were instructed
to abstain from strenuous activities, their daily physical activity
was not assessed (eg, with accelerometry).
Practical Applications
Early adolescent soccer players demonstrate an exceptional level
of trainability to complex strength/power training during the off-
season. Specifically, only 5 weeks of this type of training was able
to induce considerable gains in measures of strength, power (∼2%–
30%), and soccer-specific performance but not endurance. Olym-
pic-type lifts were well tolerated by young players and may
contribute to considerable strength and power gains. This type
of training protocol appears to work efficiently when applied
according to the linear periodization model that uses a progressive
increase of workload. Another major finding of this study is that
cessation of training even for 5 to 6 weeks may induce marked
detraining in strength/power (∼−5% to −20%) and endurance
(∼−8% to −15%) performance.
Conclusions
Implementation of a periodized CT protocol consisting of multi-
joint lifts, Olympic-style lifts, plyometrics, and speed drills in early-
adolescent soccer players not only offsets the deleterious effect of
cessation of training during off-season on strength/power perfor-
mance but it may also improve it. These results seem to be related
mainly to neural adaptations rather than to an increase in muscle mass.
