BACKGROUND: Interventions to address vaccine hesitancy and increase vaccine acceptance are 
needed. This study sought to determine if a Web-based, social media intervention increases 
early childhood immunization.
METHODS: A 3-arm, randomized controlled trial was conducted in Colorado from September 
2013 to July 2016. Participants were pregnant women, randomly assigned (3:2:1) to a Web 
site with vaccine information and interactive social media components (VSM), a Web site 
with vaccine information (VI), or usual care (UC). Vaccination was assessed in infants of 
participants from birth to age 200 days. The primary outcome was days undervaccinated, 
measured as a continuous and dichotomous variable.
RESULTS: Infants of 888 participants were managed for 200 days. By using a nonparametric 
rank-based analysis, mean ranks for days undervaccinated were significantly lower in the 
VSM arm versus UC (P = .02) but not statistically different between the VI and UC (P = .08) 
or between VSM and VI arms (P = .63). The proportions of infants up-to-date at age 200 
days were 92.5, 91.3, and 86.6 in the VSM, VI, and UC arms, respectively. Infants in the VSM 
arm were more likely to be up-to-date than infants in the UC arm (odds ratio [OR] = 1.92; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07–3.47). Up-to-date status was not statistically different 
between VI and UC arms (OR = 1.62; 95% CI, 0.87–3.00) or between the VSM and VI arms 
(OR = 1.19, 95% CI, 0.70–2.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Providing Web-based vaccine information with social media applications during 
pregnancy can positively influence parental vaccine behaviors.

What’s KnoWn on this subject: Many parents 
with concerns about childhood vaccines use the 
Internet and social media for vaccine information. 
The effectiveness of using Web-based vaccine 
information and social media to increase parental 
vaccine acceptance has not been evaluated.
What this study adds: By using a randomized 
control trial design, we found that a Web-based, 
social media intervention administered outside 
of the physician’s office can effectively improve 
childhood vaccine acceptance among pregnant 
women.

 Between 10% to 15% of parents 
choose to delay or refuse 1 or more 
recommended vaccines for their 
children.1 This decision leaves 
children and their communities 
vulnerable to vaccine-preventable 
diseases.2 Parents who are hesitant 
to vaccinate their children also 
have complex information-seeking 
behaviors. They often start to 
weigh the risks and benefits of 
vaccination during pregnancy, seek 
information from many sources, and 
express interest in receiving vaccine 
information before routine well-child 
visits.3 
–5 Although physicians are 
trusted sources of health information 
for parents, vaccine-hesitant parents 
are inclined to distrust traditional 
sources of scientific authority and 
report using the Internet to gather 
information on vaccines.6 
– 
8
Regardless of whether they are 
hesitant about childhood vaccination, 
parents who use the Internet 
to educate themselves must sift 
through vast amounts of vaccine 
information. Web sites range from 
government-sponsored, pro-vaccine 
resources that carefully present 
factual information to staunchly 
antivaccination Web sites that 
use anecdotes and social media to 
disseminate misinformation.9 Along 
this spectrum, numerous parenting 
message boards and blogs vigorously 
discuss vaccine-related topics. 
Exposure to antivaccine messages 
through social media appears to 
intensify parents’ worries and lower 
their intentions to vaccinate.10
At the same time, social media may 
have the potential to allay parental 
vaccine concerns and improve 
immunization rates. An expert-
moderated, interactive vaccine Web 
site could provide parents with a 
forum to voice their opinions, ask 
questions, and interact with other 
concerned parents and vaccine 
experts.11 This type of dynamic 
online environment could help build 
trust and combat misinformation. At 
present, the impact of using social 
media to improve vaccine acceptance 
is not known.12 In addition, we are 
not aware of any interventions 
targeting vaccine hesitancy that 
have effectively changed parental 
vaccination behavior in the 
United States.12 
–14 As part of the 
Colorado Vaccine Social Media 
study, we conducted a randomized 
controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate 
the effectiveness of Web-based 
vaccine information and social media 
interventions to increase vaccine 
acceptance.
Methods
study overview
Between September 2013 and July 
2016, we conducted a single-center 
RCT of vaccine information and 
social media interventions designed 
to reduce undervaccination among 
infants of women recruited during 
pregnancy. Our primary outcome 
was days undervaccinated from birth 
to age 200 days. We hypothesized 
that infants of women exposed to 
interventions during pregnancy will 
have less vaccine delay than infants 
receiving usual pediatric care.
Participants were randomly assigned 
to 1 of 3 groups: a Web site with 
vaccine information and interactive 
social media components (VSM); 
Web site with vaccine information 
(VI); or usual care only (UC). The 
Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) 
institutional review board approved 
this study.
study setting, Participants, and 
Randomization
All participants were members of 
the KPCO health plan, a nonprofit 
managed care organization serving 
∼628 000 individuals. Each year, 
∼5000 pregnant women and 
∼130 000 children receive health 
care at KPCO clinics.
Recruitment was conducted in 
6-week waves between September 
2013 and October 2015. At the 
beginning of each wave, we used 
electronic health records to identify 
pregnant women in the third 
trimester of pregnancy (13–6 weeks 
from delivery). Women had to be age 
18 years or older, English speaking, 
have Internet access, and be enrolled 
in the KPCO health plan. Pregnant 
women were ineligible if they had a 
diagnosis for fetal death, miscarriage, 
or congenital anomaly. Eligible 
women received a combination of 
postcards, e-mails, and phone calls to 
elicit participation. Informed consent 
was obtained online by using a 
secure encryption program.
After consent, participants were 
administered a baseline survey 
to assess demographics and 
Internet use. Participants were 
also administered the Parent 
Attitudes and Childhood Vaccines 
(PACV) screening survey, which 
is a validated, 15-item instrument 
that assesses vaccine hesitancy on a 
scale of 0 to 100.15 Consistent with 
previous studies, participants scoring 
≥50 were classified as “vaccine 
hesitant, 
” whereas participants with 
scores <50 were “nonhesitant.” To 
ensure balance across study arms, 
randomization was conducted 
independently within the 2 strata 
of hesitancy. Because only a small 
fraction of Web site visitors actively 
engage in social media activities, 
16 
we used a randomization allocation 
ratio of 3:2:1 across the VSM/VI/
UC arms to facilitate interaction. 
Randomization was done by an 
unblinded statistician using the SAS/
STAT (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) 
procedure Proc Plan. Although the 
participants and study team were 
not blinded to study arm assignment, 
the study team was blinded to 
participants’ hesitancy status.
To enhance security and prevent 
contamination, participants randomly 
assigned to the VSM and VI arms 
were required to create a login and 
password for the Web site. Infants of 
participants were managed for 200 
days after birth to assess vaccination

resource would be used in practice, 
individuals in the VSM and VI arms 
were given access to the Web site but 
were not required to visit it.
interventions
Separate interventions were 
developed for the VSM and VI 
arms. The theoretical basis for 
the VSM intervention was the 
multidirectional communication 
model, 
17 a social marketing strategy 
with 3 components. Component 1 is a 
standard, top-down process in which 
Web site developers create and 
present content to users. Component 
2 is a bottom-up process that 
allows users to create content and 
interact with Web site developers. 
Component 3 is a side-to-side process 
in which users can interact with each 
other and share information. This 
model is intended to empower users 
by allowing them to become active 
participants in the communication 
process, thereby eliciting positive 
health behavior changes.18 In 
contrast to the VSM intervention, the 
VI intervention only included the top-
down component of the model.
The interventions were designed 
and pilot tested by using an adapted 
mental-models approach that  
included focus groups, individual  
interviews, surveys, and usability  
testing with parents and pregnant  
women.19 Details of this process  
have been described previously.20 In 
brief, our study team first developed 
the factual vaccine content, guided  
by the Health Belief Model and Theory 
of Planned Behavior.21, 
 
22  
We sought to present content that 
accurately represented the risks and 
benefits of vaccination, including 
information on vaccine-preventable 
diseases, vaccine safety, vaccine laws, 
the recommended immunization 
schedule, vaccine ingredients, vaccine 
development, and basic immunology. 
Information was labeled and arranged 
into short, easy-to-read sections, 
guided by best practices in risk 
communication and Web site design.23, 
 
24  
Sources of information were carefully 
referenced and hyperlinked to help 
convey transparency and credibility.25 
The information was focused on 
encouraging parents to receive 
recommended vaccines on time. 
Participants in the VSM and VI arms 
had access to the same base vaccine 
content.
In addition to vaccine content, 
participants in the VSM arm had 
access to social media technologies 
that included a blog, discussion forum, 
chat room, and “Ask a Question” portal 
through which participants could 
directly ask our experts questions 
about vaccination. These technologies 
were designed to facilitate engagement 
and reinforce the factual content. 
Experts included a pediatrician, a 
vaccine safety researcher, and a 
risk communication specialist. Each 
month, the research team created 
1 to 2 blog posts covering topics 
such as new vaccine safety research, 
vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks, 
changes in immunization policy, 
and the importance of adhering to 
the recommended immunization 
schedule. Posts were either text or 
audio (podcasts), and participants 
could contribute comments and 
ask questions. Each month, we 
hosted online chat sessions in which 
participants could engage in real-
time conversations with experts. 
Participants were also encouraged to 
submit questions privately through 
e-mail; the team provided personalized 
responses within 2 business days. All 
participants in the VSM arm received 
monthly newsletters to encourage Web 
site participation and highlight new 
Web site content.
All interactive components were 
moderated to prevent bullying, 
disclosure of personal identifying 
health information, and abusive 
language. Responses to comments 
and questions adhered to a consistent 
communication framework designed 
to convey dedication, expertise, and 
honesty.23, 
 
24 Intervention details 
(including the Hoffman’s template 
for intervention description and 
replication checklist and guide and 
screenshots of the intervention 
Web sites) are included in the 
Supplemental Information.26
Routine pediatric preventive care was 
available to participants in all study 
arms. At KPCO, structured well-child 
visits are scheduled at 2 weeks and 
2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age.27 Most 
immunizations are administered at 
these routinely scheduled, 20-minute 
health supervision visits. It is standard 
practice at KPCO to provide a previsit 
informational sheet listing the vaccines 
recommended at that visit as well as 
Vaccine Information Statements.28
outcome
Vaccination Status: Days 
Undervaccinated and Up-to-Date Status
Immunization data for infants were 
extracted from the electronic health 
record. We assessed vaccination status 
over the first 200 days of age to cover 
a a majority of the recommended 
infant vaccines and minimize loss to 
follow-up. We assessed the following 
6 vaccines recommended by the 
Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices: hepatitis B; rotavirus; 
diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis; 
Haemophilus influenzae type b; 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; and 
polio. Our primary outcome was days 
undervaccinated, a continuous metric 
that measures differences between 
the time when vaccine doses were 
actually administered and when the 
doses should have been administered 
according to the Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices schedule.29, 
 
30  
For example, the first dose of 
diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis 
is due at age 2 months but is not 
considered late until age 92 days. 
Days undervaccinated for this dose 
would begin accruing on day 93. Of 
note, infants who did not receive 
the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine 
were not considered delayed; days 
undervaccinated for the first dose of 
hepatitis B vaccine started accruing

 at age 93 days as with the other 
recommended 2-month vaccines.
Days undervaccinated was analyzed 
both as a continuous measure 
and as a dichotomous variable 
(up-to-date with no delays, yes or 
no). The dichotomous variable of 
days undervaccinated was labeled 
as up-to-date vaccination status, 
representing a clinically meaningful 
measure for providers. Infants with 
0 cumulative days undervaccinated 
at age 200 days were considered 
up-to-date. As a subanalysis, we 
assessed up-to-date status for 
measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) 
vaccine among infants with at least 
489 days of follow-up, when days 
undervaccinated for the first dose of 
MMR begins to accrue.
Statistical Methods
The study was powered to detect a 
clinically meaningful odds ratio (OR) 
of 1.8–2.2 for up-to-date vaccination 
status between the study arms. 
For this effect size, we required 
900 participants on the basis of an 
anticipated baseline vaccine hesitancy 
of 20%, a 3:2:1 allocation ratio, and 
a 2-sided α of .05. An a priori P value 
of <.05 was considered statistically 
significant. We conducted a modified 
intent-to-treat analysis by keeping the 
study arm assignment but excluding 
infants without outcome data from 
the analysis. Infants of participants 
were excluded if they disenrolled from 
KPCO after birth, enrolled after age 60 
days, were not continuously enrolled 
during their follow-up period, or were 
not using KPCO for primary health 
services. These exclusions help ensure 
complete ascertainment of vaccination 
data. Participants were also excluded 
if they requested to be removed 
from the study or experienced a fetal 
demise or death of the child. Although 
we screened infants for documented 
contraindications to vaccines, 
premature infants were not excluded 
because they are to receive vaccines 
according to the recommended 
schedule.31
Days undervaccinated and up-to-
date vaccination status were 
assessed from birth to age 200 days. 
Because of the skewed distribution 
of days undervaccinated, we used 
a nonparametric analysis and rank 
transformation approach.32 We ranked 
the days undervaccinated for all infants 
and then compared the mean ranks 
across study arms using 1-way analysis 
of variance. Up-to-date vaccination 
status was analyzed by using logistic 
regression to estimate ORs and 
associated 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs). Logistic regression was also used 
to assess MMR status among children 
with at least 489 days of follow-up. 
Data were analyzed with SAS 9.4 
software (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).
Results
study Participants and baseline 
characteristics
A total of 1093 pregnant women were 
recruited into the study (Fig 1). By 
using a 3:2:1 randomization ratio,  
542 participants were randomly 
assigned to VSM, 371 were assigned 
to VI, and 180 were assigned to UC. 
Baseline characteristics were evenly 
distributed across study arms (Table 1).  
Mean maternal age at enrollment 
was 31.6 years, and a majority of 
the population was white (86.9%) 
and college educated (82.8%). At 
enrollment, 14.1% of the population 
was classified as vaccine hesitant on 
the basis of the PACV screener, and 
>62% of participants reported using 
the Internet for health information at 
least weekly. Median vaccine hesitancy 
scores were 13, 17, and 15 for the VSM, 
VI, and UC arms, respectively (P = .44).
A lack of outcome data led to the 
exclusion of 205 infants (18.8%); 
infants were excluded because they 
were disenrolled from KPCO after 
birth (n = 16), enrolled after age 
60 days (n = 21), had incomplete 
follow-up because of loss of 
insurance (n = 159), were not using 
KPCO for primary care services  
(n = 5), or had a fetal demise (n = 4) 
(Fig 1). There were no infants with 
documented contraindications to 
vaccines. Loss to follow-up ranged 
from 17.2% to 19.9% across study 
arms. Among participants lost to 
follow-up, median vaccine hesitancy 
scores were not significantly 
different across the arms (P = .97).
usage and interaction
Of 739 participants in the VSM and  
VI arms with 200 days of follow-up, 
259 (35.0%) visited the Web sites at 
least once, with a mean of 1.8  
(SD = 1.7) and range of 1 to 15 visits. 
Of 75 vaccine-hesitant participants, 
33 (44.0%) visited the Web sites 
compared with 226 (34.0%) of the 
664 nonhesitant participants. Over 
the study period, the VSM Web site 
offered 59 blog entries and 31 chat 
sessions. Participants in the VSM arm 
(n = 442) contributed 90 comments 
and questions. A majority of the 
interaction was between participants 
and the research team rather than 
between participants.
effectiveness
Mean ranks for days undervaccinated 
were 438.5, 443.0, and 465.4 for the 
VSM, VI, and UC arms, respectively. 
Infants in the VSM arm had a lower 
mean rank for days undervaccinated 
than infants in the UC arm  
(difference = −26.9; P value = .02; 
 
Table 2). Mean ranks did not differ 
significantly between the VI and UC 
arms or the VSM and VI arms.
The proportion of infants up-to-
date at the end of follow-up were 
92.5, 91.3, and 86.6 for the VSM, VI, 
and UC arms, respectively. Infants 
in the VSM arm were more likely 
to be up-to-date at age 200 days 
than infants in the UC arm (OR = 
1.92; 95% CI, 1.07–3.47; Table 3). 
Up-to-date status did not differ 
significantly between the VI and UC 
arms or the VSM and VI arms. The 
interaction between study arm and 
baseline vaccine hesitancy status 
was not statistically significant

from birth to age 200 days in KPCO 
(n = 8877) during the study period, 
the rate of up-to-date status was 
86.3%, suggesting that the UC infant 
population was representative of the 
overall KPCO infant population.
For the MMR subanalysis, there were 
776 (71%) infants with at least 489 
days of continuous follow-up. The 
proportion of infants who received 
MMR by the end of follow-up were 
95.6, 95.5, and 91.8 for the VSM, VI, 
and UC arms, respectively. Although 
none of the study arm comparisons 
were statistically significant, infants in 
the VSM and VI arms were ∼2  
times more likely to have received 
MMR than infants in the UC arm 
(Table 4).
discussion
This RCT of a Web-based vaccine 
information and social media 
intervention had a positive impact 
on early childhood immunization. 
Pregnant women exposed to the VSM 
arm were more likely to vaccinate 
their infants on time than participants 
receiving UC. These results suggest that 
interactive, informational interventions 
administered outside of the physician’s 
office can improve vaccine acceptance.
The authors of previous research 
have shown that the timing of vaccine 
information receipt is important 
to parents.5, 
 
7 Traditionally, vaccine 
information is provided to parents 
at well-child visits, although some 
parents make their vaccination 
decisions during pregnancy. In the

 absence of accurate information during 
pregnancy, parents may tend to rely on 
the Internet, which may expose them 
to misinformation.33 We found that 
providing accurate online information 
with interactive technologies during 
pregnancy has a positive impact on 
infant-vaccine acceptance.
Providing parents with information 
debunking vaccination falsehoods, 
such as the link between the 
MMR vaccination and autism, can 
cause vaccine-hesitant parents to 
become more entrenched in their 
antivaccination views and reduce their 
intentions to vaccinate.34 However, 
this backfire effect is likely modified 
by additional factors, such as the 
source, wording, tone, and timing 
of information.35 Our intervention 
demonstrated that parental vaccine 
behaviors can be positively influenced 
with a carefully timed, interactive, 
informational online resource

organization.
Although our VSM arm was designed 
to foster interaction between parents, 
almost all of the interaction was 
between parents and the research 
team. Parents who engaged in the 
social media applications were 
primarily interested in asking our 
experts questions to address their 
specific vaccine concerns. They 
did not appear to be interested in 
forming an ongoing, vaccine-focused 
online community with other parents 
enrolled in the KPCO health plan. Given 
that only 1% of digital health social 
network members actively contributed 
to the interaction, 
16 it is possible 
that more participant-to-participant 
engagement would be observed if the 
intervention was scaled across the 
entire health plan or made publically 
available.
Web-based interventions are low-cost 
and broadly accessible approaches 
to deliver important public health 
messages.36 However, the VSM arm in 
our trial required significant resources 
to administer. A multidisciplinary, 
expert staff developed and reviewed 
new content, moderated chat room 
discussions, answered complicated 
questions related to the vaccination 
schedule, and addressed vaccine safety 
rumors as they surfaced. Therefore, 
it is unlikely that single clinicians 
or clinics would have the means 
to manage their own social media 
interventions. This could be mitigated 
by creating a national, centralized 
social media vaccine resource, but 
additional research would need to 
determine if it would be trusted and 
used by parents. To help with these 
implementation decisions, a formal 
cost-effectiveness analysis of the VSM 
intervention is underway.
Social media technologies, Web 
site design preferences, and online 
information-gathering practices are 
constantly evolving. Such changes pose 
challenges to Web-based interventions. 
For example, our study period 
spanned more than 5 years from the 
development of the interventions 
through participant follow-up, data 
collection, and analysis. Over this 
time, newer social media platforms 
became increasingly popular among 
our target demographic population, 
including Twitter, Snapchat, and 
Instagram.37 Although it is not known 
if these platforms could be used to 
effectively address vaccine hesitancy, 
it is possible that our Web site 
appeared increasingly outdated and 
less appealing as the trial progressed. 
Therefore, future applications of our 
interventions would have to stay 
abreast of emerging technologies 
to continue to attract each new 
generation of parents.
This study had several limitations. 
The trial was conducted in a single, 
integrated health care system 
in Colorado, where the baseline 
vaccine hesitancy rate was 14.1%. 
Although this rate is similar to 
other investigations, there were 
only 99 hesitant participants in the 
analysis.15, 
 
38 As a result, we had 
limited statistical power to assess the 
interaction between study arm and 
vaccine hesitancy status.
Because this intervention was 
implemented as a pragmatic trial, we 
chose not to conduct a per-protocol 
analysis. Over the course of the trial, 
we gave participants in the VSM 
and VI arms unlimited access to the 
Web site, but they were not required 
to visit it. Of participants, ∼35% 
visited the Web site at least once, 
and hesitant participants were more 
likely to access the Web site than 
nonhesitant participants. This implies 
that a per-protocol analysis in which 
researchers examine an association 
between Web site exposure and 
immunization outcomes would be 
biased by baseline hesitancy.
The overall loss to follow-up rate in 
the trial was 18.8%, which is largely 
attributable to parents who did not use 
KPCO health insurance for pediatric 
care after their children were born. 
Although this may have affected the 
trial’s generalizability, the rate of loss 
to follow-up did not differ significantly 
across the study arms. In addition, the 
rate of vaccine hesitancy among those 
lost to follow-up was similar across the 
arms, suggesting that excluding these 
individuals did not affect the internal 
validity of the results.
conclusions
Despite these limitations, the results 
of this RCT demonstrate that Web-
based vaccine information with social 
media technologies can positively 
influence parental vaccine decisions. 
As a complement to routine well-child 
care, the information appears to be 
effective when presented to parents 
before their children are born.
