Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Studies suggest that a postnatal parental intervention may reduce the incidence 
of abusive head trauma (AHT) of infants and young children.
OBJECTIVE—To assess the effect of statewide universal AHT education for parents on AHT 
hospitalization rates in Pennsylvania and on parents’ self-reported knowledge gains and parenting 
behaviors.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Changes in AHT hospitalization rates in 
Pennsylvania before and during the intervention were compared with those in 5 other states 
lacking universal parental AHT education during the same period. Data were collected from 
maternity units and birthing centers throughout Pennsylvania from the parents of 1 593 834 infants

 born on these units from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2013. Parental behavior and knowledge 
were assessed through immediate (n = 16 111) and 7-month postintervention (n = 146) parent 
surveys in a per protocol analysis of evaluable parents.
INTERVENTIONS—Parents read a brochure, viewed an 8-minute video about infant crying and 
AHT, asked questions of the nurse, and signed a commitment statement affirming their 
participation. Educational posters were displayed on each unit.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Changes in AHT hospitalization rates before and 
during the intervention in Pennsylvania and 5 other states. Secondary outcomes included self-
reported knowledge gains and changes in parenting practices.
RESULTS—A total of 1 180 291 parents (74.1%) of children ranging in age from 0 to 23 months 
signed a commitment statement. Incidence rate ratios for hospitalization for AHT increased in 
Pennsylvania from 24.1 (95% CI, 22.1-26.3) to 26.6 (95% CI, 24.9-28.4) per 100 000 children 
aged 0 to 23 months during the intervention period; changes in Pennsylvania were not 
significantly different from aggregate changes in the 5 other states, from 22.4 (95% CI, 21.2-23.6) 
to 22.0 (95% CI, 21.2-22.8) per 100 000 children aged 0 to 23 months. A total of 16 111 parents 
(21.5% men, 78.5% women) completed the postnatal survey. Despite an overall 74.1% adherence 
with the intervention, only 20.6% of parents saw the brochure and video and only 5.7% were 
exposed to the entire intervention. Among the respondents answering individual questions on the 
postnatal surveys, 10 958 mothers (91.0%) and 2950 fathers (88.6%) reported learning a lot about 
understanding infant crying as normal; 11 023 mothers (92.2%) and 2923 fathers (88.9%), calming 
their infant, 11 396 mothers (94.6%) and 3035 fathers (91.9%), calming themselves; 10 060 
mothers (85.1%) and 2688 fathers (83.4%), selecting other infant caregivers; and 11 435 mothers 
(94.8%) and 3201 fathers (95.8%), that the information would decrease the likelihood of shaking 
an infant. Among the 143 respondents completing the 7-month survey, 109 (76.2%) reported 
remembering the information while their child was crying.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—This intervention was not associated with a reduction in 
pediatric AHT hospitalization rates but was associated with self-reported gains in parental 
knowledge that were retained for 7 months.
Abusive head trauma (AHT) accounts for most deaths due to physical abuse and most 
serious head injuries in infants.1 Several prevention efforts have been undertaken and 
resulted in improved parent knowledge,2–4 but few have examined the effect of such 
interventions on AHT incidence.5,6 In 1998, Dias and colleagues5 implemented a universal, 
postnatal parent education program in Upstate New York (Safe Babies New York [SBNY])7 
to teach parents about normal infant crying, calming a crying infant, reducing caregiver 
frustration, and the dangers of violent infant shaking. The program was associated with a 
47% reduction in AHT incidence during 6 years.5 An independent study of the program in 
another region of New York6 observed a 75% reduction. Likely because of these published 
results, at least 18 states, including Pennsylvania, have passed legislation mandating 
postnatal education about AHT for all parents. Based on the success of these pilot programs, 
we enacted a similar statewide intervention in Pennsylvania with the hypothesis that this 
program would significantly reduce AHT hospitalization rates.

 Methods
Intervention
Following a state legislative mandate enacted in 2002, the Pennsylvania Shaken Baby 
Syndrome Prevention Program8 began in 2003 in 31 central Pennsylvania counties and 
expanded in 2004 to include the remaining 22 western and 14 eastern counties. To the 4 
objectives of the SBNY program, we added a fifth (wisely selecting caregivers). The study 
was approved by Penn State College of Medicine’s institutional review board, which 
provided a waiver of consent.
Our program included the following key principles: (1) educate parents of all infants; (2) 
educate especially fathers and father figures; (3) provide information at a consistent time; (4) 
have nurses deliver the intervention; (5) incorporate multimedia and native languages; (6) 
administer before infants leave the hospital; (7) have parents sign a commitment statement 
affirming participation; and (8) require little time from nurses or parents.
Parents of infants born at all maternity units and birthing centers, but not born at home, from 
January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2013, were asked to read a brochure,9 view an 8-minute 
video Portrait of Promise (Midwest Children’s Resource Center), ask questions of the nurse, 
and sign the commitment statement. Posters (“Never, Never, Never, Never Shake a Baby”; 
SBS Prevention Plus) were also displayed on the unit. Mothers and, whenever present, 
fathers and father figures were asked to participate. English- and Spanish-language 
brochures and videos were provided; other brochure languages were available from the 
Pennsylvania Department of Health (http://www.doh.pa.gov/shakenbaby). Nurses were 
asked to provide AHT information separately from other safety information. Both parents 
individually signed the commitment statement; parents’ signature lines were obscured to 
preserve anonymity. Hospital adherence was measured by the percentage of signed 
commitment statement forms.
From January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2011, we introduced an additional intervention for 
parents, delivered through pediatric primary care professionals’ offices in 16 randomly 
selected central Pennsylvania counties. This intervention, to be provided at the 2-, 4-, and 6-
month office visits, was intended as a supplement to the postnatal information. Parents were 
asked to read a “crying card” focused on how to respond to infant crying and the dangers of 
violent infant shaking and sign a response card, similar to the commitment statement, 
confirming their participation. Only 30% of pediatric care professionals’ offices in the 
selected counties participated, and we received signed response forms from parents of only 
20.5% of infants born in these counties. Moreover, no significant changes in state registry 
reports of AHT were found among these counties during the intervention compared with 
counties that lacked this booster program. We therefore combined the hospitalization rates 
for all counties in our analyses.
Nurse Training
Hospital nurses were trained by 3 research nurse coordinators (C.M.R., K.M.C., and M.E.R.) 
who provided multiple 1-hour in-service programs (approved for continuing education 
credit) for each unit to review the purpose of the intervention, the legislative mandate, the

 consequences of AHT, the importance of consistently delivering the intervention and 
collecting the signed commitment statement, and confronting barriers to implementation. 
Nurses reviewed the brochure and video that parents would see. The nurse coordinators 
maintained frequent contact with nurse managers, with a mean of 26 telephone, email, and 
face-to-face communications with each manager per year, and disseminated quarterly 
newsletters.
Tracking AHT Hospitalization Rates
A statewide discharge data set from the Pennsylvania Healthcare Cost Containment Council 
(PHC4)10 was queried to identify nonfatal probable AHT cases using Center for Disease 
Control and Prevention–defined combinations of diagnosis and cause-of-injury codes from 
the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision.11 Hospitalization rates per 100 
000 same-aged population were calculated using probable case definitions and broad 
hospitalization rates previously published by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention.11 This method has been used to calculate a range of AHT hospitalization 
rates12–14; probable case definitions and broad rates are best suited to assess the effect of 
prevention efforts.11 Case ascertainment based on these definitions may have a sensitivity 
and specificity as high as 92% and 96%, respectively.15 For comparison purposes, AHT 
hospitalization rates were similarly calculated from Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project 
(HCUP) state inpatient data sets for 5 states (Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Oregon, and South 
Carolina) that had complete data for the period of interest and lacked universal AHT 
prevention efforts; we compared PHC4 hospitalization rates with the mean hospitalization 
rates from the other 5 states.
Hospitalization rates from Pennsylvania and the 5 other states were compared during 1996 
to 2002 (period 1), immediately preceding the intervention16; 2003 to 2006 (period 2), when 
statewide compliance with the intervention rose steadily toward 90%; and 2007 to 2013 
(period 3), when statewide compliance rates were consistently 90% or greater. For each data 
set, preintervention rates (period 1) were compared with rates during the entire intervention 
period (periods 2 + 3) and during the period after full implementation (period 3) using 
Poisson regression models with incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% CIs. Changes in the 
Pennsylvania hospitalization rates during the intervention were then compared with the 
changes in the other 5 states during these same periods using a ratio of the 2 IRRs. Because 
no individual-level descriptors were available in either of these data sets, no analysis of 
covariates was possible. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (version 
9.4; SAS Institute Inc) with a significance level of P < .05.
Parent Surveys
Two sets of surveys were distributed to parents from 2008 to 2011. During 1 month of every 
year, each hospital distributed a written postnatal survey to all parents immediately after the 
intervention asking what program elements they received and which element was most 
effective. Using a 4-point Likert scale (3, strongly agree; 2, agree; 1, disagree; and 0, 
strongly disagree), parents were asked whether they learned “a lot” about understanding 
infant crying as normal, calming a crying infant, calming themselves, and selecting other 
caregivers and whether the intervention would reduce the likelihood that a parent would

 shake an infant. Respondents provided 5 demographic characteristics—parents’ sex, age, 
highest educational attainment, marital status, and race/ethnicity—statistically associated 
with AHT in Pennsylvania16 and contact information for a follow-up survey. Three hundred 
families randomly selected from among postnatal survey respondents were mailed follow-up 
surveys at 7 postnatal months. The follow-up survey tested parents’ memory of the program 
and how it had influenced their decision making. The results of these surveys are presented 
descriptively.
Results
From January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2013, 1 180 291 signed commitment statements 
were returned, representing 74.1% of 1 593 834 births during this period; 98.6% of 
commitment statements were signed by mothers and 69.8% by fathers. After December 31, 
2006, signed commitment statements were consistently returned, representing 90% or more 
of live births in Pennsylvania.
AHT Hospitalization Rates
Calculated AHT hospitalization rates for the PHC4 and HCUP data sets (Figure) remained 
static or rose during the intervention (periods 2 + 3 and period 3 alone) for all age ranges 
compared with the preintervention period (period 1) in Pennsylvania (Table 1). We found no 
significant differences in the preintervention vs postintervention changes in Pennsylvania 
compared with the 5 other states for infants and children aged 0 to 11 or 0 to 23 months, 
although a significant increase in AHT hospitalization rates in Pennsylvania among children 
aged 12 to 23 months favored the comparison states (ratio of IRRs for periods 1 vs 3, 0.6; 
95% CI, 0.4–0.9; ratio of IRRs for periods 1 vs 2 + 3, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5–1.0) (Table 1).
Postnatal Survey Results
A total of 16 111 postnatal surveys were returned. Although fathers signed 69.8% of the 
commitment statements, they represented only 3467 (21.5%) survey respondents. 
Respondents were exposed most frequently to only 1 or 2 program elements; only 584 
mothers (4.6%) and 232 fathers (6.7%) had been exposed to all 5 elements (Table 2). 
Although 11 457 mothers (90.6%) and 3160 fathers (91.1%) had read the brochure or 
watched the video, only 2605 mothers (20.6%) and 708 fathers (20.4%) had done both. 
Respondents exposed to all program elements cited the video as most important. 
Respondents ranging from 74.7% to 94.6% reported learning a lot about the educational 
domains, although the normalcy of infant crying and how to calm themselves and their 
infant were more frequently cited than wisely choosing other caregivers (eTable 1 in the 
Supplement). Eighty-seven percent of respondents thought the information would decrease 
the likelihood that parents would shake an infant.
7-Month Survey Results
The 7-month surveys were returned by 146 of 300 parents (48.7% response rate); 3 surveys 
were excluded because the respondent did not indicate parent type. Among surveys having 
complete demographic information, 7-month survey respondents were demographically 
similar to the postnatal survey respondents for age, educational attainment, and marital

 status but were more frequently white (125 of 137 [91.2%] vs 11 774 of 14 793 [79.6%]; P 
= .001). All 93 mothers and 43 of 44 fathers (97.7%) who responded to the question recalled 
the postnatal intervention. Among those answering each individual survey question, 
respondents most frequently remembered signing the commitment statement (94 of 96 
mothers [97.9%] and 41 of 42 fathers [97.6%]) and reading the brochure (91 of 97 mothers 
[93.8%] and 41 of 42 fathers [97.6%]); they least frequently remembered the video (71 of 96 
mothers [74.0%] and 26 of 42 fathers [61.9%]) (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Most 7-month 
respondents reported learning a lot about the educational domains as noted in eTable 2 in the 
Supplement. Most (90 of 98 mothers [91.8%] and 40 of 42 fathers [92.2%]) thought the 
information would decrease the likelihood that parents would shake an infant. Seventy-four 
of 99 mothers (74.7%) and 35 of 44 fathers (79.5%) reported recalling the information while 
their infant was crying. The information was shared with others by 46 of 98 mothers 
(46.9%) and 15 of 43 fathers (34.9%), including parents’ relatives (26 of 99 mothers 
[26.3%] and 11 of 44 fathers [25.0%]), friends (16 of 99 mothers [16.2%] and 2 of 44 
fathers [4.5%]), and the infants’ babysitters (5 of 98 mothers [5.1%] and 4 of 44 fathers 
[9.1%]). One hundred nine of 143 respondents (76.2%) thought the information helped them 
to select other caregivers, and 38 of 143 (26.6%) changed their selection of caregivers based 
on this information.
Discussion
This study is, to our knowledge, the largest study of universal hospital-based parent 
education about AHT to date. Despite widespread dissemination of the intervention as a 
whole and the admission by most parents that the intervention provided significant 
educational value, this statewide AHT prevention program failed to reduce rates of 
hospitalization for AHT in Pennsylvania. Another study of hospital-based parental education 
in North Carolina that used different materials (Period of PURPLE Crying program; 
National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome)17 also failed to significantly reduce AHT rates.
The combined results of these 2 large studies contradict the conclusions of earlier, smaller 
studies in Upstate5 and Downstate New York6 that had suggested a positive effect of 
postnatal parental education on AHT rates. A case-control study of a similar intervention in 
Utah by Keenan and Leventhal18 had warned that the effect might not be intervention 
specific because reductions of AHT incidence also correlated with exposure to alternative 
parenting messages such as car seat use, sleep positioning, and bathwater temperature. 
Nonetheless, the results of preliminary studies sparked widespread local and statewide 
efforts to reduce AHT through universal parent education. Several programs, such as the 
“Don’t Shake the Baby,”19 “Love Me…Never Shake Me,”20 the Period of PURPLE Crying,
2–4 and the SBNY model,5,6 were shown to increase parents’ knowledge of and attitudes 
toward infant crying and infant soothing, reduce their frustration and anger, and improve 
their understanding about the consequences of violent infant shaking. Most participants 
recommended such interventions to all parents of newborn infants.5,6,20 The present study 
confirms and extends these observations that the information is valuable for parents, over 
three-quarters of whom thought about it while their infant was crying during the ensuing 
months and many of whom used it to select other caregivers. Although a sizeable minority

 of parents shared the information with others, reaching caregivers (particularly new father 
figures) that enter later into the infant’s life remains a challenge.
The reductions in AHT incidence in prior studies may be a statistical aberration, although 
the duration (6 years) during which the effect in the SBNY program was demonstrated and 
its stability over this time, the replication of the results in another region at a different time, 
and the low incidence rates during the intervention in these regions compared with other 
published incidence rates12–14,21–23 makes these findings more compelling. One must 
therefore carefully examine the reason(s) we were unable to demonstrate a similar effect of 
this intervention in Pennsylvania. We considered 6 potential explanations for this 
discrepancy. The most obvious explanation is that the intervention, however well 
intentioned, is simply not effective, and the conclusions drawn from smaller initial studies 
were premature. The results of this and the North Carolina study17 suggest that, although 
providing parents with a single educational experience may improve their knowledge, it 
unfortunately does not change their behavior. However, we considered 5 other potential 
explanations for our negative results. First, greater recognition of AHT may have occurred 
during the Pennsylvania intervention, although no evidence supports this hypothesis. In fact, 
the PHC4 hospitalization rate was higher than the HCUP rate, particularly among the group 
aged 0 to 11 months, and, for the groups aged 0 to 11 and 0 to 23 months, did not rise to a 
significantly greater degree than the HCUP rates during the intervention period (Table 2).
Second is the difficulty of maintaining program fidelity on a much larger scale. The 
postnatal survey results suggest a significant problem delivering the entire program. Nearly 
half of the parents had not seen the video that they consider the most important element of 
the intervention in this and other studies,5,24 and only 20.5% had seen the brochure and 
video. This finding is striking in that the maternity units knew they were being evaluated 
during survey months, and the surveys were completed immediately after the intervention 
(reducing recall bias). Anecdotally, several parents who knew about the program told us they 
had not received it; one parent who asked was told “we no longer offer that here.” Hospital 
adherence often declined in association with changes in nursing leadership or staffing. Some 
lost, and temporarily stopped showing, their video. Finally, 1 hospital had parents sign the 
commitment statement on admission before the program was delivered. In sum, the full 
extent of implementation challenges and how they affected the outcomes are unclear.
Third, the intervention may not have adequately reached families at higher risk for AHT 
based on demographics.16 However, we found no clinically significant differences in 
program delivery based on parent demographics. Perhaps combining postnatal education 
with additional interventions, such as home visitation,25,26 might be more effective for high-
risk families.
Fourth, several studies27–30 have documented a substantial rise in AHT rates (≤65%) during 
the US great recession from December 2007 through June 2009 and from which the country 
has subsequently struggled to emerge. These rates have not dropped substantially in 
subsequent years.30 Rates of hospitalization for AHT in the PHC4 and HCUP data sets rose 
significantly across all 3 age ranges after 2006. Such a rise may have masked reductions 
brought about by the intervention, although the rise in Pennsylvania was similar to that in 
Dias et al.

 the 5 other states for infants and children aged 0 to 11 and 0 to 23 months (it is unlikely that 
the rise in the group aged 12-23 months would be due to the intervention, absent similar 
differences in the other age groups).
Fifth, the intervention may work better for parents in Upstate New York than those in 
Pennsylvania. To investigate this possibility, we compared the demographics in both regions 
from the 2010 US Census and found no important differences in median household income, 
employment rates, and the proportions of high school graduates, population living below the 
poverty line, and population moving out of state. Other demographic differences may not 
have been identified.
Limitations
The study would have been strengthened by comparing 2 contemporaneous groups (with and 
without the intervention) in Pennsylvania. However, the state mandate requiring AHT 
education for parents of all newborn infants made this attempt impossible. Second, 
unrecognized confounders in Pennsylvania or the other states might have affected the 
results. Third, the study excluded fatal cases of AHT that never made it to a hospital and 
therefore underestimates the true incidence. However, assuming this number is small and 
similar between Pennsylvania and the other states, this exclusion does not affect the 
analyses. Fourth, a potential selection bias existed among the postnatal and 7-month survey 
respondents. Finally, 7-month survey respondents are subject to recall bias.
Conclusions
Our results demonstrate that a postnatal, hospital-based parent intervention is well received 
by parents of newborn infants and provides information that enhances their understanding of 
infant crying and violent infant shaking. Unfortunately, neither our intervention nor a similar 
postnatal intervention in North Carolina17 reduced rates of hospitalizations for AHT. 
Although these results are certainly disappointing, they should not dissuade us from 
continuing our efforts to reduce AHT. Perhaps supplementing this information repeatedly to 
parents over time (eg, with serial text messages); combining such information with family 
and community supports, such as home visitation for high-risk families25,26,31; and/or 
providing policies, such as paid family leave,32 that better support families during this 
critical period would reduce AHT.

 Key Points
Question
Does universal parental education about infant crying and the dangers of violent infant 
shaking during the immediate postnatal period reduce hospitalization rates for abusive 
head trauma?
Findings
In this prospective comparative study, a statewide abusive head trauma intervention was 
not associated with a significant reduction in the overall hospitalization rates for abusive 
head trauma among infants aged 0 to 23 months compared with 5 other states lacking 
such a statewide intervention, although parents did report significant knowledge gains 
from the intervention.
Meaning
Other or additional types of interventions may be needed to reduce hospitalization rates 
for abusive head trauma of infants and young children.

 Figure. Annual Rates of Hospitalization for Abusive Head Trauma
Rates are calculated among infants and children aged 0 to 11, 12 to 23, and 0 to 23 months 
in the Pennsylvania Healthcare Cost Containment Council (PHC4) data set and 5 other states 
(Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project [HCUP] data set) before (1996–2002), during 
(2003–2006), and after (2007–2013) fully implementing the educational intervention. 
Vertical lines separate the 3 periods.
