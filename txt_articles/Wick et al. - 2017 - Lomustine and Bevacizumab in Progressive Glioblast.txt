BACKGROUND
Bevacizumab is approved for the treatment of patients with progressive glioblastoma on 
the basis of uncontrolled data. Data from a phase 2 trial suggested that the addition of 
bevacizumab to lomustine might improve overall survival as compared with monother­
apies. We sought to determine whether the combination would result in longer overall 
survival than lomustine alone among patients at first progression of glioblastoma.
METHODS
We randomly assigned patients with progression after chemoradiation in a 2:1 ratio to 
receive lomustine plus bevacizumab (combination group, 288 patients) or lomustine 
alone (monotherapy group, 149 patients). The methylation status of the promoter of 
O6­methylguanine–DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) was assessed. Health­related qual­
ity of life and neurocognitive function were evaluated at baseline and every 12 weeks. 
The primary end point of the trial was overall survival.
RESULTS
A total of 437 patients underwent randomization. The median number of 6­week treat­
ment cycles was three in the combination group and one in the monotherapy group. With 
329 overall survival events (75.3%), the combination therapy did not provide a survival 
advantage; the median overall survival was 9.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.1 
to 10.1) in the combination group and 8.6 months (95% CI, 7.6 to 10.4) in the mono­
therapy group (hazard ratio for death, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.21; P 
= 
0.65). Locally as­
sessed progression­free survival was 2.7 months longer in the combination group than in 
the monotherapy group: 4.2 months versus 1.5 months (hazard ratio for disease progres­
sion or death, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.61; P<0.001). Grade 3 to 5 adverse events occurred 
in 63.6% of the patients in the combination group and 38.1% of the patients in the 
monotherapy group. The addition of bevacizumab to lomustine affected neither health­
related quality of life nor neurocognitive function. The MGMT status was prognostic.
CONCLUSIONS
Despite somewhat prolonged progression­free survival, treatment with lomustine plus 
bevacizumab did not confer a survival advantage over treatment with lomustine alone 
in patients with progressive glioblastoma. (Funded by an unrestricted educational

Lomustine and Bevacizumab in Progressive Glioblastoma
N
o standard of care has been estab-
lished for patients with progressive glio­
blastoma. Previous studies suggested that 
bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets 
vascular endothelial growth factor, is safe and 
produces responses1 that result in a decreased use 
of glucocorticoids and increased progression­free 
survival. The BRAIN trial,1 supported by a single­
group study,2 led to accelerated approval in the 
United States, followed by a multitude of uncon­
trolled series and molecular3 and imaging4,5 bio­
marker research. Controlled data are lacking ex­
cept for those of the BELOB trial,6 which support 
the use of bevacizumab in combination with 
lomustine; data from an Italian phase 2 study 
showed the efficacy of bevacizumab to be infe­
rior to that of fotemustine when used singly.7 
Randomized trials involving patients with newly 
diagnosed glioblastoma showed no overall sur­
vival benefit from bevacizumab alone.8­10
In the BELOB trial, the rate of overall survival 
at 9 and 12 months was higher with the combi­
nation of bevacizumab and lomustine than with 
either agent alone. Because bevacizumab was 
not accessible in the Netherlands, crossover to 
bevacizumab in the control group was restricted 
(one patient).6 The EORTC (European Organiza­
tion for Research and Treatment of Cancer) 
26101 phase 2 trial was a four­group trial to 
evaluate the most effective sequence of bevacizu­
mab and lomustine treatment. It was nearing 
completion when the first internal report of the 
BELOB trial was released. No end point of the 
phase 2 EORTC 26101 trial had been evaluated 
before the expansion to a phase 3 trial.11
After the ongoing phase 2 trial was modified 
into a phase 3 trial, patients were enrolled in a 
group receiving either bevacizumab and lomus­
tine in combination or lomustine as a single 
agent. Here, we report the final data on safety 
and efficacy in the phase 3 trial.
Methods
Trial Design
This randomized phase 3 trial compared patients 
with glioblastoma who received lomustine alone 
(monotherapy group) with those who received a 
combination of lomustine and bevacizumab (com­
bination group) at first progression of glioblas­
toma after standard chemoradiotherapy.12 The 
EORTC used four stratification criteria to cen­
trally randomly assign patients who had entered 
the trial13,14 (see the Methods section in the Sup­
plementary Appendix, available with the full text 
of this article at NEJM.org). The primary end 
point was overall survival, defined as the time 
from randomization to death. Secondary end 
points included progression­free survival, land­
mark analyses for progression­free and overall 
survival, toxic effects according to version 4.0 of 
the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events, response rates according to the Response 
Assessment in Neuro­Oncology (RANO) criteria15 
(see the Methods section in the Supplementary 
Appendix), neurologic deterioration–free survival 
(defined as the time from randomization to docu­
mentation of neurologic deterioration or death), 
clinical or neurologic deterioration–free survival, 
glucocorticoid use, health­related quality of life 
of both patients and health care proxies, the de­
velopment of symptoms of neurocognitive dete­
rioration, and assessments of predictive factors.
Eligibility
Patients were accepted into the trial after histo­
logic confirmation of glioblastoma with unequiv­
ocal first progression after chemoradiotherapy 
at least 3 months after the end of radiotherapy. 
Tumor tissue was required for central review and 
translational research. Patients were excluded if 
they had undergone antiangiogenic treatment. 
Radiotherapy at a dose of no more than 65 Gy 
with stereotactic radiosurgery or brachytherapy 
was allowed if recurrence was histologically 
proven. Only non–enzyme­inducing antiepileptic 
drugs were allowed (for further eligibility criteria, 
see the Methods section in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Treatment
Patients in the monotherapy group received lo­
mustine at a dose of 110 mg per square meter of 
body­surface area every 6 weeks (maximum dose, 
200 mg). Patients in the combination group re­
ceived lomustine at a dose of 90 mg per square 
meter every 6 weeks (maximum dose, 160 mg) 
plus bevacizumab at a dose of 10 mg per kilo­
gram of body weight every 2 weeks. In both 
groups, the trial regimen was followed by the 
investigator’s choice of treatment at further pro­
gression. In the combination group, if there 
were no hematologic toxic effects of a grade of 
more than 1 during the first cycle, the dose of 
lomustine was increased to 110 mg per square 
meter (maximum dose, 200 mg) for the second

cycle. In each cycle, which was defined as 6 weeks 
for each group, day 1 was the first day of medi­
cation.
Baseline Examinations and Follow-up
The baseline evaluation included magnetic reso­
nance imaging (MRI), questionnaires on health­
related quality of life, neurocognitive testing, full 
clinical and neurologic evaluations, electrocardi­
ography, complete blood count, blood chemical 
analyses, and urinalysis. All patients were evalu­
ated for vital signs, adverse events, blood counts, 
and urine dipstick results every 2 weeks. Between 
weeks 6 and 24, weekly full clinical and neuro­
logic workup, blood examinations, and MRI 
were performed; questionnaires on health­related 
quality of life and neurocognitive testing were 
performed every 3 months. After week 24, exami­
nations were carried out at 3­month intervals.
Images were assessed according to RANO cri­
teria,15 with additional quantification of changes 
on fluid­attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) 
images or T2­weighted images.16 All the assess­
ments and interpretations of disease status were 
performed locally but with continuous central 
quality control and independent central assess­
ment (see the Methods section in the Supplemen­
tary Appendix).
Pathological Review and Molecular Testing
Pathological reviews and molecular testing were 
performed centrally with the use of archival tis­
sue from the primary surgery. Isocitrate dehy­
drogenase (IDH) mutations were assessed on the 
basis of the glioma CpG island methylator phe­
notype,17 and O6­methylguanine–DNA methyl­
transferase (MGMT) promoter methylation was 
assessed with the use of Illumina 450k methyla­
tion arrays based on the MGMT­STP27 model18 
(see the Methods section in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Questionnaires on Health-Related Quality  
of Life
The EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire–Core 
30 (QLQ­C30) and EORTC brain­cancer module 
(BN20) are well­established tools that have been 
validated and translated into all eight languages 
of patients involved in this trial.19 Items from 
both measurements were scaled, scored20 (where­
by responses were aggregated and transformed 
to a linear scale that ranged from 0 to 100, in 
which a higher score represented a higher level 
of functioning [function scales] or a higher level 
of symptoms [symptom scales]), and evaluated.21 
If at least half the items in the scale were com­
pleted, the scale score was calculated with only 
those items for which values existed. Preselected 
scales for analysis were global health status, 
physical functioning, social functioning, motor 
dysfunction, and communication deficit. Scores 
for health­related quality of life during the last 
assessment after baseline until week 36 were 
calculated and compared between treatment 
groups, as well as mean changes from baseline 
until weeks 12, 24, and 36. A difference of at 
least 10 points between treatment groups was 
considered to be clinically relevant. More details 
are provided in the Methods section in the Sup­
plementary Appendix.
Assessment of Neurocognitive Functioning
Neurocognitive functioning was assessed with 
standardized psychometric instruments: the Hop­
kins Verbal Learning Test–Revised,22 Trail Making 
Test (A and B),23 and Controlled Oral Word As­
sociation.24 Neurocognitive assessments were per­
formed in a fixed order with the use of alterna­
tive forms to control for test–retest effects at 
baseline and every 12 weeks (see the Methods 
section in the Supplementary Appendix).
Trial Oversight
Staff at the EORTC and the first author reviewed 
all the data. The EORTC was the trial sponsor 
and vouches for the integrity, accuracy, and com­
pleteness of the data. All the analyses were done 
by the investigators and EORTC staff, who vouch 
for the adherence of the trial to the protocol 
(available at NEJM.org). The first draft of the 
manuscript was written by the first author. No 
one who is not an author contributed to the writ­
ing of the manuscript. F. Hoffmann–La Roche 
supported EORTC 26101 through an educational 
grant and provided bevacizumab free of charge 
but had no role in analyzing the data or writing 
the manuscript.
Statistical Analysis
We calculated that at least 327 overall survival 
events (deaths) would be required for the trial to 
have 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.72

Lomustine and Bevacizumab in Progressive Glioblastoma
(rate of overall survival at 9 months of 51.7% in 
the combination group and 40% in the mono­
therapy group), on the basis of a one­sided log­
rank test at a significance level of 2.5%. The 
accrual assumptions for the two groups in the 
phase 3 trial are summarized in the Methods 
section in the Supplementary Appendix. Overall 
and progression­free survival curves were estimat­
ed with the use of the Kaplan–Meier technique. 
Analyses were conducted on an intention­to­treat 
basis. Differences in overall and progression­free 
survival between the two groups were formally 
compared with the use of a stratified one­sided 
log­rank test at a 2.5% significance level. The 
stratification factors are those used at random­
ization (except institution) and a variable indi­
cating whether the patient was recruited in the 
phase 2 or 3 portion. Analyses used the stratifi­
cation according to the EORTC online random­
ization system. The treatment effect was esti­
mated as a hazard ratio (with a two­sided 95% 
confidence interval) with the use of a stratified 
Cox proportional­hazards model (same stratifi­
cation factors). Assessments of predictive factors 
are detailed in the Methods section in the Sup­
plementary Appendix.
Results
Patients
A total of 437 patients underwent randomiza­
tion; 149 (38 in the phase 2 part and 111 in the 
phase 3 part of the trial) received lomustine 
alone and 288 (77 and 211, respectively) received 
lomustine plus bevacizumab over a period of 37 
months from November 2011 through December 
2014 at 38 institutions in eight countries. Patient 
characteristics were well balanced between the 
two groups (Table 1, and Table S1 in the Supple­
mentary Appendix). Molecular information was 
available for 367 of 437 patients (84.0%), and a 
central neuroradiologic review was performed in 
418 of 437 patients (95.7%) (Fig. 1).
Treatment Delivery and Adverse Events
Randomized treatment was started for 98.7% of 
the patients in the monotherapy group and 98.3% 
in the combination group (Fig. 1). Patients in the 
monotherapy group received a median of 1 cycle 
of lomustine (range, 1 to 8), and patients in the 
combination group received a median of 3 cycles 
of lomustine (range, 1 to 8) and 3 cycles of 
bevacizumab (range, 1 to 16). The main reason 
for discontinuing treatment was disease progres­
sion, in 120 of 144 patients (83.3%) in the lomus­
tine group, 186 of 264 patients (70.5%) for lo­
mustine in the combination group, and 208 of 
264 patients (78.8%) for bevacizumab in the 
combination group. The discrepancy between 
stopping bevacizumab and stopping lomustine 
in the combination group was a result of treat­
ment scheduling or toxic effects (15 of 144 pa­
tients [10.4%] in the monotherapy group, 53 of 
264 [20.1%] for lomustine in the combination 
group, and 38 of 264 [14.4%] for bevacizumab in 
the combination group).
Grade 3 to 5 adverse events occurred in 38.1% 
of the patients in the monotherapy group and in 
63.6% of the patients in the combination group. 
Adverse events of grade 3 to 5 of special interest 
were pulmonary embolism, arterial hypertension, 
and hematologic toxic effects. One patient in the 
monotherapy group died from a lung infection 
that was unrelated to the tumor. In the combi­
nation group, five deaths were noted (two from 
myocardial infarction and one each from large­
intestine perforation, sepsis, and intracranial 
hemorrhage) (Table 2).
Efficacy End Points
With 329 overall survival events (75.3%), the 
combination treatment did not provide a sur­
vival advantage. The median overall survival was 
8.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.6 to 
10.4) in the monotherapy group and 9.1 months 
(95% CI, 8.1 to 10.1) in the combination group 
according to local assessments (hazard ratio for 
death in the combination group, 0.95; 95% CI, 
0.74 to 1.21; P 
= 
0.65) (Fig. 2A). The median 
progression­free survival was 1.5 months (95% 
CI, 1.5 to 2.5) in the monotherapy group and 
4.2 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 4.3) in the combina­
tion group according to local assessments (hazard 
ratio for disease progression or death in the 
combination group, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.61; 
P<0.001) (Fig. 2B). Landmark survival at 9 and 
12 months is shown in Figure 2A.
No subgroup showed particular benefits from 
bevacizumab; male patients derived the least 
benefit. No factor predicted benefit (Table S2A 
in the Supplementary Appendix). A total of 397 
of 430 patients (92.3%) had measurable disease,

Lomustine and Bevacizumab in Progressive Glioblastoma
progression­free survival was 1.5 months (95% 
CI, 1.5 to 1.6) in the monotherapy group and 3.8 
months (95% CI, 3.0 to 4.2) in the combination 
group (hazard ratio for disease progression or 
death in the combination group, 0.59; 95% CI, 
0.48 to 0.74; P<0.001). Central and local neuro­
radiologic review had a concordance of 48%; the 
central review called progression before the local 
assessment in 28.4% of the patients and after 
the local assessment in 17.8% of the patients 
(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Glucocorticoid use was equally distributed be­
tween the two groups and almost evenly split 
between use and no use (Table 1). Of the 222 
patients (78 in the monotherapy group and 144 
in the combination group) who did not receive 
glucocorticoids at baseline, 86 patients (30 [38.5%] 
and 56 [38.9%] in the respective groups) began 
to receive them during treatment. No significant 
difference in the time before starting glucocor­
ticoids was observed between the combination 
group (median, 8.3 months; 95% CI, 6.8 to not 
reached) and the monotherapy group (median, 
8.6 months; 95% CI, 4.5 to 12.7) (P 
= 
0.33).
After disease progression occurred while they 
were receiving the trial treatment, 65.9% of the 
patients in the monotherapy group and 53.0% of 
the patients in the combination group received 
further therapy (401 patients had a progression 
event, of whom 368 had follow­up information), 
including crossovers to off­label use of bevacizu­
mab in 35.5% of the monotherapy group and 
18.7% of the combination group (Table 3).
Health-Related Quality of Life
Data on health­related quality of life at baseline 
were available for 92.0% of the patients (402 of 
437), with a decrease to 66.3% at week 36, limit­
ing further analysis. There were no significant 
differences between the treatment groups until 
week 36, when adherence favored the combina­
tion group (71.2%, vs. 50.0% in the monother­
apy group). No significant between­group dif­
ferences were observed for preselected scales, 
apart from a lower score for social functioning 
in the combination group than in the mono­

Lomustine and Bevacizumab in Progressive Glioblastoma
If progression was not included as an event, 
there was no significant difference in time to 
deterioration in health­related quality of life be­
tween the monotherapy group and the combina­
tion group (median, 13.0 weeks and 13.1 weeks, 
respectively; P 
= 
0.65). This contrasts with deteri­
oration­free survival, which was longer in the 
combination group than in the monotherapy 
group (12.4 weeks vs. 6.7 weeks; P<0.001), re­
flecting the difference in time to progression.
Neurocognitive Outcome
Adherence to the assessment of neurocognitive 
function was 94.5% at baseline and 61.4% at the 
third follow­up visit at 36 weeks. Adherence 
never differed significantly between the treatment 
groups. The primary analysis compared the six 
neurocognitive function scores at the last dis­
ease assessment before or at the third follow­up 
visit. Time points of the assessment of neuro­
cognitive function are shown in Table S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix. No significant differ­
ences were observed at baseline and follow­up 
between the two trial groups (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
MGMT Status
Technically sound MGMT results could not be 
obtained for 97 patients; in 70, no tumor tissue 
of appropriate quality was available. Of the re­
maining 270 patients, 124 (45.9%) had MGMT 
promoter hypermethylation. In the population as 
a whole, MGMT promoter methylation was prog­
nostic, with a median progression­free survival 
of 2.8 months (95% CI, 2.6 to 2.9) among pa­
tients with unmethylated promoters (146 patients 
with 143 events), 5.7 months (95% CI, 4.4 to 6.9) 
among patients with methylated promoters (124 
patients with 103 events), 3.0 months (95% CI, 
2.8 to 4.2) among patients with undetermined 
results (97 patients with 89 events), and 2.9 
months (95% CI, 2.7 to 3.5) among patients for 
whom no material was available (70 patients 
with 68 events) (Table S6 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). The hazard ratio for disease progres­
sion or death with methylated MGMT status as 
compared with unmethylated MGMT status was 
0.37 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.49). MGMT status was not 
predictive of efficacy outcomes with the combi­
nation treatment (Table S2B and S2C in the Sup­
plementary Appendix). When data were separated 
according to treatment and MGMT status, pro­
gression­free but not overall survival was longer 
in the combination group than in the mono­
therapy group, whether the MGMT promoter was 
unmethylated or methylated in tumors (Table S7 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Patients with 
methylated MGMT status had a longer median 
overall survival from the time of randomization 
than those with unmethylated MGMT status: 
13.5 months (95% CI, 10.6 to 15.4) versus 8.0 
months (95% CI, 5.9 to 8.8) (hazard ratio for 
death, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.66; P<0.001).
Discussion
EORTC 26101 provided phase 3 data on the effi­
cacy of bevacizumab in patients with progressive 
glioblastoma. Adding bevacizumab to lomustine 
did not confer a survival advantage over lomus­
tine alone but prolonged progression­free survival 
somewhat. This benefit was consistent across the 
assessments of the trial, although there were 
some local and central deviations. EORTC 26101 
shows the feasibility of implementing a uniform 
MRI protocol in an international neuro­oncology 
trial. The central review deemed progression 
earlier than the local assessment in 96 patients 
in the combination group (Table S3 in the Sup­
plementary Appendix).25
There were no unexpected findings from as­
sessments of toxic effects, although absolute 
numbers were higher and deaths more frequent

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
in the combination group than in the mono­
therapy group. Although important given the 
lack of overall survival benefit, the higher num­
bers of adverse effects should be assessed relative 
to the longer treatment period in the combination 
group (Table 2). In addition to the difference in 
toxic effects, combination therapy had a negative 
effect on scores of social functioning and global 
health status at late time points (Table S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). These results are con­
sistent with findings regarding health­related 
quality of life in the BELOB trial.26 The addition 
of bevacizumab did not improve neurocognitive 
functioning, although the high performance level 
at baseline may prevent a systematic improve­
ment. However, the combination of bevacizu­
mab and lomustine also did not lead to poorer 
neurocognitive function than lomustine alone, 
although the 36 weeks during which patient ad­
herence was satisfactory might have been too 
short to observe long­term differences between 
the groups (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Ap­
pendix).
Although earlier reports from the BRAIN trial 
(involving patients with recurrent glioblastoma)1 
and from the Avastin in Glioblastoma trial (in­
volving patients with newly diagnosed glioblas­
toma)8 suggested that bevacizumab had glucocor­
ticoid­sparing effects, the addition of bevacizumab 
in the current trial did not result in reduced use 
of glucocorticoids. MGMT status was not predic­
tive of benefit from the combined therapy.27 
Earlier data suggested that lomustine had little 
effect on MGMT unmethylated glioblastomas, 
and adding bevacizumab did not alter this con­
clusion.6
EORTC was unable to confirm the conclusion 
of phase 2 trials that the addition of bevacizu­
mab to lomustine improves survival in patients 
with progressive glioblastoma. The effect on 
progression­free survival was not associated with 
an increase in overall survival, and combination 
therapy was associated with increased toxicity.
