Summary
Background Unnecessary antibiotic prescribing contributes to antimicrobial resistance. In this trial, we aimed to 
reduce unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics by general practitioners (GPs) in England.
Methods In this randomised, 2 × 2 factorial trial, publicly available databases were used to identify GP practices whose 
prescribing rate for antibiotics was in the top 20% for their National Health Service (NHS) Local Area Team. Eligible 
practices were randomly assigned (1:1) into two groups by computer-generated allocation sequence, stratifi
 ed by NHS 
Local Area Team. Participants, but not investigators, were blinded to group assignment. On Sept 29, 2014, every GP 
in the feedback intervention group was sent a letter from England’s Chief Medical Offi
  cer and a leafl
 et on antibiotics 
for use with patients. The letter stated that the practice was prescribing antibiotics at a higher rate than 80% of 
practices in its NHS Local Area Team. GPs in the control group received no communication. The sample was 
re-randomised into two groups, and in December, 2014, GP practices were either sent patient-focused information 
that promoted reduced use of antibiotics or received no communication. The primary outcome measure was the rate 
of antibiotic items dispensed per 1000 weighted population, controlling for past prescribing. Analysis was by intention 
to treat. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN32349954, and has been completed.
Findings Between Sept 8 and Sept 26, 2014, we recruited and assigned 1581 GP practices to feedback intervention 
(n=791) or control (n=790) groups. Letters were sent to 3227 GPs in the intervention group. Between October, 2014, 
and March, 2015, the rate of antibiotic items dispensed per 1000 population was 126·98 (95% CI 125·68–128·27) in 
the feedback intervention group and 131·25 (130·33–132·16) in the control group, a diff
 erence of 4·27 (3·3%; 
incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0·967 [95% CI 0·957–0·977]; p<0·0001), representing an estimated 73 406 fewer antibiotic 
items dispensed. In December, 2014, GP practices were re-assigned to patient-focused intervention (n=777) or control 
(n=804) groups. The patient-focused intervention did not signifi
 cantly aff
 ect the primary outcome measure between 
December, 2014, and March, 2015 (antibiotic items dispensed per 1000 population: 135·00 [95% CI 133·77–136·22] in 
the patient-focused intervention group and 133·98 [133·06–134·90] in the control group; IRR for diff
 erence between 
groups 1·01, 95% CI 1·00–1·02; p=0·105).
Interpretation Social norm feedback from a high-profi
 le messenger can substantially reduce antibiotic prescribing at 
low cost and at national scale; this outcome makes it a worthwhile addition to antimicrobial stewardship programmes.

Introduction
The growth of antimicrobial resistance has been 
recognised as a worldwide public health problem that 
increases mortality, morbidity, and the cost of health 
care.1,2 There are concerns that future resistance will rise 
to levels that seriously disrupt important medical 
procedures.3 An important driver of resistance is the 
medical use of antibiotics when they are not clinically 
indicated.4 Primary care is a focus of antibiotic 
stewardship eff
 orts for several reasons: it accounts for a 
large 
proportion 
of 
antibiotic 
prescriptions; 
its 
prescribing practices have been linked to increased 
antimicrobial resistance; and there is extensive variation 
between practices, which suggests “signifi
 cant scope to 
improve prescribing”.5–7
Providing feedback has been shown to produce fairly 
small but important changes in health-care provider 
behaviour in general.8 However, studies of feedback 
specifi
 cally focused on antibiotic prescribing have 
produced mixed results: substantial improvements have 
come about from more complex, intensive interventions, 
rather than simple feedback.9–12 Nevertheless, there are 
strong theoretical and practical reasons for further 
examining the eff
 ect of feedback on antibiotic 
prescribing. First, the number of studies on this topic is 
still small and the quality of evidence they provide is 
low.10 Second, there are questions about whether more 
complex interventions can be scaled successfully and 
feasibly, since they are often resource intensive. Third, 
the success of current interventions depends greatly on

the way they are designed and implemented.10 Recently, 
there has been growing interest in the potential for 
the behavioural sciences to improve these aspects of 
antibiotic stewardship.13 A particularly promising option 
is social norm feedback: presenting information to show 
that individuals are outliers in their behaviour leads 
them to adjust their behaviour towards the social norm.14 
Moreover, since 2012, detailed primary care prescribing 
datasets have been made publicly available by the Health 
and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC).15 These 
data are often not actively fed back to prescribers, so 
there is potential to introduce feedback interventions to 
improve prescribing for little cost and on a large scale, as 
recently suggested in an analysis by the Department of 
Health and Public Health England.16 Accordingly, we 
undertook a nationwide randomised trial of a low-cost 
feedback intervention (clinician-focused letter plus leafl
 et 
for use with patients) that incorporated social norms and 
other fi
 ndings from the behavioural sciences to reduce 
antibiotic prescribing in primary care.
The publication of primary care prescribing datasets also 
off
 ers the much needed opportunity to assess a wider 
range of antibiotic stewardship interventions, in addition to 
feedback mechanisms. Campaigns aimed at the public and 
clinicians have been one of the most prevalent approaches 
to reduce antibiotic use, and have attracted substantial 
public funding.17 However, many of these campaigns have 
either not been assessed or their evaluations have had 
substantial methodological weaknesses; the availability of 
data for prescribing outcomes is a particular problem.17 
Public Health England had scheduled a patient-focused 
campaign to coincide with European Antibiotics Awareness 
Day 2014. Therefore, we took a pragmatic approach and 
amended our trial design to incorporate this patient-focused 
intervention, to determine whether it reduced prescribing 
on its own or in combination with the clinician-focused 
feedback intervention.
Methods
Study design and participants
In this pragmatic, 2 × 2 factorial randomised controlled 
trial, we recruited general practitioner (GP) practices in 
England using names and addresses from datasets of 
GPs and prescribing data from datasets published by the 
HSCIC. The units of recruitment and measurement were 
GP practices, because HSCIC prescribing data are 
available at practice level only. The study design 
incorporated two interventions. GP practices were fi
 rst 
randomised to the intervention or control group for the 
fi
 rst intervention, which took place in October, 2014. 
Every GP in a practice in the feedback intervention group 
was sent a clinician-focused letter and leafl
 et from 
England’s Chief Medical Offi
  cer. The control group 
received no communication. Practices were then 
re-randomised to the intervention or control group for the 
second intervention, which took place in December, 2014. 
In the second intervention, practices either received 
patient-focused posters and leafl
 ets (note that these were 
not sent to individual GPs, but rather to the practice 
manager) or no communication. This two-stage process 
resulted in a 2 × 2 factorial trial design, with four 
experimental groups by the end of the study period: those 
who were assigned to both interventions; those who were 
assigned to the feedback intervention only; those who 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We reviewed systematic reviews of interventions to reduce 
antimicrobial stewardship. We searched Google Scholar for 
terms “antibiotic prescribing”, “antibiotic stewardship”, or 
“antimicrobial stewardship”, in addition to the term “systematic 
review”. On review of abstracts, we selected studies published in 
English between Jan 1, 1980, and Feb 15, 2015, dealing with 
interventions to reduce prescribing in primary care or 
outpatient settings. Existing evidence suggests that feedback 
for antibiotic prescribing has produced mixed results, with the 
studies that reject the null hypothesis showing small eff
 ect 
sizes. The assessment of patient-focused information-based 
interventions using printed materials is often weak; high-
quality studies show no or small eff
 ects. More complex 
interventions to reduce prescribing have generally produced 
larger eff
 ect sizes, but it is unclear whether these interventions 
can be implemented at scale.
Added value of this study
Our study shows that a low-cost feedback intervention can 
reduce the rate at which antibiotic items are dispensed by 3·3% 
over 6 months. This eff
 ect compares favourably with results 
from the few comparable studies that exist, and suggests that 
tailored feedback is a worthwhile addition to antimicrobial 
stewardship programmes. Our trial also adds to other studies 
by incorporating fi
 ndings from the behavioural sciences, 
including social norms, messenger eff
 ects, and behavioural 
instruction. Our results show that a patient-focused 
information-based intervention may not aff
 ect prescribing 
behaviour. This study was implemented on a larger scale than 
many previous studies, and took place in a live policy context, 
giving it good external validity.
Implications of all the available evidence
Antimicrobial stewardship programmes should consider 
incorporating prescribing feedback into their activities. The 
eff
 ects of this feedback might be enhanced by use of social 
norms, behavioural instruction, and a high-profi
 le messenger. 
However, there is still a need for further research to understand 
how the message content, timing, messenger, medium, and 
recipient aff
 ect the outcomes of such feedback.

were assigned to the patient-focused intervention only; 
and those who were assigned to neither intervention.
The initial population consisted of all GP practices in 
England who issued prescriptions for any antibiotics 
(British National Formulary [BNF] 5·1) that were 
dispensed in May, 2014: this was the latest period of data 
available immediately before the study’s launch, since 
HSCIC publishes prescribing data with a 3-month lag. 
Practices that had not been open since at least 
October, 2013, were excluded because they did not have 
the historical data necessary to apply a control for past 
prescribing levels to the main outcome variable. Practices 
were also excluded if their rate of dispensed antibiotic 
items per 1000 population, after applying the 2013 
specifi
 c therapeutic group age-sex related prescribing 
units (STAR-PU) controls for age and sex for BNF subset 
5·1, was classed as an outlier. This exclusion was to 
prevent inappropriate communication with practices 
subject to measurement error or who were systematically 
diff
 erent from the main population. The outlier threshold 
was set at the 95th percentile on advice from public 
health professionals (ie, the very highest prescribers 
were excluded). We then excluded those practices whose 
rate of dispensed antibiotic items was not in the top 20% 
for their National Health Service (NHS) Local Area Team. 
The 20% fi
 gure was selected because we judged that it 
represented the optimum trade-off
  between increasing 
statistical power by widening the sample and diluting the 
power of the social norms message by increasing the size 
of the “minority” group. NHS Research Ethics Committee 
(14/LO/1544) waived participant consent for this trial, 
since obtaining consent would invalidate the results and 
create a burden greater than the intervention itself.
Randomisation and masking
A study investigator (MS) randomly assigned GP practices 
to intervention or control groups, stratifi
 ed by NHS Local 
Area Teams, using the random number allocation 
function in the Stata software package. MS did not 
implement the interventions. Participants in intervention 
groups are likely to have been aware of the interventions 
they were assigned to but unaware that they were involved 
in a trial. Since the prescribing dataset had to be matched 
with the dataset of GP names, it was not practical to blind 
the study team to group assignment.
Procedures
In the feedback intervention, the letter from the Chief 
Medical Offi
  cer was sent to GPs on Sept 29, 2014 
(appendix). The letter stated that the practice was 
prescribing antibiotics at a higher rate than 80% of 
practices in its NHS Local Area Team, and was 
accompanied by a copy of the patient-focused “Treating 
your infection” leafl
 et developed for the TARGET 
programme that enables back-up prescribing (appendix). 
The letter was issued at the end of September to coincide 
with the seasonal increase in antibiotic prescriptions seen 
during the winter months. More specifi
 cally, it was issued 
to arrive on the fi
 rst day of the following month because 
the data are collected on a monthly basis. The control 
group did not receive this letter. However, if the 
intervention had been shown to signifi
 cantly reduce 
prescribing levels, we planned to send the intervention to 
this control group (ie, the practices who had not received 
the feedback intervention at the end of the 6-month 
period). On this basis, letters were issued to these 
remaining practices on March 30, 2015.
The letter used three main concepts from the 
behavioural sciences. The fi
 rst was social norm 
information about how the recipient’s practice’s 
prescribing rate compared with other practices in the 
local area. Social norm comparisons were made within 
NHS Local Area Teams to increase both the 
appropriateness of the intervention message (since 
antibiotic dispensing varies by geographical region),18 
and its salience (since making social norm information 
more specifi
 c to the recipient may increase its 
eff
 ectiveness).19 Second, the letter was addressed from a 
high-profi
 le fi
 gure, with the assumption that this would 
increase the credibility of its content.20 Finally, the letter 
presented three specifi
 c, feasible actions that the 
recipient could do to reduce unnecessary prescriptions of 
antibiotics: giving patients advice on self-care, off
 ering a 
delayed prescription, and talking about the issue with 
other prescribers in his or her practice. The selection and 
presentation of these actions drew on the concept of 
behavioural instruction, which has been linked to 
increased behaviour change and improved compre-
hension and recall.21,22 These recommended actions are 
all supported by professional prescribing guidance.23,24 
The letter was developed by the study investigators with 
input from experts on antimicrobial stewardship: two GP 
academics, a public health practitioner, and offi
  cials 
from Public Health England. The accompanying 
TARGET leafl
 et reinforced the message of the letter 
because it acted as a method to support delayed or 
reduced prescribing.
The feedback intervention, targeted mainly at 
prescribers, was followed by a patient-focused inter-
vention in December, 2014. The rationale for the second 
intervention was that GPs may prescribe antibiotics 
when not clinically indicated because of (real or 
perceived) pressure from patients.25 Therefore, the 
intervention was intended to promote the attitude among 
patients that if antibiotics are taken when they are not 
needed, they are less likely to work when needed. The 
hypothesis was that adopting this attitude would make 
patients less likely to exert pressure on the prescriber to 
give them antibiotics. In turn, this reduced pressure 
would lead to fewer instances of unnecessary prescribing. 
The second intervention consisted of two posters, 
two leafl
 ets, and a letter addressed to the practice 
manager (appendix). The posters and letter were 
developed 
through 
qualitative 
research

Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was the rate of antibiotic 
items dispensed per 1000 population, after applying the 
2013 STAR-PU controls for age and sex for BNF subset 
5·1 and controlling for the previous year’s prescribing 
levels in each practice. For the feedback intervention, the 
period of October, 2014, to March, 2015, inclusive was 
used; for the patient-focused intervention, the period of 
December, 2014, to March, 2015, was used. The secondary 
outcome measures were only calculated when a 
statistically signifi
 cant diff
 erence between intervention 
and control groups was obtained. They were, fi
 rst, the 
estimated total diff
 erence in the number of antibiotic 
items dispensed between intervention and control 
groups for the study period; second, the estimated eff
 ect 
on direct prescription costs.
Statistical analysis
In June, 2014, we used the most recent data available to 
estimate that our sample would consist of 1490 GP 
practices. We powered the study to detect a change in 
the dispensed antibiotic prescribing rate of 0·48% 
(d=0·0568) with 80% power, once controls for patient 
demographics, local area prescribing rates, and 
previous prescribing trends had been applied. We 
selected a fairly small minimum detectable eff
 ect size 
because of the small eff
 ects obtained for similar audit 
and feedback interventions.9–12,27 Additionally, the low 
cost of the letter meant that even a small eff
 ect size 
could be cost eff
 ective.
Our primary analysis used a fi
 xed eff
 ects panel 
regression model, with a diff
 erence-in-diff
 erences 
component that used the practice’s prescribing level 
12 months before each of the months in the study period. 
These controls were applied to reduce the unexplained 
variance 
in 
the 
data 
caused 
by 
unobserved, 
time-inconsistent properties of each GP practice. The 
model was applied to the primary outcome data for each 
of the months in the study period, as well as to the pooled 
data for the entire period. To estimate changes in the 
intervention’s eff
 ectiveness over time, we used a fi
 xed 
eff
 ects regression with controls for month and month 
interacted with treatment. Finally, we interacted the two 
interventions in the 2 × 2 design to identify whether 
combining them had a statistically signifi
 cant additive 
eff
 ect on the outcome measure.
Our secondary analysis was done solely on the pooled 
primary outcome data for the study period, and 
consisted of three elements. The fi
 rst was a post-hoc 
cost-eff
 ectiveness analysis (not featured in our protocol 
because we were unaware that the necessary data were 
available). When there was a signifi
 cant eff
 ect, we 
estimated the total diff
 erence in the number of 
dispensed antibiotic items between intervention and 
control groups. This calculation was done by using the 
regression outputs to predict the number of items that 
would have been dispensed in the intervention group if 
they been in the control group, and comparing this 
fi
 gure to the actual number dispensed in the 
intervention group. When there was a signifi
 cant eff
 ect, 
we estimated the eff
 ect on direct prescribing costs for 
the public sector. To do this, we incorporated the Actual 
Cost fi
 eld in the prescribing dataset into the aggregated 
regression model to create a crude cost estimate. 
We then assumed that 10·1% of these items incurred an 
£8·20 prescription charge (in line with the overall 
exemption rate for 2014), which we deducted from this 
cost estimate.28 Finally, we incorporated the £0·90 per 
item professional fee payable to pharmacy contractors 
by NHS England, to produce an overall savings fi
 gure.29 
We compared this fi
 gure to the basic cost of the 
intervention materials. The second element of the 
secondary analysis was an analysis of interactions 
between the main treatment eff
 ect and patient 
demographics, and the number of patients registered to 
a practice. Sex is included in the interactions, despite 
also featuring in STAR-PU, because the STAR-PU 
controls for sex are present as a series of absolute values 
interacted with age, not linearly. Finally, a subgroup 
analysis was done to determine the eff
 ect on antibiotics 
usually prescribed for upper respiratory tract infections 
(penicillins and macrolides), since these are a common 
source of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions.30
As with any 2 × 2 design, two sets of results are relevant. 
The fi
 rst shows the aggregate eff
 ect of the two main 
interventions by, for example, comparing all the practices 
that received the feedback intervention with all the 
practices that did not. The second shows the eff
 ect of 
each of the four experimental groups, so that eff
 ect of 
combining interventions (or not) can be discerned. 
To maximise clarity, we present these two sets of results 
separately.
The analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis 
and attrition was handled by using the prescribing rate 
for the equivalent month in the previous year for 
practices that closed during the study period. All analyses 
were done with Stata IC (version 13). Because all data 
used in the trial were publicly available, no data 
monitoring committee was appointed to oversee the 
study. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 
number ISRCTN32349954, and has been completed.

Role of the funding source
As part of its standard responsibilities, the funder of the 
study had a role in the study design, data interpretation, 
and writing of the report. The corresponding author had 
full access to all the data in the study and had fi
 nal 
responsibility for the decision to submit to publication.
Results
Participants for the feedback intervention were recruited 
and assigned to treatment or control groups between 
Sept 8 and Sept 26, 2014. 7993 GP practices were assessed 
for eligibility because they had issued prescriptions for 
any antibiotics in May, 2014. Of these, 6412 practices did 
not meet the inclusion criteria (fi
 gure 1), which resulted 
in a fi
 nal sample of 1581. These practices were randomly 
assigned to control (n=790) and feedback intervention 
(n=791) groups (table 1). After a manual check, two 
practices were excluded from the feedback intervention 
group because they specialised in treating the homeless. 
Matching GP records to practice records resulted in 
3227 letters being issued.
By March, 2015, data ceased to be available because of 
closure or merger for six practices in the control group 
and four practices in the feedback intervention group. 
Of these ten practices, one practice in each of the 
intervention and control groups ceased to prescribe in 
February, 2015, but did not have prescribing data available 
for February, 2014 (although they did for March, 2014). 
This lack of availability meant that attrition could not be 
dealt with by use of the previous year’s prescribing 
rate. Therefore, these practices were excluded from the 
analysis for February, 2015, but included for every other 
month. Public Health England performed random 
checks of the photographic evidence provided by the 
company contracted to deliver the materials for the 
patient-focused intervention; no evidence of non-delivery 
was recorded. We did not collect data for harms or 
adverse incidents.
Between October, 2014, and March, 2015, the rate of 
antibiotic items dispensed per 1000 population was 
131·25 (95% CI 130·33–132·16) in the control group 
and 126·98 (125·68–128·27) in the feedback intervention 
group, an absolute diff
 erence of 4·27 (3·3% relative 
diff
 erence). The incidence rate ratio (IRR) for the

The rate at which antibiotics were dispensed in the 
feedback intervention group was signifi
 cantly lower 
than in the control group for every month in the study 
period (table 2; fi
 gure 2). There is no evidence of a trend 
in the eff
 ect size. The diff
 erence between the two groups 
ceased to be signifi
 cant in April, 2015 (IRR 0·989, 
95% CI 0·970–1·009; p=0·281). During this month, the 
letter was sent to practices that had not already received 
it; thus, one would expect the diff
 erence to be eliminated 
at this point.
An estimated 73 406 fewer antibiotic items were 
dispensed during the study period as a result of the 
feedback intervention. This estimate is based on 
2 178 345 items dispensed by the intervention group and 
our regression model prediction that this group would 
have dispensed 2 251 751 antibiotic items in absence of 
the intervention. The cost of printing and mailing to 
3227 GPs in 791 practices was £4335, which equates to 
£0·06 per prescription prevented during the study 
period (excluding the time costs of implementing the 
intervention). We estimate that this intervention created 
a £92 356 saving in direct prescribing costs for the public 
sector. There were no signifi
 cant interactions between 
the feedback intervention and practice-level patient age 
or sex profi
 les. However, the eff
 ect size was smaller for 
practices with more registered patients: for each 
1000 increase in practice list size, the eff
 ect of the letter 
was reduced by 0·47 prescribing rate units (95% CI 
0·16–0·77; p=0·0022). The marginal treatment eff
 ect was 
highly signifi
 cant for penicillins and macrolides (–3·916 
[95% CI –5·202 to –2·636]; p<0·0001), but was not 
signifi
 cant for the other antibiotics (–0·308 [–0·773 to 
0·156]; p=0·194).
For the patient-focused intervention, the sample of 
1581 practices was re-randomised into control (n=804) 
and intervention (n=777) groups (table 3). Between 
December, 2014, and March, 2015, the rate of antibiotic 
items dispensed per 1000 population was 133·98 
(95% CI 133·06–134·90) in the control group and 
135·00 (95% CI 133·77–136·22) in the group assigned 
to the patient-focused intervention (IRR for diff
 erence 
between groups 1·01, 95% CI 1·00–1·02; p=0·105; 
table 4). The rate at which antibiotics were dispensed 
was signifi
 cantly lower in the control group than in the 
group assigned to the patient-focused intervention for 
one month in the study period (December, 2014). 
We did not proceed to the secondary analysis for the 
patient-focused intervention because we did not 
disprove the null hypothesis for the primary outcome 
measure.
In an analysis of all four experimental groups (neither 
intervention, n=402; feedback intervention only, n=402; 
patient-focused intervention only, n=388; and both 
interventions, n=389; fi
 gure 1; table 5), the antibiotic 
prescribing rate was signifi
 cantly lower in the group 
assigned to the feedback intervention only compared 
with the group that received neither intervention, for all 
months in the study period until March, 2015 (IRR 
0·967, 95% CI 0·949–0·982; p<0·0001; table 6, fi
 gure 3). 
The patient-focused intervention produced a signifi
 cant 
increase in the prescribing rate in the month it was 
delivered, but its eff
 ect was not signifi
 cant for the 
relevant period as a whole (patient-focused intervention 
only vs neither intervention IRR 1·013, 0·998–1·028; 
p=0·073). The prescribing rate was also signifi
 cantly 
lower in the group assigned to both interventions

Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the fi
 rst national-scale 
randomised trial of giving feedback on antibiotic 
prescribing. Our results show that providing a low-cost 
mail-based intervention incorporating social norm 
feedback on high antibiotic use can consistently reduce 
such use over a 6-month period. Importantly, the eff
 ect of 
the feedback intervention disappeared after letters were 
sent to all practices in the sample at the end of March, 2015. 
The eff
 ect we recorded compares favourably to results 
from 
previous 
studies 
of 
antibiotic 
prescribing 
feedback.9–12,27 To relate the 3·3% relative reduction to policy 
goals: the UK 5-Year Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy 
gave an initial target of reducing primary care prescribing 
by 4%.1 In the NHS, the Quality Premium currently 
rewards a 1% reduction in antibiotic items prescribed. We 
calculate that our feedback intervention would equate to a 
0·85% reduction in antibiotic items nationally during the 
study period (if the control group was also treated). By 
contrast, we did not note any signifi
 cant eff
 ect of the 
patient-focused campaign materials. Indeed, in one month 
the intervention seemed to increase the rate at which 
antibiotic items were dispensed. This fi
 nding strengthens 
the case for careful assessment of patient-focused 
information-based interventions, including their eff
 ect on 
prescribing outcomes.

main 
advantages compared with the main alternatives for 
improving antibiotic stewardship, which are often more 
complex face-to-face interventions. First, a letter-based 
intervention is likely to be cheaper than a face-to-face one, 
although previous reviews have noted that cost reporting 
is usually absent.10 The material costs of the feedback 
intervention were roughly £0·06 per antibiotic item not 
dispensed during the study period. The second advantage

of the feedback intervention is scalability, which has been 
highlighted by previous reviews: it is unclear whether the 
successes of face-to-face interventions can be achieved on 
a larger scale, since they may depend on particular local 
conditions and modes of delivery.10,12 The third advantage 
relates to the low barriers to performing the feedback 
intervention. Since the underlying data are all publicly 
available, feedback of this kind could be provided by 
many diff
 erent interested parties. This situation opens up 
the possibility that pressure for quality improvement can 
be exerted in a more dynamic way, by use of distributed 
networks rather than hierarchical structures. These 
datasets can also be combined with fi
 ndings from the 
behavioural sciences to increase their eff
 ect.
This study has several limitations. The eff
 ects on health 
outcomes, and thus harms and benefi
 ts, were not 
measured. More specifi
 cally, we cannot measure whether 
the reductions in antibiotic prescribing occurred only for 
infections for which antibiotics are ineff
 ective (although 
the subgroup analyses suggest that this is the case).30 
However, previous reviews have reported no negative 
eff
 ects of antibiotic stewardship interventions on 
treatment eff
 ectiveness or patient satisfaction.10–12 The 
sample consisted of the highest prescribers only, so it is 
not clear how the results would generalise to the rest of 
the population. Prescribing data were available at the 
practice level only (rather than practitioner level) and 
were restricted to prescriptions that were dispensed and 
submitted to the NHS Business Services Authority in 
order to claim payment—although we believe this to be 
the vast majority of prescriptions, in view of this fi
 nancial 
incentive to submit. There is also a risk of contamination 
between experimental groups, since GPs from diff
 erent 
practices regularly communicate with each other. It was 
not possible to measure the rate of delayed prescribing, 
even though this was one of the actions recommended to 
practitioners. Because this was a one-off
  intervention, 
we cannot assess the eff
 ects of repeated messages at 
this stage. Measuring participant exposure was not 
straightforward: the study team could not be certain that 
all GPs received and opened the letters. Our estimate of 
the savings to the public sector concerns prescribing 
costs only, and neglects the wider costs that might result 
from not prescribing antibiotics (eg, multiple visits to 
the NHS to obtain antibiotics). Finally, having a single 
intervention group means that it is not possible to 
disentangle the eff
 ects of the diff
 erent intervention 
elements—ie, social norm feedback, a high-profi
 le 
messenger, and behavioural instruction.
The main future research direction suggested by this 
study is to examine how the eff
 ectiveness of antibiotic 
prescribing feedback can be maximised. Attention should 
focus on how the outcome varies according to message 
content, message timing, messenger, medium, and 
recipient. For example, it is not clear whether emailed 
feedback would produce a similar eff
 ect, or whether a 
similar message would be eff
 ective for those not in the 
highest 20% of prescribers. The long-term eff
 ects should 
also be considered: do eff
 ects continue beyond 6 months, 
and does repeated exposure to the same message or 
messenger lead to decay in the eff
 ect size? Studies could 
use a wider range of outcome measures, such as 
indicators of patient health and antimicrobial resistance. 
Since the quality of existing evidence on this topic has 
been rated as low, there is value in testing these questions 
through randomised fi
 eld experiments.10
Our results suggest that antimicrobial stewardship 
programmes should consider incorporating primary care 
prescribing feedback into their activities, if they do not 
already do so. The eff
 ects of this feedback might be 
enhanced by use of social norms, behavioural instruction, 
and a credible messenger. Feedback should form part of 
an overall strategy that also includes more in-depth, 
complex interventions, because the eff
 ect size reported 
here will not be suffi
  cient to address the policy issue 
fully. Such feedback could also be expanded to other 
sectors that use antimicrobial drugs, such as secondary 
care and veterinary care. Finally, there may be value in 
introducing feedback where there is substantial variation 
in other types of prescribing (such as antipsychotic drugs 
or statins) or other forms of clinical practice (such as 
diagnostic tests or surgery).
