Abstract
Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are implicated in autoimmunity but how they are generated 
and their roles in sterile inflammation remain unclear. Ribonucleoprotein immune complexes, 
inducers of NETosis, require mitochondrial ROS for maximal NET stimulation. During this 
process, mitochondria become hypopolarized and translocate to the cell surface. Extracellular 
release of oxidized mitochondrial DNA is proinflammatory in vitro and, when injected into mice, 
stimulates type-I interferon (IFN) signaling through a pathway dependent on the DNA sensor, 
STING. Mitochondrial ROS is also necessary for spontaneous NETosis of low-density 
granulocytes from individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This was also observed 
in individuals with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), which lack NADPH-oxidase activity, 
but still develop autoimmunity and type I-IFN signatures. Mitochondrial ROS inhibition in vivo 
reduces disease severity and type-I IFN responses in a mouse model of lupus. These findings 
highlight a role for mitochondria in the generation not only of NETs but also of pro-inflammatory 
oxidized mitochondrial DNA in autoimmune diseases.

 Introduction
Neutrophils contribute to inflammation by interacting with innate and adaptive immune 
cells1 and by releasing proteolytic enzymes and reactive intermediates2. Neutrophil 
extracellular trap (NET) formation, a cell death pathway characterized by extrusion of 
chromatin bound to cytosolic and granular content3, has been implicated in autoimmune 
disorders. Previous in vitro studies of type-I IFN-primed neutrophils from individuals with 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) showed that ribonucleoprotein-containing immune 
complexes (RNP ICs), prevalent in lupus, can induce NETosis4. Also, low-density 
granulocytes (LDGs), a distinct pro-inflammatory neutrophil subset found in individuals 
with SLE, exhibit enhanced spontaneous NETosis when examined ex vivo5. NETs opsonized 
by autoantibodies can stimulate plasmacytoid dendritic cells to synthesize IFN-α. NETs also 
promote vasculopathy and inflammasome activation4–13. Furthermore, the presence of 
modified autoantigens in NETs may contribute to breaking immune tolerance in predisposed 
hosts14.
NETs are induced by many pathogens and, also, by sterile stimuli including cytokines, ICs, 
autoantibodies15 and, in vitro, by PMA or calcium ionophores16. While the molecular 
pathways leading to NETosis remain incompletely characterized, both histone 
citrullination17 and ROS production appear necessary. Superoxide synthesis leading to 
NETosis has been considered to originate mainly from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase-dependent pathways3. Diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), an 
inhibitor of NADPH-oxidase, nitric oxide-synthase (NOS), and cytochrome P450-reductase, 
decreases NETosis10, 13. While these observations suggested that NADPH-oxidase pathways 
are required for NETosis, most studies have used DPI concentrations that also inhibit other 
ROS generators responsible for pro-inflammatory oxidant synthesis18. It is therefore unclear 
whether ROS generated by NADPH-oxidase-independent pathways impacts NETosis and its 
inflammatory properties in disease states. Since mitochondria are a potent source of ROS 
and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has recently been implicated in inflammatory 
responses19–21, we examined the role of mitochondria in NETosis and immune stimulatory 
effects in SLE.
Results
RNP IC-mediated NETosis is dependent on mitochondrial ROS
To explore the relative contribution of NADPH-oxidase and the mitochondrial electron chain 
in ROS generation and NETosis, we stimulated normal neutrophils with PMA or RNP IC 
(described in Supplementary Fig. 1) in the presence of ROS inhibitors. DPI almost 
completely inhibited PMA- and RNP IC-induced NETosis (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 
2). Using MitoSOX Red, a triphenylphosphonium-linked dihydroethidium compound that 
concentrates within mitochondria and fluoresces red when oxidized by ROS, we observed 
mitochondrial ROS generation following neutrophil activation by RNP ICs and, to a lesser 
extent, by PMA, but not by the TLR agonist R848 (Fig. 1b). Supporting this result, 
thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA, a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration) reduced IC-
induced, but not PMA-induced, NETosis (Fig. 1a). To determine whether NADPH-oxidase 
was necessary for RNP IC-mediated NETosis, two specific inhibitors, apocynin and

 VAS287022, were used and shown to inhibit RNP IC- and PMA-induced NET formation. 
These results suggest sequential activation where, in normal-density granulocytes (NDGs), 
NADPH-oxidase is required as a priming factor for mitochondrial ROS, similar to what has 
been described for angiotensin II23. As in control neutrophils, NDGs from individuals with 
SLE induced NETs in a mitochondrial ROS-dependent manner when activated with RNP 
ICs (Fig. 1c). Thus, RNP IC-induced ROS production in healthy and lupus neutrophils is, at 
least in part, generated by mitochondrial respiration and attenuation of this reduces NETosis.
RNP ICs induce oxidized mtDNA release
Upon mitochondrial damage by ROS, mitochondria lose membrane potential and undergo 
either mitophagy or extrusion to protect cells against excessive ROS production24–26. 
Considering the prominent induction of mitochondrial ROS by RNP ICs, we examined RNP 
ICs’ effect on mitochondria. Most control NDGs had high mitochondrial membrane 
potential (Fig. 1d), which decreased after RNP IC stimulation (Fig. 1e). Hypopolarized 
mitochondria lined the plasma membrane, in contrast to the evenly distributed 
hyperpolarized mitochondria (Fig. 1d–e). RNP ICs increased the frequency of neutrophils 
with reduced mitochondrial potential (Fig. 1f). Since protein kinase-C (PKC)-mediated 
mitochondrial ROS may participate in the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential24, 25, 
we added MitoTEMPO (a mitochondrial-specific superoxide scavenger) or the PKC-
inhibitor chelerythrine-chloride to RNP IC-activated neutrophils and observed that they both 
reduced RNP IC-mediated mitochondrial hypopolarization (Fig. 1f).
Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy revealed that RNP IC, but not R848, induced 
mitochondrial mobilization to the neutrophil cell surface (Fig. 2a–b). Detection of the 
mitochondrial outer membrane protein TOM20 on the cell surface of non-permeabilized 
propidium iodide− cells was pronase sensitive, indicating that the TOM20 antibodies 
recognized a cell surface accessible protein (Supplementary Fig. 3a). To exclude the 
possibility of binding of extruded mitochondria-containing NETs to the neutrophil cell 
surface, which would increase TOM20 membrane staining, we treated neutrophils with 
DNase. TOM20 cell surface levels were DNase insensitive, suggesting that they are unlikely 
to be the consequence of cell surface deposited NETs (Supplementary Fig. 3a).
To examine potentially adverse effects of mitochondrial ROS generation, we examined 
whether RNP IC-induced DNA oxidation using anti-8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) 
antibodies. Following RNP IC activation, there was strong 8-OHdG staining both on the 
neutrophil cell surface and on the extruded NETs (Fig. 2b–d). Since antibodies against 
TOM20 co-localized with 8-OHdG, these findings suggest that most oxidation occurred on 
mitochondrial rather than chromosomal DNA. As mitochondria induced ROS following 
RNP IC exposure (Fig. 1b), we asked whether mitochondrial-generated ROS were necessary 
for DNA oxidation. Indeed, both DPI and TTFA reduced DNA 8-OHdG content (Fig. 2e). 
To conclusively determine if the released oxidized DNA was of mitochondrial origin, we 
immunoprecipitated total oxidized DNA using anti-8-OHdG and quantified the relative 
abundance of mitochondrial (16S) and chromosomal (18S) DNA by qPCR. An increased 
ratio of 16S:18S DNA was detected in the total oxidized DNA, suggesting it is enriched for 
mtDNA (Fig. 2f). Oxidized DNA was still enriched in mtDNA, even when we incubated

 NETs with proteinase K to remove histones and when chromosomal DNA was sheared to 
generate small fragments (data not shown). While RNP ICs and PMA primarily released 
chromosomal DNA during NETosis, only activation by RNP ICs increased mtDNA release 
(Fig. 2g). Inhibition of mitochondrial ROS reduced the relative amount of mtDNA as 
compared to chromosomal DNA in released NETs (Fig. 2h). In support of mtDNA 
extrusion, intracellular mtDNA levels were decreased concomitant with increased NET-
derived mtDNA (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Therefore, upon RNP IC activation, mitochondria 
are mobilized to the cell surface where they release oxidized mtDNA in a mitochondrial 
ROS-dependent manner.
NET-bound oxidized mtDNA is pro-inflammatory
Oxidized genomic DNA, induced by ultraviolet irradiation or H2O2, is more resistant to 
degradation by the exonuclease TREX1, leading to cGAS-STING-dependent type-I IFN and 
IL-6 induction27. MtDNA is also pro-inflammatory, exerting its effects via TLR9, 
inflammasome activation20, 21 and by engaging the cGAS-STING (TMEM-173) pathway 
through a Bak/Bax-dependent process19. To examine the inflammatory potential of oxidized 
mtDNA, NET-derived 8-OHdG− and 8-OHdG+ DNA was added to human peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and incubated overnight. Similar to a recent report27, but using 
a pathophysiologically relevant stimulus, we observed that 8-OHdG+ DNA was a more 
potent inducer of IFNB1 and other pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA (Fig. 3a). We 
observed similar results following transfection of the monocytic cell line THP1 with 8-
OHdG+ DNA at the mRNA (Fig. 3b) and protein level (data not shown). To investigate if the 
increased inflammatory properties of oxidized mtDNA were secondary to oxidation or to 
DNA intrinsic properties, we isolated genomic and mitochondrial DNA from several 
different species (human, herring, mouse) and cell types, and oxidized the DNA in vitro 
through UV-irradiation27. 8-OHdG content was increased in all DNA samples upon UV 
irradiation and associated with the induction of the IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) CXCL10, 
independent of species or cellular origin (mitochondrial or genomic DNA) (Supplementary 
Fig. 4a–e). Thus, our data suggest the extent of DNA oxidation, and not intrinsic differences 
between mitochondrial and genomic DNA, is a key factor promoting the interferogenic 
capacity of DNA, consistent with prior reports27–29. Although oxidized mtDNA acted as a 
potent inflammatory stimulus in PBMCs and THP1 cells, it did not induce neutrophil 
activation (either alone or in complex with the anti-8-OHdG) despite being internalized 
(Supplementary Fig. 5).
To determine the in vivo biological relevance of this and the DNA sensor pathway 
responsible for the recognition of oxidized mtDNA externalized in NETs, we examined ISG 
induction in WT, Tmem173−/− and Myd88−/− mice following systemic injection of 8-
OHdG+ mtDNA-DOTAP complexes. Expression of numerous ISGs was increased in WT 
mice following exposure to 8OHdG+ mtDNA, which was impaired in Tmem173−/− mice, 
and unaffected by MyD88 deficiency. In contrast, CpG DNA, a single-stranded TLR9 
activating DNA oligomer, did not rely on STING for type-I IFN induction (Fig. 3c), but was 
impaired in the Myd88−/− mice, consistent with the specificity of the cGAS-STING pathway 
to recognize double-stranded, but not single-stranded DNA30. Thus, the released oxidized

 mtDNA was highly pro-inflammatory and supported ISG induction through the STING 
pathway.
Mitochondrial ROS drive pro-inflammatory NETosis in SLE LDGs
Mitochondrial superoxide production was increased in LDGs from individuals with SLE as 
compared to healthy control NDGs or autologous lupus NDGs, as determined by MitoSOX 
staining. MitoSOX co-localized with the mitochondrial complex V subunit D, indicating that 
enhanced superoxide production by SLE LDGs is of mitochondrial origin (Fig. 4a–c). 
Mitochondrial superoxide production was also necessary for spontaneous LDG NETosis, as 
it was decreased by MitoTEMPO (Fig. 4d–f).
DNA spontaneously released by lupus LDG NETs was highly enriched for mtDNA and for 
8-OHdG-modified DNA as compared to NETs induced by other stimuli in healthy control 
neutrophils (Fig. 4g–h). These SLE LDG-derived NETs were more inflammatory in that 
they potently stimulated ISGs in THP1 cells (Fig. 4i). Overall, SLE LDGs spontaneously 
release NETs enriched in oxidized mtDNA in a mitochondria-derived superoxide-dependent 
manner, leading to enhanced pro-inflammatory and interferogenic potential.
Since lupus LDGs produced increased mitochondrial-derived superoxide and spontaneous 
NET release ex vivo, we examined serologic evidence of ongoing NETosis in vivo. SLE 
individuals had increased amounts of myeloperoxidase (MPO):DNA, human neutrophil 
elastase (HNE):DNA and citrullinated histone:MPO complexes in plasma compared to 
controls, suggesting in vivo NETosis. Furthermore, peroxidase activity in lupus serum 
correlated with disease activity, as measured by SLEDAI-2K (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Mitochondrial ROS drive pro-inflammatory NETosis in CGD LDGs
Individuals with CGD have mutations in subunits of the NADPH-oxidase complex, resulting 
in defects in superoxide production, and have an increased predisposition to autoimmune 
diseases including SLE. While CGD NDGs can exhibit a relative resistance to NETosis31, 
the potential contribution of LDGs and mitochondrial-derived ROS to immunogenic NET 
formation in this disease has not been addressed.
As in SLE, LDGs were increased in subjects with CGD as compared to controls 
(Supplementary Table I). CGD LDGs showed both enhanced spontaneous NETosis (Fig. 5a–
b) and mitochondrial superoxide synthesis (Fig. 5d), comparable to SLE LDGs. 
Spontaneous NETosis by CGD LDGs was inhibited by MitoTEMPO, demonstrating that 
these cells relied on mitochondrial ROS to form NETs (Fig. 5a–c). In contrast, inhibiting 
other ROS sources such as MPO with 3-amino,12,4-triazole or NO with L-NG-
Monomethyl-L-arginine, did not abrogate NETosis in CGD LDGs (data not shown). NETs 
from subjects with CGD had an increased ratio of mtDNA:chromosomal DNA as compared 
to healthy controls (Fig. 5e). Higher amounts of MPO:DNA and HNE:DNA complexes were 
detectable in CGD plasma as compared to control plasma (Fig. 5f–g), suggesting enhanced 
in vivo NETosis. Levels of HNE:DNA complexes in CGD plasma correlated with 
antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), although these values did not reach statistical significance 
(Supplementary Table I; R = 0.47, P = 0.06). Overall, these findings suggest that

 mitochondrial ROS synthesis is sufficient to generate NETs in the absence of NADPH-
oxidase activity and may promote NETs enriched in mtDNA in CGD.
Recent evidence indicates that CGD individuals develop a type-I IFN signature32. As we 
observed that oxidized mtDNA upregulates type-I IFNs, we evaluated serum type-I IFN 
activity in the CGD cohort displaying enhanced LDG NETosis, and assessed correlations 
between ISGs and features of autoimmunity. Compared to controls, 72.7% of CGD 
individuals had increased serum type-I IFN activity (defined in Supplementary Fig. 7). An 
association between ISGs and systemic autoimmunity and/or positive autoantibodies (ANAs, 
anti-extractable nuclear antigens and/or anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) was also 
detectable (P = 0.02, by Fisher’s exact test). Indeed, 92.3% of CGD subjects with clinical 
autoimmunity and/or positive autoantibodies had high type-I serum activity. Thus, increased 
LDG mitochondrial ROS production and ex vivo and in vivo NETosis are associated with 
enhanced type-I IFN activity in CGD.
Mitochondrial ROS scavengers suppress lupus-like disease in vivo
To confirm whether mitochondrial ROS promotes lupus-like disease, MitoTEMPO was 
continuously administered prophylactically for 7 weeks via subcutaneous pump, starting at 
10 weeks of age, to MRL/lpr lupus-prone mice. MitoTEMPO-treated mice had decreased 
spontaneous NETosis by bone marrow neutrophils (Fig. 6a), less proteinuria and renal 
immune complex deposition (Fig. 6b–c), and decreased serum anti-dsDNA (Fig. 6c–f). 
Treatment also reduced splenocyte ISG induction and inflammatory cytokine mRNA 
production, but not inflammasome-related genes, when compared to vehicle-treated 
MRL/lpr mice (Fig. 6g). That the inflammasome pathway was not affected by MitoTEMPO 
treatment was confirmed by quantifying caspase-1 and IL-18 activation in kidney protein 
extracts (Fig. 6h). Thus, prophylactic inhibition of mitochondrial ROS suppresses NETosis, 
type I IFN responses and lupus-like autoimmune disease in mice.
Discussion
Previous studies indicate that lupus lymphocytes display elevated mitochondrial ROS 
synthesis33. By studying ROS generation during NETosis, we identified two novel roles for 
the mitochondria in SLE: 1) the capability of mitochondrial ROS to drive NETosis following 
RNP IC stimulation in vitro and in the pro-inflammatory LDG subset in lupus and CGD 
subjects ex vivo and 2) the release of oxidized mtDNA with potent pro-inflammatory and 
interferogenic properties. Detection of circulating complexes likely derived from NETs in 
SLE and CGD individuals, as well as reduction of lupus severity in a murine model 
following systemic inhibition of mitochondrial ROS, strongly support the in vivo relevance 
of our findings.
Recent evidence implicates aberrant NETosis and/or impaired NET clearance in the 
pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders including SLE4, 9, 10. These observations have been 
supported by mouse studies, where pharmacologic inhibition of NETosis ameliorates lupus, 
atherosclerosis and thrombosis11, 12. In apparent contrast to these observations, lupus prone 
MRL/lpr mice that are deficient in NOX2 and therefore lack functional NADPH-oxidase, 
develop worsening phenotype34. Similarly, CGD individuals also have a propensity to

 develop autoimmune conditions including SLE. Since ROS generation is necessary for 
NETosis in most contexts and NET formation is reduced in CGD subjects3, 31, 35, this led to 
the suggestion that NETosis may not contribute to SLE pathogenesis34. However, NADPH-
oxidase has pleiotropic immunologic functions36 and is not the sole source of neutrophil 
ROS. Indeed, mitochondria are one of the major sites of ROS generation and enhanced 
mitochondrial ROS has been associated with chronic inflammatory conditions37. Our 
findings indicate that mitochondrial ROS production can be sufficient to generate NETs even 
in the absence of functional NADPH-oxidase.
While homeostatic mechanisms protect the genome from ROS-induced damage, NETosis is 
characterized by nuclear membrane disintegration allowing for chromatin decondensation 
and exposure of genomic DNA to ROS. MtDNA is particularly vulnerable to oxidant 
damage, as it lies close to ROS production sites and lacks protection by histones38,39. 
NETosis may therefore be a crucial event allowing for oxidation of genomic and 
mitochondrial nucleic acids. Importantly, oxidized mtDNA externalized by RNP IC 
stimulation or from spontaneously formed LDG NETs, induced a striking increase in 
inflammatory cytokine production in target cells in a STING-dependent manner.
Lupus LDGs are a distinct pro-inflammatory neutrophil subset characterized by increased 
NET formation5. In contrast to NDGs, mitochondrial ROS appear to be key drivers of LDG 
NETosis, as treatment with specific mitochondrial ROS scavengers led to a marked 
attenuation of this process. In addition, LDGs displayed significant increases in 
mitochondrial ROS production when compared to NDGs. The reason for this enhancement 
is unclear but cytokines, autoantibodies and/or ICs present in SLE may alter the bone 
marrow niche and/or promote the release of immature granulocytes endowed with enhanced 
mitochondrial mass. Conversely, LDGs may represent a subpopulation of mature activated 
neutrophils5, 8 capable of enhanced mitochondrial ROS synthesis. Whether the recent 
associations between lupus susceptibility and mitochondrial gene or NADPH subunit gene 
mutations or genetic variants promote enhanced mitochondrial ROS synthesis and release of 
mtDNA by lupus neutrophils remains to be determined40,41.
CGD offers an opportunity to study the consequences of reduced NADPH-oxidase activity 
on neutrophil functions dependent on oxidants, such as NETosis. Our observations of 
enhanced NETosis in CGD differ from previous reports that CGD neutrophils were resistant 
to NETosis. Those studies assessed NDG responses to specific stimuli and did not evaluate 
LDGs42. Enhanced mitochondrial ROS production by CGD LDGs may be a compensatory 
mechanism related to lack of NADPH-oxidase activity. Indeed, in response to exogenous 
signals, p47-deficient-macrophages increase mitochondrial ROS production that is linked to 
cell death and inflammation43. Potential mechanisms include recruitment of mitochondria to 
phagosomes and interactions with TRAF6, as well as autophagy inhibition with retention of 
dysfunctional mitochondria43, 44. As such, the absence of functional NADPH-oxidase may 
force cells to use mitochondria as alternative ROS sources and promote dysfunctional 
NETosis and cell survival disruptions.
The mechanisms driving increased inflammation and predisposition to autoimmunity in 
CGD involve activation of both innate and adaptive immunity. Our data suggests that a key

 component of innate immune activation leading to autoimmunity observed in CGD, as in 
SLE, is mitochondrial ROS-dependent NETosis of LDGs, promoting externalization of pro-
inflammatory oxidized mtDNA and subsequent activation of STING and/or TLR-dependent 
type-I IFN synthesis. The enhanced levels of circulating neutrophil granular proteins, pro-
inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs reported in CGD32, 45, 46 is very similar to what we 
observed was induced in target cells exposed to mitochondrial-enriched NET DNA. Other 
mechanisms previously implicated in chronic inflammation observed in CGD47–49,6, 50 
could synergize with neutrophil dysregulation to promote amplification of inflammatory 
responses. NETs may also play important roles in limiting inflammation51 and, as with 
many other cellular processes, their pro- or anti-inflammatory role may be context-
dependent and require further investigation.
The implication of enhanced NETosis driven by mitochondrial ROS was supported by in 
vivo experiments in lupus-prone mice, showing significant abrogation of autoimmunity 
features and clinical phenotype when exposed to a mitochondrial ROS scavenger. This is of 
relevance as various mitochondrial ROS inhibitors are currently being tested in clinical 
settings in other diseases and could potentially be studied in the context of systemic 
autoimmunity as potential therapeutic targets52, 53. Mitochondria therefore appear to play an 
important, previously unappreciated role in immune-mediated NETosis and we suggest that 
mitochondrial ROS and release of oxidized mtDNA may be instrumental in initiating or 
perpetuating autoimmunity and the type-I IFN signature observed in SLE and CGD 
individuals.
Online methods
Human samples, inclusion and exclusion criteria and study approval
Blood from individuals with a diagnosis of CGD or SLE, or healthy controls was obtained at 
the Clinical Center, NIH and the Rheumatology Clinic, University of Washington Medical 
Center. All individuals signed informed consent in respective IRB-approved protocols 
(University of Washington; HSD number 39712; NIH 94-AR-0066 and 05-I-0213). SLE 
individuals fulfilled ACR revised diagnostic criteria and over 90% were females54. CGD 
individuals had diagnosis confirmation by cytochrome-c reduction assay (for residual 
superoxide activity)55, protein expression by Western blot, and genetic sequencing. Samples 
were available from time point of clinical visit with corresponding information on SLE 
disease activity, assessed by SLEDAI-2K. Demographic and clinical characteristics of CGD 
individuals are shown in Supplementary Table I. As pre-established criteria, any CGD 
individual receiving interferon-γ was excluded. CGD and SLE individuals with recent or 
active infections were also excluded.
Isolation of neutrophils and NETs
To isolate neutrophils, heparinized blood was layered on Polymorphprep™ (Axis-Shield, 
Dundee, UK) density gradient following manufacturer’s instructions, or on Ficoll as 
described previously8, 10. Red blood cells were lysed with hypertonic solution, and 
neutrophils were resuspended in neutrophil medium (RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, 
Waltham, MA) supplemented with 0.01 M HEPES (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD), MEM non-

 essential amino acids(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MD) and 2% autologous serum. LDGs 
were purified from PBMC fractions using negative selection method as previously 
described8. LDG purity was confirmed by flow cytometry staining for CD14-FITC, CD15-
PE, and CD10-APC (catalog numbers 325610, 301906, and 312210, respectively, 
Biolegend, San Diego, CA).
Normal-density neutrophils (NDGs) (1×106 cells/mL) were incubated in poly-L-lysine 
coated tissue culture plates with or without presence of indicated inhibitors (all from Sigma, 
St. Louis, MO): DPI (25 µM,), MitoTEMPO (10 µM), rotenone (10 µM), 
thenoyltrifluoroacetone (1 µM), VAS2870 (5 µM) or apocynin (100 µM) for 1 hour and 
activated with RNP ICs (IgG, purified from three individuals with SLE selected for the 
presence of a high titer of anti- RNP antibodies, mixed with SmRNP (Arotec, New Zealand) 
used at final concentration of 10 µg/mL, Supplementary Fig. 1) or PMA (20 nM). In some 
experiments purified 8-OHdG DNA (2.5 µg/mL) combined with anti-8-OHdG antibodies 
(StressMarq Biosciences, Victoria, Canada; clone 15A3) were used. NETs were detached for 
30 minutes at 37 °C with micrococcal nuclease (0.3 U/mL, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) 
diluted in nuclease buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2 
and 50 mM NaCl. In some experiments, NETs were induced by incubating NDGs with the 
A23187 calcium ionophore (25 µM, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) for 90 minutes followed 
by detachment of NETs by DNase I treatment (100 U/mL, Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The 
NET-containing supernatant was stored at −80 °C until analyzed. For LDGs, no stimulation 
was used prior to quantifications or NET isolation, since these cells already spontaneously 
formed NETs5.
Quantification of NETs
Detached NETs were quantified by analyzing Sytox Green (Life Technologies) intensity by 
plate reader (Synergy 2, BioTek, Winooski, VT). In some experiments, NDGs or LDGs were 
plated in 96 well plates (Corning Fisher Scientific) in the presence or absence of NET-
inducing stimuli and an inhibitor: A23187 (25 µM), 3-AT (10 mM, Fisher Scientific), L-
NMMA (200 µM, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or MitoTEMPO (10 µM, Sigma) for 2 hours. 
Sytox orange (500 nM, Life Technologies) was used to detect extracellular DNA, and 
PicoGreen (1:500, Life Technologies) for total DNA. Fluorescence was quantified using the 
BIOTEK plate reader Synergy HTX. As A23187 displays auto-fluorescence in the green 
wavelength range when membrane-bound, the data for NDGs is presented displaying only 
Sytox orange, whereas the ratio of external/total DNA was used for spontaneous LDG NET 
formation.
Visualization and quantification of NETs by fluorescence microscopy
Neutrophils, seeded in coverslips or coverslip chambers were stimulated for 90 minutes at 
37 °C, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, followed 
by 0.5% gelatin for 20 minutes. Cells were stained with antibodies directed against 
neutrophil elastase (1:1,000, ab21595, Abcam), 8-OHG (1:250, ab62623, Abcam), complex 
V subunit d (1:250, catalog #459000, Life Technologies), Hoechst 33342 (1:1,000, Life

 Technologies). After mounting (Prolong, Life Technologies), cells were visualized using a 
confocal LSM780 microscope. In additional experiments, NETs were stained in coverslip 
chambers using MitoSOX Red Mitochondrial Superoxide Indicator (5 µM), and Hoechst 
33342 (1:1,000, all from Life Technologies). NETs were also visualized using fluorescence 
microscopy (EVOS cell imaging system, Life Technologies) quantifying MitoTracker (Life 
Technologies), TOM20 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton CO, clone 4F3), 8-OHdG (StressMarq 
Biosciences, clone 15A3) and DNA (DAPI or Sytox Green).
Quantification ROS production and neutrophil activation
The total ROS detection kit and MitoSOX (2.5 µM) were used according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions (Enzo Life Sciences and Life Technologies, NY). Lupus LDGs 
and control NDGs were incubated with either MitoSox (5 µM) or mitoTracker® green FM 
(100 nM) and cells were quantified by flow cytometry following manufacturer’s instructions 
for concentration and timing and using BD color matched beads for compensation (catalog 
number: 552843 BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Mitochondria were also analyzed by 
flow cytometry using TOM20 antibodies (Novus Biologicals) and Mitosox (Life 
Technologies). In some experiments, neutrophils were treated with pronase (2 mg/mL, 
Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) or DNase (50 µg/mL, Roche) 30 minutes prior to addition of 
TOM20. Neutrophil activation was assessed by cell surface expression of CD66b (clone 
G10F5, BioLegend). Phagocytosis of 8-OHdG ICs was analyzed by flow cytometry and 
immunofluorescence microscopy upon incubation of neutrophils with Alexa Fluor-
conjugated 8-OHdG ICs (2.5 µg/mL, pre-formed as described above) for 30 minutes. 
Phagocytosis index was determined as phagocytosed ICs per neutrophil and field of 
observation. Data were analyzed by FlowJo (Tree Star Inc, Ashland, OR). For all analyses, 
isotype antibodies or fluorescently labeled beads were used as negative controls.
8-OHdG ELISA
For detection of 8-OHdG-modified nucleotides, 250 ng DNA was added to poly-L-lysine-
coated plates (0.01%) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The wells were washed twice in PBS 
and blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA for 2 hours at room temperature. Oxidized 
nucleotides were recognized by a biotinylated mouse-anti-human 8-OHdG antibody 
(StressMarq Biosciences) used at 0.5 µg/mL for 2 hours at room temperature, followed by 
incubation with HRP-conjugated streptavidin. The assay was developed with TMB and 
absorbance analyzed at 450 nm.
8-OHdG and TOM20 fluorescence microscopy
Neutrophils seeded over coverslip chambers (LabTek) pre-coated with poly-lysine 0.01% 
(Sigma) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton for 
10 minutes. Oxidized DNA was detected by biotinylated 8-OHdG antibody (StressMarq 
Biosciences) used at 1 µg/mL and mitochondria (TOM20) was detected using rabbit-anti-
human mAb EPR15581 (1:250, ab186734, Abcam), followed by incubation with Alexa 
Fluor 555 and Alexa 488 donkey anti-mouse and rabbit-conjugated antibodies at 1:250 
(Invitrogen) and Hoechst 1:1000. Cells were resuspended in Prolong and visualized with a 
Zeiss LSM780 laser confocal fluorescence microscope. Images were acquired using the 
microscope’s associated software.

 Immunoprecipitation of oxidized DNA
Neutrophils (4 × 106 cells/mL), stimulated with RNP ICs (40 µg/mL) at a final volume of 
500 µL, were cultured in 24-well plates as described above for 3 h. After addition of 
micrococcal nuclease (0.3 U/mL) for 30 minutes at 37 °C, cell-free supernatants were 
incubated with anti-8-OHdG antibodies (5 µg/mL) coupled to protein G beads (25 µL; 
Thermo Scientific) at 4 °C overnight. After centrifugation and extensive washing, non-8-
OHdG DNA (supernatant) as well as 8-OHdG+ DNA (bound to antibody-bead complex), 
were treated with proteinase K (0.5 µg/mL, Thermo Scientific) for 4 hours at 56 °C. DNA 
was isolated by phenol chloroform extraction. DNA-containing solution was mixed with an 
equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, United States Biochemical 
Corporation, Cleveland, OH) and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 2 minutes to extract the DNA. 
The isolated DNA fraction was resuspended in ethanol with 75 mM sodium acetate (Sigma) 
and allowed to precipitate at −20 °C for 16 hours. After repeated washes in ethanol, DNA 
was resuspended in water.
Quantitative RT-PCR of mitochondrial and chromosomal genes
8 ng of DNA, isolated as described above using phenol chloroform, were mixed with SYBR 
green master mix (Thermo Scientific) and primers (50 nM) for 16S (forward: 5’-CGC ATA 
AGC CTG CGT CAG ATC AA-3’, reverse: 5’-TGT GTT GGG TTG ACA GTG AGG G-3’) 
or 18S (forward: 5’-GTA ACC CGT TGA ACC CCA TT-3’, reverse: 5’-CCA TCC AAT 
CGG TAG TAG CG-3’) at a final volume of 20 µL. Activation of enzyme at 95 °C for 15 
minutes was followed by 40 cycles with 95 °C for 15 seconds and 60 °C for 60 seconds.
Assessment of mitochondrial membrane potential
Neutrophils were incubated in the presence of stimuli for 4 hours, as described in other 
sections. During the last 30 minutes of incubation, JC-1 (5 µg/mL, Enzo Life Sciences) was 
added. Cells were washed twice and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy or flow 
cytometry. In some experiments, chelerythrine chloride (Sigma, 2 µM), was added one hour 
prior to addition of stimuli to the cells.
Quantification of peroxidase activity
Serum samples (20 µL, collected from SLE subjects) were incubated with TMB (BD 
Biosciences) at a final volume of 100 µL for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction 
was ended by addition of 2 N sulfuric acid. The absorbance was analyzed by a plate reader 
at 450 nm. Values are reported as absorbance units with background subtracted or as mU/mL 
using HRP (Sigma) as standard curve.
Quantification of MPO activity
A 96-well plate was coated with 2 µg/mL mouse monoclonal anti-human MPO (AbD 
Serotec, Kidlington, UK; clone 2C7) in PBS overnight. After blocking for 2 hours with 1% 
bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, serum samples or detached NETs were added and 
incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. TMB or Sytox Green was used for detection as 
described above.

 MPO:DNA complexes
High binding 96 well ELISA microplates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse anti-
human MPO (clone 4A4; AbD Serotec) in coating buffer from the Cell Death Detection 
ELISA kit (cat# 11544675001; Roche). After blocking with 1% BSA (cat# A7906; Sigma) 
in PBS, plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10% human plasma in blocking buffer, 
washed, and anti-DNA-POD (clone MCA-33; Roche) was added for 1.5 hour at room 
temperature. Following incubation, TMB substrate (cat# T0440; Sigma) was added and 
absorbance was measured at 450 nm after addition of stop reagent (cat# S5814; Sigma,).
Human neutrophil elastase (HNE):DNA complexes
High binding 96 well ELISA microplates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-
human HNE6 (cat# 481001; Calbiochem) in PBS. After blocking, plates were incubated 
overnight with 10% human plasma in blocking buffer, washed, and incubated for 1 hour at 
room temperature with mouse anti-dsDNA mAb (clone 16-13; EMD Millipore),followed by 
anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugate (cat#1706516; BioRad, Hercules, CA). Procedure was 
completed as for MPO:DNA complexes.
Assessment of serum type-I IFN activity
This was analyzed as previously described56. In brief, human HeLa cells (ATCC® CCL2™, 
ATCC collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (cat# 
11995-065; Gibco), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM L-glutamine, and 1% 
penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were obtained commercially and not 
tested for Mycoplasma. Cells were incubated for 8 hours at 2×105 cells/well in the presence 
of serum (30%) or 1,000 U universal type-I IFN-α (cat# 11200-1; PBL Assay Science, 
Piscataway, NJ). In some of the experiments, neutralizing antibodies to human IFN-α (clone 
MMHA-2; PBL Assay Science,), IFN-β (clone MMHB-2; PBL Assay Science,), or IFN-γ 
(cat# ab9657; Abcam) were also added during incubation. Cells were lysed and RNA 
extracted using Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit (cat# 11-331; Zymo Research, Irvine, CA), and 
cDNA was prepared using the iScript Reverse Transcriptase Supermix for qRTPCR (cat# 
1708840; BioRad). qRTPCR was performed with SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green 
Supermix (cat# 1725270; BioRad) on the BioRad CFX96 Real-Time system. The following 
primers were used; HPRT1 (forward: 5’-TGC TCG AGA TGT GAT GAA GG-3’, reverse: 
3’-TCC CCT GTT GAC TGG TCA TT-5’), MX1 (forward: 5’-TAC CAG GAC TAC GAG 
ATT-3’, reverse: 3’-TGC CAG GAA GGT CTA TTA G-5’), IFI44 (forward: 5’-CTC GGT

 by SLE LDGs, or by A23187-activation of NDGs from healthy controls, using lipofectamine 
following manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). In some experiments, mitochondrial and 
genomic DNA, isolated from mouse splenocytes, mouse heart, Jurkat cells, PBMCs or 
neutrophils, and oxidized by UV-irradiation (250 mJ/cm2) according to previously published 
methods27, 57, was used with the same transfection protocol. We routinely observed 
25-2,000-fold enrichment in mitDNA, depending on species and cellular origin. For some 
experiments, isolated human PBMCs, 3×105 cells/well, were incubated with 250 ng 8-
OHdG-, 8-OHdG+ DNA or R848 (2 µg/mL, Invivogen) without adding transfection reagent. 
After 20 hours, mRNA was isolated (RNeasy Plus Mini Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA), cDNA 
prepared (High capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit, Applied Biosystems), and gene 
expression analyzed by qRT-PCR. The following primers were used: IFNA1 (forward: 5’-
TGG AAG CCT GTG TGA T-3’, reverse: 5’-ATG ATT TCT GCT CTG ACA-3’), IFNB 
(forward: 5’-GTC AGA GTG GAA ATC CTA AG-3’, reverse: 5’-CTG TAA GTC TGT 
TAA TGA AG-3’), EIF2AK2 (forward: 5’-CTT CCA TCT GAC TCA GGT TT-3’, reverse: 
5’-TGC TTC TGA CGG TAT GTA TTA-3’), MX1 (forward: 5’-AGC CAC TGG ACT GAC

(forward: 5’-CTC TAG GCC ACG GAA TTA ACC-3’, reverse: 5’-CTC CTC CAA TCA 
CAA CTG TAG C-3’) and CXCL10 (forward: 5’-ATT TGC TGC CTT ATC TTT CTG-3’, 
reverse: 5’-TCT CAC CCT TCT TTT TCA TTG TAG-3’). In some experiments, culture 
supernatants were saved and analyzed for protein levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8 by ELISA. 
In brief, 96-well plates were coated with capture antibodies at 1 µg/mL overnight (clones 
JK1B-1, MQ2-13A5, catalogue number 431504, respectively), blocked with 1% BSA for 2 
hours, followed by addition of culture supernatants for an additional 2 hours at room 
temperature. Biotinylated detection antibodies were added at 1 µg/mL (clones JK1B-2, 
MQ2-39C3,catalogue number 431504, respectively) and incubated for 2 hours, followed by 
addition of streptavidin-HRP (diluted 1:1,000) and development with TMB. All antibodies 
were from Biolegend and cytokines from Peprotech. Cells were obtained commercially and 
not tested for Mycoplasma.
In vivo effect of 8-OHdG+ DNA
All animal procedures for these experiments were approved by University of Washington’s 
institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice (2–3 month old B57/Bl6 (B6; n = 7, 
mixed gender, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Habor, ME), Tmem173−/− (n = 7, mixed gender, 
generated as described previously58 and kindly provided by Dr. Michael Gale, University of 
Washington) or Myd888−/− (009088, Jackson Laboratory) on a B6 background (n= 8, mixed 
gender) were injected in an unblinded manner with DNA-DOTAP complexes consisting of 
either 1 µg of 8-OHdG+ DNA, CpG DNA ODN 2216 (Invivogen) or PBS combined with 15 
µL DOTAP (Sigma) in PBS (final volume 200 µL). Randomization was based on cage. The 
mice were sacrificed after 6 hours and splenic RNA and cDNA prepared as detailed above. 
For analysis of ISG expression, the following primers were used; Rna18s5 (forward: 5’-
GAG GGA GCC TGA GAA ACG G-3’, reverse: 5’-GTC GGG AGT GGG TAA TTT 
GC-3’), Mx1 (forward: 5’-GGC AGA CAC CAC ATA CAA CC-3’, reverse: 5’-CCT CAG

 GGA CTG TGA GG-3’, reverse: 5’-CTC CAC TTT CAG AGC CTT CG-3’). Sample size 
was chosen based on previous work following similar approaches in mice 33.
In vivo MitoTEMPO administration
All animal procedures for these experiments were approved by NIAMS Animal Care and 
Use Committee. Sample size was chosen based on our previous work with other inhibitors 
of NET formation performed in animal models12, 13. Lupus-prone female MRL/MpJ-
Faslpr/J mice (stock #000485, n= 10 / group) were purchased from The Jackson 
Laboratories. At 11 weeks of age, Alzet osmotic pumps (Alzet model 2006, Cupertino, CA), 
filled with MitoTEMPO (Sigma; daily dosage of 1.5 mg/kg in saline, half of the mice 
selected by cage) or with vehicle (half of the mice selected by cage) were implanted 
subcutaneously in the dorsal area of mice. Assessments were performed in a non-blinded 
manner and randomization to treatment versus vehicle was based on cage. After 7 weeks, 
mice were euthanized (18 weeks of age). Retro-orbital bleedings and urine collection were 
performed when mice were 10, 15, 17 and 18 weeks of age.
Assessment of proteinuria
Exocell (Philadelphia, PA) ELISA kits for creatinine and murine albumin were used to 
calculate urinary protein:creatinine ratios, following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Anti-dsDNA antibodies
Autoantibodies were detected at 1:200 serum dilution using an ELISA kit from Alpha 
diagnostic (Alpha diagnostic, San Antonio, TX), as previously described by our group12
Quantification of NETosis by bone marrow neutrophils
NET formation was quantified in mouse bone marrow neutrophils, after Percoll gradient 
isolation59, using Sytox plate assay as described.11 Briefly, a gradient of Percoll (52%, 69%, 
and 78%) was used to separate bone marrow cells. Cells collected from the Percoll interface 
(69%-52%) after centrifugation (2,800 rpm, 30 minutes) were plated in 96 well-plates 
(200,000 per well) and incubated with Sytox dye. NETosis was quantified as described 
above for the human cells.
Quantification of murine pro-inflammatory gene expression
RNA was isolated from spleens, stored at −80oC in RNA later solution after homogenization 
with Omni tissue homogenizer (Omni International, Kennesaw, GA) and using the Qiagen 
RNeasy kit. The cDNA was synthesized using BIO-RAD iScript reverse transcription 
supermix following manufacturer instructions. qRT-PCR was performed using the primers 
listed below, the Sso Advanced Universal SYBR Green supermix (BioRad) and a BIO-RAD 
CFX96 Real-Time System thermocycler with the template cDNA diluted at 1:5 and 1:10 per 
gene. Gapdh was used as the house-keeping gene and the vehicle treated mice Ct was used 
in the delta delta calculations for the determination of the fold gene expression. The 
following primers were used: Gapdh (forward: 5’-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC-3’, 
reverse: 5’-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3’), Ifna1 (forward: 5’-AAG GAC AGG

Immune complex deposition quantification
Slides of frozen sections of perfused murine kidney were fixed in cold acetone for 10 
minutes, washed and blocked overnight at 4 oC with 10% BSA in PBS. The following Abs 
were added to the kidneys and slides were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature: 
goat Alexa Fluor 594 F(ab’)2 fragment anti-mouse IgG (411020) and anti-C3 FITC 
conjugated GC3-90FZ (Santa Cruz, CA and Immunology Lab Consultants, Portland, OR, 
respectively) at 1:50 dilution and Hoechst at 1:100 (Life Technologies). Following PBS 
washes, tissues were mounted in Prolong and imaged using a Zeiss LSM780 laser confocal 
microscope. The score for fluorescence intensity was determined after analyzing 3 random 
images per animal.
Caspase-1 and IL-18 activity
Protein detection from renal tissue preserved at −80 oC was performed as previously 
described60. Briefly, 100 µg of total protein were resolved in a 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris 
gradient gel (Invitrogen). Proteins were immobilized onto a nitrocellulose membrane 
(Invitrogen) and blocked with 10% BSA for 30 minutes at room temperature. Membrane 
was incubated with anti-caspase-1 clone 5B10 (1:500; eBioscience), rabbit anti-mouse 
caspase-1 (p10) clone M-20 (1:500, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-mouse IL-18 clone H-173 
(1:500, Santa Cruz) or anti-beta-actin (1:1,000; Abcam ab8227) overnight at 4 °C. 
Subsequently, membrane was probed with secondary IRDye680 goat anti-rat or IRDye800 
goat anti-rabbit antibodies (1:10,000, Li-Cor Biosiences, Lincoln, NE) for 1 hour at room 
temperature. Proteins were detected using the Li-Cor Odyssey Infrared Imaging System 
following manufacturer’s instructions (Li-Cor Biosciences).
Statistical analysis
Sample size for experiments using human samples was determined using similar patient 
numbers/experimental condition as in previous publications assessing inhibition of NET 
responses, ISG and/or inflammatory cytokine induction in inflammatory diseases6, 7, 8, 9, 11. 
No samples, mice or data points were excluded from the reported analysis once obtained. All 
analyses were performed unblinded. Normality distribution of the sample sets was 
determined by d’Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test (GraphPad Prism, San Diego, 
Lood et al.

 CA). For sample sets with Gaussian distribution, student’s 2-tailed t-test, paired t-test or 
Pearson’s correlation coefficient were used. For the limited number of sample sets with a 
non-Gaussian distribution, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon’s matched pairs test and 
Spearman’s correlation test were used as applicable. Multiple comparisons, using the same 
group in more than one analysis/hypothesis, were adjusted using Bonferroni correction. For 
assessment of association between ISG and autoimmunity in CGD individuals, Fisher’s 
exact test was applied. All analyses were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05.
