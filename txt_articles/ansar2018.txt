Abstract 
Developmental eye defects often severely reduce vision. Despite extensive efforts, for a 
substantial fraction of these cases the molecular causes are unknown. Recessive eye disorders are 
frequent in consanguineous populations and such large families with multiple affected 
individuals provide an opportunity to identify recessive causative genes.  We studied a Pakistani 
consanguineous family with three affected individuals with congenital vision loss and 
progressive eye degeneration. The family was analyzed by exome sequencing of one affected 
individual and genotyping of all family members. We have identified a non-synonymous 
homozygous variant (NM_001128918.2:c.1708C>G:p.Arg570Gly) in the MARK3 gene as the 
likely cause of the phenotype. Given that MARK3 is highly conserved in flies (I: 55%; S: 67%) 
we knocked down the MARK3 homologue, par-1, in the eye during development. This leads to a 
significant reduction in eye size, a severe loss of photoreceptors and loss of vision based on 
electroretinogram (ERG) recordings. Expression of the par-1 p.Arg792Gly mutation (equivalent 
to the MARK3 variant found in patients) in developing fly eyes also induces loss of eye tissue 
and reduces the ERG signals.  The data in flies and human indicate that the MARK3 variant 
corresponds to a loss of function. We conclude that the identified mutation in MARK3 establishes 
a new gene-disease link, since it likely causes structural abnormalities during eye development 
and visual impairment in humans, and that the function of MARK3/par-1 is evolutionarily 
conserved in eye development.

Introduction 
Developmental eye birth defects are of clinical significance due to severely reduced visual 
impairment (VI), yet the genetic cause of only a small number of gene variants associated with 
developmental eye defects has been identified (1).  VI causes a significant burden in the life of 
individuals and has a strong impact on their psychological and socioeconomic experiences. The 
elucidation of the genomic causality provides a better understanding of the molecular 
pathophysiology of the various forms of VI, enhances the diagnostic possibilities, and provides 
targets and possible strategies for therapeutic interventions (2, 3). Mendelian disorders provide a 
direct way to identify genes and variants of high phenotypic impact (4). Large consanguineous 
families with multiple affected individuals are an obvious source to identify pathogenic genetic 
variants in recessive disorders (5-8). It has been estimated that more than 10% of marriages 
occur among close relatives worldwide (9); in some countries, this reaches almost 70%, and this 
is the case in Pakistan (www.consang.net). We argue that a considerable number of additional 
recessive 
genes 
implicated 
in 
VI 
could 
be 
identified 
in 
these 
populations 
(https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/) 
Here, we report a Pakistani consanguineous family of three affected individuals with severe VI 
and progressive eye loss. The family was analyzed by combining whole exome sequencing and 
homozygosity mapping, which is a powerful and cost-effective methodology to identify 
candidate genes in undiagnosed families with likely autosomal recessive disorders (10-12). We 
identified a homozygous, undoubtedly pathogenic missense variant in MARK3 (microtubule-
associated protein/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 3) gene (OMIM* 602678) that is likely 
to cause  VI and the progressive phthisis bulbi in patients after birth. Modeling of the variant in

Results 
Phenotypes: Family F105 with three affected individuals (Figure 1), is of Pakistani origin from 
the area of Jamshoro, Sindh, Pakistan. Parents are first cousins once removed. All three probands 
had poor vision at birth. Individuals V:2 and V:3, who are 30-years and 18-years old 
respectively, developed eye phthisis by adulthood. Individual V:5, a 15 years old female, has 
poor vision with low acuity along with hazy cornea (Figures 1 and 2).   
The MRI findings revealed that bilaterally the eye globe was deformed and smaller in size in 
both probands V:2 and V:3. In addition, there was a loss of the normal structural differentiation 
between the anterior and posterior chambers, including aqueous and vitreous humor. The right 
and left eye globes were measured as 1.7x 1.4 cm and 1.7x1.5 cm respectively in V:2; while in 
V:3 they were 2.0x1.8 cm and 2.0x1.7 cm (normal=2.42±0.96x2.41±0.97 cm) (13) (Figure 2). B-
scan and A-scan ultrasonography of affected individual V:3 showed that the posterior wall was 
thick along with vitreous opacity, and the interior-posterior chamber was small with an axial 
diameter of about 14 mm (normal=24mm). No posterior eye wall was detected in patient V:2 on 
the B scan (Figure 2). The ophthalmologic examination of patient V:5 showed hypermetropia 
with corneal plana and ptosis. The best corrected visual acuity was 2/60 and 6/60 in the right and 
left eye respectively. Fundoscopic examination revealed a clear fundus with a normal cup and 
disk ratio and the tonometry indicated normal IOP in both eyes (17 mm/Hg OD, 12 mm/Hg OS).  
Genetic analysis: Exome sequencing was performed in one affected individual (V:3) of the 
family, and 95.3% of the target exome regions were covered by more than 10 reads. We did not 
find any potential likely pathogenic variant by considering all of the 261 genes that have been

documented to affect vision, including those in the RetNet (https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/) database. 
Subsequently, we used a 720K SNP-array to genotype all five siblings (V:1, V:2, V:3, V:4 and 
V:5) and both parents (III:1 and IV:1) of family F105. By combining both the exome sequence 
and genotyping data through CATCH (14) analysis, we identified two candidate variants that 
segregated in the family with a recessive pattern of inheritance; the first was in the MARK3 gene 
(NM_001128918.2:c.1708C>G:p.Arg570Gly) on chromosome 14 (OMIM* 602678), and the 
second in the PAH gene (NM_000277.2:c.355C>T:p.Pro119Ser) on chromosome 12 (OMIM 
*612349). The segregation of both variants was confirmed through Sanger sequencing in all 
members of the family (Figure 1 and Supp. Figure 1).  
The missense variant in MARK3, segregates with the disease phenotype in a recessive fashion in 
the seven members of the family studied, with the LOD score of 1.45 (Figure 1). The frequency 
of this variant in the gnomAD database (http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) is 0.000052 and the 
pLI 
(probability 
of 
LoF 
intolerance) 
for 
MARK3 
in 
the 
ExAC 
database 
(http://exac.broadinstitute.org/) (15) is zero, suggesting that null mutations in one allele of 
MARK3 are not uncommon and that a disease associated with the gene would likely be recessive 
(MARRVEL.org) (16). The MARK3 variant is predicted to be pathogenic by various prediction 
algorithms (DANN (17) score: 0.99). MARK3 Arg570 is very well conserved down to 
Drosophila (MARRVEL.org) (16) (Supp. Figure 2).  
The non-synonymous variant PAH p.Pro119Ser has been classified as likely pathogenic in 
ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) because in a compound heterozygote 
P119S/IVS12+1G>A case, the phenotype was a mild PKU (phenylketonuria) with phenylalanine 
levels of 440µmol/L (18). Furthermore, the p.Pro119Ser variant is categorized as BH4

(tetrahydrobiopterin) responsive type of PKU (19).  The phenotype in the subjects V:2, V:3 and 
V:5 was not compatible with the PKU; however, we have measured phenylalanine and tyrosine 
levels from Guthrie cards.  Individual V:2 has phenylalanine 117µmol/L and tyrosine 36µmol/L 
and individual V3 has 148µmol/L phenylalanine and 46µmol/L tyrosine (normal levels are 
phenylalanine: 26-98µmol/L, and tyrosine: 35-107µmol/L). These results confirm that the 
phenylalanine levels were slightly increased but not in the PKU disease range. We conclude that 
the homozygosity of the PAH p.Pro119Ser variant does not result in PKU in this family. This 
“incidental” finding, which is not related to the eye phenotype, provides additional information 
in the Phenylketonuria field related to the interpretation of this variant.  It helps populate public 
databases with genomic variants from consanguineous individuals so that homozygosity for 
likely pathogenic variants can be evaluated against certain phenotypes. 
Drosophila model analysis: The homologue of MARK3 with the highest DIOPT score (11/12) 
in Drosophila is par-1, indicating that par-1 is the orthologue of MARK3 (16). We therefore used 
two independent RNAis to reduce Par-1 expression in the developing eye by driving the RNAis 
with the eyeless GAL4 (ey-GAL4) driver (20) which is expressed throughout eye development. 
As shown in Figure 3, this leads to a significant reduction in eye size (Figures 3A-C) and a 
reduced amplitude of the ERGs (Figures 3D-F). Control RNAi experiments do not affect the eye 
morphology (Supp. Figure 3).  The most severe phenotype associated with RNAi-2 causes not 
only a severe reduction in amplitude, arguing that the retinal function is severely impaired, but 
also causes a loss of on-off transients (arrows in Figure 3F, Figures 3H-I), indicating a loss of 
vision. We confirmed that the ey>par-1 RNAi successfully knocked down the Par-1 protein level 
in developing eye using a polyclonal Par-1 antibody (Figures 3J-K). Importantly, the number of

developing photoreceptors marked by Elav antibody which labels neurons/photoreceptors, is 
severely reduced in eye imaginal discs when compared to control discs (Figures 3N-O). In 
summary, the data show that Par-1 is required for proper eye development and photoreceptor 
differentiation and that its loss leads to vision loss.  
To investigate the functional effects of the identified MARK3 variants, we created the equivalent 
Drosophila par-1 mutation (p.Arg792Gly) and generated transgenic animals harboring this 
variant cDNA (UAS-par-1 p.Arg792Gly) as well as the wild-type Drosophila cDNA (UAS-par-1 
WT). We again used ey-GAL4 to express these cDNAs in the developing eye (21). As a negative 
control, we expressed the lacZ gene with ey-GAL4 and observed a normal eye morphology and 
ERG (Figures 4B and 4F). Expression of the wild-type Par-1 protein in the developing eye 
causes a mild defect in eye morphology and a subtle reduction in ERG amplitude (Figures 4C 
and 4G). In contrast, expression of the Par-1 p.Arg792Gly variant induces severely reduced eyes 
that are very rough and causes a near complete loss of amplitude of the ERG (Figures 4D, 4H-I). 
In summary, these data suggest that Par-1 p.Arg792Gly acts as a dominant negative mutation in 
flies when overexpressed.

Discussion 
We propose here that the biallelic non-synonymous p.Arg570Gly variant in the MARK3 gene 
likely causes the eye degeneration and visual impairment in the affected individuals of the 
Pakistani consanguineous family F105. MARK3 is involved in the phosphorylation of various 
microtubule associated proteins MAP2 (OMIM *157130), MAP4 (OMIM *157132) and 
tau/MAPT (OMIM *157140) (22). Loss of MAPT protein results in defects in photoreceptor 
development in Drosophila (23), and a small eye phenotype was observed in transgenic rats 
bearing a human MAPT gene (24).  Also, MARK3 interacts with Mitf (25), which is known to 
cause the COMMAD syndrome with severe microphthalmia (26). MARK3 together with DLG5 
function as negative regulators of the Hippo pathway: the MARK3/DLG5 complex inhibits the 
kinase activity of MST1/2 and LATS1 by inhibiting the MST1/2 mediated phosphorylation of 
LATS1 (22). The MARK3 knockout mouse presented with resistance to weight gain under high 
fat diet and exhibited defects in gluconeogenesis (27). However, these mice were not studied for 
phenotypes related to vision. This colony of mice does no longer exists and was not available for 
further studies.  
We studied the par-1 (ortholog of MARK3) gene in Drosophila. We found that the down-
regulation of par-1 by RNAi specifically in the eye leads to a very severe loss of photoreceptors 
in the developing fly eye and causes a near or complete loss of visual function based on ERG 
(Figure 3).  Moreover, expression of Par-1 p.Arg792Gly, the equivalent of human variant p. 
Arg570Gly, results in a small, non-functional eye which closely resembles the ey>par-1 RNAi 
phenotype. These data strongly suggest that the MARK3 p.Arg570Gly variant is pathogenic.

MARK3/par-1 is a Ser/Thr kinase initially identified as an essential polarity gene for a proper 
asymmetric division in C. elegans embryos (28). Prior studies in invertebrates and vertebrates 
have shown that the MARK3/par-1 homologs are necessary for cell polarity and that loss-of-
function mutations are associated with a range of developmental defects (29-32).  In Drosophila, 
Par-1 is necessary for anterior-posterior axis formation, and par-1 loss-of-function embryos 
exhibit severe patterning defects (33). Moreover, loss of Par-1 in various imaginal discs leads to 
a mild reduction in tissue size, induces some apoptotic cell death during development and affects 
Hippo signaling (34). 
In Xenopus, early dorsoanterior development of the embryo is disrupted by the loss of par-1. 
This causes a loss of Wnt signaling (32). Interestingly, in the same study, knocking down of par-
1 expression resulted in a lack of eye development as well as a decrease in body axis length. Wnt 
signaling is involved in eye development and retinal angiogenesis (35-37). Other genes involved 
in Wnt signaling have been implicated in eye diseases in humans. For instance, individuals with 
pathogenic mutations in FZD4, another core component of the Wnt pathway, disrupts retinal 
angiogenesis (38, 39). Furthermore, individuals with mutations in the FZD4 binding partner, 
NDP, are affected by Norrie disease (40). These mutations cause blindness as well as phenotypes 
that are very similar to those observed in the patients with the MARK3 p.Arg570Gly variant. 
Hence, MARK3/par-1 is evolutionarily critical for early eye development and may affect Wnt 
signaling. 
The study of the incidental finding in the PAH gene emphasizes the notion that the pathogenicity 
of variants for recessive disorders should be evaluated in the context of the other allele. In the 
case of the family F105 presented here, the PAH p.Pro119Ser variant in homozygosity cause a

mild increase of the phenylalanine level but not in the phenylketonuria range. On the other hand, 
the same PAH p.Pro119Ser variant in combination with a “null” splicing error causes mild 
phenylketonuria that requires treatment (18). The further development of databases of recessive 
variants would be essential for the interpretation of their phenotypic relationship and the genetic 
counseling regarding the at-risk carrier status.   
We did not find other cases of mutations in MARK3 by sharing our findings in Genematcher 
(41). Additional families with MARK3 pathogenic variants and similar eye phenotype will be 
necessary to establish causality. Patients with Norrie-like phenotype but with an autosomal mode 
of inheritance should be evaluated for MARK3 pathogenic variants if possible. We conclude that 
the MARK3 homozygous missense variant is an excellent candidate to cause the progressive 
phthisis of the eyes and visual impairment at birth observed in our patients.

Materials and Methods 
Patients and study consent: The family was enrolled at the Molecular Biology & Genetics 
Department, Medical Research Center, Liaquat University of Medical & Health Sciences, 
Jamshoro, Pakistan, and was studied at the Department of Genetic Medicine and Development, 
University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland. This current study was approved by the Bioethics 
Committee of the University Hospitals of Geneva (Protocol number: CER 11-036), and by the 
ethical committee of Liaquat University of Medical & Health Sciences, Jamshoro, Pakistan. 
Informed consent was obtained from the members of this family. 
Clinical Investigations: The detailed clinical investigations were performed on all affected 
individuals to characterize the variability of the phenotype. MRI of orbit was performed on 
patients V:2 and V:3 of Figure 1, and T1, T2 weighted images were obtained without contrast in 
axial, coronal and sagittal planes. Bilateral B and A scans were also performed on patients V:2 
and V:3. The Patient V:5 was subjected to fundoscopy, tonometry, and visual acuity 
assessments. 
Laboratory and Computational analysis: Exome sequencing was performed using the 
SureSelect Human All Exon kit v5 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) on an 
Illumina HiSeq4000. The data analysis was done by using a customized pipeline, based on 
Burrows-Wheeler 
aligner 
tool 
(BWA) 
(42), 
SAMtools 
(42), 
PICARD 
(http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) and GATK (43). The alignment was performed by using 
the reference human genome (GRCh37/hg19) (44). Genotyping of samples from all available 
family members was done using the 720K SNP array (HumanOmniExpress Bead Chip by

Illumina Inc®, San Diego, CA, USA). PLINK (45) was used to perform homozygosity mapping 
by taking into account a window of 50 consecutive homozygous SNPs, allowing a maximum of 
one mismatch in a homozygous region. Runs of homozygosity (ROH) were defined as 
homozygous regions separated by the first contiguous heterozygous SNPs. The family was 
analyzed by using CATCH (14), an in-house program which combines the information of family 
pedigree, ROH, and data of exome sequence. This program identifies variants in the ROHs of 
patients but not in normal individuals of a family. Subsequently, the variants were filtered as 
described in previous studies (11, 12). All the candidate variants were further verified by Sanger 
sequencing.  
Cloning and Transgenesis: Site-directed mutagenesis was performed for full-length cDNA of 
par-1 in the pENTR223 Gateway donor vector (RE47050 from Drosophila Genomics Resource 
Center). To generate a par-1 p.Arg792Gly (R792G) (equivalent to human MARK3 p.Arg570Gly 
(R570G), we performed site-directed mutagenesis using the following primers; FW : 5’-
CTTTCACTCTGGTCAAACCGGAGCACGAAACAACACAGCG-3’ 
RV 
: 
5’-
CGCTGTGTTGTTTCGTGCTCCGGTTTGACCAGAGTGAAAG-3’. The fully sequenced 
pENTR223 par-1 WT and pENTR223 par-1 R792G clones were subcloned into pGW-attB-
HA(46) vector to generate pGW-attB-HA-par-1 WT and pGWattB-HA-par-1 R792G. These 
constructs were injected into y,w,ΦC31; VK33 embryos (47) and transgenic flies were selected 
by the w+ marker on pGW-attB-HA vector. 
ERG recording of fly eye: ERG recordings were performed as described by Verstreken et al, 
(2003) (48). In brief, flies were glued to a glass slide. A recording electrode filled with 3M NaCl 
was placed on the eye, and another reference electrode on the fly head. During the recording, a 1

v1; P{TRiP.GL00253}attP2 (RRID: BDSC_32410). All flies were maintained at 25°C.  For 
measuring eye size, we used ImageJ.  
Immunohistochemistry: Eye discs were dissected from third instar larvae, fixed in periodate-
lysine-paraformaldehyde (PLP) fixative for 15 min at room temperature (RT) and incubated with 
primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Primary antibodies were as follows: α-Elav (1:200, 
7E8A10, DSHB, Iowa City, IA) (49), α-Par-1 (1:200) (50). Secondary antibodies conjugated 
with Cy3, Cy5 or Alexa 488 were from Jackson ImmunoResearch and were incubated for 
imaging in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Fluorescent 
images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope.
