ABSTRACT
Introduction: Electrostatic
charge
in
valved
holding chambers (VHCs) may lead to incon-
sistent metered-dose inhaler (MDI) asthma drug
delivery. We compared the AeroChamber Plus�
Flow Vu� Antistatic Valved Holding Chamber
(AC?FV
AVHC)
with
non-antistatic
control
VHCs
in
terms
of
asthma
exacerbations,
resource use, and cost in an asthma population.
Methods: Patients included in an adjudicated
claims database with AC?FV AVHC or non-an-
tistatic VHC (control VHC) use between 1/2010
and 8/2015 (index) who were treated with an
inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or a combination of
an ICS and a long-acting b2 agonist MDI within
60 days before or after the index date, were
diagnosed with asthma, and had C12 months
of pre- and C30 days of post-index health plan
enrollment were included. Cohorts were mat-
ched 1:1 using propensity scores. We compared
incidence rates (IR) of exacerbation, time to first
exacerbation using Kaplan–Meier survival anal-
ysis, occurrence of exacerbations, and health-
care resource use and costs using generalized
linear models.
Results: 9325 patients in each cohort were
identified. The IR of exacerbations per 100 per-
son-days (95% CI) was significantly higher in
the control VHC cohort than the AC?FV AVHC
cohort
[0.161
(0.150–0.172)
vs.
0.137
(0.128–0.147)]. A higher proportion of exacer-
bation-free patients was observed in the AC?FV
AVHC cohort. Among the 4293 patients in each
cohort with C12 months of follow-up, AC?FV
AVHC patients were found to be 10–12% less
likely than control VHC patients to experience
an exacerbation throughout the study period. A
lower proportion of the AC?FV AVHC patients
had an ED visit compared to the control VHC
patients (10.8% vs. 12.4%). Exacerbation-re-
lated costs for the AC?FV AVHC cohort were
23%, 25%, 20%, and 12% lower than those for
the
control
VHC
cohort
at
1,
6,
9,
and
12 months, respectively.
Conclusions: The AC?FV AVHC was associated
with lower exacerbation rates, delayed time to
first exacerbation, and lower exacerbation-re-
lated costs when compared to control non-an-
tistatic VHCs.

INTRODUCTION
Asthma is a common respiratory condition
which affects approximately 7.4% of the US adult
population and 8.6% of the US pediatric popu-
lation [1]. The condition is characterized by air-
way inflammation which can lead to recurrent
episodes of exacerbations and cause symptoms of
wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and
coughing [2, 3]. These episodes of exacerbations
often require treatment with a corticosteroid to
reduce airway inflammation, and patients with
worsening symptoms are commonly treated in
the hospital or emergency department (ED)
[4, 5]. In the US, asthma exacerbations result in
15 million outpatient visits, 2 million ED visits,
and 500,000 inpatient admissions annually [5].
The annual direct and indirect cost of asthma
care in the US is around $56 billion [6].
Medications administered by metered dose
inhalers (MDIs), such as inhaled corticosteroids
(ICS) and bronchodilators, are the mainstay of
long-term control asthma treatment to prevent
the occurrence of exacerbations [5, 7, 8]. How-
ever, patients with poor hand-breath actuation
coordination may have difficulty in using MDIs
properly and can remain vulnerable to exacer-
bations [5, 9]. Valved holding chambers (VHCs)
are designed to reduce oropharyngeal deposi-
tion by substantially changing the aerodynamic
particle size distribution of the inhaled aerosol,
and can assist in improving drug delivery to the
lungs by holding the aerosol plume of medica-
tion-loaded particles until the patient is ready
to inhale, eliminating the need to carefully
coordinate the timing of MDI actuation and
inhalation [10, 11]. A recent study assessing the
relationship
between
asthma
control
and
patient ability to use their MDIs found that
patients who used a spacer with their MDIs had
significantly better asthma control compared to
those who used MDIs alone [12]. However, the
effectiveness of VHCs and other spacer devices
can be adversely affected by electrostatic charge,
a commonly reported cause of inconsistent
medication delivery [13].
Valved
holding
chamber
(VHC)
devices
made of antistatic materials offer a potential
solution by reducing dose variability related to
electrostatic charge, and may in theory help
improve asthma control in patients who use
VHCs to assist with aerosolized drug delivery
[13, 14]. A laboratory investigation by Suggett
et al. found that antistatic VHCs delivered more
respirable medication from the MDI compared
to non-antistatic VHCs, in part due to the
antistatic nature of the materials [15]. However,
no clinical or real-world studies have evaluated
the effects of an antistatic VHC on asthma
outcomes. The AeroChamber Plus� Flow Vu�
Antistatic Valved Holding Chamber (AC?FV
AVHC) is an antistatic VHC designed to be used
with pressurized MDIs to administer aerosolized
medication in patients who may have difficulty
with the coordination and control involved in
using MDIs correctly. An additional benefit of
the AC?FV AVHC is the incorporation of an
inspiratory
flow
indicator
(IFI)
for
the
patient/caregiver to observe effective inhala-
tion. The IFI provides real-time feedback con-
firming an effective inhalation and ensures that
there are no leakages of ambient air into the
space between facemask and face that could
prevent medication delivery altogether [16, 17].
The objective of this study was to compare the
effects of the antistatic AC?FV AVHC and
non-antistatic control VHCs on treatment out-
comes, resource use, and healthcare costs in a
real-world asthma population.
METHODS
This retrospective database study used data
from the QuintilesIMS Real-World Data Adju-
dicated Claims Database (formerly known as
PharMetrics Plus). The database contains adju-
dicated medical and pharmacy claims for more
than 150 million US health plan members from
2006 onwards. The data are patient-level, lon-
gitudinal, and representative of the US com-
mercially
insured
population.
The
database
covers 90% of US hospitals, 80% of all US doc-
tors’ offices, and relate to 85% of Fortune 100
employees. Inpatient and outpatient diagnoses
are recorded as International Classification of
284
Pulm Ther (2017) 3:283–296
 Diseases (ninth and tenth revisions) Clinical
Modification
(ICD-9/10-CM)
codes.
Data
include inpatient and outpatient procedures,
dates of service, retail and mail-order claims,
inpatient stay, and provider specialty. Amounts
allowed and paid by health plans are available
for all services provided along with the dates of
service for all claims. Other data elements
available
include
demographic
information
(patient age, gender, and geographical region),
product type (e.g., health maintenance organi-
zation and preferred provider organizations),
payer type (e.g., commercial and self-insured),
and
start
and
stop
dates
of
health
plan
enrollment.
Patients were selected for the study if they
were
treated
with
an
AC?FV
AVHC
or
a
non-antistatic
VHC
(control
VHC)
between
January 1, 2010 and August 31, 2015 (the ‘‘se-
lection window’’). The date of the first VHC
device within the selection window was defined
as the index date. All patients had to be treated
with a long-term controller medication [inhaled
corticosteroid (ICS) or fixed-dose combination
of ICS and long-acting b2 agonist (ICS/LABA)]
MDI within 60 days before or 60 days after the
index date. All patients had at least 12 months
of continuous healthcare coverage before the
index date (‘‘preindex period’’), were diagnosed
with asthma (ICD-9: 493.x) on index date or
during the preindex period, and had at least
30 days of continuous healthcare coverage after
the index date (‘‘post-index period’’). Patients
were excluded if they had incomplete age,
gender, or payer information; had a diagnosis of
COPD (ICD-9: 490.x, 491.x, 492.x, 494.x, 495.x,
and 496.x) on the index date or during the
preindex period; or discontinued their long--
term control MDI before index. In order to
ensure that patients were newly treated with an
AC?FV AVHC or control VHC, patients treated
with AC?FV AVHC were excluded if they had
evidence of non-AC?FV AVHC use (antistatic or
control VHC) at any time during the study or
AC?FV AVHC use during the preindex period.
Patients treated with control VHC were exclu-
ded if they had evidence of any antistatic VHC
use at any time during the study, or had control
VHC use during the preindex period. Patients
were
categorized
into
mutually
exclusive
cohorts (AC?FV AVHC cohort or control VHC
cohort) based on the type of VHC at the index
date.
In order to reduce pretreatment confounders
between the cohorts, patients in the AC?FV
AVHC cohort were propensity score (PS) mat-
ched to patients in the control VHC cohort at a
1:1 ratio using a greedy matching algorithm
without replacement [18]. Patients were mat-
ched on baseline age categories (0–2, 3–5, 6–12,
13–17, 18–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65–74, 75 or
older), gender, geographic region (Northeast,
Midwest, South, West), Charlson comorbidity
index (CCI) category (0, 1, 2, 3, 4?) [19],
comorbid conditions [attention deficit hyper-
activity disorder (ADHD), allergic rhinitis, ane-
mia,
anxiety,
cancer,
bronchopneumonia,
cardiac disease, cerebrovascular disease, depres-
sion,
diabetes,
hypertension,
obesity,
other
vascular
diseases,
pneumonia,
pulmonary
hypertension, and respiratory infection], medi-
cation history [ICS, short-acting b2 agonist
(SABA), LABA, fixed-dose ICS/LABA and oral
corticosteroids (OCS)], type of MDI (ICS or fix-
ed-dose ICS/LABA), history of respiratory sup-
port including oxygen therapy and mechanical
ventilation, history of severe exacerbations,
history of moderate exacerbations, and history
of all-cause hospitalizations. Patients without
appropriate matches were not included in the
analysis.
Treatment outcomes included number of
patients with asthma exacerbations (moderate
to severe); number of exacerbations per patient
at 1, 6, 9, and 12 months after the index date;
and time (days) to the first exacerbations. These
measures were reported for patients with at least
12 months of post-index follow-up. Exacerba-
tion severity was defined according to the lit-
erature [20–22]. A moderate exacerbation was
defined as an ED visit claim (not leading to a
hospital admission) with an asthma diagnosis,
or an OCS prescription fill within 30 days of a
physician visit with an asthma diagnosis; a
severe exacerbation was defined as an inpatient
admission claim with an asthma diagnosis.
Furthermore, the incidence rate (IR) of exacer-
bations (either moderate or severe) was mea-
sured for patients with at least 30 days of
post-index follow-up. The IR was defined as the
Pulm Ther (2017) 3:283–296
285
 number of patients with an event divided by
total time spent at risk, which was from the
index date to the end of enrollment, the end of
the study period, discontinuation of index
treatment (at least 60 days between the end of
the supply and the next prescription fill), or the
occurrence of an event—whichever occurred
first during the variable follow-up. Asthma-re-
lated healthcare resource use measures included
hospitalizations, outpatient visits, ED visits,
laboratory tests, and ancillary and other services
based on medical claims with an asthma diag-
nosis as well as prescriptions for an asthma
medication.
Asthma-related
costs
associated
with
these
resources
were
also
reported.
Healthcare resource use and cost measures over
12 months
of
follow-up
were
reported
for
patients with at least 12 months of post-index
follow up. The use of a fixed follow-up period
was required to ensure a fair comparison of
these measures between the two cohorts.
Baseline patient characteristics were repor-
ted using descriptive statistics, with frequency
(n, %) for categorical measures and mean,
standard deviation (SD), median, minimum,
and maximum values for continuous vari-
ables.
Treatment
outcomes,
healthcare
resource use measures, and related costs in the
AC?FV AVHC cohort and matched control
VHC cohort were compared using bivariate
chi-square tests for proportions and Student’s
t test for means. The numbers of moder-
ate-to-severe exacerbations per patient in the
AC?FV AVHC and control VHC cohorts were
also compared using rate ratios, defined as the
number of moderate-to-severe exacerbations
per
patient
in
the
antistatic
VHC
cohort
divided by the number of moderate-to-severe
exacerbations per patient in the control VHC
cohort. The proportions of patients without
an exacerbation in the AC?FV AVHC cohort
and the control VHC cohort were compared
using a Kaplan–Meier estimation of time to
first occurrence of a moderate-to-severe exac-
erbation. In addition to the t test of differ-
ences in the mean costs of the two matched
sample, a regression analysis was performed in
the unmatched population to confirm the
results of the bivariate analysis of healthcare
costs
in
the
matched
population.
In
the
regression
analysis,
the
marginal
effect
of
AC?FV AVHC on per-patient costs for mod-
erate-to-severe
exacerbations
was
measured
using generalized linear models (GLMs) with a
log link and gamma family distribution, along
with
covariate
adjustments
to
control
for
potential confounders. All inferential statisti-
cal
analyses
were
conducted
assuming
a
two-tailed test of significance and a alpha
level set a priori at 0.05. All analyses were
conducted using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC, USA).
No institutional review board (IRB) review
was required for this retrospective cohort anal-
ysis
using
HIPAA-compliant
de-identified
patient data.
RESULTS
Demographics and Clinical Characteristics
There were 156,801 patients treated with the
AC?FV AVHC in the database within the selec-
tion window. After applying the selection cri-
teria,
13,995
antistatic
VHC
patients
were
retained. After PS matching, a total of 9325
antistatic VHC patients and 9325 control VHC
patients
were
identified
for
the
analyses
(Table 1).
Table 2 shows baseline demographic and
clinical characteristics for the AC?FV AVHC and
control VHC cohorts. The cohorts were bal-
anced on all baseline characteristics (p values
[
0.05). The mean age was 12.2 years, and the
majority of patients were 17 years or younger.
All patients had at least one comorbidity (CCI
score C1), and the most common comorbidities
were respiratory infection (C68.7%), allergic
rhinitis (C40.3%), and pneumonia (C12.4%).
The majority of the patients were prescribed an
ICS (C87.1%) and/or SABA (C85.3%) on or prior
to the index VHC, and half of the patients were
prescribed an OCS (C50.3%). Most patients used
their index VHC with an ICS (C93.0%). Prior to
the index VHC, less than half of the patients
had a moderate exacerbation (C45.0%), and
fewer had a severe exacerbation (C4.4%) or an
all-cause
hospitalization
(C6.0%).
Very
few
patients were on oxygen therapy or mechanical
ventilation (C0.2%).

 Occurrence of Moderate-to-Severe
Exacerbations
Among patients with at least 30 days of fol-
low-up (n = 9325 for each cohort), the incidence
rate of moderate-to-severe exacerbations per 100
person-days (95% CI) was significantly higher in
the control VHC cohort than in the AC?FV
AVHC cohort [0.161 (0.150–0.172) vs. 0.137
(0.128–0.147)] (Table 3). Average time from the
index date to the first moderate-to-severe exac-
erbation was 141.9 (SD ±106.87) days for the
AC?FV AVHC cohort and 135.7 (SD ±107.62)
days for the control VHC cohort (p = 0.2714).
The Kaplan–Meier curve of time to moder-
ate-to-severe exacerbation revealed that the
proportion of exacerbation-free patients was
greater in the AC?FV AVHC cohort than the
control VHC cohort throughout the study per-
iod (chi square = 12.05, DF = 1.00, p\0.05;
Fig. 1).
Table 4 shows the occurrence of moder-
ate-to-severe
exacerbations
among
the
subgroup of patients with at least 12 months of
follow-up. Among the 4293 patients in each
cohort, 29.5% of the AC?FV AVHC patients
(n = 1265) and 30.6% of the control VHC
patients (n = 1314) had at least one moder-
ate-to-severe
exacerbation
during
the
study
period (p = 0.2487). Mean number of moder-
ate-to-severe
exacerbations
per
patient
at
1 month was 0.07 (SD ±0.34) for AC?FV AVHC
and
0.08
(SD
±0.34)
for
control
VHC
(p = 0.0944);
mean
number
of
moder-
ate-to-severe
exacerbations
per
patient
at
12 months was 0.54 (SD ±1.17) for AC?FV
AVHC and 0.60 (SD ±1.30) for control VHC
(p = 0.0674). Patients using the AC?FV AVHC
had a significantly lower number of moder-
ate-to-severe exacerbations compared to those
using the control VHC both at 6 months [0.29
(SD ±0.78) for AC?FV AVHC and 0.33 (SD
±0.86)
for
control
VHC;
p\0.05]
and
at
9 months [0.42 (SD ±0.99] for AC?FV AVHC
and 0.47 (SD ±1.09) for control VHC; p\0.05].

In Table 5 it can be seen that, over 12 months of
follow-up, a small proportion of the patients had
an asthma-related hospitalization in both cohorts
(3.0% for AC?FV AVHC vs. 3.7% for control VHC;
p = 0.0702). The average number of hospitaliza-

DISCUSSION
This is the first real-world study comparing an
AC?FV
AVHC
with
control
non-antistatic
VHCs. Findings from this study add to the body
of literature supporting the benefits of using
VHCs with inhaler medications for treating
asthma [23, 24]. The addition of VHCs can help
make hand-held inhalers easier to use, espe-
cially for patients who have difficulty using
MDIs. Asthma disease control is highly associ-
ated with drug delivery to the lungs, and the use
of VHCs can help improve deposition of asthma
medications into the lower respiratory tract
compared to MDIs alone. Moreover, an anti-
static VHC could result in better drug delivery
compared to non-antistatic VHCs by limiting
the electrostatic charge in the chamber and
increasing the amount of aerosol cloud avail-
able for deposition to the lungs [25].

 In our study, about 29.5% of the patients in
the AC?FV AVHC group experienced at least
one moderate-to-severe exacerbation
in the
12-month follow-up period (30.6% of patients
in the control VHC group), which is slightly
lower than the proportion of patients with an
exacerbation (34.4%) reported in a previously
published retrospective database study con-
ducted in a similar patient population [26]. That
study also reported a mean of 1.40 exacerba-
tions per patient per year in females and a mean
of 1.43 exacerbations per patient per year in
males on ICS therapy, as well as 1.42 exacerba-
tions per patient per year in females and 1.40
exacerbations per patient per year in males on
ICS/LABA therapy [26]. In comparison, our
study reports fewer exacerbations per patient
(0.54
moderate-to-severe
exacerbations
per
patient
in
the
AC?FV
AVHC
group
at
12 months and 0.60 moderate-to-severe exac-
erbations per patient in the control VHC group
at 12 months). The rate ratios of exacerbations
between the two cohorts show that the likeli-
hood of patients in the AC?FV AVHC group
experiencing a moderate-to-severe exacerbation
trends lower than that for the control VHC
group throughout the follow-up period, sug-
gesting that adding the AC?FV AVHC to an
MDI may help improve the management of
asthma exacerbations compared to adding a
control VHC.
Additionally, among patients with at least
30 days of follow-up, we found that the AC?FV
AVHC group had a significantly lower incidence
rate of moderate-to-severe exacerbations than
the control VHC group. This has potential
implications for early treatment outcomes in
asthma such as controlling future exacerbations
because
previous
exacerbations
have
been
reported to be a risk factor for future exacerba-
tions [27, 28]. The difference in exacerbation
trends, which was sustained over 12 months
according to the Kaplan–Meier analysis, sug-
gests that patients using the AC?FV AVHC may
experience better and sustained outcomes than
those using a control VHC type. Since exacer-
bations are acute events which often require
unscheduled
healthcare
resource
utilization,
the utilization of ED following treatment initi-
ation can be used as a surrogate marker for
assessing the effect of treatment on the occur-
rence
of
exacerbations
[29].
Our
analysis
demonstrated that the rate of ED visits per
patient in the AC?FV AVHC group was signifi-
cantly lower than that in the control VHC
group in the follow-up. This finding supports
the additional study observation that exacer-
bation events in the AC?FV AVHC group were
consistently lower than in the control VHC
group in real-world data. The lower occurrence
of asthma-related ED visits observed in the
AC?FV AVHC group may lead to an expectation
that
the
proportion
of
patients
with
an
asthma-related hospitalization would also be
smaller in the AC?FV AVHC group compared to
the control group. Nonetheless, despite the
slightly lower proportion observed (3.0% vs.
3.7%), the differences did not reach a statisti-
cally significant level.
Exacerbations
are
associated
with
high
healthcare resource use and consequently the
high economic burden of asthma [29]. An
administrative claims database study found that
patients with exacerbations had a mean per
patient healthcare cost of $4212 more than
those without an exacerbation [20]. Therefore,
controlling exacerbations is important. No sig-
nificant differences in the cost associated with a
moderate-to-severe exacerbation were observed
between AC?FV AVHC patients and control
VHC patients when the mean costs were com-
pared. This could be partly the result of the high
degree of skewness in the cost data. Our alter-
native analysis using the regression model in
the unmatched cohorts, adjusting for potential
confounders and addressing the issues of out-
liers
and
heavy-tailed
cost
data,
however,
showed statistically significantly lower exacer-
bation-related costs associated with the AC?FV
AVHC compared to the control VHC at 30 days,
6 months,
9 months,
and
12 months.
This
finding suggests that the AC?FV AVHC may
well
help
reduce
exacerbation-related
costs
when compared to control VHCs.
As mentioned in the ‘‘Introduction,’’ there
are
laboratory
studies
which
support
the
hypothesis that, in a real-world setting, medi-
cation delivery via an antistatic VHC would be
closer to optimal and more consistent than
delivery via a non-antistatic VHC. Our study
Pulm Ther (2017) 3:283–296
293
 appears to provide some real-world validation
of that hypothesis in terms of asthma control;
however, we recognize that the presence of the
inhalation feedback indicator in the AC?FV
AVHC
may
also
have
contributed
to
the
observed outcome differences.
There are inherent limitations to the use of
secondary data and observational study meth-
ods that should be considered when interpret-
ing results. The adjudicated claims database
does not report clinical disease information
(e.g., lung function, symptoms, etc.) and it was
not
possible
to
define
severity
by
clinical
markers; patients were diagnosed using ICD
codes created for billing. Training for the proper
use of the device from providers as well as
adherence
to
device
use
is
important
for
attaining benefits from devices; however, this
information was not available in our database.
The database contains commercially insured
patients and our findings may not be general-
izable to the Medicare or Medicaid population.
There are, however, several strengths of our
study. Since the QuintilesIMS Real-World Data
Adjudicated Claims Database is representative
of the US commercially insured population, the
results from our study are generalizable to the
commercially insured US population. The cost
and utilization analyses performed in our study
involved
fully
adjudicated
claims
data
on
healthcare services (hospitalizations, ED, out-
patient, pharmacy, and other services) and all
associated costs. The study also employed PS
matching, which addressed the issue of multi-
collinearity
in
observational
studies,
since
covariates may be highly correlated (e.g., age
and comorbidities).
CONCLUSIONS
The AeroChamber Plus� Flow Vu� Antistatic
VHC was associated with delayed time to first
exacerbation, a lower occurrence of asthma-re-
lated ED visits, and lower exacerbation-related
costs when compared to control non-antistatic
VHCs. Exacerbation rates also trended lower for
the AC?FV AVHC throughout the 12-month
study period. Findings from our study therefore
suggest that the use of the AC?FV AVHC in
association with a pMDI may result in better
asthma
control
compared
to
the
use
of
non-antistatic VHCs.
