Risks and benefits of direct oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in 
a real world setting: cohort study in primary care
Yana Vinogradova,1 Carol Coupland,1 Trevor Hill,1 Julia Hippisley-Cox1
AbstrAct
Objective
To investigate the associations between direct 
oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and risks of bleeding, 
ischaemic stroke, venous thromboembolism, and all 
cause mortality compared with warfarin.
Design
Prospective open cohort study.
setting
UK general practices contributing to QResearch or 
Clinical Practice Research Datalink.
ParticiPants
132 231 warfarin, 7744 dabigatran, 37 863 
rivaroxaban, and 18 223 apixaban users without 
anticoagulant prescriptions for 12 months before 
study entry, subgrouped into 103 270 patients with 
atrial fibrillation and 92 791 without atrial fibrillation 
between 2011 and 2016.
Main OutcOMe Measures
Major bleeding leading to hospital admission or 
death. Specific sites of bleeding and all cause 
mortality were also studied.
results
In patients with atrial fibrillation, compared 
with warfarin, apixaban was associated with a 
decreased risk of major bleeding (adjusted hazard 
ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 0.79) 
and intracranial bleeding (0.40, 0.25 to 0.64); 
dabigatran was associated with a decreased risk 
of intracranial bleeding (0.45, 0.26 to 0.77). An 
increased risk of all cause mortality was observed 
in patients taking rivaroxaban (1.19, 1.09 to 1.29) 
or on lower doses of apixaban (1.27, 1.12 to 1.45). 
In patients without atrial fibrillation, compared with 
warfarin, apixaban was associated with a decreased 
risk of major bleeding (0.60, 0.46 to 0.79), any 
gastrointestinal bleeding (0.55, 0.37 to 0.83), and 
upper gastrointestinal bleeding (0.55, 0.36 to 0.83); 
rivaroxaban was associated with a decreased risk of 
intracranial bleeding (0.54, 0.35 to 0.82). Increased 
risk of all cause mortality was observed in patients 
taking rivaroxaban (1.51, 1.38 to 1.66) and those on 
lower doses of apixaban (1.34, 1.13 to 1.58).
cOnclusiOns
Overall, apixaban was found to be the safest drug, 
with reduced risks of major, intracranial, and 
gastrointestinal bleeding compared with warfarin. 
Rivaroxaban and low dose apixaban were, however, 
associated with increased risks of all cause mortality 
compared with warfarin.
Introduction
Anticoagulants are used for the prevention and 
treatment of venous thromboembolism and to 
reduce the risk of stroke in patients with either atrial 
fibrillation or after acute pulmonary embolism, deep 
vein thrombosis, or hip or knee replacement surgery.1-4 
Warfarin has been used for six decades but in the last 
eight years its use has been gradually replaced by a 
new class of direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) 
including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban. 
Unlike warfarin, these drugs have set doses and do not 
generally require regular international normalisation 
ratio blood test monitoring.5 They also have faster onset 
and offset of action. There are, however, some concerns 
regarding the safety of DOACs with respect to bleeding 
because there is an absence of or a limited choice of 
antidotes, some of which are also expensive.6 7
Atrial fibrillation is the most common condition 
requiring anticoagulants, and most clinical trial 
evidence has been based on this group of patients. 
These trials have established non-inferiority in the 
anticoagulating qualities of DOACs compared with 
warfarin in controlled trial settings,8-10 but there are 
residual concerns regarding their safety, particularly 
in more real world settings, where they are prescribed 
to a broad range of patients. A recent meta-analysis 
has shown that apixaban has advantages over 
warfarin, providing a better balance between efficacy 
and safety.11 The included studies were differently 
designed, and none provided data for all DOACs. 
These findings, therefore, represent only indirect 
comparisons between different types of DOACs, derived 
using network meta-analysis techniques.
Most well powered observational studies have also 
focused on patients with atrial fibrillation.12-25 Only 
two have provided data for the wider population,13 15

and only one of these presented results for the 
group without atrial fibrillation.13 Both studies were 
based on data from commercially insured patients, 
containing billing information, and were conducted 
a few years ago, when warfarin was more commonly 
prescribed. Our study aims, for all incident users of 
anticoagulants, to compare the risks (major bleeding 
and mortality) and benefits (reduced ischaemic stroke 
and venous thromboembolism) associated with the 
three commonest types of DOACs compared with 
warfarin. We provide separate results for the group 
with atrial fibrillation and for the group prescribed the 
drugs because of other conditions.
Methods
Data sources
We used two UK primary care databases QResearch 
and Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). 
Each is representative of the national population in 
terms of the number of practices and of patients that 
contribute.26 Both have been widely validated against 
other sources of information and used in a wide range 
of clinical studies.27 All 1457 QResearch (version 42) 
and 357 CPRD (November 2016) practices were linked 
at the patient level to hospital admissions data, which 
provided dates and diagnoses for hospital stays.28 
These practices were also linked to mortality data 
supplied by the Office for National Statistics, which 
include diagnoses and dates of death. Most patients 
in linked practices also had information on their level 
of deprivation based on quintiles of Townsend score 
and provided by Census 2011.29 We used READ codes 
to extract the information from general practices and 
ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th 
revision) codes for Hospital Episode Statistics and 
Office for National Statistics data (see supplementary 
table 1).
study design
We used a new-user design to capture all events 
occurring after starting treatment and to reduce the 
impact of confounding.30 For a study period from 
January 2011 to the latest date of Hospital Episode 
Statistics linked data (October 2016 for QResearch and 
March 2016 for CPRD), patients prescribed the oral 
anticoagulants warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and 
apixaban, and aged from 21 to 99 at study entry date, 
formed the cohort. The entry date was defined as the 
date of the first prescription of any of the anticoagulant 
drugs. To facilitate a direct comparison between new 
users of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) against 
new users of warfarin, and to reduce the impact of 
indication bias, patients were excluded if they had 
any anticoagulant prescription in the last 12 months 
before the entry date. To ensure the quality of data, 
patients were also excluded if they had either fewer 
than 12 months of records before entry or had no valid 
Townsend score.
Patients were followed from their first prescription 
of an anticoagulant until they experienced an outcome 
of interest or were censored. Patients were censored 
when: they stopped or suspended treatment (at 30 
days after the expected end date of any prescription, 
where the gap between the expected prescription end 
date and the start date of any subsequent prescription 
was more than 30 days); they switched treatment (at 
the day before the prescription start for a different 
anticoagulant); they left a practice (at the day of 
deregistration); they died; or the study period ended. 
For the analyses of dosages, we also censored patients 
when they changed to a different dose.
Outcomes
To assess the scale of unintended adverse events of 
anticoagulant treatment, the primary outcome was 
major bleeding after entry to the study which led 
to a hospital admission or death, based on linked 
hospital or mortality records. The first occurrence was 
used in the analyses of specific outcomes including 
intracranial bleed, haematuria, haemoptysis, and 
gastrointestinal bleed (also separated into upper and 
lower, where recorded), because these were identified 
as possibly preventable and potentially life threatening 
or life changing.
To assess the efficacy of anticoagulant treatments, 
the following secondary outcomes were considered: 
ischaemic stroke, venous thromboembolism, and all 
cause mortality. The outcome date was the earliest 
record after entry to the study from GP, hospital, and 
mortality data records. These analyses were focused 
on primary prevention so patients having venous 
thromboembolism events before entry to the study 
were excluded from the analysis of the risk of venous 
thromboembolism. Similarly, patients with previous 
ischaemic strokes were excluded from the analysis of 
the risk of ischaemic stroke.
exposure to anticoagulants
Three DOACs – dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban 
– were compared with warfarin. Edoxaban was not 
included because it was licensed in the UK at the end 
of 2015. Acenocoumarol and phenindione were not 
included because they have been rarely prescribed in 
the UK.
Extracted data for anticoagulant prescriptions 
contained the preparation details, number of days, 
and number of tablets per day. The daily dose was 
averaged for each prescription and categorised as 
lower or higher than the recommended daily dose: 300 
mg for dabigatran, 20 mg for rivaroxaban, and 10 mg 
for apixaban. In the subcohort with atrial fibrillation, 
higher dose corresponds to standard dose. Precise 
dosages for warfarin were not available because they 
vary according to international normalisation ratio 
measurement and are not consistently recorded in 
general practice.
confounding factors
It is possible that patients at higher risk of bleeding 
may preferentially be prescribed DOACs rather 
than warfarin, so all analyses were adjusted for 
demographic and clinical variables, either because

they may have been used as indicators for prescribing 
a specific anticoagulant or because they have possible 
associations with increased risk of bleeding, ischaemic 
stroke, or venous thromboembolism. We similarly 
adjusted for comorbidities, previous events, and drugs 
also used as indicators or associated with increased 
risks.31 The covariates were assessed at the date when 
the anticoagulant was first prescribed.
Demographic and lifestyle variables, included 
because they affect the risk of bleeding, ischaemic 
stroke, or venous thromboembolism, were: sex; age at 
entry to the study;32 self assigned ethnicity; smoking 
status; alcohol use;33 and deprivation.32 34 Body mass 
index and systolic blood pressure were included for the 
same reason.
Comorbidities included if recorded before the drug 
start were: alcohol dependence; bleeding disorders; 
cancer (the 12 most commonly occurring types); 
chronic liver disease or pancreatitis;33 chronic 
obstructive 
pulmonary 
disease; 
chronic 
renal 
disease;33 congestive cardiac failure; coronary heart 
disease; diabetes; dyspepsia or heartburn; treated 
hypertension;33 previous ischaemic stroke or transient 
ischaemic attack; oesophageal varices; peptic ulcer; 
valvular heart disease; venous thromboembolism; and 
previous bleed (including intracranial, haematuria, 
haemoptysis, or gastrointestinal). If recorded in the 
six months before the start of anticoagulant treatment, 
falls or hip fractures and hip or knee replacement 
operations were both included in the analysis.
Recent and concurrent drug use, included in the 
analysis because they may affect the risk of bleeding 
or interact with anticoagulants, were: proton pump 
inhibitors; 
macrolide 
antibiotics; 
antiplatelets;33 
antidepressants;35 anticonvulsants (phenytoin or 
carbamazepine); 
non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory 
drugs; corticosteroids; and statins. For women, 
hormonal treatments, which included hormone 
replacement therapy and oral contraceptives, were 
also added to the analysis of venous thromboembolism 
outcome because they may increase the risk of venous 
thromboembolism.
Finally, year of entry to the study was included as a 
confounder both because of changes in recorded rates of 
outcomes over the study period and because the balance 
of prescribing between the different anticoagulants 
was also changing. Specifically, rates of bleeding, 
ischaemic stroke, and venous thromboembolism were 
changing in the general population and, while at the 
beginning of the study warfarin was overwhelmingly 
the most common anticoagulant prescription, by the 
end of the study combined prescription rates for DOACs 
were considerably higher than for warfarin.
statistical analysis
The baseline characteristics for each group of patients 
and anticoagulant of interest were described as 
percentages, means (SD), or medians (interquartile 
ranges). Incidence rates for each outcome were 
calculated based on the numbers with the outcome 
and the person years of follow-up, and were age and 
sex standardised for each drug. To estimate the risks 
associated with each DOAC, an outcome specific Cox 
model containing all confounding factors was used, 
with warfarin as a primary reference. To quantify 
differences between apixaban and other DOACs 
an additional analysis was run with apixaban as a 
reference.
To account for a log-normal distribution, logarithm 
of body mass index was used. Age was included using 
fractional polynomials. Patients with missing ethnicity 
data were included in the white category. To assess 
the validity of this assumption, a sensitivity analysis 
was run for ethnicity where the missing values were 
included as a separate category. Missing values for body 
mass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, 
and systolic blood pressure were assumed as missing 
at random and imputed using chained equations.36 We 
used an outcome specific imputation model including 
outcome, length of follow-up, all confounders, 
anticoagulant type, and prescribed dose. Where 
possible, depending on numbers, we pooled the results 
obtained from QResearch and CPRD using a fixed 
effect model with inverse variance weights. Where 
any heterogeneity was detected, the results were 
combined using a random effect model.37 Because 
the CPRD sample was relatively small, not every 
outcome in the more disaggregated analyses yielded 
a sufficient number of events. This mainly occurred 
for the subcohort of patients without atrial fibrillation 
and in the dosage analyses. In these cases, results from 
QResearch alone were reported.
We carried out analyses for the cohort of all patients 
who started anticoagulants in the study period, with 
additional separate analyses for a subcohort with atrial 
fibrillation and the remaining subcohort with other 
indications for anticoagulant prescription. The main 
results presented are those for the two subcohorts 
separately, with the findings for the pooled cohort 
presented as supplementary material.
To estimate the absolute magnitude of risks 
associated with different DOACs when compared with 
warfarin, we calculated numbers needed to treat or 
harm using the adjusted hazard ratios and baseline 
rates for warfarin.38 Baseline rates were estimated 
by weighting rates from QResearch and CPRD. We 
calculated the numbers for 6, 12, 18, and 24 months 
after treatment commenced.
In addition to the sensitivity analysis for ethnicity 
described previously, three further sensitivity analyses 
were run. Being admitted to hospital for bleeding, 
ischaemic stroke, or venous thromboembolism may 
result in a switch of anticoagulant used without any 
subsequent GP records of the change. So patients who 
were admitted to hospital for one of these outcomes 
were censored at the time of the hospital stay in the 
analysis of other outcomes in a second sensitivity 
analysis. To assess the validity of the assumption that 
missing data were missing at random, a third sensitivity 
analysis was run only on patients with complete data.
The fourth sensitivity analysis, using propensity 
score weighting,39 was run on the subcohort with

complete data. This approach has been used previously 
for studying DOACs in comparison with warfarin.40 
Three separate propensity scores were developed. The 
first to predict the use of dabigatran among dabigatran 
and warfarin users. The second to predict use of 
rivaroxaban among rivaroxaban and warfarin users. 
The third to predict use of apixaban among apixaban 
and warfarin users. All available variables described as 
confounding factors were included in the development 
of the propensity scores. Patients with propensity 
scores from non-overlapping regions were excluded 
from the relevant analysis. Three separate Cox models 
were then run, where the use of each DOAC in turn was 
adjusted for the relevant propensity score.
Patient involvement
Patient representatives from the QResearch Advisory 
Board wrote the information for patients on the 
QResearch website about the use of the database for 
research. Patients were not involved in setting the 
research question, the outcome measures, the design, 
or implementation of this study. Lay people and patient 
representatives were involved in writing and approving 
the lay summaries during the bid process. The patient 
representative in the publication review process 
expressed appreciation of the real world nature of the 
study, highlighting the usefulness of such studies for 
informing doctor-patient discussions.
results
cohort characteristics
Figure 1 shows that 156 005 patients from QResearch 
and 40 056 from Clinical Practice Research Datalink 
(CPRD), who started or restarted anticoagulants 
(after more than a 12 month gap) between 2011 and 
2016, were eligible for inclusion. Overall, 53% were 
diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (81 251 in QResearch 
and 22 019 in CPRD) leaving 47% of patients 
prescribed 
anticoagulants 
for 
other 
indications 
(74 754 in QResearch and 18 037 in CPRD).
In the subcohort with atrial fibrillation, across the 
databases, there were 70 585 (68%) patients taking 
warfarin, 5537 (5%) taking dabigatran, 16 547 (16%) 
taking rivaroxaban, and 10 601 (10%) taking apixaban. 
In the subcohort without atrial fibrillation, there were 
61 646 (66%) taking warfarin, 2207 (2%) taking 
dabigatran, 21 316 (23%) taking rivaroxaban, and 7622 
(8%) taking apixaban. Figure 2 and supplementary

table 2 show that although overall 67% of patients 
were prescribed warfarin, its use declined during the 
study period over both databases from 98% in 2011 
to 23% in 2016. DOAC use had risen, from 1% to 42% 
for rivaroxaban and from 0% to 31% for apixaban. 
Dabigatran reached a peak in 2013 (10%) but dropped 
to 3% in 2016. This pattern was similar for patients with 
atrial fibrillation and without atrial fibrillation.
Table 1 and supplementary table 3 show the 
characteristics of patients with atrial fibrillation by 
database. Table 2 and supplementary table 4 show the 
characteristics of patients without atrial fibrillation by 
database. The tables show the consistency between the 
cohorts from the two databases apart from the slightly 
shorter exposure period in CPRD because of the shorter 
study inclusion period. Patients were exposed to 
warfarin for longer than to direct oral anticoagulants 
(DOACs) in both subcohorts, with a median exposure 
of 11 months in QResearch (9 months in CPRD) for the 
atrial fibrillation subcohort and six months (in both 
databases) for the subcohort without atrial fibrillation. 
In comparison, the DOACs had median duration of 
nine months in QResearch (five months in CPRD) for 
the atrial fibrillation subcohort, and three months in 
both QResearch and CPRD for the subcohort without 
atrial fibrillation.
Table 1 and table 2 show that across both databases, 
patients with atrial fibrillation were older than patients 
without atrial fibrillation (mean age 75 v 66), had more 
age related comorbidities, and used more related drugs. 
More patients in the subcohort with atrial fibrillation 
than in the subcohort without atrial fibrillation had 
heart related diseases such as congestive cardiac failure 
(13% v 7%), coronary heart disease (25% v 17%), 
treated hypertension (62% v 42%), diabetes (19% v 
15%), and previous ischaemic stroke (19% v 13%); a 
much lower proportion had venous thromboembolism 
(6% v 50%). The proportion of patients diagnosed with 
cancer, was slightly higher in the subcohort without 
atrial fibrillation (13.4%) than in the subcohort with 
atrial fibrillation (12.4%) in both databases.
In the subcohort with atrial fibrillation, patients 
prescribed different anticoagulants were of similar age 
(with means ranging between 74.4 and 76.6), but in 
the subcohort without atrial fibrillation, patients on 
warfarin were the youngest (overall mean 66.5) and 
patients on apixaban were the oldest (overall mean 
74.0). Across both databases and both subcohorts, 
the proportion of patients with chronic renal disease 
was highest in the warfarin group (2.9%) and among 
the patients using DOACs was highest in the apixaban 
groups (on average 2.2%). Proportions of patients 
in the different ethnic, smoking status, and alcohol 
consumption categories, and quintiles of Townsend 
deprivation scores were broadly similar across 
subcohorts, types of anticoagulants, and databases 
(see supplementary tables 3 and 4).
incidence rates
Table 3 and table 4 show follow-up time and the 
number of events for subcohorts with and without 
atrial fibrillation respectively. Supplementary table 
5 shows the data for all patients. The rates of major 
bleeding in the warfarin groups varied between 25.1 
and 35.2 per 1000 person years. In warfarin users, the 
rates for gastrointestinal bleeding were higher in CPRD 
in both subcohorts.
In the subcohort without atrial fibrillation, the 
rates of different bleeds were generally slightly lower 
in QResearch than CPRD, although the number of 
events were too low for comparison. In the subcohort 
without atrial fibrillation in both QResearch and CPRD, 
the highest rates of venous thromboembolism were in 
patients taking rivaroxaban (180 and 240 per 1000 
person years, respectively).
Table 3 and table 4 show that the mortality rates 
were consistently higher in patients without atrial 
fibrillation (from 58 to 87 per 1000 person years 
in QResearch and from 57 to 108 in CPRD) than in 
patients with atrial fibrillation (43 to 55 in QResearch 
and 42 to 62 in CPRD).
Overall, there was good consistency between 
the databases. For 120 combinations of subgroup, 
outcome, and drug, there were only eight combinations 
where rate pairs differed by more than 1 per 100 
person years.
associations with anticoagulant exposure

fibrillation and figure 4 shows the results for patients 
without atrial fibrillation, with reference to warfarin. 
Figure 5 shows the results for both groups with 
reference to apixaban. Supplementary tables 5-7 show 
the adjusted hazard ratios in each of the two databases. 
Hazard ratios were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, 
smoking, alcohol, Townsend quintile, body mass 
index, systolic blood pressure, falls and hip fracture, 
hip or knee operations, comorbidities (alcoholism, 
atrial fibrillation, treated hypertension, chronic kidney

cardiac failure, any cancer, or valvular peptic ulcer), 
previous events (bleed, venous thromboembolism, or 
ischaemic stroke), drugs at the baseline (macrolides, 
antiplatelets, anticonvulsant, corticosteroids, NSAIDs, 
statins, or hormones), and study year.
In patients with atrial fibrillation, apixaban was 
associated with a lower risk of major bleed than 
warfarin (adjusted hazard ratio 0.66, 95% confidence 
interval 0.54 to 0.79) (fig 3) and rivaroxaban (fig 5). 
Dabigatran (0.45, 0.26 to 0.77) and apixaban (0.40, 
0.25 to 0.64) were associated with lower risks of

intracranial bleed than warfarin, and rivaroxaban 
was associated with a higher risk compared to 
apixaban (1.94, 1.19 to 3.16). Although no drugs were 
significantly different from warfarin in risks of any 
other bleeding events, rivaroxaban was associated with 
higher risks compared with apixaban for haematuria, 
all gastrointestinal bleed and upper gastrointestinal 
bleed (fig 3 and fig 5).
In the subcohort without atrial fibrillation, apixaban 
was associated with lower risks of major bleed 
(adjusted hazard ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 
0.46 to 0.79) than warfarin (fig 4) or rivaroxaban

(fig 5). Rivaroxaban was associated with a lower risk 
of intracranial bleed (0.54, 0.35 to 0.82) compared 
with warfarin, and apixaban with lower risks of 
all gastrointestinal (0.55, 0.37 to 0.83) and upper 
gastrointestinal bleeds (0.55, 0.36 to 0.83). Dabigatran 
and rivaroxaban were associated with higher risks for 
all gastrointestinal bleeds compared with apixaban, 
rivaroxaban was also associated with a higher risk for 
upper gastrointestinal bleed (fig 5).
The risk of primary ischaemic stroke did not differ 
between any of the anticoagulants studied in either 
subcohort. Figure 4 shows that the risk of primary 
venous thromboembolism in patients with atrial 
fibrillation was not different between any drugs, but

in the subcohort without atrial fibrillation compared 
with warfarin there was a higher risk in patients 
taking rivaroxaban (adjusted hazard ratio 1.49, 95% 
confidence interval 1.33 to 1.68) and lower risks in 
patients taking dabigatran (0.25, 0.15 to 0.41) and 
apixaban (0.42, 0.33 to 0.53).
For both patients with atrial fibrillation (adjusted 
hazard ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 
1.29) and without atrial fibrillation (1.51, 1.38 to 
1.66), the risk of mortality was increased in patients 
taking rivaroxaban compared with warfarin. Although

higher than unity (1.13, 1.01 to 1.26 for patients 
with atrial fibrillation; 1.16, 1.02 to 1.33 for patients 
without atrial fibrillation) and neither of them were 
statistically significant (at P<0.01), the estimate for 
the whole cohort was (adjusted hazard ratio 1.14, 
95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.24, P=0.001) (see 
supplementary figure 1 and supplementary table 
5). Supplementary table 8 shows that most of these 
deaths were owing to causes other than bleeding, 
ischaemic stroke, or venous thromboembolism (91% 
in QResearch and 88% in CPRD).
numbers needed to harm and treat
Table 5 shows the number needed to treat or number 
needed to harm to measure the relative benefits or risks 
of DOACs in comparison with warfarin. In the subcohort 
with atrial fibrillation, over six months, the lowest 
number needed to treat (to avoid one extra major bleed) 
was for apixaban (182, 95% confidence interval 137 to 
299). The lowest number needed to harm (to observe one 
extra death) over six months was for rivaroxaban (202, 
131 to 410). In the subcohort without atrial fibrillation, 
over six months, the lowest number needed to treat to 
avoid one extra major bleed was also for apixaban (138, 
102 to 207). The lowest number needed to harm for 
deaths was again for rivaroxaban (61, 47 to 82).
Dose analysis
Overall, patients on lower doses of DOACs were older, 
had more comorbidities, previous events, and other 
drugs than patients on higher doses (see supplementary 
tables 9 and 10). In the subcohort with atrial fibrillation, 
patients on lower doses were on average 10 years older 
(mean 83 years v 73 across the databases), more likely to 
be women (58% v 41%), more likely to be non-drinkers 
(42% v 30%), more likely to have lower body mass index 
(mean 27 kg/m2v 29 kg/m2), and more likely to have age 
associated morbidities, including hypertension (67% v 
57%), congestive cardiac failure (17% v 10%), coronary 
heart disease (29% v 20%), valvular heart disease (12% 
v 8%), and chronic renal disease (4% v 1%). Patients on 
lower doses were also more likely to have had falls or hip 
fracture (12% v 6%) (see supplementary tables 9 and 10).
In the subcohort without atrial fibrillation, patients 
on lower doses of DOACs were on average 7 years older 
(mean 75 years v 68 across the databases), more likely to 
be women (59% v 48%), more likely to be non-drinkers 
(40% v 34%), and more likely to have age associated 
comorbidities, with diagnoses of hypertension (52% v 
41%), congestive cardiac failure (9% v 5%), coronary 
heart disease (20% v 15%), valvular heart disease (7% v 
4%), and chronic renal disease (3% v 1%) than patients 
on higher doses. Patients on lower doses were also

more likely to have had falls or hip fracture (16% v 5%), 
hip or knee replacement operations (22% v 3%), and 
previous ischaemic stroke (18% v 13%). The proportion 
of patients with previous venous thromboembolism was 
lower than in the higher dose group (15% v 38%) (see 
supplementary tables 9 and 10).
Age-sex standardised rates for patients on lower 
and higher doses and adjusted hazard ratios with 
reference to warfarin are shown for the subcohort with 
atrial fibrillation in supplementary table 11 and for the 
subcohort without atrial fibrillation in supplementary 
table 12. Although higher doses were mainly associated 
with lower risks than lower doses, the confidence 
intervals for the adjusted hazard ratios overlapped for 
most outcomes and drugs (see fig 3 for patients with atrial 
fibrillation, fig 4 for patients without atrial fibrillation, 
and supplementary table 13 with supplementary figure 
1 for all patients). In patients with atrial fibrillation, only 
low doses of rivaroxaban (adjusted hazard ratios of 1.29, 
95% confidence interval 1.14 to 1.47) and apixaban 
(1.27, 1.12 to 1.45) were associated with an increased 
risk of mortality. In patients without atrial fibrillation, 
however, both low and high doses of rivaroxaban were 
associated with increased risks while for apixaban only 
low doses were associated with increased risk of mortality 
(1.34, 1.13 to 1.58).
sensitivity analyses
Analyses for ethnicity, where unrecorded values were 
included as a separate category, also obtained very 
similar results. Reanalysis of the whole cohort, but with 
patients censored if admitted to hospital for bleeding, 
ischaemic stroke, or venous thromboembolism, gave 
results which were very similar to the main analysis 
for all outcomes (see supplementary table 14). Results 
from the complete case analysis were comparable 
to the main analysis (see supplementary table 15). 
Analyses adjusted with propensity scores also resulted 
in similar hazard ratios compared with the complete 
case analysis (see supplementary table 15).
discussion
Our study, based on routinely collected care data, 
showed a decreased risk of major bleeding events 
associated with the use of apixaban compared with 
warfarin in both patients with atrial fibrillation and 
without atrial fibrillation. Similarly, in patients with 
atrial fibrillation, a lower risk of intracranial bleed 
was associated with dabigatran and apixaban. In 
patients without atrial fibrillation, use of rivaroxaban 
was associated with a lower risk of intracranial bleed 
and apixaban was associated with lower risks of any 
gastrointestinal bleed and upper gastrointestinal

without atrial fibrillation, rivaroxaban and lower doses 
of apixaban were associated with an increased risk of 
all cause mortality compared with warfarin.
strengths and weaknesses of this study
The study, using the two largest primary care databases 
in the UK to deliver high statistical power, contributes 
to the evidence from other major studies. The general 
practice records were linked to hospital and mortality 
data, so all recorded outcomes were identified. 
Consistency in records of comorbidities, lifestyle, 
and prescribing across the databases also facilitated 
the combination of results from each, so delivering 
narrower confidence intervals for our estimations.
An important limitation for our study and all earlier 
observational studies is the lack of information on 
patient adherence to their prescribed drugs, which 
may lead to possible misclassifications of exposure. 
It is not known when exactly a patient stopped taking 
anticoagulants, and our setting of 30 days as a period 
during which they could still have been exposed was 
selected primarily to make our study consistent with 
– and therefore comparable to – previous research. 
Warfarin has been shown to have the highest non-
persistence and apixaban and rivaroxaban the 
lowest.41 A study based on routinely collected data 
has shown that adding international normalisation 
ratio information, which we could not use directly 
because of inconsistent recording, could increase 
the estimate of exposure to vitamin K antagonists by 
13% to 18% over 12 months.42 In our sample, the 
median duration of exposure to warfarin was less 
than a year, so our addition of 30 days to exposure 
will to some extent have compensated for this lack of 
information regarding warfarin exposure. However, 
despite the addition of this 30 day grace period to each 
anticoagulant course, there is still uncertainty about 
precise periods of exposure.
The effect of non-adherence on bleeding rates has 
also been shown using commercial insurance data and 
non-adherence is likely to have contributed to various 
extents to underestimation of the efficacy of any of the 
drugs in our study with respect to the prevention of 
ischaemic stroke or venous thromboembolism.43 With 
respect to mortality outcomes, a greater proportion of 
the older patients on apixaban and rivaroxaban may 
have died while still taking anticoagulants, but from age

related causes other than ischaemic stroke or venous 
thromboembolism. We decided to adjust for a diagnosis 
of chronic kidney disease in the analysis rather than 
undertake a detailed analysis of renal function through 
the analysis of individual blood tests. A reduced dose 
of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) is recommended in 
patients with renal impairment as well as for patients 
aged over 80 and under 60 kg and there were more 
patients diagnosed with chronic renal disease in all 
lower dose DOAC groups, particularly in the apixaban 
and rivaroxaban groups. We adjusted for renal disease 
and for age and body mass index, but renal disease and 
use of anticoagulants may still contribute to mortality 
rate and this needs further research.44
An increased risk of bleeding in patients taking 
warfarin compared to those taking a DOAC could be 
because of the regular monitoring required for warfarin 
users. Bleeds could be more likely to be detected in 
these patients than in those taking DOACs, introducing 
a surveillance bias. Our definition of the outcome as 
any bleed requiring admission to hospital or causing 
death makes it less likely that these would be missed 
in the patients taking DOACs. However, a minor bleed 
detected in warfarin users could have been treated 
before it developed into a more serious one.
Included patients had different indications for 
anticoagulation and the DOAC groups were generally 
older and less healthy than the comparator warfarin 
group. Extensive adjustment for confounders, however, 
should have helped to reduce possible indication bias.
Exposure in our study was based only on GP records, 
without information from other possible sources of 
anticoagulants such as anticoagulant clinics or hospital 
stays. A small proportion of patients might have had 
private health insurance with prescriptions not available 
on the GP records. In the UK, however, the overwhelming 
proportion of events included as outcomes in this 
study would not be treated using private medical care. 
There is also some uncertainty surrounding venous 
thromboembolism diagnoses in QResearch and Clinical 
Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) cohorts because 
the results of diagnostic tests are not available to 
researchers in primary care records. This might lead to a 
misclassification of the outcome and a slightly increased 
rate of venous thromboembolism. It may, however, 
happen to patients taking any anticoagulant and we 
are not aware of any systematic differences between the 
prescribing of these drugs, but we accept a possible shift 
in results towards unity. The findings regarding risk of 
venous thromboembolism associated with different 
anticoagulants should, however, be interpreted with 
caution.
These uncertainties could have affected our results 
in several ways. We may have included some patients 
who had had exposure to anticoagulants in the 12 
months before their entry. Included patients admitted 
to hospital for bleeding events might also have stopped 
anticoagulant therapy and then suffered an ischaemic 
stroke, developed venous thromboembolism, or died, 
so causing their misclassification as anticoagulant 
users. Our sensitivity analysis censoring such 
patients did not, however, require alterations to our 
conclusions. We also lacked information about over-
the-counter purchases of other drugs such as a non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or aspirin, but this is 
likely to have affected only a small number of patients.
Between QResearch and CPRD most of the results 
were consistent, but there were a few differences in rates 
and hazard ratios. This is not unexpected, partly owing 
to small numbers for some comparisons and because 
contributing practices for the two databases not only 
use different computer systems for data collection but 
also have somewhat different profiles in terms of their 
location within different geographical regions.45

This is an observational study with high quality 
information on which drugs have been prescribed, the 
dates and duration. However, limitations include lack 
of information on adherence and all the indications 
for prescribing. Although many adjustments have 
been done using the data available on the existing 
databases, there is a possibility of unmeasured 
confounding or confounding by indication. Routinely 
collected data are also not always consistently 
recorded and information stored in free text format 
is not extracted from the GP systems. Only available, 
consistently recorded variables can be used in such 
studies, which always creates the possibility of some 
residual confounding.
strengths and weaknesses in relation to other 
studies
Incidence rates of outcomes in general for patients 
taking anticoagulants depend on a number of study 
design factors. One is inclusion criteria, with incidence 
rates being lower for cohorts excluding patients with 
previous events. Another, the duration of the grace 
period after a prescription ends but when the patient is 
still considered exposed, may result in incidence rates 
being lower in studies with a shorter grace period. 
Grace periods were not consistent across the studies, 
ranging from three to 30 days, with studies in Denmark 
assuming continuous treatment.18 22 Our rates were 
much higher than the rates from the Danish studies 
and from studies using US insurance data.12 15 16 20
This was a large comprehensive study using the 
most recent data, so one of the study strengths is its 
representativeness in terms of new users (or restarters) 
of anticoagulant drugs. All data were routinely 
collected and included not only comorbidities and 
any drugs but information on lifestyle factors such as 
smoking and alcohol – not commonly used in previous 
studies.12 15 17 18 21 22
Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common 
indications for anticoagulant prescribing, so almost all 
observational studies provide evidence for this restricted 
group. Approximately the same numbers of patients 
without atrial fibrillation are, however, also prescribed 
anticoagulants, creating a gap in knowledge about the 
effects of these drugs. Such patients are different in their 
comorbidities and indications for prescribing, so the 
risks of ischaemic stroke, venous thromboembolism, 
and mortality are unlikely to be the same.
It is difficult to discern the precise indications for 
anticoagulation. Not every patient diagnosed with 
atrial fibrillation is prescribed anticoagulants.46 Some 
patients in the atrial fibrillation subcohort also had 
hip fractures or operations which could have required 
anticoagulation. We believe that our findings for all 
anticoagulant users, although presented separately for 
patients with and without atrial fibrillation, provide 
more generalisable evidence than findings based only 
on the subset of patients with atrial fibrillation. For 
patients without atrial fibrillation, however, presenting 
aggregated results can only highlight overall risks 
associated with DOAC drugs without being able to be 
more specific about underlying associations between 
different drugs and different conditions.
To facilitate comparison with other studies, our 
study offers analyses separately for patients with 
atrial fibrillation and without atrial fibrillation, and for 
patients on different DOAC doses. Although we used a 
proportional hazard model adjusting for all available 
confounding factors, we also undertook a sensitivity 
analysis using the propensity score method and 
obtained very similar results.
important similarities and differences in results
Although patients with valvular heart disease were 
excluded from some trials and observational studies 
for patients with atrial fibrillation, a meta-analysis 
has shown that DOAC risks compared with warfarin 
for bleeding, ischaemic stroke, or systemic embolism 
and for death were similar for patients with atrial 
fibrillation with or without valvular heart disease.47 
For the main outcome of major bleeding, results from 
our study for the subcohort with atrial fibrillation were 
consistent with existing evidence from randomised 
controlled trials.11 Apixaban appeared to be associated 
with the lowest risk of major bleeding in most of the 
larger studies.12 14 18 20 21 The risk of mortality in our 
subcohort with atrial fibrillation was similar for 
warfarin, dabigatran, and apixaban but elevated 
for rivaroxaban. Like the Danish study,22 our risk 
of mortality in this subcohort was elevated only for 
patients on lower doses of apixaban and rivaroxaban. 
The other Danish study of standard dosage showed 
decreased mortality for apixaban,18 but our findings 
showed equivalent risk to warfarin for such patients.
The risk of ischaemic stroke associated with DOACs 
in our subcohort of patients with atrial fibrillation was 
equivalent to warfarin, which is in line with the latest 
meta-analysis for prevention of ischaemic stroke and 
both Danish studies.11 18 22 Similarly, we did not show 
any different risks of venous thromboembolism for 
any DOACs compared with warfarin in patients with 
atrial fibrillation, which is also in line with the relevant 
findings from the latest meta-analysis.11
Meaning of the study: possible explanations and 
implications for clinicians and policy makers
Anticoagulants are prescribed for a wide range of 
indications although the adverse events have been 
studied mostly in patients with atrial fibrillation.12-24 
Our study has shown that the risk of major bleeding 
is lower in patients taking apixaban regardless of the 
reason for prescribing. This was most pronounced for 
intracranial bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation 
and for gastrointestinal bleeding in patients without 
atrial fibrillation, appearing, in general, to show 
apixaban to be the safest drug.
Increased risk of all cause mortality was found 
in rivaroxaban users for both patients with atrial 
fibrillation and without atrial fibrillation. Apixaban 
was associated with an increased risk of all cause 
mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation and 
without atrial fibrillation, but only in patients on

lower doses. The increased all cause mortality may be 
reflecting the closer monitoring of patients undergoing 
treatment with warfarin may be related to unmeasured 
confounding due to prescribing choices related to 
underlying comorbidities.
unanswered questions and future research
The use of DOACs in patients with atrial fibrillation 
has been extensively studied but this group represents 
only half of anticoagulant users. Our study provides 
the evidence for this group and highlights increased all 
cause mortality in the group of patients without atrial 
fibrillation indications for anticoagulant prescribing. 
This group, however, includes patients undergoing 
preventative treatment for venous thromboembolism 
or ischaemic stroke after hip or knee replacements, 
fractures, or other operations and studying this group 
in detail would require further splitting.
We were unable to investigate the risks of ischaemic 
stroke and venous thromboembolism in patients who 
had already experienced a prior event because it can 
be difficult to distinguish new events from ongoing 
reviews of previous events in electronic health records. 
The risk of bleeding was lower in patients taking DOACs 
but the risk of mortality was increased in rivaroxaban 
and lower dose apixaban users. This also requires 
further investigation.
conclusion
This large observational study, based on a general 
population in a primary care setting, provides 
reassurance about the safety of DOACs as an alternative 
to warfarin across all new incident users. Apixaban 
was found to be associated with a decreased risk 
of major bleeding, particularly for intracranial and 
gastrointestinal bleeds. This was consistent for patients 
with atrial fibrillation and without atrial fibrillation. 
Rivaroxaban and low dose apixaban were, however, 
associated with an increased risk of all cause mortality 
when compared with warfarin. Our results give an 
initial, reassuring, indication of the risk patterns for all 
patients taking anticoagulants, with respect to those 
prescribed apixaban.
