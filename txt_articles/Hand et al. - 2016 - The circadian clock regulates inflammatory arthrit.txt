ABSTRACT: There is strong diurnal variation in the symptoms and severity of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as
rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, disruption of the circadian clock is an aggravating factor associated with a range of
humaninflammatorydiseases.Toinvestigatemechanisticlinksbetweenthebiologicalclockandpathwaysunderlying
inflammatory arthritis, mice were administered collagen (or saline as a control) to induce arthritis. The treatment
provoked an inflammatory response within the limbs, which showed robust daily variation in paw swelling and
inflammatory cytokine expression. Inflammatory markers were significantly repressed during the dark phase. Further
work demonstrated an active molecular clock within the inflamed limbs and highlighted the resident inflammatory
cells,fibroblast-likesynoviocytes(FLSs),asapotentialsourceoftherhythmicinflammatorysignal.Exposureofmiceto
constant light disrupted the clock in peripheral tissues, causing loss of the nighttime repression of local inflammation.
Finally, the results show that the core clock proteins cryptochrome (CRY) 1 and 2 repressed inflammation within the
FLSs, and provide novel evidence that a CRY activator has anti-inflammatory properties in human cells. We conclude
that under chronic inflammatory conditions, the clock actively represses inflammatory pathways during the dark
phase. This interaction has exciting potential as a therapeutic avenue for treatment of inflammatory disease.—Hand, L.

The circadian clock is an internal timing mechanism that
enables organisms to anticipate rhythmic daily changes in
the environment and adapt their physiology accordingly.
At a molecular level, 24-h oscillations are created by a
transcriptional–translationalfeedbackloop(1).Withinthis
loop, the positive transcriptional regulators CLOCK and
BMAL drive the transcription of the negative regulators
period (per) and cryptochrome (cry). The PER and CRY
proteins dimerize and inhibit CLOCK/BMAL-mediated
transcription. The PER/CRY complex is subsequently
degraded, releasing this inhibitory effect and allowing a
new cycle of transcription to begin. Immune system
function and activity are strongly influenced by the circa-
dian clock, under both homeostatic conditions and during
inflammatorychallenge(2).Muchofthistemporalcontrolof
immune responses is orchestrated by peripheral clocks—
timers within individual cellular components of the im-
mune system that confer rhythmicity to their functionality.
Macrophages(3,4),naturalkillercells(5),Tlymphocytes
(6), mast cells (7), and eosinophils (8) all harbor cell auton-
omous clocks and exhibit daily rhythms in activity. Con-
sequently, immune responses to acute challenge shows
temporal gating, wherein response magnitude and char-
acteristics vary in accordance with the phase of the circa-
dian clock. For example, we have shown that the intrinsic
clock within peritoneal macrophages drives the response to
acute endotoxic challenge (3). Similarly, response to acute
bacterial infection is circadian regulated (9–11). As yet, little
is known regarding the influence of the clock on immune
mechanisms underlying chronic inflammatory disorders.
Investigation of this area could unmask critical links be-
tween immune and timing systems, enabling access to
unexplored therapeutic options.

is well established that immunologic disease markers as-

IL6 has been identified as strongly rhythmic in patients
with RA, with elevated levels in the morning (14, 15).
However, despite this clear clinical evidence of rhythmic
disease presentation, little is known about how the path-
ophysiology of RA is governed by the circadian clock.
In this study, we characterized the role of the circadian
clock in a well-established model of inflammatory arthri-
tis, murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Paralleling
the rhythmic disease in patients with RA, we dem-
onstrated robust 24-h variation in disease markers
within arthritic mice, and identified FLSs as a rhythmic
effector cell within the joints. Moreover, by disrupting
the clock in vivo (via environmental disruption and ge-
netic targeting) and in vitro (via pharmacological ma-
nipulation and RNA interference), we identified a direct
role for the circadian clock in driving disease expression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the
United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedure) Act 1986. Un-
less otherwise stated, animals were housed in 12:12 h light:dark
(LD) lighting conditions with ad libitum access to normal rodent
chow. DBA/1 mice were purchased from Envigo (Huntingdon,
United Kingdom). mPER2::lucreporter mice (16), cry12/2cry22/2
(17) and per22/2 (18) mice were bred in house.
CIA
Male DBA/1 mice age 8–12 wk were immunized with 1 mg/ml
bovine type II collagen (MD Bioscience, Zurich, Switzerland)
emulsifiedwithanequalvolumeofCompleteFreund’sAdjuvant
(CFA; MD). The emulsion (50 ml) was injected intradermally,
under anesthesia in 2 sites just above the base of the tail. As a
control, animals were injected with an emulsion of saline and
CFA in equal volumes. Twenty-one days later, a booster (200 ml
1 mg/ml collagen in saline) was administered intraperitoneally
to CIA animals. Immunization and boost were routinely admin-
istered at zeitgeber time (ZT)6. Disease incidence and severity
and hind paw thickness were monitored from ;18 d post-
immunization(DPI).Diseaseseveritywasscoredineachlimbon
a 4-point scale: 1) one inflamed digit; 2), two or more inflamed
digits; 3), swelling of the foot pad and minor ankylosis; and 4),
severe swelling of the foot pad and joint and severe ankylosis),
and the sum was calculated.
Constant light
Mice were group housed in light-tight cabinets. At lights on, the
light intensity was recorded at 42–45 lm/ft2. After 2 wk in 12:12 h
LD,thelightswerealteredtoremainconstantlyon(LL,light:light).
For CIA induction, immunization occurred 2 wk after mice had
been housed in LL, with animals remaining in LL for the duration
of the study. Littermate control mice were housed in LD.
Serum analysis
Blood samples were collected from the tail vein and allowed
to clot at room temperature for 10 min before centrifugation
(10,000 g, 10 min, 4°C). (Blood sampling during the dark
phase was performed under dim red light). Serum was col-
lected and frozen (280°C) for later analysis. Analysis for cy-
tokines was performed with a BioPlex Pro Mouse Th17 panel
A/Pro Mouse cytokine 23-plex or customized kits as per kit
instructions (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, United Kingdom).
Serum samples (10 ml) were diluted in sample diluent (45 ml),
and 50 ml was loaded per well.
RNA analysis
Hindlimbs were dissected 1 mm above the ankle joint; the skin
was removed and the tissue snap frozen. Each frozen joint was
ground up in liquid nitrogen and transferred to Trizol in a
Lysing D matrix tube (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA)
for further homogenization with a FastPrep machine (MP
Biomedicals). Other tissues were placed directly into Trizol
and homogenized with the FastPrep machine, as previously
described. RNA was extracted using standard methods and
quantified with a nanodrop and after DNase treatment con-
verted to cDNA using standard procedures (RNA to cDNA;
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Quantitative
PCR (qPCR) analysis was performed on a Step One Real-Time
PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using TaqMan primers
and probes. Murine cxcl5, clock, icam1, ifng, rev-erba, il10,
bmal2, and npas2 primer/probe sets were purchased as vali-
dated TaqMan gene expression assays (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific). All other murine genes were analyzed with the primer
and probe sequences listed on Supplemental Table 1. Human
forward and reverse primers were used with probes from a
Universal Probe Library Set (Roche Diagnostics, Ltd., Burgess
Hill, United Kingdom) (Supplemental Table 1.). Analysis was
comparative, and b-actin (mouse) and 18S (human) served as
housekeeping genes. SYBR Green primers (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) were validated by generating a melt curve to ensure
a single PCR product, and gel analysis was performed to check
the product size. Experimental samples were normalized to
control samples, as indicated in Results.
Murine FLS cultures
FLSs were isolated from the joints of mice as per published
methods(19). Skin was removedfromthe hindpaws, which were
then cut 1 mm above the ankle joint and placed into HBSS. After
they were washed in HBSS and 70% ethanol, the limbs were
dissected between the toe and ankle joints. Dissected tissue was
placed into DMEM [1% penicillin-streptomycin (Pen-Strep); 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS)] containing 10 mg/ml collagenase so-
lution (from Clostridium histolyticum type IV; Sigma-Aldrich,
Dorset, United Kingdom) and placed in a shaking incubator for
1.5 h at 37°C. The cells, and some tissue debris, were pelleted by
centrifugation, resuspended in DMEM, and cultured for at least
3 passages before experimental use to obtain a purified pop-
ulation of FLSs. To assess clock activity, the cells were syn-
chronized with dexamethasone (DEX, 100 nM) and aliquots
of cells were collected every 4 h for RNA analysis, starting
20 h after synchronization. To stimulate cells, TNFa was used
at a concentration of 10 ng/ml. The CRY activator (KL001;
Merck-Millipore, San Diego, CA, USA) was used at 8 mM (in
DMSO) and applied 1 h before TNFa stimulation. The cells
were harvested 2 h after stimulation (unless stated other-
wise), and RNA was extracted with RNeasy kits (Qiagen,
Manchester, United Kingdom). Population purity was
assessed by flow cytometry with antibodies against CD11b

 (macrophage marker) and CD90.2 (FLS marker) (19). Cells de-
rived from mPER2::luc mice were monitored on the photon
multiplier tube (PMT) system for temporal luciferase activity (3).
Small interfering RNA knockdown
Murine FLSs were synchronized with DEX (100 nM) and trans-
fected with small interfering (si)RNAs targeting cry1, cry2, or a
nontargeting control (SmartPool: On-TargetPlus mouse siRNAs;
Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA), using DharmaFect 2 (Dhar-
macon), as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The following
day, the cells were treated with vehicle or TNFa (10 ng/ml) for 2
h at the peak of cry1 expression, before they were harvested, and
RNA was extracted with RNeasy kits (Qiagen).
Human FLSs
Passage 2 human FLSs were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and
subcultured in DMEM (1% Pen-Strep; 10% FBS) for 2 to 3 rounds.
ClockactivityandCRYactivatorstudieswereperformedasabove.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting for FLSs
Both hindlimbs from naive DBA/1 mice were harvested and
dissected at either ZT0 or -12, and the resultant tissue was pooled
for collagenase digestion (as described above). Collagenase was
applied for 1 h at 37°C and the cells pelleted. Cells were stained
with Live/Dead fixable blue stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific Life
Sciences) before application of an Fc block (eBioscience, San
Diego, CA, USA) for 20 min and then with antibodies against
CD45 (AF700, clone 30-F11) CD90.2 (BV786, clone 30-H12).
Stained cells were sorted (Influx cell sorter; BD Biosciences,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and single, live FLSs (CD45- CD90.2+)
were collected into an Eppendorf tube (Hamburg, Germany)
containing RLT lysis buffer (RNeasy Micro Kit). The number of
collected cells averaged 4.7 6 0.4 3 104/animal. Lysed cells were
stored at 280°C until RNA extraction.
ELISA
Quantification of cytokine levels in cell supernatants was per-
formed with DuoSet ELISA kits from R&D Systems (Minneap-
olis, MN, USA) as per instructions. Where cytokine levels were
normalized to protein content, bicinchoninic acid assays were
performed to quantify protein levels according to kit instructions
(Sigma-Aldrich).
Statistics
DatawereanalyzedwithIBMSPSS,v20(Armonk,NY,USA)and
Prism, v6 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA). Values presented are
means 6 SEM. Cosinor analysis was used to assess temporal ex-
pression of clock genes in FLSs.
RESULTS
Arthritic mice exhibit diurnal rhythms in
disease severity and joint inflammation
Collagen inoculation of DBA/1 mice resulted in a high
incidence of inflammatory arthritis (CIA), with signs of
disease evident from ;18 DPI, peaking at ;30–40 DPI
(Fig. 1A). In severely inflamed limbs showing swelling of
the footpad(severityscore,$3),pawsize wassignificantly
greater at mid-light phase (6 h after lights on; ZT6) when
compared with the mid-dark phase (18 h after lights on;
ZT18; Fig. 1B). Paw size did not vary in control na¨
ıve mice,
or in the unaffected paws of CIA mice (data not shown). In
line with day/night variation in paw swelling, CIA mice
showed strong diurnal variation in levels of circulating
cytokines (Fig. 1C). IL1b, IL10, IFNg, and TNFa were
significantly elevated at ZT6 compared with ZT18. ZT18
circulating inflammatory cytokines in the CIA mice were
no higher than levels measured in matched na¨
ıve or
vehicle-treated mice. In a separate experimental group,
serum was sampled at ZT0 and -12 from arthritic and
vehicle-treated mice and analyzed in a broad cytokine
array (Supplemental Fig. 1). This confirmed that levels of
IL1b, IL10, IFNg, and TNFa (but not IL6) exhibit a strong
diurnal variation in CIA mice and are heightened during
the light phase. Additional cytokines (IL2, -3, -4, -5, -12p40,
-12p70, and -13 and granulocyte-macrophage–colony
stimulating factor) and chemokines (CCL2, -5, and -11)
werealsosignificantlyhigherinthe serumatZT0vs.-12in
arthritic animals.
Having established a robust rhythmic inflammatory
signal in the blood of CIA mice, we next addressed
whethertheinflamed jointsthemselvesshowedrhythmic
changes in inflammatory state. Gene expression profiling
of inflammatory markers in inflamed joint tissue of ar-
thritic mice (collected at lights on; ZT0), revealed signif-
icantly increased expression of several proinflammatory
(cxcl5, il6, cxcl1, il1b, and ccl2) and anti-inflammatory
(il10) cytokines, as well as genes involved in cell adhesion
(icam1) and tissue remodeling (mmp3) (Fig. 2A). In line
with previous reports (20), tnfa expression was un-
changed and ifng and ifnb showed significant reduction
in expression levels. We next examined the temporal
profile of this local inflammatory response across the
24-h cycle. Of the inflammatory cytokines up-regulated
in CIA limbs, several exhibited rhythmic expression (Fig.
2B). Cxcl5, il6, cxcl1, and il1b levels were elevated during
the light phase, whereas ifng and ifnb transcription
peaked in the dark phase, and tnfa and il10 remained
uniform across the cycle. In contrast, cytokine transcript
levels (cxcl5, il1b, and il6) were flat throughout the day
in limbs of na¨
ıve mice (Supplemental Fig. 2A). The data
indicate that expression of inflammatory cytokines
within the joint differs significantly from that of circu-
lating profiles (i.e., IL6, INFg, TNFa), suggesting op-
eration of a local, oscillating mechanism of cytokine
expression within the joint. Temporal analysis of clock
gene expression in inflamed limbs of CIA mice revealed
robust 24 h rhythmicity of the clock genes (per2, cry1,
bmal1, clock, rev-erba, and npas2) and clock output genes
(dbp) within this tissue (Fig. 2C), with a characteristic
increase in the expression of per2 and cry1 (the negative
arm of the clock) during the dark phase (ZT12–18). A
similar pattern of clock gene expression was observed in
healthy limbs from naive mice (Fig. 3B), although the
expression of most clock genes was reduced in the
inflamed limbs (Supplemental Fig. 2B).

 These studies reveal a time-dependent fluctuation in
disease severity in CIA mice that correlates with daytime
exacerbation of joint inflammation. Within the inflamed
joint, the rhythmic proinflammatory signal(elevated cxcl5,
il6, cxcl1, and il1b) occurs in antiphase to the negative arm
of the clock (per, cry).
Circadian disruption alters
disease rhythmicity
Given the strong rhythmicity of disease activity in CIA
mice, we examined the effects of constant light (LL expo-
sure) on disease incidence, paw swelling, disease severity,
and disease rhythmicity. Housing under LL disrupts rhyth-
mic behavior in mice, and impairs peripheral clock oscilla-
tions(21,22).ThiseffectwasconfirmedinnaiveDBA/1mice
exposed to LL for 6 wk (Fig. 3A, B). Daily rhythms in
peripheral (liver and limb) clock gene expression were
profoundly decreased in LL-exposed mice in comparison
to those in LD-housed controls. For CIA experiments,
mice were exposed to LL from 14 d before collagen im-
munization until the end of the experiment. As predicted
from control studies, arthritic mice kept in constant light
showed loss of diurnal variation in clock gene expression
in inflamed limbs (Supplemental Fig. 2C). Disease in-
cidence, disease score, and paw thickness of CIA mice
were not significantly different between the lighting reg-
imens (Fig. 3C). Moreover, levels of circulating cytokines
maintainedadiurnalvariationinarthriticmiceheldunder
LL (Fig. 3D). However, LL-exposed animals showed no
diurnal variation in the paw size of severely affected limbs
(unlike LD-housed mice) with loss of the nighttime re-
pression (Fig. 3E). In line with this result, analysis of cy-
tokine expression within inflamed paws at 2 time points
(projected ZT6 and -18) confirmed consistently high levels
of the proinflammatory cytokines cxcl5, il6, cxcl1, and il1b
and consistently low levels of ifng and ifnb (Fig. 3F).
FLSs are rhythmic inflammatory effector cells
within the joint
An earlier study has implicated FLSs as local mediators of
inflammation in human RA and animal models (23). To
assess the circadian rhythmicity of this cell population in
vivo, FLSs were isolated (by FACS) from the limbs of naive
DBA/1 mice at ZT0 and -12, and analyzed for expression
of clock genes (Fig. 4A). These samples showed significant
diurnal oscillations in clock genes that followed the
expected phase. To determine whether this rhythmicity
continues ex vivo FLSs were extracted and cultured from
na¨
ıve DBA/1 mice (population purity, 70–80%; Fig. 4B), as
well as mPER2::luc clock reporter mice, which have a lu-
ciferase reporter fused to the PER2 protein (16). Real-time
recording of mPER2::luc bioluminescence demonstrated
that joint-derived FLSs exhibited an intrinsic rhythmicity
in PER2 protein expression (Fig. 4C), indicating the oper-
ation of an intrinsic cellular clock. Similarly, FLSs cultured
from naive DBA/1 mice, showed clear rhythmicity in
the expression of core clock genes (Fig. 4D). As expected,
FLSs showed a proinflammatory phenotype in culture in

 response to TNFa stimulation (Fig. 4E). TNFa adminis-
tration caused a pronounced and rapid increase in cxcl5,
il6, cxcl1, il1b, and tnfa gene expression, as well as a
significant increase in CXCL5, IL6, and CXCL1 protein
secretion into the culture medium (Fig. 4F). Ifng and ifnb
expression, as well as IFNg, IL10, and IL1b remained
below the limits of detection, even after stimulation
(TNFa production was not measured because of the
presence of recombinant mouse TNFa in the medium).
Together, these results implicate FLSs as mediators of
rhythmic inflammatory responses within the joint.
Targeting the clock in RA
Our results show that arthritic joint inflammation is
dampened during the night. Impairment of clock oscilla-
tions within the joint (through exposure to LL) causes loss
of this nocturnal repression, leading to consistently active
inflammation. We therefore tested whether nocturnal
constraint on inflammatory processes involves the re-
pressive arm of the molecular clock (which is most active at
night) using FLSs harvested from cry12/2cry22/2 [double
knockout (DKO)] mice (Fig. 5A, B). Upon TNFa stimula-
tion, DKO cells exhibited a significantly enhanced in-
flammatory response, at both the gene (il6, cxcl5, and il1b)
and protein (CXCL1, IL6, and CXCL5) level. In contrast,
FLSs derived from per22/2 mice (lacking the other com-
ponentofthenegativearmoftheclock)showednoincrease
in inflammatory cytokine production in response to TNFa,
compared to wild-type (WT) littermates (however, cxcl5/
CXCL5productionwassuppressedintheabsenceofPER2)
(SupplementalFig.3).In furtherstudies,WTFLS cellswere
treated with cry1 or cry2 siRNA, which resulted in 86 and
83% knockdown, respectively (Fig. 5C). Knockdown of
cry1, cry2, or both significantly increased inflammatory
cytokine production (cxcl1, cxcl5, and il1b) after TNFa
stimulation (Fig. 5D).
Finally, the CRY activator KL001 (24) (8 mM) was tested
inmurineandhumanFLSstoassesstheanti-inflammatory
effects of stabilizing the negative arm of the clock. FLSs
obtained from human synovial tissue, demonstrated clear,
robust rhythmicity of core clock genes after synchroniza-
tion (Fig. 6A). Control studies confirmed the anticipated
effect of KL001 on the clock of FLSs. Expression of per2 was
rapidly suppressed (2 h); cry1 and bmal1 were not affected
at this time point (Fig. 6B). Pretreatment with KL001 1 h
before TNFa stimulation clearly repressed induction of
cxcl1/CXCL1, il6/IL6, and il1b in both mouse and human
cells (but only human cxcl5) (Fig. 6C–E), providing novel
evidence that pharmacological stabilization of CRY has
anti-inflammatory effects.
DISCUSSION
The results of this study demonstrated diurnal variation in
both the symptomatic expression of disease and the un-
derlying inflammatory processes in a mouse model of in-
flammatory arthritis. We showed for the first time, the
influence of circadian processes within the inflamed joint
on disease severity and rhythmicity. Systemic and local
profiling of proinflammatory cytokines and inflamma-
tory markers revealed clear time-of-day variation, which
showed significant elevations during the early part of the
day(ZT0–6),compared to the night(ZT12–18), when signs
of disease waned. Moreover, disruption of the circadian
clock in vivo or in cultured FLSs, inflammatory effector
cells within the joint, resulted in a heightened inflam-
matory state and loss of disease rhythmicity. The rhyth-
mic disease profile in mice replicates observations in
clinical studies (14, 15) where rhythmic pathophysiology
is commonly observed in patients with RA. Rest–activity
cycles of humans and mice are opposite in phase, thus
time-of-day variation in inflammation is not simply re-
lated to sleep–wake cycles, but morelikely tobe an output
of local clock activity.
Human RA patient studies consistently show ele-
vated IL6 levels in the early morning (14, 15, 25). This is
similarly reflected in the arthritic mice, with a morning
peak in circulating cytokine levels. We now extend this
observation to the local site of inflammation, the af-
fected limb. Within the inflamed joint, daily rhythmic-
ity in a wide range of proinflammatory markers (cxcl5,
il6, cxcl1, and il1b) was observed, indicating that active
proinflammatory processes in the joints of CIA mice are
repressed during the night. The inverse relationship
between IFNg expression and footpad swelling has
been reported in CIA mice (20, 26, 27). Although gen-
erally considered a proinflammatory cytokine, IFNg
has been assigned a protective role in the pathogenesis
of arthritis, with genetic disruption of IFNg resulting
in increased disease activity. Similarly, ifnb has anti-
inflammatory properties in CIA (28). Both ifng and ifnb
levels were heightened during the dark phase. These
data suggest that the clock exerts a synergistic effect
on pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways to achieve
overall repression of inflammation during the night,
which parallels studies from Curtis et al. (29). We did
not observe temporal variation in levels of the anti-
inflammatory cytokine il10 within the inflamed limb,
which has been reported to be under clock control in
peritoneal macrophages (29). This absence of variation
could indicate that the cellular source of il10 in the
inflamed limb is not limited to the macrophage or may
reflect differences in the nature of resident populations
of macrophages. Differences between systemic and
limb profiles of inflammatory markers were revealed
(e.g., IL6, TNFa, and IFNg), indicating that a resident
oscillator drives inflammation within the joint. Indeed,
temporal analyses of clock gene expression in the joint
demonstrated the presence of robust daily oscillations.
There was clear rhythmicity in the expression of clock
genes in inflamed limbs; however, overall we recorded
a reduction in expression levels. This dampening could
be due to the increased cellularity in inflamed limbs and
an influx of nonrhythmic inflammatory cells into the
tissue. Alternatively, this effect could be a consequence
of the chronic inflammatory environment, as acute
inflammation is known to have an impact on peripheral
clock-dampening rhythms (30, 31).

 dampens rhythmicity in neuronal firing within the
central clock, without affecting stress levels (21, 32–35).
We therefore used LL as an environmental perturbation
to examine how destabilization of the circadian clock
impacts CIA disease incidence, severity, and rhythmic-
ity. Our data showed the predicted dampening of
rhythmicity in peripheral tissues under LL conditions in
the liver and limbs in both na¨
ıve and arthritic conditions.
Data regarding the impact of LL on peripheral rhythms
was obtained by averaging data from multiple animals;
thus, it is possible that the dampened rhythmicity ob-
served reflects not only a decrease in amplitude within
individual animals, but also a broadened distribution of
circadian phase within the group (22). Given current
knowledge of the detrimental impact of circadian dis-
ruption on innate immunity (36), it was somewhat sur-
prising that mice held under LL conditions showed no
significant difference in the incidence or overall severity
of arthritic disease. However, disease severity (score
and paw swelling) was routinely assessed at ZT6 (the
peak of disease expression under LD), which may have
minimized differences between LD- and LL-housed
mice. We might predict that assessment at ZT18 would
highlight differences between the lighting conditions.
Furthermore, temporal variation in circulating levels
of proinflammatory cytokines was maintained in LL-
housed mice. In contrast, there was a clear impact of
constant light on severely inflamed limbs (score, $3),
wherein LL-housed mice exhibited an increase in mag-
nitude and loss of diurnal rhythmicity in paw swelling.
In line with this result, proinflammatory markers of
severely affected limbs increased and were no longer
rhythmic. Similarly, the nighttime increase in anti-
inflammatory markers was abolished, clearly illustrat-
ing the importance of an intact local clock for generating
a rhythmic inflammatory signature. It is of interest to
define and quantify how cellular influx (e.g., immune cell
subtypes and number) into inflamed joints is altered by
peripheral clock disruption.
Recently attention has turned to FLSs as critical players
in the joint destruction related to arthritis. They become
activated by the inflammatory milieu of arthritic joints,
which alters their phenotype to a more proinflammatory,
invasive type and causes epigenetic modifications that
promote further aggressive features (37). In this study,
murine FLSs are rhythmic in vivo and ex vivo. Similarly, in
keeping with earlier studies, cultures of primary human
FLSs exhibited robust temporal rhythms in clock gene
expression (38, 39), thereby highlighting the FLSs as can-
didate drivers of rhythmic inflammation within arthritic
joints. We demonstrated that these activated cells are a
major source of the proinflammatory cytokines, which
show rhythmic expression under chronic inflammatory
conditions(CXCL1,CXCL5, and IL6). Within the inflamed

 joints, expression of ifng and ifnb was in antiphase to the
other proinflammatory cytokines examined. In addition,
ifng and ifnb transcript levels were not altered by appli-
cation of TNFa to FLSs in vitro. This finding suggests
that additional cell types within the limbs contribute to
rhythmic cytokine signaling. Inflammatory cell infiltration
of affected joints is pronounced in CIA. Therefore, migra-
tory immune cells (e.g., T cells, monocytes, neutrophils,
and eosinophils) and other resident cells within the joint
(e.g., tissue macrophages, osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and oste-
ocytes) may also contribute to the rhythmic patterns in
joint inflammation during CIA. Nevertheless, it is estab-
lished that the proinflammatory signature evoked by
TNFa stimulation in FLSs differs significantly from that
induced by other proinflammatory stimuli (40), and thus,
within the inflamed joint, FLSs may still be a source of
IFNg/b. They showed rapid increases in transcription of
il1b and il10 in response to TNFa stimulation, but IL1b
and IL10 protein was not detected in significant levels in cell
supernatants, most likely reflecting the temporal dynamics
of the protein production and sensitivity of our assays.
Taken together, our observations suggest that the
repressive armof the molecularclock, and specificallyCRY,
contributes to the reduction in inflammation observed
during the night. Both CRY (41–44) and PER (45–48) have
been implicated in regulation of inflammatory processes.
However, although FLSs derived from mice lacking cry1/2
demonstrated a proinflammatory phenotype, FLSs
derived from per22/2 mice did not show an increased
response to TNFa stimulation. Loss of PER2 resulted in
attenuated cxcl5/CXCL5 production. This supports our
earlier work reporting circadian regulation of CXCL5 (9)
and highlights the complex nature of the interactions be-
tween the molecular clock and inflammatory pathways.
CRY has been linked to severity in an alternative model
of arthritis, collagen antibody–induced arthritis. Mice lack-
ing both cry1 and cry2 exhibit an exacerbation of joint
swelling, compared to WT animals in this model
caused by up-regulation of TNFa, IL-1b, and IL-6 (44). Al-
though behaviorally arrhythmic in constant conditions,
cry12/2 cry22/2 mice maintain robust diurnal patterns
of activity when housed in a 12 h LD cycle, because of light-

 induced masking of activity (49). Thus, enhanced
inflammation in cry12/2 cry22/2 mice can be attributed to
loss of CRY per se, rather than loss in consolidated behav-
ioral activity patterns. We showed that knockdown of both
cry genes (cry12/2cry22/2) exacerbates inflammatory re-
sponses. siRNA knockdown studies revealed that both cry1
and cry2 are important for regulating inflammatory re-
sponses.There was no additional synergistic effect of cry1
and cry2 knockdown, suggesting that both genes play an
important role. Given that genetic knockout of cry1 and
cry2 caused a significant enhancement in the il6 response
to stimulation, it was surprising that siRNA knockdown
had little effect, most likely reflecting our inability to
achieve total knockdown through siRNA. Pharmaco-
logical activation of CRY proteins [with KL001 (24)]
attenuates inflammatory responses in FLSs, in keeping
with recent findings in a model of atherosclerosis,
where overexpression of CRY1 had anti-inflammatory
effects (41). This is the first demonstration of the anti-
inflammatory properties of a synthetic CRY stabilizer.
KL001 was originally developed as a tool to study CRY-
dependent physiology and to facilitate development of
clock-based therapeutics of diabetes (24). We now report
the clock as a bona fide target for anti-inflammatory
therapeutics in arthritis. Although the current formula-
tions of CRY activators are not compatible with in vivo
use, these findings highlight CRY activity as a novel
avenue for therapeutic development in RA.
In summary, according to our data, local joint in-
flammation in CIA exhibits a robust diurnal variation, in
keeping with observations in patients with RA. Further-
more,weidentifiedan output pathwayfromthecoreclock
to inflammation mediated by the CRY proteins, likely
operating in FLSs within the affected joints. There has been
a recent interest in the development of novel small mole-
cule compounds that target components of the clock (e.g.,
REV-ERB, ROR, and CRY) (24, 50–53), and these results
open a potential new therapeutic avenue in the treatment
of RA and other inflammatory conditions.
