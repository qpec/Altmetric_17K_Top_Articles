eighborhood environmental characteristics and socio-
economic status (SES) have been linked to health out-
comes, especially cardiovascular disease (CVD).1,2 These 
unfavorable environmental attributes also seem to impact life-
style behaviors including physical activity and smoking.2–4 It 
has long been suspected that the adverse effects of these envi-
ronments are driven by low access to healthy food for neigh-
borhood residents.5,6 The Coronary Artery Risk Development 
in Young Adults study reported that an increased prevalence 
of convenience stores was associated with lower dietary qual-
ity, specifically in low-income subjects.7 However, whether 
other aspects of the socioeconomic neighborhood environ-
ment also contribute to geographical differences in CVD 
health status, and the role played by individual SES, remain a 
subject of controversy.1,2

A food desert (FD) is defined by the US department of agri-
culture (USDA) as a location with both low access to healthy 
food and low income.8 An estimated 23.5 million people live in 
FD across the United States,8,9 and the White House Task Force 
on Childhood Obesity recognized FD as a major contributor to a 
poor dietary pattern and obesity.10 Governmental programs and 
policies are currently focused on clearing FD areas by funding 
healthy food options and access.11 However, the direct linkage 
between FD and health outcomes remains understudied.
Background—Food deserts (FD), neighborhoods defined as low-income areas with low access to healthy food, are a public 
health concern. We evaluated the impact of living in FD on cardiovascular risk factors and subclinical cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) with the hypothesis that people living in FD will have an unfavorable CVD risk profile. We further 
assessed whether the impact of FD on these measures is driven by area income, individual household income, or area 
access to healthy food.
Methods and Results—We studied 1421 subjects residing in the Atlanta metropolitan area who participated in the META-
Health study (Morehouse and Emory Team up to Eliminate Health Disparities; n=712) and the Predictive Health 
study (n=709). Participants’ zip codes were entered into the United States Food Access Research Atlas for FD status. 
Demographic data, metabolic profiles, hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) levels, oxidative stress markers 
(glutathione and cystine), and arterial stiffness were evaluated. Mean age was 49.4 years, 38.5% male and 36.6% black. 
Compared with those not living in FD, subjects living in FD (n=187, 13.2%) had a higher prevalence of hypertension and 
smoking, higher body mass index, fasting glucose, and 10-year risk for CVD. They also had higher hs-CRP (P=0.014), 
higher central augmentation index (P=0.015), and lower glutathione level (P=0.003), indicative of increased oxidative 
stress. Area income and individual income, rather than food access, were associated with CVD risk measures. In a 
multivariate analysis that included food access, area income and individual income, both low-income area and low 
individual household income, were independent predictors of a higher 10-year risk for CVD. Only low individual income 
was an independent predictor of higher hs-CRP and augmentation index.
Conclusions—Although living in FD is associated with a higher burden of cardiovascular risk factors and preclinical 
indices of CVD, these associations are mainly driven by area income and individual income rather than access to healthy 
food.  (Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. 2017;10:e003532. DOI: 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.116.003532.)

 2  Kelli et al  Food Deserts and Cardiovascular Risk
The relationship between SES and cardiovascular risk 
can be studied in the general population by investigating risk 
factor prevalence and presence of subclinical vascular dis-
ease.12 Vascular dysfunction often precedes CVD,13 and pre-
vious studies have reported a higher pulse wave velocity (a 
measure of arterial stiffness) and intima–media thickness in 
black subjects with lower SES, even in adolescence.14 Chronic 
inflammation, estimated by circulating hs-CRP (high-sensi-
tivity C-reactive protein) levels, is an established risk factor 
for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and CVD and is inversely 
related to SES.15–17 Oxidative stress (OS) is an important ini-
tiating factor in the pathogenesis of subclinical and clinical 
CVD, but its relationship to neighborhood and environmental 
factors remains unknown.18,19
Few studies have examined the relationship between spe-
cific characteristics of disadvantaged neighborhoods, such as 
living in a FD and a comprehensive set of CVD risk factors and 
subclinical measures of vascular disease.20 CVD and its risk 
factors are more prevalent in southeastern United States,21,22 
and there is a shift in concentration of cardiovascular mortal-
ity from the northeast to deep south.23 Although the reasons 
are likely to be multifactorial, differences in racial distribution 
and social determinants seem to play a role. Whether neigh-
borhood access to healthy foods is driving these disparities 
above and beyond income levels at the personal or neighbor-
hood level remains poorly studied. Herein, we examined the 
association between living in areas of either low income or 
low access to healthy food, or both (FD) and the burden of 
cardiovascular risk factors, inflammation, OS, and subclinical 
vascular disease. Our hypothesis was that living in a FD would 
be associated with an unfavorable cardiovascular risk profile 
and subclinical vascular disease, independent of overall area 
SES and individual SES.
Methods
Study Sample
We performed a cross-sectional analysis of data from subjects aged 
20 to 79 years and residing in the Atlanta metropolitan area who 
were recruited into the META-Health study (Morehouse and Emory 
Team up to Eliminate Health Disparities; n=712) or the Predictive 
Health (PH) study (n=709).24,25 The META-Health (MH) study re-
cruited 753 community participants of whom 721 were eligible and 
enrolled. Only 712 subjects had valid addresses for determining area 
characteristics. The Predictive Health study (http://predictivehealth.
emory.edu) recruited a cohort of university employees from Emory 
University and the Georgia Institute of Technology.24,25 Seven hun-
dred eleven subjects were enrolled in the study, and only 709 had 
valid addresses for neighborhood analysis. There was no significant 
difference between those who were included and those who were ex-
cluded from our analysis. Those with poorly controlled medical con-
ditions, acute illness, recent hospitalization, or pregnant women were 
excluded. Detailed information on demographics and anthropomet-
rics was collected. Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes 
mellitus were defined according to the Joint National Committee, 
Adult Treatment Panel III, and American Diabetes Association cri-
teria, respectively.26–28 The Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease 
in Adults (ASCVD) scores were calculated to estimate the 10-year 
risk for coronary death or myocardial infarction.29 Subjects signed an 
informed consent that was approved by the Emory and Georgia Tech 
institutional review board. Please see the Data Supplement for details.
Each participants’ zip code was entered into the USDA Food 
Desert Research Atlas that determined their FD status.8 A FD refers to 
a geographic location with both low income and low access to healthy 
foods. Low-income areas are defined according to criteria developed 
by the Department of Treasury’s New Markets Tax Credit program 
as any area where poverty rate is ≥20% or where the median family 
income is ≤80% of the state-wide median family income. Areas with 
low access to healthy foods are defined as areas where a significant 
share of people live ≥1 mile away in urban areas or ≥10 miles in rural 
areas from supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store.8
Laboratory Tests
Participants were instructed to fast for 12 hours before the study visit. 
Venous blood was collected, and levels of total cholesterol, low-den-
sity lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and 
glucose were measured by spectrophotometry. Serum hs-CRP level 
was measured by immunonephelometry (Siemens/Dade Behring). 
Markers of OS included plasma levels of the amionthiols, gluta-
thione, and cystine, which were measured using high-performance 
liquid chromatography as described previously.19,30,31 Low levels of 
glutathione and high levels of cystine indicate higher OS. Of 1421 
subjects enrolled in MH and PH studies, the following data were 
missing: hs-CRP (69 MH and 7 PH subjects), GSH (41 MH and 98 
PH), and cystine (41 MH and 97 PH subjects) because of technical 
difficulties in sample drawing or processing. Pulse wave velocity 
(PWV; 295 MH and 24 PH subjects) and augmentation index (AI, 
52 MH and 17 PH subjects) data were missing. Only available data 
were analyzed.
Vascular Function Testing
PWV and AI were estimated in the supine position after an over-
night fast using the SphygmoCor device (AtCor Medical, Australia), 
which records sequential high-quality pressure waveforms at periph-
eral pulse sites using a high-fidelity tonometer, as described previ-
ously.31–33 AI is a ratio calculated from blood pressure waveform as 
the percentage of central pulse pressure to the secondary systolic 
pressure rise caused by the overlap of the reflected pressure waves.34 
Details are available in the Data Supplement.
Statistical Methods
Continuous variables are presented as means±SD when normally dis-
tributed, skewed variables (cardiovascular risk scores and hs-CRP) 
as median (lower and upper quartiles), and categorical variables as 
proportions. Univariate group differences were compared using the 
χ2 test for categorical variables and independent t tests for continu-
ous variables. Nonparametric testing (Mann–Whitney) was used for 
comparing skewed variables, and these values were log transformed 
WHAT IS KNOWN
• Neighborhood characteristics and socioeconomic 
status have been linked to unfavorable cardiovascu-
lar risk profile and health outcomes.
• Previous literature suggested that adverse effects of 
the environment may be because of low access to 
healthy food.
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
• The study demonstrates an association between 
living in food deserts and inflammation, oxidative 
stress, and arterial stiffness.
• We demonstrate that the higher prevalence of cardio-
vascular risk factor burden, oxidative stress, inflam-
mation, and subclinical vascular disease is driven by 
individual income rather than food access.

before analysis. Multiple linear regression was performed to deter-
mine the association of FD, area or personal income, and food access 
with OS measures and vascular function after adjusting for traditional 
CVD risk factors, including age, sex, race, smoking, hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and body mass index. Interaction 
between food access, area, and personal income was performed. We 
intentionally adjusted for CVD risk factors because of baseline differ-
ences of risk factor burden between subjects living in different areas 
of FD. Individual income and education level were highly correlated 
in our sample. Therefore, we only adjusted for individual income to 
reduce multicollinearity. P values <0.05 were considered significant. 
Analyses were performed using SPSS, Inc (version 23).
Results
Subjects’ Characteristics
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the 1421 
subjects are presented in Table 1. The sample was 38.5% 
male, 36.6% black, mean age 49.4±10.2 years. Education-
level assessment revealed that 11% had a high school diploma 
or less, whereas 63.7% were college graduates. Annual house-
hold income in 11.2% was <$25 000, and 47.9% had income 
>$75 000 (Table 1).
FD Areas and Cardiovascular Risk
The distribution of FD in the Atlanta metro area according 
to the USDA Food Access Research Atlas is shown in Fig-
ure (A). Individuals living in FD areas (n=187, 13.2%) were 
predominantly black (52% versus 34%) with less college edu-
cation and lower income compared with those who were not 
living in FD (Table 1). They also had an unfavorable cardio-
vascular risk profile with a higher prevalence of hypertension 
and smoking rates, higher body mass index and fasting blood 
glucose levels, and a higher ASCVD score (P=0.007). More-
over, they also had higher levels of hs-CRP, lower levels of 
glutathione, and higher AI compared with those living in non-
FD areas (Table 1). These differences remained significant for 
glutathione and AI after adjustment for traditional risk factors 
(Tables 1 and 2).
Food Access, Area Income, Individual Income, and 
Cardiovascular Risk
The population was further classified on the basis of resid-
ing in neighborhoods and its access to healthy food and area 
income in addition to individual household income (Table 3; 
Figure [B and C]). Subjects living in neighborhoods with low 
access to healthy food were more often black, with lower edu-
cation level, higher body mass index, and prevalence of hyper-
tension compared with subjects living in favorable food access 
areas. Similar findings in addition to higher prevalence of dia-
betes mellitus, smoking, hyperlipidemia, and higher ASCVD 
score were observed in subjects living in low-income com-
pared with high-income areas. The sample was further classi-
fied based on individual income defined as annual household 
income <$50 000. Similar differences in cardiovascular risk 
factors were observed in subjects with low compared with 
high individual income.
The differences in subclinical vascular disease was also 
examined in subjects based on their neighborhood characteris-
tics and individual SES. There were no differences in the mark-
ers of inflammation, OS, or vascular stiffness in those living in

low compared with good access to healthy foods (Tables 2 and 
3). However, subjects living in low-income areas had a higher 
hs-CRP levels, lower glutathione levels, higher PWV, and 
AI compared with subjects residing in higher income areas 
(Table 3). The differences in hs-CRP and glutathione levels 
remained significant after adjustment for cardiovascular risk 
factors (Table 2). Low individual income was also associated 
with higher levels of hs-CRP, PWV, and AI and lower glu-
tathione level, and the differences remained significant after 
adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors (Tables 2 and 3).
Relationship Between Cardiovascular Risk 
and Both Area Income and Food Access
Subjects were separated into 4 categories based on whether 
they were living in high-income areas with either good (n=356) 
or low access to healthy foods (n=597), or in low-income 
areas with either good (n=281) or low access to healthy food 
(FD, n=187; Figure I through V in the Data Supplement). Sub-
jects living in low-income areas with low food access (FD) 
had no significant difference in ASCVD score, hs-CRP, PWV, 
cystine, or glutathione levels compared with subjects living in 
areas with low income and good food access areas. Only sub-
jects living in low-income areas, irrespective of whether they 
had good or poor access to healthy food, had higher hs-CRP 
level and higher OS (low glutathione) when compared with 
subjects living in high-income areas, regardless of their food 
access (Figure I through V in the Data Supplement).
Relationship Between Cardiovascular Risk 
and Both Individual Income and Food Access
Subjects were separated into 4 categories based on whether 
they were living in areas with good or poor access to healthy 
food and whether they had high versus low individual income 
(Table I and Figure I through V in the Data Supplement). 
There were no significant differences in cardiovascular risk 
factors, CVD risk estimation, inflammation, arterial stiffness, 
and OS between subjects with low individual income living 
in areas with poor or good access to healthy food. Similarly, 
no differences in these measures were observed in subjects 
with high individual income living in varying food access 
areas. Thus, individuals with high income living in areas with 
low access to healthy food had lower risk factor burden and 
ASCVD scores (P=0.001), lower hs-CRP levels (P=0.004), 
and higher glutathione levels (P=0.005) compared with sub-
jects with lower income living in similar low access area (Fig-
ure I through V in the Data Supplement). These data indicate 
that individual income and not food access was a more impor-
tant contributor to CVD risk.
Relationship Between Cardiovascular Risk 
and Both Individual Income and Area Income
The distribution of risk factors, biomarkers, and vascular func-
tion was also studied to distinguish the effects of individual 
versus the area income levels (Table II and Figure I throgh V 
in the Data Supplement). Subjects with low individual income 
living in low-income areas were more likely to be black with 
lower educational level, higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus 
and smoking, higher hs-CRP levels (P=0.05), higher cardio-
vascular risk (ASCVD P<0.001), and lower glutathione level 
(P=0.041) compared with individuals with higher individual 
income living in low-income areas. Similarly, subjects with 
low individual income living in high-income areas were more 
often black with poor education levels, higher ASCVD score, 
higher Hs-CRP levels, and lower glutathione levels compared 
with those with high income living in similar high-income 
areas (Figure I through V in the Data Supplement).
Relationship Between Cardiovascular Risk and 
Individual Income, Area Income, and Food Access
Multivariate analyses were performed after adjustment for 
traditional cardiovascular risk factors to investigate which 
of these SES and neighborhood factors were associated with 
CVD risk markers. When individual income, area income, 
and food access were entered into the same model, indepen-
dent predictors of higher ASCVD risk score were both low 
individual and low neighborhood income. Only low indi-
vidual income was an independent predictor of both hs-CRP 
and AI after adjusting for CVD risk factors. Finally, area 
income (P=0.031) was also an independent predictor of OS 
(Table 4). Thus, the major predictors of increased CVD risk 
were individual and neighborhood income, whereas food 
access and living in FD were not independent predictors of 
CVD risk. There was no significant interaction between area 
income, individual income, and food access with ASCVD risk 
score, OS, and inflammation. The data were unchanged when 
adjusted for study cohort.
Discussion
In a community-based population from the southeastern 
United States, we demonstrate the clinical impact of living in 
FD and its components on cardiovascular risk and subclini-
cal vascular disease. We found that subjects living in FD not

only had an unfavorable cardiovascular risk profile but also 
had increased systemic OS, inflammation, and arterial stiff-
ness. Further investigation of individual components of FD 
showed that its associations with unfavorable health profile 
were driven by area income rather than food access. Moreover, 
individual household income showed the most robust impact 
on the various measures of CVD risk and subclinical vascular 
disease.

including arterial stiffness. These measures estimate activation 
of pathophysiologic processes that lead to initiation and pro-
gression of CVD and are independently predictive of adverse 
long-term outcomes.19 Similarly, measures of subclinical vascu-
lar disease integrate the injury from risk factors on the vascular 
wall and are also predictive of future adverse outcomes.13,35,36 
In this study, we not only demonstrate that CVD risk scores 
are higher in individuals living in low-income neighborhoods 
or with lower personal income but also show that these factors 
were significantly associated with inflammation, OS, and arte-
rial stiffness.
Food Deserts
The present study is the first to report the relationship between 
living in FD (defined as both low income and access to 
healthy food areas by the USDA), cardiovascular risk fac-
tors, and subclinical vascular disease. Previous studies have 
focused on select neighborhood characteristics and SES in 
addition to composite scores of neighborhood features.2,37 For 
example, areas with poor food quality, low access to healthy 
foods, or more fast-food restaurants are associated with obe-
sity and diabetes mellitus risks.38,39 A recent study showed 
that although living in FDs was associated with decreased 
fruit and vegetable intake and higher systolic blood pressure, 
low individual income rather than FDs was associated with 
higher odds of chronic kidney disease.40 Novel findings of our 
study are the relationships between FD and subclinical CVD 
measured as vascular dysfunction, inflammation, and OS, and 
the fact that these are driven by income rather than access to 
healthy foods.13,19
Food Access
There is controversy on the cardiovascular health effects of 
food access.41,42 In the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities 
study, increased prevalence of convenience stores was associ-
ated with a higher incidence of obesity but not diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension, or dyslipidemia.43 However, other studies did not 
confirm these findings.38,44 We found that living in areas with 
low access to healthy food was not associated with a higher 
CVD risk, inflammation, OS, or arterial stiffness compared 
with subjects living in areas with good access to healthy food. 
Thus, food access by itself, measured by proximity to super-
markets, might not contribute to increased cardiovascular risk, 
and the relative cost of higher quality food rather than access 
may be a major barrier to healthy lifestyle and choices.6,45
Area and Individual Income
The relationship between SES and CVD risk is well estab-
lished.2,37,46–48 There is striking geographical variation in the 
distribution of cardiovascular risk factors and CVD mortality 
in the United States.49 Neighborhood SES, deprivation, lack 
of cohesion, decreased access to recreational resources, lack 
of public space, and safety are some of the factors that can 
affect these outcomes.1 The income status of neighborhoods 
can also influence the diversity of food resources, prices, and, 
thus, food access.50,51 Our analyses showed that the income 
status of areas is an independent determinant of cardiovascu-
lar risk and subclinical vascular disease.
Our study also showed that it was the individual income, 
rather than the neighborhood income or food access, that was 
associated with higher risk of developing CVD, inflammation,

and OS. Thus, people with high individual income who lived in 
low-income areas had lower CVD risk and inflammation com-
pared with subjects with lower individual income who lived 
in similar area. Moreover, people with high individual income 
who lived in an area with poor food access had better cardiovas-
cular profile than those with lower individual income who lived 
in similar area. It seems that the adverse association of FD with 
health is partly driven by the area income and most importantly 
by individual income status, rather than access to food. There 
are several initiatives that promote healthy food access by pro-
viding incentives for individuals with low income. Georgia pro-
vides incentives for participants in the Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program to increase the value of Supplemental 
Nutrition Assistance Program benefits if healthy food is pur-
chased at farmers’ markets. However, few farmers’ markets 
are located in FDs and few accept Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program in Georgia.52 Providing support services 
for eligible low-income families may overcome some of the 
adverse health outcomes driven by low SES. A recent report 
by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention showed that 
enrollment in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for 
Women, Infants, and Children decreased the prevalence of 
childhood obesity among low-income families.53
The study also demonstrated that residents living in dis-
advantaged areas including FD, low income, and low-access 
areas had a higher proportion of black residents. Black neigh-
borhoods have been reported to have more fast-food restau-
rants,54 fewer supermarkets,55 fewer healthy options, lower 
levels of social cohesion, and worse walking environments.56 
Our data shows that blacks also formed a higher proportion of 
those with low income, a key driver of increased CVD risk.
Limitations and Strengths
Our study has several strengths. It investigates the relationship 
between components of FD and cardiovascular risk factors in 
a region of United States where there is tremendous racial and 
regional disparity in the incidence of CVD. It investigates the 
health impact of socioeconomic and neighborhood features 
on subclinical CVD, including inflammation, OS, and arterial 
stiffness. Limitations include its cross-sectional nature where 
causality between income and living in FD and subclinical 
vascular disease cannot be established. Second, our study was 
conducted in a single urban area in southeastern United States 
and may not be generalizable to other regions. Third, geo-
graphic locations and characteristics can change with time. 
However, a recent update by the USDA showed relatively 
small change in low-income and low-access neighborhoods 
between 2010 and 2015 data.57 Previous studies also showed 
that individuals usually move into neighborhoods with similar 
SES across their life course.58,59
Conclusions and Implications
People living in FD had a higher prevalence of cardiovascu-
lar risk factors, inflammation, OS, and arterial stiffness. These 
associations are largely driven by area and individual income 
rather than access to healthy food. The implications of our 
findings are that at least in urban areas, risk of CVD seems to 
be associated less with access to healthy food and more with 
socioeconomic factors. This understanding may help to better 
tailor resources to affected communities and improve utiliza-
tion of public health resources.
