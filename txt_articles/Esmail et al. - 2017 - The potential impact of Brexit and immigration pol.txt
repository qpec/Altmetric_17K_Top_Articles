characteristics of the areas and population
they served in September 2016

Abstract
Background: The UK is dependent on international doctors, with a greater proportion of non-UK qualified doctors
working in its universal health care system than in any other European country, except Ireland and Norway. The terms
of the UK exit from the European Union can reduce the ability of European Economic Area (EEA) qualified doctors to
work in the UK, while new visa requirements will significantly restrict the influx of non-EEA doctors. We aimed to explore
the implications of policy restrictions on immigration, by regionally and spatially describing the characteristics of general
practitioners (GPs) by region of medical qualification and the characteristics of the populations they serve.
Methods: This is a cross-sectional study on 37,792 of 41,865 GPs in England, as of 30 September 2016. The study involved
age, sex, full-time equivalent (FTE), country and region of qualification and geography (organisational regions) of individual
GPs. Additionally at the practice and geography levels, we studied patient list size by age groups, average patient location
deprivation, the overall morbidity as measured by the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) and the average payment
made to primary care per patient.
Results: Non-UK qualified GPs comprised 21.1% of the total numbers of GPs, with the largest percentage observed in
East England (29.8%). Compared to UK qualified GPs, EEA and elsewhere qualified GPs had higher FTE (medians were 0.
80, 0.89 and 0.93, respectively) and worked in practices with higher median patient location deprivation (18.3, 22.5 and
25.2, respectively). Practices with high percentages of EEA and elsewhere qualified GPs served patients who resided in
more deprived areas, had lower GP-to-patient ratios and lower GP-to-cumulative QOF register ratios. A decrease in pay
as the percentage of elsewhere qualified GPs increased was observed; a 10% increase in elsewhere qualified GPs was
linked to a £1 decrease (95% confidence interval 0.5–1.4) in average pay per patient.

Conclusions: A large percentage of the UK general practice workforce consists of non-UK qualified GPs who work
longer hours, are older and serve a larger number of patients in more deprived areas. Following Brexit, difficulties in
replacing this valuable workforce will primarily threaten the care delivery in deprived areas.

Background
Current General Medical Council (GMC) estimates sug-
gest that 36% of doctors working in the UK obtained their
primary medical qualification outside the UK. Twenty-two
percent of these are general practitioners (GPs) [1]. These
international medical graduates (IMGs) provide a valuable
service to the National Health Service (NHS), often work-
ing in areas that are unpopular with British graduates —
primary care in inner city areas, ex-mining communities
and in specialties like psychiatry and geriatrics [2]. It is
surprising that the world’s fifth richest country by gross
domestic product (GDP) [3] is so dependent on inter-
national doctors. In fact, the UK has a greater proportion
of non-UK qualified doctors working in its universal
health care system than any other European country, with
the exception of Ireland and Norway [4].
The UK’s continued dependence on doctors who
have qualified outside the UK may amplify the current
NHS crisis, due to several factors. The terms of the
UK exit from the European Union could potentially
reduce the ability of EEA qualified doctors to work in
the UK. Furthermore, new visa requirements with the
removal of the permit free training visa and the intro-
duction of the Tier 2 visa (which can only be issued if
no UK or EU resident with ‘leave to remain’ satisfied
the person specification for a post) significantly re-
stricts the ability of non-EEA nationals to work in the
NHS [5].
Additional initiatives such as the Medical Training
Initiative, which is administered by the Academy of
Medical Royal Colleges, offer a time-limited 2-year Tier
5 visa ostensibly to provide training for overseas gradu-
ates but they also explicitly state that the visa can be
used to employ overseas graduates in under-subscribed
and of-need areas for hospital trusts [6]. The scheme
offers the doctors recruited the ability to practice in the
UK without the requirements of the Professional and
Linguistic Assessment Board (PLAB) test. The aim is
that the candidate returns home after 2 years of training.
It does not provide a mechanism for doctors to continue
to remain in the UK after this period. The scheme is
currently being used to recruit IMGs to shortage special-
ties such as accident and emergency (A&E) but can real-
istically only apply to hospital training posts because of
the training requirements for general practice. Further
unintended consequences of the Brexit vote and the
negative political climate around immigration may also
make the UK a less appealing destination for medical
migrants, compounding the problems outlined above.
The problems of GP workforce recruitment are likely to
be exacerbated by these changes because there is an
unequal distribution of GPs across the country, with areas
of high deprivation, where health care needs are greater,
having fewer GPs per head than the UK average [7]. In
addition, GPs tend to be older in deprived areas [8], while
evidence from surveys suggests that 54% of GPs over the
age of 50 are intending to quit direct patient care within
5 years [9], with the rate increasing to approximately 80%
for those aged 55 or older [10]. There is anecdotal
evidence that these areas of high deprivation have a higher
proportion of IMGs who also tend to be older (over 50)
and are therefore more likely to retire in the next decade.
We first described this scenario in a paper published in
1999 [11]. The availability of more extensive workforce
data may allow further detailed analysis of health care
needs and their relationship to workforce characteristics
based on the distribution of GPs, their country of qualifi-
cation and the workforce demands that might be affected
by changes in immigration policy.
In this paper we aimed to investigate the geographical
location, distribution and serving populations of non-UK
qualified GPs, with a particular focus on EEA and
elsewhere qualified GPs. There is currently no up-to-date
information on the distribution of GPs by country of
qualification and their demographics. It is our assertion
that there will be areas of the country which will be
more adversely affected by changes in immigration
policy post-Brexit. It is therefore important that com-
missioners, Health Education England (HEE) and the
wider NHS are aware of the significant problems this
might have on future workforce planning needs and the
provision of primary care services. The underlying
hypothesis was that in the EEA and elsewhere (not in
the UK or the EEA) qualified GPs serve more deprived
populations with more health needs, while often provided
with fewer resources. We also investigated the characteris-
tics of GPs and their geographical distribution, by country
of qualification.

 Methods
Data
We used a range of sources of administrative and spatial
data. The core dataset that contains primary care work-
force information is provided by NHS Digital, and we
obtained data as of 30 September 2016, published on 29
March 2017 [12]. At the practice level, information is
available on geography (Clinical Commissioning Group
(CCG) and NHS region), patient list size by age groups
and also numbers and full-time equivalent (FTE) for GPs,
by country and region of qualification. At the individual
level, the same geographical information is available, as
well as staff type (e.g. GP, nurse, administrator), role (e.g.
GP partner, junior doctor), country and region of qualifi-
cation for GPs only, age, sex and FTE. Individual records
are not linked to practices to protect anonymity [13].
Additional information at the practice level included the
average deprivation of patients, the overall morbidity as
measured by the QOF and the average payment made to
primary care per patient. NHS payments to general prac-
tice for the financial year 2015/2016 and for the whole of
England [14] were used to calculate average pay per
patient minus prescribing and dispensing fee payments.
Deprivation was quantified with the 2015 release of the
Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), a complete aggre-
gate measure which is widely used to quantify deprivation
and
affluence
[15].
The
measure
quantifies
relative
deprivation across the following seven domains: income,
employment, education and skills, health and disability,
crime, barriers to housing and services, and living envir-
onment. Deprivation scores are calculated and assigned to
very low UK geographical units (Lower Super Output
Areas), and the overall IMD is calculated as a weighted
mean across the seven domains, with income and employ-
ment deprivation given the largest weight (22.5% each),
followed by health and education deprivation (13.5%
each), and with the other three domains given equal
weights (9.3%). To calculate the average deprivation levels
of the practice population, rather than the practice
location, we made use of a dataset linking practice popula-
tions to low geographies [16], allowing us to calculate a
weighted average of deprivation for each practice.
To quantify overall morbidity at the practice level, we
used 2015/2016 data from a national primary care pay--
for-performance
programme,
the
QOF
[17].
The
programme has underpinned high quality of recording
in primary care [18], and under its umbrella, recording,
management and treatment of a large number of clinical
domains was financially and reputationally incentivised.
In 2015/2016, there were 21 incentivised domains: Atrial
Fibrillation,
Asthma, Cancer, Cardiovascular Disease
Primary Prevention, Coronary Heart Disease, Chronic
Kidney Disease (for those aged 18 or older), Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Dementia, Depression
(18 or older), Diabetes both types (17 or older), Epilepsy
(18 or older), Heart Failure, Hypertension, Learning
Disability, Severe Mental Illness, Obesity (18 or older),
Osteoporosis (50 or older), Peripheral Artery Disease,
Palliative Care, Rheumatoid Arthritis (16 or older),
Stroke. For each of the practices participating in the
QOF, covering more than 99% of all registered patients
[19], we calculated the total sum of all condition regis-
ters, a cumulative QOF register.
Finally, 2016 spatial coordinates for NHS organisa-
tional units were obtained from the Office for National
Statistics (ONS) Open Geography portal [20]. We fo-
cused on two organisational levels, the lower CCGs with
209 units, and the higher NHS regions with 14 units.
Analyses
For all aspects of data manipulation and analysis we
used Stata v14.1. Whenever medians are reported, we
also report the 25th and 75th centiles. Spatial maps were
plotted using the spmap command [21]. An alpha level
of 5% was used throughout.
We quantified the characteristics of GPs for the whole
of England and for each of the 14 NHS regions in 2016.
For each region and overall, we estimate and report the
following individual aggregates: number, percentage of
males, median age and median FTE. All individual-level
aggregates are reported overall by GP country of qualifi-
cation. We also report practice-level aggregates on
median number and FTE (overall only) per 10,000
patients, per 1000 patients aged 75 or older and per
10,000 counts on the cumulative QOF register. Finally,
and also at the practice level but overall and by GP
country
of
qualification,
we
present
the
median
residence location deprivation of the average practice
patient and median of the average pay per patient
(minus
prescription
and
dispensing
costs).
For
deprivation, we first calculated the weighted deprivation
mean within each practice, and next we estimated its
weighted median (weighted by the practice list size for
overall estimates or by the product of the list size and
the percentage of GPs qualified from each region for
qualification regions). The process was similar for pay,
the only difference being the first step where we used
the average pay per patient in the practice. This weight-
ing approach allowed us to estimate patient deprivation
and pay medians by GP country of qualification (on
numbers, which were available as country of qualifica-
tion aggregates at the practice level, when FTE was not).
In a second approach, we quantified the characteristics
of practices (median FTE per 10,000 patients, 1000
patients aged 75 or older and 10,000 counts on the cu-
mulative QOF register; also average pay and patient resi-
dence
location
deprivation)

 to 20%; above 20% and up to 40%; and above 40%. To
evaluate if pay differed for various strata of EEA and
elsewhere qualification more robustly, we performed
multiple linear regressions at the practice level, associat-
ing average pay to percentage of EEA, percentage of
elsewhere and percentage of EEA or elsewhere qualifica-
tion, adjusted for the percentage of patients aged 75 or
older and the cumulative QOF register (i.e. adjusting for
proxies of health need).
Spatial graphs at the CCG level with additional informa-
tion on NHS regions were plotted for various variables of
interest for GPs, overall and by region of qualification:
number and percentage aged 55 or older (FTE weighted),
cumulative FTE, mean age, FTE per 10,000 patients and
FTE per 10,000 counts on the cumulative QOF register.
The primary aim of these graphs was to identify areas
more dependent on overseas qualified GPs.
Results
Characteristics for GPs, by region of qualification, are
provided in Table 1 for 92.4% of the general practices
that submitted data. Elsewhere and EEA qualified GPs
make up 21.1% of the workforce of 37,792 GPs for which
individual-level information was available. The median
GP age was 42, 48 and 46 for UK, EEA and elsewhere
qualified,
respectively.
Median
FTE
for
EEA
and
elsewhere qualified GPs was 0.89 and 0.93, respectively,
compared to 0.80 for UK qualified. Across general prac-
tices,
the
median
of
the
average

location
deprivation varied by GP region of qualification: 18.3 for
UK (52nd centile of the IMD distribution across all low
geographical regions for England), 22.5 for EEA (62nd
centile) and 25.2 for elsewhere (67th centile). The gen-
eral practice median of the average pay per patient
(minus prescription and dispension costs) was £133 for
UK qualified GPs, £132 for EEA qualified and £129 for
elsewhere qualified. In Additional file 1 we also present
this information for each of the 14 NHS regions
(Additional file 1: Tables S1 and S2). The largest
percentage of non-UK qualified GPs was observed in
East England (29.8%) and the lowest in the South West
(7.6%). The greatest variability in terms of average pay-
ment was seen in the East, with medians of £145 (UK
qualified), £134 (EEA) and £126 (elsewhere). Average
patient deprivation was consistently higher for EEA and
elsewhere qualified GPs, across all regions.

 high percentages of EEA and elsewhere qualified GPs
tend to have patients who reside in more deprived areas,
have lower GP-to-patient ratios and have lower GP-to-
cumulative QOF register ratios. In other words, practices
with more EEA and elsewhere qualified GPs, on average,
deal with more deprived patients of poorer health and
have fewer GPs relative to the health needs (as quanti-
fied by the QOF). For older patients the picture differs
for EEA and elsewhere qualified GPs, with a lower GP-
to-older patients ratio for the former, and a higher one
for the latter. Regarding average pay, the picture was
inconsistent for EEA qualification (largely due to small
practice numbers with high percentages of EEA qualified
GPs), but we observed a decrease in pay as the
percentage of elsewhere qualified GPs increased.
Complementing the tabulation with the multiple linear
regression results, we found that pay was not associated
with percentage of EEA qualified GPs in the practice,
when adjusting for older patients and the cumulative
QOF register (the effect was very small and not statisti-
cally significant). However, there was a modest adjusted
association between pay and the percentage of elsewhere
qualified GPs in the practice, with a 10% increase in
elsewhere qualified GPs linked to a £1 decrease (95%
confidence interval 0.5–1.4) in average pay per patient.
Spatial graphs at the CCG level, with thicker border
lines for NHS regions, are provided in the main paper and
in Additional file 1. Figure 1 demonstrates the overall FTE
of EEA and elsewhere qualified GPs, identifying most of
the Greater London area, many CCGs in the East of
England and some in the North West and the North East
as heavily dependent on non-UK qualified GPs. The mean
age of EEA and elsewhere qualified GPs is presented in
Fig. 2, with London, areas around London and the North
West employing the oldest GPs, on average. The rate of
the FTE of all GPs relative to health need (with higher
values indicating more GPs) is presented in Fig. 3
(per 10,000 patients) and in Fig. 4 (per 10,000 counts on
the cumulative QOF register). The top and bottom 10
CCGs, in terms of dependence on EEA and elsewhere
qualified GPs, are provided in Table 3. Additional spatial

 GP area of qualification was unknown for 1202 GPs
(3.18%), although this has little or no bearing on our
analyses
(see
limitations).
The
CCG
location
was
unknown for 221 GPs (0.58%), which were necessarily
excluded from the spatial maps. Estimates at the practice
level could only be computed for a subgroup of 6477
practices (86.1% of all 7527 practices) for which all infor-
mation was available: workforce with non-missing GP
numbers (which is the biggest problem with 1034
practices removed because GP information is missing),
patient location deprivation, QOF and payments.
Discussion
Our results show that in areas that have a higher pro-
portion of EEA and elsewhere qualified GPs, they tend
to be older and more of them work full time. These
areas have populations that are more deprived, with GPs
dealing with deprived patients with poorer health. These
areas also have fewer GPs relative to the health needs of
the population (as quantified by the QOF). The data also
suggest that these doctors tend to have fewer resources
and are paid on average less than their UK qualified
counterparts. The areas that are most affected by these
demographics and workforce characteristics, because
they are heavily dependent on non-UK qualified GPs,
are concentrated in most of the Greater London area,
many CCGs in the East of England and some in the
North West and the North East.
Strengths and limitations of the study
The main strength of this study is the use of numerous
national administrative datasets of high data quality that
allows us to obtain a complete picture for the whole of
England. Nevertheless, some limitations exist.
First, data were not available for all GPs, the head-
count of which was 41,865 on 30 September 2016 [12].
Information was reported for 37,792 GPs or 90.3% of all
those practicing in England, for 1202 (3.2%) of which the
country of qualification was unknown. However, we
think missing data are unlikely to introduce bias to our
findings; for example, it seems unlikely that most of the
GPs for which we could not obtain data were UK quali-
fied and working in deprived areas.
Second, as with all analyses of observational data, we
report associations and not causal paths. However, the

 directionality can be reasonably assumed in most cases (e.g.
non-UK qualified GPs do not lead to an increase in
deprivation).
Third, aggregating the observed practice-level associ-
ation to the CCG level to make them more relevant to the
current organisational structure of the NHS is challenging.
This is due to the fact that CCGs are higher level units
which usually serve highly heterogeneous areas in terms
of deprivation and populations. Therefore, associations
between country of qualification and patients’ health
needs or deprivation can be obscured at the CCG level.
Findings
The over-dependence on overseas qualified GPs has the
potential to have an impact on and exacerbate the current
recruitment and retention crises in general practice, espe-
cially in the short term (the next 10 years). Unfortunately,
it is likely to affect areas of the country which have the
greatest health needs, thus adding another dimension to
Julian Tudor Hart’s inverse care law [22, 23].
General practice remains critical to the long-term
sustainability of the NHS [24]. Despite longstanding ini-
tiatives to increase GP training numbers to 3250 per
annum, GP recruitment has remained well below this
target at around 2700 per annum [25]. The crisis in GP
recruitment prompted the Secretary of State for Health
to promise to increase the number of GPs by 5000 by
2020, in the run-up to the 2015 elections [26]. However,
current evidence suggests that the GP workforce did not
increase between September 2015 and September 2016,
but even fell by 0.3% (FTE) [27]. The question is, how
will the 2020 target be met, especially in the context of
hardening public attitudes to immigration? Even though
the Secretary of State has promised 1500 new medical
graduates per year from 2018 [28], it will take at least
10 years for this cohort to be trained in general practice,
assuming that we can persuade more than the current
30% of UK graduates to choose general practice as their
first career choice [29–31].
So, at least in the short term, the demand for EEA and
non-EEA international graduates is likely to increase
substantially. Furthermore, the adverse political climate
around immigration and Brexit is already resulting in a
large number of EU citizens leaving the NHS — recent
figures suggest that there has been an 83% increase in
doctors from the EU leaving NHS England [27]. This

 will have an additional impact on retention of the med-
ical workforce, potentially exacerbating problems in
shortage areas, especially considering that 36% of GPs
aged 50–54 and 80% aged 55 or older intend to retire
from general practice in the next five years [10]. As
demonstrated by our findings, a disproportionate num-
ber of these older GPs are EEA and elsewhere qualified.
In a specialty that has always relied on medical migra-
tion to cover the shortfall in the GP medical workforce,
immigration policy changes that we have described earl-
ier, together with our findings, have the potential to ex-
acerbate the recruitment and retention problems in
general practice. Worryingly, as far as we can tell, these
important issues have not registered in the calculations
of the Department of Health or with HEE.
Our data also suggest a continuing hypocrisy in the way
that non-UK qualified doctors are treated. We are
dependent on overseas qualified doctors because policy
makers are unwilling to take measures to promote self-
sufficiency in the medical workforce. The reasons are very
likely financial, with one estimate suggesting that non-UK
qualified doctors may have contributed £15 billion in
saved medical school fees [32]. Yet despite the positive fi-
nancial contribution they make, arguably even higher than
the positive contribution of the average EEA migrant [33],
and the fact that they work in deprived areas with patients
who have greater needs (and are probably paid less for
doing this), they remain a marginalised and stigmatised
group of doctors [34]. Despite the recruitment crises in
general practice, they have a higher failure rate in the post-
graduate exams for general practice, even when adjusted
for academic ability. They are more likely to be disciplined
by their employers and be brought before the GMC [35].
The reality is that overseas qualified doctors are part of
the solution to the recruitment crises facing general prac-
tice, and this needs to be acknowledged by policy makers
and our politicians.
Conclusions
This study adds insight into the role of non-UK
qualified doctors in delivering care in English general
practices, particularly in deprived areas. One in five
GPs qualified outside the UK; non-UK qualified GPs
work more often on a full-time basis, with more de-
prived populations and are paid less in comparison to
UK qualified GPs. Challenges in directing medical
trainees to general practice and also retaining quali-
fied doctors are major drivers of the present work-
force crisis in primary care. The current political
climate can only worsen this problem, since the re-
tention and the recruitment of non-UK qualified doc-
tors is likely to be affected. A strong association
between deprivation and the Brexit vote has been
widely reported [36], and our findings point towards
a Brexit ’paradox’; the people residing in deprived
areas, who mainly voted for Brexit, appear to be more
dependent on non-UK qualified doctors to cover their
health care needs. The most alarming implication is
that there appears no realistic way to increase the
number of UK qualified GPs for at least a decade,
while the retention and replacement crisis of non-UK
qualified GPs is likely to be politically exacerbated in
the near future, with patients in more deprived areas
more likely to be affected. Non-UK qualified doctors
have been a valuable remedy to the shortage of GPs
in England, and this remedy is now under threat.
