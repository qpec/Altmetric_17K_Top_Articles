Abstract
In the setting of profound ocular blindness, numerous lines of evidence demonstrate the
existence of dramatic anatomical and functional changes within the brain. However, previ-
ous studies based on a variety of distinct measures have often provided inconsistent find-
ings. To help reconcile this issue, we used a multimodal magnetic resonance (MR)-based
imaging approach to provide complementary structural and functional information regarding
this neuroplastic reorganization. This included gray matter structural morphometry, high
angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) of white matter connectivity and integrity, and
resting state functional connectivity MRI (rsfcMRI) analysis. When comparing the brains of
early blind individuals to sighted controls, we found evidence of co-occurring decreases in
cortical volume and cortical thickness within visual processing areas of the occipital and
temporal cortices respectively. Increases in cortical volume in the early blind were evident
within regions of parietal cortex. Investigating white matter connections using HARDI
revealed patterns of increased and decreased connectivity when comparing both groups. In
the blind, increased white matter connectivity (indexed by increased fiber number) was pre-
dominantly left-lateralized, including between frontal and temporal areas implicated with lan-
guage processing. Decreases in structural connectivity were evident involving frontal and
somatosensory regions as well as between occipital and cingulate cortices. Differences in
white matter integrity (as indexed by quantitative anisotropy, or QA) were also in general
agreement with observed pattern changes in the number of white matter fibers. Analysis of
resting state sequences showed evidence of both increased and decreased functional con-
nectivity in the blind compared to sighted controls. Specifically, increased connectivity was
evident between temporal and inferior frontal areas. Decreases in functional connectivity
were observed between occipital and frontal and somatosensory-motor areas and between
temporal (mainly fusiform and parahippocampus) and parietal, frontal, and other temporal
areas. Correlations in white matter connectivity and functional connectivity observed
between early blind and sighted controls showed an overall high degree of association.
However, comparing the relative changes in white matter and functional connectivity

these findings provide complimentary evidence, as well as highlight potential contradictions,
regarding the nature of regional and large scale neuroplastic reorganization resulting from
early onset blindness.
Introduction
Ocular blindness has served as an important model in helping to understand the consequences
of sensory deprivation on brain development. Extensive work in animal models has provided
compelling anatomical and behavioral evidence regarding the dramatic neuroplastic changes
that result from altering visual experience (e.g. [1–3]). In humans, there has been considerable
interest in relating neuroplastic changes with compensatory behaviors observed in individuals
living with profound blindness (see [4–6] for reviews). Indeed, there is mounting support that
blind individuals (particularly, when blind from birth or very early in life) demonstrate com-
parable, and in some cases even superior, behavioral skills as compared to their sighted coun-
terparts (e.g. [7–11]; for review see [12, 13]). Taken together, a contemporary view suggests
that these compensatory behaviors may be intimately related to underlying changes in the
overall structural and functional organization of the brain [14]. This reorganization implicates
areas responsible for the processing of intact senses such as touch, hearing, and smell [15–17].
At the same time, there is also evidence of crossmodal reorganization within occipital cortex;
that is to say, the area of the brain normally ascribed to processing visual information. Specifi-
cally, numerous neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that blind individuals show robust
activation within occipital cortical areas while performing a variety of nonvisual tasks (e.g.
Braille reading [18], sound localization [19–21], and odor perception [22]), as well as higher
order cognitive tasks including language processing [23–25] and verbal memory recall [7, 26].
Despite accumulating evidence of these dramatic neuroplastic changes (and in particular
implicating occipital cortical areas), a number of reports have suggested that the functional
organization (i.e. domain specificity) of the occipital cortex may develop independently of
visual experience (e.g. [27–31]). Importantly, it has been argued that this organization is main-
tained by an intrinsic pattern of anatomical and functional connectivity between occipital
and other brain regions that process non-visual properties within corresponding cognitive
domains (the “connectivity-constraint hypothesis”; see [31–33]). However, it remains unclear
as to how an unaltered connectivity profile would in turn support compensatory behaviors in
relation to crossmodal processing and reconcile the accumulating evidence of extensive func-
tional reorganization described above. At this juncture, it would be reasonable to posit whether
current views and interpretations are largely driven by focused analytic strategies (i.e. region
of interest rather than a whole brain approaches) and inherent limitations related to data
obtained from independently acquired imaging modalities.
At the regional level, structural morphometry studies of the occipital cortex in blind
humans show evidence of decreased gray matter volume [14, 34–36] as well as concomitant
increases in cortical thickness [34, 37–40]. Findings provided from diffusion based imaging
studies (i.e. diffusion tensor imaging, or DTI) have consistently reported wide spread reduc-
tions in the structural integrity of geniculocalcarine structures and tracts such as the optic radi-
ations [35, 36, 41–44], as well as a general trend of decreased overall connectivity throughout
the brain [43, 45–47]. Analysis based on resting state functional connectivity MRI (rsfcMRI)
has also been used to characterize large-scale functional network properties in the absence of

 task performance [48–50] but with mixed results. This includes reports of enhanced functional
connectivity between occipital areas and other regions of the brain including parietal and fron-
tal areas [23, 47, 51–54] while other studies have suggested patterns of overall decreases in con-
nectivity between occipital areas and somatosensory cortex as well as temporal cortical areas
implicated with auditory processing [23, 31, 53, 55, 56] (see also [57] for recent review). Fur-
thermore, in the case of reported enhanced functional connectivity (e.g. between occipital and
frontal regions), there appears to be a lack of evidence of concomitant increases in white mat-
ter connections that may putatively support crossmodal sensory and cognitive processing.
Certainly, these results continue to raise interesting questions regarding the nature and
extent of neuroplastic changes within the context of profound blindness. However, uncertainty
remains regarding the relationship between changes in brain structure and large-scale changes
in anatomical and functional brain connectivity. This is particularly evident when one consid-
ers that previous imaging studies have usually focused on analyzing one parameter at a time,
thus making reconciliation of observed results across multiple studies particularly challenging.
Given these gaps in our understanding, it would be of value to capture multiple measures of
morphometry, structural, and functional data throughout the brain as a means to better char-
acterize the nature and extent of these changes resulting from visual sensory deprivation.
To our knowledge, no previous study has attempted to address this issue using a compre-
hensive multimodal imaging approach. Here, we investigated potential differences between
early blind and sighted control individuals with respect to morphometry obtained from stan-
dard anatomical MRI, white matter connectivity and integrity obtained by diffusion MRI, as
well as functional connectivity characterized by resting state fMRI. In so doing, we aimed to
examine the interrelationship between these multiple imaging parameters, with particular
attention to structural and functional connectivity.
Materials and methods
Study participants
A total of 28 subjects were recruited for the study and separated into two groups comprised of
12 early blind (6 females, mean age 33.58 years ± 7.51 S.D.) and 16 normally sighted controls
(8 females, mean age 30.44 years ± 5.84 S.D.). Comparing demographic factors between both
groups revealed no statistically significant differences in terms of age (p = 0.26) or gender
(Chi-square = 0.86). For the purposes of this study, we defined “early blind” as documented
residual vision no greater than light perception and/or hand motion acquired prior to the age
of three (i.e. prior to the recall of visual memories and the development of high level language
function; see [58, 59]). While the majority of participants had diagnoses that could be consid-
ered as a “congenital” cause, we relied on documented clinical evidence of profound blindness
based on a structured and functional assessment. The etiologies of blindness were varied and
included retinal dystrophies as well as ocular malformations. However, no single diagnosis
was represented in more than three subjects. All blind participants were highly independent
travelers, employed, college educated, and experienced Braille readers. They were predomi-
nately right handed (based on self-report), but most used two hands for the purposes of reading
Braille text (see Table 1: Subject Demographics for complete details regarding the demographics
of the blind participants). Sighted controls had normal, or corrected-to-normal, visual acuity.
Apart from blindness, the participants had no documented history of neurological abnormali-
ties. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to participation and all
experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Massachusetts
Eye and Ear Infirmary, Boston, MA, USA.

 MRI acquisition
All imaging data were acquired on a 3T Philips Achieva System (Best, the Netherlands) with
an 8-channel phased array coil. Subjects were instructed to lie still and foam padding was used
to minimize head motion. Two structural T1-weighted scans were acquired using a turbo spin
echo sequence (TE = 3.1 ms, TR = 6.8 ms, flip angle = 9˚, voxel size 0.98 x 0.98 x 1.20 mm).
Diffusion based imaging was carried out using high angular resolution diffusion imaging
(HARDI). Images were acquired with a single-shot EPI sequence (TE = 73 ms, TR = 17844 ms,
flip angle 90˚, 64 directions, EPI factor = 59, B0 = 0 s/mm2, Bmax = 3000 s/mm2, voxel size
1.75 x 1.75 x 2.00 mm, enhanced gradients at 66 mT/m, and a slew rate of 100 T/m/ms). Rest-
ing state functional connectivity (rsfcMRI) was acquired with a 7 min single-shot EPI sequence
(TE = 30 ms, TR = 3000 ms, flip angle = 80˚, voxel size 2.75 x 2.75 x 3.00 mm, prospective
motion correction). For the resting state sequence, subjects were blindfolded and instructed to
lie still and let their minds “wander” while remaining awake. Finally, a field map was acquired
to correct for EPI related field inhomogeneities using a fast field echo sequence (TE1 = 2.3 ms,
TE2 = 4.6 ms, TR = 20 ms, flip angle = 10˚, voxel size 1.02 x 1.02 x 3.00 mm).
Data processing
Data processing procedures and analysis workflow for structural morphometry, HARDI-
based tractography, and rsfcfMRI analyses are outlined in Fig 1. Further details are provided
below.
Image preprocessing and surface-based morphometry.
Anatomical T1-weighted scans
were processed using FreeSurfer 5.3.0 (https://surfer/nMR/mgh/harvard.edu). Details regard-
ing this procedure have been described elsewhere [60]. Briefly, two structural T1-weighted
scans were co-registered, intensity normalized, skull stripped, and the gray matter and white
matter surfaces were defined based on intensity gradients. The accuracy of brain extraction
and gray and white matter surfaces were confirmed by visual inspection and manual edits
were applied when necessary. The cortex was parcellated into 68 discrete regions (34 per hemi-
sphere) according to the Desikan atlas [61]. For surface-based analyses, gray matter cortical
thickness and volume were calculated for each vertex. White matter segmentations for HARDI
tractography were estimated 2 mm into the white matter from the gray/white matter boundary
for each of the overlying cortical gray matter parcellations. Subcortical gray matter structures
were also segmented [62, 63]. Volume was calculated for subcortical and white matter regions

 as part of the standard FreeSurfer processing pipeline. As done in previous studies (e.g. [64–
66]), estimated total intracranial volume was also calculated for each subject and mean-cen-
tered (i.e. with respect to the mean of all subjects).
HARDI preprocessing and structural connectivity matrix construction.

connectivity analyses. Following standard preprocessing, gray and white matter were divided into anatomically-derived parcellations
(Desikan atlas). Surface based morphometry (SBM) was used to analyze cortical thickness and volume as well as the volume of
subcortical gray matter and white matter regions. Following preprocessing of HARDI data, the orientation distribution function (ODF) for
each voxel was calculated. The gray and white matter segmentations from the Desikan atlas were transformed into HARDI space and
used as seeds for ROI to ROI tractography. Resting state connectivity data were preprocessed and ROIs from the Desikan atlas were
transformed into rsfcMRI space for each subject and used as seeds for ROI to ROI analysis. For both HARDI and rsfcMRI data,
connectivity matrices for each subject were created from which group average matrices were made.

 orientation distribution function (ODF) was reconstructed in DSI-Studio (http://dsi-studio.
labsolver.org) using generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI) [67] with a diffusion sampling
length ratio of 1.25 and ODF sharpening via decomposition [68]. A decomposition fraction of
0.04 and maximum fiber population of 8 were used. Three fibers per voxel were resolved with an
8-fold ODF tessellation. HARDI data was co-registered to the corresponding T1-weighted struc-
tural image for each subject using boundary-based registration (BBR) in FreeSurfer [69]. Regis-
tration accuracy was verified for each subject by visual inspection and manual corrections were
performed where necessary. Each of the 68 cortical and 68 white matter parcellations [61] for the
T1-weighted image were reverse transformed into subject-specific HARDI space, creating the
seed (start) and target (end) point regions of interests (ROIs) for tractography analysis. An in-
house program utilizing the tractography function from DSI-Studio generated streamlines to
produce a whole brain connectivity matrix symmetrized between each pair of ipsi- and contra-
lateral ROI pairs. A 68 x 68 connectivity matrix was generated using a termination angle of
45˚, subject-specific quantitative anisotropy (QA) threshold (range 0.025 to 0.15, mean 0.054),
smoothing of 0.5, step size 0.5 mm, minimum length = 5 mm, maximum length = 300 mm, ran-
dom fiber direction, Gaussian radial interpolation, and 100,000 seeds. To capture the maximum
possible number of streamlines associated with each cortical region, the start ROI was placed in
the white matter. To ensure that the target cortical region was reached, the end ROI was placed
in gray matter. Any circular fibers were automatically removed as part of the algorithm, as were
tracts that extended beyond the target and seed ROIs. Two areas were considered to be con-
nected if one or more fibers were present between them [70]. Individual subject matrices were
generated for the number of streamlines/fibers between ROIs as well as average QA for each con-
nection. Similar to the fractional anisotropy (FA) measure obtained in DTI, QA is an analogous
metric obtained with HARDI and is an indicator of overall white matter structural integrity [67].
Average QA was calculated by sampling the HARDI maps at each step of the selected streamline.
rsfcMRI preprocessing and connectivity matrix generation.
Resting state data was pre-
processed with FEAT v. 6.00 (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool) from FSL. Preprocessing steps
included removal of non-brain tissue using BET, B0 unwarping in the -x direction, and motion
correction using MCFLIRT. To further control for the effects of motion, 6 motion covariates
and their temporal derivatives were regressed out of the resting state signal, discarding any
motion outlier data. Prior to applying motion correction, individual head movement was
quantified and visually assessed for each subject. No subjects exceeded 0.27 mm absolute or
relative motion (frame to frame measure of displacement), which was well below the acquired
voxel size of 3 mm. Subsequent analysis confirmed that there were no statistically significant
differences in head motion between the two groups (mean sighted controls = 0.10 mm abso-
lute, 0.08 mm relative and mean early blind = 0.15 mm absolute, 0.11 mm relative; p>0.05).
rsfcMRI data were co-registered using BBR [69] to the anatomical T1-weighted scan. Cortical
parcellations [61] were reverse transformed into subject-specific rsfcMRI space. An in-house
MATLAB program was used to calculate temporal partial correlations between ROIs. A high
pass filter of 0.01 Hz and a low pass filter of 0.1 Hz were applied. Data were also de-trended
and Fischer’s z-transformed to ensure normality. Similar to HARDI data, a 68 x 68 symme-
trized connectivity matrix was generated for each subject whereby the z-transformed correla-
tion coefficient between each parcellated region (node) was stored at a unique position in the
matrix and representing the functional connectivity strength between nodes.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses on surface based morphometry was carried out at two levels. First, an
exploratory analysis regarding potential group differences in cortical thickness and volume

 were evaluated using a significance threshold of p<0.005 (two-tailed, uncorrected) as was
done in previous studies (e.g. [14, 40]). Volume measures were corrected for mean-centered
intra-cranial volume to account for the potential effect of head size (e.g. [64–66]). A second
level of analysis was performed by fitting a general linear model (GLM) in FreeSurfer. A series
of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations were then performed on the resulting data using a vertex-
size threshold of p<0.005 and a cluster-wise threshold of p<0.05. For both levels of group
comparisons, individual surfaces were registered to standard space and spatially smoothed
using a Gaussian kernel of 5 mm full width half maximum (FWHM). The volume of each sub-
cortical or white matter region was corrected using residuals of intra-cranial volume (e.g [71–
73]). Differences between groups in subcortical and white matter volume were analyzed using
SAS (University Edition).
To assess differences in connectivity (HARDI and rsfcMRI) between individuals in the sighted
and blind groups, a two-sample t-test was performed for each connection between pairs of ROIs.
This resulted in a total of 2278 (i.e. 68 X 67/2 = 2278) connections. A False Discovery Rate (FDR)
analysis was performed at a rate of q = 0.05 to correct for multiple comparisons within the struc-
tural and functional connectivity matrices [74] as previously done in past studies [75, 76].
As a final analysis, a Pearson’s r-coefficient was used to determine the degree of association
between the acquired measures of structural (number of fibers obtained by HARDI) and func-
tional (partial correlations obtained by rsfcMRI) connectivity. Prior to correlation analyses,
HARDI matrices were z-transformed to ensure normality. Correlations between early blind
and sighted control subjects for both white matter fiber number and resting state connectivity
were examined separately. Finally, to explore if alterations in the profile of white matter con-
nectivity were related to alterations in the profile of resting state functional connectivity, cor-
relations were determined between changes in structural connectivity (i.e. early blind and
sighted controls) with changes in functional connectivity (i.e. early blind and sighted controls).
For this correlation analysis, the difference between groups was calculated by subtracting the
mean sighted control connectivity data from the mean ocular blind connectivity data (sepa-
rately for HARDI and for rsfcMRI data). These difference matrices were z-transformed prior
to the final correlation analysis.
Construction of circular connectograms
The term connectome has been used to refer to the development of comprehensive maps charac-
terizing neural connections within the brain [77]. In this study, we employed the circular con-
nectogram to depict large-scale structural and functional connectivity patterns in early blind and
sighted controls as well as differences between these two groups. The format is based on the
freely available Circos software ([78]; http://www.circos.ca/) and processing pipelines adapted
for neuroimaging data have been previously explained in detail [79]. Briefly, the circular connec-
togram design allows for the depiction of regional structural and inter-regional connectivity
data within the same two-dimensional graphical representation. The circular layout facilitates
the display of relationships between pairs of positions by using color coded links (in the case of
HARDI and rsfcMRI connectivity data) and heat maps (in the case of morphometry data) pre-
sented along a circular array of radially aligned cortical parcellations (the “connectogram” [79];).
Results
Surface-based morphometry
An initial exploratory analysis (uncorrected, p<0.005) revealed widespread differences (i.e.
trends of both increases and decreases) in cortical volume throughout both hemispheres when
comparing early blind to sighted controls. Specifically, clusters showing increases in cortical

 volume were observed bilaterally in the temporal, frontal, cingulate, and motor (i.e. precentral
gyrus) cortices, as well as the right parietal cortex. Decreases in cortical volume in early blind
were more widespread and clusters showing decreases in volume were observed bilaterally in
the occipital, temporal, parietal, and frontal, as well as the left cingulate and sensorimotor (i.e.
pre-and post-central gyri) cortices (p<0.005 uncorrected). In the subsequent analysis, only
two of these clusters survived correction for multiple comparisons. Specifically, a significant
decrease in volume of the left pericalcarine cortex (p = 0.0066) and a significant increase in
volume of the right inferior parietal cortex (p = 0.0032) was evident when comparing early
blind to sighted controls (Table 2: Surface Based Morphometry Analysis (corrected); see also
supplementary materials 1).
Trends for widespread increases and decreases in cortical thickness were also observed fol-
lowing the initial exploratory analysis. Specifically, clusters showing increased cortical thick-
ness in the ocular blind compared to sighted controls was observed bilaterally in the occipital,
temporal, and parietal lobes. Clusters showing decreased cortical thickness in the ocular blind
were observed bilaterally in the occipital, temporal, frontal, and parietal lobes (p<0.005 un-
corrected). However, the only cluster to survive correction for multiple comparisons was a sig-
nificant decrease observed in the left fusiform gyrus (Table 2: Surface Based Morphometry
Analysis (corrected); see also S1 Fig).
Exploratory analysis (uncorrected, p<0.005) of changes in white matter volume revealed
that early blind subjects showed decreases compared to sighted controls within occipital
regions including bilateral pericalcarine, cuneus, and lingual cortices, as well as the right lateral
occipital region. There was no significant trend for relative increases in white matter volume
in blind subjects compared to controls.
Finally, comparing subcortical structures (specifically, the hippocampus, amygdala, cau-
date, and putamen) did not reveal statistically significant differences between early blind and
sighted controls (all p>0.005). Complete results from the morphometric analyses (uncor-
rected) are reported in S1 Table.
HARDI white matter structural connectivity
Exploratory analysis of ROI-pairs revealed a number of connections that differed significantly
in early blind subjects compared to sighted controls (p<0.05). Specifically, increased connec-
tivity (indexed by fiber number) in early blind compared to sighted was observed for bilateral
intra-hemispheric and inter-hemispheric connections involving temporal, parietal, and frontal
lobes, as well as the left occipital and sensorimotor cortices (Fig 2A). Five of these connections

dent between temporal and frontal regions, as well as between primary motor and the precu-
neus (Fig 2B). Exploratory analysis also revealed a number of connections showing decreased
fiber number in the ocular blind group compared to controls throughout the entire cortex.
These were inter- and bilateral intra-hemispheric connections involving the occipital, tempo-
ral, parietal, frontal, cingulate, and sensori-motor cortices (Fig 2A). Decreased connectivity
was observed between 18 connections after FDR correction for multiple comparisons. These
were equally distributed across both hemispheres. Within the left hemisphere, and the major-
ity of decreases involved the frontal lobe (e.g. frontal to primary sensory, fronto-frontal,

 decreased structural connectivity in early blind was noticed between the occipital lobe and cin-
gulate cortex. Additional decreases included right intrahemsipheric connections also impli-
cated the frontal lobes (e.g. occipito-frontal and frontal-cingulate) as well as the sensori-motor

 blind compared to sighted for bilateral intra-hemispheric connections involving the occipital,
temporal, parietal, frontal, and cingulate cortices. Additional inter-hemispheric increases in
QA were also observed, however these were less numerous than intra-hemispheric increases.
Increased QA was observed in five connections following FDR correction for multiple com-
parisons. Increases in QA in the early blind compared to sighted were mainly left lateralized
involving fronto-temporal and temporal-temporal white matter connections. Exploratory anal-
ysis also revealed a number of connections showing decreases in QA in early blind compared to
sighted subjects (p<0.05). These were equally distributed between inter-and intra-hemispheric
connections and involved occipital, temporal, parietal, frontal, and cingulate cortices. Decreased
QA was observed in 14 connections after FDR correction for multiple comparisons. Decreases
in QA included the interhemispheric connections between the occipital lobes through the sple-
nium were among those that survived FDR correction. Further decreases surviving FDR correc-
tion included the left occipito-cingulate, left entorhinal to insula, as well as right lingual to
parahippocampal gyrus, and right entorhinal to precentral gyrus (see S2 Fig and S2 Table for a
complete description of connections surviving FDR correction relating to QA).
Resting state functional connectivity
Similar to the results obtained regarding white matter connectivity, an exploratory analysis of
ROI-pairs of the rsfcMRI data also revealed a mixture of widespread increases and decreases of
functional connectivity between the two groups of interest (p<0.05). Notably, increases in
temporal correlations in early blind compared to sighted involved bilateral intra-hemispheric
occipital, temporal, and frontal connections, as well as inter-hemispheric connections involv-
ing the occipital, temporal, frontal, and sensori-motor cortices (Fig 3A). Of the observed
increases in functional connectivity, only two survived FDR correction for multiple compari-
sons. Specifically, these were temporal correlations between the right pars orbitalis and the
right middle temporal lobe, and between the left pars orbitalis and the right transverse tempo-
ral gyrus (i.e. Heschl’s gyrus) (Fig 3B).
In the exploratory analysis, there was an overall greater trend for decreases rather than
increases in temporal correlations between regions when comparing early blind to sighted. In
particular, bilateral intra-hemispheric and inter-hemispheric connections involving the occipi-
tal, temporal, frontal, parietal, cingulate, and sensorimotor cortices (Fig 3A). Of the observed
decreases in functional connectivity, a total of 22 survived FDR correction for multiple com-
parisons. Specifically, these involved bilateral decreases in connections between the lingual
gyrus and primary somatosensory (i.e. post/paracentral gyri) cortex. Further decreases were
observed between the right primary somatosensory cortex (i.e. post/paracentral gyri) and
areas of the temporal lobe involved with spatial navigation and face recognition, namely the
parahippocampal and fusiform gyri. Other notable inter-hemispheric decreases in functional
connectivity were observed between occipital and sensorimotor regions, occipital and frontal
regions, as well as between temporal (primarily fusiform and parahippocampal gyri) and sen-
sorimotor areas. A listing of all significant connections following FDR correction can be found
in Table 4: rsfcMRI Functional Connectivity (corrected).
Correlation between white matter and functional connectivity
As a final analysis, the degree of association characterizing structural connectivity (i.e. white
mater fiber number obtained by HARDI) and functional connectivity (i.e. partial correlations
obtained by rsfcMRI) between early blind and sighted controls was independently determined.
Regarding white matter structural connectivity, the measure of association was found to be
very high (r = 0.9512; p<0.0001) (Fig 4A upper panel). Similarly, the measure of association

 for resting state functional connectivity was also found to be very high (r = 0.8623; p<0.0001)
(Fig 4A lower panel). Secondly, the degree of association between measured changes in struc-
tural connectivity and changes in functional connectivity between early blind and sighted
controls was also determined. In this latter analysis, correlations on differences (i.e. early
blind minus sighted controls) between early blind compared to sighted controls for both struc-
tural connectivity and functional connectivity were not statistically significant (r = -0.008,
p = 0.5843) (Fig 4B).
Fig 3. Functional connectivity revealed by rsfcMRI. A) Exploratory analysis (uncorrected; p<0.05) of ROI-pairs revealed widespread differences in
functional connectivity between early blind and sighted control individuals. While patterns of increases and decreases in functional connectivity were evident,
the overall trend was for a decrease in resting state temporal correlations in early blind compared to sighted controls. This included between occipital-motor
regions, occipital somatosensory connections, as well as decreases in occipito-frontal and occipito-memory-related structures. Increases in functional
connectivity were evident bilaterally between occipital regions and the pars orbitalis in the inferior frontal lobe. Bilateral increases involving the pars orbitalis
were also observed to portions of the temporal lobe involved with auditory processing (namely, the transverse temporal, banks of the superior temporal
sulcus, superior temporal, and middle temporal cortices). B) Ball and stick representation of increases and decreases in resting state connectivity between
early ocular blind and sighted controls following FDR correction. Differences in connectivity strength are represented by line thickness, whereby thicker lines

showed an increase in functional connectivity after FDR correction (upper panel). These were between right transverse temporal and left pars orbitalis, as well
as the right middle temporal and right pars orbitalis. A total of 22 connections showing a decrease in functional connectivity survived correction (lower panel).
These were mainly inter-hemispheric and occipital connections were centered around the fusiform gyrus, orbitofrontal regions, and sensorimotor cortices.

 In the early blind, visual inspection of the average group map revealed a trend for increased
parietal-frontal white matter connections within the left hemisphere (Fig 5A). In contrast,
sighted controls showed a trend for greater interhemispheric functional connectivity, particu-
larly between occipital-occipital, cingulate-cingulate, and parietal-parietal cortices (Fig 5B).
Group differences in morphometry and connectivity were more evident using differential
maps illustrating relative increases (Fig 5C) and relative decreases (Fig 5D) in early blind as
compared to sighted controls. Specifically, increased number in white matter connections in
the early blind (blue lines) were evident between occipital regions and parietal and temporal
(predominately intrahemispheric with greater white matter connectivity evident within the left
hemisphere). The greatest increases in white matter connectivity were between left parietal
(precuneus) and precentral cortices as well as left temporal (fusiform and superior temporal)
and frontal cortices (lateral orbital frontal and rostral middle frontal respectively). Increases in
functional connectivity (intra- and interhemispheric) were also evident between occipital and
other cortical areas (i.e. cingulate, frontal, and temporal cortices; indicated by red lines). The
greatest increases (dark red lines) in functional connectivity were observed between bilateral
pars orbitalis of the inferior frontal gyrus and the temporal and parietal lobes (specifically left
superior temporal, right middle and transverse temporal, and the left supramarginal gyrus).
The observed increases in cortical thickness in left lateral occipital cortex as well as additional

 increases in cortical thickness and volume are shown within the inner rings. In contrast, trends
for overall decreases in white matter and functional connectivity in the early blind appeared to
be largely inter-hemispheric. The most significant decreases in structural connectivity in early
blind compared to sighted controls were observed between interhemispheric occipital regions
(dark blue lines), as well as between the right precentral (i.e. motor) and entorhinal cortices.
Regions showing multiple (i.e. � four) significant changes in functional connectivity (dark red
lines) included the right medial orbitofrontal cortex, paracentral lobe, and parahippocampus,
as well as the left superior parietal and fusiform cortices, and the bilateral lingual gyrus. Finally,

 corresponding differences in gray and white matter morphometry between early blind and
sighted controls can also be easily visualized confirming an overall trend for decreases in mor-
phometry measures rather than increases (inner rings).
Discussion
Overview of results
In this study, we employed a multimodal MR-based imaging approach to provide multiple
lines of evidence consistent with extensive morphological, structural, and functional reorgani-
zation within the brain and in the setting of early onset and profound ocular blindness. These
observed changes were widely distributed, implicating areas responsible for the processing of
intact sensory modalities (such as touch and hearing), occipital cortical regions (normally
implicated in the processing of visual information), and regions involved in higher order cog-
nitive functions (such as language, memory, and executive functions).
In summary, outcomes of morphometry in early blind compared to sighted controls
revealed co-occurring decreases in cortical volume and cortical thickness within visual pro-
cessing areas of the occipital and temporal cortices respectively. Increases in cortical volume in
the early blind were evident within regions of parietal cortex (corrected results). White matter
connectivity in the blind was increased predominantly within the left hemisphere, including
between frontal and temporal areas implicated with language processing. Decreases in struc-
tural connectivity were evident involving frontal and somatosensory regions as well as between
occipital and cingulate cortices. Changes in white matter integrity (as indexed by QA) were
also in general agreement with observed pattern changes in the number of white matter fibers.
Analysis of resting state sequences revealed patterns of increased connectivity between tempo-
ral and inferior frontal areas in the blind while decreases in functional connectivity were
observed between occipital and frontal and somatosensory-motor areas and between temporal
(mainly fusiform and parahippocampus) and parietal, frontal, and other temporal areas.
Finally, correlations in white matter connectivity and functional connectivity observed
between early blind and sighted controls showed an overall high degree of association. How-
ever, comparing the relative changes in white matter and functional connectivity between
early blind and sighted controls did not show a significant correlation.
While extensive differences were observed along all three MRI-based modalities, the most
notable finding was the evidence of increased inter- and intrahemispheric white matter con-
nectivity in blind individuals. Taken together, the combination of these morphological, struc-
tural, and functional connectivity changes may underlie the neurophysiological substrate that
supports crossmodal sensory processing and compensatory behaviors observed in individuals
who are blind.
Relationship to previous studies
Morphological changes in gray and white matter as well as subcortical structures have been
investigated previously by a number of groups. In general, our differences in morphological
findings from the exploratory analysis are in agreement with previous studies using both vol-
ume and surface based morphometry approaches investigating cortical and subcortical mor-
phometry. We observed trends for co-occurring decreased cortical volume and increased
cortical thickness within occipital cortex in the blind as compared to sighted controls as
reported by other groups [34, 37–40, 80]. Specifically, we found increased occipital cortical
thickness within the left lingual gyrus and bilateral lateral occipital regions [37, 39, 40],
although these increases in cortical thickness did not survive correction for multiple compari-
sons in our sample. For areas that did survive correction for multiple comparisons, we found

 decreased cortical volume with pericalcarine calcarine cortex and decreased cortical thickness
in fusiform cortex. A concomitant increase in volume with inferior parietal cortex was also
noted. The observed decreased cortical and white matter volume within pericalcarine can be
interpreted within the context of geniculo-calcarine transneuronal degeneration ([39]; see
below for further discussion). However, the significance of morphological changes in higher
order regions are less clear at this time. This is also of particular interest given the purported
roles of these areas in the sighted namely; fusiform gyrus in face recognition [81] and inferior
parietal cortex implicated in visual control of action [82].
Notably, we did not find statistically significant differences between both groups with
regards to the morphometry of subcortical structures (including the hippocampus, amygdala,
caudate, and putamen) although a previous group of studies did report increased hippocampal
volume in the blind [35, 83, 84]. However, closer examination of these studies revealed that
increases in volume were specific to the anterior (head) of the right hippocampus (with no
changes in the body or tail) in one study [83] and decreases in the posterior right hippocampus
in another study [85]. In our study, the hippocampus was segmented and measured as a single
unit. Thus, it is possible that methodological differences may explain the observed discrepancy.
In contrast to previous reports, we found evidence of both significant increases and decreases
in white matter connectivity (both inter- and intrahemispheric) in the blind compared to
sighted controls. The vast majority of prior studies have highlighted evidence of marked reduc-
tions in the structural volume of numerous brain areas, and in particular, geniculocalcarine
structures and tracts including the optic radiations [35, 36, 41, 42, 44]. Furthermore, decreases
in overall FA within occipital cortical areas [42, 43, 86] have also been reported. These decreases
in structural volume and integrity have been interpreted within the context of volumetric reduc-
tions observed within occipital cortical areas, possibly consistent with geniculo-calcarine trans-
neuronal degeneration [39]. In contrast, the only reports of increases in white matter volume
were observed in sensorimotor cortex [87] and evidence of increased white matter integrity
within the cortical spinal tract [88]. Regional changes were also reported within the corpus col-
losum [35, 44]. Using a whole brain analysis approach, Shu and colleagues (2009) (employing
DTI) reported an overall decrease in white matter connectivity in the blind including connec-
tions between occipital and inferior frontal areas [43, 86]. However, evidence of increased con-
nectivity was observed within regions implicated with sensorimotor functioning [43]. In
another study, Wang and colleagues (2013) compared changes in FA between congenital and
late blind (i.e. after 18 years of age) individuals as well as in sighted controls [47], confirming
findings of overall reduced white matter integrity within the optic radiations. However,
increased FA was found within the corticospinal tracts in both blind groups as compared to
sighted controls [47]. Finally, Reislev and colleagues (2016) used anatomical connectivity map-
ping based on DTI data obtained from congenitally blind subjects and found reduced anatomi-
cal connectivity in the splenium and mid-body of the corpus callosum, as well as decreased FA
in the cortical spinal tract with no further evidence of increased anatomical connectivity [46].
As opposed to these aforementioned studies employing DTI, our study concentrated on
white matter whole-brain connectivity patterns reconstructed by diffusion data acquired by
HARDI. Using fiber number as the main outcome of interest, we found evidence of both
increases and decreases in white matter connectivity in the blind compared to sighted controls.
These observed white matter changes were also supported by analyzing an index of white mat-
ter structural integrity: quantitative anisotropy (QA). In particular, we found evidence of
increased connections involving superior temporal cortex; a region of the brain that is
involved in spatial awareness [89].
The reason for our ability to observe both significant increases and decreases in white mat-
ter connectivity (as opposed to only decreases as in previous studies) can likely be explained by
Neuroplastic changes in blindness

 the variant of the diffusion MRI approach used in this study. In contrast to previous studies
carried out with blind individuals, we employed HARDI rather than DTI to characterize white
matter connectivity and integrity. While both techniques provide information regarding the
degree of water diffusivity in the brain in order to derive local axonal fiber orientation, DTI is
unable to correctly resolve multiple individual orientations within the same voxel such as
crossing fibers (note that it has estimated that one third of white matter voxels may be affected
by this issue; see [90]). In contrast, HARDI collects diffusion weighted images with many
more gradient directions (i.e. 64) compared to the minimum of six required for DTI. As such,
it has become increasingly established that HARDI is superior to DTI in its ability to delineate
crossing fibers and ultimately the overall microarchitecture of the brain [91–93].
Finally, with regards to resting state functional connectivity, our results are in general agree-
ment with previous findings reporting patterns of both increases and decreases in connectivity
in the blind. In a recent study, Burton and colleagues (2014) found evidence of decreased func-
tional connectivity between occipital cortex and auditory as well as somatosensory cortices in
early blind individuals as compared to normally sighted controls. In contrast, increased func-
tional connectivity was reported between occipital and frontal cortical areas (specifically, dorso-
lateral prefrontal cortex) along with parietal regions of the brain [55]. Enhanced functional
connectivity between occipital and frontal cortical areas implicated with executive control was
reported, particularly with regards to working memory function (i.e. medial supplementary
motor areas and prefrontal cortices, precentral sulcus, inferior frontal gyrus as well as superior
frontal sulcus) [94]. Interestingly, we also noted increased functional connectivity between
occipital structures and the frontal cortex (specifically, bilateral pars orbitalis in the inferior
frontal gyrus) in our exploratory analysis. However, we observed decreased functional connec-
tivity between occipital and somatosensory cortex and the medial orbitofrontal cortex after cor-
rection for multiple comparisons. Occipital connections to the medial orbitofrontal and the
somatosensory cortices also showed decreased structural connectivity in our exploratory analy-
sis, however these did not survive correction for multiple comparisons.
Interpretation of findings within the context of neuroplasticity
As mentioned earlier, there has been considerable interest in relating compensatory behaviors
in blind individuals within the context of observed structural and functional neuroplastic
changes in the brain. While compensatory abilities in the blind have been reported across a
wide variety of behavioral tasks and implicating different sensory modalities, it is important to
note that these abilities are not universally evident across the blind population. Indeed, while
there is evidence of enhanced sensory and cognitive task performance, there are also other
reports suggesting that the blind are equal or even impaired on certain tasks compared to the
their sighted counterparts [12, 13, 95]. This suggests that the absence of visual experience can
induce either sensory compensation or the absence of calibration depending of the task-cogni-
tive domain at play [96] (see also [53] for further discussion). Specifically, comparable (or even
superior) perceptual and cognitive processing abilities in the blind (through the use of intact
sensory modalities) would be in line with a “compensatory” hypothesis of neuroplasticity. If
indeed adaptive behaviors observed in the blind are intimately related to changes in the overall
structural and functional organization of the brain, evidence of increased morphological
changes (e.g. gray matter volume or structural hypertrophy) and connectivity (white matter
projections and functional connectivity) may be indicative of enhanced organization and facil-
itation of information processing occurring locally and/or between remote brain regions [97].
In light of this view, neuroplastic changes may be indicative of enhanced coordination between
functional systems associated with heightened task performance. Our observation of enhanced
Neuroplastic changes in blindness

 intra- and interhemispheric white matter connectivity would be in line with evidence support-
ing the compensatory hypothesis. In contrast, impairment of perceptual performance and/or a
lack of compensatory behaviors would be consistent with a “general loss” hypothesis. This in
turn would be linked with potential decreases in brain morphometric and connectivity indices.
In the same way, blind individuals with impaired crossmodal sensory and/or higher order cog-
nitive functions may be explained within the context of associated decreases in morphometric
and connectivity measures. Evidence of combined increases and decreases in functional con-
nectivity throughout the brain (obtained from rsfcMRI) was also observed. This may be fur-
ther suggestive of mixed compensatory and general loss mechanisms.
Reconciliation of multimodal imaging results
In this study, we acquired spatially co-registered data from three MRI-based modalities; struc-
tural morphometry, HARDI, and resting state. When comparing across modalities, it is perhaps
surprising to find evidence of inconsistencies between increased white matter connections and
decreased functional connectivity in early blind and sighted individuals. In other words, while
we observed increases in white matter connectivity in the blind, these connections were not
always associated with concomitant enhancement in functional connectivity.
The reason for this apparent mismatch is not entirely clear at this time. However, such
incongruities in observed structural and functional connectivity have been previously noted. A
classic example is the evidence of strong interhemispheric functional connectivity between pri-
mary visual cortices despite a lack of direct white matter links between these same two regions
[98]. While the interdependency between structural and functional connectivity is not yet well
understood, it is also important to note that functional connectivity is largely a statistical con-
cept (i.e. the temporal correlation of spatially remote signals as derived from fMRI based tech-
niques; [99]). In contrast, anatomical connectivity describes physical pathways of information
exchange between neural units. At the same time, anatomical connectivity derived from diffu-
sion-based approaches does not speak to the temporal relationship between two structurally
connected areas. Furthermore, the degree of functional connectivity is related to all the direct
and indirect structural connections between the elements of a system. Thus, while strong func-
tional connectivity between two areas may be suggestive of strong structural connectivity, it
does not necessarily mean that the two areas are directly connected [100].
Recent work has also highlighted important differences in functional connectivity derived
from resting state sequences with that of functional connectivity that characterizes task-spe-
cific activity. More specifically, it has been suggested in a number of reports that differences in
connectivity patterns between populations are task dependent [101–103] and that task related
and resting state functional connectivity in fact do not coincide. This provides further caution
against inferring differences in functional integration between brain regions solely based on
resting-state data. In this direction, it has been shown that whole-brain functional connectivity
networks can fundamentally change in different task contexts (e.g. [104–106]), and thus are
not constrained by networks identified solely by resting-state analyses. By extrapolation, white
matter connectivity may perhaps be reflected by measures of effective connectivity (e.g.
dynamic causal modeling; [107]). It has been demonstrated that changes in functional connec-
tivity between occipital and temporal regions in blind individuals are indeed task dependent;
while occipito-temporal connectivity at rest is typically lower in early blind [55], the connectiv-
ity between the exact same regions is higher in the blind while involved in a challenging audi-
tory task [108].
To help resolve these inconsistencies, further studies should compare metrics of brain
structure, white matter structural connectivity, along with measures of effective connectivity as

 well as individual parametric measures of behavioral performance. Again, by leveraging the
advantages of multi-modal imaging, we are more likely to better understand how structure,
connectivity, and behavior are reciprocally linked.

multiple comparisons). Decreases in cortical volume (shown in blue) were evident within the
left pericalcalcarine region, while increases (shown in red) were evident in right inferior parie-
tal cortex. Decreases in cortical thickness were observed within left fusiform cortex (shown in
blue). Differences in white matter volume and subcortical structures were not significant fol-

ues revealed by HARDI. A) Exploratory analysis of ROI-pairs revealed an overall tendency for
both increases and decreases in QA in ocular blind compared to sighted controls. Decreases
were spread throughout both inter- and intra-hemispheric connections, whereas increases in
QA were primarily limited to inter-hemispheric connections. B) Ball and stick representation
of increases (upper panel) and decreases (lower panel) in QA values between early blind and
sighted controls after FDR correction. Differences in connection strength are represented by
line thickness, whereby thicker lines represent larger changes in the early blind group (based
on p-value). Increases in QA in the early blind group are represented by orange lines, whereas
decreases in QA in the ocular blind are represented by cyan lines. Dark blue spheres represent
the nodes (i.e. ROIs) associated with the start and/or end points of the connections. Note the
overall similarity to the pattern presented for white matter connectivity (fiber number) shown
