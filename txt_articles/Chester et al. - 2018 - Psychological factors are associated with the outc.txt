outcome of physiotherapy for people with shoulder
pain: a multicentre longitudinal cohort study

ABSTRACT
Background/aim Shoulder pain is a major
musculoskeletal problem. We aimed to identify which
baseline patient and clinical characteristics are associated
with a better outcome, 6 weeks and 6 months after
starting a course of physiotherapy for shoulder pain.
Methods 1030 patients aged ≥18 years referred to
physiotherapy for the management of musculoskeletal
shoulder pain were recruited and provided baseline data.
840 (82%) provided outcome data at 6 weeks and 811
(79%) at 6 months. 71 putative prognostic factors were
collected at baseline. Outcomes were the Shoulder Pain
and Disability Index (SPADI) and Quick Disability of the
Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire. Multivariable
linear regression was used to analyse prognostic factors
associated with outcome.
Results Parameter estimates (β) are presented for the
untransformed SPADI at 6 months, a negative value
indicating less pain and disability. 4 factors were
associated with better outcomes for both measures and
time points: lower baseline disability (β=−0.32, 95% CI
−0.23 to −0.40), patient expectation of ‘complete
recovery’ compared to ‘slight improvement’ as ‘a result
of physiotherapy’ (β=−12.43, 95% CI −8.20 to
−16.67), higher pain self-efficacy (β=−0.36, 95% CI
−0.50 to −0.22) and lower pain severity at rest
(β=−1.89, 95% CI −1.26 to −2.51).
Conclusions Psychological factors were consistently
associated with patient-rated outcome, whereas clinical
examination findings associated with a specific structural
diagnosis were not. When assessing people with
musculoskeletal shoulder pain and considering referral to
physiotherapy services, psychosocial and medical
information should be considered.

INTRODUCTION
First episode of shoulder pain accounts for nearly
1.5% of visits to the general practitioner (GP) annu-
ally within the UK.1 2 This represents a considerable
burden, with up to 48% of patients visiting their GP
more than once due to the ongoing shoulder pain.1 2
As most treatment options have equivocal effective-
ness,3 4 doctors and patients face uncertainty when
deciding on the most appropriate form of manage-
ment. Non-surgical treatment is typically the first-line
management,4 5 with the majority of referrals direc-
ted to physiotherapy services.1 6 Although this repre-
sents up to 14% of referrals to UK outpatient
physiotherapy services each year,7 there is no clear
and current guidance as to (1) which patients with
shoulder problems should be referred and (2) which
clinical and psychosocial factors are associated with
better or worse outcomes.
Prognostic factors associated with the outcome
of physiotherapy for shoulder pain are unclear, and
currently cannot support clinical decision-making.8
Our previous review highlighted the need for an
adequately sized study to investigate a wider range
of biopsychosocial variables as potential prognostic
factors. This is needed as the optimal treatment for
shoulder pain remains unclear.9
The objective of this multicentre longitudinal
cohort study was to identity which patient and clin-
ical characteristics, commonly assessed at the first
physiotherapy appointment, were associated with
patient-rated
shoulder
pain
and
function,
at
6 weeks and 6 months.
METHODS
Study design and participants
The study protocol for this multicentre longitudinal
cohort study has been published in detail else-
where,10 and is summarised here. Patients referred
to physiotherapy for the management of musculo-
skeletal shoulder pain at 11 NHS trusts and social
enterprises in the East of England were recruited to
the study between November 2011 and October
2013.
Participating
physiotherapy
departments
were located within primary and secondary care.
A postal invitation was sent to the patients whose
referral to physiotherapy indicated that they may be
eligible for the study. Patients were eligible if they
were aged 18 years or older and described shoulder
or arm pain aggravated by shoulder movements.
Patients with significant reproduction of shoulder
pain on spinal movement, or greater reproduction on
spinal movement compared to shoulder movement,
were excluded from the study. Patients with the fol-
lowing aetiology for shoulder pain were excluded:
radiculopathy, postsurgery, postfracture, posttraumatic
dislocation or systemic source. Participants provided
written informed consent at their first physiotherapy
appointment. Patients who decided not to participate
in the study, or did not respond to later follow-ups,
were not required to provide a reason.
Data collection
Data for 71 putative prognostic factors, determined
and defined a priori, were collected from each par-
ticipant and their physiotherapist. Summary base-
line characteristics are presented in table 1. See
online supplementary files S1–3 for the full list of
putative prognostic factors. These were identified
and selected from our literature review of previous
studies of prognostic factors for the physiotherapy

 management of shoulder pain,8 prognostic factors documented
for other management approaches11 or musculoskeletal areas
and workshops with participating clinicians, and patient and
public representatives during protocol development. There was
no convincing evidence from previous studies that psychological
measures were associated with outcome for our specific popula-
tion.8 This was in contrast to studies which included popula-
tions with low back pain12 13 or general upper quadrant and/or
cervical pain.14 15 Patient expectation was included as it is asso-
ciated with outcome in the wider medical field.16 Measurement
tools were selected from a broad range of sources,17–19 while
minimising excessive participant and physiotherapist burden.
Prior to the first physiotherapy appointment, participants
completed a bespoke questionnaire. At the first appointment,
using standardised clinical data forms, physiotherapists recorded
the history of the participant’s shoulder problem and clinical
examination findings. At discharge, physiotherapists recorded
details of treatment and attendance on a standardised clinical
data
form.
The
delivery
and
content
of
treatment
were
unaffected by participation in the study.
Participants were sent a postal follow-up questionnaire,
6 weeks and 6 months after starting their course of physiother-
apy. This included two validated patient-reported outcome mea-
sures also collected at baseline: the Shoulder Pain and Disability
Index (SPADI)20
21 and the Quick Disability of the Arm,
Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire (QuickDASH).22 Scores for
these outcomes are expressed as a percentage, where zero repre-
sents no pain or disability and 100% represents maximum pain
and disability. The participants did not have access to the
responses they provided at baseline or at 6-week follow-up.
Participants were also asked to return details of exercise adher-
ence, recorded using a paper diary supplied at their first physio-
therapy
appointment,
and
provide
details
of
any
other
interventions they may have received. T
o maximise response
rates, non-responders at each time point were sent a maximum
of two reminders to return their questionnaires.

 Statistical analysis
Using the approach suggested by Lipsitz and Parzen,23 based on
analysis with a general linear model, 780 participants provided
90% statistical power to detect an effect size of <0.25 SDs
adjusted for other variables with a coefficient of determination
(ie, R2) with the outcome of up to 0.5. Therefore, 1000 partici-
pants were allowed for up to 22% loss to follow-up and this
was the target sample size. All the participants providing
outcome data at 6 weeks and/or 6 months were included in the
analysis for that time point, whether or not they had completed
their course of physiotherapy. Missing data at one time point
were not imputed from other time points. All statistical analyses
were carried out in STATAV
.12.
For each outcome (the SPADI and QuickDASH) and time
point (6 weeks and 6 months), general linear models were
constructed. These were constructed with and without the
inclusion of baseline SPADI and QuickDASH values. Also, as
the residuals were not normally distributed, a logit transform-
ation was applied to the outcomes and the transformed data
were also modelled. For ease of clinical interpretation, the
parameter estimates presented here are for the untransformed
models.
Initially, all putative prognostic variables were singularly
entered into simple linear regression models. Those with a stat-
istically significant relationship with the outcome, at the 10%
level, were entered into a multivariable linear regression model. A
stepwise selection process, based on change in scaled deviance,
was then applied. The explanatory variable with the least signifi-
cant p Value was removed. This process was continued until
all the remaining variables had regression coefficients significant
at the 5% level (ie, p<0.05). Each variable removed on backward
elimination was then individually re-entered and remained in
the model if it attained a statistical significance of 5%.
This process was carried out for each of the nine subgroups
of variables indicated in online supplementary files S1–3. The
explanatory variables in these models were then forwarded for
inclusion in a final model. Factors that were not significant in
group models, but had been associated with outcome at other
time points, in other studies, or were considered key prognostic
factors associated with outcome for other musculoskeletal
regions, were also entered. The process of backward elimination
and forward selection was repeated as above. The adjusted coef-
ficient of determination (R2), a proportional measure indicating
the amount of variation in outcome explained by the models, is
presented.
Logistic regression was used to compare consenters with non-
consenters, and the characteristics of participants who provided
and did not provide outcome data. Adjusted odds ratio (OR)
with 95% CIs are presented for statistically significant differ-
ences at p≤0.05.
RESULTS
One thousand and fifty-five participants were recruited and con-
sented to be in the study, 1030 of whom were eligible, provided
adequate baseline data and were included in the study. Details
of patient characteristics and baseline measures investigated as
potential prognostic factors are presented under their respective
subgroup headings in table 1 and online supplementary files
S1–3. There were no factors at baseline for which >2% of data
were missing. Eight-hundred and forty (82%) participants pro-
vided outcome data at 6 weeks, 811 (79%) at 6 months and 772
(75%) at 6 weeks and 6 months. See STROBE flow diagram in
figure 1.
There was no significant difference in mean age or sex
between consenters (57 years, SD=15, 44% male) and non-
consenters (56 years, SD=16, 47% male). Having provided
baseline data, 17 participants withdrew from the study, 1 died
and 151 did not return their questionnaire or respond to remin-
ders at either follow-up point. Participants who provided
outcome data at 6 weeks and 6 months differed at baseline from
those who did not (table 2). They were older, reported greater
pain self-efficacy, were almost twice as likely to do some form of
leisure time activity, three times as likely to have completed
their course of physiotherapy and were less likely to have
non-attendance.
After multivariable linear regression, each model contained
between 7 and 12 prognostic factors explaining between 0.34
and 0.48 of the variance at 6 weeks and between 0.30 and
0.43 of the variance at 6 months. Parameter estimates for the
non-transformed SPADI at 6 months are presented in table 3.
A negative parameter estimate refers to a decrease in SPADI
(less pain and disability), and a positive parameter estimate
refers to an increase in SPADI (more pain and disability).
A post hoc analysis indicated that the addition of treatment
factors, clinical setting and seniority of the assessing physio-
therapist did not change the association of prognostic factors
with outcome in any of the models, neither did the inclusion
of
a
random-effect
term
to
quantify
variation
between
physiotherapists.
The factors relating to outcome for either the SPADI or
QuickDASH at 6 weeks and 6 months are summarised in
table 4. Four factors were associated with a better outcome for
the SPADI and QuickDASH at both time points: lower baseline
pain and disability measured by the corresponding outcome
measure, patient expectation of a ‘complete recovery’ as ‘a
result of physiotherapy treatment’ in comparison to ‘slight
improvement’, higher pain self-efficacy and lower pain severity
at rest. In addition, with one exception (the SPADI at 6-week
follow-up), being in current employment or education was asso-
ciated with a better outcome than not being in current employ-
ment or education.
At 6 weeks only, a better outcome for both measures was
associated with the absence, compared to the presence, of pain
in the opposite upper quadrant (SPADI, β=−8.60, 95% CI
−4.33 to −12.87) and no previous, compared to a previous,
major operation (shoulder surgery excluded) (SPADI, β=−8.11,
95% CI −3.66 to −12.56).
At 6 months only, a better outcome for both measures was
associated with a shorter duration of symptoms, no additional
health problems compared to one and in particular two or more
and a reduction in pain or increase in the range of shoulder ele-
vation with manual facilitation of the scapula during elevation
of the arm (table 4).24 25
A number of clinical examination findings, commonly asso-
ciated with specific shoulder disorders, were not associated with
outcome. For example, (1) restricted passive external rotation,
due to pain or stiffness, indicative of a frozen shoulder,26 and
(2) an external rotation lag,27 indicative of a rotator cuff tear,
were not associated with outcome. Neck pain or pain on move-
ment of the cervical spine, during the clinical examination, was
not associated with outcome.
DISCUSSION
Summary of main findings
T
en prognostic factors were consistently associated with the SPADI
and QuickDASH at one or both time point(s). This is the first
known study to investigate the association of five of these factors

 with the outcome of physiotherapy management for shoulder
pain. These five factors that were associated with a better outcome
include: (1) patient expectation of ‘complete recovery’ compared
to a ‘slight improvement’ as ‘a result of physiotherapy treatment’,
(2) lower pain severity specifically at rest, (3) the absence of a pre-
vious major operation (shoulder surgery excluded), (4) the absence
of pain in the opposite upper quadrant and (5) change in pain or
range of shoulder elevation with manual facilitation of the scapula
during elevation of the arm.
Strengths and limitations
For the physiotherapy management of shoulder pain, this multi-
centre prospective study of over 1000 participants is the first to
include a range of biopsychosocial factors with a validated psy-
chological measure and clinical examination findings with pre-
defined standard operating procedures. It is the first study of
this magnitude to include patients who start but do not com-
plete their course of physiotherapy. The results are generalisable
to the wide range of patients and presentations of shoulder pain
commonly seen within physiotherapy practices within primary
and secondary care.
As part of their treatment, 99% of participants were required
to carry out a home exercise programme prescribed by their
physiotherapist. Prognostic factors associated with outcome for
this active intervention on behalf of the patient may differ from
those identified for more passive management options such as
surgery or other conservative options.
The limitations associated with this study must be acknowl-
edged when interpreting the results. Only prognostic factors sig-
nificant in three of four models for each outcome and time
point were presented. Factors remaining in the models for the
transformed and non-transformed outcome data were generally

 the same with no discrepancies in the direction of association;
we presented parameter estimates for non-transformed outcome
data to facilitate clinical interpretation.
There was a differential non-response at follow-up. There was
a greater likelihood of missing outcome data for younger parti-
cipants and those not partaking in leisure time physical activity.
This may have decreased the power of the study to detect a
more consistent association of these factors with outcome and
represent a potential source of bias. Similarly, low numbers of
patients with extreme anxiety and depression participated in the
study, which decreased the power of the study to detect an asso-
ciation between anxiety and depression and outcome.
Comparison with other studies
Baseline disability and pain self-efficacy have been investigated
in previous studies: in our study, higher disability at baseline was
associated with higher disability at follow-up, which is consist-
ent with three previous studies.28–30 Pain self-efficacy is the

Pain self-efficacy was investigated in one previous study, which
found no significant association with the SPADI at 1 year.32 The
study participants were part of a randomised controlled trial,
and physiotherapy consisted primarily of supervised exercises or
radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy.33 In our study, 99% of
the participants were given a home exercise programme, often
as a primary aspect of their treatment. The level of pain self-
efficacy required to learn, undertake and effectively implement
a prescribed home exercise programme may be greater than that
required for the supervised exercises or therapist-administered
interventions and may explain the significant association with
outcome observed in our study.
Not being in employment due to redundancy, unemployment
or disability was significantly associated with poorer outcomes
for the QuickDASH at 6 weeks and for both measures at
6 months. Heterogeneity on a number of levels, in particular
differences in the case definition of comparator groups, inhibits
direct comparison with the two additional studies for which this
has been investigated,32 34 none of which report a significant
association with outcome. However, long-term disability and
unemployment have been demonstrated as prognostic factors
for a poor outcome for the management of low back pain in
primary care.35 36
Symptom duration and comorbidities have been investigated
in previous studies. Of five studies investigating an association
between symptom duration and end point scores, two demon-
strated that a longer symptom duration was associated with a
poorer outcome,29 37 and three studies demonstrated no associ-
ation.28 30 32 An inconsistent association between symptom dur-
ation and outcome has been reported for other forms of
conservative management at the shoulder.11 T
wo previous
studies investigated the association between comorbidities and
end point scores, neither of which demonstrated a significant
association.28 29 Our results suggest that a previous major oper-
ation, which was not specifically included in previous studies, is
an important factor to include within the list of comorbidities.
The most consistent factor associated with outcome in our
study, patient expectation of recovery, is recognised as a prog-
nostic factor for a wide range of other health problems.16 It is
unknown whether treatment response is a consequence of
patient expectation, the subsequent physiological mechanisms,
whether psychologically and behaviourally, participants expect-
ing a recovery may be more observant of positive improvements
in their symptoms or whether patients are simply good at pre-
dicting their outcome.16 38 This study suggests that a positive
patient expectation of recovery as a result of physiotherapy
should be reinforced by clinicians.
Shoulder pain severity at rest was another consistent factor
associated with outcome. Shoulder pain severity has been inves-
tigated as a prognostic factor in four previous studies,28 34 37 39
none of which demonstrated an association with outcome.
However, ours is the only study specifically measuring resting
pain. Given that this is predictive of a poorer outcome, more
targeted multidisciplinary input may be required for patients
with resting pain.
This is the first study to investigate the prognostic value of
symptom modification with scapular facilitation techniques.24 25
The underlying mechanisms responsible for a change in symp-
toms are unknown24 as abnormal scapular movement and
posture are not consistently associated with shoulder pain or
any specific structural pathology.40 The value of this assessment
technique may be that positive findings indicate a mechanical
component to the symptoms, which may respond to treatment
techniques used by physiotherapists.
Implications for practice and research
This study provides evidence to support the NICE5 recommen-
dation of a general approach to the assessment of shoulder pain.
The International Classification of Functioning Disability and
Health41 states that body structure and function, activity and
participation and personal and environmental factors are inte-
gral to health for all individuals. Our study demonstrated that
prognostic factors associated with outcome cover a broad range.
Psychological factors were consistently associated with outcome.
In comparison, clinical examination findings, suggestive of a
structural diagnosis, were not consistently associated with the
outcome of physiotherapy management. This is important as
clinicians assessing and managing shoulder pain are taught to
perform
structural
differentiation
procedures,
which
can
account for a substantial component of the patient examination.
The findings of this investigation indicate that when doctors and
their patients are deciding whether or not to pursue physiother-
apy as a potentially effective management option, psychosocial
and biomedical information should be considered.
Physiotherapists stated their expectation of change using a
similar seven-point Likert scale to that completed by their
patient. However, physiotherapists completed the scale follow-
ing rather than prior to the assessment. The physiotherapists’
expectation of change was not associated with outcome. Nor
was it associated with the patient’s expectation of recovery. This
suggests that physiotherapists’ predictions of how well a patient
will respond to treatment cannot be relied on. A more forma-
lised approach is required.
W
e suggest that baseline psychological factors such as pain
self-efficacy and patient expectation should be formally assessed
using standardised measures. These psychological factors have a
prognostic value, not just at extreme values, but also throughout
a range of possible values and responses. For example, there was
a statistically significant difference in outcome at 6 months
between patients rating expectation of recovery on adjacent
points of the seven-point Likert scale: patients who expected a
‘complete recovery’ had better outcomes compared to those
who expected to ‘much improve’.
W
e did not investigate the effect of different treatment
approaches. However, poorer outcomes in individuals with
certain factors might suggest that addressing these factors could
result in better outcomes. W
e, therefore, encourage doctors and
physiotherapists to consider integrating psychological interven-
tions within their everyday practice to manage all patients with
shoulder pain. For example, motivational interventions used by
physiotherapists can improve self-efficacy for a range of muscu-
loskeletal and medical problems,42 and brief psychological inter-
ventions implemented in GP surgeries can promote physical
activity.43 Given the consistent association between a positive
expectation of change and a positive outcome in our study, and
the potential influence of physicians’ beliefs on patient expect-
ation, we encourage physicians and physiotherapists to reinforce
a positive expectation when referring patients to physiotherapy.
A multidisciplinary team may enhance outcomes for some
patients. For patients with lower self-efficacy or only a slight
expectation of recovery, who have not responded to psycho-
logical interventions within the GP or physiotherapist’s practice,
we suggest early involvement of psychological experts. For
patients complaining of resting shoulder pain or pain associated
with other comorbidities, particularly previous major surgery,
we suggest treatments aimed at pain relief. Given the magnitude

 of association between unemployment and a poorer outcome
from physiotherapy, we also encourage physicians to consider
referral to employment support services for patients unable to
work due to their shoulder pain. W
e also suggest that patients
not engaging in leisure time physical activity are encouraged to
do so and those taking part are encouraged to remain doing so,
in some capacity.
Future research is needed to externally validate a clinical pre-
diction model based on the prognostic factors identified in this
study including the question of which prognostic factors can be
successfully modified with treatment delivered by physiothera-
pists and if this improves outcome. Future research should iden-
tify which factors predict how subgroups of patients are likely
to benefit from individual treatments offered by physiothera-
pists. This would form the basis of personalised or stratified
healthcare for the treatment of shoulder pain.
What are the findings?
▸ Higher patient expectation of recovery as a result of
physiotherapy, higher pain self-efficacy, lower pain severity
at rest, and for patients not retired, being in employment or
education were associated with a better outcome.
▸ Clinical examination findings suggestive of a structural
diagnosis were inconsistently associated with outcome.
▸ Physiotherapists’ predictions of how well a patient will
respond to treatment cannot be relied on. A more formalised
approach is required.
▸ Psychosocial in addition to biomedical information should be
formally assessed and feed into decision-making about
management options.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the near
future?
▸ Physicians referring patients to physiotherapy should
reinforce a positive expectation of recovery as a result of
physiotherapy treatment.
▸ Psychological factors, such as patient expectation and pain
self-efficacy should be formally assessed using standardised
measures.
▸ Patients with resting pain and/or pain arising from other
comorbidities may be provided and guided on appropriate
pain medication or other pain-relieving treatments prior to
or at the same time as referral to physiotherapy.
▸ A multidisciplinary approach should be considered for patients
with more extreme psychological responses associated with a
poorer outcome, resting shoulder pain not responding to
medication provided by their physician, and patients not
currently employed or in education but of working age.
