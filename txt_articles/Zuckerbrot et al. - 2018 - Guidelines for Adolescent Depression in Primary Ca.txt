OBJECTIVES: To update clinical practice guidelines to assist primary care (PC) 
clinicians in the management of adolescent depression. This part of the 
updated guidelines is used to address practice preparation, identification, 
assessment, and initial management of adolescent depression in PC settings.
METHODS: By using a combination of evidence- and consensus-based 
methodologies, guidelines were developed by an expert steering committee 
in 2 phases as informed by (1) current scientific evidence (published and 
unpublished) and (2) draft revision and iteration among the steering committee, 
which included experts, clinicians, and youth and families with lived experience.
RESULTS: Guidelines were updated for youth aged 10 to 21 years and correspond 
to initial phases of adolescent depression management in PC, including the 
identification of at-risk youth, assessment and diagnosis, and initial management. 
The strength of each recommendation and its evidence base are summarized. 
The practice preparation, identification, assessment, and initial management 
section of the guidelines include recommendations for (1) the preparation of the 
PC practice for improved care of adolescents with depression; (2) annual universal 
screening of youth 12 and over at health maintenance visits; (3) the identification of 
depression in youth who are at high risk; (4) systematic assessment procedures by 
using reliable depression scales, patient and caregiver interviews, and Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria; (5) patient and 
family psychoeducation; (6) the establishment of relevant links in the community; 
and (7) the establishment of a safety plan.
CONCLUSIONS: This part of the guidelines is intended to assist PC clinicians in 
the identification and initial management of adolescents with depression in an 
era of great clinical need and shortage of mental health specialists, but they 
cannot replace clinical judgment; these guidelines are not meant to be the sole 
source of guidance for depression management in adolescents. Additional 
research that addresses the identification and initial management of youth 
with depression in PC is needed, including empirical testing of these guidelines.

Major depression in adolescents 
is recognized as a serious 
psychiatric illness with extensive 
acute and chronic morbidity and 
mortality.1 
– 
4 Research shows 
that only 50% of adolescents 
with depression are diagnosed 
before reaching adulthood.5 In 
primary care (PC), as many as 2 in 
3 youth with depression are not 
identified by their PC clinicians 
and fail to receive any kind of 
care.6, 
 
7 Even when diagnosed by 
PC providers, only half of these 
patients are treated appropriately.5 
Furthermore, rates of completion of 
specialty mental health referral for 
youth with a recognized emotional 
disorder from general medical 
settings are low.8
In view of the shortage of mental 
health clinicians, the barriers to 
children’s access to mental health 
professionals, the well-documented 
need for PC clinicians to learn 
how to manage this condition, the 
increasing evidence base that is 
available to guide clinical practice, 
the increased selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitor–prescribing 
rates in pediatric PC, 
9, 
 
10 and new 
evidence that a multifaceted 
approach with mental health 
consultation may improve the 
management of depression in PC 
settings, 
8, 
 
10 
–16 guidance for the 
identification and management of 
depression in adolescents in PC 
were urgently needed. To address 
this gap as well as to meet the 
needs of PC clinicians and families 
who are on the front lines with 
few mental health resources 
available, in 2007, the Center for 
the Advancement of Children’s 
Mental Health at Columbia 
University and the Sunnybrook 
Health Sciences Center at the 
University of Toronto joined forces 
with the New York Forum for 
Child Health, the New York District 
II Chapter 3 of the American 
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), 
and the Resource for Advancing 
Children’s Health (REACH) Institute 
along with leading experts across 
the United States and Canada to 
address the need for a synthesis 
of knowledge in this area. The 
result of this initiative was the 
development of the Guidelines for 
Adolescent Depression in Primary 
Care (GLAD-PC). These guidelines 
are based on available research 
and the consensus of experts 
in depression and PC. The two 
companion articles17, 
 
18 constituted 
the first-ever evidence- and expert 
consensus–derived guidelines to 
guide PC clinicians’ management 
of adolescent depression. The 
guidelines were also accompanied 
by a tool kit (available at no cost for 
download at http:// 
www. 
gladpc. 
org).
In this article, we present the 
updated recommendations on 
the identification, assessment, 
and initial management of 
depression in PC settings and new 
recommendations on practice 
preparations (not previously in the 
GLAD-PC). In the accompanying 
report, we present the results of 
the reviews and recommendations 
on treatment (psychotherapy, 
psychopharmacology, and 
pediatric counseling) and ongoing 
management.
Major depressive disorder (MDD) 
is a specific diagnosis described 
in the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth 
Edition (DSM-5)19 characterized 
by discrete episodes of at least 
2 weeks’ duration (although 
episodes can last considerably 
longer) and involving changes 
in affect, cognition and 
neurovegetative functions, and 
interepisode remissions. Other 
types of depression exist, such as 
persistent depressive disorder and 
premenstrual dysphoric disorder. It 
is important to note that depressive 
disorders have been separated from 
bipolar and related disorders in 
the DSM-5. Although the evidence 
for the psychopharmacology 
recommendations in the 
accompanying article focuses 
exclusively on MDD, the 
recommendations around 
identification, assessment, and 
initial management can be applied 
to other forms of depression as 
well.
Our guidelines also distinguish 
between mild, moderate, and 
severe forms of MDD. The DSM-5 
depression criteria include 9 
specific symptoms that have been 
shown to cluster together, run in 
families, and have a genetic basis, 
20 
–24  
and a large body of evidence 
accumulated over time now 
supports the internal consistency 
of depressive symptoms and the 
validity of the major depression 
construct.20 According to the 
DSM-5, the severity of depressive 
disorders can be based on symptom 
count, intensity of symptoms, 
and/or level of impairment. This 
commonly used method to define 
depression severity has been 
used in large population-based 
studies25 and may be particularly 
relevant in PC settings, in which 
less severe clinical presentations of 
depression may be more common. 
Thus, mild depression may be 
characterized on the basis of lower 
scores on standardized depression 
scales with a shorter duration of 
symptoms or meeting minimal 
criteria for depression. Following 
the DSM-5, mild depression might 
be defined as 5 to 6 symptoms that 
are mild in severity. Furthermore, 
the patient might experience only 
mild impairment in functioning.
In contrast, depression might be 
deemed severe when a patient 
experiences all of the depressive 
symptoms listed in the DSM-5.  
Depression might also be 
considered severe if the patient 
experiences severe impairment in 
functioning. Moderate depression 
falls between these 2 categories.

 In general, however, even if not 
all 9 DSM-5–defined symptoms 
of depression are present, for the 
purposes of these guidelines, an 
adolescent with at least 5 criteria 
of MDD should be considered in 
the severe category if he or she 
presents with a specific suicide 
plan, clear intent, or recent attempt; 
psychotic symptoms; family 
history of first-degree relatives 
with bipolar disorder; or severe 
impairment in functioning (such as 
being unable to leave home).
These guidelines were developed for 
PC clinicians who are in a position 
to identify and assist youth with 
depression in their practice settings. 
Although the age range of 10 to 21 
years may encompass preteenagers, 
adolescents, and young adults in 
specific instances, this age range was 
chosen to include those who might 
be considered developmentally 
adolescent. Research that supports 
adult depression guidelines includes 
adults 18 years and older. Much of 
the adolescent depression research 
focuses on children 18 years 
and younger. However, because 
adolescent medicine clinicians and 
school health clinicians often see 
patients until they are 21 years 
old, we have included the older 
adolescents. Furthermore, a PC 
clinician faced with an adolescent 
between the ages of 18 and 21 years 
can choose to use either adult or 
adolescent depression guidelines on 
the basis of the developmental status 
of the adolescent and his or her own 
comfort and familiarity with each set 
of guidelines.
MeThODs
The original GLAD-PC 
recommendations were developed 
on the basis of a synthesis of expert 
consensus– and evidence-based 
research review methodologies, as 
described in Zuckerbrot et al.17 The 
5-step process included conducting 
focus groups with PC clinicians, 
patients, and their families, a 
systematic literature review, a survey 
of depression experts to address 
questions that were not answered 
in the empirical literature, 
26 an 
expert consensus workshop, and an 
iterative guideline drafting process 
with opportunity for input from all 
workshop attendees.
For the research update of the 
GLAD-PC, systematic literature 
reviews were conducted in the 
same 5 key areas of adolescent 
depression management in 
PC settings as the original 
guidelines: identification and 
assessment, initial management, 
safety planning, treatment, and 
ongoing management of youth 
depression. Consistent with the 
original review, the updated 
searches were conducted by 
using relevant databases (eg, 
Medline and PsycInfo), and all 
primary studies published since 
the original GLAD-PC reviews in 
2005 and 2006 were examined. 
All update procedures were 
conducted with the input and 
guidance of the steering group, 
which is composed of clinical and 
research experts, organizational 
liaisons, and youth and families 
with lived experience. As in the 
original review, recommendations 
were graded on the basis of the 
University of Oxford’s Centre for 
Evidence-Based Medicine grade of 
evidence (1–5) system, with 1 to 5 
corresponding to the strongest to 
the weakest evidence respectively

pdf). They 
were also rated on the basis of 
the strength of expert consensus 
among the steering group members 
that the recommended practice is 
appropriate. Recommendations 
with strong (>70%) or very strong 
(>90%) agreement are given here.
In addition, a new review on the 
topic of practice preparation was 
conducted given the emerging 
evidence for this area since the 
development of the original 
GLAD-PC guidelines. Electronic 
searches of relevant databases were 
conducted for English-language 
studies in which researchers 
examined practice preparation 
for treating youth depression in 
PC that were published between 
1946 and September 2016. Search 
terms were grouped by categories 
and included the following: “child* 
or adolesc* or youth or teen* 
or juvenile” and “primary care 
or pediatr* or family prac* or 
general prac*” and “depress* or 
dysth* or mood or bipolar” and 
“collaborative care or integrat* 
health or medical-behavioral health 
care or behavioral health or medical 
home or shared care or facilita* 
or practice prepar*”. Reference 
lists for relevant articles were also 
examined for additional studies that 
were not identified through search 
engines. A total of 135 abstracts 
were carefully examined. Studies 
that were conducted outside of PC 
facilities or that used solely adult 
populations were screened out, 
leaving a total of 8 relevant articles. 
A full report of all the literature 
reviews is available on request.

Practice Preparation
Once PC practices have buy-in 
from administrative and clinical 
staff to improve depression care 
for youth, 2 important steps are 
necessary. First, before practices 
embark on screening for or 
identifying youth who are at risk 
for depression, training in such 
issues as appropriate screening 
tools, assessment and diagnostic 
methods, safety planning, and 
so on is important. Second, it

 is necessary to have access to 
community resources, such as 
mental health specialists (mental 
health specialists can include 
child and adolescent psychiatrists, 
psychiatric nurse practitioners, 
and therapists), not just as a 
potential referral resource but 
also for as-needed consultation for 
case patients that the PC clinicians 
choose to manage. We review the 
available evidence pertaining to 
these 2 areas (provider training and 
specialty consultation) below.
Effective Training Methods
PC practices vary widely in their 
capacity to implement full-scale 
collaborative or integrative 
behavioral health programs to 
address psychological difficulties in 
youth. At minimum, providing PC 
providers with guidance, education, 
and training in key topic areas 
such as identification, evaluation of 
suicide risk, and initial management 
of adolescent depression can be a 
feasible and cost-efficient means 
of improving care delivery when 
comprehensive organizational 
restructuring efforts are out of 
reach. However, simply providing 
PC providers with relevant 
information is not enough because 
passive education strategies are 
usually inadequate for producing 
lasting change in provider 
behavior.27
Researchers in large-scale review 
studies suggest that the adoption 
of practice guidelines improves 
when training and implementation 
strategies are tailored to the 
PC practice (eg, training that is 
developed by primary mental 
health care specialists, such as 
the training provided by the 
REACH Institute [http:// 
www. 
thereachinstitute 
. 
org/ 
] and Child 
and Adolescent Psychology for 
Primary Care [http:// 
www. 
cappcny. 
org/ 
])28 and/or use 
comprehensive training methods, 
such as varying information 
delivery methods and skill-building 
exercises, such as role-playing.27 
Evidence regarding which specific 
theory-driven training strategies 
are most effective at eliciting 
behavior change with PC providers, 
particularly related to mental 
health, is sparse, but 1 promising 
framework leverages principles 
from the theories of reasoned 
action and planned behavior to 
inform training methodology (see 
Perkins et al29 for explanation 
and review). This approach 
posits 3 primary determinants 
of PC behavior change: attitudes 
toward the practice innovation, 
the strength of intention to adopt 
the new practice(s), and sense 
of self-efficacy in one’s ability 
to continue the new behavior. 
Although no randomized trials in 
which researchers use this or other 
systematic frameworks for PC 
provider–training methodologies 
were identified, researchers 
in preliminary studies offer 
support for training approaches 
that incorporate basic science-
guided behavior change theory 
and methods. There is increasing 
evidence that quality-improvement 
strategies and techniques can 
change PC practitioner behavior 
both in mental health and in other 
arenas.30, 
31 The REACH Institute 
(which is committed to renewing 
and improving techniques for 
professionals and parents to treat 
children with behavioral and 
emotional needs) has developed 
and widely implemented a 3-day 
intensive training on evidence-
based pediatric mental health 
assessment, diagnosis, and 
treatment practices (including 
for youth depression) that is 
guided by basic science behavior 
change principles, demonstrating 
long-term practice changes (eg, 
increased use of symptom scales) 
as well as favorable PC provider 
attitudes toward, intentions to 
follow, and self-efficacy to adhere to 
the clinical guidelines up to 1 year 
later.32 In another study of the same 
training approach, participating 
PC providers showed higher levels 
of self-efficacy in diagnosing and 
managing youth depression and 
related disorders than those who 
received only more traditional 
continuing education programs (eg, 
lectures).33
An unrelated study demonstrated 
that provider attitudes toward youth 
mental health in PC impacts rates 
of identification. PC providers who 
viewed psychosocial treatment 
as burdensome were less likely 
to identify youth mental health 
problems.34 A subsequent follow-up 
to the study revealed that providing 
PC staff with communication training 
enhanced their self-efficacy and 
willingness to discuss depression 
symptoms with patients and staff, 
and this was associated with long-
term changes in practice behaviors, 
such as providing an agenda during 
the PC visit, querying for additional 
mental health concerns, and making 
encouraging statements to patients 
and families when symptoms are 
disclosed.35 The small amount of 
available literature offers support 
for hands-on, interactive, and basic 
science theory–driven training 
strategies for PC clinicians, but 
more research is needed before 
a consensus can be reached on 
how best to optimize training 
and educational strategies for PC 
providers.
Access to Specialty Consultation
In addition to obtaining relevant 
training, PC providers will benefit 
from having access to ongoing 
consultation with mental health 
specialists.36, 
 
37 Consultation 
after training allows learning to 
be tailored to the PC provider’s 
actual practice38 and can increase 
provider comfort with diagnosing 
and treating mental health issues.33, 
39 
 
More than 25 states have 
established programs to promote 
collaboration between PC providers

 and child psychiatrists by providing 
PC providers with education, 
rapid access to consultation, and 
referral options. Among the first 
psychiatric consultation programs 
was Targeted Child Psychiatry 
Services (TCPS) in the state of 
Massachusetts, 
40, 
 
41 which offered 
regional providers access to real-
time telephone consultation with 
a child psychiatrist and the option 
to refer a child to the psychiatry 
practice for a mental health 
evaluation, short-term psychosocial 
therapy, and/or pharmacotherapy. 
Program use data revealed that 
TCPS consultation support alone 
was sufficient to retain and 
treat in PC 43% of youth who 
potentially would have been 
referred to specialty services.40 
TCPS was subsequently expanded 
statewide and became known as 
the Massachusetts Child Psychiatry 
Access Project.14 Similar programs 
in other states offer free training, 
telephone consultation, and referral 
advice to PC providers.14, 
 
42, 
 
43  
Participating PC providers 
consistently report being highly 
satisfied with the consultation they 
receive14, 
 
42, 
43 and increasingly 
comfortable with treating mental 
health problems within the PC 
setting after consultation.14, 
 
42, 
 
43 
Additionally, consultation programs 
may improve access to mental 
health care not only by increasing 
its availability within PC but also by 
decreasing potentially unnecessary 
referrals to specialty care, which 
in turn makes specialty providers 
more available to treat complex or 
severe patients.41, 
44
Identification and Assessment
In 2009, after the publication of 
the GLAD-PC, the United States 
Preventive Services Task Force 
(USPSTF) endorsed universal 
adolescent depression screening 
in teenagers ages 12 to 18 years.45 
This recommendation was 
based on evidence that there are 
validated depression screening 
tools that work in an adolescent PC 
population and the evidence that 
there are treatments that work 
for the identified population.45, 
 
46 
On the basis of our review to date, 
no researchers in a randomized 
control trial (RCT) have compared 
functional or depressive outcomes 
in a cohort of adolescents who were 
screened in PC by the PC providers 
themselves versus a cohort of 
adolescents who were not screened. 
This lack of evidence, which is also 
mentioned in the Canadian review 
of the literature in 2005, 
47 the 2009 
Williams et al46 review performed 
for the USPSTF, the updated 2016 
Forman-Hoffman et al48 review for 
the USPSTF, and a 2013 systematic 
literature review published in 
Pediatrics, 
49 becomes less relevant 
as more evidence accumulates 
regarding the specific steps in 
the process, such as the validity 
of PC screening, the feasibility 
of PC screening, the feasibility 
of implementing treatment in 
those who are identified as having 
depression, and the efficacy of 
treatment of those who received 
evidence-based treatments in 
PC. In our updated review in this 
area, we found 8 new articles that 
provide some psychometric data 
regarding the use of depression 
screens in the pediatric PC 
population (Supplemental Table 1) 
and 38 other articles that touch on 
screening issues that range from 
whether screening is taking place 
and whether screening impacts 
follow-up procedures or treatment 
to the specifics of screening, such 
as the use of mobile devices or 
gated procedures (Supplemental 
Table 2). Supplemental Tables 1 
and 2 present the new evidence as 
well as the limitations for existing 
screening tools and protocols. 
Please see our original 2007 
guidelines for the past review of 
screening tools and protocols.
During the original GLAD-PC 
development process, secondary 
to the paucity of data on the 
validity of screening tools in the 
adolescent PC population, the 
original GLAD-PC guideline was 
used to review instruments that are 
used in community and psychiatric 
populations as well.17 Given that 
those screens are still in use and 
that their psychometric data still 
apply, in this current review, 
we focus only on new screening 
data in PC. Eight of the articles 
present psychometric data, such 
as sensitivity, specificity, positive 
predictive value (PPV), negative 
predictive value (NPV), or area 
under the curve (Supplemental 
Table 1). Most relevant were the 2 
publications by Richardson  
et al56, 
 
57 in which they validated 
the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 
(PHQ-2) and the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) in a PC 
sample against a gold standard 
diagnostic interview (the Diagnostic 
Interview Schedule for Children-IV 
[DISC-IV]). The PHQ-9, with a cut-
point of 11, had a sensitivity and 
specificity of 89.5% and 77.5%, 
respectively, to DISC-IV MDD with 
a PPV of 15.2% and NPV of 99.4%. 
A PHQ-2 cut score of 3 had a 
sensitivity and specificity of 73.7% and 
75.2%, respectively, to DISC-IV MDD.

(eg, Screen for Child Anxiety 
Related Disorders-5) and/

89 Not all 
of the screens in these studies have 
specific psychometric validation 
data (eg, 2 depression questions 
on the GAPS). Clinicians may also 
consider the use of tools that can 
be used to screen for depression 
and other risk behaviors or more 
disorders. Although no researchers 
have compared the functional or 
depressive outcomes of a cohort 
of adolescents who were initially 
screened only for depression with 
a cohort of adolescents who were 
initially screened for an array of 
high-risk behaviors and emotional 
issues, some hint at the possibility 
that too much information may 
overwhelm the clinician and result 
in positive depression screening 
questions being overlooked in the 
morass of issues needing to be 
addressed.52,

Therefore, clinicians should base 
the selection of a depression-
specific tool versus a more general 
tool on their own expertise and 
clinical supports in their practices. 
For example, a solo practitioner 
starting to address depression 
care in his or her practice may 
choose to start with screening for 
depression alone before moving to 
more general screening for riskier 
behaviors or disorders.
There is limited evidence to 
evaluate whether one can use 
a general parent questionnaire 
as a gated entry for adolescent 
self-report depression screening. 
Researchers in 1 study of general 
mental health screening used 
the parent- or youth-completed 
Pediatric Symptom Checklist-35 
alone to screen for internalizing 
disorders, but this provides no 
psychometric data, 
69 whereas 
others used the Parent Pediatric 
Symptom Checklist-17 (PSC-17) along 
with other, more depression-specific 
child and parent scales.54, 
 
56, 
 
57, 
82 One 
of these studies reveals adequate 
psychometric data for the parent 
PSC-17 internalizing subscale 
as compared with the Kiddie 
Schedule for Affective Disorders 
and Schizophrenia (K-SADS) MDD 
module, performing as well as the 
Children’s Depression Inventory 
but only with children aged 8 to 15 
years.54 Richardson et al56, 
 
57, 
 
82  
suggest some correlation with 
adolescent depression self-report 
tools, with the adolescent scores 
that are higher on the PHQ-9 
or PHQ-2 being associated with 
higher mean on the parent PSC-
17 internalizing subscale, with 
a correlation of 0.21 (P = .02). 
However, the data presented do 
reveal that some teenagers who 
scored above the cutoffs on the 
self-reports would have parents 
who score below the cutoff of 5 
on the internalizing subscale of 
the PSC-17. The authors do not 
present the data regarding how 
many teenagers would be missed by 
using the internalizing subscale as 
a gate and whether those teenagers 
met DISC-IV MDD criteria. Lastly, 
researchers in 1 study looked 
at the correlation of the PSC-17 
internalizing subscale between 
the parent- and youth-completed 
PSC-17 but only among subjects 
whose parents were already 
positive.53 The data revealed low 
agreement, with a κ of 0.15 (95% 
confidence interval of 0.00–0.30). 
However, those adolescents who 
did match with their parents were 
of higher severity than those 
parents who were positive but 
did not match with their negative-
scoring teenagers. In addition, 
the parent PSC-17 in general has 
usually been studied with the 
younger adolescent cohort and 
not the older adolescent cohort. 
Once again, there is no RCT in 
which researchers compare the 
outcomes of a cohort of adolescents 
who were universally screened 
with an adolescent depression 
self-report versus a cohort that 
was only screened with self-
reports after a positive parent PSC 
result. All of these data reveal that 
there is limited evidence in the 
older teenage cohort about using 
parent reports alone, that parent 
information may be helpful if used 
in conjunction with child reports 
when a clinician is available to 
resolve discrepant data, and that if 
used alone, parent reports may only 
account for the adolescents with the 
most severe conditions, but those 
data are unclear.
Researchers have also looked at 
paper screens, Internet-based 
screens, and electronic screens 
that are accessed through a mobile 
or personal digital assistant 
device. Although there appears 
to be no evidence of researchers 
comparing such screening methods 
to each other, all methods seem 
to be equally successful (in 
that adolescents rarely refuse 
screening) and equally problematic 
(obstacles to universal screening 
exist with every method). See 
 
Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 for 
more specific information.
Some researchers report adaptive 
(brief initial questions and, if gated 
questions have positive results, then 
automated additional questions)61 
as well as algorithmic screening, 
in which a positive PHQ-2 result 
or the equivalent triggers a person 
to then administer a PHQ-9 or 
the equivalent.65, 
 
75, 
 
79, 
85 Although 
evidence for this type of gated 
screening is limited, researchers in 
1 study compared the psychometric 
data of the PHQ-2 versus the PHQ-9 
in the same population.57
One limitation of brief depression 
screening may be the loss of the 
suicide questions if one focuses

 only on brief questions on the 
basis of criterion A for MDD. The 
validation study of the PHQ-2 found 
that 19% of teenagers who did 
endorse suicidality did not screen 
positive on the PHQ-2, suggesting 
that in a real-world setting, they 
would have been missed.57 Several 
studies in which researchers used 
brief or long depression-specific 
screenings that did not include a 
suicide question did add a suicide 
question for this reason.60, 
 
70, 
 
83, 
84, 
 
89  
In this review, we did not review 
the suicide screening in pediatric 
PC literature but are aware of the 
USPSTF decision not to endorse 
suicide screening secondary to its 
conclusion for the lack of evidence 
for PC intervention for suicidal 
adolescents.90 However, we do note 
which depression screening studies 
also looked for suicide as well  
as the rates of suicidality that  
were found (Supplemental  
Tables 1 and 2).
One other area that was examined 
in the review is the definition 
of depression when screening 
for depression. The definition of 
depression affects the psychometric 
properties and evidence for the 
use of a screen given that trying 
to find only MDD versus trying 
to find any depressive symptoms 
requires different specificities 
and sensitivities, and using the 
same screens for both purposes 
would result in choosing different 
cutoffs. Again, whereas the USPSTF 
comments on screening for MDD, 
the screening literature seems to 
be more unfocused. Richardson 
et al79 used a score of 2 as the 
initial gate and a score of 10 on 
the PHQ-9 as a positive score for 
entry into the next step. Forty 
percent of the sample did not meet 
the criteria for MDD but were 
deemed to be impaired enough 
with depressive symptoms to enter 
the study. When Lewandowski 
et al74 studied the large-scale 
use of the PHQ-9 modified in the 
health maintenance organization 
(HMO), they looked at whether any 
depressive disorder was identified, 
even adjustment disorder, rather 
than just MDD. The Youth Partners 
in Care (YPIC) intervention11, 
 
58 also 
included teenagers without MDD 
who had clinically significant and 
current depressive symptoms. Van 
Voorhees et al, 
91 in a series of small 
studies and now in a large RCT, 
have been purposely screening to 
account for depressive symptoms 
and depressive disorders other 
than MDD because the Competent 
Adulthood Transition with 
Cognitive-behavioral, Humanistic 
and Interpersonal Training 
(CATCH-IT) prevention model 
was developed for teenagers with 
depressive symptoms and disorders 
other than MDD.65 Thus, the 
evidence for choosing instruments 
and cutoff scores may depend on 
what depression end point a PC 
provider is pursuing and what 
intervention the clinician wishes to 
put in place.
Although the USPSTF clearly 
endorsed screening at age 12 
years, the literature in which 
researchers look at depression 
screening includes studies that 
have starting ages ranging from 
age 8 to 14 years and later ages 
ranging from 15 to 24 years. Most 
of the younger-age studies include 
depression as part of a broader 
psychosocial screening effort, with 
the researchers looking specifically 
at depression screening that 
focuses on some of the older age 
ranges (Supplemental Tables 1 
and 2). With that said, there is no 
evidence to compare outcomes in 
a cohort of adolescents who were 
screened at age 11 years versus 
age 12 years versus age 13 years.
The last guideline review included 
the YPIC study, which did reveal 
that an identification program in 
PC, when combined with high-
quality depression treatment, 
actually yields better outcomes 
than treatment-as-usual conditions 
(when no high-quality depression 
treatment is available).11 Two 
follow-up publications from the 
same intervention58, 
 
87 are included 
in this review and once again show 
that identified youth who receive 
evidence-based treatment do have 
better outcomes. More recently, 
Richardson and colleagues, in their 
collaborative care for adolescent 
depression RCT, compared controls 
who screened positive and whose 
positive results were given to 
both parents and PC clinicians 
with subjects who were screened 
and placed in a collaborative 
care intervention.79 Those in the 
collaborative care intervention 
had a greater chance of response 
and remission at 12 months and 
a greater likelihood of receiving 
evidence-based treatments. The 
researchers only tracked outcomes 
in those who were screened; 
although it is possible that those 
who were screened did better than 
those adolescents with depression 
who were not screened, the study 
does reveal that screening alone is 
not likely to improve outcomes by 
much given how much better those 
in the group that had screening 
combined with an intervention in 
place did and how much more likely 
they were to receive care than 
those who were only screened.
Although much of the literature on 
identification crosses both the area 
of screening and assessment in that 
the PC provider can use the screening 
tool to aid in the assessment, we 
found some studies that focused 
less on the screening tools and more 
on the assessment of depression in 
pediatric PC. These studies included 
those in which researchers used 
standardized patients to help with 
depression and suicide assessment 
as well as a protocol to teach PC 
clinicians how to do a therapeutic 
interview during the assessment 
process.62,

 In summary, no perfect depression 
screening and/or assessment tool 
exists, and no perfect screening 
algorithm or systematic protocol 
exists, but a number of adolescent 
depression assessment instruments 
do possess adequate psychometric 
properties to recommend their 
use in depression detection 
and assessment, and there is a 
limited amount of evidence to 
support some differing methods 
of implementation (Supplemental 
Table 3). Thus, it is reasonable to 
expect that depression detection 
in PC can be improved by the use 
of adolescent self-report checklists 
with or without parent self-reports. 
Reliance on adolescent self-report 
depression checklists alone will 
lead to substantial numbers of 
false-positive and false-negative 
cases. Screening and detection 
are only the first step to making a 
diagnosis. Instead, optimal diagnostic 
procedures should combine the use 
of depression-specific screening 
tools as diagnostic aids, buttressed 
by follow-up clinical interviews in 
which one obtains information from 
other informants (eg, parents) as 
legally permissible and uses either 
other tools or interviews to assess for 
other psychiatric diagnoses as well, 
reconciling discrepant information 
to arrive at an accurate diagnosis 
and impairment assessment before 
treatment. Although screening 
parents may not be required, 
gathering information from third-
party collaterals to make a diagnosis 
is important. Teenagers should be 
encouraged to allow their parents 
to access their information, and the 
importance of including parents in 
the diagnostic discussion should be 
emphasized. For more information 
about rating scales and cutoff scores, 
please refer to the GLAD-PC tool kit.
Initial Management of Adolescent 
Depression
On behalf of the initial GLAD-PC team, 
Stein et al92 reviewed the literature 
on psychosocial interventions for 
anticipatory guidance. No RCTs or 
evidence-based reviews were found. 
Citing earlier literature reviews in 
the area of injury prevention93 and 
anticipatory guidance, 
94 Stein et al92 
found some limited evidence that 
anticipatory guidance strategies, such 
as education and counseling, in the 
PC setting can be effective.
Another area reviewed by Stein 
et al92 involved psychosocial 
interventions for improved 
adherence. In an evidence review on 
asthma adherence, Lemanek et al95  
suggested that some educational 
and behavioral strategies are 
probably efficacious in creating 
change. In addition, a study in 
which researchers used cognitive 
behavioral strategies revealed that 
diabetic adherence can also be 
improved.95
For this update, our team searched 
the Cochrane Database of Systematic 
Reviews for all types of interventions 
that were implemented in the 
adherence arena. These reviews96 
– 
98 
revealed that only complex, 
multifaceted approaches that include 
convenient care, patient education, 
reminders, reinforcement, counseling, 
and additional supervision by a 
member of the care team were 
effective in improving adherence in 
different chronic medical conditions, 
including asthma, hypertension, 
diabetes, and adult depression. In 
the pediatric literature, research 
regarding adherence commonly 
involved interventions that targeted 
both patients and their families.99 
Several key components have 
been identified that may improve 
compliance and/or adherence, 
including patient self-management 
and/or monitoring, patient and/or 
family education and/or support, 
and the setting and supervision 
of management goals.100, 
 
101 The 
identification and periodic review of 
short- and long-term goals provides 
an individualized plan that both the 
provider and the patient and family 
can follow over time.100, 
 
101 Specifically 
in the area of youth depression, 
however, current research evidence 
reveals that only more complex 
interventions are likely to have the 
greatest impact on both adherence 
and treatment outcomes. This kind 
of coordinated care, which is often 
described as collaborative care or 
integrated behavioral health, is 
discussed further in the accompanying 
report on depression treatment and 
ongoing management.102
Safety Planning
Safety planning with adolescent 
patients who have depression and 
are suicidal or potentially suicidal 
usually consists of instructing the 
family to remove lethal means, 
instructing the family to monitor for 
risk factors for suicide (including 
sexual orientation and intellectual 
disability), engaging the potentially 
suicidal adolescent in treatment, 
providing adolescents with mutually 
agreeable and available emergency 
contacts, and establishing clear 
follow-up. In our updated review 
of the literature, we found no trials 
in which researchers have studied 
the impact of or how to conduct 
any of these aspects of safety 
planning with adolescents with 
depression. Once again, no studies 
were found in which researchers 
examined the benefits or risks of 
a safety contract. Researchers in 
several articles reviewed what little 
literature is available regarding the 
use of suicide safety contracts, and 
all concluded that these should not 
be used in clinical practice because 
there is no empirical evidence that 
they actually prevent suicide.103 
–107 
Multiple authors also asserted that 
contracts have numerous flaws, 
which could actually be harmful to 
the clinician-patient alliance. Some 
alternatives to a contract have 
been proposed (for example, the 
commitment to treatment statement 
discussed by Rudd et al107), but none 
have been tested in a clinical trial. 
Some studies have suggested that

 limiting access to firearms or other 
lethal means can decrease suicide 
by those methods, but the evidence 
is still unclear as to whether, on a 
broader population level, restricting 
access to certain lethal methods 
results in an overall decrease of 
suicide rates.108 
–116 In addition, 
Brent et al117 found that the families 
of adolescents with depression 
are frequently noncompliant with 
recommendations to remove 
firearms from the house. Yet, a small 
prospective follow-up of patients 
who were seen in an emergency 
department (ED) for mental health 
concerns found that the majority of 
their families removed or secured 
lethal means (firearms, alcohol, 
prescription medications, and over 
the counter medications) after injury-
prevention education in the ED.117 
Some limited evidence suggests that 
quick and consistent follow-up and/
or treatment with a team approach 
will be most helpful in increasing 
compliance and engagement among 
patients who are suicidal.118 
–120

The strength of the evidence on 
which each recommendation is 
based has been rated 1 (strongest) 
through 5 (weakest) according to the 
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 
levels of evidence and paired with 
the strength of the recommendation 
(strong or very strong).
Practice Preparation
Recommendation 1:PC clinicians 
are encouraged to seek training 
in depression assessment, 
identification, diagnosis, and 
treatment if they are not previously 
trained (grade of evidence: 5; 
strength of recommendation: very 
strong).
Consistent with the original GLAD-PC 
guidelines, PC clinicians who manage 
adolescent depression are advised 
to pursue additional education in 
identification, assessment, diagnosis, 
treatment and follow-up, consent and 
confidentiality, safety risk assessment 
and management, liability, and billing 
practices. Appropriate training 
on the assessment, diagnosis, and 
treatment of adolescent depression 
enhances PC providers’ attitudes 
and self-efficacy to treat youth 
depression within their practices, 
thereby making it more likely that 
psychological disorders will be 
identified in the patient population.34 
The REACH Institute and Child and 
Adolescent Psychology for Primary 
Care are examples of organizations 
that provide training opportunities 
to PC clinicians. In addition to 
high-quality content, studies of PC 
provider training reveal that effective 
information delivery methods are 
important to the successful uptake 
of new practice behaviors. Such 
training methods include a succinct 
presentation of high-priority 
information, interactive content 
delivery methods, hands-on learning 
activities (eg, role-plays), and 
cultivating peer leaders to champion 
new practices. Additionally, access to 
ongoing consultation after training 
allows learning to be tailored to the 
PC provider’s actual practice38 and 
can increase comfort with diagnosing 
and treating mental health issues.33, 
 
39 Clinicians also need to practice 
self-care by using supports for 
themselves as they take on more 
responsibilities of caring for youth 
with depression because engaging 
with this population can prove to be 
emotionally challenging.
Recommendation 2: PC clinicians 
should establish relevant referral 
and collaborations with mental 
health resources in the community, 
which may include patients and 
families who have dealt with 
adolescent depression and are 
willing to serve as a resource for 
other affected adolescents and their 
family members. Consultations 
should be pursued whenever 
available in initial cases until the 
PC clinician acquires confidence 
and skills and when challenging 
cases arise. In addition, whenever 
available, these resources may 
also include state-wide or regional 
child and adolescent psychiatry 
consultation programs (grade of 
evidence: 5; strength  
of recommendation: very  
strong).
The lack of linkages among relevant 
services within a system of care 
is a large gap in the management 
of chronic disorders in young 
people.121 Furthermore, family-based 
interventions have been shown to 
help youth with mental illness.122 
Therefore, establishing mental 
health referral and collaboration 
resources in the local community 
for adolescents with depression and 
their families is essential to ensuring 
timely and effective access to needed 
services.11, 
 
123 Such linkages may 
include mental health sites to which 
patients can be referred for specialty 
care services, such as comprehensive 
evaluations, psychosocial treatment, 
pharmacotherapy, and crises 
intervention services (in the event 
of suicidality). In highly underserved 
areas, these linkages may also 
include paraprofessionals who are 
tasked with providing the bulk of 
supportive counseling services to 
local residents. To reduce barriers 
to care, PC providers may arrange 
to have standing agreements 
with these practices regarding 
referral, the exchange of clinical 
information, points of contact, and 
so on. Schools play a critical role, 
especially if therapeutic support is 
available. Clinicians should connect 
to any available resources in the 
school system. PC providers should 
also work with the patient and/
or family to establish an individual 
education plan to provide supports 
for the teenager in the school 
setting. Other linkages may include 
online or in-person support groups, 
advocacy groups (eg, the American 
PEDIATRICS Volume 141, number 3, March 2018

Downloaded from 
 Foundation for Suicide Prevention), 
and family partner organizations 
(ie, patients and/or caregivers 
who have experience dealing with 
adolescent depression and serve as a 
resource for affected adolescents and 
families whenever these services are 
available).
To provide support to PC providers, 
>25 states have established 
programs to promote collaboration 
between PC providers and child 
psychiatrists by providing PC 
providers with education, rapid 
access to consultation, and referral 
options. PC sites may wish to search 
registries such as the National 
Network of Child Psychiatry Access 
Programs (www. 
nncpap. 
org) to 
identify any regional or state-wide 
programs that are available in their 
areas.
Identification and surveillance
Recommendation 1: Adolescent 
patients ages 12 years and older 
should be screened annually for 
depression (MDD or depressive 
disorders) with a formal self-report 
screening tool either on paper or 
electronically (universal screening) 
(grade of evidence: 2; strength of 
recommendation: very strong).
Given the high prevalence of 
adolescent depression (lifetime 
prevalence is estimated to be ∼ 
20% by age 20 years), the evidence 
that adolescent depression can be 
persistent, the fact that adolescence 
is a time of significant brain 
maturation, and longitudinal studies 
that reveal that adolescents with 
depression have significant problems 
as adults, it is important to try to 
identify and treat adolescents with 
depression early in the course 
of the disorder. Although most 
PC clinicians believe it is their 
responsibility to identify depression 
in their adolescent patients, evidence 
suggests that only a fraction of these 
youth are identified when presenting 
in PC settings even after the USPSTF 
mandate on screening.45 Extant 
evidence does suggest that screening 
with a systematic tool will identify 
more adolescents with depressive 
disorders than not screening at 
all. Providers should choose a tool 
with at least minimal validation 
data. Given that more evidence 
is needed to guide the choice of a 
depression screening tool, at this 
point, providers should choose a 
depression-only tool or a combined 
tool, a short tool as a gate or a longer 
initial tool, and an adaptive screening 
or a paper screen on the basis of 
what they believe will work better 
for their practices, patients, and 
health organizations. Furthermore, 
the current literature does reveal 
that screening and scoring before 
the provider is in the room with 
the patient can be most helpful 
to the workflow. Although both 
the USPSTF and the AAP support 
the universal use of an adolescent 
self-report screen, using a parent-
completed PSC as an initial gate 
may be acceptable given the limited 
evidence. However, 1 limitation to 
gated depression screening, using 
either a short self-report or a longer 
parent psychosocial report as the 
initial gate, is the loss of the suicide 
questions that are part of longer 
adolescent self-reports. Given the 
high rate of suicidal ideation and 
attempts among adolescents and 
the fact that not all adolescents who 
are suicidal will have MDD, it seems 
likely that screening for suicidality 
may be helpful as well, so providers 
should consider including suicide 
questions. Choosing a cutoff score 
for the selected tool will need to 
depend on the practice’s expected 
prevalence rates as well as the 
practice’s available and accepted 
pathways for intervention. Although 
there is no evidence to suggest 
how often a teenager should be 
screened, screening once per 
year seems reasonable until more 
evidence is amassed, whether this 
takes place at health maintenance 
visits or at the next available sick 
visit. Finally, this recommendation 
should not discourage PC providers 
who regularly speak with their 
teenagers about their moods from 
continuing to do so and should not 
dissuade clinicians from learning 
how to better identify teens with 
depression through interview, but we 
merely endorse universal adolescent 
depression self-report instruments as 
an initial screening tool.
Recommendation 2: Patients 
with depression risk factors (eg, 
a history of previous depressive 
episodes, a family history, other 
psychiatric disorders, substance 
use, trauma, psychosocial 
adversity, frequent somatic 
complaints, previous high-scoring 
screens without a depression 
diagnosis, etc) should be identified 
(grade of evidence: 2; strength of 
recommendation: very strong) 
and systematically monitored 
over time for the development of 
a depressive disorder by using 
a formal depression instrument 
or tool (targeted screening) 
(grade of evidence: 2; strength of 
recommendation: very strong).
As part of overall health care, PC 
clinicians should routinely monitor 
the psychosocial functioning of 
all youth because problems in 
psychosocial functioning may be 
an early indication of a variety of 
problems, including depression. Risk 
factors that clinicians may use to 
identify those who are at high risk for 
depression include a previous history 
or family history of (1) depression, 
(2) bipolar disorder, (3) suicide-
related behaviors, (4) substance use, 
and (5) other psychiatric illness; (6) 
significant psychosocial stressors, 
such as family crises, physical and 
sexual abuse, neglect, and other 
trauma history; (7) frequent somatic 
complaints; as well as (8) foster 
care and adoption.124 
– 
126 Research 
evidence shows that patients who 
present with such risk factors are 
likely to experience future depressive 
episodes.22,

 data as well that reveal that those 
who score high on depression 
screening instruments, even when 
they are not initially diagnosed 
with depression, may be at risk for 
a depression diagnosis within 6 
months.66 Although these at-risk 
teenagers may be screened annually 
as part of the practice’s universal 
depression screening, they may also 
require a more frequent, systematic, 
targeted screening during other 
health care visits (ie, well-child visits 
and urgent care visits). Following 
the chronic care model, teens with 
depression, past depression, frequent 
somatization, or other risk factors 
may need to be included in a registry 
and managed more closely over time.
assessment and/or Diagnosis
Recommendation 1: PC clinicians 
should evaluate for depression in 
those who screen positive on the 
formal screening tool (whether 
it is used as part of universal 
or targeted screening), in those 
who present with any emotional 
problem as the chief complaint, 
and in those in whom depression is 
highly suspected despite a negative 
screen result. Clinicians should 
assess for depressive symptoms on 
the basis of the diagnostic criteria 
established in theDSM-5 or the 
International Classification of 
Diseases, 10th Revision(grade 
of evidence: 3; strength of 
recommendation: very strong) and 
should use standardized depression 
tools to aid in the assessment 
(if they are not already used as 
part of the screening process) 
(grade of evidence: 1; strength of 
recommendation: very strong).
Scoring high on a screening tool 
alone does not make for a diagnosis 
of MDD, especially given that in a 
low-risk PC population, the PPV 
of a positive screen result may be 
low. However, as discussed earlier, 
a positive screen result can also 
indicate a different depressive 
disorder or subthreshold depression. 
On the other hand, in youth who 
are suspected of having depression 
on the basis of other initiating 
triggers, such as risk factors, somatic 
complaints, or other emotional chief 
complaints, assessing for depression 
(regardless of whether there is a 
positive screen result) may be in 
order. PC clinicians should probe 
for the presence of any of several 
depressive disorders, including 
MDD, persistent depressive disorder 
(dysthymia), and other specified or 
unspecified depressive disorders 
by using systematic, rigorous 
assessment methods. Although 
standardized instruments should 
be used to help with diagnosis, they 
should not replace direct interview 
by a clinician.134 
– 
136 Because 
adolescents with depression may not 
be able to clearly identify depressed 
mood as their presenting complaint, 
providers need to be aware of 
common presenting symptoms that 
may signal MDD. These may include 
irritability, fatigue, insomnia or 
sleeping more, weight loss or weight 
gain, decline in academic functioning, 
family conflict, and other symptoms 
of depressive disorders.137
Recommendation 2: Assessment 
for depression should include 
direct interviews with the patients 
and families and/or caregivers 
(grade of evidence: 2; strength of 
recommendation: very strong) and 
should include the assessment of 
functional impairment in different 
domains (grade of evidence: 1; 
strength of recommendation: 
very strong) and other existing 
psychiatric conditions (grade 
of evidence: 1; strength of 
recommendation: very strong). 
Clinicians should remember to 
interview an adolescent alone.
Evidence of the core symptoms 
of depression and functional 
impairment should be obtained 
from the youth as well as from 
families and/or caregivers 
separately.138 
– 
140 The involvement of 
the family is critical in all phases of 
management and should be included 
in the assessment for depressive 
disorders. If family involvement 
is determined to be detrimental, 
then involving another responsible 
adult would be appropriate. Family 
relationships may also affect the 
presentation of depression in 
adolescents. However, despite the 
importance of family involvement 
and the imperative to try to include 
family, adolescents value their 
sense of privacy, confidentiality, 
and individuality. It is important to 
remember that adolescents should 
be interviewed alone about their 
depressive symptoms, suicidality, 
and psychosocial risk factors 
and circumstances. The cultural 
backgrounds of the patients and their 
families should also be considered 
during the assessments because 
they can impact the presentation 
of core symptoms.141 Collateral 
information from other sources (eg, 
teachers) may also be obtained to 
aid in the assessment. Given the high 
rates of comorbidities, clinicians 
should assess for the existence of 
comorbid conditions that may affect 
the diagnosis and treatment of the 
depressive disorder.2, 
 
22, 
 
142, 
 
143 These 
comorbidities may include 1 or 
more of the following conditions: 
substance use, anxiety disorder, 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder, bipolar disorder, physical 
abuse, and trauma. Instruments 
that assess for a range of common 
comorbid mental health conditions 
should be considered as well during 
this assessment phase if they were 
not used in the initial screening 
protocol. Clinicians should also 
assess for impairment in key areas of 
functioning, including school, home, 
and peer settings.144 Subjective 
distress should be evaluated as 
well. Regardless of the diagnostic 
impression or any further treatment 
plans, a safety assessment, including

Downloaded from 
 for suicidality, should be completed 
by the clinician (see recommendation 
3 in Initial Management of 
Depression).
Initial Management of Depression
Recommendation 1: Clinicians 
should educate and counsel families 
and patients about depression 
and options for the management 
of the disorder (grade of evidence: 
5; strength of recommendation: 
very strong). Clinicians should also 
discuss the limits of confidentiality 
with the adolescent and family 
(grade of evidence: 5; strength of 
recommendation: very strong).
Management should be based on 
a plan that is developed with the 
understanding that depression 
is often a recurring condition. 
As seen in studies of depression 
interventions, families and patients 
need to be educated about the 
causes and symptoms of depression, 
impairments associated with it, 
and the expected outcomes of 
treatment.145 
– 
148 Information should 
be provided at a developmentally 
appropriate level and in a way 
that the patient and family can 
understand the nature of the 
condition and the management 
plan. Communication that is 
developmentally appropriate should 
facilitate the ability of parents and 
patients to work with the clinicians to 
develop an effective and achievable 
treatment plan. To establish a strong 
therapeutic alliance, the clinicians 
should also take into account cultural 
factors that may affect the diagnosis 
and management of this disorder.141 
Clinicians should also be aware of 
the negative reactions of family 
members to a possible diagnosis of 
depression in a teen (ie, sadness, 
anger, and denial). Sample materials 
are available in the GLAD-PC and 
include resources for patients and 
parents. Because the symptoms of 
depression can also affect many 
areas of an adolescent’s life, other 
ongoing partnerships may need 
to be established with personnel 
in schools and other settings 
(eg, extracurricular activities). 
Confidentiality should also be 
discussed with the adolescent and 
his or her family. Adolescents and 
families should be aware of the 
limits of confidentiality, including 
the need to involve parents or legal 
authorities when the risk of harm 
to the adolescent or others may be 
imminent. Clinicians should be aware 
of state laws regarding confidentiality 
(for additional information, see www. 
advocatesforyouth 
. 
org).
Recommendation 2: After 
appropriate training, PC clinicians 
should develop a treatment 
plan with patients and families 
(grade of evidence: 5; strength of 
recommendation: very strong) 
and set specific treatment goals in 
key areas of functioning, including 
home, peer, and school settings 
(grade of evidence: 5; strength of 
recommendation: very strong).
From studies of chronic disorders 
in youth, it is suggested that better 
adherence to treatment is associated 
with the identification and tracking 
of specific treatment goals and 
outcomes. Written action plans in 
asthma management have some 
evidence for improved outcomes.149 
Similarly, studies of adolescents 
with depression reveal greater 
adherence and outcomes when they 
were assessed to be ready for change 
and received their treatment of 
choice.11, 
 
86 If a patient presents with 
moderate-to-severe depression or 
has persistent depressive symptoms, 
treatment goals and outcomes 
should be identified and agreed 
on via close collaboration with the 
patient and family at the time of 
treatment initiation. Treatment goals 
may include the establishment of a 
regular exercise routine, adequate 
nutrition, and regular meetings to 
resolve issues at home. In the adult 
depression literature, monitoring 
appears to be most effective when it 
is implemented through designated 
case managers who monitor patients’ 
clinical status and treatment plan 
adherence.12 The benefits of such 
programs may be enhanced through 
the use of electronic medical records 
(EMRs) and the development of 
patient registries. Technologies 
such as apps are being used more 
commonly in clinical practice, and 
there is emerging evidence for their 
effectiveness.150
Recommendation 3: All 
management should include the 
establishment of a safety plan, 
which includes restricting lethal 
means, engaging a concerned 
third party, and developing 
an emergency communication 
mechanism should the patient 
deteriorate, become actively 
suicidal or dangerous to others, 
or experience an acute crisis 
associated with psychosocial 
stressors, especially during the 
period of initial treatment, when 
safety concerns are the highest 
(grade of evidence: 3; strength of 
recommendation: very strong). The 
establishment and development 
of a safety plan within the home 
environment is another important 
management step.
Suicidality, including ideation, 
behaviors, and attempts, is common 
among adolescents with depression. 
In studies of completed suicide, 
more than 50% of the victims had a 
diagnosis of depression.151 Therefore, 
clinicians who manage this disorder 
should develop an emergency 
communication mechanism for 
handling increased suicidality 
or acute crises. After assessing a 
patient for suicidality, the clinician 
should obtain information from a 
third party, assess that adequate 
adult supervision and support 
are available, have an adult agree 
to help remove lethal means (eg, 
medications and firearms) from the 
premises, warn the patient of the 
disinhibiting effects of drugs and 
alcohol, put contingency planning

 treatment, when safety concerns 
are the highest. It is critical for PC 
clinicians to make linkages with their 
closest crisis support and hospital 
services so that they are supported 
in crisis situations when caring for 
youth with depression. Clinicians 
may also work with schools to 
develop an emergency plan for 
all students who may experience 
acute suicidal crises. This global 
approach may prevent, in some 
instances, having to label a specific 
child as suicidal when providers are 
merely trying to ensure that safety 
measures are in place in case the 
child decompensates. Components 
of a safety plan may also include a 
list of persons who are aware of the 
adolescents’ issues and will be able 
to assist if contacted during an acute 
crisis (Fig 1).
DIscussIOn
Although not definitive and subject 
to modification on the basis of the 
ongoing accumulation of additional 
evidence, this part of the updated 
guidelines is intended to help 
address the lack of recommendations 
regarding practice preparation, 
screening, diagnosis, and initial 
management of depression in 
adolescents aged 10 to 21 years in 
PC settings in the United States and 
Canada. As such, these guidelines are 
intended to assist PC clinicians in 
family medicine, pediatrics, nursing, 
and internal medicine, who may 
be the first (and sometimes only) 
clinicians to identify, manage, and 
possibly treat adolescent depression. 
These guidelines may also be helpful 
to allied health professionals who 
care for adolescents.
Although not all the steps involved 
in identifying, diagnosing, and 
initially managing the care for 
adolescent depression in PC have 
been (or even can be) subject to 
rigorous RCTs, there is sound reason 
to believe that existing tools and 
management protocols for adolescent 
depression can be applied in the 
PC setting. Although more research 
is needed, we suggest that these 
components of the identification and 
initial management of adolescent 
depression in PC can be done. The 
recommendations were developed 
and updated on the basis of areas 
that had at least strong agreement 
among experts.
should These guidelines Be 
universally Deployed?
One might question whether PC 
clinicians should identify and 
diagnose the problem of adolescent 
depression if the lack of psychiatric 
services prevents them from 
referring these youth.154 This caution 
notwithstanding, the increasingly 
prevailing recommendation is that 
at a minimum, PC clinicians should 
be provided the necessary guidance 
to support the initial management 
of adolescent depression.155, 
 
156 
Nonetheless, because practitioners 
and their clinical practice settings 
vary widely in their degree of 
readiness in identifying and 
managing adolescent depression, 
it is likely that a good deal of time 
and flexibility will be required 
before these guidelines are adopted 
systematically or as a universal 
requirement. It is conceivable that 
integrated health care systems 
with EMRs, tracking systems, and 
access to specialty mental health 
backup and consultation will be most 
ready and able to fully implement 
the guidelines. The second part 
of the guidelines, the companion 
article, addresses the treatment of 
depression. Practices that do identify 
adolescent depression and have 
nowhere to refer patients to may 
benefit from the guidance offered in 
the next set of recommendations.
Preparatory steps
Because the management of 
adolescent depression may constitute 
a new or major challenge for some 
PC practices, a number of important 
considerations should be kept in 
mind when preparing to implement 
the guidelines given the findings 
from studies in the adult literature; 
input from our focus groups of 
clinicians, families, and patients; 
and the experience of members of 
the GLAD-PC Steering Committee. 
Specifically, PC clinicians who 
manage adolescent depression 
should pursue the following: (1) 
additional training regarding issues 
such as advances in screening, 
diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, 
liability, consent, confidentiality, 
and billing; (2) practice and systems 
changes, such as office staff training 
and buy-in, EMRs, and automated 
tracking systems, whenever 
available; and (3) establishing 
linkages with mental health services.
Linkages with community mental 
health resources are necessary to 
both meet the learning needs of 
the PC clinicians and to facilitate 
consultation for and/or referral of 
difficult cases. Practice and systems 
changes are useful in increasing 
clinicians’ capacity to facilitate 
monitoring and follow-up of patients 
with depression. For example, staff 
training may help prioritize calls 
from adolescent patients who may 
not state the nature of their call. 
Specific tools and/or templates have 
been developed that offer examples 
of how to efficiently identify, 
monitor, track, and refer teenagers 
with depression. These materials 
are available in the GLAD-PC tool 
kit. The tool kit addresses how each 
of the recommendations might be 
accomplished without each practice 
necessarily having to “reinvent the 
wheel.”
cOnclusIOns
Review of the evidence suggests that 
PC clinicians who have appropriate 
training and are attempting to 
deliver comprehensive health 
care should be able to identify

Downloaded from 
 and initiate the management of 
adolescent depression. This will 
likely require real changes in existing 
systems of care. As health care 
models such as the medical home 
indicate, comprehensive health 
care should include assessment 
and coordination of care for both 
physical and behavioral health issues. 
This first part of the guidelines for 
adolescent depression in PC may 
enable providers to pull together the 
current best evidence and deliver 
the best available, high-quality care 
even in instances when they are not 
in a position to treat such youth. 
Mounting evidence suggests that 
pediatric providers can and should 
identify and coordinate depression 
care in their adolescent populations.
