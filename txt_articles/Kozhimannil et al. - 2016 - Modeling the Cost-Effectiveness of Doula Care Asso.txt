Abstract
Background—One in nine US infants is born before 37 weeks gestation, incurring medical costs 
10 times higher than full-term infants. One in three infants is born by cesarean; cesarean births 
cost twice as much as vaginal births. We compared rates of preterm and cesarean birth among 
Medicaid recipients with prenatal access to doula care (non-medical maternal support) with 
similar women regionally. We used data on this association to mathematically model the potential 
cost effectiveness of Medicaid coverage of doula services.
Methods—Data came from two sources: all Medicaid-funded, singleton births at hospitals in the 
West North Central and East North Central US (n=65,147) in the 2012 Nationwide Inpatient 
Sample, and all Medicaid-funded singleton births (n=1,935) supported by a community-based 
doula organization in the Upper Midwest from 2010–2014. We analyzed routinely collected, de-
identified administrative data. Multivariable regression analysis was used to estimate associations 
between doula care and outcomes. A probabilistic decision-analytic model was used for cost-
effectiveness estimates.

 Results—Women who received doula support had lower preterm and cesarean birth rates than 
Medicaid beneficiaries regionally (4.7% vs. 6.3%, and 20.4% vs. 34.2%). After adjustment for 
covariates, women with doula care had 22% lower odds of preterm birth (AOR=0.77, 95% 
CI[0.61–0.96]). Cost-effectiveness analyses indicate potential savings associated with doula 
support reimbursed at an average of $986, (ranging from $929 to $1,047 across states).
Conclusions—Based on associations between doula care and preterm and cesarean birth, 
coverage reimbursement for doula services would likely be cost saving or cost effective for state 
Medicaid programs.

INTRODUCTION
In 2013, nearly one in nine U.S. newborns were preterm (before 37 weeks gestation), and 
one in three were born via cesarean delivery (1). Recent professional efforts highlight the 
need to reduce overall cesarean rates through more appropriate use of the procedure (2). 
Other professional efforts focus on preterm birth; thirty-five percent of all infant deaths in 
2010 were from preterm-related causes, more than any other cause (3). In addition, both 
preterm birth and cesarean delivery are comparatively costly. Cesarean deliveries costs twice 
as much as vaginal deliveries, for both Medicaid and private payers (4). Preterm birth costs 
the U.S. health care system more than $26 billion annually (5). Infants born preterm incur 
medical costs ten times higher than full-term infants during the first year (5,6). This includes 
high costs of neonatal care and frequent hospitalizations in addition to ongoing medical care. 
Because nearly one-half of all U.S. births are publicly financed, preterm births are a sizable 
public cost burden (5). As the largest payer for maternity care, Medicaid programs, both fee-
for-service and managed care, have a unique opportunity to address quality and cost of care 
through policies and incentives to increase consistent use of evidence-based childbirth 
practices (7).
One intervention being undertaken by a small but growing number of state Medicaid 
programs and managed care organizations is reimbursement for nonmedical assistance from 
a doula for pregnant beneficiaries (8–10). A doula is a trained professional who provides 
physical, emotional, and educational support to mothers before, during, and immediately 
following childbirth. Support from a doula during labor and delivery is associated with lower 
cesarean rates and fewer obstetric interventions, fewer complications, less pain medication, 
shorter labor hours, higher infant APGAR scores, and also shows potential for reducing 
racial-ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in breastfeeding initiation (11–15). In addition to 
support during labor and delivery, the scope of a doula’s work often includes prenatal 
psychosocial support, education, and health promotion. Typical doula services would 
include two to four prenatal visits, support during labor and childbirth, and one to two 
postpartum follow-up visits (16).
While many women may benefit from access to evidence-based, supportive interventions 
that confer positive health effects during pregnancy and childbirth, only 6% of women who

 gave birth in 2011–2012 reported having support from a doula (15). Women most likely to 
report that they wanted – but did not have – doula support were black (vs. white) women and 
uninsured (vs. privately-insured) women (15). These groups of women are also at increased 
risk of preterm birth (5). Studies have shown a direct relationship between maternal stress 
and negative birth outcomes, including a correlation between worries and fears about 
pregnancy and preterm birth (5,12,17). Evidence suggests that communication with and 
encouragement from a doula throughout the pregnancy may increase a mother’s self-efficacy 
regarding her own pregnancy (11–13).
Our objectives were to compare rates of preterm and cesarean birth among Medicaid 
recipients with prenatal access to doula care with preterm and cesarean birth rates for 
Medicaid beneficiaries regionally, and to use data on this association to mathematically 
model the potential cost effectiveness of Medicaid coverage of doula services.
METHODS
This is a retrospective, secondary data analysis using an observational study design to assess 
statistical associations between key variables and mathematically model cost-effectiveness. 
Retrospective, multivariable regression analysis was used to estimate associations between 
doula care and preterm and cesarean births. A probabilistic decision-analytic model was 
used for cost-effectiveness estimates.
Data and Study Population
The study population comprised two groups: Medicaid-funded singleton births regionally (N 
= 65,147), and Medicaid-funded births with doula care provided by a nonprofit doula 
organization in a large metropolitan city in the upper Midwest (N = 1,935). Women 
receiving doula services are referred to the organization through one of the state’s largest 
Medicaid managed care organizations. The managed care organization provides a list of all 
enrolled pregnant women to the doula organization, and a staff member of the doula 
organization attempts to contact each eligible woman via telephone to notify them of the 
availability of doula services. These services are covered by the managed care program as 
one of the options for childbirth education, although the doula services provided encompass 
more than just prenatal education and include continuous labor support, postpartum visits 
and breastfeeding education. During the study period, doulas provided support at the births 
of approximately 15–20% of all eligible Medicaid managed care enrollees. Reasons for 
choosing doula care over other childbirth education options most often included 
convenience, proximity, and the availability of culturally-relevant support. Women receiving 
doula services from this organization typically receive four prenatal visits, support during 
labor and delivery, and two postpartum visits from doulas who completed DONA training 
requirements (18).
The study used the 2012 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), an all-payer inpatient claims 
database designed to approximate a 20 percent sample of discharges from U.S. hospitals 
(19). Using the NIS variable that designates the US Census Division in which each hospital 
is located, we limited the study sample to births that occurred in hospitals in the East North 
Central and West North Central regions. These include the states of Minnesota, North

 Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska and Kansas (West North Central) and 
Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio (East North Central)(20). We also obtained 
state data on preterm birth rates for all Medicaid-funded deliveries from HCUPNet (http://
hcupnet.ahrq.gov/), which generates estimates using the Statewide Inpatient Databases, a 
census of inpatient claims for participating states.
Data on the 1,935 doula-supported births are from de-identified client information that is 
routinely collected by the community-based doula organization. Data were collected for 
singleton babies born between January 1, 2010, and January 31, 2014, who received at least 
one prenatal doula visit. All births were financed by Medicaid.
In addition, we had access to detailed records on each prenatal doula visit from mid-2011 
through mid-2013 pertaining to 811 births. Among these 811 cases, the mean number of 
prenatal visits was 3.77 (standard deviation [SD] 1.62), and ranged from one to eight visits. 
Of these 811 women, 222 (27.4 percent) had a visit with a doula early in the pregnancy 
(prior to the third trimester), and for those with early doula encounters, the average number 
of visits prior to the third trimester was 2.09 (SD 1.50). There were no significant 
differences in health or demographics between the 811 women for whom we have detailed 
data and the full doula sample of 1,935 women.
Measurement
The primary outcomes of interest were preterm birth and cesarean delivery. Preterm birth 
was identified in doula program data as deliveries prior to 37 weeks, and cesarean delivery 
was coded from the delivery mode listed. Using NIS data, we identified preterm birth using 
International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision diagnosis codes (6442, 64420, 64421). 
We identified cesarean births using Diagnosis-Related Group codes 765 or 766, as well as 
International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision procedure codes (740, 741, 742, 744, 
7491, or 7499). These identification criteria are consistent with prior research using maternal 
hospital discharge records (21,22).
Measured covariates included maternal age, race-ethnicity, and two major pregnancy-related 
complications: hypertension and diabetes. Maternal age and race-ethnicity are self-reported 
in doula program data. The data set distinguishes between African-American women and 
women of African descent. We present information for each of these groups and combined 
results for “black women” for comparability with national estimates. NIS includes race and 
ethnicity in one data element, but reporting practices for race-ethnicity in the NIS vary 
across participating states. If the state supplied race and ethnicity in separate data elements, 
then ethnicity takes precedence over race in the combined variable. Final analytic categories 
for this study included black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, and other. 
Hypertension and diabetes measures include both pre-existing and gestational conditions 
and are identified by patient report for doula data and by Clinical Classification System code 
183 (for hypertension) and 196 (for diabetes) in NIS data.
Analysis
We calculated means and 95 percent confidence intervals (CIs) for maternal characteristics 
and outcomes. Rate differences were evaluated using t-tests. We used multivariable logistic

 regression models to estimate the association between doula support and preterm birth, 
controlling for maternal age, race-ethnicity, diabetes, and hypertension. All women in this 
study met the income eligibility thresholds for Medicaid, ensuring some consistency in 
health care access and socioeconomic status. Doula care has previously been associated with 
reduced cesarean rates (2,8,11), and we modeled the association between doula support and 
cesarean delivery separately for full-term and preterm births.
To estimate the cost-effectiveness of doula services, we developed a decision-analytic model 
of the potential cost impacts of changes in preterm status and in delivery mode (cesarean vs. 
vaginal) that may be associated with doula support for Medicaid beneficiaries, facilitated 
through reimbursement for doula services. The decision tree we constructed for this analysis 
compared two different strategies of care for Medicaid beneficiaries: 1) usual care and 
benefits (i.e., standard of care), and 2) standard of care in addition to access to care from a 
trained doula via health insurance coverage for this service. The endpoints were cesarean 
and vaginal deliveries in both preterm and full-term births for both strategies. A diagram of 
the decision tree is shown in Supplemental Appendix 1. We used cost data from March of 
Dimes on private insurance payments in the first year of life following full-term or preterm 
birth (23). We conservatively estimated Medicaid payments for full-term or preterm birth at 
half those paid by private insurers, based on the March of Dimes data. We used published 
estimates of Medicaid costs for vaginal and cesarean births (4) as well as empirically derived 
preterm and cesarean birth rates (24). To test the sensitivity of the model’s results to specific 
parameters’ uncertainty, we conducted a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. This means that 
we simulated the full range of potential results 10,000 different times by varying all 
parameters simultaneously. The parameters and probability distributions are shown in 
Supplemental Appendix 2. We conducted an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis, looking 
at the lower rates of preterm deliveries among women with doula support, and one-way 
sensitivity analysis using linear regression metamodeling (25). We varied potential doula 
reimbursement values from $200 to $1,200.
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.3 and decision-analytic models 
were developed in R program (www.r-project.org). This analysis used only de-identified 
data and was therefore granted exemption from review by the Institutional Review Board at 
the University of Minnesota (IRB# 1202E10162).
RESULTS
The mean maternal age was similar among Medicaid-funded births regionally (age 25.7) and 
doula-supported births (age 27.1). However, hypertension and diabetes rates were lower in 
the doula-supported births than the regional sample. There was a lower proportion (10.3 
percent) of white women among the doula-supported births than among Medicaid-funded 
births regionally (48.1 percent). The doula-supported births had lower preterm births rates 
(4.7 percent) than Medicaid births regionally (6.3 percent) in uncontrolled comparisons 
(p<0.001).
Doula care was associated with 22 percent lower odds of preterm birth (Table 2; Adjusted 
Odds Ratio (AOR)=0.77, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)= [0.61–0.96]), compared with

 Medicaid births regionally, after controlling for maternal race-ethnicity, age, hypertension 
and diabetes. Consistent with prior studies, black women had higher odds of preterm birth 
than white women (AOR=1.38, 95% CI [1.29–1.49]). In addition, women with hypertension 
(AOR=1.83, 95% CI [1.66–2.01]) or diabetes (AOR=1.25, 95% CI [1.12–1.39]) had higher 
odds of preterm birth.
The adjusted odds of cesarean delivery for preterm and full term deliveries are presented in 
Table 3. Among preterm births, doula support was not associated with odds of cesarean 
delivery (AOR=1.63, 95% CI [0.99–2.64]); however doula support was associated with 
substantially lower odds of cesarean among full-term births (AOR=0.44, 95% CI [0.39–
0.49]), consistent with prior research (2,8,11,15). Other covariates were associated with 
cesarean birth, as expected, for both preterm and full-term births, with higher rates of 
cesarean delivery among women over age 30 (especially those over age 35), compared with 
women ages 26–30, and among women with hypertension and diabetes, compared with 
women who did not have these conditions. Also, among full-term births, black women had 
higher odds of cesarean (AOR=1.12, 95% CI [1.07–1.16]), compared with white women, 
whereas Asian and Hispanic women had comparatively lower odds of cesarean (AOR=0.74, 
95% CI [0.65–0.83], AOR=0.76, 95% CI [0.72–0.80], respectively).
The incremental cost-effectiveness result is shown in Figure 1. The quadrants in Figure 1 
plot costs and health outcomes (measured in terms of preterm births, where doula support is 
associated with a lower odds of preterm birth, as described in Table 2). Each dot represents 
one simulated scenario and the bigger dot represents the average incremental cost-
effectiveness ratio of doula-supported deliveries. The lower right quadrant (quadrant IV) 
represents estimates that are “cost-saving,” that is, such scenarios improve health while 
saving money. Estimates in the upper right quadrant (quadrant I) are “cost-effective,” that is, 
such a scenario would improve health at a particular financial cost. We found that, on 
average, doula-supported deliveries among Medicaid beneficiaries regionally would save 
$58.4 million and avert 3,288 preterm births each year. Of the 10,000 simulated scenarios 
comparing Medicaid-funded deliveries with doula support to Medicaid-funded deliveries 
regionally, 73.3 percent resulted in cost savings (i.e., a greater effectiveness at a lower cost) 
and 25.3 percent were cost-effective (i.e., greater effectiveness at a higher cost).
We also calculated expected cost savings, using 10,000 simulated scenarios across a range of 
reimbursement rates. To estimate potential cost savings across these scenarios, we compared 
potential changes in Medicaid expenditures for childbirth based on the reimbursement rates 
for doulas and costs related to childbirth care (measured in terms of preterm and cesarean 
births, where doula support is associated with a lower odds of preterm birth, and lower odds 
of cesarean delivery among full-term births, per results presented in Tables 2 and 3). 
Supplemental Appendix 3 shows cost savings figures for all study states for which data are 
available, where the x-axis represents doula reimbursement rates, and the y-axis represents 
all childbirth-related costs. In each figure, the blue line represents the anticipated cost and 
health impacts across the rate range, and the place where the blue line intersects with 0 
represents the “cost equivalency” point, where the costs of reimbursement for doulas are 
offset by savings related to lower rates of preterm and cesarean birth. This amount varies 
across states (which have different baseline preterm and cesarean rates, as well as different

 Medicaid reimbursement rates for care), but averages $986 and ranges from $929 to $1,047 
across states.
DISCUSSION
This study presents the first cost-effectiveness data on doula care in a Medicaid context. 
Prior research suggested potential cost savings associated with reduced cesarean rates 
among Medicaid beneficiaries with access to doula care (8), but the current analysis 
improves on these estimates by 1) employing rigorous decision-analytic modeling, 2) using 
simulation and empirical assessment of model sensitivity to uncertainty in parameter 
estimates, and 3) accounting for associations with both preterm birth and cesarean delivery. 
Results from this analysis indicate that Medicaid coverage of doula services may be cost-
effective – or even cost saving – for state programs.
Substantial clinical evidence supports the positive effects of doula care on a range of birth 
outcomes, with no known risks (11–15). However, prior research has not established 
whether there is an association between prenatal doula support and preterm birth. After 
adjusting for age, race, diabetes and hypertension, we found women with prenatal doula care 
had 22 percent lower odds of preterm birth, a substantial – but not unprecedented – effect 
size. Analyses of the CenteringPregnancy group prenatal care model show preterm risk 
reduction ranging from 33–47 percent among women randomized to group care, compared 
with those randomized to usual care (26,27). In addition, consistent with prior research 
(2,8,15), this analysis shows a relationship between doula support and reduced risk of 
cesarean delivery. Interestingly, the association between doula care and lower odds of 
cesarean delivery was only detected among women with full-term births, potentially 
reflecting consistency with a pattern uncovered in prior research, where doula support had a 
stronger effect on reducing cesarean among women without a medical indication for the 
procedure (15).
Risk of preterm birth varies by medical factors, socioeconomic conditions, race-ethnicity, 
substance abuse, and social factors such as high stress levels and lack of social support (5). 
Doula support during pregnancy may influence this constellation of risks for preterm birth 
by reducing stress, improving nutrition, improving health literacy, providing referrals and 
connections to resources, and improving emotional well-being (11–13,16). Prior randomized 
controlled trials of doula support during labor show stronger effects for women who are low 
income, socially disadvantaged, or who experience cultural or language barriers to accessing 
care (11). Extant research from both randomized trials (11) and observational studies (15) 
also finds that access to doula support, not a desire for doula support, is associated with 
improved outcomes, reduced rates of procedure use, and higher levels of satisfaction.
All women in this study with access to doula care had at least one prenatal visit with a doula, 
but without detailed information for the entire cohort on the number and timing of prenatal 
visits, we were not able to distinguish a dose-response relationship between prenatal doula 
visits and odds of preterm birth and cesarean delivery. Future research should examine this 
question in the context of expanded access to doula services. In addition, future research 
could also prospectively analyze doula care, possibly through a randomized controlled trial,

 to assess the causal pathway between prenatal doula support, preterm birth and cesarean 
delivery.
Results from cost models can help inform decisions around benefits design, case 
management, coverage policies, and value (28). There are limited published data (8,15) that 
have modeled the potential cost savings that could be achieved with doula support for 
pregnant Medicaid beneficiaries. Further, state Medicaid programs and managed care 
organizations have more accurate data—there is a need for potential benefit in either internal 
analyses or research using that data.
Strengths and Limitations
This study is the first rigorous cost-effectiveness analysis of doula care in the context of U.S. 
state Medicaid programs. It provides timely, policy-relevant information to inform ongoing 
efforts to expand access to doula services and improve maternity care outcomes. Yet, there 
are some important limitations on interpretation of these findings. The mathematical cost-
effectiveness models presented here are based on associational, not causal, relationships 
between doula support and preterm and cesarean birth. Also, the doula data used in this 
study come from one organization in one state; however, relationships are consistent with 
studies using other data sets (11–13,15). In addition, information on preterm birth and 
maternal complications are from self-reports in doula data but hospital discharge reports in 
NIS data. Importantly, we did not have access to consistent information on the number of 
prenatal doula visits for all women with doula support in the study population, limiting our 
ability to assess a potential dose-response relationship. Other limitations include lack of 
information on prior preterm birth, educational attainment, marital status, prenatal care, and 
other risk markers; differences in racial-ethnic distribution between the study groups; and 
lack of data on whether Medicaid beneficiaries in NIS data may have received doula care. 
Cost data are estimated from previously published sources (4, 23) because we were unable 
to identify a source of accurate state-level data for childbirth-related hospitalizations.
In nonrandomized studies, like this one, there is a risk of selection bias and unmeasured 
confounding. That is, women who receive doula care may differ in important ways from 
women who do not. Our “comparison group” is a regional sample and not a population of 
women without access to doula care, but access to doula care, especially among lower-
income women, is minimal based on survey responses from a national sample of 
childbearing women (29), so we assume that the vast majority of women in the regional 
comparison group did not have doula support. Future studies should compare women with 
and without access to doula care (intention to treat analysis) as well as between women who 
had doula care and those who may have been eligible but did not use these services (per 
protocol analysis).
Conclusions
In addition to providing support during labor, the scope of a doula’s work also includes 
prenatal psychosocial support, education, and health promotion. This type of care may be 
associated with lower risk of preterm birth, in addition to reductions in the chance of 
cesarean, and cost-effectiveness results indicate that achieving these health benefits may

 warrant investment in doula care as a covered benefit for Medicaid plans. Facilitating 
financial access to prenatal doula support should be given serious consideration by Medicaid 
programs and managed care organizations concerned with reducing overall rates of preterm 
birth and cesarean delivery and decreasing associated costs. This cost-effectiveness analysis 
clearly points to potential value in greater access to doula services among Medicaid 
beneficiaries.
