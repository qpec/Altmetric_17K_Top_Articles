In Brief
Zipeto, Court, and colleagues show a
pivotal role for let-7 microRNA editing in
leukemia stem cell self-renewal.
Impairment of let-7 is dependent on JAK2
and BCR-ABL-mediated activation of
ADAR1 editing. This provides a novel
mechanism of malignant reprogramming
that can be targeted through combined
JAK2 and BCR-ABL or ADAR1 inhibition.

SUMMARY
Post-transcriptional adenosine-to-inosine RNA edit-
ing mediated by adenosine deaminase acting on
RNA1 (ADAR1) promotes cancer progression and
therapeutic resistance. However, ADAR1 editase-
dependent mechanisms governing leukemia stem
cell (LSC) generation have not been elucidated. In
blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (BC CML), we
show that increased JAK2 signaling and BCR-ABL1
amplification activate ADAR1. In a humanized BC
CML mouse model, combined JAK2 and BCR-ABL1
inhibition prevents LSC self-renewal commensurate
with ADAR1 downregulation. Lentiviral ADAR1 wild-
type, but not an editing-defective ADAR1E912A mutant,
induces self-renewal gene expression and impairs
biogenesis of stem cell regulatory let-7 microRNAs.
Combined
RNA
sequencing,
qRT-PCR,
CLIP-
ADAR1, and pri-let-7 mutagenesis data suggest that
ADAR1 promotes LSC generation via let-7 pri-micro-
RNA editing and LIN28B upregulation. A small-mole-
cule tool compound antagonizes ADAR1’s effect on
LSC self-renewal in stromal co-cultures and restores
let-7 biogenesis. Thus, ADAR1 activation represents
a unique therapeutic vulnerability in LSCs with active
JAK2 signaling.
INTRODUCTION
Cumulative evidence suggests that adenosine deaminase acting
on RNA (ADAR) editases, such as ADAR1, promotes progression
and therapeutic resistance of a broad array of human malig-
nancies (Chen et al., 2013; Fumagalli et al., 2015; Han et al.,
2015; Jiang et al., 2013; Qi et al., 2014; Qin et al., 2014; Shah
et al., 2009; Zipeto et al., 2015). ADAR editases are double-
stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding proteins that post-transcription-
ally deaminate adenosine to inosine (A to I), most frequently in
the context of primate-specific Alu repeat sequences that
comprise 10% of the human genome (Kiran and Baranov,
2010; Picardi et al., 2015). By regulating mRNA and microRNA
(miRNA) stability, ADARs exhibit wide-ranging effects on embry-
onic development and stem cell regulation (Han et al., 2015; Lid-
dicoat et al., 2015; Ota et al., 2013; Solomon et al., 2013; Wang
et al., 2000). Genetic ADAR1 deletion, particularly impairment of
functional RNA editing, induces embryonic lethality in mice by
impairing normal hematopoiesis (Guenzl and Barlow, 2012; Lid-
dicoat et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2000). Conditional ADAR1 dele-
tion in adult mice increases interferon signaling, resulting in
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) exhaustion (Essers et al., 2009;
Hartner et al., 2009). Cumulative human RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq) studies demonstrate that deregulated ADAR expres-
sion promotes relapse or progression of lobular breast (Shah
et al., 2009), hepatocellular (Chen et al., 2013), and esophageal
cancer (Qin et al., 2014) as well as transformation of chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML) from chronic phase (CP) to a therapy-
resistant blast crisis (BC) phase (Jiang et al., 2013).
As the first cancer shown to arise in a clonal HSC population, CP
CML is initiated by BCR-ABL1 oncogenic tyrosine kinase expres-
sion (Fialkow et al., 1977; Jamieson et al., 2004; Soverini et al.,
2015). Progression to BC phase occurs following malignant re-
programming of committed myeloid progenitors into self-renew-
ing progenitor leukemia stem cells (LSCs) (Abrahamsson et al.,
2009; Goff et al., 2013; Jamieson et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2013).
While BCR-ABL1-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy
(Druker et al., 1996) has greatly reduced morbidity and mortality
in CP CML, therapeutic resistance occurs through BCR-ABL1 mu-
tation and/or amplification that leads to additional genetic and
epigenetic modifications that promote progression (Abrahamsson
et al., 2009; Goff et al., 2013; Jamieson et al., 2004; Quintas-Car-
dama et al., 2014; Sawyers, 2010). Previously, we showed that
increased ADAR1 expression resulted in myeloid progenitor
expansion and conversely, lentiviral small hairpin RNA (shRNA)
knockdown of ADAR1 prevented malignant progenitor self-
renewal in a humanized mouse model of BC CML (Jiang et al.,
2013). However, (1) the oncogenic drivers of ADAR1 activity, (2)

 ADAR1’s role in malignant reprogramming of progenitors into self-
renewing LSCs, and (3) ADAR1’s role in stem cell regulatory
miRNA editing as a post-transcriptional mechanism governing
self-renewal were not fully investigated.
Here, we demonstrate that increased sensitivity of CML pro-
genitors to JAK2-mediated extrinsic cytokine and intrinsic onco-
genic signaling through BCR-ABL1 converge on ADAR1 activa-
tion. ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing drives LSC generation by
impairing pri-let-7 biogenesis, resulting in unopposed LIN28B
expression and enhanced self-renewal (Copley et al., 2013; Pis-
kounova et al., 2011). Thus, targeted reversal of ADAR1-medi-
ated self-renewal may enable cancer stem cell (CSC) eradication
in a multitude of malignancies that have a propensity for progres-
sion in inflammatory microenvironments that activate JAK2
signaling.
RESULTS
JAK2 Signaling Increases ADAR1 Expression in
Progenitor LSCs
Previous studies suggest that ADAR1 expression is enhanced
by inflammatory cytokine signaling that activates STAT binding
to the ADAR1 promoter (George et al., 2008; George and
Samuel, 2015). Thus, cytokine receptor and downstream target
gene expression were analyzed by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq)
of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-purified normal,
CP, and BC progenitors (Table S1). Transcripts of inflammatory
cytokine-associated receptor genes, which signal through the
JAK-STAT pathway, and their downstream target genes were
increased in BC compared with normal and CP progenitors
(Figures 1A and S1A–S1E). Compared with CP, BC progenitors
harbored increased levels of IFNgR1 and IL-3Ra, which can
signal through JAK2 and activate ADAR1 transcription by bind-
ing of STATs to the ADAR1 promoter (Figure 1B) (George and
Samuel, 2015). In addition, BC CML harbored increased
expression of JAK/STAT signaling pathway genes and JAK2
transcripts compared with normal progenitors (Figures 1C
and S1F). Nanoproteomics analysis of protein expression
demonstrated elevated p-STAT5a levels following lentiviral
BCR-ABL1 amplification (Figures 1D and S1C). Inflammatory
cytokine-responsive ADAR1 p150 isoform expression corre-
lated with JAK2 expression in both qRT-PCR and RNA-seq an-
alyses of BC progenitors (Figures 1E and S1G). Moreover,
KEGG pathway-based gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
involving 1495 genes at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05, re-
vealed that the JAK/STAT signaling pathway was one of the
most significantly differentially expressed gene sets (p = 0.02,
Benjamini adjusted-p value) in BC compared with CP progeni-
tors (Figures 1F, S2A, and S2B). These data highlight the
increased sensitivity of BC progenitors to JAK/STAT signaling,
which could activate ADAR1-mediated RNA editing in inflam-
matory microenvironments.
JAK2 Signaling Promotes ADAR1-Mediated A-to-I
Editing
To investigate the direct contribution of JAK2 signaling to activa-
tion of ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing, we developed a lentiviral
construct that enabled robust expression of human JAK2-GFP in
normal CD34+ progenitors (Figure 2A). Transduction efficiency
was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy, nanoproteomics
analysis of p-JAK2 and p-STAT5a, and JAK2 qRT-PCR (Figures
2B–2D and S2C). Lentiviral JAK2 transduction of human CD34+
progenitors enhanced both ADAR1 p150 and p110 transcript
expression and ADAR1’s A-to-I editing activity as measured by
RNA editing site-specific qPCR (RESSqPCR) (Figures 2E and
2F) (Crews et al., 2015). While lentiviral ADAR1 transduction of
BCR-ABL1+ K562 leukemia cells potentiated A-to-I RNA editing
as measured by luciferase reporter activity in both the pCDH len-
tiviral vector and pDEST26 mammalian expression vector, this
activity was further enhanced by addition of JAK2 expression
(Figures S2D–S2F). Selective JAK2 inhibition with a pharmaco-
logical inhibitor (SAR302503) (Geron et al., 2008) reversed RNA
editing activity in a dose-dependent manner in K562 cells (Fig-
ure 2G). Taken together, these data suggest that JAK2 signaling
enhances ADAR1-mediated RNA editing.
JAK2 and BCR-ABL1 Regulate Let-7 Biogenesis and LSC
Self-Renewal
While ADAR1 editing targets have not been completely eluci-
dated, emerging data suggest that ADAR1 impairs biogenesis
of tumor suppressive miRNAs, thereby contributing to cancer
progression (Mariner et al., 2008). Because the JAK2/STAT
pathway activated ADAR1, we hypothesized that the LIN28B/
let-7 self-renewal axis may also be disrupted by increased
JAK2 signaling. Indeed, qRT-PCR assays demonstrated that
efficient JAK2 transduction increased LIN28B pluripotency
gene expression and inhibited the expression of let-7 family
miRNAs (Figures 2H and 2I).
Amplification of BCR-ABL1 is a hallmark of BC transforma-
tion and has been linked to LIN28B upregulation (Viswanathan
et al., 2009). We performed RNA-seq analysis of lentiviral BCR-
ABL1-transduced normal progenitors. Notably, a BCR-ABL1
transduction efficiency dependent increase in LIN28B expres-
sion was observed and was potentiated by co-transduction
with JAK2 (Figures 2J, 2K, and S2G). In human LSC-supportive
SL/M2 stromal co-cultures, let-7a expression was significantly
reduced in BCR-ABL1 transduced progenitors (Figure S2H).
However, biogenesis of let-7 family members was more pro-
foundly impaired following co-transduction with JAK2 and
BCR-ABL1 (Figure S2I). Treatment of JAK2/BCR-ABL1-trans-
duced normal CD34+ progenitors with the JAK2 inhibitor
SAR302503 showed reduced ADAR1 p150 isoform expression,
coupled with restored let-7 miRNA biogenesis in a dose-
dependent manner (Figures S3A and S3B). These results
confirmed our hypothesis that the JAK2/ADAR1 axis promotes

 maintenance of self-renewal commensurate with impaired
let-7 miRNA biogenesis. Moreover, RNA-seq analysis revealed
decreased expression of pri-miRNA processing genes, such as
DGCR8 and ILF3, in BC compared with CP progenitors and in
normal CD34+ cord blood cells transduced with ADAR1 WT
compared with backbone controls (Tables S2 and S3). These
results revealed an LSC-intrinsic defect in let-7 miRNA matura-
tion. In keeping with disruption of the LIN28B/let-7 self-renewal
axis, combined JAK2 and BCR-ABL1 transduction enhanced
colony-replating capacity as an in vitro surrogate measure
of self-renewal (Figures 2L and 2M). Conversely, combined
inhibition of JAK2 with SAR302503 (Geron et al., 2008) and

 BCR-ABL1 with dasatinib significantly inhibited their self-
renewal potential (Figure 2N). Together, these data suggested
that JAK2 and BCR-ABL1 enhanced malignant reprogramming
of progenitors into LSCs by deregulating LIN28B expression
and impairing let-7 miRNA biogenesis.

 SAR302503, dasatinib, or the combination (Figure 3A). Primary
human leukemic engraftment was observed in all hematopoi-
etic tissues, and the progenitor cell population was enriched
for granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMP) that harbored
enhanced serial transplantation potential (Abrahamsson et al.,
2009; Jamieson et al., 2004) (Figures S4A and S4B). After
2 weeks of treatment, FACS analysis of hematopoietic tissues
showed that both dasatinib and combination treatment inhibited
BC LSC survival compared to vehicle-treated controls (Figures
3B and S4C–S4E). Selective JAK2 inhibition by SAR302503 in
the splenic and bone marrow niches was confirmed by nano-
proteomic analysis of p-JAK2, p-CRKL, and p-STAT5a levels
in BC progenitors isolated from treated mice (Figure S4F). How-
ever, only combination treatment significantly reduced self-
renewal of BCR-ABL1-expressing BC progenitors, particularly
leukemic GMPs, in the bone marrow, thereby prolonging sur-
vival of serially transplanted mice (Figures 3C–3F). A signifi-
cant reduction in ADAR1 p150 transcripts was also observed
following combination treatment, suggesting that JAK2 and
BCR-ABL1 signaling converge on ADAR1 to enhance LSC
propagation (Figure 3G).
Inhibition of ADAR1-Mediated RNA Editing Impairs Self-
Renewal
By lentivirally expressing ADAR1 p150 wild-type (ADAR1 WT) or
an editing defective mutant vector ADAR1 Mut (ADAR1E912A),
we established that an inhibitory tool compound, 8-azadeno-
sine (8-aza) (Ve
´ liz et al., 2003) reduced ADAR1’s A-to-I editing
activity in the K562 leukemic cell line (Figures 4A and 4B).
Treatment with 8-aza showed no effect on BCR-ABL and
JAK2 signaling, as demonstrated by qRT-PCR analysis and
p-CRKL and p-STAT5a western blot analysis (Figures S5A
and S5B). To determine if ADAR1 is required for LSC self-
renewal, BC CML, normal, or lentiviral JAK2 and BCR-ABL1-
transduced CD34+ progenitors were plated in SL/M2 stromal
cultures and treated with 8-aza, SAR302503, or the combina-
tion. After 2 weeks in stromal co-culture, SAR302503 and
8-aza restored let-7 miRNA biogenesis commensurate with a
reduction in ADAR1 expression, RNA editing activity, and
LIN28B expression in JAK2/BCR-ABL1-transduced progenitors
compared with controls (Figures 4C–4G). Moreover, the replat-
ing capacity of primary CML BC progenitors was significantly
reduced by combined JAK2 inhibitor and 8-aza treatment in
stromal co-cultures (Figures 4H and 4I). Since normal CD34+
hematopoietic progenitors harbored relatively low JAK2 and
ADAR1 levels, their self-renewal capacity was not significantly
impaired by 8-aza or combination treatment (Figures 4H and
4I), indicative of an adequate therapeutic index between normal
and malignant progenitors.
ADAR1 Enhances Self-Renewal Gene Expression
To understand the mechanisms governing ADAR1-mediated
LSC self-renewal, we performed RNA-seq analysis of cord blood
CD34+ cells lentivirally transduced with lentiviral backbone vec-
tor, ADAR1, or an A-to-I editing defective ADAR1E912A mutant
vector. A KEGG-pathway-based GSEA revealed that ADAR1
overexpression significantly affected genes involved in the regu-
lation of stem cell pluripotency (Figures 5A and 5B; Table S4).
Transcriptomic analysis of ADAR1 compared with backbone-
transduced CD34+ cells revealed 14 upregulated and five down-
regulated stem cell pluripotency regulatory genes (Figure 5C).
Interestingly, the most differentially upregulated genes, including
ACVR2B, HRAS, and FGFR3, were let-7 targets, suggesting that
ADAR1-mediated impairment of let-7 miRNA biogenesis may
also regulate LSC self-renewal capacity (Figure 5D and 5E).
Lentivirally enforced let-7a and let-7d expression reduced
progenitor total colony numbers. Colony replating capacity
and LIN28B expression decreased thereby underscoring the
inhibitory impact of let-7 on self-renewal (Figures 5F–5K, S5C,
and S5D).
Since JAK2 activates ADAR1-mediated RNA editing and
impairs let-7 biogenesis (Figures 2E, 2F, and 2I), we decided to
investigate if let-7 biogenesis in LSC is restricted by cytokine-
responsive ADAR1 editing activity. First, we observed a reduc-
tion in pri- and pre-let-7a-1, let-7a-2, let7-a-3, and pri-let-7d
expression using RNA-seq quantification, as well as decreased
expression of mature let-7 miRNAs in BC compared to CP
progenitors (Figures 6A and 6B). Lentivirally enforced ADAR1
expression increased replating potential of CP CML coupled
with a reduction in mature let-7d expression, suggesting malig-
nant activation of ADAR1 in CP to BC transition is coupled with
impaired let-7 biogenesis and enhanced LSC self-renewal (Fig-
ures 6C and 6D). Next, we examined mature let-7 miRNA expres-
sion in CD34+ cord blood cells and K562 cells transduced with
ADAR1 WT or an ADAR1E912A mutant (ADAR1 Mut), which had
reduced RNA editing capacity (Figures 6E and S5E–S5I).
Notably, we observed a significant reduction in mature let-7
miRNA levels in cord blood CD34+ cells following transduction
with ADAR1 WT, but not with ADAR1E912A (Figures 6E). More-
over, only WT ADAR1 significantly increased the self-renewal
and survival capacity of normal cord blood CD34+ cells in
colony replating and engraftment assays (Figures 6F, 6G, and
S5J). In RAG2�/�gc�/� mice transplanted with cord blood
CD34+ cells, we observed significantly enhanced engraftment
as measured by increased CD45+ percentage in bone marrow
(Figures 6G and S5K). These data suggest that ADAR1 regulates
let-7 miRNA biogenesis in an A-to-I editing-dependent manner,
which has a functional impact on progenitor self-renewal and
survival.

 Previous reports indicate that ADAR1 depletion induces
stress-related apoptosis during fetal hematopoiesis and loss
of mouse HSC multi-lineage repopulating potential (Hartner
et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2000, 2004). To investigate the contri-
bution
of
ADAR1-editing
to
self-renewal,
we
performed
comparative RNA-seq analysis of ADAR1 WT, ADAR1E912A
Mut, and backbone-transduced human CD34+ cells. Volcano
plot analysis of RNA-seq data demonstrated distinct differ-
ences in expression of known ADAR1 target genes (Rob-
erts et al., 2013) and increased expression of self-renewal
transcripts following ADAR1 WT compared to ADAR1E912A
Mut transduction (Figures 6H; Table S5). A comparative anal-
ysis of A-to-I editing-dependent expression profiles with previ-
ously identified differentially expressed transcripts in BC
compared with CP (Jiang et al., 2013) identified 38 common
transcripts. These included genes involved in self-renewal,
such as FBXW7 and MAML2, and miRNA regulation, such as
SMAD1 (Figure 6I). Taken together, these results indicate
that ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing contributes to LSC self-
renewal.
ADAR1 Editase Activity Regulates Let-7 Biogenesis
Other studies suggest the ADAR1 mediates miRNA biogenesis
by editing polycistronic miRNAs in Drosophila (Chawla and So-
kol, 2014). Similarly, the primate polycistronic cluster of let-7a,
let-7d, and let-7f possesses differential mature miRNA expres-
sion potential dependent on ADAR1 RNA editing activity (Fig-
ure 6E). Therefore, we set out to investigate the location of
A-to-I editing in the let-7 polycistronic cluster. We utilized
RNA-seq along with ViennaRNA secondary RNA structure
prediction software (Yu et al., 2012) of both primary CML sam-
ples and normal progenitors transduced with ADAR1 WT,
ADAR1E912A Mut, JAK2, or BCR-ABL1 lentiviral vectors (Figures
7A, 7B, S6A, and S6B). While a few editing sites were detected in
pri-let-7f in CP and BC progenitors (Figure S6C), pri-let-7d was
found to be edited at multiple locations (Figures 7C, 7D, S6D,
and S6E). Notably, A-to-G nucleotide changes at the +3
and +59 editing sites were predicted to alter RNA secondary
structures at the DROSHA/DGCR8 and DICER cleavage sites,
respectively (Figures 7B, S6A, and S6B). Both increased and dif-
ferential A-to-G editing sites were detected in BC compared with
CP and normal progenitors (Figure 7C). The highest editing
frequency was observed in close proximity to the predicted
DROSHA/DGCR8 cleavage site (+3) in ADAR1-WT-transduced
samples (Figure 7D). Most importantly, two common editing
sites adjacent to DROSHA/DGCR8 and DICER cleavage sites
(+3, +59) were detected in BC progenitors and ADAR1-WT-
transduced cord blood cells, indicative of a pivotal role for
ADAR1-mediated editing in BC LSC generation (Figures 7C
and 7D).
Previous
studies
revealed
that
A-to-I
editing
near
the
DROSHA or DICER cleavage sites in pri-miRNAs inhibited the
cleavage reaction and reduced mature miRNA biogenesis
(Nishikura, 2010; Yang et al., 2006). We investigated the effect
of A-to-I editing on pri-let-7d biogenesis in 293T cells trans-
fected with edited and unedited pri-let-7d expression plasmids
(Figures 7E and 7F). We examined the unedited WT pri-let-7d
plasmid and ‘‘pre-edited’’ pri-let-7d at +3 and +59 as identified
in BC CML progenitors, as well as at 0, which is the DROSHA/
DGCR8
cleavage
site.
Compared
to
the
WT
pri-let-7d
construct, editing at the +3 site induced a significant reduction
in mature let-7d miRNA levels (Figure 7F). Interestingly, the
A-to-G changes in +59 or 0 sites did not show any changes
in mature miRNA levels, suggesting that the +3 editing site is
responsible for the reduced mature let-7d miRNA expression
observed
in
ADAR1-transduced
cord
blood
progenitors.
Lastly, cross-linking RNA immunoprecipitation (CLIP) assays
were performed in a K562 leukemic cell line stably expressing
ADAR1 WT or ADAR1E912A to determine if ADAR1 directly binds
to pri-let-7d transcripts (Figure 7G). Using an ADAR1 antibody,
we were able to isolate pri-let-7d miRNAs in both ADAR1 WT
and ADAR1E912A-transduced cells, thereby confirming the ca-
pacity of ADAR1 to bind to pri-let-7d transcripts. These find-
ings reveal a pivotal role for ADAR1 editase activity in let-7d
biogenesis and BC LSC self-renewal. Further analysis of let-7
clusters demonstrated increased A-to-G editing events within
primate-specific Alu repeat sequences with a proclivity for
forming dsRNA loops (Figure S7A). Single-nucleotide-resolu-
tion RNA-seq analysis revealed that pri-let-7d is located in
close proximity to multiple Alu repetitive sequences, which
may enhance the capacity of ADAR1 to bind and edit pri-let-
7d (Figure S7B).

 DISCUSSION
Malignant RNA editing, conferred by ADAR1 activation, has
emerged as a dominant driver of cancer relapse and progression
(Jiang et al., 2013; Qi et al., 2014; Qin et al., 2014; Shah et al.,
2009). Moreover, a recent report describing a genome-wide
analysis of 6,236 patient samples, representing 17 tumor types
in the Cancer Genome Atlas database, revealed non-synony-
mous A-to-I editing events that were predicted to promote ther-
apeutic resistance (Han et al., 2015). These discoveries have
fueled intensive research into the cell-type- and context-specific
mechanisms driving ADAR1 activation and the impact on self-re-
newing CSC generation in malignancies that have a proclivity for
therapeutic resistance and progression. In particular, the onco-
genic drivers of ADAR1 activation, the A-to-I editing targets,
and the non-cell-autonomous as well as cell-autonomous mech-
anisms that govern CSC self-renewal had not been elucidated.
By employing whole-transcriptome sequencing of normal, CP,
and BC CML patient progenitor samples and human BC CML
progenitor serial transplantation mouse models, our study pro-
vides a novel link between increased sensitivity to JAK2-depen-
dent cytokine signaling and ADAR1 editase-mediated genera-
tion of self-renewing LSCs. Our results show that ADAR1
activation in BC LSCs is triggered by increased JAK2-dependent
inflammatory signaling and is further amplified by the presence
of BCR-ABL1. Conversely, pharmacologic inhibition of JAK2
and BCR-ABL1 prevented LSC self-renewal commensurate
with reduced BCR-ABL1 and ADAR1 p150 expression in human-
ized BC LSC mouse model. These data highlight a dual mecha-
nism of malignant RNA editing activation in LSCs.
While genetic ablation of ADAR1 in mice leads to embryonic
lethality due to severe defects in erythropoiesis (Wang et al.,
2000), conditional deletion in the hematopoietic system impairs
long-term HSC maintenance, indicative of key roles for ADAR1
in both cell-fate specification and self-renewal (Hartner et al.,
2009). This suggests that deregulation of editase activity may
play a significant role in a variety of blood disorders that have ac-
quired aberrant stem cell self-renewal characteristics. Indeed, in
a humanized mouse model of CML, lentiviral shRNA knockdown
of ADAR1 inhibited self-renewal of malignant progenitors that
promote BC transformation (Jiang et al., 2013). Here, we
advance this finding by differential gene expression analysis
aimed at determining the genes involved in HSC self-renewal.
Notably, lentiviral ADAR1 overexpression significantly affected
genes involved in the regulation of stem cell pluripotency and
self-renewal. Upregulated genes in ADAR1 WT compared to
backbone-transduced normal CD34+ cells (Figure 5C) included
WNT4 and WNT9a signaling proteins. Notably, the WNT
pathway is critical for normal HSC homeostasis and self-renewal
(Louis et al., 2008; Reya et al., 2003). In addition, we observed
upregulation of genes that regulate the transforming growth fac-
tor b (TGF-b) pathway, including SMAD1 and SMAD2, which
transduce extracellular signals to activate transcription of genes
that regulate cellular growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Hel-
din et al., 1997; Nakao et al., 1997) as well as miRNA expression
and maturation (Blahna and Hata, 2012; Davis et al., 2008).
With regard to miRNA maturation mechanisms relevant to LSC
function, a seminal study showed that overexpression of LIN28B
and a let-7 target gene, HMGA2, coincided with BC transforma-
tion of CML (Viswanathan et al., 2009) and that knockdown
of LIN28B restored levels of let-7b and let-7g in K562, a BC
CML cell line. While LIN28B has been linked to let-7 stem cell
regulatory miRNA biogenesis, ADAR1 also contributes to differ-
ential expression of miRNAs through direct binding to DROSHA/
DGCR8 or DICER proteins (Bahn et al., 2015; Nemlich et al.,
2013). Because the LIN28B/Let-7 axis plays a critical role in
stem cell maintenance (Copley et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2015)
and appears to be deregulated in tumorigenesis (Melton et al.,
2010; Piskounova et al., 2011; Viswanathan et al., 2008), we
investigated its role in LSC maintenance. Here, we show that
ADAR1 enhances LSC self-renewal by impairing let-7 biogen-
esis. Combined inhibition of ADAR1 and JAK2 restores let-7
expression and inhibits LSC self-renewal. Since ADAR1 medi-
ates differential expression of polycistronic miRNAs transcribed
from the lethal-7-complex (let-7-C) locus by altering DROSHA
processing (Chawla and Sokol, 2014), we performed single
nucleotide resolution RNA-seq combined with secondary RNA
structure prediction (ViennaRNA software) (Yu et al., 2012) ana-
lyses and miRNA qRT-PCR. These analyses demonstrated
that BC CML and ADAR1-transduced progenitors harbored
enhanced editing at the polycistronic let-7 loci and reduced
mature let-7 miRNA levels (Melton et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2007).
Let-7 loci outside the polycistronic cluster displayed no editing
signatures in ADAR1-transduced progenitors. Moreover, RNA
editing adjacent to the DROSHA/DGCR8 cleavage site at +3
was associated with reduced let-7d biogenesis in BC LSCs
and CD34+ progenitors transduced with ADAR,1 but not with
ADAR1E912A and empty vectors. Finally, CLIP-ADAR1 assays
combined with site-directed mutagenesis mediated introduction
of let-7d edits confirmed that ADAR1 directly binds and edits pri-
let-7d transcripts, thereby reducing the expression of mature let-
7d miRNA as measured by qRT-PCR. In BC LSC compared with
their CP progenitor counterparts, RNA-seq analysis revealed
a reduction in pri-let-7a, but not let-7b, levels indicative of a
LIN28B-independent effect of ADAR1 on let-7 biogenesis. We
also detected editing of let-7f (4%), albeit less frequently than
for let-7d (10%). In primary LSCs, detection of A-to-I editing of
less abundant pri-let-7 transcripts by ADAR1 may require more
sensitive methods such as cross-linking immunoprecipitation
(CLIP) sequencing. With regard to clinical relevance, A-to-I
RNA editing of transcripts at a level of 10% was recently linked
to progression in 17 cancer types (Chen et al., 2013; Han et al.,
2015) and will likely represent an important functional biomarker
of CSC generation.

 The critical advance of this study is that ADAR1 editase ac-
tivity impairs let-7 family miRNA biogenesis and increases pro-
genitor self-renewal capacity, resulting in malignant reprogram-
ming of progenitors into BC LSCs. In addition, we show that
enhanced sensitivity to cytokine signaling as a consequence
of JAK2-responsive cytokine receptor upregulation and BCR-
ABL1 oncogene amplification results in ADAR1 activation.
While previous studies have shown that JAK2 signaling is
important in the induction of numerous transcriptional media-
tors, our discovery of a pivotal JAK2-ADAR1-let-7 self-renewal
axis provides the first mechanistic link between inflammatory
cytokine-driven oncogenic signaling pathways and RNA-edit-
ing-driven malignant reprogramming of progenitors into LSCs.
Perhaps most importantly, targeted reversal of ADAR1 activity
may impede the generation of CSCs in a broad array of thera-
peutically recalcitrant malignancies that evolve in inflammatory
microenvironments.

ences unique to these sections.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Primary normal and CML samples were obtained and RNA-seq analysis as
well as qRT-PCR validation were performed according to published methods
(Abrahamsson et al., 2009; Goff et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2013). miRNAs were
extracted using an RNeasy Micro Kit, and qRT-PCR was performed using
miRNA human-specific primers normalized to RNU6_2 and SNORD44. Lenti-
viral human WT JAK2, BCR-ABL1, and WT and mutant ADAR1E912A overex-
pression vectors were produced in the pCDH-EF1-T2A-GFP or pLOC lentiviral
vector systems. Progenitor transduction, SL/M2 co-culture, and colony as-
says were performed as previously described (Abrahamsson et al., 2009;
Goff et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2013). Immunocompromised RAG2�/�gc�/�
mice engrafted with human BC CML progenitors were treated for 2 weeks
with SAR302503, dasatinib, or the combination followed by FACS analysis
of human progenitor engraftment in hematopoietic tissues and serial trans-
plantation (Goff et al., 2013). The RNA-seq data accession numbers are
NCBI: PRJNA319866 and PRJNA214016.
RNA and MicroRNA Extraction and qRT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from 20,000 to 50,000 FACS-sorted or CD34+ selected
(MACS, Miltenyi Biotec) progenitors cells from normal cord blood, CP CML,
BC CML or from xenografted mice and complementary DNA was synthesized
according to published methods (Abrahamsson et al., 2009; Goff et al., 2013;
Jiang et al., 2013). Then qRT-PCR was performed in duplicate on an iCycler
with the use of SYBR GreenER qPCR SuperMix (Invitrogen), 5 ng template
mRNA, and 0.2 mM of each forward and reverse primer (Table S6). Human spe-
cific RPL27 primers were used as housekeeping control. miRNA extraction
was performed using the RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. Then, 30 ng cDNA was prepared in a reverse-transcrip-
tion reaction using miScript RTII kit (QIAGEN) and served as a template for the
quantification of the expression of mature miRNA of interest. Also, qRT-PCR
was performed using miRNA human-specific primers and SYBR Green Kit
(QIAGEN). MiScript primers, RNU6_2 (QIAGEN), were used as housekeeping
control. The expression of primary and precursor miRNA transcripts were
measured using previous published primers (Patterson et al., 2014).
Human Progenitor Xenotransplantation and Treatment
Immunocompromised RAG2�/�gc�/� mice were bred and maintained in the
Moores Cancer Center vivarium according to institutional animal care and
use committee (IACUC)-approved protocols. Neonatal mice were trans-
planted intrahepatically with 20,000–100,000 BC CML or human cord blood
CD34+ cells according to our published methods (Abrahamsson et al., 2009;
Goff et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2013). Transplanted mice were FACS screened
for human engraftment in peripheral blood at 6–10 weeks. Engrafted (>1% hu-
man CD45+ cells) mice were treated by oral gavage with SAR302503 (Sanofi-
Aventis) twice daily with 60 mg/kg (0.5% methylcellulose, 20% tween 80, and
H2O), 50 mg/kg dasatinib daily (50% propylene glycol, 50% PBS), combination
(SAR302503 plus dasatinib), or drug vehicles for 2 weeks. Following treatment,
mice were euthanized and single-cell suspensions of hematopoietic tissues
were analyzed by FACS for human engraftment, and 20,000–100,000 human
CD34+ cells were serially transplanted into neonatal RAG2�/�gc�/� mice. A
subgroup of mice was treated for 2 days, and progenitor cells in the bone
marrow were analyzed by qRT-PCR.
