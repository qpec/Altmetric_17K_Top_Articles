Abstract
Various health care bodies (regulatory, health technology assessment, academia, health care providers, scientific journals) request
patient input in their decision-making processes. This represents a shift from disease-centered to patient-centered approaches to
health care. What does this “patient centricity“ mean for the pharmaceutical industry? A panel of senior pharmaceutical industry
representatives discussed the following key issues: why the pharmaceutical industry needs to be part of the patient-centric
movement; how the industry can become patient-centric; and what a patient-centric company actually does. We summarize the
panel’s point of view on these key questions. The industry’s role has been to develop the science and medicines for prevention or
treatment of disease. In response to changes in the current health care environment, the industry should focus its efforts on
initiatives that will improve impact and value for patients and carers. True patient centricity requires a change in the industry’s
cultural mindset, an increase in public trust, clearer roles and responsibilities within pharmaceutical organizations, openness to
learn from others, and a framework to measure success. There are examples of industry engagement with patients throughout
the drug discovery and development process. Patient-reported outcomes are becoming increasingly important endpoints in trials;
they capture information of relevance to patients, identify preferences, and better inform treatment decision making. Under-
standing the patient experience can improve disease management at critical points in the disease course. The future of patient
centricity lies in coordinated efforts by and alignment of multiple health care stakeholders, which can only be achieved through
collaborations and consortia, with the industry playing a key role.

Introduction: Problem Statement
Today, patients are more knowledgeable than ever before. The
technological and scientific advances of recent years have
enabled easy access to information; patients are online and can
connect with peers, exchange experiences and knowledge in
real time, take part in advocacy and patient support groups, and
contribute to real-time data generation.1,2 As a result, patients
feel empowered and expect their voice to be heard.3
Patients are increasingly being recognized as important sta-
keholders in the health care dialogue: regulatory agencies
(Food and Drug Administration [FDA] and European Medi-
cines Agency [EMA]), academia, and health care providers are
requesting patient input into their decision making.4-7 In 2014,
the British Medical Journal launched a “Partnering With
Patients” initiative that requires clinical trials publications to
include the patient perspective by having patients as authors,
peer-reviewers, guest editors, and contributors to the journal.8
Moreover, decisions about medicine reimbursement are
becoming increasingly dependent on the demonstrated value
of medicines to patients. Therefore, payers are seeking evidence
in the form of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and are involv-
ing patients in health-technology assessments (HTAs).9,10
This shift in the social landscape is accompanied by increased
pressure on health care costs,11 with tension arising between the
desiretoactinthebestinterestsofindividualpatients(individualized
care) and taking into account the larger economic considerations.
This disconnect is limited not only to the pharmaceutical industry
but also exists for health care providers and health care payers.

 Patient Centricity—An Appropriate
Response to Shifts in the Social and
Economic Environment?
Patient centricity can be simply defined as integrated mea-
sures for listening to and partnering with patients, and placing
patient well-being at the core of all initiatives. In essence, it
represents a holistic approach to disease management.
Although many agree that patient centricity is a concept to
be embraced, there is still little published guidance and, in
practice, significant variability12 exists in its implementation
by the pharmaceutical industry. Why is patient centricity
coming to the fore today? Is it a reaction to the changing
environment of a world in which patients are ever more con-
nected and informed, or is it the realization of an ethical
responsibility across the health care system? Is it realistic for
a company operating in a commercial environment to place
patients at the heart of everything that it does?
The Renaissance Europe Patient Centricity meeting was
held on Wednesday, March 16, 2016, in London. An expert
faculty (representing a range of committed pharmaceutical
companies and including patient advocacy, regulatory, and
health care practitioner perspectives) and a dedicated audience
of senior industry representatives debated the role of the phar-
maceutical industry in the patient-centric movement. The
meeting addressed the following key questions:
1.
Why does the pharmaceutical industry need to be part
of the patient-centric movement?
2.
How can the pharmaceutical industry become patient-
centric in a real way in a modern business environment?
3.
What does a patient-centric company actually do?
Why Does the Pharmaceutical Industry Need to Be Part
of the Patient-Centric Movement?
Transformation into a patient-centric organization requires an
answer to this key question: why are we doing this?13 As in any
organization, establishing the purpose and vision first will
determine the subsequent plan and actions (how and what) and
create alignment among employees toward a common cause.13
Historically, the pharmaceutical industry’s role has been to
develop the science and medicines for prevention or treatment
of disease. Patient centricity involves the patient in this scien-
tific process. In essence, this is an innovative mindset whereby
the industry is challenged to engage and collaborate with
patients when deciding the best course of action. Therefore,
patient-centric initiatives should start with a simple question:
how can we make a difference for patients?
Is patient centricity feasible from a commercial standpoint?
It is accepted that pharmaceutical companies need to make
profit. It is how they get and use that profit that is important,
and this must be aligned with any assertion of patient centricity.
If the vision is directed at providing value to patients and
carers, companies must be seen to be breaking out of the cycle
of “recover costs of R&D—make profit—invest in new
drugs—make more profit.” This commitment, in turn, will help
to generate credibility with external stakeholders (patients, reg-
ulatory, media, etc.).
How Can the Pharmaceutical Industry Become Patient-
Centric in a Modern Business Environment?
Shifting the cultural mindset
Patient centricity demands a shift in cultural mindset within the
pharmaceutical industry. At the highest level, it involves listen-
ing to and partnering with the patient, and understanding the
patient perspective, rather than simply inserting patient views
into the established process. Only then can patient-centered
outcomes truly be the core of the strategy.
This change in mindset requires leadership from the top and
drives the need to redefine core strategy, organizational struc-
ture and processes, and capabilities to focus on transparency
and value for the patient. A shift from a disease-centered to a
patient-centered strategy, and from a product-led to a patient-
led development process, requires a change in outlook. A cor-
responding change in organizational model is also needed, with
medical affairs, market access, regulatory, pharmacovigilance,
and commercial teams at global and regional levels all colla-
borating with a common goal—to capture patient perspectives
and insights and to respond to their needs. If patient centricity is
to be the responsibility of everyone in a pharmaceutical com-
pany, key development and performance indicators (and pos-
sibly remuneration structures) should be adapted to reflect this
change in mindset. These performance indicators could include
the proportion of product strategies that are based on true
patient input, the number of patients involved, patient feed-
back based on ratings of patients’ involvement (eg, how
engaged/involved/satisfied they feel), number of study proto-
col revisions implemented as a consequence of patient
input,14 the relevance of new product profiles to the self-
identified needs of the patients, and improving the informa-
tion available to patients and prescribing physicians on the
risks and benefits of a treatment, so that better decisions for
the patient can be made.
Building trust
One thing is clear: if the call is patient centricity, then the
pharmaceutical industry has to be earnest about making it hap-
pen, not just using it as a means to seem more patient oriented.
Indeed, the starting point of placing the patient at the heart of
health care initiatives is trust. The industry has started to
address questions about past behavior and public perception,
and this positive intent, direction, and action is a vital compo-
nent of rebuilding the industry’s reputation and forming the
foundation for new trusted partnerships.
Trust between the pharmaceutical industry and the public
can be built through clear communication about medicines’
risk-benefit profiles and a transparent drug development pro-
cess. In this context, the relationships between patients, indus-
try, and health care practitioners are essential to building
du Plessis et al
461
 credibility: “trust your doctor, trust the medicine, and trust
the data.”
One way for pharmaceutical companies to build trust is to
collaborate on the development of new patient-centered end-
points. In the context of the Critical Path Institute Patient-
Reported Outcome Consortium,15 10 diseased-focused work-
ing groups composed of representatives of pharmaceutical
companies and government/regulatory agencies (FDA, EMA,
and the National Institutes of Health [NIH]) are currently col-
laborating to share data and develop standardized PRO end-
point measures. This precompetitive initiative aims to
standardize PRO endpoint measures in order to facilitate com-
parisons and efficiencies in regulatory and payer decision mak-
ing (also discussed later). A unified industry approach to
collaboration with the appropriate parties is the key to the
adoption of patient centricity across the industry, and to
improving credibility. In addition, many pharmaceutical com-
panies have transparency initiatives; for example, GlaxoS-
mithKline has several transparency initiatives aimed at
building trust (Table 1).16,17
Learning from others and collaboration
Creating a patient-centric culture requires an understanding of
its implications for information flow, decision-making pro-
cesses, and institutional habits. To achieve this, the pharma-
ceutical industry could gain insights from organizations that
already have experience with patient interaction. For example,
the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Out-
comes Research (ISPOR) has a patient-centered special interest
working group18; the Medical Device Innovation Consortium
(MDIC) is a partnership between public and private stake-
holders in the medical device industry19; the European
Patients’ Academy on Therapeutic Innovation (EUPATI) is a
collaboration between 33 different patient organizations, uni-
versities, and pharmaceutical companies across Europe; the
International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers &
Associations (IFPMA)20 brings together regional/national
patient associations and research-based biopharmaceutical
companies. Furthermore, there is an ongoing collaboration
between the FDA and EMA on patient involvement, that is,
the FDA/EMA Patient Engagement Cluster, which enables the
agencies to share best practices for patient selection and train-
ing throughout drug regulatory life cycles. The Patient Engage-
ment Cluster focuses on cancer treatment and orphan drugs,
among other topics.21,22
Multiple groups, including regulatory bodies (EMA), the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE),23
different HTA groups,24,25 and others26,27 have already estab-
lished frameworks for patient engagement. For instance, there
is a Consensus Framework for Ethical Collaboration28 that
helps guide interactions between patients, pharmaceutical
companies, and health care professionals. The Interest Group
on Patient and Citizen Involvement of Health Technology
Assessment international (HTAi) has developed a set of val-
ues and quality standards for involving patients in HTA.24
Furthermore, the MDIC has also established a framework for
introducing patient preference information into regulatory
risk-benefit assessments, specifically on medical devices.19
It is taking in the lessons learned by these collaborations and
consortia that will help pharmaceutical companies reduce bar-
riers to patient engagement.29
What are the challenges?
Several challenges exist that need to be overcome before the
pharmaceutical industry can adopt the patient centricity con-
cept.7,10,30 Challenges to address include skepticism about
commercial success; lack of process standardization as it
relates to involving lay people in a highly regulated environ-
ment; lack of sufficient sharing of practices and lessons learned
across the industry; lack of understanding of, and respect for,
qualitative research methods that often form the foundation of
patient centricity research; lack of alignment and measure-
ments of collective progress; internal habits of going back to
established information sources (“let’s just ask the clinicians”);
compliance frameworks and the perception that direct engage-
ment of industry with patients is inappropriate or unauthorized;
and last but not the least, the conflict of responsibilities: the
perception that industry should not be the party that engages
with patients.
Most of these challenges concern the pharmaceutical indus-
try as a whole and can only be solved in a collaborative fashion,
as discussed above. Some solutions are beginning to emerge,
highlighting the need to share and learn from each other’s
experiences. For instance, a compliance framework has already
been developed and is available to guide that direct engage-
ment with patients by industry.31
What Does a Patient-Centric Company Actually Do?
Pharmaceutical companies are at different stages along the
patient-centric journey. The following section aims to highlight
patient-centric initiatives taken by pharmaceutical companies
that have adopted patient centricity as a strategy.
Table 1. Examples of Initiatives at GSK Aimed at Building Trust With
Patients and Physicians.
Engagement with patients can only be possible if there is credibility:
�
Change in marketing practices: In 2011, GSK eliminated
prescription sale targets in the US and introduced a new
incentive model for sales and marketing practices based on
value and feedback from prescribers; external speakers/
convention travel support was discontinued (2016).
�
Clinical transparency: Since 2013 GSK has committed to
promote transparency of clinical research and is a leading
example in the pharmaceutical industry—it was the first
company to grant access to anonymized patient data; the
All trials campaign (2013) commits to publishing all trial data;
the GSK patient-level data access site has become a
multisponsored portal (2014).

 Moving from a brand focus to a patient-value focus
A shift in the industry environment and patient empowerment
is dictating a change in how health care solutions are designed.
We recognize that patient expectations and needs can differ
considerably from the aims and objectives of health care pro-
viders, at both the policy and delivery levels. In fact, to be
accepted by patients, the patient experience should be the key
driver for the development of solutions (eg, medicines, devices,
information, support programs, apps). A better understanding
of patient experience at critical points (breakpoints) in the
course of the disease will help to determine breakpoints that
would benefit from pharmaceutical industry input (Table 2).
Roundtable discussions involving patients, or “patient value
tables,” can be used to validate patient needs and understand
the solutions patients seek, or assess the effects of solutions
already in place. UCB has involved patients in all internal
meetings since 2002 and uses patient value discussions
between patients, health care providers, regulators, and payers.
AstraZeneca engages with patients through research and
therapeutic area collaborations using online patient platforms
and networks (Table 3). Essentially, capturing information
about the patient journey and gaining an understanding of
patient needs will help to develop a true patient-led strategy
within the industry and design solutions that treat the patient
and not just the disease.
Involving patients in research and development
Another approach to patient centricity is promoting patient
involvement throughout the drug discovery and development
process (Figure 1).5,32,33 Patient advisory groups already
provide input on unmet needs, protocol design, trial conduct,
data interpretation and dissemination, risk-benefit discussions,
risk management plans (risk evaluation and mitigation strate-
gies), and the interpretation of value of treatment relevant to
conversations with payers. However, the degree of input from
patients, the frameworks used to gain input, and the implica-
tions of their input are not consistent across the industry.
Patient engagement in research and development is expected
to provide benefits at various stages of the drug development
process, which include
–
identification of unmet patient needs, enabling better-
informed decision-making about target choices and the
required asset profiles for go/no go decisions;
–
study designs and endpoints that are more relevant to
patients, which in turn improves recruitment and reten-
tion and provides regulatory and reimbursement deci-
sion makers with clear patient-relevant evidence;
–
shorter trial cycle time, so medicines can move more
quickly to regulatory submission;
–
a greater range of products that are of greater value to
more patients;
–
improved patient adherence to drug regimens, leading to
improved outcomes for patients; and
–
a growing body of evidence of patient preferences and
unmet needs that will help focus future research.
There is emerging evidence supporting the value associated
with patient engagement in the drug development and discovery
process.33,34 Considerable progress has already been made in this
direction, led by the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative35
and a number of concrete examples of engagement between phar-
maceutical companies and patients.36,37 However, the degree of
input from patients, the frameworks used to gain input, and the
implications of their input are not consistent across the industry.12
Therefore, the industry as a whole should aim to standardize and
increase patient involvement in research and development as a
priority if its goal is patient centricity.
Table 2. Example of Patient-Led Value Strategy at the
biopharmaceutical company UCB.
Replacement of “ brand strategy” with “ patient strategy” is not
enough. This process should start with the patient (rather than the
commercial product) foremost in mind. Long-term strategy should
be based on understanding of the patient journey and critical points
(breakpoints) in the course of the disease. Typical breakpoints for
potential involvement include diagnosis, new symptom
development, relapse, start of a new medication, and emergent
adverse events.
As an example, UCB has a medication for Parkinson disease:
�
Patients with Parkinson disease need to take their medication
at the same time each day as their motor function can be very
sensitive to changes in this rhythm
�
If these patients are hospitalized for a different reason, the
hospital rarely has the medication for control of motor
symptoms readily available; intake is delayed, the patient’s
condition deteriorates, and they spend 2-3 days longer in the
hospital than if appropriate medication were readily available.
�
Understanding this scenario helped UCB to implement relevant
solutions in collaboration with treating hospitals, ensuring these
medications were available; this in turn led to a decrease in
hospitalization duration for patients with Parkinson disease.
�
Thus, insights into breakpoints in the disease can help to
provide better outcomes for patients.
Table 3. AstraZeneca’s Approach to Patient Centricity.
�
AstraZeneca has a focus group to internally facilitate patient
centricity (PaCe): according to AstraZeneca (“put the patients
first”), patient centricity is the open and sustained engagement
of the patient to respectfully and compassionately achieve the
best experience and outcome for that person and their family;
in this conceptual model, patient insights drive innovative
solutions that in turn create positive effects for the patient.
�
The PaCe approach engages with patients through several
research and therapeutic areas collaboration with
PatientsLikeMe; more than 30,000 patients are now connected
with AstraZeneca research projects.
�
AstraZeneca is also setting up disease-specific networks
and patient/carer networks (eg, Patient Expert Network) to
advise the development/brand teams on the co-creation
of patient solutions.

 Standardizing PROs
The industry has a responsibility to provide information about
medicines that will be relevant to patients. But what informa-
tion are patients looking for? A patient would want to know,
What can I expect in terms of symptoms/side-effects? How will
I feel? and What will I be able to do?
Measuring treatment benefit versus risk from patients’ per-
spectives is important because it highlights the value of treat-
ment. The FDA defines PRO measures as “any report of the
status of a patient’s health condition that comes directly from
the patient, without interpretation of the patient’s response by
a clinician or anyone else.”38 As only patients can report how
they feel and function, this generates a need to define end-
points that are important and relevant to patients.39,40 PRO
assessments are increasingly becoming the primary trusted
evidence for all stakeholders, including payers, regulators,
and patients.
The use of PRO measures in the industry began many
years ago, as health-related quality-of-life instruments
included in clinical trials. Although many expert centers
develop and validate PRO tools, there remains a gap
between ensuring that adequate patient input has been
sought at the beginning of the development of the tools
(eg, truly reflecting the patients’ experience of a disease)
and the experts’ view of the patient experience. For exam-
ple, a recent report showed low and variable rates of patient
involvement in the development of PRO measures, with
only 6.7% of patients involved in all stages (item develop-
ment, item testing, item selection).41
Patient-centered drug development is expected to change
the way the pharmaceutical industry operates. PRO tools and
measures are ideally developed in a precompetitive collabora-
tive way, to set standards across all medicines.15,42,43 A stan-
dardized approach will provide easier, more straightforward
assessment by all key stakeholders, including regulators
(FDA38 and EMA44), patients, prescribers, payers, and every-
one who reviews the data.
Expert Patients
Regulators (FDA, EMA), HTA bodies, NICE,45 and consor-
tia46 all seek to involve educated patients as advisors (expert
patients) in drug development, evaluation, and regulation.47
Expert patients have in-depth understanding of the disease con-
text, and in most cases they function on patient advisory panels
to provide insights relevant to the patient journey.
The pharmaceutical industry needs to understand the con-
flicts of interest as perceived by other health care players,
such as regulatory bodies or HTA groups, in order to address
them when involving expert patients or know when to step
away. Currently, there are very few expert patients across a
small number of well-represented diseases. A need exists to
expand the pool of expert patients across a wide range of
diseases.
Concluding Remarks
Bringing patient centricity to life—role of the pharmaceutical
industry
Bringing patient centricity to life requires a vision shared by
all stakeholders. We believe that the key steps the industry
needs to take in order to make this happen are (1) change the
mindset—make patient centricity a company-wide and
industry-wide vision; (2) collaborate—involve patients and
other health care stakeholders to develop patient-centric solu-
tions; (3) share the learning—challenge the status quo, record
the experience, learn from it, and share it in order that the
industry may get better at being truly patient-centric. There-
fore, we encourage colleagues to publish case studies of what
is working well in order to keep the discussion alive and
advance our collective learning.
In summary, a transformation into a patient-centric organi-
zation requires defining the answers to the following key ques-
tions: Why are we doing this? How should we do it? and What
are the results we aim to achieve? (Figure 2). Historically, the
pharmaceutical industry’s role has been to develop the science
and medicines for prevention or treatment of disease. Patient
centricity is an innovative mindset whereby we are challenged
to engage and collaborate with patients to get critical input for
determining the best strategy to improve patient outcomes.
This change from a brand focus to a patient-value focus
requires leadership from the top and drives the need to redefine
strategy, organizational structure and processes, and capabil-
ities to focus on transparency, credibility, and value for the
patient.
The industry is a major stakeholder in making patient cen-
tricity a reality, but cannot bring this about alone, or set the
agenda. Equally, however, neither can medical professionals,
government, or policy makers. How and with whom to partner
is the key challenge. The future of patient centricity lies in
coordinated efforts and alignment of multiple health care

 stakeholders. Patient centricity can be achieved only through
collaborations and consortia that include all health care stake-
holders, in which the pharmaceutical industry has a key role.
