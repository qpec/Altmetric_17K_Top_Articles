Abstract
Time spent in the doctor’s waiting room captures an important aspect of the healthcare experience. 
We analyzed data on 21 million outpatient visits obtained from electronic health record systems, 
allowing us to measure time spent in the waiting room beyond the scheduled appointment time. 
Median wait time was just over 4 minutes. Almost one-fifth of visits had waits longer than 20 
minutes, and 10% were over 30 minutes. Waits were shorter for early morning appointments, 
younger patients, and at larger practices. Median wait time was 4.1 minutes for privately-insured 
and 4.6 minutes for Medicaid patients; adjusting for patient and appointment characteristics, 
Medicaid patients were 20% more likely than the privately-insured to wait longer than 20 minutes 
(P<0.001), with most of this disparity explained by differences in practices and providers they saw. 
Wait time for Medicaid patients relative to the privately-insured was longer in states with relatively 
lower Medicaid reimbursement rates.
Introduction
Anyone who has ever spent time sitting in a doctor’s office waiting for her appointment to 
begin must have wondered whether her experience was typical. Wait times to see physicians 
are a source of potential frustration and dissatisfaction with care quality, as well as lost 
productivity for individual patients. This study examined the time spent waiting in the 
doctor’s office beyond the scheduled appointment time (hereafter, “wait time”) using 
detailed administrative data on over 21 million outpatient visits. We quantified how wait 
time varied across patient, visit, and provider characteristics.
We then specifically examined the experience of Medicaid patients relative to privately 
insured individuals. Differences in wait times between Medicaid and privately insured 
patients may capture an important aspect of differences in the (non-health) quality of their 
healthcare experience. The results may therefore shed light on issues of timely and equitable 
care, two of the six aims for improvement in the Institute of Medicine’s Crossing the Quality 
Chasm Report.1

 Existing studies comparing quality of care by insurance status typically examined 
differences in health outcomes from specific treatments2;3 or rates of receipt of appropriate 
care.4;5 Such comparisons may be contaminated by underlying health differences in the 
different populations;6 this is less likely to be a concern with a wait time measure. The few 
existing studies of wait time in an outpatient setting have been based on survey responses 
regarding “perceived time in the waiting room”7 or total clinic time.8 A larger literature on 
wait times in the emergency department is also based on such survey measures which may 
suffer from systematic response or recall biases,9–11 issues that are less likely to arise with 
our administrative data.
Our analysis of wait-time differentials for Medicaid patients complements work 
documenting other disparities in healthcare faced by Medicaid patients. Physician self-
reports and audit studies have found that Medicaid patients have to wait longer to schedule 
outpatient appointments,12–24 and that they were more likely to face barriers to care.25
Study Data and Methods
Data
The de-identified data were provided by athenahealth, a large national provider of electronic 
health records, electronic medical billing, and practice management software. The data 
covered all outpatient visits during calendar year 2013 that were associated with medical 
practices that have the company’s software installed.
The software captured the timing of key stages of every medical appointment. Our primary 
outcome variable was an estimate of the length of time a patient waited before the 
appointment began. We measured waiting as beginning when the patient arrives at the 
practice and checks in at the front desk, or at the time for which the appointment was 
scheduled, whichever is later. Waiting ended when the patient saw a medical practitioner. 
This is measured by the first keystroke or mouse click in the “intake” phase of the software; 
the measure therefore assumes that user activity occurs promptly at the start of intake. Wait 
time was negative if the patient arrived early and was seen prior to the originally scheduled 
time of the appointment; this was done so that we did not attribute long wait times to early 
arrivals. We also analyzed the patient’s arrival time relative to the original scheduled time of 
the appointment.
The data also contained rich information on the patients and their care from linked billing 
information. For each visit we observed the specialty of the primary medical professional 
seen, and (masked) identifiers of the medical practice and the primary medical professional. 
We also observed the patient’s age, gender, census region of residence, the primary payer 
(insurer) of the medical bill, up to eight diagnosis codes (International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification), the procedures that were performed 
(Current Procedure Terminology (CPT) codes), allowable charges, and transacted payments. 
We grouped the primary payer type into five categories: private, Medicaid, Medicare, self-
pay, or “other.” We used the CPT codes to construct total work relative value units (RVUs) 
by summing the work component of RVUs for each CPT billed during the visit. RVUs are a 
standard summary measure of the intensity of the visit and form the basis for Medicare

 reimbursement.26 We used “allowable charges” – which are extremely similar to “transacted 
payments” – to measure reimbursement rates. Due to delays in implementing planned 2013 
and 2014 Medicaid rate increases under the Affordable Care Act (ACA),27 our 2013 data 
primarily reflected 2012 (that is, prior to the temporary ACA rate increase) Medicaid 
payment rates; see Appendix Section 1 for details.28 MIT’s institutional review board 
reviewed this study and granted exempt status (protocol #: 1509231371).
Statistical analysis
We summarized the median wait time for all patients and stratified by patient age, gender, 
region of residence, primary insurance, the time of day of the visit, practice size, and 
physician specialty.
To compare wait times for Medicaid patients to wait times for the privately insured, we 
analyzed a linear probability model in which the dependent variable was an indicator 
variable for whether wait time was longer than 20 minutes. The key explanatory variable 
was an indicator variable for whether the patient was covered by Medicaid, as opposed to 
privately insured. Results were similar for other definitions of wait times (e.g. longer than 
15, 30, or 40 minutes).
We first report results from a univariate model, and then adjust for available confounders 
using various characteristics of the patient and the visit. We also quantify the extent to which 
longer wait times of Medicaid patients could be explained by differences in the types of 
practices or physicians they visited by adding indicator variables for the particular practice 
and the particular medical professional within the practice. Finally, we allow the difference 
in wait time between Medicaid and privately insured patients to vary with the patient’s state 
of residence and examine the correlation between the relative generosity by which 
physicians are compensated for seeing Medicaid patients compared to privately insured 
patients and the relative wait times of Medicaid patients; Appendix Section 3 provides more 
detail on this specification.28
Limitations
One potential limitation is that we analyzed a convenience sample of ambulatory practices 
that use a particular billing software. However, visits in our data appeared similar along most 
patient and physician characteristics to the 2012 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey 
(NAMCS),29 which was designed to be representative of all outpatient visits in the United 
States (Appendix Exhibit A1).28 A notable exception is that larger physician groups were 
overrepresented and solo practices were under-represented in our sample, presumably due to 
the greater propensity of larger practices to adopt information technology products such as 
this particular billing software. In addition, certain census regions – such as the Atlantic 
South – appear over-represented. Our sample had a higher share of patients covered by 
private insurance compared to the NAMCS while the share of patients covered by Medicaid 
was similar; see Appendix Section 2 for details.28 While we control for these observable 
differences across providers, there could be unobservable differences in provider objectives 
or key attributes of the physicians that we are unable to account for in this analysis.

 Another potential limitation is that our measure of wait time was based on time stamps, 
which may not have always been accurately recorded. However, as long as the measurement 
error is similar across types of patients and visits, it should not bias comparisons of wait 
time across groups such as patients of different insurance status.
Finally, we measured only one aspect of wait time. We could not measure any additional 
wait time inside the physician’s examination room; prior work has measured the combined 
time spent waiting for and obtaining outpatient medical care from self reports, but has been 
unable to distinguish between the two.8 We also could not measure wait time to schedule an 
appointment. This has been the focus of other studies that found, based on physician self 
reports and audit studies, that Medicaid patients had to wait longer to schedule outpatient 
appointments.12–16;23;24
Results
Wait and arrival times
We observed claim, billing, demographic, and wait time data for 21.4 million visits from 
2,581 unique practices. Exhibit 1 shows the distribution of wait time for the entire baseline 
sample, and separately for Medicaid and for privately insured patients. Across all patients, 
32.8% of patients had negative wait time, meaning that they arrived and began their 
appointment before its originally scheduled time. The median wait time was 4.1 minutes; 
among individuals who have a positive wait time, median wait time is 9.5 minutes. Across 
all patient visits, 17% had a wait time longer than 20 minutes, 10% longer than 30 minutes, 
and 5% over 45 minutes.
We present descriptive statistics on how wait times and arrival times varied across patient 
and provider characteristics in Exhibit 2. Looking at the share of visits with wait times over 
20 minutes, we find that wait times were lower for early morning appointments, younger 
patients, and at larger practices. Wait times were longer for female patients; this may 
partially be explained by differences in wait times across specialties. Appendix Exhibit A2 
documents that, across physician specialties, wait times were longer for visits with 
obstetricians/gynecologists, general surgeons and ophthalmologists, and shortest for 
psychiatry, dermatology and pediatrics.28 It also shows variation in wait time by 
geograpahy: wait times were shortest in New England and longest in the East South Central 
of the United States, where they were three times higher than in New England. This is in 
contrast to the literature on appointment wait times, which has found that scheduling lead 
times were higher in Massachusetts.23;24
Medicaid patients had longer wait times than privately insured patients. The median wait 
time for Medicaid patients was 4.6 minutes, compared to 4.1 minutes for the privately 
insured. In addition, 18.0% of visits for Medicaid patients had a wait time of over 20 
minutes compared to 16.3% for the privately insured. In contrast, Medicare patients had 
shorter median wait times but a greater share of visits with long wait times, again compared 
to the privately insured. Most of these differences are explained by the age distribution of 
Medicare patients. Visits by patients who paid by themselves also had longer wait times.

 Median arrival time was approximately 6 minutes prior to the start of the appointment. 
About two thirds of patients arrived on time – i.e. before the start of the appointment – with 
the elderly being the most punctual age group; young children arrived late for over 40% of 
their visits. Patients were least likely to arrive on time to morning appointments and to 
practices with a single physician. Across specialties, dermatology was associated with the 
most punctual patients, while physician assistants were most likely to experience late 
arrivals; see Appendix Exhibit A2.28
Longer wait time for Medicaid patients
Exhibit 1 shows that Medicaid patients had a greater share of visits with long wait times. 
They also had a smaller share of visits with negative wait times, reflecting the fact that 
Medicaid patients were more likely to arrive late for their appointments (Exhibit 2 and 
Appendix Exhibit A3).28
Exhibit 3 compares wait times for Medicaid and privately insured patients. Column (1) 
shows the raw differences in wait times. We find that 16.3% of privately insured patients 
waited longer than 20 minutes; Medicaid patients were 1.7 percentage points (P < 0.001) 
more likely than privately insured patients to wait 20 minutes or longer, a relative increase of 
10%. Some of this could reflect differences between Medicaid and privately insured patients 
in arrival time, or other patient and appointment characteristics. Column (2) therefore 
controls flexibly for the arrival time of the patient relative to their scheduled appointment 
time, as well as for a rich set of available confounders about the patient (age, gender, and 
census region) and the appointment (the visit’s log RVUs, the physician’s specialty, the day 
of the week of the appointment, and the time of day of the appointment). Controlling for 
these characteristics doubled the difference in wait time between Medicaid and privately 
insured patients, with Medicaid patients now 3.4 percentage points (P < 0.001) more likely 
than privately insured patients to wait 20 minutes or longer, or 21% more likely to wait 20 
minutes or longer than privately insured patients. Column (3) controls for the diagnosis 
codes associated with the visit, which does little to affect the results reported in column (2). 
This supports our hypothesis that differences in wait times are not contaminated by 
differences in health characteristics between Medicaid and privately insured patients.
About half of the difference in wait time between Medicaid and privately insured patients in 
column (2) can be explained by differences in the practices that Medicaid patients visit. The 
difference in wait time falls to 1.5 percentage points (P = 0.03), a relative increase of 9%, 
once we condition on which practice the patient attended in column (4). This is particularly 
striking given that variation across practices explains only 10% of the overall variation in 
wait time across all visits (not shown).
Another quarter of the difference in wait time between Medicaid and privately insured 
patients from column (2) can be explained by differences in the identity of the medical 
practitioners whom patients saw within the practice; column (5) shows that, even among 
visits to the same practice and physician, Medicaid patients were associated with a 0.9 
percentage point (P < 0.001) greater propensity to wait 20 minutes or longer (a relative 
increase of 6%).

 These results are robust to a number of sensitivity analyses. These include analyzing wait 
times of longer than 15 minutes, longer than 30 minutes or longer than 40 minutes 
(Appendix Exhibit A4), analyzing wait times separately by arrival time (Appendix Exhibit 
A5) and excluding visits to nurse practitioners and physician assistants from the analysis 
(Appendix Exhibit A6), and analyzing wait times separately by practice size (Appendix 
Exhibit A7).28
Private-Medicaid Wait Time Differences by State
Medicaid payment rates are set at the state level; the relative generosity of Medicaid 
reimbursement therefore varies across states. Exhibit 4 examines how the relative wait time 
of Medicaid patients compared to privately insured patients varied across states with 
different relative reimbursement rates for Medicaid compared to private insurance. Both the 
difference in wait time by state (vertical axis) and the difference in reimbursement rates by 
state (horizontal axis) control for all patient and visit characteristics included in Exhibit 3 
column (2), except census region. The figure shows a negative relationship between relative 
wait times and reimbursement rates; states with higher Medicaid reimbursement rates had 
(relatively) shorter Medicaid wait times.
Discussion
Patient wait time is an important component of the quality of the overall healthcare 
experience. We provided a largescale study of wait time for ambulatory care in the United 
States, using data on over 21 million outpatient visits. Median wait time was less than 5 
minutes, but almost one-fifth of patients waited longer than 20 minutes, and 5% waited 
longer than 45 minutes. Wait times were lower for early morning appointments, for younger 
patients, and in larger practices.
Medicaid patients experienced significantly longer wait-times than the privately insured. 
Adjusting for patient and appointment characteristics, Medicaid patients were 20% more 
likely than private patients to wait 20 minutes or longer. A key driver of this discrepancy was 
differences in the practices and providers whom Medicaid patients visit. This supports 
previous research suggesting that practices and physicians that disproportionately serve 
Medicaid patients differ in other aspects of the care environment; these differences include 
differences in practice location such as per capita income and urban status30–33 and 
physician characteristics such as medical school attended, years practicing, and probability 
of being board certified.31;33;34
However, even when they saw the same physician in the same practice, Medicaid patients 
waited 5% longer than privately insured patients. This is somewhat harder to interpret. It is 
possible that this reflects provider triaging of patients by insurance status. Alternately, it 
could reflect assortative scheduling; since the data show that Medicaid patients were more 
likely to be late to their appointments, days with many Medicaid patients could put practices 
behind schedule.
We also found that Medicaid patients were especially likely to wait longer than private 
patients in states with less generous Medicaid reimbursement rates. One potential

 explanation for this correlation is that in higher reimbursement states Medicaid patients have 
more access to high quality practices and providers. Physician surveys suggest that higher 
reimbursement is positively correlated with their willingness to accept Medicaid patients.
30;32–34 These results are intriguing in the context of the ongoing policy debate around 
Medicaid reimbursement rates. Concerns about whether Medicaid patients face barriers to 
accessing high quality care are widespread, particularly in light of historically low 
reimbursement rates for Medicaid patients.23;35–38
This work is, to our knowledge, the first large-scale administrative study of wait times in an 
ambulatory setting, allowing us to document the distribution of wait times, patterns of wait 
times across patient and provider characteristics, and decomposition of wait time 
differences. Our analysis complements other studies that found lower health quality of care 
received by Medicaid patients from examining health outcomes from specific treatments2;3 
or rates of receipt of appropriate care.4;5 Our non-health quality measure captures a different 
aspect of the care experience for Medicaid patients. It avoids some of the challenges in 
measuring care quality and its differences across populations, including biases from self 
reports, classification errors in determining appropriate care, and, most importantly, health 
differences between Medicaid and privately insured patients.6 In particular, wait time 
differences between Medicaid and privately insured patients are not affected by differences 
in the observable health of these populations, as reflected by diagnosis codes. However, 
differences in wait time for Medicaid and privately insured patients could potentially reflect 
other differences between such patients, such as income, rather than insurance per se. This 
may have implications for the efficiency of differential wait times, as higher income patients 
forego higher potential wages when they wait in physician’s offices.
Conclusion
Our results provide new evidence about how long patients wait to see their doctors, and how 
much longer Medicaid patients wait. Wait time is one component of quality of care and may 
proxy for other aspects of the healthcare experience. Medicaid patients wait even longer 
relatively to privately insured patients in states with lower Medicaid reimbursement rates.

distribution and the top 5%. The gray line shows it for the entire baseline sample (except the 
trimmed outliers; N = 19.3 million), and then separately for Medicaid (black; N = 2.1 
million) and privately-insured (dashed; N = 12.3 million) patients.

 Exhibit 4. Relationship Betweeen Differences in Wait Times and Reimbursement Rates Between 
Medicaid and Private Insurance, by State
Source/Notes: SOURCE Author’s analysis of data from athenahealth NOTES Figure plots 
the difference in relative Medicaid wait time against relative Medicaid log reimbursement 
rates. The former is computed by regressing an indicator variable for waiting more than 20 
minutes on state identifiers interacted with insurance type, controlling for age bins, gender, 
(natural) log RVUs, day of the week, time of day, arrival time, and physician specialty. The 
difference was then calculated by subtracting the coefficient on private insurance for a given 
state from the coefficient on Medicaid insurance for that state. The latter was computed in an 
analogous way, using (natural) log “allowable charges” as the dependent variable. Each 
point represents a state. The number of Medicaid visits by state ranged from 4,570 (Alaska) 
to 2,214,899 (Texas); we labeled the ten states with the most Medicaid visits. The dashed 
line is the best-fit line, weighted by the number of Medicaid visits, and its estimated slope is 
−0.041 (P < 0.001).

SOURCE Author’s analysis of data from athenahealth. NOTES Table is based on the baseline sample (N=21.4 million). Each observation represents an outpatient visit.
aWait time is the time (in minutes) between the patient’s check-in time or the appointment’s scheduled time (whichever is latest) and the time the patient is seen by a medical practitioner.
bArrival time is the difference (in minutes) between the time the patients checks in and the appointment’s scheduled time. Negative values imply early arrival; Positive values imply late arrival.
cPractice size represents the number of medical practitioners filing claims at the practice.

SOURCE Author’s analysis of data from athenahealth. NOTES Table is based on the baseline sample, restricted to patients with either Medicaid or private insurance (N=15.8 million outpatient visits). The 
mean of the dependent variable for privately insured is 0.1626.
aControls include six bins for patient age (0-4 yrs, 5-14 yrs, 15-24 yrs, 25-44 yrs, 45-64 yrs, 65+ years), patient gender, five time of day bins (before 10am, 10am-12pm, 12pm-2pm, 2pm-4pm, 4pm and 
after), seven days of the week, four arrival binary variables (arrived at least twenty minutes early, arrived at least ten minutes early, arrived on time, and arrived less than ten minutes late). We also control for 
twelve physician specialty groups and total work relative value units associated with the visit which reflects the procedures preformed.
bControls for diagnosis consist of indicator variables for each observed combination of (up to eight) ICD-9 diagnosis codes for the visit.
