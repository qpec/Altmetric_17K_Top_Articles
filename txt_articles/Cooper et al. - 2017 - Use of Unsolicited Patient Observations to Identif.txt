IMPORTANCE Unsolicited patient observations are associated with risk of medical malpractice
claims. Because lawsuits may be triggered by an unexpected adverse outcome superimposed
on a strained patient-physician relationship, a question remains as to whether behaviors that
generate patient dissatisfaction might also contribute to the genesis of adverse outcomes
themselves.
OBJECTIVE To examine whether patients of surgeons with a history of higher numbers of
unsolicited patient observations are at greater risk for postoperative complications than
patients whose surgeons generate fewer such unsolicited patient observations.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study used data from 7
academic medical centers participating in the National Surgical Quality Improvement
Program and the Vanderbilt Patient Advocacy Reporting System from January 1, 2011, to
December 31, 2013. Patients older than 18 years included in the National Surgical Quality
Improvement Program who underwent inpatient or outpatient operations at 1 of the
participating sites during the study period were included. Patients were excluded if the
attending surgeon had less than 24 months of data in the Vanderbilt Patient Advocacy
Reporting System preceding the date of the operation. Data analysis was conducted from
June 1, 2015, to October 20, 2016.
EXPOSURES Unsolicited patient observations for the patient’
s surgeon in the 24 months
preceding the date of the operation.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Postoperative surgical or medical complications as defined
by the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program within 30 days of the operation of
interest.
RESULTS Among the 32 125 patients in the cohort (13 230 men, 18 895 women; mean [SD]
age, 55.8 [15.8] years), 3501 (10.9%) experienced a complication, including 1754 (5.5%)
surgical and 2422 (7.5%) medical complications. Prior unsolicited patient observations for a
surgeon were significantly associated with the risk of a patient having any complication (odds
ratio, 1.0063; 95% CI, 1.0004-1.0123; P = .03), any surgical complication (odds ratio, 1.0104;
95% CI, 1.0022-1.0186; P = .01), any medical complication (odds ratio, 1.0079; 95% CI,
1.0009-1.0148; P = .03), and being readmitted (odds ratio, 1.0088, 95% CI, 1.0024-1.0151;
P = .007). The adjusted rate of complications was 13.9% higher for patients whose surgeon
was in the highest quartile of unsolicited patient observations compared with patients whose
surgeon was in the lowest quartile.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients whose surgeons have large numbers of unsolicited
patient observations in the 24 months prior to the patient’
s operation are at increased risk of
surgical and medical complications. Efforts to promote patient safety and address risk of
malpractice claims should continue to focus on surgeons’ability to communicate respectfully
and effectively with patients and other medical professionals.

 T
he distribution of malpractice claims among physi-
cians is not random; a small number of clinicians ac-
count for a disproportionate share of total cases of and
expenditures associated with malpractice.1-5 Studies de-
signed to understand why some physicians are associated with
greater numbers of malpractice claims have identified cer-
tainsurgicalspecialties,higherclinicalactivityrelativetopeers,
and unsolicited patient observations as associated with higher
risk.4-6 Of the factors identified, however, unsolicited patient
observations have the strongest association with risk of mal-
practice claims.4-6 This finding is not surprising in that inter-
views with families who have filed malpractice lawsuits re-
veal that factors other than money, such as lost trust in the
physicianandanunmetneedforinformation,areprimarydriv-
ers behind patients’and families’desire to sue a physician af-
ter an unexpected adverse outcome.7,8
An intriguing question remains as to whether factors that
generate patient dissatisfaction might also contribute to the
genesisofadverseoutcomesthemselves.Previousstudieshave
shown that failure to model respect affects team perfor-
mance in a variety of clinical settings, including the operat-
ing room.9-15 A recent analysis of unsolicited patient observa-
tionsfromasinglehealthcareorganizationfoundthatsurgeons
with higher numbers of unsolicited patient observations were
associatedwithhigherriskofcomplications,particularlyinthe
most complex surgical cases.16 Collectively, these studies sug-
gest that the surgeons with the highest number of unsolic-
ited patient observations may interact with team members in
the operating room and other perioperative care settings in
ways that could negatively affect team performance and con-
tribute to risk for complications.17,18 We hypothesized that pa-
tients of surgeons with higher numbers of unsolicited patient
observations would be at greater risk for postoperative com-
plications than patients whose surgeons generated fewer such
unsolicited patient observations.
Methods
Setting and Data Sources
We performed a retrospective cohort study to examine the as-
sociation between a patient’
s risk of experiencing a complica-
tion and their surgeon’
s history of unsolicited patient obser-
vationsinthe24monthspriortotheoperation.Thestudyused
data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgi-
cal Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP)19 and the Vander-
bilt Patient Advocacy Reporting System (PARS), an estab-
lished patient reporting system used previously to study
concerns about professionalism and risk of malpractice
claims.20 Seven academic health care systems that partici-
pate in the NSQIP21 and the PARS program contributed data to
the study.4,19 The NSQIP files provided an efficient source for
identifyingthecohortandsupplyinginformationabouttheop-
erations, patient characteristics, and operative characteris-
tics that might be associated with surgical and medical com-
plications. The NSQIP uses a systematic sampling process to
identify cases that is designed to avoid bias in case selection
and to ensure a diverse mix of surgical cases.22,23 Surgical clini-
cal reviewers at each site, who are trained and undergo regu-
larauditsandqualitychecks,collectdataonmorethan150vari-
ables using standardized NSQIP definitions, including
preoperative risk, intraoperative variables, and 30-day post-
operative morbidity and mortality outcomes.22 After data
are uploaded to a central NSQIP site, quality audits are per-
formed to ensure data integrity.22 One site began contribut-
ing data to the NSQIP after 2011; we used data for that site from
thefirstdatethatthesitecontributeddatatotheNSQIPthrough
the end of the study period. The other 6 sites contributed data
throughout the study period. The study was reviewed by the
institutional review boards at each study site, including
Vanderbilt University Medical Center; University of Califor-
nia, Los Angeles Medical Center; University of North Caro-
lina; University of Pennsylvania Health System; Wake Forest
University; Emory University School of Medicine; and Stan-
ford University. The study qualified as nonhuman partici-
pant research pursuant to CFR 46.102(f)(2) because the de-
identified information on individuals in the cohort would not
readily be ascertained by the investigators.
The PARS program includes a reliable system to process
and code unsolicited observations from patients and fami-
lies, which allows identification and intervention with physi-
cians at high risk for malpractice claims.20,24-26 Data from the
PARS program for the study encompassed all previously coded
observations from patients and their families attributed to any
cohort member’
s attending surgeon, as recorded by the medi-
cal center’
s patient relations staff.20,27 Some unsolicited pa-
tient observations described behaviors that might intimidate
or deter communication:
“I asked Dr Y how long he thought the operation would
take. He said, ‘
Look, your wife will die without this proce-
dure. If you want to ask questions instead of allowing me to
do my job, I can just go home and not do it.’
”
“Dr X rushed us through the appointment so quickly; she
didn’
t even explain why she was recommending this proce-
dure over other treatment approaches.”
Other unsolicited patient observations included pa-
tients’observations of a physician’
s disrespectful or rude in-
teraction with other health care team members that might
distract focus:
Key Points
Question Are patients of surgeons with a history of higher
numbers of unsolicited patient observations at greater risk for
postoperative complications than patients whose surgeons
generate fewer such unsolicited patient observations?
Findings Among the 32 125 patients in this cohort study, patients
whose surgeons had a history of higher numbers of unsolicited
patient observations had a significantly increased risk of surgical
and medical complications.
Meaning Efforts to promote patient safety and address risk of
malpractice claims should continue to focus on surgeons’ability to
communicate respectfully and effectively with patients and other
medical professionals.

Cohort and Follow-up
The study cohort included patients in the NSQIP database who
underwent inpatient or outpatient operations between Janu-
ary1,2011,andDecember31,2013,at1oftheparticipatingsites.
Patients were excluded if they were younger than 18 years on
the date of the operation or if the attending surgeon had less
than 24 months of PARS data preceding the date of the opera-
tion. Follow-up for each patient began on the date of the op-
eration, defined as t0, and continued through the subsequent
30 days or death (Figure 1).31
Outcomes
The primary outcome was any postoperative complication, as
defined by the NSQIP, occurring within 30 days of the opera-
tion of interest.22 Surgical site infections and wound disrup-
tions were considered surgical complications. Pulmonary con-
ditions (pneumonia, reintubation, or mechanical ventilation),
renal conditions (renal insufficiency or acute renal failure),
stroke, cardiovascular conditions (cardiac arrest or acute myo-
cardial infarction), thromboembolic conditions (pulmonary
embolism or deep venous thrombosis), and infectious condi-
tions(sepsis,septicshock,orurinarytractinfections)werecon-
sidered medical complications.31 Conditions included in the
group of possible surgical or medical complications that were
presentatthetimeoftheoperativeprocedurewereexcluded.22
Secondaryoutcomesincludedreoperations,readmissions,and
30-day mortality.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted from June 1, 2015, to Octo-
ber 20, 2016. Multivariable logistic regression was used to cre-
ate separate models of the association between the surgeon’
s
total unsolicited patient observations in the 24 months pre-
ceding the date of the operation and the patient’
s risk for any
complication,anysurgicalcomplication,andanymedicalcom-
plication. Regression models using the patient as the unit of
analysis included variables thought to be the most important
potential confounders. Models included total unsolicited pa-
tientobservations,patientfactors(age,sex,race/ethnicity,body
mass index, functional status, American Society of Anesthe-
siologistsclass,ventilatordependence,chronicobstructivepul-
monary disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, renal fail-
ure, and disseminated cancer),22 operative characteristics
(surgeon specialty, number of cases contributed to the study
cohort by the surgeon [as a surrogate for surgical volume], case
urgency, wound classification [ie, clean vs contaminated], op-
erative time >75th percentile for each Current Procedural Ter-
minology code), and deidentified study site. We also analyzed
the risk of complications by quartile of unsolicited patient ob-
servations (quartile 1, 0-4 observations; quartile 2, 5-9 obser-
vations; quartile 3, 10-13 observations; and quartile 4, 14-60
observations) and calculated the adjusted incidence of com-
plications for each quartile by multiplying the unadjusted in-
cidence rate by the rate ratio obtained from logistic regres-
sion models.32 We performed power calculations a priori and
anticipated that, with 80% power, we would have the ability
to detect an increase in complications of 1.7% between pa-
tients whose surgeons had lower numbers of unsolicited pa-
tient observations relative to patients whose surgeons had
higher numbers of unsolicited patient observations.
We used R statistical software, version 3.2.3 (R Founda-
tion for Statistical Computing) to perform all analyses. For
all comparisons, α = .05 denoted a statistically significant
difference.
Results
The cohort included 32 125 patients who underwent an opera-
tion performed by 1 of 817 surgeons during the study period.
Patients in the cohort underwent 17 255 general surgical, 4583
orthopedic, 2288 vascular, 2139 gynecologic, 1810 plastic sur-
gery, 1272 neurosurgical, 1118 otolaryngologic, 1046 urologic,
606 cardiothoracic, and 8 other specialty (not specified by the
NSQIP) operations. In the 24 months preceding the date of the
operations,surgeonsofcohortpatientsreceivedameanof10.6

Among the patients in the cohort, 3501 (10.9%) experi-
enced any complication, including 1754 (5.5%) surgical and
2422 (7.5%) medical complications (Table 2). Within 30 days,
1326 patients (4.1%) had to return to the operating room, 2436
(7.6%) were readmitted, and 427 (1.3%) died. Patients whose
surgeons were named in more unsolicited patient observa-
tions had a higher number of complications of any type (948

 complications than did patients receiving care from surgeons
with fewer unsolicited patient observations. The differences
remained when controlling for a variety of patient, operative,
and surgeon factors. The study cohort included 32 125 pa-
tients at 7 geographically diverse sites across the United States.

OurstudyfollowsaprevioussingleNSQIPsitestudyofsur-
gical outcomes and unsolicited patient observations, which
found that patients of surgeons with high numbers of unso-
licited patient observations had a greater risk of complica-
tions in more complex surgical cases than did patients of their
colleagues with low numbers of unsolicited patient
observations.16 Our study assessed risk for individual pa-
tients and controlled for several factors associated with the
patient, the operation, and the surgeon. A surgeon’
s unsolic-
ited patient observations were limited to those from the 24
months prior to the operation to avoid the bias that might be
introduced by including observations from patients in the co-
hort who experienced complications associated with the op-
eration included in the NSQIP data.30 Our study was ad-
equately powered to detect clinically relevant differences in
outcomes and included a geographically diverse population,
increasing the generalizability of the findings.
Patients and families are uniquely positioned to observe
physicians’behavior and performance. Although anesthe-
tized patients cannot observe what happens in the operating
arena or outside their hospital room, analysis of their collec-
tive stories offers insight into how physicians may also inter-
actwithothermedicalprofessionals.4,6,24Disrespectandrude-
ness toward other professionals affect willingness to share
information and seek help and, in turn, may affect both pro-
ceduralanddiagnosticperformance.35-38Concernsaboutasur-
geon who previously lashed out at an anesthesiologist during
an intraoperative emergency may distract the anesthesiolo-
gist from recognizing a change in the patient’
s status or in-
hibit him or her from speaking up about a change in status if
he or she fears the surgeon’
s response.39,40 If a nurse notes a
break in the sterile field or violation of safety protocols, such
as surgical time-outs (a process performed immediately be-
fore the operation in which the team stops and verbally re-
views pertinent information to ensure accurate patient iden-
tity, surgical site, and planned procedure), the nurse may be
less likely to share his or her concerns with the team if he or
she has been ignored or disrespected by the surgeon when he
or she raised similar concerns in previous situations.
Ourstudyprovidesadditionalinsightintowhyasmallsub-
set of surgeons attracts a disproportionate share of malprac-
tice claims.4,5 Study findings confirm that surgeons who gen-
erate more unsolicited patient observations also have patients
who experience more complications. Thus, not only are pa-
tients whose surgeons fail to communicate clearly or model
respect more likely to file a malpractice claim in the face of any
adverse outcome but that same surgeon may be nonran-
domly contributing to the unexpected adverse outcomes that
lead to claims.
Our findings reinforce the importance of work to identify
and address surgeons who are associated with a dispropor-
tionateshareofunsolicitedpatientobservations.Previouswork
using peer messengers to share comparative data with physi-
cians who have a high amount of unsolicited patient observa-
tions reveals that most respond by generating fewer unsolic-
ited patient observations after the intervention.20 It remains
to be seen, but surgeons who improve their interactions, com-
munication, and accessibility for patients may also favorably

 alter the work environment, contributing to enhanced team
performance and reducing the likelihood of complications.
Other future lines of inquiry might focus on the analysis of dif-
ferent types of unsolicited patient observations.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. The NSQIP uses a system-
atic sampling algorithm designed to avoid bias in case selec-
tion to select each participating site’
s cases,22,23 so it is pos-
sible that the cases included for an individual surgeon may not
reflect his or her overall experience. It is possible that some
patients in the cohort had incomplete follow-up in the 30-
day postoperative period, but data quality checks performed
by the NSQIP are designed to reduce incomplete data, and we
do not anticipate that loss to follow-up would be differen-
tially distributed among our exposure categories. We did have
complete follow-up data for all surgeons included in the study.
To account for possible changes in the complexity of cases
sampled by the NSQIP over time, we created an individual-
ized 2-year time window to sample a surgeon’
s unsolicited pa-
tient observations for each case. Environment and systems is-
sues beyond a surgeon’
s immediate control (eg, lost laboratory
results) may lead to unsolicited patient observations. How-
ever,weincludedsurgeonsfromthesameinstitutionswhopre-
sumably practice in the same environments and do not gen-
erate as many unsolicited patient observations. We also
included sites in our multivariable models to account for other
unmeasured factors by site (eg, types of cases sampled, varia-
tionincaptureofunsolicitedpatientobservations).Patientand
operative characteristics differed across the quartiles, but pa-
tients in the higher quartiles did not consistently have a higher
likelihoodofhavingcharacteristicsassociatedwithriskforsur-
gical complications. It is also possible that unmeasured fac-
tors contributed to the associations between unsolicited pa-
tient observations and complications. For example, surgeons
who are more aggressive and who might offer surgery inap-
propriately or operate on higher-risk patients might also gen-
erate more unsolicited patient observations. However, the
analysis included several variables thought to be the most im-
portant potential confounders. Another limitation arises from
thefactthatthestudywasperformedat7largeacademicmedi-
cal centers. Thus, the generalizability of the results to other
settings, including nonteaching hospitals, is potentially lim-
ited. Nonetheless, previous work assessing the association of
the risk of malpractice claims and large numbers of unsolic-
ited patient observations found strikingly similar results be-
tween academic and community hospital settings from all re-
gions of the country.4,7,41
Conclusions
A surgeon’
s pattern of generating a large number of unsolic-
ited patient observations in the 24 months prior to a patient’
s
operation was associated with an increased risk of surgical and
medical complications, even when controlling for patient, sur-
geon, and operative factors. Efforts to promote patient safety
and address the risk of malpractice claims should continue to
focus on surgeons’ability to communicate respectfully and ef-
fectively with patients and other medical professionals.
