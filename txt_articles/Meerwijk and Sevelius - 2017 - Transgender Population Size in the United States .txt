 Transgender Population Size in the United States:
a Meta-Regression of Population-Based
Probability Samples
Esther L. Meerwijk, PhD, and Jae M. Sevelius, PhD
Background. Transgender individuals have a gender identity that differs
from the sex they were assigned at birth. The population size of trans-
gender individuals in the United States is not well-known, in part because
official records, including the US Census, do not include data on gender
identity. Population surveys today more often collect transgender-
inclusive gender-identity data, and secular trends in culture and the
media have created a somewhat more favorable environment for
transgender people.
Objectives. To estimate the current population size of transgender
individuals in the United States and evaluate any trend over time.
Search methods. In June and July 2016, we searched PubMed, Cumu-
lative Index to Nursing and Allied HealthLiterature, and Web of Science for
national surveys, as well as “gray” literature, through an Internet search.
We limited the search to 2006 through 2016.
Selection criteria. We selected population-based surveys that used
probability sampling and included self-reported transgender-identity
data.
Data collection and analysis. We used random-effects meta-analysis to
pool eligible surveys and used meta-regression to address our hypothesis
that the transgender population size estimate would increase over time.
We used subsample and leave-one-out analysis to assess for bias.
Main results. Our meta-regression model, based on 12 surveys covering
2007 to 2015, explained 62.5% of model heterogeneity, with a significant
effect for each unit increase in survey year (F = 17.122; df = 1,10;
b = 0.026%; P = .002). Extrapolating these results to 2016 suggested
a current US population size of 390 adults per 100 000, or almost 1 million
adults nationally.This estimate may be more indicative for younger adults,
who represented more than 50% of the respondents in our analysis.
Authors’ conclusions. Future national surveys are likely to observe
higher numbers of transgender people.The large variety in questions used
to ask about transgender identity may account for residual heterogeneity
in our models.
Public health implications. Under- or nonrepresentation of transgender
individuals in population surveys is a barrier to understanding social de-
terminantsand healthdisparities facedbythispopulation.Werecommend
using standardized questions to identify respondents with transgender
and nonbinary gender identities, which will allow a more accurate pop-
ulation size estimate. (Am J Public Health. 2017;107:e1–e8. doi:10.2105/

PLAIN-LANGUAGE SUMMARY
We used data from national surveys to
estimate the population size of transgender
people in the United States. Estimates of
the number of transgender adults signifi-
cantly increased over the past decade, with
a current best estimate of 390 per 100 000
adults. That is about 1 in every 250 adults,
or almost 1 million Americans. These
numbers may be more typical of younger
adults than of the entire US population. We
expect that future surveys will find higher
numbers of transgender people and rec-
ommend that standardized questions be
used, which will allow a more accurate
population size estimate.

 T
ransgender individuals have a gender
identity that differs from the sex they
were assigned at birth.1 Research has shown
that transgender individuals around the world
and in the United States are exposed to
widespread social stigma, discrimination,
harassment, and physical and sexual abuse.2,3
Compared with the general population,
a national survey conducted in the United
States in 2008 found that transgender in-
dividuals were 4 times more likely to live in
extreme poverty, had double the rate of
unemployment, and had almost double the
rate of being homeless.4 In terms of health,
transgender individuals had 4 times the rate
of being HIV-infected and 28% postponed
medical care because of discrimination.
Particularly alarming is that 41% of survey
respondents reported at least 1 suicide at-
tempt. A barrier to understanding social
determinants and health disparities faced by
transgender people is the under- or non-
representation in a range of demographic
and health-monitoring activities,5 which
may result from a lack of transgender-
inclusive data collection with regard to
gender identity.
Accurate representation of the transgender
population is complicated by the diversity
within the community with regard to lan-
guage and subcultures.6,7 Moreover, the
clinical literature has long conflated trans-
gender identity with homosexuality.8,9 Al-
though a relationship between gender
identity and sexual orientation may exist, the
American Psychological Association (APA)
recognizes that “Transgender people, like
cis-gender people, may be sexually oriented
toward men, women, both sexes, or neither
sex. . . .”10,11 Current best practice for col-
lecting transgender-inclusive gender identity
data is the 2-step method, which has been
shown to optimize accurate identification of
transgender people in a population.12 This
method records current gender identity as
well as the sex assigned at birth; transgender
people are those who identify as such and
those whose current gender identity and
sex assigned at birth differ.13 This method
allows the capture of people who identify
with a binary gender (male or female), such as
a transgender man who identifies only as
male,14 as well as others who may be con-
sidered transgender from a demographic
perspective, even if they do not identify with
the term “transgender,” such as people who
identify as genderqueer, agender, or having
no gender.15,16
The US Census and other official records
keptbysuchagenciesastheNationalArchivesor
state departments of motor vehicles report sex,
typically based on the sex assigned at birth or
the legal sex, but they do not report current
gender identity. They are also not able to record
whether the legal sex differs from the sex
assigned at birth. As a result, at the most basic
level, the population size of transgender in-
dividualsintheUnitedStatesisnotwell-known.
On the basis of a limited number of sources
in 2009, the APA estimated the number of
transgender individuals in the United States
at 115 000 to 450 000, or 38 to 147 per
100 000 by using US Census data for that
year’s total population size.11 The value of
these numbers is limited, as the lower limit
was based on members of a lesbian, gay, bi-
sexual, and transgender (LGBT) Web site
who identified as transgender, which is un-
likely to be representative of the US general
population, and the upper limit was based
on an older and in part nonprobability sample
of North Americans,17 which may not reflect
current numbers in the United States.
More recent US population-based surveys
have reported transgender population sizes
that are higher, ranging from 153 to 1647 per
100 000.18 These estimates may not gener-
alize to the United States as a whole, as they
were based on data collected in Massachusetts
adults19 and 9th to 12th graders in Boston
public schools.20 Perhaps the best current
estimate is provided by Flores et al. who es-
timated that 0.6% of US adults, approxi-
mately 560 per 100 000, identify as
transgender.21 They used data from the Be-
havioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS), which is administered annually to
randomly selected adults across the United
States.
Because contemporary surveys more often
collect transgender-inclusive gender-identity
data, and secular trends in culture and the
media have created a somewhat more fa-
vorable environment for transgender people,
it is possible that the measured size of the
transgender population has increased over
time, rendering previous reports of pop-
ulation size even less applicable today. The
primary aim of this study was to estimate
the number of transgender individuals in the
United States by performing a meta-analysis
of population-based national surveys. A
secondary aim was to evaluate for any
trend over time. We hypothesized that the
estimates of transgender population size
would increase over time. Knowledge of
the transgender population size can support
the development of social policy that aims
to protect transgender individuals against
stigma and discrimination. From a health
perspective, knowledge of the size of the
transgender population can inform the de-
velopment of health care programs to benefit
transgender people, as well as inform in-
surance companies on how to best provide
coverage for such care.
METHODS
We systematically searched for national
surveys in PubMed, Cumulative Index
to Nursing and Allied Health Literature,
and Web of Science. The search was lim-
ited to 2006 to 2016, as older surveys are
unlikely to contain transgender-inclusive
gender-identity data. Eligible surveys were
population-based and nonclinical, as rec-
ommended by Deutsch,18 and collected data
on transgender identity in probability sam-
ples. The search combined the terms “na-
tional” and “survey” in titles or abstracts with
“gender identity” anywhere in the publi-
cation and was performed on July 5, 2016.
Knowing that large national surveys often
have dedicated Web pages that report
methods and data (e.g., the BRFSS, the
National Health Interview Survey [NHIS]),
we also searched the Internet for “gray”

 literature with the search terms “survey,”
“gender,” and “health” in the Internet do-
mains “.gov,” “.edu,” and “.us,” which
are the domains affiliated with the United
States. We performed this search with the
Google search engine between June 1 and
13, 2016. We included the search term
“health” to narrow these Internet search
results, assuming that surveys with
transgender-inclusive gender-identity data
would most likely be health-related.
With the Internet search results ordered by
relevance, we identified US surveys among
the first 500 hits. We revisited Web sites
for recurring surveys to check for new data
until November 9, 2016. Across both
searches, we excluded satisfaction surveys,
surveys that were not based on self-report
(e.g., parents reporting about children),
surveys that were not about humans (e.g.,
tobacco-free colleges, health plans or health
insurance, LGBT curriculum content),
surveys that were not based on national
samples (e.g., surveys covering state,
county, or cities only), and reviews and
meta-analyses of multiple surveys. We
further excluded surveys that did not
specifically report transgender identities (e.g.,
surveysthatreportedcountsfor“anothergender”
or counts for a response option that combined
“transgender” and “other”). We collected
gender-identity data for each unique survey
located through either the Internet search or
search in traditional scientific databases from
the original search result or reports on the
survey’s Web site.
We completed an investigator-developed
data extraction form for each eligible survey
with data on survey year, population, sam-
pling design, question(s) used to assess
transgender identity, and the total sample size
and number who self-reported as transgender.
The first author extracted and double-
checked all data.
We conducted random-effects meta-
analyses based on the proportion of trans-
gender individuals. Pooling of multiple
survey samples, including multiple waves for
recurring surveys, has been used before to
estimate population size in gender and
sexual minorities.22,23 Random-effects
analysis is appropriate when study hetero-
geneity can be expected.24 We present plots
and calculated the I2 statistic to estimate
residual heterogeneity. This statistic
indicates whether variation is more likely
attributable to study heterogeneity or to
chance.25 To assess potential bias we con-
ducted subsample analysis and leave-one-out
analysis to test whether single surveys had
a disproportionally large effect. We used
meta-regression to assess our hypothesis re-
garding a trend in estimated population size
over time. We used the Knapp–Hartung
method to control type-I error in meta-
regressions.26 We used R version 3.2.2
(R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) for all sta-
tistical analyses.
RESULTS
We initially identified 65 surveys. After we
excluded duplicates and surveys that did not
meet our eligibility criteria, 5 surveys
remained for analysis, spanning 2006 to 2016
(Figure 1). Accounting for data from multiple
waves of recurring surveys (4 out of 5), our
final analysis included 20 samples. Table 1
describes each of these samples in more detail.
Among them, 6 samples (30%) were drawn
from the general population and 14 (70%)
from college and university students and
adult inmates. It is worth mentioning that
only the BRFSS samples and the 2016 wave
of the National College Health Assessment
(NCHA) collected data on gender identities
not captured by the terms male, female, or
transgender (e.g., genderqueer, gender-
nonconforming), and that only the 2014
wave of the National Adult Tobacco Survey
(NATS) and the 2016 NCHA inquired after
sex assigned at birth.27–30

 Survey Questions
Questions used to collect data on trans-
gender identity varied greatly. A majority of
surveys (n = 13 or 65%) asked about being
transgender in the context of gender identity,
in accordance with current understanding
that transgender is a gender identity that is
different from a person’s sex assigned at birth.1
These surveys included the 2014 and 2015
BRFSS,27,28 the NCHA starting with the
2009 wave of data collection,30–37 and the
National Inmate Survey.38–42 The remaining
surveys (n = 7 or 35%) offered “transgender”
as a response option in the context of
sexual-orientation questions. These surveys
included the 2013 NHIS,43 the NATS,29,44,45
and the NCHA before the 2009 wave of data
collection.46–48 Although transgender as
sexual orientation does not reflect current
understanding of transgender as a gender
identity, and sexual orientation and gender
identity are distinct phenomena,8,11,14 we
conducted separate meta-analyses for
“transgender” collected as gender identity
and “transgender” as sexual orientation for
the sake of comparison.
Questions that probed gender identity
included “Do you consider yourself to be
transgender?”; “Do you identify as trans-
gender?”; “Are you male, female, or trans-
gender?”; and “What is your gender?” In
addition to male or female gender options,
response options included “transgender”31,38
and “male-to-female,” “female-to-male,”
and “gender-nonconforming.”27
Sexual-orientation questions with trans-
gender response options included “Which
of the following best describes you?”; “Which
of the following best represents how you
think of yourself?”; and “Do you consider
yourself to be. . . ?” or “Do you think of
yourself as. . . ?” Response options included
“transgender,”45 “transgendered,”46 and
“You are transgender, transsexual, or
gender variant.”29,43
Transgender Population Size
The estimated proportion of transgender
individuals based on surveys that categorized
transgender as gender identity was 0.39%
(95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.16, 0.62;
I2 = 99.8%; k = 13). In terms of overall sample
proportion, college and university students
represented the majority (58%), followed by
general-population adults (24%) and adult
inmates (18%). Leave-one-out analysis of
these surveys showed a marked effect on the
population estimate when the 2016 NCHA
was left out (0.28%; 95% CI = 0.23, 0.32;

 I2 = 96.4%). Figure 2 shows a forest plot
with the individual survey contributions.
To assess the effect of including recurring
surveys, we reanalyzed the data while in-
cluding only the latest wave and leaving out
the 2016 NCHA as a potential outlier. The
estimated proportion of transgender in-
dividuals when we used this reduced data set
spanning 2012 to 2015 was 0.35% (95%
CI = 0.24, 0.46; I2 = 96.8%; k = 3). The 2014
NATS and the 2016 NCHA respectively
reported that 0.31% and 1.3% of respondents
had indicated a sex assigned at birth that
differed from their current gender identity.
These respondents were not included in our
population-size estimates.29,30
To test the hypothesis for changes over
time, we conducted a meta-regression with
the estimated proportion of transgender in-
dividuals as a dependent variable for surveys
that categorized transgender as gender iden-
tity, but leaving out the 2016 NCHA as
a potential outlier. A meta-regression model
that included the year of the survey as pre-
dictor, centered with respect to 2007,
explained 62.5% of model heterogeneity,
with a significant effect for each unit increase
in survey year (F = 17.122; df = 1,10;
b = 0.026%; P = .002). A test for residual
heterogeneity was also significant
(QE = 99.687; df = 10; P < .001). Figure 3
visualizes the results of this meta-regression.
Not surprisingly, the annual increase was
considerably larger when we included 2016
NCHA (F = 4.944; df = 1,11; b = 0.086%;
P = .048).
The estimated proportion of transgender
individuals based on surveys that categorized
transgender as sexual orientation was 0.06%
(95% CI = 0.03, 0.09; I2 = 96.6%; k = 7). It
should be noted that presenting transgender
in the context of sexual orientation does not
reflect our current understanding of what it
means to be transgender. We include these
data for comparison only and doing so should
not be taken as validation that presenting
transgender as a sexual orientation is in any
way appropriate. Leave-one-out analysis
showed no disproportionate effect of single
surveys. A direct comparison of estimates
showed that the proportion for transgender
categorized as sexual orientation was signifi-
cantly lower than the overall proportion for
transgender categorized as gender identity
(0.06% vs 0.28%; t = 7.317; P < .001, cor-
rected for unequal variances).
DISCUSSION
Our meta-regression of US population-
based surveys indicated a substantial annual
increase in the number of transgender
adults in the United States. As a conse-
quence, meta-analyses that pool data
across several years, including our own, will
likely underestimate their numbers. A
conservative estimate extrapolating our
meta-regression results, while excluding the
latest NCHA wave of data as a potential
outlier, suggests that the proportion of
transgender adults in the United States is
0.39%, or 390 per 100 000, and almost 1
million adults nationally. It should be noted
that this estimate may be more indicative
for younger adults and that national surveys
in the near future may observe higher
numbers of transgender people. We specu-
late that the observed annual increase is
not an increase of the true population size,
but the result of people feeling freer to report
that they are or identify as transgender. This
may result from societal changes, such as
increased public visibility, awareness, and
acceptance of transgender individuals.49 The
fact that US society is more aware of
transgender issues is also reflected in public
interest in the search term “transgender,”
which, according to Google Trends, has
steadily increased since 2011. PubMed re-
sults for the number of publications found
with the search term “transgender” show
a similar phenomenon, with relatively small
increases since 2005, but large increases in
the number of publications since 2011.
Comparison of our population-size esti-
mate with international numbers is not
straightforward because, even within a single
country, differences in social acceptance affect
the number of individuals who are willing to
self-report a transgender identity.50 This is

 why we based our analysis on US national
samples only. Our estimate of 0.39% is not
quite as high as the 1% that was posited on the
basis of a qualitative review of international
studies.51 However, this high number was
supported by new data from a Dutch pop-
ulation sample aged 15 to 70 years, which
found that 1.1% of men and 0.8% of women
experienced a gender identity incongruent
with their sex assigned at birth.52 Our estimate
is also lower than the 0.6% reported by Flores
et al., who applied a rigorous statistical tech-
nique to extrapolate data from a single survey
administered in 19 states to a national level.21
According to our analysis, surveys that
considered transgender a sexual orientation
resulted in at least a 4-fold underestimate
of the number of transgender individuals.
This underestimate should not come as
a surprise, because transgender as sexual
orientation does not reflect current un-
derstanding of transgender as gender iden-
tity.11,14 It is striking, therefore, that national
surveys such as the NHIS and NATS, and
state surveys such as the Illinois and Idaho
BRFSS,53,54 until recent years, have cate-
gorized transgender as a sexual orientation
rather than a gender identity. This practice
misrepresents the number of transgender
people in the United States and sustains
misconceptions about what it means to be
transgender. Of note, as of 2015, the NHIS
no longer lists transgender as an option under
sexual orientation.
“Transgender” as a Label
The label “transgender” is often used
as an umbrella term, but does not fully
capture the larger gender-nonconforming
or gender-variant population, as surveys in
our analysis illustrated. In both waves of
the BRFSS included in our analysis, more
than 20% of respondents endorsed “gender-
nonconforming.” Other surveys that were
not eligible for our analysis showed an
even starker contrast between “transgender”
and other nonbinary options. In a recent
national nonprobability sample, the number
of respondents who endorsed “genderqueer
or gender nonconforming” was about
1.5 times the number who endorsed
“transgender.”55 In the 2013 and 2015
Minnesota College Student Health Survey,
twice as many respondents endorsed “gen-
derqueer” or “another gender” than
“transgender.”56,57
Other surveys that were not included in
our analysis because they specifically recruited
LGBT individuals also indicated a sizable
proportion of respondents who endorsed
other gender options. For example, 6th- to
12th-grade students in a national sample
endorsed “genderqueer” more often than
“transgender,” and the number who en-
dorsed “another gender” was almost half of
those who endorsed “transgender.”15 In
a national survey of LGBT individuals in
science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics, again, more endorsed “gen-
derqueer” than “transgender,” whereas the
number who endorsed “androgynous” was
slightly more than half of those who endorsed
“transgender.”16
Also, not all transgender people identify
with the term “transgender” (e.g., a trans-
gender woman who identifies as female
only).14,58 As such, surveys that include
“transgender” as the only option other than
male or female are likely to underestimate the
population size under the transgender um-
brella. The available evidence suggests that
the size of the gender-nonconforming or
gender-variant population may be twice as
large as our best estimate for the transgender
population size.
Strengths and Limitations
Several considerations should be made
when one is interpreting the results of our
study. First, transgender people differ greatly
and not all transgender individuals desire
or have the resources to seek surgeries,
hormone therapy, or change their name or
sex designation on legal documents.1 We
believe that our analysis based on self-
reported data provides a more accurate es-
timate of the number of transgender
individuals than estimates based on charac-
teristics that represent subsamples of the
transgender population only (e.g., only those
who seek surgery).
Second, only about a quarter of the in-
cluded surveys reported on the general
population. More than half of the surveys on
which our population-size estimate was based
reported on younger adults (college and
university students), and research has shown
that individuals aged 18 to 24 years are more
likely to identify as transgender.21 Also, the
incarceration rate among transgender in-
dividuals is disproportionally high,4 especially
among transgender women, and as such they
may be overrepresented in samples drawn

 from the inmate population, which repre-
sented 20% of respondents in our analyses.
Both aspects may lead to higher population
size estimates and may not generalize to US
adults as a whole.
Third, evidence from surveys that asked
about sex assigned at birth suggested that the
number of adults whose sex assigned at birth
differs from their current gender identity
could be as large as our current estimate of the
transgender population size. As such, our
analysis may not have captured all individuals
who are considered transgender from a de-
mographic perspective, but who do not
identify explicitly with the term “trans-
gender.” How these factors that may have
affected our estimate ultimately add up is
a complex question that perhaps can be an-
swered when more accurate general pop-
ulation data become available. Also, survey
errors with respect to data recording, although
they are expected to be small, may have af-
fected our estimate, especially because the base
rate of the transgender population is small.
Lastly, our analysis indicated significant
amounts of residual heterogeneity, which can
potentially be explained by differences in
respondent characteristics (e.g., general
population, students, inmates) and the types
of questions used to assess transgender iden-
tity.59 For example, the 2015 wave of the
NCHA asked about respondents’ gender with
0.45% endorsing transgender, whereas re-
spondents in the 2016 wave were asked
whether they identified as transgender (1.8%
responded yes). The small number of surveys
in our analysis did not allow for testing more
than 1 model predictor.
Conclusions
We aimed to estimate the current trans-
gender population size in the United States.
On the basis of our analysis of national
probability samples, 390 per 100 000 adults
are estimated to be transgender in 2016,
but the evidence suggests that future surveys
will likely observe higher numbers. Our
analysis also found that surveys use a variety of
questions to ask about transgender identity
and may still miscategorize transgender as
a sexual orientation. This categorization does
not reflect current understanding of trans-
gender as a gender identity, and we rec-
ommend using standardized questions to
identify respondents with transgender and
nonbinary gender identities in future pop-
ulation surveys. Best practices regarding
questions that can be used for transgender-
inclusive data collection have already
been published.13
