Abstract
Background—There has been concern that exposure to lithium early in pregnancy may be 
associated with a marked increase in the risk of Ebstein’s anomaly (a right ventricular outflow 
tract obstruction defect) in infants and overall congenital cardiac defects, but data are conflicting 
and limited.
Methods—We conducted a cohort study involving 1,325,563 pregnancies in women who were 
enrolled in Medicaid and who delivered a live-born infant between 2000 and 2010. We examined 
the risk of cardiac malformations among infants exposed to lithium during the first trimester as 
compared with unexposed infants and, in secondary analyses, with infants exposed to another 
commonly used mood stabilizer, lamotrigine. Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were 
estimated with control for psychiatric and medical conditions, medications, and other potential 
confounders.
Results—Cardiac malformations were present in 16 of the 663 infants exposed to lithium 
(2.41%), 15,251 of the 1,322,955 nonexposed infants (1.15%), and 27 of the 1945 infants exposed 
to lamotrigine (1.39%). The adjusted risk ratio for cardiac malformations among infants exposed 
to lithium as compared with unexposed infants was 1.65 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 
2.68). The risk ratio was 1.11 (95% CI, 0.46 to 2.64) for a daily dose of 600 mg or less, 1.60 (95% 
CI, 0.67 to 3.80) for 601 to 900 mg, and 3.22 (95% CI, 1.47 to 7.02) for more than 900 mg. The 
prevalence of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction defects was 0.60% among lithium-exposed 
infants versus 0.18% among unexposed infants (adjusted risk ratio, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.00 to 7.06). 
Results were similar when lamotrigine-exposed infants were used as the reference group.
Conclusions—Maternal use of lithium during the first trimester was associated with an 
increased risk of cardiac malformations, including Ebstein’s anomaly; the magnitude of this effect

 was smaller than had been previously postulated. (Funded by the National Institute of Mental 
Health.)
In the early 1970s, results from the International Register of Lithium Babies evaluating 
infants born to mothers who were treated with lithium early in pregnancy1,2 suggested a risk 
of Ebstein’s anomaly, a right ventricular outflow tract obstruction defect, that was increased 
by a factor of 400 (on the basis of two cases associated with lithium exposure) and a risk of 
overall cardiac defects that was increased by a factor of 5.3 By 1979, the final report 
included data on 225 infants born to lithium-exposed women; 18 infants had congenital 
cardiac defects (8%), including 6 with Ebstein’s anomaly (3%).4 On the basis of these data, 
regulatory agencies concluded that there was evidence of human fetal risk but that potential 
benefits may warrant use in pregnant women.5
Despite the warnings, lithium remains a first-line treatment for the 1% of women of 
reproductive age with bipolar disorder in the U.S. population.6 This persistent use has been 
justified by the existence of more evidence on effectiveness than with other drugs, including 
data showing that lithium continuation is associated with a reduced risk of mood-episode 
recurrence during pregnancy and the postpartum period.7 Furthermore, a large body of 
evidence has shown teratogenicity for some other mood stabilizers, such as valproate.8,9
Other than the findings among lithium-exposed infants in the International Register, most of 
the information on the safety of lithium during pregnancy that has accumulated in the past 
40 years is based on case reports10–14 and small studies (Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Several small case–
control studies failed to show an association between lithium and Ebstein’s anomaly,15–19 
overall cardiac defects,20 or any congenital malformations.21 In two uncontrolled cohort 
studies of lithium-exposed pregnancies, no cardiac malformations were detected in the 82 
newborns examined22,23; another uncontrolled study showed four mild cardiac defects in 79 
exposed infants.24 Four controlled cohort studies (involving between 59 and 138 lithium-
exposed pregnancies)25–28 showed conflicting results.
Therefore, women with bipolar disorder who are of childbearing age and are planning to 
become pregnant have to balance the risks and benefits of treatment continuation on the 
basis of limited and conflicting evidence regarding the safety of lithium for the developing 
fetus.6,29 Some women discontinue lithium therapy or terminate their pregnancy to avoid the 
potential teratogenicity of the drug.19,26,27 We designed a large retrospective cohort study 
involving pregnant women nested in the U.S. Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) to provide 
evidence on the risk of cardiac malformations in the offspring that is associated with 
maternal use of lithium in the first trimester.
Methods
Data Source and Study Cohort
Data were collected from the MAX for 46 U.S. states and the District of Columbia for the 
years 2000 through 2010. The cohort included all pregnancies in women 12 to 55 years of 
age that resulted in live births for which Medicaid covered the health care expenses. We

 excluded women who had private insurance or restricted medical benefits and those who did 
not have an appropriate enrollment type (i.e., capitated managed care, fee-for-service 
primary care case management, or no managed care, depending on the state). The approach 
that was used for the development of the study cohort has been described previously30,31 and 
is summarized in Figure 1 and the Supplementary Appendix.
Study Conduct
The study was approved by the institutional review board at Brigham and Women’s 
Hospital, and the need for informed consent was waived. The study funder (the National 
Institute of Mental Health) had no role in the design or conduct of the study; the collection, 
management, analysis, or interpretation of the data; or the preparation, review, or approval of 
the manuscript.
Definition of Exposure
Exposure was defined as at least one filled prescription for lithium during the first trimester 
(first 90 days after the date of the last menstrual period). The primary reference group 
included women with no lithium or lamotrigine dispensings during the 3 months before the 
start of pregnancy or during the first trimester. The criterion of no dispensing during the 3 
months before the start of pregnancy was imposed to avoid misclassifying as unexposed 
women who still had medications from an earlier filling available at the start of pregnancy. 
We also identified a secondary reference group of women who had at least one filled 
prescription for lamotrigine during the first trimester. Patients who were exposed to both 
lithium and lamotrigine during the first trimester (67 patients) were excluded. Lamotrigine 
was chosen for comparison because it is an effective treatment for bipolar disorder,32 often 
in combination with other psychotropic medications, and has not been associated with an 
increased risk of congenital malformations.9,33 Women who were exposed to lamotrigine 
were compared with the reference group of unexposed women and were used as the active 
reference group for women who were exposed to lithium. The former contrast (exposure to 
lamotrigine vs. no exposure) allows an indirect and stable comparison of lithium and 
lamotrigine by using a common reference. The latter contrast can further limit residual 
confounding by indication.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the presence of a cardiac malformation in the infant. The positive 
predictive value for this outcome definition has been previously estimated at 77.6%.34 
Secondary outcomes were major congenital malformations overall, defined as the presence 
of any major malformation, and noncardiac congenital malformations, defined as the 
presence of a major mal-formation in the absence of a cardiac defect. Detailed information 
on outcome definitions is provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
Because the use of lithium in early pregnancy has been previously associated with an 
increased risk of Ebstein’s anomaly, we assessed right ventricular outflow tract obstruction 
defects as a secondary outcome. We focused on overall right ventricular outflow tract 
obstruction defects rather than on Ebstein’s anomaly for two reasons: first, Ebstein’s 
anomaly has a specific code in the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision 
Patorno et al.

 (ICD-9), but it may be classified under the general group of right ventricular outflow tract 
obstruction malformations; second, clinicians may be more likely to label a right ventricular 
outflow tract obstruction defect as Ebstein’s anomaly in infants known to have been exposed 
to lithium than in unexposed infants, and thus Ebstein’s anomaly may be more prone to 
differential misclassification than right ventricular outflow tract obstruction defects more 
generally.
Covariates
We considered the following covariates as potential confounders: maternal age at delivery, 
race or ethnic group, year of delivery, smoking status, maternal psychiatric disorders and 
medical conditions, concomitant medication use, and general markers of the burden of 
disease, including the Obstetric Comorbidity Index35 and measures of the intensity of health 
care use. (For a complete list of covariates, see Tables S2, S3, and S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix.) Maternal coexisting conditions and medication use were measured during the 3 
months before pregnancy through the end of the first trimester. Measures of health care use 
(e.g., number of physician visits) were captured only during the 3 months before pregnancy 
to avoid their being influenced by early awareness of possible pregnancy complications.
Statistical Analysis
For the primary analysis, standardized differences were used to assess covariate balance 
between the exposed group and the reference group; meaningful imbalances were defined by 
an absolute standardized difference of more than 0.1.36 Absolute risks of primary and 
secondary outcomes, and unadjusted risk ratios and risk differences with 95% confidence 
intervals, were calculated. Exposure propensity scores were estimated as the predicted 
probability of receiving the treatment of interest (e.g., lithium vs. no treatment), conditional 
on the covariates described above, with the use of logistic-regression models. For each 
estimated propensity score, the population in the nonoverlapping areas of the propensity-
score distributions was trimmed, and 50 strata were created on the basis of the distribution of 
the treated women.37 Weights for the reference group were calculated according to the 
distribution of the treated women among propensity-score strata and were used to estimate 
adjusted baseline characteristics and adjusted risk ratios and risk differences and 95% 
confidence intervals in generalized linear models (PROC GENMOD procedure with weight 
statement, binomial distribution, and log or identity link function). Use of the robust 
variance estimator to account for correlations within women with multiple pregnancies did 
not appreciably change confidence intervals; thus, correlation structures were not included in 
the analyses.
We also performed secondary analyses as above for the outcome right ventricular outflow 
tract obstruction defects. In addition, we examined the risk of cardiac malformations 
according to thirds of the first and the highest prescribed daily dose filled during the first 
trimester to evaluate the presence of a dose–response relation for lithium.
We performed several sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the primary findings. 
First, to assess the potential effect of exposure misclassification, we redefined the exposure 
as having filled at least two prescriptions during the first trimester. Second, to evaluate the

 potential effect of outcome misclassification, we required the outcome to be based on ICD-9 
diagnoses or procedure codes in the infant records only and extended infant follow-up to 1 
year for infants who were continuously eligible for Medicaid for at least 1 year. Third, to 
mitigate possible residual bias due to confounding by indication and associated differences 
in health care use, we included only women who had at least one recorded diagnosis of 
bipolar disorder during the baseline period. Fourth, because the cohort included live births 
only, we examined the potential effect of different proportions of terminations among 
women treated with lithium versus those untreated within levels of covariates used in the 
adjustment.38
Results
Study Cohort and Patient Characteristics
The study cohort included 1,325,563 pregnancies that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 
663 (0.05%) were in women who were exposed to lithium and 1945 (0.15%) were in women 
who were exposed to lamotrigine during the first trimester (Fig. 1).
As compared with unexposed women, women who were exposed to lithium were older, 
more likely to be white, and had a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders (particularly 
bipolar disorder and depression) and pain conditions. They were more likely to use 
psychotropic and pain medications and had a higher overall burden of disease. (For more on 
baseline characteristics of lithium-exposed and unexposed women, see Table 1, and Table S2 
in the Supplementary Appendix.) After propensity-score adjustment, baseline characteristics 
were well balanced between the two groups. Characteristics of the women who were 
exposed to lamotrigine, before and after propensity-score adjustment, are reported in Tables 
S3 and S4 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Absolute and Relative Risks of Cardiac Malformations
The prevalence of cardiac malformations was 2.41 per 100 live births among infants exposed 
to lithium, 1.15 per 100 among unexposed infants, and 1.39 per 100 among infants exposed 
to lamotrigine (Table 2). The adjusted risk ratio for cardiac malformations among infants 
exposed to lithium was 1.65 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 2.68) as compared with 
nonexposed infants and 2.25 (95% CI, 1.17 to 4.34) as compared with lamotrigine-exposed 
infants. The adjusted differences were 0.95 cases per 100 births (95% CI, −0.22 to 2.12) and 
1.43 cases per 100 births (95% CI, 0.09 to 2.77), respectively (Table S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The adjusted risk ratio for cardiac malformations among infants 
exposed to lamotrigine as compared with unexposed infants was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.30) 
(Table 2). The adjusted risk ratio for noncardiac defects among infants exposed to lithium as 
compared with unexposed infants was 1.22 (95% CI, 0.81 to 1.84).
Secondary and Sensitivity Analyses
The prevalence of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction defects was 0.60 per 100 live 
births among infants exposed to lithium and 0.18 per 100 among unexposed infants (Table 
3). The adjusted risk ratio for specific cardiac malformations that were associated with 
lithium was 2.66 (95% CI, 1.00 to 7.06) for right ventricular outflow tract obstruction

 defects and 1.46 (95% CI, 0.84 to 2.57) for other cardiac defects. Although none of the 
identified right ventricular outflow tract obstruction defects in the lithium-exposed infants 
were specifically coded in claims as Ebstein’s anomaly, most were consistent with cardiac 
defects that frequently co-occur with Ebstein’s anomaly (e.g., pulmonary atresia and 
stenosis). The observed prevalence of Ebstein’s anomaly among unexposed infants was 
approximately 7 cases per 100,000 births.
In dose–response analyses based on the first lithium prescription in pregnancy, after 
propensity-score adjustment (Tables S6 through S13 in the Supplementary Appendix), the 
risk ratio was 1.11 (95% CI, 0.46 to 2.64) for a daily dose of 600 mg or less, 1.60 (95% CI, 
0.67 to 3.80) for 601 to 900 mg, and 3.22 (95% CI, 1.47 to 7.02) for more than 900 mg (Fig. 
2). Results were consistent in analyses that used thirds of the highest prescribed dose during 
the first trimester (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). All right ventricular outflow 
tract obstruction defects that were identified in lithium-exposed infants occurred with a daily 
dose of more than 600 mg. There was no evidence of a dose–response relationship for 
lamotrigine (Fig. 2, and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
The risk of cardiac malformations among infants exposed to lithium as compared with 
unexposed infants remained consistently elevated in sensitivity analyses (Table 3). After we 
accounted for potential differences in the probability of termination of malformed fetuses 
among exposed and unexposed women, the range of plausible adjusted risk ratios for cardiac 
malformations among lithium-exposed infants was estimated to be 1.67 to 1.80. (See the 
Supplementary Appendix.)
Discussion
Findings from this observational study support a modest increase in the risk of cardiac 
malformations in infants that are associated with lithium use in early pregnancy. On the basis 
of the 95% confidence interval around the effect estimates, results were consistent with an 
increased risk of cardiac malformations ranging from 2 to 270%, or up to 2 additional cases 
per 100 births among pregnancies in women who were exposed to lithium during the first 
trimester as compared with pregnancies in unexposed women with similar characteristics. 
The relative risk appeared to be higher for right ventricular outflow tract obstruction defects 
than for other cardiac defects. Lithium was not significantly associated with noncardiac 
malformations, although the 95% confidence interval around the risk estimate indicates that 
some increase in risk cannot be ruled out.
Our results support previous findings of an association between lithium use in pregnant 
women and cardiac defects in infants, although the magnitude of increased risk appeared 
considerably lower than originally suggested by the International Register of Lithium 
Babies.1 Results from this registry-based study were interpreted as supporting a risk of 
Ebstein’s anomaly that was increased by a factor of 400 among infants exposed in utero to 
lithium,3 despite substantial methodologic limitations, including the lack of a control group 
and a possible over-representation of cases owing to retrospective enrollment.4 Since then, 
anecdotal reports10–14 and small studies have been published with inconclusive results 
(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Our cohort of 663 women who were exposed to

 lithium during the first trimester is more than 4 times larger than that in the largest 
previously published controlled study.27
Our study also suggests that the association of lithium and cardiac malformations in humans 
is dose-dependent, with a risk that is increased by a factor of approximately 3 beyond doses 
of 900 mg per day. Dose-dependent teratogenicity of lithium was previously reported in 
rodent models,39,40 although it has not been well studied in humans.
Limitations of our study warrant consideration. First, although the availability of detailed 
maternal information through the MAX data set and our propensity-score adjustment 
allowed for control for a large number of confounders, we cannot rule out the possibility of 
residual confounding by characteristics that are not captured or are incompletely captured in 
our database. For example, suggested risk factors for cardiac malformations, such as obesity, 
smoking, or alcohol use disorders, appeared to be underrecorded in our data and to be more 
prevalent among women exposed to lithium (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Residual confounding by such factors would probably bias relative-risk estimates upward. 
Our finding of similar results in analyses that were intended to mitigate possible residual 
confounding (i.e., directly comparing lithium with lamotrigine and restricting analyses to 
women with at least one diagnosis of bipolar disorder) argues against substantive residual 
confounding by indication. Second, databases of health care use provide information on 
filled prescriptions but not on the actual consumption of medications and thus can be prone 
to the misclassification of drug exposure, which would attenuate observed associations. 
However, results were similar in sensitivity analyses limited to women who filled at least 
two prescriptions, under the assumption that this would increase the likelihood that the 
medication was taken as prescribed and at critical times in organogenesis. Third, databases 
of health care use may also be prone to outcome misclassification. To address this 
possibility, we used a previously validated definition for cardiac defects34 and highly 
specific definitions for overall and noncardiac malformations. Moreover, the results of 
analyses that required the outcome to be based on ICD-9 diagnoses or procedure codes in 
the infant records only were consistent with the main results.
Fourth, because of the previously postulated association with lithium, cardiac malformations 
may have been preferentially investigated among infants exposed to lithium during 
pregnancy, with the result that our study may have overestimated the true effect of lithium on 
cardiac defects. However, our outcome definition focused on major cardiac defects that are 
likely to be clinically consequential for the infant and was restricted to malformations that 
were recorded several times or had required surgery. Fifth, because the cohort was restricted 
to live births, spontaneous abortions or planned terminations due to congenital 
malformations that were diagnosed early in pregnancy were missed. It has been previously 
documented that therapeutic abortions may be 5 to 10% higher among lithium users than 
among nonusers.26,27 The quantitative bias analysis, which assessed the potential effect of 
such missed terminations, suggested that our study may have underestimated the true 
association between lithium and cardiac malformations if termination frequencies (within 
levels of the measured covariates) were highly differential; under the most extreme scenario 
considered, the estimate of the corrected adjusted risk ratio would be closer to 2. Finally, our 
study focused only on the association of lithium with congenital malformations, without

 consideration of other potential outcomes that may be relevant for treatment decisions 
during pregnancy.
Our results suggest that maternal use of lithium during the first trimester is associated with 
an increased risk of cardiac malformations on the order of 1 additional case per 100 live 
births when there was exposure early in pregnancy and that this association is dose-
dependent. The magnitude of the association was substantially smaller than originally 
proposed.

 Figure 2. Absolute and Relative Risk of Cardiac Malformations among Lithium-Exposed and 
Lamotrigine-Exposed Infants as Compared with Unexposed Infants, Stratified According to the 
Mother’s Dose of the Drug
Stratification was according to thirds of the first prescribed daily dose that was filled during 
the first trimester. A separate exposure propensity score was estimated in each dose stratum 
as the predicted probability of receiving the treatment-dose range of interest versus no 
treatment, conditional on the covariates reported in Tables S6 through S9 in the 
Supplementary Appendix. For each estimated propensity score, the population in the 
nonoverlapping areas of the propensity-score distributions was trimmed, and 50 strata were 
created on the basis of the distribution of the treated women. Weights for the reference group 
were calculated according to the distribution of the exposed women among propensity-score 
strata and were used to estimate adjusted risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals.

*Plus–minus values are means ±SD. Maternal coexisting conditions and medication use were measured during the 3 months before pregnancy 
through the end of the first trimester. Measures of health care use (e.g., number of physician visits) were captured only during the 3 months before 
pregnancy to avoid their being influenced by early awareness of possible pregnancy complications. Percentages may not sum to 100 because of 
rounding.
†Exposure propensity scores were estimated as the predicted probability of receiving lithium versus no treatment, conditional on the covariates 
reported in Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix. For each estimated propensity score, the population in the nonoverlapping areas of the 
propensity-score distributions was trimmed, and 50 strata were created on the basis of the distribution of the treated women. Weights for the 
reference group were calculated according to the distribution of the exposed women among propensity-score strata and were used to estimate 
adjusted baseline characteristics.
‡There was a meaningful between-group imbalance, as assessed by an absolute standardized difference of more than 0.1.36
§Race or ethnic group was identified from Medicaid enrollment files. Other race includes Asian, Native American, other, and unknown.
¶Pain conditions include neuropathic and nonneuropathic conditions.
║The Obstetric Comorbidity Index predicts severe maternal illness. The range is 0 to 45, with higher values associated with a higher burden of 
maternal illness.35
