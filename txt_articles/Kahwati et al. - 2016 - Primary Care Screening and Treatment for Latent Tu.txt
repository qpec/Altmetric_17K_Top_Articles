IMPORTANCE Five to ten percent of individuals with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI)
progress to active tuberculosis (TB) disease. Identifying and treating LTBI is a key component
of the strategy for reducing the burden of TB disease.
OBJECTIVE To review the evidence about targeted screening and treatment for LTBI among
adults in primary care settings to support the US Preventive Services Task Force in updating
its 1996 recommendation.
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries, searched through August 3,
2015; references from pertinent articles; and experts. Literature surveillance was conducted
through May 31, 2016.
STUDY SELECTION English-language studies of LTBI screening, LTBI treatment with
recommended pharmacotherapy, or accuracy of the tuberculin skin test (TST) or
interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs). Studies of individuals for whom LTBI screening and
treatment is part of public health surveillance or disease management were excluded.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and
full-text articles. When at least 3 similar studies were available, random-effects meta-analysis
was used to generate pooled estimates of outcomes.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Sensitivity, specificity, reliability, active TB disease,
mortality, hepatotoxicity, and other harms.
RESULTS The review included 72 studies (n = 51 711). No studies evaluated benefits and harms
of screening compared with no screening. Pooled estimates for sensitivity of the TST at both
5-mm and 10-mm induration thresholds were 0.79 (5-mm: 95% CI, 0.69-0.89 [8 studies,
n = 803]; 10 mm: 95% CI, 0.71-0.87 [11 studies; n = 988]), and those for IGRAs ranged from
0.77 to 0.90 (57 studies; n = 4378). Pooled estimates for specificity of the TST at the 10-mm
and 15-mm thresholds and for IGRAs ranged from 0.95 to 0.99 (34 studies; n = 23 853).
A randomized clinical trial (RCT) of 24 weeks of isoniazid in individuals with pulmonary
fibrotic lesions and LTBI (n = 27 830) found a reduction in absolute risk of active TB at 5 years
from 1.4% to 0.5% (relative risk [RR], 0.35 [95% CI, 0.24-0.52]) and an increase in absolute
risk for hepatoxicity from 0.1% to 0.5% (RR, 4.59 [95% CI, 2.03-10.39]) for 24 weeks of daily
isoniazid compared with placebo. An RCT (n = 6886) found that 3 months of once-weekly
rifapentine plus isoniazid was noninferior to 9 months of isoniazid alone for preventing active
TB. The risk difference for hepatoxicity comparing isoniazid with rifampin ranged from 3% to
7%, with a pooled RR of 3.29 (95% CI, 1.72-6.28 [3 RCTs; n = 1327]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE No studies evaluated the benefits and harms of screening
compared with no screening. Both the TST and IGRAs are moderately sensitive and highly
specific within countries with low TB burden. Treatment reduced the risk of active TB among
the populations included in this review. Isoniazid is associated with higher rates of
hepatotoxicity than placebo or rifampin.

P
revention of active tuberculosis (TB) by treating latent
tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is a major goal of the strategy
for eliminating TB.1,2 Estimating the prevalence of LTBI is
challenging because there is no direct test for latent infection, but
US national survey data suggest a population prevalence of 4.7%
(95% CI, 3.4%-6.3%) for the overall US population and 20.5%
(95% CI, 16.1%-25.8%) for the foreign-born US population, based
on a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) result.3 Five percent to 10%
of immunocompetent individuals with a positive TST result will
develop active TB disease in their lifetime.4 In developed countries
with a low prevalence of TB, LTBI screening is recommended by
the World Health Organization, American Thoracic Society, Infec-
tious Diseases Society of America, and the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention (CDC) only for high-risk groups and when treat-
ment is feasible.5,6 Current screening tests for LTBI include the TST
and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs). Individuals who
screen positive are generally offered preventive treatment (eTable
1 in the Supplement) after active infection has been excluded.7
In 1996, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) rec-
ommended screening with the TST for asymptomatic, high-risk in-
dividuals (A recommendation). To inform an updated recommen-
dation,wereviewedtheevidenceontestaccuracyandbenefitsand
harms of screening and treatment for LTBI in settings and popula-
tions relevant to US primary care.
Methods
Scope of the Review
Detailed methods are available in the full evidence report at
http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document
/final-evidence-review157/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening.
The analytic framework and key questions that guided the review
are shown in Figure 1.
Data Sources and Searches
PubMed/MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library were searched for
English-language articles published from database inception
through August 3, 2015. The search strategies for these databases
are listed in the eMethods in the Supplement. ClinicalTrials.gov and
the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry
Platform were also searched for unpublished literature. To supple-
ment electronic searches, the reference lists of pertinent articles
and all studies suggested by reviewers or comments received dur-
ing public commenting periods were reviewed. Since August 2015,
ongoing surveillance has been conducted through article alerts and
targeted searches of high-impact journals to identify major studies
published in the interim that may affect the conclusions or under-
standing of the evidence and therefore the related USPSTF recom-
mendation. The last surveillance was conducted on May 31, 2016,
and no new studies were identified.
Study Selection
Two investigators independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and
full-text articles using prespecified inclusion criteria for each key
question (KQ) (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Disagreements
about inclusion were resolved by discussion. Only studies rated as
of fair or good quality were included. For the overarching ques-
tion regarding direct evidence of benefits of screening (KQ1), only
randomized clinical trials (RCTs) or prospective cohort studies
that compared screening with no screening in primary care set-
tings and focused on asymptomatic adults belonging to popula-
tions at increased risk for developing active TB were eligible. Pri-
mary care was broadly defined to include public health settings or
specialized clinics providing primary care functions (eg, prison
clinics). Studies in which more than 25% of the study population
were younger than 18 years or were known to be human immuno-
deficiency virus (HIV) positive were excluded, unless results were
stratified by these characteristics. Studies on close contacts of
individuals with active TB were excluded because testing and
treatment of such populations is considered a public health sur-
veillance activity. Studies of individuals with underlying immuno-
suppression and for whom LTBI screening and treatment would
be part of disease management were also excluded, for example,
studies of individuals beginning treatment with tumor necrosis
factor–alpha inhibitors. Other populations at increased risk were
included, such as persons who had previously received the bacil-
lus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination, injection drug users, per-
sons who were homeless or residing in homeless shelters, former
prisoners, persons born in or former residents of countries with
high TB prevalence, persons who worked with such individuals,
and persons with a documented increased risk for progression
from LTBI to active TB.
Forscreeningtestaccuracyandreliability(KQ2),studiesassess-
ingtheTSTusingtheMantouxmethodand3IGRAswereincluded.8
Because there is no direct reference test for latent infection, we re-
lied on studies of individuals with bacteriologically confirmed ac-
tive TB conducted in any country or setting for sensitivity and on
studies of healthy participants at low risk for TB and TB exposure
that were conducted in countries not considered as having high TB
burden for specificity.8,9 Reliability was defined as the degree to
which a test provided stable and consistent results, including out-
comes such as test-retest reliability, interrater reliability, and inter-
laboratory reliability.
To review the benefits (KQ3) and harms (KQ5) of treatment,
RCTs of individuals with LTBI that compared a CDC-recommended
treatment (medication, dose, and duration) with placebo, delayed
treatment, no treatment, or another CDC-recommended treat-
mentwereincluded.Forharmsoftreatment(KQ5),prospectiveco-
hort studies and case-control studies were also eligible. For harms
associatedwithscreening(KQ4),systematicreviews,RCTs,andpro-
spectivecohortstudiesreportingfalse-positiveresultsleadingtoun-
necessary testing (eg, chest radiography) or treatment, labeling,
stigma, anxiety, or cellulitis were eligible.
Except for studies of screening test accuracy and reliability
(KQ2),studiesconductedincountriescategorizedasanythingother
than“veryhigh”ontheUnitedNationsHumanDevelopmentIndex10
were excluded.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
For each included study, one investigator extracted information
about design, population, tests or treatments used, and outcomes
(eg, sensitivity, specificity, active TB), and a second investigator re-
viewed for completeness and accuracy. Two independent investi-
gatorsassessedthequalityofeachstudyasgood,fair,orpoor,using

topic (eTable 3 in the Supplement).11 Individual study quality rat-
ings are provided in eTables 4-7 in the Supplement.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Findings for each question are summarized in tabular and narrative
form. To determine whether meta-analyses were appropriate, the
number of studies available and the clinical and methodological
heterogeneity of the studies following established guidance were
assessed.12 To do this, the populations, similarities and differences
in screening tests or treatments used, and similarities in outcomes
and timing of measured outcomes, were qualitatively assessed.
When at least 3 similar studies were available, quantitative synthe-
sis was conducted with random-effects models using the inverse-
variance weighted method (DerSimonian and Laird) to determine
pooled estimates.12,13 Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using
theI2statistic.Resultsforbenefitsandharmsoftreatment(KQ3and
KQ5) were considered statistically significant if the P value was less
than.05basedon2-sidedtesting.Allquantitativeanalyseswerecon-
ducted using Stata version 13.1 (StataCorp).14
Sensitivity analyses for screening test accuracy (KQ2) added in
19 studies rated as poor quality to determine whether inclusion of
such studies would have altered conclusions. For benefits (KQ3)
and harms (KQ5) of treatment, sensitivity analyses also added
6 RCTs comparing isoniazid with placebo that were either poor
quality, did not meet all of the inclusion criteria, or both, because
they used a longer duration of treatment than is currently recom-
mended (eg, they used 1 year of isoniazid15-19 or 3 months of
isoniazid20); some also used lower or higher doses than currently
recommended.16,17 For RCTs to be included in sensitivity analyses,
they either confirmed LTBI for participants to be eligible (eg, by en-
rolling only those who were TST positive), reported data for those
with confirmed LTBI (eg, for the TST-positive subset of partici-
pants), or the vast majority of participants (more than 75%) were
TST positive.

For all quantitative syntheses, sensitivity analyses were con-
ducted using maximum likelihood random-effects (KQ2) or profile
likelihood random-effects methods (KQs 3 and 5) because
DerSimonianandLairdmodelsmaynotperformwellwhenfewstud-
ies are included.21-25 Results were essentially the same as for those
usingDerSimonianandLairdrandom-effectsmodels,withsomemi-
nor variation in width of confidence intervals for some estimates,
and thus are not reported further.
Results

Key Question 2. What is the accuracy and reliability of the TST or
IGRA (KQ2a) or sequential screening strategies (KQ2b) for screen-
ingasymptomaticadultswhoareatincreasedriskfordevelopingac-
tive TB disease?
No eligible studies evaluating sequential screening strategies
were identified. Fifty studies (n = 4167) related to the sensitivity of
theTSTorIGRAtestswereidentified;detailedindividualstudychar-
acteristics are provided in eTables 8 and 9 in the Supplement. Eight
studies were conducted in high TB-burden countries,26-33 29 were
conductedincountrieswithintermediateTBburden,34-62and10were
conducted in countries with low TB burden,63-72 including 4 in the
United States. Three multinational studies were conducted in coun-
tries with a mix of low and intermediate TB burden.73-75 In 3 studies,
fewer than 25% of the participants were BCG vaccinated.28,30,72
Thirteen studies included study populations that were between
25%and75%vaccinated,27,29,34,36,38,39,43,56,58,59,65,70,71and12stud-
ies included study populations that had more than 75% of partici-
pants vaccinated.26,32,33,40-42,45,51,52,61,66,74 Twenty-two studies did
not report the BCG vaccination prevalence in the study population.
Pooled estimates were calculated for sensitivity of the TST by
indurationthresholdandofIGRAsbyassay(Table1).Thepooledsen-
sitivity for the TST with a 5-mm threshold was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.69-

so all studies were combined for a pooled estimate of 0.90 (95%
CI, 0.87-0.93; I2 = 63.6% [16 studies; n = 984]) (eFigure 2 in the
Supplement). The pooled estimate for sensitivity of the

was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.77-0.84; I2 = 74.3% [24 studies; n = 2321])
(eFigure 2 in the Supplement). The percentage of IGRA tests with
indeterminate results ranged from 3% to 7% in studies reporting
this information.
Because there was moderate to substantial statistical hetero-
geneity, results for all tests were stratified based on factors consis-
tently reported across studies that could affect the accuracy of the
test,includingwhethertestingoccurredafteranti-TBtreatmenthad
beenstarted,theTBburdenofthecountrywherestudytookplace,
and BCG vaccination prevalence among the study population. De-
tailed findings related to these analyses are in the full evidence re-
port. For some tests, estimates for sensitivity were higher in coun-
trieswithlowTBburdencomparedwithcountrieswithintermediate
orhighTBburden.Forexample,sensitivityfortheTSTatthe10-mm
induration threshold was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.76-0.99 [3 studies;
n = 424]) in low-burden countries, compared with 0.72 in interme-
diate-burden countries (95% CI, 0.65-0.79 [6 studies; n = 416]).
Eighteen studies related to the specificity of the TST or IGRA
testswereidentified(n = 10 693);detailedindividualstudycharac-
teristics are provided in eTables 10 and 11 in the Supplement. Four-
teenofthe18studiesevaluatingspecificitywereconductedincoun-

less than 5% in 9 studies,64,65,77,78,80,82-85 and not reported in 5
studies.73,79,86-88 Pooled estimates were calculated for specificity
of the TST by test threshold and of IGRAs by assay (Table 1).
The pooled specificity for the TST with a 10-mm threshold was
0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99; I2 = 94.3% [9 studies; n = 9651]); for the
15-mm threshold, 0.99 (95% CI, 0.98-0.99; I2 = 91.7% [12 studies;

QuantiFERON TB Gold IGRA; and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.94-0.99;
I2 = 93.4% [4 studies; n = 2053]) for the QuantiFERON TB Gold In-
Tube IGRA; individual study estimates are provided in eFigure 3 in
the Supplement. The percentage of IGRA tests with indeterminate
results ranged from 0% to 3% in studies reporting this informa-
tion. Because of substantial heterogeneity, results were stratified
based on country TB burden and BCG vaccination rates. Across all
tests, specificity was substantially lower in countries with interme-
diate TB burden than in those with low TB burden. Although the
populations of studies conducted in intermediate-burden coun-
tries also had high prevalence of BCG vaccination, the available evi-
dencedidnotallowdefinitiveconclusionsabouttheinfluenceofBCG

a Individual study estimates are reported for 5-mm TST induration threshold
(studies were not pooled for this outcome because 1 study estimate from
a country with intermediate tuberculosis burden was much lower than
the estimates from countries with low tuberculosis burden).
bOne study78 could not be included in the DerSimonian-Laird pooled estimate
owing to a point estimate of 1.0 for specificity (95% CI, 0.99-1.00). The
estimate using the maximum likelihood approach, which can accommodate
point estimates of 1.0, was similar (pooled specificity, 0.97 [95% CI,
0.93-0.99]).
c One study69 could not be included in the pooled estimate owing to a point
estimate of 1.0 for sensitivity (95% CI, 0.69-1.0). The estimate using the
maximum likelihood approach, which can accommodate point estimates of
1.0, was similar (pooled sensitivity, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.86-0.93]).
dPooled estimate is from maximum likelihood random-effects model, because 2
studies included point estimates of 1.0 for specificity. The I2 statistic is not
calculated when using this method.

participants had discordant results (none had indeterminate re-
sults); κ values of pairwise laboratory sample comparisons ranged

Benefits of Treatment
Key Question 3. Does treatment of LTBI with CDC-recommended
pharmacotherapy improve quality of life or reduce progression to
active TB, TB transmission, or disease-specific or overall mortality?
Study characteristics of trials evaluating the benefits of treat-
ment are reported in Table 2. Three RCTs that evaluated the ben-
efitsoftreatmentforLTBIwereincluded;1comparedisoniazidwith
placebo (n = 27 830)97; 1 compared rifampin with isoniazid
(n = 847)95; and 1 compared rifapentine plus isoniazid with isonia-
zidalone(n = 6886).96Nostudiesreportedbenefitsrelatedtoqual-
ity of life or TB transmission.
The International Union Against Tuberculosis (IUAT) trial ran-
domized 27 830 adults with fibrotic pulmonary lesions and a 6-mm
or greater Mantoux TST induration, but without active TB or previ-
ous anti-TB treatment, to 4 groups: placebo or isoniazid (300 mg
daily) for 12 weeks, 24 weeks (currently a CDC-approved regimen),
or 52 weeks.97 The median age was 50 years, and 53% were men.
After 5 years, 1.4% of the placebo group and 0.5% of the 24-week
treatment group developed active TB, for a relative risk of 0.35
(95% CI, 0.24-0.52; number needed to treat, 112). Individuals with
larger fibrotic lesions had a greater risk of developing active TB; the
incidence of active TB in the placebo group was approximately half
as great among individuals with lesions less than 2 cm2 (11.6 per
1000) as among individuals with larger lesions (21.3 per 1000).
There were no deaths attributable to TB in any of the isoniazid
groups; 3 individuals died of TB in the placebo group. One open-
label trial randomized 847 participants to 4 months of rifampin or 9
months of isoniazid to compare adverse events and treatment
completion.95 It reported zero deaths from TB in either group, zero
deaths (due to any cause) in the rifampin group, and 1 death in the
isoniazid group.
The PREVENT TB study was an open-label, noninferiority RCT
that randomized 7731 individuals to directly observed once-
weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid for 3 months or to daily self-
administeredisoniazidfor9months.96Mostparticipants(89%)were
fromtheUnitedStatesorCanadaandwerehigh-riskindividualswith
a positive TST result. Most (71%) had a close contact with a patient
with active TB within 2 years; 25% were included solely because of
conversion to skin-test positivity. Risk factors for TB included a his-
tory of incarceration (5.1%), injection-drug use (3.7%), and home-
lessness (27.8%). Data were obtained from the CDC for the subset
ofparticipantsmostdirectlyrelevantforthisreview:the6886adults
(18 years or older) who were HIV negative and TST or IGRA posi-
tive.Themedianageforthissubsetwas37years;54.2%weremen,
and 57% were white. For this subset, active TB developed in 5 in-
dividualsinthecombination-therapygroupand10individualsinthe
isoniazid-only group over 33 months of follow-up. The combina-
tion therapy was found to be noninferior to isoniazid-only treat-
ment. Overall mortality was similar for the 2 groups (30 partici-
pants vs 34 participants, respectively; P = .42).
FourRCTsidentifiedascomparingisoniazidwithplacebodidnot
meet all eligibility criteria (mainly because of duration of treatment
or dose as described in the Methods) but were used in sensitivity
analyses(eTable13intheSupplement).15-18Sensitivityanalysesusing
data from the 24- and 52-week groups from the IUAT trial and from
these 4 additional RCTs found a relative risk (RR) of 0.31 (95% CI,
0.24-0.41; 36 823 participants) and no statistical heterogeneity in
effects between studies (I2 = 0.0%) (eTable 14 and eFigure 4 in the
Supplement).

niazid with isoniazid alone (n = 6886).96
The IUAT trial (described above) reported the RRs for develop-
ing hepatitis (undefined by study authors) associated with isonia-
zid compared with placebo as 3.45 (95% CI, 1.49-7.99) for 12 weeks
of treatment, 4.59 (95% CI, 2.03-10.39) for 24 weeks (number
needed to harm [NNH], 279), and 6.21 (95% CI, 2.79-13.79) for 52
weeks. Mortality rates from hepatitis were 0.03% for the 12-week
isoniazidtreatmentgroup,0.0%forthe24-weektreatmentgroup,
and0.01%forthe52-weektreatmentgroup(zerodeathsfromhepa-

titis was 0.14 per 1000 persons receiving isoniazid (RR, 2.35 [95%
CI,0.12-45.46];NNH,6947).Sensitivityanalysesforisoniazidcom-
pared with placebo for hepatitis using data from the IUAT trial
(3treatmentgroupscombined)and3additionalRCTs15,19,20thatdid
not meet all eligibility criteria (eTables 13 and 15 in the Supplement)
found an RR of 5.04 (95% CI, 2.50-10.15 [4 studies, 35 161 partici-
pants]) and no statistical heterogeneity among studies (I2 = 0.0%;
P = .63).
In the IUAT trial, discontinuation because of adverse events
was reported for 345 patients (1.8%) receiving isoniazid com-
pared with 84 patients (1.2%) receiving placebo (RR, 1.50 [95%
CI, 1.18-1.89]; NNH, 167). The most common reason was gastroin-
testinal distress (1.2% receiving isoniazid vs 0.9% placebo; RR,
1.33 [95% CI, 1.01-1.75]).

The applicability of the evidence on accuracy and reliability of
screening tests to primary care practice settings and populations is
uncertain for several reasons. The lack of a direct test for LTBI re-
quires test accuracy studies to be performed in specific, nonprimary

c Includes 27 830 from the IUAT trial of isoniazid vs placebo, 847 from an RCT of isoniazid vs rifampin, and 6886
from trial of rifapentine + isoniazid vs isoniazid alone. In the IUAT trial, the only trial meeting all eligibility criteria
for Key Question 3 that compared isoniazid with placebo, 6965 of the participants were treated with a Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)–approved regimen (isoniazid, 300 mg ×24 weeks).
dData shown are based on the IUAT trial. The relative risks for the other IUAT treatment groups for developing
active TB compared with placebo were 0.79 (95% CI, 0.58-1.06) for 12 weeks of isoniazid and 0.25 (95% CI,
0.16-0.39) for 52 weeks of isoniazid. Our sensitivity analysis including the IUAT trial plus 4 additional RCTs with
follow-up ranging from 2 to 10 years found a similar risk (pooled RR, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.24-0.41]). Trials used in the
sensitivity analysis were consistent (I2 = 0%) and precise.

pulmonary TB, individuals residing in mental institutions, and military members exposed to persons
with active TB.
g No longer a CDC-recommended treatment regimen.
h Includes 27 830 from the IUAT trial of isoniazid vs placebo, 1327 from 3 trials of isoniazid vs rifampin, and 6886
from a trial of rifapentine + isoniazid vs isoniazid alone.
i Data shown are based on the IUAT trial; our sensitivity analysis including the IUAT trial plus 3 additional RCTs
found a similar risk (pooled RR, 5.04 [95% CI, 2.50-10.15], I2 = 0%); pooled estimate includes combined data
from all 3 isoniazid study groups (12 weeks, 24 weeks, 52 weeks) in the IUAT trial. Trials used in the sensitivity
analysis were consistent, but overall pooled estimate was imprecise.
j There were 0 deaths due to hepatotoxicity in the IUAT trial placebo group. One additional RCT used in sensitivity
analysis for this outcome reported 0 deaths from hepatotoxicity in either the isoniazid or placebo group.
k Trials in sensitivity analysis enrolled employees in a US hospital, individuals meeting American Thoracic Society
criteria referred to a US military medical center, and veterans with inactive pulmonary TB.

specificity were lower in studies conducted with populations from
countries with intermediate TB burden, specifically Turkey and
South Korea. This could be the result of unintentional inclusion of
participants with unknown past TB exposure, inclusion of BCG-
vaccinated participants, or other factors that affect the administra-
tion or interpretation of tests in these countries. The studies of

fibrotic lesions, a group thought to be at the highest risk for pro-
gression to active TB. It also found that individuals with smaller le-

lesions. Thus, estimates of treatment effectiveness may represent

harms, improve adherence, or both, rather than to assess efficacy.
Given that treatment of LTBI has been the standard of care for de-
cades, contemporary data for estimating efficacy or effectiveness
among untreated populations are not available. Furthermore, over
time the prevalence of active TB has declined, yet the prevalence
of resistant strains among those infected has increased. Thus, the
applicability of treatment evidence from before the current era is
unclear. In addition, proponents for screening suggest benefits
on outcomes related to TB transmission and through case-finding
of active TB that occurs during screening. However, no studies
meeting eligibility criteria that reported these outcomes were
identified.

Conclusions
No studies evaluated the benefits and harms of screening com-
pared with no screening. Both the TST and IGRAs are moderately
