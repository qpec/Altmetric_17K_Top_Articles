 Paid Maternity Leave and Breastfeeding
Outcomes
Kelsey R. Mirkovic, PhD, Cria G. Perrine, PhD, and Kelley S. Scanlon, PhD, RD
ABSTRACT: Background: Despite the benefits of breastfeeding, rates in the United States
are low. Shorter maternity leave is associated with lower initiation and shorter durations of
breastfeeding; however, little is known about how paid maternity leave may influence
breastfeeding rates. Methods: We used data from the 2006–2010 U.S. National Survey of
Family Growth on the most recent birth to employed women who delivered a child within the
previous 5 years. Separate multivariable logistic regression models were used to describe the
associations between paid leave duration (0, 1–5, 6–11, ≥ 12 weeks, maternity leave not
taken) and three outcomes: 1) breastfeeding initiation, 2) 6-month duration, and 3) 6-month
duration among initiators. Results: Twenty-eight percent of prenatally employed women
received no paid leave. Women who received 12 or more weeks of paid leave were more likely
to initiate breastfeeding compared to women with no paid leave (87.3% vs 66.7%, adjusted
odds ratio [aOR] 2.83 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.23–6.48]). Similarly, women with 12
or more weeks of paid leave were more likely to breastfeed at 6 months, compared to women
with no paid leave (24.9% vs 50.1%, aOR 2.26 [95% CI 1.20–4.26]). Among women who
initiated breastfeeding, having received 12 or more weeks’ paid leave increased the odds of
breastfeeding for 6 or more months; however, the association was not statistically significant
in the adjusted model (aOR 1.81 [95% CI 0.93–3.52]). Conclusions: Employed women who
received 12 or more weeks of paid maternity leave were more likely to initiate breastfeeding
and be breastfeeding their child at 6 months than those without paid leave. (BIRTH 2016)

Infants who are breastfed are at lower risk for several
infections,
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
(SIDS),
necrotizing enterocolitis, type 2 diabetes, asthma, and
childhood obesity, while mothers who breastfeed are at
lower risk for breast and ovarian cancers (1). Because
of these health benefits, the American Academy of
Pediatrics
recommends
exclusive
breastfeeding
for
about the first 6 months and continued breastfeeding
for at least 12 months, as complementary foods are
introduced (2). Despite the known health benefits of
breastfeeding, breastfeeding rates in the United States
are low. Only 19 percent of infants are exclusively
breastfeeding at 6 months, and only 27 percent are
receiving any breast milk at 12 months (3). The United
States’ suboptimal breastfeeding rates add an estimated
$2.2 billion dollars per year to direct medical costs (4).

 These added costs arise from presumed increases in
childhood illnesses and deaths where breastfeeding has
a known protective effect (including SIDS, necrotizing
enterocolitis, lower respiratory tract infections, otitis
media, atopic dermatitis, asthma, and others). Increas-
ing the proportion of infants who are ever breastfed
and the proportion breastfed at 6 and 12 months of age
are Healthy People 2020 objectives (5).
Maternal employment is frequently cited as a barrier
to
breastfeeding
in
the
United
States;
employed
mothers have lower breastfeeding initiation rates and
shorter breastfeeding durations than mothers who are
not
employed
(6–13).
Previous
studies
have
also
documented
lower
rates
of
breastfeeding
initiation
and
shorter
durations
among
mothers
who
return
to
work
early
(6,8,9,11,13–16);
however,
most
of these studies did not examine the type of leave
taken.
In 2011, the Surgeon General’s Call to Action to
Support
Breastfeeding
called
for
“work
toward
establishing paid maternity leave for all women” (17);
however, little is known about how the receipt of paid
maternity leave influences breastfeeding rates. There
are currently three U.S. states who have implemented
paid leave policies—California, New Jersey, and Rhode
Island—and a few other states have bills proposed or
pending (18–20). Understanding how the receipt of
paid
maternity
leave
may
influence
healthy
breastfeeding behaviors is important to inform public
health action. In this study, we use data from the
2006–2010 National Survey of Family Growth to
assess the relationship between the duration of paid
maternity
leave
and
breastfeeding
initiation
and
6-month duration.
Methods
Study Sample
We used data from the 2006–2010 National Survey of
Family Growth, a nationally representative survey of
men and women, aged 15–44 years, living in the Uni-
ted States. This survey was conducted by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center
for Health Statistics (NCHS) with the assistance of
numerous
individuals
and
organizations.
Interviews
were conducted in-person from June 2006 through June
2010,
using
computer-assisted
personal
interview
devices.
Female
participants
were
asked
questions
related to reproductive health, pregnancy, and child
care practices. Survey methodology is described in
detail elsewhere (21). For this analysis, we used data
from the female pregnancy file, which includes one
record for each pregnancy.
Study Variables
Mothers were asked to recall whether they breastfed
their infant after birth and, if breastfed, the age of the
child (in weeks) when breastfeeding was stopped. We
calculated
three
dichotomous
(yes/no)
outcome
variables: 1) breastfeeding initiation, 2) breastfeeding
duration of 6 or more months among all infants, and 3)
breastfeeding duration of 6 or more months among
infants whose mother initiated breastfeeding.
Mothers were asked a series of questions related to
prenatal employment and maternity leave. Mothers who
worked for pay during pregnancy within five calendar
years of the date of interview were asked the following
questions: “Maternity leave is any leave, paid or
unpaid, due to pregnancy and childbirth that a woman
takes from a job to which she expects to return, at least
when she starts the leave. Did you ever take maternity
leave, paid or unpaid, from a job you held when you
were pregnant with this baby?” Mothers who took
maternity leave were then asked, “Some women receive
pay from their jobs during their maternity leave,
through vacation pay, sick pay, maternity benefits, and
other kinds of paid leave. In total, how many weeks of
paid leave did you receive from your job while you
were on maternity leave?” We categorized paid mater-
nity leave as 0 weeks, 1–5 weeks, 6–11 weeks, and
12+ weeks.
Mothers who responded that they did not take mater-
nity leave as defined were then asked “Was this
because you did not need to take maternity leave, you
were not offered or allowed to take leave, or for some
other reason?” A total of 147 women responded that
they did not need to take maternity leave, 158 women
responded that they were not offered or allowed to take
leave, and 503 women responded that they did not take
maternity leave for other reasons. The 158 women who
were not offered or allowed to take maternity leave
were included in the group who received 0 weeks of
paid leave since they likely received no pay for any
leave. The 147 women who did not need to take mater-
nity and the 503 women who did not take maternity
leave for “other reasons” were grouped together for
analysis and categorized as “did not take leave” as we
do not have data on whether they received any pay
since they may not have returned to work.
The following covariates were included in all three
models: maternal age at the time of delivery (18–24,
25–29, 30–44), maternal education at the time of inter-
view (high school or less, some college, college
degree), race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, other),
marital status at time of interview (married/cohabiting
vs not), household poverty-income ratio at time of
interview (poverty-income ratio; < 185%, 185–349%,
≥ 350%), mode of delivery (vaginal vs cesarean), and
2
BIRTH 2016
 parity (primiparous vs multiparous). We categorized
mothers who reported an associate’s degree, technical
degree, bachelor’s degree, or graduate degree as having
a college degree. The log transformation of the total
duration of maternity leave taken in weeks was also
included as a continuous covariate; a value of 0 weeks
of total maternity leave was applied to women who did
not take maternity leave.
Analytic Sample
Our sample was limited to the 2,635 mother/infant
dyads, where the infant was born full-term (at least 37
completed weeks of gestation) and the mother worked
for pay during her pregnancy. Sixty-five pregnancies
were excluded for missing information on total mater-
nity leave duration (n = 10), paid maternity leave dura-
tion (n = 4), breastfeeding information (n = 49), or
mode of delivery (n = 2) leaving a sample of 2,570
mother/infant dyads. We further limited our analysis to
include only one child per mother and in all cases the
most recent birth was retained; 368 mother/infant dyads
were excluded leaving 2,202 mothers in our final ana-
lytic sample. Mothers included in our final analytic
sample were more likely to be multiparous than the
2,635 eligible mother/infant dyads; all other covariates
were similar.
This final sample varied slightly for the different out-
comes. To assess the impact of paid maternity leave on
6-month breastfeeding duration, we excluded mothers
of infants who were younger than 6 months (n = 189),
resulting in an analytic sample of 2,013 mothers. To
assess the impact of paid maternity leave on continued
breastfeeding for 6 months, we excluded the 629 moth-
ers of infants who were never breastfed and/or were
younger than 6 months, resulting in an analytic sample
of 1,384 mothers.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were completed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Insti-
tute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Chi-squared analysis was
used to examine the associations between maternal
characteristics and duration of paid leave. Separate
multivariable logistic regression models were used to
describe the associations of paid maternity leave dura-
tion
with
breastfeeding
initiation,
breastfeeding
at
6 months, and breastfeeding at 6 months among infants
whose mother initiated breastfeeding. We included
covariates known to be associated with breastfeeding
outcomes and that had potential associations with the
duration of paid maternity leave. Statistical significance
was set at a = 0.05.
A
priori
hypotheses
generated
three
possible
interactions with duration of paid leave including;
maternal age, poverty-income ratio, and maternal edu-
cation. For each of the outcomes, we tested for a possi-
ble two-way interaction between 1) duration of paid
maternity leave and maternal age, 2) duration of
paid leave and poverty-income ratio, and 3) duration of
paid leave and maternal education. Statistical signifi-
cance was set at a = 0.1 to assess interactions. Using a
log-likelihood test, no interactions were observed.
All
analyses
were
weighted
to
be
nationally
representative
and
accounted
for
complex
sample
design, using the SAS survey procedures accounting
for clustering, weighting, and stratification as specified
by NCHS (22).
Results
Duration of Paid Leave Among Employed Mothers
Among a national sample of prenatally employed
women, 63.3 percent took maternity leave from a job
to which they expected to return, 7.2 percent did not
take maternity leave because they were not offered or
allowed to take maternity leave, 6.7 percent of women
did not take maternity leave because they did not need
maternity leave, and 22.8 percent of women did not
take maternity leave for reasons other than not being
offered or not needing to take the leave. Overall, 28.5
percent of women received 0 weeks of paid leave, 11.6
percent received 1–5 weeks, 23.1 percent received 6–
11 weeks, and 7.7 percent received 12 or more weeks
of paid leave (Table 1). The duration of paid maternity
leave received varied significantly by maternal age,
marital/cohabiting status, poverty-income ratio, mater-
nal education, and mode of delivery. Further, 39.8 per-
cent of women with a poverty–income ratio less than
185 percent received no paid leave, compared to 15.4
percent of women with a poverty-income ratio of at
least 350 percent. Similarly, 37.6 percent of women
with a high school degree or less received no paid
leave, compared with 18.9 percent of women with a
college degree.
Paid Maternity Leave and Breastfeeding Outcomes
Overall, 66.7 percent of prenatally employed women
who received no paid maternity leave initiated breast-
feeding, compared with 87.3 percent of women who
received 12 or more weeks of paid leave (Table 2).
After adjusting for covariates, prenatally employed
women who received 12 or more weeks of paid
maternity leave had 2.83 times the odds of initiating

 breastfeeding (95% confidence interval CI: 1.23–6.48)
compared with women who received no paid maternity
leave. There was no association among women who
received shorter durations of paid leave.
Overall, 24.9% of prenatally employed women who
received no paid maternity leave breastfed their child
for ≥ 6-months, compared with 50.1% of women who
received ≥ 12 weeks of paid leave (Table 2). After
adjusting for covariates, prenatally employed women
who received ≥ 12 weeks of paid maternity leave had
2.26 times the odds of breastfeeding at 6 months (95%
confidence interval [CI] 1.20–4.26) compared with
women who received no paid maternity leave, with no
association for shorter durations of paid leave.
Among prenatally employed women who initiated
breastfeeding, 37.0 percent of those who received no
paid maternity leave breastfed their child for 6 or more
months, compared with 57.7 percent of women who
received 12 or more weeks of paid leave (Table 2).
After adjusting for covariates, no significant associa-
tions with duration of paid leave were observed,
although the association was in the expected direction
(adjusted odds ratio [aOR] for 12 or more weeks vs
0 weeks: 1.81, 95% CI 0.93–3.52).
Discussion
In this analysis, we showed that among a national sam-
ple of United States employed women who had a child
in the past 5 years, approximately 30 percent of women
received no paid maternity leave from their employer.
Our definition of paid maternity leave included any
paid vacation time or sick leave that a mother took and

 was
therefore
not
restricted
to
employer-provided
maternity leave benefits. Mothers who received 12 or
more weeks of paid maternity leave had almost three
times the odds of initiating breastfeeding and more than
two times the odds of breastfeeding 6 or more months
compared to mothers who had no paid maternity leave.
These findings were independent of the total duration
of leave a mother took.
Out of 167 countries reviewed by the International
Labor Association (an arm of the United Nations), the
United States is one of only three countries that does
not have national paid maternity leave mandates and is
the only developed nation in this category (23,24).
However, some mothers in the United States do receive
some
pay
during
their
maternity
leave
through
employer-sponsored programs or through the use of
other types of personal leave such as sick leave or
vacation leave or through donated leave from other
employees. To date, little is known about mothers in
the United States who are more likely to receive pay
during their maternity leave. Our results showed that
among
our
study
population
of
prenatally
employed women, more than about half of those who
were 18–24 years of age, unmarried/not cohabiting, or
had household incomes less than 185 percent of the
federal poverty level did not receive paid maternity
leave. In the previous work, we have shown that the
availability of leave influences a mother’s infant feed-
ing decisions before giving birth (25), therefore lack of
paid maternity leave may be a contributing factor to
low breastfeeding initiation rates in these subpopula-
tions.
Approximately 30 percent of our study population
did not take maternity leave defined as “leave taken
due to pregnancy and childbirth that a woman takes
from a job to which she expects to return, at least when
she starts the leave.” Most of these women did not take
maternity leave for reasons other than not needing
maternity leave or not being allowed/offered to take
maternity leave by their employer. While we do not
know why these women did not take maternity leave,
we hypothesize that mothers who did not return to
work may have reported that they did not take leave.
In support of this, a national survey of United States
mothers revealed that approximate 30 percent of new
mothers had remained out of the workforce when

 surveyed at nine postnatal months (26). Interestingly,
mothers who did not take maternity leave tended to be
younger, unmarried/not cohabitating, and have a pov-
erty-income ratio < 185 percent. As younger women
and those with lower paying jobs tend to have less job
security, they may be less likely to take maternity leave
for fear of dismissal. Recent evidence suggests that
less-educated women are more likely to stay at home
than their college-educated counterparts (27). Younger,
less-educated mothers often citied economic reasons
related to low waged jobs and high costs of child care
as the rationale behind their absence from the work-
force (27).
Very little has been published investigating the
relationship between paid maternity leave and breast-
feeding behavior. In adjusted analyses, Ogbuaum et al
found no association between having ≥ 7 weeks of
paid maternity leave (the longest duration of paid leave
examined) compared to no leave with respect to initia-
tion of breastfeeding or continued breastfeeding for
≥ 6 months among women who initiated breastfeeding
(10). In our study, we found that women who received
6–11 weeks of paid maternity leave did not exhibit a
higher odds of breastfeeding initiation compared to
women who received no paid leave, but that when 12
or more weeks of paid leave were received, increased
breastfeeding initiation was observed. We found no sta-
tistically significant increase in continued breastfeeding
for ≥ 6 months among women with paid leave who ini-
tiated breastfeeding. Given that 57 percent of women
with children under 1 year of age participate in the
workforce (28), making it easier for employed mothers
to breastfeed could improve breastfeeding rates and
result in improved infant and maternal health.
Our study had several limitations and strengths. One
limitation was that no data were available regarding the
number of hours worked before or after giving birth
and we were therefore unable to adjust for part-time/
full-time work status. Because part-time women have
been shown to have higher breastfeeding initiation rates
and longer durations of breastfeeding (6,7,9,11,13), and
part-time workers often have reduced benefits, such as
paid leave availability, compared with full-time work-
ers, this may have reduced the magnitude of an associ-
ation between paid maternity leave and breastfeeding
duration in our study. Secondly, because questions on
breastfeeding and maternity leave duration may have
depended on a recall period of up to five calendar
years, recall bias may exist. However, recall of breast-
feeding initiation and duration has been shown to be
accurate even with long recall periods (29,30); similar
studies about the validity of recall report of maternity
leave are not available. Third, while women who took
maternity leave included only women who planned to
return to work at the start of their maternity leave,
whether they actually returned is unknown. Fourth, we
did not know the specific reason that many study par-
ticipants did not take maternity leave. Strengths of this
study include its in-person interviews that included
multiple questions for consistency of information and
its national representativeness of working women.
The International Labor Organization, an arm of the
United Nations recommends at least 18 weeks of paid
maternity leave (23). Although the 2011 Surgeon
General’s Call to Action to Support Breastfeeding does
not specify duration, it also calls for “work toward estab-
lishing paid maternity leave for all employed mothers”
(17). The three U.S. states that have implemented paid
maternity
leave
programs
provide
between
4
and
6 weeks of paid maternity leave (18–20); however, our
work suggests that to increase breastfeeding initiation
and 6-month duration, a minimum of 12 weeks paid
maternity leave may be necessary for some women.
Conclusions
In this study, we found that employed women who take
maternity leave and who receive at least 12 weeks of
paid maternity leave are significantly more likely to ini-
tiate breastfeeding and be breastfeeding at 6 months
postpartum compared to women who receive no paid
maternity leave. Having at least 12 weeks of paid
maternity leave may help more women initiate breast-
feeding and result in more infants being breastfed at
6 months of age.
