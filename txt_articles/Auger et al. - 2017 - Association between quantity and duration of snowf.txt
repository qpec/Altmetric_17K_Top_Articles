M
yocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of morbidity 
and death.1,2 Ischemic heart disease accounted for an 
estimated 6 million years lived with disability and 
8 million deaths worldwide in 2013 alone.3,4 However, MI preven-
tion is challenging, in part because known risk factors explain 
only a fraction of cases. Determinants such as advanced age, 
smoking and diabetes are well established,2,5 but environmental 
risk factors, including the contribution of weather, are not well 
characterized. Many countries with a high incidence of MI have 
climates where extreme weather is common.4 Much attention 
has been given to temperature, since exposure to excessive heat 
increases the risk of hospital admission and death due to MI.6 
New data suggest that cold temperatures may be associated 
with an even greater risk of death,7 in addition to documented 
peaks in MI incidence during winter months.6,8–11 Associations 
with other weather conditions, including snowstorms, however, 
have received less attention.
Snowstorms could affect the risk of MI, given the evidence 
that snow-related exertion, including shovelling, can excessively 
strain the cardiovascular system in susceptible individuals.12–14 
Snowfall is flagged as a possible MI risk factor in northern coun-
tries,9,10,15,16 but evidence based on aggregate patient data is con-
flicting.9,10,12,15–20 Because the analysis of aggregate data can 
result in a loss of statistical power21 and carries a risk of ecologic 
bias,22 conclusive evidence of an association between snowfall 
and MI has yet to be established. Extreme weather patterns, 
including blizzards, are predicted to increase with climate 
change;23 thus, an increased risk of MI in connection with snow-
fall has clear public health implications.
We undertook an analysis of the likelihood of hospital 
admission or death due to MI following snowstorms using 
environmental and administrative health data for individuals 
in the province of Quebec, Canada, over a period of more than 
2 decades.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Although aggregate data 
suggest a link between snowfall and myo-
cardial infarction (MI), individual risk has 
yet to be assessed. We evaluated the asso-
ciation between quantity and duration of 
snowfall and the risk of MI using nonag-
gregated administrative health data.
METHODS: We used a case–crossover 
study design to investigate the associa-
tion between snowfall and hospital 
admission or death due to MI in the prov-
ince of Quebec, Canada, between Novem-
ber and April during 1981–2014. The main 
exposure measures were quantity (in cen-
timetres) and duration (in hours) of snow-
fall by calendar day. We computed odds 
ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) for the association between daily 
snowfall and MI, adjusted for minimum 
daily temperatures.
RESULTS: In all, 128 073 individual hospi-
tal admissions and 68 155 deaths due to 
MI were included in the analyses. The 
likelihood of MI was increased the day 
after a snowfall among men but not 
among women. Compared with 0 cm, 
20 cm of snowfall was associated with 
an OR of 1.16 for hospital admission 
(95% CI 1.11–1.21) and 1.34 for death 
(95% CI 1.26–1.42) due to MI the follow-
ing day among men. Corresponding ORs 
among women were 1.01 (95% CI 0.95–
1.07) and 1.04 (95% CI 0.96–1.13). Similar 
but smaller associations were observed 
for snowfall duration (0 h v. 24 h) and MI.
INTERPRETATION: Both the quantity and 
duration of snowfall were associated 
with subsequent risk of hospital admis-
sion or death due to MI, driven primarily 
by an effect in men. These data have 
implications for public health initiatives 
in regions with snowstorms.

Methods
Study design
We designed a time-stratified case–crossover study to test 
whether snowfall was associated with MI in Quebec, a northern 
region between the 45th and 62nd latitudes characterized by 
cold winters with subzero temperatures. Case–crossover designs 
are ideal when the event (MI) is acute and occurs shortly after the 
exposure (snowfall).24 The case–crossover design is a variant of 
the case–control study, with the principle difference that cases 
serve as their own controls.25 Instead of matching cases to other 
individuals, the case is defined as the calendar day that the MI 
occurred, and the case day is matched to nearby control days 
when MI did not occur. The weather for case days is subse-
quently compared with the weather for control days. Because 
each MI patient is their own control, characteristics such as 
smoking, socioeconomic status, comorbidity and season are 
identical between cases and controls. Thus, the case–crossover 
design automatically adjusts for both known and unknown con-
founders.25 As such, weather is the primary characteristic that dif-
fers between cases and controls.
Data sources
We analyzed hospital admissions and deaths due to MI in Que-
bec from 1981 to 2014 using 2 different health administrative 
databases. We restricted data to the months of November 
through April, because snowfalls are rare during the other 
months. We obtained individual hospital admission records for 
MI from MED-ÉCHO (the provincial hospital discharge database) 
from 1989 (when collection of data in MED-ÉCHO began) to 2014 
regardless of residency. Data on deaths due to MI were obtained 
from death registration certificates for Quebec residents be-
tween 1981 and 2013.
Detailed data on weather conditions, including daily snow-
falls and temperatures, were obtained from Environment Canada 
for 18 meteorologic stations representative of each health region 
of the province.26 Regional weather data were matched directly 
to the region of residence.
Patient population
For cases, we identified individuals with MI using diagnostic 
codes of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 code 
410 and ICD-10 codes I21–I22). We included patients for whom MI 
was a reason for the hospital admission or the primary cause of 
death. For deaths, the case day was defined by the date of death. 
For hospital admissions, the case day was the date of presenta-
tion to the emergency department. For the 17% of patients who 
were admitted directly without initially presenting to an emer-
gency department, the first day of the hospital admission was 
used as the case day. 
We identified the sex and age (< 55, 55–64, 65–74, ≥ 75 yr) for 
all MIs. We used ICD codes to determine if cardiovascular comor-
bidity (heart, cerebrovascular, arterial, other cardiovascular dis-
ease) or risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, dyslipid-
emia, tobacco/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) were 
present (Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.161064/-/DC1). Data on cardiovascular comor-
bidities and risk factors were obtained from other causes of hos-
pital admission in MED-ÉCHO, or from secondary causes of death 
in the death registration certificates. For deaths, data on second-
ary causes became available in 2000. We determined the level of 
material deprivation using an index of neighbourhood income,

education and employment from census data linked with the 
postal code.27 We determined the tertile of material deprivation 
but could do so only beginning in 1989, when this indicator 
became available.
We selected controls using a time-stratified approach,24 such 
that control days were the same day of the week in the same 
calendar month as case days. For example, for a case day on a 
Friday in the first week of January, the control days were all re-
maining Fridays in January of the same year. Each case there-
fore had up to 4 controls. The time-stratified method for select-
ing controls minimizes bias due to seasonality, temporal trends 
in weather or medical care, and effects of the day of week.24,28 
Also, bias due to unidirectional sampling is avoided by selecting 
controls before and after the date of the case.24
Exposure
Quantity of snowfall was defined as the total number of centime-
ters of snow during a calendar day, available as daily counts. Dura-
tion was defined as the total number of hours of snowfall during 
the day, computed from hourly data. To ensure that snowfall was 
measured before the occurrence of MI, we defined the primary 
exposure as the quantity or duration of snowfall during the calen-
dar day before hospital admission or death. 
As secondary exposures, we evaluated the quantity and dura-
tion of snow on the same calendar day as the MI, as well as snow-
fall 2 and 3 days before the MI. Both quantity and duration of 
snowfall were measured as continuous variables, expressed 
using splines with knots at the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles. To 
evaluate cumulative effects, we further analyzed 0, 1 and 2–3 
consecutive days of snowfall of 5 cm or more (or 6 h or longer). 
This lag covers potentially delayed effects of snowfall, or delayed 
presentation for care. 
The coldest daily temperature expressed as splines was used 
as a covariate in all analyses, with knots at the same percentiles.
Statistical analysis
The primary analysis was conducted for all individuals, and sec-
ondarily stratified according to sex, age and presence of cardio-
vascular comorbidity or risk factors. We considered that men 
might be at different risk for MI than women, both a priori and 
because of a potentially greater propensity for shovelling. We 
also sought to determine whether characteristics such as age 
and cardiovascular comorbidity modified the risks associated 
with snowfall. We used conditional logistic regression to esti-
mate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 
the association between quantity (or duration) of snowfall and 
hospital admission (or death) due to MI the following day. Simi-
larly, we estimated associations with MI events on the same day 
and 2 days following a snowfall, as well as the number of con-
secutive days of snowfall. We adjusted all models for the coldest 
daily temperature.
To ensure that associations were not masked by periods with 
relatively little snowfall, we carried out sensitivity analyses for 
the months of December through February. We verified the asso-

In all, 128 073 individual hospital admissions and 68 155 deaths 
due to MI were analyzed for the association with the region-
specific quantity and duration of snowfall. About 60% of the hospi-
tal admissions and deaths involved men (Table 1). One-third of MIs 
occurred the day following a snowfall, and about 10% occurred 
after snowfalls of 5 cm or more.

men (Figure 1). The association between snowfall and MI was stron-
ger among men, and weaker or absent among women. Compared 
with 0 cm, 20 cm of snowfall was associated with an OR of 1.16 for 
hospital admission due to MI the following day among men (95% CI 
1.11–1.21) but no increased risk among women (OR 1.01, 95% CI 
0.95–1.07). Similar associations were present for death due to MI the 
following day when stratified by sex (men: OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.26–
1.42; women: OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.96–1.13). The p values for statistical 
tests of interaction between sex and quantity of snowfall were 
< 0.001 for both hospital admission and death due to MI.
Duration of snowfall was also associated with an increased 
likelihood of hospital admission or death due to MI among men. 
Compared with 0 hours, 24 hours of snowfall was associated with 
an OR of 1.08 for hospital admission (95% CI 1.03–1.13) and 1.12 
for death (95% CI 1.05–1.20) the following day among men. No 
association with 24 hours of snowfall was observed among 
women (hospital admission: OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95–1.07; death: 
0.95, 95% CI 0.90–1.06). The p values for interaction of sex and 
duration of snowfall were 0.02 for hospital admission and < 0.001

day of MI (Appendix 2, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.161064/-/DC1). There was no association 
between snowfall and MI 2 or 3 days later.
In analyses stratified by age, there was no compelling evi-
dence that associations were more important in any particular 
age group (Figure 2). Associations with snowfall were present 
regardless of the presence of cardiovascular comorbidity or risk 
factors, although individuals without comorbidity or risk factors 
had a higher risk of hospital admission with longer durations of 
snowfall (Figure 3).
The likelihood of MI among men increased with the consec-
utive number of days of snow (Table 2). Compared with 0 days, 
2–3 consecutive days of 5 cm or more of snowfall was associ-
ated with an OR of 1.09 for hospital admission due to MI 
among men (95% CI 1.04–1.14), whereas 1 day of 5 cm or more 
was associated with an OR of 1.06 (95% CI 1.03–1.08). Similarly, 
2–3 consecutive days of 5 cm or more was associated with an 
OR of 1.20 for death due to MI among men (95% CI 1.12–1.28), 
whereas 1 day of snowfall was associated with an OR of 1.14 
(95% CI 1.10–1.18). A dose–response trend among men was 
also present for 2–3 consecutive days of snowfall lasting 6 
hours or more. Among women, 2–3 consecutive days of 5 cm or 
more of snowfall was not associated with hospital admission 
(OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.92–1.04) or death (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.99–
1.17) due to MI.
In the sensitivity analyses, data restricted to the months of 
December through February yielded similar results (Appendix 3). 
The association between snowfall and MI was present in all 
deprivation tertiles (Appendix 4). Temperature was not associ-
ated with hospital admission or death due to MI in models 
adjusted for snowfall (Appendix 5). (Appendices available at 
www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.161064/-/DC1.)
Interpretation
In our analysis of nearly 200 000 MI events in the province of Que-
bec, quantity and duration of snowfall were associated with an in-
creased likelihood of hospital admission or death due to MI. The 
association was observed among men but not among women and 
was strongest the day following a snowfall. Two or 3 days of con-
secutive snowfall increased the risk of MI further. Risks were ele-
vated regardless of age, cardiovascular comorbidity or cardiovas-
cular risk factors. These results call for caution after snowfalls, 
particularly for men who may be at higher risk, and may have in-
creasing relevance over time, considering climate change and pre-
dictions that extreme weather will increase.23
Several ecologic studies have highlighted the possibility that 
snowfall is associated with MI risk. Daily counts of death due to MI 
were associated with snowfalls in Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and 
Minneapolis–St. Paul, all located in the northern regions of the

United States.9,16 A correlation between snowfall and incidence of 
MI was also reported in Switzerland,15 which has a climate some-
what comparable to Quebec’s. In contrast, the frequency of hospi-
tal admission due to MI was not associated with snowfall in a 
Swedish sample of 382 patients.19 Other ecologic analyses simi-
larly failed to find an increased incidence of MI the day of a snow-
fall, but they may well have been underpowered.17,18,20
In our study, the increased risk of hospital admission or death 
due to MI was primarily among men. We suspect that shovelling 
was the main mechanism linking snowfall with MI. Men are poten-
tially more likely than women to shovel, particularly after heavy 
snowfalls. Snow shovelling is a demanding cardiovascular exercise 
requiring more than 75% of the maximum heart rate,12,14 particu-
larly with heavy loads.14 It is a unique activity with both static and 
dynamic components, involving the Valsalva manoeuvre and 
increased systolic blood pressure.12,13 Intense arm effort, repetitive 
motion, static upright posture, peripheral vasoconstriction14 and 
greater myocardial afterload all increase the risk of coronary 
plaque rupture and thrombus formation.12,14 Risks may be exacer-
bated by exposure to cold temperatures,13,14 which increases vaso-
constriction and blood pressure, and consequently the preload, 
cardiac output and oxygen demand of the heart.30 Sudden expo-
sure to cold temperatures has been shown to lead to sympathova-
gal activation and arrhythmia,31 and breathing cold air has been 
shown to reduce coronary blood flow.32
Limitations
Although our study represents a large analysis of MI in a region 
where snowfall is common, a number of limitations deserve 
 
attention. Use of administrative data to identify MI events may 
have resulted in misclassification for a proportion of cases. Diag-
nostic criteria for MI, as well as the sensitivity of biochemical 
 
assays for MI detection, changed during the study period. How-
ever, misclassification and evolving diagnostic criteria are un-
likely to vary with degree of snowfall, or the short 1-month span 
within which controls were identified. 
We measured snowfall and temperature levels on the basis of 
regional estimates from weather stations, which may have led to 
imprecision in the exposure assignment in some cases. We do 
not have information on sex-specific shovelling habits, the size of 
areas shovelled or whether snow removal was automated (snow 
blowers v. manual shovelling). Although these are potentially 
important considerations, the hypothesis that shovelling is asso-
ciated with an increased risk of MI events among men remains 
plausible. Some researchers have even reported that cardiac 
demands are elevated with automated snow removal.12 
Finally, the generalizability of the findings to areas with differ-
ent levels of snowfall remains to be investigated.
Conclusion
Both the quantity and duration of snowfall were associated 
with subsequent risk of hospital admission or death due to MI 
in the province of Quebec, particularly among men. These find-
ings are most likely related to the increased cardiac demands of 
snow shovelling. Climate change and the predicted increase in 
the frequency and intensity of winter storms raise the possibil-
ity of a greater incidence of MI in the future. Clinicians and pub-
lic health practitioners should consider awareness campaigns 
before the winter season to inform individuals of the risk of MI 
after a snowfall, and possibly advise against shovelling for the 
most at risk patients.
