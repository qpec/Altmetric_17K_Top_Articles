Objective: To compare the results of stent graft placement to balloon angioplasty for the treatment of stenosis at the
venous anastomosis of failing and thrombosed prosthetic hemodialysis grafts.
Methods: This prospective, multicenter trial included 293 patients randomized (1:1) to the stent graft (n [ 145) or
balloon angioplasty (n [ 148) group for treatment of stenosis at the venous anastomosis of dysfunctional (n [ 164) or
thrombosed (n [ 129) hemodialysis grafts. The primary study end point was target lesion primary patency at 6 months;
participants were followed for up to 24 months. Primary patency of the access circuit was a secondary end point.
Statistical analysis of effectiveness was performed using both the intent-to-treat population and the effectiveness-per-
protocol (EPP) populations for primary patency end points. Statistical analysis of additional effectiveness end points
was performed using the EPP population.
Results: The 6-month target lesion primary patency was statistically greater in the stent graft group than the balloon
angioplasty group (intent-to-treat, 51.6% vs 34.2% [P [ .006]; EPP, 52.9% vs 35.5% [P [ .008]). Compared with the
angioplasty group, the stent graft group increased the median time from the index procedure to the next intervention on
the target lesion by 95 days (203 vs 108 days). Patients with dysfunctional (stenotic) grafts had higher target lesion
primary patency compared with patients with thrombosed grafts regardless of treatment (EPP, stent graft, 64.6% vs
36.1% and balloon angioplasty, 45.8% vs 23.5%). When compared with angioplasty, using a stent graft for treatment of a
venous anastomotic stenosis of a thrombosed graft increased the 6-month target lesion primary patency by 53.6% (EPP,
36.1% vs 23.5%).
Conclusions: When compared with balloon angioplasty, a stent graft provided superior target lesion primary patency at
6 months for treatment of venous anastomotic stenoses of dysfunctional and thrombosed prosthetic hemodialysis
grafts. (J Vasc Surg 2016;64:1400-10.)
Balloon angioplasty is the standard percutaneous treat-
ment for neointimal hyperplastic stenoses involving native
arteries, native veins, and vascular anastomoses.1 The ease
and speed of an angioplasty procedure, for both patient
and physician, contributes to the continuing popularity of
the procedure. However, balloon angioplasty does not
remove the neointimal tissue that causes the obstructive
stenosis. Its mechanism of action is forceful intraluminal
expansion creating deep fractures into the neointimal tissue
thereby
enlarging
luminal
cross-sectional
area
and
improving blood flow.2 Neointimal hyperplastic stenoses
are dense, fibrotic lesions that are often resistant to dilata-
tion
requiring
balloon
inflation
pressure
of
15
to
20 atmospheres.3
The reported effectiveness of balloon angioplasty for
treatment of a venous anastomotic stenoses in prosthetic
hemodialysis grafts has changed over time. Older studies
(1990s) have reported 6-month primary patency rates of
40% to 50%,4,5 whereas more recent studies (2005-2010)
have reported less successful results with 6-month primary
patency rates of 20% to 36%.6,7 Interestingly, this decrease
in effectiveness of angioplasty occurred during a period
when
ultrahigh-pressure
angioplasty
balloons
became
widely available.8
Stent grafts are commonly used for treatment of
obstructive stenoses involving native arteries, native veins,
and vascular anastomoses.9 After balloon angioplasty, a
stent graft can be used to cover the damaged neointimal
tissue, preventing recurrence of the stenosis.10 Insertion
of a stent graft is as easy and fast as an angioplasty proce-
dure for both patient and physician. Recent studies using

 stent grafts for treatment of venous anastomotic stenosis
have reported results that are superior to balloon angio-
plasty with 6-month primary patency rates of 38% to
100%.6,10,11
This prospective clinical trial was performed to compare
two different methods for percutaneous treatment of
neointimal hyperplastic stenoses; balloon angioplasty vs
the Viabahn stent graft (W. L. Gore, Flagstaff, Ariz). The
target lesion was the venous anastomosis of a prosthetic
hemodialysis graft. The intent of this clinical trial was to
compare the two treatment methods under realistic condi-
tions. Study enrollment criteria were broad to include
typical hemodialysis patients with either a dysfunctional or
thrombosed prosthetic graft. After the study procedure
and during the 24-month follow-up period, the hemodialy-
sis graft was managed by the patient’s local physician and the
protocols at each patient’s hemodialysis treatment center.
METHODS
Study design. This investigation was designed as a pro-
spective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial to compare
the safety and efficacy of balloon angioplasty vs stent graft
for treatment of a venous anastomotic stenosis of an upper
extremity prosthetic hemodialysis graft. The study was
approved by each center’s institutional review board and
by the Food and Drug Administration (Supplementary
Table I, online only). The trial, sponsored by W. L. Gore
& Associates, is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov at: http://
clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00737672.
Study end points. The study protocol was written in
2007 and the definitions of end points are consistent
with the reporting standards of the Society for Vascular
Surgery and the Society of Interventional Radiology at
that time12,13 (Supplementary Table II, online only). The
primary safety end point was major device-, procedure-,
and treatment site-related adverse events within 30 days.
All estimates of patency were assessed using a Kaplan-Meier
time-to-event model. Additional end points included
patency
outcomes
stratified
according
to
prior
in-
terventions at the target lesions, patency of the graft, and
stent graft positioned across the antecubital fossa.
Stent graft. The investigational stent graft was a
GORE VIABAHN Endoprosthesis with Heparin Bioactive
Surface, a flexible, self-expanding endoluminal endopros-
thesis. It consists of two components: (i) a tubular section
of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene modified with a hep-
arin bioactive surface, and (ii) an external nitinol structure
extending along the entire length of the device. The device
was available in diameters of 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 mm
and lengths of 2.5, 5, 10, and 15 cm.
Study population. Adult patients undergoing chronic
hemodialysis treatment using an upper extremity prosthetic
hemodialysis graft presenting with clinical or hemodynamic
evidence of graft thrombosis or dysfunction were eligible for
study participation. A failing hemodialysis graft was defined
by the clinical and hemodynamic criteria described in
Guideline 6 of the National Kidney Foundation’s 2006
Clinical Practice Guidelines for Vascular Access.14 Patients
meeting all clinical eligibility requirements (Table I) signed
informed consent before the procedure. Angiographic
evaluation of the entire access circuit was performed at the
time of the procedure to assess characteristics of the target
lesion and its relationship to the hemodialysis graft, and any
secondary lesion. Only patients who met all of the clinical
and angiographic inclusion and none of the exclusion
criteria were enrolled (Tables I and II).
Pre-enrollment angioplasty procedure and study
randomization. The first step was angioplasty of a quali-
fying secondary stenosis, if present, before any treatment
of the target lesion. A successful angioplasty (<30% resid-
ual stenosis) of a secondary stenosis was required for
patient enrollment. Patients with a thrombosed graft
underwent percutaneous thrombectomy or thrombolysis
so that accurate measurements of the target lesion could
be obtained before angioplasty. Full inflation of the angio-
plasty balloon at the target lesion was the final criterion for
patient enrollment before randomization. Anatomic suc-
cess after initial balloon angioplasty of the target lesion
was not a requirement for enrollment. Patient randomiza-
tion was based on an equal assignment ratio (1:1) to treat-
ment using balloon angioplasty or treatment using a
Viabahn stent graft. A block randomization scheme was
used, with six patients per block, to ensure that each clinical
site enrolled approximately the same number of patients in
each study group.
Study treatment and postprocedure assessments.
All study patients underwent initial angioplasty of the
target lesion, the venous anastomosis, as a requirement
for study enrollment. Patients randomized to the balloon
angioplasty group could undergo, at the discretion of the
investigator, additional balloon angioplasty to achieve an
optimal result at the target lesion. Angioplasty balloon
size(s), number of inflations, and percent residual stenosis
at the target lesion were documented. Patients randomized
to undergo placement of a Viabahn stent graft were treated
in accordance with the Instructions for Use document.15
Selection of Viabahn stent graft diameter was based on
the maximal diameter of the hemodialysis graft adjacent to
the target lesion.
At completion of the procedure, all study subjects were
assessed for the presence of a palpable, continuous thrill as
a measure of procedure success. Clinical success was
defined as the patient’s ability to undergo at least one
hemodialysis treatment at the prescribed blood flow rate
for the prescribed treatment duration. Procedural compli-
cations and adverse events were classified according to
criteria established by the Society of Interventional Radi-
ology Standards of Practice Committee and all events
were adjudicated by the study’s data safety monitoring
board.16
Patient follow-up. Management of each patient’s
hemodialysis
graft
was
determined
by
the
patient’s
nephrologist and local protocols at the hemodialysis treat-
ment center. Each patient’s hemodialysis records were
reviewed and all hemodialysis graft-related events were
documented. Follow-up information for each patient was

 collected at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the
randomized treatment procedure.
Repeat interventions to the vascular access circuit.
The need for a repeat intervention was determined by each
patient’s local physician(s). Clinical indications for a repeat
intervention included low intragraft blood flow, elevated
venous pressures, arm swelling, prolonged time to hemo-
stasis, and graft thrombosis. Per study protocol, nonsignif-
icant lesions (<50% stenosis) were not treated.
For study patients receiving a stent graft, the postpro-
cedure definition of the target lesion was expanded to
include any intervention within the Viabahn device or
5 mm from the distal or proximal edges of the device.
For patients treated with balloon angioplasty, the venous
anastomosis continued to be the target lesion. During
interventions performed during the 24-month follow-up
period, if any study patient needed a stent graft, a Viabahn
stent graft was recommended.

 Study completion or discontinuation. Participation
in this study was considered complete once a patient
completed the full 24 months of follow-up or was with-
drawn before study completion. Reasons for study with-
drawal included abandonment of the vascular access circuit,
elimination of the target lesion from the vascular access
circuit, death, subject or investigator choice, or loss to
follow-up.
Statistical analysis. Two different patient populations
were used in the analyses of the data collected as part of
this trial (Fig 1). The intent-to-treat (ITT) population was
comprised of all patients randomized and treated in the
study. The effectiveness-per-protocol (EPP) population
excluded those patients with significant violations of the
protocol as determined by the study’s data safety monitoring
board. The sample size required to test the primary effec-
tiveness outcome, time to loss of target lesion primary
patency, was based on a one-sided log-rank test of superi-
ority. In calculating sample size, it was estimated that the
time to loss of target lesion primary patency was 54% at
6 months for the stent graft group and 40% at 6 months for
the balloon angioplasty group. PASS software (Kaysville,
Utah) was used to determine that a sample size of 280 sub-
jects would be required to achieve statistical significance.
RESULTS
A total of 293 patients at 31 clinical sites who pre-
sented with dysfunctional (ITT, n ¼ 164; EPP, n ¼ 151)
or thrombosed (ITT, n ¼ 129; EPP, n ¼ 118) prosthetic
hemodialysis grafts from September 2008 to May 2011
were enrolled, randomized, and treated with balloon an-
gioplasty (ITT, n ¼ 148; EPP, n ¼ 138) or a Viabahn stent
graft (ITT, n ¼ 145; EPP, n ¼ 131). With the exception of
ethnicity of the ITT population, there were no differences
in the demographic characteristics (Table III), medical his-
tory (Table III), clinical indications for patient referral
(Table IV), graft location and configuration (Table V),
vascular access history (Table VI), or clinical success
(Table VII) between the two treatment groups.
There was no difference in the number of subjects who
completed the 24-month follow-up between the stent graft
and balloon angioplasty groups (ITT, 45% vs 44%; EPP,
47% vs 45%). The most frequent reason for study with-
drawal was graft abandonment (ITT, 33% vs 38% [P ¼
.46]; EPP, 33% vs 38% [P ¼ .37]) followed by death
(ITT, 16% vs 15% [P ¼ .87]; EPP, 15% vs 14% [P ¼
.73]; Table VIII).
Procedural assessments. There were no differences
between the two treatment groups with respect to the
angiographic characteristics of the target lesion: target
lesion percent stenosis (ITT, 73% vs 74% [P ¼ .40];
EPP, 72% vs 74% [P ¼ .41]) and the total length of the
target lesion (ITT, 22 vs 24 mm [P ¼ .39]; EPP, 23 vs
25 mm [P ¼ .60]; Table IX). The ITT population of the
balloon angioplasty group had significantly more patients
with successful initial angioplasty at the target lesion, as
defined by 30% or less residual stenosis, compared with the
stent graft group (ITT, 68% vs 85% [P ¼ .001]; EPP, 70%
vs 84% [P ¼ .006]; Table X). Nearly all patients in the stent
graft group received a single stent graft (ITT, 97%; EPP,
987%).
The mean total procedure time was statistically longer
in the stent graft group compared with the balloon angio-
plasty group (ITT, 51 vs 44 minutes [P ¼ .002]; EPP, 50
vs 45 minutes [P ¼ .015]). More patients in the stent graft
group received intraprocedural antibiotics compared with
the balloon angioplasty (ITT, 43% vs 26% [P ¼ .002];
EPP, 44 vs 25% [P ¼ .002]). A similar percentage of pa-
tients in both the stent graft and balloon angioplasty
groups received heparin during the randomized treatment
procedure (ITT, 53% vs 60% [P ¼ .24]; EPP, 50% vs 60%
[P ¼ .11]).
There was no difference between the stent graft and
balloon angioplasty groups in the percentage of patients
with a secondary stenosis (ITT, 24% vs 21% [P ¼ .58];
EPP, 20% vs 20% [P >.99]; Table XI). For both groups,
the majority of these stenoses were located within the graft
(ITT, 68.6 vs 83.9% [P ¼ .17]; EPP, 65.4 vs 82.1%
[P ¼ .22]). The angiographic characteristics of the second-
ary lesions were not different between the two groups:
there were no differences in length (ITT, 16 vs 14 mm
[P ¼ .64]; EPP, 17 vs 14 mm [P ¼ .24]) or mean percent
stenosis (ITT, 67% vs 68% [P ¼ .79]; EPP, 69% vs 68%
[P ¼ .91]; Table XI).
Primary patency. Target lesion primary patency of the
stent graft group was statistically superior to the balloon
angioplasty group (ITT, P ¼ .006; EPP, P ¼ .008).

 At 6 months, the primary patency of the target lesion was
higher in the stent graft group than the balloon angioplasty
group (ITT, 51.6% vs 34.2%; EPP, 52.9% vs 35.5%) and
was higher at every time point of the 24-month analysis
period (Fig 2, A). The median time to loss of target lesion
primary patency increased by 88% in the stent graft group
compared with the balloon angioplasty group (EPP, 203 vs
108 days). The most common intervention to end primary
patency of the target lesion in both the stent graft and
balloon angioplasty group was the need for an additional
angioplasty procedure (EPP, 63.4% vs 76.1%; P ¼ .025).
Circuit primary patency was also statistically superior in
the stent graft group over the balloon angioplasty group
(ITT, P ¼ .035; EPP, P ¼ .035). At 6 months the primary

 patency of the circuit was significantly greater in the stent
graft group than the balloon angioplasty group (ITT,
41.5% vs 28.4%; EPP, 43.4% vs 29.4%) and was signifi-
cantly greater at every time point of the 24-month analysis
period (Fig 2, B). The median time to loss of circuit
primary
patency
increased
by
38.5%
(EPP,
126
vs
91 days). More interventional procedures ending circuit
primary patency were performed outside the target lesion
in the stent graft group than the balloon angioplasty group
(EPP, 79.6% vs 53.7% [P # .001]). Moreover, the stent
graft group experienced a higher percentage of procedures
ending circuit primary patency within the prosthetic graft
than the balloon angioplasty group (EPP, 45.4 vs 25.2%
[P ¼ .001]).
Dysfunctional vs thrombosed grafts. Hemodialysis
graft thrombosis was the most common indication for pa-
tient enrollment for both treatment groups (ITT, 43.4% vs
44.6% [P ¼ .91]; EPP, 41.2% vs 46.4% [P ¼ .46];
Table IV). Patients with thrombosed grafts had lower
target lesion primary patency (EPP: stent graft, 64.6% vs
36.1% and balloon angioplasty, 45.8% vs 23.5%) and circuit
primary patency (EPP: stent graft, 49.7% vs 34.2% and
balloon angioplasty, 35.9 vs 21.8%) (Table XII) at the 6-
month follow-up
interval. Of note,
patients with
a
thrombosed graft treated with a Viabahn stent graft had
increased target lesion primary patency at 6 months when
compared
with
treatment
with
balloon
angioplasty
(EPP, 36.1% vs 23.5%).
Prior interventions at target lesion. For patients
treated with balloon angioplasty, the primary patency of
both the target lesion and the circuit worsened as the num-
ber of previous interventions performed on the target
lesion increased (Table XII). Patients in the angioplasty
group who had at least one prior intervention at the target

 lesion had decreased target lesion primary patency at
6 months (29.2% vs 43.9%) when compared with patients
with no prior interventions. For patients in the stent graft
group, the primary patency of the target lesion at 6 months
was

for
patients

compared with 53.8% for patients with at least one prior

Stent graft across the antecubital fossa. Twenty-two
patients had a Viabahn stent graft deployed across the ante-
cubital fossa and these patients had better patency of the
target lesion and the entire circuit when compared with
patients with stent grafts that did not cross the elbow joint
(Table XII). Target lesion primary patency was higher
(EPP, 72.4% vs 49.2%) and circuit primary patency was
higher (EPP, 67.3% vs 39.0%) when the stent graft crossed
the elbow joint.
Adverse events. There were no differences in the
proportion of patients who experienced any device, proce-
dure, and treatment site-related adverse event, either major
or minor, between the two treatment groups (P ¼ .98).
Four patients in the stent graft treatment group and two
patients in the angioplasty treatment group had a minor
adverse event during the 30-day postprocedure period.
Two major adverse events occurred in patients treated with
angioplasty. Twenty days after treatment, one patient had
significant infiltration along the hemodialysis graft that led
to abandonment of the graft. The second patient devel-
oped a significant hematoma at the venous anastomosis
30 days after treatment that led to abandonment of the
hemodialysis graft. There were no major procedure-related
or stent graft-related adverse events in patients treated with
a Viabahn stent graft during the 24-month study period.

 DISCUSSION
In the United States, nearly 75,000 patients undergo
chronic hemodialysis treatment using a prosthetic hemodi-
alysis graft.17 The majority of these patients develop neoin-
timal hyperplastic stenoses at the venous anastomosis and
along the vascular access circuit, often within the first
year after graft placement.4 These obstructive lesions
reduce intra-access blood flow, decrease the efficiency of
hemodialysis treatment, and increase the risk of access
thrombosis.17 Balloon angioplasty remains a standard treat-
ment for neointimal hyperplastic stenoses causing clinically
significant problems with both prosthetic hemodialysis
grafts
and
autogenous
fistulas.14
However,
there
is
increasing clinical evidence that balloon angioplasty is not
as effective as previously believed. The “reasonable goal”
of 50% primary patency at 6 months, stated in the 2006
Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI)
Guidelines for Vascular Access, can be difficult to achieve
using angioplasty alone.14 The continuing popularity of
balloon angioplasty may be based on the ease and speed
of
the
procedure,
not
on
its
effectiveness
for
this
application.
This clinical trial confirmed results reported by previous
studies; suboptimal patency after balloon angioplasty of
venous anastomotic stenoses involving prosthetic hemodi-
alysis grafts.6,7
The ITT population of 148 patients treated with angio-
plasty had a 6-month primary patency rate of 34.2%, which is
well below the K/DOQI “reasonable goal” of 50%.14
Analysis of all patients treated with angioplasty revealed
subgroups with differing results. Patients who had under-
gone a previous intervention at the target lesion had lower
primary patency at 6 months when compared with patients
with no prior interventions at the target lesion (29.2% vs
43.9%). These findings are consistent with those reported
by Kanterman et al4; patency rates diminish with each succes-
sive angioplasty procedure. Balloon angioplasty causes sig-
nificant vascular damage that incites the proliferation of
neointimal hyperplasia and accelerates restenosis.18-20
A stent graft can resist elastic recoil, optimize luminal
diameter, and provide a physical barrier to prevent resteno-
sis by the offending lesion. These characteristics of stent
grafts have made these appealing devices for treatment of
neointimal hyperplastic stenoses.21 However, widespread
acceptance of stent grafts has been tempered by the greater
cost of the device when compared with balloon angio-
plasty. The use of stent grafts as first treatment of all steno-
sis continues to be debated.21
In this study, the Viabahn stent graft provided an effec-
tive barrier to prevent restenosis. When compared with
balloon angioplasty, patients treated with the Viabahn
stent graft had superior primary patency at the target lesion
and the access circuit for every time point during the 2-
year follow-up period. The intention-to-treat population
of 145 patients treated with a Viabahn stent graft had a
target lesion primary patency rate of 51.6% at 6 months,
which exceeds the “reasonable goal” established by the
K/DOQI guidelines. The subgroup of patients with
dysfunctional grafts treated with a Viabahn stent graft
had a target lesion primary patency rate of 64.6% at
6 months, which not only exceeds the goal of the K/
DOQI guidelines, it also exceeds the patency rates re-
ported by a similar clinical trial using a different stent
graft.6 Furthermore, the number of prior interventions at
the target lesion did not negatively affect graft patency
for patients treated with a Viabahn stent graft.
This study is the first to compare results after angio-
plasty of dysfunctional vs thrombosed grafts, revealing sub-
stantial differences in 6-month primary patency at the
venous anastomosis (45.8% vs 23.5%) and the access circuit
(35.9% vs 21.8%). For patients presenting with a throm-
bosed graft, treatment of a venous anastomotic stenosis
with a Viabahn stent graft can improve primary patency
at 6 months substantially (23.5% vs 45.8%). However,
the best 6-month results are achieved when using a Via-
bahn stent graft to treat significant stenosis involving
dysfunctional but still patent prosthetic hemodialysis grafts.
Previous studies have reported that it is safe to deploy a
Viabahn stent graft across the inguinal ligament and the
Table XII. Additional measures of effectiveness at 6-months trend toward improved patency of stent grafts

 popliteal fossa.22,23 This study confirmed that it was safe
and effective to deploy a Viabahn stent graft across the
antecubital fossa. In the 22 patients who had a Viabahn
stent graft placed across the elbow joint the primary
patency at the venous anastomosis and along the access cir-
cuit was improved when compared with stent grafts that
did not cross the joint space.
CONCLUSIONS
The results of this study support the contention that
early use of a Viabahn stent graft will improve long-term
patency at the venous anastomosis of a prosthetic hemodi-
alysis graft. When compared with balloon angioplasty,
treatment with a Viabahn stent graft provided superior
patency at the target lesion and for the entire access circuit
during the entire 24-month follow-up period.
Treatment of dysfunctional hemodialysis grafts, using
either angioplasty or a stent graft, provides superior results
when compared with treatment of thrombosed grafts.
