Abstract
The roles of different dietary proteins in the aetiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) remain unclear. We investigated the associations of dietary
proteins with the risk of incident T2D in Finnish men from the prospective Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study. The study
included 2332 men aged 42–60 years at the baseline examinations in 1984–1989. Protein intakes were calculated from 4-d dietary records.
Incident T2D was determined by self-administered questionnaires, fasting blood glucose measurements, 2-h oral glucose tolerance tests, and
with national registers. The multivariable-adjusted risk of T2D on the basis of protein intakes was compared by the Cox proportional hazard
ratios (HR). During the mean follow-up of 19·3 years, 432 incident T2D cases were identified. Total, animal, meat or dairy product protein
intakes were not associated with risk of T2D when the potential confounders were accounted for. Plant (multivariable-adjusted extreme-
quartile HR 0·65; 95 % CI 0·42, 1·00; Ptrend 0·04) and egg (HR 0·67; 95 % CI 0·44, 1·00; Ptrend 0·03) protein intakes were associated with a
decreased risk of T2D. Adjustments for BMI, plasma glucose and serum insulin slightly attenuated associations. Replacing 1 % energy from
carbohydrates with energy from protein was associated with a 5 % (95 % CI 0, 11) increased risk of T2D, but adjustment for fibre intake
attenuated the association. Replacing 1 % of energy from animal protein with energy from plant protein was associated with 18% (95 % CI 0, 32)
decreased risk of T2D. This association remained after adjusting for BMI. In conclusion, favouring plant and egg proteins appeared to be
beneficial in preventing T2D.
Key words: Animal protein: Dietary protein: Eggs: Plant protein: Prospective studies: Type 2 diabetes
Protein-rich diets have become a popular strategy to enhance
weight management and weight loss(1). Because obesity is
one of the main risk factors of type 2 diabetes (T2D)(2),
increasing protein intake may also have potential for T2D
prevention(3,4). The optimal amount and quality of protein
for averting T2D is, however, controversial(3–5). Although short-
term interventions comparing higher v. lower protein diets
have shown beneficial effects on weight loss, body composition
and some metabolic markers(1,4,6,7), the results of long-term
interventions have generally been modest(1,8). Furthermore,
some prospective studies have raised the concern that even
moderately higher protein intake may actually increase the
risk of T2D(9–14), although null associations have also been
reported(15–17). Some(18,19), but not all(20), epidemiological stu-
dies have also suggested that replacing protein with carbo-
hydrates could decrease the risk of T2D. Contrary to short-term
interventions, prospective studies have indicated that the
association of high protein intake with higher T2D risk is
partly mediated via the impact of higher protein intake on
obesity(10–13).
Strong indications exist that different protein sources are not
similar with regard to risk of T2D. Intake of red meat, especially
of processed red meat, has been associated with an increased
risk of T2D(21–24), whereas, for example, fermented dairy
products have generally been associated with a decreased
risk(24–26). Different protein sources may also induce distinct
effects on glucose and insulin metabolism or inflammation,
but research findings are scarce and inconclusive(27–32).
It is not clear whether the divergent associations of protein
sources with the risk of T2D are due to the differential peptide
or amino acid compositions of protein sources or due to some
other factors. In general, animal protein has been associated
with an increased risk of T2D(10,11,13,33), whereas plant protein
has had a neutral(10,11,17,33) or an inverse association(13). How-
ever, to our knowledge, only two epidemiological studies have
more comprehensively investigated the protein intake from
different dietary sources with regard to T2D incidence(10,18).
van Nielen et al.(10) did not find evidence that protein from
dairy products, fish or meat would specifically be accountable
for the increased risk of T2D that was observed with higher

 animal protein intake. Similä et al.(18) observed that replacing
energy coming from either total, meat or milk protein with
energy coming from carbohydrates was associated with a
decreased risk of T2D.
Because of the current limited knowledge, we investigated
the associations of proteins from different dietary sources with
the risk of incident T2D in middle-aged and older Finnish men.
We also examined whether intakes of proteins are associated
with risk factors for T2D, that is, BMI, fasting plasma glucose
and serum insulin, and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
(hsCRP) at baseline. In the secondary analyses, we investigated
the associations of the main dietary protein sources with the risk
of T2D.
Methods
Study population
The Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study (KIHD)
was designed to investigate risk factors for CVD, atherosclerosis
and related outcomes in a population-based, randomly selected
sample of men from eastern Finland(34). The baseline exam-
inations were carried out from 1984 to 1989 (online Supple-
mentary Fig. S1). A total of 2682 men who were 42, 48, 54, or
60 years old at baseline (83 % of those eligible) were recruited
in two cohorts. The first cohort consisted of 1166 men who
were 54 years old and enrolled between 1984 and 1986, and
the second cohort included 1516 men who were 42, 48, 54,
or 60 years old and enrolled between 1986 and 1989.
Re-examination rounds were conducted 4, 11 and 20 years after
the baseline (online Supplementary Fig. S1). The baseline
characteristics of the entire study population have been
described previously(34). The KIHD study complies with the
Declaration of Helsinki and has an approval from the Research
Ethics Committee of the University of Kuopio. All subjects gave
written informed consent. Subjects with T2D (n 167), impaired
fasting glucose (n 127) or unknown diabetes status (n 38) at
baseline, or those with missing data on dietary intakes (n 18)
were excluded, which left 2332 men for the analyses of incident
T2D. Data on plasma glucose, serum insulin and serum hsCRP
concentrations were available for 2312 men at baseline.
Other measurements
Fasting venous blood samples were collected between 08.00
and 10.00 hours at baseline and at the follow-up examinations.
Subjects were instructed to abstain from ingesting alcohol for
3 d and from smoking and eating for 12 h before providing the
sample. Detailed descriptions of determining serum lipids and
lipoproteins(35) and the assessment of medical history and
medications(35), family history of diseases(35), smoking(35),
alcohol consumption(35), serum ferritin(35) and physical acti-
vity(36) at baseline have been published. Number of years of
education, annual income and marital status were obtained
from self-administered questionnaires. Family history of dia-
betes was defined as positive if a first-degree relative of the
participant had a history of diabetes. BMI was computed as the
ratio of weight (kg):the square of height (m2), both measured at
the study baseline.
Assessment of dietary intakes
The consumption of foods at baseline was assessed with a
guided food record of 4 d, one of which was a weekend, by
using household measures. A picture book of common foods
and dishes was used to help in the estimation of portion sizes.
The picture book contained 126 of the most common foods and
drinks consumed in Finland during the 1980s. For each food
item, the participant could choose from three to five commonly
used portion sizes or describe the portion size in relation to
those shown in the book. To further improve accuracy,
instructions were given and completed food records were
checked by a nutritionist together with the participant. Nutrient
intakes were estimated by using NUTRICA 2.5® software (Social
Insurance Institution). The software’s databank is mainly based
on Finnish values of the nutrient composition of foods.
Protein intakes from different animal and plant sources were
calculated (online Supplementary Table S1). Total meat inclu-
ded red meat, white meat and offal. Processed red meat
included all red meat that had undergone industrial processing,
for example, by adding salt or preservatives. Participants did not
use processed white meat. Total dairy product intake was cal-
culated as a sum of non-fermented dairy products (mainly milk,
cream and ice cream) and fermented dairy products (mainly
sour milk, curdled milk, yogurt and cheese) (online Supple-
mentary Table S1).
Of the average daily protein intake, 2·2 g (0·4 % of total
energy intake (E%)) was from sources that could not easily be
classified as animal or plant protein (e.g. dry ready meals and
chocolate) and was not included into either of the categories.
For the analyses of major sources of dietary protein, we com-
bined the most protein-rich foods of the plant protein category
– that is, grain products, legumes, nuts and seeds – to assess the
intake of the major plant protein sources as a whole. The car-
bohydrates from whole-grain products, legumes, nuts, seeds,
mushrooms, fruits, berries and vegetables (excluding potatoes)
were combined to assess the intake of high-quality carbohy-
drates. Each nutrient, except for fibre and cholesterol, was
energy-adjusted by the residual method(37).
Measurement of plasma glucose, serum insulin and
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
Plasma glucose was measured using a glucose dehydrogenase
method (Merck) after precipitation of proteins with TCA using a
clinical chemistry analyser (Kone Specific; KONE Instruments
Oy). The serum samples for insulin determination were stored
frozen at –80 °C. Serum insulin was determined with a Novo
Biolabs radioimmunoassay kit (Novo Nordisk) using Multi
Gamma counter with Ria Calc software. Serum hsCRP was
measured
with
an
immunometric
assay
(Immulite
High
Sensitivity CRP Assay; Diagnostic Products Corporation) using
clinical chemistry analyser Kone Specific.

 Diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes
At baseline, T2D was defined as a self-reported physician
diagnosis of T2D and/or fasting plasma glucose ≥7·0 mmol/l.
Impaired fasting glucose was defined by using the WHO
criterion: fasting plasma glucose of 6·1–6·9 mmol/l. At the
re-examination rounds 4, 11 and 20 years after the baseline, a
2-h oral glucose tolerance test was additionally performed, with
criteria for T2D diagnosis as plasma glucose ≥11·1 mmol/l.
During the entire study follow-up period, information about
incident cases of T2D in the whole study population was also
gathered from the national hospital discharge registry and the
Social Insurance Institution of Finland register for reimburse-
ment of medicine expenses used for T2D. There were no losses
to follow-up.
Statistical analysis
In the main analyses, we used energy-adjusted protein intakes
expressed
as
g/d,
to
allow
comprehensible
comparison
between proteins from different food sources. The univariate
relations between total, animal and plant protein intake
and baseline characteristics were assessed by means and
linear regression (for continuous variables) or by χ2 tests
(for categorical variables). Correlations between intakes of
different proteins were estimated by Spearman’s correlation
coefficients. The Cox proportional hazards regression models
were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) in exposure quartiles,
with the lowest category as the reference. Person-years of
follow-up, which were calculated from the baseline to the
date of diabetes diagnosis, death or the end of follow-up
(31 December 2010), were used as the underlying time
variable in these models. The validity of the proportional
hazards assumptions was evaluated by using Schoenfeld
residuals, and the assumptions were met. Absolute risk change
was calculated by multiplying the absolute risk in the reference
group
by
the
multivariable-adjusted
HR
change
in
the
comparison group.
The confounders were selected on the basis of established
risk factors for T2D, previously published associations with T2D
in the KIHD study, or on associations with exposures or out-
comes in the present analysis. Model 1 included age (years),
examination year and energy intake (kJ/d (kcal/d)). The multi-
variable model (model 2) included the variables in model 1 plus
marital status (married/unmarried), income (euros/year), use of
hypertension medication (yes or no), family history of T2D (yes
or
no),
pack-years
of
smoking
(packs
smoked/d × years
smoked), education years, leisure-time physical activity (kJ/d
(kcal/d)), serum ferritin (µg/l), and intake of alcohol (g/week).
Model 3 included the variables in model 2 and the dietary
factors: glycaemic index, intakes of fibre (g/d), Mg (mg/d),
coffee (ml/d), cholesterol (mg/d), and SFA (g/d), MUFA (g/d),
PUFA (g/d) and trans-fatty acids (g/d). Models that include both
the specific protein and fat, but not carbohydrates, can be
interpreted as replacement of carbohydrates and other proteins
with the protein of interest. Further adjustment for intake of
fruits, berries and vegetables (excluding potatoes) (g/d) did not
appreciably change the associations (change in estimates <5 %).
Model 4 was further adjusted for potential effect mediators,
which were measured at the study baseline: BMI (kg/m2),
fasting plasma glucose (mmol/l) and fasting serum insulin
(mU/l). All quantitative variables were entered in the models as
continuous variables. The cohort mean was used to replace
missing values in covariates (<2·5 %)(38). We did not observe
significant multicollinearity between independent variables
used in the multivariable models: variance inflation factors were
<10, tolerance values were >0·10 and correlation coefficients
were <0·7.
Tests of linear trend were conducted by assigning the median
values for each category of exposure variable and treating those
as a single continuous variable. The statistical significance of the
interactions with age, BMI and physical activity level were
assessed by likelihood-ratio tests with the use of a cross-product
term. The median value of each of these factors was used to
divide subjects into two groups in which the associations were
separately assessed.
In the substitution models, we assessed the isoenergetic
replacement of 1 E% coming from total or high-quality carbo-
hydrates with an equal amount of energy from different pro-
teins. All the macronutrients except the one that was replaced
were simultaneously added into the Cox proportional hazards
regression models. We also assessed the replacement of protein
from animal sources with protein from plant sources. All pro-
teins were simultaneously added into the models, and the
difference of regression coefficients of two proteins of interest,
their variance and covariance were used for calculating HR and
95 % CI for substitution models. The adjustments in the sub-
stitution models were the same as those in model 3 in the main
analyses (listed above), except that glycaemic index and fibre
intake were not included in the models where carbohydrates
were replaced with protein to allow comparison of different
types of carbohydrates.
The mean values of BMI, plasma glucose, serum insulin and
serum hsCRP in quartiles of different proteins were analysed
using ANCOVA. The same adjustments were used as in model 3
in the main analyses (listed above), but the models for glucose,
insulin and hsCRP were further adjusted for BMI, to observe the
associations independently of BMI.
In the secondary analyses, we investigated the associations of
the major protein sources with the risk of T2D. Exposure
quartiles were based on intakes calculated as g/d. The same
covariates were used as in the protein models, but the intake of
fruits, berries and vegetables (excluding potatoes) (g/d) was
used as an additional covariate in models 3, 4 and 5. The
possible effect mediators – that is, serum ferritin, glycaemic
index, and intakes of fibre, Mg, cholesterol, and SFA, MUFA,
PUFA and trans-fatty acids – were only added to models 4 and
5. These factors have been suggested to explain the associations
of protein sources with the risk of T2D(2,23,39,40). The possible
mediators were not used in the substitution models either,
where we assessed the replacement of 50 g portions of protein
sources with each other. All protein sources were simulta-
neously added into the model, and HR and CI were calculated
as in the protein substitution models (see above). All P values
were two-tailed (α 0·05). Data were analysed using SPSS 21.0
for Windows (IBM Corp.).

 Results
Baseline characteristics
The average protein intake was 92·9 g/d (15·7 E%), of which
69·8 %
was
from
animal
sources
(online
Supplementary
Table S2). Main contributors for animal protein intake were
dairy products (44·4 % of the animal protein), meat (37·7 %) and
fish (12·5 %), whereas grain products provided the majority of
the plant protein (79·5 %), followed by potatoes (9·3 %) and
other vegetables, fruits and berries (7·9 %). Animal and plant
protein intakes were negatively correlated (online Supplemen-
tary Table S2). Meat and dairy product protein intakes were
equally correlated with animal protein intake, but negatively
correlated with each other.
Table 1 and the online Supplementary Table S3 show the
baseline characteristics according to intakes of total, animal and
plant protein. Men with a higher total protein intake were more
likely to be married and have higher education and income
than men with a lower intake. Higher total protein intake was
associated with favourable dietary factors, such as higher fibre
intake and lower intake of alcohol, but with higher BMI.
Associations with animal protein were more mixed: higher
animal protein intake was associated with higher BMI, higher
proportion of current smokers and lower fibre intake, but with
higher intake of PUFA and lower intake of trans-fatty acids.
Those with a higher plant protein intake had, in general, a
healthier lifestyle: they were physically more active, had lower
BMI and a healthier diet, were less likely to smoke and used less
alcohol than those with lower intake.
Associations of dietary proteins with risk factors of
type 2 diabetes
At baseline, higher total, animal and fish protein intakes were
associated with higher BMI after multivariable adjustments, but
intake of other types of protein did not associate with BMI
(online Supplementary Table S4). Protein from plant sources,
especially from grain products, was associated with lower
fasting plasma glucose concentrations. Proteins from red meat
and non-fermented dairy products were associated with higher
fasting serum insulin concentrations and proteins from fish,
cheese and grain products were associated with lower insulin
concentrations. Other proteins did not associate with glucose
metabolism markers, and no associations were observed with
serum hsCRP.
Associations of dietary proteins with risk of type 2 diabetes
During the mean follow-up time of 19·3 years, 432 incident
cases of T2D were identified. Total protein intake or proteins
from total red meat, unprocessed red meat or fish were not
associated with the risk of T2D (Table 2). Animal protein intake,
protein from total meat and protein from processed meat were
associated with an increased risk of T2D in the model that was
adjusted for age, examination year and energy intake (Table 2,
model 1), but these associations were not statistically significant
after further adjustments for potential non-dietary and dietary

 factors (models 2, 3 and 4). Protein from eggs was associated
with a decreased risk of T2D (model 1), and although the
association was attenuated after multivariable adjustments, it
remained statistically significant (absolute risk in the lowest
quartile 21·3 %, absolute risk reduction in the highest quartile
7·1 %, model 3). On the basis of observed associations between
proteins and BMI, plasma glucose and serum insulin (online
Supplementary Table S4), we tested them as possible effect
mediators. Inclusion of these factors into the model further
slightly attenuated the association between egg protein intake
and risk of T2D (HR in the highest v. lowest intake quartile 0·74;
95 % CI 0·49, 1·13). Total dairy product protein intake was
associated with an increased risk of T2D in the models adjusted
for non-dietary factors (models 1 and 2, Table 2), but in the
multivariable-adjusted models total dairy product protein or
protein from any dairy product subtype was not associated with
T2D risk (models 3 and 4).
Plant protein intake was associated with a decreased risk of
T2D (model 1, Table 2), and this association remained statisti-
cally significant after multivariable adjustments (absolute risk in
the lowest quartile 20·4 %, absolute risk reduction in the highest
quartile 7·2 %, model 3). Each 5 g higher plant protein intake
was associated with 17 % (HR 0·83; 95 % CI 0·71, 0·99) lower
risk of T2D. Adjustment for the potential effect mediators
slightly attenuated the associations (model 4, Table 2). Proteins
from both grain products and from non-grain plant products
showed non-significant associations towards lower risk of T2D.
In the substitution models, replacing 1 E% from carbo-
hydrates with an equal amount of energy coming from total
protein was associated with a 5 % (HR 1·05; 95 % CI 1·00, 1·11)
increased risk of T2D, whereas the replacement with plant
protein was associated with an 18 % (HR 0·82; 95 % CI 0·69,
0·98) decreased risk (Fig. 1). Replacing carbohydrates with
protein from other sources was not associated with the risk
(Fig. 1). When the models were adjusted for fibre intake,
replacing total or high-quality carbohydrates with protein was
no longer statistically significantly associated with an increased
risk of T2D (HR 1·01; 95 % CI 0·95, 1·07 and HR 1·01; 95 % CI
0·94, 1·07, respectively), and the inverse association of repla-
cing total or high-quality carbohydrates with plant protein was
also attenuated (HR 0·89; 95 % CI 0·74, 1·07 and HR 0·86; 95 %
CI 0·71, 1·05). After additional adjustment for BMI, the HR for
replacing total or high-quality carbohydrates with protein were
0·99 (95 % CI 0·94, 1·05) and 0·99 (95 % CI 0·93, 1·05), respec-
tively, and for replacing total or high-quality carbohydrates with
plant protein 0·85 (95 % CI 0·70, 1·02) and 0·83 (95 % CI 0·68,
1·02), respectively.
Replacing 1 E% coming from any animal protein, except for
protein from eggs, with energy from plant protein was asso-
ciated with a 14–20 % decreased risk of T2D, although not all
associations reached statistical significance (Fig. 2). However,
almost all associations were slightly stronger after further
adjustment for BMI (online Supplementary Table S5).
Associations of dietary protein sources with risk of
type 2 diabetes
In the secondary analyses with the protein sources, total meat
intake was associated with a markedly increased risk of T2D
after multivariable adjustments (online Supplementary Table S4,
absolute risk in the lowest quartile 16·1 %, absolute risk increase
in the highest quartile 7·3 %, model 3). Processed red meat
intake showed a borderline statistically significant association
with a higher risk (Ptrend 0·06, model 3). Intakes of total red
meat or unprocessed red meat did not associate with the risk of
T2D (online Supplementary Table S6 ). Higher dairy product
intake, especially fermented dairy product intake from sources
other than cheese, was associated with borderline increased
risk of T2D (online Supplementary Table S6). Intake of major
plant protein sources was associated with a decreased risk
of
T2D
(models

 This association was markedly attenuated after inclusion of
nutrients to the model (model 4).
In the substitution models, replacing 50 g of total meat, total
red meat, processed red meat, fish or dairy products with plant
protein sources were all associated with a decreased risk of T2D
(online Supplementary Fig. S2). These associations were, how-
ever, not statistically significant after inclusion of BMI into the
models (online Supplementary Table S7). Replacement of 50 g of
processed red meat (HR 0·72; 95% CI 0·57, 0·91), unprocessed
red meat (HR 0·77; 95 % CI 0·60, 0·97), fish (HR 0·72; 95 % CI
0·57, 0·91) or dairy products (HR 0·76; 95 % CI 0·61, 0·94) with an
equal amount of eggs was also associated with a decreased risk
of T2D. Further adjustments for BMI had little impact on these
associations (online Supplementary Table S8).
Sensitivity analyses
We tested effect modification by BMI, age, and physical activity.
Interactions were not statistically significant (Pinteractions > 0·05),
except for the intake of protein from non-grain plant sources
and BMI (below the median BMI: HR/5 g intake 0·98; 95 % CI
0·59, 1·62; above the median BMI: HR 0·78; 95 % CI 0·56, 1·07
(model 3); Pinteraction 0·05) and for non-fermented dairy pro-
ducts and age (below the median age: HR/100 g intake 1·00;
95 % CI 0·95, 1·04; above the median age: HR 1·04; 95 % CI 0·99,
1·09 (model 3); Pinteraction 0·04).
Because BMI is a risk factor for T2D and related to intake of
energy and most nutrients, including protein, BMI might also be
a confounder instead of a mediator. Adjustment for BMI did not
attenuate the statistical significance of the protein associations
observed in model 2, but slightly attenuated the association
with egg protein in the model 3. After the additional adjustment
for BMI, the extreme-quartile HR for the intake of egg protein in
model 3 was 0·70 (95 % CI 0·46, 1·06). In the secondary ana-
lyses, the extreme-quartile HR for intakes of total meat, pro-
cessed red meat and major plant protein sources after the
additional adjustment for BMI in model 3 were 1·32 (95 % CI
0·99, 1·77), 1·15 (95 % CI 0·87, 1·53) and 0·74 (95 % CI 0·53,
1·04), respectively.
Because the long follow-up time may attenuate associations
with the exposures that were assessed only at baseline, we
also tested the associations of proteins and protein sources
with the risk of T2D after 10 years of follow-up (seventy-two
cases). The associations were generally similar, but only the
association of egg protein intake with lower risk of T2D was
statistically significant (HR 0·17; 95 % CI 0·06, 0·49; model 3).
For example, the extreme-quartile HR in model 3 for total,
animal and plant protein intakes were 1·07 (95 % CI 0·43, 2·71),
0·98 (95 % CI 0·38, 2·49) and 0·42 (95 % CI 0·13, 1·29), respec-
tively. We also excluded the T2D cases that occurred during
the first 2 years of follow-up (n 3), but this did not change the
associations.
Discussion
In this population-based cohort study in middle-aged and older
Finnish men, total or animal protein intakes were not inde-
pendently associated with the risk of T2D, but plant and egg
protein intakes were associated with a decreased risk. In the
substitution models, replacement of energy from carbohydrates
with energy from protein was associated with an increased risk
of T2D. Replacing animal or dairy product protein or carbo-
hydrates with plant protein was associated with a decreased risk
of T2D. Results of food substitution models showed similar
beneficial associations of replacing typical animal protein foods
with foods rich in plant protein.
Previous studies have observed inconclusive results, with
many(10–14), but not all(15–17), suggesting that either total or
animal protein intake associates with an increased risk of T2D.
Only one previous epidemiological study found plant protein to
associate with a decreased risk of T2D(13). Discrepancy
between the results may be due to differences in both quality
and quantity of protein and carbohydrates. For example, in our
study the total protein intake was only moderate in the highest

 quartile (18·6 E%) compared with some other cohorts, in which
the intake has been >20 E% in the highest intake group(10,13).
Also, although higher total protein intake was associated with
lower carbohydrate intake, the difference was modest (2·4 E%
between the lowest and highest quartiles) compared with the
majority of studies, which have observed total protein intake to
associate with the risk of T2D(10–13).
In our study, replacing both total and high-quality carbo-
hydrates with protein was associated with an increased risk of
T2D, whereas a study from the USA indicated a risk increase
only when high-quality carbohydrates were replaced(13). This
difference could be explained by the more fundamental role of
whole grains in the Finnish diet compared with the American
diet(41), given that high whole-grain intake has been associated
with a decreased risk of T2D(2,41). The importance of carbo-
hydrate quality is also emphasised by the finding that replacing
carbohydrates with protein was not associated with a risk of
T2D after adjustment for fibre.
Our results indicate that fibre intake may not be the only
benefit of favouring plant protein sources, as the association of
plant protein with a lower risk of T2D remained after adjustment
for fibre. Also, replacement of animal protein with plant protein
was statistically significant despite fibre adjustment. Thus, the
plant protein in particular may be of importance in T2D preven-
tion. In the analyses with diabetes risk factors, plant protein intake
was associated with lower plasma glucose concentrations, sug-
gesting that plant protein could affect T2D risk via glucose
metabolism. Although trials have indicated that replacing animal
protein with plant protein could improve glycaemic control(42),
more investigations are needed to confirm these benefits. Fur-
thermore, other factors related to plant protein intake, such as
polyphenols, might partly explain the association between plant
protein intake and a decreased risk of T2D(32,43).
Our results support the previous observations that the asso-
ciations between protein intake and T2D risk may be partly
mediated by BMI(10–13). In our cohort, both total and animal
protein intakes were associated with higher BMI, and many of
the protein–T2D associations were slightly attenuated after
adjustment for BMI. However, it is hard to disentangle whether
BMI is a mediator or a confounder, and the slight attenuation of
the associations after inclusion of BMI into the models might
also be due to reduced confounding. Importantly, the advan-
tages of replacing animal proteins with plant protein remained
after adjustment for BMI, suggesting that this association was
not significantly affected by the weight status.
When animal protein intake was divided into more specific
categories, multivariable-adjusted protein models did not show
statistically significant associations, except for the association of
egg protein with a lower risk of T2D. We have earlier reported
in this study population that egg intake was associated with a
significantly decreased risk of T2D(44). Because egg protein
intake is highly correlated with egg intake, we cannot conclude
whether the beneficial association was due to the whole egg
intake or egg protein itself. In addition to being of high quality,
egg proteins are suggested to have bioactive functions, such as
anti-inflammatory properties(45).
In the models with protein sources, high total meat intake and
high total and fermented dairy product intakes indicated an
association with an increased risk of T2D. The association
between high total meat intake and an increased risk of T2D
remained after adjustments for SFA, cholesterol, serum ferritin and
BMI, which have been suggested to explain the association
between meat intake and risk of T2D(23,40). High exposure
to advanced glycation end products, trimethylamine N-oxide,
branched chain amino acids, nitrites and Na could thus be more
potential factors(23,39,40). Whereas meta-analyses have generally
indicated the most robust association for processed red meat
intake(21–23), in our study, total meat intake was the strongest
predictor of T2D risk, whereas processed red meat intake showed
only a borderline association. Similarly, a more pronounced
association for total meat intake was observed in another
Finnish study(46). Interestingly, the association between processed
red meat and an increased risk of T2D appears to be stronger in
the studies conducted in the USA or in Britain than in studies from
other European countries(23). Differences in the typically con-
sumed meats and preparation methods and in lifestyle factors
associated with meat intake could explain these results. For
example, intake of bacon, which appears to be especially strongly
associated with T2D(22,23), is rare in our population.
Meta-analyses have indicated either inverse(25) or neutral
association(26) between total dairy product intake and the risk of
T2D. The suggestion for a harmful association in our population
may be due to the exceptionally high dairy product intake. The
median intake was 689g, whereas the recent meta-analysis
reported medians between 111 and 400g(25). Very high dairy
product or meat intakes may be markers of an unbalanced
diet, which could explain the increased risk of T2D. The indicative
association
between
fermented
dairy
products
and
an
increased risk of T2D is also contradictory to meta-analyses that
have shown fermented dairy product intake, especially yogurt
intake, to associate with lower risk of T2D(25,26). Only 14% of
our study population consumed yogurt, whereas other types of
fermented dairy products, such as sour milk, were more
typical. Thus, further comparisons of different types of dairy
products are essential.
The strengths of this study include the long follow-up and
comprehensive information about dietary protein sources and
possible confounding factors. Although the 4-d food record
provides detailed information about diet and is not prone to
memory errors, it may not be the best method for capturing
foods that are consumed occasionally. The long follow-up time
may have attenuated the relationships between dietary proteins
and T2D; however, the associations were not markedly differ-
ent in the analyses with a shorter follow-up time. Despite
extensive adjustments, we cannot exclude the possibility of
residual confounding. In free-living people, many dietary
factors tend to correlate with each other. Thus, it is hard to
disentangle whether the observed associations are due to
specific nutrients or foods, or whether the associations rather
represent a healthy diet as a whole. For example, high plant
protein intake was strongly associated with a healthier lifestyle,
which may partly explain its association with a lower T2D risk.
The study population included Caucasian middle-aged men, so
results may not be generalisable to women and other age
groups or to other populations. Finally, the median intake of
protein was 18·6 E% in the highest consumption quartile; thus,

 the results may not be comparable with high-protein diets that
usually provide at least 20 E% of protein(31).
In conclusion, our results suggest that comparatively high
protein intake does not independently associate with risk of
T2D, but the quality of both protein and carbohydrates modify
the risk when protein is consumed in place of carbohydrates.
Favouring protein from plant sources and eggs over other
animal sources may be beneficial in the prevention of T2D.
Mechanisms behind the distinct associations of dietary proteins
with T2D risk require further investigation. Long-term inter-
ventions comparing diets with different macronutrient compo-
sition are also expected to shed more light on the potentiality of
higher protein consumption in T2D prevention(3,47).
