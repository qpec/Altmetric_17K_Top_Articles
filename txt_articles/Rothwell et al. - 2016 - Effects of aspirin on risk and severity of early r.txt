 ects of aspirin on risk and severity of early recurrent 
stroke after transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke: 
time-course analysis of randomised trials

Summary
Background Aspirin is recommended for secondary prevention after transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or ischaemic 
stroke on the basis of trials showing a 13% reduction in long-term risk of recurrent stroke. However, the risk of major 
stroke is very high for only the fi
 rst few days after TIA and minor ischaemic stroke, and observational studies show 
substantially greater benefi
 ts of early medical treatment in the acute phase than do longer-term trials. We hypothesised 
that the short-term benefi
 ts of early aspirin have been underestimated.
Methods Pooling the individual patient data from all randomised trials of aspirin versus control in secondary 
prevention after TIA or ischaemic stroke, we studied the eff
 ects of aspirin on the risk and severity of recurrent stroke, 
stratifi
 ed by the following time periods: less than 6 weeks, 6–12 weeks, and more than 12 weeks after randomisation. 
We compared the severity of early recurrent strokes between treatment groups with shift analysis of modifi
 ed Rankin 
Scale (mRS) score. To understand possible mechanisms of action, we also studied the time course of the interaction 
between eff
 ects of aspirin and dipyridamole in secondary prevention of stroke. In a further analysis we pooled data 
from trials of aspirin versus control in which patients were randomised less than 48 h after major acute stroke, 
stratifi
 ed by severity of baseline neurological defi
 cit, to establish the very early time course of the eff
 ect of aspirin on 
risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke and how this diff
 ers by severity at baseline.
Findings We pooled data for 15 778 participants from 12 trials of aspirin versus control in secondary prevention. Aspirin 
reduced the 6 week risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke by about 60% (84 of 8452 participants in the aspirin group had an 
ischaemic stroke vs 175 of 7326; hazard ratio [HR] 0·42, 95% CI 0·32–0·55, p<0·0001) and disabling or fatal ischaemic 
stroke by about 70% (36 of 8452 vs 110 of 7326; 0·29, 0·20–0·42, p<0·0001), with greatest benefi
 t noted in patients 
presenting with TIA or minor stroke (at 0–2 weeks, two of 6691 participants in the aspirin group with TIA or minor 
stroke had a disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke vs 23 of 5726 in the control group, HR 0·07, 95% CI 0·02–0·31, p=0·0004; 
at 0–6 weeks, 14 vs 60 participants, 0·19, 0·11–0·34, p<0·0001). The eff
 ect of aspirin on early recurrent ischaemic stroke 
was due partly to a substantial reduction in severity (mRS shift analysis odds ratio [OR] 0·42, 0·26–0·70, p=0·0007). 
These eff
 ects were independent of dose, patient characteristics, or aetiology of TIA or stroke. Some further reduction in 
risk of ischaemic stroke accrued for aspirin only versus control from 6–12 weeks, but there was no benefi
 t after 12 weeks 
(stroke risk OR 0·97, 0·84–1·12, p=0·67; severity mRS shift OR 1·00, 0·77–1·29, p=0·97). By contrast, dipyridamole 
plus aspirin versus aspirin alone had no eff
 ect on risk or severity of recurrent ischaemic stroke within 12 weeks (OR 0·90, 
95% CI 0·65–1·25, p=0·53; mRS shift OR 0·90, 0·37–1·72, p=0·99), but dipyridamole did reduce risk thereafter (0·76, 
0·63–0·92, p=0·005), particularly of disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke (0·64, 0·49–0·84, p=0·0010). We pooled data for 
40 531 participants from three trials of aspirin versus control in major acute stroke. The reduction in risk of recurrent 
ischaemic stroke at 14 days was most evident in patients with less severe baseline defi
 cits, and was substantial by the 
second day after starting treatment (2–3 day HR 0·37, 95% CI 0·25–0·57, p<0·0001). 
Interpretation Our fi
 ndings confi
 rm that medical treatment substantially reduces the risk of early recurrent stroke 
after TIA and minor stroke and identify aspirin as the key intervention. The considerable early benefi
 t from aspirin 
warrants public education about self-administration after possible TIA. The previously unrecognised eff
 ect of aspirin 
on severity of early recurrent stroke, the diminishing benefi
 t with longer-term use, and the contrasting time course of 
eff
 ects of dipyridamole have implications for understanding mechanisms of action.

Introduction
The risk of recurrent stroke is up to 10% in the week after 
a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke.1–4 
Urgent medical treatment seems to reduce that risk by as 
much as 80%,5,6 but many patients delay seeking medical 
attention, often for several days or weeks, even when they 
make 
a 
correct 
self-diagnosis.7,8

have decreased delays to presentation after major stroke,9,10 
but there has been little improvement in presentation rates 
after TIA or minor stroke (appendix p 1).11 In a recent 
population-based study in the UK, half of recurrent strokes 
in the days after a TIA occurred prior to medical attention 
being sought for the initial event,11 and the situation is 
likely to be worse in many parts of the developing world in 
which access to emergency services is poor.
Antithrombotic treatment is important in the immediate 
management of most acute ischaemic vascular events.12,13 
Since aspirin is available in many house 
holds, public 
education materials recommend self-administration by 
patients who develop acute chest pain, in addition to 
seeking immediate medical attention.14,15 Prehospital 
self-administration of aspirin is discouraged after stroke15 
because of concerns about possible intracerebral 
haemorrhage. However, haemor 
rhage is a rare cause of 
TIA symptoms and it accounts for less than 5% of minor 
strokes.16,17 Although public education should continue to 
persuade people with transient neuro 
logical symptoms to 
seek medical attention immediately, where this is possible, 
self-administration of aspirin after tran 
sient unfamiliar 
symptoms might also be appropriate, particularly in rural 
settings or in less developed countries where access to 
medical services will be delayed.
There are, however, few published data from randomised 
trials for the eff
 ect of aspirin on risk of early recurrent 
stroke after TIA and minor stroke, and no data for its eff
 ect 
on severity; evidence of apparently major benefi
 ts of urgent 
medical treatment generally comes only from obser-
vational studies.5,18 Randomised trials of aspirin versus 
placebo in longer-term secondary prevention showed only 
a 13% relative reduction in risk of recurrent stroke with 
aspirin.12,13,19 Trials of short-term treatment of hospitalised 
acute stroke also reported a 13% reduction in the 4 week 
risk of recurrent stroke or intracerebral haemorrhage, but 
the eff
 ect of aspirin on risk or severity of recurrence after 
more minor stroke was not reported.20–22 Yet, observational 
studies suggest potentially substantial early benefi
 ts of 
aspirin after TIA or minor stroke. In the EXPRESS study, 
urgent treatment with antiplatelet drugs, blood pressure-
lowering drugs, and statins reduced the early risk of stroke 
by 80%;5,6 much of this decrease was hypothesised to have 
been due to aspirin.5 Severity of recurrent cerebral events 
was also reduced in EXPRESS (appendix p 2), which might 
also have been due to aspirin.
In the absence of published randomised evidence of the 
eff
 ect of aspirin on risk and severity of early recurrent 
stroke after TIA and minor stroke, we reanalysed individual 
patient data and reviewed original paper records on early 
outcomes from all available trials of aspirin versus placebo 
in secondary prevention after TIA or ischaemic stroke. To 
inform on possible mechanisms of action, we also aimed 
to study the time course of the interaction between eff
 ects 
of aspirin and dipyridamole in secondary prevention of 
stroke. Aiming to more reliably estimate the very early 
time course of onset of eff
 ects of aspirin, we also studied 
risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke in trials of aspirin in 
treatment of acute stroke, stratifi
 ed by severity of the pre-
randomisation neurological defi
 cit.
Methods

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Previous systematic reviews of randomised trials of aspirin versus 
placebo in secondary prevention after transient ischaemic attack 
(TIA) or ischaemic stroke reported only a 13% relative reduction 
in risk of recurrent stroke. Systematic reviews of trials of aspirin in 
treatment of hospitalised patients with acute stroke also reported 
a 13% reduction in the short-term risk of recurrent stroke or 
intracerebral haemorrhage. Yet, observational studies have 
suggested much more substantial benefi
 ts of urgent medical 
treatment after TIA or minor stroke, with the early risk of 
recurrent stroke reduced by as much as 80%, and a possible 
reduction in severity of stroke. The time course of benefi
 t of 
aspirin had not been studied in randomised trials or in any 
subsequent systematic reviews. Therefore, we did a pooled 
analysis of individual patient data from all available trials of 
aspirin versus control after TIA or ischaemic stroke.
Added value of this study
Our analyses of data from trials of aspirin in secondary 
prevention after TIA and ischaemic stroke show that the eff
 ect 
of aspirin on risk of early recurrent events has been 
underestimated. We show substantial reductions in the early 
risk of all stroke, ischaemic stroke, and acute myocardial 
infarction. We also found that a major part of the early benefi
 t 
of aspirin was due to a previously unrecognised reduction in 
severity of early recurrent ischaemic stroke, resulting in 
80–90% reductions in the early risk of disabling or fatal 
recurrent ischaemic stroke after TIA and minor stroke. 
Although these trials recruited few patients in fi
 rst few days 
after TIA or stroke, we found similar reductions in risk of 
recurrent ischaemic stroke with aspirin in trials of acute 
ischaemic stroke.
Interpretation of all available evidence
Urgent medical treatment substantially reduces the risk of 
early recurrent stroke after TIA and minor stroke and early 
use of aspirin is the key intervention. Medical services should 
give aspirin as soon as possible and public education should 
be aimed at self-administration after unfamiliar transient 
neurological symptoms suggestive of threatened stroke.

antiplatelet drug) versus no antiplatelet or anticoagulant 
in the secondary prevention of stroke and other vascular 
events; patients with acute ischaemic stroke to regular 
aspirin (any dose) versus no aspirin, in the presence or 
absence of another antithrombotic treatment, for acute 
treatment and prevention of early recurrence; or patients 
with TIA or ischaemic stroke to regular dipyridamole 
(any dose) versus no dipyridamole (in the presence or 
absence of another antiplatelet drug) in the secondary 
prevention of stroke and other vascular events. With 
searches done up to Jan 31, 2016, PMR identifi
 ed trials 
through searches of the Antithrombotic Trialists’ (ATT) 
Collaboration,13,23 subsequent systematic reviews, and the 
Cochrane Collaboration.24,25 In view of the historical 
nature of the trials, no additional searches were made for 
ongoing trials or abstracts presented at meetings.
For all eligible trials of aspirin or dipyridamole in 
secondary prevention after TIA or stroke, we sought to 
obtain individual patient data. If these were not available, 
published data on vascular events were extracted from 
trial reports. Data were obtained on the following baseline 
variables: randomised treatment allocation, age, sex, prior 
diabetes, current smoking, history of hyper 
tension, blood 
pressure at entry, time from most recent cerebrovascular 
event to randomisation, nature of the most recent 
cerebrovascular event prior to randomisation (TIA; 
“minor” or non-disabling stroke; “major” or disabling 
stroke), and premorbid disability (modifi
 ed Rankin Scale 
[mRS] score). Data were also obtained on the nature and 
timing of the following outcome variables: any recurrent 
stroke, recurrent ischaemic stroke, acute myocardial 
infarction, intra 
cerebral haemorrhage, fatal extracranial 
bleeding, and cause of any other deaths. If available, from 
either electronic or paper records, data were obtained on 
the severity and outcome of all recurrent strokes (mRS 
score). There were minor diff
 erences in defi
 nition of 
recurrent stroke between trials, but designations made in 
the original trials were not changed.
For trials of aspirin in treatment of major acute stroke, 
we also sought to obtain individual patient data on the 
severity of stroke at entry (eg, a severity score or other 
measure of the extent on the baseline neurological 
defi
 cit) and on time to fi
 rst recurrent ischaemic stroke 
during the trial period. In one small trial,26 only data for 
progression of stroke were collected (defi
 ned as a 
worsening of at least 2 points on the Scandanavian 
Stroke Progression Scale27). In the absence of any other 
data, this outcome was included for completeness.
Statistical analysis 
All analyses were by intention to treat based on the 
randomised treatment allocation. In the secondary 
prevention trials, we calculated the eff
 ects of aspirin 
versus control and dipyridamole versus control, with 
stratifi
 cation by time from randomisation (0–6 weeks, 
6–12 weeks, and >12 weeks), for the following outcomes: 
recurrent ischaemic stroke, disabling or fatal recurrent 
ischaemic stroke, any recurrent stroke, any fatal stroke, 
intracerebral haemorrhage, and acute myocardial 
infarction. For each outcome, we calculated odds ratios 
(OR) for each trial and pooled estimates by fi
 xed-eff
 ects 
meta-analysis (Mantel-Haenszel-Peto method) if there 
was no signifi
 cant heterogeneity (χ² test) between trials. 
In the absence of signifi
 cant heterogeneity, we pooled 
individual patient data and generated Kaplan-Meier 
curves (1–proportion free of event) for time to fi
 rst 
event. Statistical signifi
 cance of any eff
 ect of randomised 
treatment allocation was determined using the log-rank 
test stratifi
 ed by trial and hazard ratios (HRs) and 
95% CIs were generated for events up to 12 weeks 
follow-up using Cox proportional hazards models 
stratifi
 ed by trial (the assumption of proportional 
hazards was violated if events after 12 weeks were 
included). We compared the severity of early recurrent 
strokes between treatment groups based on mRS scores 
with ordinal regression (mRS shift) analysis. The 
assumption of proportional odds was assessed with the 
score test and was valid (p>0·3) for all analyses. 
However, we also calculated ORs for the traditional 
single cutoff
  point of an mRS score of higher than 2. 
Stratifi
 ed analyses of the preventive eff
 ect of treatment 
on recurrent ischaemic stroke and on disabling or fatal 
recurrent ischaemic stroke were also done for the 
following potential eff
 ect modifi
 ers: dose of aspirin 
(<100 mg [low] vs ≥300 mg [high]), TIA or minor stroke 
only versus major stroke (usually defi
 ned as the 
presence of residual neurological signs) at baseline; 
time from last TIA or minor stroke to randomisation 
(≤14 days vs >14 days), age (<65 years vs 65–74 years vs 
≥75 years), sex, diabetes, current smoking, and 
hypertension (prior diagnosis or blood pressure 
≥160/90 mm Hg at baseline assessment vs none).
In trials of aspirin for acute stroke, we determined 
the eff
 ect of aspirin versus control on risk of recurrent 
ischaemic stroke. Trials diff
 ered in duration of 
randomised treatment allocation (appendix p 3). To 
maximise comparativeness between the trials, we fi
 rst 
determined the eff
 ect of aspirin up to day 14 after 
randomisation, stratifi
 ed by the severity of the stroke 
at the baseline assessment. In the two largest trials, 
data for the extent of baseline neurological defi
 cit had 
been collected in the same way, with documentation of 
the presence or absence of neurological defi
 cits of the 
following types: face, arm or hand, leg or foot, 
dysphasia, visuospatial, brainstem or cerebellar, 
hemianopia, and other. We quantifi
 ed the severity of 
stroke as follows: mild (≤2 defi
 cits), moderately severe 
(3–4 defi
 cits), and severe (≥5 defi
 cits). A third smaller 
trial had quantifi
 ed baseline severity of stroke using 
approximate quartile categories of the Scandinavian 
Stroke Progression Scale27 score (<9, 10–11, 12–13, and 
14–25). The distribution of severity that most closely 
matched that in the other two trials was: mild (<9), 
moderately 
severe 
(10–14), 
or 
severe 
(14–25).

We calculated ORs for the eff
 ect of aspirin on the 
14 day risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke for each trial, 
with stratifi
 cation by severity of initial stroke. Pooled 
estimates were obtained by fi
 xed-eff
 ects meta-analysis 
(Mantel-Haenszel-Peto method) if there was no 
signifi
 cant heterogeneity (p>0·05 on χ² test) between 
trials, or otherwise by random-eff
 ects meta-analysis. 
To determine the time course of onset of eff
 ect of 
aspirin in the acute phase, we did a pooled analysis, 
stratifi
 ed by time from randomisation to recurrent 
ischaemic stroke (days 0–1, 2–3, 4–6, 7–14, and ≥15). 
This analysis covered the full period of randomised 
treatment allocation in the trials and was done both 
with and without the patients in the International 
Stroke Trial (IST)20 who had been taking aspirin prior 
to randomisation. Prior aspirin use was an exclusion 
criterion in the smaller trial26 and was rare in the 
Chinese Acute Stroke Trial (CAST).21

Results
We identifi
 ed 12 trials of 15 778 participants that assessed 
aspirin versus control in secondary prevention after TIA 
or ischaemic stroke (appendix p 3). Data for recurrent 
vascular events within 12 weeks of randomisation were 
available for all these trials. 11 trials included 
com 
parisons of aspirin alone versus placebo, and three 
trials included comparisons of aspirin plus dipyridamole 
versus no aspirin.
Among 9635 participants in the 11 trials of aspirin 
only versus control, aspirin reduced the 6 week risk of 
recurrent ischaemic stroke by about 60% (HR 0·41, 
95% CI 0·30–0·56; p<0·0001; table 1), with a similar 
eff
 ect at 12 weeks (table 1) and no heterogeneity between 
trials (phet=0·85; appendix p 5). Inclusion of data from 
the three additional trials for comparisons for aspirin 
plus dipyridamole versus no aspirin (ie, any aspirin) did 
not change the result (HR 0·42, 95% CI 0·32–0·55, 
p<0·0001; table 1). Benefi
 t was greatest at 0–2 weeks 
(fi
 gure 1), but further benefi
 t accrued up to 12 weeks 
follow-up (table 1, fi
 gures 1, 2).
Aspirin also reduced the severity of recurrent ischaemic 
stroke during the 6 weeks after randomisation (fi
 gure 3), 
with a similar eff
 ect seen at 12 weeks and when analyses 
were based only on an mRS score higher than 2 (fi
 gure 3). 
Consequently, aspirin reduced the 6 week risk of 
disabling or fatal (mRS score >2) ischaemic stroke by 
about 70% (table 1; phet=0·91) and the risk of very severe 
(mRs score 4–6) ischaemic stroke by about 75% 
(26 of 8452 participants in active group had an event vs 
92 of 7326 in control group; HR 0·25, 0·16–0·39, 
p<0·0001), but had less eff
 ect on non-disabling (mRs ≤2) 
stroke (48 of 8452 participants had an event vs 65 of 7326; 
HR 0·64, 0·44–0·93, p=0·020). Benefi

accrue for risk of disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke up to 
12 weeks follow-up (table 1, fi
 gures 1, 2), but the greatest 
reduction was seen within the fi
 rst 2 weeks, particularly 
in patients presenting with TIA and minor stroke (two of 
6691 participants in the aspirin group with TIA or minor 
stroke had a disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke vs 23 of 
5726 in the control group, 95% CI HR 0·07, 0·02–0·31, 
p=0·0004; fi
 gure 1).
Aspirin also reduced the early risks of any recurrent 
stroke, fatal stroke, and acute myocardial infarction 
(table 1). There was no increase in the 12 week risk of 
intracerebral haemorrhage on low-dose aspirin versus 
control (three of 4125 participants in active group had an 
event vs fi
 ve of 4137 in the control group), but there was a 
trend towards higher risk for high-dose aspirin compared 
with control (fi
 ve of 4297 vs one of 3159; HR 3·68, 95% CI 
0·43–31·51, p=0·23). However, four of the events on 
high-dose aspirin occurred as complications of carotid 
endarterectomy in the UK-TIA Aspirin Trial (three in 
patients assigned to 1200 mg of aspirin and one to 
300 mg). There was only one fatal extracranial bleed 
within 12 weeks of randomisation in any of the trials (on 
aspirin plus dipyridamole in the European Stroke 
Prevention Study [ESPS]-2).
The eff
 ect of aspirin on the 12 week risk of recurrent 
ischaemic stroke was independent of dose and patient 
characteristics (table 2, fi
 gure 1, appendix p 6). In trials 
where data were available (5606 assigned to aspirin vs 4803 
to control), we found a similar eff
 ect on 12 week risk of 
disabling or fatal recurrent ischaemic stroke in patients 
with atrial fi
 brillation at baseline (HR 0·28, 95% CI 
0·08–1·00, p=0·0508) and in those with lacunar stroke 
(data in ESPS-2 only; data not shown). There was also no 
interaction between time from the last TIA or stroke to 
randomisation and the eff
 ect of any aspirin versus control 
on the 12 week risks of ischaemic stroke or of disabling or 
fatal ischaemic stroke (table 2). Aspirin reduced the 
12 week risk of disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke in 
patients recruited fewer than 14 days after their last event 
(HR 0·46, 0·27–0·77, p=0·0035), but there were too few 
patients recruited within 7 days to defi
 ne the eff
 ect of 
treatment during this time.
The absolute risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke fell 
with time from randomisation (pinteraction<0·0001; fi
 gure 2). 
In trials of aspirin only versus control, there was no 
reduction in risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke after 
12 weeks (OR 0·97, 95% CI 0·84–1·12, p=0·67; 
pint<0·0001 for <12 weeks vs >12 weeks), with no 
heterogeneity between trials (appendix p 7). There was 
also no reduction in severity of post-12-week strokes 
(mRS shift OR 1·00, 95% CI 0·77–1·29, p=0·97).
We identifi
 ed eight trials (11 937 participants) of 
dipyridamole versus control (with or without aspirin) in 
secondary prevention after TIA or ischaemic stroke 
(appendix p 3). Three trials with comparisons of aspirin 
plus dipyidamole versus no antiplatelet were included in 
the any aspirin versus control analyses described above. 
Seven trials (9437 participants) included comparisons of 
dipyridamole plus aspirin versus aspirin alone, and one 
trial (6602 participants) also included com 
parisons of 
dipyridamole versus aspirin and dipyridamole versus

control (appendix p 3). Data for recurrent vascular events 
within 12 weeks of randomisation were obtained for all of 
these trials. Adding dipyridamole to aspirin had no eff
 ect 
on the 12 week risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke 
(OR 0·90, 95% CI 0·65–1·25, p=0·53; appendix p 11), 
with no heterogeneity between trials (phet=0·31), and had 
no eff
 ect on severity of recurrent ischaemic stroke within 
12 weeks of randomisation (mRS shift analysis OR 0·90, 
95% 
CI 
0·37–1·72, 
p=0·99). 
However, 
adding 
dipyridamole to aspirin did reduce the risk of recurrent 
ischaemic stroke after 12 weeks (OR 0·76, 95% CI 
0·63–0·92, p=0·005), particularly the risks of disabling or 
fatal ischaemic stroke (0·64, 0·49–0·84, p=0·0010) and 
any disabling or fatal stroke (0·65, 0·51–0·84, p=0·0008). 
Dipyridamole versus control also had no eff
 ect on severity 
of 12 week recurrent ischaemic stroke in the ESPS-2 trial 
(mRS shift analysis for any dipyridamole vs control 
OR 0·98, 95% CI 0·58–1·66, p=0·95; dipyridamole only 
vs control OR 1·11, 0·59–2·09, p=0·74).
Given the small numbers of patients randomised 
within 7 days of their last event in the trials of aspirin in 
secondary prevention after TIA or stroke, we studied the 
time course of risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke in trials 
of aspirin in treatment of acute stroke, in which all 
patients were randomised within 48 h of stroke onset. 
Among 
three 
eligible 
trials 
(40 531 
participants, 
appendix p 8), individual patient data were available from 
the two largest (40 090 participants) and tabular data from 
the smaller trial (441 participants). The eff
 ect of aspirin 
versus control on the 14 day risk of recurrent ischaemic 
stroke diff
 ered in relation to the severity of stroke 
(phet=0·014), as indicated by the extent of the baseline 
neurological defi
 cit (appendix p 9). Aspirin reduced the 
14 day risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke in participants 
with mild neurological defi
 cits at baseline, with a 
consistent eff
 ect across the trials, but had no eff
 ect in 
those with severe defi
 cits at baseline (appendix p 9). In 
participants with moderately severe defi
 cits, there was a 
signifi
 cant overall reduction in risk, but there was 
heterogeneity between trials (appendix p 9). There was no 
interaction (p=0·92) between the eff
 ect of aspirin on 
recurrent ischaemic stroke and randomisation between 
heparin and no heparin in the IST (data not shown). On 
pooled analysis of recurrent ischaemic stroke in patients 
with mild and moderately severe initial defi
 cits, no eff
 ect 
of aspirin was found within the fi
 rst 24 h (fi
 gure 4) after 
randomisation, but risk was reduced by day 2 (HR 0·44,

(21%) participants in IST who had received aspirin during

reduce the risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke in the fi
 rst 
24 h (HR 0·31, 95% CI 0·11–0·85, p=0·020).
Discussion
Our analyses of trials of aspirin in secondary prevention 
after TIA and ischaemic stroke show that the eff
 ect of 
aspirin on early recurrent events has been under-
estimated. We identifi
 ed substantial reductions in the 
early risks of all stroke, ischaemic stroke, and acute 
myocardial infarction with aspirin, with eff
 ect sizes 
greater than those previously reported after unstable 
angina or acute myocardial infarction.23 We also found 
that a major part of the early benefi
 t of aspirin was due to 
an hitherto unrecognised reduction in severity of early 
recurrent ischaemic stroke, resulting in up to a 90% 
reduction in early risk of disabling or fatal recurrent 
ischaemic stroke after TIA and minor stroke.
However, trials of aspirin for secondary prevention 
recruited few patients in the acute phase after TIA or 
stroke. We found no signifi
 cant diminution of the eff
 ect 
in patients randomised early, but acute eff
 ects might 
diff
 er. For example, aspirin had no eff
 ect on death for the 
fi
 rst 3 days after acute myocardial infarction in the ISIS-2 
trial.28 We therefore studied trials of aspirin in treatment 
of acute stroke, aiming simply to estimate the time course 
of onset of eff
 ect of aspirin on risk of recurrent ischaemic 
stroke, with the overall balance of risk and benefi
 t having 
been documented elsewhere.20–22 With use of stratifi
 cation 
by severity of the baseline neurological defi
 cit, we showed 
that in patients with less severe stroke the relative 
reduction in risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke on aspirin 
was similar to that in the secondary prevention trials and 
was evident by the second full day of treatment. Aspirin 
could also have reduced further thrombosis, or related 
processes, in patients with more major stroke, but such 
eff
 ects would probably be less clinically evident in the 
territory of an already large cerebral infarct.
Our results have implications for acute treatment 
after TIA and minor stroke. First, they confi
 rm fi
 ndings 
from previous non-randomised studies for the impact 
of urgent treatment on the early risk of recurrent 
stroke,5,6,18 supporting recommendations for urgent 
assessment of patients. Second, they suggest that most 
of the benefi
 t of urgent treatment in these previous 
multi-intervention studies was simply due to aspirin. 
Therefore, it is essential that patients with TIA or minor 
stroke are not sent home from the emergency 
department with advice to add aspirin to their next 
prescription; they should be treated acutely. Similarly, 
patients who telephone their family doctor or advice 
lines should be told to take aspirin immediately if TIA is 
suspected, in addition to obtaining medical attention. 
Aspirin could also be given by paramedics when they 
assess patients at home. Third, we showed that aspirin 
reduced early recurrent stroke in non-anticoagulated 
patients with atrial fi
 brillation at baseline.
Our fi
 ndings also have implications for the choice of 
antithrombotic treatment early after TIA or ischaemic 
stroke. Most guidelines do not distinguish between the 
early and later phases of secondary prevention and several 
recommend clopidogrel monotherapy or other drugs as 
equal alternatives to aspirin.29,30 Our fi
 ndings suggest that 
treatment in the fi
 rst few days and weeks should include 
aspirin unless some other antithrombotic agent is shown 
to be superior. We found that dipyridamole monotherapy 
was inferior to aspirin in prevention of early recurrent 
stroke, and that addition of dipyridamole to aspirin did not 
enhance the eff
 ects of aspirin on risk or severity of early 
recurrent ischaemic stroke. Clopidogrel plus aspirin does 
appear to be more eff
 ective than aspirin alone in prevention 
of early recurrent stroke after TIA and minor ischaemic 
stroke,31,32 but has no eff
 ect on severity of stroke,33 and the 
only trial of clopidogrel monotherapy versus aspirin plus 
dipyridamole in this patient group reported data that, in 
light of our fi
 ndings, suggest increased severity of early 
recurrent stroke in the clopidogrel group.34 Indeed, 
although the PROFESS trial showed no diff
 erence in 
overall severity of recurrent stroke on aspirin plus 
dipyridamole versus clopidogrel in secondary prevention 
after TIA and ischaemic stroke,35 our fi
 ndings suggest that 
risk and severity of early recurrent stroke might have been 
reduced by aspirin plus dipyridamole in patients who were 
randomised soon after their initial TIA or stroke, such that 
the early eff
 ects of aspirin would not already be lost after 
prolonged pre-randomisation use. Diminishing benefi
 t of 
aspirin with longer pre-randomisation use would also 
explain why the advantage of aspirin plus clopidogrel 
compared with clopidogrel alone in the MATCH trial was 
only seen in patients randomised early after their TIA or 
stroke,36 and possibly why previous observational studies 
of severity of ischaemic stroke in relation to previous 
aspirin use have yielded confl
 icting results. Similar 
considerations will apply to trials of cilostazol, ticagrelor, 
and future novel anticoagulants in secondary prevention of 
stroke. In fact, survival curves in trials of aspirin versus 
cilostazol suggest that aspirin is superior for the fi
 rst 
3 months, but cilostazol is more eff
 ective thereafter.37,38 
Future trials of new antiplatelet or antithrombotic drugs in 
prevention of early recurrent stroke should report data for 
severity of stroke and should avoid mixing patients taking 
aspirin with those taking other antiplatelet drugs in the 
comparator arm.
Our fi
 ndings also have implications for public 
education. First, confi
 rmation that urgent treatment after 
TIA and minor ischaemic stroke reduces the early risk of 
disabling or fatal stroke by about 80% highlights the

need to reduce delays in patients seeking medical 
attention. Second, since aspirin is available in many 
house 
holds, consideration should be given to promoting 
self-administration immediately after tran 
sient stroke-
like neurological symptoms, as is recom 
mended for 
people who have acute chest pain.14,15 Intracranial 
haemorrhage is rare in patients with TIA symptoms and 
accounts for less than 5% of minor strokes.16,17 Moreover, 
randomised trials of anti 
thrombotic drugs that have 
included patients with acute intracranial haemorrhage 
have not shown any increase in risk of death or of 
recurrent haemorrhage.39 Similarly, there is no evidence 
that prior aspirin would worsen outcome in the small 
proportion of patients who still subsequently progressed 
to have a major stroke and required thrombolysis or 
thrombectomy.40,41 Indeed, given the substantial reduc-
tions in progression to disabling or fatal early recurrent 
ischaemic stroke that we noted with aspirin, prevention 
of the need for thrombolysis or thrombectomy will be the 
main benefi
 t. Public education should continue to 
persuade people with transient unfamiliar neurological 
symptoms to seek medical attention immediately, where 
this is possible, but self-administration of aspirin would 
also be prudent, particularly in rural settings or in less 
developed countries where access to emergency services 
might be delayed. Some individuals would take an 
aspirin or two unnecessarily, as is the case with non-
cardiac chest pain, but others would benefi
 t.
For longer-term secondary prevention after TIA and 
ischaemic stroke, aspirin had no signifi
 cant eff
 ect on risk 
or severity of recurrent ischaemic stroke after 12 weeks. 
However, early benefi
 t of aspirin was maintained on 
longer-term follow-up, even though no additional benefi
 t 
accrued. More detailed analyses of trials in a broader 
range of secondary prevention settings, and including all 
relevant outcomes, are underway to establish the longer-
term balance of risk and benefi
 t (Rothwell PM, 
unpublished), and new trials should determine the risk 
and benefi
 ts of stopping aspirin. The absence of 
additional benefi
 t after 12 weeks does, however, 
necessitate re-interpretation of trials of long-term 
secondary prevention of stroke with other antithrombotic 
drugs versus aspirin that have shown either no benefi
 t of 
the other drug42 or only a small benefi
 t.43 The inter-
pretation that these drugs are as eff
 ective as aspirin is 
less positive if aspirin is ineff
 ective.
We found no evidence that adding dipyridamole to 
aspirin reduced the risk or severity of early recurrent 
ischaemic stroke. However, dipyridamole plus aspirin 
versus aspirin alone did reduce the risk of later recurrent 
ischaemic stroke and this eff
 ect was particularly marked 
for disabling or fatal events. Further work is required to 
fully understand the nature of this late eff
 ect in the trials 
that we studied here and in the PROFESS trial.35
Our results do have limitations. First, the trials of 
aspirin in secondary prevention were done in the 1980s 
and 1990s. Medical care has since changed, with more 
detailed investigations and more intensive lowering of 
blood pressure and lipids. However, the eff
 ect of urgent 
treatment after TIA and minor stroke that was observed 
in more recent observational studies5,6,18 is very similar to 
that in the previous trials (appendix p 2). Changes in 
medical care would also impact less on the eff
 ectiveness 
of prehospital self-administration. Second, most patients 
in the secondary prevention trials were already beyond 
the very early high risk period after their initial TIA or 
minor stroke when recruited.44 However, delayed 
inclusion is likely to have underestimated the absolute 
reduction in risk of early recurrent stroke, as might the 
absence of a loading dose in the trials of low-dose aspirin, 
but relative risk reductions are likely to be generalisable 
to the acute phase. The absolute reduction in risk of 
ischaemic stroke in the EXPRESS study in which patients 
were treated more acutely was about 8% (number needed 
to treat 12; appendix p 2).5 We did not fi
 nd a reduction in 
recurrent ischaemic stroke during the fi
 rst 24 h in trials of 
aspirin in the acute treatment of major stroke (fi
 gure 4), 
but early deterioration after major stroke is multifactorial 
and recurrent stroke is diffi
  cult to distinguish from 
progression of existing pathological processes. There was 
no evidence of a delay in onset of benefi
 t of acute 
treatment after TIA and minor stroke in observational 
studies in the acute phase.5,6,18 Third, some patients in the 
trials of aspirin in secondary prevention were treated with 
aspirin or other antithrombotic drugs for a short time 
after their initial TIA or stroke, prior to inclusion. 
However, we found no evidence that such treatment 
infl
 uenced the eff
 ect of subsequent randomised 
treatment, either in the SALT trial (appendix p 5), which 
had a short on-treatment run-in, or in the other secondary 
prevention trials (data not shown). However, prior aspirin 
use was associated with benefi
 t within the fi
 rst 24 h in the 
IST trial (appendix p 10). Finally, we did not report data on 
whether non-compliance with trial treatment might 
explain the diminishing longer-term benefi
 t of aspirin. 
However, preliminary analyses show little evidence of this 
(Rothwell PM, unpublished) and compliance was clearly 
suffi
  cient to show the late benefi
 ts of dipyridamole plus 
aspirin versus aspirin alone.
Our fi
 ndings raise questions about the mechanisms by 
which aspirin reduces the risk and severity of early 
recurrent ischaemic stroke and by which eff
 ectiveness 
diminishes with longer-term use. It is unusual for 
preventive treatments to reduce the risk of disabling 
stroke more than non-disabling stroke, which might 
suggest a neuroprotective eff
 ect of aspirin, possibly due 
to prostaglandin-mediated eff
 ects on the micro-
vasculature.45,46 However, the similarly large reduction in 
the early risk of myocardial infarction suggests reversal 
of short-term systemic platelet activation. The loss of 
benefi
 t of aspirin in longer-term use is at odds with the 
maintenance of platelet COX-1 inhibition,47 although 
time-course data on bleeding time are less clear-cut.48 It is 
possible that aspirin is only clinically eff
 ective during

periods when platelets are activated, or that platelets 
adapt to aspirin via upregulation of non-COX-mediated 
pathways, or that gradual acetylation of other proteins 
aff
 ects other important pathways.49
In conclusion, we show the validity of previous non-
randomised studies that reported the considerable impact 
that medical treatment has on the early risk of recurrent 
stroke after TIA and minor ischaemic stroke and we have 
identifi
 ed aspirin as the key component. It is essential 
that aspirin is given to patients with suspected TIA or 
minor stroke immediately. Indeed, a case can be made for 
public education about self-administration after transient 
unfamiliar neurological symptoms. The previously 
unrecognised reduction in severity of early recurrent 
ischaemic stroke by aspirin has important implications 
for clinical guidelines, interpretation of previous and 
future trials, and for understanding mechanism of action. 
More generally, our fi
 ndings highlight the fact that to 
understand the eff
 ects of newer drugs in comparison to, 
or in combination with, older drugs, it is fi
 rst necessary to 
fully understand the eff
 ects of the older drug.
