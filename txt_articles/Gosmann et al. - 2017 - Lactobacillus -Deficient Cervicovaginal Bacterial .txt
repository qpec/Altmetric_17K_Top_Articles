Summary
Elevated inflammation in the female genital tract is associated with increased HIV risk. 
Cervicovaginal bacteria modulate genital inflammation, however their role in HIV susceptibility 
has not been elucidated. In a prospective cohort of young, healthy South African women, we 
found that individuals with diverse genital bacterial communities dominated by anaerobes other 
than Gardnerella were at over 4-fold higher risk of acquiring HIV and had increased numbers of 
activated mucosal CD4+ T cells compared to those with Lactobacillus crispatus-dominant 
communities. We identified specific bacterial taxa linked with reduced (L. crispatus) or elevated 
(Prevotella, Sneathia, and other anaerobes) inflammation and HIV infection and found that high-
risk bacteria increased numbers of activated genital CD4+ T cells in a murine model. Our results 
suggest that highly prevalent genital bacteria increase HIV risk by inducing mucosal HIV target 
cells. These findings may be leveraged to reduce HIV acquisition in women living in sub-Saharan 
Africa.

Introduction
24 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are infected with HIV, with the majority of new 
transmission events occurring following heterosexual sex. Young African women have an up 
to 8-fold increased HIV prevalence compared to young men (UNAIDS, 2014), emphasizing 
the need for a better understanding of the factors in the female genital tract (FGT) that 
influence HIV acquisition.
Elevated inflammation is associated with an increased risk of HIV infection (Masson et al., 
2015), and cervicovaginal bacteria have been shown to impact baseline inflammation in the 
FGT (Anahtar et al., 2015), suggesting a potential role for FGT bacteria in modulating 
acquisition risk. A small number of prospective studies indicate that women with 
cervicovaginal bacteria deficient in lactobacilli, a bacterial genus considered beneficial for 
vaginal health (Spurbeck and Arvidson, 2011), are at higher risk of acquiring HIV (Low et 
al., 2011; Martin et al., 1999; Myer et al., 2005). However, the depth of these studies has 
been limited by the use of Gram-stained vaginal smears to assess the genital bacterial 
composition, and by investigation of sex-worker and clinical cohorts not representative of 
the average healthy female population.
The recent development of high throughput sequencing technologies to characterize the 
human microbiome has significantly improved our understanding of the role of the 
microbiome in diseases such as obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer 
(Marchesi et al., 2016) and HIV-induced AIDS (Handley et al., 2016; Monaco et al., 2016). 
While these studies have focused on the enteric microbiome, less is understood regarding the 
role of the cervicovaginal microbiome in disease susceptibility, particularly in the 
developing world. Additionally, the majority of microbiome studies have focused on bacteria 
while viruses have remained incompletely characterized, particularly in the FGT. Here we 
performed bacterial 16S ribosomal (r)RNA gene and viral shotgun sequencing of 
cervicovaginal microbiota and assessed their role in HIV acquisition in participants of the 
FRESH (Females Rising through Education, Support and Health) study, a prospective cohort 
study of healthy HIV-uninfected black South African women aged 18–23 years, monitored 
with high frequency testing for incident HIV infection. We demonstrated a differential 
association of four distinct bacterial community structures with genital inflammation, 
cervical HIV target cell numbers, and HIV acquisition. We additionally identified specific 
bacterial taxa that were closely associated with genital inflammation and HIV acquisition 
and showed that these same bacteria induced inflammation in in vitro and in vivo models, 
thus establishing their mechanistic potential for directly increasing HIV acquisition.

 Results
South African women have distinct bacterial but not viral cervicovaginal communities
We followed 236 HIV-uninfected women prospectively with a median follow-up time of 336 
days (IQR: 178.5 to 347 days) and a total follow-up time of 198.2 person-years. Despite 
intensive HIV prevention counseling, 31 women acquired HIV while 205 remained HIV-
uninfected with an overall HIV incidence in the FRESH cohort of 8.43 per 100 person-years.
Sequencing of the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene in these 236 individuals 
demonstrated the presence of distinct bacterial community types that, based on composition 
and diversity, clustered into 4 basic groups, which we referred to as “cervicotypes” (CTs). 
Similar to our previous findings in a smaller cohort (Anahtar et al., 2015), 10% of women 
had low diversity communities dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus (CT1, n=23), and 32% 
were dominated by Lactobacillus iners (CT2, n=74) (Fig. 1A). This contrasts with white 
women in developed countries, 90% of whom have Lactobacillus-dominant cervicovaginal 
communities (Ravel et al., 2011). The cervicovaginal bacterial microbiome of the remaining 
58% of FRESH participants consisted of high-diversity communities with low Lactobacillus 
abundance, with either Gardnerella vaginalis dominance (CT3, n=68) or a bacterial genus 
other than Lactobacillus or Gardnerella as the dominant taxon (CT4, n=70). The most 
abundant taxa in CT4 were Prevotella, Gardnerella, Shuttleworthia, Sneathia and 
Megasphaera (Fig. 1A). Principal coordinates analysis confirmed distinct clustering of these 
CT groups (Fig. 1B).
Given the paucity of information regarding the community of viruses (the “virome”) in the 
FGT, we used metagenomic sequencing to characterize DNA and RNA viral populations in 
180 study participants. We identified alphapapillomaviruses and Anelloviridae as the 
predominant eukaryotic viral taxa present in the FGT in this cohort (Fig. 1C). Numerous 
species of Caudovirales, the tailed bacteriophages, were also observed (Fig. 1D). In contrast 
to our findings for bacteria, we identified no distinct viral community structures within our 
cohort, nor did we detect a difference in viral composition among different bacterial 
communities (Fig. 1C, D). In summary, we observed four distinct cervicovaginal bacterial 
community types, the most prevalent ones being characterized by high-diversity and low 
Lactobacillus abundance, and no distinct viral community structures in the study 
participants.
HIV acquisition is increased in women with high-diversity, low Lactobacillus abundance 
FGT bacterial communities
We next examined associations between cervicovaginal bacteria and HIV acquisition. We 
observed a greater than 4-fold increase in HIV acquisition in women with high-diversity, low 
Lactobacillus abundance communities compared to women with L. crispatus dominance 
(CT4: HR=4.03, 95% CI: 1.14 to 14.27, p=0.031, and CT3: HR=4.22, 95% CI: 1.06 to 
16.88, p=0.042) (Fig. 2A). None of the women who acquired HIV had an L. crispatus-
dominant community. Women with CT2 communities were also underrepresented among 
participants who subsequently acquired HIV relative to the uninfected group, while those 
with CT3 and CT4 communities were more prevalent among women who went on to

 become infected (Fig. 2B). The genital bacterial communities of women who subsequently 
acquired HIV were comparable to those of their respective CT group who remained HIV 
negative (Fig. 2C, Fig. S1A), with no acquisition-specific clustering within a CT (Fig. 2D), 
suggesting a similar HIV infection risk for women within the same CT group. In contrast to 
cervicovaginal bacteria, viral taxa identified in this study were not different between women 
who became infected and those who remained uninfected (Fig. S1B).
We next assessed factors associated with different genital bacterial communities in our 
cohort, with particular attention to those that might increase HIV susceptibility (Byrne et al., 
2016; McKinnon and Karim, 2016; Ward and Ronn, 2010) (Table S1). We observed no 
differences between bacterial communities and demographic factors, condom use, frequency 
or type of sexual acts, or number of sexual partners. The use of injectable progestin 
contraceptives (IPCs), a known HIV risk factor in the FRESH cohort, was also similar 
among women with different CTs, which is consistent with our previous finding that 
cervicovaginal bacterial communities did not vary with IPC use (Byrne et al., 2016). 
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) were equally distributed among all groups, except for 
an increase in Chlamydia trachomatis infection from CT1 through CT4 (Table S1). After 
removing all Chlamydia-positive samples from the analysis, HIV acquisition in women with 
CT4 but not CT3 communities was still significantly increased compared to women with L. 
crispatus-dominant communities (HR: 4.41, 95% CI: 1.17 to 16.61, p=0.028) (Fig. 2A). 
Similar results were obtained after adjusting for Chlamydia infection. Collectively, these 
results demonstrate that women with high-diversity anaerobic communities have a more than 
4-fold increase in HIV acquisition compared to women with an L. crispatus-dominant 
cervicovaginal microbiome.
Women with anaerobic FGT bacteria have increased genital HIV target cell numbers and 
Th17-associated cytokines
In most women, HIV infection is established following viral replication in CD4+ T cells 
present in the genital mucosa (Haase, 2011). Activated CD4+ T cells expressing the HIV co-
receptor CCR5 (“HIV target cells”) are not only more prone to infection but also support 
higher degrees of viral replication than resting cells (Meditz et al., 2011; Stevenson et al., 
1990), thus increasing HIV susceptibility (Haase, 2011; Koning et al., 2005). We examined 
the relationship between the bacterial microbiome and HIV target cell numbers in the genital 
tract and observed a 17-fold increase in HIV target cells in the FGT of women with CT4 
versus L. crispatus-dominant communities (Fig. 3A, B; Fig. S2). Consistent with this 
finding, we demonstrated elevated levels of the chemokines MIP-1α and MIP-1β, which 
attract CCR5-expressing cells, in women with high-diversity bacterial communities (Fig. 
3C). We also observed higher concentrations of cytokines and chemokines associated with 
increased HIV acquisition (Masson et al., 2015), such as interleukin (IL)-1α, tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF)-α, IL-8 (Fig. 3D; upper row), IL-12p70, interferon (IFN)-γ, and IL-10 (Fig. 
S3A), which confirmed our previous findings in a smaller cohort (Anahtar et al., 2015). 
Women who went on to become infected with HIV had similar pro-inflammatory cytokine 
levels as those who remained HIV-uninfected within the same CT group. This suggests 
comparable HIV susceptibility among women with similar genital communities (Fig. 3D; 
lower row).

 We further examined cytokines associated with specific T helper (Th) subsets as recent work 
suggests that Th17 cells are the first targets of SIV and HIV infection in the FGT 
(Rodriguez-Garcia et al., 2014; Stieh et al., 2016). While we detected no or little difference 
in Th2-associated cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 between CT groups (Fig. S3B), we 
measured a notable increase in IL-17 and IL-17-inducing cytokines IL-23 and IL-1β in the 
cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) fluid of women with CT3 and CT4 structures (Fig. 3E; Fig. 
S3E). This finding suggested that increased numbers of Th17 cells, the predominant 
producers of IL-17 in the genital mucosa (Gosmann et al., 2014; Stieh et al., 2016), were 
induced in the presence of CT3 and CT4 bacteria. Taken together, these results reveal an 
association of high-diversity genital bacterial communities with increased production of 
local pro-inflammatory cytokines and recruitment and activation of mucosal CD4+ T cells.
Specific bacterial taxa are differentially associated with genital inflammation and HIV 
acquisition
We next investigated whether specific bacterial taxa were associated with genital 
inflammation and HIV infection. We found that L. crispatus and, to a lesser extent, L. iners 
were associated with reduced inflammation as indicated by an inverse correlation with the 
first cytokine principal component (PC1), which explained 51% of the variation in cytokines 
(Fig. 4A, Fig. S3C, D). In contrast, anaerobic taxa were associated with increased 
inflammation, the five taxa most strongly correlated with cytokine PC1 being Megasphaera, 
Clostridium, Prevotella, Atopobium vaginae and Sneathia (Fig. 4A). Consistent with this 
finding, cervical epithelial cells produced higher concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 when co-
cultured with Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia and Prevotella amnii compared to L. 
crispatus (Fig. 4B). To more closely examine bacterial taxa associated with HIV acquisition, 
we identified resolved sequence variants (RSV) from 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Non-iners 
lactobacilli were significantly more abundant in women who remained HIV-uninfected (Fig. 
4C). In contrast, Prevotella melaninogenica, Veillonella montpellierensis, Mycoplasma, 
Prevotella bivia and Sneathia sanguinegens, most of which were associated with increased 
genital inflammation, were all positively associated with HIV acquisition (Fig. 4C). In 
summary, we identified specific bacterial taxa associated with reduced (e.g. L. crispatus) or 
increased (e.g. Prevotella and Sneathia) inflammation and HIV acquisition.
Vaginal inoculation of germ-free mice with anaerobic bacteria increases numbers of 
activated CD4+ T cells in the FGT
To more definitively assess a mechanistic role for these bacteria in inducing increased 
numbers of FGT HIV target cells, we inoculated germ-free mice intravaginally with L. 
crispatus or P. bivia (Fig. 4D, E). We detected higher numbers of activated (CD44+) CD4+ T 
cells in the genital mucosa, but not in the blood, of mice inoculated with P. bivia compared 
to mice that received L. crispatus (Fig. 4E). Mice treated with P. bivia further had increased 
numbers of mucosal CCR5+ CD4+ T cells (Fig. S4A) and showed a trend towards elevated 
genital TNF-α concentrations (Fig. S4B) compared to mice inoculated with L. crispatus. 
Together, these results indicate that specific bacterial taxa may increase HIV infection risk 
by inducing elevated numbers of HIV target cells in the FGT.

 Discussion
Here we presented a comprehensive characterization of the genital bacterial and viral 
microbiome in healthy young women in sub-Saharan Africa, and identified a significant 
association of distinct cervicovaginal bacterial communities and specific bacterial taxa with 
HIV acquisition. The sequencing-based identification of cervicovaginal bacteria and viruses 
provides a substantial advancement over previous prospective studies that used Gram-stained 
vaginal smears (Low et al., 2011; Martin et al., 1999; Myer et al., 2005).
Our results indicate that high-diversity, low Lactobacillus abundance bacterial communities 
in the FGT negatively impact vaginal health by increasing the risk of HIV acquisition. In 
addition, prior studies have reported associations between Lactobacillus-deficient genital 
microbiota and other poor reproductive outcomes such as preterm delivery, late miscarriage 
(Hay et al., 1994; Lamont et al., 2011) and cervicitis (Gorgos et al., 2015). The increased 
rate of HIV acquisition in women with high-diversity, low Lactobacillus abundance bacterial 
communities observed in our study could be explained by the sensing of specific bacterial 
antigens or components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS); we previously demonstrated that 
CT4 communities were enriched in LPS relative to CT1, and that LPS signaling pathways 
were significantly upregulated in cervical antigen-presenting cells of women with high-
diversity communities (Anahtar et al., 2015). This likely results in activation and recruitment 
of HIV target cells to the female genital mucosa. In support of this hypothesis, we show a 
17-fold increase in HIV target cell numbers in the FGT mucosa of women with CT4 vs. CT1 
communities. This finding is further corroborated by the presence of increased numbers of 
activated CD4+ T cells in the genital mucosa of germ-free mice intravaginally inoculated 
with P. bivia compared to mice inoculated with L. crispatus, providing direct evidence of the 
impact of these bacteria on the recruitment of activated CD4+ T cells to the FGT. Increased 
concentrations of Th17-inducing cytokines IL-23 and IL-1β, and of IL-17 in the presence of 
CT3 and CT4 bacteria further indicated the presence of elevated numbers of Th17 cells, 
which are particularly susceptible to HIV infection and have been described as the first cells 
to be infected by lentivirus in the FGT (Christensen-Quick et al., 2016; Stieh et al., 2016). 
While the development of the Th17 subset in human epithelial tissues is not fully 
understood, in murine models, Th17 cells are specifically induced by bacteria in the gut 
(Ivanov et al., 2009). Thus, the bacterial composition of the FGT microbiome may influence 
HIV susceptibility not only by increasing local HIV target cell numbers, but also by 
influencing T helper cell differentiation within the genital mucosa. Whether FGT bacteria 
contribute to shaping mucosal T helper cell subsets will need to be addressed in future 
studies.
Reduced HIV acquisition in women with L. crispatus-dominant communities may be based 
on their ability to impair the growth of inflammatory bacteria and pathogens through the 
production of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide and bactericidal compounds (Spurbeck and 
Arvidson, 2011), thus diminishing inflammation and HIV target cell numbers. Consistent 
with this hypothesis, L. crispatus did not co-exist with the more diverse anaerobic 
communities associated with HIV acquisition. In contrast, L. iners was frequently found in 
CT3 and CT4 communities, and 29% of the women who became infected with HIV had L. 
iners-dominant communities while none had L. crispatus dominance. This observation may

 further be explained by reduced HIV virion diffusion rates in the mucus from women with 
L. crispatus dominated vaginal microbiota compared to women with L. iners dominance 
(Nunn et al., 2015). These findings identify L. crispatus as a Lactobacillus species associated 
with decreased HIV infection and highlight the importance of distinguishing between 
different lactobacilli in the context of HIV susceptibility. Our findings further indicate that 
individuals within a particular CT group are at similar risk of acquiring HIV. This suggests 
that more than half the population of young black South African women is at increased HIV 
infection risk based on the composition of their cervicovaginal microbiome.
The absence of distinct viral signatures in women with different bacterial communities 
suggests a primary role for bacteria in modulating HIV acquisition risk. However, it is 
possible that a greater depth of sequencing, or expansion of viral databases will reveal 
associations that were not observed here. The stability in bacteriophage community structure 
across CT groups further suggests that the observed bacterial communities were not being 
modified by bacteriophage predation, a mechanism that could explain the formation of 
distinct bacterial communities in different individuals.
Clinical studies assessing the efficacy of regimens such as antibiotics and probiotic 
Lactobacillus vaginal suppositories in modifying the genital microbiome of women with 
bacterial vaginosis showed significant recurrence rates (Bradshaw et al., 2012; Woodman, 
2016). Our findings underscore the importance of developing more effective regimens that 
achieve a sustained alteration of the genital microbiome since this could potentially reduce 
HIV acquisition. In this context, strategies targeting specific bacterial taxa associated with 
reduced or increased HIV acquisition may be useful, although the host mechanisms that 
maintain specific microbial communities in the genital tract need to be better understood. 
Our results advance our understanding of the cervicovaginal microbiome as an HIV risk 
factor and demonstrate the importance of considering the microbiome in the development of 
new treatments and preventive strategies to reduce HIV acquisition in young women living 
in sub-Saharan Africa.
Experimental Procedures
Study cohort
Study participants were enrolled in the Females Rising through Education, Support, and 
Health (FRESH) study, a prospective observational study of 18–23 year old HIV uninfected 
women conducted in Umlazi, South Africa. At the time of data analysis, pre-infection 
mucosal samples from 31 women who became HIV-infected, and samples from 205 women 
who remained uninfected were available. The study protocol was approved by the 
Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of the University of KwaZulu-Natal and the 
Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Review Board (2012P001812/MGH). Informed 
consent was obtained following explanation of the nature and possible consequences of the 
study.

 Clinical procedures
Twice per week, participants had a finger prick blood draw for HIV RNA viral load testing 
and every 3 months had a peripheral blood draw and a pelvic exam and completed an HIV 
risk questionnaire administered by a counselor. The pelvic exam involved the collection of 
ectocervical and midvaginal swabs (Catch-All, Epicentre), a cervicovaginal lavage (CVL), 
and an endocervical cytobrush.
Bacterial 16S rRNA V4 gene sequencing
Nucleic acid extracted from cervical swabs was amplified and sequenced as previously 
described (Anahtar et al., 2016), and analysis was performed using MacQIIME.
Definition of cervicotypes
Samples with the relative majority of sequences assigned to the genus Lactobacillus (but not 
Lactobacillus iners) were defined as CT1. Lactobacillus iners was the predominant species 
in CT2, Gardnerella vaginalis in CT3, and CT4 had a dominant bacterial taxon other than 
Lactobacillus, L. iners or G. vaginalis.
Virome sequencing
Sequencing of viral DNA and RNA extracted from CVL fluid was performed as detailed in 
the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing
STI testing was performed by Global Labs, South Africa.
Measurement of cytokines
Cytokine concentrations in CVL fluid were determined using a human cytokine/chemokine 
multiplexed bead assay (Millipore) and human and mouse ELISA (eBioscience, R&D 
Systems).
Flow cytometry
Human and mouse cells were stained with a viability dye (Invitrogen) and labeled with 
monoclonal antibodies as specified in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Samples 
were acquired on a FACS Aria III or LSR II (BD). Data were analyzed using FlowJo Version 
9.8.5 (FlowJo Enterprise).
Detection of Differentially Abundant Bacterial Taxa
Resolved sequence variants (RSV) from 16S amplicons were identified using the dada2 
procedure (Callahan et al., 2016). Differentially abundant taxa were determined using the 
DESeq2 package (Love et al., 2014).
Co-culture of epithelial cells and bacteria
Human endocervical epithelial cells (End1/E6E7, ATCC) were co-cultured anaerobically 
with Lactobacillus crispatus (provided by Dr. David N. Fredricks), Prevotella bivia (ATCC 
29303), Prevotella amnii (CCUG 53648T) or Gardnerella vaginalis (ATCC 14018) for 24 h.

 Mouse experiments
All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Resources at Children’s Hospital 
(ARCH) review committee (protocol # 16-08-3219R). CVL fluid was collected from 6–9 
week old female germ-free Swiss-Webster mice housed according to an out-of-the-isolator 
protocol (Faith et al., 2014), followed by application of 2x108 CFU/mL to the vaginal cavity. 
On the day of harvest, blood, CVL fluid and, after CO2 asphyxiation, the female 
reproductive tract (vagina, cervix) were collected, processed and used for downstream 
analyses.
Statistics
For comparison of continuous data between two and more groups, Mann-Whitney test and 
Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc analyses, respectively, were used. The time to HIV 
acquisition was summarized using Kaplan-Meier curves, and significance was assessed by 
Log-rank test. Fisher’s exact test was performed for comparison of categorical data between 
two or more groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to obtain summary 
measures for the multi-variable cytokine set and performed using FactoMineR package in R. 
Multivariate analysis of cytokine and bacterial data was performed using MaAsLin (https://
huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/maaslin) (Morgan et al., 2012) and the Benjamini-Hochberg 
method to adjust for multiple testing. P values are two-sided and indicated as follows: 
*p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001; ****p<0.0001; n.s.: p≥ 0.05. The analyses were performed 
in Prism 6 (GraphPad) and R Studio.

 Figure 1. Bacterial, but not viral, cervicovaginal community structures are distinct in HIV-
uninfected women
(A) Stacked bar plot indicating the bacterial composition of the cervicovaginal microbiome 
of 236 HIV-uninfected women. Samples were grouped according to 4 cervicotypes (CTs), 
and the alpha diversity is shown below for each sample.
(B) Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plot of the 236 individuals, distinguished by CT.
(C) Normalized reads of alphapapillomaviruses and Anelloviridae detected in CVL fluid, 
grouped by CT (n=180 individuals). Groups were compared using Kruskal-Wallis test. The 
percentage of samples in which the indicated virus was detected is shown below.
(D) Average linkage clustering of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of relative abundances of 
Caudovirales sequences detected in CVL fluid (n=180 individuals). Lines in the plots 
indicate the median and the interquartile range (IQR) of the dataset.

 Figure 2. Cervicovaginal bacteria impact HIV acquisition
(A) Kaplan-Meier curve showing HIV infections in each CT group over time, including or 
excluding individuals with Chlamydia infection. Acquisition curves for CT2 (n=74/65 
individuals), CT3 (n=68/57) and CT4 (n=68/54) were compared with the acquisition curve 
for CT1 (n=23/23). Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test-based p values and Mantel-Haenszel hazard 
ratios (HR) are displayed.
(B) Distribution of CT groups in participants who remained HIV-uninfected (n=205) versus 
those who acquired HIV (n=31), shown as % of total, and the difference in distribution 
between these two groups.
(C) Stacked bar plot indicating the bacterial composition of the cervicovaginal microbiome 
of 31 women who subsequently acquired HIV. Samples were grouped by CT.
(D) Bacterial PCoA plot indicating study participants who acquired HIV (in red, n=31) and 
CT groups for those who remained HIV-uninfected (faded coloring, n=205). See also Figure 
S1 and Table S1.

 Figure 3. High-risk genital bacterial communities are associated with increased HIV target cell 
numbers and pro-inflammatory cytokines
(A) Representative flow cytometry plots to identify HIV target cells isolated from cervical 
cytobrushes. Live T cells (CD45+CD3+) were gated on cells expressing CD4, HLA-DR, 
CD38 and CCR5.
(B) Flow cytometry analysis of HIV target cell numbers in cytobrushes from 169 
individuals, grouped by CT.
(C,D,E) Chemokine and cytokine concentrations in CVL fluid from 219 individuals, 
grouped by CT. The bottom figure panel in (D) further distinguishes between samples of 
women who became infected with HIV and those who remained HIV-uninfected. Lines 
indicate the median and the interquartile range (IQR) of each dataset. Groups were 
compared using Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post-hoc analyses. See also Figures S2 and 
S3.

 Figure 4. Specific bacterial taxa are associated with genital inflammation and HIV infection
(A) Bacterial taxa in 219 individuals positively or negatively correlated with cytokine 
principal component 1 (PC1), an indicator of the presence of genital inflammation. Q-values 
reflect corrected p-values after multiple testing.
(B) Cytokine and chemokine concentrations measured in the supernatant of cervical 
epithelial cells co-cultured with the indicated bacteria for 24 h (pooled results from 2–3 
independent experiments; Kruskal-Wallis test).
(C) Bacterial taxa significantly differentially abundant in women who became infected with 
HIV (n=31) and those who remained uninfected (n=205), including two strains of P. bivia. 
Error bars indicate the standard error estimate for the log2 fold change in abundance. (D) 
Germ-free mice were intravaginally inoculated with L. crispatus or P. bivia on day 0 and day 
2 and sacrificed on day 6.
(E) Numbers of activated (CD44+) CD4+ T cells detected in the female genital tract (FGT) 
and in 100 μl blood of the gnotobiotic mice on day 6 of the experiment (pooled results from
