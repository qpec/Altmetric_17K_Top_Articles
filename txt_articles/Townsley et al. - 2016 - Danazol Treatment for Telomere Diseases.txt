Abstract
BACKGROUND—Genetic defects in telomere maintenance and repair cause bone marrow 
failure, liver cirrhosis, and pulmonary fibrosis, and they increase susceptibility to cancer. 
Historically, androgens have been useful as treatment for marrow failure syndromes. In tissue 
culture and animal models, sex hormones regulate expression of the telomerase gene.
METHODS—In a phase 1–2 prospective study involving patients with telomere diseases, we 
administered the synthetic sex hormone danazol orally at a dose of 800 mg per day for a total of 
24 months. The goal of treatment was the attenuation of accelerated telomere attrition, and the 
primary efficacy end point was a 20% reduction in the annual rate of telomere attrition measured 
at 24 months. The occurrence of toxic effects of treatment was the primary safety end point. 
Hematologic response to treatment at various time points was the secondary efficacy end point.
RESULTS—After 27 patients were enrolled, the study was halted early, because telomere 
attrition was reduced in all 12 patients who could be evaluated for the primary end point; in the 
intention-to-treat analysis, 12 of 27 patients (44%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 26 to 64) met the 
primary efficacy end point. Unexpectedly, almost all the patients (11 of 12, 92%) had a gain in 
telomere length at 24 months as compared with baseline (mean increase, 386 bp [95% CI, 178 to 
593]); in exploratory analyses, similar increases were observed at 6 months (16 of 21 patients; 
mean increase, 175 bp [95% CI, 79 to 271]) and 12 months (16 of 18 patients; mean increase, 360 
bp [95% CI, 209 to 512]). Hematologic responses occurred in 19 of 24 patients (79%) who could

 be evaluated at 3 months and in 10 of 12 patients (83%) who could be evaluated at 24 months. 
Known adverse effects of danazol — elevated liver-enzyme levels and muscle cramps — of grade 
2 or less occurred in 41% and 33% of the patients, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS—In our study, treatment with danazol led to telomere elongation in patients 
with telomere diseases. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
NCT01441037.)
Telomeres are repeated hexanucleotides and associated proteins that are located at the ends 
of linear chromosomes; telomeres function to protect the chromosome ends from recognition 
as damaged or infectious DNA.1 The repair of telomeres by the telomerase complex solves 
the “end replication problem” — the otherwise inevitable loss of genetic material with every 
cell division. Telomerase is active during embryogenesis and in proliferating adult tissue — 
for example, in hematopoietic stem cells and immune cells. In individual cells, critical 
shortening of telomeres leads to senescence or apoptosis and, in cells that continue to divide, 
to chromosome instability.2,3
In the telomere diseases, mutations in genes responsible for telomere maintenance and repair 
lead to organ dysfunction, including bone marrow failure, liver cirrhosis, and pulmonary 
fibrosis, as well as to an increased risk of cancer. The hematopoietic cells of patients with 
telomeropathy have very short telomeres, which cause a quantitative defect in stem-cell 
number and a qualitative deficiency in stem-cell regeneration. The term dyskeratosis 
congenita refers to the childhood syndrome of marrow failure with the dermatologic triad of 
leukoplakia, skin rashes, and dystrophic nails. Telomere diseases include not only 
dyskeratosis congenita but also aplastic anemia, pulmonary fibrosis, and liver cirrhosis, in 
isolation or in combination, all of which result from mutations in telomere repair and 
shelterin genes; these conditions have highly variable penetrance within affected 
pedigrees.4–8
Male hormones have been used to treat bone marrow failure since the mid-20th century.9–12 
Considerable evidence suggests that sex hormones directly regulate telomerase.13,14 We 
have previously shown that human lymphocytes and CD34+ hematopoietic cells up-regulate 
both telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene expression and telomerase enzymatic 
activity in response to androgens in vitro.15 Recently, treatment with male hormones was 
shown to lead to hematologic improvement and telomere elongation in a mouse model of 
telomere dysfunction.16 In a large epidemiologic study, metabolites of testosterone and 
genetic polymorphisms affecting hormone exposure were each linked to leukocyte telomere 
length in almost 1000 healthy men.17 Here, we report the results of a study that was 
designed to assess retardation of telomere loss with androgen therapy in patients with a 
variety of telomere diseases and the effect of androgen therapy in improving blood counts.
Methods
Study Design and Implementation
In our phase 1–2 study, the primary efficacy end point was amelioration of telomere attrition 
with long-term administration of danazol, a synthetic sex hormone with androgenic 
properties; the occurrence of toxic effects of danazol treatment was the primary safety end

 point. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at the National Heart, 
Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and is available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org. There was no commercial support for this study. The authors vouch for the 
completeness and accuracy of the data and analysis and for adherence to the study protocol. 
All patients provided written informed consent.
Blood counts and the results of liver function tests were monitored monthly, and participants 
underwent comprehensive evaluations at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) at baseline 
and at 6, 12, and 24 months after the initiation of danazol treatment. Bone marrow biopsy 
and aspiration were performed before enrollment and at 12 and 24 months. Bone 
densitometry and ovarian, uterine, and testicular ultrasonography were performed at baseline 
and at 24 months. Pulmonary fibrosis was assessed by high-resolution computed 
tomography (CT) of the chest and by pulmonary function testing, which were performed at 
enrollment and at annual clinic visits.
Patients
Patients 2 years of age or older were eligible for enrollment at the NIH Mark O. Hatfield 
Clinical Research Center. The entry criteria included an age-adjusted telomere length at or 
below the first percentile, identified mutations in telomere maintenance and repair genes, or 
both, plus at least one low blood count (hemoglobin level, <9.5 g per deciliter; platelet 
count, <30,000 per cubic millimeter; or neutrophil count, <1000 per cubic millimeter), 
pulmonary fibrosis, or both.
Danazol
Oral administration of danazol (800 mg daily divided into two doses per day) was planned to 
continue for 2 years. The dose was reduced if a patient reported unacceptable side effects, 
and treatment was discontinued entirely if any grade 3 or 4 adverse events attributable to the 
drug occurred. Data on adverse events were collected in accordance with the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.
Telomere Measurement and Gene Sequencing
Genomic DNA was purified from peripheral-blood leukocytes within 24 hours after 
collection with the use of the automated Maxwell 16 Instrument (AS2000, Promega). 
Telomere length was determined with a semiautomated, Clinical Laboratory Improvement 
Amendments (CLIA)–approved real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay performed in 
triplicate and validated for human cells, as described previously.18–20 In a subgroup of 
patients, telomere length was also measured by flow fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(flow-FISH) with the use of the Dako telomere PNA kit in accordance with the 
manufacturer’s protocol. For further details, see the Supplementary Appendix, available at 
NEJM.org.
End Points
The primary aim of the study was to determine whether the attrition of telomeres could be 
slowed by completion of a 24-month course of danazol in patients with accelerated telomere 
loss of genetic origin. As compared with the normal rate of telomere loss of approximately

 60 bp per year,21–24 the telomere attrition rate in patients with telomerase gene mutations is 
conservatively estimated at approximately 120 bp per year24 (Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Biologic improvement was defined on the basis of the sensitivity of telomere 
length assays: we could reliably detect a 20% reduction in telomere attrition, to 96 bp per 
year or less, which was the primary biologic end point. An annual rate of change was 
calculated from telomere length measurements that were obtained at 24 months and 
compared with baseline pretreatment values. The primary safety end point was the 
occurrence of toxic effects over the 24 months of treatment with high-dose danazol. The 
secondary efficacy end point was a hematologic response at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, which 
was defined as an increase in hemoglobin level of 1.5 g per deciliter or more (or no further 
need for transfusions or a reduction in the number of transfusions of >50%), an increase in 
platelet count of 20,000 per cubic millimeter or more, or an increase in neutrophil count of 
500 per cubic millimeter or more, as compared with baseline. The other secondary end 
points were relapse, development of myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia, 
progression of pulmonary fibrosis, and survival.
Statistical Analysis
The primary efficacy end point, biologic response at 24 months, was defined as a reduction 
in the telomere length attrition rate to 96 bp per year or less. The sample size was calculated 
for testing the null hypothesis that the 24-month rate of biologic response (the primary end 
point) would be 10% or less versus an alternative response rate of 30%. We calculated that 
with a sample size of 25, the study would have 80% power to test the null hypothesis, at a 
5% significance level, with the use of a two-sided binomial test for proportions. The primary 
end point was analyzed with the use of the intention-to-treat principle by designating all 
patients who withdrew from the study before 24 months as not having had a response to 
treatment. To account for early withdrawals and allow for a sufficient number of patients 
who could be evaluated for secondary end points while maintaining statistical power for the 
primary end point, an upper sample-size limit of 35 patients was adopted. The rules 
regarding stopping the study for safety were based on an unacceptable frequency of severe 
adverse events.18 There were no stopping rules for efficacy, but the NHLBI institutional 
review board required annual review of primary and secondary end-point data. Summary 
statistics, including proportions, means, standard deviations, and confidence intervals, were 
used to describe the primary and secondary end points. Changes in all the variables included 
in the secondary analyses that occurred between time points were calculated for patients for 
whom measurements were available. Statistical inferences with regard to the mean changes 
in the secondary end points were described with 95% confidence intervals and Student’s t-
test for the null hypothesis of zero means.

 the patients was 41 years (range, 17 to 66), and 15 patients (56%) were female (Table 1). A 
total of 10 patients had mutations in TERT, 7 had mutations in TERC (the telomerase RNA 
component), 3 had mutations in DKC1 (dyskeratosis congenita 1), and 1 had a mutation in 
RTEL1 (the regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1) (Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Six patients had leukocyte telomere lengths below the first percentile and a 
suggestive clinical phenotype, but they did not have an identifiable pathogenic mutation 
(Table S2 and Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Eleven patients required regular 
transfusions of packed red cells, and 2 patients required regular transfusions of both red cells 
and platelets. The majority of patients (85%) had a family history suggestive of telomere 
disease,3 and 6 patients had early graying of hair (Table 1, and Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Telomere Attrition
In April 2015, a total of 11 of the first 12 patients evaluated at 24 months were found to have 
consistent telomere elongation. In view of the unanticipated high level of efficacy that was 
achieved and the fact that there was sufficient information to reject the null hypothesis, the 
study was closed early by the NHLBI institutional review board.
All the patients who could be evaluated met the primary efficacy end point of reduction in 
the telomere attrition rate at 24 months as specified in the protocol (Fig. 1A); in the 
intention-to-treat analysis, the response rate was 12 of 27 (44%; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 26 to 64). In exploratory analyses, the telomere length of peripheral-blood leukocytes 
at enrollment was compared with the telomere length after 6 months and 12 months of 
danazol administration; in addition, in a subgroup of 8 patients, measurements of telomere 
length at 30 months and 36 months (6 months and 12 months, respectively, after perprotocol 
discontinuation of danazol therapy) were compared with baseline measurements taken at 
enrollment (Fig. 1B and Table 2). Elongation of telomeres was found at all time points 
during danazol administration in patients who could be evaluated: 16 of 21 patients (76%) at 
6 months, 16 of 18 (89%) at 12 months, and 11 of 12 (92%) at 24 months. The mean 
increase in telomere length as compared with baseline was 175 bp (95% CI, 79 to 271) at 6 
months, 360 bp (95% CI, 209 to 512) at 12 months, and 386 bp (95% CI, 178 to 593) at 24 
months (which was the time point used for the evaluation of the primary end point) (Fig. 1B 
and Table 2). A similar pattern of telomere elongation was confirmed by qPCR of flow-
sorted lymphocytes and by flow-FISH (Fig. S4A and S4B and Table S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Among the 8 patients who discontinued treatment per protocol at 
24 months and had leukocyte telomere length measured at 6 months and 12 months after 
cessation of danazol treatment, the mean decrease in telomere length relative to the 
measurement obtained at 24 months of treatment was 135 bp at 6 months and 333 bp at 1 
year after discontinuation of treatment (Fig. 1B and Table 2). Although we did not test the 
significance of the observation, telomere elongation was greater among patients with TERT 
mutations than in the group with unidentified mutations, and the smallest amount of 
elongation was found in the group with TERC and DKC1 mutations (Table S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).

 Hematologic Responses
Danazol therapy led to a hematologic response in 19 of 24 patients (79%) who could be 
evaluated at 3 months, in 17 of 21 patients (81%) at 6 months, in 14 of 18 patients (78%) at 
12 months, and in 10 of 12 patients (83%) at 24 months (Fig. 2). Before danazol 
administration, 13 patients were transfusion-dependent; after treatment, all but 1 patient no 
longer required regular transfusions. Among the 14 patients who had hemoglobin levels 
lower than 9.5 g per deciliter at enrollment, we found a mean increase of 3.3 g per deciliter 
(95% CI, 2.1 to 4.4) and a mean increase in absolute reticulocyte count of 41,300 per cubic 
millimeter (95% CI, 25,320 to 57,280) at 1 year (Fig. 3, and Table S5 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Neutrophil counts also increased, by a mean of 300 per cubic millimeter (95% 
CI, 124 to 476), and platelet counts increased by 14,250 per cubic millimeter (95% CI, 4880 
to 23,620). To date, 10 of the 12 patients who could be evaluated after 2 years of danazol 
therapy have had a hematologic response (Fig. 2). Danazol treatment was discontinued in all 
patients at 2 years; 5 patients’ blood counts then declined, but they improved with the 
reinstitution of danazol treatment “off protocol” by their treating physicians (Fig. 3).
Lung Fibrosis
Pulmonary fibrosis scores based on CT25 were stable during the 2 years of treatment in all 
patients except Patient UPN9, who died of an acute exacerbation of pulmonary failure in 
association with viral pneumonia. The most prevalent abnormality was a defect in the 
diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), which was present in 25 of 27 
patients, with a mean DLCO (adjusted for hemoglobin) of 55% of the predicted value 
(range, 26 to 94%). In the 7 patients for whom results of pulmonary function tests before 
danazol administration were available, the adjusted DLCO measured at least 6 months 
before entry into the study had declined from a mean of 55% of the predicted value to a 
mean of 44% of the predicted value at the time of entry (P = 0.01 by paired t-test), whereas 
during danazol administration there was no significant decrease in lung function (Fig. S3 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Adverse Events and Missing Data
Data were missing for five patients at 24 months as a result of the study being halted early 
(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Data from earlier time points for these five 
patients were available for the evaluation of secondary end points.
Ten patients withdrew from the study before 2 years (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix): two patients discontinued treatment because of low-grade side effects, three 
discontinued after a grade 3 or grade 4 adverse event, two withdrew without a stated reason, 
two proceeded to receive alternative therapy, and one died from organ failure (pulmonary 
fibrosis). The most common adverse events were elevations in liverenzyme levels (in 41% of 
the patients), muscle cramps (in 33%), edema (in 26%), and lipid abnormalities (in 26%) 
(Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). Liver fibrosis measurements obtained by means 
of ultrasonic transient elastometry (FibroScan)26 were available at baseline and at 24 months 
for four of six patients who had cirrhosis at baseline; fibrosis had been alleviated 
substantially in three patients and had worsened in one (UPN16) in association with 
continued alcohol abuse.

 Three patients had progression of their disease during treatment with danazol: Patient UPN9 
had severe pulmonary fibrosis at baseline and died at 10 months from acute respiratory 
failure, Patient UPN21 had moderate aplastic anemia that advanced to a severe form of the 
condition, and Patient UPN15 underwent portosystemic shunting with acute worsening of 
liver function. Marrow cytogenetic abnormalities appeared in two patients, without 
morphologic evidence of myelodysplastic syndrome: Patient UPN6, who had a hematologic 
response, had the cytogenetic abnormality trisomy 21 detected at 1 year of treatment; Patient 
UPN16, who also had a hematologic response, had duplication of chromosome arm 1q. 
Patient UPN7 had a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome at enrollment, with a 
hypercellular marrow with trilineage dysplasia and normal karyotype, diagnostic of 
myelodysplastic syndrome (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix); at 1 year, deletion of 
chromosome arm 20q developed, occurring in 2 of 20 metaphases, without changes in bone 
marrow myeloblast percentage or dysplasia. All three patients continued to have a 
hematologic response to treatment.
Discussion
In this prospective clinical study involving patients with short telomeres, we found an 
increase in telomere length in response to a pharmacologic intervention. In patients with 
telomere disease, administration of male hormones resulted in telomere elongation in 
circulating leukocytes in association with hematologic improvement. Androgens have been a 
therapeutic option for marrow failure syndromes since the 1960s, without a clear mechanism 
for their action.12,27 In retrospect, some patients with a response probably had telomere 
deficits. On the basis of our previous findings of increased telomerase activity in bone 
marrow hematopoietic progenitors cultured in the presence of sex hormones,15 we designed 
this study to evaluate the effects of a synthetic androgen on telomere length and 
hematopoiesis in a cohort of patients with telomeropathy. Since enrollment began for our 
study, case reports28,29 and an observational study11 have described similar effects. The 
single patient carrying a TERT mutation described by Brummendorf and colleagues28 had 
telomere length elongation as well as hematologic improvement in association with 
androgen therapy. Savage and colleagues described hematologic improvement in 11 of 16 
patients with dyskeratosis congenita, mainly children, who received androgens.11
Our study was powered to detect a 30% improvement in telomere attrition after 2 years of 
danazol treatment. Not only was telomere loss prevented by treatment with danazol in our 
patients, but a mean increase of 386 bp telomeric repeats had occurred by study completion, 
with improvement usually observed early during the course of hormone therapy. 
Hematologic improvement in all blood counts accompanied telomere elongation.
Despite these robust results, our study has some limitations. First, mutations were not 
identified in some cases, despite the patients having very short leukocyte telomeres and a 
suggestive clinical phenotype. Heterogeneity in the genetic basis for telomere biologic 
deficiencies may have biased our estimation of telomere attrition. Second, telomere erosion 
can fluctuate with repeated measurements over time.30 A longer period of observation 
before starting danazol would have been desirable to establish a firm baseline for the 
assessment of treatment effects. Third, we used the highest dose of danazol that is currently

 approved for use in humans, but a dose-finding strategy might have allowed identification of 
the minimum effective dose. Fourth, our study was not randomized and did not have a 
control group; this study design was adopted because telomere disease is not common, 
because such strong biologic and clinical effects were unanticipated, and because of ethical 
considerations.
Our in vitro data and studies in mice support a direct effect of hormone therapy on 
telomerase activity by up-regulation of TERT expression.15 This effect is mediated through 
an estrogen-responsive element in the gene promoter and may also explain the longer 
telomeres found in postmenopausal women who have received hormone-replacement 
therapy.31 We were unable to reliably measure telomerase activity, because relevant TERT 
regulation would occur in the hematopoietic stem cells, the numbers of which are severely 
reduced in these patients with marrow failure. Therefore, we cannot rule out other potential 
mechanisms, such as expansion of the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell pool32 or 
effects on bone marrow stroma.33
Male hormones are efficacious in the treatment of inherited bone marrow failure associated 
with telomere dysfunction, producing clinically meaningful hematologic improvement. The 
increase in telomere length seen in patients treated with hormones is consistent with 
hormone-mediated up-regulation of TERT and of telomerase enzymatic activity. Further 
studies are required to assess the effect of treatment on survival or progression to 
myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. Lower doses of danazol or other 
hormone formulations are likely to have better side-effect profiles. Sex hormones may be 
useful in the treatment of other types of accelerated telomere attrition, such as the attrition 
that occurs after chemotherapy34 and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,35 and other 
drugs and small molecules could be screened in vitro for effects on telomerase. Our results 
may have broader relevance for the frequent use of androgens for blood diseases in the 
developing world and for testosterone replacement in aging men in developed countries. 
Longevity has been linked to telomere attrition rates in mammals36; the advantages and risks 
associated with the modification of telomere loss will need to be assessed in attempts to alter 
physiologic aging in humans. Telomere attrition and dysfunction have been implicated in the 
development of cancer in both mice37 and humans.2,38–40 Evolution to myelodysplastic 
syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia has been infrequent in historical studies of androgen 
treatment for bone marrow failure.10 The mitigation of telomere erosion by sex hormones 
may abrogate early molecular steps in chromosome instability and oncogenesis and warrants 
investigation in clinical trials.

 Figure 1. Changes in Telomere Length in Patients Receiving Danazol
Panel A shows the telomere length measured at 24 months (the time point used for 
evaluation of the primary end point) in 12 patients, plotted against each patient’s baseline 
telomere measurement. The points above the dotted line represent patients who met the 
protocol-defined primary efficacy end point, a telomere attrition rate of 96 bp per year or 
less. Data for 15 patients were missing at 24 months; in the analysis of the primary end 
point, these patients were considered as not having had a response. In Panel B, summary 
statistics are shown in box plot format for changes in telomere length at landmark visits, as

 compared with baseline; the line within each box indicates the median, the top and bottom 
edges the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively, and the I bars the range. The light dashed-
and-dotted line represents the anticipated rate of telomere attrition with age in healthy 
persons (60 bp per year),21–24 and the bold dashed line represents the anticipated rate of 
attrition in patients with telomere diseases (120 bp per year).24 All patients who could be 
evaluated had improvements in telomere attrition while receiving danazol. Significant 
telomere elongation was found at 6, 12, and 24 months after the initiation of treatment with 
danazol, as compared with baseline. When treatment with danazol was stopped at 24 
months, a decrease in telomere length was observed at 30 months and 36 months. All 
available data points were used in this analysis.

 Figure 2. Hematologic Response in Patients Treated with Danazol, According to Mutation
For each landmark visit, the hematologic response to danazol is shown, with all patients 
listed according to patient number (UPN) on the left and genomic position of the 
heterozygous telomere gene mutation at right. Mutations were not detected in 6 patients 
despite screening for all known genes that have been reported to be mutated in telomere 
diseases (CTC1, DKC1, NOP10, NHP2, RTEL1, TERC, TERT, WRAP53, TINF2, and 
USB1). No data were available for 15 patients at 24 months: 10 withdrew from the study, 
and 5 had not reached the 2-year time point for evaluation of the primary end point because 
the study was halted early. An asterisk indicates that the pathogenicity was ambiguous; the 
p.Ala1062Thr and p.Glu280Lys variants have allele frequencies of 1.3% and 0.05%, 
respectively, in healthy controls (http://exac.broadinstitute.org/gene/ENSG00000164362).

 Figure 3. Blood Counts in Patients with Telomeropathy Treated with Danazol
Peripheral-blood counts at various time points during the study are shown. Each symbol 
denotes a blood count in one patient; circles denote counts assessed during the period in 
which danazol was administered, and squares denote counts assessed after treatment with 
danazol was discontinued, per protocol, at 24 months. Black symbols denote counts in 
patients with a preexisting abnormally low value in that cell lineage, which was used to 
satisfy the enrollment criterion, and paired t-test results were performed for only these 
patients; gray symbols denote counts in all other patients in the study. The enrollment

*In the analysis of the primary end point, at 24 months, a rate of telomere loss of 96 bp per year or less was found in 12 of 27 patients (44%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 26 to 64; P<0.001 by one-sample 
proportions test with continuity correction for the null hypothesis of a 10% response rate). Data for 15 patients were missing at 24 months; in the analysis of the primary end point, these patients were 
considered as not having had a response.
†The P value is for testing the null hypothesis that the mean change in telomere content would be zero.
‡This time point was used for the primary end point.
§Confidence intervals and P values were not computed when fewer than 10 patients were in the sample.
