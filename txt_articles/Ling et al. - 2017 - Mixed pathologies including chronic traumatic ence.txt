abnormalities in all six post-mortem cases, supportive of a his-
tory of chronic repetitive head impacts. Four cases had patho-
logically confirmed CTE; concomitant pathologies included 
Alzheimer’s disease (N = 6), TDP-43 (N = 6), cerebral amy-
loid angiopathy (N = 5), hippocampal sclerosis (N = 2), cor-
ticobasal degeneration (N = 1), dementia with Lewy bodies 
(N = 1), and vascular pathology (N = 1); and all would have 
contributed synergistically to the clinical manifestations. The 
pathological diagnosis of CTE was established in four individ-
uals according to the latest consensus diagnostic criteria. This 
finding is probably related to their past prolonged exposure 
to repetitive head impacts from head-to-player collisions and 
heading the ball thousands of time throughout their careers. 
Alzheimer’s disease and TDP-43 pathologies are common 
concomitant findings in CTE, both of which are increasingly 
considered as part of the CTE pathological entity in older indi-
viduals. Association football is the most popular sport in the 
world and the potential link between repetitive head impacts 
from playing football and CTE as indicated from our findings 
is of considerable public health interest. Clearly, a definitive 
link cannot be established in this clinico-pathological series, 
but our findings support the need for further systematic inves-
tigation, including large-scale case–control studies to identify 
at risk groups of footballers which will justify for the imple-
mentation of protective strategies.

Abstract In retired professional association football (soccer) 
players with a past history of repetitive head impacts, chronic 
traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a potential neurodegenera-
tive cause of dementia and motor impairments. From 1980 to 
2010, 14 retired footballers with dementia were followed up 
regularly until death. Their clinical data, playing career, and 
concussion history were prospectively collected. Next-of-kin 
provided consent for six to have post-mortem brain examina-
tion. Of the 14 male participants, 13 were professional and 1 
was a committed amateur. All were skilled headers of the ball 
and had played football for an average of 26 years. Concussion 
rate was limited in six cases to one episode each during their 
careers. All cases developed progressive cognitive impairment 
with an average age at onset of 63.6 years and disease duration 
of 10 years. Neuropathological examination revealed septal

traumatic brain injury (rTBI) is now known as chronic trau-
matic encephalopathy (CTE) [32]. CTE has since been 
reported in a range of contact sports, most notably in Ameri-
can football [31]. The clinical features of CTE are variable and 
consist of a combination of mood and behavioural changes, 
memory loss, executive dysfunction, slurred speech, parkinson-
ism, and gait impairment, which typically manifest years after 
the initial rTBI [24, 32]. In some cases, the clinical presenta-
tions may be indistinguishable from frontotemporal dementia 
(FTD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), atypical parkinsonism, and 
cerebellar ataxia [40]. While dementia in older individuals is 
commonly caused by mixed pathologies in particular vascular 
and neurodegenerative diseases [22], in those with a history of 
rTBI, CTE is an additional differential diagnosis, which, at pre-
sent, can only be confirmed by neuropathological examination 
due to the lack of validated clinical diagnostic criteria [30].
Heading the ball is an integral part of association foot-
ball (known as soccer in North America) and may produce 
considerable repetitive impacts to the head [36]. An aver-
age player heads the ball 6–12 times per game and performs 
at least 2000 headers during a 20-year career in addition to 
repetitive heading drills at training [36]. Head injuries in foot-
ball are nevertheless more frequently caused by head-player 
contact (40%, including head, arm, and leg) than head-ball 
contact (12.6%, including accidental heading) [5]. Many head 
impacts in football do not result in concussion and overt neu-
rological symptoms [3, 19, 36], yet are associated with subtle 
neuropsychiatric deficits or changes in functional MRI, and 
are referred as ‘subconcussion’ [31]. Brain structural and 
cognitive changes have been reported in footballers exposed 
to repetitive subconcussive head impacts including heading 
[20, 21, 26, 28, 36, 42, 43]. Since repetitive head impacts can 
be substantial in football [19], their clinical significance as a 
potential cause of subclinical TBI and a risk of later develop-
ment of CTE are of considerable public health interest.
Dementia as a potential late life consequence of play-
ing professional football attracted media attention following 
the death of the 59-year-old West Bromwich Albion centre-
forward, Jeff Astle, who had a 5-year history of progres-
sive cognitive decline and, more recently, lay-press reports 
of dementia in four of the eight surviving footballers in the 
1966 England’s World Cup winning team. The pathological 
substrates of dementia syndrome in retired footballers remain 
elusive with only four post-mortem reports of footballers in 
the literature [4, 13, 14, 31]. In this study, we describe the 
clinical and pathological features of a group of retired profes-
sional footballers who developed dementia in later life.
Methods
Informed consent to participate in this study was obtained 
from each participant or their designated next-of-kin during 
life. The next-of-kin or close surviving relatives provided writ-
ten consent to the publication of the clinical and pathological 
data included in this article. This study was conducted at the 
Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological Studies (QSBB), 
UCL Institute of Neurology, under the ethics approval granted 
by the London Ethics Committee (REC Reference: 02/N093).
Participants
Between 1980 and 2010, 16 consecutive cases of retired 
footballers with progressive cognitive impairment were 
identified at the Old Age Psychiatry Service in Swansea, 
Wales, UK, and were enrolled for clinical surveillance and 
regular out-patient follow-up by a consultant psychiatrist 
(DDRW) until death (Fig. 1). Next-of-kin consented for 14 
to be included in the surveillance and for six to have post-
mortem brain examination. Collateral history, playing career, 
and concussion history from close relatives were prospec-
tively collected. From 2015 to 2016, clinical and other

demographic data were systematically and retrospectively 
collected from review of medical records and interviews of 
close relatives for the present clinico-pathological series.
Neuropathological methods and diagnoses
Neuropathological examination of the brain was initially 
performed at the Department of Cellular Pathology, Car-
diff University (JWN) between year 2005 and 2009. All 
six post-mortem cases had received an original patho-
logical diagnosis of AD. In 2016, tissue blocks of these 
six cases were transferred to the Queen Square Brain 
Bank, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, UK for sys-
temic neuropathological analysis for the present study. 
Eight-µm-thick histological sections were stained using 
routine histological (haematoxylin and eosin, H&E) tech-
nique. Immunohistochemistry using modern antibodies 
to the following proteins was performed using a standard 
avidin–biotin method: tau (AT8 clone; Thermo scien-
tific MN1020; 1:600), 3-repeat tau (Gift from Dr Rohan 
de Silva; 1:150) and 4-repeat tau (Gift from Dr Rohan de 
Silva; 1:750), amyloid-β (Aβ; Biosource international, 
Mouse Dako, clone 6F/3D; 1:100), transactive response 
DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43; monoclonal; clone 
2E2-D3; 1:2000), p62 (BD Transduction Labs; 1:200), 
α-synuclein (Novocastra; 1:50), Iba-1 (Wako; polyclonal 
rabbit 1:1000), and SMI-31 (Biolegend; monoclonal mouse 
1:1000).
A consensus agreement regarding the histological fea-
tures of CTE was reached among two neuropathologists 
(TR, JLH), following the recently published NINDS diag-
nostic criteria [30]. The finding of hyperphosphorylated 
tau accumulation in neurons, astrocytes, and cell processes 
around small blood vessels with predilection to the corti-
cal sulci is mandatory for the diagnosis of CTE [12], which 
is distinct from AD [15], primary age-related tauopathy

(PART) [10], and age-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG) 
[23]. Supportive features of CTE were assessed [30]. Other 
neuropathological diagnoses were made following consen-
sus criteria for AD according to the National Institute on 
Aging-Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) Guidelines [16], 
Lewy body disease (LBD) [7, 33], and corticobasal degen-
eration (CBD) [11].
Brain regions evaluated are summarised in Table 1. 
Briefly, H&E sections were used to assess for hippocampal 
sclerosis, neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, and vascu-
lar pathology in the frontal, temporal and parietal regions, 
striatum, pons, and cerebellum. CTE-type pathologies were 
determined by screening the AT8 sections of the follow-
ing brain regions: frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices, 
hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, midbrain, pons, 
medulla, and cerebellum. Five consecutive 8-µm-thick sec-
tions were prepared from tissue blocks of the frontal, tem-
poral, and parietal cortices to screen for the pathognomonic 
hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation in the cortical sulci 
[30]. The presence of the following additional patholo-
gies was systematically assessed: TDP-43 proteinopathy 
(TDP-43 lesions in frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices, 
hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, and midbrain), 
argyrophilic grain disease [35] (AT8 and p62 immunohis-
tochemical preparations in amygdala and hippocampus), 
C9orf72 expansion-specific p62-positive neuronal cytoplas-
mic inclusions (p62 immunohistochemical preparation in 
the hippocampus and cerebellum), Lewy body pathologies 
using α-synuclein immunohistochemistry (amygdala, mid-
brain, and pons), AD-related Aβ pathologies for Thal phase 
score [41], and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (Aβ immuno-
histochemistry in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices, 
and cerebellum). To determine the level of Alzheimer’s dis-
ease neuropathological change, ABC score was established 
according to the NIA-AA guidelines [16]. Tissue sections of 
frontal white matter, internal capsule, and cerebellar white 
matter were stained with the SMI-31 antibody and reviewed 
for evidence of diffuse axonal injury, except in Case 5, in 
which the SMI-31 section of the frontal cortex was unavail-
able. Iba1 immunohistochemistry was performed to assess 
microglia/macrophage response, except in Case 5, in which 
the IBA1 section of the frontal cortex was unavailable.
Statistical analysis
The SPSS 24.0 statistical package was used. Student’s t test 
was used to compare continuous data.
Results
All 14 retired footballers were male, 13 were professional, 
and 1 was a committed amateur (Case 4). They were all 
recognised as skilled headers of the ball, with half of them 
playing in centre-half or centre-forward positions, where 
heading of the ball is frequent (Table 2). They all began 
playing football regularly in their childhood or early teens 
for an average of 26 years. Concussion was only reported 
in six footballers, limited to a single episode in each during 
their careers. Two participants also boxed as amateurs, one 
of whom served in the military, but none reported any epi-
sodes of concussion during these activities.
All cases developed a progressive dementing illness in 
later life; ten of whom had coexisting motor impairments, 
including parkinsonism (N = 7), gait difficulties or pos-
tural instability with frequent falls (N = 6), and dysarthria 
(N = 3). Behavioural and mood changes were common 
features (N = 12). The average age at symptom onset was 
63.6 years, and disease duration was 10 years. Twelve cases 
died from advanced neurodegenerative disease. Cases 5 
and 10 died of myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke, 
respectively. Substance or alcohol abuse and suicidal idea-
tion were not reported in any cases. Twelve of the 14 cases 
had at least one CT or MR imaging of the brain follow-
ing the onset of their neurological symptoms, and cortical 
atrophy was a consistent finding. Of the two earliest cases 
referred in the early 1980s, one had a normal air encephalo-
gram and the other did not undergo neuroimaging. Cavum 
septi pellucidi was reported in one case (Case 11) on CT 
imaging of the brain performed 1 year after symptom onset, 
aged 68.
Neuropathological findings were available in six cases. 
While the mean age at symptom onset, age at death, and 
duration of football career did not differ between the post-
mortem (Cases 1–6) and clinical (Cases 7–14) groups, the 
mean disease duration of the clinical group was relatively 
longer (11.8 years vs. 7.7 years, P = 0.01). Macroscopic 
brain examination revealed fenestration of the septum in all 
six cases and cavum septi pellucidi in one case (Case 1). 
Histological examination identified the pathognomonic fea-
tures of CTE in four cases, fulfilling the mandatory diag-
nostic criteria of CTE [30], with Cases 2, 5, and 6 showing 
advanced CTE pathologies [32] (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, all 
six cases demonstrated some features supportive of CTE, 
including characteristic tau pathologies, dilatation of third 
ventricle, and septal abnormalities.
All six cases had TDP-43 pathology with sparse to mod-
erate TDP-43-positive dystrophic neurites and neuronal 
cytoplasmic inclusions (NCIs, Fig. 3). Occasional neuronal 
intranuclear inclusions (NIIs) were observed in Case 3. In 
Cases 2 and 3, TDP-43 pathology was restricted to the lim-
bic regions, including the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, sub-
iculum, and dentate gyrus, corresponding to Stage 3 of the 
staging scheme described for TDP-43 distribution in AD 
[18]. In the other four cases (Cases 1, 4, 5, and 6), TDP-
43 pathology was more extensively distributed, involving

regions, such as the striatum, substantia nigra, and cerebral 
cortices, corresponding to Stage 6 [18]. Features suggestive 
of diffuse axonal injury, such as axonal swellings (assessed 
by SMI31 immunohistochemistry), microglial nodules, or 
changes indicative of Wallerian degeneration (assessed by 
Iba-1 immunohistochemistry) were not observed in any of 
the six post-mortem cases [17].
Table 3 summarises the characteristic neuropathological 
findings in the six cases applying the NIND diagnostic cri-
teria for CTE [30].
All cases had concomitant AD pathology (Fig. 3; 
Table 4) and some features of ARTAG (Table 3), which 
are currently not regarded as supportive of the diagnosis 
of CTE [30]. Histological features of CTE can be distin-
guished from coexisting AD pathology by patchy involve-
ment of the superficial cortical layers, focal NFTs, and 
neuronal and astrocytic tau pathology adjacent to penetrat-
ing blood vessels with predilection of the depths of corti-
cal sulci [4, 18, 30]. These specific histological features 
of CTE contrast with the uniform distribution of AD-tau 
pathology (neurofibrillary tangles) predominant in the deep 
cortical layers (Fig. 3e). Nevertheless, confluent tau pathol-
ogy with high burden of AD-related changes in some cases 
can preclude the definitive diagnosis of CTE, as observed 
in Case 4 of the present series (Tables 3, 4). Cerebral amy-
loid angiopathy (CAA) and hippocampal sclerosis were 
observed in five and two cases, respectively. Argyrophilic 
grains were absent in the hippocampus and amygdala of 
all cases. Other concomitant diagnoses were CBD (Case 1) 
and LBD (Case 4). Case 3 had mild hyaline arteriosclerosis 
in the parietal and occipital cortices and basal ganglia. Case 
6 had a small focal ischaemic infarct in the cingulate white 
matter and mild small vessel disease in the striatum.
Table 4 summarises the main neuropathological diagno-
ses of these cases.
Case summaries
Case 1
This man was a centre-forward. At 56, he became anxious 
and depressed. He gradually slowed up, his speech became 
slurred, and he was unsteady on his feet resulting in falls. 
Examination revealed rigidity and bradykinesia. At 60, he 
developed progressive non-fluent aphasia. He was irritable 
and aggressive. The clinical picture was a combination of 
FTD with parkinsonism.
The brain was mildly atrophic with dilatation of 
the fourth ventricle, cavum septi pellucidi with septal 
fenestration.
Histological examination of the neocortex showed super-
ficial spongiosis and occasional swollen neurons. Tau immu-
nohistochemistry revealed a combination of pre-tangles, 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), threads, and astrocytic 
plaques, involving the neocortices, deep grey nuclei, hip-
pocampal formation, brainstem, and the cerebellum, with 
threads and coiled bodies in the subcortical white matter, 
indicative of a diagnosis of CBD [11]. There was severe loss 
of pigmented neurons and gliosis in the substantia nigra.
The distribution of neuritic and Aβ-positive plaques and 
NFTs corresponded to ‘intermediate’ AD neuropathologi-
cal changes (A3B2C2).
The superficial cortical layers displayed a high burden 
of neuronal and glial inclusions, positive for both 3-repeat 
and 4-repeat tau immunohistochemistry, supporting CTE-
related pathology. Foci of perivascular astrocytic tangles 
(ATs) and NFTs in the sulcal depths of the frontal and pari-
etal cortices were consistent with CTE [30]. There were 
occasional ghost tangles in CA1 and CA2.
Case 2
This man turned professional in his teens. He reported a 
head-to-head collision with loss of consciousness and skull 
fracture in a football match.
At 69, he had progressive episodic memory impairment 
and became eccentric. His MMSE score was 22/30 at age 
71 and 17/30 at age 74. Past history included transient 
ischaemic attacks and hypertension. He developed impul-
sivity, grandiose ideation, and explosive rage attacks. In 
his last year, aged 78 with advanced dementia, a malignant 
abdominal mass was identified.
Examination of the brain showed moderate atrophy of 
the temporal lobes and hippocampi and fenestration of the 
septum pellucidum, with no evidence of metastatic tumour. 
Pigmentation in the substantia nigra was preserved.
The findings of multiple foci of tau-positive ATs and 
NFTs with more intense in the sulcal depths of the frontal 
and temporal cortices with a perivascular distribution were 
diagnostic of CTE [30]. In addition, there was widespread 
tau pathology supportive of CTE with neuronal and glial 
inclusions in the superficial cortical layers. CTE-tau pathol-
ogy was widespread throughout the limbic structures, sub-
cortical nuclei, and brainstem, in association with other 
supportive features (Table 3).
Neuritic and Aβ plaques were present in the neocortices, 
hippocampus, and striatum, corresponding to ‘intermedi-
ate’ AD neuropathological changes (A2B2C2). There was 
hippocampal sclerosis. Ghost tangles were observed in 
CA1, 3, and 4.
Case 3
This man played centre-half for over 20 years and was also 
an amateur cricketer. He reported a head-to-head collision 
with loss of consciousness during a football match.

At 66, he developed progressive episodic memory 
impairment, disorientation and became irritable and aggres-
sive; gradually, he progressed to advanced dementia with 
occasional seizures. He died aged 74. Past history included 
hypertension and ischaemic heart disease.
Examination of the brain revealed mild focal atrophy of 
the cerebral cortex and hippocampi, marked dilatation of the 
third and lateral ventricles, and fenestration of the septum 
pellucidum. Tau immunohistochemistry demonstrated NFTs 
and threads in the deep cortical layers, hippocampal forma-
tion, amygdala, mammillary body and striatum, widespread 
neritic and Aβ mature, and diffuse plaques in the neocortices 
and hippocampus, consistent with ‘intermediate’ AD neuro-
pathological change (A3B2C3). There was severe CAA in 
the neocortices, gliosis in the hippocampus (CA1, 4), and 
mild loss of pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra.
Case 4
This man was a dedicated amateur footballer and played 
either centre-half or centre-forward every season from the 
age of 10 for more than 20 years. He had one mid-air col-
lision in a match which rendered him unconscious. He also 
boxed as an amateur but did not report any knockout or 
post-concussion symptoms.
He had a 5-year history of memory loss, irritability, 
aggressive behaviour, and visual hallucination which rap-
idly progressed to advanced dementia with parkinsonism, 
gait difficulties, and dysphagia. He died aged 60.
The brain was moderately atrophic especially in the 
medial temporal lobe and hippocampi. The septum pelluci-
dum was fenestrated.
Tau immunohistochemistry revealed frequent NFTs and neu-
ritic plaques with predilection for the deep cortical laminae. The 
extensive distribution of Aβ plaques and NFTs corresponded to 
a diagnosis of ‘high’ AD neuropathological change (A3B3C3).
Frequent α-synuclein immunoreactive Lewy bodies 
were observed in the cortices, cingulate gyrus, hippocam-
pus, substantia nigra, and locus coeruleus with severe loss 
of pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra and locus 
coeruleus, compatible with advanced LBD (Braak stage 6 
[7] and ‘diffuse neocortical’ category [33]).

Case 5
This man had a professional football career that spanned 
two decades. He reported one episode of head collision 
in a match which resulted in fractured jaw but no loss of 
consciousness.
At 63, he developed progressive memory loss, anomia, 
aggressive behaviour, and impulsivity. In his last year of 
life, he developed dysarthria and had moderately advanced 
dementia. He died at 72 of myocardial infarction.
The brain was moderately atrophic, predominantly 
affecting the medial temporal lobe and hippocampi, with 
dilatation of the lateral ventricles and fenestration of the 
septum pellucidum.
Tau immunohistochemistry showed foci of ATs, NFTs, 
and threads in the sulcal depths in the frontal and tempo-
ral cortices with a clear perivascular predilection, consist-
ent with the diagnosis of CTE [30]. The predilection of tau 
aggregates in the superficial cortical layers and other sup-
portive features of CTE were observed (Table 3) [32].
Neuritic and Aβ plaques were observed in the neocor-
tices. The distribution of AD-related pathologies corre-
sponded to ‘intermediate’ AD neuropathological change 
(A2B2C2). There was hippocampal sclerosis, frequent 
ghost tangles in CA1 and mild loss of pigmented neurons 
in the substantia nigra.
Case 6
This man reported one head-to-player collision with loss of con-
sciousness while playing at an English football league match.
He had a 6-year history of memory impairment, inter-
mittent disorientation, disinhibition, and aggressive behav-
iour, which progressed to dementia. Examination revealed 
hypomimia, hand tremor, limb rigidity, and bradykinesia. 
He died at 83.
Examination of the brain showed mild focal atrophy of 
the frontal and medial temporal lobes and hippocampi, dil-
atation of the lateral and third ventricles, and fenestration 
of the septum pellucidum. There was a small focal ischae-
mic infarct in the white matter underlying the cingulate 
cortex.
The widespread tau pathologies were consistent with a 
diagnosis of advanced CTE [32], which included tau-pos-
itive neuronal and astrocytic lesions with predilection for 
the sulcal depths of the temporal cortex in a perivascular 
distribution and other supportive features (Table 3) [30].
There were neuritic and Aβ plaques in the neocorti-
ces and hippocampus. The distribution of Aβ plaques and 
NFTs corresponded to a diagnosis of ‘intermediate’ AD 
neuropathological change (A3B2C2). Mild nigral cell loss 
was observed. There was mild small vessel disease in the 
striatum.
Discussion
We report 14 retired footballers who developed dementia in 
later life. They were all skilled headers with half playing in 
positions that required frequent heading of the ball. Their 
playing career spanned two to three decades and most of 
them started training and heading the ball during child-
hood. The six post-mortem cases showed mixed patholo-
gies, including criteria-defined CTE in four cases, AD and 
TDP-43 pathologies in six, CAA in five, and hippocam-
pal sclerosis in two, and others had vascular pathology 
(N = 1), CBD (N = 1), and LBD (N = 1), and all would 
have contributed synergistically to the clinical manifesta-
tions. The frequency of CTE pathology in four of six cases 
in the present series represents a significant excess when 
compared with the 12% average background rate of inci-
dental CTE pathology in elderly individuals with or with-
out neurodegenerative disorders in our QSBB survey [25]. 
We hypothesize that CTE and, probably, AD and TDP-43 
pathologies in these retired footballers are related to their 
past prolonged exposure to repetitive subconcussive head 
impacts from heading and head-to-player collisions.
Our four CTE cases add to the four case reports of foot-
ballers in the literature, three of whom had histological 
evidence of CTE (Table 5). Of the three cases with histo-
logical evidence of CTE, two presented with an AD-like 
dementia and died in their early 80s [13, 14] and another 
29-year-old had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [31], 
substantiating the notion that playing football is a risk fac-
tor for CTE. The fourth footballer was an amateur and had 
AD pathology [4].
There was no histological evidence of the previous dif-
fuse axonal injury typically observed in acute traumatic 
brain injury, whereas all six of our post-mortem cases had 
septal fenestration and one also had cavum septi pellucidi. 
The finding of septal fenestration is supportive of their past 
histories of chronic repetitive head impacts from playing 
football [29]. The rate of septal abnormalities in our foot-
ballers is greater than the non-boxer general population, 
in whom septal fenestration and fenestration with cavum 
septi pellucidi were 6 and 3%, respectively, in autopsy [9]; 
while these macroscopic features were found in all 11 pro-
fessional boxers in the Corsellis series, except in one case 
in whom cavum septi pellucidi was not observed, but ‘the 
septum was nevertheless fenestrated to destruction’ [9]. 
Concussion rate was limited in six of our 14 cases to one 
episode during their careers, which is a typical finding in 
professional footballers [19, 36] with one study reporting 
74 episodes of concussion in 39 out of 72 male professional 
footballers [3]. Other potential repetitive head impacts out-
side the football field, including amateur boxing (N = 2), 
seizures (N = 2), and postural instability with frequent falls 
in later life (N = 4, Table 2), would have also contributed

to the risk of CTE. The notion that prolonged exposure to 
repetitive subconcussive head impacts can lead to CTE is 
supported by the large Boston series, in which 16% of con-
tact sport athletes and military veterans had CTE pathology 
but reported no concussion [32, 38].
Antemortem prediction of CTE pathology is difficult 
as all cases in the present series had a clinical presenta-
tion resembling either AD or FTD with the majority pre-
senting in their 50s and 60s. In hindsight, motor impair-
ments and early behavioural changes may serve as clinical 
pointers in the three cases with advanced CTE pathology 
(Cases 2, 5, and 6). Professional footballers also have an 
increased risk of developing ALS, but it was not a feature 
in our cases [8]. Mixed pathologies are the rule rather than 
exception in older individuals with dementia [1, 22]. For 
example, CTE, AD, TDP-43, and hippocampal sclerosis 
were also observed in the other two case reports of retired 
professional footballers [13, 14] (Table 5). We assume that 
the majority of our cases in the clinical group would have 
had mixed pathologies, including CTE. In CTE, AD and 
TDP-43 pathologies are common concomitant findings 
(Tables 3, 5) [32], and are increasingly considered as part 
of the CTE pathological entity, especially in older individu-
als [30] with the likelihood of Aβ deposition increased by 
APOE4 allele status [39]. The family history of dementia 
noted in our two oldest post-mortem cases (Cases 2, 6) may 
support a genetic predisposition. Unfortunately, frozen tis-
sue and DNA were not available for genetic analysis in our 
cases.
This clinico-pathological series started as a surveillance 
that had spanned three decades, which was initiated and 
undertaken by a consultant psychiatrist (DDRW) with an 
interest in understanding the potential link between playing 
football and long-term neurodegenerative consequences. 
This descriptive study has a small number of cases with-
out detailed psychometric, neuroimaging, or genetic data, 
yet its prospective collection of demographic data, play-
ing and concussion history from close relatives, and regu-
lar surveillance from out-patient follow-up minimise case 
selection and recall bias in contrast to other post-mortem 
CTE series which relied on retrospective data collection 
only. Football is the most popular sport worldwide with 
over 250 million players at all levels. Although this study 
does not provide a firm causal relationship between CTE 
and exposure to repetitive head impacts from playing foot-
ball, our findings support the pressing need to instigating 
large-scale studies to identify at risk groups of footballers, 
including age of exposure [37], which will justify for the 
implementation of protective strategies and education of 
current players. The significance of heading and the weight 
of the football remain elusive since the threshold of the 
impact force required to trigger the pathological process 
of CTE is currently unknown and repetitive head impacts 
in football are not limited to heading of the ball as foot-
ballers are also frequently exposed to head-to-player colli-
sions [5]. All our cases were exposed to the heavier leather 
football used before the 1980s, which weighed 450 g and in 
wet condition became 25% heavier with the corresponding 
increased impact on contact with the head [2]. Neverthe-
less, lighter balls travel faster and may result in the same 
net force on head impact [19]. The assumption is that the 
lighter synthetic ball may also put modern footballers at 
risk of subconcussion and CTE is supported by the radio-
logical findings of abnormal white matter microstructure in 
young footballers who headed the ball frequently [26] and 
the post-mortem finding of CTE in a 29-year-old footballer 
with ALS [31].
Future prospective longitudinal studies with radiological 
(including tau and amyloid PET scans and diffusion-tensor 
MRI), psychometric, biochemical, CSF, and genetic data in 
contemporary professional footballers with control group 
(e.g., athletes without increased risk of repetitive head 
impact), objective quantitative measure of head impact 
force, and clinical and pathological follow-up are required 
to confirm the potential causal relationship between CTE 
and exposure to repetitive head impacts from playing 
football.
