Initially isolated in 1947, Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently emerged as a significant public health concern.
Sequence analysis of all 41 known ZIKV RNA open reading frames to date indicates that ZIKV has undergone
significant changes in both protein and nucleotide sequences during the past half century.
Zika virus (ZIKV), discovered in 1947, had
caused sporadic disease throughout Af-
rica and Asia until the 2007 Micronesia
and 2013 French Polynesia outbreaks
(Broutet et al., 2016). The rapid expansion
ofgeographicrangeand increaseinsevere
pathogenicity first noted in the 2015–2016
Brazilian outbreak has raised questions
regarding themolecularevolutionofthisvi-
rus. Previously believed to cause only mild
disease, mounting evidence points to the
capacity of ZIKV to cause neuropathology,
including disorders of fetal brain develop-
ment and Guillain-Barre
´ syndrome (Brou-
tet et al., 2016). In addition to the rise
of associated disorders, novel modes of
ZIKV transmission have been reported,
including maternal-fetal transmission (Bra-
sil et al., 2016; Calvet et al., 2016; Sarno
et al., 2016) and sexual transmission (Hills
et al., 2016).
ZIKV is a flavivirus closely related to
dengue virus (DENV). Its genome is a sin-
gle-stranded positive-sense RNA mole-
cule of approximately 10,800 base pairs.
A single open reading frame (ORF) is
flanked by 50 and 30 untranslated regions
(UTRs). The resulting single polyprotein
is cleaved into the structural proteins
capsid (C), pre-membrane protein (prM),
and envelope (E) and the non-structural
proteins NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A,
2K, NS4B, and NS5 (Kuno and Chang,
2007). Prior genetic and phylogenetic an-
alyses have identified two main ZIKV line-
ages, African and Asian, and the recent
21st century epidemics have been traced
to the Asian lineage (Faye et al., 2014;
Haddow
et
al.,
2012;
Lanciotti
and
Lambert,
2016).
Despite
circulating
throughout Africa and Asia for the latter
half of the 20th century, ZIKV infections
were not associated with significant hu-
man pathology until now. The reasons
for this are obscure. It has been hypothe-
sized that the virus may have recently
evolved to become more neurotropic, to
exhibit
increased
replicative
capacity,
and/or to become more transmissible to
humans, but causal support for these
possibilities is outstanding. To gain a bet-
ter understanding of the molecular evolu-
tion of the virus, we performed detailed
phylogenetic and genetic analyses, as
well as targeted structural modeling, on
all known full-length ORFs of ZIKV avail-
able to date (with an emphasis on the
recent human strains).
Nucleotide sequences from 41 strains
were included in the analysis: 30 human
isolates (including two newly reported
here), ten mosquito isolates, and one
monkey isolate. All sequences greater
than 10.1 kb in length were included in
the analysis to in order to encompass all
complete sequences of ORFs. The strains
analyzed, including accession numbers,
year, location, and source of isolation,
are listed in Table S1. We first investi-
gated
the
phylogenetic
relationships
for all full-length ORF sequences by
using maximum likelihood (ML) mapping
method with 1,000 replicates. Consistent
with prior reports, there were two major
lineages
of
ZIKV,
African
and
Asian
(Figure 1A). Interestingly, the African line-
age contained eight mosquito isolates,
whereas P6-740 (Malaysia/1966) was the
sole mosquito isolate in the Asian lineage.
All the contemporary human strains share
greater sequence homology to P6-740
than IbH-30656 (Nigeria/1968), suggest-
ing that the ZIKV strains in the recent hu-
man outbreak are evolved from the Asian
lineage, which is anchored by P6-740
(Figure S1). All of the human strains iden-
tified in the 2015–2016 epidemic appear
to be more closely related to the H/PF/
2013 strain (French Polynesia/2013) than
the FSM strain (Micronesia/2007), sug-
gesting that perhaps these two variants
have evolved in parallel from a common
ancestor. Furthermore, compared to the
mosquito strain, 435 and 446 nucleotide
changes are evident in FSM and H/PF/
2013, respectively,
and among
them
344 nucleotides are identical. Therefore,
the two Asian sub-lineages could have
diverged
from
a
common
ancestor,
arrived in Malaysia, established niches,
and later dispersed to South America. It
is unclear why the ZIKV strain that already
Cell Host & Microbe 19, May 11, 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc.
561
 existed in 1966 in Malaysia did not have a
significant clinical impact until 50 years
later in Oceania. A more rigorous analysis
of the potential relationship between the
genetic
changes
and
epidemiological
topography is required, which will be
possible as we gain further sequence in-
formation on currently circulating clinical
strains and their associated pathology.
We focused further analysis on the
nucleotide sequence of four independent
human strains with known clinical out-
comes. Natal_RGN (KU527068) was iso-
lated from the brain tissue of a fetus
with severe microcephaly (Mlakar et al.,
2016), and ZKV2015 (KU497555.1) was
isolated from the amniotic fluid of a preg-
nant patient whose fetus was diagnosed
with microcephaly (Calvet et al., 2016).
Here, we include two very recent human
isolates: Rio-U1 (KU926309.1) and Rio-
S1 (KU926310.1) (Bonaldo et al., 2016).
Rio-U1 was isolated from the urine of a
pregnant
woman
who
presented
at
18 weeks’ gestation with rash and hand
arthralgia, edema, and paresthesias. She
recovered acutely from her symptoms,
her ultrasound at the time of diagnosis
was normal, and she continues to be fol-
lowed. Rio-S1 was isolated from a man
who presented with low grade fever, mal-
aise, rash, conjunctival hyperemia, and
hand and wrist arthralgias, edema, and
paresthesias. His illness self-resolved in
10 days. Compared with the 29 other hu-
man strains, the number and distribution
of unique nucleotide changes are shown
in Figure 1B. There were 15, 13, 16, and
15 nucleotide changes in Natal_RGN,
ZKV2015, Rio-U1, and Rio-S1, respec-
tively. In pairwise comparisons, there
were only three unique amino acid substi-
tutions in Natal_RGN: K940E and T1027A
in NS1, and T2509I in NS4B. ZKV2015
had
three
amino
acid
substitutions:
S550T
in
E,
L1259F
in
NS2A,
and
E2831V in NS5. Rio-U1 had only one
change: K2039R in NS3. Rio-S1 had three
amino acid changes: T625A in E, A2122T
in NS4A, and V2688A in NS5.
We were interested in exploring differ-
ences in the protein sequence of the Afri-
can and Asian lineages. Assuming that
an African mosquito subtype was the
ancestor of the Asian human subtype,
we compared the amino acid sequences
between
eight
African
strains
(seven
from mosquitos and one from monkey)
and 25 Asian strains isolated from hu-
mans. We found that there were 59 amino
acid variations located throughout the
viral polyprotein sequence that are shared
among the individual strains within the
African or Asian lineages but are different
between
these
two
major
lineages
(Figure 2A). For comparison, the African
human
(IbH-30656/Nigeria/1968)
and
Asian mosquito (P6-740/Malaysia/1966)
strains are shown. Our phylogenic anal-
ysis builds upon prior studies by the addi-
tion of the most recent human strains to
the analysis and further supports the exis-
tence of two divergent African and Asian
lineages. An important limitation in the
analysis of ancestral strain sequences is
the
potential
that
these
substitutions
were adaptations acquired during pas-
sages in mouse brains. This is in compar-
ison to modern isolates that were usually
sequenced after low passage numbers
in monkey or mosquito cell lines. Viral
evolution
within
the
murine
host
is
an important question to consider in
future experiments, particularly as mouse
models are developed to study pathogen-
esis (Lazear et al., 2016), as well as anti-
viral and vaccine development. Further
studies
are
needed
to
elucidate
the
sequential acquisition of these mutations
and their individual contributions to hu-
man pathogenesis.

 Due to the recent epidemic and techno-
logical advances that now allow rapid and
full-length sequencing from direct human
isolates, the public bank of human ZIKV
sequences has increased from eight at
the end of 2014 to 30 as of March 2016.
We performed a detailed exploration of
the evolution of amino acid polymor-
phisms of the recent human strains, all
of the Asian lineage. Our phylogenetic
analysis revealed that all contemporary
human isolates share a common ancestor
with the P6-740 strain isolated from
Aedes aegypti mosquito. Comparison of
protein sequences using P6-740 as the
Asian reference showed that FSM had
over 400 variations at the nucleotide level
and 26 unique substitutions at the protein
level (Figure 2B). Interestingly, when we
investigated the sequences of selected
human strains identified in more recent
epidemics (including FSM, H/PF/2013,
and Brazilian strains), we found that all
of these strains have acquired changes
at an additional eight positions, for a total
of 34 amino acid changes compared to
P6-740 (Figure 2B). Furthermore, all iso-
lates show identical amino acids at these
positions, with the exception of position
T2634M/V in the NS5 protein.
Although ZIKV is believed to be primar-
ily transmitted through the mosquito vec-
tor, it is interesting to note that no known
ZIKV mosquito isolate possesses the
same nucleotide sequence as the human
strains. One possible explanation is sam-
pling bias, where more recent efforts
have focused on isolating the virus from
infected humans rather than mosquito
arbovirus surveillance. However, it is
notable that Duffy et al. were unable
to detect ZIKV in mosquitos despite
active surveillance during the Micronesia
outbreak (Duffy et al., 2009). Alternatively,
it is possible that other routes of transmis-
sion, such as sexual transmission, may
have a greater contribution to the wide
spread of ZIKV in the Americas. Intrigu-
ingly, it was recently reported that New
World
strains
of
Aedes
aegypti
and
albopictus are poor transmitters of ZIKV
(Chouin-Carneiro et al., 2016). Clearly,
more studies are urgently needed on nat-
ural vector transmission of ZIKV in Asia
and the Americas, as well as the possibil-
ity of a more prominent contribution of
alternative modes of transmission.
In addition to alterations in protein
sequences and structures during ZIKV

(A) Graphical illustration of comparison between of Zika virus (ZIKV) from both linages. Amino acid
comparisons were made between African (eight mosquito strains and one monkey strain) and Asian lin-
eages (25 human strains). The sequences are aligned using MUSCLE. Conserved mutations were selected
using meta-CATS from ViPR. A graphical map (top bar) of conserved amino acids is shown, represented
by blue lines. These sites were in the table below, with the addition of an African human isolate (IbH-30656)
and an Asian mosquito isolate (P6-740) for reference. Conserved sites from African and Asian lineages
were highlighted in orange and blue, whereas non-related substitutions were highlighted in yellow.
(B) Amino acid substitutions were made from pairwise comparisons of P6-740 against all Asian lineage
isolates from humans. All mutations in P6-740 were labeled in orange. Using P6-740 as a reference,
identical amino acid substitutions in the human isolates were also highlighted orange, and differences
were labeled in blue.
(C) PrM protein of ZIKV shows significant structural alterations. Amino acid substitutions between strains
are shown in the table inset. The cartoon represents the predicted overall tertiary structural comparison
of ZIKV prM proteins from Rio-U1 (cyan) and ARB13565 (yellow). The automated server program
CPHmodels-3.0 was employed to build the model according to the homology modeling method. The
model was submitted to the SWISS-MODEL Workspace to obtain the 3D structure, then verified using
PROCHECK and by Verify3D Structure Evaluation Server and QMEAN. The figure was created in PyMol.
The structural templates for the prM protein query sequences were DENV 1 PrM Protein (PDB: 4b03),
which shared 48.35% and 50.55% primary sequence identity with the ZIKV PrM proteins from Rio-U1 and
ARB13565, respectively. The N and C termini of the structures were labeled with letters. The differences
between these two virus strains were shown in sticks.

 evolution, nucleotide sequence changes
may have an impact on viral genomic sta-
bility, replicative efficiency, and thus viral
fitness and transmissibility. Strains from
the recent epidemic in Brazil showed
14–18 nucleotide mutations compared to
the other strains of the Asian lineage iso-
lated from humans. While the nucleotide
changes in ZKV2015, Rio-U1, and Rio-
S1 are distributed throughout the viral
genomic RNA, 50% of the mutations in
Natal_RGN, which was isolated from the
brain, are located in the NS1 gene. The
phenomenon of tissue-specific mutations
has been reported for hepatitis C virus,
another flavivirus with infectivity to the
brain, liver, and blood (Ramachandran
et al., 2011). No samples from the brain
were taken from the fetus with ZKV2015,
and therefore tissue-specific evolution of
ZIKV cannot be definitively supported
from the available data. However, as
more samples isolated from different
compartments with known clinical out-
comes become available, additional ge-
netic and biochemical assays to deter-
mine
the
potential
impact
of
these
changes on viral pathogenesis will be
possible.
The pr region of prM protein had the
highest percentage variability between
the Asian human and the African mos-
quito subtypes. Six of the 59 (�10%)
amino acid variations between these
subtypes, namely I110V, K143E, A148P,
V153M, H157Y, and V158I, were in the
pr region of prM. Furthermore, within the
Asian lineage, there were three additional
changes
in human strains
compared
to the mosquito strain P6-740: V123A,
S139N, and V153M. Structural predic-
tions based on the DENV 1 pr protein
(PDB: 4b03) showed significant differ-
ences between Rio-U1 and ARB13565
(Figure 2C). Our analysis predicts that
A148P could possibly play a critical role
in mediating a ten-amino-acid structural
change from a loop into a continuous
b sheet. This change was only present in
human isolates from both lineages, which
suggests a potential relevance in human
infectivity.
PrM forms a heterodimer with the main
viral surface protein, E, in the neutral pH of
the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER). Immature viral particles translocate
from the ER to the highly acidic environ-
ment of the trans-Golgi network where
they are packaged into exosomes. The
process of viral maturation takes place
in the low-pH environment where viral
surface proteins go through a drastic
conformational
rearrangement
due
to
dissociation of prM-E, formation of E
homodimers, and exposure of the prM
cleavage
site
to
furin
protease.
The
cleaved pr shields the E protein fusion
loop throughout the low-pH condition to
prevent secretion of immature particles
from the vesicles, and it only dissociates
from virions in the extracellular environ-
ment (Zhang et al., 2012). The role of
prM in viral pathogenesis has been under
extensive investigation over the past few
years. It has been shown that prM plays
a critical role in viral assembly, matura-
tion, heterodimer formation with the E
protein, particle secretion, and virulence
(Zhang et al., 2012). In our analysis, the
six
amino
acid
substitutions
in
prM
(I110V, K143E, A148P, V153M, H157Y,
and V158I) resulted in a dramatic pre-
dicted structural change of prM between
the African and Asian strains. The effect
of this structural change on viral function
is currently unknown, and further investi-
gations are required to determine whether
the observed amino acid changes in prM
might have altered the viral pathogenesis
of the Asian strain.
It should be noted that Faria et al. have
published a recent report detailing a
similar
phylogenetic
analysis
on
se-
quences
obtained
from
the
Brazilian
epidemic (Faria et al., 2016). Our phyloge-
netic analysis builds upon theirs with
additional sequences, as the new strains
they reported were available on GenBank
when we started this study. However,
because
detailed
clinical
information
was not available at the time, we did not
include
these strains in
the detailed
nucleotide sequence analysis of select
strains with known clinical outcomes
(Figure 1B). Further, we utilized an alter-
native approach to structural modeling:
rather than mapping, we generated two
structural models and overlapped them,
leading us to predict the structural change
in prM protein.
Our phylogenetic analysis has revealed
numerous sequence variations in ZIKV
genomes between the African and Asian
lineages, as well as among different
strains within Asian lineage, as the clinical
disease caused by ZIKV has changed
from causing only a benign illness to
now including severe neuropathology.
Our modeling studies suggest that these
sequence variations could mediate spe-
cific changes in the prM protein, which
could play a role in virulence or improved
fitness. In addition, we have narrowed
these changes to a reasonable number
of amino acid or nucleotide changes that
can be tested for their effect on ZIKV
infectivity. Future experiments will be
required to determine which amino acid
or nucleotide substitutions are directly
responsible for the possible increased
neurotropism, heightened viral fitness,
and enhanced transmissibility and infec-
tivity from the mosquito vector to the
human host.
