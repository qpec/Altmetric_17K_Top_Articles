AbstrAct
Objectives This study aims to examine the tracking and 
predictability of physical activity in old age from overall 
physical activity and participation in sport, recreational 
activity and walking in mid-life.
Design Prospective population-based cohort study.
setting British Regional Heart Study participants recruited 
from primary care centres in the UK in 1978–1980.
Participants and outcome measures Men (n=3413) 
self-reported their physical activity at baseline, 12, 16 
and 20-year follow-ups and were categorised as inactive 
or active and having high or low participation in sport, 
walking and recreational activities. Tracking was assessed 
using kappa statistics and random effects models. Logistic 
regression estimated the odds of being active at 20-year 
follow-up according to physical activity participation in 
mid-life.
results Among 3413 men (mean age at baseline 
48.6±5.4 years) with complete data, tracking of overall 
physical activity was moderate (kappa: 0.23–0.26). 
Tracking was higher for sports participation (kappa: 
0.35–0.38) compared with recreational activity (kappa: 
0.16–0.24) and walking (kappa: 0.11–0.15). Intraclass 
correlation coefficients demonstrated similar levels of 
stability and only marginally weakened after controlling 
for covariates. Compared with inactive men, being active 
at baseline was associated with greater odds of being 
active at 20-year follow-up (OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.4 to 3.2) 
after adjusting for sociodemographic, health and lifestyle 
variables. Playing sport in mid-life was more strongly 
associated with being active at 20-year follow-up than 
other domains, particularly when sport participation began 
earlier in life.
conclusion Being physically active in mid-life increases 
the odds of being active in old age. Promoting physical 
activity in later life might be best achieved by promoting 
sport participation earlier in the life course.
IntrODuctIOn
Prospective epidemiological studies have 
shown that physical activity (PA) in mid-life 
and old age is associated with numerous 
health benefits, including reductions in 
cardiovascular disease events and mortality.1–3 
Taking up PA in later life may reduce the risk 
of adverse health outcomes, but maintaining 
a physically active lifestyle throughout the 
life course may provide optimal health bene-
fits.4–6 The transition from mid-life to old 
age typically coincides with major life events 
(eg, retirement) and therefore may be an 
important window when both the volume and 
type of PA are likely to change. Knowledge 
on the stability, or tracking, of PA during 
this transition is very limited. The tracking 
of a behaviour over time can be determined 
by (1) its stability of overtime, typically esti-
mated using correlations between repeated 
measures or (2) the predictability of later 
measures from previous ones.7 Past exer-
cise behaviour is a consistent predictor of 
current PA levels8; however, few studies have 
examined the predictability of PA in old age 
from PA measures in mid-life. Understanding 
tracking of PA during this transition may help 
inform interventions aiming to promote or 
maintain activity levels from mid-life to old 
age.
There is a large body of research on the 
tracking of PA from childhood, but few 
studies have extended over prolonged 
periods in adults.9 Current evidence suggests 
low to moderate tracking of PA throughout 
the life course.9–11 Studies tracking PA in

Research
strengths and limitations of this study
 
► This study investigates the tracking of overall and 
specific domains of physical activity during the 
transition to old age over 20 years, an understudied 
period of the life course.
 
► Very few studies have investigated the tracking 
of specific domains of physical activity during this 
period.
 
► Our results may not be generalisable to women and 
non-white ethnic groups.

youth have shown that sport participation in early life 
tracks more strongly9 and is a stronger predictor of 
activity levels in adulthood (age 42 years) compared 
with other domains of activity such as outdoor play.12 
However, tracking studies in adults have rarely distin-
guished between the types of PA. Thus, it remains 
unknown what types of activity in mid-life are more 
likely to predict PA in old age. The limited evidence in 
older adults has suggested some domains of PA are more 
liable to change (eg, indoor activities) than others (eg, 
outdoor and leisure activities)13 and thus may be easier 
to modify. Further studies have investigated the predict-
ability of activity levels in early old age according to PA 
in early adulthood. For example, one study showed that 
being moderately active in young adulthood (mean age 
35 years) increased the odds of being active 28 years later 
by more than three times.14 Another study showed that 
sport participation in healthy young men (aged 25 years) 
strongly predicted PA 50 years later.15 However, this study 
was retrospective in nature and may not be generalisable 
to less healthy populations.
Overall, very few tracking studies have extended into 
old age. Furthermore, the predictability of PA in later 
life from participation in specific types of activity in 
mid-life remains unknown. Thus, we aimed to estimate 
the tracking of overall and specific domains of PA from 
mid-life to old age and the predictability of PA levels in old 
age from (1) overall PA and (2) PA domains in mid-life.
MethODs
Participants
Data were drawn from the British Regional Heart Study, 
an ongoing prospective cohort study involving 7735 men 
(response rate=78%) from 24 towns in Great Britain.16 
Men were recruited from primary care practices and 
were first examined in 1978–1980 aged 40–59 years and 
were followed up after 12, 16 and 20 years. Response 
rates for surviving cohort members were 91% (n=5925), 
88% (n=5263) and 77% (n=4252) at 12, 16 and 20-year 
follow-ups, respectively. Men completed a lifestyle and 
medical history questionnaire at the time of the exam-
ination (baseline and 20-year follow-up) or by post (12 
and 16-year follow-ups). Participants provided informed 
written consent to the investigation. Ethical approval 
was obtained from the National Research Ethics Service 
Committee London.
Measures
Self-reported PA
At all waves, participants reported their usual PA levels. 
Questions referred to time spent on all forms of walking, 
time spent on recreational activities (such as recreational 
walking, gardening, chores, do-it-yourself (DIY)) and how 
frequently they participate in sport/exercise. Responses 
to each domain of PA were scored based on the intensity 
and frequency of the activity.17 18 For example, making no 
journeys by foot was scored as 0 and >90 min/weekday was 
scored as 5. Scores were also heavily weighted for vigorous 
activities. For example, playing sport four to seven times 
a month was given a score of 8. Scores for each domain 
were summed together to give a total PA score. The 
original scoring system has been reported in detail else-
where.19 The total PA score was then used to classify 
activity levels as inactive, occasional, light, moderate, 
moderately vigorous or vigorous. These PA scores have 
previously been validated against resting heart rate19 and 
accelerometer-measured PA.20 Results from the validation 
studies revealed a strong inverse relationship between PA 
and ECG-measured resting heart rate (p<0.001) and a 
strong positive association with accelerometer-measured 
moderate-to-vigorous PA (r=0.49, p<0.001).19 20 For the 
purposes of this study, the categories were grouped into 
active or inactive (inactive and occasional groups were 
classified as inactive). Responses to individual questions 
were also used to classify participation in specific domains 
of activity. Men were classified as having high or low 
sport/exercise participation (no sport/exercise partic-
ipation was classified as low), high or low walking (low 
walking was classified as ≤20 min/day) and high or low 
recreational activity (low recreational activity was defined 
as being similar or less active than someone who spends 
2 hours on most days on recreational activities). Men 
who reported participating in sport also retrospectively 
disclosed how many years they had been involved in that 
activity, from which men were classified as participating in 
sport for ≤4 years, 5–11 years, 12–24 years and ≥25 years.
covariates
Participants self-reported their age at baseline; social 
class, which was derived from their longest held occu-
pation21 and categorised as manual or non-manual; 
and cigarette smoking habits, classified as current or 
ex-smokers and never smokers. Nurses measured partic-
ipant’s height and weight, which was used to derive body 
mass index (BMI). Men were then categorised as over-
weight or obese (BMI: ≥25.0 kg/m2) or healthy weight 
(BMI: <25.0 kg/m2).
statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to report sample character-
istics at baseline and the proportion of men active/high 
participation at each wave. McNemar’s χ2 test was used to 
determine whether the proportion reporting being phys-
ically active changed between time points. Cohen’s kappa 
was used to assess the observed agreement compared 
with the expected agreement. We followed suggestions 
by Munoz and Bangdiwala for interpretation of K coef-
ficients: <0.00 indicates poor agreement, 0.00–0.20 fair 
agreement, 0.21–0.45 moderate agreement, 0.46–0.75 
substantial agreement and 0.76–1.0 indicates near 
perfect agreement.22 Kappa statistics vary in magnitude 
depending on how the outcome measure is categorised. 
To be consistent across all our measures we decided to 
perform analyses using binary variables. Random effects 
models were also used to calculate intraclass correlation

coefficients (ICCs), providing an indicator of tracking 
using data from all assessments while also controlling for 
covariates. In a supplementary analysis, we stratified our 
sample according to changes in employment status as we 
hypothesised that the timing of retirement may affect 
the stability of PA. We categorised men as no change in 
employment status (representing continuous employ-
ment/seeking employment and continuously retired) 
or retiring (ie, retired between baseline and the respec-
tive follow-up) and presented kappa statistics separately. 
Finally, we used logistic regression to estimate the OR 
for being active compared with being inactive at 20-year 
follow-up according to (1) overall activity levels at base-
line, (2) engagement in specific domains of PA at baseline 
and (3) duration of sports participation. Tests for linear 
trend were also conducted by entering sports duration 
as a continuous variable into regression models. Initial 
models were adjusted for age, entered as a continuous 
variable (model 1) and then for BMI, social class and 
smoking status (categorical) (model 2). In analyses using 
just baseline activity levels as predictors of activity (ie, not 
sports duration) at 20-year follow-up, we also introduced 
a third model including all PA variables to identify the 
strongest predictor of activity 20 years later while also 
accounting for participation in other types of PA.
results
Up to 7735 men responded to the baseline survey. Men 
who died during follow-up (26.4%, n=2041), those with 
missing PA data for other reasons (29.4%, n=2272) at 
one or more examination between baseline and 20-year 
follow-up and those with missing covariate data (0.1%, 
n=9) were excluded from analyses, leaving 3413 for 
analyses. Compared with men in the analytical sample, 
men excluded from the analyses were significantly older 
(baseline age, 48.6 vs 51.5 years, p<0.001), had a higher 
BMI (baseline BMI, 25.3 vs 25.7, p<0.001) and were more 
likely to be inactive at baseline (proportion inactive at 
baseline, 55.5% vs 66.1%, p<0.001). A larger sample was 
included in the random effects models, as men were only 
excluded if they did not provide PA measures on at least 
two assessments and have valid covariate data.
Table 1 displays sample characteristics and the 
proportion of men who were physically active and who 
participated in PA domains at each time point. Between 
baseline and 12-year follow-up, the number of men clas-
sified as active increased from 66.1% to 71.0% (p<0.001) 
and then dropped significantly to 63.7% and 66.9% 
(p<0.001) at 16 and 20-year follow-ups, respectively. The 
proportion of men classified as active declined more 
rapidly thereafter, with 57.3% of men classified as active 
at 30-year follow-up (data not shown). The proportion 
of men reporting high levels of walking increased from 
26.9% at baseline to 61.5% at 20-year follow-up (p<0.001). 
There were also steep declines over the 20-year follow-up 
in recreational activity, with 56.0% of men reporting high 
levels of recreational activity at baseline and 40.2% at 
20-year follow-up.
Table 2 presents kappa statistics and ICC for PA vari-
ables. Kappa statistics for overall PA ranged from 0.23 
to 0.26 between baseline and subsequent time points, 
but were highest for sports participation (0.35–0.38) 
and lowest for walking (0.11–0.15). Kappa statistics 
were generally higher for shorter follow-up periods. In 
random effects models, ICCs were consistent with the 
kappa statistics and were only marginally weakened after 
controlling for covariates. In a supplementary analysis, we 
present kappa statistics according to employment status. 
Overall stability of total PA was similar between men 
who reported no change in working status and men who

retired between baseline and subsequent follow-ups (see 
online supplementary table 1). However, a higher propor-
tion of men who were retiring increased their total activity 
between baseline and subsequent follow-ups compared 
with men who reported no change in their working status 
(eg, 21.3% vs 15.7% of men increased their total activity 
levels between wave 1 and wave 2 in the retiring group 
and the no change group, respectively (data not shown)). 
Similarly, the overall stability of sport participation was 
comparable between men who reported no change in 
working status and retiring men, but the retiring group 
contained a higher proportion of men who increased 
their sport participation (eg, 15.8% vs 12.6% of men 
increased their sports participation between wave 1 and 
wave 2 in the retiring group and the no change group, 
respectively (data not shown)). Stability of recreational 
activity was markedly lower in men retiring between base-
line and wave 4 compared with men who reported no 
change in their working status during the same period. 
This was largely explained by a higher proportion of 
retiring men reporting a decrease in recreational activity 
compared with men reporting no change in work status 
(eg, 30.4% vs 24.7% of men reported a decrease in recre-
ational activity between wave 1 and wave 4 in the retiring 
group and the no change group, respectively). There 
were also some clear differences in the stability of walking 
activity between men who reported no change in working 
status and retiring men. This was largely explained by a 
higher proportion of retiring men reporting an increase 
in walking activity compared with men with no change 
in working status (eg, 39.6% vs 28.9% of men reported 
an increase in walking activity between wave 1 and wave 
2 in the retiring group and the no change group, respec-
tively).
Compared with inactive men, being physically active at 
baseline was associated with greater odds (OR 2.7, 95% CI 
2.4 to 3.2) of being physically active at 20-year follow-up 
after adjusting for age, social class, BMI and smoking 
status at baseline (table 3). ORs for being active at 20-year 
follow-up were similarly raised for men who played sport 
at baseline after adjustments (OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.3 to 3.1). 
High participation in walking and recreational activity at 
baseline were also associated with greater odds of being 
active at 20-year follow-up (OR 1.4–1.6). In the final 
model including all PA domains, sport participation at 
baseline remained the strongest predictor of being active 
at 20-year follow-up.
Table 4 shows the odds of being active at 20-year 
follow-up according to duration of sports participa-
tion from baseline. This sample size was lower than the 
main analytical sample as 27.3% (n=444) of men who 
played sport did not report duration of participation. 
Longer duration of sports participation was associated 
with increased odds of being active at 20-year follow-up. 
Compared with those who were not participating in sport 
at baseline, taking part in sport for 25 years or more 
was most strongly associated with being active at 20-year 
follow-up (OR 4.8, 95% CI 3.4 to 6.8). However, even 
taking up sport recently (≤4 years) was associated with 
increased odds of being active at 20-year follow-up (OR 
2.3, 95% CI 1.7 to 3.2).
DIscussIOn
This study investigated the tracking of overall and specific 
domains of PA from mid-life to old age and the predict-
ability of PA in old age from overall PA and participation 
in sport, recreational activity and walking in mid-life. 
Agreement between overall PA levels at baseline and 
subsequent measures at 12, 16 and 20-year follow-ups 
suggested moderate levels of tracking, with stronger 
tracking evident for sport participation compared with 
other domains. Importantly, however, prevalence of 
walking >20 min/day increased from around a third to 
approximately two-thirds by 20-year follow-up. Compari-
sons with previous studies are challenging given the various 
measures, cut-off points and time frames studied, but our 
findings appear to be in agreement with previous studies 
in similar age groups,9 23 24 but over a longer time span. 
As expected, tracking coefficients tended to be higher for

of men categorised as active fluctuated over the 20-year 
follow-up period, we did not observe the decline over 
time that one might expect with the advancing age of the 
sample. However, when we extended our follow-up to 30 
years when men were aged 70–89, a notable decline was 
observed. This is consistent with cross-sectional data from 
the Health Survey for England,25 which presented similar 
proportions of men meeting PA recommendations at ages 
55–64 and 65–74 years, followed by a decline in men >75 
years old.
This is the first study that we are aware of to examine 
tracking of specific domains of activity from mid-life to 
old age and the predictability of PA in old age from PA 
domains in mid-life. Sports participation was the most 
stable domain with moderate agreement between baseline 
and subsequent time points. Tracking was fair for walking 
owing to a high proportion increasing their walking 
activity (eg, 39.6% of retired men increased from low to 
high walking between baseline and 12-year follow-up). 
Tracking of recreational activity was fair to moderate 
despite a large proportion decreasing their recreational 
activity by 20-year follow-up (eg, 30.5% of retired men 
decreased from high to low recreational activity between 
baseline and 12-year follow-up). Tracking indicators 
from random effects models provided comparable esti-
mates of tracking, while using all available measurements 
and controlling for factors that may influence tracking. 
The differential changes over time between domains of 
activity may reflect the changing opportunities and func-
tional abilities associated with ageing. Our supplementary 
analyses suggest that retirement may be a period when 
PA behaviours are more sensitive to change. Increased 
free time during retirement may possibly explain the 
observed steep increase in walking and lower levels of 
stability during this transition, whereas declines in phys-
ical function and onset of chronic disease may explain 
reductions in the more strenuous activities related to 
recreational activity, such as DIY and gardening. Given 
that our measure of recreational activity consisted of 
several activities including recreational walking, the 
observed increases in walking may have masked an even 
steeper decline in other recreational activities.
PA during mid-life was associated with increased odds 
of being active in old age. Comparable results were 
found in a study by Morseth et al,14 who found that 
Norwegian men and women who were active in mid-life 
(aged 20–54 at baseline) were 5–13 times more likely to 
remain non-sedentary 28 years later. Although similar, 
our findings come from a sample of older British men 
all of whom would have transitioned to old age over the

20-year period and would take part in very different activ-
ities to their Norwegian counterparts. Sport participation 
in mid-life predicted PA in old age more strongly than 
walking and recreational activity. This is consistent with 
previous tracking studies from childhood to adulthood 
that have also shown that sporting activity tracks more 
strongly9 and is a stronger predictor of PA later in life 
than other domains of activity12 26; however, this is the 
first study that we are aware of to demonstrate similar 
findings during the transition to old age. There may be a 
number of reasons why participation in sport in mid-life 
more strongly predicts activity in older age than other 
types of activity. One possibility is that people’s enjoyment 
of sport may be more likely to persist into old age than 
preferences for other types of activity. Sport participa-
tion in mid-life may help maintain physical function and 
PA self-efficacy in later life, increasing psychological and 
physical readiness for PA in old age. Stronger levels of 
tracking may also suggest that participation in sport is less 
modifiable than other domains. By contrast, lower levels 
of tracking for walking, predominantly caused by large 
increases in uptake, suggest that walking may be easier to 
adopt in older adults, particularly those with functional 
limitations. Thus, improving our understanding on how 
to promote this domain of PA is important for future 
research. We also found that earlier engagement in sport 
more strongly predicted PA in old age. Engagement in 
sport by early adulthood may be crucial for establishing a 
lifelong habit for sport participation and for developing 
important motor skills. Thus, earlier engagement may 
result in improved capability to maintain PA and sport 
in older age. Although earlier sport participation appears 
favourable, even taking up sport in mid-life more than 
doubled the odds of being active in old age compared 
with adults not taking part in sport in mid-life. Encour-
aging sport participation early in the life course may be 
most effective for promoting lifelong PA but even inter-
ventions promoting uptake in middle-aged adults may be 
successful.
The main strengths of this study are its large sample size 
and long follow-up, encompassing the transition from 
mid-life to old age, an understudied period in PA tracking 
studies. Our study is limited by the use of self-reported 
assessment of PA, which may have been prone to bias. 
Nevertheless, the questionnaire was validated at baseline 
against resting heart rate19 and more recently against 
accelerometer-measured PA.20 Despite this, we are unable 
to validate responses to the question on duration of 
sport participation, although studies in men of a compa-
rable age have used similar questions with longer recall 
periods.15 Use of the same questionnaire at successive 
waves should result in comparable results between waves. 
Self-reports also allowed us to examine how specific types 
of PA track, which may provide useful insight for inter-
vention strategy. Another limitation is that our findings 
may not be generalisable to women and non-white ethnic 
groups, who are not represented in this study sample. 
Furthermore, men who were lost to follow-up were more 
likely to be overweight or obese and were generally less 
active than men with complete data. This attrition may 
have led to an overestimation of PA levels and the strength 
of tracking. PA may be more liable to change in men who 
were lost to follow-up, possibly as a result of an increased 
risk of developing chronic health conditions.27 Random 
effects models which provide estimates of tracking using 
all available data, while also accounting for factors that 
may influence tracking strength, may have alleviated, at 
least in part, the bias caused by this attrition.
cOnclusIOn
In conclusion, PA tracks moderately from mid-life to old 
age. Being active in mid-life was associated with increased 
odds of being active in old age. Playing sport in mid-life 
was more strongly associated with PA in old age than 
other domains of PA. Encouraging early and sustained 
sports participation into mid-life may be effective for 
promoting PA in old age, but increased opportunities to 
take up other forms of activity, such as walking, may also 
be crucial as people transition into old age.
