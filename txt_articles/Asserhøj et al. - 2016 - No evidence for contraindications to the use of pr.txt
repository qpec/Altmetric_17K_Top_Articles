Abstract
Background: Propofol is thought to be a potential cause of allergic reactions in patients allergic to egg, soy or peanut, since
current formulations contain an emulsion that includes egg lecithin and soybean oil. However, other than six case reports
lacking in confirmatory evidence of an allergic reaction, there is no evidence linking the two types of allergies. The aim of this
study was to examine the frequency of propofol allergy and to investigate if patients with specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) to egg,
soy or peanut tolerated propofol.
Methods: Study A examined the frequency of propofol allergy in 273 patients systematically investigated for suspected
perioperative allergic reactions. Of these, 153 had been exposed to propofol and underwent skin tests and intravenous
provocation. Study B retrospectively investigated propofol exposure and tolerance in 520 adult patients with a positive specific
IgE to egg, soy or peanut.
Results: Four of the 153 propofol-exposed patients (2.6%) investigated in study Awere diagnosed with propofol allergy. Of these,
three tested positive only on intravenous provocation. None of the four had allergic symptoms when eating egg, soy or peanut
and none had detectable levels of specific IgE to egg or soy in their serum. In study B we found no signs of allergic reactions
towards propofol in 171 retrieved anaesthetic charts from 99 patients with specific IgE to egg, soy or peanut.
Conclusion: No connection between allergy to propofol and allergy to egg, soy or peanut was found. The present practice
of choosing alternatives to propofol in patients with this kind of food allergy is not evidence based and should be
reconsidered.

Editor’s key points
• The evidence for a link between allergy to certain foodstuffs
and to propofol is weak.
• The authors studied a cohort of adults being investigated
for a suspected perioperative allergic reaction.
• Separately they analysed anaesthetic charts of other pa-
tients recently diagnosed with food allergies.
• They found no evidence of a link between propofol allergy
and allergy to soy, peanut or egg.
Propofol is frequently used for induction and maintenance of gen-
eral anaesthesia and is also a commonly used sedative for short
procedures and in intensive care units.1 It is marketed as an emul-
sion containing soybean oil, egg lecithin and glycerol.1 Initially no
contraindications were stated in product leaflets, but in recent
years contraindications against its use in individuals allergic to
soy, peanut and egg lecithin have emerged in many countries.2
Allergic reactions to propofol are rare, with a previously esti-
mated incidence of 1:60.000 exposures.3 Several cases of allergic
reactions to propofol have been published,4–10 with no mention of

 egg, soy or peanut allergy. There are six published case reports of
suspected allergy to propofol in individuals allergic to egg, soy or
peanut.11–15 However, these are lacking confirmatory evidence,
as skin tests or intravenous provocations with propofol were ei-
ther not performed or found negative, except in one case.15
Although British and French guidelines state that there is no
evidence that propofol should be avoided in patients allergic to
egg or soy, they still suggest caution.16 17 Conflicting statements
and lack of evidence lead to confusion among clinicians, thus
the aims of this study were to examine the frequency of con-
firmed propofol allergy and concomitant allergy to egg, soy or
peanut and to investigate if patients with suspected food allergy
and specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) to egg, soy or peanut had
subsequently tolerated propofol.
Methods
There was no overlap between the cohorts in study A and B.
Study A
A retrospective study of 273 patients investigated in the Danish
Anaesthesia Allergy Centre (DAAC) during 2004–11 due to a sus-
pected perioperative allergic reaction. Of these, 153 (56%) had
been exposed to propofol. All patients investigated in the DAAC
have their charts reviewed and are then subjected to a standar-
dised investigation program testing all drugs and substances
they have been exposed to if one of the following criteria apply
to the suspected reaction: intravenous exposure <1 h before
onset of reaction or other exposures (oral, subcutaneous, local,
epidural, spinal etc.) <2 h before onset of reaction. If there is a
positive reaction to a drug or substance, then investigations for
other drugs/substances are continued, as a small number of pa-
tients react to more than one agent.
The investigation programme included the following tests:
• Serum tryptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Uppsala, Sweden).
Tryptase is released from mast cells during an IgE-mediated
allergic reaction and is used to help confirm an allergic mech-
anism. Values at the time of reaction should always be com-
pared with the patient’s own baseline value.18
• Specific IgE (ImmunoCAP method, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Uppsala, Sweden). This test measures IgE antibodies in the
blood directed at a specific allergen. Values >0.35 kUA litre−1
are considered positive.
• Skin prick test (SPT). This is a skin test carried out in duplicate
on the forearm. Negative control tests are made with saline
and positive control tests with histamine. Development of a
wheal ≥3 mm in diameter after 20 min is considered positive.
• Intradermal test (IDT). This is a skin test carried out in dupli-
cate on the back. Negative control test is made with saline.
The test is considered positive when a wheal develops with
a mean diameter ≥ twice the diameter of the negative control
after 20 min.
• Intravenous provocation tests. Provocation tests are per-
formed for all substances to which the patient was exposed
(except for neuromuscular blocking agents, chlorhexidine
and latex). The agent most likely to have been responsible
for the reaction is tested last. Propofol provocation tests com-
prise a three-step titrated i.v. provocation up to a maximum
dose of 10 mg propofol. A provocation test is considered posi-
tive when symptoms from the initial reaction are reproduced.
The maximum skin test concentrations of propofol used in SPT
and IDT were recommended by the French anaesthesia allergy
guidelines from 200219 and are still used today.20 Investigations
are carried out in a highly specialised setting with resuscitation
facilities and anaesthetic personnel available and continuous mon-
itoring of patients during provocations. All patients have intraven-
ous access. For the first years in the DAAC, all investigation
modalities were carried out for all drugs to gather information on
the sensitivity and specificity of the individual tests. Since 2014, a
drug is defined as being responsible for an allergic reaction if at
least two of the following tests are positive: SPT, IDT, specific IgE
or drug provocation tests.21 22 If two of the first three tests are posi-
tive, then drug provocation tests are no longer performed.
Study B
A retrospective study was conducted including all patients ≥16 yr
of age tested for specific IgE to egg, soy or peanut as part of inves-
tigations for suspected food allergy in the Allergy Clinic at Gen-
tofte Hospital during 2004–12. Approval was obtained from the
local research ethics committee to contact patients and send
them a questionnaire. Data storage was approved by the national
Data Protection Agency.
A total of 1290 patients were included in study B (see Fig. 1). Of
these, 544 patients had positive specific IgE for egg and/or soy
and/or peanut. Specific IgE values >0.35 kUA litre−1 were consid-
ered positive and defined as a sign of allergic sensitisation. Onset
of sensitisation was therefore defined as the time of positive spe-
cific IgE analysis. A total of 24 patients were excluded due to
death, emigration or mismatch between patient identification
and blood sample. Thus a questionnaire was sent to 520 patients.
The questionnaire included questions on allergic symptoms
when eating egg, soy or peanut; history of previous surgery and
anaesthesia; and a request for consent to collect anaesthetic
charts and recovery notes from previous surgeries and anaesthe-
sia. If patients did not reply, an attempt was made to contact
them by phone and subsequently one reminder was sent ∼2
months after the initial letter.
When a positive reply was received, the patient’s records were
identified based on information from the questionnaire; in add-
ition, the National Patient Identification System was searched.
Anaesthetic charts and recovery notes were retrieved for surger-
ies taking place both before and after the onset of sensitisation.
Anaesthetic charts and recovery notes from previous surger-
ies were reviewed to look for any indication of an allergic reac-
tion. An allergic reaction was considered possible if one of the
following criteria was met: a written comment about a specific
allergic symptom (e.g. skin rash or pruritus) or a mention of
suspicion of an allergic reaction on the anaesthetic chart or post-
operative notes or administration of antihistamines, corticoster-
oids or epinephrine during surgery or in the postoperative period.
Pretreatment with antihistamines was also noted, as this might
potentially mask a minor allergic reaction.
Results
Study A
The 153 patients exposed to propofol before the suspected peri-
operative allergic reaction underwent standardised investigations
for all drugs and substances they had been exposed to, including
propofol. SPT was performed in 152 (99%) patients (one missing
data) and 149 of 153 (97%) had IDT performed with propofol. Intra-
venous provocation was performed in 133 of 153 patients (87%).
Of the 153 patients exposed to propofol, only 4 (2.6%) tested
positive for propofol on one or more of the tests performed. All

 four tested negative to other drugs and substances they had been
exposed to prior to the perioperative reaction. See Table 1 for clin-
ical details and investigation results for these four patients. All
four had positive intravenous provocation leading to reproduc-
tion of hypersensitivity symptoms experienced during the ori-
ginal reaction, mainly pruritus, flushing and swelling. Only one
patient had positive skin tests and an elevated serum tryptase,
which might indicate an IgE-mediated allergy to propofol.
When questioned, none of the four patients reported clinical re-
actions to egg, soy or peanut and all had negative specific IgE for
egg or soy.
Study B
The results of study B are shown in the flowchart in Fig. 1. Of 1290
patients tested for specific IgE to egg, soy or peanut, 544 (42%) had
one or more positive tests [egg 140 patients (26%), soy 212 pa-
tients (39%), peanut 466 patients (86%)]. In total, 24 patients
died, emigrated or were not found. A total of 410 of 520 patients
(79%) with IgE to egg and/or soy and/or peanut responded to
the questionnaire. The gender and age distribution for the 410 re-
sponders was 154 males (38%) with a mean age of 39 yr (range 16–
78) and 256 females (62%) with a mean age of 40 yr (range 16–81).
In the group of 110 non-responders, 48 were male (44%; mean age
34 yr) and 62 were female (56%; mean age 34 yr). Of the 410 re-
sponders, 180 (44%) had clinical allergy, i.e. reported allergic
symptoms when eating one or more of egg (28%), soy (33%) or
peanut (76%). The remaining 230 patients (56%) did not recall
having any allergic symptoms to egg, soy or peanut. A total of
152 patients reported having a procedure involving general an-
aesthesia performed between 1986 and 2012. We were able to re-
trieve anaesthetic charts from 214 procedures performed on 115
patients (76%). Of the 214 procedures, propofol was used in 171
(80%), exposing in total 99 of 115 patients. Of the 99 exposed pa-
tients, 44 (44%) reported having a clinical allergy to egg and/or soy
and/or peanut.
Of the 171 procedures using propofol, 65 were performed (in
39 patients) after identified egg, soy or peanut sensitisation. Ex-
posure was repeated (on average 2.8 times) in 13 patients. Of
the 39 patients, 5 reported a clinical allergy to egg, 6 to soy and
8 to peanut (of those, 4 reported more than one clinical allergy).
None of the anaesthetic charts or postoperative notes for the
171 procedures using propofol included any remarks indicating
possible allergic reactions.
In 17 cases, one of the criteria for a possible allergic reaction
was met. None of them were considered relevant and, all to-
gether, no indication of an allergic reaction was found:
• In 10 cases, antihistamine pretreatment was given due to
other known allergies, thus masking of a potential allergic re-
action cannot be ruled out but is considered unlikely.
• In 3 cases, corticosteroid was given during anaesthesia on
specific non-allergic indications, such as to reduce post-
operative oedema.

 • In 3 cases, pruritus was noted in the chart. There were no as-
sociated objective symptoms in any of the cases, and pruritus
started shortly after injection of an opioid, which has pruritus
as a well-known side effect.
• In 1 case, antihistamine was given at the end of anaesthesia.
There was no indication of an allergic reaction and it is
thought it was given as an antiemetic.
In 43 of the 214 (20%) anaesthetic procedures propofol was not
administered. In 12 procedures the anaesthetists had specifically
noted that propofol was avoided due to the patient’s presumed
allergy to egg, soy or peanut. For 10 of the 12 procedures, the pa-
tient had reported clinical symptoms of egg and/or soy and/or
peanut allergy. The last two procedures were performed in one
patient, who had positive specific IgE for soy and peanut but tol-
erated eating egg, soy and peanut on a daily basis.
Discussion
The discussion about whether propofol should be administered
to egg-, soy- and peanut-allergic patients continues in many
countries.11–15 24 25 There are inconsistencies regarding contrain-
dications when comparing product leaflets in different countries.
Warnings against the use of propofol in patients allergic to soy,
peanut and excipients (egg lecithin, soybean oil, glycerol, sodium
hydroxide, water, disodiumetate) are found in Denmark and the
UK. In contrast, warnings in the USA only mention patients aller-
gic to egg, soy or excipients, with no warnings against using pro-
pofol in patients allergic to peanuts.
In Denmark, over the past few years, increasing concern about
the use of propofol in patients with egg, soy or peanut allergy has
been reflected in an increase in referrals to the DAAC, with specif-
ic mention of suspected allergy to propofol. This increased atten-
tion to the subject in the anaesthetic community may be due to
the introduction of nurse-administered propofol sedation
(NAPS), used for outpatient procedures such as colonoscopies,
gastroscopies, bronchoscopies etc., where rigorous checklists in-
cluding questions on allergies to egg, soy and peanut are followed
prior to starting sedation. However, allergic reactions to propofol
during NAPS are rare according to a large American study where
no allergic reactions were seen in 9152 cases of NAPS, and only 5
patients had not been given propofol, either due to preference or
to suspected allergy to components of propofol.26
Our study A of patients investigated following suspected al-
lergic reactions during general anaesthesia showed no evidence
of a connection with allergy to foods. None of the four patients
with confirmed hypersensitivity to propofol in the DAAC had
allergy to egg, soy or peanut. A very conservative estimate of
propofol use in 50% of the 450 000 anaesthetics used each year
in Denmark would suggest a total of 1.8 million exposures to
propofol in the 8 yr period investigated. This gives an estimated
incidence of propofol hypersensitivity of 2.2 per 1 million anaes-
thetics in Denmark.
In study B we examined adult patients with specific IgE to egg,
soy or peanut and exposure to propofol during general anaesthe-
sia. Despite positive specific IgE, only 44% of the patients had
clinical symptoms when eating egg, soy or peanut. No allergic re-
actions occurred during 171 procedures identified in 99 patients.
The ability to tolerate propofol was the same whether or not pa-
tients reported clinical symptoms of egg, soy or peanut allergy.
Also, there was no difference in tolerance regarding first exposure
vs re-exposure.
Taken together, our studies of patients undergoing general
anaesthesia show no evidence in support of a connection be-
tween allergy to propofol and allergy to egg, soy or peanut. Re-
cently, two studies examining patients undergoing sedation
with propofol have reached the same conclusion. A Spanish
study from 2014 investigated 60 eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)
patients who had 404 upper endoscopies performed under pro-
pofol sedation. Fifty-two (86%) of the patients had egg, soy or pea-
nut sensitisation confirmed by either specific IgE or SPT (only 35%
reported clinical allergy). There were no allergic reactions and the
researchers concluded that propofol can be safely administered
to EoE patients regardless of documented sensitisation to egg,
soy or peanut.25
The other study, from Australia, examined the use of propofol
in 28 egg-allergic children undergoing 43 propofol sedations.
They found one reaction with generalised erythema and urticaria

 in a boy with a history of egg anaphylaxis and multiple other IgE-
mediated food allergies. The SPT with propofol was 3 mm and
was concluded to be positive. The authors conclude that propofol
is likely to be safe in the majority of children allergic to egg.27
The conclusion that propofol administration is safe in patients
with allergy to egg, soy or peanut is further supported by examin-
ing the evidence for the suggested mechanism of propofol allergy.
Most cases of allergy to propofol are thought to be IgE mediated3
and the 2-isopropyl-group of the propofol molecule have been sus-
pected asthe reactive epitopes.4 5 28In accordancewith this, several
case reports on anaphylaxis or adverse reactions caused by propo-
fol did not even mention egg, soy or peanut allergy.6–10
Three of the four patients in our study had negative skin tests
and did not have elevated tryptase at the time of reaction. This
suggests a non-IgE-mediated or even non-allergenic mechanism
and underlines the need to perform intravenous provocation, as
propofol hypersensitivity would have otherwise been missed in
these three patients. The fourth patient had elevated tryptase
at the time of reaction and positive skin tests to propofol,
which is more suggestive of an IgE-mediated mechanism.
Evidence of the allergenic potential of the soy or egg compo-
nents of propofol is lacking. Soy allergy is rare and tolerance is
often achieved in late childhood.29 Propofol contains refined soy-
bean oil, but the allergenic proteins are removed during the refin-
ing process.30
Egg allergy is mainly seen in children and is usually out-
grown.31 Egg-allergic patients typically react to proteins from
egg whites (ovalbumin, ovomucoid and conalbumin) and not to
egg lecithin, from the egg yolk, which is used in propofol.30–32 De-
wachter and colleagues24 showed that SPT with propofol and egg
lecithin were negative in 10 children with clinical egg allergy and
SPT with propofol and soybean oil were negative in 3 patients
with documented soy allergy.
Regarding suggested cross-reactivity between peanut and
soy, a review article from 20002 reported a low rate of cross-re-
activity. Considering the lack of reported reactions to propofol
from the USA, where peanut allergy is common, it is unlikely
that the presumed cross-reactivity between soy and peanut has
any clinical relevance with respect to propofol allergy.
Interestingly, our study showed that a group of patients were
actually deprived of propofol due to sensitisation/allergy to egg,
soy or peanut, even though propofol might have been the best
choice for the patient. This was mainly the case with patients
who reported clinical allergy. However, one patient was deprived
of propofol due to positive specific IgE, despite the fact that she
tolerated eating egg, soy and peanut. Taken together, there is
no real evidence of a mechanistic connection between propofol
hypersensitivity and allergy to egg, soy or peanut.
Our studies have some limitations. Study B is a retrospective
study and excludes children <16 yr of age, so we cannot draw any
conclusions with regard to children and propofol.
It might be argued that our patients may have lost their clin-
ical allergy in the time from IgE testing to propofol exposure. This
gap was a maximum of 8 yr, but less than 3 yr for the majority of
patients. This, combined with the fact that allergy to egg and soy
is mostly outgrown in the teenage years, makes it unlikely to
have influenced our study.
Ideally, conclusions on clinical allergy should be based on
provocation with egg, soy and peanut rather than patient’s recall
of clinical allergy. As this was not possible, we instead used posi-
tive specific IgE as a sign of allergic sensitisation. However, not all
patients with allergic sensitisation (shown by positive specific IgE
or SPT) have clinical allergy. For this reason, we chose to report
both IgE sensitisation and self-reported clinical allergy.
Different formulations of propofol have been used during
the period of investigation. It would have been relevant to
examine if hypersensitivity reactions were related to specific
formulations of propofol (e.g. LCT vs LCT-MCT propofol). Unfor-
tunately, this was not possible since the specific formulation is
rarely mentioned in referrals (in study A) or on anaesthetic
charts (in study B).
Lastly, the fact that antihistamine was administered pre-
operatively in 10 of our 171 cases in study B might have masked
mild allergic symptoms. However, it is unlikely that pre-adminis-
tered antihistamine would mask IgE-mediated anaphylaxis.17
In conclusion, neither of our studies support a connection be-
tween propofol hypersensitivity and allergy to egg, soy or peanut.
This, combined with a very weak evidence base in the literature
and recent studies showing patients tolerating propofol sedation
despite allergy to egg, soy or peanut, suggests that propofol can
be administered to these patients in all doses. Therefore the in-
creasing practice of anaesthetists choosing alternatives to propo-
fol in patients with this kind of food allergy is not evidence based
and manufacturers of propofol should consider revising their
current contraindications to propofol administration in patients
allergic to egg, soy or peanut.
