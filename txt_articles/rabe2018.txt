BACKGROUND
Dupilumab is a fully human anti–interleukin-4 receptor α monoclonal antibody 
that blocks both interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signaling. Its effectiveness in re-
ducing oral glucocorticoid use in patients with severe asthma while maintaining 
asthma control is unknown.
METHODS
We randomly assigned 210 patients with oral glucocorticoid–treated asthma to re-
ceive add-on dupilumab (at a dose of 300 mg) or placebo every 2 weeks for 24 weeks. 
After a glucocorticoid dose-adjustment period before randomization, glucocorti-
coid doses were adjusted in a downward trend from week 4 to week 20 and then 
maintained at a stable dose for 4 weeks. The primary end point was the percentage 
reduction in the glucocorticoid dose at week 24. Key secondary end points were the 
proportion of patients at week 24 with a reduction of at least 50% in the glucocor-
ticoid dose and the proportion of patients with a reduction to a glucocorticoid dose 
of less than 5 mg per day. Severe exacerbation rates and the forced expiratory volume 
in 1 second (FEV1) before bronchodilator use were also assessed.
RESULTS
The percentage change in the glucocorticoid dose was −70.1% in the dupilumab group, 
as compared with −41.9% in the placebo group (P<0.001); 80% versus 50% of the 
patients had a dose reduction of at least 50%, 69% versus 33% had a dose reduc-
tion to less than 5 mg per day, and 48% versus 25% completely discontinued oral 
glucocorticoid use. Despite reductions in the glucocorticoid dose, in the overall popu-
lation, dupilumab treatment resulted in a severe exacerbation rate that was 59% 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 37 to 74) lower than that in the placebo group and 
resulted in an FEV1 that was 0.22 liters (95% CI, 0.09 to 0.34) higher. Injection-site 
reactions were more common with dupilumab than with placebo (9% vs. 4%). 
Transient blood eosinophilia was observed in more patients in the dupilumab group 
than in the placebo group (14% vs. 1%).
CONCLUSIONS
In patients with glucocorticoid-dependent severe asthma, dupilumab treatment re-
duced oral glucocorticoid use while decreasing the rate of severe exacerbations and 
increasing the FEV1. Transient eosinophilia was observed in approximately 1 in 7 du-
pilumab-treated patients. (Funded by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals;

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
A 
n estimated 45% of patients with 
severe asthma use systemic glucocorti-
coids to control the disease and prevent 
exacerbations.1-3 However, systemic glucocorticoids 
act nonselectively and are associated with con-
siderable multiorgan toxic effects and broad im-
munosuppression.4,5 The use of the currently 
approved biologic agents mepolizumab and ben-
ralizumab with anti–interleukin-5 mechanisms 
has shown oral glucocorticoid–sparing effects in 
patients with severe asthma.6,7 Biologic agents 
targeting other cytokines may also be oral glu-
cocorticoid–sparing while providing a favorable 
safety profile and further improvement in lung 
function and control of exacerbations and asthma 
symptoms.
Patients with glucocorticoid-dependent asthma 
may present with type 2 inflammatory disease, as 
shown by elevated levels in the fraction of ex-
haled nitric oxide (FeNO), IgE, and other type 2 
inflammation biomarkers.8 Dupilumab is a fully 
human, VelocImmune-derived monoclonal anti-
body directed against the alpha subunit of the 
interleukin-4–receptor component that is com-
mon to signal transduction for both interleukin-4 
and interleukin-13, and dupilumab treatment has 
the capacity to reduce type 2 inflammation.9 Du-
pilumab treatment has been shown to reduce the 
rate of exacerbations and improve lung function 
in patients with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe 
asthma.10,11 In this phase 3 trial, LIBERTY ASTHMA 
VENTURE, we assessed the efficacy and safety 
of dupilumab, as compared with placebo, in re-
ducing the maintenance dose of oral glucocorti-
coids in patients with glucocorticoid-dependent 
severe asthma.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
In this international, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we assessed the 
efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients with 
oral glucocorticoid–dependent severe asthma. 
Patients completed an oral glucocorticoid dose-
adjustment period lasting 3 to 10 weeks, followed 
by 1:1 randomization to receive dupilumab or pla-
cebo for a 24-week intervention period. The 24-week 
intervention period consisted of a 4-week induc-
tion period, during which the adjusted oral gluco-
corticoid dose was continued; a 16-week period of 
reduction in oral glucocorticoid use (weeks 4 to 20), 
during which the glucocorticoid dose was adjusted 
down every 4 weeks according to a protocol-
prespecified algorithm; and a 4-week mainte-
nance period, during which patients continued 
the glucocorticoid dose that was established at 
week 20; the 24-week intervention period was 
followed by a 12-week evaluation period (Fig. S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix, available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Full 
details regarding the trial design are provided in 
Section 2 in the Supplementary Appendix; the pro-
tocol (with the statistical analysis plan) is also 
available at NEJM.org. Eligible patients who com-
pleted the trial regimen were permitted to enter a 
long-term, open-label extension study.
The protocol was developed by the sponsors 
(Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals). Data 
were collected by the investigators and analyzed 
by the sponsors. The trial was conducted in ac-
cordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, with 
the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the In-
ternational Conference on Harmonisation, and 
with applicable regulatory requirements. An in-
dependent data and safety monitoring commit-
tee conducted blinded monitoring of patients’ 
safety data (Section 2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). The local institutional review board or 
ethics committee at each center oversaw trial con-
duct and documentation. All the patients provided 
written informed consent before participating in 
the trial. Patients younger than 18 years of age 
provided assent according to the ethics commit-
tee–approved standard practice for pediatric pa-
tients at each participating center.
All the authors participated in the interpreta-
tion of the data and provided input into the draft-
ing of the manuscript, critical feedback, and final 
approval for submission of the manuscript for 
publication. The authors take responsibility for 
the accuracy and completeness of the data and 
analyses and vouch for the fidelity of the trial to 
the protocol. All the investigators had confiden-
tiality agreements with the sponsors. The drafts 
of the manuscript were prepared with the assis-
tance of a medical writer paid by the sponsors.

Dupilumab in Glucocorticoid-Dependent Severe Asthma
guidelines12 and who had been receiving treatment 
with regular systemic glucocorticoids in the pre-
vious 6 months (5 to 35 mg per day of prednisone 
or prednisolone or equivalent) were eligible to 
participate. During the 4 weeks before screening, 
their treatment had to also include a high-dose 
inhaled glucocorticoid (fluticasone propionate at 
a total daily dose of >500 μg or equipotent equiv-
alent) in combination with up to two controllers 
(i.e., a long-acting β2-agonist or leukotriene-recep-
tor antagonist) for at least 3 months. Eligible pa-
tients had to have a forced expiratory volume in 
1 second (FEV1) before bronchodilator use of 80% 
or less of the predicted normal value (or ≤90% 
of the predicted normal value in adolescents),13 
FEV1 reversibility of at least 12% and 200 ml, or 
airway hyperresponsiveness documented in the 
12 months before screening visit 1. Patients were 
recruited with no minimum requirement regard-
ing a baseline blood or sputum eosinophil count 
or any other type 2 biomarkers (i.e., FeNO or IgE). 
A complete list of the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria is provided in Section 3 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix.
Trial Regimens and Procedures
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive subcutaneous dupilumab (at a dose of 
300 mg, after the receipt of a 600-mg loading dose 
on day 1) as add-on therapy or matched placebo 
every 2 weeks. Randomization was conducted by 
means of interactive voice–Web response technol-
ogy, and patients were stratified according to the 
adjusted oral glucocorticoid dose (≤10 mg per day 
vs. >10 mg per day of prednisone or prednisolone) 
and country. In patients who had been using other 
oral glucocorticoids, these agents were switched to 
a clinically comparable dose of prednisone or 
prednisolone during the screening period.
The adjusted oral glucocorticoid dose was de-
fined as the lowest dose that a patient could receive 
without having an increase of 0.5 (i.e., the minimal 
clinically important difference) or more in the 
5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5) 
score (global scores range from 0 to 6, with higher 
scores indicating less asthma control),14,15 a severe 
exacerbation, or any clinically significant event 
leading to an upward adjustment in the oral glu-
cocorticoid dose. During the dose-reduction phase, 
the oral glucocorticoid dose was reduced every 
4 weeks to minimize the risk of clinically signifi-
cant events and carryover effects from the previous 
dose. No dose adjustments were allowed beyond 
week 20 except for safety reasons. Background 
asthma controllers were continued at a stable dose, 
and the use of a short-acting β2-agonist was per-
mitted as needed for asthma symptoms. Full de-
tails of the methods are provided in the protocol.
End Points
The primary efficacy end point was the percent-
age reduction in the oral glucocorticoid dose from 
baseline to week 24 while asthma control was 
maintained. Between weeks 20 and 24 asthma 
control was considered to be maintained if no 
clinically significant event (on the basis of inves-
tigator judgment) leading to an upward adjustment 
in the oral glucocorticoid dose occurred. For pa-
tients who had an exacerbation, the final oral 
glucocorticoid dose was considered to be one step 
higher than the dose they had been receiving at 
the time of the exacerbation.
Key secondary efficacy end points that were as-
sessed in patients with maintained asthma control 
were the proportion of patients with a reduction 
from baseline of at least 50% in the oral glucocor-
ticoid dose and the proportion of patients who 
had a reduction in the oral glucocorticoid dose 
to less than 5 mg per day. Other secondary end 
points included the proportion of patients who 
had the maximum possible reduction in the oral 
glucocorticoid dose (in patients who began the 
trial while they were taking a glucocorticoid dose 
of 35 mg per day, the dose could not be reduced 
to <2.5 mg per day), the proportion of patients 
who no longer used oral glucocorticoids, and the 
absolute reduction in the oral glucocorticoid dose.
Other efficacy end points included the annu-
alized rate of severe exacerbation events (defined 
as events leading to hospitalization, an emergency 
department visit, or treatment for ≥3 days with 
systemic glucocorticoids at ≥2 times the current 
dose of oral glucocorticoid) during the 24-week 
intervention period; the absolute change from 
baseline in the FEV1 before bronchodilator use at 
weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24; and the change 
from baseline in the ACQ-5 score at week 24.
An exploratory end point of the absolute 
change from baseline in the FeNO level (assessed 
in parts per billion [ppb]) was assessed with the 
use of a NIOX (Aerocrine) or similar instrument 
at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. The full list

Statistical Analysis
We estimated that 90 patients randomly assigned 
to each group would provide the trial with 94% 
power (with a two-tailed test at an alpha level of 
0.05) to detect a between-group difference of 27 
percentage points in the percentage reduction in 
daily glucocorticoid dose,16 assuming a common 
standard deviation of 50%. The primary end 
point was assessed with the use of an analysis of 
covariance model. The model included the per-
centage reduction in the oral glucocorticoid dose 
at week 24 as the response variable, with trial 
group, adjusted oral glucocorticoid dose at base-
line, geographic region (pooled countries), and 
baseline eosinophil subgroups (≥150 or <150 cells 
per cubic millimeter) as covariates. The between-
group difference was tested at the two-sided al-
pha level of 0.05. For patients who discontinued 
the trial or had missing data regarding the oral 
glucocorticoid dose at week 24 in the primary 
analysis, the missing data were handled with the 
use of a pattern-mixture model by multiple im-
putations.
The key secondary and other binary second-
ary end points were analyzed with the use of 
logistic-regression models. The annualized rate 
of severe exacerbations during the 24-week in-
tervention period was analyzed with the use of a 
negative binomial regression model. A mixed-
effects model with a repeated-measures approach 
was used to analyze the changes from baseline 
in the FEV1 before bronchodilator use at various 
time points during the 24-week intervention pe-
riod and the change from baseline in the ACQ-5 
score at week 24. To control the overall type I 
error rate among the primary, key secondary, 
and the other binary secondary end points, mul-
tiple comparisons were controlled with the use 
of a prespecified hierarchical test procedure (Sec-
tion 4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The other 
efficacy end points and exploratory end points 
were not controlled for multiple comparisons and 
are presented with 95% confidence intervals.
Efficacy analyses were performed in the in-
tention-to-treat population, which included all 
the patients who underwent randomization; data 
were analyzed according to the assigned trial 
group, regardless of the trial regimen received. 
Primary and key secondary end points, FEV1, and 
rates of severe asthma exacerbations were also 
analyzed in subgroups of patients according to 
baseline blood eosinophil levels (≥300 or <300 
cells per cubic millimeter and ≥150 or <150 cells 
per cubic millimeter) and baseline FeNO level (<25 
ppb or ≥25 to <50 ppb or ≥50 ppb) to assess con-
sistency in effects across the different subgroups. 
The safety population included all the patients 
who received at least one dose or a partial dose of 
dupilumab or placebo; data were analyzed accord-
ing to the regimen received. Adverse events were 
assessed during the trial period, which was de-
fined as the time from the first administration 
of the trial regimen to the last administration of 
the trial regimen plus 98 days or until the pa-
tient entered the extension study.
All the analyses were conducted with the use 
of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute). The 
statistical methods are summarized in Section 4 
in the Supplementary Appendix.
Results
Patients
From December 2015 through September 2017, 
a total of 210 patients underwent randomization 
and received dupilumab (103 patients) or placebo 
(107) (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). A 
total of 203 patients (101 patients in the dupil-
umab group and 102 in the placebo group) com-
pleted the 24-week intervention period, and 189 
patients (93%) entered the long-term, open-label 
extension study. Two patients in the dupilumab 
group and one in the placebo group discontinued 
the trial or had missing data regarding the oral 
glucocorticoid dose at week 24. The mean dura-
tion of the trial was similar in the two groups 
(176.8 days in the dupilumab group and 176.0 days 
in the placebo group). The demographic and base-
line clinical characteristics of the patients in the 
intention-to-treat population are shown in Table 1, 
and in Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Primary Outcome
In the intention-to-treat population, the least-
squares mean (±SE) percentage change in the oral 
glucocorticoid dose from baseline to week 24, 
while asthma control was maintained, was 
−70.1±4.9% in the dupilumab group, as compared 
with −41.9±4.6% in the placebo group (P<0.001) 
(Fig. 1A, and Table S3 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). The observed median change in the oral

glucocorticoid dose from baseline to week 24 was 
−100% (interquartile range, −100 to −62.5) in the 
dupilumab group, as compared with −50% (inter-
quartile range, −100 to 0) in the placebo group.
Key Secondary Outcomes
All the binary secondary end points regarding 
reduction in the oral glucocorticoid dose, includ-
ing the key secondary and other secondary end 
points, reached statistical significance according 
to the control hierarchy for multiple comparisons. 
The model-adjusted percentage of patients who 
had a reduction from baseline of at least 50% in 
the oral glucocorticoid dose at week 24 was 80% 
in the dupilumab group versus 50% in the pla-
cebo group (P<0.001) (Table S3 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Sensitivity analyses also showed 
that the proportions of patients with reductions 
in the oral glucocorticoid dose of at least 50%, 
at least 75%, and at least 90% were greater with 
dupilumab than with placebo (Table S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The percentage of pa-
tients who had a reduction in the oral glucocor-
ticoid dose to less than 5 mg per day was 69% in 
the dupilumab group, as compared with 33% in 
the placebo group (P<0.001) (Table S3 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix).
Although there was a change in the magni-
tude of the outcome according to the blood eo-
sinophil count, dupilumab treatment was associ-
ated with a greater reduction in the dose of oral 
glucocorticoid than was placebo, regardless of the 
baseline blood eosinophil count (Fig. 2, and Ta-
ble S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The mag-

Dupilumab in Glucocorticoid-Dependent Severe Asthma
Glucocorticoid-Reduction Outcomes
A total of 52% of the patients in the dupilumab 
group no longer used oral glucocorticoids at 
week 24, as compared with 29% of those in the 
placebo group. After model adjustment, the 
corresponding values were 48% versus 25% 
(P 
= 
0.002) (Table S3 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).

Exacerbations, Lung Function,  
and Asthma Control
In addition to significant reductions in oral glu-
cocorticoid use during the 24-week intervention 
period, dupilumab treatment resulted in a 59% 
(95% CI, 37 to 74) lower rate of severe asthma 
exacerbations than placebo in the overall popu-
lation (Fig. S3 and Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). In the overall population, the FEV1 was 
higher in the dupilumab group than in the placebo 
group at week 24 by a least-squares mean value 
of 0.22 liters (95% CI, 0.09 to 0.34) (Fig. 1B, and 
Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Although dupilumab treatment resulted in a 
lower annualized rate of severe asthma exacerba-
tions and a higher FEV1 than placebo, regardless 
of the baseline blood eosinophil count (Fig. S4 
and Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix), 
these benefits were more pronounced in patients 
with a higher baseline blood eosinophil count and 
in those with a higher FeNO level at baseline (Table 
S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). For example, 
among patients with a baseline blood eosinophil 
count of 300 or more cells per cubic millimeter, 
dupilumab treatment resulted in a rate of severe 
asthma exacerbations that was 71% (95% CI, 40 
to 86) lower than the rate in the placebo group 
and in an FEV1 that was higher by a least-squares 
mean value of 0.32 liters (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.54). 
Among patients with a baseline blood eosinophil 
count of less than 150 cells per cubic millimeter, 
dupilumab treatment resulted in a rate of severe 
asthma exacerbations that was 60% (95% CI, 5 to 
83) lower than the rate with placebo and in an 
FEV1 that was higher by a least-squares mean 
value of 0.24 liters (95% CI, 0.05 to 0.44). In-
creases in the FEV1 in patients treated with 
du 
pil 
umab were noted as early as week 2 (least-
squares mean change, 0.15 liters; 95% CI, 0.04 
to 0.26) and showed a further increase through 
week 24 (Fig. 1B, and Table S3 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
The ACQ-5 scores at week 24 indicated an 
improvement in asthma control with dupilumab, 
as compared with placebo. The least-squares mean 
difference between the dupilumab group and the 
placebo group in the score change from baseline 
was −0.47 (95% CI, −0.76 to −0.18).
Exploratory Outcome of FeNO Level
Dupilumab treatment resulted in a suppression in 
the FeNO level by week 2, which was sustained dur-
ing the 24-week intervention period (Fig. S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The percentage of pa-
tients with an FeNO level of less than 25 ppb (the 
upper limit of the normal range)17 increased from 
44% at baseline to 84% at week 24 in the dupil-
umab group, whereas no meaningful change was 
observed in the placebo group (45% at both time 
points) (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Safety
In the safety population, the incidence of adverse 
events during the trial period was similar in the 
two groups (62% in the dupilumab group and 64% 
in the placebo group) (Table 2). According to the 
preferred terms in the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities, version 20.0, the most fre-
quent adverse events (i.e., those occurring in at 
least 5% of the patients in either group) were viral 
upper respiratory tract infection (9% of the patients 
in the dupilumab group vs. 18% of those in the 
placebo group), bronchitis (7% vs. 6%), sinusitis 
(7% vs. 4%), influenza (3% vs. 6%), and the labo-
ratory measure of eosinophilia (grouped as the 
preferred terms of eosinophil count increase and 
eosinophilia) (14% vs. 1%). Injection-site reactions 
were observed in 9% of the patients in the dupil-
umab group and in 4% of those in the placebo 
group. Per the trial protocol, all cases of an eo-
sinophil count of more than 3000 cells per cubic 
millimeter during the trial period were reported 
as adverse events; this event occurred in 13% of 
the patients in the dupilumab group versus 1% 
of those in the placebo group. The reported ad-
verse events of eosinophilia were all exclusively 
laboratory findings without any clinical conse-
quences or associated adverse events.
Serious adverse events during the trial period 
were reported in nine patients (9%) in the dupil-
umab group and in six (6%) in the placebo group. 
There were no deaths during the trial. Antidrug-
antibody responses during the trial period were 
observed in five patients in each group (5% of the 
patients in the dupilumab group and 5% of those 
in the placebo group) and had no meaningful ef-
fect on efficacy or safety. During the trial period, 
no adverse events of conjunctivitis were observed 
in either group.

therapy significantly reduced oral glucocorticoid

Dupilumab in Glucocorticoid-Dependent Severe Asthma
use in patients with oral glucocorticoid–depen-
dent severe asthma. In the overall population, du-
pilumab treatment resulted in a rate of severe 
asthma exacerbations that was 59% lower than 
that in the placebo group and in an FEV1 that 
was 0.22 liters higher. Among patients with a 
baseline blood eosinophil count of 300 or more 
cells per cubic millimeter, dupilumab treatment 
led to a 71% lower rate of exacerbations than 
placebo and an FEV1 that was 0.32 liters higher. 
In this trial, patients in the placebo group also 
had a 41.9% reduction in the oral glucocorticoid 
dose. Better adherence to drug regimens in the 
context of a clinical trial may have contributed 
to this observation, but even with this level of 
placebo effect, patients in the dupilumab group 
had a significant additional benefit regarding 
multiple measures of asthma control.
Dupilumab treatment showed positive efficacy 
on the basis of multiple asthma-outcome mea-
sures in the overall trial population regardless of 
the baseline blood eosinophil count. Among pa-
tients with a baseline blood eosinophil count of 
less than 150 cells per cubic millimeter, 75% of 
the patients in the dupilumab group had a reduc-
tion in their oral glucocorticoid dose of 50%, 
and 62% of the patients had a reduction in the 
oral glucocorticoid dose to less than 5 mg per day. 
In the large, phase 3 LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST 
trial, which studied the efficacy and safety of dupil-
umab and the results of which are now reported 
in the Journal, treatment with dupilumab also re-
duced the rate of severe exacerbations and showed 
a rapid and sustained improvement in lung func-
tion.18 In both the LIBERTY ASTHMA VENTURE 
trial and the LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST trial, as 
well as in the earlier pivotal study,10 the most ro-
bust results were observed in patients with height-
ened type 2 immune activity, including elevated 
blood eosinophil counts and FeNO level.
Dupilumab treatment reduced FeNO levels con-
current with a significant reduction in oral glu-
cocorticoid use. Unlike with anti–interleukin-5 
therapies,19 a reduction in the FeNO level has been 
observed in all previous trials of dupilumab in 
patients with asthma,10,11 a finding that is con-

sistent with the mechanism of action of dupil-
umab. These findings suggest that dupilumab in-
hibits type 2 inflammation more broadly than 
targeting eosinophils alone.
Dupilumab treatment was associated with 
transient eosinophilia, which was observed in 
14% of the patients in the dupilumab group. 
Patients in the dupilumab group had a greater 
mean transient increase from baseline in blood 
eosinophil counts than those in the placebo 
group, with a higher percentage of patients (13%) 
having an eosinophil count of more than 3000 
cells per cubic millimeter. The high blood eosino-
phil counts returned to baseline levels by the 
end of the dupil 
umab treatment period. Patients 
with transient elevations in the blood eosino-
phil counts did not have concomitant clinical 
adverse events or consequences. The increase in 
the blood eosinophil counts is consistent with 
the hypothesis that dupilumab blocks the migra-
tion of eosinophils into tissue by inhibiting in-
terleukin-4– and interleukin-13–mediated pro-
duction of eotaxins (as suggested by a reduction 
in the serum eotaxin-3 level18) and vascular-cell 
adhesion molecule 120,21 but not eosinophil pro-
duction or egress from bone marrow. This action 
results in a transient increase in circulating 
eosinophil counts — a finding consistent with 
other clinical studies of dupilumab.22 Since gluco-
corticoids suppress circulating eosinophils, the 
greater reduction in the oral glucocorticoid dose 
in the dupilumab group than in the placebo 
group could also have contributed to the eleva-
tions in the eosinophil counts. No adverse events 
of conjunctivitis during the 24-week interven-
tion period were observed in either group, in 
contrast to findings in studies of dupilumab in 
patients with atopic dermatitis.23-25
In conclusion, add-on therapy with dupilumab 
significantly reduced the oral glucocorticoid dose 
while simultaneously reducing the rate of severe 
exacerbations and improving lung function (FEV1) 
in patients with glucocorticoid-dependent severe 
asthma.
