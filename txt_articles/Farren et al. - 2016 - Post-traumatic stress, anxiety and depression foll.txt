ABSTRACT
Objectives: This is a pilot study to investigate the
type and severity of emotional distress in women after
early pregnancy loss (EPL), compared with a control
group with ongoing pregnancies. The secondary aim
was to assess whether miscarriage or ectopic
pregnancy impacted differently on the type and severity
of psychological morbidity.
Design: This was a prospective survey study.
Consecutive women were recruited between January
2012 and July 2013. We emailed women a link to a
survey 1, 3 and 9 months after a diagnosis of EPL,
and 1 month after the diagnosis of a viable ongoing
pregnancy.
Setting: The Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit
(EPAU) of a central London teaching hospital.
Participants: We recruited 186 women. 128 had a
diagnosis of EPL, and 58 of ongoing pregnancies. 11
withdrew consent, and 11 provided an illegible or
invalid email address.
Main outcome measures: Post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) was measured using the Post-
traumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), and anxiety and
depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale (HADS).
Results: Response rates were 69/114 at 1 month and
44/68 at 3 months in the EPL group, and 20/50 in
controls. Psychological morbidity was higher in the
EPL group with 28% meeting the criteria for probable
PTSD, 32% for anxiety and 16% for depression at
1 month and 38%, 20% and 5%, respectively, at
3 months. In the control group, no women met criteria
for PTSD and 10% met criteria for anxiety and
depression. There was little difference in type or
severity of distress following ectopic pregnancy or
miscarriage.
Conclusions: We have shown a large number
of women having experienced a miscarriage or
ectopic pregnancy fulfil the diagnostic criteria for
probable PTSD. Many suffer from moderate-to-
severe anxiety, and a lesser number depression.
Psychological morbidity, and in particular PTSD
symptoms, persists at least 3 months following
pregnancy loss.
INTRODUCTION
Early pregnancy loss (EPL) is common, with
miscarriage affecting 25% of women who
have been pregnant by the age of 39, consti-
tuting 12–20% of all pregnancies.1 Ectopic
pregnancy (defined as the development of a
pregnancy outside the uterine cavity, usually
within the fallopian tube) is less common,
thought to occur in ∼1% of pregnancies.2
The psychological consequences associated
with an EPL cannot necessarily be extrapo-
lated from our understanding of grief reac-
tions in other contexts. They encompass
both bereavement, and an often traumatic
(and in some cases life-threatening) personal
physical experience. They can pose a poten-
tial threat to the dream or expectation to
have a family. In contrast to other losses,
there are no standardised rituals to manage
grief, and there is often no physical manifest-
ation of the loss to mourn. Societal norms
may also encourage privacy, which may trans-
late
into
less
support
from
friends
or
colleagues.
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ We have used validated instruments to obtain
quantitative data on mental well-being after early
pregnancy loss.
▪ We have included women who have suffered
both miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies.
▪ In addition to anxiety and depression we have
tested for the probable presence or absence of
post-traumatic stress disorder.
▪ The main limitation of this study was the
dropout rate for responses at 1 month and in
our control group.
▪ While it is a strength that we have included a
control group, a potential weakness is that these
were women who were attending an early preg-
nancy unit for assessment.

 Previous studies evaluating the immediate psycho-
logical impact of miscarriage have shown a significant
proportion of women meet the criteria for depression
(27%) and anxiety (28–41%).3–5 Such symptoms decline
over time, to levels equivalent to the non-pregnant
population
at
1 year.6
In
general,
anxiety
is
more
marked than depression.7 8
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may develop in
response to experiencing a real or perceived threat of
death or injury to oneself or others. In the context of
EPL, the threat of serious injury, sight of blood or fetal
tissue, or subjective perception of experiencing the
death of a baby may be sufficiently traumatic to result in
PTSD. In previous studies, women have rated EPL as
their worst lifetime exposure to trauma.9 There are few
data relating to PTSD and miscarriage. In one prospect-
ive study involving 113 women, 25% met the criteria
according to the self-report symptom scale for PTSD at
1 month,
and
7%
4 months
following
an
EPL.10
However, this study included late pregnancy losses, so it
is not possible to establish the prevalence of PTSD after
a loss in early pregnancy from these results.
There are few published data evaluating psychological
morbidity following ectopic pregnancy. One retrospect-
ive study has suggested there may be an association
between
surgically
treated
ectopic
pregnancies
and
suicide.11
Ectopic
pregnancy
is
a
potentially
life-
threatening condition that is more likely to lead to emer-
gency hospital admission and surgical intervention,
where the pregnancy loss is often treated as secondary.
Furthermore, ectopic pregnancy is frequently associated
with a threat to future fertility. Given this enhanced
threat of physical harm in addition to the EPL itself, it
might be expected that the psychological consequences
are different.
An understanding of the type and frequency of emo-
tional reactions to pregnancy loss is important in order
to target appropriate support to those that need it,
thereby minimising psychological morbidity and its soci-
etal cost. In the current study, the primary aim was to
assess the symptoms of PTSD, anxiety and depression in
women following EPL compared with a control group of
women with ongoing viable pregnancies. The secondary
aim was to evaluate whether there was any evidence to
suggest different levels of PTSD, anxiety and depression
symptomatology in women who had suffered a miscar-
riage compared with those with an ectopic pregnancy. A
final aim was to explore the feasibility and sample size
required for a larger study to assess for risk factors,
which could be used to target screening or treatment of
psychiatric morbidity in this context.
METHODS
Design
We recruited women presenting to the Early Pregnancy
Assessment Unit
(EPAU) at Queen Charlottes and
Chelsea hospital, which is a central London university
teaching hospital. Women attended the unit because of
bleeding and/or pain, or for reassurance or dating. The
data represent a pilot to demonstrate the feasibility of,
and provide data from which to derive the sample size
for, a larger study examining risk factors for the develop-
ment of psychological morbidity following EPL.
On the days on which the study investigators were
available (an average of one-half day per week), consecu-
tive women were approached for recruitment. Initially,
we approached all women who had been diagnosed on
the basis of a transvaginal ultrasound scan as having an
ectopic
pregnancy
or
miscarriage.
Women
were
approached on the day of their diagnosis, or at subse-
quent follow-up visit. Following a change in the study
protocol in December 2012 to enable a control group to
be recruited, we approached all women attending the
EPAU, including those with a pregnancy of unknown
location
and
ongoing
viable
pregnancies.
Hospital
records were checked to confirm the outcome of the
pregnancy.
Women were offered management in accordance with
local protocols. Those with ongoing viable pregnancies
were discharged and requested to book their standard
antenatal care. Those with miscarriage (unless com-
plete) were offered the clinically appropriate options
out of expectant, medical (with misoprostol adminis-
tered by the patient, per vaginam, at home) or surgical
management (suction evacuation under general anaes-
thetic). Women with ectopic pregnancies were offered
expectant, medical (with a single dose of methotrexate)
or surgical (usually laparoscopic salpingectomy) man-
agement, according to what was clinically appropriate
with respect to their symptoms, the findings on ultrason-
ography and serum human chorionic gonadotrophin
levels.
All women recruited to the study were sent a link to a
survey by email 1 month after diagnosis of their EPL, or
at first confirmation of viability (defined as visualisation
of embryo heart activity). Women with an EPL who com-
pleted the 1-month questionnaire were also requested to
complete surveys at 3 and 9 months following the diag-
nosis. These time points were chosen to measure pro-
longed distress, and also to avoid both the due date of
the lost pregnancy (which would usually be after 6–8
months), and the anniversary of the loss, both of which
might be expected to exacerbate distress.
Written consent was gained for all participants. In
every communication, including a confirmatory email
sent 48 hours after recruitment, the participant was
reminded that their participation was voluntary, and that
they were free to withdraw.
In the 3-month and 9-month follow-up questionnaires,
women were asked whether they were trying to conceive,
were pregnant or had suffered another loss.
Participants
Patients were approached if they were above the age of
18 years, were able to give informed consent, could

 speak English sufficiently to consent and respond to
questions in the study, and if the gestational age of the
pregnancy was <20 weeks.
Between 1/1/2012 and 1/7/2013, 198 eligible women
were consecutively approached and 186 women were
recruited (figure 1). Of those who declined to take part
(12 cases), and voluntarily provided a reason, the major-
ity explained that they did not want to be reminded of
the event by the questionnaires. One woman explained
that she had strong faith, and believed that the loss was
‘in God’s hands’—and explained that she felt participat-
ing and ‘questioning’ how she felt was against her faith.
Eleven women subsequently withdrew their consent by
email. None provided a reason for doing so. Eleven
women provided illegible or invalid email addresses.
A total of 164 women received questionnaires: 114
had experienced an EPL and 50 had ongoing viable
pregnancies (the control group). Clinical information
on each participant was collected at enrolment, and
updated on completion of follow-up. This included the
reason for their initial review, the initial and final diag-
nosis, and the clinical management. Information relat-
ing to the gestational age and type of pregnancy loss
and other demographic information about all study
recruits are seen in table 1.
Demographic and background information
Respondents were asked to provide demographic infor-
mation including their age, level of education, religion,
income, marital status, length of time with current
partner, religion, previous mental health problems and
ethnic origin. They were then asked whether they had
ever had treatment in hospital, or emergency surgery,
and to specify the details of this. The participant was
then asked whether or not they were still pregnant and
they were separated into two streams (control and EPL
group) based on their responses.
Both groups were asked to detail any symptoms
related to their visit (including the severity of any pain
and/or bleeding). They were asked details of their past
obstetric history, including any terminations of preg-
nancy, fertility treatment, the time taken to conceive the
index pregnancy and how much the pregnancy was
desired. They were asked whether they received clear
information from, and were emotionally supported by,
healthcare professionals. They were asked how satisfied
they
were
with
the
healthcare
they
received,
and
whether they had received any formal counselling, or
would have liked to have been offered it. In addition,
the EPL group were asked how worried they were for
their own well-being during the loss, how distressed they
were and how responsible they felt for the loss.
Measures
The participants were asked to complete a range of
questionnaires presented in the same order, as follows
below. For the purposes of this pilot study, we limited
our analysis to responses at 1 and 3 months and for
questionnaires relating to anxiety, depression and PTSD.
Post-traumatic Diagnostic Scale
This is a well-validated self-report questionnaire for the
presence of post-traumatic stress.12 It contains 17 items
based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV diagnostic criteria for PTSD
and measures probable PTSD diagnosis and symptom
severity (a score out of 51, with >10 designating at least
moderate severity). It has good psychometric properties
across a range of populations, with a sensitivity of 0.89
and specificity of 0.75, and a Cronbach’s α coefficient of
internal consistency of 0.92 for total symptom severity.13
The respondents in the EPL group were asked to rate
their symptoms in relation to the pregnancy loss, while
the control group was asked to complete the question-
naire in the standard way, in relation to a self-identified
exposure to other trauma (if present).
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
All participants were asked to complete this 14-item (7
questions related to each of anxiety and depression)
questionnaire.14 Each subscale measures symptom sever-
ity (a score out of 21, with ≥11 indicating moderate and
≥16
severe
symptoms).
The
Hospital
Anxiety
and
Depression Scale (HADS) has good psychometric prop-
erties, with Cronbach’s α coefficient of internal consist-
ency a mean of 0.83 for anxiety, and 0.82 for depression,
and has been used in a range of populations; a review
article identified 747 papers using HADS by May 2000.15
Other self-report questionnaires completed by the par-
ticipants but not included in this analysis are the State
Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Norbeck Social Support
Questionnaire (NSSQ), the Rumination Response Scale
(RRS) and Self-compassion Scale—short form (SCS).
The 3-month and 9-month questionnaires did not
repeat demographic questions. They asked if there had
been any change in relationship status or new medical
conditions, as well as whether they had received any
counselling and, if so, whether it had been helpful. It
then asked whether they had tried to conceive or were
pregnant again. Respondents were then directed to
HADS, Post-traumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), NSSQ,
RRS and SCS.
Only a minority of participants responded to the
9-month questionnaire (18/68 (26%) of those emailed).
These results have therefore not been analysed for the
pilot study, and this highlighted to us the need to make
an ethical amendment to allow us to send participants
reminder emails to chase responses.
Statistical analysis
For the purposes of this paper, we have limited ourselves
to an analysis of the data for HADS and PDS. To
compare differences in binary variables we used the like-
lihood ratio, χ2 or Fisher’s exact test. We considered a
p value <0.05 as statistically significant. Ninety-five per

using the Wilson method. All statistical analyses were per-
formed using SPSS V.20 and GraphPad Prism V.6.
RESULTS
Demographic and background characteristics of the study
sample
The groups (viable pregnancy, miscarriage and ectopic
pregnancy) were similar in terms of age at presentation
(see table 1). Gestation at presentation was lower in the
ectopic pregnancy group. Similar proportions were in
vitro fertilisation (IVF) pregnancies in the control and
miscarriage group, but no women with an ectopic preg-
nancy had IVF. Most ectopic pregnancies were diag-
nosed on the first ultrasound scan (18/24, 75%). Most
miscarriages had an initially inconclusive ultrasound
scan (57/95, 60%). The majority of ectopic pregnancies
(21/24, 88%) were ultimately treated surgically, whereas
50/95 (53%) of miscarriages were successfully managed
expectantly or with outpatient medical management.
Response rates
At 1 month, the response rate for women with EPL was
69/114 (61%). This includes one woman who, accord-
ing to our clinical records had been diagnosed with a
viable pregnancy, but in her responses indicated that a
miscarriage had taken place while abroad. This partici-
pant did not receive the subsequent questionnaires. The
response rate for the control group was significantly
lower: 20/50 (40%; p=0.02).
At 3 months, 44/68 (65%) of women responded. In
addition, there were three completed questionnaires
(one at 1 month (who self-reported a loss), and two at
3 months) in which the respondent did not fill in their
study number. These were excluded from the analysis.
Respondents
Online supplementary table S1 details background infor-
mation on respondents in the viable and EPL groups.
Both groups had similar characteristics in terms of past
obstetric and psychiatric history.
Levels of post-traumatic stress
At 1 month, 19/69 (28% (95% CI 18% to 39%))
women in the EPL group met the PDS criteria for prob-
able moderate or severe PTSD. In addition, 9/69 (13%)
women met all criteria for probable moderate or severe
PTSD except the criterion requiring the symptoms they
reported to have been present for more than 4 weeks. At
3 months 17/44 (39% (26% to 53%)) met the criteria
for probable moderate or severe PTSD. The mean sever-
ity score for all respondents with EPL was 15.3 (SD 9.9)
at 1 month, and 11.6 (SD 9.5) at 3 months.
We examined the endorsement of separate symptom
clusters.
Re-experiencing
was
the
most
commonly
endorsed, followed by avoidance, and then hyperarousal.
At 1 month, of all questions asked, the most commonly
endorsed
statement
was—‘feeling
emotionally
upset
when you were reminded of the loss of your pregnancy’
(40/69 (58%) women describing this happening at least
2–4 times per week), followed by—‘having upsetting
thoughts or images about the loss of your pregnancy
that came into your head when you did not want
them’ (30/69 (43%) women describing this at least
2–4 times per week). At 3 months, re-experiencing
remained
the
most
commonly
endorsed
symptom
cluster.
Endorsement
of
avoidance
symptoms
had
declined (50/69 (72% (61% to 82%)) to 22/44 (50%
(36%
to
64%)),
p=0.07),
and
become
the
least
common. The reported impact of the endorsed symp-
toms on areas of respondents’ lives is detailed in table 2.
The dropout rate between 1 and 3 months was slightly
(non-significantly)
higher
for
those
with
probable
moderate-to-severe PTSD at 1 month (8/19 (42%)),
than for those with no or mild PTSD (16/49 (33%)).
In the control group, no women met the criteria for a
diagnosis of probable PTSD for self-reported traumatic
life events (not specifically probing for previous EPLs).
Levels of anxiety and depression
At 1 month, 22/69 (32% (22% to 44%)) of women in
the
EPL group met criteria for moderate-to-severe
anxiety, compared with 2/20 (10% (3% to 30%)) in the
control group (p=0.04; table 3 and figure 2). This
declined over time in the EPL group to 9/44 (20%
(11% to 35%)) at 3 months. The prevalence of moder-
ate and severe depression symptoms was similar in both
groups for all time points: 11/69 (16% (9% to 26%))
for women with an EPL compared with 2/20 (10% (3%
to 30%)) for controls, dropping to lower than the
control group (2/44; 5% (1% to 15%)) at 3 months.
The mean severity score at 1 month in the EPL group
was 7.8 for anxiety (SD 4.8) and 5.7 (SD 4.4) for depres-
sion, while the control group had a mean severity score
of 6.6 (SD 3.0) for anxiety and 3.9 (SD 4.2) for depres-
sion. At 3 months the mean severity score in the EPL
group for anxiety was 6.8 (SD 4.2), and 4.2 for depres-
sion (SD 3.6).
The dropout rate between 1 and 3 months was higher
in women with moderate-to-severe anxiety and depres-
sion compared with those with no or mild anxiety or
depression, although these results did not reach signifi-
cance (11/22 (50%) dropout for those with moderate/
severe anxiety vs 13/46 (28%) with none/mild anxiety,
6/11 (55%) vs 18/57 (32%) respectively for depression).
Ectopic pregnancy compared with miscarriage
Table 3 compares the psychological distress following
ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage. When comparing
the ectopic pregnancy and the miscarriage groups, 6 of
the 16 women who had experienced an ectopic preg-
nancy met the criteria for probable PTSD (38% (18% to
61%)), compared with 13/53 (25% (15% to 38%)) in
the miscarriage group. Four of the 16 (25% (10% to
50%)) met the criteria for moderate/severe anxiety

symptoms, compared with 9/53 (17% (9% to 29%)) in
the
miscarriage
group.

Comparison according to pregnancy status at 3 months
At 3 months, 22/44 (50%) of respondents reported
trying to conceive but not yet being pregnant. Nine of
the 22 (41% (23% to 61%)) who were trying to conceive
met criteria for probable PTSD, compared with 2/6
(33% (10% to 70%)) who were pregnant again, and 6/
16 (38% (18% to 61%)) who had not tried to conceive.
Five of the 22 (23% (10% to 43%)) of those who were
trying to conceive met the criteria for moderate/severe
anxiety, compared with none (0/6) of the group who
were pregnant again, and 4/16 (25% (10% to 50%)) in
the group who had not tried to conceive. For depres-
sion, 1/22 (5% (1% to 22%)) who were trying to con-
ceive, 1/6 (17% (3% to 56%)) who were pregnant again
and none (0/16) of the group who had not tried to con-
ceive met criteria.
DISCUSSION
We have shown in our cohort of women attending an
inner London EPAU that 39% of participants 3 months
after suffering an EPL meet the criteria for probable
moderate-to-severe PTSD. Furthermore, 20% meet the
criteria for moderate-to-severe anxiety compared with
10% in our control population. Levels of anxiety and
depression dropped between 1 and 3 months, but the
symptoms associated with PTSD persisted. We also found
that women with ectopic pregnancy suffer from signifi-
cant levels of emotional distress, with slightly higher
levels of PTSD symptoms compared with women who
experience a miscarriage, but lower levels of anxiety and
depression.
This pilot study has demonstrated the feasibility of a
larger scale study into the psychological morbidity asso-
ciated with EPL. Women were generally happy to be
approached and take part. All women who got as far as
entering their study number at the start of the online
questionnaire completed all questions, reassuring us that
the required time commitment was appropriate. The
dropout rate has implications for future study size, and
has resulted in us submitting an amendment to allow up
to two reminder emails in an effort to improve this.
One of the strengths of this study is that women were
consecutively recruited rather than self-referring them-
selves for involvement, with a high proportion (94%) of
those
approached
providing
consent
to
take
part.
Knowledge of their clinical data and outcomes enabled
us to send the questionnaires at appropriate set time
points after diagnosis. We also involved a relatively large

 number of women compared with other studies of this
type. A further strength is in the inclusion of women
with ectopic pregnancies, a group largely unreported in
the literature to date.
The primary weakness of the study is in the significant
dropout rate, including both a failure to respond to the
initial questionnaire, and the dropout of initial respon-
ders to subsequent questionnaires. In line with our
protocol, it was not possible to find out the reasons for
this. It does raise the concern of a potential ascertain-
ment
bias
artificially
inflating
rates
of
pathology.
However, while it is possible that women with a more sig-
nificant emotional response to EPL were more likely to
respond, it is also likely that women with the greatest
trauma avoid engagement with a process that makes
them
confront
the
event.
The
observed
selective
dropout of those with higher PTSD, anxiety and depres-
sion levels perhaps supports the view that there may
have been a group of women who did not want to be
reminded of their feelings about their EPL. A further
weakness is the possibility of an unintended, moderating
therapeutic effect from taking part in the study—a
hypothesis
supported
by
results
from
Neugebauer
et al’s16 study. Finally, we recognise that this study relies
on the use of self-report screening questionnaires,
whereas confirmed diagnosis of these disorders requires
more extensive interviews with appropriately trained
personnel.
Respondents in our control group who did not suffer
an EPL in the index pregnancy had a high rate of previ-
ous miscarriage (45%). This can be explained by the
fact that in the UK, attendance for medical review in
early pregnancy is often for reassurance in women with
a previous history of EPL. It also seems likely that
women with a past pregnancy loss would be more likely
to invest time in the questionnaire. The result is that,
while our control group is a useful comparator, we
would probably be underestimating overall levels of

 distress related to EPL if we were to rely on it as a nor-
mative baseline. Our control group is also smaller than
the EPL group, as a result of the recruitment method-
ology described, which has implications for the power of
the EPL versus control group calculations.
We were surprised by the prevalence of PTSD symp-
toms in our study. Even in women not meeting the full
criteria for PTSD, there was a significant endorsement
of all symptom clusters by the majority of participants,
along with impairment across social and occupational
domains, and in general satisfaction. This prevalence of
probable PTSD is higher than previously reported.10
However, in the paper by Engelhard and colleagues,
the participants were not limited to women with losses
in early pregnancy. Furthermore, the PDS was scored
differently in our paper. We scored according to Foa’s
original recommendation—where a symptom was con-
sidered endorsed if it occurs ‘once a week or less/once
in a while’—whereas Engelhard required a symptom to
occur ‘2–4 times a week/half the time’.
It is noteworthy that there is an apparent increase in
probable PTSD between month 1 (28% of respondents)
and month 3 (38%). This reflects the timing of the
questionnaires, which
were sent out 1 month after
the EPL. Accordingly women may have endorsed the
symptom clusters that constitute a diagnosis of PTSD,
but would not at that stage have fulfilled the require-
ment for the symptoms to have been present for at least
1 month. We considered classifying these women as
having an acute stress disorder; however, strictly speaking
the PDS is not validated for this purpose. In any event
the number of women who endorse the symptoms clus-
ters for PTSD other than the duration criterion at
1 month is 41% of initial respondents, suggesting that
there is no appreciable fall off in PTSD symptoms
between months 1 and 3.
The observation that such a significant proportion of
women suffer from symptoms of PTSD after losing a
pregnancy, and that this is more common than both
anxiety
and
depression,
is
potentially
important.
In other contexts, we know that untreated PTSD has a
significant
impact
on
quality
of
life,
relationships,
ability to work, suicide risk and physical health.17–19
PTSD also has implications for future pregnancies,
including poor health behaviour, reduced gestational
length and issues with infant bonding.20–22 The treat-
ment for PTSD is specific and relies on trauma-focused
cognitive–behavioural therapy or eye movement desensi-
tisation and reprocessing.23 It is perhaps not surprising
therefore that the outcome of a broad-brush approach
of offering ‘counselling’ (in variable formats) to all
women following miscarriage has been disappointing.24
Given the serious impact of untreated PTSD, screening
women for the disorder following EPL may be a more
effective use of resources. Conversely, we have shown
that there are a number of women who do not suffer
significant morbidity. These may not require any inter-
vention following their loss.
There are some issues to be considered with respect
to the diagnosis of PTSD using the PDS. First, the diag-
nostic criteria for PTSD changed slightly during the
trial. In the 2013 DSM-V, the requirement for the
trauma to result in fear, helplessness or horror was
removed.18 All of our patients with the other features of
PTSD met this criterion; thus, its removal would not
change our results. In addition, a fourth symptom
cluster relating to negative alterations in mood was
included. The PDS does not contain questions pertain-
ing to this cluster, and there are currently no validated
screening questionnaires relating to it. In any event,
although diagnostic thresholds are important to define
the nature of any pathology, this change does not
detract from the frequency or severity of distress we have
observed. Third, there may be debate about miscarriage
or ectopic pregnancy fulfilling criteria for a ‘traumatic
event’ according to DSM-V,18 which requires either par-
ticipation in a life-threatening event, including a cata-
strophic medical event, or observing the death or
serious injury to others. Clearly, some EPLs do result in
sudden, life-threatening haemorrhage or emergency
surgery and may thus be classified as a catastrophic
medical event. The interpretation of whether an EPL
fulfils the criteria of vicarious trauma by observing death
or serious injury is subjective. Some women and couples
start relating to their embryo as a child as soon as they
have received a positive pregnancy test, and for them
losing that embryo and perhaps observing the embryo
or fetus being passed during the miscarriage may be
equated with the catastrophic death of a child.
Future research should be aimed at assessing the risk
factors for PTSD. Based on this pilot study, we have esti-
mated that a total of 440 women with losses would need
to complete part 1 of the study to demonstrate a 20%
difference in prevalence between women with assisted
reproduction and those without (chosen as the least
common potential risk factor of interest; power 0.80 and
α 0.05). Accounting for rates of declined participation,
withdrawal and non-response, 811 women with EPL
should be recruited.
Our findings are relevant to healthcare professionals
who deal with EPL. Exposure to EPL on a daily basis
may lead clinicians to normalise the experience and
overlook the possible profound psychological sequelae.
The data presented are in the context of a pilot study;
however, if our findings are supported by further large
prospective studies, we believe that consideration should
be given to screening all women who have suffered an
EPL for PTSD. There is also a need to assess how to
predict those women who are most at risk of serious psy-
chological morbidity, in order to better direct limited
resources, and to facilitate early intervention and appro-
priate treatment.
