Abstract In all animals, the transition between night and day engages a host of physiological
and behavioural rhythms. These rhythms depend not on the rods and cones of the retina,
but on retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that detect the ambient light level in the environment.
These project to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus to entrain circadian
rhythms that are generated within the SCN. The neuropeptide vasopressin has an important
role in this entrainment. Many SCN neurons express vasopressin, and it has been assumed
that the role of vasopressin in the SCN reflects the activity of these cells. Here we show that

release contributes to the responses of SCN neurons to light, and enhances expression of the
immediate early gene c-fos in the SCN, which is involved in photic entrainment of circadian
rhythms.

Introduction
The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus
is the circadian pacemaker of the mammalian brain,
orchestrating diurnal cycles in activity, hormone secretion
and other physiological variables (Reppert & Weaver,
2002; Hastings et al. 2003; Froy, 2011; Albrecht, 2012)
according to an intrinsic circadian rhythmicity of neuro-
nal activity and gene expression. Light entrains the
endogenous oscillator in the SCN, synchronizing it with
the day–night cycle (Golombek & Rosenstein, 2010), and
in mammals information about ambient light intensity
originates from a small subset of retinal ganglion cells
(RGCs) that are intrinsically photosensitive (Masland,
2001; Hattar et al. 2002; Schmidt et al. 2011), rather than
from the rods and cones that are responsible for visual
imaging. These intrinsically photosensitive RGCs express
the photopigment melanopsin (Lucas, 2013) and use the

neurotransmitter glutamate (Marc & Jones, 2002);
they project to the SCN to mediate circadian photo-
entrainment. This neural circuit is independent of
conventional retinal phototransduction, since photic
entrainment persists in functionally blind transgenic mice
lacking rods and cones (Berson et al. 2002).
Changes in day length require progressive adjustments
of circadian rhythms, but it would be counter-adaptive
to reset a rhythm to any unexpected light signal. Our
experience of jet lag reflects the resistance of our
bodily rhythms to abrupt changes (LeGates et al. 2014).
Accordingly, in animals, a flash of light close to the end
of the night is more likely to result in a phase shift
of circadian rhythms than one given earlier. Such light
pulses induce expression of a set of immediate-early
genes in the SCN, and the ability of light to re-entrain
circadian rhythms correlates well with the induction of
these genes (Rusak et al. 1993; Kornhauser et al. 1996;
Porterfield & Mintz, 2009). Thus a key question is, how
can a light pulse trigger gene expression and re-entrain
circadianrhythmsatsometimesbutnotatothers?Because
the neurones in the SCN display circadian rhythms in
gene expression that are maintained even in constant
darkness, one possible answer is that these genes regulate
intrinsic neuronal excitability, with the consequence that
the SCN neurons are only fully responsive to light signals
at certain stages of the light–dark cycle. Recent findings
indicate that the neuropeptide vasopressin may have a
critical role in this process. Transgenic vasopressin V1a
receptor knockout mice show damped circadian activity
rhythms (Li et al. 2009), and, interestingly, such mice are
resistant to ‘jet lag’. In these mice, light pulses immediately
re-entrain
circadian
rhythms
(Yamaguchi
et
al.
2013).
Vasopressin is involved in diverse physiological and
behavioural processes; vasopressin secreted from the
pituitary gland is essentialfor fluid and electrolytebalance,
while vasopressin released within the brain has many other
roles, including in social behaviour, in aggression and in
behavioural rhythms (Bielsky et al. 2005; Ludwig & Leng,
2006;Donaldson&Young,2008;Bosch&Neumann,2012;
Mieda et al. 2015). Vasopressin is expressed in the dorso-
medial SCN, and is an important output; its secretion into
the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) peaks in the early morning
and declines by late afternoon (Kalsbeek et al. 2010). The
targetsforvasopressinreleasedfromtheSCNincludevaso-
pressin cells in other parts of the hypothalamus, including
those in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei that
regulate diverse physiological processes including water
intake and behaviours (Trudel & Bourque, 2010; Gizowski
et al. 2016).
The vasopressin cells in the dorsomedial SCN are
not direct recipients of retinal signals; most of the
projections from the retina innervate the ventrolateral
SCN, which contains other neuropeptides, including
vasoactive intestinal peptide and gastrin-releasing peptide
(Antle et al. 2009). Here we show that neurons
in the ventrolateral SCN are densely innervated by
vasopressin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (VP-RGCs),
and that more vasopressin is released in response to light
at the end of subjective night than at the end of sub-
jective day. Thus neurons in the ventrolateral SCN both
control the output of vasopressin from the SCN by their
innervation of vasopressin cells in the dorsomedial SCN,
and are themselves regulated by vasopressin inputs from
the retina.
Methods
Ethical approval
Procedures conducted in the UK were approved by
the local Ethics Committee and the UK Home Office
under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.
ExperimentsinGermanywereapprovedbytheCommittee
on Animal Health and Care of the local governmental
body and performed in strict compliance with the EEC
recommendations for the care and the use of laboratory
animals (86/609/CEE). Experiments in the USA were
performed according to institutional guidelines and
approval by the Animal Care and Use Committees of the
Georgia Regents University.
Animals
Experiments
were
performed
on
adult
male
and
female wild-type Sprague–Dawley and transgenic rats
(250–350 g), housed under controlled conditions (12 h
light–12 h dark, 21°C) with free access to food and
water. Most of the immunohistochemistry was carried
out on a homozygous line of transgenic rats expressing
a vasopressin–enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)
fusion gene (Ueta et al. 2005).
PCR
Female wild-type rats, 22 weeks old, were used to collect
supraoptic nucleus and retina tissue. Total RNA was iso-
lated using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA, USA). cDNA was synthesized from 1.5 μg of total
RNA using the Transcriptor High Fidelity cDNA Synthesis
Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The PCR was
carried out in a 25 μl reaction volume using Go Taq G2
Green Master Mix (Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA)
and 5, 1 or 0.1 μl of cDNA solution was used in each
reaction mixture. PCR was performed on a Gene Amp
PCR System 9700 (Life Technologies) using the following
conditions: 1 cycle of 94°C for 30 s followed by 30 cycles
of 94°C for 30 s, 56°C for 45 s and 72°C for 1 min, with a

final extension step at 72°C for 7 min. PCR products were
loaded on the 2% agarose gel and stained with SYBR Safe
DNA Gel Stain (Life Technologies). The primer sequences
have been published previously (Dijk et al. 2004; Gainer
et al. 2011).
Tissue collection and processing
Rats were terminally anaesthetized and perfusion-fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) following a heparinized
saline flush, and post-fixed and cryoprotected as pre-
viously described (Tobin et al. 2010). The eyes were
enucleated and placed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB)
during the heparinized saline flush before transcardial
perfusion with PFA. The cornea was cut around the outer
edge of the iris to remove the lens and vitreous humour
and the eyecups were either placed in 4% PFA solution
for 5 min and the retina gently removed and placed
back in 4% PFA for 20 min or each eyecup was left in
4% PFA solution for 2 h. Some retinas were fixed in a
solution of 4% PFA + 1% glutaraldehyde but otherwise
processed as described above. Tissue was then stored at
4°C in 10% sucrose, then placed in 20% sucrose solution
for 120 min and finally in 30% sucrose for 12–48 h,
until the tissues had sunk to the bottom of the vials. In
eyes that were required for coronal or transverse sections,
the tissues were then placed in Tissue-Tek CRYO-OCT
(optimal cutting temperature compound) embedding
matrix (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK)-filled
cryo-molds (Sakura Finetek UK Ltd, Thatcham, UK) and
gently manipulated to open up and be in the appropriate
orientation and then snap-frozen on powdered dry ice.
The retinas or eyecups were stored at −20°C until 16 μm
sections were cut at −15°C on a cryostat. These sections
were thaw-mounted onto SupraFrost slides, allowed to
air-dry for 10 min before being stored at −20°C until they
were processed for fluorescence immunocytochemistry.
For retinal flat mounts, three to four incisions were
made from the perimeter of the retina almost to the
centre to allow the retina to be gently flattened. The
flat-mounts were stored in 0.1 M PB until used for
immunohistochemistry. After transcardial perfusion, the
brains were removed and placed in a 2% PFA–15% sucrose
solution overnight and transferred to 30% sucrose until

Immunohistochemistry
For brain sections and rat retina flat mounts, immuno-
histochemistry was conducted using a free-floating
technique. For retina sections, immunohistochemistry
was conducted on the slides either in slide-mailers
(Fisher Scientific UK) or after the sections on each slide
were outlined with hydrophobic ink (ImmEdge, Vector
Laboratories, Peterborough, UK) and thereafter kept
horizontal in a light-proofed humid chamber. For each
of these techniques, the sections were thoroughly rinsed
in 0.1 M PB and incubated in 0.1 M glycine in 0.1 M PB for
30 min at room temperature. For immunohistochemistry
involving exposure to a biotinylated secondary and
fluorescently tagged streptavidin, sections were blocked
for endogenous biotin by incubating them first in 0.01%
avidin in 0.1 M PB for 30 min, washing and then
incubating in 0.001% biotin in 0.1 M PB for 30 min.
After washing, sections were incubated for 60 min in
a blocking buffer consisting of 3–5% normal serum
(matched to the host of secondary animal) +1% bovine
serum albumin (BSA) + 0.1% Triton X-100 diluted in
0.1 M PB. If the primary antibody was raised in goat,
BSA was not used in either the blocking buffer or the
antibody-diluting buffer. The sections were incubated
with primary antibodies (Table 1) diluted in the blocking
buffer. The primary antibodies were applied for 1–5 days
at room temperature for the first day and thereafter at
4°C. After washing in 0.1 M PB, sections were incubated
for 60 min with secondary antibodies and then washed in
0.1 M PB. Sections exposed to biotinylated secondary anti-
bodies were then incubated for 60 min with fluorescently
labelled streptavidin conjugate (1:1000). Both secondary
antibodies and fluorescently labelled streptavidin were
diluted in 0.1 M PB + 0.03% Tween. After further washing,
sections were incubated in 4�,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI, 1:33 000, Life Technologies Ltd, UK) for 5 min
at room temperature, washed and coverslipped using
either a Mowiol 4–88 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA,
USA) mounting medium, supplemented with 2.5%
1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO, Sigma-Aldrich)
or Prolong Gold (Life Technologies Ltd, UK). No
fluorescent labelling was detected when primary anti-
bodies were omitted or when the primary antibodies
(Table 2) were incubated with a fivefold (w/v) control
immunogen before being exposed to the tissue sections
(the latter control was conducted whenever a control
peptide was available from the supplier of that primary
antibody). Most antibody suppliers provided Western blot
analysis showing the antibody detecting protein in a single
band of appropriate size.
Microscopy
Fluorescence signals were acquired either using a Nikon
AIR confocal or a Zeiss LSM510 Axiovert confocal laser
scanning microscope. In either case, the images were
acquired at 1024 × 1024 pixels, using a Nikon Plan
Apochromat 1.4 NA ×60 oil-immersion objective or
a Zeiss Plan NeoFLUAR 1.4 NA ×63 oil-immersion
objective, respectively. In all cases, emissions for each
fluorophore were obtained consecutively to avoid channel
cross-talk. Those images taken throughout each cell

Cloning of rAAV vectors and virus production
In
addition
to
tissue
from
transgenic
rats,
for
morphological studies we used tissue from wild-type
rats given bilateral intravitreal injections (under iso-
flurane anaesthesia) of a recombinant adeno-associated
virus (rAVV) that caused the expression of Venus or
tdTomato under the control of the vasopressin promoter.
The conserved promoter region of the vasopressin
gene, chosen using the software BLAT from UCSC
(http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat) was subcloned
into an rAAV2 backbone carrying ampicillin resistance.
It comprises a 1.9 kb sequence stretch (revealed by BLAT)
that allows for cell-specific expression in hypothalamic
vasopressin neurons. Venus or tdTomato was introduced
to the plasmid as the gene of interest. Production of
chimeric virions (recombinant Adeno-associated virus
1/2; rAAV 1/2) was described previously (Knobloch

were administered into each eye. The head was tilted with
its left or right eye uppermost. Intravitreal injections were
performed as described by Chiu et al. (2007). Using a
very fine needle (33G, Heraeus, Kulzer Japan Co., Ltd,
Tokyo, Japan) attached to a 0.025 ml Hamilton syringe
(MicroliterTM 702), a small puncture was made in the
region of the limbus and the needle was lowered into the
vitreous using a micromanipulator. Two to five micro-
litres of rAAV was intravitreally injected into both eyes
of transgenic or wild-type rats. The needle was left in
position for 30–60 s and then withdrawn slowly. The
procedure was repeated on the other side of the same
eye before being repeated on the other eye. Injections
were performed under a dissecting microscope to ensure
correct positioning of the needle and to monitor loss of
fluid from the eye. Intravitreal injections were performed
by a trained ophthalmologist. Virally transfected rats were
left for 2 weeks before transcardial perfusion.
Retrograde tracing
In 12 eGFP rats under isoflurane anaesthesia, 50–100 nl of
the retrograde tracer (Red-Retrobeads, Lumafluor Inc.,
Naples, FL, USA, or Fluorogold, Sigma-Aldrich) was
microinjected stereotaxically in the left SCN (bregma
−1.1, lateral +0.3, depth 8.6 mm from dura), inter-
geniculate leaflet (IGL; bregma −4.5, lateral +4.0, depth
5.5 mm from dura), olivary pretectal nucleus (OPt;
bregma −4.7, lateral 1.3, depth 4.4 mm from dura)
or bilaterally into the left and right superior colliculus
(bregma −5.3 mm, lateral 1.5 mm, depth 4.8 mm
from dura) (Paxinos & Watson, 2006) over 20 min.
One week later, rats were perfused transcardially with
4% PFA and brains and retinas were processed for
immunohistochemistry.
Fos expression
The effects of light on Fos expression on eGFP-positive
RGCs and the SCN was evaluated in eGFP rats fixed by
transcardial perfusion during the day (noon) or night
after light exposure (1000 lux, for 1 h, 2 h before the
end of the night). Standard immunocytochemistry was
performed on floating retinal flat mounts or SCN sections
using a polyclonal antibody raised in rabbit against the
N-terminal amino acids 4–17 of the protein product of
human c-fos (PC38, Millipore, UK). For double immuno-
cytochemistry, a polyclonal antibody raised in chicken
against eGFP (Abcam UK) was used. Antibody-antigen
complexes were visualized by using ABC methods with a
Vector stain elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough,
UK) intensified with nickel-intensified diaminobenzidine
(Ni-DAB; single immunocytochemistry) or with DAB
only (double immunocytochemistry). Fos-positive nuclei
and the percentage of activated cells were counted in the
SCN at the level of maximal cross-sectional area by an
observer blind to the treatment group.
Intracerebroventricular infusion of vasopressin V1a
antagonist
Wild-type rats were implanted with a left lateral
ventricular brain infusion cannula (Alzet BIK2, Charles
River Ltd, Margate, UK) under isoflurane anaesthesia via
a burr hole in the skull drilled 0.6 mm posterior to and
1.6 mm lateral to bregma (Paxinos & Watson, 2006). The
cannula was secured in place using dental cement glued
to two stainless steel screws driven into the skull and then
connectedviapolythenetubingtoasubcutaneousosmotic
minipump (Alzet 2001; Cupertino, CA, USA). The pumps
were prepared as in the manufacturer’s instructions
and filled with a vasopressin V1a receptor antagonist
(d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)2AVP; (Kruszynski et al. 1980) or aCSF
and set to deliver at a rate of 416 ng h−1, for 3 days
(n = 5–7/group). This antagonist binds similarly to V1a
and V1b receptors, and the dose is about twice that used
previously by Subburaju & Aguilera (2007), who delivered
230ngh−1 for28daysandshowedeffectivenessatblocking
the effects of exogenous vasopressin. Rats were housed
singly and, on the day of experiment, were moved into a
brightly lit laboratory (1000 lux) and placed into empty
clearcagesfor1h.Theywerethenterminallyanaesthetized
for tissue fixation (see above).
In vivo electrophysiology
Urethane (ethyl carbamate 1.25 g kg−1, I.P.)-anaesthetized
adult male wild-type rats were tracheotomized and the
area below the SCN was exposed using a transpharyngeal
approach (Ludwig et al. 2002; Saeb-Parsy & Dyball, 2003).
An injection cannula was placed into the third ventricle
(coordinates: 0.6 mm caudal to bregma, 1.5 mm lateral
to midline, 5 mm deep) (Paxinos & Watson, 2006) for
I.C.V. drug administration, and in some experiments a
bipolar stimulating electrode was placed onto the exposed
optic nerve, as above, contralateral to the recording side.
Recordings were made from single cells in the SCN

using a glass microelectrode (tip diameter �1 μm) filled
with 0.9% NaCl; firing rates were recorded using Spike2
software and CED 1401 interface (Cambridge Electro-
nic Design, Cambridge, UK) on a PC. The spontaneous
activity of each SCN neuron was recorded for at least 5 min
before treatment. Trains of stimuli (matched biphasic
pulses; 1 ms pulses, 1 mA peak-to-peak; 50 Hz for 0.5 s,
every 1 min) were applied to the contralateral optic nerve.
Light was applied at 1500 lux for 5 s at 1 min inter-
vals after the rats were held in dark conditions with eyes
covered with aluminum foil. Electrical or light stimulation
was repeated before, during and after injection of a vaso-
pressin antagonist into the third ventricle, 2–3 mm caudal
to the recording site. The injection cannula was back-
filled with vasopressin V1a antagonist (40 ng in 2 μl
aCSF; Tobin et al. 2010) followed by 2 μl of aCSF to
prevent diffusion of antagonist into the SCN; in tests,
the first injection of 2 μl was thus of aCSF, followed
10 min later with an injection of antagonist. Responses
to light were averaged over 10–20 presentations; responses
to antagonist began �5 min after injection so the average
of responses after this time was taken. Only one cell was
tested in each experiment. One of the cells tested with the
antagonist was not tested with aCSF; in that experiment a
different cell had been tested with aCSF with no response
(not shown) but was lost before the antagonist could be
injected.
In vitro electrophysiology
eGFP rats were terminally anaesthetized with pento-
barbital (50 mg kg−1) and retinas dissected out as
described previously (Schmidt & Kofuji, 2011). Retinas
were treated with enzymes by adding collagenase
and hyaluronidase (Worthington Chemicals) to Ames’
solution for 10 min in a 95% O2–5% CO2 environment,
shaken
gently
before
being
washed
3
times
in
carbon-saturated Ames’ solution and stored in dark
for at least 1 h before being moved to the recording
chamber. Retina flat mounts were superfused with
Ames’ solution (30–32°C) at 3 ml min−1. Conventional
whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, using a potassium
gluconate-based internal solution, were obtained as pre-
viously described (Son et al. 2013). Some neurons were
intracellularly labelled with Alexa Fluor 555 (100 μM)
or biocytin (1%). Recordings were obtained from
eGFP-labelled VP-RGCs neurons. For bath-applied drugs,
mean firing activity and membrane potential values were
calculated from a 2 min period before drug application
and in a 2 min period around the peak effect.
Microdialysis
In wild-type rats, the brain region above the SCN was
exposed by the transpharyngeal approach under urethane
anaesthesia(ethylcarbamate1.25gkg−1, I.P.)aspreviously
described (Ludwig et al. 2002). An in-house designed
U-shaped microdialysis probe (molecular mass cut-off of
6 kDa, Fleaker
R
� hollow fibre, Spectrum Medical Inc., Los
Angeles, CA, USA) was positioned into the left SCN after
opening of the meninges. After implantation, there was an
equilibration period of at least 1 h before six consecutive
30 min dialysis samples were collected. The samples
were frozen and stored at −20°C until assay for vaso-
pressin. After two 30 min baseline periods, a stimulating
electrode (Clarke Electromedical, Edenbridge, Kent, UK,
SNEX-200X) placed onto the optic nerve closely behind
the right eye was set to deliver trains of matched biphasic
pulses (0.1 ms, 1 mA peak-to-peak; 50 Hz for 5 s, every
1 min for 30 min). In other experiments, light was applied
(1 min on–1 min off for 30 min) to the eye contralateral to
the recording site using a portable surgical light (1500 lux)
at early morning or late evening during the third sampling
period. For the early morning measurements, rats were
anaesthetized at zeitgeber time (ZT) 0, and kept in the dark
(covering the eyes with aluminium foil) before stimulating
with light at ZT4. For the late evening measurements,
rats were anaesthetized at ZT9 and then kept in the dark
(covering the eyes with aluminium foil) before stimulating
with light at ZT12. The SCN was dialysed with aCSF (pH
7.2, composition in mM: NaCl 138, KCl 3.36, NaHCO3
9.52, Na2HPO4 0.49, urea 2.16, CaCl2 1.26, MgCl2 1.18)

Vasopressin in microdialysates was measured after
lyophilization as previously described (Landgraf et al.
1995; Paiva et al. 2017) by a sensitive and selective
radioimmunoassay (detection limit: 0.1 pg sample−1;

were compared by a repeated measures ANOVA followed

In vivo electrophysiology. Two hypotheses were tested in
separate experiments: that V1a antagonist attenuates SCN
responses to light, and that it attenuates SCN responses to
electrical stimulation of the optic nerve. Each of these was
tested by a paired comparison of the (mean) response in
control condition and the mean response after application
of the antagonist, using a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank
test.
Results
Characterization of VP-RGCs
Vasopressin content in the retina has been previously
described, and vasopressin has been found (by immuno-
cytochemistry) to be expressed in some cells in both the
ganglion cell layer and the inner nuclear layer of the retina
(Gauquelin et al. 1983; Djeridane, 1994; Moritoh et al.
2011). We studied these cells in a transgenic rat strain
in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) is
expressed under the control of the vasopressin promoter
(Fig. 1A and B) (Ueta et al. 2005). eGFP-expressing cells
comprised about 1% of cells in the ganglion cell layer
(1.07 ± 0.01% of 33 868 cells from 9 retinas), and were
sparsely distributed across the whole retina. By immuno-
cytochemistry, we established that all the eGFP-expressing
cells that we examined in the retina also expressed
vasopressin-associated neurophysin: this large peptide is
part of the vasopressin precursor peptide (Fig. 1C). eGFP
(and vasopressin neurophysin) was also expressed in some
small cells in the inner nuclear layer, which contains inter-
neurons that do not project out of the retina.
The VP-RGCs were heterogeneous in size. In the
inner nuclear layer, most eGFP-expressing cells were
small: a sample of 21 of these cells had a mean (SEM)
cross-sectional area of 58 ± 2.6 μm2 (range 48–85 μm2).
By contrast, in a sample of 43 eGFP-expressing cells in
the ganglion cell layer, 25 small cells had a mean (SEM)
cross-sectional area of 83 ± 2.7 μm2 (range 62–99 μm2),
while the 10 largest cells had a mean (SEM) cross-sectional
area of 291 ± 13.2 μm2 (range 154–333 μm2). Using triple
immunohistochemistry, we found that many large (but
not small) VP-RGCs co-expressed the vesicle glutamate
transporter 2 (vGLUT-2), indicating that these cells use
glutamate as a neurotransmitter (Fig. 1E) (Fujiyama et al.
2003). In mammals, melanopsin is found in intrinsically
photosensitive RGCs that project to the SCN and plays a
critical role in regulating circadian rhythms (Provencio
et al. 2000; Hattar et al. 2002; Hankins et al. 2008).
VP-RGCs were often closely juxtaposed to immuno-
reactive melanopsin cells (Fig. 1F). Of the small VP-RGCs,
only one cell of 300 counted contained detectable
immunoreactive melanopsin, but of the large VP-RGCs,
25% (21/80) co-expressed melanopsin. We found no
co-localization of eGFP with calretinin, parvalbumin,
tyrosine hydroxylase, glycine, choline acetyltransferase
or GAD65/67 (Fig. 2A and F), which label known sub-
populations of retinal interneurons (Marc & Jones, 2002).
The vasopressin–eGFP transgene encodes a modified
vasopressin precursor with eGFP fused in-frame at the
C terminus (Ueta et al. 2005; and D. Murphy, personal
communication). The signal peptide, vasopressin and
neurophysin portions of the precursor are intact, and
may be expressed from the transgene, and thus the
vasopressin-associated neurophysin in eGFP rats may
reflect either endogenous expression or transgene-driven
expression.Wethereforeconfirmedtheexpressionofvaso-
pressin in retinal cells in wild-type rats using antibodies
againstvasopressin–neurophysin(seebelow),thepresence
of vasopressin mRNA in the retina by PCR (Figs 1D
and 3B), and the production of vasopressin by radio-
immunoassay. The vasopressin content of the retina in
wild-type rats was higher in the late afternoon (ZT11)
than in the early morning (ZT1; 25 ± 2.6 vs. 52 ± 8 pg
per retina, n = 7 per group, P < 0.015), consistent with
light-induced activation of synthesis.
Venus labelling
To visualize the axons of the VP-RGCs in wild-type
rats, we made intravitreal injections of a recombinant
adeno-associated virus
(rAAV) that results in
the
expression of a fluorescent protein, Venus (Fig. 3A and
B; Supplementary Video S1) or tdTomato, under the
control of 1.9 kbp of the vasopressin promoter (Fig. 4).
We confirmed the successful transfection of retinal vaso-
pressin cells by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3B) for

vasopressin neurophysin. This confirms that the large
RCGs do indeed express the endogenous vasopressin gene,
as the AAV vector does not contain vasopressin coding
sequences.
Unlike the eGFP–vasopressin transgenic rats, where the
eGFP is packaged inside the same vesicles as vasopressin
(Ueta et al. 2005), these fluorescent proteins are released
into (and fill) the cytoplasm of the neurons allowing
tracking of thin neurites (Knobloch et al. 2012). In
the transfected retinas, we found Venus labelling in the
ganglion cell layer but not in the inner nuclear layer
(Fig. 3C and D). Only larger VP-RGCs expressed Venus;

no Venus was found in the small cells either in the
inner nuclear layer or in the ganglion cell layer. In
three retinas we sampled 220 Venus-labelled cells and
113 melanopsin-labelled cells; 45% of the Venus-labelled
cells contained immunoreactive melanopsin and 88% of
the melanopsin cells contained Venus, suggesting that
most melanopsin-containing cells express vasopressin. We
traced the passage of Venus-labelled axons into the optic
nerve (Fig. 3E), and found a dense plexus in the ventro-
lateral SCN (Fig. 3F). Using triple immunohistochemistry
for Venus, vGLUT-2 and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide
(VIP) or gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) we found that
74% of VIP cells and 66% of GRP cells were apposed by
boutons from Venus-labelled fibres (Fig. 3I and J). The
Venus-labelled fibres co-expressed vGLUT-2 indicating
that they were glutamatergic; as expected, vGLUT-2 was
not co-expressed with either VIP or GRP, which are both
known to use GABA as a conventional neurotransmitter
(Belenky et al. 2008).
We also found Venus-labelled fibres in the inter-
geniculate leaflet (IGL), which is involved in regulation of
circadian rhythms via its projections to the SCN (Hattar
et al. 2006), and in the olivary pretectal nucleus (OPt),
which controls the pupillary light reflex (Gamlin, 2006).
However, we found no Venus-labelled fibres entering the
superior colliculus, which is a major projection area of
classical image-forming RGCs (Feinberg & Meister, 2015)
(Fig. 4); some were found on the outskirts of the superior
colliculus, but none were seen to enter this region. In two
animals we transfected the right eye with AAV expressing
Venus and the left eye with an AAV expressing tdTomato,
both under the control of the vasopressin promoter. The

eye, but there was a substantial ipsilateral projection to the
SCN in particular.
Retrograde tracing
We confirmed these projections by retrograde tracing
studies (Fig. 3G and H). When retrograde tracer beads
were injected into the SCN, IGL or OPt (n = 2–4 per area)
we found labelling of large (but not small) eGFP-positive
cells in the ganglion cell layer, and no labelling of any
cells in the inner nuclear layer. We found no labelling
after injections into the superior colliculus (Fig. 3H). To
estimate how many of the RGCs that project to the SCN
express vasopressin, we injected fluorogold into the SCN
to fill this region completely (Fig. 3G). For the injection
that achieved the best fill, we studied seven retinal sections
with confocal microscopy. Of 176 melanopsin-labelled
cells, 142 were retrogradely labelled with fluorogold; of
these, 41 also expressed eGFP. In the same sections, we
found only eight VP-RGCs that were labelled with fluoro-
gold but which appeared to contain no melanopsin. These
experiments confirmed that most of the retinal cells that
project to the SCN contain immunoreactive melanopsin,
and that vasopressin is expressed in a substantial subset
of these cells and also in some cells that project to the
SCN that did not apparently contain detectable amounts
of immunoreactive melanopsin.
Light responsiveness of RGCs
To determine the response of VP-RGCs to light we
measured the expression of the immediate early gene
c-fos in the retina by immunocytochemical detection of
Fos, the protein product of c-fos. In response to 1 h
light stimulation of dark-adapted retinas (ZT21), there
was a significant increase in Fos expression in VP-RGCs
(8.1±1.0%ofVP-RGCsexpressedFosafterlightexposure
vs. 0.2 ± 0.2% with no light exposure; n = 3 and n = 6
respectively, P = 0.0019; Fig. 5A and B). Fos expression
in VP-RGCs was even higher in retinas taken at ZT6
(13.8 ± 3.8%, n = 6), suggesting sustained expression
of Fos in VP-RGCs throughout the day.
To characterize the responsiveness of VP-RGCs to
light, we made in vitro patch-clamp recordings from 88
large RGCs identified by their expression of eGFP; 58 of
these cells were transiently excited by light, and the
other 30 were inhibited (Fig. 5C and D); previously, all
immunoreactive melanopsin RGCs have been reported to
be excited by light (Schmidt et al. 2011). Current-clamp
and voltage-clamp recordings from the light-activated
VP-RGCs showed that afferent synaptic activity was
increased during light stimulation, suggesting that
activation was mediated at least partially by synaptic
input (Fig. 5F). The close juxtaposition of the VP-RGCs
to melanopsin cells indicates that they may receive
these excitatory synaptic inputs from neighbouring,
intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells (Schmidt
et al. 2011; Hughes et al. 2016).
Vasopressin actions in the SCN
We then recorded the spike activity of single SCN
neurons in urethane-anaesthetized rats (Tsuji et al. 2016).
About two-thirds of light-responsive cells (150/222) were
excited by light (5 s pulses) and about one-third were
inhibited. In 10 cells excited by light (each from a
different rat), responses were measured before and after
injection of aCSF and after injection of a vasopressin
V1a receptor antagonist into the third ventricle. The
light-induced activation was unaffected by aCSF injection
but was reduced by 30 ± 8% after antagonist injection
(Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test; P = 0.004;
Fig. 6F). We also tested the responses of SCN neurons
to electrical stimulation of the retino-hypothalamic tract
(RHT; 5 s trains at 50 Hz) (Fig. 6A and E). Seven
SCN neurons (from seven rats) showed a prolonged
excitatory response (for 3–7 s after stimulation) that
was attenuated by I.C.V. injection of the V1a antagonist
(Fig. 6E).
A short light pulse, given during the subjective night,
induces Fos expression in the SCN, and this correlates with
the ability of light to phase-shift activity–rest cycles (Fig. 7)
(Dingetal.1994).Consistentwithpreviousstudies,60min
of light exposure at Z21 induced robust Fos expression in
the SCN, and this activation was significantly greater than
that induced by the same light exposure given at ZT15
(Fig. 7B). In separate experiments, rats were chronically
infused I.C.V. with the V1a antagonist or vehicle via a
subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipump connected
to a cannula implanted in the lateral cerebral ventricle.
Light-induced Fos expression at Z21 was significantly less
in rats infused with the V1a antagonist (Fig. 7A and C)
than in vehicle-infused rats.
Finally, we measured vasopressin release in the SCN (by
microdialysis in urethane-anaesthetized rats) in response

to light exposure. In pilot experiments we found that
application of light (1 min on, 1 min off for 40 min) to the
contralateral eye at ZT6 increased vasopressin release in
the SCN from 0.54 ± 0.14 to 1.76 ± 0.35 pg sample−1
in samples collected every 40 min (n = 6 per group,
P < 0.05). In two further groups of rats, we collected
30 min samples at the beginning and end of subjective
day before and after light was given for 30 min. The ‘early
morning’ group was exposed to light at ZT3 after being
maintained in the dark continuously after the preceding
dark phase; the ‘evening’ group was exposed to light at
ZT12 after being maintained in the dark from ZT9, to
ensure dark adaptation of light responsiveness. In the
‘early morning’ group, light exposure was followed by a
significant increase in vasopressin concentration, whereas
in the ‘late evening’ group, light exposure produced a
significant decrease (Fig. 7D).

also a time-dependent mediator of light information from
the retina to the SCN, and so is likely to contribute to the
effects of vasopressin on jet lag (Yamaguchi et al. 2013).
The expression of neuropeptides in this projection has
clear functional significance. These cells use glutamate as
a neurotransmitter, secreted from small synaptic vesicles.
Because glutamate can be rapidly recycled, this signalling
is constantly available. However, many of the RGCs that
project to the SCN also contain the neuropeptide pituitary
adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP; Hattar et al.
2002; Schmidt et al. 2011), or as described here, vaso-
pressin. At present, we do not know whether vaso-
pressin and PACAP are co-expressed or are in separate
populations of RGCs. Neuropeptides are not contained
in the same vesicles as glutamate, but are packaged
in separate, large vesicles that are synthesized at the
cell body and transported along the axons (Burbach
et al. 2001): these vesicles cannot be recycled as small
synaptic vesicles are. Light stimulation rapidly induces Fos
expression in VP-RGCs, and induction of Fos expression
is implicated in the regulation of neuronal vasopressin
synthesis (Cunningham et al. 2004). Thus, it is likely that,
in VP-RGCs, Fos expression is linked to up-regulation of
peptide synthesis to replenish what has been released from
theterminals.However,thepathlengthfromretinatoSCN
in the rat is >20 mm, and (in magnocellular vasopressin
neurons) vasopressin-containing vesicles are transported
along axons at only �140 mm day−1 (Burbach et al. 2001).
Given this, and given the delays between stimulation and
production of new vesicles, the depletion of peptide by
light-induced activation of release in the SCN cannot be
replenished without a lag time of several hours. Thus, at
the terminals in the SCN, the availability of peptide for
release must be subject to a diurnal cycle of depletion and
replenishment.
We have shown here that light given at the end of
the dark phase consistently evokes measurable vaso-
pressin release in the SCN, whereas light given at the
beginning of the dark phase does not. We predicted that
light stimulation would increase vasopressin release from
retinal afferents, and would excite a majority of the first
order recipient neurons in the SCN. The retinal afferents
do innervate predominantly VIP and GRP neurons, but
do not directly innervate the intrinsic vasopressin cells of
the SCN, which are regulated by inhibitory GABAergic
projections by the retinal recipient neurons. However,

Figure 7. Vasopressin effects on SCN Fos expression
A, hypothalamic sections at the level of the SCN stained for Fos
(black nuclear stain), and lightly counterstained with nuclear fast red.
A 60 min light pulse presented at the beginning of the dark period
(ZT15) induces more Fos expression in the SCN than a pulse
presented towards the end of the dark period (ZT21). Light-induced
Fos expression is attenuated by a vasopressin V1a antagonist. B, data
(median numbers of Fos cells counted per SCN section) from all
individual animals are given as points (mean difference, 0.39; 95%
CI, 0.1 to 0.68; ∗∗P = 0.0095). C, data (median numbers of Fos cells
counted per SCN section) from all individual animals are given as
points (mean difference, 0.54; 95% CI, −1.1 to 0.02; ∗∗P = 0.029).
D, light stimulation increases the vasopressin content in SCN
microdialysates in the ‘early morning’ group (light exposure at ZT3)
but not the ‘evening’ group (light at ZT12) as measured by
radioimmunoassay (RM ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s and Tukey’s
multiple comparisons tests). Mean difference, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.23 to
0.85; ∗∗∗P = 0.0001; mean difference, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.72;
∗∗P = 0.005; mean difference, −0.47; 95% CI, −0.75 to −0.18;
+++P = 0.0006. Bars show means + SEM. Numbers in columns are
n per group. For source data in B see Table S5; for source data in C,
see Table S6; for source data in D, see Table S7.
some of the retinal recipient neurons are inhibited by light,
so there may be activation of intrinsic vasopressin cells
from these inputs. In addition, it has been suggested that
GABAmayexcitesomeSCNvasopressinneurons(Belenky
etal.2010).Thus,howmuchofthevasopressincollectedin
the microdialysates is released from the retina projection
or released from the endogenous population of SCN vaso-
pressin neurons in response to light stimulation is unclear.
SCN vasopressin neurons project to the paraventricular
nucleusofthehypothalamus,thesubparaventricularzone,
medial preoptic area, and into the contralateral SCN. SCN
vasopressin neurons have also axon collaterals that remain
inside the boundaries of the SCN (Pennartz et al. 1998)
and release vasopressin from their somata and dendrites
(Castel et al. 1996).
We have also shown that light-induced Fos expression
in the SCN is higher at the end of the night than earlier,
and SCN Fos expression has been linked to light-induced
phase shifts. Accordingly, cyclical availability of neuro-
peptides for release may explain why a light pulse given
close to the end of the night is more likely to result in
a phase advance of circadian rhythms than one given
earlier.
Exactly why light is so ineffective at eliciting Fos
expression in the early part of the dark phase remains
intriguing; even if the retinal terminals are depleted
of vasopressin they should still be releasing glutamate
in response to light. The answer may simply be that,
although c-fos is often thought of as an indiscriminate
marker of neuronal excitation, this is over-simplistic: in
magnocellular oxytocin neurons for example, the neuro-
peptide α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH)
induces Fos expression but inhibits neuronal activity
(Sabatier et al. et al. 2003), while antidromic stimulation
of increased spike activity is completely ineffective at
increasing Fos expression (Luckman et al. 1994). The
likely mechanistic link between synaptic activation
appears to be via increased intracellular calcium, and as
vasopressin is a potent mobilizer of intracellular calcium
stores (Sabatier et al. 1998), it may be a particularly potent
inducer of Fos expression.
Vasopressin is involved in diverse physiological and
behavioural processes; vasopressin secreted from the
pituitary gland is essential for fluid and electrolyte
balance, but vasopressin released within the brain has
many roles, including in social behaviour, in aggression
and in behavioural rhythms. Vasopressin is an important
output of the SCN; its secretion into the CSF peaks
in the early morning and declines by late afternoon
(Kalsbeek et al. 2010), and its targets include vasopressin
cells in other parts of the hypothalamus. In particular,
vasopressin released from the SCN during late sleep
activates
osmosensory

the

neurons in the supraoptic nucleus (Trudel & Bourque,
2010) and to neurons in the organum vasculosum of

the lamina terminalis (Gizowski et al. 2016). Supraoptic
neurons secrete vasopressin from nerve terminals in
the posterior pituitary, which acts on the kidneys to
concentrate the urine. Regulation of this antidiuretic
system by the SCN suppresses nocturnal enuresis, and
is important in maintaining sleep (Gizowski et al. 2016).
Magnocellular vasopressin neurones of the supraoptic
nucleus also directly control a diversity of behavioural
processes, via central axonal projections and via extensive
dendritic secretion of vasopressin (Ludwig & Leng, 2006;
Neumann & Landgraf, 2012; Stoop, 2012). Thus although
vasopressin is expressed at several sites in the nervous
system as well as in the retina, it appears that some
of these vasopressin neurons are linked in functionally
coherent chains to integrate multiple physiological and
behavioural functions.
Shift work that includes a night-time rotation and
long-distance travel has become an unavoidable attribute
of today’s 24 h society. The related disruption of the
human circadian time organization leads in the short
term to an array of jet lag-like symptoms, and in the
long run it contributes to weight gain and obesity,
metabolic syndrome, type II diabetes and cardiovascular
disease. Studies suggest increased cancer risk, symptoms
of insomnia, depression, elevated cortisol levels, cognitive
impairment and premature mortality (Hastings et al.
2003; Froy, 2011; Kondratova & Kondratov, 2012). The
mechanisms leading to circadian dysfunction are largely
unknown. The reported association of vasopressin with jet
lag (Yamaguchi et al. 2013) raises the interesting possibility
that interventions in vasopressin signalling from the retina
may have important therapeutic benefits.
