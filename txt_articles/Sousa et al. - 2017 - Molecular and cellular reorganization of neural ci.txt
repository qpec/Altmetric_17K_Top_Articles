To better understand the molecular and cellular differences in brain organization between
human and nonhuman primates, we performed transcriptome sequencing of 16 regions of
adult human, chimpanzee, and macaque brains. Integration with human single-cell
transcriptomic data revealed global, regional, and cell-type–specific species expression
differences in genes representing distinct functional categories. We validated and further
characterized the human specificity of genes enriched in distinct cell types through
histological and functional analyses, including rare subpallial-derived interneurons expressing
dopamine biosynthesis genes enriched in the human striatum and absent in the nonhuman
African ape neocortex. Our integrated analysis of the generated data revealed diverse
molecular and cellular features of the phylogenetic reorganization of the human brain across
multiple levels, with relevance for brain function and disease.
A
lthough the human brain is about three
times as large as those of our closest living
relatives, the nonhuman African great apes
(chimpanzee, bonobo, and gorilla), increased
size and neural cell counts alone fail to ex-
plain its characteristic functionalities (1–5). The
brain has also undergone microstructural, con-
nectional, and molecular changes in the human
lineage (1–5), changes likely mediated by diver-
gent spatiotemporal gene expression (6–17).
Here, we profiled the mRNA and small noncod-
ing RNA transcriptomes of 16 adult brain regions
involved in higher-order cognition and behavior
of human (H) (Homo sapiens); chimpanzee (C)
(Pan troglodytes), our closest extant relative; and
rhesus macaque (M) (Macaca mulatta), a com-
monly studied nonhuman primate. We integrated
these profiles with single-cell transcriptomic data
from the human brain (18, 19), histological data
from adult and developmental brains of these
and other primates (bonobo, gorilla, orangutan,
pig-tailed macaque, baboon, and capuchin), and
multimodal data from human primary and in-
duced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)–derived neural
cultures. In doing so, we have investigated the
evolutionary, cellular, and developmental frame-
work that makes the human brain unique.
Overview of regional transcriptome profiling
We generated transcriptional profiles of 247 tis-
sue samples representing hippocampus, amygdala,
striatum, mediodorsal nucleus of thalamus, cere-
bellar cortex, and 11 areas of the neocortex from
six humans, five chimpanzees, and five macaques
(figs. S1 to S5 and table S1). To minimize biases
in comparative transcriptome analyses, we used
the XSAnno pipeline to create a common annota-
tion set of 26,514 orthologous mRNAs, including
16,531 protein-coding genes and 3253 long inter-
genic noncoding (linc) RNAs (fig. S2). We reanno-
tated all chimpanzee and macaque microRNAs
(miRNAs) based on annotated human precursor
sequences (fig. S3). Assessment of global correla-
tion between regions and species by unsupervised
hierarchical clustering (fig. S5) revealed clustering
of the miRNA data set primarily by species. In con-
trast, cerebellar mRNA samples from all species
formeda distinct clusterseparatedfrom otherbrain
regions(fig.S5),indicatingthatthevariouscerebella
are more similar to each other than to other brain
regions within the same species. Within each spe-
cies, hierarchical clustering of mRNA or miRNA
data sets were calculated based on pairwise corre-
lation matrices of brain regions and confirmed by
multiscale bootstrap resampling and intraspecies
genetic distance measurements (figs. S6 and S7).
This revealed a similar pattern of interregional hi-
erarchical clustering, reflecting known topograph-
ical proximity and functional overlap (11, 14).
Species differences in regional
gene expression
Differentially expressed genes were identified
[false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.01] in each region
by comparing generalized linear models with spe-
cies as the main factor and batch as a cofactor.
We found 25.9% of mRNAs (6866 of 26,514) and
40.6% of miRNAs (603 of 1485 mature miRNAs
included in the analysis) were differentially ex-
pressed between at least two species in one or
more regions. A total of 11.9% of mRNAs (3154)
and 13.6% of miRNAs (202), representing distinct
functional categories, exhibited human-specific
up-regulation (H > C = M) or down-regulation
(H < C = M) (Fig. 1, A and B, and tables S2 to S4),
with the highest number of differentially ex-
pressed genes observed in striatum followed by
thalamus, primary visual cortex, and dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (fig. S8 and table S3). These ob-
servations were not attributable to variations in
the ratio of major cell types among species (fig. S9).
Among the 3154 mRNA genes with human-
specific differential expression, only 22 were up-
regulated and 9down-regulatedacrossall analyzed
regions (fig. S10). Only 3 genes were differentially
expressedacrossanalyzedneocorticalareas:TWIST1
(down-regulated), a transcriptional regulator of
neural genes that is mutated in Saethre-Chotzen
syndrome, a disorder associated with intellec-
tual disability (20) (Fig. 1C and fig. S11, A and B),
and two functionally uncharacterized lincRNAs
(RP11-364P22.1 and CTB-78F1.1) (up-regulated). The
remaining 3120 mRNA genes displayed human-
specific differential expression in one or a subset of
brain regions or neocortical areas (Fig. 1C, fig. S10,
and table S3). Among miRNAs, 10.4% (155) and
3.2% (47) were up-regulated or down-regulated,

 respectively, in the human brain, with many
displaying region-specific patterns (Fig. 1B and
fig. S12). Independently validated examples
include PKD2L1 (up-regulated in neocortical areas
except primary motor cortex), a gene encoding an
ion channel (21); MET (up-regulated in prefrontal
cortex), a gene implicated in autism spectrum dis-
order (22); ZP2 (up-regulated in cerebellum), a
gene encoding a protein mediating sperm-egg
recognition (23); and several miRNAs (Fig. 1C
and figs. S11 and S12).
Species differences in gene
coexpression patterns
To extract additional biologically relevant infor-
mation, we applied weighted gene coexpression
correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to gener-
ate modules of genes with similar variation across
regions and/or species. We identified 229 mRNA
modules, many of which exhibited regional and/
or species-specific expression patterns (Figs. 2,
A and B, and table S5). For example, genes in
module 92 (M92) and M32 are respectively up-
regulated and down-regulated in human neo-
cortex, and M130 genes are up-regulated in human
striatum, hippocampus, and amygdala (fig. S13).
M130 includes tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and
DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) decarboxylase
(DDC), both involved in dopamine biosynthesis
(fig. S13F). Human-specific modules were en-
riched for genes associated with categories and
pathways such as “thrombospondin N-terminal–
like domains” and “alternative splicing” (table S5).
We also clustered all miRNAs based on their in-
dividual correlations to the average expression pro-
file of each mRNA module (fig. S14A and table S6).
Because the expression of each miRNA might
correlate with multiple mRNA modules, module
pairings were refined using a transcriptome-wide
high-throughput sequencing approach combined
with cross-linking immunoprecipitation (HITS-
CLIP) map of miRNA binding sites in the human
brain (24) (fig. S14B and table S7). We identi-
fied 37 stable miRNA modules, with several pairs
of miRNA/mRNA modules exhibiting opposing
regional and/or species-specific enrichment for
potential miRNA-mRNA target predictions (fig.
S14, C to E).
Cell-type specificity of differentially
expressed genes
To investigate differential gene expression pat-
terns at the cellular level, we integrated our data
sets with single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
data generated from the human neocortex (18, 19)
and validated findings via immunohistochem-
istry or in situ hybridization. We found that many
of the genes displaying species- and/or region-
specific patterns also exhibited cell-type–specific
expression. For example, PKD2L1 is enriched in
excitatory projection neurons (Fig. 3, A and C), TH
is expressed in a subset of somatostatin (SST)–
expressing inhibitory interneurons in human and
macaque neocortical deep layers and white matter
(Fig. 3, B and D), and ZP2 is up-regulated in the
granule cells of the human cerebellum (fig. S11, C
and D). Additionally, we found cell-type–specific
enrichment among WGCNA modules, including
human-specific M81 and M162, which were com-
posed of genes enriched in a subset of neocorti-
cal excitatory projection neurons (Fig. 2B, right
panels, and table S5).
Species differences in neurotransmitter
receptor gene expression
The species- and region-specific expression pat-
terns of several genes associated with neurotrans-
mission prompted us to investigate whether there
were broad interspecies differences in the co-
expression networks and genomic sequences of
genes encoding receptors underlying excitatory,

the dopaminergic system did not have enough

 Species differences in dopamine
biosynthesis gene expression
We next investigated dopamine biosynthesis and
signaling genes. TH and DDC displayed human-
specific (H > C = M) up-regulation in the striatum
(Fig. 4A). TH also displayed chimpanzee-specific
down-regulation (C < H = M) in the neocortex
(Fig. 4A). An extended analysis of RNA-seq data
(25) independently validated the down-regulation
of TH mRNA in chimpanzee neocortex compared
with human, as well as the down-regulation of
TH expression in the neocortex of bonobo and
gorilla, but not of orangutan (fig. S18A).
Analyses of cis-regulatory elements active near
the TH gene in the adult human, chimpanzee, and
macaque brain (26) revealed no differences that
would explain observed TH expression patterns.
We hypothesized that the species-specific TH ex-
pression patterns might be explained by changes
in the number and distribution of TH-expressing
interneurons, which have been previously iden-
tified in telencephalic regions and shown to vary
in distribution across species (27–29), including
depletion in the prefrontal cortex of nonhuman
great apes (28). Therefore, we quantified TH-
immunopositive (TH+) interneurons (fig. S19, A
to C) on an independent set of 45 adult brains
from nine primate species (table S9). Consistent
with our transcriptome data, humans have a
higher number (Tukey’s honest significance test;
all P < 0.05) of TH+ interneurons in both the
dorsal caudate nucleus and putamen (striatum)
when compared with all other analyzed non-
human primates (Fig. 4C and fig. S20A). Further-
more, we found neocortical TH+ interneurons in
all analyzed areas of human, all monkey species,
and orangutan (Fig. 4C and fig. S20, B and D), but
only TH+ fibers in all analyzed neocortical areas
of chimpanzee, bonobo, and gorilla (Fig. 4C and
fig. S20B). We found no differences in the number
of TH+ interneurons in human, chimpanzee, go-
rilla, and macaque olfactory bulbs (fig. S19D).
Molecular profiling of human
TH+ interneurons
To further explore the phenotype of adult human
neocortical TH+ interneurons, we performed
immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization.
TH+ interneurons expressed GAD1, the GABA syn-
thesis enzyme (Fig. 4B), but were lacking canon-
ical markers of neocortical interneuron subtypes
such as SST, PVALB, NPY, NOS1, CALB2, and
VIP (fig. S21), as well as ETV1, which is required
for differentiation of dopaminergic neurons in
multiple species (30), or its homolog, ETV5 (figs.
S21, H and I). Most TH+/GAD1+ interneurons co-
expressed DDC (62.54 ± 1.01%) (Fig. 4B), the en-
zyme that converts L-DOPA to dopamine, but not
dopamine-b-hydroxylase (DBH) (fig. S18) (31), the
enzyme that converts dopamine to noradrenaline,
indicating that a subset of TH+ interneurons are
able to produce dopamine but not noradrenaline.
Developmental origin of human
TH+ interneurons
To gain insight into the development of TH+ in-
terneurons, we analyzed the regional expression
of TH across human brain development using
the BrainSpan RNA-seq data set (www.brainspan.
org). The highest TH expression is observed in
striatum and increases steadily from early fetal
development [period 2, as defined in (11)] to
young adulthood (period 13) (Fig. 5A). Lower
TH expression is observed in neocortex, hippo-
campus, and amygdala and increases perina-
tally [periods 7 (late fetal development) and 8
(early infancy)] and remains stable in neocortex.
In addition, TH expression increases from early
childhood (period 10) to young adulthood in the
amygdala and hippocampus (Fig. 5A).
Using immunohistochemistry, we detected TH+
axons in striatum as early as late midfetal devel-
opment (fig. S22), and occasional bipolar TH+
interneurons were first observed in the external
capsule and neocortical white matter in the new-
born human (Fig. 5B). The neonatal chimpanzee
brain displayed the same pattern of unmyelinated
TH+ fibers in the external capsule (Fig. 5B), but no
TH+ interneurons were detected in the neocortex.

 To identify the birthplace of TH+ interneurons,
we prepared primary cell cultures from 17 to 18
postconceptional week (pcw)–old human brains
(Fig. 5C) of lateral, medial, and caudal ganglionic
eminences (LGE, MGE, and CGE) of the ventral
forebrain (subpallium), known to generate inter-
neurons (32–34), and neocortical proliferative
zones, which may also generate interneurons in
humans (13). We found TH+ interneurons coex-
pressing canonical markers of distinct progenitor
lineages within ganglionic eminences (NKX2-1,
NR2F2, or SP8) (Fig. 5D). BrdU (bromodeoxyuri-
dine) birth-dating confirmed that TH+ interneu-
rons are generated by ganglionic eminence, but
not neocortical, progenitors (Fig. 5, D and E),
indicating that TH+ interneurons are derived
from diverse subpallial lineages and are devel-
opmentally heterogeneous. Similar to adult neo-
cortical TH+ interneurons, subpallial-derived
TH+ interneurons also coexpressed GAD1 and
DDC (Fig. 5D). Neocortical TH+ interneurons were
mainly SP8+ (77.78 ± 12.11%), with a smaller
NR2F2+ (22.22 ± 8.78%) subpopulation and were
all BrdU–, indicating that they began to migrate
into neocortex before 17 pcw but express TH pro-
tein later in development (Fig. 5, D and E).
In vitro characterization of human
TH+ interneurons
To further characterize TH+ interneuron devel-
opment and properties, we asked whether TH+
interneurons could be generated from human
iPSCs using a differentiation protocol for corti-
cal excitatory projection neurons and inhibitory
interneurons (fig. S23) (see the supplementary
materials). Immunofluorescence confirmed the
presence of TH+ cells coexpressing GAD1 and
SP8, but not SST, PVALB, NR2F2, or NKX2-1,
confirming that iPSC-derived TH+ interneu-
rons display a similar molecular profile to TH+
interneurons from the adult neocortex and neo-
cortical primary culture (fig. S24). Complementary
analysis of a single-cell RNA-seq data set from
human embryonic stem cell–derived cortical in-
terneurons (35) revealed that many TH-expressing
cells coexpress GABAergic marker genes GAD1/2
at all time points, as well as SST, ETV1, and ETV5
transiently at early time points (fig. S25).
We characterized human iPSC-derived TH+ inter-
neurons by assessing their ability to produce
and transport dopamine using immunofluores-
cence, a monoamine uptake assay, and high-
performance liquid chromatography. We found
that 72.14 ± 10.02% of 80 days in vitro (DIV) TH+
interneurons that had taken up a monoamine-
imitating fluorophore were DDC+ (Fig. 6, A and B)
and consequently could produce and transport
dopamine in vitro. Commensurate with these ob-
servations, we detected dopamine in conditioned
culture media from iPSC-derived and LGE pri-
mary neural cultures, both of which contained
TH+/DDC+ interneurons, but not in control culture
media (Fig. 6C).
Discussion
Our analysis of transcriptomic data revealed
global, regional, and cell-type–specific species
expression differences in protein-coding and
noncoding genes. Genes with human-specific
differential expression patterns include those
encoding transcription factors, ion channels,
and neurotransmitter biosynthesis enzymes and
receptors. Changes in the regional and cellular
expression patterns of these genes could affect
function of neural circuits by altering transcrip-
tion of other genes, intrinsic electrophysiological
properties, or synaptic transmission.
Neuromodulatory systems show broad expres-
sion differences between species. One example
includes a rare and molecularly heterogeneous
subpopulation of interneurons expressing dopa-
mine biosynthesis genes TH and DDC, which are
enriched in the human striatum and neocortex as
compared with nonhuman African apes. These
cells originate in the subpallial ganglionic emi-
nences and likely migrate into the striatum and
neocortex during late prenatal and early post-
natal development. We also observed an increase
in TH expression during postnatal development
and young adulthood, suggesting that TH expres-
sion and/or the migration of TH+ interneurons
may be dynamically regulated and protracted.
The absence of TH+ interneurons from the
cortex of nonhuman African apes [see also (28)],
and their decreased density in the striatum of
nonhuman primates, may result from several
mechanisms. First, these cells could have been
lost due to genetic disruptions affecting interneu-
ron migration, differentiation, or survival (32–34).
These disruptions may have occurred in the com-
mon ancestor of African apes before being re-
versed in the human lineage (homoplasy) or, in
a less-likely scenario, may have occurred inde-
pendently in the Gorilla and Pan lineages. A
second possibility is that these interneurons are
present in the nonhuman African ape cortex
but do not express TH, do so only transiently, or
die before our ability to detect them. Commen-
surate with this possibility, the molecular profile
of mouse cortical SST-positive interneurons is
malleable (36), and sensory stimuli can cause a
switch from the production of TH and dopamine
to SST in rat hypothalamic interneurons (37).

 Finally, TH+ interneurons of nonhuman African
apes may have lost their ability to deviate to the
cortex from the rostral migratory stream. Indeed,
some human TH+ interneurons migrating via the
rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb
divert to the prefrontal cortex (38), and our ob-
servation of SP8+/TH+ coexpression is consistent
with a rostral migratory stream origin. However,
other routes of migration are possible, as sug-
gested by our observation of TH+ interneurons
in the external capsule of newborn human brain.
Neuromodulatory transmitters, in particular
dopamine, are involved in distinctly human as-
pects of cognition and behavior, such as working
memory, reasoning, reflective exploratory behav-
ior, and overall intelligence. By analyzing brain
regions involved in these processes, we show that
evolutionary modifications in gene expression and
the distribution of neurons associated with neuro-
modulatory systems may underlie cognitive and
behavioral differences between species. Cortical
TH+ interneurons are depleted in patients af-
fected by Parkinson’s disease (39) or dementia
with Lewy bodies (40), and these alterations may
contribute to cognitive impairments.
As these results demonstrate, the resource we
present here may aid future studies on the evo-
lution and neuroscience of primates.
