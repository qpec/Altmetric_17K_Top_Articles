Trial of decompressive craniectomy for
traumatic intracranial hypertension
In patients with refractory traumatic intracranial hypertension, decompressive craniectomy resulted in
lower mortality but higher proportions of vegetative state and severe neurological impairment compared
to ongoing medical management.

Three-part clinical question
Patients: Aged 10–65 years old with refractory trau-
matic intracranial hypertension.
Intervention: Patients were randomly assigned to
either decompressive craniectomy or ongoing medical
management (including optional barbiturate therapy).
Outcomes:
The
primary
outcome
was
Extended
Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) (see Appendix 1)
at six months’ post-randomisation. Secondary out-
comes included mortality at 6, 12, and 24 months;
GOS-E at 12 and 24 months; quality-of-life at 6, 12,
and 24 months; time in ICU; GCS at discharge from
ICU; and assessment of ICP control.

Study patients
Inclusion criteria: Patients aged 10–65 years with trau-
matic brain injury (TBI) and refractory intracranial
hypertension (>25 mmHg for 1–12 h despite ‘Stage
1’ and ‘Stage 2’ medical therapies), presenting to 52
acute neurosciences centres in 20 countries. Patients
required an abnormal CT head scan and ICP monitor
before randomisation. A prior craniotomy (but not
craniectomy) was permitted.
Exclusion criteria: Patients with bilateral fixed and
dilated pupils, bleeding diathesis or injuries ‘deemed
unsurvivable’ were pre-defined exclusions. A primary
decompressive craniectomy, withdrawal of consent,
‘lack of equipoise’, and brainstem involvement were
further reasons for exclusion. A total of 2008 patients
were assessed for eligibility and 408 underwent ran-
domisation; 10 were subsequently excluded.
Study groups
All study patients underwent stepwise medical man-
agement prior to randomisation. Stage 1 therapies
included head elevation, controlled ventilation, sed-
ation, and optional paralysis. Stage 2 therapies
included vasopressors, ventriculostomy, therapeutic
hypothermia, hypocapnia, and osmotherapy. At ran-
domisation, 206 patients were then assigned to surgi-
cal
intervention
(either
bi-frontal
or
unilateral
decompressive craniectomy), and 202 patients were
assigned to ongoing medical therapy (continuing
Stage 1 and Stage 2 management, with the option to
add barbiturates).
Results
At six months, there was lower mortality in the sur-
gical group compared with the medical group (26.9%
vs. 48.9%), but higher proportions of vegetative state
(8.5% vs. 2.1%), lower severe disability (21.9% vs.
14.4%), and upper severe disability (15.4% vs.
8.0%) (see Table 1). For secondary outcomes, a simi-
lar pattern was observed in mortality and GOS-E dis-
tributions at 12 months. Baseline characteristics were
similar between both groups, as were the proportions
of Stage 1 and Stage 2 interventions (see Table 2).
However, a large proportion (37.2%) of the medical
treatment group later went on to have a decompres-
sive craniectomy.
Evidence-based medicine questions
1. Do the methods allow accurate testing of the
hypothesis? Yes. This was a large, multicentre ran-
domised trial performed in neurosciences centres
with 24-h access to neurosurgical and neuro-
intensive care specialists. The baseline character-
istics between groups were similar, and there was
similar utilisation of Stage 1 and Stage 2 medical

 therapies prior to randomisation. Randomisation
was performed in 1:1 permuted blocks of random
size (stratified by trial site) in order to limit allo-
cation bias. Although treating clinicians could not
be blinded to group allocation, the trial statisti-
cians and outcomes assessors were.
2. Do the statistical tests correctly test the results to
allow
differentiation
of
statistically
significant
results? No. The authors calculated 400 patients
would be needed to provide 80% power to detect
a 15% difference in rates of ‘favourable’ outcome
between the treatment groups, and they managed
to reach this recruitment target. However, during
analysis, they found the data did not meet certain
statistical assumptions underlying the ordinal
regression analysis, and so common odds ratios
could not be used. The subsequent analyses were
therefore essentially descriptive.
3. Are the conclusions valid in light of the results?
Probably. However, there are several aspects of
the study that deserve attention. Firstly, a large
majority of patients were recruited in the UK
(71.1%), where bifrontal craniectomies are used
more often as the preferred surgical technique.1
These operations are typically longer than unilat-
eral craniectomies and associated with higher
morbidity,2 and this may have influenced the
overall outcomes. Secondly, there was a high
crossover rate in the medical group (37.2% sub-
sequently had surgery); the authors maintain that
the primary outcome was unchanged in a per-pro-
tocol analysis, but no data were presented to sup-
port this. Thirdly, recruitment occurred slowly
over a 10-year period, during which time the med-
ical management of TBI has changed in several
important ways (e.g. temperature targets, the use
of steroids, and accepted levels of hypocapnia).
These changes may have influenced the trial out-
comes over time, particularly in the medical
group. Finally, when describing the results using

 a dichotomous ‘favourable’ vs. ‘unfavourable’
distinction, the authors used an unconventional
definition of ‘favourable’ that includes Upper
Severe Disability or better on the GOS-E scale.
This contrasts with similar studies (including the
DECRA trial), which use lower moderate disabil-
ity or better for their definition. When applying
the conventional definition of ‘favourable’ out-
come to this current study, any difference between
the
medical
and
surgical
groups
seems
to
disappear.
4. Did results get omitted and why? Yes. There was a
very high exclusion rate. Over the 10 years of the
study, 2008 patients were assessed for eligibility,
yet 1599 were excluded. Whilst many of these
appear to be for legitimate reasons (i.e. violation
of pre-specified inclusion criteria), there were a
number of exclusions for potentially arbitrary or
subjective reasons (e.g. injuries ‘deemed unsurviv-
able’ (n ¼ 128); follow-up not possible (n ¼ 39);
lack of equipoise (n ¼ 37); or no reason given at
all (n ¼ 153)). Furthermore, after randomisation,
19 patients were excluded from the primary out-
come analysis (5 in the surgical group, 14 in the
medical group), due to withdrawal or lack of con-
sent, and loss-to-follow-up. The authors used a
‘modified’
intention-to-treat
analysis
that
excluded these data, but this is an unconventional
approach that raises the possibility of a selection
bias.
5. Did the authors suggest any further areas of
research? Yes. The authors commented that their
study did not look at long-term data on subse-
quent cranial reconstruction, which is an import-
ant part of the follow-up pathway for patients
undergoing craniectomy.
6. Did they make any recommendations based on the
results and are they appropriate? No.
7. Is the study relevant to my clinical practice? Yes.
TBI with raised ICP is a common condition asso-
ciated with significant mortality and morbidity,
and the evidence regarding how best to treat
these patients is limited and often contradictory.
8. What level of evidence does this study represent? 1B.
9. What grade of recommendation can I make on this
result alone? B.
10. What grade of recommendation can I make when
this study is considered along with other available
evidence? B.
11. Should I change my practice because of these
results? Possibly. This study adds to the limited
body of evidence that appears to show decom-
pressive craniectomy results in more survivors
but with higher rates of severe neurological
impairment. Such data help to inform discussions
with relatives when discussing the pros and cons
of each treatment option, especially as quality-of-
life considerations often play a central role in
these decisions.
12. Should I audit my practice because of these results?
Yes. There is potential for wide variation in out-
comes depending on a range of local factors
(patient population and selection, departmental
caseload, organisational factors). It also remains
unclear a priori if there are particular subgroups
of patients who are likely to benefit from a par-
ticular treatment strategy. Local data should
better inform discussions with patient’s relatives
and enhance the decision-making process.
