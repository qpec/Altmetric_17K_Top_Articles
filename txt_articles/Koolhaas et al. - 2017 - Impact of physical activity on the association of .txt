Abstract
Background: Being overweight or obese is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Physical
activity might reduce the risk associated with overweight and obesity. We examined the association between overweight
and obesity and CVD risk as a function of physical activity levels in a middle-aged and elderly population.
Design: The study was a prospective cohort study.
Methods: The study included 5344 participants aged 55 years or older from the population-based Rotterdam Study.
Participants were classified as having high or low physical activity based on the median of the population. Normal weight
(18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25.0–29.9 kg/m2) and obese participants (�30 kg/m2) were categorized as having high or
low physical activity to form six categories. We assessed the association of the six categories with CVD risk using Cox
proportional hazard models adjusted for confounders. High physical activity and normal weight was used as the reference
group.
Results: During 15 years of follow-up (median 10.3 years, interquartile range 8.2–11.7 years), 866 (16.2%) participants
experienced a CVD event. Overweight and obese participants with low physical activity had a higher CVD risk than
normal weight participants with high physical activity. The HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 1.33 (1.07–1.66)
and 1.35 (1.04–1.75), respectively. Overweight and obese participants with high physical activity did not show a higher
CVD risk (HRs (95%CIs) 1.03 (0.82–1.29) and 1.12 (0.83–1.52), respectively).
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the beneficial impact of physical activity on CVD might outweigh the negative
impact of body mass index among middle-aged and elderly people. This emphasizes the importance of physical activity for
everyone across all body mass index strata, while highlighting the risk associated with inactivity even among normal
weight people.

Introduction
Although overweight and obesity are associated with
an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD),1–3
higher levels of physical activity are associated with a
decreased risk of CVD.4–6 However, to what extent
physical activity can counterbalance the risk associated
with overweight and obesity remains unclear.
Several studies have investigated the combined asso-
ciation of physical activity and body mass index (BMI)
with CVD risk in middle-aged adults, but the results are
inconsistent.7–12 A review combining studies that eval-
uated the risk associated with obesity and physical
activity reported that four of eight studies favoured

 the hypothesis that the risk for cardiovascular mortality
was lower in obese participants with high physical
activity than in normal weight participants with low
levels of physical activity.13 A study by Weinstein
et al.,8 which assessed the joint effect of physical activity
and BMI on coronary heart disease in women, reported
that the risk of coronary heart disease associated with
increased BMI was considerably reduced by higher
levels of physical activity. These results indicate that
the risk of CVD associated with a high BMI might be
partly negated by physical activity. However, these pre-
vious studies included middle-aged participants and
information among the elderly population remains
scarce. It has been suggested that the risk of myocardial
infarction and stroke associated with overweight and
obesity are attenuated in older adults.14 This might be
because BMI in older adults is a poor indicator of body
fat and body fat distribution and BMI alone might not
be a good indicator of CVD risk.15 Lean mass and fat
mass may act as nutritional preserves during illness.
Physical activity levels tend to decrease with age16
and therefore the role of physical activity on the asso-
ciation between BMI and CVD could differ between
younger, middle-aged and elderly adults.
The current study aimed to investigate the role of
physical activity in the association between BMI and
CVD among middle-aged and elderly participants using
data
from
the
large
population-based
Rotterdam
Study.
Methods
Study population
This study was embedded within the Rotterdam Study,
a prospective population-based cohort study among
people aged 55 years or older in the municipality of
Rotterdam, The Netherlands. The baseline examin-
ation of the original cohort (RS-I) was completed
between 1990 and 1993. In 2000–2001, the Rotterdam
Study was extended with 3011 participants who had
become �55 years old or had moved into the study
district (RS-II). For the current study, we used data
from participants attending the third examination of
the original cohort (RS-I-3) between 1997 and 1999
(n ¼ 4797) and the participants attending the first exam-
ination of the extended cohort (RS-II-1) between 2000
and 2001 (n ¼ 3011). Of this combined total (n ¼ 7808),
6510 participants completed data collection for both
physical activity and BMI. Total of 1122 people with
prevalent CVD were excluded and six were excluded
due to missing follow-up data. Participants who were
considered being as underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m2)
were also excluded (n ¼ 38). Eventually, 5344 partici-
pants were included in the analyses. Trained research
assistants interviewed the participants at home to col-
lect the baseline information.
All participants gave written informed consent and
the study protocol was approved by the medical ethics
committee of Erasmus University, Rotterdam. Detailed
information on the design of the Rotterdam Study can
be found elsewhere.17 The Rotterdam Study has been
approved by the institutional review board (medical
ethics committee) of the Erasmus Medical Center and
by the medical ethics committee according to the Wet
Bevolkingsonderzoek ERGO (Population Study Act
Rotterdam
Study),
executed
by
the
Ministry
of
Health, Welfare and Sports of The Netherlands.
Assessment of anthropometric data and
physical activity
Height and weight were measured with the participants
standing without shoes and heavy outer garments. BMI
was calculated as weight divided by height squared
(kg/m2). Physical activity levels were assessed with an
adapted version of the Zutphen Physical Activity
Questionnaire,18
including
questions
regarding
walking, cycling, sports, gardening and housekeeping
activities. To quantify the intensity of activity, we
assigned metabolic equivalent of task (MET) scores to
all activities according to the 2011 updated version of
the Compendium of Physical Activities.19 We multi-
plied the MET values of specific activities with time
(in hours) per week spent in that activity to calculate
MET�hours�week�1
in
the
total
physical
activity.
Further details on the assessment of physical activity
has been reported elsewhere.20
Assessment of confounders. Alcohol use was defined as the
number of glasses per day. Education was assessed
according to the standard classification of education
comparable with the international standard classifica-
tion of education and was grouped into four categories:
elementary
education;
lower
secondary
education;
higher secondary education; and tertiary education.21
Smoking was divided into two categories: current and
other (former and never). Dietary information was not
collected at the same time as the physical activity data
were collected and therefore we used the diet informa-
tion measured in the first examination of the original
cohort (RS-I-1 between 1989 and 1993) and in the third
examination of the extended cohort (RS-II-3 between
2011 and 2012). Information on diet was obtained
through a 170-item validated semi-quantitative food
frequency questionnaire.22 From the questionnaire, an
overall healthy diet score representing adherence to the
Dutch dietary guidelines was calculated as described
previously.23 A family history of premature myocardial
infarction was defined as having a parent, sibling or
934

 child who experienced a myocardial infarction at the
age of �65 years and was used as a binary variable
(yes/no). As 97.6 % of our participants were white,
adjustment for ethnicity was not required.
Clinical outcomes. The main outcome measure under
study was incident hard atherosclerotic CVD composed
of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, other cor-
onary heart disease mortality, and fatal and non-fatal
stroke.24 Data on clinical outcomes including CVD
were
collected
through
an
automated
follow-up
system involving digital linkage of the study database
to medical records managed by general practitioners
working in the research area. Trained research assist-
ants collected notes, outpatient clinic reports, hospital
discharge
letters,
electrocardiograms
and
imaging
results from general practitioners and hospital records.
Research physicians then independently adjudicated all
the data on potential events. Medical specialists, whose
judgements were considered decisive, then reviewed the
potential cases. Information on vital status was add-
itionally obtained from the central registry of the muni-
cipality of the city of Rotterdam. Follow-up was
complete until 1 January 2012.
Statistical analysis
Participants were classified as having a high or low level
of total physical activity by using the median value.
Normal
weight
(<25 kg/m2),
overweight
(25–
29.9 kg/m2) and obese (�30 kg/m2) participants were
categorized as being high or low physically active, form-
ing six categories. Baseline characteristics of the study
population are presented as mean � SD values (or fre-
quency and percentage when appropriate) for the six
phenotypes formed by the physical activity levels
(lower and higher) across different BMI categories.
We first estimated the CVD risk associated with the
BMI categories and with physical activity using Cox
proportional hazards regression analysis. In our main
analysis, we used Cox proportional hazards regression
analysis to estimate the hazards ratio (HR) and 95%
confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the six phenotypes
in association with CVD, using normal weight with
high levels of physical activity as the reference cat-
egory. Proportional hazards assumptions were con-
firmed in all Cox models by visually comparing the
Kaplan–Meier curves of the different groups. The
models were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, alcohol
use, education, diet quality and family history of pre-
mature myocardial infarction. We decided a priori not
to adjust for systolic blood pressure, total or high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol or plasma glucose, as
they are all intermediates in the association between
BMI and CVD.
Physical activity, BMI and the joint BMI and phys-
ical activity phenotypes were entered as categorical
variables in the model. We also assessed whether
there was a trend across categories of BMI by entering
the categorical BMI variable as continuous in the
model. We did not observe a significant interaction of
sex or age with BMI, physical activity or the joint BMI
and physical activity phenotypes. No multiplicative or
additive interaction between BMI and physical activity
was observed.
Sensitivity analyses. As a result of the high competing risk
of non-CVD death among elderly people, we performed
a competing risk analysis using the method proposed
by Fine and Gray.25 We also repeated the main analysis
in participants older than 65 years to specifically exam-
ine associations in elderly people. We further investi-
gated the possible effect of reverse causation by
excluding events in the first two years. We repeated
the analysis in participants without missing information
on diet.
We had 24.6% missing data on diet quality. For
other covariates, we had <5% missing data. We used
the single imputation by the Expectation Maximization
method in SPSS. The analyses were performed using
IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (IBM, Armonk,
NY, USA) and R version 3.2.1 (R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Statistical sig-
nificance was accepted at p < 0.05.
Results
The median level of physical activity by which the two
physical activity categories were created was 79.4
MET�hours�week�1.
The
median
and
interquartile
range (IQR) for the high and low categories were
111.3 (93.7–139.6) and 54.6 (39.0–67.5), respectively.
These numbers correspond to four hours and two
hours per day of moderate intensity physical activity
(4 MET). Table 1 shows the characteristics of the par-
ticipants by the level of physical activity and BMI cat-
egory. The participants with low levels of physical
activity were more often male, older and current smo-
kers than the participants with a high level of physical
activity. The mean age of the population was 68.5 years
(standard deviation 7.9; range 55–97 years) and 60.1%
were women. There were 866 (16.2%) incident CVD
events during a median follow-up of 10.3 years.
Table 2 presents the association of BMI categories
and level of physical activity with incident CVD
separately. Compared with normal weight participants,
overweight (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.97–1.57) and obese
(HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.99–1.46) participants were not at
significantly increased risk of CVD. In addition, we
observed no significant trend across categories of
Koolhaas et al.
935
 BMI (p ¼ 0.05 for trend). Compared with the higher
level of physical activity (irrespective of obesity), par-
ticipants with a low level of physical activity were at
higher risk of CVD (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06–1.41).
Figure 1 shows the association between the joint
physical activity and BMI phenotypes with incident
CVD. Compared with normal weight participants with
high levels of physical activity, the risk of CVD was not
significantly different in overweight (HR 1.03, 95% CI
0.82–1.29) and obese (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.83–1.52) par-
ticipants with a high level of physical activity. By con-
trast, overweight and obese participants with a low level
of physical activity were at increased risk of CVD com-
pared with normal weight participants with high phys-
ical activity. The corresponding HRs (95%CIs) were
1.33 (1.07–1.66) and 1.35 (1.04–1.75), respectively.

 Sensitivity analyses
Table S1 in the supplementary data (available online)
shows that the HRs (95% CIs) from the competing risk
approach were not substantially different from our ori-
ginal analysis. When we repeated the main analysis in
adults aged �65 years, or when we excluded the first
two years of follow-up, we found similar results (Table
S2 and S3 in the supplementary data; available online)
to those in the total population. The results for the
participants with information on diet quality were simi-
lar to the main analysis (Table S4 in the supplementary
data; available online).
Discussion
In
this
population-based
study
of
adults
aged
�55 years, overweight and obese participants with
high levels of physical activity were not at increased
risk of CVD compared with their normal weight coun-
terparts. By contrast, among the participants with
lower levels of physical activity, being overweight and
obese was associated with a higher risk of CVD. Low
physical activity levels increased the risk of CVD in the
total population. These findings suggest that the impact
of physical activity on CVD might outweigh that of
BMI among middle-aged and elderly participants.
Similar studies regarding the joint association of
BMI and physical activity with CVD are consistent
with our findings.7–12 A study of 18,892 Finish men
and women aged 25–74 years concluded that physical
inactivity has an independent association with risk of
CVD, whereas obesity increases the risk through the
modification of other risk factors.11 In addition, the
Women’s Health Study found that the risk of coronary
heart disease associated with elevated BMI is consider-
ably
reduced
by
higher
physical
activity
levels.8
However, the risk was not completely eliminated,
which reinforces the importance of being lean and
physically active.8 Similarly, the analysis from the
Nurse’s Health Study of 88,393 women aged �34–59
years showed that being moderately physically active
attenuated, but did not eliminate, the adverse effect of
obesity on the risk of coronary heart disease.7 They also
showed that being lean did not counteract the increased
risk associated with physical inactivity.7
In the current study, we extended the evidence to
middle-aged and elderly participants. We showed
that, once analysed separately, the magnitude of the
association between reduced physical activity and
CVD was roughly similar to that between obesity and
CVD, although the latter did not reach statistical sig-
nificance. However, once analysed jointly, overweight
and obese participants with high levels of physical
activity were not at a significantly increased risk of
CVD, whereas being overweight and obese was asso-
ciated with an increased risk of CVD among physically
inactive participants. Our results, although not refuting
the cardiovascular risk associated with overweight and
obesity, suggest that the impact of physical activity on
CVD might outweigh that of BMI among middle-aged
and elderly adults.
In addition to leisure time physical activity, we
included transportation and housework in the assess-
ment of total physical activity in the current study.
Therefore our results extend previous findings and indi-
cate that overall higher levels of physical activity (irre-
spective and beyond leisure time) can be beneficial to
reduce CVD risk. Our study was conducted in an older
population. Elderly participants might have more diffi-
culties in engaging in sport or exercise (leisure time
physical activity) and spend a relatively large propor-
tion of their time on housework compared with
younger participants.26 Our study emphasizes the
importance of the beneficial effects of physical activity
as part of our daily life, as supported by recent
recommendations.27
Overweight and obese participants with a low level
of physical activity had a 1.33 and 1.35 times higher
risk of CVD than normal weight participants with a
high level of physical activity. Other studies7,8,11,12
have reported a up to three times higher CHD risk7,8
and up to 2.36 times higher CVD risk11,12 for obese
participants with low physical activity compared with
normal weight participants with high activity. The
lower risk in the current study might be explained by
the relatively high levels of physical activity in the low
physical activity group. The median level of physical
activity

group

 MET�hours�week�1, corresponding to two hours per
day of moderate intensity physical activity. This is a
higher physical activity level than reported in the low
group of other studies.7,8,11,12 However, although our
risk estimates were relatively low, our results do not
indicate that the risk associated with inactivity should
be neglected. For public health programmes, it remains
important to focus on increasing the physical activity
levels of populations and to concomitantly stress body
weight management.
The mechanism underlying the harmful effect of
overweight and obesity on CVD risk has been well
investigated. Adipose tissue releases free fatty acids,
interleukins
and
cytokines
that
influence
cardiac
function
by
accelerating
atherosclerotic
processes,
inflammation, and endothelial and coagulation dys-
function.28,29
The
plausible
mechanisms
through
which physical activity has been suggested to improve
CVD risk are improved endothelial function, stabiliza-
tion of vulnerable plaques (preventing plaque rupture)
and reduced myocardial oxygen demand.30 This indi-
cates that physical activity directly reduces and com-
bats the harmful effect of the prothrombotic factors
released by adipose tissue.8,31
Obese participants with high levels of physical activ-
ity conferred a similar risk of CVD as normal weight
participants with low level of physical activity when we
compared both groups with normal weight participants
with a high level of physical activity. Notably, both
groups were at higher risk of CVD, although the
associations did not reach the significance threshold.
These
findings
suggest
that
being
lean
might
counteract the increased risk associated with physical
inactivity, and being physically active could possibly
slightly offset the increased risk of being obese.
Therefore our study confirms previous findings that
physically active and lean participants are at low risk
of CVD7,11 and extends these findings to middle-aged
and elderly participants.
The major strengths of the current study are its pro-
spective population-based design, the large sample size
of adults aged �55 years and the relatively long follow-
up period. We had a reliable assessment of CVD events
and were able to adjust for several lifestyle factors,
thereby minimizing the possibility of the observed asso-
ciations being explained by confounding. However, sev-
eral
limitations
should
be
considered.
First,
our
conclusions are drawn from baseline measurements.
Therefore some misclassification could have occurred
due to changes in BMI or physical activity levels
during follow-up. However, weight gain tends to be
linear over time and therefore the difference between
the groups is likely to remain constant, even with
weight change.8 Our results are based on self-reported
physical activity. Although our questionnaire has been
shown to be both valid and reliable,32 potential recall
bias and social desirability cannot be excluded. These
last two limitations could have resulted in bias towards
the null hypothesis. Information on diet quality was not
collected at the same time as BMI and physical activity.
We acknowledge this limitation and used this informa-
tion as a proxy of diet quality. Information on diet
quality was missing for 24.6% of participants and
was therefore imputed. Although we cannot fully
exclude the possibility of residual confounding by diet
quality, restricting the analysis to participants with diet
information revealed comparable results. It may be
hypothesized
that
participants
with
poor
health
engage in less physical activity than others, thereby
creating
the
opportunity
for
reverse
causation.
However,
in
our
analyses,
exclusion
events
that
occurred within the first two years of follow-up
showed comparable results.
In this long-term follow-up study of older adults, the
risk associated with overweight and obesity was attenu-
ated in participants with high physical activity levels.
This suggests that regular physical activity reduces the
CVD risk in older adults and that further benefits can
be gained from maintaining a healthy weight.
