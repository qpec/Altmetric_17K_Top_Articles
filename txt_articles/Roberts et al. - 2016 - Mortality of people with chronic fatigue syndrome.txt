South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust 
Biomedical Research Centre (SLaM BRC) Clinical Record 
Interactive Search (CRIS) Register

Summary
Background Mortality associated with chronic fatigue syndrome is uncertain. We investigated mortality in individuals 
diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in secondary and tertiary care using data from the South London and 
Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust Biomedical Research Centre (SLaM BRC) Clinical Record Interactive Search 
(CRIS) register.
Methods We calculated standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) for all-cause, suicide-specifi
 c, and cancer-specifi
 c 
mortality for a 7-year observation period using the number of deaths observed in SLaM records compared with age-
specifi
 c and sex-specifi
 c mortality statistics for England and Wales. Study participants were included if they had had 
contact with the chronic fatigue service (referral, discharge, or case note entry) and received a diagnosis of chronic 
fatigue syndrome.
Findings We identifi
 ed 2147 cases of chronic fatigue syndrome from CRIS and 17 deaths from Jan 1, 2007, to Dec 31, 
2013. 1533 patients were women of whom 11 died, and 614 were men of whom six died. There was no signifi
 cant 
diff
 erence in age-standardised and sex-standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) for all-cause mortality (SMR 1·14, 95% CI 
0·65–1·85; p=0·67) or cancer-specifi
 c mortality (1·39, 0·60–2·73; p=0·45) in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome 
when compared with the general population in England and Wales. This remained the case when deaths from suicide 
were removed from the analysis. There was a signifi
 cant increase in suicide-specifi
 c mortality (SMR 6·85, 95% CI 
2·22–15·98; p=0·002).
Interpretation We did not note increased all-cause mortality in people with chronic fatigue syndrome, but our fi
 ndings 
show a substantial increase in mortality from suicide. This highlights the need for clinicians to be aware of the 
increased risk of completed suicide and to assess suicidality adequately in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.

Introduction
Chronic fatigue syndrome is an illness characterised by 
persistent or relapsing fatigue of a debilitating nature, 
which is present for at least 6 months, in addition to at 
least four symptoms from a range including memory 
loss, poor concentration, joint pain, and tender glands.1,2 
Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome usually have 
extensive investigations to ensure any potential treatable 
medical causes of fatigue are addressed. By defi
 nition, at 
diagnosis, individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome are 
free of prespecifi
 ed major medical and psychiatric 
disorders leading to prolonged fatigue, and therefore 
might be expected to have a mortality risk similar to, or 
indeed lower than, the general population.1–3
Although claims have been made on the basis of small, 
uncontrolled, clinical case series of higher overall death 
risks for heart failure, cancer, and suicide in people with 
chronic fatigue syndrome,4,5 a review of descriptive 
studies that reported follow-up or outcome data from 
patients with a primary diagnosis of chronic fatigue 
syndrome showed no convincing evidence of increased 
all-cause 
mortality 
or 
suicide-specifi
 c 
mortality.6 
Specifi
 cally, only one study has compared the mortality 
within a cohort of individuals with chronic fatigue 
syndrome (n=641) with that of the general population,7 
and reported no signifi
 cant increase in all-cause 
mortality adjusted for sex, race, age, and calendar time 
(standardised mortality ratio [SMR] 0·7, 95% CI 0·4–1·2; 
14 deaths). Although the relative risk of suicide was 
raised in this cohort (SMR 3·6, 95% CI 0·4–12·9; 
two deaths), limited statistical power made it diffi
  cult to 
draw conclusions about excess suicide risk in people

with chronic fatigue syndrome. By contrast, anecdotal 
accounts in various internet and patient forums 
repeatedly report increased all-cause mortality.8,9
Mortality associated with chronic fatigue syndrome 
remains uncertain, and larger studies are needed to 
further address the issue of chronic fatigue syndrome as 
a risk factor for all-cause and specifi
 c causes of mortality. 
Therefore, we investigated a retrospective cohort 
consisting of people diagnosed with chronic fatigue 
syndrome, using data from the national research and 
treatment service for chronic fatigue at the South London 
and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) and King’s 
College London Hospital (KCH).
Method
Setting and study population
The cohort of patients assessed in this study was 
assimilated from the Clinical Record Interactive 
Search (CRIS),10 a case register system that provides 
de-identifi
 ed information from electronic clinical 
records relating to secondary and tertiary mental health 
care services across SLaM. SLaM is a National Health 
Service (NHS) mental health trust that provides 
secondary mental health care to a population of roughly 
1·3 million residents of four London boroughs 
(Lambeth, Southwark, Lewisham, and Croydon), and 
additionally in collaboration with King’s College Hospital 
(KCH), provides a single secondary and tertiary care 
national referral service for individuals with suspected 
chronic fatigue syndrome, accepting referrals from 
general practitioners, general and specialist physicians, 
occupational physicians, con 
sultant psychiatrists, and 
community mental health teams. As is the system in the 
NHS in England and Wales, all referrals need to be 
approved by the local clinical commissioning groups 
before they can be seen at the service.
Electronic 
clinical 
records 
have 
been 
used 
comprehensively across all SLaM services since 2006. 
CRIS was established in 2008 to allow searching and 
retrieval of full but de-identifi
 ed clinical information for 
research purposes with a permission of secondary data 
analysis, approved by the Oxfordshire Research Ethics 
Committee C (reference 08/H0606/71+5).10
The chronic fatigue syndrome service follows a 
routine assessment procedure, in which all patients 
undergo medical screening to exclude detectable 
organic illness, including a minimum of physical 
examination, urinalysis, full blood count, urea and 
electrolytes, thyroid function tests, liver function tests, 
tissue transglutaminase, and erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate. Patients were interviewed with a semi-structured 
diagnostic interview to establish whether they had 
fatigue and whether they met the 1994 case defi
 nition 
or Oxford criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome.1,11,12 
Additionally, we had information about whether 
patients fulfi
 lled chronic fatigue syndrome criteria as 
defi
 ned by the National Institute of Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE).13 Patients with the 1994 case 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO for all studies 
published from database inception to April 1, 2015, using the 
following search terms: [“mortalit*” and (“chronic fatigue 
syndrome” or “chronic-fatigue syndrome” or “CFS” or 
“post-viral fatigue syndrome” or “post viral fatigue syndrome” 
or “CFS/ME” or “ME/CFS” or “myalgic encephalomyelitis” or 
“myalgic encephalomyelopathy”)]. We initially assessed the 
titles and abstracts identifi
 ed by the search and excluded 
articles that were deemed not relevant. We reviewed the full 
text of the remaining articles for inclusion, and all relevant 
references were checked for additional citations. We included 
studies that compared mortality in individuals with chronic 
fatigue syndrome with that of controls without the disorder.
The search process identifi
 ed 121 unique records. We assessed 
three full text articles for eligibility and included one study 
comparing the mortality of individuals with chronic fatigue 
syndrome with that of a general population control. The results 
suggested no increased all-cause or suicide-specifi
 c mortality in 
641 individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome (standardised 
mortality ratios [SMRs] 0·7, 95% CI 0·4–1·2 and 3·6, 0·4–12·9, 
respectively); however, the study was limited by its small 
sample size, with both all-cause and suicide-specifi
 c mortality 
outcomes receiving a GRADE rating of very low quality 
evidence. As such whether chronic fatigue syndrome is 
associated with a diff
 ering mortality compared with the general 
population remains unknown.
Added value of this study
We report the largest study of mortality in patients with chronic 
fatigue syndrome available so far, with 2147 individuals 
diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome. Our fi
 ndings showed 
that although the overall and cancer-specifi
 c mortality of patients 
with chronic fatigue syndrome was not signifi
 cantly diff
 erent to 
that of the general population, we noted an increased risk of 
completed suicide in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome 
when compared with a population control. Individuals with a 
diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome and a lifetime diagnosis of 
depression might be at increased risk of completed suicide.
Implications of all the available evidence
The evidence highlights the need for clinicians to be aware of 
the increased risk of completed suicide and to assess suicidality 
adequately in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. Future 
studies should focus on identifi
 cation of protective measures 
that can reduce suicide-related mortality in patients with 
chronic fatigue syndrome.

defi
 nition-specifi
 ed exclusionary psychiatric disorders 
and also somatisation disorder (DSM-IV) were excluded 
from this study. For this study we adopted the most 
inclusive criteria, and thus included all patients with a 
clinical diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome. A 
subsample of 755 patients had full diagnostic criteria 
applied prospectively of which 65% met Oxford criteria, 
58% the 1994 case defi
 nition criteria, and 88% NICE 
criteria. All patients in this sample met at least 
one criterion. All were clinic attendees referred within 
the UK NHS and have been shown to be a representative 
sample of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome 
in secondary and tertiary care, similar to those in 
Australia, 
the 
USA, 
Scotland, 
England, 
and 
Northern Ireland.14–16
Study participants were included if they had had 
contact with the chronic fatigue service (referral, 
discharge, or case note entry) and received a diagnosis 
of chronic fatigue syndrome from Jan 1, 2007, to 
Dec 31, 2013.
Anyone who was active as a patient with chronic 
fatigue syndrome or newly diagnosed as a patient with 
chronic fatigue syndrome at any point of this period was 
followed up until their death or the end of the 
observation period. The diagnosis was ascertained from 
having received the prespecifi
 ed clinic code for a chronic 
fatigue syndrome diagnosis, which was the ICD-10 code 
for neurasthenia (F48.0) in structured fi
 elds within 
CRIS, and was supplemented by a bespoke natural 
language processing application developed at SLaM 
using General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) 
software, which extracts and returns diagnostic 
statements from open-text fi
 elds of the source electronic 
health records.17 We emphasise that we do not use the 
category or criteria for neurasthenia in either our 
clinical or research practice—it is just a computer code 
imposed by our data or fi
 nancial management systems 
that run across the trust and which are based on 
the ICD-10.
Mortality identifi
 cation
The analysis outcome is mortality over a 7-year 
observation window (2007–13, the at-risk period). In 
each NHS trust, a list of deceased people is obtained on 
a monthly basis from the “Service User Death Report” 
of “the Spine”, maintained by NHS Care Records 
Service.18 Therefore, the date of death of each deceased 
patient ever served by SLaM is recorded. Further routine 
checking occurs for details, including the cause of 
death, which were retrieved from the diagnosis (1a) in 
death certifi
 cate via linkage with nationwide data from 
the UK Offi
  ce of National Statistics, and classifi
 ed by 
code of the 10th edition of the WHO International 
Classifi
 cation of Diseases (ICD-10). ICD-10 codes for 
cause of death were searched and ascribed to malignant 
neoplasm (ICD-10 codes: C00-97), suicide (ICD-10 
codes: X60-84), or other causes.
Covariates in analysis
Date of birth, sex, and ethnic origin were routinely 
recorded in NHS medical records. For the classifi
 cation 
of age bands, the index date was set as July 1, 2010 (ie, the 
mid-point of the at-risk period), or at death, whichever 
came fi
 rst, to defi
 ne age. Ethnic group was divided 
into four categories: white, black, Asian, and mixed, 
unknown, or other. Presence of a lifetime diagnosis of 
depression was defi
 ned as having had a recorded 
depressive episode (ICD-10 code: F32.x) or recurrent 
depressive disorder (F33.x). Multiple deprivation score 
(or the indices of multiple deprivation), a measure of 
socioeconomic status developed by the UK Offi
  ce of 
National Statistics, which combines various indicators to 
include a range of economic, social, and housing 
dimensions into one deprivation score for each small 
area in the UK, was also available for analysis.19
Statistical analysis
SMRs were calculated for the cohort of patients with 
chronic fatigue syndrome during the 7-year observation 
period, using number of deaths observed in SLaM 
records as the numerator. The denominator was the 
expected number of deaths, estimated by 5-year age 
bands, and sex-specifi
 c mortality rates for the England 
and Wales population in 2011 multiplied by the weighting 
of average person-years in the at-risk period experienced 
by chronic fatigue syndrome patients in each age and 
sex category.20 We also did stratifi
 ed analyses of SMRs by 
splitting the target population into groups for ethnic 
category, presence or absence of a lifetime diagnosis of 
depression, and tertiles of multiple deprivation scores. 
Focusing on suicide-related mortality of particular 
interest, we adapted competing risk regression, a 
modifi
 ed Cox modelling method developed by Fine and 
Gray21 for univariate and multivariate analysis, with 
suicide-specifi
 c deaths as the target events and other 
causes of death as competing outcomes. Subhazard 
ratios and their 95% CIs were thus generated with the 
existence of lifetime diagnosis of depression as the 
major exposure of interest. This time-to-event analysis 
method accounts for the fact that cohort members are 
subject to various potential competing causes of death, 
which might occur ahead of the specifi
 c cause of interest. 
The main purpose of the modifi
 cation of the Cox model 
was to discriminate censoring between deaths from 
other causes and end of follow-up or loss to follow-up to 
have a better estimation of relative risk on the specifi
 c 
event of interest (suicide-specifi
 c mortality) within the 
chronic fatigue syndrome cohort. We regarded age and 
sex as potential confounders in the multivariate analysis. 
Tertile of multiple deprivation score and ethnic origin 
were too extreme (because no one died in some smaller 
categories) to be imputed as potential confounders in 
multivariate analysis. All analyses were done by 
STATA SE (version 12) and the signifi
 cance level was 
set as 0·05.

Results
We identifi
 ed 2147 cases of chronic fatigue syndrome in 
CRIS with 17 deaths. Of them, 1533 patients were women 
of whom 11 died, and 614 were men of whom six died. 
Eight deaths were from malignant neoplasm, fi
 ve from 
suicide, and four from other causes.
There 
was 
no 
signifi
 cant 
diff
 erence 
in 
age-
standardised and sex-standardised mortality ratios for 
all-cause mortality (SMR 1·14; 95% CI 0·5–1·85; 
p=0·67) or cancer-related mortality (1·39; 0·60–2·73; 
p=0·45). This remained the case when stratifi
 ed by sex, 
and when those deaths from external causes were 
removed from the analysis. However, there was a 
signifi
 cant increase in suicide mortality with an SMR of 
6·85 (95% CI 2·22–15·98; p=0·002; table 1). Although 
the suicide-specifi
 c SMR was signifi
 cantly increased 
compared with the general population, if there had been 
two fewer deaths by suicide, this result would have been 
non-signifi
 cant, although the eff
 ect size (SMR>4) would 
still be indicative of a strong eff
 ect. Table 1 shows 
detailed SMRs for the study cohort.
1583 patients were white, 93 black, 48 Asian, and 
423 other, mixed or unknown ethnic origin (table 2). 
One patient who died from cancer had a missing 
ethnicity value and was excluded from the analysis. All 
other patients who died were white. When restricted to 
only include white patients, there remained no 
signifi
 cant diff
 erence in age-standardised SMR for all-
cause mortality (SMR 1·44, 95% CI 0·82–2·34; p=0·20) 
or cancer-specifi
 c mortality (1·09, 0·36–2·55; p=0·96; 
table 1). Suicide-specifi
 c mortality remained signifi
 cantly 
elevated (9·12, 2·96–21·27; p<0·0001).
When stratifi
 ed by lifetime diagnosis of depression, 
216 patients had a recorded lifetime diagnosis of F32.x or 
F33.x. Four (26%) of 17 patients who died had a lifetime 
diagnosis of depression, for two of whom the cause of 
death was suicide. No signifi
 cance was identifi
 ed for all-
cause (SMR 2·44, 95% CI 0·66–6·24; p=0·17), suicide-
specifi
 c (3·06, 0·37–11·07; p=0·28), or cancer-specifi
 c 
mortality (0·22, 0·01–1·22; p=0·11) by the presence of 
lifetime diagnosis of depression.
The mean multiple deprivation score (MDS) was 22·4% 
(SD 12·4), suggesting that the average patient in our cohort 
lived in less deprived areas than 78% of the UK population. 
64 (3%) of 2147 patients had missing MDS values of whom 
one died from suicide and was excluded from the analysis.

and sex-standardised SMRs for all-cause or cancer-related 
mortality in any tertile of the MDS. Suicide-specifi
 c 
mortality remained signifi
 cantly increased in the lower 
(SMR 8·96, 95% CI 1·08–32·35; p=0·04) and middle 
(8·75, 1·06–31·61; p=0·045) MDS tertile. There were no 
deaths from suicide in the upper MDS tertile (table 1).
With regards to the outcomes of competing risk 
regression using the signifi
 cantly increased suicide-
related mortality as the specifi
 c event of interest, 
univariate analyses showed that women with chronic 
fatigue syndrome had a highly raised but not signifi
 cant 
relative risk of death from suicide-specifi
 c causes 
 
(subhazard ratio 2·57; 95% CI 0·37–17·89; p=0·34). 
Patients with a lifetime diagnosis of depression had a 
high risk of dying from suicide (subhazard ratio 9·57; 
95% CI 1·34–68·13; p=0·02). The result remained 
signifi
 cant when age and sex were controlled as 
confounders (9·61, 1·44–64·21; p=0·02; table 3).
Discussion
Although the all-cause and cancer-specifi
 c mortality of 
patients with chronic fatigue syndrome in specialist care 
was not signifi
 cantly diff
 erent to that of the general 
population, the risk of suicide was higher. This is the fi
 rst 
study to show a specifi
 c increased risk of suicide in a 
population of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome 
compared with the general population; however, if there 
had been two fewer deaths by suicide, this risk would not 
be signifi
 cantly increased.22
There are limitations to our data including that, despite 
being the largest study of mortality in chronic fatigue 
syndrome available so far, the sample size is still modest. 
The all-cause mortality gave an estimation of SMR close 
to 1, and the study had insuffi
  cient statistical power to 
identify such a small eff
 ect size with a wide confi
 dence 
interval. The SMR for suicide is greatly increased and 
although the estimate is imprecise, it is highly unlikely 
that the result is due to chance. The modest sample size 
limited our ability to explore other cause-specifi
 c 
mortality, or the eff
 ect of chronic fatigue syndrome on 
mortality in subgroups of patients. In view of the 
observational nature of the study design, and the limited 
number of confounders measured and controlled, it is 
possible that the fi
 ndings are a result of confounding. 
For example, because we relied on population mortality 
rates, we were unable to control for smoking, BMI, and a 
range of chronic diseases that might aff
 ect mortality risk. 
Although the joint chronic fatigue syndrome service 
off
 ered by SLaM and KCH is a national referral service, 
more than 80% of patients in the cohort were resident in 
the south of England, and as such national mortality 
statistics may not be representative of this region. 
However, previous work to establish sensitivity between 
mortality in “England and Wales” and London concluded 
there was no signifi
 cant diff
 erence between the mortality 
estimates.18 We also accept that the cohort is quite 
young and it might, at least theoretically, be possible that 
diff
 erential mortality rates could have emerged after the 
7-year observation window.
Patients concerned by ongoing fatigue symptoms might 
not wish to be referred to mental health services or be 
assessed by a psychiatrist. Reasons for this are 
multifactorial but include the perceived stigma of 
psychological and rehabilitation treatment, and some 
patients’ views that the cause of their symptoms is 
biological precludes any form of psychological treatment. 
Because the referral pathway for this centre includes a full 
assessment including a psychiatric evaluation, an 
argument could be made that cases referred to the joint 
SLaM and KCH service may not be representative of 
chronic fatigue syndrome cases seen in secondary and 
tertiary care, and may include a referral bias, favouring 
patients with more severe chronic fatigue syndrome, 
psychiatric comorbidity, and higher socioeconomic status. 
However, the study sample has previously been shown to 
be typical of secondary and tertiary care cases in the UK 
and internationally.15 We recognise the sample might not 
be generalisable to primary-care or community-based 
samples of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome,14,23 or 
generalisable to health-care settings in which services are 
not free to consumers. However, due to the no-cost setting, 
we are more likely to capture a broad coverage of source 
population when compared with insurance-based national 
services, and only moderate to severe cases not seen by the 
service would be those that can aff
 ord private medical care 
in the UK. Because this study is restricted to patients aged 
over 15 years the results cannot be extrapolated to children 
with chronic fatigue syndrome. Finally, our results might 
be aff
 ected by prevalence bias whereby cases known to a 
service within a given time are dominated by those with 
prolonged clinical courses; therefore, they cannot be taken 
to generalise to incident cases.
Much research has been done to investigate the 
association between chronic fatigue syndrome and 
psychiatric disorder comorbidity. A signifi
 cant cross- 
sectional and prospective association exists between 
chronic fatigue syndrome and non-exclusionary psychiatric 
disorder comorbidity,24–26 with depression and anxiety 
disorders being strongly associated with chronic fatigue 
syndrome. The incidence of detected comorbidity of 
psychiatric disorder are similar to those seen elsewhere.27

The lack of increase in all-cause mortality within the 
chronic fatigue syndrome cohort compared with the 
general population contrasts with that observed in most 
psychiatric disorders, which show increased mortality 
especially due to accidents, cancer, and cardiovascular 
disease.18 The reasons for the normal all-cause mortality 
may be that these patients might have good health 
behaviours, an inherently smaller eff
 ect size, or that all-
cause mortality is confounded by the higher socioeconomic 
status of the patient cohort.
Although the suicide-specifi
 c SMR is raised compared 
with the general population, it is lower than for 
psychiatric disorders including aff
 ective disorders, 
personality disorders, and alcohol dependence reported 
in other population-based studies.28
This study highlights the importance of adequate 
assessment of mood and other psychiatric symptoms in 
patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, because lifetime 
diagnosis of depression is an independent risk factor for 
increased risk of completed suicide in this population. 
Although completed suicide was a rare event, the 
fi
 ndings strengthen the case for robust psychiatric 
assessment by mental health professionals when 
managing individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome.
