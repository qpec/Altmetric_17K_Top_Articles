Background: Sleep disturbances and poor rest-activity rhythms, which can reduce the quality of life, are highly prevalent among
patients with lung cancer.
Methods: This trial investigated the effects of a 12-week exercise intervention including home-based walking exercise training
and weekly exercise counseling on 111 lung cancer patients. Participants were randomly allocated to receive the intervention or
usual-care. Outcomes included objective sleep (total sleep time, TST; sleep efficiency, SE; sleep onset latency, SOL; and wake
after sleep onset, WASO), subjective sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), and rest-activity rhythms (r24 and IoO).
Outcomes were assessed at baseline and 3 and 6 months after intervention.
Results: The PSQI (Wald w2 ¼ 15.16, P ¼ 0.001) and TST (Wald w2 ¼ 7.59, P ¼ 0.023) of the patients in the exercise group significantly
improved 3 and 6 months after intervention. The moderating effect of IoO on TST was significant (b of group � IoO ¼ 3.70,
P ¼ 0.032).
Conclusions: The walking program is an effective intervention for improving the subjective and objective sleep quality of lung
cancer patients and can be considered an optional component of lung cancer rehabilitation.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in Taiwan (Ministry
of Health and Welfare, 2013) and worldwide (Siegel et al, 2013).
Patients with lung cancer often experience sleep disturbances during
and after treatment (Chen et al, 2008) with a prevalence of 45–57%
(Gooneratne et al, 2007; Chen et al, 2008). Sleep disturbances can
affect the quality of life (Gooneratne et al, 2007) and even the
prognosis (Wang et al, 2008) of patients with lung cancer as well as
disrupt their rest-activity rhythms (Levin et al, 2005). In general, sleep
quality is subjectively assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
Index (PSQI), in which a score of 45 indicates poor sleep quality
(Buysse et al, 1989). Furthermore, sleep quality can be objectively
assessed through actigraphy: sleep disturbance is indicated by a total
sleep time (TST) of p6.5h (Lacks and Morin, 1992), sleep efficiency
(SE) of p85% (Coates et al, 1982), sleep onset latency (SOL) of
430min (Espie et al, 2001), or wake after sleep onset (WASO) of
430min (Savard and Morin, 2001). Factors including age (Kim et al,
2000; Chen et al, 2015b), sex, marital status (Baiden et al, 2015),
cancer stage, and anticancer treatments (Roscoe et al, 2007; Chen
et al, 2015b), which can affect sleep quality, must be included in sleep
quality assessments for cancer patients. Unstable rest-activity rhythms
lead to sleep disturbance (Miaskowski and Lee, 1999; Berger et al,
2007), and non-small-cell lung cancer patients with disrupted rest-
activity rhythms may experience poor sleep quality and insomnia
(Levin et al, 2005).

 A cross-sectional study, using actigraphy to measure objective
sleep quality and assess rest-activity rhythms in patients with lung
cancer, reported more favorable TST, SE, SOL, 24-h autocorrela-
tion coefficient (r24), and in-bed less than out-of-bed dichotomy
index (IoO) data in patients performing light physical activities
for at least 295 min/day than in those performing these activities
for o295 min/day (Chen et al, 2015b). In addition, IoO is a
predictor of TST and SOL (Chen et al, 2015b). These results
indicate a strong correlation among physical activity, sleep quality,
and rest-activity rhythms. Thus, exercise may stabilise rest-activity
rhythms and improve sleep quality (Coleman et al, 2012).
Few studies—most with small sample sizes—have reported the
positive effects of exercise on rest-activity rhythms. Furthermore,
providing healthy adults with an exercise regimen can improve
their sleep-wake cycle (Yamanaka et al, 2010). Some exercise
intervention studies have reported that exercise can improve the
sleep quality of patients with lung or colorectal cancer (Cheville
et al, 2012), breast cancer, and other cancer types (Young-
McCaughan et al, 2003; Rabin et al, 2009). However, other studies
have found that exercise improves the subjective but not objective
sleep quality of patients with cancer (Young-McCaughan et al,
2003). Thus, the effects of exercise on sleep disturbances in patients
with cancer remain unclear, possibly because of the inconsistency
among previous studies regarding the type, intensity, frequency,
and duration of exercise regimens and the diversity of assessment
methods used.
This study investigated (1) the effect of a 12-week walking
exercise program in improving subjective and objective sleep
quality and stabilising rest-activity rhythms and (2) the moderating
effect of rest-activity rhythms on subjective and objective sleep
quality among patients with lung cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and participants. The present research is a
substudy of a larger research project; some of the findings have
been published previously (Chen et al, 2015a). This was a
randomised controlled trial, comprising a walking exercise group
that received a 12-week regimen of home-based
walking
exercises and another group that received usual-care. Data were
collected using a questionnaire, and the measurements of rest-
activity rhythms and sleep quality were collected at three time
points [pretrial (T1), after 3 months (T2), and after 6 months
(T3)]. This study was approved by the Taipei Veterans General
Hospital’s Institutional Review Board, and consent was obtained
from all participants.
Participants were recruited from a medical center in Northern
Taiwan. Patients with lung cancer who were aged X18 years,
could communicate in either Mandarin or Taiwanese, and were
not cognitively impaired were included. By contrast, those
performing regular exercise, having congestive heart failure,
or having orthopedic disorders of the lower limbs were excluded.
Procedure. Patients who visited the pulmonary medicine or
thoracic surgery outpatient department and agreed to participate
in this study were referred to the researchers. After the patients
signed the consent form, we instructed them on how to complete
the T1 questionnaire, comprising a survey of demographic
data, the PSQI questionnaire, a sleep diary, and a 3-day physical
activity record. Participants were provided actigraphs to be worn
on their nondominant arm and then asked to take home the
physical activity record questionnaire and record their physical
activities. Finally, participants were provided a shockproof
envelope for returning the actigraph and physical activity record,
through registered mail. After completing the initial steps, by
using computer-randomised group assignment, we determined
assigned
participants
to
walking
exercise
or
the
usual-
care. Follow-up data 3 (T2) and 6 (T3) months after intervention
were collected using the questionnaires and actigraphs (please
see the ‘Supplementary Material A: Study calendar’ for the
details).
Interventions. A
12-week
regimen
of
home-based
walking
exercises, comprising walking at a moderate intensity for 40 min,
three times a week, was administered along with weekly exercise
counseling. After collecting pretrial measurements, we explained
the participants how to perform the exercises, according to an
instruction
manual
for
the
exercise
regimen.
The
detailed
instructions,
provided
at
the
hospital
clinics,
included
the
determination
of
activity
intensity,
demonstration
of
pulse
measurement, criteria for scores of 6–20 on the Borg’s rating of
perceived exertion (RPE; Borg, 1998), prevention of exercise-
related injuries, and conditions necessitating termination of an
exercise session. Participants were instructed that the exercises
would be effective only if they reached 60–80% of the target heart
rate, as determined by the Karvonen method (Karvonen et al,
1957), and 13–15 on the RPE.
For each participant, we discussed exercise regimen-related
issues weekly through the telephone. For instance, we discussed
whether participants’ exercise fulfilled the prescribed intensity,
duration, or frequency and whether the participants experienced
any adverse effects. If a patient had not exercised for X3 days and
we determined that this lack of exercise was not due to adverse
effects of exercising, we reiterated the exercise instructions and
encouraged the patient to continue the regimen. The participants
were reminded to record their activity after every session and were
instructed that after completing the regimen in 3 months, we
would collect the record of physical activities for calculating the
regimen completion rates (Please see the ‘Supplementary Material
B: Instructions for the home-based walking exercise program’ for
details).
The usual-care group. The usual care group was provided services
similar to those provided to the walking exercise group depending
on their treatment (e.g., postoperative care, chemotherapy care,
and outpatient department follow-up), except for the 12-week
regimen of home-based walking exercise training and weekly
telephone exercise counseling. The patients were asked to maintain
normal daily activity and not perform additional exercise during
the study period. For ethical considerations, we mailed the exercise
booklet to the participants and offered exercise counseling at the
end of the study.
Measures
Subjective sleep quality. We used PSQI (Buysse et al, 1989),
comprising 19 items, with each score ranging from 0 to 3 and a
total score range of 0–21. A score of 0 indicated no sleep
problems and 3 indicated serious sleep problems. Because of its
widespread use, PSQI has been translated into a Taiwanese
version (PSQI-T). The reliability of PSQI-T—measured using
Cronbach’s a—is 0.79, and the test-retest reliability—measured
using 16 patients who took a retest 20–28 days later—is 0.91
(Tzeng et al, 2012).
Objective sleep quality. An actigraph (Ambulatory Monitoring,
Ardsley, NY, USA) was worn on patients’ nondominant arms to
collect data continuously for 72 h. Sleep parameters included TST,
SE, SOL, and WASO. The Micro-Mini Actigraph and the Action
W2 analysis software have high validity, with an internal
consistency of 91% for minute-by-minute synchronised measure-
ments using polysomnography (de Souza et al, 2003). Using the
zero cross mode to sample patient data at 1-min epoch intervals is
sufficient for analyzing a patient’s sleep and activities for 3

 consecutive days (Littner et al, 2003). The Act Millennium software
(Ambulatory Monitoring) was first used to download the data
from the actigraph. Subsequently, the Action W2 software was
used to process and calculate parameters, including TST, SE,
SOL, and WASO (Coates et al, 1982; Lacks and Morin, 1992;
Espie et al, 2001; Savard and Morin, 2001), by using the Cole-
Kripke algorithm (de Souza et al, 2003). Patients’ sleep diaries
were used to corroborate bedtime and wake times (Berger et al,
2008). Clinical sleep specialists (Buysse et al, 2006) have
suggested that objective sleep indicators are more appropriate
for assessing sleep disturbance. A sleep diary was recorded
concurrently with the actigraph readings to confirm the exact
bedtimes and wake times (Berger et al, 2008). The patients were
asked to record the duration for which they took off the
actigraph in the sleep diary to help the researcher define missing
data and discard them. If the patients forgot to record it, the
actigraphy
analyst
sought
confirmation
from
the
patients
through the telephone. Data cleaning was performed before
analyzing the actigraph data. Data processing and actigraph
reading analysis were conducted by a researcher experienced in
managing actigraph data (Littner et al, 2003).
Rest-activity rhythms. An actigraph was worn by the patients to
collect data continuously for 72 h (Littner et al, 2003). Rest-activity
rhythm parameters, namely r24 and IoO, were measured. All
settings and analysis procedures were identical to those described
in the Objective sleep quality subsection, except the data were
exported to the Action 4 software (Ambulatory Monitoring) for
analyzing rest-activity rhythms. r24 is a ratio that quantifies the
regularity and consistency of activity between one day and the next
day (Berger et al, 2012). The value of this indicator ranges from
� 1 to 1, with a higher value representing more stable and regular
rest-activity rhythms (Dowse and Ringo, 1989; Mormont et al,
2000). IoO is the percentage of activity counts per minute when
the patient is in bed, and it is lower than the median activity count
when the patient is out of bed during the day (Minors et al, 1996).
An analysis of IoO requires the patient’s sleep diary to validate the
patient’s bedtimes and wake times (Mormont et al, 2000), and the
value of this indicator ranges from 0% to 100%. A patient with high
sleep quality at night and a high level of physical activity during the
day will exhibit a prominent, strong circadian rhythm, and IoO
will be close to 100% (Mormont et al, 2000; Pati et al, 2007). Before
commencing the study, the aforementioned researcher defined
data as missing when a participant did not wear the actigraph for
more than 1 h (Berger et al, 2008) and then discarded the missing
data while analyzing r24.
Physical activity. Physical activity was assessed to determine
contamination by the control group. Physical activity was assessed
through actigraphy and by using the Bouchard 3-day physical
activity record. The up activity mean was recorded through
actigraphy during waking hours for 72 h continuously, along with
rest-activity
rhythms.
The
original
physical
activity
record
comprises activities recorded by the patient on two weekdays
and one weekend day and is used to calculate energy expenditure
(Bouchard et al, 1983). The 3-day physical activity record has been
translated and adapted for Taiwanese culture (Lu et al, 2001). The
reliability and validity of the adapted version was tested in Taiwan
by using the TriTrac-R3D accelerometer. The results showed a
satisfactory test-retest reliability and criterion-related validity of
0.95 and 0.81, respectively. Although the 3-day physical activity
record is typically used to calculate daily energy expenditure
(Bouchard et al, 1983), we used it to determine the physical activity
minutes in the present study. After the patients completed
recording the activities undertaken for 2 weekdays and 1 weekend
day, we used the record to calculate the 3-day sum and mean
minutes of light, moderate, and vigorous activities for each
participant.
Statistical analyses and sample size calculations. According to
the results of eight participants in the pilot study, the mean
[standard deviation (SD)] PSQI scores of the walking exercise and
usual-care groups were 7.25 (4.99) and 8.50 (4.51), respectively,
after the 12-week home-based walking exercise program. The
sample size was estimated to be 40 patients per group by using the
G*Power software (Version 3.1.0; Faul et al, 2009) for repeated
measures, with a significance level of 0.05, effect size of 0.26, power
of 0.8, and correlation of 0.8. On the basis of an assumed dropout
rate of 30%, the enrollment of 104 patients was considered
adequate.
We used an intention-to-treat approach for analysis. The t test
or chi-square test was used to determine the differences in the

 baseline values between the two groups. We used a general linear
model for evaluating the mean values, SDs, and differences
between group outcomes at the baseline and 3 and 6 months after
intervention. Generalised estimating equations (GEEs) were used
for testing group differences with respect over time. A GEE model
was used to test the moderating effect of the rest-activity rhythm
indicators (r24 and IoO) on the subjective (PSQI) and objective
(TST, SE, SOL, and WASO) indicators of sleep quality. All tests
involved a two-sided significance level of a ¼ 0.05. All statistical
analyses were conducted using the IBM Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences (version 20) for Windows (IBM, Somers,
NY, USA).
RESULTS
Study population and baseline data. We recruited 111 patients
with lung cancer, aged 37–88 years, between March 2010 and
March 2015. The demographic data and disease characteristics of
the walking exercise and routine care groups did not differ
significantly (P40.2 for all tests; Table 1). Nevertheless, pretrial
r24 and moderate-intensity physical activity minutes differed
significantly between the two groups.
Protocol adherence. Among the 111 patients, 56 and 55 were
randomly assigned to the walking exercise and rusual-care
groups, respectively. Pretrial data and PSQI were collected for all
participants; however, the actigraph data were missing for six
participants because the participants forgot to wear the actigraph
or the actigraph malfunctioned. After 6 months, 89 participants
remained
(80.2%;
Figure
1).
Among
all
participants,
87
submitted measurements at all three collection time points
(78.4%) and 24 submitted measurements at only one or two
collection time points (21.6%). No significant difference was
found between the walking exercise and usual-care groups in
terms of completing the measurements. Thirteen participants in
the walking exercise group (23.2%) and nine in the usual-care
group (16.4%) dropped out of the study; this difference was not
significant. The demographic factors, disease characteristics, and
pretrial outcomes (PSQI, TST, SE, SOL, WASO, r24, and I4O)
of participants who submitted measurements at all three
collection time points and participants who did not complete
or withdrew from the study did not differ significantly; further
analysis using Little’s test of missing completely at random also
showed
that
the
results
were
nonsignificant
(w2 ¼ 380.17,
P ¼ 0.307).
The participants in the walking exercise group completed an
average of 21 walking exercise sessions (SD ¼ 43.99). The median
number of completed sessions was 24; 24 participants (42.9%)
completed all 36 scheduled exercise sessions within 3 months,
whereas 31 (55.4%) completed at least two or three of the exercise
sessions. All participants completed an average of 58.2% sessions.
Reasons for not completing all 36 sessions included dropping out
from the study (n ¼ 13), feeling unwell (n ¼ 9), losing interest
(n ¼ 6), or being busy (n ¼ 4).
In the walking exercise group, the mean amount of moderate-
intensity physical activity was 8 min/day at the baseline and 28
and
10 min/day
at
3
and
6
months
after
intervention,
respectively. In the usual-care group, the mean amount of
moderate physical activity was 29 min/day at the baseline and 37
and

3
and

after
intervention,

 difference � time was not statistically significant in the GEE
model
(Wald
w2 ¼ 1.977,
P ¼ 0.372).
In
addition,
through
disclosures and the physical activity record data for the 3- and
6-month measures, we noted that in the usual-care group, three
participants performed biking activities, two hiked, and one
walked slowly, all for at least 1 h/day.
Effects of walking exercises on subjective and objective sleep
quality and rest-activity rhythms. Because of the significant
differences in the pretrial r24 and moderate-intensity physical
activity minutes between the walking exercise and usual-care
groups, these two variables were controlled using GEEs to analyze
the effect of walking exercises on subjective and objective sleep
quality and rest-activity rhythms. The walking exercise group had
significantly improved subjective sleep quality (lower PSQI scores)
compared with the usual-care group over time (Wald w2 ¼ 15.16,
P ¼ 0.001; Table 2 and Figure 2). Nevertheless, although both
groups scored 45 on the PSQI, indicating disturbed sleep, the
walking exercise group had improved scores by 3 points, whereas
the usual-care group showed no change in their sleep quality. In
addition, the walking exercise group had significantly improved
objective sleep quality (increased TST) compared with the usual-
care group over time (Wald w2 ¼ 7.59, P ¼ 0.023; Table 2 and
Figure 2), indicating that walking can effectively increase TST as
well. These results demonstrated a significantly positive effect of
walking exercises on the subjective and objective sleep quality of
the patients with lung cancer.
No significant differences over time were observed for other
indicators of objective sleep quality (SE, SOL, and WASO) and rest-
activity rhythms (r24 and I4O). However, SOL at 6 months after
intervention was significantly lower in the walking exercise group
than in the usual-care group (23 min vs 38 min, P¼ 0.045; Table 2).
We further analyzed the intervention effects of walking exercises
on the PSQI, TST, SE, SOL, WASO, r24, and IoO, according to
the clinical cutoff values (Coates et al, 1982; Buysse et al, 1989;
Lacks and Morin, 1992; Espie et al, 2001; Savard and Morin, 2001).
We observed no significant differences in the indicators of
subjective sleep quality (PSQI), objective sleep quality (TST, SE,
SOL, and WASO) and rest-activity rhythms (r24 and I4O) over
time (Supplementary Table 2).
Moderating effects of rest-activity rhythms on subjective and
objective sleep quality. The GEE model was used to examine the
moderating effects of rest-activity rhythms on subjective and
objective sleep quality. In the TST model, IoO and group had a
significant interaction effect (b ¼ 3.70, P ¼ 0.032; Supplementary
Table 1), thus indicating that walking exercises may amplify or
diminish the objective sleep indicator TST depending on IoO of
different rest-activity rhythms. Furthermore, in the PSQI model,
IoO and group had a nearly significant interaction effect
(b ¼ � 0.13, P ¼ 0.050; Supplementary Table 1). To comprehen-
sively understand the beneficial effects of walking exercises on
patients on the basis of their rest-activity rhythms, we classified r24
and IoO as low, average, or high depending on their percentiles
(Mormont et al, 2000). Walking exercises significantly improved
subjective sleep quality (reduced PSQI scores) and objective sleep
quality (increased TST) over time in the walking exercise group
with poor rest-activity rhythm of r24 (p0.30), and this effect was
more evident in the walking exercise group than in the usual-care
group. In the GEE model, after adjustment for the significant
differences in IoO between the walking exercise and usual-care
groups, the interaction term group difference � time was statisti-
cally significant (PSQI: Wald w2 ¼ 9.33, P ¼ 0.009; TST: Wald
w2 ¼ 9.44, P ¼ 0.009; Table 3 and Figure 3); group difference � time

 was not significant (Table 3) compared with that of participants
with favorable r24 (X0.46).
Walking exercises significantly improved subjective sleep quality
(reduced PSQI scores) over time in the walking exercise group
participants with poor rest-activity rhythm of IoO (p96.93), and
this effect was more prominent in the walking exercise group than
in the usual-care group. In the GEE model, after adjustment for the
significant differences in PSQI scores between the walking exercise
and usual-care groups, the interaction term group difference � time
became significant (Wald w2 ¼ 30.84, Po0.0001). In addition,
walking
exercises
slightly
improved
objective
sleep
quality
(increased TST) over time for the walking exercise group
participants with poor rest-activity rhythm of IoO (p96.93),
and this effect was more prominent in the walking exercise group
than in the usual-care group. In the GEE model, after adjustment
for the significant differences in PSQI scores between the walking
exercise and usual-care groups, the interaction term group
difference � time
was
nearly
significant
(Wald
w2 ¼ 5.44,
Po0.066) but remained nonsignificant (Table 3) compared with
that of participants with favorable I4O (X97.35). For further
examination, we considered 0.42 and 97% to be cutoff values for
r24 and IoO, respectively (Mormont et al, 2000). Walking
exercises still significantly improved subjective sleep quality
(reduced PSQI scores) and objective sleep quality (increased
TST) over time in the walking exercise group with poor r24
(p0.42) and poor IoO (p97; Supplementary Table 3). Thus,
walking exercises more effectively improved the subjective and
objective sleep quality—as assessed using PSQI scores and TST—of
lung cancer patients with poor rest-activity rhythms than of those
with favorable rest-activity rhythms.
Adverse events. During the study period, one participant in the
walking exercise group was hospitalised for shortness of breath and
hematuria; nevertheless, the walking exercises were eliminated as
the cause. In addition, one participant in the usual-care group was
hospitalised for an altered state of consciousness caused by brain
metastasis.
DISCUSSION
This study is the first to verify that home-based walking exercises
can improve the subjective and objective sleep quality and rest-
activity rhythms of patients with lung cancer. This finding is
similar to that of previous studies on patients with colorectal,
breast, and other types of cancer (Young-McCaughan et al, 2003;
Rabin et al, 2009), indicating that the effect of exercise on
improving sleep quality among patients with lung cancer is similar
to that among patients with other cancers. However, we observed
that the exercises did not stabilise rest-activity rhythms. This result
is similar to that of a small-scale study on healthy adults, which
reported that a 4-day short-term regimen of moderate-intensity
stationary bicycle exercises induced phase-advance shifts but did
not affect the circadian rhythm of plasma melatonin levels
(Yamanaka et al, 2010). Additional studies are required to
determine whether exercise interventions conducted for a longer
duration (e.g., X3 months) or at a specific time of day alter or
adjust rest-activity rhythms. In the present study, the overall effects
of the exercise intervention on rest-activity rhythms in 111
participants were nonsignificant. However, independent analyses
of groups of participants with poor rest-activity rhythms, that is,
those with poor r24 or IoO, showed that exercise significantly
improved both PSQI scores and TST, thus confirming that exercise
can improve and maintain improvements in subjective and
objective sleep quality of lung cancer patients with poor rest-
activity rhythms.
The results of the present study support another initial
assumption that circadian rhythms have a moderating effect on
the subjective and objective sleep quality of patients with lung
cancer.
The
results
showed
that
walking
exercises
more
effectively improved the subjective and objective sleep quality
of lung cancer patients with poor rest-activity rhythms, as
assessed using the PSQI and TST. For example, in the walking
exercise group, PSQI scores significantly decreased by 4.27
points (from 12.27 points at the baseline to 8.0 points at 6
months) in the poor IoO subgroup (IoO valuep93.96) and by
only 2.87 points (from 7.82 points at the baseline to 4.95 points
at
6
months)
in
the
favorable
IoO
subgroup
(IoO
valueX97.35; Table 3). Furthermore, in the walking exercise
group, the TST value significantly increased by 40.84 min (from

 327.45 min at the baseline to 368.29 min at 6 months) in the poor
IoO subgroup (IoO valuep93.96) and decreased by 8.67 min
(from 434.14 min at the baseline to 425.47 min at 6 months) in
the favorable IoO subgroup (IoO valueX97.35; Table 3). This
suggests that rest-activity rhythms may be involved in poor sleep
quality. Studies have reported that the amplitude of rest-activity
rhythms and indicators of subjective and objective sleep quality
(e.g., TST and SE) are negatively correlated; in other words,
people with unstable or unapparent rest-activity rhythms exhibit
poor sleep quality (Berger et al, 2007). We recommend that
future intervention studies include rest-activity rhythms as
moderating variables. In addition, examining the rest-activity
rhythm indicators r24 and IoO may provide a clearer under-
standing of a patient’s overall sleep quality.
Although we performed randomisation in our study, the mean
amount of moderate-intensity physical activity in the usual-care
group
still
higher
than
the
walking
exercise
group.
We
discovered, through their disclosure or 3-d PAR, that 3
participants in the usual-care group biked for at least one hour
per day, 2 participants hiked at least one hour per day, and one
participant walked slowly for at least one hour per day. The
research ethics prohibited us from limiting the activities of the
participants in the usual-care group. In particular, patients with
lung cancer who have experienced the struggle between life and
death have a strong desire for maintaining a healthy lifestyle and
aspire to become ardent pursuers of better health. Studies have
reported that patients often adjust their lifestyles after receiving a
diagnosis of cancer and during cancer treatment. They are
particularly likely to increase physical activity to alleviate their
illness or improve their overall health (Mustian et al, 2006). This
difference between the two groups on the mean amount of
moderate-intensity physical activity can be attributed to the
small sample size.
The present study has some limitations. First, we could not
perform a blind study. The patients were informed regarding the
exercise regimen; thus, patients may have experienced the placebo
effect, leading to observation bias. To reduce the risk of observation
bias, a standardised procedure, conducted by the same personnel
with the same equipment and interview guide for data collection,
should be devised. In addition, telephone counseling for the usual-
care group similar to that received by the walking exercise group
(such as weekly nutrition counseling) should have been performed,
because they would have reduced the risk of the placebo effect in
the walking exercise group caused by a difference in the number of
counseling telephone calls received. Second, because of the time
limit, we only concluded that 12 weeks of exercise causes a
nonsignificant effect on rest-activity rhythms. We suggest that
future studies should employ a longer period for exercise training.
Third, three participants in the usual-care group performed
exercise activities, which may have led to an underestimation of
the effect of the exercise intervention. Fourth, contamination in the
usual-care group may exist in this study.

 In summary, the present study was the first to verify that a
regimen
of
home-based
walking
exercises
is
an
effective
intervention for patients with lung cancer. The study results
demonstrated that home-based walking exercises can effectively
improve the subjective and objective sleep quality of patients
with lung cancer, particularly those with poor rest-activity
rhythms. Healthcare providers should recognise the benefits of
exercise and incorporate it as a key component of lung cancer
care and rehabilitation.
