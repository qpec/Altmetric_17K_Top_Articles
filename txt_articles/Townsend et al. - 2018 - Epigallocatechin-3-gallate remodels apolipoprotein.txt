Amyloid deposits of WT apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the
main protein component of high-density lipoprotein, accumu-
late in atherosclerotic plaques where they may contribute to
coronary artery disease by increasing plaque burden and insta-
bility. Using CD analysis, solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and
transmission EM, we report here a surprising cooperative effect
of heparin and the green tea polyphenol (�)-epigallocatechin-
3-gallate (EGCG), a known inhibitor and modulator of amyloid
formation, on apoA-I fibrils. We found that heparin, a proxy
for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) polysaccharides that co-localize
ubiquitously with amyloid in vivo, accelerates the rate of apoA-I
formation from monomeric protein and associates with insolu-
ble fibrils. Mature, insoluble apoA-I fibrils bound EGCG (KD �
30 � 3 �M; Bmax � 40 � 3 �M), but EGCG did not alter the
kinetics of apoA-I amyloid assembly from monomer in the pres-
ence or absence of heparin. EGCG selectively increased the
mobility of specific backbone and side-chain sites of apoA-I
fibrils formed in the absence of heparin, but the fibrils largely
retained their original morphology and remained insoluble. By
contrast, fibrils formed in the presence of heparin were mobi-
lized extensively by the addition of equimolar EGCG, and the
fibrils were remodeled into soluble 20-nm-diameter oligomers
with a largely �-helical structure that were nontoxic to human
umbilical artery endothelial cells. These results argue for a pro-
tective effect of EGCG on apoA-I amyloid associated with ath-
erosclerosis and suggest that EGCG-induced remodeling of
amyloid may be tightly regulated by GAGs and other amyloid
co-factors in vivo, depending on EGCG bioavailability.
Amyloidosis is a group of disorders characterized patholog-
ically by the extracellular accumulation of insoluble protein
fibrils with a cross-� structural motif. Systemic amyloidosis
affects several organs and tissues, whereas localized amyloid is
confined to a single organ. In each case the clinical manifesta-
tions depend on the precursor protein (1). Localized amyloid
deposits of the A�5 peptide in Alzheimer’s brains have been
characterized extensively, although the relationship between
misfolded A� and disease remains unresolved. The pathologi-
cal consequences of systemic amyloidosis are less ambiguous
and often involve irreparable damage to major organs at the
end-stage of disease. Systemic amyloid derived from apolipo-
protein A-I (apoA-I), the major protein component of the high-
density lipoprotein (HDL) complex that transports cholesterol
to the liver, was identified in the 1990s as a hereditary condition
related to several mutant forms of the protein that are suscep-
tible to protease digestion, misfolding, and aggregation (2, 3).
More recent evidence has shown that fibrils of WT apoA-I also
accumulate spontaneously in the plaques of atherosclerosis and
may contribute to the condition (4–7). Lipid-deprived apoA-I
can undergo an alternative folding pathway in which the pro-
tein self-assembles into amyloid (8, 9), resulting in loss of its
atheroprotective properties and the accumulation of poten-
tially damaging amyloid plaques in vital organs and vasculature.
The high incidence of fibrillar apoA-I associated with athero-
sclerotic lesions suggests that amyloid deposition may decrease
plaque stability and contribute to the progression of atheroscle-
rosis (6, 7, 10, 11).
Native, functional apoA-I has a predominantly �-helical
structure, but the fibrillar aggregates exhibit a combination of
�-helical and �-sheet conformations as revealed by CD and
solid-state NMR spectroscopy (12). ApoA-I aggregation in vitro
is accelerated under acidic conditions (11) and by myeloperoxi-
dase-catalyzed oxidation (13) associated with inflammatory

 diseases such as atherosclerosis. Whether the enhanced aggre-
gation kinetics at low pH is pathologically significant is not
clear, although a small but significant pH reduction (to 7.15)
has been observed ex vivo in calcified areas of lesions (14). In
addition, heparin, a member of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG)
polysaccharides that co-localize ubiquitously with amyloid in
vivo (15, 16), accelerates the formation of ordered apoA-I fibrils
in a concentration-dependent manner (11, 12). Generally, hep-
arin is known to increase the rate of amyloid fibril formation
(17, 18), stabilize fibrils (19, 20), and reduce amyloid toxicity
(21, 22). The GAG chains of proteoglycans in the arterial intima
associate with apoA-I in the advanced stages of atherosclerosis
(23), and the accumulation of high local apoA-I concentrations
may contribute to the formation and retention of amyloid
deposits. The native structure of apoA-I is stable for at least 24 h
above pH 7 (12), but at pH 4–5 in the presence of heparin
aggregation is virtually instantaneous.
Polyphenols from green tea, including (�)-epigallocatechin-
3-gallate (EGCG), are flavonoids that are considered to have
beneficial protective effects on cardiovascular health and
against atherosclerosis, resulting from their anti-oxidant and
anti-inflammatory properties (24, 25). EGCG has also been
shown to modulate the aggregation kinetics of several amy-
loidogenic proteins, including A�, �-synuclein, and amylin,
and directs the assembly pathway toward the formation of
large, off-pathway, and nontoxic oligomers (26–28). EGCG
remodels insoluble amyloid fibrils into amorphous aggregates
with reduced toxicity to mammalian cells (29). Oxidized and
unoxidized EGCG molecules bind to amyloid fibrils through
engagement of hydrophobic sites (30) and polar contacts (31,
32), but autooxidation of EGCG appears to invoke covalent
cross-linking with the fibrils that stabilize the remodeled aggre-
gates (33). These properties of EGCG offer potential therapeu-
tic benefits, and clinical trials of EGCG for the treatment of
early-stage Alzheimer’s and antibody light chain amyloidosis
have been completed or are currently active. Low bioavailability
and intestinal and hepatic metabolism are considered potential
difficulties of medical utilization of the unmodified natural
product (34, 35). Recently, it was shown that EGCG disaggre-
gated fibrils of the G26R (Iowa) mutant of apoA-I and also
inhibited fibril growth, as assessed by the amyloid-reactive dye
thioflavin T (ThT) (36). The effects were also replicated on the
N-terminal 1–83-amino acid peptide fragment of both the
Iowa mutant and WT protein. A detailed molecular analysis of
EGCG with WT apoA-I associated with atherosclerosis, how-
ever, has not been reported.
Here, we show that EGCG interacts with fibrils of WT, full-
length apoA-I preferentially over other green tea components
without modulating apoA-I fibril growth kinetics. Circular
dichroism (CD), solid-state NMR spectroscopy (ssNMR),
and transmission EM (TEM) reveal that EGCG remodels
apoA-I fibrils into soluble nontoxic oligomers when fibrils
are formed in the presence of heparin but not when fibrils are
formed in the absence of heparin. This surprising synergistic
effect of EGCG and heparin may offer a means of influencing
the deposition of apoA-I amyloid associated with atheroscle-
rosis and possibly other amyloids known to associate with
GAGs in vivo.
Results
Heparin associates with apoA-I fibrils
WT apoA-I is known to undergo ThT-responsive aggrega-
tion in solution at pH 4 that is accelerated by the addition of
heparin (11, 12). TEM indicates that incubation of apoA-I alone
at pH 4 for 3 days results in the deposition of fibrils (Fig. 1A, left
panel) and distinct deposits of more amorphous material (Fig.
1A, right panel), whereas incubation of apoA-I with a 2-fold
molar excess of heparin (assuming a mean mass of 14.5 kDa)
results in only fibrils. The fibrils in the absence of heparin are
7–15 nm in diameter, and fibrils in the presence of heparin are
distributed from 10 to 21 nm in diameter, although the mean
widths are not significantly different (Fig. 1C). Heparin may
therefore either influence the aggregation process and/or may
co-localize with the fibrils, as found for other amyloid-forming
proteins (37–41). None of the TEM images showed any evi-
dence of nanoscale structures other than fibrils or amorphous
aggregates, even after shorter incubation times.
Evidence for heparin binding to the fibrils was obtained using
a heparinase I assay (42), in which the concentration of heparin
remaining in solution was determined after incubation with
monomeric apoA-I and removal of the fibrils formed after
3 days by sedimentation. From an initial concentration of 1
mg/ml, heparin is progressively removed from solution by
increasing amounts of protein (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, apoA-I
fibrils formed in the presence of heparin doped with a heparin–
fluorescein conjugate showed strong fluorescence enhance-
ment over the background protein fluorescence (Fig. 1E), con-
sistent with co-localization of the fluorophore and fibrils. The
results thus show that heparin binds to apoA-I during or after
its aggregation into amyloid and precipitates concomitantly
with the insoluble fibrils.
Selective binding of green tea polyphenols to apoA-I fibrils
To investigate whether apoA-I fibrils bind EGCG and other
polyphenols from green tea, an aqueous green tea solution was
prepared by microwave extraction of the dried leaves. A HPLC
method was developed to quantify green tea polyphenol and
caffeine binding to pre-formed fibrils. Insoluble fibrils prepared
in the absence of heparin at pH 4 (1 mg/ml monomeric apoA-I)
were suspended in an aqueous solution of green tea (1 ml) and
incubated for 12 h with gentle agitation before centrifugation
and retention of the supernatant for analysis. Control samples
of the tea extract solution alone were treated in the same way.
Reverse-phase HPLC of the control solution resolves several
major components that were identified by MS (12) and quanti-
fied with reference to a standard mixture of eight green tea
catechins of known concentration (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Com-
parison of the peaks for the fibril-treated and control solutions
reveals that specific components are removed from solution by
binding to the fibrils. The major component, EGCG (peak 5),
reduces to �50% of its initial concentration after sedimentation
of the apoA-I fibrils (Fig. 2B), and epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG)
(peak 7) also shows appreciable binding. The 3-gallate moiety
therefore appears to enhance the affinity of the polyphenols to
associate with apoA-I fibrils. EGCG and ECG are also removed
from the green tea extract when incubated with fibrils of the

 40-amino acid �-amyloid peptide (A�40) (Fig. 2C), confirming
the affinity of these polyphenols for amyloid fibrils derived from
different proteins. Titration of apoA-I fibrils (36 �M monomer
equivalent concentration) with a solution of pure EGCG yields
an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) and saturation binding
concentration (Bmax) of 40 � 4 and 45 � 5 �M, respectively (Fig.
2D). Similar values (Kd � 30 � 3 �M; Bmax � 35 � 3 �M) were
obtained when EGCG was added to the monomeric protein and
incubated for 48 h before removing the insoluble protein by
centrifugation. In both cases the saturation binding concentra-
tion of EGCG is approximately equimolar.
EGCG does not alter the aggregation kinetics of apoA-I
We next used ThT fluorescence to determine whether
EGCG influences the kinetics of aggregation of apoA-I under
conditions previously reported to favor apoA-I assembly into
amyloid (11, 12). At pH 4, incubation of apoA-I alone results in
a slow enhancement of ThT fluorescence (Fig. 2E). The addi-
tion of heparin, however, results in a rapid enhancement of ThT
fluorescence, followed by a further, more gradual increase (Fig.
2E) (in the absence of protein heparin does not affect ThT fluo-
rescence (data not shown)). Previous work has shown that the
rapid fluorescence enhancement induced by heparin reflects an
increase in insoluble, partially fibrillar protein (12). A repeat of
the measurements in the presence of EGCG (2-fold molar
excess over the protein) or green tea extract (containing an
estimated 2-fold molar excess of EGCG with respect to the
protein concentration) showed that EGCG and the leaf extract
do not affect the aggregation kinetics of apoA-I, regardless of
whether heparin is present. This observation contrasts with the
reported inhibitory effect of EGCG on a peptide fragment of the
apoAIowa variant (36) and on the �-amyloid peptide (29, 43).
Equimolar EGCG is sufficient to cause a marked reduction in
ThT fluorescence in the presence of MA�40 (the 40-residue
�-amyloid peptide with an additional N-terminal methionine)
without affecting the lag time or elongation rate (Fig. 2F), con-
sistent with the known ability of EGCG and ThT to compete for
the same binding site (33).

 Enhancement of backbone and side-chain dynamics within
fibrillar apoA-I
A more detailed analysis was next carried out to determine
whether EGCG modulates the structure of the apoA-I fibrils as
it does for other fibrillar proteins (28, 29, 33, 44). Solid-state
NMR (ssNMR) has recently revealed interesting structural fea-
tures of apoA-I fibrils in which the duplication of some cross-
peaks in 2D 13C–13C spectra suggest that the fibrils comprise a
mixture of �-helical elements and new amyloid-like �-sheet
elements within the fibril architecture (12). 2D 13C–13C magic

 heparin or at pH 6 after protein oxidation by hydrogen perox-
ide, exhibit similar features, including the same duplication of
peaks for specific amino acids, including alanine, threonine,
leucine, and valine. The duplicated peaks occur in approxi-
mately the same intensity ratios for each sample, as shown by
the slices through the C�–C� cross-peaks for alanine (Fig. 3B),
suggesting that the �-helical and �-sheet elements, which give
rise to the differences in chemical shift observed (12), occur
within a single, common fibril architecture (see “Discussion”).
After adding EGCG to apoA-I fibrils formed at pH 4 in the
absence of heparin, several cross-peaks disappear from the
13C–13C spectrum, specifically the cross-peaks assigned to
valine, threonine, and alanine in �-helical environments and
the proline C�–C� cross-peak (Fig. 4A, left panel, red spec-
trum). The remaining cross-peaks occur at the same positions
as in the spectrum of untreated apoA-I fibrils (Fig. 4A, left
panel, black spectrum). The changes in the spectrum can be
interpreted as a selective structural remodeling of the fibrils,
caused by exposure to EGCG. The same cross-peaks disappear
from the spectrum of apoA-I fibrils assembled in the presence
of EGCG (Fig. 4A, right panel), indicating that similar fibril
remodeling occurs regardless of whether EGCG is present at
the onset or added at the end point of aggregation.
An explanation for these observations is that EGCG
increases protein mobility over selective regions within the
fibrils; this is because cross-peaks in the 13C–13C spectrum
arise from dipolar coupling between 13C nuclei and if the cou-
plings are reduced by increased motional fluctuations then the
cross-peaks can weaken in intensity or disappear. Increased
mobility was tested using 1H–13C INEPT ssNMR, which
detects signals only from dynamic regions of fibrillar proteins
(45). A 1D INEPT spectrum of EGCG-treated fibrils reveals
several sharp peaks attributable to the mobile regions of the
protein (Fig. 4B, red), but the 1D INEPT spectrum of fibrils in
the absence of EGCG fails to detect any signals after 24 h of
measurement (Fig. 4B, black). These results indicate protein
mobility within the untreated fibrils is enhanced after exposure
to EGCG. A 2D extension of the 1H–13C INEPT experiment on
the EGCG-treated fibrils enables some of the peaks to be
assigned to specific amino acids (Fig. 4C). Most of the reso-
nances occur in the amino acid side-chain region of the spec-
trum (principally from methyl-bearing or polar/charged side
chains), and there is much less signal intensity in the C�/H�
region, which implies that most of the protein backbone
remains relatively constrained. The resolved 13C� chemical
shifts of the mobile leucine, threonine, asparagine, alanine, and
serine side chains are consistent with these residues occupying
an �-helical structure (Fig. 4C and Table 2).
We next obtained a 2D 1H–13C INEPT spectrum of EGCG-
treated apoA-I fibrils formed in the presence of heparin (Fig.
4D, blue). Surprisingly, many more signals are observed than
are seen in the spectrum of EGCG-treated fibrils formed in the
absence of heparin (Fig. 4D, red), particularly in the backbone
H�/C� region shown in Fig. 4D. This observation is consistent
with even greater mobilization of the fibrils formed when hep-
arin is present, including enhanced dynamics of the protein
backbone residues. Heparin and EGCG therefore appear to
have an unexpected synergistic effect on increasing apoA-I
mobility within protein fibrils. A simulated INEPT spectrum
(C�–H� region only) based on all 243 apoA-I residues in an
�-helical environment (Fig. 4E) implies that one would expect
many more resonances to be observed if the protein was fully
mobilized to an equal extent across the entire sequence.
EGCG remodels heparin-promoted apoA-I fibrils into
oligomers
We next examined whether the increased mobility of apoA-I
aggregates could originate from resolubilization of the fibrils by
EGCG. CD spectroscopy was used to detect any structured sol-
uble protein that may be released from the fibrils after binding
EGCG. Fresh samples of fibrils formed (at pH 4) after 3 days
were incubated with equimolar EGCG for 12 h, and the remain-
ing insoluble material was removed by centrifugation before
analysis of the supernatant by CD. For control experiments, the
EGCG solution was replaced with McIlvaine buffer alone. Little
signal was observed in the far-UV CD spectra of the control
samples or in the spectra of EGCG-treated fibrils formed in the
absence of heparin to which EGCG had been added (Fig. 5A),
and reliable analysis of the secondary structure could not be
performed. Hence, the concentration of soluble protein is low
in these samples, and most of the protein was removed in the
insoluble fraction. In marked contrast, when fibrils formed in
the presence of heparin are treated with EGCG, the supernatant
produces a strong signal in the far-UV CD that is characteristic
of structured, soluble protein with �-helical content (Fig. 5A,
red solid line). Quantitative analysis of the spectrum using the
CONTINILL fitting algorithm (Fig. 5B, red lines) indicates that
the structure of the soluble material is �75% �-helical. The CD
spectrum of the native protein (Fig. 5B, black lines), which is
stable in solution at pH 7 (12), indicates a similar helical content
of 68%. Hence, EGCG results in the shedding of molecules with
a predominantly �-helical structure from fibrils formed with
heparin, but it is not clear whether the mobilized protein
reverts to its native structural state. Dynamic light-scattering
(DLS) analysis of the EGCG-treated apoA-I fibrils revealed spe-
cies with a hydrodynamic radius distribution of 5–25 nm
results from dissociation of fibrils assembled with heparin,

 although none of the other buffer- or EGCG-treated samples
released soluble species of this size (Fig. 5D). No species larger
than 25 nm were released from the fibrils. Together, the
ssNMR, CD, and DLS data indicate that EGCG remodels insol-
uble apoA-I fibrils into soluble �-helical species much more
readily when the fibrils have formed in the presence of heparin.
The EGCG-treated fibrils (formed alone or with heparin)
were next centrifuged, and the morphologies of the soluble spe-
cies in the supernatant and the insoluble material in the pellet
were visualized using negative stain TEM. For the fibrils formed
alone, exposure to EGCG does not disrupt the fibrillar mor-
phology within the insoluble fraction, and the soluble fraction is
virtually free of visible protein aggregates in the 5–25-nm range
(Fig. 6A). By contrast, fibrils formed in the presence of heparin
are remodeled by EGCG into small, granular structures that
remain insoluble, whereas a proliferation of soluble spherical
oligomer-like species, 20–30 nm in diameter, is now also pres-
ent (Fig. 6B). No such species of apoA-I were observed at any
point in the absence of EGCG. Indeed, apoA-I assembly into
fibrils is instantaneous in the presence of heparin at pH 4 and is
unlikely to proceed via oligomeric intermediates. The com-
bined effect of heparin and EGCG appears to extensively
remodel the apoA-I aggregates into unique �-helical oligomers
that are otherwise not observed in the aggregation pathway. In
the absence of heparin, the effect of EGCG is less pronounced
and more selective for specific regions of the protein. For com-
parison, we also visualized the effect of EGCG on A�40 fibrils
(formed by seeding their growth in the absence of heparin). The
results showed that fibrils are fragmented into smaller, spear-
like structures after treatment with EGCG, as reported previ-
ously (29), although the smaller oligomeric and amorphous
species observed in the same work are not observed here (Fig.
6C).
We next investigated whether the soluble apoA-I aggregates
released by EGCG are toxic to cells at varying molar ratios of
EGCG to protein. A cell viability assay using the cellular dehy-
drogenase-sensitive dye WST-8 was used to assess the cytotox-
icity of EGCG-treated apoA-I fibrils to human umbilical artery
endothelialcells(Fig.7,AandB).Insolublefibrils(7.2�Mmono-
mer equivalent), formed in the absence or presence of 14.4 �M
heparin, were treated with EGCG up to a 5-fold molar excess
(i.e. 36 �M) of the polyphenol over the protein, and the solutions
were added to the cells after removal of the extant insoluble
material. Cell viability is not impaired when apoA-I fibrils are
exposed to equimolar or lower concentrations of EGCG, and
this is apparent whether or not apoA-I fibrils are formed alone
or with heparin (Fig. 7, A and B). Fibrils treated with higher
concentrations of EGCG (2–5-fold excess) do show some

 impairment of cell viability (Fig. 7, A and B). However, control
measurements on cells treated with 36 �M EGCG, 14.2 �M hep-
arin, or 36 �M EGCG and 14.2 �M heparin together, all in the
absence of apoA-I, indicate that the cytotoxic effect at higher
EGCG concentrations is a direct result of excess polyphenol
and is not related to the presence of apoA-I (Fig. 7C). ssNMR,
DLS, CD, and TEM all agree that apoA-I fibrils formed in the
presence of heparin release soluble oligomers after treatment
with equimolar EGCG. Here, the data indicate clearly that the
soluble oligomers are not cytotoxic.
EGCG interacts with monomeric apoA-I but not with heparin
Exposure of apoA-I fibrils formed in the presence of heparin
releases heparin into the aqueous phase in an EGCG concen-
tration-dependent manner (Fig. 7D). We therefore investigated
whether EGCG interacts with heparin as well as with the mono-
meric protein. A solution-state WaterLOGSY NMR experi-
ment was used to detect EGCG binding to heparin and,
separately, to monomeric apoA-I. In the WaterLOGSY exper-
iments, bulk water magnetization is transferred to EGCG if it
binds to the larger protein or polysaccharide molecule, result-
ing in resonances for EGCG that are of opposite sign to nonin-
teracting compounds. We here used the internal reference
trimethylsilylpropanoate (TSP) as the nonbinding molecule,
comparing the sign of the peak at 0 ppm with EGCG aromatic
resonances. WaterLOGSY spectra of EGCG alone and in the
presence of heparin or apoA-I were compared with the corre-
sponding 1D 1H spectra (Fig. 8). As expected, peaks from TSP
and EGCG are narrow and have the same sign in the 1D and
WaterLOGSY spectra in the absence of either of the macromol-
ecules (Fig. 8A). In the presence of apoA-I, the peaks from
EGCG broaden and take the opposite sign to the TSP peak in
the WaterLOGSY spectrum (Fig. 8B), consistent with EGCG-
protein binding, whereas the spectra of EGCG in the presence
of heparin do not indicate an interaction between the two mol-
ecules (Fig. 8C).
Finally, we investigated whether EGCG interacts with apoA-I
as the unoxidized polyphenol or in the form of oxidized quino-
nes. The reactive form of EGCG influences whether the inter-
action with apoA-I is covalent or noncovalent. EGCG is able to
undergo auto-oxidation, generating quinones and superoxide,
which in turn promotes further EGCG oxidation (46). The qui-
nones can self-react to form polymeric species via intermolec-

 ular cross-linking and can also react covalently with available
SH or NH2 groups of proteins (47). Under oxygenated condi-
tions in solution at pH 7.4, EGCG was shown to be fully oxi-
dized after a 6-h incubation period (33). Here, we assessed
whether the low pH conditions used in the aggregation and
re-solubilization studies protected against EGCG oxidation.
EGCG polyphenol absorbs maximally at �275 nm, but oxida-
tion above pH 7 results in a color change and shift in the absor-
bance maximum to 320 nm (48). Here, at pH 4 the maximum
absorbance of EGCG alone in solution (72 �M) remained
unchanged for 3 days with no evidence of additional absor-
bance bands appearing above 320 nm (data not shown), indi-
cating that the polyphenol alone remains stable under these
conditions. We next used LC-MS to determine whether EGCG
undergoes oxidation over time in the presence of apoA-I. The
LC-MS chromatograms for fresh and aged (up to 3 days) solu-
tions of EGCG and apoA-I, with or without heparin showed an
intense peak at 7.65 min (Fig. 9A). The peak area does not
decrease significantly when measured after incubation of
EGCG and apoA-I for 1–3 days (in fact, a slightly unexplained
increase was observed), and no additional peaks consistent with
oxidation or degradation products can be seen (Fig. 9B). The
[M � H]� and [M � H]� peaks in the positive and negative
polarity scans, respectively, were used to obtain extracted ion
chromatograms (XIC) from which peak integration values were
obtained. For both positive and negative ionization modes, the
base peak observed at 7.65 min was assigned to a commonly
observed adduction of unmodified EGCG at 459.0903 and
457.08 m/z, respectively (Fig. 9C). Finally, we checked whether
fibrils of apoA-I could be covalently modified by EGCG, using
ssNMR and 15N-labeled protein (in the absence of heparin).
The 15N MAS NMR spectrum of apoA-I fibrils alone exhibit
clear peaks from the lysine and arginine NH2 groups (Fig. 9D),
which remain unchanged when the fibrils were incubated with
EGCG for 1 day. A decrease in the lysine peak intensities and
the appearance of peaks at higher chemical shifts (�120 ppm
for Schiff bases) would be expected if the primary amines were
covalently modified. We therefore conclude that EGCG does
not oxidize or covalently modify apoA-I under the conditions
applied here.
Discussion
In the above experiments, we set out to investigate whether
EGCG exerts a potentially protective effect on apoA-I amyloid
that is associated with atherosclerosis, as reported for several
other amyloidogenic proteins associated with disease (49, 50).
Studies on A�40/42, �-synuclein, amylin, huntingtin, and tran-
sthyretin have all shown a common ability of EGCG to bind to
the oligomeric and multimeric forms of amyloid, to inhibit fibril
assembly, and to prevent formation of toxic structures (28, 29,
51–55). In the case of both A�40/42 and �-synuclein, EGCG
prevents fibrillogenesis by binding preferentially to unfolded

 protein, directing assembly toward off-pathway nontoxic olig-
omers, and thereby preventing formation of toxic oligomers
and protofibrils (29). When added to pre-formed aggregates,
EGCG can also alter their �-sheet conformation and convert
aggregates into small, nontoxic amorphous aggregates (28, 29).
Remodeling of amyloid from several different proteins may also
involve auto-oxidation of EGCG, which can result in covalent
modification of free amine groups, although this mechanism is
not the major driving force for the structural remodeling (33).
Here, we have identified similarities but also reveal a remarka-
ble and hitherto unknown synergy between the effect of this
polyphenol and the GAG heparin on the behavior of an amyloid
aggregate.
To rationalize our observations, it is convenient to consider
the structural features of apoA-I aggregates at the molecular
level. ApoA-I forms ThT-responsive aggregates under oxida-
tive or acidic conditions, and the process is accelerated by the
GAG analogue heparin, which co-localizes with the fibrils (Fig.
1). In the latter regard, apoA-I behaves similarly to A�, �-sy-
nuclein, and amylin, all of which assemble into amyloid more
rapidly in the presence of heparin (42, 56–59). In some cases,
heparin decorates the surface of the fibrils, such as in salmon
calcitonin fibrils (60) and in the 3Q fibrils of A�40 (42, 45, 59),
whereas in other cases heparin does not form a stable complex
with the insoluble fibrils (61). The apoA-I aggregates formed
under the conditions employed here are predominantly fibrillar
(�10 nm diameter), which form alongside amorphous material
that is known to form around the native protein’s pI of 5.2 (62).
The rate of fibril formation is rapid at pH 4, which is a much
more acidic pH than that measured in ex vivo lesions (14). How-
ever, the fibrillar end point appears to be structurally identical
to fibrils formed at a higher, more physiological pH after
myeloperoxidase-catalyzed oxidation or after incubation of
unmodified protein for longer periods (12). The low pH condi-
tions applied here are for the purpose of expediting the fibrillar
end point rather than for replicating the lesional microenviron-
ment. ssNMR spectra reveal the co-existence of �-helical and
�-sheet secondary structural elements in approximately the
same proportions in the apoA-I aggregates, regardless of the
aggregation conditions employed (Fig. 4). We believe that both
structural elements occur within a single fibrillar architecture,
such that each protein molecule within an aggregate possesses
both �-sheet and �-helical regions. An alternative explanation
that apoA-I assembles via two divergent pathways into discrete
assemblies of extensively �-sheet protein and predominantly
�-helical protein is also possible.
EGCG is the major polyphenol component of green tea
known bind to pre-formed aggregates of apoA-I. EGCG has
been shown to interact with Ile, Phe, and Tyr residues, prevent-
ing the hydrophobic contacts required for conversion to a sta-
ble �-sheet conformation and enabling disaggregation of pre-
formed amyloid fibrils (63). A�40 assembles into fibrils via
conformationally labile states, potentially enabling access of
EGCG to block hydrophobic contacts, but the compact native
structure of lipid-free apoA-I (64) and its ability to form abun-
dance of hydrophobic contacts stabilizing the native helical
bundle may overcome any inhibitory effect that EGCG may
exert.
The most striking outcome of this work is the effect of hep-
arin on the ability of EGCG to restructure aggregates of apoA-I.
In the absence of heparin, EGCG selectively mobilizes the ala-
nine, valine, and threonine side chain within �-helical regions,
and proline residues are also affected (Fig. 4). Proline residues
occur throughout the apoA-I sequence and punctuate the hel-
ical regions with hinges, enabling the protein to form the annu-
lar belt-like structure associated with HDL (65). The INEPT
ssNMR experiments indicate that the amino acid side chains
are mobilized to a greater extent than the backbone (Fig. 4C),
which implies that EGCG acts largely peripherally, leaving the
stable �-sheet core of the fibrils intact. When EGCG is added to
fibrils assembled in the presence of heparin, its remodeling
effect is amplified significantly, yielding an abundance of spher-

 ical oligomers �20 nm in diameter that are nontoxic to human
endothelial cells.
How do heparin and EGCG cooperate to remodel apoA-I
fibrils? A direct interaction between EGCG and heparin was
ruled out by WaterLOGSY NMR experiments. Heparin was
also shown to enhance the aggregation kinetics of apoA-I (Fig.
2D), likely by the high local ionic strength micro-environment
of heparin combined with the directionality and periodicity of
its anionic groups that may act as a template for apoA-I assem-
bly (66). The ssNMR spectra do not support major structural
differences in the fibrils formed with or without heparin (Fig. 3),
but it is possible that subtle structural modifications by heparin
could open up additional binding sites for EGCG. Alternatively,
the partial mobilization of the fibrils by EGCG seen in the
absence of heparin could be amplified by heparin when bound
to the fibril surface.
The lack of cellular toxicity of the soluble oligomers pro-
moted by EGCG in the presence of heparin, when taken
together with their absence during the fibril assembly pathway,
suggests that these are unique species formed specifically by the
action of EGCG on the fibrils, rather than a regeneration of
on-pathway, toxic annular oligomers that are observed for
other amyloidogenic peptides and proteins (67). Annular spe-
cies have been observed when methionine-oxidized apoA-I

 undergoes aggregation at pH 6 (68), but these are not formed
reproducibly and are in much smaller amounts than the profu-
sion of oligomers observed here. Why the oligomers are not
toxic is unclear. EGCG binds to pre-formed oligomers of �-sy-
nuclein and protects against their inherent cytotoxicity by
inhibiting oligomer–membrane interactions (69). A similar
mechanism might underlie the observations on apoA-I but can-
not easily be tested because of the inability to prepare pre-
formed oligomers in the absence of EGCG.
The ability of EGCG to reproduce the observed effects in vivo
depends on the available concentration of EGCG in blood and
in the aortic intima. EGCG reaches maximum plasma concen-
tration 2 h after drinking a cup of green tea, but the steady-state
concentration may be much higher for frequent green tea
drinkers (70). Studies with human serum albumin (HSA) indi-
cate that EGCG binds to two high-affinity sites (KD � 22 �M)
and several additional low-affinity surface sites (mM KD), sug-
gesting that plasma concentrations of HSA (�600 �M) can bind
up to 98% of EGCG (71). This would account for the slow
metabolism of EGCG but could also restrict its availability for
interactions with amyloid proteins, including A�, �-synuclein,
and apoA-I. However, as Eaton and Williamson point out in
their recent work (71), the weaker (millimolar) binding implies
fast off-rates and the weakly bound EGCG would dissociate at a
rate of 100 s�1 or faster (assuming the association rate is at the
diffusion-limit). Hence, the exchange of EGCG between HSA
and tissue is likely to be rapid. With regard to the atheroscle-
rotic environment, HSA and its cargo can enter the proteogly-
can-rich intimal layer of the aorta from the luminal and adven-
titial sides (72), and the concentration of HSA in the interstitial
space is approximately half that in plasma (73). Further detailed
experiments, beyond the scope of this work, will be required to
establish whether the local acidic environment of atheroma-
tous tissue enhances the release of sufficient EGCG from HSA
for interaction with fibrillar apoA-I. It is interesting to note,
however, that EGCG affinity for BSA decreases in acidic solu-
tion (74).
In summary, we demonstrate here an unusual interplay
between apoA-I, EGCG, and heparin that, together, mobilize
fibrils and result in the shedding of nontoxic oligomers that
does not occur in the presence of either ligand alone. The
results add a layer of complexity in considering the effects of
small molecules on the progress of amyloid assembly and amy-
loid-associated cytotoxicity in a cellular context, wherein other
components such as GAGs may affect the outcome of admin-
istration of a small molecule. Indeed, a number of natural GAG
variants have been identified as co-localizing with amyloid
plaques, including chondroitin sulfate (75–77), dermatan sul-
fate (78), and keratan sulfate (79), all of which, like heparin and
HS, contain polysulfated disaccharide units. Whether fibril
mobilization is a benefit or a threat may also be reconsidered,
where reduction of fibril load may be of greater benefit than the
production of small amounts of oligomers, which may be
degraded, further dissociated by binding to molecular chaper-
ones in vivo. Whatever the outcome, the results presented sug-
gest that it may now be appropriate to re-evaluate the wider,
potentially protective effects of EGCG as an amyloid-remodel-
ing agent, by considering the synergistic effects of GAGs and
other ubiquitous co-factors of amyloid in vivo.
Materials and methods
Protein expression and fibril formation
Expression of N-terminally His-tagged apoA-I was carried
out by following previously published methods (80, 81). A
pNFXex expression vector coding for human apoA-I with an
N-terminal His tag (kindly provided by Dr. M. Oda, Oakland
Research Institute) was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21
(DE3) cells (Agilent Technologies) and grown at 37 °
C in LB
media containing 100 �g/ml ampicillin (Melford Laboratories).
The plasmid construct expresses apoA-I with an E2D mutation
enabling removal of the His tag by cleavage of the acid-labile
Asp-2–Pro-3 peptide bond with formic acid, leaving the native
residues 3–243. The remaining expression and purification
methods are described in Ref. 12.
ApoA-I fibrils were formed from up to 36 �M apoA-I incu-
bated in McIlvaine buffer (165 mM Na2HPO4, 17.6 mM citrate,
pH 4), typically for 3 days (unless specified otherwise), alone or
in the presence of a 2-fold molar excess of heparin (IdoU(2S)-
GlcNS(6S) 14–15 kDa, �70%, Iduron). Expression of MA�40
and fibril formation by seeding with the 3-fold symmetrical
(3Q) morphology was carried out as described previously (45).
Isolation of polyphenol compounds from green tea
Green tea (2 g, Twining’sTM pure) was added to 40 ml of
water. The solution was microwaved at 900 watts of power for
two cycles of 30 s, followed by four cycles of 15 s with a minute
between each heating. The solution was filtered through a
1-�m filter paper (Whatman) and filtered with a 20-�m Corn-
ing syringe filter. The solution was then freeze-dried until fur-
ther use.
HPLC analysis of green tea compounds is as follows: a stock
solution of the green tea extract was prepared by dissolving the
lyophilized material in water (7.2 mg/ml) for analysis by
reverse-phase HPLC. The pH of the solution was 7.5. A stan-
dard mixture of eight green tea catechins (each at 100 �g/ml)
(Sigma, UK) was used as a reference set to assist in the assign-
ment of HPLC peaks. Separation was performed on a NexeraX2
UHPLC (Shimadzu) system with a mobile phase of 0.1%
orthophosphate in ultrapure water (A) or in acetonitrile (B),
whereas the static phase consisted of a Shim-pack XR-ODS 2.2
�m, 3.0 � 50 mm) reverse-phase column. The green tea stock
solution was injected after a further 10-fold dilution in water,
and the standard catechin solution was injected without further
treatment. The injection volume was 10 �l in both cases. The
gradient elution, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, consisted of 0–3
min (5% of B), 3–10 min (5–20% B), 10–13 min (20–50%),
13–13.1 min (50 to 5% B), and 13.1–20 min (5% B). Absorbance
intensity was measured at 275 nm with a bandwidth of 4 nm.
For determination of green tea polyphenol binding to
apoA-I, a 200-�l suspension of apoA-I fibrils (36 �M monomer
equivalent) was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 � g. The green
tea stock solution was diluted 200-fold in water, and 200 �l was
added to the fibrillar pellets followed by incubation with agita-
tion at 37 °
C for 24 h. The fibrils were pelleted through centrif-

treatment for analysis by HPLC as described above.
LC-MS analysis of EGCG
ApoA-I (36 �M) plus 72 �M EGCG was acidified at pH 4 in
the presence and absence of 72 �M heparin, and fibrils were
allowed to form over 3 days at 37 °
C with shaking. At intervals of
0 and 1–3 days, the samples were centrifuged, and 50-�l ali-
quots of supernatant were taken for further testing by LC-MS.
Mass spectra were acquired using a Shimadzu LC-MS-IT-TOF
mass spectrometer. LC separations were performed using a
Shimadzu NexeraX2 UHPLC instrument consisting of a DGU-
20A5R degassing unit, two LC-30AD LC pumps, a SIL-30AC
autosampler, and a CTO-20AC column oven. Separation was
performed using a Shim-pack XR-ODS (3.0 � 50 mm, 2.2 mm)

queued for analysis. The LC-MS/ion trap-TOF mass accuracy
was calibrated with sodium trifluoroacetate clusters prior to
analysis of the batch of samples. LC-MS data were analyzed
using Shimadzu LC-MS solution software, and peak areas were

Binding of heparin to apoA-I fibrils
In vitro binding assays of apoA-I fibril-heparin binding were
performed using an adaptation of a procedure described previ-
ously (59), in which the amount of GAG remaining unbound at
different fibril/GAG concentration ratios was determined
using Bacteroides heparinase I (New England Biolabs Ltd., UK).
The heparinase enzyme cleaves heparin yielding oligosaccha-
ride products containing unsaturated uronic acids, which can
be detected using UV spectroscopy at 232 nm. Fibrils were pre-
pared by acidification of apoA-I in the presence of heparin
(Sigma), at the following protein/heparin molar ratios: 1:0.5,
1:1, and 1:2. In addition, samples of protein only and heparin
only were prepared as controls. In all cases, the heparin concen-
tration was kept at 1 mg/ml (72 �M). ApoA-I was initially solu-
bilized in pH 7 McIlvaine’s buffer together with heparin before
carrying out a shift to pH 4 with the addition of concentrated
HCl. Samples were incubated at 37 °
C for 3 days with shaking to
allow fibril formation prior to sedimentation of the protein. The
supernatant was removed and returned to pH 7 with 5 M NaOH
before assay. Samples were monitored at 30 °
C, with A232 mea-
surements taken every 10 s until maximal absorbance was
reached. The amount of heparin remaining in solution was then
calculated from a heparin calibration curve.
Effect of green tea compounds on the aggregation of apoA-I
ThT fluorescence experiments were carried out as described
in Ref. 12. Briefly, apoA-I (7.2 �M) was incubated with ThT
alone and in the presence of 14.4 �M heparin. Samples (in trip-
licate) were incubated with no further additives, with pure
green tea extract solution (6.6 ng/ml, roughly equivalent to a
2-fold molar excess of EGCG), or 14.4 �M EGCG. After mea-
suring the fluorescence for 10 min, concentrated HCl was
added to reduce the sample to pH 4 and induce aggregation.
ThT fluorescence measurements were taken over 300 min at
1-min intervals.
Binding of EGCG to apoA-I fibrils
The apoA-I (36 �M) was incubated alone or with increasing
concentrations of EGCG at pH 4, 37 °
C, for 3 days with agita-
tion. After this time, the fibrils of apoA-I formed in the absence
of EGCG were incubated for a further 24 h in the presence of
EGCG. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation
at 13,400 rpm in a bench-top centrifuge. The absorbance of the
supernatant at 274 nm (the wavelength of maximum absorp-
tion of EGCG) was measured and used to determine how much
EGCG remained in solution by comparison with a standard
curve of A274 for EGCG at a range of concentrations from 0.01
to 1 mM.
Transmission EM
ApoA-I (36 �M), in the absence and presence of heparin (72
�M), was incubated at pH 4 at 37 °
C with agitation for 3 days.
Samples were centrifuged, and the pellets were washed several
times with distilled water to remove buffer salts. Some pellets
were resuspended in 36 �M EGCG and incubated overnight at
25 °
C before removal of the bulk solution by centrifugation.
Pellets were then diluted to 18 �M, before 10 �l was loaded onto
carbon-coated copper grids and incubated for 30 s. Excess sam-
ple was removed by blotting. Grids (Agar Scientific Ltd., Stan-
sted, UK) were washed two times with 10 �l of water. The grid
was then stained by inverting it onto a 10-�l droplet of 2% (w/v)
uranyl acetate and blotting, followed by addition of another
10-�l uranyl acetate droplet. After 30 s of staining, the grid was
blotted and left to dry for 5 min at room temperature. The
sample was then visualized on a JEOL JEM-1400 electron
microscope at 100 kV. TEM images were calibrated in ImageJ
(National Institutes of Health) using the TEM scale bar on each
image. Calibrated lines were drawn to measure fibril width for a
total of 25 instances per image. These instances could include
up to three measurements of the same fibril at different posi-
tions in the image. A total of five images for apoA alone and five
images of apoA � heparin was analyzed, resulting in an average
fibril width of 10.7 � 0.4 nm for apoA alone and 15.4 � 1.3 nm
for apoA � heparin. All measurements were then binned into
1-nm categories for data presentation.
CD spectroscopy
ApoA-I (36 �M) alone or in the presence of heparin (72 �M)
was incubated at pH 4 at 37 °
C for 3 days with agitation. The

 samples were centrifuged, and the pellets washed several times
with distilled water to remove buffer salts. The aggregated
apoA-I was resuspended in McIlvaine buffer or McIlvaine
buffer containing 36 �M EGCG. The samples were then incu-
bated at 37 °
C with agitation for 24 h and then centrifuged at
14,000 rpm to remove the insoluble aggregated protein. Spectra
of the supernatants were acquired on a Chirascan Plus CD spec-
trometer between 180 and 260 nm with a bandwidth of 1 nm,
using a path length of 0.2 mm. Background signals (i.e. from
buffer, heparin, EGCG, or EGCG and heparin) were subtracted,
and the spectra were analyzed using CDApps software (82).
Fitting was performed using the CONTINLL algorithm.
Dynamic light-scattering
ApoA-I (36 �M) in the absence and presence of heparin (72
�M) was incubated at pH 4 at 37 °
C with agitation for 3 days.
Insoluble fibrils were centrifuged and washed three times with
distilled water to remove buffer salts. The fibrils were resus-
pended in McIlvaine buffer or McIlvaine buffer with 36 �M
EGCG and incubated at 37 °
C for 24 h. The insoluble aggre-
gated material was removed through centrifugation at
14,000 rpm, and the supernatant was loaded into low-vol-
ume plastic cuvettes. DLS spectra were acquired on a Zeta-
sizer Nano Zs instrument. The size distribution (in nanome-
ters) by percentage volume was recorded and averaged over
three scans.
Solid-state NMR
Uniformly 13C-labeled apoA-I (5 mg at 36 �M) was incubated
with agitation at pH 4 at 37 °
C for 3 days alone or in the presence
of 72 M heparin or with 72 �M heparin and 36 �M EGCG. Fol-
lowing the production of insoluble material, aggregates were
harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 � g for 10 min. The aggre-
gates were centrifuged into a zirconium 3.2 mm rotor with a
Kel-F cap (Bruker, UK). In some samples, EGCG (36 �M) was
added in a volume of 5 ml to the apoA-I samples and left for 24 h
before transferring the pellet to the NMR rotor.
Two-dimensional 13C–13C ssNMR spectra were recorded at
a magnetic field of 16.3 tesla on a Bruker Avance III 700 spec-
trometer, with a 3.2-mm HXY probe operating in double-reso-
nance mode. Spectra were obtained with magic angle spinning
at 14 kHz. Hartmann-Hahn cross-polarization was achieved
with a 2-ms contact time, and 100 kHz proton decoupling with
SPINAL-64 applied during signal acquisition. During the mix-
ing time of 20 ms, the 1H nutation frequency was lowered to 14
kHz to achieve dipolar-assisted rotational resonance (DARR)
mixing. A total of 256 t1 increments were recorded using
the States-TPPI method for phase sensitivity, with 256 tran-
sients per increment. One- and two-dimensional refocused
INEPT ssNMR spectra (83) and proton-decoupled 15N cross-
polarization–magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) spectra were
recorded at a magnetic field of 9.3 tesla on a Bruker Avance III
400 spectrometer. Spectra were obtained with magic angle
spinning at 8 kHz. For CP-MAS, a contact time of 2 ms and
proton spin-lock frequency of 63 kHz were applied, with proton
decoupling at 83 kHz.
Solution-state NMR
Proton spectra were recorded at a magnetic field of 9.3 tesla.
Spectra were obtained for EGCG (360 �M) in 10 mM phosphate
buffer, pH 7, alone or in the presence of heparin (36 �M)
or apoA-I (36 �M). 1D gradient NOESY experiments were
acquired with relaxation delays of 2 s, a mixing time of 10 ms, a
presaturation power of 25 Hz, and 128 scans. Gradient
strengths were the default for this sequence: GPZ1 50%, GPZ2
�10%. Spectral width was 8012.82 Hz, the offset on-resonance
with the water peak, and 64k points (acquisition time 4.1 s).
Spectra were zero-filled once and processed with a 0.3 Hz expo-
nential line-broadening. WaterLOGSY spectra were acquired
with relaxation delays of 1 s, a mixing time of 1.7 s, 2 dummy
scans, and 128 scans. No spin-lock was applied to observe the
receptor signals The selective inversion pulse for the NOESY
block was a 7.5-ms Gaussian pulse, although that in the excita-
tion sculpting block was a 2-ms sinc pulse (again, the prosol
defaults). The spectral width was 6393.862 Hz, the offset on-
resonance with the water peak, and 16k points (acquisition time
1.28 s). Spectra were zero-filled once and processed with a 1 Hz
exponential line-broadening.
Cell viability
Human umbilical artery endothelial cells (Sigma) were plated
on 96-well plates at a cell density of �5000 cells per well and
grown overnight at 37 °
C to allow the cells to adhere. ApoA-I
aggregates (72 �M) were formed over 3 days at pH 4 in the
presence or absence of 144 �M heparin. Fibrils were pelleted
and washed three times in pH 4 McIlvaine’s to remove any
unaggregated material before resuspending at the same con-
centrations. Samples were divided into equal volume aliquots,
and EGCG was added at a range of concentrations to give molar
ratios of 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5:1 EGCG/apoA-I, and left for
a further 24 h, before the addition of 10-�l samples to the cells
(100 �l assay volume). Following incubation at 37 °
C for 48 h, 10
�l of the Cell Counting Kit (CCK-8) (Sigma) solution was added
and incubated for a further 3 h prior to absorbance measure-
ment at 450 nm.
