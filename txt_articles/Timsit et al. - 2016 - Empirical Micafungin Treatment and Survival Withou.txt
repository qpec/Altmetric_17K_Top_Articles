IMPORTANCE Although frequently used in treating intensive care unit (ICU) patients with
sepsis, empirical antifungal therapy, initiated for suspected fungal infection, has not been
shown to improve outcome.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether empirical micafungin reduces invasive fungal infection
(IFI)–free survival at day 28.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled study of
260 nonneutropenic, nontransplanted, critically ill patients with ICU-acquired sepsis,
multiple Candida colonization, multiple organ failure, exposed to broad-spectrum
antibacterial agents, and enrolled between July 2012 and February 2015 in 19 French ICUs.
INTERVENTIONS Empirical treatment with micafungin (100 mg, once daily, for 14 days)
(n = 131) vs placebo (n = 129).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was survival without proven IFI 28
days after randomization. Key secondary end points included new proven fungal infections,
survival at day 28 and day 90, organ failure, serum (1-3)-β-D-glucan level evolution, and
incidence of ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia.
RESULTS Among 260 patients (mean age 63 years; 91 [35%] women), 251 (128, micafungin
group; 123, placebo group) were included in the modified intent-to-treat analysis. Median
values were 8 for Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, 3 for number of
Candida-colonized sites, and 99 pg/mL for level of (1-3)-β-D-glucan. On day 28, there were 82
(68%) patients in the micafungin group vs 79 (60.2%) in the placebo group who were alive
and IFI free (hazard ratio [HR], 1.35 [95% CI, 0.87-2.08]). Results were similar among patients
with a (1-3)-β-D-glucan level of greater than 80 pg/mL (n = 175; HR, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.85-2.33]).
Day-28 IFI–free survival in patients with a high SOFA score (>8) was not significantly different
when compared between the micafungin vs placebo groups (HR, 1.69 [95% CI, 0.96-2.94]).
Use of empirical micafungin decreased the rate of new invasive fungal infection in 4 of 128
patients (3%) in the micafungin group vs placebo (15/123 patients [12%]) (P = .008).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among nonneutropenic critically ill patients with
ICU-acquired sepsis, Candida species colonization at multiple sites, and multiple organ failure,
empirical treatment with micafungin, compared with placebo, did not increase fungal
infection–free survival at day 28.

D
espite the development of effective and safer drugs,
invasive candidiasis and candidemia remain associ-
ated with high and increasing mortality,1 particularly
when complicated by septic shock.2 The optimal manage-
ment of Candida species infections includes early awareness
of patients at risk, control of the infection source, and timely
administration of appropriate antifungal agents.2-5 Conse-
quently, antifungal agents have been widely used as empiri-
cal therapy, ie, for treating suspected fungal infection in pa-
tients at risk for invasive candidiasis or patients with
unresolved sepsis.6-9
Two multicenter randomized clinical trials evaluated
empirical antifungal therapy for fungal infection suspicion
in patients with a central catheter and persistent fever
despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibacterial agents.
One study demonstrated that empirical fluconazole did not
improve clinical outcomes vs placebo in patients at high risk
for invasive candidiasis.5 Another trial evaluated antifungal
prophylaxis using caspofungin among intensive care unit
(ICU) patients with at least 2 risk factors for candidemia.10
Caspofungin failed to significantly improve the primary end
point, as proven or probable invasive candidiasis occurred
in 16.7% of the placebo recipients vs 9.8% of the caspofun-
gin recipients. There was no difference in mortality across
groups. Subsequently, empirical antifungal therapy was
incorporated into guidelines for nonimmunocompromised
critically ill patients with unresolved ICU-acquired sepsis.11
Despite lack of evidence-based data, as much as 8% of ICU
patients without documented Candida infection receive
antifungal agents.12,13 The number of organ system failures
and incidences of Candida colonization at multiple sites and
high serum (1-3)-β-D-glucan levels have been well estab-
lished as risk factors for candidemia.14,15 To our knowledge,
no randomized clinical trial of colonization-driven empirical
therapy has been performed in critically ill patients at risk
for invasive candidiasis.
The multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled
EMPIRICUS (Empirical Antifungal Treatment in ICUS) trial was
designed to evaluate whether micafungin, as compared with
placebo, increases 28-day invasive fungal infection–free sur-
vival among patients with ICU-acquired sepsis, Candida colo-
nization at multiple sites, and multiple organ failure.
Methods
Study Design and Oversights
The study design has been published elsewhere16 and the trial
protocol is reported in Supplement 1.
EMPIRICUS,amulticenter,randomized,double-blind,and
parallel-group study, compared the benefit from a 14-day em-
pirical treatment with micafungin (100 mg administered in-
traveneously, 1×/d) vs placebo associated with day-28 sur-
vival without invasive fungal infection among adult patients
with suspected invasive candidiasis.
Empirical treatment was defined as an antifungal treat-
ment for suspected nondocumented invasive fungal in-
fection in patients with unresolved sepsis despite broad-
spectrum antibacterial therapy for at least 4 days and mul-
tiple sites colonized with Candida species.
The study involved 19 ICUs in France and was approved
by an authorized ethics committee (Comité de Protection des
Personnes CPP Sud Est V; December 7, 2011; see the trial pro-
tocol in Supplement 1) and the French Health Authorities
(AFSSAPS; December 2, 2011).
Written informed consent was obtained from all partici-
pants or their proxies (in cases of impaired decision-making
capacity) at the time of enrollment.
Patients and Randomization
Inclusion Criteria
Criticallyilladultpatientswereeligibleforthestudyiftheymet
thefollowingcriteria:(1)mechanicallyventilatedatleast5days;
(2) with at least 1 colonization site (other than rectal swab or
stool) positive for Candida species using traditional culture
methods; (3) at least 1 additional organ dysfunction; (4) previ-
ous treatment for more than 4 days using broad-spectrum an-
tibacterial agents within the last 7 days; (5) 1 arterial or central
vein catheter, and (6) 1 new finding of ICU-acquired sepsis of
unknown origin (eBox in Supplement 2).
Exclusion Criteria
Main exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) neutrophil count
of less than 500/mm3; (2) previous bone marrow or solid
organ transplantation; (3) ongoing systemic immunosup-
pressant agent therapy other than corticosteroids at doses
lower than 2 mg/kg/d of prednisolone or equivalent; and
(4) antifungal treatment with an echinocandin agent for
more than 1 day or with any other antifungal agent for more
than 72 hours during the week prior to inclusion16 (see trial
protocol in Supplement 1 and the statistical analysis plan in
Supplement 3).
Randomization
Permuted-block randomization with varying block sizes be-
tween groups used a web-based system programmed by an in-
dependent statistician. Immediately after randomization and
for 14 days, the research pharmacists prepared reconstituted
opaque bags of micafungin or placebo according to the ran-
domization list and provided it to the site for infusion. 16
Key Points
Question Does empirical antifungal therapy increase invasive
fungal infection–free survival at day 28 in nonneutropenic critically
ill patients with sepsis, multiple Candida colonization, and multiple
organ failure exposed to broad-spectrum antibacterials?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 260 adults, there was
no significant difference in the rate of survivors without any fungal
infection at day 28 between micafungin-treated (87/128 [68%])
and placebo-treated (74/123 [60.2%]) groups.
Meaning The use of micafungin as a routine empirical treatment
in critically ill patients with suspected fungal infection did not
improve fungal infection–free survival at 28 days.

A set for blood culture inoculated with 10 mL of blood in
aerobic, anaerobic, and selective milieu were drawn at inclu-
sion before administration of the study drug. During the op-
ening visit of each center, investigators were instructed to per-
form blood cultures, puncture or evacuation of possible
infected sites, funduscopy, and echocardiography to confirm
the fungal nature of any subsequent episodes of sepsis dur-
ing the follow-up.
If the invasive candidiasis at inclusion was evidenced af-
ter randomization by the analysis of baseline samples (ie, re-
sults not available at randomization), or if the investigator
started another antifungal treatment, the study treatment was
withdrawn and the antifungal treatment usually prescribed at
the investigation site was administered to the patient. How-
ever, blinding was not compromised, and the patient re-
mained in the modified intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The end
point was judged as the occurrence of a new invasive fungal
infection or death within 28 days of inclusion.
Data collection and study management are detailed else-
where (Supplement 1).16 Database lock and adjudication of all
suspected or proven invasive candidiasis were performed be-
fore unblinding of the study. The independent adjudication
committee reviewed records of all patients with new antifun-
gal treatment and with positive culture from blood, operative
room, or direct percutaneous puncture of sterile sites. Addi-
tionally, the committee reviewed records of patients with sus-
picion of documented infections and interviewed investiga-
tors by phone when questions were not solved by e-mail. Final
judgment was unanimous in all cases.
End Points
The primary end point was 28-day survival free of proven in-
vasive fungal infection, as defined according to adapted ver-
sion of Tissot et al of the EORTC/MSG (European Organiza-
tion for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal
Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group) defini-
tions from 2008.17
Prespecified secondary end points included new proven
invasive fungal infections during the follow-up, survival at
day 28 and at day 90 (3 months after randomization),
antifungal-free survival at day 28, incidence of ventilator-
associated bacterial pneumonia, and evolution throughout
the 28-day study period of the Sequential Organ Failure
Assessment (SOFA) score (range, 0-24 with higher scores
indicating worse outcome) and of the serum level of (1-3)-β-
D-glucan (a fungal cell antigen identified in blood of patients
with fungal infection). The primary end point was assessed
also in prespecified patient subgroups at increased risk of
fungal infection (medical vs surgical, low vs high SOFA score,
low vs high (1-3)-β-D-glucan level, low vs high colonization
index, Candida score <3 vs ≥3) and the pharmacokinetic and
safety profiles of micafungin. The pharmacokinetics of
micafungin were assessed after the first intravenous adminis-
tration through the evaluation of the plasmatic peak (Cmax)
and plasmatic trough (Cmin), which enabled calculation of
parameters such as the area under the curve (AUC) of the
plasmatic concentrations. Other additional outcomes not
reported in the text were hospital survival, mechanical
ventilation–free days, and colonization index during follow-
up. Molecular biomarkers and molecular markers of resis-
tance of recovered strains from blood cultures will need fur-
ther analyses.
Statistical Analysis
Sample Size Calculation
As previously published,16 it was estimated that (1) the mor-
tality of patients fulfilling the selection criteria would be
between 30% and 37%; (2) the candidemia-related mortality
in case of early treatment would be 12% instead of 35% when
the treatment is delayed (current practice); (3) according to
Schuster et al,5 invasive fungal infection would be diagnosed
in 7.1% of patients receiving antifungal therapy and 20.8% of
those receiving placebo (absolute difference 13.7%); and
(4) the sensitivity of conventional diagnostic tests (blood cul-
tures, culture of sterile site) of invasive fungal infection diag-
nosis would be 60%.18 Therefore, in the micafungin group,
the actual incidence of invasive fungal infections would be
estimated at 11.8% (7.1%/0.6), the rate of candidemia-related
mortality at 1.4% (11.8% × 12%), and the rate of overall events
between 31.4% and 38.4%. In the placebo group, the rate of
candidemia-related mortality would be estimated at 4.13%
(11.8% × 35%), the number of additional invasive fungal
infections diagnosed after randomization at 13.7%,5 and the
rate of overall events between 49.4% and 56.4%. A difference
of 18%, considering the lower and upper estimations of over-
all event rates in both groups, was therefore hypothesized.
A 2-sided log-rank test with an overall sample size of 235
patients (118 in the micafungin group and 117 in the placebo
group) would achieve an ability to detect a difference of 18%
in the primary end point with an 80% power at a 0.05 signifi-
cance level. The hypothesis used was then to increase the pro-
portion of patients surviving free of proven invasive fungal in-
fectionfrom37%intheplacebogroupto55%inthemicafungin
group. To account for secondary dropouts, 260 patients (130
in each group) were needed.
Statistical Analyses Performed by Data
Analyses were calculated using SAS 9.4 (SAS, Inc) and R (R
Foundation for Statistical Computing) software. Compari-
sonswereperformedwithamodifiedITTpopulation.A2-sided
P value of .05 or less was considered statistically significant.
All patients who received at least 1 dose of study treat-
ment were included in the modified ITT analysis.
Missing, unused, or outlying data were checked with
investigators via queries. For instances in which missing val-
ues were confirmed, data concerning the independent vari-
ables were replaced using multiple-imputation methods.
Data were reported as numbers (percentages) or medians
(interquartile ranges [IQRs]). Continuous variables were com-
pared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and the Fisher exact
test was used for proportions. Death or proven invasive fun-
gal infection (primary end point) were evaluated at day 28
and analyzed using survival methods and the Kaplan-Meier
estimate (stratified by center). A Cox model was used for
adjustment of parameters imbalanced between groups.

Results
Study Patients
From July 20, 2012, to February 7, 2015, a total of 260
patients in 19 ICUs were randomized. After database lock
(September 30, 2015), 251 of them were included in the modi-
fied ITT analysis (Figure 1). Patients’ characteristics were
well-balanced between groups, except for diabetes and body
mass index (Table 1). The study patients were severely ill, as
reflected by their overall Simplified Acute Physiology Score
(SAPS II) (range, 0-124 with higher scores indicating worse
outcome), with a median score of 48 (IQR, 39-57) and an
overall median SOFA score of 8 (IQR, 6-11) at randomization.
Vasopressors were administered to more than 50% of the
patients, and renal replacement therapy to 1 of 3. All patients
had multiple risk factors for invasive fungal infection. The
median number of sites colonized at inclusion were 3 (IQR,
2-4 [range, 1-7]; eTable 1 in Supplement 2). The (1-3)-β-D-
glucan level was greater than 80 pg/mL in 175 (70%) patients
(Figure 2).
Eighty-seven (68%) patients in the micafungin group vs
74 (60.2%) patients in the placebo group were alive and free
from invasive fungal infection at day 28 (hazard ratio [HR], 1.35
[95% CI, 0.87-2.08]; Figure 2). Results of the primary end point
regarding various predefined subgroups of interest are re-
ported in Figure 2 for the modified ITT population (with HRs
substantially favoring the micafungin group for patients with
[1-3]-β-D-glucan levels >80 pg/mL, [1-3]-β-D-glucan levels of
250 pg/mL, Candida scores at ≥3, and colonization index
≥50%). Unadjusted analyses provided similar results (eFig-
ures 1 and 2; eTable 2 in Supplement 2). A posthoc analysis,
not taking into account the 12 patients with invasive fungal in-
fection at inclusion, had similar results (HR, 1.39 [95% CI, 0.88-
2.22]; P = .15).

(eFigure 5 and eTable 3 in Supplement 2) and for the antifungal
therapy–free survival rate (eFigure 6 in Supplement 2).
After inclusion, during the study follow-up, 15 (12%) pa-
tients in the placebo group and 4 (3%) patients in the mica-
fungin group developed at least 1 new proven invasive fungal
infection (P = .008) (Table 2). Of these 19 patients, 1 out of 4
(25%) in the micafungin group and 3 out of 15 (20%) in the pla-
cebo group died before day 28.
Other secondary end points, such as the number of organ
failure–free days and the rate of ventilator-acquired pneumo-
nia, were not significantly different between both groups
(eTable 3 in Supplement 2).

the mean (SD) AUC was 78.2 (33.2) mg.h/L.
The drug was well tolerated with few adverse events; es-
pecially, liver enzymes variations were similar between mica-
fungin and control groups (eTables 4 and 5; eFigures 7 and 8

Discussion
In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in
critically ill nonimmunocompromised patients with ICU-
acquired severe sepsis, Candida colonization at multiple
sites, and multiple organ failure, micafungin did not sig-
nificantly improve the primary outcome of 28-day invasive
fungal infection–free survival. There were no significant dif-
ferences in the mortality rates, patient severity of illness fol-
lowing randomization, or in ICU or hospital lengths of stay.
However, micafungin-treated patients had a significant
reduction in the number of ICU-acquired invasive fungal
infections following randomization.

The study failed to demonstrate that an empirical anti-
fungal therapy with micafungin is able to improve, by at least
18%, the rate of survival free from proven fungal infection at
day 28. This finding is unlikely to be from a lack of statistical
powerbecausetheeventrateswerewithintheexpectedranges,
in line with the high severity of illness at admission or inclu-
sion, also reflected by the number of patients receiving life-
sustaining therapies. Furthermore, the intervention failed to
improve outcomes overall, as well as in specific patient sub-
sets such as those with high colonization index, high Candida
score, or high (1-3)-β-D-glucan concentrations. The nonsig-
nificant improvement of day-28 survival without invasive fun-
gal infections among patients with high SOFA scores deserve
further discussion. Because inclusion criteria for this trial com-
prised ICU-acquired sepsis, multiple organ dysfunctions, and
other risk factors for candidemia, this finding suggests that
amongtheseselectedpatients,thosewhoaremostillmayben-
efit from antifungal agents. On one hand, this decreases the
biological plausibility that supports the present intervention,
limitingitsbenefittoasuperniche.Conversely,becausesingle-
target interventions failed in this population, it can be as-
sumed that reducing the incidence of invasive fungal infec-
tion could be seen as a therapeutic intervention that will
ultimately improve survival in patients with established mul-
tiple organ dysfunctions. However the effect of this interven-
tion on mortality is probably lower than suggested by previ-
ous literature.
This trial on empirical antifungals in ICU patients with
Candida extra-intestinal colonization, unresolved sepsis, and
multiple organ failure adds to the 2 previously published stud-
ies regarding 3 aspects. First, it shows that sepsis occurring in
patients with multiple organ dysfunction and multiple-sites
colonization in patients receiving broad-spectrum antibacte-
rials agents is rarely due to invasive fungal infection. Second,
it sheds light on the discrimination power of Candida coloni-
zation.Indeed,inthepresenttrial,whichincludedheavilycolo-
nized patients, questions remain about the relevance of sam-
pling patients for Candida colonization when such sampling
leads to financial burden from laboratory testing and also ex-
cessive antifungal consumption22 without any apparent clini-
cal benefits. A study by Throughton et al reported that Candida
colonization failed to guide empirical therapy,23 and a study
by Barenfanger et al demonstrated significantly reduced an-
tifungal consumption when clinicians were not provided with
Candida colonization results.24 Altogether, these results call
into question the routine use of systematic surveillance for
Candida colonization. Besides sparing unnecessary use of
health care resources, it may also avoid inducing resistances
to antifungals.25-27 Whether this trial closes 3 decades of clini-
cal research on Candida colonization deserves consideration.
Furthermore, the observation that the intervention failed,
irrespective of the patients'(1-3)-β-D-glucan levels, is in line
with previous publications showing that (1-3)-β-D-glucan was
not significantly different between patients with candidemia
vs those with multiple colonization.17 As for documented in-
fections, (1-3)-β-D-glucan kinetics was not influenced by mi-
cafungin therapy, which did not support its use for guiding
antifungal de-escalation.28,29
In addition, this trial adds to the 2 others by reporting mi-
cafungin plasma concentrations. The observed median AUC is
strictly similar to the value of 78.6 mg.h/L that was previously
observedinICUpatients.30Itconfirmsadecreasedexposureby

that higher doses may be necessary in critically ill patients. The
assumption that the present intervention would have proven
benefits by using higher micafungin dosages is not supported
by the significant reduction of ICU-acquired candidemia, un-
lessconsideringthatmicafunginmayhavedecreasedbloodcul-
ture sensitivity without clinical benefit.
Strengths of this study include the multicenter design and
high adherence to the intervention started immediately after
randomization. The proportion of ICU-acquired invasive can-
didiasis is within previously published ranges,2,13,31-33 as is
mortality.1 Also, no patient was lost to follow-up. The risk of
bias was also minimized by the blinded nature of the design,
use of central randomization, concealment of study-group as-
signments before randomization to avoid selection bias, and
a robust primary outcome that could not be influenced by ob-
serverbias.Becausethecentersbelongedtoalargestudygroup
thatincludeduniversityandnon-universityhospitals,thestudy
may have external validity.
This study has a number of limitations. The first is its low
rate of patients with a very high risk of invasive candidiasis,
such as patients with postoperative gastrointestinal leakage of
acute necrotizing pancreatitis.17 Also, micafungin underdos-
ing cannot be ruled out because therapeutic drug monitoring
was not performed after day 1.
Although maximal efforts were made to homogenize the
diagnosis of invasive fungal infection, the procedure that was
used daily in each center to diagnose fungal infections during
the follow-up period might have slightly varied. However, the
consequence of this information bias is limited by the strati-
fication of the random process and the statistical analyses. The
adapted EORTC definition for documented infection used in
this study was previously used in studies by Tissot et al17 and
Ostrosky-Zeichner et al10; however, this definition might pos-
sibly miss true fungal infections.
Besides having Candida species colonization, the inclu-
sion criteria were similar to those used in previous trials of em-
pirical antifungal use in critically ill patients5,10,13 (in whom ill-
ness severity at randomization and mortality rates were
similar). There was no evidence that micafungin influenced
mortality estimates or was beneficial in treating specific sub-
groups.However,empiricaltreatmentshouldbefurtherevalu-
ated in similar patients with a SOFA score greater than 8 at ran-
domization.
Conclusions
Among nonneutropenic critically ill patients with ICU-
acquired sepsis, Candida species colonization at multiple sites,
and multiple organ failure, empirical treatment with micafun-
gin, compared with placebo, did not increase fungal infection–
free survival at day 28.
