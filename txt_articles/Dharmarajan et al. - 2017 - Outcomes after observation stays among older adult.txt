ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To characterize rates and trends over time of 
emergency department treatment-and-discharge 
stays, repeat observation stays, inpatient stays, any 
hospital revisit, and death within 30 days of discharge 
from observation stays.
Design
Retrospective cohort study.
setting
4750 hospitals in the USA.
PartiCiPants
Nationally representative sample of Medicare fee for 
service beneficiaries aged 65 or over discharged after 
363 037 index observation stays, 2 540 000 index 
emergency department treatment-and-discharge 
stays, and 2 667 525 index inpatient stays from 
2006-11.
Main OutCOMe Measures
Rates of emergency department treatment-and-
discharge stays, observation stays, inpatient stays, 
any hospital revisit, and death within 30 days of 
discharge from index observation stays. Rates were 
compared with corresponding outcomes within 30 
days of discharge from both index emergency 
department treatment-and-discharge stays and index 
inpatient stays.
results
Among 363 037 index observation stays resulting in 
discharge from 2006-11, 30 day rates of emergency 
department treatment-and-discharge stays were 8.4%, 
repeat observation stays were 2.9%, inpatient stays 
were 11.2%, any hospital revisit was 20.1%, and death 
was 1.8%. Of all revisits, 49.7% were for inpatient 
stays. Revisit rates for emergency department 
treatment-and-discharge stays, repeat observation 
stays, and any hospital revisit increased from 2006-11 
(P<0.001 for trend), while 30 day rates of inpatient 
stays (P=0.054 for trend) and 30 day mortality 
(P=0.091 for trend) were both unchanged. Averaged 
over the study period, 30 day rates of any hospital 
revisit were similar after discharge from index 
emergency department treatment-and-discharge stays 
(19.9%) and index observation stays (20.1%), as was 
30 day mortality (1.8% for both). Rates of any hospital 
revisit (21.8%) and death (5.2%) were highest after 
discharge from index inpatient stays.
COnClusiOns
Hospital revisits are common after discharge from 
observation stays, frequently result in inpatient 
hospitalizations, and have increased over time among 
Medicare beneficiaries. As revisit rates are similar after 
emergency department and observation stays, 
strategies shown to enhance emergency department 
transitional care may be reasonable starting points to 
improve post-observation outcomes.
Introduction
Observation stays are being increasingly used as an 
alternative to short stay hospitalizations for adults aged 
65 or more in the USA. Observation stays typically fol-
low emergency department care and are meant to pro-
vide short term treatment and frequent reassessment 
for inpatient hospitalization.1 2  Although technically 
considered an outpatient service, observation stays can 
physically occur in the emergency department, in a 
dedicated hospital observation unit, or in the inpatient 
hospital setting. Patients receiving observation services 
may share a room with other patients receiving emer-
gency department care or inpatient care. Observation 
stays are generally reimbursed less generously than 
inpatient stays. Payers (including the Centers for Medi-
care & Medicaid Services) have encouraged the use of 
observation stays rather than inpatient hospitalizations 
by implementing several policies such as payment 
denials, rate modifications, and additional regulatory 
levers.3-5  In this setting, the annual prevalence of obser-
vation stays among Medicare beneficiaries increased 
dramatically to over one million visits a year by 2009.6 
7 
 
By 2013, approximately 1.5 million Medicare beneficia-
ries received observation services on a yearly basis.2 See 
box 1 for greater detail on the Medicare program and its 
policies regarding observation stays. A patient may 
receive care during an observation stay in the USA for 
the purposes of clinical observation or if higher pay-
ment for inpatient care is not anticipated. As a result, 
observation stays do not always reflect the clinical need 
for inpatient hospital care as they might in other coun-
tries but are rather an unanticipated result of financial 
incentives.

2
While observation stays have grown in importance 
for the care of people aged 65 years or over, our under-
standing of outcomes after discharge from observation 
services remains limited. Previous studies of post-hos-
pital outcomes have examined a small number of con-
ditions treated during observation stays, such as chest 
pain13-16  and heart failure,17  or were based on estimates 
from a small number of hospitals that may not be 
broadly generalizable.13 18 19  In contrast, studies utiliz-
ing large nationally representative databases that 
describe the range of conditions treated using observa-
tion services have not included information on out-
comes after discharge.6 20 21  This gap in knowledge 
about observation stays contrasts with the extensive 
literature describing outcomes after discharge from 
emergency department treatment-and-discharge stays 
and inpatient stays.22-25  As a result, outstanding 
 
questions remain about rates of occurrence of hospital 
revisits, including emergency department treat-
ment-and-discharge stays, repeat observation stays, 
inpatient stays, and any hospital revisit after discharge 
from index observation stays; rates of occurrence of 
death after discharge from index observation stays; 
potential differences in revisit and mortality outcomes 
after discharge from index observation stays compared 
with outcomes after discharge from index emergency 
department treatment-and-discharge stays and index 
inpatient stays; and changes in outcomes over time. 
These estimates are critical to understanding the vul-
nerabilities experienced by patients after discharge 
form observation services and can guide the design of 
hospital and health system transitional care interven-
tions to mitigate these risks. These data can also help 
benchmark quality improvement efforts and contribute 
to the development of quality metrics that measure and 
report outcomes after discharge from observation stays 
in parallel with metrics for patients discharged from 
emergency departments26 
27  and inpatient care.28
To estimate revisit and mortality outcomes after dis-
charge from index observation stays in the USA, we 
examined a nationally representative sample of Medi-
care fee for service beneficiaries aged 65 years and over 
receiving observation services from 2006-11. Medicare is 
the largest payer of healthcare for older adults in the 
USA,29  has actively stimulated greater use of observa-
tion services,3-5  and increased focus on post-hospital 
stay outcomes.30 31 Among Medicare beneficiaries, we 
characterized rates of emergency department treat-
ment-and-discharge stays, repeat observation stays, 
inpatient stays, any hospital revisit, and death within 
30 days of discharge from index observation stays. To 
contextualize these outcomes, we compared them with 
rates of emergency department treatment-and-dis-
charge stays, observation stays, inpatient stays, any 
hospital revisit, and death within 30 days of discharge 
from both index emergency department stays and index 
inpatient stays. We hypothesized that revisit rates and 
mortality after discharge from index observation stays 
would be intermediate between corresponding out-
comes after discharge from index emergency depart-
ment and inpatient stays.
Methods
Datasets
We used Standard Analytic Files for Medicare fee for 
service beneficiaries aged 65 years and over from 2006-
11 to examine index observation stays, emergency 
department treatment-and-discharge stays, inpatient 
stays, and associated outcomes within 30 days of dis-
charge. These datasets are produced on a yearly basis 
by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) 
and contain complete inpatient and outpatient admin-
istrative data for a representative 5% of Medicare fee for 
service beneficiaries.32 We identified enrollment status 
box 1: Descriptions of Medicare and observation stays
Medicare
Medicare is the USA federal health insurance program for people aged 65 and over, 
those with certain disabilities, or those with end stage renal disease requiring 
dialysis or renal transplant. Medicare is administered by the Centers for Medicare 
& Medicaid Services (CMS), which is a division of the US Department of Health & 
Human Services
Medicare is an entitlement program, and most Americans have the right to enroll in 
Medicare by working and paying taxes for a minimum required period. Medicare 
provides health insurance for approximately 50 million Americans and pays for 
approximately one half of US hospital inpatient costs. Approximately 70% of older 
Americans have traditional Medicare health insurance, or Medicare fee for service, 
while 30% have Medicare Advantage, a form of managed medical care in which health 
benefits are administered and managed by a private health insurance company
Beneficiaries with traditional Medicare health insurance generally have greater choice 
of providers at the expense of additional health costs from deductibles, co-payments, 
and co-insurance8

Observation stays
Observation stays are defined by CMS as a “well-defined set of specific, clinically 
appropriate services, which include ongoing short term treatment, assessment, and 
reassessment before a decision can be made regarding whether patients will require 
further treatment as hospital inpatients or if they are able to be discharged from the 
hospital.”
Observation stays are most commonly used for patients who are initially treated in an 
emergency department, though can be used in other circumstances, such as after 
selected outpatient procedures.
Observation stays can occur in multiple settings, including in a dedicated observation 
unit, in an emergency department, or on a hospital inpatient floor. Diagnostic tests, 
procedures, and other treatments are generally considered appropriate for 
observation stays when the treating provider expects the patient to remain in the 
hospital for less than 24 hours, or less than 48 hours under exceptional 
circumstances. In contrast, diagnostic tests, procedures, and other treatments are 
generally considered appropriate for inpatient hospital stays when the treating 
provider expects the patient to require a longer hospital stay
CMS pays hospital facilities for observation stays on an hourly basis under Medicare 
Part B, which covers outpatient services and supplies. In contrast, CMS pays for 
inpatient hospital stays under Medicare Part A using predetermined payments that 
are partly based on the medical condition responsible for the hospital stay
Observation stays are generally reimbursed less generously than inpatient stays. As a 
result, payers, including CMS, have progressively implemented several policies such 
as payment denials, rate modifications, and additional regulatory levers to encourage 
use of observation stays rather than inpatient hospital stays. As a result of these 
incentives, many short stays in hospital that were historically treated as inpatient 
hospital stays under Medicare Part A are now treated as outpatient observation stays 
under Medicare Part B.1

Patients receiving observation services may end up with higher medical bills, as 
Medicare does not cover the cost of routine maintenance drugs the hospital provides 
for the treatment of chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, nor does it 
cover the costs for follow-up care in a nursing home12

study cohorts
For our primary study population, we identified 
unscheduled observation stays using revenue center 
code 0762 or revenue center code 0760 in combination 
with Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System 
(HCPCS) code G0378. We included index observation 
stays of patients aged 65 years and over on the date of 
admission to observation services with at least 30 days 
of pre-observation enrollment in Medicare fee for ser-
vice and 30 days of post-discharge enrollment in Medi-
care fee for service in the absence of death. We excluded 
index observation stays resulting in death in hospital, 
observation stays resulting in transfer to another acute 
care facility, and observation stays resulting in dis-
charge against medical advice. Index observation stays 
resulting in inpatient admission were also excluded as 
these patients are largely considered to have first 
required inpatient hospital stays, and our aim was to 
examine post-hospital outcomes of people discharged 
after receipt of observation services.
For our comparator populations, we identified index 
emergency department treatment-and-discharge stays 
using revenue center codes 0450 to 0459 and 0981, as 
has been done previously.33 Inpatient stays were 
pre-identified in inpatient Standard Analytic Files. We 
included care episodes of patients aged 65 years and 
over on the date of admission with at least 30 days of 
pre-admission enrollment in Medicare fee for service 
and 30 days of post-discharge enrollment in Medicare 
fee for service in the absence of death. We excluded 
index emergency department treatment-and-discharge 
stays and inpatient stays resulting in death in hospital, 
transfer to another acute care facility, or discharge 
against medical advice.
In parallel with the disease specific readmission mea-
sures used by CMS to evaluate hospital readmission 
performance, we did not include 30 day revisits for the 
same type of event as the index event within study 
cohorts. For example, we did not include 30 day revisits 
for observation stays after an index observation stay in 
the observation stay cohort. We did, however, include 
30 day revisits for different categories of events com-
pared with the index event in their respective cohorts. 
For example, we included 30 day revisits for observa-
tion stays and inpatient stays after an emergency 
department treatment-and-discharge stay in our index 
cohorts of observation stays and inpatient stays, respec-
tively. We chose this approach since outcomes associ-
ated with revisits differ from outcomes associated with 
index stays.34 Exclusion of all revisits from index 
cohorts would therefore result in non-representative 
patient samples.
We restricted our analyses to Medicare fee for service 
beneficiaries aged 65 years and over because younger 
fee for service beneficiaries are a distinct population 
who qualify for early receipt of Medicare health insur-
ance due to disabilities. This population is more likely 
to be from racial and ethnic minority groups, be in fair 
or poor health, have low income and education levels, 
and live without a partner.35  This group is also more 
likely to report problems with access to care and more 
likely to experience both emergency department stays 
and inpatient stays.35
sample classification
We classified all index observation stays, emergency 
department treatment-and-discharge stays, and inpa-
tient stays by their principal discharge diagnoses. To do 
so, we utilized Clinical Classifications Software (CCS) 
from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 
that clusters more than 14 000 ICD-9-CM (international 
classification of diseases, ninth revision, clinical modi-
fication) diagnosis codes into 285 clinically meaningful, 
single level CCS categories.36  CCS grouping has been 
used previously with observation stays, emergency 
department treatment-and-discharge stays, and inpa-
tient stays.20

37-39
Outcomes
Our main outcomes measures were rates of emergency 
department treatment-and-discharge stays, repeat 
observation stays, inpatient stays, any hospital revisit, 
and death within 30 days of discharge from index obser-
vation stays. Rates were compared with corresponding 
outcomes within 30 days of discharge from both index 
emergency department stays and index inpatient stays.
To avoid double counting hospital revisits, we con-
sidered index emergency department stays that subse-
quently resulted in observation stays or inpatient stays 
to be index observation stays and inpatient stays, 
respectively. Similarly, we considered index observa-
tion stays that subsequently resulted in inpatient stays 
to be inpatient stays.
In addition, because emergency department admin-
istrative claims are often present concurrently with 
claims for observation stays, we conservatively did not 
consider overlapping emergency department claims 
present during an index observation stay or the day 
after an index observation stay to represent a separate 
emergency department stay.
statistical analysis
For each study year, we calculated descriptive statistics 
for age, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidities among index 
observation stays, emergency department treat-
ment-and-discharge stays, and inpatient stays. We 
tested for trend across study years using linear regres-
sion for continuous variables and logistic regression for 
categorical variables.
For both the entire study period and each study year, 
we calculated rates of emergency department treat-
ment-and-discharge stays, observation stays, inpatient 
stays, any hospital revisit, and death in the 30 days after 
discharge from index observation stays, emergency 
department treatment-and-discharge stays, and 
 
inpatient stays. We calculated confidence intervals for

these estimates using the exact binomial confidence 
interval.40  For all observation stays we assumed an 
admission time of 12 pm. We determined the day of dis-
charge by counting the total hours for which observa-
tion services were provided as reported in the service 
units field of the administrative data, as has been done 
previously.6 Using χ2 tests we compared revisit rates and 
mortality after index observation stays, emergency 
department treatment-and-discharge stays, and inpa-
tient stays.
All significance levels were two sided, with P<0.05 
considered to be significant. Analyses were conducted 
using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute). 
Patient involvement
Patients, service users, carers, or lay people were not 
directly involved in the design of this study. As this 
study concerned examination of existing administrative 
claims data of more than two million unique patients, 
no participants were specifically recruited for this anal-
ysis. The study’s focus on hospital revisit and mortality 
outcomes after index observation stays is consistent 
with the increasing focus on end results of healthcare 
rather than process measures or intermediate outcomes 
that do not directly result in benefits to patients.
Results
We included 363 037 index observation stays from 
278 530 unique patients, 2 540 000 index emergency 
department treatment-and-discharge stays from 
1 093 786 unique patients, and 2 667 525 index inpatient 
stays from 1 156 675 unique patients from 2006-11. Flow 
diagrams describing reasons for exclusion from each 
cohort are shown in supplementary figures 1A-C in the 
web appendix. Table 1  shows the characteristics of 
patients treated during index observation stays, emer-
gency department treatment-and-discharge stays, and 
inpatient stays. The average age, proportion female, 
and proportion white were similar among all three 
cohorts. Between 2006 and 2011, the number of index 
observation stays increased (P=0.01 for trend), the num-
ber of index emergency department treatment-and-dis-
charge stays remained the same (P=0.26 for trend), and 
the number of index inpatient stays decreased (P=0.01 
for trend) (table 1 ). In addition, between 2006 and 2011, 
increases were seen in the frequency of many chronic 
conditions in all three cohorts, including Alzheimer’s 
disease and related disorders, chronic kidney disease, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, 
and diabetes (table 1).
The most common conditions treated during index 
observation stays over the study period were non-spe-
cific chest pain (19.3%, 70 151 of 363 037 stays), syncope 
(5.2%, 18 717 of 363 037 stays), cardiac arrhythmias 
(4.2%, 15 213 of 363 037 stays), coronary atherosclerosis 
related diagnoses (4.2%, 15 193 of 363 037 stays), and 
fluid and electrolyte disorders (3.4%, 12 182 of 363 037 
stays). The most common conditions treated during 
index emergency department treatment-and-discharge 
stays were superficial injury (contusion) (6.6%, 167 882 
of 2 540 000 stays), non-specific chest pain (5.6%, 
142 874 of 2 540 000 stays), urinary tract infections 
(3.7%, 93 066 of 2 540 000 stays), abdominal pain (3.3%, 
85 047 of 2 540 000 stays), and sprains and strains 
(3.1%, 77 718 of 2 540 000 stays). The most common 
 
conditions treated during index inpatient stays were 
congestive heart failure (5.4%, 143 521 of 2 667 525 stays), 
pneumonia (5.1%, 135 792 of 2 667 525 stays), osteoar-
thritis (4.6%, 121 388 of 2 667 525 stays), cardiac arrhyth-
mias (4.1%, 108 188 of 2 667 525 stays), and septicemia 
(3.6%, 96 955 of 2 667 525 stays). Table 1 in the web 
appendix presents the 25 most common conditions 
treated during index observation stays, emergency 
department treatment-and-discharge stays, and inpa-
tient stays during the study period.
Outcomes after index observation stays
Major adverse outcomes were common in the 30 days 
after discharge from index observation stays. Averaged 
over the study period, 8.4% (95% confidence interval 
8.3% to 8.4%, 30 312 of 363 037 stays), 2.9% (2.9% to 
3.0%, 10 626 of 363 037 stays), and 11.2% (11.1% to 11.3%, 
40 491 of 363 037 stays) of index observation stays were 
followed by an emergency department treat-
ment-and-discharge stay, repeat observation stay, and 
inpatient stay within 30 days of discharge, respectively. 
The overall hospital revisit rate including all individual 
outcomes was 20.1% (19.9% to 20.2%, 72 802 of 363 037 
stays) within 30 days of discharge. In total, 49.7% 
(49.4% to 50.1%, 40 491 of 81 429 stays) of all hospital 
revisits were for inpatient stays (fig 1 ). The 30 day mor-
tality was 1.8% (1.8% to 1.9%, 6635 of 363 037 stays). 
Figure 2 shows 30 day outcomes after index observation 
stays that have been stratified by year. Over the study 
period from 2006-11, 30 day rates of emergency depart-
ment treatment-and-discharge stays, repeat observa-
tion stays, and any hospital revisit increased (P<0.001 
for trend for all outcomes; respective slopes 0.03 (95% 
confidence interval 0.02 to 0.03), 0.04 (0.03 to 0.05), and 
0.01 (0.01 to 0.02)), whereas the 30 day rate of inpatient 
stays was unchanged (P=0.054 for trend; slope −0.01 
(−0.01 to 0.00)). The 30 day mortality rate also did not 
change from 2006-11 (P=0.091 for trend; slope 0.01 
(−0.00 to 0.03)).
Outcomes after index emergency department 
treatment-and-discharge stays
Adverse outcomes were similar after index emergency 
department treatment-and-discharge stays. Averaged 
over the study period, 9.8% (95% confidence interval 
9.8% to 9.9%, 249 410 of 2 540 000 stays), 1.4% (1.4% to 
1.4%, 36 325 of 2 540 000 stays), and 10.6% (10.6% to 
10.7%, 269 765 of 2 540 000 stays) of index emergency 
department treatment-and-discharge stays were fol-
lowed by a repeat emergency department treat-
ment-and-discharge stay, observation stay, and 
inpatient stay within 30 days of discharge, respectively. 
The overall hospital revisit rate including all individual 
outcomes was 19.9% (19.8% to 19.9%, 504 418 of 
2 540 000 stays) within 30 days of discharge. Overall, 
48.6% (48.4% to 48.7%, 269 765 of 555 500 stays) of all 
hospital revisits were for inpatient stays (fig 1 ). The 30

day mortality was 1.8% (1.8% to 1.9%, 46 509 of 
2 540 000 stays). Over the study period from 2006-11, 30 
day rates of repeat emergency department treat-
ment-and-discharge stays, observation stays, and any 
hospital revisit increased (P<0.001 for trend for all out-
comes; slopes 0.01 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 
0.01), 0.08 (0.08 to 0.09), and 0.00 (0.00 to 0.01)) (fig 2 ), 
whereas the 30 day rate of inpatient stays decreased 
(P=0.001 for trend; slope −0.01 (−0.02 to −0.01)) (fig 2 ). 
The 30 day mortality increased from 2006-11 (P=0.002 
for trend; slope 0.01 (0.00 to 0.01)) (fig 2).
Outcomes after index inpatient stays
Adverse outcomes were highest after index inpatient 
stays. Averaged over the study period, 7
.3% (95% confi-
dence interval 7
.2% to 7
.3%, 193 887 of 2 667 525 stays), 
1.2% (1.2% to 1.2%, 32 851 of 2 667 525 stays), and 15.3% 
(15.3% to 15.4%, 409 288 of 2 667 525 stays), of index 
inpatient stays were followed by an emergency depart-
ment treatment-and-discharge stay, observation stay, 
and repeat inpatient stay within 30 days of discharge, 
respectively. The overall hospital revisit rate including 
all individual outcomes was 21.8% (21.8% to 21.9%, 
582 415 of 2 667 525 stays) within 30 days of discharge. 
Overall, 64.4% (64.2% to 64.5%, 409 288 of 636 026 
stays) of all hospital revisits were for inpatient stays (fig 
1 ). The 30 day mortality was 5.2% (5.1% to 5.2%, 137 737 
of 2 667 525 stays). Over the study period from 2006-11, 
30 day rates of emergency department treat-
ment-and-discharge stays, observation stays, and any 
hospital revisit increased (P<0.001 for trend for all out-
comes; slopes 0.02 (0.02 to 0.03), 0.10 (0.10 to 0.10), and 
0.01 (0.01 to 0.01) (fig 2 ), whereas the 30 day rate of 
repeat inpatient stays decreased (P=0.001 for trend;

ity also increased from 2006-11 (P=0.001 for trend; slope 
0.02 (0.02 to 0.02)) (fig 2).
Comparative outcomes
Rates of adverse outcomes were similar after discharge 
from index emergency department stays and index 
observation stays and highest after discharge from 
index inpatient stays. Averaged over the study period, 
30 day rates of any hospital revisit were 19.9% (504 418 
of 2 540 000 stays) and 20.1% (72 802 of 363 037 stays) 
after discharge from index emergency department stays 
and index observation stays, respectively, and 21.8% 
(582 415 of 2 667 525 stays) after discharge from index 
inpatient stays (differences between index emergency 
department and observation stays 0.2% (95% confi-
dence interval 0.1% to 0.3%), differences between index 
emergency department and inpatient stays 2.0% (1.9% 
to 2.0%), and differences between index observation 
and inpatient stays 1.8% (1.6% to 1.9%)). The proportion 
of all hospital revisits that were for inpatient stays was 
48.6% (269 765 of 555 500 stays) and 49.7% (40 491 of 
81 429 stays) after discharge from index emergency 
department stays and index observation stays, respec-
tively, and 64.4% (409 288 of 636 026 stays) after dis-
charge from index inpatient stays (differences between 
index emergency department and observation stays 
1.2% (95% confidence interval 0.8% to 1.5%), differ-
ences between index emergency department and inpa-
tient stays 15.8% (15.6% to 16.0%), and differences 
between index observation and inpatient stays 14.6% 
(14.3% to 15.0%)). Overall, 30 day rates of death were 
1.8% (46 509 of 2 540 000 stays) and 1.8% (6 635 of 
363 037 stays) after discharge from both index emer-
gency department stays and index observation stays 
and 5.2% (137 737 of 2 667 525 stays) after index inpatient 
stays (differences between index emergency depart-
ment and observation stays 0.0% (95% confidence 
interval −0.0% to 0.1%), differences between index 
emergency department and inpatient stays 3.3% (3.3% 
to 3.4%), and differences between index observation 
and inpatient stays 3.3% (3.3% to 3.4%)).
Trends over time in revisit outcomes were in most 
cases similar across care settings. For example, 30 day 
rates of emergency department treatment-and-dis-
charge stays, observation stays, and any hospital revisit 
increased over time after discharge from all three care 
settings (P<0.001 for trend for all). Similarly, rates of 
inpatient stays decreased after discharge from index 
emergency department stays and index inpatient stays 
(P<0.001 for trend for both). Rates of death increased 
after discharge from index emergency department treat-
ment-and-discharge stays (P=0.002 for trend) and index 
inpatient stays (P<0.001) but were unchanged after dis-
charge from index observation stays (P=0.091 for trend).
discussion
We found that one in five observation stays among 
Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and over in the 
USA is followed by a hospital revisit within 30 days of 
discharge. These revisits result in inpatient care in 50% 
of cases and are increasing over time as observation ser-

vices become more frequently used as an alternative to 
short stays in hospital.2

21  We also found that revisit 
and mortality rates after discharge from observation 
stays closely parallel outcomes after discharge from the 
emergency department. Taken together, these results 
suggest that older adults discharged from observation 
stays are vulnerable to major adverse events at rates 
that closely parallel emergency department discharges. 
Yet in contrast with both emergency department and 
hospital inpatient care,30 31 41 outcomes after observa-
tion services have not been a major focus for care 
improvement by clinicians, hospitals, or payers.
Our findings extend previous work describing the 
vulnerability experienced by patients discharged from 
observation stays. Firstly, we found that revisit rates 
among Medicare beneficiaries nationally are approxi-
mately 20% higher than expected when compared 
with the results of a previous study of 3509 consecu-
tively enrolled patients of all ages cared for in the ded-
icated observation unit of one academic center in 
2002.18  Although another study involving 340 older 
patients discharged after observation stays from 1996-
2000 found similar revisit rates to ours, the observa-
tion stays in this study were unlikely to be broadly 
representative, as they were purposefully sampled to 
include the same admitting diagnoses as in a compar-
ator group of patients who were younger.19  Secondly, 
we showed for the first time that 30 day revisit rates 
are increasing over time in tandem with the complex-
ity of patients receiving observation services, suggest-
ing that patients who are older and discharged from 
observation stays will continue to remain at risk for 
major adverse outcomes for the foreseeable future. 
Thirdly, we found that rates of adverse outcomes are 
similar after discharge from emergency department 
stays and observation stays. This result may surprise 
those who expect revisit and mortality rates after dis-
charge from observation services to be intermediate 
between corresponding revisit and mortality rates 
after discharge from emergency department and inpa-
tient stays. This finding may relate to our decision to 
categorize patients ultimately admitted for inpatient 
care after receipt of observation services as inpatient 
stays rather than observation stays. We did this inten-
tionally, as our aim was to determine outcomes after 
discharge from observation stays to better understand 
post-hospital vulnerability and the potential benefits 
of improved transitional care for this population. Our 
findings may also relate to the largely discretionary 
use of observation services in practice within and 
across hospitals.42 As a result, it may be that many 
patients treated and discharged after observation 
stays have similar illness acuity to patients discharged 
from the emergency department.
strengths and weaknesses of this study
This study has several strengths. Firstly, it utilized 
nationally representative Medicare data, which should 
result in generalizable estimates of revisit rates and 
mortality rates after discharge from observation stays. 
These estimates showed higher than expected revisit 
rates compared with previous work.18 Medicare data 
also permit robust outcomes assessment with no loss to 
follow-up, as Medicare is the payer for all older adults in 
the USA. Secondly, the study simultaneously examined 
multiple health outcomes over time for three different 
categories of index hospital stays, which afforded 
unique insights. For example, we found that revisit 
rates after discharge from observation stays are increas-
ing over time in tandem with the comorbidity burden of 
patients receiving observation services, suggesting that 
the rising use of observation stays as a substitute for 
short stays in hospital in the USA may further increase 
vulnerability in this population over time. We also 
found that revisit rates and mortality rates after dis-
charge from observation stays most closely resemble 
corresponding outcomes after discharge from the emer-
gency department; revisit rates and mortality rates after 
inpatient stays are considerably higher.
Results should also be interpreted in the context of 
several potential limitations. Firstly, data were 
restricted to adults aged 65 years and over, so results 
may not apply to patients who are younger and receiv-
ing observation services. However, older Americans 
experience more than one million observation stays 
each year,2  indicating that our findings have implica-
tions for a substantial number of patients. Outcomes 
after observation stays are also a topic of growing rele-
vance for European countries, including the UK, based 
on data showing that short periods of observation can 
improve patient satisfaction and triage decisions while 
reducing unnecessary short stays in hospital.43 44 
 
 
Organizations such as the National Health Service, Col-
lege of Emergency Medicine, Nuffield Trust, and other 
specialty societies have promoted the use of this treat-
ment strategy to improve outcomes and help tackle 
inpatient bed constraints.45-50  Indeed, the proportion 
of UK hospitals with observation wards has increased 
over time, with almost 50% of facilities reporting that 
they have a dedicated observation ward or clinical 
decision unit that is capable of seeing patients with a 
range of presenting conditions.46  Secondly, the study 
does not report other outcomes that may be important 
to patients who are older following observation stays, 
including symptoms, function, and quality of life, as 
this information is not available within the administra-
tive data used in our study. Administrative data also 
cannot identify the proportion of revisits that resulted 
from suboptimal quality of care, the exact location (eg, 
emergency department, dedicated hospital observa-
tion unit, or hospital inpatient setting) in which each 
observation stay occurred, or whether another type of 
admission (eg, emergency department treat-
ment-and-discharge stays or inpatient stays) would 
have produced better health outcomes. Thirdly, the 
study does not adjust revisit and mortality outcomes 
for case mix severity. In the USA, hospitals are under 
pressure to identify and code comorbidities for inpa-
tient stays, as patient complexity influences pay-
ment.51 52  In contrast, hospitals have little financial 
incentive to identify comorbidities for emergency 
department stays and observation stays.53 54 Adjust-

ment of post-discharge outcomes for patient comorbid-
ities could therefore introduce bias by making patients 
who require inpatient hospital stays appear particu-
larly sick due to the higher prevalence of coded comor-
bid conditions. Our unadjusted outcomes make clear 
that revisits after discharge from observation stays are 
common, frequently result in inpatient stays, and are 
increasing over time.
implications for clinical practice and research
Our findings have implications for clinical practice and 
research. Revisit rates of 20% after observation stays 
suggest that patients who are older and receiving obser-
vation services are vulnerable to major adverse out-
comes after discharge and may benefit from improved 
transitional and post-acute care. To date, focus on care 
transitions, post-hospital outpatient care, and corre-
sponding outcomes in the USA has largely been applied 
to vulnerable older adults discharged from inpatient 
stays23 
55-58  and to a smaller extent, emergency depart-
ment stays.22 34 41  Little attention has been directed to 
improving outcomes after observation services. Our 
results suggest that strategies designed to integrate care 
for patients after discharge from emergency department 
stays and inpatient stays, such as facilitating access to 
outpatientproviders,59  early and longitudinal fol-
low-up,56 60 61  timely transmittal of information from 
hospitals to outpatient teams,62  outpatient availability 
of care management services,62 63  multidisciplinary 
team based care,64 65  and home visits66  may also war-
rant consideration for patients after observation stays, 
as greater than 90% are discharged home.67 The poten-
tial importance of these strategies has likely grown over 
time as patient complexity and vulnerability have 
increased. Further research is needed to examine the 
utility of these interventions following discharge from 
observation services, as well as their prioritization. 
However, as revisit and mortality outcomes are most 
similar after discharge from emergency department 
stays and observation stays, application of lessons 
learnt from the emergency department context may be 
the most reasonable starting point. Research is also 
needed to better understand if observation stays should 
be an increasing focus of quality improvement for gov-
ernment. To answer this question, data are needed on 
the variability in observation stay outcomes across hos-
pitals and a better understanding of how suboptimal 
transitional and post-acute care may be contributing to 
revisit rates.
Conclusions
Hospital revisits are common in the month after dis-
charge from observation stays, frequently result in 
inpatient hospitalizations, and are increasing over 
time among American Medicare beneficiaries. While 
outcomes after discharge from emergency department 
stays and hospital inpatient stays have been a focus of 
clinical care, policy, and research, parallel outcomes 
after discharge observation stays have received little 
attention. As observation stays become increasingly 
used as an alternative to short stay hospitalizations, 
further awareness of the quality of care and results 
associated with observation services may identify 
opportunities to improve outcomes for patients.
