ABSTRACT 
 
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a five-week lower limb 
unilateral or bilateral strength programme on measures of strength, sprinting and change of 
direction speed.  
 
Eighteen academy rugby players (18.1 ± 0.5 years, 97.4 ± 11.3 kg, 183.7 ± 11.3 cm) 
were randomly assigned to either a unilateral (UNI) or bilateral (BI) group. The UNI group 
squatted exclusively with the rear elevated split squat (RESS), whereas the BI group trained 
only with the bilateral back squat (BS). Both groups trained at a relative percentage of the 
respective one repetition max (1RM) twice weekly over a five-week period. Subjects were 
assessed at baseline and post-intervention for 1RM BS, 1RM RESS, 10 m sprint, 40 m sprint 
and Pro agility. 
 
There was a significant main effect of time for 1RM BS (F(1,16) = 86.5, p < 0.001), ES 
(0.84< Cohen d< 0.92), 1RM RESS  (F(1,16) = 133.0, p < 0.001) ES (0.89< Cohen d <0.94). 
40m sprint (F(1,16) = 14.4, p = 0.002) ES (0.47<Cohen d<0.67) and Pro-Agility (F(1,16) = 55.9, 
p < 0.001), ES (0.77<Cohen d< 0.89), but not 10m sprints (F(1,16) = 2.69, p = 0.121), ES  
(0.14<Cohen d <0.38). No significant interactions between group and time were observed for 
any of the dependant variables. This is the first study to suggest that BI and UNI training 
interventions may be equally efficacious in improving measures of lower body strength, 40m 
speed, and change of direction in academy level rugby players.

 INTRODUCTION 
 
 
In recent years the use of unilateral (UNI) exercises such as the lunge, step-up, split 
squat and rear elevated split squat (RESS) have become popular in strength and conditioning 
practice21. UNI exercises are regularly included within strength programmes as assistance 
exercises to bilateral exercises (BI) such as the back squat (BS), typically implemented to 
increase volume load or provide variation. There are many examples of UNI exercises31 
being utilised in strength and conditioning programmes yet there is little evidence of their 
efficacy with trained individuals. 
 
Improvements in strength and power through the use of BI exercises such as the BS 
are well established6, 8, and are often selected as the primary exercise for this purpose. For 
example, one study reported significant improvements in 40 m running velocity, 
countermovement and squat jump performance in junior level footballers after 8 weeks of 
twice-weekly BS6. Similarly, Comfort Haigh, and Matthews (2012)8 reported concomitant 
improvements in BS strength and sprint performance over 5 and 10 m, following 8 weeks of 
resistance training in professional rugby league players. One study has also suggested that 
long-term strength training with the BS or front squat may improve change of direction 
performance in junior footballers17. 
 
The BS is performed with a two-leg support, but many athletic skills such as sprinting, 
jumping and changing direction are performed either unilaterally, or with weight transferred 
to one leg at a time. It could be speculated that UNI exercises are preferable in improving 
some aspects of physical performance compared to the BS due to greater specificity, which 
refers to the degree of similarity between training exercises and athletic performance.

 Specificity is an important principle in training programme design, with both researchers and 
practitioners attempting to maximize transfer between training and competitive 
performance33.It is also considered that greater similarities between training exercises and 
physical performance variables are more likely to maximize transfer effects3.  This idea is 
consistent with previous research, for example one study found that 8 weeks of plyometric 
training including unilateral exercises induced significant improvements to 10m time24.  
Furthermore a 9-week sprint and plyometric program including both unilateral and horizontal 
exercises improve sprint performance over 10m significantly more than sprinting alone11 
 
Practitioners often include UNI exercises as part of a comprehensive strength 
programme based on this rationale, however such a contention is purely speculative. 
Research to date investigating UNI training interventions on measures of strength and power 
demonstrate tenuous external validity, primarily due to the use of untrained individuals22. For 
example one study compared the effects of an 8-week RESS and BS protocol on several 
aspects of strength and power in untrained individuals and reported significant improvements 
in lower limb strength with little difference between groups22. Although it was suggested that 
UNI and BI training were equally effective in improving lower body strength, practitioners 
should be cautious in applying these findings to trained populations. .Previous studies 
investigating the acute responses to UNI exercises in trained individuals suggest comparable 
muscle activity and hormonal fluctuations between BI and UNI exericses16, reduced torso 
angle and greater activation of the gluteus medius23 in UNI compared to BI exercises, 
however the practical implications of these findings are not clear. 
 
 Further theory supporting unilateral training may be explained by the Bilateral deficit 
(BLD), which states that simultaneous BI contractions produces lesser force compared to the

 summed identical UNI contractions25.The BLD has been observed in jumping activities4, and 
the leg extension9. Authors cite a reduced neural drive as the mechanism. This early research 
may suggest that performing exercises unilaterally could produce favorable adaptations to 
unilateral strength as more force may be produced unilateral, which may impact unilateral 
activities. A previous study found that training with UNI exercises may be more effective than BI 
exercises for improving unilateral vertical jumping performance22, however this has not yet been 
investigated in trained athletes 
 
In order for practitioners to consider UNI exercises as a viable option for developing 
lower body strength in trained athletes, more longitudinal data are required investigating the 
responses of trained individuals to UNI versus BI training interventions. Due to the 
aforementioned limitations in the existing literature, the purpose of this study was to compare 
the effects of BI and UNI training on lower body strength, sprinting and change of direction 
speed (COD) in trained rugby union players. It was hypothesized that the effects of UNI and 
BI training would be similar in improving lower body strength compared to pre-training. It 
was also hypothesized that UNI training would be more effective than BI training in 
improving 10 m, 40 m and change of direction speed. 
 
  
METHODS 
 
Experimental approach to the problem 
 
To test the main hypothesis, that UNI training would significantly increase lower limb 
strength as much as BI training, a 2 x 2 mixed design was used. The within subject factor was 
time at two levels (pre and post) and the between subject factor was grouped at two levels;

 unilateral (UNI), and bilateral (BI). The UNI group squatted exclusively with the RESS, 
while the BI group squatted exclusively with the BS twice weekly for a period of five weeks. 
Participants were tested before and after the 5-week intervention period to determine any 
changes in the dependent variables, including 10 and 40 m sprint, Pro-agility, one repetition 
max (1RM) max BS and 1RM RESS squat. 
 
Subjects 
 
Eighteen healthy academy rugby players (18.1 ± 0.5 years, 97.4 ± 11.3 kg, 183.7 ± 
11.3 cm), with at least one year of resistance training experience volunteered to participate in 
this study. All participants were engaged in a structured strength and conditioning 
programme and were familiar with the RESS and BS. Prior to any data collection, all 
participants provided written informed consent, which was reviewed by the Edinburgh 
University Ethics Committee, and participants under the age of 18 were also required to 
obtain parental consent. Criteria for exclusion consisted of; participants with less than one 
year resistance training experience, evidence of orthopedic or lower limb injuries, or 
heart/circulatory conditions. Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental (UNI) 
or control (BI) group (Table 1). Subjects in the UNI group were not significantly different to 
the BI group in terms of age, height, weight, relative strength ratio or training history (p 
>0.05), and there was 93% training attendance in the UNI group and 92% in the BI group.

Experimental Procedures 
 
Testing 
 
Prior to baseline testing, participants were given a three-week instructional period, consisting 
of 6 sessions to learn correct technique in the RESS and BS. Participants were encouraged to 
increase the load on a weekly basis using an auto-regulatory progressive pattern19.  
Familiarisation of 10m, 40m, and Pro-agility tests were well established, as participants 
undertake these tests as part of routine performance testing at least four times per year.

 Upon completion of familiarisation, participants were required to attend two testing 
sessions separated by three days. During the first session, information on stature (Leicester 
stadiometer, Invicta Plastics Ltd, U.K.) and bodyweight was obtained (Avery Berkel 33/448, 
W & T Ltd., U.K.). Participants completed a ten minute standardized warm-up consisting of 
dynamic bodyweight exercises, gradually increasing in intensity. Participants then performed 
two 40 m sprints, where the best 10m and 40m split times were obtained (Brower Timing 
Systems, Draper, UT), which have been reported as reliable and valid measures of speed32. 
 
In order to train at a relative percentage of maximum values for RESS, participants 
completed a 3RM RESS on both legs, with self-selected dominant leg used for statistical 
analysis21. RESS were performed within a power rack with safety pins set at hip height to 
allow participants to fail safely within the rack by dropping the weight on the pins. While 
performing the RESS, the foot of the non-exercising leg was placed on a 40 cm support box 
to ensure the exercising leg was independently performing the movement. RESS and BS 
depth were standardized to an angle of 100° between femur and tibia26.Previous research has 
found that the UNI squat can be measured with high reliability21. Subjects were tested twice, 
separated by 48 hours to determine 3RM as seen in previous research21 Intraclass correlation 
coefficients were recorded. Differences between pre- and post-test measures were determined 
by the paired-sample t-test. The 3RM test was found to be reliable, ICC=0.98, there was no 
difference between the first and second trial (p=0.17). 
  
Three days later participants completed three repetitions of the Pro-agility test 
following the standardised warm up. The Pro-agility has shown high test-retest reliability as a 
measure of change of direction speed (CODS) in active individuals32. Markers were placed at 
0, 5 and 10 yards with timing gates on the 5-yard line, to indicate where participants start and 
finish. Participants began in a neutral 3-point position with feet either side of the midline,

 participants then turned and ran five yards to the right side and touched the line with the right 
hand, and then ran 10 yards to the left, touched the line with their left hand the ran back 
through the start line to the finish. The trial was then completed in the other direction, with a 
3rd trial completed off the preferred foot. The fastest trial was recorded. 
 
 Thirty minutes later, a 3RM test on the BS was performed, where depth was 
standardized to a degree of 100° between femur and tibia in accordance with recommended 
full squat guidelines outlined in previous studies26. For both lifts, depth was assessed using a 
video camera (Sony HDR-AS100VR Action Camera, UK) placed side-on to the participant. 
BS depth was judged retrospectively, and if participants failed to achieve the correct depth, 
testing was repeated 48 hours later. Prior to the 3RM testing in both groups, sets of 5-10 
repetitions with a self-selected weight on the first set with a 1-minute recovery period was 
completed, followed by one set of 5 repetitions having increased the load by 10-20% as seen 
in previous studies22. Three minute recovery periods were allocated between each successive 
set. Participants had a limit of 5 trials (including the warm-up sets) to attain the 3RM, as 
prescribed in previous research22. The 1RM was then extrapolated using a prediction formula, 
which is a commonly used method to determine 1RM5. This testing protocol was 
subsequently replicated post intervention on the 6th week.  
 
Testing Conditions 
 
The testing environment remained consistent from pre to post test, as did the order of 
testing, warm up procedures and participant’s footwear. Procedures were also completed at 
the same time of day to avoid circadian fluctuations, and adequate recovery from any 
previous training and/or competition was allowed. There was a three day rest period between

 initial testing and the intervention and a three day rest period between the end of the training 
intervention and post testing. 
 
 
Training Intervention 
 
Participants completed a five-week strength training intervention, consisting of two 
fully supervised training sessions per week, with BS and RESS depth standardised to the 
testing conditions. In the UNI group, researchers observed the lead leg and the barbell for 
correct technique. If posterior displacement of the barbell occurred on descent with no 
anterior movement of the knee joint, the lift was deemed unsuccessful due to weight 
distribution in the non-exercising leg21 .Subjects repeated the missed rep but were only given 
one additional attempt to complete repetition correctly. Intensity was standardised across 
groups using the same relative intensity at a percentage of 1RM in each exercise22 and the 
UNI group trained both legs at a percentage of  1RM. Participants followed the same 
prescribed loading pattern over the five-week period. The highest prescribed volume and 
lowest intensity occurred during week 1, whereas the lowest prescribed volume and highest 
intensity occurred during week 5 (Table 2). Tempo was also standardised across groups by 
encouraging the use of a 2-0-1, whereby the concentric and eccentric phases are completed in 
one and two seconds respectively, with no pause between phases26. This tempo rather than a 
fast concentric phase was chosen to reduce shear and compressive related forces26 Three 
minutes of rest was allocated between each set, and training days were separated by 72 hours 
to ensure sufficient recovery between sessions. No additional lower limb strength exercises 
were performed during the intervention period. Both the control and experimental group 
participated in two skills sessions, two rugby sessions and one game per week.

Statistical Analysis 
 
Data are presented as mean (M) ± standard deviation (SD) and were screened for 
normality and homogeneity of variance using the Wilks-Shapiro and Levene’s test 
respectively. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with mixed design were used to 
examine any differences in each performance variables, within and between groups, before 
and after the training period. Significant effects for time and interaction effects (condition x 
time) were measured using the Wilks Lambda test. Significance was accepted at p<0.05, and 
Effect sizes were assessed using partial eta squared (partial η2) values which were square-
rooted to give correlation coefficients that were compared with the effect sizes given by 
Hopkins; 0.1-0.3 as small, 0.3-0.5 as moderate, 0.5-0.7 as large and 0.7-0.9 as very large8

RESULTS 
 
There was a significant main effect of time for 1RM BS (F(1,16) = 86.5, p < 0.001), ES 
(0.84< Cohen d< 0.92). 1RM RESS  (F(1,16) = 133.0, p < 0.001) ES (0.89< Cohen d <0.94); 
40 m sprint (F(1,16) = 14.4, p = 0.002) ES (0.47<Cohen d<0.67); and pro-agility (F(1,16) = 55.9, 
p < 0.001), ES (0.77<Cohen d< 0.89), but not 10m sprints (F(1,16) = 2.69, p = 0.121), ES  
(0.14<Cohen d <0.38). Differences in 1RM BS pre- to post-intervention are shown in Figure 
1.0 and differences in 10m, 40m, pro-agility and 1RM RESS squat (pre-post) are shown in 
Table 3. No significant interactions were observed between any of the dependant variables.

DISCUSSION 
 
 
The primary finding of the current study was that UNI and BI training were equally 
effective in improving lower body strength. There was a large effect size reported for Back 
Squat ES (0.84< Cohen d< 0.92). Similar Improvements were also observed in 40m between 
groups ES (0.47< Cohen d < 0.68) and Pro-Agility ES (0.78< Cohen d < 0.88). This is in 
contrast to the hypothesis that UNI training would be more effective in enhancing 10m, 40m 
and change of direction speed. 
 
Lower body strength 
 
 
The data in the current study suggests that BI and UNI training exert reciprocal 
benefits to UNI and BI strength, with increases of 5.7 ± 3.8 % and 5.0 ±3.7 % in BS 1RM in 
the UNI and BI groups respectively. RESS 1RM strength also improved by 9.2 ± 2.1% and 
10.5 ± 3.2% in the UNI and BI groups. These findings are in agreement with our hypothesis 
that UNI and BI training would be equally effective for improving lower body strength, and 
somewhat in agreement with previous literature22. McCurdy et al. (2005) reported similar 
improvements in BI and UNI strength, in untrained individuals. The present study suggests 
this may also be the case in academy level rugby players, indicating some degree of external 
validity in applying these results to athletic groups.

At this stage we cannot draw any conclusions regarding the physiological mechanism 
that would explain the findings in the present study. Previous research has found that muscle 
activity is comparable between the RESS and BS when relative intensities are matched16, 
specifically in the lower back, hamstring, gluteals and quadriceps which may indicate that the 
amount of neuromuscular activity required for both exercises is the same and therefore 
strength adaptations are similar. However, research by Mccurdy et al (2010) reported 
increased EMG activity in gluteus medius and hamstring during the RESS, but increased 
quadriceps activity in the BS23. The authors attributed these findings to the relative instability 
of the RESS in comparison to the BS, however the subjects were female so results may differ 
with male athletes, the subjects in this study also had less experience using the RESS and the 
discrepancies in muscle activity may be due to the novelty of the exercise. Antagonist activity 
is known to increase when new tasks are introduced12 in order to improve stability and 
safeguard against excessive forces 34. In the present study, this was addressed with a longer 
familiarisation period, however EMG recording was not available during this study therefore 
we may only speculate based on findings from previous research. Furthermore, as BI training 
improved UNI strength, this explanation seems unlikely, whereas the compatibility in muscle 
involvement may be responsible for the similarities in strength development between groups.  
 
Previous research has also found that both the UNI and BS produce similar post 
exercise testosterone16, which is a significant finding as an elevation in testosterone can have 
a positive effect on muscular strength development by increasing protein synthesis, lean body 
mass, and aiding in exercise recovery35, however it is unlikely that 5 weeks would have been 
a long enough time period for hypertrophy to occur.

10m  
 
No significant main effect for time in 10 m speed was observed, however there was a 
small effect size ES (0.14<Cohen d <0.38). This was surprising, as a previous study have 
demonstrated increases in maximal squat strength are associated with improvements in 10 m 
sprint time8. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis, which included 510 subjects, 85 effect sizes 
and 15 studies investigated the relationship between increases in lower body strength and 
transfer to sprint performance, and reported a significant correlation in lower body strength 
and sprint performance over short distances (< 20 m) 27. It is well established that peak 
ground reaction forces and impulse are strong determinants of sprint performance15, and 
based on this it was expected that an increase in force production would contribute to 
improved 10 m sprint times.  
 
The lack of a main effect may be explained by the short study period. Five weeks is a 
short duration to expect any substantial changes in sprinting performance. Practitioners 
maintain that athletes require a certain amount of time to be able to “use” new levels of 
strength and express them in a specific context 33. It is also possible that the lack of effect 
may be due to lag time. Lag time refers to the period of time in which a specific adaptation 
manifests itself, or the duration in which an athlete learns how to optimally express force1. It 
is possible that different training methods can produce lag times varying in duration, 
sometimes extending over months at a time 33. Furthermore, central to the concept of transfer

 of training is specificity, which states that the adaptations are specific to the nature of the 
training37, therefore a concurrent sprint training programme may have elicited further changes 
in 10m time. A speed programme was not provided during this time due to the stage of the 
season players were in and to isolate the effects of the resistance training programme on the 
performance variables. However, this is in contrast to 40m data below. Finally, it is possible 
that statistical power was insufficient to show this difference, resulting in a Type II statistical 
error. 
 
 
40m 
 
Moderate effect size was found for 40m time ES (0.47< Cohen d < 0.68), with no 
significant interaction between groups. This is in contrast to the hypothesis that UNI would 
be more effective in improving 40 m sprinting time compared to BI training. Data from this 
study are consistent with previous research, suggesting that improvements in lower limb 
strength transfers to enhanced sprinting performance8, 27.  
 
The current data also provides new information for practitioners regarding the 
effectiveness of UNI training and its transference to improved sprint performance. Based on 
the concept of specificity, it was hypothesized that training with the RESS would result in 
more pronounced improvements in sprinting performance compared to the BS. However, 
specificity is a complex concept that is determined by overload in specific criteria33. 
 
Siff and Verkoshansy (1998) suggest that the magnitude of training transfer depends 
on dynamic correspondence, whereby basic mechanics rather than outward appearances of

 training movements must replicate athletic skills. Additionally, for exercises to transfer 
successfully to athletic performance, exercises must overload specific parameters including 
the type of muscular action, force magnitude and direction, dynamics of effort and rate of 
force development (RFD) 30,33,37.  Sprinting is a complex athletic activity, requiring high 
levels of force, the ability to produce force during quick contact times, and exert force in the 
appropriate direction18,36. As improvements were observed in UNI and BI strength in both 
groups, it is likely that participants were able to exert greater peak ground reaction force 
(pGRF), impulse and RFD as a result of both training methods, however these parameters 
were not measured in this study. 
 
 
Pro - Agility 
This is the first study to compare the effects of UNI and BI training on measures of change of 
direction speed (CODS). In the pro-agility test, there was a large main effect size (0.78< 
Cohen d < 0.88). Participants improved by 1.74% ± 1.0% s and 1.9% ± 0.8% in the UNI and 
BI groups respectively. 
 
These results demonstrate that strength training is an appropriate means to improve 
CODS in a five-week period in trained rugby players. There is currently some disparity in the 
literature with regard to the effects of strength training on measures of CODS, partly as a 
result of different test designs and different strength-speed parameters. For example, a 
previous study reported significant improvements in sprint times and change of direction in 
the T test following 8 weeks of squat jump training with 30% and 80% of 1RM20. It has also 
been reported that strength training with either the front squat or BS over a period of two 
years significantly improves CODS performance of CODS in junior footballer players17.

 However, it should be noted that although the Pro-agility has reported high test-retest 
reliability 32 direct transfer into improved athletic performance cannot be assumed, as 
research has demonstrated that agility is a product of both physical and cognitive factors, 
including perceptual skills, decision making skills and pattern recognition 29. The ability of 
team sport athletes to “read and react” to game specific stimuli is an important variable 
associated with improved agility29. This study utilised a pre-planned change of direction test, 
creating some difficulty in deducing what the performance implications may be, but 
collectively, research suggests that aspects of improved strength and power may positively 
influence the physical factors associated with change of direction speed. 
 
Limitations 
 
In attempt to evenly match the total work, each group trained at a relative percentage 
of their respective 1RM, following the same sets and repetition scheme. A limitation of 
standardising the groups using intensity was that workload was difficult to evenly match 
between groups, as it would be assumed that load would be equally distributed between legs 
during the BS. It would also be assumed that 100% of the total load during the RESS is 
placed on the front foot. Through the use of EMG, UNI training may incur a higher relative 
workload compared to BI training; with previous data suggesting 85.1% of the total load is 
placed on the front foot during the RESS23. Inequalities in net joint torques between the right 
and left sides during the BS have also been demonstrated13. It was therefore difficult to 
accurately match total work due to biomechanical differences between the exercises.  
 
The intervention may have also been limited by the concurrent nature of training 
necessary for the participants involved, which included lower and upper-body resistance

 training. Participants were required to gain weight during this time, and reported average 
increases in bodyweight of 2.21kg ±0.49kg and 2.35kg ±0.80kg in the UNI and BI groups 
respectively. This may have confounded the results by negatively affecting 10 m speed, as 
acceleration is a product of force divided by mass18. Furthermore, the participants in this 
study were engaged in at least three rugby training sessions per week. Current evidence 
suggests that this approach may attenuate gains in muscle strength and power14, but the 
randomised design in the current study should have controlled for this as both groups 
participated in equal number of rugby sessions.  
 
Furthermore, improvements over a 5-week period may be indicative of early strength 
improvements, which are primarily a result of neural adaptations associated with skill 
learning, rather than changes in muscle cross sectional area 25
 , although we did observe some 
increases in body mass also. 5 weeks was the maximum study length that was permitted due 
to the player’s involvement in international competitions. 
 
A longer study length is required to clarify any chronic adaptations and longer-term 
benefits associated with UNI training. Future studies should attempt to investigate any 
chronic adaptations or long-term benefits associated with unilateral training, such as 
transferability to athletic skills, as well as the implications in preventing and/or managing 
injury. EMG and hormonal data would also provide valuable information on the 
physiological responses to each exercise modality. Further research could explore exercises 
other than the squat.

 Unilateral and bilateral training modalities appear equally effective in improving 
lower body strength, sprint, and CODS following 5 weeks of strength training with the RESS 
or BS in trained academy level rugby players who have initial strength levels comparable 
with other professional rugby union teams2  
 
 
Practical Applications 
 
This study was the first to compare the effects of UNI and BI training modalities on 
aspects of strength and power in Academy rugby players. From a practical perspective, these 
findings provide strength and conditioning practitioners with evidence that UNI squatting 
may be considered an effective alternative to BI methods during the initial stages of training. 
It could also offer additional benefits for non-assessed variables, including injury prevention 
given the prevalence of UNI movements during sport. Future work should explore the 
mechanisms and other UNI and BI exercises beyond squats.
