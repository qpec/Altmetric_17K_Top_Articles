Abstract
BACKGROUND—Repeated head trauma has been associated with risk of neurodegenerative 
diseases. Few studies have evaluated the long-term risk of neurodegenerative diseases in collision 
sports like football.
OBJECTIVE—To assess whether athletes who played American varsity high-school football 
between 1956 and 1970 have an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases later in life.
PATIENTS AND METHODS—We identified all male varsity football players between 1956 and 
1970 in the public high schools of Rochester, Minnesota, compared to non-football-playing male 
varsity swimmers, wrestlers or basketball players. Using the records-linkage system of the 
Rochester Epidemiology Project, we ascertained the incidence of late-life neurodegenerative 
diseases: dementia, parkinsonism, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We also recorded medical 
record-documented head trauma during high school years.
RESULTS—We identified 296 varsity football players and 190 athletes engaging in other sports. 
Football players had an increased risk of medically documented head trauma, especially if they 
played football for more than one year. Compared to non-football athletes, football players did not 
have an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease overall, nor the individual conditions of 
dementia, parkinsonism, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
CONCLUSION—In this community based study, varsity high school football players from 1956 
to 1970 did not have an increased risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases compared with

 athletes engaged in other varsity sports. This was from an era where there was a generally 
nihilistic view of concussion dangers, less protective equipment and without prohibition of 
spearing (head-first tackling). However, size and strength of players from prior eras may not be

INTRODUCTION
For more than a century, head trauma has been linked to subsequent risks of 
neurodegenerative disease later in life1 and, specifically, dementia/Alzheimer’s disease,1 
Parkinson’s disease (PD)2 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).3 These conditions have 
been reported to be substantial among those engaged in contact sports.4 Recent publicity has 
focused on the dangers of American football, especially as played at the professional and 
college levels, with later risk of the dementia of chronic traumatic encephalopathy.5
Football is arguably America’s most popular sport and is played in nearly every high school. 
Football is a “collision” sport, where concussions commonly occur and where sub-
concussions may be routine, at least at college and professional levels.6 This may have 
implications for brain health later in life with theoretical risks for dementia or other 
neurodegenerative disorders. The importance of the topic has societal implications, with 
some authorities questioning the wisdom of youth football.7 On the other hand, high school 
sports have certain redeeming features, most notably the benefits of fitness training, which 
not only favors cardiovascular health but may also have a neuroprotective effect against later 
neurodegenerative diseases including dementia and Parkinson’s disease.8,9
We previously investigated long-term neurologic outcomes of a cohort of high school 
football players from 1946 to 1956 and found no increased risks of dementia, PD, or ALS, 
compared to non-football playing high school classmates or to the general population.10 The 
goal of the current study is to extend the investigations to another cohort of varsity high 
school football players from the next era, 1956 to 1970. This was a time when rules, 
regulations, and the physical ability of the football players were evolving to mirror more 
closely the present era. Still in this era, football-related concussions were often minimized or 
dismissed as “getting your bell rung.” In the current study, a cohort of high-school football 
players was compared to a cohort of non-football-playing, male high-school athletes 
(swimmers, basketball players, wrestlers) to assess the long-term neurologic outcomes of 
dementia, parkinsonism and ALS.
METHODS
Study design
This study design mirrored our previous investigation of a varsity high-school football 
cohort who played between 1946–1956.10 In the present study, we utilized the same 
methodology and reviewed all yearbooks of the two public high schools in the city of

 Rochester, Minnesota, between 1956 and 1970: Mayo High School and Rochester High 
School (now called John Marshall High School). All information contained in the yearbooks 
is in the public domain and was freely accessible at The History Center of Olmsted County, 
MN. We used these yearbooks to document the rosters of varsity football players plus the 
comparison-cohort of male high-school classmates playing varsity basketball, swimming or 
wrestling. The yearbooks contained relevant demographic information including sport and 
activity engagement. Soccer, tennis, boxing, and hockey were not consistently available 
sports during these study years, and female sports programs were not consistently offered in 
these schools.
We identified two different groups of male high-school athletes in the yearbooks: 1) 
Students who played varsity football; 2) Student-athletes who never played football but were 
varsity swimmers, basketball players or wrestlers. Athletes who played other sports in 
addition to football were included in the football group (Figure 1).
We utilized the records-linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), which 
provided access to the medical records of each included individual. The REP is a unique 
medical records-linkage system that encompasses the care delivered to all the residents of 
Olmsted County, Minnesota. Individuals visiting any of the county care providers generate 
records in the system. This is an active records-linkage system that spans from the early 
1900s to the present. Further details on the REP have been reported elsewhere.11,12,13 The 
REP includes a tool that allows searching for individuals on the basis of their names and the 
year of birth. We searched for each person on our compiled lists, using his full name and the 
approximate year of birth (assuming that students graduated at age 18+/−2 years) as in the 
previous study.10 The Institutional Review Boards of Mayo Clinic and Olmsted Medical 
Center approved the study.
We limited our cohort of subjects to individuals who had a constant and prolonged medical 
presence in the REP and received their medical care at the Mayo Clinic, Olmsted Medical 
Center or other Olmsted County facilities. We only included students with updated medical 
records to 2005 or later. We excluded students who had left the county or who did not have 
continuous evidence of medical records up to at least 2005 in the REP.
Neurological outcomes—We reviewed the entire medical record of each student and 
compared the long-term neurological outcomes of the football players with the non-football 
groups. We focused on the development of neurological diseases: parkinsonism; dementias 
of all types; ALS. We also abstracted medically documented head trauma.
We used a two-step process to abstract the medical records. First, we screened the electronic 
medical indexes of the records-linkage system using the REP tools. We reviewed each 
individual medical record, identifying dementia of any type, parkinsonism of any type, and 
ALS as well as medically-documented head trauma occurred in the athletes during the study 
period. Second, one of the researchers (PJ), unaware of the athletic group of the students 
(football players vs non–football players), reviewed the complete available medical charts of 
all those who ever received one of the diagnoses in order to confirm the electronic-based 
diagnosis.

 To determine the reliability of the clinical diagnosis of the abstractor, we compared his 
diagnoses with the diagnoses made by a senior neurologist (RS). There were no statistical 
differences between the diagnoses made by the neurologist and the diagnoses by the first 
abstractor.
Data analysis
Descriptive summaries were reported as frequencies and percentages for categorical 
variables. Our primary analysis compared whether any exposure to playing football (yes, no) 
was a predictor for developing neurodegenerative disorders. Secondary analysis examined 
football played more than one year versus no football, as well as students engaged only in 
football (primary sport) and students engaged in football plus other sports, (yes, no). 
Between-group comparisons were performed using Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The 
association between the exposure to playing football and the development of 
neurodegenerative diseases later in life was reported as an incidence rate ratio (IRR). IRR is 
a ratio of incidence rate among exposed to unexposed, where incidence rate is calculated as 
the number of events divided by person years of follow-up. Incidence rates were calculated 
using Poisson distribution due to rare events (i.e., fewer number of patients with 
neurodegenerative disease). All tests were two-sided, and p-values less than 0.05 were 
considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed by a statistician (JM) using 
SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
We identified 1,665 men from high-school yearbooks meeting criteria (1290, Rochester 
High School; 375, Mayo High School). Of this initial group, 1,253 were identified in the 
REP-browser (the others had no medical records or lack of correspondence with names). We 
excluded 752 students whom we could not match with certainty in the REP (common 
names, lack of first name, same year of age, etc.). The excluded students were equally 
distributed among all the sports considered (football, swimming, basketball, and wrestling). 
Another fifteen students were deceased before the age of 40 (n=15) and were excluded from 
the neurological outcome analyses. (None of the fifteen deceased had a diagnosis consistent 
with neurodegenerative diseases.)
Ultimately, we were able to successfully identify 486 high school athletes with sufficient 
medical documentation. This study cohort consisted of men aged 62 through 78 years at the 
time of the outcome analysis. Of these 486 high school athletes, 296 (61%) played football 
and most of these 296 football players played only football (253; 85%). Approximately half 
of this group, 153 students, played more than one year of football whereas 143 played only 
one year (Figure 1). The comparison group consisted of 190 varsity swimmers, basketball 
players or wrestlers.
Head trauma was documented in 48 athletes. This included 34 cases in the football group 
and 14 in the non-footballers. The median length of followup in our study (birth to death or 
last follow-up was 64.64 years IQR: 62.25, 68.73); thus each student was observed for about 
40 years after the participation in high school sports. Among all the high school athletes, we 
identified 14 cases of dementia/MCI (3 dementia and 11 MCI), 7 cases of parkinsonism, and

 no cases of ALS. Among students who had played football for one or more years there were 
2 cases of dementia, 5 cases of MCI, 3 of parkinsonism, and 0 cases of ALS. Among the 
non-football players (swimmers, basketball players, wrestlers) there was 1 case of dementia, 
4 cases of MCI, 3 of parkinsonism, and 0 cases of ALS (Table 1). In total, 10 of 296 varsity 
football players developed a neurodegenerative outcome (3%) whereas 8 of 190 non-football 
varsity athletes (4%) developed a neurodegenerative outcome.
When we compared the frequency of individual neurological disorders, we found no 
significant differences between varsity football players (ever-played) versus non-football 
athletes in any of the three neurodegenerative outcomes: dementia/MCI (IRR: 1.29; 95% 
Confidence Interval (CI): 0.45–2.32, p = .69); parkinsonism (IRR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.23–2.19, 
p= 1); ALS (no cases observed). Medically documented head trauma was significantly more 
frequent in the football players compared to the other athletes (IRR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.12–
2.26, p=.008).
In order to study more substantial, prolonged exposure to possible head trauma, we excluded 
all the students that played football for only one year and compared the football players with 
more than one year of football to the non-football athletes. Despite the presence of an 
increase in head trauma in the football group (IRR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.45–3.38, p= <.001), we 
did not observe any significant differences in neurodegenerative disorders between the two 
groups (Table 1–2).
DISCUSSION
Our cohort of high-school varsity football athletes playing between 1956 and 1970 did not 
have an overall increased risk of neurodegenerative outcomes, nor individual risks of 
dementia/MCI, parkinsonism, or ALS compared with non-football playing classmates. This 
was despite significantly more medically documented head trauma among the football 
players.
It should be noted that in this prior era, concussions tended to be overlooked; medical 
documentation of head trauma likely captured only the most severe cases. The potential 
implications of concussions were unrecognized and likely, many footballers played after 
having their “bell rung”. The concept of subconcussions6 had not yet surfaced.
The rationale for this investigation was based on a growing literature indicating that repeated 
head trauma/concussions may cause subsequent irreversible neurological conditions.14,15 
Early concerns were raised in the context of “dementia pugilistica”16 (or parkinsonism) as 
an outcome of boxing. Epidemiological studies have documented that a history of head 
trauma is associated with an increased later risk of dementia,1 Parkinson’s disease,8 and 
possibly ALS.17 Professional football players in the United States are at an increased risk of 
neurodegenerative diseases,18 and selected cases of dementia in the context of chronic 
traumatic encephalopathy have recently been publicized.5 Apparently, mortality due to 
neurodegenerative diseases among National Football League players is three times higher 
than that of the US general population; mortality from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and ALS is 
4 times higher.12

 The present study confirms previous findings among high-school football players from the 
same community in the prior decade (1946–1956): dementia, parkinsonism and ALS 
incidences were similar in the football versus the control group.10 Note, however, that high 
school football from the period between 1956 and 1970 was likely more similar to the 
present era, including body weight, athletic performance and equipment. Nonetheless, the 
helmets and football rules from 1956–1970 were not optimally designed to protect the 
athletes; only in 1980 did the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic 
Equipment (NOCSAE) implement the first football-helmet standards.20 Moreover, spearing 
(leading with the head when blocking or tackling) was not prohibited until 1976. The major 
causes of football-related death between 1945 and 1999 was brain injury (69%), and most 
fatalities occurred from 1965 to 1969.21 With the adoption of NOCSAE standards, fatalities 
decreased by 74%.12
In comparison to the high school football players analyzed in the prior decade (1946–
1956)10, high-school football players from 1956 to 1970 no longer used dog-ear or 
“leatherhead” helmets but rather more protective polyester helmets (Figure 2). However, 
helmets certainly do not eliminate concussions and may provide players with a false sense of 
protection, The 1956–1970 athletes were presumably bigger and generally more muscular 
than their 1946–1956 counterparts, whereas spearing was still allowed (i.e., striking with the 
head). Thus, better head protection could have had unintended consequences, making it 
ostensibly safer and less painful to strike opponents with the head.
This study should not be interpreted as evidence that football-related head trauma is benign. 
The literature on chronic traumatic encephalopathy among college and professional football 
players seems irrefutable, with reports of devastating outcomes. However, there may be a 
gradient of risk, with low potential among high school football players.
It should be noted that despite the mounting literature on the long-term consequences of 
head trauma in athletes, there are clear benefits of physical fitness on cardiovascular health 
and mortality.19 Indeed, studies have suggested a possible neuroprotective effect against 
neurodegenerative diseases, in particular dementia and Parkinson’s disease.8,9
Despite the merits of the study, there are a number of limitations. Unfortunately we were 
able to identify only 75% of students in our cohort using the REP, and in addition, we 
limited the definitive study population to the 30% for whom we have a prolonged medical 
record up to 2005. This could have led to selection bias; however, our method of case 
ascertainment was the same as we used in the previous study.10 In addition, we were unable 
to include information regarding the positions and the time spent on the field of the football 
players. Thus, we considered all players to be of equal likelihood to have been exposed to 
head trauma. We do not know whether any of the athletes continued to participate in contact 
sports after high school. A major limitation is the lack of power to detect the difference in 
neurodegenerative diseases between football players and non-football players (swimmers, 
basketball players or wrestlers). In fact, in order to obtain 809% of power we should need 
about 9000 students: our study is underpowered. Therefore, our findings should be 
interpreted cautiously.

 The goal of this investigation was to study high-school athletes, not college or professional 
football players. The intensity of the game and the size and speed of college and professional 
football players is not at all comparable to football at the high-school level. Current evidence 
clearly attests to chronic traumatic encephalopathy risk among at least some college and 
professional football players.5
Conclusions
Our study does not support an association between playing high school football between 
1956 and 1970 and risk of PD, dementia, and ALS. Additional studies are needed to explore 
more recent eras as well as involve players who participate at the collegiate and professional 
levels.
