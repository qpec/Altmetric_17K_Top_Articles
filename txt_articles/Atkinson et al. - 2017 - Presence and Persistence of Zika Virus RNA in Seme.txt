 Zika virus RNA has been detected in semen collected sev-
eral months after onset of symptoms of infection. Given 
the potential for sexual transmission of Zika virus and for 
serious fetal abnormalities resulting from infection during 
pregnancy, information regarding the persistence of Zika 
virus in semen is critical for advancing our understanding of 
potential risks. We tested serial semen samples from symp-
tomatic male patients in the United Kingdom who had a di-
agnosis of imported Zika virus infection. Among the initial 
semen samples from 23 patients, Zika virus RNA was de-
tected at high levels in 13 (56.5%) and was not detected in 
9 (39.1%); detection was indeterminate in 1 sample (4.4%). 
After symptomatic infection, a substantial proportion of men 
have detectable Zika virus RNA at high copy numbers in 
semen during early convalescence, suggesting high risk for 
sexual transmission. Viral RNA clearance times are not con-
sistent and can be prolonged.
Z
ika virus is an emerging flavivirus currently causing a 
major outbreak of human disease in the Americas, the 
Caribbean, and Western Pacific regions; 71 countries and 
territories have reported mosquitoborne transmission since 
2015 (1). Human infection can be subclinical (2). Symp-
tomatic infection usually causes a mild, self-limiting illness 
accompanied by rash, fever, arthralgia, and myalgia (2–5). 
However, international scientific consensus holds that Zika 
virus infection is a cause of 2 severe clinical sequelae rec-
ognized recently: Guillain-Barré syndrome and congenital 
neurologic abnormalities, including microcephaly (6). The 
risk for adverse obstetric outcome after maternal infection 
during pregnancy is currently unknown, but the risk for mi-
crocephaly attributable to Zika virus infection in the first 
trimester has been estimated to be 0.88%–13.2% (7).
Zika virus is primarily mosquitoborne, but sexual 
transmission has also been described (8–14). To date, 12 
countries have reported nonvectorborne transmission (1), 
usually sexual transmission from men after symptomatic 
infection, although transmission after asymptomatic infec-
tion also has been described (15,16). Sexual transmission 
is a major concern for pregnant women and couples con-
sidering pregnancy because of the risk for adverse fetal 
sequelae. Information on Zika virus persistence in semen 
is required to inform public health guidance for the preven-
tion of sexual transmission. With few exceptions (17,18), 
published data are mostly limited to individual case reports, 
and few publications report isolation of infectious Zika vi-
rus from semen. However, Zika virus RNA has been de-
tected in semen up to 6 months after onset of symptoms 
(19,20). This potential for prolonged onward transmission 
warrants further investigation. We describe the analysis of 
serial semen samples from 23 symptomatic Zika virus–in-
fected male travelers to determine the presence and persis-
tence of Zika virus RNA.
Methods
Testing of Diagnostic Samples
We diagnosed possible imported Zika virus infection in pa-
tients by using a real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-
PCR) assay based on a published method targeting the 
nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) gene (21) and a commercial 
serologic assay (EUROIMMUN AG, Lübeck, Germany). 
(We diagnosed infection in patient 1 by using a different 
rRT-PCR assay [22]). We performed viral RNA extraction 
on the EZ1 platform by using the EZ1 Virus Mini Kit with 
Buffer AVL (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) inactivated 
samples. We also tested all patients for other pathogens, 
such as chikungunya and dengue viruses, by using pub-
lished molecular and commercial serologic assays. The 
preferred sample type was serum or plasma, but published 
testing guidance specifically called for urine samples from 
pregnant women and male partners of pregnant women.
Testing of Semen Samples
We offered a Zika virus RNA semen testing service to 
adult male patients with diagnosed Zika virus infection. If 
Zika virus RNA was detected, we offered testing of serial

Results
Since December 2013, nearly 2,500 Zika virus diagnostic 
molecular detection tests have been performed on travelers 
returning to the United Kingdom with possible Zika virus 
infection. As of October 5, 2016, a total of 116 persons, 55 
of whom were males, had detectable Zika virus RNA in 
serum, plasma, or urine (23). Sixteen male patients (29.1%) 
submitted >1 semen sample (patients 1–16). In addition, 
7 patients (patients 17–23) submitted semen samples after 
serologic diagnoses (i.e., detection of Zika virus IgM and 
IgG in serum but without detection of Zika virus RNA).
All patients had recently traveled from the Americas 
or Caribbean, except patient 1, who acquired Zika virus in-
fection in the South Pacific in 2014. All patients reported a 
self-limiting, mild illness with fever and/or rash consistent 
with Zika virus infection (online Technical Appendix Ta-
bles 1 and 2, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/23/4/16-
1692-Techapp1.pdf). None reported hematospermia.
We detected Zika virus RNA in >1 semen sample from 
10 (62.5%) of the 16 patients with rRT-PCR–diagnosed 
infection and from 2 (28.6%) of the 7 patients with sero-
logically diagnosed infection. For the 10 patients who had 
a positive initial blood or urine sample and a subsequent 
positive semen sample, the median cycle threshold (Ct) val-
ue was significantly lower for semen samples (Ct 27.3) than 
for acute-phase diagnostic serum, plasma, or urine samples 
(Ct 34.1; p = 0.01 by sign test). 
Further semen samples were provided by 8 of the 12 
Zika virus–positive patients (Figure). A series of samples 
sufficient to demonstrate seminal clearance of Zika virus 
RNA was available for 4 patients (2,5,9,10). Patient 5 
demonstrated the longest time to clearance (from day 92 
to day 131). For other patients from whom additional pos-
itive semen samples were received, Ct values increased 
consistently over time (i.e., genome copy number fell). 
The day 167 semen sample of patient 8 repeatedly dem-
onstrated a subthreshold curve in the rRT-PCR test, sug-
gesting evidence of Zika virus RNA at the assay detection 
limit. This patient was taking immunosuppressive drug 
therapy when infected (disease-modifying antirheumatic 
drugs [discontinued after his diagnoses with Zika virus in-
fection] and oral steroids). No other patients were known 
to have immunosuppression.
Zika virus RNA was undetectable in semen samples 
from 5 of the 16 patients with rRT-PCR–diagnosed infec-
tion (31.3%); results were indeterminate (subthreshold) for 
1 patient (6.3%). All 6 patients subsequently seroconverted 
for Zika virus IgG (data not shown). The indeterminate result 
occurred in the only patient who had undergone a vasectomy 
(day 16 sample). Zika virus RNA was also undetectable in 
the semen of 5 (71.4%) of the 7 patients with serologically 
diagnosed infection. Although Zika virus infection was not 
definitively confirmed by molecular testing in any of these 
5 patients, laboratory tests excluded recent chikungunya or 
dengue infection (online Technical Appendix Table 2).

 Zika Virus RNA in Semen, UK
Of the 15 patients with rRT-PCR–confirmed infection 
in whom previous dengue serostatus could be assessed at 
the time of their initial Zika virus diagnosis (because no 
potentially cross-reactive Zika virus IgG was detectable at 
that time), only 3 had serologic evidence of previous den-
gue virus infection. Two of these patients (patients 3 and 6) 
did not have Zika virus RNA in subsequent semen samples 
(online Technical Appendix Table 1).
We attempted isolation of viable virus from all initial 
positive semen samples, with 1 successful isolation (day 
13 sample from patient 7, Ct 24). We attempted virus iso-
lation in Vero and C6/36 cells; we observed propagation 
only in C6/36 cells for the original sample, although C6/36 
infected supernatant was capable of infecting Vero cells 
and produced a cytopathic effect. We deposited the com-
plete genome for this isolate in GenBank (accession no. 
KX673530) (24).
Discussion
Although persistence of Zika virus in serum and plasma ap-
pears to be transient, our data show that Zika virus RNA is 
frequently detectable in semen for several weeks to months 
after recovery from symptomatic infection. Zika virus 
RNA persistence in semen is not consistent; 10 (43.5%) 
of the 23 patients we tested lacked detectable Zika virus 
RNA in semen on the first sample (all but 1 tested within 
28 days after symptom onset). Our detection of Zika vi-
rus RNA in early semen samples from 12 (52.2%) of 23 
infected patients is similar to the detection of viral RNA 
in 50% of case-patients in small-number Belgian (17) and 
French (18) series.
We observed no obvious differences in terms of age, 
travel history, or symptoms between the patients with and 
without Zika virus RNA in our series, although detailed 
clinical information about ethnic origin, symptom sever-
ity or duration, and laboratory parameters, such as plate-
let count or C-reactive protein, were not collected. Sample 
degradation probably could not explain the negative results 
because the time from sample collection to testing was 
shorter on average for negative samples than for samples 
yielding positive results (data not shown).
One patient with an indeterminate rRT-PCR result for 
his initial (day 16) semen sample was reported to have had 
a vasectomy; ongoing viral replication might have been 
occurring in the urogenital tract. A recent publication re-
ported Zika virus RNA in the ejaculate of a vasectomized 
man 96 days after onset of symptoms in addition to infec-
tious virus cultured at 69 days (25), suggesting that previ-
ous vasectomy does not necessarily preclude the possibility 
of viral RNA or infectious virions in the semen.
It has been hypothesized that previous dengue infection 
might drive greater Zika virus replication through the mech-
anism of antibody-dependent enhancement; this process has 
been observed in vitro (26,27). However, our data indicate 
that this process cannot be invoked as a potential sole expla-
nation for seeding of infection in the urogenital tract; among 
the 9 patients with Zika virus RNA in their semen for whom 
dengue serostatus at the time of Zika virus infection could 
be determined, only 1 (patient 10) had serologic evidence of 
previous dengue virus infection. Our data are insufficient to 
allow speculation as to whether an altered immune response 
associated with previous dengue infection might protect 
against viral replication in the male urogenital tract.
Among the 12 patients in whom Zika virus RNA was 
detected in semen, all samples obtained within 28 days of 
symptom onset had Ct values <30, indicative of high ge-
nome copy number. This observation is concordant with 
other reports (9,12,17,19,28–31) and suggests that the risk 
for sexual transmission is particularly high in the first few 
weeks after infection.
The specimens analyzed in this report were provided 
at the discretion of the patients, and the data are subject to 
limitations. Monitoring was inconsistent, and patients were 
lost to follow-up. Clearance of Zika virus RNA from semen 
was demonstrated for only 4 patients. In all other patients 
from whom serial Zika virus RNA–positive semen samples 
were received, the Ct value increased over time, consistent 
with a fall in genome copy number, as has been observed 
previously (12,17,30,32). The patient with an indeterminate 
(subthreshold) result at 167 days (patient 8) was receiving 
immunosuppressive therapy. Because Zika virus is the only 
known arbovirus with evidence for human sexual transmis-
sion, we cannot compare the persistence of Zika virus RNA 
or infectious virions in semen to similar viruses. Although 
the presence of Zika virus in semen is presumed to be at-
tributable to viral replication at an immunoprivileged site 
within the urogenital tract, the cell type in which replica-
tion occurs is not currently known. In a mouse model, viral 
RNA was detected in the testes, in spermatogonia, primary 
spermatocytes, and Sertoli cells (33)
Detection of Zika virus RNA in semen samples does 
not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus. 
We attempted in vitro isolation from all positive samples; 
only 1 sample (day 13 sample from patient 7, Ct 24) yield-
ed replicating virus. Isolation from samples with similar 
Ct values was unsuccessful, highlighting the inconsistency 
for this technique at present. The inability to isolate virus 
cannot be taken to indicate the absence of infectious virus 
until more is known about the intricacies of virus isola-
tion from semen. Although we have been unable to isolate 
virus in tissue culture consistently from semen samples, it 
is striking that all recognized transmission events to date 
have occurred relatively soon after infection in the male 
index patient (8–13,34). The longest published interval for 
sexual transmission after symptom onset is 32–41 days 
(14). Even if methodology for reliably isolating Zika virus

from semen samples is established, it will be difficult to 
determine whether semen samples with Zika virus RNA 
detected at lower copy numbers contain infectious virions.
The current World Health Organization (WHO) guide-
lines advise that male and female travelers should adopt 
safer sex practices or consider abstinence to reduce the risk 
for sexual transmission for 6 months after leaving a coun-
try with ongoing Zika virus transmission (35). This recom-
mendation was a conservative estimate for symptomatic 
men given the maximum reported persistence of Zika virus 
RNA in semen (62 days) at the time the WHO guidelines 
were issued (May 2016). Our data, together with other re-
cent case reports (12,18–20,25,32,36), show that Zika vi-
rus RNA is sometimes detectable beyond 62 days, with the 
maximum period of RNA detection observed to date being 
approximately 6 months (20). However, our understanding 
of the dynamics for virus or viral RNA clearance are still 
nascent, and further data are required to assess the validity 
of current recommendations.
Currently, we lack knowledge of viral persistence in 
semen. More data, especially from larger systematic stud-
ies, are urgently needed to support evidence-based policies 
to prevent sexual transmission of Zika virus. In the mean-
time, testing of semen from symptomatic men >8 weeks 
after leaving a Zika-affected area, as suggested by WHO 
(35), might be valuable for assessing individual risk and for 
contributing to global data.

EID SPOTLIGHT TOPIC
Zika virus
Zika virus is spread to people 
through mosquito bites. 
Outbreaks of Zika have occurred 
in areas of Africa, Southeast 
Asia, the Pacific Islands, and 
the Americas. Because the 
Aedes species of mosquitoes 
that spread Zika virus are found 
throughout the world, it is likely 
that outbreaks will spread to new 
countries. In May 2015, the Pan 
American Health Organization 
issued an alert regarding the first 
confirmed Zika virus infection in 
Brazil. In December 2015, Puerto 
Rico reported its first confirmed 
Zika virus case.
