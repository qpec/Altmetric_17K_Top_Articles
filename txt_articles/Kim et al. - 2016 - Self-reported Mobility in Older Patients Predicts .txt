Abstract
Background—Specific geriatric assessment tools may complement traditional perioperative risk 
stratification. Our aim was to evaluate whether self-reported mobility is predictive of postoperative 
outcomes in older patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery.
Methods—Patients ≥69 years of age (n=197) underwent: 1) traditional risk assessments 
(American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] Physical Status Classification and Revised Cardiac 
Risk Index [RCRI]), 2) 5-point frailty evaluation, 3) self-reported mobility assessment using the 
Mobility Assessment Tool-short form (MAT-sf) (range: 30.21 [poor]-69.76 [excellent]), and 4) 
measurements of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Outcomes were postoperative 
complications, time to discharge, and nursing home placement (NHP).

 Results—In our sample (mean age = 75 ± 5 years, 51% female), 72% had intermediate- or high-
risk surgery. Median time to discharge was 3 days (IQR: 1–4 days). Thirty patients (15%) 
developed postoperative complications, and 27 (13%) required NHP. After controlling for age, sex, 
body mass index, pain score, RCRI, ASA physical status, surgical risk, and hs-CRP, worse self-
reported mobility (per 10 point decrease in MAT-sf, which is equivalent to 1 standard deviation) 
was associated with more postoperative complications (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.05 – 2.73), later time 
to discharge (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 – 0.96), and increased NHP (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.13 – 3.56). 
Using the same model, intermediate frailty or frailty increased NHP (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.02–9.54), 
but was not related to either postoperative complications or time to discharge.
Conclusions—Preoperative self-reported mobility using a novel and brief assessment may help 
identify elderly patients at risk for adverse postoperative events.
Introduction
One-third of inpatient surgeries in the U.S. are performed in older adults and this number is 
expected to increase by approximately 40% by 2020.1 The elderly have a greater risk of 
postoperative adverse outcomes, longer hospital stays, and greater need for long-term care, 
all of which are costly.2–4
Among the traditional risk assessment tools used today are the American Society of 
Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification and the Revised Cardiac Risk Index 
(RCRI). The ASA physical status score is known to predict postoperative morbidity, 
mortality,5–10 and hospital length of stay.11 The RCRI remains a well-accepted method to 
identify patients for whom preoperative noninvasive cardiac testing is justified and may 
change the plan of care.12,13 Nonetheless, the use of RCRI is limited by inherent difficulties 
in accurate weighting of multiple risk factors with variable degrees of cause-and-effect 
linkage. Older patients often exhibit declining reserves in physiologic and physical function 
in multiple organ systems14 that might be overlooked by traditional preoperative risk 
assessment measures.
The American College of Surgeons (ACS) recently created the National Surgical Quality 
Improvement Program (NSQIP) surgical risk calculator to be used to predict a multitude of 
postoperative outcomes.15 While it was developed using a large aggregate of multi-
institutional data, the NSQIP calculator was not specifically validated in older surgical 
patients in whom geriatric syndromes are prevalent. One common geriatric syndrome is 
frailty, defined as a state of high vulnerability for adverse health outcomes, including 
disability, dependency, falls, need for long-term care, and mortality.16 A five-point frailty 
scoring system used to predict outcomes in older patients after noncardiac surgery appears to 
discriminate between low- and high-risk elderly surgical patients more effectively than 
traditional perioperative stratification tools such as the ASA physical status score and 
cardiac risk tools;17 however, adoption of frailty scoring in preoperative assessment practice 
has been slow.
Mobility is a powerful biomarker of the integrated health of multiple systems. Time to 
complete the Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) test, a performance-based assessment of mobility, 
accurately forecasts postoperative morbidity and mortality in older patients.18,19 However,

 such performance-based measures carry an inherent, albeit modest, risk of falls and injury 
and, more importantly, can be affected by transient states such as pain and acute illness, 
limiting their value in the preoperative setting.20
The novel Mobility Assessment Tool-short form (MAT-sf) presents patients with 10 
computer-generated animations that depict mobility tasks in different environments. Unlike 
other self-report tools, the MAT-sf eliminates complex judgments and contextual factors by 
asking the participant about their ability to do the task depicted in the animation.21 It has 
been validated against measures of physical function, including the Pepper Assessment Tool 
for Disability, the Short Physical Performance Battery, and 400-meter walk test among older 
community dwellers.21 Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that self-reported mobility using 
the MAT-sf would predict postoperative complications, time to discharge, and nursing home 
placement (NHP) after adjusting for traditional risk assessment scores and a biomarker of 
inflammation. We also compared the MAT-sf to a frailty score previously used in the 
preoperative setting.
Materials and Methods
Study Participants
In this prospective cohort study, we recruited patients ≥69 years of age referred for 
preoperative assessment before elective noncardiac surgery at our institution from July 2012 
to February 2014. Prospective participants were approached in the waiting room of the 
Preoperative Assessment Clinic (PAC) at Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston-Salem, North 
Carolina, which serves >70 patients per day. We excluded those scheduled for emergency, 
cardiac, or outpatient procedures, as well as those who required assistive devices to walk 4 
meters, had deficits in hearing or vision, or could not understand the MAT-sf questionnaires 
and directions. Of 261 eligible patients, 45 declined to participate (mean age 76; 68% 
female), leaving 216 who provided written informed consent (Institutional Review Board of 
Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina - approval number 
00019392l; 4/23/2012) before undergoing standardized assessments for frailty and mobility 
status by trained study personnel. Those with a duplicate enrollment, those who underwent 
ambulatory surgery without a hospital stay, and those whose surgery was cancelled were 
excluded from the analysis. The final cohort consisted of 197 individuals (Figure 1).
Study Assessments
For each patient, information regarding demographic characteristics, comorbidities, 
medications, pain scores, procedure type, and anesthesia time were gathered.
Mobility was assessed using the MAT-sf, which consists of 10 animated video clips of 
activities that span a wide range of functional capacity, including walking on level ground, a 
slow jog, walking outdoors on uneven terrain, walking up a ramp with and without using a 
handrail, stepping over hurdles, ascending and descending stairs with and without the use of 
a handrail, and climbing stairs while carrying bags. Items were selected based on individual 
response and information curves derived from Item Response Theory.21 Participants were 
asked to watch each animated video clip and then respond to a series of questions about their

 ability to perform each task (number of minutes, number of times, yes/no). The test was 
implemented using an iPad and scores were saved to an exportable, password-protected file. 
Scores on the MAT-sf range from 30.21 to 69.76, indicative of poor to excellent mobility in 
older adults. For example, participants with a mean age of 78.9 ±5.2 years in the LIFE 
Study20 scored a mean of 53.6 and SD of 8.0 on the MAT-sf. Their risk of major mobility 
disability after 3 years of follow-up was 22% for those with scores ≥60, 35% for those with 
scores 50–59, 52% for those with scores 40–49, and 66% for those with scores <40.
Frailty was assessed using the 5-point scale developed by Fried et al.,16 as modified by 
Makary and colleagues.17 Frailty was defined as the presence of 4 or more of the following 
5 criteria: shrinking (unintentional weight loss of 10 or more pounds in the previous year); 
weakness measured by a hand-held dynamometer (e.g., men met the criteria for weakness if 
their body mass index (BMI) and grip strength were ≤24 kg/m2 and ≤29 kg; 24.1–26 kg/m2 
and ≤30 kg; 26.1–28 kg/m2 and ≤31 kg; >28 kg/m2 and ≤32 kg, respectively; women met 
the criteria for weakness if their BMI and grip strength were 24 kg/m2 and ≤29 kg; 24.1–26 
kg/m2 and ≤30 kg; 26.1–28 kg/m2 and ≤31 kg; >28 kg/m2 and ≤32 kg, respectively); 
exhaustion (measured by responses to questions about effort and motivation); reduced 
physical activity (determined by asking about leisure time physical activities); and slow 
walking speed based on the time to walk 15 feet (e.g., men met criteria if height and walk 
time were ≤173 cm and ≥7 seconds, or >173 cm and ≥6 seconds, respectively; women met 
criteria if height and walk time were ≤159 cm and ≥7 seconds, or >159 cm and ≥6 seconds, 
respectively). Intermediate frailty was defined as the presence of 2 or 3 of the 5 criteria. 
Patients with 0 or 1 of the 5 criteria were defined as non-frail.
We also obtained baseline blood samples from all participants to measure high sensitivity C-
reactive protein (hs-CRP) as an indicator of inflammation.
Standard Preoperative Evaluations
All patients underwent a standard medical workup at the discretion of the PAC’s attending 
physician. This workup included the ASA Physical Status Classification and the RCRI.12
Study Outcomes
The primary outcomes of interest were postoperative complications within 30 days of the 
operation as defined by the ACS NSQIP,22 time to discharge (in days), and NHP. The 
postoperative surgical and medical complications included surgical site infection 
(superficial, deep, or organ-space), wound disruption, pneumonia, unplanned intubation, 
pulmonary embolism, on ventilator for more than 48 hours, progressive renal insufficiency 
or acute renal failure requiring dialysis, urinary tract infection, stroke, coma, cardiac arrest 
requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation, myocardial infarction, bleeding requiring 
transfusion, deep venous thrombosis requiring therapy, or sepsis.22 In addition to the NSQIP 
list of medical complications, we included delirium, as defined by the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-523 and atrial fibrillation. A complication was 
defined as present if it occurred during the initial hospital stay and was documented in the 
discharge summary. The presence of 1 or more complication was considered positive for 
postoperative complications.

 Sample Size
Because the expected degree of relationship of mobility/disability with postoperative 
outcomes was not known, the sample size was based on data previously published in the 
literature on estimates of postoperative complications in older patients, according to Dzankic 
et al.24 A formal a priori sample size calculation was not conducted.
Statistical Analysis
Patients’ demographic variables, comorbidities, preoperative pain scores, hs-CRP and results 
of the frailty scoring and MAT-sf were expressed as mean ±SD, median with interquartile 
range (IQR), or percentages as appropriate. Percentages of postoperative complications and 
NHP among patients with two frailty categories (non-frail, intermediately frail or frail) and 
mobility (best, mid, and worst tertiles of MAT-sf score) were compared using Chi-Square 
tests. Student’s t-test was used to compare log-transformed hospital LOS between two frailty 
categories and analysis of variance (ANOVA) between mobility tertiles. Logistic regression 
models were used to estimate odds ratios of postoperative complications and NHP, and Cox 
proportional hazard regression models were used to compare time to discharge for frailty 
status and MAT-sf (as a continuous variable).
For these models, three sets of analyses were performed: 1) unadjusted model: only frailty or 
MAT-sf included in the model; 2) traditional covariate-adjusted model plus hs-CRP: 
potential risk factors including age, sex, BMI, pain score, RCRI, ASA status, surgical risk, 
and hs-CRP were included in the model with either frailty or MAT-sf, but not both; and 3) 
fully adjusted model: similar to traditional covariate-adjusted plus hs-CRP model but with 
both frailty and MAT-sf included in the model to evaluate the improvement in model 
performance after adding the MAT-sf. The increase in the area under the curve (AUC) was 
calculated based on logistic regression models, where the AUC, as determined by the 
trapezoidal rule, was estimated by the concordance index. The receiver operating 
characteristics (ROC) comparisons were performed using a contrast matrix approach that 
enables the testing of differences of the areas under empirical ROC curves, as described in 
DeLong et al.25
For the univariate analysis, the MAT-sf was examined as tertiles and for the multivariate 
analyses it was treated as a continuous variable. All statistical analyses were done with SAS 
9.4 (Cary, NC) and a 2-tailed test with p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. The 
criterion for rejection of the null hypothesis was not adjusted for multiple comparisons.
Results
Participant Characteristics
A total of 197 patients undergoing elective non-cardiac surgical procedures were included. 
Our sample had a mean age of 75 years, was 51% female, predominantly white, and 72% 
were overweight or obese based on BMI (Table 1). Given that obesity is a proinflammatory 
state characterized by the release of inflammatory compounds including hs-CRP from 
visceral adipose tissue, it was not surprising to find a greater proportion of overweight and 
obese patients, e.g., 65 and 69%, respectively, with hs-CRP levels ≥ 1mg/L, when compared

 to patients with BMIs < 25 kg/m2; wherein 50% had elevated levels. With regard to 
traditional risk measures, 24% and 69% of the patients were deemed to be ASA physical 
status 2 and 3, respectively, and the majority fell within a RCRI class of 1 or 2. Sixty-seven 
patients (34%) were intermediately frail, while one patient (0.5%) was frail. Only 18% of 
the surgeries were considered low risk, with the remainder being either intermediate or high 
risk. The median anesthesia time was 198 minutes and the median MAT-sf score was 53 
(IQR = 46.4–61.1).
Univariate Analysis Results
Intermediate frailty or frailty was a significant risk factor for later discharge and NHP (Table 
2). The median time to discharge for non-frail patients was 2 (IQR, 1–4) days, while for 
intermediately frail or frail patients it was 3 (IQR, 1–5) days. Correspondingly, 8% of non-
frail patients were discharged to a nursing home while the rate for those considered to be 
either intermediately frail or frail was 25%. Interestingly, being intermediately frail or frail 
was unrelated to postoperative complications. In contrast, mobility limitation as 
characterized by worst (range: 30.2–47.70) and mid tertiles (range: 47.73–57.16) of the 
MAT-sf, as compared to the best tertile (range: 57.95–67.76), was a significant risk factor for 
all three postoperative outcomes (Appendix 1) including postoperative complications, later 
time to discharge, and NHP.
Multivariate Analysis Results
In the unadjusted model, intermediate frailty or frailty was a predictor of NHP, while worse 
mobility, defined by lower MAT-sf scores, significantly predicted higher postoperative 
complications, later time to discharge, and higher need for NHP (Table 3). After adjusting 
for traditional covariates including age, sex, BMI, pain score, RCRI, ASA physical status, 
and surgical risk, plus hs-CRP, intermediate frailty or frailty significantly predicted NHP but 
failed to associate with postoperative complications or time to discharge. In multivariate 
analyses with the same covariates, mobility based on the MAT-sf was a significant predictor 
of postoperative complications, time to discharge, and NHP. When both intermediate frailty 
or frailty and self-reported mobility were added to the model, intermediate frailty or frailty 
continued to be significant for only NHP (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.02–9.54). Poor self-reported 
mobility, as reflected by lower scores on the MAT-sf, remained significant in predicting 
more postoperative complications (OR 1.69 0 for every 10 point decrease in MAT-sf, which 
is equivalent to 1 standard deviation, 95% CI 1.05–2.73), later time to discharge (HR 0.81 
for every 10 point decrease in MAT-sf, 95% CI0.68–0.96), and an increased risk of being 
discharged to a nursing home (OR 2.01 for every 10 point decrease in MAT-sf, 95% CI 
1.13–3.56) (Table 3).
Besides the MAT-sf, no other variables were predictive of postoperative complications. In 
the fully adjusted model to predict hospital discharge (early hospital discharge), ASA 
physical status ≥3 (HR= 1.65, 95% CI 1.11–2.46), intermediate-risk or high-risk surgery 
(HR=2.83, 95% CI 1.84–4.36), and hs-CRP ≥1 mg/dL (HR=1.40, 95% CI 1.02–1.92)) were 
also significant. Age (OR=1.15, 95% CI 1.05–1.27), and preoperative pain scores (OR=0.83, 
95% CI 0.70–0.99) were significant predictors of NHP.

 Mobility and Predictive Power
We performed receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis to assess the ability of the 
models to predict postoperative complications and NHP. The ROC curves for the models 
predicting any complication based on frailty status or MAT-sf are presented in Figure 2A. 
The corresponding area under the curves (AUCs) for intermediate frailty or frailty and MAT-
sf were 0.7220 and 0.7623, respectively, with the difference of 0.0403 not statistically 
significant (P=0.77). The ROC curves for the models predicting NHP based on intermediate 
frailty or frailty and MAT-sf are presented in Figure 2B. The corresponding AUCs were 
0.8246 and 0.8441, respectively, with the difference of 0.0195 not statistically significant 
(P=0.53).
A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the importance of orthopedic- or pain-related 
limitations on postoperative complications, time to discharge and NHP in the 104 patients 
who underwent an orthopedic procedure, including hip, knee or spine surgery. In the 
univariate analysis, being intermediately frail or frail significantly associated with all three 
outcomes whereas worse self-reported mobility associated with postoperative complications 
and time to discharge (Appendix 2). The results of multivariate analyses were similar to 
Table 3. Specifically, in the unadjusted multivariate analysis, both frailty and mobility status 
among orthopedic patients significantly associated with all three outcomes. After adjusting 
for traditional covariates and hs-CRP, intermediate frailty or frailty remained significant for 
time to discharge (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.37 – 1.01, P=0.05) and NHP (OR 3.66, 95% 0.98 – 
13.67, P=0.05) while MAT-sf-based mobility remained significant for only postoperative 
complications (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 – 1.00, P<0.05). In the fully adjusted model, these 
associations were no longer significant, possibly due to a smaller sample size (Appendix 3). 
Among the orthopedic-only patients, ROCs were performed for predicting postoperative 
complications and NHP. The corresponding AUCs were similar to the AUCs involving all 
patients (Appendix 4).
Discussion
We evaluated traditional risk factors and geriatric-specific assessments, including mobility 
and frailty, prior to elective noncardiac surgery in a cohort of patients ≥69 years of age and 
found that self-reported mobility assessed by the MAT-sf was the only measure that 
consistently predicted early postoperative complications, time to discharge, and NHP. In 
keeping with previous studies,17,26,27 intermediate frailty (or frailty) was associated with 
NHP. However, there was no relationship between frailty scores and postoperative 
complications or time to discharge.
Preoperative assessment of participant characteristics that can assist in the evaluation of risk 
for adverse postoperative outcomes is important to patients, their families, and their 
surgeons. This information is even more important for the elderly, in whom postoperative 
complications are more likely. While the ASA physical status is very good at separating the 
perfectly healthy (ASA physical status 1) and the deathly ill (ASA physical status 5) from 
the rest of the surgical population and even the less than healthy (ASA physical status 2) 
from the critically ill (ASA physical status 4), it is less accurate for determining risk for 
patients with ASA physical status 3 (a common classification of those 65 years and older)

 because criteria for evaluation are comprehensive and may not always be limited to specific 
end-organ impairments. Other traditional, preoperative risk assessment measures focus on 
single organ systems as a predictor of perioperative outcomes, such as the cardiac and 
pulmonary systems.28,29 However, elderly patients develop geriatric-specific syndromes that 
involve multiple organ systems; declining function across multiple systems may be a 
significant risk factor for adverse postoperative outcomes.17,30 Evaluation of multiple 
systems takes time and adds cost making comprehensive assessment difficult to implement 
in clinical practice. It is the authors’ contention that the time requirement to conduct frailty 
assessments, using even the 5-domain tool17 might be the main barrier to the inclusion of 
frailty in preoperative assessments. Although the actual times devoted to frailty and MAT-sf 
assessments were not recorded, on average, 10–15 minutes were required for the evaluation 
of frailty and ≤5 minutes for self-reported mobility using the MAT-sf. Therefore, identifying 
an efficient index to evaluate the health of multiple systems using a simple preoperative 
assessment could have a significant benefit to patient care and medical expenditures.
The ability to move freely in the daily environment, as assessed by a mobility tool such as 
the MAT-sf, requires integration and coordination between sensory feedback, neural control, 
and the musculoskeletal system. Mobility has also been associated with cognitive abilities, 
including those used in planning and monitoring performance (executive function).31,32 
Mobility limitations are associated with higher rates of disability, NHP, and mortality.33–35 
Therefore, it is a logical target for preoperative evaluation of older adults when postoperative 
events are outcomes of interest. In the perioperative setting, the TUG test and gait speed 
have been most commonly studied. In elderly patients undergoing colorectal and cardiac 
surgery, slower TUG times were associated with increased postoperative complications and 
one-year mortality.18 In elderly patients undergoing cardiac surgery, slow gait speed (≥6 s to 
walk 5-meter) predicted the composite outcome of in-hospital mortality or major 
morbidity.19 However, performance-based tests of mobility may not be practical in a 
preoperative clinic setting, particularly when attempting to evaluate older adults with 
orthopedic conditions, comorbidities that limit physical function, and illness.
The MAT-sf is a quick, reliable, cost-efficient clinical tool for identifying older adults at risk 
for future major mobility disability36 and early postoperative adverse events. The MAT-sf 
provides animated videos of complex, real-world tasks such as stepping over objects and 
walking on uneven paths outdoors, and in contrast to objective tests such as the TUG and 5-
meter walk test, there is no need for dedicated space, and concerns surrounding patient 
safety are eliminated. In fact, while sitting in the waiting room of the preoperative 
assessment clinic, patients can provide an assessment of their ability to perform each 
mobility challenge on a laptop computer or an iPad in 5 minutes or less. As reading 
comprehension for the MAT-sf was designed at an 8-grade level, only minimal assistance 
with the computer or iPad is needed. Indeed, the electronic format reduces the chance for 
human error and eliminates the need for extensive assessor training.36 Low preoperative 
MAT-sf scores (e.g., ≤50) could be used to alert patients, their families, caregivers and 
physicians of the potential for needing postoperative activities of daily living and 
instrumental activities of daily living assistance, falls prevention, home modifications, or 
home health care following elective surgery. Even though the receiver operating 
characteristic curves show that the MAT-sf does as well as frailty in predicting postoperative

 complications and NHP, it is the authors’ contention that the MAT-sf is more practical to 
perform, and thus more appealing to be used in a busy preoperative clinic setting than frailty 
assessments.
Our study has several limitations. First, this was a prospective cohort study of a convenience 
sample from a single institution. It is possible that this resulted in selection bias. Moreover, 
these participants might not generalize to the broader preoperative population. Most of our 
patients were Caucasian, and racial disparities in predictors of mobility have been 
recognized.37 Second, we assessed postoperative outcomes up to 30 days post-surgery, so we 
cannot make any inferences about long-term postoperative outcomes. However, 30 days is 
the time frame most often used in other postoperative outcome studies, since 30-day 
readmission is a key indicator of healthcare outcomes.38 Third, we did not measure 
cognitive function preoperatively, and we could not control for cognition when we analyzed 
these data. Indeed, preoperative cognitive impairment is a risk factor for poor postoperative 
outcomes.39,40 Given that walking speed is affected by cognition, especially executive 
function,41,42 it would be interesting to determine in future studies whether the MAT-sf 
captures both mobility and underlying cognitive impairment that affects postoperative 
outcomes. Fourth, we enrolled patients who were undergoing various surgeries, including 
orthopedic procedures for conditions that have the capacity to cause mobility- and chronic 
pain –related limitations and other procedures for conditions that do not overtly impair 
mobility. The impact of preoperative mobility limitation, enhanced recovery protocols and/or 
standardization of care on postoperative outcomes might be different in these two surgical 
groups. However, in our sensitivity analysis involving orthopedic-only patients, neither self-
reported mobility nor frailty status was associated with postoperative outcomes (fully 
adjusted model), suggesting that mobility-related limitations linked to joint, spine and/or 
bone surgery probably did not skew our overall findings. Moreover, since the study wasn’t 
designed for the current analysis and our analysis was exploratory, further investigations 
using the MAT-sf score as an indicator of physical status and a risk factor in the assessment 
of postoperative outcome are needed. Finally, there was only one patient who was frail, 
perhaps related to the fact that our patients were there for an elective surgery and because we 
excluded those patients who required assistive devices to walk 4 meters. More work is 
needed to assess the efficacy of the MAT-sf in predicting postoperative outcomes in frail 
patients. Still, the MAT-sf provides a tool to discriminate among older elective surgical 
patients who are not frail.
Conclusions
In this single center cohort study, we provide conditional evidence that preoperative self-
reported mobility, as measured by the MAT-sf, predicts early postoperative complications, 
hospital LOS, and discharge to a nursing home in older patients scheduled for elective 
noncardiac surgery. In addition to validating these findings in a larger, multi-center 
investigation, future studies are warranted to test whether preoperative strength and balance 
training might limit adverse postoperative outcomes and reduce LOS in older patients with 
self-reported measures of limitations in mobility.

Data represent the number (n) of patients within each tertile of the MAT-sf who had a documented postoperative 
complication. Greater postoperative delirium was found among patients with mobility limitation, as characterized by worst 
(range: 30.2–47.7) and mid tertiles (range: 57.95–67.76) of the MAT-sf, as compared to those in the best tertile of the MAT-
sf (range: 57.95–67.76) (P = 0.03).

 Values represent odds ratios (OR) or hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds 
ratios of postoperative complications and nursing home placement, and Cox proportional hazard regression models were 
used to compare time to discharge for frailty status and MAT-sf (as a continuous variable).
*Intermediately Frail/Frail or Mobility Assessment Test-short form (MAT-sf) as the only predictor in the model.
†Odds ratios or hazard ratios were for every 10-point decrease of MAT-sf, which is equivalent to 1 standard deviation (SD).
‡Adjusted for traditional covariates, including age, sex, body mass index, pain score, Revised Cardiac Risk Index, ASA 
Physical Status classification and surgical risk, plus CRP, but only either frailty or MAT-sf as the predictor in the model.
§All covariates in the traditional + CRP model, plus both frailty and MAT-sf were in the model.

 What we already know about this topic
•
Preoperative assessment of patient characteristics that can assist in the 
evaluation of risk for adverse postoperative outcomes is especially important 
for the elderly, in whom postoperative complications are more likely.
•
Traditional risk assessments, such as American Society of Anesthesiologists 
(ASA) Physical Status Classification, Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI), 
and 5-point frailty evaluation, may be too comprehensive, too focused on 
single organ systems, or too impractical.
What this article tells us that is new
•
Preoperative self-reported mobility, as measured by the quick, reliable, and 
cost-effective mobility assessment tool-short form (MAT-sf), predicted early 
postoperative complications, hospital length of stay, and discharge to a 
nursing home in older patients scheduled for elective noncardiac surgery.

Values represent odds ratios (OR) or hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios of postoperative complications and nursing home placement, and Cox 
proportional hazard regression models were used to compare time to discharge for frailty status and MAT-sf (as a continuous variable).
*Intermediately Frail/Frail or MAT-sf as the only predictor in the model.
†Odds ratios or hazard ratios were for every 10-point decrease of MAT-sf, which is equivalent to 1 standard deviation (SD).
‡Adjusted for traditional covariates, including age, sex, body mass index, pain score, Revised Cardiac Risk Index, ASA Physical
Classification status and surgical risk, plus CRP, but only either frailty or MAT-sf as the predictor in the model.
§All covariates in the traditional + CRP model, plus both frailty and MAT-sf were in the model.
ASA = American Society of Anesthesiologists; CRP = high-sensitivity C-reactive protein; MAT-sf = Mobility Assessment Tool-short form
