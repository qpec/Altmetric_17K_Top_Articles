ABSTRACT
People living traditional lifestyles have higher gut microbiota diversity
than urban subjects. We hypothesized that shifting lifestyles from an urban environ-
ment to a traditional rainforest village would lead to changes in the microbiota of
visitors, which would become more similar to the microbiota of villagers. Here, we
characterized at different time points the microbiota of 7 urban visitors (5 adults
and 2 children) staying in a rainforest Amerindian village for 16 days and compared
them with a reference collection of samples from age-matched local villagers. We
performed a 16S rRNA gene survey of samples from multiple body sites (including
fecal, oral, nasal, and skin samples) using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The main fac-
tor segregating the microbiotas of each body site was the human group (i.e., visitors
versus villagers), with the visitor microbiota tending to have lower alpha diversity;
the lowered alpha diversity was statistically significant in the microbiota of skin and
in the children’
s fecal and oral microbiota. During the rainforest period, all visitors
experienced microbiota changes within their personal cloud of variation. For all
body sites, the microbiota conformations in the visitor children better matched the
microbiota conformations in villagers of the same age than did those of the visitor
adults, which showed a lower “microbiota age” than the microbiota of the villagers.
The results suggest higher stability in the adult microbiota, with the less resilient
children’
s microbiota responding more to dietary changes.
IMPORTANCE Despite the limitations of a small study, our results evidence higher
resilience of the gut microbiota with respect to dietary manipulation in adults than
in children and urge further studies to understand the extent of microbiota plasticity
in response to dietary changes and the mechanisms underlying microbiota resil-
ience. These studies are relevant to the potential of future human pre- and probiot-
ics in preventing or curing microbiota-associated diseases.

colitis (10).
Diet is an important modulator of the gut microbiota (5, 7, 11, 12). Dietary molecules
and products of digestion that bypass the small intestine reach the colon and serve as
substrates for microbes, which produce bioactive compounds with effects both on the
microbial ecosystem and on the host. For example, plant cell walls, which are resilient
with respect to mammalian enzymes, select for fiber degrader bacteria that were shown
to ferment plant polymers into short-chain fatty acids that could nourish colonocytes
and other host tissues (13). Both low-plant-fiber diets (14) and high-fat diets (15) have
been shown to reduce gut microbiota diversity over several generations. Reintroducing
dietary plant fibers did not restore the higher diversity (14). In addition, other lifestyle
factors, such as circadian rhythms (16) and individual hygiene practice (17, 18), have
been shown to influence the commensal microbiota in human and experimental
animals.
People in rural or remote villages with a traditional lifestyle have higher microbiota
diversity (19–22). Their traditional diet is more abundant with dietary fiber and less-
processed food, which contains high levels of plant cell wall carbohydrates and low
levels of soluble sugars and fat (14, 20). Since rapid alterations in the human gut
microbiome after diet changes have been reported (23), we hypothesized that immer-
sion in a setting with a traditional diet and lifestyle (such as life sharing, circadian
rhythms, and hygiene practices) would reshape the microbiota of urban subjects,
making it more diverse and similar to that of local villagers. Here we determined the
structure of the microbiota in urban subjects at multiple body sites, during a 16-day
stay in a remote village in the rainforest south of Venezuela.
RESULTS
Samples from a total of 7 urban subjects (5 adults and 2 children) were collected
from different body sites (i.e., nasal cavity, mouth, and skin) and from feces during a
16-day visit to a rainforest village in the state of Bolivar in Venezuela, close to the
Brazilian border. The urban visitors consumed only a traditional low-fat/high-fiber
unprocessed diet, adopted the circadian activities of the locals (for example, going to
bed early since there was no electricity, waking up early with the sunrise, and getting
8 to 9 h of sleep), and bathed in the rivers without using soaps or shampoo. Samples
from age-matched local villagers (11 adults and 27 children) were also collected at one
time point. Microbial DNA was extracted, and a survey of 16S rRNA gene data was
performed on a total of 327 samples (Table S1).
The results show that with respect to body sites, the skin and fecal microbiotas had
the highest alpha diversity, followed by the nasal and oral microbiotas (Fig. 1). Overall,
large variations were seen within all body sites and time points. The main factors
segregating the microbiotas of each body site were the human groups (i.e., visitors
versus villagers; Fig. 1). In addition, principal coordinate 1 (PC1) from the principal-
coordinate analysis (PCoA) (Fig. 1; see also Fig. S1 in the supplemental material)
segregated fecal and skin microbiotas, and PC2 segregated nasal and oral sites.
Microbiota alpha diversity tended to be lower in urban visitors than in villagers, but the
difference was statistically significant only in the microbiota of skin and children’
s fecal
and oral microbiotas (Fig. 1). Visitor children showed a trend toward increasing alpha
diversity during the rainforest period (Fig. 1; see also Fig. S2), although the data were
not statistically significant.
During the rainforest stay, there was no evidence of divergence of individual
microbiotas from the baseline (samples noted with squares in Fig. 1A, C, E, and G) or
of interindividual convergence with respect either to the conformation of the villagers
(Fig. S3) or to reducing interindividual distances among visitors, with the exception of
the skin microbiota, as was evidenced by the smaller interindividual skin microbiota
distances seen at the end of the stay (Fig. S4).
The fecal beta diversity changed over time within visitors’individual variation clouds
in the PCoA plot (Fig. 1A), reflecting the strong individuality of the intestinal microb-

 iotas. In children, there was a gain in alpha diversity during the rainforest visit. All
visitors reported a change in fecal color from brown to clear yellow, within the first
week of arrival in the rainforest, consistent with the lower levels of bile secretion
associated with low-fat diets. Results of linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe)
analyses of human group-discriminant taxa showed that the adult visitors had lower
fecal levels of Treponema, Succinivibrio, and Ruminobacter spp. and higher fecal levels
of Bacteroides, Blautia, Faecalibacterium, Coprococcus, Roseburia, unknown genera from
the Rikenellaceae and S24-7 families, and Clostridiales spp. than the adult villagers
(Fig. S5A). The two visiting children had lower proportions of fecal Escherichia and of
unknown Ruminococcaceae and Bacteroidales genera than the local children and higher
proportions of Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Blautia, Clostridium, Coprococcus, Rumino-
coccus, Lachnospira, Bifidobacterium, and unknown Lachnospiraceae and Rikenellaceae
genera (Fig. S5B). Levels of Faecalibacterium significantly increased in the visiting
children during the rainforest stay (Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’
s post hoc multiple-
comparison text, corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure).
Significant visitor-villager differences were detected for the nasal and oral microbi-
ota beta diversities in adults but not in children (Fig. 1C and E). There were several taxa
with different levels of abundance between visitors and villagers, including the visiting
children having lower nasal Streptococcus and Haemophilus levels and higher Alloococ-
cus and Corynebacterium levels (Fig. S5C) and the visiting adults having higher oral
Haemophilus levels (Fig. S5D).
The skin microbiotas of adult visitors had significantly lower diversity than those of
villagers (Fig. 1H), with a lower representation of Kocuria spp. and an unknown
Streptophyta sp. and higher levels of Acinetobacter, Enhydrobacter, and an unknown
Stramenopiles sp. (Fig. S5E). Visiting children had higher levels of skin Acinetobacter, an
unknown Stramenopiles sp., and Enhydrobacter than local children (Fig. S5F). During
the rainforest stay, skin Stramenopiles proportions decreased to a statistically signifi-
cant extent in adult visitors (at day 11 to day 16 in relation to days 1 to 4; Kruskal-Wallis
test with Dunn’
s post hoc multiple-comparison test, corrected using the Benjamini-
Hochberg procedure).
Finally, with the purpose of estimating how much deviation the visitors’microbiotas
had in relation to the microbiota structure for chronological age, we used the local
villagers’microbiotas to train a random forest model, which we call “microbiota age,”
similarly to the maturity analysis in Bangladeshi children that was previously reported
(24). The random forest models fitted quite well for fecal and nasal microbiotas
(pseudo-R2 � 55.23% and 49.96%, respectively) and fairly well for oral and skin
microbiotas (pseudo-R2 � 36.16% and 27.07%, respectively). The analysis showed that
for all body sites, visitor adults—but not children—showed a lower predicted “micro-
biota age” than was shown by the villagers (Fig. 2). This apparent microbiota “imma-
turity” in adult visitors did not improve during the rainforest visit (Fig. S6).
DISCUSSION
The results of this study show relatively limited changes in the gut microbiota (taxa
structure) of urban subjects—particularly adults—during an immersion in the tradi-
tional diet and lifestyle of a rainforest village. Although diet has been shown to drive
convergence of the gut microbiome (gene structure) (25), there seem to be limits to the
plasticity of the microbiota imposed by the existing taxon diversity, which tended to be
lower in the visitors than in the villagers. The changes in the microbiota of adult visitors
occurred mostly within individual variation clouds, and only the skin microbiota—and not
the gut, oral, or nasal microbiota—converged among adult visitors, suggesting a lack of
taxon transmission or acquisition of new diversity; therefore, the microbiota plasticity was
modeled by diet, within the existing individual diversity. Nevertheless, microbiota redun-
dancy should cause diet sharing to result in functional convergence of the microbiome. Gut
microbiota plasticity was more evident in the visitor children, who increased their fecal
alpha diversity during their visit. It was interesting that this occurred despite the age of the
children �4 to 6 years old—which was beyond that at which the child fecal microbiota has

 been shown to come to resemble the adult fetal microbiota (19). Additional research is
needed to sort out the effect of individual factors (e.g., diet, behavior, day-night cycles,
clothes, chlorine presence, and physiology) on microbiota composition.
The fecal color change to light yellow reported by the visitors likely corresponded
to low levels of bile acid secretion, consistent with low-fat-diet intake. High levels of
plant cell wall carbohydrates (cassava and fruits) and low levels of soluble sugars (fruits
and some honey) in the diet likely increased the production of short-chain fatty acids
(26, 27), but those factors were not measured in this study. Turnbaugh et al. demon-
strated in mice that switching from a low-fat, plant polysaccharide-rich diet to a
high-fat, high-sugar “Western” diet shifted the structure of the microbiota within a
single day (7). In this human study, we observed much higher resilience in the adult
fecal microbiotas than in those of the children. This finding is in line with a previous
report that shifting to a plant-based diet (such as the change experienced by the
visitors going to the rainforest in this experiment) did not cause significant changes in
microbiotas compared to the strong increase seen in shifting to an animal-based diet,
suggesting that the directionality of the dietary change could affect the degree of
microbiota shifting (23). But a bigger study, controlling also for the baseline diet, is
needed to better characterize the effect of diet changes. Finally, in comparing visitors
to villagers, the presence of intestinal protozoa and helminths in villagers (Table S2) is
likely to have an effect on the composition of their fecal microbiota (28).

 is consistent with their alpha diversity being lower than that of the villagers. Age increases
the diversity of the microbiota and functional genes (19, 29), and an increase of resistance
and resilience with age is evidenced by the resistance to transfer of phenotypes via the
microbiota as recipients grow older (3, 10, 30–32). The “
microbiota age” analysis general-
izing the regression model from one population to another needs to be framed in the
context of two human groups with different microbiotas. If the microbiotas of visitors are
sufficiently different, the model will yield low-confidence predictions for those subjects. The
results show that the comparison of the microbiota of adult visitors to that of age-matched
locals renders a low predicted microbiota age for the chronological age. Interestingly, this
apparent “
immaturity” did not occur in the two visitor children.
Limitations of this study included the low subject number among the visitors, especially
the visiting children, the lack of time series data in the reference group of age-matched
villagers, and the lack of a control with respect to the baseline diet, which would account
for some individual variability. Although the study was limited in size, the results highlight
the importance of more studies to improve our understanding of the age windows of
microbiota plasticity. More studies of dietary effects on the human microbiota are needed
in children, since they do show a capacity to gain alpha diversity, suggesting higher
microbiota plasticity. Humans are exposed to more chemically diverse and more homoge-
neous diets and lifestyles (high sharing) under rainforest conditions than under urban
conditions (with social stratification), and these low variability settings offer opportunities
for additional controlled studies. Future studies should use metabolomics and metagenom-
ics to identify effectors (interacting microbes and phytochemicals) influencing the micro-
biota and should use conventionalized germfree mice to study the consequent phenotypes
associated with different microbiotas or derived strains.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects and samples. A total of 7 urban subjects (5 adults aged 34 to 55 and 2 children aged 3 and
7) visited a rainforest village in the upper Caura River region in the state of Bolivar at the Venezuelan
border with Brazil in October 2015, under Venezuelan Institute of Scientific Research (IVIC) institutional
review board (IRB) approval (project Dir0229/10 approval granted to M. Contreras). The visit consisted of
a 16-day immersion in the local Amerindian lifestyle, including their diet. The diet consisted of daily
intake of cassava (Yucca), fish, and a diversity of fruits, with a small portion (about two bites) of game
meat three times per week. Morning, noon, and dinner meals were similar. The visitors did not use soaps
or toothpaste or have access to chlorinated water but bathed in the river, as the locals did. Prior to and
after the rainforest visit, the visitors stayed at Caracas, the capital city of Venezuela. Age-matched local
villagers (11 adults aged 30 to 60 years and 27 children aged 2 to 8 years) were recruited as the reference
populations. Samples were taken from nose, mouth, skin (on the right arm and right hand), and feces by
swabbing and were immediately frozen in dry shippers in the field. Local villagers were sampled once,
and visitors were sampled multiple times (i.e., 5 to 8 times) across the duration of the study (see Fig. S7 in
the supplemental material).
16S rRNA gene survey. Microbial DNA was extracted from collected samples using a Qiagen DNeasy
PowerSoil HTP 96 kit and amplified using primers targeting the V4 region of the 16S rRNA genes
according to the modified protocol described in the Earth Microbiome Project website (http://press.igsb
.anl.gov/earthmicrobiome/protocols-and-standards/). Prepared amplicon libraries were sequenced at the
Genome Technology Center of the New York University School of Medicine using Illumina MiSeq
sequencing instruments and paired-end 150 chemistry.
Data analysis. Analyses of the 16S rRNA sequencing data were performed using the QIIME pipeline
(v1.9) (33) and the R package phyloseq (34). Paired-end reads from Illumina MiSeq were merged and
quality trimmed (minimum quality score of 20), and the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were picked
using an open-reference strategy with a threshold of 97% identity to the Greengenes database (v13_8).
For comparisons across samples with different sequencing depths, analysis of fecal communities was
rarefied to 10,000 reads per sample, analysis of oral and nasal communities was rarefied to 4,000 reads
per sample, and analysis of skin communities was rarefied to 5,000 reads per sample. These depths were
deemed appropriate on the basis of the rarefication curve shown in Fig. S8.
The unweighted/weighted UniFrac distances (35) and the Bray-Curtis similarity data were calculated
to obtain the pairwise beta diversity, which was further evaluated by the analysis of similarity (ANOSIM)
test (36) using the R package vegan (37) to test the significance with 999 permutations. The alpha
diversity analysis was performed using Faith’
s phylogenetic diversity (38), Shannon index data, and
observed OTUs. To determine significant differences in diversity, the Kruskal-Wallis test with the post hoc
Dunn’
s test using Benjamini-Hochberg correction was performed. Linear discriminant analysis effect size
(LEfSe) was used to detect overrepresented bacterial taxa in comparisons (linear discriminant analysis
[LDA] score of �2.0) (39).
The microbiota age of individuals was estimated by constructing a random forest model using local
villagers as the reference (24, 40). A preliminary random forest regression model was built by using the

 age of villagers as the response variable and the scaled abundance of all taxa in the villagers as the
predictive variable. The number of trees to grow was set to 10,000, and the number of taxa randomly
sampled at each split was set to 1/3 of the total number of taxa. This preliminary model was rebuilt 100
times, and data corresponding to the importance of all taxa were averaged across the 100 runs. A feature
selection step was then performed to determine the number of taxa to include in the final model, which
was determined based on 5-fold cross-validation; the number of taxa that generated the lowest
cross-validation error was selected. The final random forest regression model was built on a subset of
predictive variables which were selected based on their importance and the number of taxa to be
included. The random forest modeling natively incorporated cross-validation into the model building
process, and the pseudo-R-squared value, calculated from the cross-validation errors, can be used to
evaluate the goodness of the model fit.
The description of statistical results in this article was constructed by providing an a priori significance
level, which was compared to the P value of a specific test. Unless otherwise noted, a value of 0.05 was
used to determine the statistical significance. The specific statistical tests that were conducted and the
P values are presented in the figures to avoid repetitiveness in the main text.
