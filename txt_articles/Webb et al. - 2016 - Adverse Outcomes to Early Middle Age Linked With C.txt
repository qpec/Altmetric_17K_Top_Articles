 Adverse Outcomes to Early Middle Age
Linked With Childhood Residential
Mobility

Introduction: Links between childhood residential mobility and multiple adverse outcomes
through to maturity, and effect modification of these associations by familial SES, are incompletely
understood.
Methods: A national cohort of people born in Denmark in 1971–1997 were followed from their
15th birthdays until their early forties (N¼1,475,030). Residential moves during each age year
between birth and age 14 years were examined, with follow-up to 2013. Incidence rate ratios for
attempted suicide, violent criminality, psychiatric illness, substance misuse, and natural and
unnatural deaths were estimated. The analyses were conducted during 2014–2015.
Results: Elevated risks were observed for all examined outcomes, with excess risk seen among those
exposed to multiple versus single relocations in a year. Risks grew incrementally with increasing age
of exposure to mobility. For violent offending, attempted suicide, substance misuse, and unnatural
death, sharp spikes in risk linked with multiple relocations in a year during early/mid-adolescence
were found. With attempted suicide and violent offending, the primary outcomes, a distinct risk
gradient was observed with increasing age at exposure across the socioeconomic spectrum.
Conclusions: The links between childhood residential mobility and negative outcomes in later life
appear widespread across multiple endpoints, with elevation in risk being particularly marked if
frequent residential change occurs during early/mid-adolescence. Heightened vigilance is indicated for
relocated adolescents and their families, with a view to preventing longer-term adverse outcomes in this
population among all socioeconomic groups. Risk management will require close cooperation among
multiple public agencies, particularly child, adolescent, and adult mental health services.

Introduction
R
esidential mobility occurs commonly in devel-
oped countries. The U.S., for instance, has been a
mobile society for generations. In the early 1950s,
around a fifth of its population moved annually1 and
during 2014, more than 11% of Americans relocated.2
Although this topic has been researched since the early
post-war years,1 the impact of residential transience
during childhood remains incompletely understood. It
has been examined from various perspectives: health
scientists have studied psychopathology, substance mis-
use, and suicide,3–5 whereas social scientists have
reported on well-being,6 social capital,7 behavioral,8
and educational outcomes.9
Multiple approaches have been applied in measuring
mobility, including total number of relocations, time
since last move, and time in current residence.3 Most
studies have not specifically examined moves between
municipalities or cities or distance moved.3 Investigators
have relied on subject self-reported exposure status,10
which could be affected by recall bias, especially if
residential changes occurred often or at an early age.
Attrition bias, with loss to follow-up more likely for
transient families, is another common limitation.3

 Register-based studies have not been subject to these biases,
but they have tended to report on a single outcome like
severe mental illness.4 Multiple interrelated adverse out-
comes, with complete follow-up from adolescence to early
middle age, have not been reported. It is also unclear how
risks vary by familial SES, which has often been treated as a
confounder11 rather than an effect modifier, or the research
focus has been solely on low-income families.12,13
This national cohort examined risks across three
adverse outcome domains:
1. Self-directed and interpersonal violence: attempted
suicide, violent criminality;
2. Mental illness and substance misuse: any psychiatric
diagnosis, substance misuse; and
3. Premature mortality: natural and unnatural deaths.
Injury is the leading cause of death between childhood
and middle age in Europe.14 For a program of work
funded by the European Research Council, the authors
investigated an array of fatal and nonfatal outcomes that
reflect self-destructive, hazardous, and violent behavior
in younger people to better understand their determi-
nants. For comparative purposes, natural deaths were
also examined. Relative risk was estimated against people
unexposed to residential mobility, and strength of
association was assessed by age at exposure from birth
through mid-adolescence and by relocation frequency
during each age year of upbringing. It was hypothesized
that relocated children from lower-SES families would
have higher relative risks, as families of higher SES may
more frequently move in a controlled manner to attain
improved employment or to access better housing or
schooling, whereas those of lower SES may more often
make unplanned or chaotic moves, owing to acute
financial crises or threats.
Methods
All people born in Denmark to Danish-born parents during 1971–
1997, who were residing in the country on their 15th birthday,
were examined (N¼1,475,030). Unique personal identification
numbers in the Civil Registration System enabled virtually
complete inter-register and parent–offspring linkage.15 Follow-
up was from 15th birthday until adverse outcome (including
death), emigration, or the final observation date, whichever came
first. These final observation dates varied according to outcome
data availability: December 31, 2011, for cause-specific mortality;
December 31, 2012, for attempted suicide and violent crime
conviction; and December 31, 2013, for any psychiatric disorder
and substance misuse. The analyses were conducted during 2014–
2015.
The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency
(file 2013-41-2265), and data access was agreed by the State Serum
Institute and Statistics Denmark (FSE ID 820). In accordance with
the Danish Act on Processing of Personal Data, Section 10, cohort
members’ informed consent was not required.
Measures
Frequency of relocation across municipal boundaries was calcu-
lated for each age year between birth and 15th birthday4 and this
study also determined the aggregate number of moves between
these two time points. Intra-municipality movement was not
measured, thereby precluding dilution of exposure by including
moves on the same street or one nearby, and distance of relocation
was also not examined. Restructuring in 2007 reduced the number
of municipalities from 276 to 96. The data were transformed to the
pre-2007 structure to enable consistent exposure classification
throughout the study period (mean municipality population size,
19,926 residents; mean surface area, 156 km2).
Since 1980, the National Crime Register has recorded all charges
and convictions.16 Interpersonal violent crime was defined as
encompassing convictions for homicide, attempted homicide, assault,
robbery, aggravated burglary or arson, possessing a weapon in a
public place, violent threats, extortion, human trafficking, abduction,
kidnapping, rioting, terrorism, and all sexual offenses (except
possession of child pornographic material). Hospital-treated suicide
attempts were identified from the Psychiatric Central Research
Register17 and the National Patient Register.18,19
Cohort members’ mental illness histories, as well as those of their
parents and siblings, were obtained from the Psychiatric Central
Research Register. From 1969, this has captured all psychiatric
admissions, with information on outpatients also included since
1995. The ICD was applied: 8th revision (ICD-8)20 1969–1993; ICD-
10 from 1994.21 Onsets of any psychiatric disorder (ICD-10, F00–F99;
ICD-8, 290–315) and alcohol or drug misuse disorders (ICD-10, F10–
F19; ICD-8, 291.x9, 294.39, 303.x9, 303.20, 303.28, 303.90, 304.x9)
were delineated by first diagnosis date.
To measure premature mortality, unnatural (ICD-8, E800–
E999; ICD-10, V01–Y89) and natural deaths (all other ICD
mortality codes) were extracted from the Register of Causes of
Death.22 Parental SES data were obtained from the Integrated
Database for Labor Market Research.23 Parental SES was measured
in the year of cohort members’ 15th birthdays as follows:
1. Income (annual quintiles);
2. Highest educational attainment level (primary school, high
school/vocational training, higher education); and
3. Employment status (employed, unemployed, outside workforce
for other reasons).
To examine confounding, these three maternal/paternal SES
variables were fitted separately in multivariable models (Figures
1–3). For the stratified models (Figure 4), the following composite
parental SES variable was applied:
1. “Lower”—Both parents score low in at least one of the three
domains: income¼lowest quintile; highest education¼primary
school; employment status¼outside the workforce.
2. “Higher”—Mother and father both employed and score high in
at least one of the other two domains: income¼highest quintile;
education¼higher education.
3. “Middle”—All other combinations.

 Statistical Analysis
Poisson regression models were fitted using the SAS, version 9.2,
GENMOD procedure, with the logarithms of the aggregated
person-years counts set as offset variables. This is equivalent to
the Cox proportional hazards model, assuming piecewise constant
incidence rates.24–31 The generic reference category consisted of
children who did not move during each age year observed. All
incidence rate ratio (IRR) estimates were adjusted for age, gender,
and calendar year. Further adjustments were made for
1. urbanicity at birth,32 parental age at birth, history of mental
disorder in a parent or sibling; and
2. parental SES.
Age during follow-up, calendar year, and family psychiatric
history were included as time-varying covariates; gender, parental
age, urbanicity, and parental SES were time fixed. Likelihood ratio–
based 95% CIs and interaction tests were calculated. A detailed
explanation of how cohort members’ ages were analyzed is
provided in the Appendix (Section 1, available online).
Results
Thirty-seven percent of cohort members relocated across
a municipal boundary at least once before reaching their
15th birthdays. Appendix Figure 1 (available online)
shows the frequency of residential moves by age at
exposure. Moving just once in a year was relatively
common, especially in early childhood. Thus, during the
first year of life, 7.3% of the cohort moved once
compared with 2.6% at age 14 years. Moving twice or
three or more times in a year was uncommon. Again,
multiple relocations occurred most frequently during
infancy; 0.8% of the cohort moved twice and 0.1% moved
three times or more in the first year of life. These values
decreased with rising age. On the basis of these plots, and
given the rarity of the examined outcomes, exposure for
IRR estimation was classified as one versus two or more
moves in a year.
In this and the next two sections, IRRs adjusted for
age, gender, and calendar year are reported. Figure 1
(Model 1) plots IRRs for attempted suicide and violent
offending associated with single or multiple relocations
in a year from birth to 15th birthday. Attempted suicide
risk was significantly elevated in relation to each expo-
sure period and for one as well as multiple moves in a
year. Risk increased steadily with rising age at exposure,
and was markedly raised if multiple annual relocations
occurred at ages 12–14 years. For all exposure periods,
risk was greater with multiple moves versus a single
move, as indicated by the non-overlapping CIs for the
two sets of IRRs. The pattern of association between
childhood mobility and later violent offending showed
the same trends, except for an even sharper spike in risk
with exposure to multiple relocations in a year during
mid-adolescence than was observed in relation to
attempted suicide risk.
Risk of developing psychopathology increased gradu-
ally across the age year exposure periods, with either one
or multiple relocations (Figure 2, Model 1). The observed
associations were weaker than for attempted suicide and
violent offending, and there was no steep gradient of
rising risk linked with mobility during early/mid-ado-
lescence. The observed associations for substance misuse
were of a greater strength than they were for any
psychiatric disorder, and the IRRs indicated a sharp
spike in risk linked with exposure at ages 12–14 years.
Figure 3 (Model 1) shows that for all natural deaths,
single relocations in a year at ages 0–3 years were linked
with a marginally increased risk, but there was no
elevation in risk with exposure at ages 4–7 years. Mobility
at ages 8–14 years was linked with modestly raised IRRs.
Relative risks for natural death associated with multiple
relocations in a year were somewhat higher. However,
the CIs for these IRRs overlapped with those linked with
a single move, with the exception of exposure at ages 6, 7,
and 14 years.
Unnatural mortality risk was significantly elevated, albeit
only slightly, if a child moved once in a year before its second
birthday. The strength of association with a single relocation
increased incrementally across the age year exposure periods.
Relative risk of unnatural death associated with multiple
moves in a year was much higher than with single
relocations. This differential for exposure to multiple versus
single moves was pronounced at ages 2–6 years. With
exposure at ages 7–12 years, the risk elevations were quite
similar whether children moved once or several times in a
year. A sharp spike in risk was observed with multiple moves
at ages 13–14 years. Across all the age year exposure periods,
the relative risks for both single and multiple relocations were
consistently greater for unnatural versus natural deaths.
Further adjustments for parental age, urbanization,
and psychiatric history in a parent or sibling, and for
parental SES, are shown in Figures 1–3 (Models 2 and 3,
respectively). Consistently across all six adverse out-
comes, these additional adjustments partially attenuated
the observed associations, and they also narrowed the
risk differentials with exposure to multiple versus single
moves in a year. However, for each outcome, the pattern
of increasing relative risk with rising age at exposure to
relocation persisted.

associations
are
presented
in
Appendix Section 3 (available online). The elevation in
violent offending risk was considerably greater in females
versus males exposed to residential mobility at age 14
years. Figure 4 shows relative risk for attempted suicide
and violent offending linked with at least one residential

 move in a year, stratified by parental SES. For both of
these primary outcomes, quite similar associations were
observed across SES strata. However, some specific
differences merit detailed consideration. In the lower
and middle SES strata, residential mobility before age 7
years was linked with modest elevations in risk that
became pronounced as age at exposure to relocation
increased. In the higher SES stratum, a slightly different
pattern was found. For mobility before age 7 years, there
was little evidence of subsequent increased risk. However,
among higher-SES cohort members who moved at age 7
years or older, the elevated risks observed were in line

 with the equivalent IRR estimates for the middle and
lower SES strata. Section 4 of the Appendix (available
online) contains further exploration of these analyses.
For the analyses presented in Figures 1–4, a critical
period approach was taken in measuring exposure to
mobility during each childhood age year. The cumulative
number of relocations through upbringing was also
examined (Appendix Section 5, available online). Across
all six considered adverse outcomes, the highest risks
were among cohort members who moved frequently
before their 15th birthday. “Dose–response” relation-
ships were evident for all outcomes in that each addi-
tional move was associated with an incremental risk
increase.

 Discussion
Across all six adverse outcomes examined, a generally
consistent pattern of long-term risk elevation was found
between mid-adolescence and early middle age in rela-
tion to residential mobility during upbringing. For each
endpoint, there were excess risks linked with exposure to
multiple versus single moves in a year, and risks rose
incrementally in a dose–response fashion with increasing
number of total moves during upbringing and also with
rising age at relocation. For violent offending, attempted
suicide, substance misuse, and unnatural death, there was
a sharp spike in risk linked with multiple moves in a year
during early/mid-adolescence. Adjustment for parental
age and urbanization at birth, familial mental illness, and
parental SES partially explained the observed elevated

 risks. Stratification of the IRRs for attempted suicide and
violent offending by parental SES revealed markedly
elevated risk with increasing age at exposure across the
socioeconomic spectrum.
Owing to its uniquely complete and accurate registration
of all residential changes in its population, Denmark is the
only country where it is currently possible to conduct such a
comprehensive national investigation of childhood residen-
tial mobility and risk of adverse outcomes in later life.
Statistical power was abundant for examining rare expo-
sure–outcome relationships and gender interactions, and for
stratifying relative risk by SES. National registry data
enabled full ascertainment of secondary care treated mental
illnesses and attempted suicides, all violent crime convic-
tions, and all natural and unnatural deaths, as well as
comprehensive right censoring for death or emigration.
The findings concur with previous studies that have

 psychopathology,34,35 substance misuse,5 and premature
death.36 More specifically, and consistent with existing
evidence,12 this study indicates that the link between
residential relocation and adverse outcomes is especially
marked when moves occur during early/mid-adoles-
cence. The published literature, however, cannot be used
to compare risk across multiple outcomes because each
study generally reports a single endpoint only, whereas in
this national registry study, direct comparison across
outcomes was possible. A further restriction to the scope
of previous research is that very few studies report
longer-term outcomes beyond childhood and adoles-
cence.11 These major gaps in the evidence base illustrate
the utility of this study in quantifying risk patterns by age
and frequency of exposure through childhood linked
with multiple adverse outcomes followed up to early
middle age.
Frequent residential moves may be a marker for family
dysfunction and chaotic households.37,38 Residential
changes also often result in disruption of social ties. In
this study, measurement of mobility included only those
residential relocations that transcended municipal boun-
daries. For Danish children aged 7 years and older, such
moves would usually also require a school transfer.
Relocated adolescents often face a double stress of
adapting to an alien environment, a new school, and
building new friendships and social networks, while
simultaneously coping with the fundamental biological
and developmental transitions that their peers also
experience.39
Markedly elevated risk linked with exposure to
residential
mobility
during
early/mid-adolescence
was not restricted to lower-SES families, and stratified
analyses of this nature have not been reported pre-
viously. This finding perhaps indicates that the mech-
anisms implicated in adverse outcome may be at least
partially causal. In theory, the association between
exposure to childhood residential mobility and sub-
sequent adverse outcome could be confounded by
multiple interrelated antecedents,10 and it could also
be restricted to lower-income households where psy-
chosocial difficulties cluster strongly. These novel
stratified analyses indicate that this notion appears
not to hold true, and that, in higher-SES families,
elevated risk is linked with exposure to mobility
during middle childhood and early/mid-adolescence.
Absence of elevated risk in relation to residential
mobility before age 7 years in the higher SES stratum
may reflect aspirational residential movements for
better employment, housing, and schooling opportu-
nities before children formally enter the educational
system. Residential mobility among older child-
ren, even in more-affluent households, may occur in
parallel with severe family stressors such as parental
separation.13,36
Limitations
Although several important confounders were adjusted for,
the observed independent associations may nonetheless
have been prone to residual confounding. This is because
many salient adverse childhood experiences, including most
instances of abuse and neglect, are not routinely registered.5
The underlying reasons for residential change, such as
family dissolution, were also unknown. Furthermore, socio-
economic trajectories among the cohort members beyond
their 15th birthdays, which could have mediated the
observed associations, were not examined. Selection of
potential confounders was essentially restricted according
to their availability, which is a common limitation of many
studies conducted using administrative registers.40 An
unknown degree of reverse causality bias41 may also have
been present. Earlier unregistered problematic behaviors
among older children and adolescents may have motivated
some families to relocate to start afresh. However, it seems
unlikely that these hidden biases could wholly explain the
strong links observed between residential mobility in early/
mid-adolescence and subsequent adverse outcomes. Finally,
the findings may not apply universally beyond Denmark,
although it seems likely that they are relevant to other
western societies with similar drivers of residential mobility.
Conclusions
Childhood residential mobility is associated with multi-
ple long-term adverse outcomes. Although frequent
residential mobility could be a marker for familial
psychosocial difficulties, the elevated risks were observed
across the socioeconomic spectrum, and mobility may be
intrinsically harmful. Health and social services, schools,
and other public agencies should be vigilant of the
psychological needs of relocated adolescents, including
those from affluent as well as deprived families. Effective
monitoring and risk management will require close
cooperation among multiple public agencies, and in
particular among child, adolescent, and adult mental
health services. Further research is needed to understand
the mechanisms that explain how residential relocation
during upbringing, and in early/mid-adolescence in
particular, impacts negatively in combination with other
determinants to produce this array of serious adverse
outcomes. In particular, future analyses could consider
hierarchical structuring in population-based data sets, for
example, by examining clustering effects within neigh-
borhoods and by comparing exposed versus unexposed
siblings.42
