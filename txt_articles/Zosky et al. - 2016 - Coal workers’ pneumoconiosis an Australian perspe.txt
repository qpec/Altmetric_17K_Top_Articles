Coal workers’ pneumoconiosis:
an Australian perspective
“P
neumoconiosis” refers to a group of fibrotic
lung diseases caused by the retention of dust
in the lung. Coal workers’ pneumoconiosis
(CWP), also known as “black lung”, is an irreversible
interstitial lung disease resulting from chronic inhalation
of coal dust.1 CWP has a long history, with the first case
being reported in 1831.2 Workers exposed to coal dust are
at risk of a range of chronic lung diseases including CWP,1
silicosis,1 mixed dust pneumoconiosis,3 chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease4 and chronic bronchitis.4 In cases
of heavy dust exposure, CWP may develop into pro-
gressive massive fibrosis (PMF),5 which can be fatal. In
2013, CWP resulted in 25 000 deaths globally.6 Most cases
of CWP occur in the setting of poor occupational hygiene
and dust control.7
Recent reports of CWP in Australia — six confirmed cases
were reported by nominated medical advisers in the
Queensland coal industry between May 2015 and
February 20168 — are highly concerning and point to a
potential decline in exposure control in Australian mines
or a failure of the screening process, or both. If true, this is
particularly disappointing given the historical success of
Australian systems, such as the Joint Coal Board (formed
in 19469), in reducing the burden of lung disease in the
coal industry through comprehensive screening pro-
grams and oversight of dust exposure control. Given the
potential resurgence of CWP, it is important that we un-
derstand the potential determinants of disease preven-
tion. Here, we consider CWP in the Australian context but
do not discuss the other lung diseases attributable to coal
dust exposure.
Epidemiology of coal workers’
pneumoconiosis
There is a strong relationship between inhaled dust dose
and the risk of developing CWP.10 Airborne respirable
dust in coal mines consists of a number of dusts that are
potentially dangerous to the lung. It originates from
within the coal seam or from adjacent fractured rock and
is caused by coal cutting and other operations such as roof
bolting. The proportion of different dusts affects the type
and severity of lung disease that may develop.
In 1990 and 2013, 29 000 and 25 000 deaths, respectively,
were attributed to CWP globally, compared with 55 000
and 46 000 for silicosis.6 In the United States, there has
been a resurgence of CWP. While there was a decrease in
the prevalence of CWP in coal miners in the US from the
1970s to 1990s (from 6.5% to 2.1%), prevalence then
increased from the 1990s to the 2000s (to 3.2%).11 This was
accompanied by a substantial increase in the prevalence
of coal mine workers with PMF (1990s, 0.14%; 2000s,
0.31%).11 While improvements in the quality of x-rays and
reader technique may explain the some of the increase in
CWP, the concomitant increase in PMF suggests that this
is a true increase in disease prevalence. In the 2010 ex-
plosion that killed 29 miners in West Virginia, post mor-
tem examination showed pathological changes consistent
with CWP in 17 of 24 victims; 16 of these workers had
started working after modern dust limits were applied.12
The recent increase in CWP is concerning and has been
attributed to several potential causes: changes in the
physicochemical characteristics of the dust, reduction in
dust suppression activities, and increased workload (ie,
Summary
� Coal workers’ pneumoconiosis (CWP) is an
untreatable but preventable lung disease arising
from chronic inhalation of coal dust.
� Recent reports of CWP in Queensland, along with
international data, suggest that there is a resurgence
in pneumoconiosis.
� The prevalence of CWP varies considerably between
countries. In Australia, there is no mandatory
reporting system and no national data on the
prevalence of CWP.
� The symptoms and manifestations of CWP vary
depending on the composition of the inhaled dust,
duration of exposure, stage of disease and host-
related factors. CWP may develop into progressive
massive fibrosis (PMF), which can be fatal.
� Radiological assessment should be performed
according to evidence-based standards using the
ILO (International Labour Office) International
Classification of Radiographs of Pneumoconioses.
� As preventing exposure to coal dust prevents CWP, it
is important to implement and enforce appropriate
standards limiting exposure. In Australia, these
standards currently vary between states and are not
in keeping with international understanding of the
levels of coal dust that cause disease.
� Longitudinal screening programs are crucial for
monitoring the health of coal workers to identify
individuals with early-stage disease and prevent
progression from mild disease to PMF.
� We recommend:
< standardisation of coal dust exposure limits, with
harmonisation to international regulations;
< implementation of a national screening program
for at-risk workers, with use of standardised
questionnaires, imaging and lung function testing;
< development of appropriate training materials to
assist general practitioners in identifying
pneumoconiosis; and
< a system of mandatory reporting of CWP to a
centralised occupational lung disease register.

 increased exposure).11 CWP is still an important occupa-
tional lung disease, even in developed countries, and any
reduction in vigilance regarding inhaled coal dust is likely
to result in a significant increase in morbidity and
mortality.
The prevalence of CWP varies considerably by country.
In the United Kingdom, the incidence of CWP declined
dramatically between 2004 and 2008 and has remained
relatively stable since; it is unclear how these data reflect
CWP prevalence in coal workers.13 In some countries, the
prevalence of CWP in coal workers remains high, such as
China (6.02%) and India (3.03%).14,15 In Australia, there
are very few data regarding the true prevalence of CWP
in coal workers, although long-term data from Coal Ser-
vices (which replaced the Joint Coal Board) suggest that
there have been no new cases of CWP in New South Wales
since the 1980s.16 It is difficult to access information about
cases due to a lack of mandatory reporting in Australia.
One retrospective study of pneumoconiosis mortality in
Australia found that, of the more than 1000 deaths
attributed to pneumoconiosis between 1979 and 2002,
only 6% were classified as CWP, with the number of fa-
talities decreasing steadily over time.17 Data from the
National Occupational Health and Safety Commission,
based on potentially unreliable workers compensation
statistics, suggest that between 2001 and 2003 there were
750 new cases of pneumoconiosis (including CWP,
asbestosis and silicosis), with 92 deaths in 2003.18 Mor-
tality from pneumoconiosis in this period of < 1 per
100 000 population is in stark contrast to the 1950s rate of
3.9 per 100 000.18 Again, it is difficult to determine the
current prevalence of CWP among coal workers based
on these data, and it is likely that CWP incidence is
underestimated. One study comparing the prevalence of
CWP in the US and NSW suggested that CWP was almost
absent in Australian coal workers (prevalence < 0.5%).19
This is despite documented higher levels of dust in
NSW19 than in the US, and clear evidence of increases in
CWP-related morbidity from international studies, as
discussed above. This also contradicts estimates of PMF in
Australian coal workers (based on international data),
which range from 1.3% to 2.9%.20 These discrepancies
point to a need for standardising diagnosis and reporting
of CWP nationally, and independent of industry, so that
the true burden of disease in coal workers can be accu-
rately monitored.
Symptoms and manifestations of coal
workers’ pneumoconiosis
The symptoms and manifestations of CWP vary accord-
ing to the stage of the disease and the physicochemical
properties of the dust that has been inhaled. CWP has a
long latency period (usually � 10 years), and individuals
with mild disease usually have no symptoms, making
early diagnosis difficult at a time when prevention is
most effective.1 Symptoms begin with mild cough, fol-
lowed by increasing breathlessness, wheeze and cough
productive of black sputum (melanoptysis) in later
stages, accompanied by significant airflow obstruction,21
gas trapping and impaired diffusion capacity.22 Restric-
tive deficits may also occur as a result of fibrosis,3 and late
complications include pulmonary hypertension,23 cor
pulmonale24 and death. The symptoms of CWP are non-
specific and identical to those of lung disease from other
causes. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are also well
documented to occur with coal dust exposure,25 further
complicating diagnosis.
Pure carbon, the main constituent of coal, is largely inert.
However, the physicochemical properties of processed
coal are complex and include organic and inorganic
contaminants with known pro-inflammatory and carci-
nogenic properties, such as silica, iron, cadmium, lead,
kaolin, pyrite and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.1,26
The nature and extent of these, along with the physical
properties of the carbon particles, have a significant
impact on the risk of developing pneumoconiosis.27
Crystalline free silica, the commonest contaminant,
independently causes silicosis28 and is often found in high
quantities in dust associated with coal mining.29 Thus,
CWP and silicosis have significant overlap.
CWP results from the aberrant repair processes that occur
when prolonged exposure leads to the activation of pro-
inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways in the lung.30
Coal dust stimulates pathways that lead to fibrosis due
to the cytotoxic effects of the particles31 and the release of
pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators by cells
responding to the particles.30 Central to this is the capacity
of coal particles to produce abundant reactive oxygen
species32 and induce oxidative stress.33
The manifestations of CWP can vary greatly between
individuals, depending on the composition of the dust
and duration of exposure, as well as host-related factors.34
Accumulation of dust occurs initially in the walls of the
respiratory bronchioles, the adventitia of the blood
vessels and the bronchoalveolar canals. Collections of
dust-laden macrophages accumulate in the walls of the
airways, particularly at their bifurcations, and in adjacent
alveoli.1 Fibrous tissue is deposited, which later shrinks
and leads to distortion of local lung structures.34 With
increasing release of inflammatory mediators and depo-
sition of fibrous tissue, these “macules” become larger
and develop into more organised, dense, central, dust-
pigmented lesions called micronodules,1 which can be
palpated in the lung and seen on a chest x-ray (Box 1).
Many larger rounded nodules then develop, particularly
in the mid and upper zones of the lungs. Subsequently,
centriacinar emphysema develops.35
Eventually, large masses of coal dust (Box 2), lympho-
cytes, dust-laden macrophages, reticulin and collagen
may converge to form areas of PMF. These usually occur
in the upper posterior parts of the lungs and appear as
large rounded masses on the chest x-ray34 (Box 1, B). The
presence of PMF represents “complicated” CWP and is
associated with increasing symptoms and mortality.34
Radiological assessment relies on systematic objective
assessment of good-quality chest x-rays. Scoring is
important and should be performed to strict standards

 using the ILO (International Labour Office) International
Classification of Radiographs of Pneumoconioses.36 The
ILO classification provides a means of systematically
recording the chest radiographic abnormalities that occur
in any type of pneumoconiosis. The classification does not
imply legal definitions of pneumoconioses for compen-
sation
purposes.36
While
low-dose,
high-resolution
computed tomography (HRCT) scans are more sensitive
for early disease,37 CT scanning is not currently used for
screening purposes.
“Simple” pneumoconiosis is characterised by small, ill
defined, rounded opacities in the outer thirds of the lung
fields and the mid and upper zones. These can be cat-
egorised by size (categories q, r and s) and by density
(categories 1e3). Identifiable radiological changes often
occur well before changes in lung function or clinically
significant disease. The whole of the lung fields may be
involved in stage 3. PMF appears as rounded, sausage-
shaped or ovoid opacities greater than 1 cm in diameter,
which are well demarcated from the adjacent lung and
may vanish if the contents are expectorated. Standard x-
rays are available from the ILO for comparison purposes.
Documentation of results includes an assessment of the
technical quality of the chest x-ray, as well as relevant
findings, and each detailed finding is assigned a standard
code
that
facilitates
documentation,
diagnosis
and
monitoring.36
Prevention of coal workers’ pneumoconiosis
As the only cause of CWP is coal dust, prevention is
straightforward — preventing exposure to coal dust
prevents disease. This is important, as no effective treat-
ments for CWP exist. Like all occupational diseases, pre-
vention requires adherence to appropriate environmental
standards and occupational health and safety guidelines
by employers and workers.
Standards exist for limiting exposure to the respirable
fraction of coal dust in most industrial settings. However,
these standards vary considerably between states in
Australia. For example, in Queensland the standard is
3.0 mg/m3, while in NSW it is 2.5 mg/m3.19 Both of these
are significantly less stringent than the current US stan-
dard of 1.5 mg/m3.19 The Australian Institute of Occu-
pational Hygienists has recommended that the limit be
reduced to 1.0 mg/m3,38 and it could be argued that it
should be even lower. The discrepancies in limits are
compounded by variation in testing protocols between
regions. For example, in Queensland, monitoring of dust
exposure includes the travel time between the mine
entrance and the coal face, whereas in NSW, exposure is
only monitored during the individual miner’s period of
underground work.19
Knowing the legislated standard for coal dust levels, it is
up to the employer to implement measures to prevent
exposure. However, the extent of implementation may
depend on the costs associated with dust mitigation,
which may explain why smaller mines tend to have a
higher incidence of CWP.11 The management and over-
sight of dust sampling and monitoring is an important
factor that can have a big impact on dust exposure; the
intricacies of this are beyond the scope of this review.
Given the variation in standards between states, in both
dust monitoring and suppression, it is not possible to
assess the overall extent of compliance with standards or
the
implementation
of
dust
suppression
strategies
throughout Australia. However, a recent report by the
Queensland Mines Inspectorate has raised concerns
about the level of exposure in some situations,39 whereby
60% of mines exposed longwall operators to levels equal
to or greater than the exposure limit in 2014, compared
with 10% in 2012. Similarly, there have been increases in
the percentage of mines that have exceeded regulatory
limits (0 in 2012 v 25% in 2014).39
Taken together, these observations indicate that Austra-
lian standards are not based on the international

 understanding of the levels of coal dust that are likely to
cause disease, and there are no consistent standards for
monitoring dust levels. There is also some evidence to
suggest that regulatory compliance may be a problem.
Screening for coal workers’ pneumoconiosis
Screening programs are crucial for monitoring the health
of coal workers to identify individuals with early-stage
disease and prevent progression from mild asymptom-
atic disease to PMF. Screening is mandatory in other
countries and has been very effective at reducing the
prevalence of pneumoconiosis in workers at risk of
exposure to occupational dust.40 In situations where
screening is voluntary, there is a low (about 40%)
participation rate.19 The World Health Organization
recommends that all workers exposed to coal and silica
dust undergo lifelong health surveillance, including a
baseline
assessment
(with
chest
x-ray)
before
commencing work, annual spirometry and symptom
questionnaires, and follow-up chest x-rays every 2e5
years.41 Surveillance should continue after exposure and
records should be kept for 30 years or longer after
cessation of employment. Health surveillance is usually
financed by the employer.
X-ray assessment using the ILO method is the current
international standard for identifying disease.36 Ques-
tionnaires and spirometry are also effective in detecting
other chronic lung diseases associated with dust exposure
and can prompt referral to a respiratory specialist. Lung
function assessment will identify respiratory disorders
not visible on imaging and allow tracking of individual
trajectories of lung decline. A computerised program
(Spirometry Longitudinal Data Analysis [SPIROLA]
software) is available free from the US National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to identify
workers whose decline in lung function is greater than
normal.
In the US, the NIOSH requires radiologists to be certified
as “B readers” for classifying pneumoconiosis to ILO
standards.42 This is not a requirement in Europe or
Australia. The B Reader Program is a proficiency program
to provide a pool of qualified readers capable of accu-
rately using the ILO system,42 which has recently incor-
porated modern digital technologies.34 Use of digital
techniques may improve the reproducibility of small-
opacity profusion classification in some respects, but
could also slightly reduce the frequency with which some
readers identify large opacities.34 HRCT is acknowledged
as being more sensitive than chest radiography for
detecting parenchymal and pleural abnormalities and
interstitial fibrosis,37 but it is limited by equipment
availability, costs and radiation exposure, although
modern CT scanners use a much lower radiation dose that
is comparable to old chest x-rays.43 In Australia, the
proficiency of radiologists for reporting surveillance films
in accordance with ILO methods is determined by the
Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiolo-
gists (RANZCR).
Data from a screening program must be carefully
maintained to allow longitudinal assessment, which may
identify important changes over time. A comprehensive
surveillance program also requires a process for referral to
specialist respiratory physicians and a means of explain-
ing results to the worker, preferably with a written record
of examination results.
Conclusions
Recent reports of CWP in Australia and international
epidemiological data suggest an increase in CWP preva-
lence among coal workers and are a major concern. Given
that CWP is a preventable but untreatable disease, no new
cases should occur. Disease eradication must be the aim.
We suggest the following actions, which are summarised
in Box 3.
1. Dust exposure limits and monitoring
The current Australian standards for coal dust exposure
limits, which vary between states, are less stringent than
international recommendations, and exposure moni-
toring protocols vary considerably between sites. We
strongly urge that the Australian guidelines be reviewed
on the basis of current knowledge of CWP, in line with
international standards, and that exposure limits and
monitoring
protocols
are
nationally
standardised
according to best practice guidelines.
2. Screening
We strongly advocate for a comprehensive screening
program for workers at risk of exposure to coal or silica
dust using a protocol based on international guidelines,
which includes a questionnaire, medical imaging and
lung function testing including measurement of diffusion
capacity. This should be funded by the employer but
preferably evaluated by physicians and radiologists not
employed by the coal companies. We recommend
implementing recent advances in lung imaging, including
digital radiography and storing data in a single de-
identified central system, which could be accessible to
workers, unions, government agencies and employers.
Workers should be given a copy of their results after each
screening. The WHO recommends data storage for at
least 30 years after the worker’s retirement, and we
endorse this recommendation.

Clinical focus
 We acknowledge that chest radiography can be insen-
sitive and non-specific for the diagnosis of CWP, but
screening with low-dose CT is currently impractical for
reasons of cost, availability and convenience. Digital
radiography using ILO standards should be performed
at the commencement of coal dust exposure and at
least every 3 years, or more frequently, depending on
the results of ongoing assessment. Sending radiological
images overseas is unnecessary and the RANZCR
register of radiologists who can assess to ILO standards
should be used. We believe that further research is
needed to examine the utility of more modern methods
of early diagnosis; namely, the use of low-dose HRCT
screening.
Workers who show an accelerated decline in lung func-
tion or a change in radiological or questionnaire scores
should be recommended for further investigation with
HRCT and full lung function testing, including mea-
surement of gas transfer performed by accredited labo-
ratory personnel accordingto international standards and
interpreted by a specialist respiratory physician. Workers
should be referred early to specialist respiratory physi-
cians with an interest in occupational lung disease, and
the costs of such investigations should be borne by
employers. Where pneumoconiosis is diagnosed, we
recommend a system of mandatory reporting to a
centralised occupational lung disease register.
3. General practitioner training and referral
Pneumoconiosis is rarely diagnosed in the general prac-
tice setting. We suggest that training materials for general
practitioners be developed to assist with identifying cur-
rent or retired workers at risk of pneumoconiosis. We also
suggest that all dust-exposed workers with significant
respiratory symptoms, whether in an existing surveil-
lance program or after retirement, be referred to a
specialist respiratory physician, preferably with expertise
in occupational lung disease.
4. A centralised occupational lung disease register
Current data regarding occupational lung disorders in
Australia are inadequate. The results of surveillance for
CWP should be made publicly available and stored in a
central repository. Thus, individual changes in respira-
tory health could be monitored, as well as changes in
prevalence and incidence, and the system could beused to
detect potential difficulties in surveillance and prevention
processes. CWP and other occupational lung diseases
should be made notifiable diseases, so that all diagnosed
cases are recorded. Such information should be used to
close the loop and feed back to employers to allow early
implementation of change.
It is unacceptable that any new cases of CWP should be
occurring in Australia in 2016, and our aim should be to
eliminate CWP in Australia altogether.
