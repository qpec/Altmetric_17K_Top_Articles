Global, regional, national, and selected subnational levels 
of stillbirths, neonatal, infant, and under-5 mortality, 
1980–2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden 
of Disease Study 2015
GBD 2015 Child Mortality Collaborators*
Summary
Background Established in 2000, Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG4) catalysed extraordinary political, 
fi
 nancial, and social commitments to reduce under-5 mortality by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. At the 
country level, the pace of progress in improving child survival has varied markedly, highlighting a crucial need to 
further examine potential drivers of accelerated or slowed decreases in child mortality. The Global Burden of 
Disease 2015 Study (GBD 2015) provides an analytical framework to comprehensively assess these trends for 
under-5 mortality, age-specifi
 c and cause-specifi
 c mortality among children under 5 years, and stillbirths by 
geography over time.
Methods Drawing from analytical approaches developed and refi
 ned in previous iterations of the GBD study, we 
generated updated estimates of child mortality by age group (neonatal, post-neonatal, ages 1–4 years, and under 5) 
for 195 countries and territories and selected subnational geographies, from 1980–2015. We also estimated numbers 
and rates of stillbirths for these geographies and years. Gaussian process regression with data source adjustments 
for sampling and non-sampling bias was applied to synthesise input data for under-5 mortality for each geography. 
Age-specifi
 c mortality estimates were generated through a two-stage age–sex splitting process, and stillbirth 
estimates were produced with a mixed-eff
 ects model, which accounted for variable stillbirth defi
 nitions and data 
source-specifi
 c biases. For GBD 2015, we did a series of novel analyses to systematically quantify the drivers of 
trends in child mortality across geographies. First, we assessed observed and expected levels and annualised rates 
of decrease for under-5 mortality and stillbirths as they related to the Soci-demographic Index (SDI). Second, we 
examined the ratio of recorded and expected levels of child mortality, on the basis of SDI, across geographies, as 
well as diff
 erences in recorded and expected annualised rates of change for under-5 mortality. Third, we analysed 
levels and cause compositions of under-5 mortality, across time and geographies, as they related to rising SDI. 
Finally, we decomposed the changes in under-5 mortality to changes in SDI at the global level, as well as changes in 
leading causes of under-5 deaths for countries and territories. We documented each step of the GBD 2015 child 
mortality estimation process, as well as data sources, in accordance with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent 
Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER).
Findings Globally, 5·8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 5·7–6·0) children younger than 5 years died in 2015, 
representing a 52·0% (95% UI 50·7–53·3) decrease in the number of under-5 deaths since 1990. Neonatal deaths 
and stillbirths fell at a slower pace since 1990, decreasing by 42·4% (41·3–43·6) to 2·6 million (2·6–2·7) neonatal 
deaths and 47·0% (35·1–57·0) to 2·1 million (1·8-2·5) stillbirths in 2015. Between 1990 and 2015, global under-5 
mortality decreased at an annualised rate of decrease of 3·0% (2·6–3·3), falling short of the 4·4% annualised rate 
of decrease required to achieve MDG4. During this time, 58 countries met or exceeded the pace of progress required 
to meet MDG4. Between 2000, the year MDG4 was formally enacted, and 2015, 28 additional countries that did not 
achieve the 4·4% rate of decrease from 1990 met the MDG4 pace of decrease. However, absolute levels of under-5 
mortality remained high in many countries, with 11 countries still recording rates exceeding 100 per 1000 livebirths 
in 2015. Marked decreases in under-5 deaths due to a number of communicable diseases, including lower respiratory 
infections, diarrhoeal diseases, measles, and malaria, accounted for much of the progress in lowering overall 
under-5 mortality in low-income countries. Compared with gains achieved for infectious diseases and nutritional 
defi
 ciencies, the persisting toll of neonatal conditions and congenital anomalies on child survival became evident, 
especially in low-income and low-middle-income countries. We found sizeable heterogeneities in comparing 
observed and expected rates of under-5 mortality, as well as diff
 erences in observed and expected rates of change for 
under-5 mortality. At the global level, we recorded a divergence in observed and expected levels of under-5 mortality 
starting in 2000, with the observed trend falling much faster than what was expected based on SDI through 2015. 
Between 2000 and 2015, the world recorded 10·3 million fewer under-5 deaths than expected on the basis of 
improving SDI alone.

Introduction
Substantial reductions in under-5 mortality have 
occurred worldwide during the past 35 years, with every 
region recording sizeable improvements in child 
survival.1–8 National rates of decrease have varied 
substantially,1,5 which has been attributed to rising levels 
of income per person;9,10 greater educational attainment, 
especially in women of reproductive age;11,12 lower 
fertility rates; strengthened public health programmes; 
and overall improvements in health technologies and 
systems.13 Many view the development and scale-up of 
many life-saving interventions targeting various leading 
causes of under-5 deaths14 as primary accelerants of 
child survival during this time, including insecticide-
treated 
nets,15,16 
artemisinin-based 
combination 
therapies,17 the prevention of mother-to-child trans-
mission of HIV,18 and a number of vaccines, such as for 
measle 
s and rotavirus and the pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine.19 Further, expanding the provision of more 
long-standing inter 
ventions, such as oral rehydration 
therapy for diarrhoeal diseases or antibiotics for 
pneumonia, and addressing environmental risks, such 
as water and sanitation, probably contributed to 
reductions in under-5 mortality in many places.20,21 Amid 
such advances were increased domestic funding 
and development assistance for health, particularly 
Interpretation Gains in child survival have been large, widespread, and in many places in the world, faster than what 
was anticipated based on improving levels of development. Yet some countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, still 
had high rates of under-5 mortality in 2015. Unless these countries are able to accelerate reductions in child deaths at an 
extraordinary pace, their achievement of proposed SDG targets is unlikely. Improving the evidence base on drivers that 
might hasten the pace of progress for child survival, ranging from cost-eff
 ective intervention packages to innovative 
fi
 nancing mechanisms, is vital to charting the pathways for ultimately ending preventable child deaths by 2030.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study has a long history of 
generating comprehensive, comparable estimates of child 
mortality, and has continually refi
 ned current methods or 
developed new analytical approaches to maximise a full range 
of data sources and systems that track child survival. For the 
2013 iteration of GBD, we evaluated the relative contributions 
of diff
 erent factors, including number of births and education 
levels, to changes in under-5 mortality from 2000 to 2013. 
In recent years, several studies have sought to assess drivers of 
changes in child mortality, such as postulating trends caused by 
a subset of causes and indicators of technical progress. 
A shortcoming of these past approaches is that estimates of 
under-5 mortality levels and trends are typically produced 
within separate analytical frameworks, rather than unifi
 ed 
estimation systems. GBD 2015 child mortality analyses feature 
several advances from previous rounds of the GBD, including 
an expanded set of territories and subnational geographies, 
additional causes, and critical examinations on the 
measurement and impact of changes in sociodemographic 
status on child survival.
Added value of this study
The GBD assessment of child mortality provides timely, 
robust evidence on documenting child health achievements 
during the Millennium Development Goal era, identifying 
causes and regions for which less progress occurred, 
and characterising the association between improving 
development and child survival. Estimates of child mortality 
by age (neonatal, post-neonatal, 1–4 years, and under-5), sex, 
and cause over time now include 519 geographies, a notable 
increase from the 264 included in GBD 2013. The under-5 
mortality database has increased greatly since GBD 2013, and 
we implemented several methodological improvements, 
including data bias adjustments by data source and data type. 
For the fi
 rst time, we estimated the number and rates of 
stillbirths across geographies and over time. Further, this 
analysis applies measures of Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a 
composite measure of income per person, educational 
attainment, and fertility for every geography year, to examine 
the association between changes in child mortality and 
improving levels of development.
Implications
This study provides the most comprehensive assessment so 
far of levels and trends of child mortality worldwide, linking 
recorded rates of change in under-5 mortality with expected 
rates of decrease based on SDI alone. Through a series of 
decomposition analyses, we identify which groups of causes 
contribute most to reductions in under-5 mortality across 
regions and the development spectrum. Comparisons of 
recorded levels and cause composition for child mortality with 
patterns expected based on SDI alone off
 er an in-depth, 
nuanced picture of where countries might need to refocus 
policies and resource allocation for accelerated improvements 
in child survival in the future.

resources dedicated to child health.22,23 The Millennium 
Declaration24 and the political and technical focus 
catalysed by Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG4), 
arguably incited heightened policy attention and 
fi
 nancial commitments to child health by national 
governments and development partners alike.
Despite such progress, most low-income and middle-
income countries (LMICs) did not achieve the MDG4 
target of reducing under-5 mortality by two-thirds 
between 
1990 
and 
2015, 
which 
equates 
to 
a 
4·4% annualised rate of decrease during this time.5 From 
1990 to 2000, the global rate of decrease for under-5 
mortality averaged 2·0% (1·7–2·4) per year, and previous 
forecasts by the UN Inter-agency Group for Child 
Mortality Estimation (IGME) suggested that 62 of 
195 countries would achieve MDG4 by 2015.5 Further, at 
the global level, IGME estimated that MDG4 would be 
missed by 14 percentage points (ie, a 53% decrease in 
under-5 mortality between 1990 and 2015). The degree to 
which countries diverged in their pace of progress has 
prompted extensive debate and refl
 ection on the various 
drivers of child health, including absolute and relative 
funding levels,25 overarching governance,26 health-system 
effi
  ciencies,27 and implementation of optimum inter-
vention packages and specifi
 c health programmes.13,28 
Further, the relative eff
 ect of gains in sociodemographic 
status, advances in medical technologies, and reductions 
in cause-specifi
 c mortality remains contested. Previous 
studies postulate the eff
 ects of cause-specifi
 c death 
patterns on national trends in under-5 mortality,7,29 and 
others have sought to isolate the eff
 ect of broader factors, 
including income per person and education.30 However, 
few studies, if any, have systematically attributed changes 
in mortality due to leading causes of child deaths, as well 
as gains in overall development, across geographies and 
over time.
Enhanced estimation methods, as well as increased 
quantity and quality of data, not only show large 
disparities in under-5 mortality across and within 
countries,1,5,31,32 but also emphasise distinct variations in 
survival by age group and cause among children 
younger than 5 years.1,14,33,34 Previous studies report much 
slower decreases in mortality rates for neonates, or 
children younger than 28 days, than those recorded for 
post-neonates and children aged 1 to 4 years.1,33 These 
fi
 ndings have prompted a heighted focus on newborn 
health,35 especially around the types of interventions 
and health services that might accelerate reductions in 
neonatal mortality.36–38 Systematic disaggregation of 
levels and trends in neonatal mortality, particularly at 
subnational levels, can help focus local needs and 
strategies for improving newborn health. Recent 
analyses also bring renewed attention to late fetal and 
intrapartum deaths, known as stillbirths.39,40 Especially 
in low-income areas, higher stillbirth rates have been 
associated 
with 
preventable 
maternal 
infections, 
including malaria and syphilis,40 highlighting the 
importance of using a comprehensive analytic approach 
that can account for or link various exposures 
and socioeconomic factors related to stillbirths. In 
combination, these fi
 ndings underscore the vital need 
to advance understanding of fetal risks and causes of 
early death associated with pregnancy or delivery across 
and within populations.
In 2015, the MDGs were replaced by the more 
all-encompassing, albeit less health-focused, Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs).41 SDG3.2 is the main 
indicator for improving child survival, with targets of 
reducing under-5 mortality to fewer than 25 deaths per 
1000 livebirths, decreasing neonatal mortality to fewer 
than 12 deaths per 1000 livebirths, and ending 
preventable deaths of newborns and children younger 
than 5 years, all by 2030. In view of these ambitious 
global goals, and the highly heterogeneous trends 
recorded in absolute and relative child mortality trends 
in the past, it is crucial to comprehensively assess 
factors that aff
 ected mortality trends in the past and to 
identify which ones might further improve child 
survival in the future.
The 2015 iteration of the Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD 2015) provides the 
analytical framework from which reductions in child 
mortality can be thoroughly examined by age, geography, 
and cause over time. For GBD 2015, we analyse rates of 
under-5 mortality disaggregated by age group, as well as 
stillbirths, for 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 
2015; however, much of this paper focuses on results 
between 1990 and 2015, aligning with the period of time 
covered by MDG4. Expanding on subnational analyses 
done for GBD 2013, we provide estimates of levels and 
trends in under-5 mortality at subnational levels for 
Brazil, China, India, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, 
South Africa, Sweden, the UK, and the USA. Through a 
series of decomposition analyses and assessments 
of child mortality in relation to measures of 
sociodemographic status, we quantify diff
 erences in 
observed and expected gains in child survival given 
changes in development alone.
Methods
The methods used to generate estimates of under-5 
mortality and age-specifi
 c death rates (early neonatal, late 
neonatal, post-neonatal, ages 1–4 years, infant, and 
under 5), contribute to broader GBD 2015 analyses and 
results on all-cause mortality and cause of death. 
Substantial detail on data inputs, processing, and 
estimation methods can be found in an accompanying 
GBD 2015 publication.14 Here we provide a brief summary 
of our under-5 mortality estimation approach and 
accompanying analyses, including an assessment of 
mortality trends by Soci-demographic Index (SDI), and 
attribute changes in under-5 mortality to leading causes 
of death. We also describe our estimation of stillbirths by 
geography and over time.

Our analyses presented here and elsewhere for GBD 
2015 follow the recently proposed Guidelines for 
Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting 
(GATHER),42 which include the documentation of data 
sources and inputs, processing and estimation steps, and 
overarching methods used throughout the GBD study.
Geographical units of analysis
For GBD 2015, we analysed 195 countries and territories 
in the 21 GBD regions. Since GBD 2013, we added seven 
territories and expanded subnational analyses from three 
countries (China, Mexico, and the UK)43–45 to include eight 
additional countries: Brazil, India, Japan, Kenya, Saudi 
Arabia, South Africa, Sweden, and the USA. Here, we 
present results at the global, regional, national, territory, 
and, for a subset of countries, subnational levels from 
1980–2015. Countries for which subnational estimates are 
shown include Brazil (26 states and one district), China 
(33 provinces and municipalities), India (62 urban and 
rural administrative units), Japan (47 prefectures), Kenya 
(47 counties), Mexico (32 states), Saudi Arabia (13 regions), 
South Africa (nine provinces), Sweden (two regions), the 
UK (four nations and nine subregions for England), and 
the USA (50 states and the District of Columbia).
Data
Data sources and types used for estimating child 
mortality are described extensively elsewhere,14 but in 
sum, vital registration (VR) systems, censuses, and 
household surveys with complete or summary birth 
histories served as primary inputs for our analyses. Other 
sources, including sample registration systems and 
disease surveillance systems, also contributed as input 
data. In total we applied formal demographic techniques 
to 8169 input data sources of under-5 mortality from 
1950–2015. Overall data availability and availability by 
source data type varied by geography.
Stillbirth data were extracted from major survey series, 
including Demographic and Health Surveys, the Centers 
for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) Reproductive 
Health Surveys, UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster 
Surveys, and the WHO Multi-Country Surveys. We also 
used VR systems, birth registries, and literature sources. 
Following defi
 nitions for stillbirths used by previous 
studies,39,40 we classifi
 ed fetal deaths at 28 weeks or later 
and intrapartum deaths (ie, deaths that occurred after the 
onset of labour but prior to birth) as stillbirths. We 
collated 7579 geography-year datapoints from 1980–2015 
on stillbirths, representing 350 countries, territories, and 
subnational locations in our analysis. The appendix 
provides additional detail on stillbirth data sources and 
processing steps (appendix pp 19–22). 
All-cause under-5 mortality and age-specifi
 c mortality
The appendix presents the analytical steps involved in 
estimating all-cause under-5 mortality and death rates by 
age group: early neonatal (0–6 days), late neonatal 
(7–28 days), post-neonatal (29–364 days), and ages 
1–4 years (appendix p 31). Details on data bias 
adjustments for under-5 mortality, using spatiotemporal 
Gaussian Process regression to generate a complete 
time series of under-5 mortality for all geographies and 
the age–sex model to produce estimates of mortality for 
early neonatal, late neonatal, post-neonatal, and ages 
1–4 years have been extensively discussed previously46 
and in the appendix.
For subnational analyses, we rescaled estimates from 
lower administrative units to the national level because 
data densities were generally much higher at the national 
level than at the subnational. South Africa was the 
exception to this approach, where national-level estimates 
were generated by aggregating subnational estimates up 
to the national level.
To estimate mortality by age group and sex within 
the under-5 categorisation, we used a two-stage 
modelling process that has been described in detail 
elsewhere.3,14 For this analysis, we report on early 
neonatal and late neonatal mortality results in 
aggregate as neonatal mortality; the appendix provides 
estimates of early and late neonatal mortality (appendix 
pp 35, 36).
Stillbirth analysis
In GBD 2015, for the fi
 rst time, we generated estimates 
of stillbirths and stillbirth rates by location from 
1980–2015. Drawing from data compiled by Blencowe 
and colleagues,39 we expanded to include additional data 
from published literature, VR, and surveys. We 
estimated stillbirth trends by modifying the data 
synthesis model used for under-5 mortality. We applied 
a mixed-eff
 ects generalised linear model to quantify the 
ratio of stillbirth rates to neonatal mortality in natural 
logarithmic space. Our model covariates included 
educational attainment among women of reproductive 
age, skilled birth attendance, a random eff
 ect on 
neonatal mortality classifi
 ed into 20 bins, random 
intercepts for each location, and data source-specifi
 c 
random eff
 ects nested within each location. Neonatal 
mortality was chosen for its strong coeffi
  cient of 
correlation with stillbirth rates (0·8). Source-specifi
 c 
fi
 xed eff
 ects were included to adjust for biases inherent 
to a subset of data sources; the appendix provides the 
complete list of data source types (appendix p 21). 
Finally, we included a variable that accounted for 
diff
 erent stillbirth defi
 nitions, encompassing the seven 
defi
 nitions found within our database. These defi
 nitions 
included fetal death after 28 weeks of gestation, 
26 weeks of gestation, 24 weeks of gestation, 22 weeks 
of gestation, 20 weeks of gestation, weighing at least 
1000 g, and weighing at least 500 g. There were also 
1744 location-years where no defi
 nition was provided, 
which we included as an eighth undefi
 ned defi
 nition 
category. Stillbirth rates from surveys and complete vital 
registration systems where the defi

Under-5 populations and total deaths
Accurate estimates of total under-5 deaths hinge upon 
accurate estimates of under-5 populations, disaggregated 
by each age group, sex, geography, and year. For each 
age–sex-specifi
 c group, we modelled population as a 
function of livebirths for every year and corresponding 
death rates during each interval under analysis.

The appendix provides population estimates (appendix 
pp 93–104). 
Under-5 causes of death
The methods developed and used in GBD 2015, 
including the systematic approach to collating causes of 
death from diff
 erent countries, mapping across diff
 erent 
revisions and national variants of the International 
Classifi
 cation 
of 
Diseases 
and 
Injuries 
(ICD); 
redistribution of deaths assigned to so-called garbage 
codes; and the overall and disease-specifi
 c cause of 
death modelling approaches are described in other 
publications14,47–50 and in the appendix (appendix 
pp 24,25).
For GBD 2015, we assessed 249 causes of death across 
age groups. Because of cause-specifi
 c age restrictions 
(eg, no child deaths due to Alzheimer’s disease and other 
dementias), not all causes of death were applicable for 
children younger than 5 years. The appendix provides 
the full GBD 2015 cause list (appendix pp 150–56), and 
additional information is published elsewhere.14,51
Socio-demographic Index
Expanding upon analyses from GBD 2013,52 we studied 
patterns in child mortality as they related to measures of 
socioeconomic status and development. Drawing on 
methods used to construct the Human Development 
Index (HDI),53 we created a composite indicator, the 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI), based on equally 
weighted estimates of lagged distributed income (LDI) 
per person, average years of education among 
individuals older than 15 years, and total fertility rate. 
SDI was constructed as the geometric mean of these 
three values. SDI values were scaled to a range of 0–1, 
with 0 equalling measures of the lowest educational 
attainment, lowest income, and highest fertility between 
1980 and 2015, and 1 equalling measures of the highest 
educational attainment, highest income, and lowest 
fertility during this time. SDI was computed for every 
geography-year under analysis, providing a population-
level indicator of overall development at a given time. 
We tested whether alternative lags of the components of 
SDI would provide a better predictor of outcomes such 
as life expectancy and age-specifi
 c probabilities of death. 
We found that using LDI, educational attainment, and 
the total fertility rate in the current year is the most 
predictive of these mortality outcomes. The appendix 
provides additional detail on SDI computation (appendix 
pp 23, 24) and additional information can be found 
elsewhere.14

Decomposing change in under-5 mortality rate by 
causes of death
Based on the age-specifi
 c, sex- specifi
 c, and cause-specifi
 c 
mortality results from GBD 2015,14 we attributed changes 
in under-5 mortality rate between 1990 and 2015 to 
changes in leading causes of death in children younger 
than 5 years during the same period. To do this, we 
applied the decomposition method developed by Beltran-
Sanchez and colleagues,54 which has also been used for 
other GBD analyses.14,43–45
Uncertainty analysis
We propagated known measures of uncertainty through 
key steps of the mortality estimation processes, including 
uncertainty associated with varying sample sizes of data, 
source-specifi
 c adjustments to data used for all-cause 
mortality, 
model 
specifi
 cations 
for 
spatiotemporal 
Gaussian Process regression (ST-GPR) and cause-specifi
 c 
model specifi
 cations, and estimation procedures. Un-
certainty estimates were derived from 1000 draws 
for 
under-5 
mortality, 
age-specifi
 c 
mortality, 
and 
cause-specifi
 c mortality by sex, year, and geography from 
the posterior distribution of each step of the estimation 
process. These draws allowed us to quantify, and then 
propagate, uncertainty for all mortality metrics. Percent 
changes and annualised rates of change were calculated 
between mean estimates, while the uncertainty intervals 
associated with the percent changes were derived from 
the 1000 draws.

Results
Trends in child mortality and by age group
Between 1990 and 2015, global under-5 deaths decreased 
by 52·0% (95% UI 50·7–53·3), from 12·1 million 
(12·0–12·2) in 1990 to 5·8 million (5·7–6·0) in 2015 
(table 1). Reductions in total deaths were similar for the 
post-neonatal and childhood (age 1–4 years) age groups, 
each decreasing at least 50% between 1990 and 2015; 
deaths in children aged 1–4 years fell most rapidly during 
this time (by 59·8%, 95% UI 57·8–61·6). Neonatal deaths 
fell at a slower pace, decreasing 42·4% (41·3–43·6) from 
4·6 million (4·5–4·6) in 1990 to 2·6 million (2·6–2·7)

in 2015. In 1990, 37·6% (4·6 million, 4·5–4·6) of total 
under-5 deaths occurred during the fi
 rst 28 days of life, 
31·2% (3·8 million, 3·7–3·9) were post-neonatal, and 
31·2% (3·8 million, 3·6–3·9) took place in children aged 
1–4 years. By 2015, the composition of under-5 deaths 
shifted to 45·0% (2·6 million, 2·6–2·7) for neonatal, 
28·8% (1·6 million, 1·6–1·7) for post-neonatal, and 
26·1% (1·5 million, 1·4–1·6) for children aged 1–4 years.
Worldwide, under-5 mortality rates fell 52·4% (95% UI 
47·7–56·4) between 1990 and 2015, from 87·1 deaths per 
1000 livebirths (84·5–90·1) in 1990 to 41·4 deaths per 
1000 livebirths (37·9–45·5) in 2015. Global under-5 
mortality decreased at a faster pace from 2000–15 (an 
annualised rate of decrease of 3·6%, 3·0–4·2) than from 
1990–2000 (an annualised rate of decrease of 2·0%, 
1·7–2·4). Similar to trends in total deaths by age group, 
mortality rates in post-neonates and children aged 
1–4 years decreased faster than those recorded for 
neonates. In 2015, neonatal mortality (18·6 deaths per 
1000 livebirths, 17·3–20·1) exceeded mortality rates 
estimated for all other age groups (post-neonatal and 
childhood).
In 2015, age-specifi
 c mortality rates and total under-5 
deaths varied by region and country (table 2). Neonatal 
mortality rates generally exceeded levels recorded for other 
child age groups in many regions; for instance, in south 
Asia, neonatal mortality rates (29·8 per 1000 livebirths 
[95% UI 27·2–32·7]) exceeded mortality rates for other 
child age groups (eg, post-neonatal, at 12·1 per 
1000 livebirths [10·3–14·1]) by double in 2015. For other 
regions, 
particularly 
western 
and 
central 
sub-
Saharan Africa, mortality rates were higher in children

Figure 3: Leading 30 causes of global under-5 deaths for both sexes combined for 1990, 2005, and 2015 at GBD cause hierarchy Level 3
Causes are connected by lines between time periods. For the periods 1990–2005 and 2005–15, two measures of change are shown: percent change in the number of under-5 deaths and percent 
change in the under-5 mortality rate. Changes that are statistically signifi
 cant are shown in bold. Neonatal preterm birth=preterm birth complications. Neonatal encephalopathy=neonatal 
encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. Neonatal sepsis=neonatal sepsis and other neonatal infections. Neonatal haemolytic=haemolytic disease and other neonatal jaundice. 
STDs=sexually transmitted diseases. Intestinal infectious=intestinal nematode infections. Foreign body=pulmonary aspiration due to foreign body in the airway. COPD=chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease. Fire and heat=injuries due to fi
 re, heat, and hot substances. War and legal intervention=collective violence and legal intervention.

aged 1–4 years. Across countries, children in this age group 
had the largest diff
 erence in mortality rates, ranging from 
0·3 deaths per 1000 livebirths (95% UI 0·2–0·4) in Andorra 
to 61·1 per 1000 livebirths (49·6–74·2) in Niger. At the 
regional level, 30·1% (1·7 million [95% UI 1·7–1·8 million]) 
of under-5 deaths occurred in South Asia, 25·3% 
(1·5 million [1·4–1·6 million]) in western sub-Saharan 
Africa, and 15·6% (909 000 [871 000–948 000]) in eastern 
sub-Saharan Africa. India recorded the largest number of 
under-5 deaths in 2015, at 1·3 million (1·2–1·3 million), 
followed by Nigeria (726 600 [647 200–814 600]) and Pakistan 
(341 700 [311 300–376 000]). Mali had the highest neonatal 
mortality rate in 2015 with 40·6 per 1000 livebirths 
(34·6–47·1); Central African Republic and Pakistan, with 
neonatal mortality rates of 40·2 per 1000 livebirths 
(32·2–49·9) and 37·9 per 1000 livebirths (34·8–41·3), 
respectively, recorded the second-highest and third-highest 
toll for neonatal mortality in 2015.
Figure 1 shows the heterogeneity for under-5 mortality 
rates across geographies. In 2015, under-5 mortality 
spanned from 1·9 per 1000 livebirths (1·6–2·4) in 
Andorra to 130·5 per 1000 livebirths (115·9–148·8) in

Chad. Among a subset of countries with subnational 
estimates, disparities in under-5 mortality were strikingly 
clear. At the national level, Kenya’s under-5 mortality rate 
was 50·8 per 1000 livebirths (45·4–57·6) in 2015, but 
county-level rates ranged from 20·8 per 1000 livebirths 
(17·7–24·1) to 119·8 per 1000 livebirths (76·7–174·6). 
In Brazil, the national under-5 mortality rate was 
16·9 deaths per 1000 livebirths (13·4–21·4) in 2015, with 
state-level rates spanning from 12·0 per 1000 livebirths 
(8·7–16·3) to 27·3 per 1000 livebirths (21·3–34·0).

MDG4 target of 4·4% per year. Of the 195 countries and 
territories under analysis, 58 met or surpassed the MDG4 
target of 4·4% annualised decrease between 1990 and 
2015. Most of these countries were in north Africa and the 
Middle East, central Europe, southeast Asia, and western 
Europe, whereas only two were in sub-Saharan Africa. 
32 of the countries and territories that achieved MDG4 
were classifi
 ed as lower-middle income or upper-middle-
income countries by the World Bank, and only four of 
those that met MDG4 (Cambodia, Ethiopia, Liberia, and 
Nepal) were categorised as low-income countries.

MDGs were declared. Geographies in blue met or 
exceeded an annualised rate of decrease of 4·4%, the pace 
required to achieve MDG4 starting in 1990. The fi
 gure 
emphasises the acceleration of progress in reducing 
under-5 deaths in many sub-Saharan African countries. 
16 countries in sub-Saharan Africa achieved MDG4 pace 
reductions betwveen 2000 and 2015, compared with the 
two that achieved that rate of reduction between 1990 and 
2015. Many countries in central Asia and eastern Europe, 
including Russia (5·4% [5·2–5·6]) and Azerbaijan (5·2% 
[3·4–7·0]), also reached or surpassed the MDG4 target for 
annualised rates of decrease from 2000–15; however, 
based on the MDG4 timeline of 1990–2015, these 
countries failed to achieve the target of 4·4% per year.

Global changes in under-5 deaths 
While nearly all causes of under-5 deaths decreased by 
2015, their relative rankings shifted over time (fi
 gure 3). 
From 1990–2005, only two of the leading causes of 
under-5 death had signifi
 cant increases in lives claimed 
and relative ranks: malaria (an 18·2% [1·3–45·7] rise, 
from sixth to fourth) and HIV
/AIDS (a 419·5% 
[374·8–461·5] rise, from 32nd to 12th). By contrast, global 
under-5 deaths due to various communicable diseases 
fell substantially, including diarrhoeal diseases (45·3% 
[40·0–50·0]), 
lower 
respiratory 
infections 
(47·5% 
[44·1–50·7]), measles (65·5% [51·2–75·9), and tetanus 
(76·3% [72·4–79·0]). Under-5 deaths due to a number of 
injuries also decreased, including road injuries (43·6%

[49·9–63·1]). 
Although total under-5 deaths due to congenital 
anomalies and haemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell 
anaemia, decreased from 1990–2005, their relative 
rankings increased during this time. Between 2005 and 
2015, the rise of malaria and HIV
/AIDS reversed, with 
under-5 deaths due to these causes falling by 
42·8% (29·4–54·6) and 51·9% (49·6 –54·2), respectively. 
These decreases continued for lower respiratory 
infections, diarrhoeal diseases, and tetanus, although the 
percent decrease over the most recent decade was not as 
high as in the previous 15 years; a similar trend was 
found for under-5 injury deaths, particularly for road 
injuries. Under-5 deaths due to measles, however, fell

faster after 2005, dropping another 75·1% (59·6–84·5) by 
2015. War rose to the 25th-leading cause of global under-5 
deaths in 2015, largely driven by escalating mortality 
associated with ongoing confl
 icts in the Middle East. 
Notably, preterm birth complications and neonatal 
encephalopathy became the leading two causes of global 
under-5 deaths in 2015, despite experiencing moderate 
but statistically signifi
 cant decreases in under-5 deaths 
from each cause. These shifts represent the relatively 
slower progress for reducing mortality due to neonatal 
conditions as compared with various communicable 
diseases. For under-5 deaths due to congenital anomalies 
and haemoglobinopathies, minimal changes between 
2005 and 2015 led to increased relative ranks as well.

Decomposing changes in under-5 mortality by causes 
of death 
Figure 4 charts changes in under-5 mortality from 
1990–2015, as attributable to changes in leading causes of 
under-5 deaths, for each country and territory. The vertical 
purple line indicates under-5 mortality in 1990 and the 
vertical orange line refl
 ects under-5 mortality in 2015. The 
relative composition of each geography’s horizontal bar 
illustrates how the change in cause-specifi
 c mortality 
contributed to overall changes in under-5 mortality between 
1990 and 2015. Causes to the left of the 1990 line represent 
decreases in cause-specifi
 c mortality from 1990 to 2015.
Cause-specifi

regional trends emerged. For many high-income 
countries that already had under-5 mortality rates lower 
than 20 per 1000 livebirths in 1990, decreasing mortality 
due to neonatal disorders and congenital anomalies led to 
even lower under-5 mortality by 2015. In places known for 
their marked gains in overall development since 1990 (eg, 
China, Iran, Bhutan, and the Maldives), large reductions 
in death rates due to several causes—preterm birth 
complications, congenital anomalies, lower respiratory 
infections, and injuries—led to these countries’ equally 
sizeable decreases in under-5 mortality. For Latin America 
and several countries in southeast Asia, progress in 
under-5 mortality was associated mainly with decreasing 
death rates from lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal

diseases, measles, and preterm birth complications. 
Decreasing malaria mortality rates served as the main 
force behind overall decreases in under-5 mortality for 
several countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In Uganda, 
Mozambique, Malawi, and Burundi, reductions in 
under-5 malaria deaths accounted for at least 35% of their 
total decreases in under-5 mortality. Several countries in 
sub-Saharan Africa, including Niger, Mali, Benin, and 
Liberia, could also attribute their improvements in child 
survival to reduced mortality from nutrition defi
 ciencies; 
however, such progress was generally far exceeded by the 
gains made against infectious diseases. Unlike higher-
income countries, mortality rates due to neonatal 
disorders decreased at a much slower pace in sub-Saharan 
Africa, and thus minimally contributed to overall 
reductions in under-5 mortality.
Across countries and territories under analysis, only 
three geographies (Dominica, Fiji, and Guam) had overall 
increases in under-5 mortality between 1990 and 2015; 
nonetheless, in some other countries, high rates of 
mortality due to HIV
/AIDS or war lessened the potential 
for even greater gains for child survival since 1990. For 
example, in Lesotho, decreases in under-5 mortality due 
to diarrhoeal diseases and lower respiratory infections 
were almost completely counteracted by the country’s toll 
of HIV
/AIDS. The eff
 ects of war on child survival were 
evident for Syria and Yemen, where rising war-related 
deaths off
 set large decreases in under-5 mortality due to 
diarrhoeal diseases and lower respiratory infections.
SDI and under-5 mortality at regional and global levels
In view of the strong association between SDI and 
under-5 mortality, we examined regional trends for 
under-5 mortality and SDI to identify where progress was 
faster or slower than would be expected based on changes 
in SDI alone over time. In fi
 gure 5, each point represents 
a successive year from 1990 to 2015, refl

region. The black line denotes expected levels of under-5 
mortality based on rising SDI alone, which means that 
estimates above the black line are higher than expected 
given measures of SDI, and those below are lower than 
expected based on SDI alone.
For 
higher-income 
regions, 
observed 
under-5 
mortality generally followed expected trends over time 
and with increasing SDI. Western Europe and high-
income Asia Pacifi
 c consistently recorded under-5 
mortality rates that were somewhat lower than expected, 
based on SDI, whereas high-income North America 
posted slightly higher under-5 mortality rates than 
expected over time and given SDI. After experiencing 
under-5 mortality equalling or above expected rates 
given SDI in the 1990s, several regions, including 
Andean, Central, and tropical Latin America, as well as 
north Africa and the Middle East, had under-5 mortality 
rates falling below expected levels based on SDI by 2015; 
such progress was especially pronounced for Andean 
Latin America. Observed under-5 mortality consistently 
exceeded expected levels, based on rising SDI, in the 
Caribbean and central Asia, whereas under-5 mortality 
rates fell increasingly below expected levels for Oceania. 
Under-5 mortality trends and their relation to increasing 
SDI diverged across regions in sub-Saharan Africa. 
Although observed levels of under-5 mortality exceeded 
expected rates in central and eastern sub-Saharan Africa 
in the 1990s, both regions saw marked reductions in 
observed under-5 mortality over time and experienced 
under-5 mortality rates far below expected levels by 
2015; however, on average, these regions were still 
among those with the lowest levels of SDI in 2015. 
Notably, under-5 mortality in central sub-Saharan Africa 
largely decreased during a period of time when SDI 
decreased in the region. For western and southern sub-
Saharan Africa, observed under-5 mortality remained 
higher than expected levels from 1990–2015, although 
increasing 
SDI 
in 
western 
sub-Saharan 
Africa 
corresponded with observed under-5 mortality rates 
moving closer to expected levels. In southern sub-
Saharan Africa, under-5 mortality rose between 1995 
and 2005, despite increasing SDI, fuelled by the 
escalating HIV/AIDS epidemic. Observed rates of 
under-5 mortality substantially decreased from 2006 to 
2015, yet southern sub-Saharan Africa’s levels of under-5 
mortality still exceeded expected rates given its SDI 
during that time period.
With increasing SDI, expected levels and composition 
of under-5 mortality shifted in a noticeable pattern; 
fi
 gure 6 depicts these trends as assessed across

Coloured lines show global and region values for under-5 mortality. Each point in a line represents one year starting at 1990 and ending at 2015. In all regions, SDI 
has increased over time, so progress in SDI is associated with points further to the right and later years for a given region. The solid black line represents the expected 
under-5 mortality based on SDI alone. SDI=Socio-demogrpahic Index. GBD=Global Burden of Disease.

geographies and over time, representing the average 
relationship between expected causes of under-5 
mortality along measures of SDI. At the lowest levels of 
SDI, communicable causes, especially lower respiratory 
infections and diarrhoeal diseases, accounted for most 
under-5 deaths. Nutritional defi
 ciencies and neonatal 
disorders, which kill thousands of children under 5 
worldwide, comprised a smaller proportion of overall 
deaths at the lowest levels of SDI. Even a moderate rise in 
SDI led to large absolute reductions in under-5 death 
rates and marked changes in cause composition. Under-5 
deaths due to malaria and measles plummeted with 
gradual increases in SDI, highlighting the substantial 
eff
 ects of development for a subset of diseases. At the 
same time, mortality due to neonatal disorders accounted 
for an increasing proportion of under-5 deaths; 
reductions in mortality from lower respiratory infections 
are slower as well. By an SDI of 0·75, infectious diseases 
led to very few under-5 deaths. At this level of SDI, 
neonatal disorders and congenital anomalies accounted 
for the majority of under-5 deaths, though overall deaths 
were quite low.
SDI and child mortality at country, territory, and 
subnational levels
Distinctive, but highly heterogeneous, patterns emerged 
across and within regions when we compared observed 
under-5 mortality rates and annualised rates of change to 
expected levels and pace of change for under-5 mortality 
given SDI in 2015. Figure 7 shows the ratios of observed 
and expected under-5 mortality by geography in 2015, 
colour coded by the magnitude of diff
 erences between 
observed and expected under-5 mortality.
Geographies where the ratio of observed and expected 
under-5 mortality fell well below 1·00 were mainly in 
Central America, many states in Brazil, east and southeast 
Asia, and western Europe. A subset of countries in north 
Africa and the Middle East (eg, 0·44 in Palestine and 0·43 
in Morocco), and eastern sub-Saharan Africa (eg, 0·57 for 
Ethiopia and 0·65 for Mozambique) also had lower levels 
of observed under-5 mortality than expected given SDI. 
Turkmenistan, Guam, and Azerbaijan had the highest 
ratios for observed and expected under-5 mortality, each 
exceeding a ratio of 3·00. There was also a high level of 
heterogeneity at the subnational level. In Kenya, 14 of 
47 counties had levels of under-5 mortality in 2015 that 
were well below what was expected given their SDI while 
seven counties experienced levels that were somewhat 
higher than expected. In China, 30 of 33 provinces and 
municipalities recorded ratios equal to or below 1·00, 
highlighting countrywide gains in under-5 mortality, 
whereas all subnational geographies in the USA and 
South Africa had higher levels of observed under-5 
mortality than expected rates based on SDI.

We also noted geographic diff
 erences between observed 
and expected annualised rates of change for under-5 
mortality between 2000 and 2015. Of the 195 countries and 
territories assessed, 125 had annualised rates of decline 
that were faster than expected based on change in SDI 
alone. Compared with expected rates of change, observed 
rates of annualised decline were generally faster in sub-
Saharan Africa and throughout the Asia Pacifi
 c. Exceptions 
included Chad and Lesotho in sub-Saharan Africa, and 
Malaysia in southeast Asia. The appendix further 
illustrates these diff
 erences (appendix p 39).
Expected changes in under-5 mortality due to SDI
Figure 8 shows the global trend in the observed number 
of under-5 deaths and the number of under-5 deaths 
expected based on the average relationship with SDI. 
From 1990–2000, the global trend in observed under-5 
deaths generally followed the expected trend based on 
SDI. In 2000, observed under-5 deaths fell below expected 
levels, at about 9·3 million (95% UI 9·2–9·4) under-5 
deaths. From 2000–15, the gap between observed and 
expected under-5 deaths widened. In 2015, based on SDI, 
global under-5 deaths were expected to decrease to 
6·8 million; however, we recorded 5·8 million 
(5·7–6·0 million) under-5 deaths in 2015. Cumulatively, 
between 2000 and 2015, 10·3 million fewer under-5 
deaths occurred worldwide than was expected on the 
basis of improving SDI alone.
Stillbirths
Worldwide, 2·1 million (1·8–2·5) stillbirths occurred in 
2015, representing a 47·0% (35·1–57·0) decrease from 
4·0 million (3·1–5·2) in 1990. In view of the fact that 
livebirths worldwide have increased slightly from 
138·6 million to 140·6 million during the same time, the 
decrease in number of stillbirths is all the more en-
couraging. Stillbirth rates decreased 47·0% (35·6–56·8) 
during this time, declining from 28·1 per 1000 
(21·8–36·4) in 1990 to 14·9 per 1000 (12·8–17·6) in 2015. 
Figure 9 displays stillbirth rates across geographies in 
2015, which ranged from 1·2 per 1000 (1·0–1·5) in 
Iceland to 56·3 per 1000 (32·3–98·2) in South Sudan. 
Western and central sub-Saharan Africa recorded among 
the highest stillbirth rates, with eight countries 
experiencing rates exceeding 25 per 1000 in 2015. South 
and southeast Asia saw stillbirth rates span from 3·4 per 
1000 (2·6–4·5) in Thailand to 27·6 per 1000 (23·1–32·8) 
in Pakistan. In Europe, nine countries documented 
stillbirth rates lower than two per 1000, whereas no 
country or territory in the Americas had stillbirth rates

lower than 2·5 per 1000. Large decreases in stillbirth 
rates have been found in many countries from 1990–2015. 
Notably, in 156 of 195 countries included in GBD 2015, 
stillbirth rates decreased more quickly since 2000 than 
between 1990 and 2000.
Discussion
Since its establishment in 2000, MDG4 has been 
viewed as a major catalyst for heightened political, 
social, and fi
 nancial commitments to improve child 
survival, and specifi
 cally, to reduce under-5 mortality 
by two-thirds by 2015. Yet the duration of assessment 
for MDG4 spanned 1990–2015,24 a decision that 
ultimately aff
 ected which countries could be considered 
on pace—equalling or exceeding an annualised rate of 
decline of 4·4%—to achieve this target. As part of the 
GBD 2015 study, we identifi
 ed 58 countries that met or 
surpassed this threshold between 1990 and 2015, and 
36 were deemed to be low-income, lower-middle-
income, or upper-middle-income countries. By con-
trast, from 2000–15, 73 countries reached or exceeded 
this pace of decline, and many more were in sub-
Saharan 
Africa. 
However, 
amid 
these 
gains, 
23 countries still reported under-5 mortality rates 
exceeding 75 deaths per 1000 livebirths in 2015, three 
times higher than the recently proposed SDG target for 
2030.41 Further, while absolute diff
 erences between 
countries with the lowest and highest rates of child 
survival have narrowed since 1990, by 2015, under-5 
mortality still ranged from fewer than two deaths 
per 1000 livebirths in Andorra to more than 130 deaths 
per 1000 livebirths in Chad. These fi
 ndings emphasise 
the pressing need to better assess how various factors 
may accelerate or hinder progress for reducing under-5 
mortality.
As a novel extension of GBD 2015 analyses, we assessed 
global trends in under-5 deaths, in terms of what we 
recorded and what we could have expected solely on the 
basis of SDI. From 1990–2000, global trends in under-5 
deaths were consistent with improving levels of SDI. The 
high correlation recorded for SDI and under-5 deaths, 
which was found across geographies during this time, 
was probably mediated through several pathways, 
including improved access to and demand for public 
health services and medical care, and reduced risks for 
various childhood diseases, including malnutrition, poor 
water and unsafe sanitation, and pollution.55 However, 
from 2000 onwards, we observed greater gains in 
reducing under-5 deaths than what would be expected in 
view of increases in SDI alone. This accelerated pace of 
progress led to 10·3 million fewer under-5 deaths since 
2000, a time that marked a new era focused on improving 
child health.
Such 
hastened, 
faster-than-anticipated 
gains 
in 
survival and longevity have been studied previously, 
including Preston’s attribution of shifts in the association 
between life expectancy and income per person to 
technical innovations10 and several studies that identify 
medical technologies or health-sector research and 
development activities as the main, if not singular, 
drivers of reduced mortality.13,30,56 Alternatively, such 
gains also have been accredited to increased investments 
in child health programmes,22 as well as packages of 
cost-eff
 ective interventions targeting disorders that 
disproportionately aff
 ect children.10,13 Recent analyses 
show that accelerated reductions in under-5 mortality 
can be traced to the scale-up of multiple health 
interventions since 2000, including insecticide-treated 
nets, prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, 
and the introduction of new vaccines, alongside 
improved indicators of socio-economic development.57 
The timing of such gains in child survival from 2000–15, 
which far exceeded the expected pace of progress based 
on improved SDI, cannot be ignored, as this progress 
directly coincided with an escalated policy focus on—
and development assistance allocated to—child health.
Many factors probably underpin these fi
 ndings, and 
they should be thoroughly examined in future studies; 
based on our current analyses and data, we cannot reliably 
parse out and attribute decreases in under-5 mortality to 
specifi
 c interventions, health policies, or the intersection 
of heightened development and health system per-
formance by geography. Here we delve further into GBD 
2015 fi
 ndings for child mortality, specifi
 cally as they relate 
to the MDG4 era, changes in SDI, and changes in cause-
specifi
 c mortality in children younger than 5 years.
MDG4 and the future of improving child survival
To chart potential pathways for achieving continued 
reductions in under-5 mortality, as well as the proposed 
SDG goals for child survival, it is of immense value to 
examine where and why particular countries have 
decreased under-5 mortality, and at faster rates, than gains 
in SDI alone would predict. Costa Rica and Cuba, which 
are heralded as model countries for elevating both income

and health outcomes since the 1990s,13 achieved lower 
levels of under-5 mortality than expected on the basis of 
SDI alone by 2015; however, their pace of progress in 
reducing under-5 mortality from 2000 to 2015 was slower 
than expected based on increases in SDI. Chile and China, 
the other two countries that comprise the lauded 4Cs,13 
also recorded lower-than-expected levels of under-5 
mortality in 2015, particularly China; in terms of their 
annualised rates of change for under-5 mortality since 
2000, nearly every province and municipality in China saw 
the pace of declining under-5 mortality exceed expected 
rates, whereas Chile’s rate of decline was somewhat 
slower than expected on the basis of SDI. In combination, 
these examples stress the importance of assessing both 
absolute levels and relative pace of progress when 
identifying country outliers in performance.
For GBD 2015, four low-income countries—Cambodia, 
Ethiopia, Liberia, and Nepal—met or exceeded the 
MDG4 annualised pace of decrease for both time periods 
(1990–2015 and 2000–2015), representing several success 
stories for improving child health. As shown by our 
decomposition analyses, substantial reductions in 
under-5 deaths due to lower respiratory infections and 
diarrhoeal diseases contributed decreases in overall 
under-5 mortality across these four countries. Further, in 
Ethiopia, decreasing under-5 deaths due to measles and 
nutritional defi
 ciencies also were major factors in 
improving child survival, which might be related to the 
country’s implementation of accelerated measles control 
strategies during the 2000s58 and continued eff
 orts to 
address historical challenges with malnutrition.59 The 
group of low-income countries that met or exceeded the 
MDG4 pace of decrease since 2000 markedly grew, also 
including Malawi, Niger, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zambia, 
which provides concrete evidence that rapid decreases in 
under-5 mortality are achievable, even in lower-resource 
settings. Within countries known for subnational 
inequalities, including Brazil and Kenya, observed rates 
of decrease in under-5 mortality in some regions (eg, 
northeast Brazil; western and southern areas of Kenya) 
highlight the potential for progress amid long-standing 
disparities. It is an unlikely coincidence that many of 
these geographies also recorded lower under-5 levels in 
2015 and faster rates of decrease since 2000 than expected 
based on SDI. MDG4 country case studies highlight the 
importance of multi-sectoral approaches to improving 
child health,60–62 such as implementing policies to achieve 
universal access to primary care for women and children, 
increasing overall government spending on maternal 
and child health, and enacting programmes that promote 
educational attainment and empowerment among 
women. Expanded cases studies examining the drivers of

faster-than-expected reductions in under-5 mortality, 
particularly among countries of similar SDI, could 
provide powerful examples of policy and fi
 nancing 
options to sustain, and accelerate, gains in child survival 
in the post-MDG era.
In moving from MDG4 to SDG3.2, targets for child 
survival also shift from a focus on relative progress to 
achieving absolute targets. By 2015, we found that 
120 countries already recorded under-5 mortality rates 
below 25 per 1000 livebirths, and 118 countries had 
neonatal mortality rates under the target of 12·5 per 
1000 livebirths. Some of the remaining countries, 
including Mali, Chad, and the Central African Republic, 
experienced levels of under-5 mortality exceeding 125 per 
1000 livebirths in 2015; to achieve SDG3.2 by 2030, these 
countries would need to reduce their under-5 mortality at 
a rate faster than 10% per year. Such large, continuous 
reductions in under-5 mortality are essentially un-
precedented in recent decades, with the exception of a 
few counties in China.32 Subsequently, the pursuit and 
potential achievement of SDG3.2 depends on sustained, 
targeted investments and long-term commitments to 
enabling policy environments. In an era of stagnating 
development assistance for health and relatively weak 
prospects for sizeable growth for domestic health 
fi
 nancing in low-income countries,22,23 depending on 
elevated funds as the primary accelerant of child survival 
will likely leave many countries short of achieving 
SDG3.2 by 2030. Instead, the combination of continuing 
investments in proven, high-impact child health 
programmes, including immunisation pro 
grammes and 
malaria interventions, targeting development assistance 
for health to countries with the highest child mortality 
rates, and establishing innovative fi
 nancing mechanisms 
and effi
  ciency gains is crucial.
Changes in under-5 causes of death and their 
contribution to reducing under-5 mortality
By 2015, global under-5 deaths from the vast majority of 
causes markedly decreased, yet their relative pace of 
decrease varied substantially from 1990–2005 and 2005–15. 
For some causes, including measles, tetanus, diarrhoeal 
diseases, and lower respiratory infections, large decreases 
in under-5 deaths occurred during both time periods. Such 
sustained gains may be related to the continued expansion 
of routine immunisation programmes, reduced exposure 
to risks such as poor sanitation and household air 
pollution,55 and improved access to health services 
and care-seeking behaviours for childhood illnesses, 
particularly in lower-income countries.63 Additionally, 
increasingly more high-burden countries have introduced 
new vaccines,64 such as pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
and the rotavirus vaccine, all of which have likely 
contributed to decreases in under-5 deaths due to lower 
respiratory infections and diarrhoea. Despite these gains, 
however, lower respiratory infections remain a leading 
cause of under-5 death in many low-income and 
middle-income countries, underscoring the importance of 
addressing underlying risks for lower respiratory infections 
and heightened lower respiratory infection mortality (eg, 
various types of pollution and malnutrition),65,66 as well as 
improving access to timely diagnosis and treatment.
Global under-5 deaths due to malaria and HIV/AIDS 
increased from 1990 to 2005 but then decreased between 
2005 and 2015. The epidemic mortality peaks for malaria 
and HIV
/AIDS were 2003 and 2005, respectively;14 as a 
result, HIV
/AIDS accounted for a much higher 
proportion of under-5 deaths in 2015 than in 1990 for 
several southern sub-Saharan African countries. If a 
similar decomposition analysis was done for countries 
like Zimbabwe since 2005, decreases in under-5 HIV/
AIDS deaths would be a primary driver of decreased 
under-5 mortality. Such gains were likely prompted by 
the introduction and scale-up of prevention of mother-to-
child transmission of HIV and antiretroviral therapy in 
countries with large HIV
/AIDS epidemics.67 By contrast, 
even though under-5 malaria deaths peaked between 
2000 and 2015, under-5 malaria deaths were much lower 
in 2015, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, than during the 
1990s. The eff
 ects of decreasing malaria mortality on 
overall child survival have been sizeable, as evidenced by 
its contributions toward reducing under-5 mortality in 
Malawi and Mozambique. Such reductions have been 
linked to the scale-up of several malaria interventions, 
including insecticide-treated nets and artemisinin-based 
combination therapies.68
Trends and eff
 ects of congenital anomalies, neonatal 
conditions, and injuries on under-5 mortality—
essentially non-infectious causes of child death—varied 
by region and country income level. For higher-income 
countries, where under-5 mortality rates were already 
quite low in 1990, decreases in deaths due to preterm 
birth complications, various neonatal disorders, and 
congenital anomalies accounted for the vast majority of 
gains by 2015. These trends are likely related to 
improvements in medical technologies and access to 
intensive neonatal care. By contrast, in lower-income 
settings, health facilities often are not fully equipped 
and staff
 ed to treat complex neonatal conditions,69 and 
when they are, other barriers to care, such as cost and 
travel time to facilities, may prevent some of the highest 
risk women from seeking critical health services.70 
Eff
 ective interventions and services exist to prevent 
many of these conditions,71 or at minimum avert 
premature death from them, including multiple 
antenatal care visits and case management of neonatal 
sepsis;37 however, they often require multifaceted 
medical care or policy options that, at present, are not 
fully funded or prioritised by development partners and 
national governments alike.
For many upper-middle-income and lower-middle-
income countries, overall and relative decreases in under-5 
mortality were quite heterogeneous. In some countries, 
such as Bangladesh, decreasing deaths due to drowning

1763
contributed to reductions in under-5 mortality since 1990, 
refl
 ecting the likely implementation of policies that 
address heightened risks for these unintentional injuries.72 
Declining under-5 deaths due to congenital anomalies 
were associated with improved child survival in countries 
such as the Maldives and Iran, but for many countries in 
Latin America, including Brazil, minimal changes 
occurred for under-5 deaths due to these causes. Further, 
in some Latin American countries, such as Colombia and 
Venezuela, under-5 mortality rates from congenital 
anomalies slightly increased by 2015, albeit not 
signifi
 cantly so. In light of the region’s current Zika virus 
outbreak and its potential to spread to other geographies,73,74 
improved monitoring of congenital anomalies, both in 
terms of mortality and incidence, is of high priority.
By examining the cause composition of under-5 
mortality across levels of SDI, we can consider the 
optimal suite of interventions that are most relevant to 
a geography’s progression of development. At the 
lowest levels of SDI, the dominance of infectious 
diseases (namely diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory 
infections, malaria, and measles) and nutritional 
defi
 ciencies underscores the potential impact of scaling 
up interventions targeting these causes, particularly in 
terms of accelerating gains in child survival beyond 
expected rates based on SDI. Particularly for the lowest 
two quintiles for SDI, several eff
 ective public health 
strategies exist for further reducing under-5 mortality,20,75 
including the introduction and scale-up of new and 
long-standing vaccines (ie, pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine, rotavirus, and measles); expanding access to 
oral rehydration therapy and antibiotics; increasing the 
proper use of various malaria interventions, including 
insecticide-treated nets and artemisinin-based comb 
in-
ation therapies; and addressing nutritional defi
 ciencies 
through supplementation and the promotion of 
exclusive breastfeeding. By contrast, for geographies in 
the second and third quintiles of SDI, neonatal 
conditions accounted for the majority of under-5 
deaths. This characterisation, framing epidemiological 
transitions in terms of under-5 mortality and SDI, 
uniquely captures the importance of neonatal causes 
and their toll on child survival as amid gains in 
development. To reach the very low levels of under-5 
mortality achieved by many high-income countries (ie, 
less than fi
 ve deaths per 1000 livebirths), eff
 ectively 
treating and preventing neonatal conditions are 
obstacles that countries will need to clear with 
increasing SDI.
Stillbirths
Amid gains in under-5 and neonatal mortality, moderate 
progress also occurred for reducing the world’s burden of 
stillbirths. Globally, total stillbirths decreased 47·0% 
(35·1–57·0%) since 1990, decreasing from 4·0 million 
(3·1–5·2 million) in 1990 to 2·1 million (1·8–2·5 million) 
in 2015, and stillbirth rates dropped from 28·1 per 1000 
(21·8–36·4 per 1000) to 14·9 per 1000 (12·8–17·6 per 1000) 
during this time. Such reductions, particularly in countries 
such as Brazil, have been associated with improved access 
to antenatal care and addressing known maternal risks for 
stillbirth.40 While specifi
 c risks for stillbirth may vary by 
country and within countries (eg, the distribution of 
genetic risk for congenital conditions are likely to diff
 er 
across regions and local communities), the commonalities 
in risk profi
 les experienced across these high-burden 
countries (ie, large rural populations with low access or 
utilisation of antenatal care and skilled birth attendance, as 
well as the inadequate detection and treatment of maternal 
conditions during pregnancy) cannot be ignored.40
In comparing GBD 2015 stillbirth fi
 ndings with those 
published by the Stillbirth Epidemiology Investigator 
Group (SEIG),39,40 we found that our results are highly 
correlated with previous estimates for 2000 and 2015 
(0·891). At the country level, however, the average 
relative diff
 erence between GBD and SEIG estimates 
for 2015 was –31·3%, indicating that GBD stillbirth 
results were generally lower than those produced by 
SEIG. Relative diff
 erences ranged from –321·3% to 
64·8%, with 49 countries experiencing absolute 
diff
 erences in their point estimates that exceeded 50%. 
Notably, countries for which the largest diff
 erences 
occurred between GBD and SEIG were rarely those with 
the highest stillbirth rates. Diff
 erences in point 
estimates for stillbirths mainly emerged from the use of 
divergent modelling strategies; in particular, for GBD, 
we applied a unifi
 ed modelling strategy that drew from 
consistent, comparably generated covariates across 
geographies and over time. Further, we used source-
type fi
 xed eff
 ects and source-specifi
 c random eff
 ects 
nested within each country in order to properly account 
for potential non-sampling biases from diff
 erent data 
sources. In combination, these methods allowed us to 
generate an internally consistent times series of total 
and rates of stillbirths across geographies.
As emphasised by others,39,40 many countries with the 
highest stillbirth burdens have limited data systems 
documenting stillbirths and existing sources are prone to 
biases. Further, we found that extensive crosswalking 
across the eight stillbirth defi
 nitions encountered in our 
analysis, as well as adjusting for non-sampling bias for 
data sources, had substantial eff
 ects on stillbirth 
estimation at various geographic levels. This further 
demonstrates the critical importance of more standard 
data collection and synthesis approaches for stillbirths, 
particularly as we collectively seek to better quantify local 
burdens of stillbirth and identify cost-eff
 ective options 
for their prevention.
Comparing GBD and IGME estimates 
In recent years, both the GBD and IGME have produced 
annual assessments of trends in child mortality.1,2,5,6,76 
GBD 2015 estimates and the most recent estimates 
from IGME are highly correlated (0·983) across the 
 Articles
1764 
www.thelancet.com   Vol 388   October 8, 2016
187 countries and time period (1990–2015) they both 
cover; however, for some countries, there are notable 
diff
 erences. In comparing absolute values of mean 
relative diff
 erences for estimates of under-5 mortality 
between GBD 2015 and IGME, we found a mean 
absolute relative diff
 erence of 20·4% in 2015, 
normalised to the GBD 2015 estimates. The range of 
country-level relative diff
 erences is much larger. 
Absolute relative diff
 erences in 2015 between the two 
organisations’ estimates exceeded 20% for 74 countries 
and were between 10% and 20% in 43 countries. While 
our estimates were correlated (0·768), and we identifi
 ed 
a similar quantity of countries achieving MDG4 
(ie, 59 from IGME and 58 from GBD), variation 
emerged in terms of which countries actually met the 
target by 2015. 42 countries were identifi
 ed as achieving 
MDG4 by both GBD and IGME, whereas 16 countries 
were acknowledged as having achieved MDG4 by GBD 
but not by IGME, and 17 countries were categorised as 
achieving MDG4 by IGME but not by GBD (the 
appendix provides a detailed comparison). Results for 
sub-Saharan Africa were especially discrepant, as we 
identifi
 ed only two countries, Ethiopia and Liberia, 
having achieved MDG4 between 1990 and 2015, and 
IGME reported ten countries reaching MDG4 (Eritrea, 
Ethiopia, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, 
Niger, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda).5 In view of 
the recorded variations across estimates, and the 
uncertainty associated with estimating annualised rates 
of change, we recommend judicious interpretation of 
particular claims about the achievement or non-
achievement of MDG4.
Such diff
 erences in estimates stem from a number of 
factors. First, our approaches to data processing diff
 er. 
In GBD, methods are used to calculate under-5 
mortality rates from summary birth histories,1,77 which 
consist of four diff
 erent modelling strategies as 
informed by characteristics of the raw data composing 
the summary birth histories. These improved methods 
address two main shortcomings of previous summary 
birth history methods, which are still currently used by 
IGME and other organisations:5,6 unstable estimates of 
under-5 mortality for the years immediately before 
survey data collection; and the short span of time 
covered by estimates. We have subjected our summary 
birth history models to extensive validation testing, 
which documents the improved accuracy of our 
methods for analysing summary birth history data.77 
Second, there are notable diff
 erences in the modelling 
strategies used by GBD and IGME. Developed during 
the 2013 iteration of GBD, we apply a data bias 
adjustment before ST-GPR, which is the modelling 
step from which fi
 nal estimates and corresponding 
95% 
uncertainty 
intervals 
are 
generated. 
This 
adjustment allows us to correct for non-sampling 
biases from each data source within each country upon 
designating reference sources.1 Reference source 
selection is informed by documentation of data quality 
and insights provided by the extensive GBD network of 
collaborators.
Improving child mortality data coverage and quality 
Data quantity and quality for under-5 mortality, 
especially in low-income and middle-income countries, 
has steadily improved over the past three decades; 
nonetheless, most available data for under-5 mortality 
in these settings are derived from survey instruments 
and do not originate from fully functional, complete VR 
systems. In recent years, honed methods for extracting 
and synthesising measures of under-5 mortality from 
surveys, especially summary birth modules, and 
subnational health information systems have supported 
more accurate, timely generation of under-5 estimates.1,77 
However, in the absence of VR data, high levels of 
uncertainty accompany these measures and the risk 
of biased estimates persists. For monitoring age-
specifi
 c mortality and stillbirths, these measurement 
challenges are only amplifi
 ed, as the quantity and 
standardisation of data collection for these indicators 
are much lower. SDG targets call for improved data 
monitoring for countries, including an indicator that 
refers to the need for birth registration, a key component 
of VR systems, for all populations by 2030.41 Increased 
and sustained investments in building and maintaining 
complete VR systems, especially in LMICs, have 
the potential to strengthen responsiveness to and 
accountability for continuing to improve child health in 
the post-MDG era.
Limitations
Amid its strengths and methodological advances, the 
present study has several limitations. First, although the 
quantity of data available to estimate under-5 mortality is 
quite high for most countries, potential for bias exists 
across the various data sources. We have sought to account 
for these biases by identifying the highest quality reference 
source for each country and adjusting estimates from 
other sources accordingly. Nonetheless, bias might remain 
for selected reference data sources. Second, less data are 
available to systematically disaggregate estimates of 
under-5 mortality into age-specifi
 c values for early 
neonatal, late neonatal, post-neonatal, and ages 1–4 years 
by geography and year; subsequently, age-specifi
 c results 
in many countries are more model dependent. A similar 
limitation 
applies 
to 
stillbirth 
estimation. 
Third, 
limitations associated with cause-specifi
 c estimation, as 
detailed in an accompanying publication,14 apply to our 
decomposition analyses for attributing changes in causes 
of death to changes in under-5 mortality. Fourth, due to 
computational constraints, we were unable to fully 
propagate uncertainty associated with covariates used to 
estimate cause-specifi
 c mortality and so-called garbage 
code redistribution algorithms. Sensitivity analyses for 
under-5 mortality indicate that the omission of uncertainty 
 Articles
www.thelancet.com   Vol 388   October 8, 2016 
1765
estimates from the fi
 rst-stage model covariates did not 
signifi
 cantly alter fi
 nal estimates of under-5 mortality. 
Fifth, results evaluated in terms of SDI, such as ratios for 
observed and expected under-5 mortality, may be aff
 ected 
by the potential for measurement error in the individual 
components comprising SDI (ie, income per person, 
educational attainment, and total fertility rate). However, 
because it is comprised of three inputs, our SDI indicator 
will be less sensitive to measurement error than placing 
countries on the development continuum using income 
per person alone, and the improved correlation coeffi
  cient 
between SDI and under-5 mortality as compared with 
income per person alone provides further support to this 
idea. Sixth, our assessment of observed trends in under-5 
deaths, as compared with expected trends based on SDI 
alone, cannot provide causal attribution. Rather, this 
examination resulted in a strong empirical correlation and 
provides a useful framework from which to benchmark 
levels and trends of under-5 deaths, taking into account 
where a geography is along the development continuum.
Our summary measure of SDI included key 
components of sociodemographic development, but it is 
possible that, in some contexts, other indicators may be 
more strongly linked to under-5 mortality, and thus the 
correlation between SDI and under-5 mortality may vary. 
Seventh, our estimation of stillbirth rates makes use of 
many data sources from low-income and middle-income 
countries that are facility based. Stillbirths from these 
sources are likely to be biased upwards because of 
women with high-risk pregnancies or diffi
  cult labour 
being more likely to go to a facility. In addition, there 
may be location-specifi
 c variations in the eff
 ect of 
diff
 erent case defi
 nitions. We have attempted to 
systematically correct for this bias, but this correction is 
based on statistical analysis and not on detailed studies 
in each location. Eighth, our analyses could not account 
for the full range of inequalities that might be experienced 
within countries and subnational administrative areas. 
We have substantially increased the number of 
subnational geographies for GBD 2015, but further 
expansion hinges upon greater data availability and 
stakeholder interest in leading subnational GBD 
analyses. In future iterations of the GBD, we hope to 
further examine the eff
 ects of more localised measures 
of inequality, particularly for income and other 
socioeconomic factors, on child health outcomes across 
geographies. And lastly, as with other estimations of 
under-5 mortality and stillbirth rates, our estimates for 
the most recent years are based on extrapolation using 
our data synthesis models due to data availability. As new 
data from surveys and censuses become available, our 
estimates in the future will certainly be aff
 ected.
Conclusion
Global achievements in improving child survival serve 
as one of the most notable success stories in recent 
times, signifying the eff
 ect of international collaboration 
and focus on ending preventable mortality. Although 
these gains have been near universal across geographies, 
the pace of progress varied markedly, especially in 
terms of what could be expected based on corresponding 
improvements in overall development. Accelerated, 
faster-than-anticipated reductions in under-5 mortality 
occurred between 2000 and 2015 in many lower-income 
countries, highlighting the crucial role of scaling up 
eff
 ective child health interventions above and beyond 
sociodemographic advances. Large decreases in under-5 
deaths due to many infectious diseases contributed to 
reductions in under-5 mortality, strengthening the 
evidence base for tackling these lethal, preventable 
conditions that disproportionately aff
 ect the poor. 
Overall neonatal mortality, death due to specifi
 c 
neonatal causes and congenital anomalies, and 
stillbirths moderately decreased, but such gains were 
mainly concentrated in higher-income countries. In 
evaluating shifts in composition of under-5 mortality 
across epidemiological transitions, the persistent toll of 
neonatal conditions, especially as countries moved 
from low levels of development and eff
 ectively reduced 
under-5 deaths from infectious diseases, is clear. The 
prioritisation of funding and programmes that address 
the risks for neonatal death and stillbirths will probably 
emerge as a vital need for countries where reductions 
in under-5 mortality have stagnated or occurred at a 
slower pace than expected given their level of 
development. As the world shifts away from the MDG 
era and toward the SDGs, we must draw from lessons 
learned from countries where child survival has 
improved the fastest and design targeted, eff
 ective 
strategies to accelerate reductions in child mortality for 
the places with the furthest to go.
