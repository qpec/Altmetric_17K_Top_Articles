Abstract
Incidence rates for liver cancer have increased 3-fold since the
mid-1970s in the United States in parallel with increasing trends
for obesity and type II diabetes mellitus. We conducted an analysis
of baseline body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC),
and type II diabetes mellitus with risk of liver cancer. The Liver
Cancer Pooling Project maintains harmonized data from 1.57
million adults enrolled in 14 U.S.-based prospective studies. Cox
regression estimated HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI)
adjusted for age, sex, study center, alcohol, smoking, race, and
BMI (for WC and type II diabetes mellitus). Stratified analyses
assessed whether the BMI–liver cancer associations differed by
hepatitissera-positivityinnestedanalysesfor asubsetofcases(n ¼
220)andcontrols(n¼ 547).Afterenrollment, 2,162incidentliver
cancer diagnoses were identified. BMI, per 5 kg/m2, was associated
with higher risks of liver cancer, more so for men (HR ¼ 1.38; 95%
CI, 1.30–1.46) than women (HR ¼ 1.25; 95% CI, 1.17–1.35;
Pinteraction ¼ 0.02). WC, per 5 cm, was associated with higher risks
of liver cancer, approximately equally by sex (overall, HR ¼ 1.08;
95% CI, 1.04–1.13). Type II diabetes mellitus was associated with
higher risk of liver cancer (HR ¼ 2.61; 95% CI, 2.34–2.91). In
stratified analyses, there was a null association between BMI and
liver cancer risk for participants who were sera-positive for hep-
atitis. This study suggests that high BMI, high WC, and type II
diabetes mellitus are associated with higher risks of liver cancer
and that the association may differ by status of viral hepatitis
infection. Cancer Res; 76(20); 6076–83. �2016 AACR.
Introduction
Established risk factors for liver cancer include chronic infection
with hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV) viruses and heavy alcohol use
(1, 2). These factors likely increase risk through inducing chronic
hepatic inflammation that may lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis.
Worldwide, most liver cancers (principally, hepatocellular carci-
nomas) occur in developing countries due to the high prevalence
of HBV infection in these areas (3). In some areas of Asia where
widespread HBV vaccination has occurred, incidence rates for
hepatocellular carcinoma are decreasing (3, 4). In contrast, rates
for liver cancer have tripled since the mid-1970s in the United
States (5), in parallel with increasing trends for obesity (6) and
diabetes (principally, type II diabetes mellitus; ref. 7).
Several meta-analyses of primarily Asian- and European-based
prospective cohort studies (8–10) have identified higher risks of
liver cancer with increasing body mass index (BMI), an indicator
of general adiposity. To date, U.S.-based prospective studies on
this topic are especially rare: a 2-fold higher risk of hepatocellular
carcinoma was reported when comparing obese (�30 kg/m2)
with normal BMI (18.5 < 25 kg/m2) in a cohort study of 2,126
cirrhosis patients (11). The few prospective studies that examined
the association between waist circumference (WC), an indicator
of central adiposity, and liver cancer risk are somewhat conflict-
ing, likely due to small sample sizes, but generally suggest higher
risk with increasing WC (12–14). These observations are

 supported by findings that general and central adiposity are
associated with higher risks of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
and the more severe nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, both of which
are major risk factors for liver cancer (15).
Several prospective studies and meta-analyses support a
higher risk of liver cancer incidence and mortality among
persons with diabetes (8, 12, 16–21), but many early studies
were from administrative datasets that were unable to adjust for
important confounders, including BMI, or had short follow-up
times that may have been prone to biases. Prospectively col-
lected data with sufficiently long follow-up time are important
in this context because the clinical diagnosis of liver cancer and
diabetes may coincide (i.e., reverse causation; ref. 22).
We conducted a pooled analysis of individual-level data from
U.S. cohort studies to investigate the associations of BMI, WC, and
type II diabetes mellitus with risk of primary liver cancer, overall
and when stratified by sex and viral hepatitis status.
Materials and Methods
Study population
All U.S.-based studies in the NCI Cohort Consortium (http://
epi.grants.cancer.gov/Consortia/cohort.html) were invited to
participate in the Liver Cancer Pooling Project (LCPP). For this
analysis, 14 studies were included: Health Professionals Follow-
up Study (HPFS); Physicians' Health Study (PHS); NIH-AARP
Diet and Health Study (NIH-AARP); Agricultural Health Study
(AHS); United States Radiologic Technologists Study (USRT);
Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project Follow-Up Study
(BCDDP); Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screen-
ing Trial (PLCO); Women's Health Study (WHS); New York
University Women's Health Study (NYUWHS); Cancer Preven-
tion Study-II Nutrition Cohort (CPS-II); Iowa Women's Health
Study (IWHS); Black Women's Health Study (BWHS); Women's
Health Initiative (WHI); and the Nurses' Health Study (NHS). All
studies were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of their
host centers. All studies submitted deidentified, participant-level
data from their entire study to the LCPP data coordinating center.
Data were centrally harmonized and pooled for analyses as a
single cohort. Some studies with BMI data (CPS-II, PLCO, WHS,
PHS, NYUWHS, HPFS, NHS, and WHI) also provided prediag-
nostic sera samples from a subset of participants for HBV and HCV
serologic testing: liver cancer cases (n ¼ 220) and controls (n ¼
547) were frequency matched 1-to-2 or 1-to-3, depending on
study, based on study, sex, month, and year of blood draw, and
age (1-year). These data were used in nested case–control analyses
to examine potential effect modification by viral hepatitis status
for the association between BMI and liver cancer risk. Cases and
controls with versus without available sera had similar mean BMI
values and prevalence of type II diabetes mellitus (data not
shown).
The following exclusions were applied: diabetes diagnosis
prior to age 30 years (to avoid misclassification from type I
diabetes mellitus), missing age at study entry, missing follow-
up time, and missing all three of BMI, WC, and diabetes. Data
for 1.57 million participants comprised the analytic cohort.
Liver cancer diagnoses (International Classification of Diseases,
10th version: C22.0; ref. 23) were verified after enrollment by
linking to state cancer registries, medical record abstraction,
and/or linking to the National Death Index (NDI). In the
harmonized LCPP dataset, after the above-mentioned exclu-
sions, 2,543 liver cancer cases were initially identified. Partici-
pants who were diagnosed with intrahepatic cholangiocarci-
noma (n ¼ 296) or with another histology that was inconsistent
with hepatocellular carcinoma (n ¼ 85; generally, germ cell
tumors, lymphomas, or mesenchymal tumors) were censored
on their date of diagnosis. Data from 2,162 cases were included
in this analysis (n ¼ 1,335 verified from cancer registries and/or
medical record abstraction; n ¼ 827 verified as deaths from liver
cancer according to NDI linkage).
Exposures
Baseline BMI was calculated from self-reported (all cohort
studies except for WHI) or directly measured (WHI only) weight
(kg) divided by height squared (m2) and categorized according to
World Health Organization criteria (24): underweight (15 < 18.5
kg/m2), normal weight (18.5 < 25 kg/m2), overweight (25–29.9
kg/m2), and obese (�30 kg/m2). Obesity was additionally strat-
ified as classes I (30–34.9 kg/m2), II (35–39.9 kg/m2), and III
(�40 kg/m2).
WC was measured by trained staff (WHI and NYUWHS) or self-
measured (NIH-AARP, PHS, CPS-II, WHS, BCDDP, HPFS, IWHS,
and BWHS) by participants who were given tape measures and
instructions on the protocol. Some cohort studies did not have
WC data available (AHS, USRT, PLCO, and NHS); other studies
evaluated WC after baseline enrollment (NIH-AARP, NYUWHS,
PHS, CPS-II, WHS, and BCDDP). WC, in centimeters (cm), was
categorized in four groups (women: <70, 70–<80, 80–<90, and
90þ; men: <90, 90–<100, 100–<110, and 110þ).
Diabetes was self-reported on the baseline questionnaires of all
14 cohort studies used in this analysis. Wording varied slightly by
study but generally included phrasing such as, "Have you ever
been diagnosed with diabetes by a physician, excluding when you
were pregnant?" Some studies (e.g., CPS-II, WHI, NHS, HPFS)
corroborated a portion of self-reported diabetes via review of
medical records (25, 26).
Smoking was defined according to baseline cigarette smoking
status and categorized as never, former, or current. Alcohol
consumption was queried for consumption in the 3 months to
one year prior to enrollment and defined as nondrinker and,
among persons who consumed alcohol, in categories of grams per
day (grams/day: �1.08, 1.09–3.58, 3.59–13.54, and >13.54).
Race was self-identified and categorized in this study as white,
black/African American, and all other races, including those who
did not report race. All main exposures and covariables were
abstracted and harmonized from baseline study data only. Miss-
ing data were treated with an indicator variable.
Laboratory methods
Serum samples in a subset of participants were analyzed for
markers of HBV and HCV infection. For HBV, hepatitis B surface
antigen (HBsAg) was detected with the Bio-Rad GS HBsAg 3.0
enzyme immunoassay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and antibody to
the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) was detected using the
Ortho HBc ELISA test system (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc.).
For HCV, antibody to the hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) was
detected using the Ortho HCV Version 3.0 ELISA test system
(Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc.), and positive results were con-
firmed using the Chiron RIBA HCV 3.0 SIA (Ortho-Clinical
Diagnostics, Inc.). All assays were conducted in the Protein
Expression Laboratory at the Frederick National Laboratory for
Cancer Research (Frederick, MD).

 Statistical analysis
Cox proportional hazards models estimated HR and 95%
confidence intervals (CI) for the associations of BMI, WC, and
type II diabetes mellitus with liver cancer risk. Follow-up time for
WC analyses began on the date of WC evaluation; cases that were
diagnosed between baseline and WC assessment were excluded
from the WC analyses. All statistical models were analyzed from a
pooled cohort of the combined studies. Initially, Cox models
included only age, study, and sex. Subsequently, more compre-
hensive models included age, study, sex, alcohol consumption,
race, and smoking status. Because education and NSAID use made
no meaningful differences to the HRs of the main exposures, they
were not included in the fully adjusted models. Results for WC
and type II diabetes mellitus are presented with and without
adjustment for BMI. BMI results are presented with and without
adjustment for type II diabetes mellitus. Linear models estimated
associations of BMI (per 5 kg/m2; and per 1 SD and WC (per 5 cm;
and per 1 SD) with liver cancer risk. Wald tests assessed linear
trends.
Unconditional logistic regression assessed the association (OR)
of BMI and liver cancer risk stratified by viral hepatitis status (i.e.,
sera-positive for HBV or HCV vs. sera-negative for both HBV and
HCV) in the nested series of cases and controls with available sera.
The unconditional logistic regression models included the fre-
quency-matching factors (i.e., age, sex, and study). When we
examined whether the associations between BMI and liver cancer
risk differed by hepatitis infection status, we tested multiplicative
interaction terms and likelihood ratio tests.
Sensitivity analyses excluded liver cancers that were diagnosed
in the first 2 and 5 years after baseline and were also restricted to
cases with a confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma histology (n ¼
996; histology codes: 8170–8175). We also conducted two-stage
individual participant meta-analyses to explore potential hetero-
geneity of HRs across studies. Sensitivity analyses also evaluated if
censoring at the time of diagnosis of stomach, colorectal, breast,
lung, and pancreatic cancers had any material effect on the study
results in 9 of the 14 cohorts where those additional data were
available.
Interaction terms with the main exposures (continuous terms
for WC and BMI, and type II diabetes mellitus status defined
categorically) and time tested the proportional hazards assump-
tion of the Cox models. No violations were observed except for
BMI overall (P ¼ 0.002); from visual inspection of the log–log
survival curve, it seems the interaction with time occurs during the
first 3 years of follow-up, wherein the survival curves generally
overlap.
All P values were two-sided; P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. SAS software was used for all statistical analyses (SAS
Institute, Inc., version 9.4).
Results
In this analysis of 1.57 million U.S. adults, 2,162 liver cancers
occurred during 19 million person-years of observation. Supple-
mentary Table S1 shows baseline characteristics of participants:
mean age was 58.2 years, mean BMI was 26.6 kg/m2, mean WC
was 89.8 cm, and the prevalence of type II diabetes mellitus was
6.5%.
The overall and sex-specific associations between BMI and liver
cancer risk are shown in Table 1. Overall, compared with a normal
BMI, overweight, class I obesity, class II obesity, and class III
obesity were associated with 21%, 87%, 142%, and 116% higher
risks of liver cancer, respectively. HRs were higher for men than
women; for both sexes, however, statistically significant higher
risks were observed. There was evidence of between-study het-
erogeneity for this association (I2 ¼ 55.82; P ¼ 0.006; Supple-
mentary Fig. S1).
Overall, continuous WC (per 5 cm) was associated with higher
risks of liver cancer (HR, 1.08), even after adjustment for BMI and
other factors (Table 2). There was no clear evidence that the
association differed by sex. Categorical models for WC and risk
of liver cancer were generally consistent with the continuous
models. There was evidence of between-study heterogeneity
(I2 ¼ 51.52; P ¼ 0.03; Supplementary Fig. S2).
The overall and sex-specific associations between type II dia-
betes mellitus and liver cancer are shown in Table 3. Overall, type
II diabetes mellitus was associated with a greater than 3-fold
increased risk of liver cancer in the minimally adjusted statistical
model. Inclusion of alcohol, smoking, race, and BMI into the Cox
model attenuated the HR to 2.61. There was no strong evidence
that this association differed by sex. There was evidence of
between-study heterogeneity (I2 ¼ 67.33; P < 0.001; Supplemen-
tary Fig. S3).
The joint effect of BMI and type II diabetes mellitus with liver
cancer risk is shown in Supplementary Table S2. Compared with
participants with a normal BMI and no type II diabetes mellitus at
baseline, type II diabetes mellitus was associated with higher risks
of liver cancer at each level of BMI.
In the nested case–control analysis of participants with mea-
sured viral hepatitis status, there was a null association between
BMI and liver cancer risk for participants who were sera-positive
for hepatitis (OR per 5 kg/m2, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.53–1.37),
whereas a higher risk of liver cancer was observed with high
BMI for participants who were sera-negative for hepatitis (OR
per 5 kg/m2, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.36–2.09; Pinteraction ¼ 0.04).
When analyses were restricted to participants that had both WC
and BMI data available, liver cancer risks were similarly increased
for each 1 SD unit increase in WC (HR ¼ 1.35; 95% CI, 1.25–1.45)
and BMI (HR ¼ 1.31; 95% CI, 1.22–1.41). When BMI was added
to the WC model (HR ¼ 1.20; 95% CI, 1.05–1.36), and when WC
was added to the BMI model (HR ¼ 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02–1.29),
both results were attenuated toward the null but still remained
statistically significant.
In sensitivity analyses, the main study findings for BMI, WC,
and type II diabetes mellitus were not materially different after
excluding liver cancers that occurred in the first 2 and 5 years after
baseline (Supplementary Table S3). The main study findings for
BMI, WC, and type II diabetes mellitus were also consistent when
the outcome was restricted to cases with histologically confirmed
hepatocellular carcinoma (Supplementary Tables S4–S6) and
when censoring participants at the time of diagnosis of stomach,
colorectal, pancreatic, breast, and lung cancers (data not shown).
Discussion
BMI, WC, and type II diabetes mellitus were associated with
higher risks of liver cancer in this prospective analysis of 1.57
million participants enrolled in 14 U.S.-based cohort studies.
Higher BMI was associated with liver cancer in a dose–response
manner, and associations were robust after controlling for smok-
ing, alcohol intake, and other risk factors. High WC was associated
with higher risks of liver cancer, and these associations were

 attenuated after including BMI in the statistical models, suggest-
ing shared effects of both BMI and WC on liver cancer risk, perhaps
owing to these phenotypes being correlated with visceral adipos-
ity. Type II diabetes mellitus was a strong predictor of liver cancer
risk,and these results were robust even at nonobese BMI levels and
after controlling for their shared risk factors. Some evidence of
heterogeneity was detected across studies when sensitivity anal-
yses were conducted in individual participant meta-analyses,
which seemed to be the result of our large study sample size and
moderate differences in the magnitude of associations, not their
direction.
Results from several prospective cohort studies (11, 13, 14, 27)
and meta-analyses (9, 10, 28) have indicated an association
between high BMI and higher risk of liver cancer, although many
of the original studies had few liver cancer outcomes and were
often not statistically significant. With data from 2,162 prospec-
tively identified liver cancer cases, this study adds considerably to
the evidence base regarding BMI and this highly fatal cancer. A
recent meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported a
summary HR (1.39 per 5 kg/m2) that was similar to our findings
(28); when stratified by geographic location of the original study,
associations were higher for non-Asian (HR ¼ 1.6; predominantly
Europe) than Asian-based (HR ¼ 1.21) prospective studies. Future
work is warranted to explore potential geographic differences for
this association in finer detail.
Few studies have examined the association between WC and
risk of liver cancer (12–14), and the results are mixed. A large
European cohort study identified 177 liver cancers and reported
HRs for the associations of WC (per 5 cm) and liver cancer risk that
were similar with (HR ¼ 1.29) and without (HR ¼ 1.25) control
for BMI (14). In contrast, in our study of 833 liver cancer cases
with WC data, controlling for BMI attenuated the WC association
closer to the null. From our analyses per 1 SD unit increase in BMI
and WC, it seems that both indicators of adiposity are similarly
predictive of liver cancer risk.
Type II diabetes mellitus was associated with higher risk of liver
cancer in this study, consistent with previous prospective studies
(18, 19, 29, 30). Our pooled LCPP analysis included data from the
NIH-AARP cohort study that previously reported a 2.11-fold
higher risk of liver cancer among participants with versus without
diabetes (19). Similar to the evidence base for BMI, the majority of
studies on diabetes and liver cancer risk were drawn from non-U.
S. populations, often in populations in which HBV infection is
common. An important advantage of the current study was the
long follow-up period and large sample size that allowed for the
exclusion of cases diagnosed in the first 5 years after baseline
enrollment. This exclusion allowed us to conclude that reverse
causation (i.e., undiagnosed liver cancer causing insulin resistance
and, ultimately, diabetes) was not playing a major role in our
observed associations.
Excess adiposity and type II diabetes mellitus likely share
common mechanistic pathways involved in hepatocarcinogen-
esis. As both general and central adiposity increase, so too does
accumulation of adipocytes in the liver (31, 32). Excess adipose
tissue in the liver, in turn, may lead to tissue remodeling (includ-
ing the development of fibrosis and cirrhosis), increased localized
inflammation, and insulin insensitivity/resistance (31, 32). Over
many years, the constellation of these factors may lead to liver
cancer for some patients.
In the nested case–control analyses stratified by viral hepatitis
status, there was a null association between BMI and liver cancer
risk for participants who were sera-positive for hepatitis, whereas
BMI was associated with higher risks of liver cancer for partici-
pants who were sera-negative. These results suggest that obesity is
not an important risk factor for liver cancer in the presence of the
established oncogenic viruses, HCV and HBV. Furthermore, these
results may also help explain why the BMI–liver cancer associa-
tion is often higher in predominantly European than in Asian
populations.
This study has several strengths, including its large sample size,
inclusion of harmonized data on many liver cancer risk factors,
and prospective design with long follow-up times. Several limita-
tions of this study should also be considered, particularly regard-
ing the reliance by most studies on self-reported BMI, self-mea-
sured WC, and self-reported diabetes that are prone to misclas-
sification. Cross-sectional data show that self-reported compared
with directly measured BMI values are typically slightly lower
(33); underreporting of self-reported BMI occurs more often at
higher BMI values, and this trend may overestimate associations
of overweight BMI with risk of liver cancer and concurrently
underestimate the association for obese BMI. Good-to-excellent
agreement was reported, however, in studies with similar demo-
graphic characteristics to this study for self-reported and directly
measured values of height and weight (34, 35). Self-measured and
interviewer-measured WCs are generally strongly correlated, with
correlation coefficients reported in the ranges of 0.8 to 0.9, and
more underreporting occurs at higher levels of WC (36, 37). These
reporting errors, if present in this study, would likely cause an
underestimation of the association between WC and liver cancer.
In addition, we did not harmonize updated exposure information
in this study; for diabetes, this is a particular limitation that would
likely lead to an underestimation of the association. A further
limitation related to diabetes was the absence of data on diabetes
medications (e.g., insulin and metformin) or indicators of glucose
control (e.g., HbA1c). Because we had hepatitis status for only a
small series of cases and controls, we could not stratify by this
important risk factor in our main statistical models. Further
research is needed to investigate whether hepatitis status modifies
the association between BMI and liver cancer risk.
The pooled analysis used for the primary analysis herein
includes a fixed study effect to account for study-specific differ-
ences. Using a fixed study effect theoretically limits the generaliz-
ability of the results to the populations represented by the 14
cohort studies in our analysis; however, as there is close agreement
between the selected meta-analysis results and the pooled anal-
ysis, the generalizability of the latter may be more extensive. The
pooled approach was more appropriate for this analysis because
liver cancer is a rare outcome and the pooled approach is better
able to estimate by gender and exposure category, stable HRs, and
more precise 95% CIs.
This study included data from more than 1.5 million U.S.
adults who were, on average, older at baseline enrollment in
the 1980s and 1990s, non-Hispanic white, non-current smo-
kers, and drank alcohol at low-to-moderate levels. These results
may not generalize to populations with different features,
including those of Hispanic ethnicity and younger populations.
NDI linkage was used as a source for liver cancer outcomes for
some of the cases in this analysis; as liver cancer is rare, this
approach would be expected to have good specificity in large
studies compared with medical record–verified or registry-
linked incidence data; however, it would only have moderate
sensitivity because not all persons who are diagnosed with liver

 cancer will necessarily die from the disease. Nonetheless, when
our analyses were restricted to confirmed hepatocellular carci-
noma incident cases, all of whom were identified from cancer
registry linkage or medical record abstraction, the results were
very similar to the results with the broader case definition that
included NDI cases, suggesting that potential misclassification
of liver cancer cases from NDI linkage did not have any material
effect on the overall interpretation.
In conclusion, this pooled analysis of data from 14 prospective
cohort studies identified robust associations of BMI, WC, and type
II diabetes mellitus with risk of liver cancer. Because liver cancer
has a poor prognosis, even when diagnosed at relatively early
stages, additional efforts are needed to better understand oppor-
tunities for primary prevention of the disease.
