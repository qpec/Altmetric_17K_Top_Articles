Summary
Background Approximately two-thirds of patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) 
need long-term intravenous immunoglobulin. Subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg) is an alternative option for 
immunoglobulin delivery, but has not previously been investigated in a large trial of CIDP. The PATH study compared 
relapse rates in patients given SCIg versus placebo.
Methods Between March 12, 2012, and Sept 20, 2016, we studied patients from 69 neuromuscular centres in North 
America, Europe, Israel, Australia, and Japan. Adults with definite or probable CIDP who responded to intravenous 
immunoglobulin treatment were eligible. We randomly allocated participants to 0·2 g/kg or 0·4 g/kg of a 20% SCIg 
solution (IgPro20) weekly versus placebo (2% human albumin solution) for maintenance treatment for 24 weeks. We 
did randomisation in a 1:1:1 ratio with an interactive voice and web response system with a block size of six, stratified 
by region (Japan or non-Japan). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a CIDP relapse or who were 
withdrawn for any other reason during 24 weeks of treatment. Patients, caregivers, and study personnel, including 
those assessing outcomes, were masked to treatment assignment. Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat and 
per-protocol sets. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01545076.
Findings In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly allocated 172 patients: 57 (33%) to 
the placebo group, 57 (33%) to the low-dose group, and 58 (34%) to the high-dose group. In the intention-to-treat set, 
36 (63% [95% CI 50–74]) patients on placebo, 22 (39% [27–52]) on low-dose SCIg, and 19 (33% [22–46]) on high-dose 
SCIg had a relapse or were withdrawn from the study for other reasons (p=0·0007). Absolute risk reductions were 
25% (95% CI 6–41) for low-dose versus placebo (p=0·007), 30% (12–46) for high-dose versus placebo (p=0·001), and 
6% (–11 to 23) for high-dose versus low-dose (p=0·32). Causally related adverse events occurred in 47 (27%) patients 
(ten [18%] in the placebo group, 17 [30%] in the low-dose group, and 20 [34%] in the high-dose group). Six (3%) 
patients had 11 serious adverse events: one (2%) patient in the placebo group, three (5%) in the low-dose group, and 
two (3%) in the high-dose group; only one (an acute allergic skin reaction in the low-dose group) was assessed to be 
causally related.
Interpretation This study, which is to our knowledge, the largest trial of CIDP to date and the first to study 
two administrations of immunoglobulins and two doses, showed that both doses of SCIg IgPro20 were efficacious 
and well tolerated, suggesting that SCIg can be used as a maintenance treatment for CIDP.

Introduction
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy 
(CIDP) is an acquired neuropathy with an assumed 
autoimmune pathogenesis.1 It runs a progressive, 
relapsing–remitting or monophasic course and can 
substantially limit patients’ activity and participation, 
with decreased quality-of-life expectations.2 Intravenous 
immunoglobulin (IVIg) is a well established therapy for 
patients with the disease, with an estimated two-thirds 
needing these infusions over many years.3 Subcutaneous 
immunoglobulin (SCIg), an alternative route of immuno-
globulin administration, has been used successfully in 
patients with primary immunodeficiency syndromes for 
more than 25 years.4 Systemic side-effects are reduced 
using SCIg compared with IVIg. In an open-label 
prospective study,5 the severity and frequency of headache 
and nausea were significantly reduced after SCIg 
infusions compared with IVIg infusions. Furthermore, 
haemolytic anaemia, which can be seen in IVIg therapy, 
can improve or disappear after a switch to SCIg.6 SCIg is 
absorbed into the bloodstream over 24–72 h, levelling out 
the sharp peak in serum IgG concentration that occurs 
immediately after an intravenous infusion.7 Moreover, 
when the same total dose of IgG is given as 
four weekly SCIg infusions, rather than a single 
intravenous infusion each month, a near-steady-state

IgG concentration will be achieved that is 12–15% higher 
than the trough concentration after the IVIg infusion.8 
These differences in pharmacokinetics probably explain 
the favourable systemic side-effect profile of SCIg 
compared with IVIg.7,9
SCIg infusions are well tolerated, efficacious, and 
preferred by many patients with primary immuno-
deficiency syndromes.10–12 SCIg increases patient autonomy 
and quality of life and leads to cost savings.13–16 Similar 
preference has been suggested in patients with CIDP 
receiving SCIg.17 However, the efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability of weekly SCIg have not been studied in 
an adequately powered, randomised clinical trial 
with appropriate disability outcome measures.18 We 
hypothesised that the proportion of patients having a 
relapse or who are withdrawn from the study for any other 
reason would be reduced by SCIg as compared with 
placebo. Moreover, we wished to establish whether the 
effect was different with different SCIg doses, as most 
studies use a standard IVIg dose developed long ago 
for a different condition (immune thrombocytopenia).19 
We investigated this hypothesis in a trial that compared 
two doses of SCIg IgPro20 (Hizentra; CSL Behring, Bern, 
Switzerland) with placebo for maintenance treatment of 
patients with CIDP.
Methods
Study design and participants
Patients were eligible if they were at least 18 years of 
age and had been diagnosed with definite or probable 
CIDP according to the European Federation of Neurological 
Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society (EFNS/PNS) 2010 
criteria20 and if they received their last IVIg treatment at 
least within 8 weeks before enrolment. Exclusion criteria 
were any polyneuropathy of other causes; any other disease 
that could cause neurological symptoms and signs or 
could interfere with treatment or outcome assessments; 
severe conditions that could interfere with satisfactory 
conduct of the study; history of thrombotic episodes within 
2 years before enrolment; known allergic or other severe 
reactions to blood products, including intolerance to 
previous IVIg, history of haemolysis after IVIg infusion, 
aseptic meningitis, recurrent severe headache, hyper-
sensitivity, or severe generalised skin reaction; use of 
prohibited medication; a serum IgA concentration of less 
than 5% of the lower limit of normal; HIV or hepatitis B or 
C; abnormal laboratory variables; pregnancy or being a 
nursing mother; intention to become pregnant during the 
course of the study; and being a female patient of 
childbearing potential either not using or not willing to use 
a medically reliable method of contraception for the 
duration of the study. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria 
are provided in the appendix. All included patients gave 
written informed consent before study entry. The study 
protocol was approved by the ethics committees of all 
participating centres. The trial protocol has been published 
previously.21
Randomisation and masking
We randomly allocated patients into three groups using an 
interactive voice and web response system maintained by 
Parexel (Berlin, Germany). Treatment allocation was in a 
1:1:1 ratio with use of block randomisation with a block size 
of six, stratified by region (Japan or non-Japan). Access to 
the randomisation list was restricted to Parexel personnel 
not involved in the conduct or analysis of the trial. 
All patients, caregivers, and study personnel, including 
those assessing outcomes, were masked and unaware of 
treatment assignment. We took standard measures for 
placebo and IgPro20 (eg, same container and closure 
system, storage conditions, colour, and foaming pro-
perties) to ensure adequate masking. We implemented a 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed (from date of inception to Sept 26, 2017), 
with the search terms “subcutaneous immunoglobulin”, “CIDP”, 
and “clinical trial”. No clinical trials investigating the efficacy, 
safety, and tolerability of subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg) 
in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) 
had been published before the start of our study in 
March 12, 2012. Two case reports described seven patients who 
were successfully switched from intravenous immunoglobulin 
to SCIg. Since the start of our study, two small 
placebo-controlled randomised trials have been published 
investigating SCIg in patients with CIDP. Both trials showed 
promising results on impairment. A 1 year open-label follow-up 
study has suggested that SCIg could be used as long-term 
maintenance treatment. Several open-label case series and one 
large prospective observational study have reported clinical 
efficacy and safety of weekly SCIg.
Added value of this study
This is, to our knowledge, the first randomised trial that has 
studied two SCIg doses in CIDP after IVIg stabilisation. This 
study showed that SCIg can be used as a treatment for 
patients with CIDP. Our findings indicate that both doses are 
efficacious in maintaining patients and preventing relapse. 
Both doses of IgPro20 were well tolerated, with a good safety 
profile. The most frequently reported adverse events were 
local reaction at the infusion site; most of the local reactions 
were mild.
Implications of all the available evidence
The data from this study support a weekly subcutaneous dose 
of 0·2–0·4g/kg. Maintenance SCIg dose should be individualised 
on the basis of patient situation and previous intravenous 
immunoglobulin dose and frequency.

two-physician approach to reduce the chance of potential 
study unmasking. The treating physician was the primary 
contact for the patient and was responsible for all patient-
related questions, adverse event assessment, and all other 
study-related tasks. A second assessing physician was 
responsible for assessment of efficacy variables. The 
assessing physician did not have access to any data 
collected by the treating physician.
Procedures
After screening, all eligible patients progressed through 
three study periods: an IgG dependency test period 
(up to 12 weeks), an IVIg restabilisation period (up to 
13 weeks), and a randomised subcutaneous treatment 
period (24 weeks of treatment with a final assessment at 
week 25; appendix). The IgG dependency test period was 
necessary to ensure that only patients who were still in 
need of IgG were randomly allocated. Only patients who 
were established to be IgG dependent were enrolled in 
the IVIg restabilisation period. In this period, patients 
received a 10% IVIg solution (IgPro10 [Privigen; CSL 
Behring]) using the EFNS/PNS guideline-recommended 
dose of 2 g/kg induction followed by 1 g/kg every 
3 weeks.20 We deemed standardised IVIg restabilisation 
necessary 
before 
initiation 
of 
placebo-controlled 
randomised subcutaneous treatment with IgPro20 or 
placebo. Only patients whose Inflammatory Neuropathy 
Cause and Treatment (INCAT) total score improved 
during the IVIg restabilisation period to at least the 
INCAT total score recorded at the screening visit, and 
who maintained a stable INCAT total score during the 
last 3 weeks of the restabilisation period, were eligible for 
randomisation.
During the subcutaneous treatment period, we cal-
culated the total volume needed for all three treatment 
groups on the basis of bodyweight. We volume-matched 
all three treatments to high-dose volume requirement. 
One group received IgPro20 at 0·4 g/kg, one group 
received IgPro20 at 0·2 g/kg plus placebo (2% human 
albumin solution) to match volume, and one group 
received only placebo. We did the subcutaneous infusion 
of IgPro20 or placebo during 1 or 2 consecutive days in 
two sessions using infusion pumps, every week for 
24 weeks. SCIg infusions were self-administered or 
administered by a caregiver at home, after site training. 
For monitoring of treatment compliance (appendix), 
patients had to fill out a drug accountability form, which 
was checked by the investigator and funder. Patients had 
to return all vials to the investigative site. We did a 
completion visit for all patients after completion of the 
subcutaneous treatment period or withdrawal for any 
reason during this period. We rescued patients who 
relapsed during the subcutaneous treatment period, 
within 1 week, with 10% IVIg solution (IgPro10; 2 g/kg 
induction and 1 g/kg maintenance) and discontinued 
them from the study after rescue. Patients had the option 
to enter an open-label extension study (NCT02027701) 
after completing the PATH study. The extension study 
has been completed and is currently being analysed.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who 
had a CIDP relapse or were withdrawn from the study for 
any reason during the 24 week subcutaneous treatment 
period. We defined a CIDP relapse as a deterioration 
(ie, increase) by at least 1 point in the total adjusted INCAT 
score (range 0 [healthy] to 10 [unable to make any 
purposeful movements with arms or legs])22 at any sub-
cutaneous treatment period visit compared with baseline. 
We defined baseline scores as the scores assessed at the 
end of the IVIg restabilisation period.
Secondary outcomes for the subcutaneous treatment 
period were time to the primary endpoint, INCAT score, 
mean grip strength for both hands separately as assessed 
with use of the handheld Martin Vigorimeter,23 Medical 
Research Council sum score (range 0–80; including 
shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, wrist extension, index 
finger abduction, hip flexion, knee extension, foot dorsi-
flexion, and great toe dorsiflexion),24 and Inflammatory 
Neuropathy-Rasch-Built Overall Disability Scale (I-RODS; 
range 0 [most severe activity and social participation 
limitations] to 100 [no activity and social participation 
limitations]).25 We assessed INCAT scores, grip strength, 
Medical Research Council sum score, and I-RODS at 
screening, during the IgG dependency test period, before 
IVIg infusions during the IVIg restabilisation period, at 
baseline, at all visits during the subcutaneous treatment 
period including the completion visit (including for 
patients who had rescue therapy), and at any unscheduled 
visit. To assess safety and tolerability, we established 
adverse events per infusion and the number and 
percentage of patients with adverse events.
We also measured various exploratory outcomes. We 
assessed quality of life using the EuroQoL 5-Dimension 
Questionnaire, 14-item Treatment Satisfaction Question-
naire for Medication, and Work Productivity and Activity 
Impairment Questionnaire for General Health.26 The 
Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication 
captures ease of use on a 7 point scale, ranging from 
extremely difficult to extremely easy. We assessed patient’s 
preference with a questionnaire at the end of the study. 
Furthermore, we measured serum IgG trough concen-
trations (before administration of study drug). We also 
assessed the effect of IgPro20 on nerve conduction. All 
outcomes for the two prerandomisation periods and 
rescue treatment and other exploratory outcomes (Work 
Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire for 
General Health and effect of IgPro2 on nerve conduction) 
will be reported separately.
Statistical analysis
We based sample size calculation on the null hypothesis 
that the proportion of patients relapsed or withdrawn 
during subcutaneous treatment would be equal in all

groups and the alternative hypothesis that at least one of 
the SCIg dose groups would have a lower proportion than 
would the placebo group. We assumed that the proportion 
of patients who reached the primary endpoint would be 
35% for the high dose, 52% for the low dose, and 65% for 
placebo.21 We based these numbers on data from the ICE 
study22 extension period. Using the exact Cochran-
Armitage trend test with equally spaced scores and a one-
sided significance level of 0·025, a sample size of 58 was 
needed in each treatment group to achieve a power of 90% 
in an intention-to-treat analysis on the basis of the above 
assumptions. Accounting for patients who would not pass 
the IgG dependency test and IVIg restabilisation period, 
we expected that 350 patients would need to be screened to 
ensure that 174 patients were randomly allocated.
We used the exact Cochran-Armitage trend test for the 
primary outcome to test for a trend over the three trial 
arms at a one-sided type I error of 0·025. If the hypothesised 
superiority could be shown, one-sided Fisher’s exact tests 
were to be used for the subsequent pairwise comparisons: 
placebo versus low-dose IgPro20, placebo versus high-dose 
IgPro20, and low-dose versus high-dose IgPro20. We 
calculated the proportions and corresponding two-sided 
95% Wilson score CIs for each treatment group. We 
calculated point estimates for the difference in proportions 
and the corresponding exact two-sided 95% CIs for all 
pairwise treatment com 
parisons. Three prespecified 
sensitivity analyses with modified primary endpoint 
definitions investigated the potential bias for any reason 
other than relapse. First, all patients who withdrew from 
the study for reasons other than relapse were assumed not 
to have had a relapse. Second, patients who had a relapse, 
including patients who were withdrawn because the 
investigator advised that the patient’s safety or wellbeing 
could be com 
promised by further participation in the 
study and patients who received prohibited medication, 
were com 
pared with those without a relapse, including 
those who were withdrawn for any other reasons. Third, 
patients with a relapse were compared with those without 
a relapse, excluding those who were withdrawn from the 
study.20 We also did two time-to-event analyses and derived 
Kaplan-Meier estimates. In the first, we con 
sidered 
patients who withdrew or relapsed to have reached the 
primary endpoint; in the second, withdrawals for reasons 
other than relapse contributed to a censored primary 
outcome. We did between-group comparisons using the

log-rank test for trend. When an overall trend was shown, 
we did subsequent pairwise one-sided comparisons using 
the log-rank test.
We present secondary endpoints as median changes 
from baseline and compare them between the three 
groups using the asymptotic Jonckheere-Terpstra test.27 We 
did pairwise comparisons on the basis of median changes 
from baseline using one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests. 
We accounted for multiple testing for the primary analysis 
by using a closed testing procedure. All other comparisons 
are not adjusted and therefore considered exploratory.
The primary outcome was assessed in the intention-to-
treat and per-protocol sets.21 Secondary endpoints were 
assessed in the intention-to-treat set. Safety was assessed 
in the safety dataset, including all randomly allocated 
patients who received at least one dose of study drug. We 
calculated the rate per infusion as the number of events 
divided by the overall number of infusions in the respective 
treatment groups.
During the trial, the protocol was amended five times 
(appendix). Two changes were made to increase recruit-
ment: amendment 3 introduced two other measures to 
define IgG dependency (grip strength and I-RODS) 
and amendment 4 deleted one inclusion criterion, 
reducing the length of time required for prestudy IVIg 
from 9 months to 8 weeks. As a consequence of 
amendment 3, we increased the sample size from 150 to 
174. Approx 
imately half of the study population was 
recruited after amendment 3. 40 patients who were 
recruited met the newly introduced criteria. We introduced 
amendment 1 before the study started recruitment, no 
patients were enrolled under amendment 2 because all 
amendment 2 changes were incorportated into amend-
ment 3, and amendment 5 was an update to insert new 
safety language.21
The study was overseen by an independent data and 
safety monitoring board, which did an unmasked formal 
interim analysis for futility on the basis of the outcome 
data of 60 patients completing 3 months of treatment. This 
trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT01545076.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study together with a steering committee 
was responsible for the design of the trial and the data 
analysis and contributed to data interpretation and writing 
of the report. A statistician (NvG) was a member of the 
steering committee and critically reviewed all results. The 
funder had no role in data collection. All authors had full 
access to all data in the study and the corresponding author 
had final responsibility for the decision to submit for 
publication.
Results
Between March 12, 2012, and Sept 20, 2016, we studied 
patients from 69 neuromuscular centres in North 
America, Europe, Israel, Australia, and Japan, with the 
last patient visit on Sept 20, 2016. We screened 276 patients 
 
(figure 1). Of these, 245 (89%) entered the IgG dependency 
test period. 28 (11%) patients were considered not IgG 
dependent and nine (4%) withdrew for other reasons. 
One (<1%) additional patient who was IgG dependent 
withdrew consent before IgPro10 dosing. 22 (11%) of the 
207 patients who received IgPro10 were not restabilised 
after a maximum of 13 weeks and were withdrawn 
(4-week post-study follow-up information was obtained in 
16 [73%] of these 22 patients, revealing that nine [56%] 
eventually restabilised). Fourteen (7%) withdrew for other 
reasons. 172 (83%) patients were randomly allocated and 
received treatment: 57 (33%) patients were assigned to 
placebo, 57 (33%) to low-dose SCIg, and 58 (34%) to high-
dose SCIg. All 172 randomly allocated patients received 
their allocated treatment and 5722 (>99%) of 5739 planned 
volumes were actually administered. Patients tolerated 
volumes of up to 50 mL per injection site, with two to 
eight infusion sites running in parallel and an infusion 
rate of up to 50 mL/h per site (six patients); maximum 
total infusion volume was 140 mL, which was applied in 
two patients. Infusion time was approximately 1 h. No 
patients were lost to follow-up. Table 1 shows the baseline 
characteristics. Patients in the three groups were similar 
in demographic, clinical, disability-related, disease-related, 
and treatment-related characteristics at baseline, except 
for sex, with more men in the low-dose group than in the 
high-dose group and placebo group.

36 (63% [95% CI 50–74]) in the placebo group, 22 (39% 
[27–52]) in the low-dose group, and 19 (33% [22–46]) in 
the high-dose group (Cochran-Armitage trend test 
p=0·0007; table 2). The absolute risk reduction (ARR) for 
reaching the primary endpoint was 25% (6–41) in the 
low-dose group (p=0·007) and 30% (12–46) in the high-
dose group (p=0·001) as compared with placebo. 
Comparing low dose with high dose, the ARR was 
6% (–11 to 23; p=0·32). The sensitivity analyses showed 
that the patients who withdrew for reasons other than 
relapse did not influence the primary endpoint outcome. 
47 (81%) of 58 patients in the high-dose group and 
38 (67%) of 57 in the low-dose group remained relapse 
free (relapse sensitivity analysis).
The probability of reaching the primary endpoint was 
significantly lower in both SCIg groups than in the 
placebo group (figure 2, table 3). We did a complementary 
time-to-relapse analysis censoring all withdrawals at the 
time of withdrawal: both SCIg doses were better than 
placebo. Both IgPro20 doses were associated with lower 
relapse rates as compared with placebo (table 3) and the 
probability of a relapse was lower at all timepoints between 
week 3 and week 25 of subcutaneous treatment in patients 
receiving IgPro20 when compared with those receiving 
placebo (figure 2). Using results for probability of relapse 
by 24 weeks (table 3), the probability of remaining relapse 
free was estimated to be 77·6% in the high-dose group, 
65·0% in the low-dose group, and 41·2% in the placebo 
group. The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one 
relapse was 2·7 for high-dose IgPro20 and 4·4 for low-
dose IgPro20. All per-protocol analyses supported the 
results of the intention-to-treat analysis (table 2).
16 (9%) patients withdrew for reasons other than relapse 
during subcutaneous treatment (four [7%] in the placebo 
group, three [5%] in the low-dose group, and nine [16%] in 
the high-dose group): two (1%) patients withdrew for 
adverse events (one [2%] each in the low-dose group and 
high-dose group; one [2%] event related to subcutaneous 
treatment in the low-dose group); 13 (8%) patients withdrew 
consent (three [5%] in the placebo group, two [4%] in the 
low-dose group, and eight [14%] in the high-dose group); 
and one (2%) was withdrawn by physician decision (in the 
placebo group; figure 1). Subsequent investigation after

database lock revealed that six (3%) patients withdrew 
consent because of issues with subcutaneous infusions 
(three [all in the high-dose group] for mild local reactions, 
two [one in the low-dose group and one in the placebo 
group] did not feel comfortable with the subcutaneous 
technique, and one [in the high-dose group] no longer 
wanted to participate because of a need to travel abroad). 
62 (36%) patients relapsed after randomisation (32 [56%] 
in the placebo group vs 19 [33%] in the low-dose group vs 
11 [19%] in the high-dose group; figure 1), of whom 
56 (90%) were treated with rescue IgPro10 (32 [57%] vs 
16 [29%] vs eight [14%]): 23 (41%) patients received 
one induction dose (standard rescue protocol before 
protocol amendment 3: 12 [52%] vs six [26%] vs five [22%]) 
and 33 (59%) received one induction dose and up to 
four maintenance doses (standard rescue protocol after 
protocol amendment 3: 20 [61%] vs ten [30%] vs three [9%]). 
Patients were then discontinued from the main PATH 
study to continue either with the extension study or with 
their standard-of-care treatment. 23 (70%) of 33 patients 
who received more than one IgPro10 dose recovered 
(returned to at least baseline INCAT score; assessed at last 
study visit), which was similar to the recovery rate based 
solely on adjusted INCAT score during the restabilisation 
period (151 [73%] of 207 patients).
Median changes from baseline in secondary outcome 
variables showed similar patterns to the primary outcome 
across the different treatment groups (table 4). All 
median changes in the high-dose and low-dose groups 
were significantly better than with placebo except for

I-RODS score in the low-dose group. We observed no 
significant differences between the two dose groups. 
Health-related quality-of-life measures generally showed 
better outcomes for both SCIg groups than for placebo 
(appendix). 135 (88%) patients reported that learning the 
technique of self-administration was easy (42 [93%] in 
the placebo group, 49 [91%] in the low-dose group, and 
44 [80%] in the high-dose group). 61 (53%) of 115 patients 
who received SCIg preferred their current treatment 
(30 [53%] in the low-dose group and 31 [53%] in the high-
dose group) versus 22 (39%) of 57 patients who received 
placebo, whereas 21 (18%) patients receiving SCIg 
(ten [18%] and 11 [19%]) and 14 (25%) patients receiving 
placebo preferred their previous IVIg treatment. Reasons 
for patients preferring weekly SCIg to monthly IVIg 
included a gain in independence and fewer side-effects. 
At the last postsubcutaneous dose observation, serum 
trough IgG concentrations had decreased in the placebo 
group, remained stable in the low-dose group, and 
increased in the high-dose group (appendix).
In the placebo group, 21 (37%) patients had 52 adverse 
events over 1514 infusions (table 5, appendix). In the 
low-dose group, 33 (58%) patients had 158 adverse events 
over 2007 infusions; in the high-dose group, 30 (52%) had 
114 events over 2218 infusions. Causally related adverse 
events occurred in 47 (27%) patients (ten [18%] in the 
placebo group, 17 [30%] in the low-dose group, and 
20 [35%] in the high-dose group). All 110 local reactions

in the low-dose group, and 49 events in 17 [29%] patients in 
the high-dose group) were either mild (104 [95%]) or 
moderate (six [5%]), frequency decreased during the first 
eight infusions (appendix), and none led to discontinuation. 
11 serious adverse events were encountered in six (3%) 
patients: one event in one (2%) patient who was receiving 
placebo, five events in three (5%) patients in the low-dose 
group, and five events in two (3%) patients in the high-
dose group. Only one of those 11 serious adverse events 
was assessed to be causally related: in the low-dose group, 
one patient developed an acute allergic skin reaction. This 
event led to discontinuation of treatment. No haemolysis 
or thrombosis occurred during the subcutaneous 
treatment period. Patients using higher infusion rates 
reported similar proportions of adverse events as those 
using lower infusion rates (appendix).
Discussion
This randomised trial in patients with CIDP is, to our 
knowledge, the largest to date and the first investigating 
two doses of SCIg in parallel. The study showed that both 
doses of IgPro20 were efficacious in maintaining stable 
disease over 24 weeks in patients who were previously 
shown to be dependent on IVIg treatment. The primary 
endpoint occured more often in the placebo group than 
in both SCIg groups. This result was achieved using a 
conservative endpoint including not only patients who 
relapsed but also those who were withdrawn for any 
other reason. 76–81% of patients in the high-dose group 
and 65–67% in the low-dose group remained relapse free 
in three sensitivity analyses accounting for premature 
withdrawal of patients with no relapse defined in 
different ways. These analyses, along with the secondary 
outcome measures and health-related quality-of-life 
measures, supported these results, as did the per-protocol 
analyses. We did not find a large difference in secondary 
outcomes, possibly because our study was designed to 
show whether or not IgPro20 could maintain the 
improvement achieved during the IVIg restabilisation 
period, and patients were discontinued at the time of 
relapse to prevent them from deteriorating further. Both 
doses of IgPro20 were well tolerated when given in high 
volumes with use of multiple injection sites. Reasons for 
patients preferring weekly SCIg to monthly IVIg were a 
gain in independence and fewer side-effects. Local 
reactions were mostly mild, their frequency was low, and 
they decreased considerably over time.
Our trial used a unique design. We used an IgG 
dependency test period to ensure that only patients who 
were still in need of IgG were randomly allocated. For a 
trial investigating maintenance treatment in CIDP, the 
necessity of inclusion of a run-in period in which the 
IVIg dose is reduced or withheld to prove IgG dependency 
became clear during the RMC trial28 and also from the 
randomised withdrawal period of the ICE trial,22 with 
most patients in the placebo group not worsening within 
24 weeks. During the second phase, patients all received 
standard doses of IgPro10 to ensure standardised IVIg 
restabilisation conditions. Each phase had specific rules 
that had to be fulfilled by a patient to enter the next phase 
to ensure that all patients were at their best maintenance 
level before randomisation and assignment to IgPro20 or 
placebo. We based the IVIg loading and maintenance 
doses for the restabilisation period on the EFNS/PNS 
guidelines20 and evidence from a large international 
study.22 We designed the study to show whether or not 
IgPro20 could maintain the improvement achieved 
during the IVIg restabilisation period.
Our findings are in accordance with several SCIg 
studies. Two small placebo-controlled randomised trials 
have been published investigating SCIg in patients with 
CIDP: the first29 included 30 patients who were treated 
with IVIg and switched to SCIg for 12 weeks; the second30 
included 19 previously untreated patients. Both showed 
promising results for impairment, with an increase in 
muscle strength and improvement in disability. A 1 year 
open-label follow-up study31 has suggested that SCIg 
could be used as long-term maintenance treatment. 
Open-label case series and a large prospective 
observational study have reported clinical efficacy and 
safety of weekly SCIg.16,18,32
In patients receiving high-dose IgPro20, the ARR for 
reaching a relapse only was 37%, with a corresponding 
NNT of 2·7
. A Cochrane Review33 of IVIg for CIDP has 
summarised all trials comparing IVIg with placebo. 
The review reports that a significantly higher 
proportion of patients had improved disability within 
6 weeks after the onset of treatment with IVIg than 
with placebo, with a risk reduction of 2·40 (95% CI 
1·72–3·36) and an NNT of 3·03 (2·33–4·55). For the 
parallel design trials only, the risk reduction was 2·14 
(1·48–3·09) and the NNT was 3·33 (2·38–5·88). The 
NNT for SCIg to prevent relapse in this study is 
therefore in a similar range to the NNT for IVIg found 
in previous studies.
CIDP guidelines20 suggest a maintenance dose for IVIg 
ranging from 0·4 g/kg to 1·2 g/kg every 2–6 weeks. This 
dose would translate into a maximum dose of 0·2–0·6 g/kg 
every week. In previous studies, weekly doses from 
0·1 g/kg to 0·4 g /kg were administered subcutaneously 
by converting the intravenous dose 1:1 to an equivalent 
subcutaneous dose. After switching 1:1 from IVIg to SCIg, 
small dose increases were observed, ranging from 6% in 
almost half of patients31 to 20% in a few patients.32 In one 
study17 after a follow-up period of 33 months, dose had 
been increased on average by only 2% to maintain clinical 
stability. In our trial, an IVIg dose requirement of more 
than 1·6 g/kg every 4 weeks was an exclusion criterion. 
The two doses tested in our study (0·2 g/kg and 0·4 g/kg 
weekly) were based on the IVIg maintenance dose 
recommended by the EFNS/PNS guidelines20 for CIDP 
(1 g/kg every 3 weeks, equivalent to 0·33 g/kg weekly). 
The high-dose SCIg is thus 21% higher and the lower dose 
39% lower than this recommended dose.

Our study has some limitations. First, we did not 
compare IgPro20 directly with IVIg. A direct comparison 
needs an inferiority design. We considered this design, 
but the results of the power calculations meant that we 
would need an unfeasible number of patients, which 
makes such a study impossible to complete within an 
acceptable timeframe. Second, our IgG dependency test 
was not perfect in the sense that we were able to select 
only those patients who were IgG dependent. CIDP is a 
disease with a highly variable disease course and 
patients have an intrinsic chance of relapsing over time. 
We know from previous studies that this relapsing 
occurs in treated and untreated patients, although with 
treatment chance of relapse can be significantly 
reduced.22,33 In our study, 37% of IgG-dependent patients 
(excluding four who discontinued the study for reasons 
other than adjusted INCAT-defined relapse) on placebo 
did not relapse. In the ICE trial,22 15 (58%) of 26 patients 
who responded during the first phase and were 
randomly allocated to placebo in the second phase did 
not relapse. The lower non-relapse rate in patients in 
the placebo group in our trial than in the ICE trial 
suggests that the IgG dependency test had the intended 
effect of selecting patients who were still dependent on 
IgG. Third, a con 
siderable number of patients had 
missing data for the exploratory outcomes, especially 
for the preference question. Finally, we did not follow 
up on patients who were withdrawn for other reasons or 
rescued during the subcutaneous phase of our trial, 
apart from patients who entered the extension study. 
Therefore, we do not know the exact fate of all of those 
patients.
What are the practical implications of our study? 
Patients on a standard regimen of IVIg can be safely 
transitioned to SCIg. Our findings indicate that both 
SCIg doses are efficacious in maintaining patients with 
CIDP and preventing relapse. The potential of relapse 
risk reduction with SCIg is similar to what has been 
observed in studies of IVIg. We have used SCIg doses 
that were 21% higher (high-dose) and 39% lower (low-
dose) than a 1:1 conversion of 1g/kg IVIg given every 
3 weeks. In accordance with treatment guidelines that 
recommend individualisation of IgG dose, we suggest 
that SCIg is given in doses of 0·2–0·4 g/kg, with the 
final maintenance dose to be determined on the basis of 
patient situation, clinical response, and previous IVIg 
dose and frequency. This large long-term treatment trial 
of SCIg therefore supports a weekly SCIg dose range of 
0·2–0·4 g/kg and shows that SCIg can be used as a 
maintenance treatment in patients with CIDP.
