Dopamine D2/D3 imbalance during
migraine attack and allodynia in vivo
ABSTRACT
Objective: To evaluate in vivo the dynamics of endogenous dopamine (DA) neurotransmission dur-
ing migraine ictus with allodynia.
Methods: We examined 8 episodic migraineurs and 8 healthy controls (HC) using PET with [11C]
raclopride. The uptake measure of [11C]raclopride, nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND),
would increase when there was a reduction in endogenous DA release. The opposite is true for
a decrease in [11C]raclopride BPND. Patients were scanned twice: one PET session was during
a spontaneous migraine ictus at rest, followed by a sustained thermal pain threshold (STPT)
challenge on the trigeminal region, eliciting an allodynia experience; another was during interictal
phase.
Results: Striatal BPND of [11C]raclopride in migraineurs did not differ from HC. We found a signif-
icant increase in [11C]raclopride BPND in the striatum region of migraineurs during both headache
attack and allodynia relative to interictal phase. However, when compared to the migraine attack
at rest, migraineurs during the STPT challenge had a significant sudden reduction in [11C]raclopr-
ide BPND in the insula. Such directional change was also observed in the caudate of HC relative to
the interictal phase during challenge. Furthermore, ictal changes in [11C]raclopride BPND in mi-
graineurs at rest were positively correlated with the chronicity of migraine attacks, and negatively
correlated with the frequency during challenge.
Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that there is an imbalanced uptake of [11C]raclopride
during the headache attack and ictal allodynia, which indicates reduction and fluctuation in ictal
endogenous DA release in migraineurs. Moreover, the longer the history and recurrence of
migraine attacks, the lower the ictal endogenous DA release. Neurology® 2017;88:1634–1641

Globally, migraine has an estimated prevalence of 14.7%.1 Considering the headache attack
(ictal) phase alone, migraine is universally ranked seventh among specific causes of disability due
to the severe pain and increased sensitivity to innocuous stimuli from the environment, includ-
ing allodynia.2 Ultimately, these symptoms force patients’ isolation until the attack resolves.
Recently, MRI-based studies have revealed, in migraineurs, functional and structural changes in
brain regions that are not commonly associated with the sensory-discriminative processing of
pain,3 including sensory cortex and insula.4 One of these regions is the basal ganglia (BG),
especially the striatum,5 where dopamine (DA) plays a crucial role in multiple tasks, for instance
pain modulation. Interestingly, migraine has been associated with a higher prevalence of DA-
deficient disorders including Parkinson disease and restless legs syndrome.6,7 Yet, in emergency
care departments, DA receptor antagonists are commonly prescribed to provide relief to children
and adults during attacks.8,9 DA function in acute migraine and treatment in vivo are unknown.

 In addition, MRI-based10 and animal stud-
ies11,12 have not revealed the central dopami-
nergic mechanisms of the migraine attack
experience in humans.
Here, we studied episodic migraineurs dur-
ing a non-drug-induced spontaneous migraine
attack (ictal phase) and during a nonheadache
phase (interictal) using PET with [11C]raclopr-
ide, a selective radiotracer for DA D2/D3
receptors, mostly in the striatal regions.13,14
We hypothesized that patients with episodic
migraine would have an imbalance in DA
release, based on the uptake of [11C]raclopride
levels, during the headache attack and allody-
nia in vivo.
METHODS Standard protocol approvals, registrations,
and patient consents. University of Michigan institutional
review board approval (HUM00027383) was obtained. All pa-
tients provided written informed consent before enrollment.
Participants and protocol. Eight patients with episodic
migraine, diagnosed according to the International Classification
of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3-beta),15 were enrolled in the
study with 8 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). After
an initial phone prescreening, and screening appointment, writ-
ten informed consent was obtained, followed by full evaluation by
a pain specialist to confirm the diagnosis. The clinical charac-
teristics of migraineurs and allodynia are summarized in table 1.
Patients were excluded in case of pregnancy, current use of pre-
ventive migraine medications, opiate or hormonal contraceptive
use in the 6 months prior to enrollment, or presence of comorbid
chronic pain or other neurologic disorders. The protocol con-
sisted of 1 screening appointment, 1 MRI session, and 2 PET
sessions. One PET scan occurred during the interictal phase, and
another during the ictal phase, in which participants were in-
structed to tolerate all headache symptoms without abortive
medication until the scan was completed.
PET sessions required participants to be headache-free for at
least 48 hours prior to the scan time, in addition to having
abstained from abortive medications. All PET appointments were
scheduled in advance; however, for the ictal PET scan, patients
were contacted by phone the morning of the session by the pain
specialist to confirm the presence of a spontaneous migraine
attack (ICHD-3-beta15). If a migraine attack was absent, the
PET session was rescheduled. For female participants, PET ses-
sions were scheduled during 2 separate mid-late follicular phases
to assure similar hormonal status. During each step of the pro-
tocol, participants recorded their headache pain intensity and area
of pain (described elsewhere16) on a mobile application developed
in-house (GeoPain; MoxyTech LLC).
Neuroimaging acquisition. Both 90-minute PET scans with
[11C]raclopride were acquired with a Siemens (Knoxville, TN)
HR1 scanner in 3D mode (reconstructed full-width at half
maximum resolution of ;5.5 mm in-plane and 5.0 mm axially)
with septa retracted and scatter correction. Radiotracer synthesis
was done using a cyclotron in the vicinity. Each [11C]raclopride
dose of 15 6 1 mCi (555 6 37 MBq), #50 mg, was adminis-
tered 50% as a bolus with the remainder continuously infused
throughout of the scan using a computer-controlled pump to
achieve steady-state tracer levels approximately 30 minutes after
tracer administration. A light forehead restraint was used to
eliminate head movement. Twenty-one sets of scans were
acquired over 90 minutes with an increasing duration (30 seconds
up to 10 minutes). During the PET early phase (30–40 minutes),
participants were resting without challenge, which was followed
by a sustained thermal pain threshold (STPT) challenge during
the late phase (60–90 minutes).
Axial T1-weighted anatomic MRI scans were acquired on
a 3T scanner (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI) using fast spoiled
gradient recalled echo, echo time 3.4, repetition time 10.5, inver-
sion time 200, flip angle 258, field of view 24 cm, 1.5-mm-thick
slices, number of excitations 1, and acquisition matrix 256 3
256, 60 slices.
STPT challenge: PET. This challenge, developed in-house,17
was applied on the trigeminal ophthalmic region to test thermal
sensitivity and cutaneous allodynia during the late phase of the
PET session. A 16 mm2 thermal probe (Pathway model; ME-
DOC, Ramat Yishai, Israel) was applied to the forehead area (V1)
ipsilateral to the headache and, starting from a baseline of 328C,
multiple ascending heat cycles occurred at a constant rate
(increasing 18C/s). The participant controlled the heat intensity,
as participants were instructed to click a mouse at the first

 perception of pain to instantly return temperature to baseline
level. The heat cycles recurred every 10 seconds for 20 minutes
(40–60 minutes post [11C]raclopride injection) during PET, and
multiple measurements were recorded to provide the average pain
threshold of each PET.
Neuroimaging preprocessing and analysis. All image data
were analyzed from 30 to 40 minutes post tracer administration
for the binding potential changes related to the resting state,
and 60–90 minutes for the STPT analysis. For each partici-
pant, the MRI scans were linearly coregistered to the PET images
using a mutual information algorithm,18 and then warped to
Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) International Consor-
tium of Brain Mapping space using DARTEL. The PET images
were normalized into MNI space with the resulting deformation
parameters, resampled to 2-mm voxels, and smoothed with a 3-3-
2 mm Gaussian kernel. Image orientation for participant 1 was
flipped after preprocessing with the purpose of matching the
migraine location of the remaining participants. Therefore, all
participants had right-sided headache for the neuroimaging
analyses.
Only regions with specific [11C]raclopride nondisplaceable
binding potential (BPND) were included in the analyses (voxels
with a distribution volume ratio [DVR] value .1.1 times the
mean global image). [11C]Raclopride BPND is an objective mea-
surement in vivo of endogenous D2/D3R availability. No global
normalization was applied to the data; therefore, the calculations
presented are based on absolute f2Bmax/Kd estimates (or DVR 2
1), where f2 is the free fraction of tracer in the nondisplacement
tissue compartment, Bmax is the density of available binding sites,
and Kd is the affinity constant. DVR was calculated using the
Logan method19 and the reference region used was cerebellar gray
matter. The resulting parametric maps were produced with vox-
elwise thresholds at p , 0.01 and with an extent threshold of 288
voxels.
A paired t test between ictal and interictal [11C]raclopride
BPND was performed on a voxel-by-voxel basis using the statisti-
cal parametric mapping (SPM8) package in MATLAB (Math-
Works, Natick, MA). Associations of crude differences of
interictal and ictal [11C]raclopride BPND with age, average ther-
mal sensitivity, frequency, and chronicity of migraine attacks were
analyzed by linear regression.
In addition, to examine changes in [11C]raclopride BPND
between the early (at rest) and late (STPT challenge) phases in
the same PET session, paired t tests on voxel and sphere regions
were performed. A linear mixed model (LMM) was used to ana-
lyze [11C]raclopride BPND change (late 2 early) across all 3
groups (HC, interictal, and ictal) and areas. The LMM included
fixed effects for areas, groups, and their interactions.
RESULTS The average age of migraineurs (4 F/4 M)
was 27 6 6.45 (mean 6 SD) years, with an average
migraine chronicity of 11.9 6 7.66 years, and an aver-
age frequency of 5.75 6 3.45 attacks per month. The
average age of the HC was 26 6 7.17 years. All par-
ticipants denied the presence of additional migraine
attacks 3 days preceding or following the PET scans.
The average intensity of the migraine attacks during
PET was moderate (7.05 6 1.53; visual analog scale
1–10) and constant without relief across the early
phase, with a total pain area of 40.5 cells (18.4%)
out of 220 in the head and facial area, and the sum-
mation all rated together of 94.1 (42.78%) (pain area
and intensity number summation [PAINS]16) mea-
sured by GeoPain. On average, the ictal PET scans
for migraineurs occurred 9 hours and 34 minutes
(SD 4 hours) after onset of the migraine.
There were no differences between migraineurs
and HC in striatal [11C]raclopride BPND at rest or
during challenge.

 During early phase analyses (at rest), a paired t test
between ictal and interictal migraine phases showed
higher [11C]raclopride BPND during the ictal phase
compared to the interictal phase at rest (figure 1 and
table e-1 at Neurology.org). This was observed both
on voxel (figure 1A) and cluster (figure 1B) levels (the
anatomical locations of the findings are represented as
ipsilateral or contralateral to the side of the headache).
The contralateral putamen presented an increase of
[11C]raclopride BPND (p , 0.001 and p 5 0.01 for
voxel and cluster level, respectively). The ipsilateral
putamen and ipsilateral caudate also presented higher
[11C]raclopride BPND during the ictal phase at rest
(p 5 0.001 and p 5 0.003 for voxel and cluster level,
respectively, for both areas). At cluster levels, [11C]
raclopride BPND in the ipsilateral putamen during the
ictal phase at rest was on average 24% higher in com-
parison to the interictal phase. The ictal [11C]raclopr-
ide BPND changes (ictal 2 interictal) observed at rest
in the ipsilateral striatum region at the sphere level
were positively associated with longer chronicity
(number of years) of the migraine attacks (p 5 0.
047, figure e-1A).
During late phase analyses (STPT challenge),
a higher [11C]raclopride BPND was also observed dur-
ing the ictal compared to the interictal phase (figure
1, table e-2). The contralateral putamen and contra-
lateral caudate presented significantly higher [11C]ra-
clopride BPND during ictal compared to interictal
phase (p , 0.001 and p 5 0.004 for voxel and cluster
level, respectively, for both areas). The ipsilateral in-
sula also presented significantly higher [11C]raclopr-
ide BPND during the ictal compared to the interictal
phase. At cluster levels, [11C]raclopride BPND during
the challenge was 18% higher in the contralateral
putamen or caudate and 20% higher in the ipsilateral
insula when compared to the interictal phase.
Changes in [11C]raclopride BPND observed during
the challenge in the contralateral striatum region were
negatively correlated with the monthly frequency of
the migraine attacks at cluster levels (p 5 0.016,
figure e-1B).
In paired t tests of late 2 early phase analysis, 9
areas were significant in at least 1 group (table e-3). In
LMM analysis of late 2 early phase, there was evi-
dence of changes in [11C]raclopride BPND between
groups (table e-4 and figure e-2) in the ipsilateral
insula (area 1; p 5 0.030) and bilateral caudate (area
7; p 5 0.035, and area 8; p 5 0.014). We observed
significant decrease in [11C]raclopride BPND during
challenge from baseline (at rest) in the ipsilateral in-
sula (area 1) for patients in the ictal state (227%)
relative to interictal (50%; p 5 0.009). Such direc-
tional change was also observed during challenge in
the contralateral caudate (area 8) of HC (211%)
relative to interictal (5%; p 5 0.004), but reversed
in the ipsilateral caudate (area 7) of HC (1%) relative
to interictal (29%; p 5 0.012).
Since the BPND values in insula are low compared
to caudate or putamen, changes within individuals
have a high degree of uncertainty. Hence, we report
in table e-4 the percent change in insula only for the
group mean BPND values.
DISCUSSION Our study compared in vivo the activ-
ity of the endogenous DA system in migraineurs
during headache-free and during a drug-free sponta-
neous migraine headache and cutaneous heat allo-
dynia. The analysis of [11C]raclopride BPND revealed
no changes in striatal [11C]raclopride BPND between

 migraineurs and HC, but rather an increase in striatal
[11C]raclopride BPND of migraineurs during the ictal
phase at rest and during an ictal thermal challenge,
relative to their interictal phases, specifically in the
bilateral putamen and ipsilateral caudate. This could
be interpreted as a reduction of endogenous DA
release during a migraine attack at rest and allodynia
(figures 2–4). In contrast, intra-analysis of the ictal
phase revealed a sudden decrease in [11C]raclopride
BPND in the insula (table e-4) during the ictal chal-
lenge relative to at rest, which could also be in-
terpreted as a sudden increase of endogenous DA
release during migraine-associated heat allodynia.
The BG is associated with important aspects of
pain processing, including its sensory-discriminative,
cognitive, and affective dimensions,20 and DA plays
a crucial role in BG function. Migraine has been
linked to reduced gray matter in the striatum part
of the BG,21 and an elevated frequency of attacks is
linked to increased volume and decreased activations
in the region during attacks.5 Our findings in the
dorsal striatum region, including putamen and cau-
date, clarify some of the endogenous DA mechanisms
in the brains of migraineurs. Because we only
observed changes in [11C]raclopride BPND in migrai-
neurs during the ictal phase when compared to their
interictal phase, but not when we compared the in-
terictal phase of migraineurs to HC, the dysfunction
is more indicative of provisional shift in receptor
occupancy by endogenous DA rather than an abrupt
change in the number of receptors available in
migraineurs.

 Given the substantial evidence that striatal DA is
an endogenous attenuator of nociception in animals
and of pain in humans,22–24 it is reasonable to suggest
that the pain experienced during the ictal phase is
due, at least in part, to the concurrently reduced
striatal DA we detected when compared to the inter-
ictal phase. However, reduced DA release alone is not
known to be painful, so it is necessary to consider that
the reduced endogenous modulation could cause pain
by enhancing sensory responses to otherwise innocu-
ous ongoing somatosensory afferent input during the
migraine ictus.25 This speculation is supported by the
observation
that
iontophoretically
applied
DA
strongly inhibits the response of rodent trigeminal
system neurons to meningeal stimulation.26 There is
also evidence that rodent trigeminal medullary dorsal
horn neurons are tonically inhibited by a descending
dopaminergic pathway acting via D2 type receptors.27
The evidence cited above13–21 shows that DA has
hypalgesic effects in humans and in animal experi-
ments, and that the endogenous release of DA is
increased, not decreased, by painful stimulation.
Although the changes in [11C]raclopride BPND that
we observed during headache and allodynia were neg-
atively correlated with the frequency of migraine at-
tacks, the baseline level of interictal DA activity was
not different from that of HC. Moreover, there is no
clear correlation of the duration or intensity of
chronic pain with DA activity among patients with
a variety of chronically painful conditions. The
weight of current evidence is that, overall, patients
with chronic pain may have normal, decreased, or
increased striatal DA activity at baseline and their
DA activation responses to noxious stimulation are
highly variable.28
Given the complex relationship of DA activity to
migraine pathophysiology,29 additional studies are
required to elucidate how endogenous striatal DA
might otherwise affect the ictal pain and other clinical
components of migraine. For example, DA partici-
pates in the control of motivation, reward/aversion,
and salience, so reduced DA activity could lead to the
patient’s withdrawal and seclusion during pain.11,30,31
The lack of thermal challenge during the early phase
of our protocol revealed the reduced DA release
uniquely related to the migraine at rest. Although
DA release in the striatum region could potentially
be affected by a reward mechanism due to relief of the
headache intensity while at rest,32 our analysis dem-
onstrated that pain levels in our migraine patients did
not change during the ictal PET session at the early
phase.
The sudden increased DA release during ictal allo-
dynia in the insula, relative to rest, is consistent with
evidence that DA activity is known to modulate the
threshold required for a particular stimulus, making
it more salient and aversive.33,34 In fact, even patients
with DA deficiency disorders can increase DA release
as much as HC when confronted with relevant stim-
uli.35 This phenomenon was observed in our study
(figure e-2), where migraineurs, despite their low
baseline DA levels during headache attack, had sim-
ilar sudden DA release response to allodynia experi-
ence as HC during challenge relative to at rest in most
of the areas. It is noteworthy that migraineurs with
cutaneous allodynia more commonly report general
sensitivity to other stimuli such as photophobia, pho-
nophobia, and nausea,36 and DA D2/D3 agonists
elicit robust emesis in humans. It is also possible that
DA receptor hypersensitivity plays a role. Studies
indicate that migraineurs more frequently have DA
receptor hypersensitivity when compared to HC.29,37
Increased discomfort in migraineurs could result from
a hypersensitivity of DA postsynaptic receptor sites
due to a chronic deficiency of the physiologic ago-
nist.38 Indeed, receptor hypersensitivity can be
induced in animals by persistent interruption of the
dopaminergic activity.39 Our results indicate that
although migraine patients during headache attacks
have lower DA activity compared to the interictal
phase, they can suddenly increase or recover DA
endogenous neurotransmission when challenged with
innocuous stimuli from the environment, worsening
even further migraine-associated symptoms and allo-
dynia experience. Interestingly, there is a report on
the efficacy of a prophylactic DA agonist in reducing
migraine severity after careful modulation of DA
hypersensitivity.40 These results combined indicate
that migraineurs are susceptible to DA deficiency dis-
orders.6,7 Nonetheless, additional studies are needed
to evaluate the implication of our results toward ther-
apeutic recommendations.
This study investigated the endogenous DA D2/
D3 system using [11C]raclopride during drug-free
spontaneous migraine attacks and allodynia in vivo.
Although more studies are needed to confirm our
findings, this study demonstrates that there is a tran-
sient DA reduction and imbalance in the striatum
region and insula during migraine attacks contribut-
ing to patients’ pain and discomfort, and increasing
their global sensory sensitivity and aversive reactions
to environmental stimuli.
