Abstract.
Recurrent outbreaks of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) among children in lychee growing areas in Asia
highlight the need to better understand the etiology and the context. We conducted a mixed-methods study to identify risk
factors for disease, and behaviors and practices around lychee cultivation in an AES outbreak community in northern
Bangladesh in 2012. The outbreak affected 14 children; 13 died. The major symptoms included unconsciousness,
convulsion, excessive sweating, and frothy discharge. The median time from illness onset to unconsciousness was
2.5 hours. The outbreak corresponded with lychee harvesting season. Multiple pesticides including some banned in
Bangladesh were frequently used in the orchards. Visiting a lychee orchard within 24 hours before onset (age-adjusted
odds ratio [aOR] = 11.6 [1.02–109.8]) and 3 days (aOR = 7.2 [1.4–37.6]), and family members working in a lychee orchard
(aOR = 7.2 [1.7–29.4]) and visiting any garden while pesticides were being applied (aOR = 4.9 [1.0–19.4]) in 3 days
preceding illness onset were associated with illness in nearby village analysis. In neighborhood analysis, visiting an
orchard that used pesticides (aOR = 8.4 [1.4–49.9]) within 3 days preceding illness onset was associated with illness.
Eating lychees was not associated with illness in the case–control study. The outbreak was linked to lychee orchard
exposures where agrochemicals were routinely used, but not to consumption of lychees. Lack of acute specimens was a
major limitation. Future studies should target collection of environmental and food samples, acute specimens, and
rigorous assessment of community use of pesticides to determine etiology.
INTRODUCTION
Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) affects approximately
133,000 children each year in Asia.1–3 Several different viruses,
bacteria, fungus, parasites, chemicals, and toxins can cause
AES.4–6 Although data addressing the cause of AES in Asia are
limited, some studies have identified Japanese encephalitis
virus (JEV) and herpes viruses as the most common causes in
south Asia, though these etiologies explain only a small fraction
of illness.7–11 Over the past decades, unusual outbreaks of AES
associated with severe illness and death among children have
repeatedly beenreported fromIndia, Bangladesh,Vietnam,and
Thailand.11–14 Based on clinical, laboratory, and environmental
findings, investigators have speculated that the cause of some
of the illnesses in these AES outbreaks may not be infectious;
however, no conclusive evidence about etiology has been
published following these investigations.6,15
In India, outbreaks of AES among children have been re-
ported near lychee orchards almost every year in the Muzaf-
farpur District of Bihar State since 1995.6 The outbreaks
generally peak in June and continue until July, corresponding
to the lychee harvesting period, which led to assertions of
lychee or lychee orchard–associated AES.6,12,15–17 Studies
conducted in 2013 and 2014 in Muzaffarpur found that AES
case-patients had spent more time in agricultural fields or ly-
chee orchards compared with hospital controls and investi-
gators argued that the AES in children could be caused by a
toxin, such as methylenecyclopropyl-glycine in lychees,
which can lead to hypoglycemia.6,16,17 In 2014, a team from
the National Vector Borne Disease Control Program in India
found concentrations above minimum limits for humans of
alpha cyphermethrin, a highly active pyrethroid insecticide, in
lychee samples collected from AES outbreak–affected areas
and suspected there might be a link between AES outbreaks
and pesticide poisoning.5 Investigators in Vietnam also found a
spatiotemporal association between AES and lychee cultivation
inBacGiangProvincefromJanuary2004toDecember2009and
hypothesized awiderange of causes includingviral encephalitis,
vector borne diseases, and toxic contamination of lychees.12
Between 2008 and 2016, icddr,b and Institute of Epidemiology,
Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) detected and investi-
gated nine AES outbreaks among children in Bangladesh, of
which seven outbreaks occurred during the lychee harvesting
season and two outbreaks were near lychee orchards.18
On June 16, 2012, a physician from Dinajpur Medical Col-
lege Hospital notified the IEDCR, the Ministry of Health
and Family Welfare, Government of Bangladesh, about an
outbreak of encephalitis among children in northern Bangla-
desh. A conventional epidemiological study focuses on
identifying the proximate, individual-level risk factors of the
outbreak that often ignores the context in which the outbreak
occurred.19 To understand an outbreak thoroughly enough
to devise prevention strategies, we often require individual-
level risk exposures along with the factors that contributed
the outbreak to occur.20 Therefore, a collaborative team of
clinicians, epidemiologists, and social scientists from IEDCR
and icddr,b investigated the outbreak. The epidemiologists
focused on describing the clinical presentation and identi-
fying proximate individual-level risk factors and the social
scientists explored behaviors and practices in affected
communities that may have contributed to the outbreak.
METHODS
Case definition, case detection, and data collection. The
team conducted the study between June 17 and September
20, 2012. The investigation team defined a case-patient as any

 child aged 1–12 years who had been admitted to Dinajpur
Medical College Hospital with either unconsciousness or
convulsions, with or without fever, from May 31 to June 30,
2012. The team reviewed admission registers in the pediatric
ward, identified case-patients, and collected addresses of
case-patients and preliminary information about signs and
symptoms from the physicians. Social scientists visited all
case-patient households and used qualitative research tech-
niques to build rapport with and better understand the com-
munity perspective about the illnesses.21 The team conducted
14 in-depth interviews with case-patient family caregivers, to
inquire about the children’s exposures prior to illness onset,
chronological order of symptom development, and sequence
of health-seeking behaviors. From the preliminary assess-
ment, the team identified that some of the affected case-
households were adjacent to lychee orchards. Therefore, the
team conducted unstructured observations of all the case-
households and their surroundings to understand the prox-
imity to and contact with lychee orchards and any use of
pesticides in those orchards. Social scientists also conducted
12 in-depth interviews with neighbors of case-patients and
lychee orchard caretakers in the community, inquiring about
the frequency and types of pesticides used in or around case-
households, in the lychee orchards, and case-patient expo-
sures to areas where pesticides were recently used. This
information helped us to generate the hypothesis that ex-
posure to toxic chemicals might have caused illness among
children and that was tested using a case–control study.
Case–control study. After the qualitative investigation and
preliminary data analysis, the investigation team returned to
the outbreak-affected communities to conduct a case–control
study from September 15 to 20, 2012, to investigate risk fac-
tors for disease in the affected areas. Cases spanned a wide
geographic area and we hypothesized that there might be
something special about the case-patient communities that
led to the illness. Therefore, we enrolled two sets of controls:
neighborhood controls and nearby village-level controls.
Neighborhood controls were selected from the case-patient’s
neighborhood, defined as the neighboring house closest to
the case-patient household. We anticipated that the controls
within the village would help us identify exposures in the
neighborhood that led to the illness and the controls from
nearby villages would help us identify village-level behaviors
and practices associated with the disease. We selected four
age-matched neighborhood controls for each case-patient by
identifying the four closest courtyards to the case-patients’
courtyard, and enrolling the child closest in age to the case as
a control. The team selected one control from each courtyard
and the selection was repeated at the next closest household
until we enrolled four controls for each case-patient. Eligible
controls were those children who had not experienced any
illness between May 30 and June 30, 2012, and were aged
±1 year if the case was £ 5 years old and ±2 years if the case
was between 6 and 12 years old. If there were no children in the
selected household that matched our selection criteria, then
we selected children from the next closest household. Village-
level controls were selected from the nearby villages closest to
the case-patient village that did not have any cases identified
between May 30 and June 30, 2012. To select village-level
controls, the team visited the center of each control village,
rolled a pen on the ground, and selected the first household in
the direction that the pen pointed. Following the same method
described above, we also selected four age-matched village-
level controls for each case-patient. We used proxy respon-
dents for all case-patients and controls as all were children
aged less than 10 years. Proxy respondents were family
members or orchard caretakers who were aware of the case-
patients activities and probable risk exposures during May 25,
2012 and June 23, 2012. We used multiple proxy respondents
to maximize reliability of the information as family members
were more likely to be informed about possible domestic ex-
posures, whereas orchard caretakers were likely to be better
informed about orchard exposures.
Based on the preliminary qualitative findings, we developed
a structured questionnaire in Bengali language and interviewed
thefamilymembersofthecase-patientsandtheirage-matched
controls about their food and environmental exposures in the
3 days preceding the case-patients’ illnesses.
Data analysis. We described case-patients in terms of
demographics and clinical profiles. We recoded ‘‘do not
know’’ responses as ‘‘missing’’ and “not applicable” as “no”
during the case–control analysis. Since differences in recall
are common between cases and controls in case–control
studies, we compared the proportion of cases with missing
exposure information to the proportion missing among
controls. We estimated age-adjusted odds ratio (aOR) as a
measure of association with 95% confidence intervals (CI)
between each exposure and illness development using lo-
gistic regression.22
The qualitative team reviewed the observation and interview
field notes, expanded the jottings, and summarized them. The
primary author (Mohammed Saiful Islam) read summaries of
the observations and interviews, identified themes, and cat-
egorized the data according to these themes.23
Ethical considerations. The team obtained verbal in-
formed consent from study participants. The study protocol
was reviewed by IEDCR and was determined to be an urgent
public health activity for disease control and not a research
activity requiring formal human subjects review.
RESULTS
Fourteen patients met our case definition (Table 1). Thirteen
were identified from 13 different villages of four subdistricts in
Dinajpur District. One was identified from a village of neigh-
boring subdistrict in Thakurgaon District (Figure 1). The me-
dian age of case-patients was 4.6 years (IQR = 2.5–5.0 years).
The onset of illness ofthe case-patients wasdistributed during
the day time and night time. Illness started with a sudden
outcry among 43% of the case-patients that awakened the
patient and their family members from sleep. Family care-
givers reported that 79% of case-patients had convulsions.
Fifty-seven percent of case-patients had excessive sweating
and 50% had frothy discharge from the mouth. Ninety-three
percent of case-patients became unconscious; the median
time from onset of symptoms or signs to unconsciousness
for the six cases for whom information was available was
2.5 hours(Table1).Inthehospital,wefoundmedicalrecordsfor
nine case-patients; four records mentioned that patients had
mid-dilated or fixed pupils and six mentioned that patients had
lung crepitations on auscultation. Before seeking care at the
tertiary care hospital, 64% of case-patients reportedly sought
care from spiritual healers, 57% from village doctors and
paramedics, and 29% from subdistrict-level hospitals.

 Case–control study. We enrolled 14 cases, 56 neighbor-
hood controls, and 56 nearby village-level controls. Mean age
(±standard deviation) of the case-patients was 4.7 ± 2.6 years
and of the controls was 4.7 ± 2.5 years. In the village-level
case–control analysis, cases were 11.6 times (91% versus
54%, aOR = 11.6, 95% CI = 1.02–109.8) more likely to have
visited a lychee orchard in the 24 hours and 7.2 times (85%
versus 46%, aOR = 7.2, 95% CI = 1.4–37.6) more likely to have
visited a lychee orchard in the 3 days preceding illness onset
compared with the controls from the nearby villages using
logistic regression (Table 2). Moreover, case-patient family
members were 7.2 times (43% versus 9%, aOR = 7.2, 95%
CI = 1.7–29.43) more likely to work in a lychee orchard than the
family members of controls from the nearby villages. A similar
pattern of elevated odds ratios was also found in the neighbor-
hood control analysis. Cases were 4.1 times (85% versus
59%, aOR = 4.1, 95% CI = 0.8–21.8) more likely to have visited
a lychee orchard in the 3 days preceding illness onset com-
pared with the controls from the neighboring households.
Family members of case-patients were also 1.8 times (43%
versus 30%, aOR = 1.8, 95% CI = 0.5–5.9) more likely to work
in a lychee orchard than the family members of controls from
the neighboring household were, though these associations
were not statistically significant (Table 3).
In the village-level case–control analysis, cases were
4.9 times (38% versus 14%, aOR = 4.9, 95% CI = 1.0–19.4)
more likely to have visited any garden where pesticides were
sprayed in the 3 days preceding the illness onset compared
with the controls. In the neighborhood analysis, cases were
8.4 times (29% versus 5%, aOR = 8.4, 95% CI = 1.4–49.9)
more likely to have visited any garden that used pesticides in
the 3 days preceding the illness onset compared with the
controls. Eating lychees within 24 hours prior to onset of ill-
ness was not associated with developing illness among cases
compared with controls from villages (57% versus 71%,
aOR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.1–2.1) or neighborhoods (57% versus
61%, aOR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.2–2.9). Eating mangoes in the
24 hours preceding the illness onset was protective in the
village-levelcase–controlanalysis(43%versus85%,aOR=0.1,
95% CI = 0.0–0.6). In the both sets of case–control analysis,
“control respondents were significantly more likely to report not
knowing if their child had the exposure in question, compared
with the cases (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2).”
Qualitative study. Exposuresofthecase-patients.Lychees
are commercially grown in the affected subdistricts and these
subdistricts are well known for their widespread cultivation of
lychees. There were 15 lychee orchards adjacent to or nearby
13 case-patients’ households. Fifty-seven percent (8/14) of
the case-households were adjacent to at least one lychee
orchard and five (36%) of the others were within 10 m of the
orchards. Family members of one case-household informed
us that there were no lychee orchards nearby the case-
patient’s house and the case-patient did not visit any lychee
orchards within 7 days prior to his illness. Family caregivers of
all case-patients mentioned that the case-patients usually
played in their household premises. Eighty-five percent of the
case-patients visited lychee orchards within 3 days of illness
onset and the average elapsed time between the most recent
visit to a lychee orchard and illness onset was 16.5 hours. The
family members of the children reported that they did not al-
ways pay close attention to what children were eating or doing
in the orchards, including in the 24 hours before onset of ill-
ness. However, family members of eight case-patients recal-
led that the eight case-patients had consumed lychees from
the nearby orchards in the 24 hours prior to onset of illness.
The orchard caretakers mentioned that due to pests and a
physiological disorder in the lychee trees, many lychees had
cracked and dropped on the ground in the orchard. Case-
patients or their family members often visited lychee orchards
and collected dropped lychees from the ground and ate and/
or fed them to case-patients. The family caregivers mentioned
that people in their community did not wash lychees before
eating them and the children usually used their teeth to peel
them before eating them. The children ate the flesh part of the
lychee and discarded the seeds and peel.
The community members of the affected villages informed
us that wholesalers from around the country leased the lychee

 orchards for multiple years at a time. Orchard leaseholders
explained that they frequently hired residents from the com-
munity to work as orchard caretakers. Eight of the 14 case-
patients lived with someone who worked in lychee orchards
and three of these family members were also involved in
spraying pesticides in the orchards during the outbreak pe-
riod. While visiting case-patient households, we found
equipment used to apply pesticides in two households and
pesticides in a bottle and in a packet in one household. The
community members also informed us that lychee orchard
caretakers often had children assist with fruit harvesting. One
case-patient was involved in harvesting lychees. A neighbor of
the case mentioned that,
The lychee businesspersons hired children for collecting
fruits from small lychee trees. Since the trees are small,
the children can easily go to the small branches and col-
lect lychees. The labor costs of children are also less
expensive.
Use of agrochemicals in lychee orchards. The orchard
caretakers explained that the duration from lychee flowering
to fruit harvesting is approximately 1 month starting from May
to June (Figure 2), though the timeline of lychee harvesting
could vary based on the lychee variety. The caretakers de-
scribed usingdifferenttypesofagrochemicalsatdifferentstages
of lychee flowering, fruit maturation, and harvesting. The
caretakers explained that lychee orchard wholesalers bought
pesticides from local pesticide dealers as well as from un-
registered sellers near the Indian border. Before providing the
pesticides to the caretakers, the wholesalers sometimes took
the label off of the bottles or bags of agrochemicals. The
caretakers said that the wholesalers did so because they did
not want orchard caretakers and local gardeners to know what
pesticides they were using.
Caretakers reported that they sprayed different vitamins
and fertilizers (e.g., boron) on the trees before flowering.
However, the caretakers could not recall the names of the
vitamins. After flowering and during fruiting, the orchard
caretakers reportedly used several insecticides, including
cypermethrin, endosulfan, alpha-cypermethrin, and lambda-
cyhalothrin. The mother of one case-patient mentioned that
the smell of pesticides sprayed in the neighboring orchard was
so strong that it was difficult for them to stay at home after the
chemicals had been sprayed and that the smell persisted for
several hours. During fruit maturation, the orchard caretakers
used different fungicides along with insecticides to protect
young lychees from insects, fungus, and the sun. The orchard

 caretakers also reported using plant growth regulators to im-
prove growth, protect flowers, and prevent fruit from drop-
ping. As fruit matured, they continued spraying insecticides,
fungicides, and plant growth hormones two to three times a
week. Caretakers mentioned they used hair shampoo on ly-
chees to avoid spotting or remove spots from the fruit. Care-
givers also reportedly used carbendazim (benzimidazole
carbamate fungicide) to enhance lychee coloration. The
caretakers said that they discarded the used bottles and
packets of pesticides in the orchards. The team visited four
orchards in three case-patient’s villages and collected empty
pesticide, insecticide, fungicide, and other chemical bottles
and packets that had been discarded in lychee orchards. The
active ingredients listed on the bottle and packet labels in-
cluded pyrethroids, endosulfan, organochlorine, dithiocarba-
mates, benzimidazole, triazole, soluble boron, and soluble
potash.
The orchard caretakers we interviewed supplied lychees to
different areas of the country. Their distribution was disrupted
by a 5-day nationwide strike among bus and truck drivers
during the second week of June 2012. The caretakers men-
tioned that this was the peak week for harvesting lychees, but
they did not harvest the fruits, as there was no alternative way
to transport the lychees to markets around the country. Or-
chard caretakers from two communities informed us that they
used carbendazim almost every day during the strike to delay
the fruit from ripening and minimize their financial losses from
the transport strike.

LYCHEE ORCHARD-ASSOCIATED OUTBREAK IN CHILDREN IN BANGLADESH
953
 duration between onset of illness to death all suggest that the
outbreak was more likely due to a toxic poisoning than an
infection. The outbreak was restricted to the lychee season
and to a geographic area in which lychees are grown, which
suggests that this outbreak of AES may be linked to exposure
to lychees or lychee orchards.12
Our epidemiological study identified a strong association
between illness and exposures to lychee orchards and lychee
orchard workers in the village-level case–control analysis,
providing evidence that this outbreak was related to an ex-
posure in lychee orchards, similar to findings reported from
similar outbreaks of AES in India.6,12–14,17,24 The elevated
odds in both nearby village level and neighborhood control
analysis suggest visiting a lychee orchard prior to illness on-
set, visiting a garden where pesticides were sprayed, and
family members working in lychee orchard increase the risk of
illness among children.6 The onset of this outbreak during ly-
chee cultivation and the increasing number of cases during
fruit harvesting time further supports the evidence of lychee-
associated illness. Moreover, the recent outbreak of AES
among children in 2015 in the same lychee production area of
Dinajpur District further strengthens our assertion that the
outbreak of AES among children may relate to some kind of
behaviors and practices around lychee cultivation in the af-
fected area.18
In India, the leading hypothesis of AES etiology among
children living near lychee orchards was the ingestion of
phytotoxins, specifically methylenecyclopropyl-glycine that is
present in lychee seeds and pulp, which can lead to hypo-
glycemia among malnourished children.6,25 Without acute
biological specimens, and therefore, lack of measured blood
glucose levels from children in this outbreak in Bangladesh,
we were unable to investigate this hypothesis directly. How-
ever, our epidemiologic and clinical findings suggest that
methylenecyclopropyl-glycine alone may not explain this AES
outbreak among children. There are multiple lines of evidence
that agrochemical poisoning may also have contributed.
First, lychee consumption was not statistically significantly
associated with child illness in our case–control analysis,
which is apparently consistent with the community controls
in India.17 Lychees are cultivated, harvested, and consumed
in different parts of Bangladesh26; however, the lychee-
associated outbreaks have been reported only in Dinajpur and
Thakurgaon. If lychee consumption were the cause, we would
expect cases to be reported from other parts of Bangladesh,
which is also consistent with the findings in India and Vietnam
where outbreaks were clustered in a few lychee-producing
areas.
Second, visiting any garden that recently used pesticides
increased the risk of developing illness in the neighborhood
and village-level analysis. The qualitative investigation iden-
tified heavy use of multiple, highly toxic agrochemicals in ly-
chee orchards. Packets of endosulfan, an organochlorine
insecticide banned due to the deleterious health effects in
more than 80 countries, were observed in the lychee orchards
suggesting recent use of this highly toxic pesticide.27 In most
fruits, the half-life of endosulfan is 3.7–4.6 days.28 Endosulfan-
related mortality and morbidity have been reported from
different parts of the world including India, Turkey, and
Bangladesh.29–31 Since 1978, the local government of Kerala,
India, estimated that indiscriminate use of endosulfan caused
poisoning among 4,270 humans including 500 deaths.30 The
frequent use of multiple agrochemicals in the lychee orchards
increases pesticide exposures among children in several
ways.32 In these outbreak communities, affected children and
their family caregivers collected cracked and dropped lychees
from the orchard or bought from a local market. During
spraying pesticides over lychee trees, the edible fruit fleshes
of cracked lychees were likely exposed to pesticides. Since
the children reportedly did not wash the lychees before eating
and used their teeth to peel the lychees, unwashed lychees
contaminated with pesticides may have increased the risk of
poisoning.33
In addition, the children were exposed to these chemicals
through multiple routes beyond just lychee consumption.
Their frequent exposure to lychee orchards suggests that they
could have been exposed to pesticides there, including
through skin contact, ingestion, and perhaps inhalation.
Family members of the case-patients who worked in the ly-
chee orchards or were involved in pesticide spraying in the
orchards might have brought pesticides into their homes in the
form of residues on their tools, clothes, shoes, and skin and
children might have also been exposed to pesticides through
contact with these family members and their items.34 Children
are more susceptible to pesticide poisoning than adults in a
contaminated environment because they eat, drink, and
breathe more per unit of body weight.35 In addition, while
playing in their household premises or in the orchard, children
are more likely to put their fingers and other objects that might
be contaminated with pesticides into their mouths, including
bottles, clothes, and mud.36
Third, children involved in this outbreak presented with
clinical illnesses similar to those identified during confirmed
outbreaks of pesticide poisoning in Bangladesh.37 During an
outbreak of sudden child deaths in 2009, investigators de-
tected carbamate insecticides in the biological specimens
collected within 6 hours of illness onset, which suggested
poisoning.37 Similarities between that outbreak and those
cases include age distribution of the case-patients, a sudden
outcry, onset of illness early in the morning, mid-dilated
or fixed pupils, lung crepitations on auscultation, excess
sweating, froth at the mouth, excess respiratory secretions,
convulsions, and coma.37 In our study, the signs and symp-
toms are also consistent with acute pesticide poisoning in
children reported in different countries of the world.38–41 Fever
has been reported as part of the clinical syndrome following
pesticide poisoning in many countries.42 Although family
members of four case-patients reported fever, it was not the
initial symptoms for them, and was not confirmed in any of the
clinical records. The onset of illness of the case-patients was
distributed throughout the day. Studies showed that the time
of occurrence of symptoms and signs depends on the route of
exposures, poison load, chemical nature, and solubility
characters of the compound.43 For acute pesticide poisoning,
the signs and symptoms may occur after minutes to 24 hours
of exposures, thus supporting the different timeline of the
onset of illness among case-patients.43
Fourth, the outbreak ended following the onset of the
monsoon rains, which suggest that the toxin associated with
the lychees was on their surface, rather than contained in the
fruit. In India, a similar pattern was observed, where the
number of cases peaked in mid-June and declined imme-
diately after the onset of monsoon rains.6 Moreover, the
findings of washing fruits and vegetables protective against
954
ISLAM AND OTHERS
 lychee-associated illness in India further supports our asser-
tion that toxin associated with the lychees may be on the
surface.17
Diagnosing unintentional pesticide or other agrochemical
poisoning among children is difficult.44 The signs and symp-
toms of agrochemicals poisoning may vary by type of chem-
icals, route of exposures, and age of case-patients.41,45 In our
study, most of the case-patients presented with reduced
levels of consciousness or seizures rather than the classic
nicotinic and muscarinic effects often seen in adults. This
observation is consistent with previous findings of pesticide
poisoning in young children, where the predominant mani-
festations were neurological.41,44–46 In addition, pesticide
poisoning may imitate other severe disorders such as heat
stroke, pneumonia, asthma, hypoglycemia, or intestinal se-
cretions.47 Acute exposures to organophosphate and carba-
mate pesticides in children accumulate acetylcholine at the
autonomic ganglia resulting in hypertension, pallor, and hy-
poglycemia.48 This could explain why most of the case-
patients fall ill between 2 AM and 8 AM when blood glucose
reaches to its lowest levels.49
Confirming a diagnosis of toxic poisoning requires acute
specimens and is aided by good clinical records. Since case-
patients were admitted in serious condition and died quickly
after arriving at the hospital, attending physicians did not
collect acute specimens from patients during this outbreak,
making a confirmed determination of the cause of death in
these patients impossible. The clinical files for some case-
patients were either missing or incomplete; so much of what
we know about the clinical illness comes from interviews with
the family caregivers. Case ascertainment was limited to ad-
mitted children at Dinajpur Medical College Hospital; there-
fore, we might have missed cases from villages whose
residents might seek care in other facilities or who died before
reaching the hospital. In addition, we missed adult cases who
might have exposed to pesticide and developed mild symp-
toms but were not hospitalized as our case finding was limited
to children with severe illness in the hospital. Moreover, lack of
access to health facilities and cultural practices that favor
health seeking from a traditional healer before consulting a
trained physician limit the detection and reporting of AES
cases in the affected areas.
A second limitation was that orchard caretakers often re-
ceived pesticides from the lychee orchard leaseholders
without any labels, so the orchard caretakers were not fully
aware of the pesticides they applied to the lychee trees.
Therefore, we were unable to identify all the pesticides used
in affected villages and compared with the control villages.
Although we identified the names of the agrochemicals used
in the orchards by visiting the lychee orchards and collecting
empty pesticide containers and bags from the orchards, we
were unable to confirm the timeline of pesticides used in the
orchards from the discarded pesticide bottles and packets.
A third limitation of this study was limited power due to the
small number of cases. We aimed to identify as many risk
factors for child death as possible and therefore, we did not
adjust the P values for multiple comparisons so that potential
risk factors would not be eliminated. Nonetheless, our find-
ings can help identifying several possible risk factors and
guide future studies for clear understanding of these repeated
outbreaks and sudden deaths in Bangladesh and in countries
that experienced similar outbreaks in south Asia.
A fourth limitation was ascertaining illness history, espe-
cially among the 13 case-patients who died. We relied on
case-patients’ family caregivers and neighbors to recall and
report the sign and symptoms of the case-patients. We used
medical records to supplement case-patients reports of ill-
ness history, but often these records were not available for all
case-patients. However, the qualitative investigation began
during the outbreak, which provided for better recall of illness
history and time line of events.
In addition, proxies of both cases and controls noted that
many of the child activities generally occur outdoors and,
therefore, they were unable to recall exposure histories.
Moreover, proxies of case-patients might have reflected more
about exposures and identified exposures more thoroughly
than controls; our analysis showed that controls had missing
exposure information significantly more often than cases. The
observed protective association of eating mangoes and de-
veloping illness might be due to the large differences in
missing information between cases and controls. However, if
all of our findings were due to recall bias, we would expect
more spurious associations rather than a pattern of associa-
tions consistent with pesticide poisoning. For instance, al-
though there were many exposures that cases recalled
significantly more frequently than controls, only exposures
related to lychee orchards or other gardens where pesticides
were applied were associated with illness. In addition, al-
though there was no significant difference in recall between
cases and controls regarding visiting a lychee orchard within
24 hours of illness or having family members work in lychee
orchards, those were also significantly associated with illness
in the nearby village-level analysis.
In India, Vietnam, and Bangladesh, the most common
finding of outbreaks of AES occurring during the lychee har-
vesting season is a spatial relationship to lychee orchards.
Since outbreaks of illness associated with lychee and lychee
orchards have repeatedly been reported from these countries
in Asia, we recommend standardizing protocols across these
countries to allow for comparisons between the resulting
outbreak investigations. Moreover, future studies should tar-
get establishing surveillance to detect AES clusters in lychee
producing areas, collect acute blood and urine specimens of
case-patients, and provide a time line of symptom onset along
with records of different agrochemicals used to help elucidate
a common thread among countries as well as potential risk
factors for illness among children.
From our experience of investigating the AES outbreak,
collecting information about pesticide exposures only through
questionnaires administered in the hospital may be insuf-
ficient to understand the context where the outbreak oc-
curred. Indeed, communities are often unaware of contact
they have had with agrochemicals. Therefore, we recommend
qualitative exploration along with the surveillance to explicate
local perceptions, behaviors, and practices that may have
contributed to the outbreak occurrence, particularly those
related to community use of toxic chemicals. We also rec-
ommend making an inventory of agrochemicals used on the
lychee orchards, collecting samples of agrochemicals along
with environmental samples, and testing them to identify the
implicated chemicals and or toxins. In Bangladesh, pesticide
regulation may be difficult due to lack of monitoring and
pesticide residue analysis50 as well as the more general
difficulty that weak states face in enforcing environmental

955
 regulations. Educating farmers on pesticide handling in-
cluding proper storage, use of aprons and gloves or washing
hands and cloths with soap after pesticide spraying might
reduce children’s pesticide exposures at their dwelling place.
Finally, in India, mortality decline among AES case-patients
after rapid correction of hypoglycemia with intravenous dex-
trose. Although we were unable to measure blood glucose
level among the case-patients, however, distribution of blood
glucose meter among clinician may help identifying patients
with hypoglycemia and rapid correction of hypoglycemia with
intravenous glucose may reduce mortality in children in
Bangladesh.
