Abstract
Background
Taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) meant to improve health and raise revenue
are being adopted, yet evaluation is scarce. This study examines the association of the first
penny per ounce SSB excise tax in the United States, in Berkeley, California, with beverage
prices, sales, store revenue/consumer spending, and usual beverage intake.
Methods and findings
Methods included comparison of pre-taxation (before 1 January 2015) and first-year post-
taxation (1 March 2015–29 February 2016) measures of (1) beverage prices at 26 Berkeley
stores; (2) point-of-sale scanner data on 15.5 million checkouts for beverage prices, sales,
and store revenue for two supermarket chains covering three Berkeley and six control non-
Berkeley large supermarkets in adjacent cities; and (3) a representative telephone survey
(17.4% cooperation rate) of 957 adult Berkeley residents.
Key hypotheses were that (1) the tax would be passed through to the prices of taxed bev-
erages among the chain stores in which Berkeley implemented the tax in 2015; (2) sales of
taxed beverages would decline, and sales of untaxed beverages would rise, in Berkeley
stores more than in comparison non-Berkeley stores; (3) consumer spending per transac-
tion (checkout episode) would not increase in Berkeley stores; and (4) self-reported con-
sumption of taxed beverages would decline.
Main outcomes and measures included changes in inflation-adjusted prices (cents/
ounce), beverage sales (ounces), consumers’ spending measured as store revenue (infla-
tion-adjusted dollars per transaction) in two large chains, and usual beverage intake (grams/
day and kilocalories/day).

Data Availability Statement: Data are from the
UNC-PHI Berkeley Evaluation of SSB Tax study.
Datasets from the de-identified telephone survey
and from the 26 store survey can be made fully
available without restriction upon request. The
retail scanner data set is available in aggregate
form combined across chains due to confidentiality
restrictions required when obtaining voluntary
data sharing from stores. The databases and
accompanying documentation are available at:
 Tax pass-through (changes in the price after imposition of the tax) for SSBs varied in
degree and timing by store type and beverage type. Pass-through was complete in large
chain supermarkets (+1.07¢/oz, p = 0.001) and small chain supermarkets and chain gas
stations (1.31¢/oz, p = 0.004), partial in pharmacies (+0.45¢/oz, p = 0.03), and negative in
independent corner stores and independent gas stations (−0.64¢/oz, p = 0.004). Sales-
unweighted mean price change from scanner data was +0.67¢/oz (p = 0.00) (sales-weighted,
+0.65¢/oz, p = 0.003), with +1.09¢/oz (p < 0.001) for sodas and energy drinks, but a lower
change in other categories. Post-tax year 1 scanner data SSB sales (ounces/transaction) in
Berkeley stores declined 9.6% (p < 0.001) compared to estimates if the tax were not in place,
but rose 6.9% (p < 0.001) for non-Berkeley stores. Sales of untaxed beverages in Berkeley
stores rose by 3.5% versus 0.5% (both p < 0.001) for non-Berkeley stores. Overall beverage
sales also rose across stores. In Berkeley, sales of water rose by 15.6% (p < 0.001) (exceed-
ing the decline in SSB sales in ounces); untaxed fruit, vegetable, and tea drinks, by 4.37%
(p < 0.001); and plain milk, by 0.63% (p = 0.01). Scanner data mean store revenue/consumer
spending (dollars per transaction) fell 18¢ less in Berkeley (−$0.36, p < 0.001) than in com-
parison stores (−$0.54, p < 0.001). Baseline and post-tax Berkeley SSB sales and usual die-
tary intake were markedly low compared to national levels (at baseline, National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey SSB intake nationally was 131 kcal/d and in Berkeley was 45
kcal/d). Reductions in self-reported mean daily SSB intake in grams (−19.8%, p = 0.49) and
in mean per capita SSB caloric intake (−13.3%, p = 0.56) from baseline to post-tax were not
statistically significant.
Limitations of the study include inability to establish causal links due to observational
design, and the absence of health outcomes. Analysis of consumption was limited by the
small effect size in relation to high standard error and Berkeley’s low baseline consumption.
Conclusions
One year following implementation of the nation’s first large SSB tax, prices of SSBs increased
in many, but not all, settings, SSB sales declined, and sales of untaxed beverages (especially
water) and overall study beverages rose in Berkeley; overall consumer spending per transac-
tion in the stores studied did not rise. Price increases for SSBs in two distinct data sources,
their timing, and the patterns of change in taxed and untaxed beverage sales suggest that the
observed changes may be attributable to the tax. Post-tax self-reported SSB intake did not
change significantly compared to baseline. Significant declines in SSB sales, even in this rela-
tively affluent community, accompanied by revenue used for prevention suggest promise for
this policy. Evaluation of taxation in jurisdictions with more typical SSB consumption, with con-
trols, is needed to assess broader dietary and potential health impacts.

 • It was unknown to what extent people would change beverage purchasing in response
to a tax, especially in a relatively prosperous community.
• Few high-quality evaluations from other countries existed; studies of Mexico’s tax
(implemented starting January 2014) found substantial but not complete “pass-through”
of the tax to consumers for taxed beverages, a 6% reduction in sales in the first year, and
a 9% decrease in sales to lower-income households.
What did the researchers do and find?
• Three before-and-after studies were carried out: one of store scanner records from 15.5
million checkouts in two chains of large groceries in Berkeley and comparison cities;
one of 26 stores of various types in Berkeley; and one random digit dialing telephone
survey of consumption by Berkeley residents.
• In the 15.5 million supermarket checkouts studied, 67% of the amount of the tax was
passed on to consumers across all SSBs, and the tax was fully passed through for sodas
and energy drinks; in the 26-store survey, the tax was more than fully passed on in
Berkeley large and small chain groceries and gas stations, especially for carbonated bev-
erages; partially passed on in pharmacies; and not passed on in small independent gas
stations and corner stores.
• Sales in ounces of taxed SSBs fell by 9.6% in relation to predicted sales in the absence of
the tax, while sales of untaxed beverages rose 3.5% and total beverage sales rose in
Berkeley. Consumer spending per transaction (average grocery bill) did not increase,
nor did store revenue fall more in Berkeley, while SSB sales rose 6.9% in comparison
cities.
• Berkeley residents were low consumers of SSBs at baseline (consuming only 34% of the
national average of SSBs). Dietary intake surveys found shifts of −19.8% (p = 0.49) in
mean daily SSB intake (grams) and −13.3% (p = 0.56) in mean calories from SSBs that
were not statistically significant, while caloric intake of untaxed beverages (milk and
other diary-based beverages) increased.
What do these findings mean?
• Berkeley’s innovative tax on SSBs was mostly, though not uniformly, passed through to
consumers, and sales of SSBs declined significantly, consistent with published price elas-
ticity estimates.
• There was no evidence in studied chains of higher grocery bills for consumers, loss of
gross revenue per transaction for stores, or decreases in overall beverage sales for stores.
While telephone respondents did not report changes in shopping location, scanner data
were consistent with some increased purchasing of SSBs in neighboring cities.
• The findings of this study, while limited by its observational design, suggest that SSB
taxes may be effective in shifting consumers to purchase healthier beverages without
causing undue economic hardship and while raising revenue for social objectives.

 • Population-based findings on SSB consumption were not definitive, and consumption
should be further evaluated in more typical communities and with larger samples.
Introduction
Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption is linked to increased body weight, diabetes,
cardiovascular risk factors, and dental caries, amongst other conditions [1,2]. Significant SSB
taxes have been proposed and increasingly adopted as part of a comprehensive approach to
obesity and diabetes prevention [3–5] with extensive potential health and social benefits [2,5–
7]. Over 20 countries have passed strengthened SSB taxes of varying sizes, with a growing
emphasis on larger excise taxes [6,8–10].
Berkeley, California, is the first US jurisdiction to successfully place a substantial excise tax
on SSB distributors, with the dual goals of reducing consumption and raising revenue for
efforts to prevent obesity and diabetes. The tax, approved by voters in November 2014, is one
penny per fluid ounce (1¢/oz) on beverages with added caloric sweeteners. In theory, the tax
might add 68¢ to the price of a 2-l (68-oz) bottle of soda, typically priced a little over $2 before
the tax, or 12¢ to a 12-oz can, sold for around $1. In late January 2015, the city delayed the
original 1 January 2015 implementation until 1 March 2015 among the 38 largest beverage dis-
tributors [11]. Tax collection from small retailers obtaining their own supplies (“self-distribu-
tors”) only began 1 January 2016. In 2016, other US jurisdictions, including three large cities—
Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), San Francisco (California), and Oakland (California)—and Cook
County (Illinois), which encompasses Chicago’s metro area, as well as two smaller cities—
Boulder (Colorado) and Albany (California)—followed suit, with similar measures at tax levels
from 1¢/oz to 2¢/oz.
The Berkeley tax therefore offered a unique opportunity to evaluate this policy. This study
sought to examine (1) whether and how the tax was passed through to beverage prices, (2)
whether the volume of beverages sold changed, (3) whether store revenues/consumer spending
per transaction within these stores changed, and (4) whether beverage consumption changed.
This study evaluates changes in the first year of implementation (March 2015–February 2016).
Methods
Three data collection approaches were employed to measure beverage prices, volume sold,
store revenue (or, conversely, consumer spending), and beverage intake. Fig 1 illustrates the
tax implementation and study data collection timeline. Key elements of analyses were deter-
mined prospectively; however, some adjustments were required, particularly as we received
and analyzed store scanner data.
This study was approved by institutional review boards of the Public Health Institute and
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Setting. The city of Berkeley, located in California’s Bay Area, had an estimated 121,000
inhabitants in 2015 and covers only 10.5 square miles. Residents are 55% non-Hispanic white,
19% Asian, 11% Hispanic or Latino, 10% African-American, and 21% foreign-born. Berkeley
is home to a large public university and a very highly educated population, with 71% of those
over age 25 y holding a bachelor’s degree or higher. Nevertheless, it has a high percentage of
residents in poverty (20.4% versus 15.3% for California and 13.5% nationwide), though the

 median income of $66,237 is about 10% above the median for the state as a whole and 23%
above the US median [12].
Store price surveys. Store price surveys were conducted in December 2014 (pre-tax), June
2015 (4 months post-tax), and March 2016 (13 months post-tax, and 2 months into self-dis-
tributor tax collection) among a targeted sample of large supermarkets, small chain supermar-
kets, chain and independent gas stations, pharmacies (drugstores), and independent corner
stores located in Berkeley, California (n = 26). Six top stores were identified from the telephone
survey (described below), and the remainder were selected randomly within their type. Store
price surveys collected 744 prices in December 2014, 798 prices in June 2015, and 633 prices
in March 2016 for a standard panel of 70 beverages, which included 45 taxed and untaxed
branded beverages in a variety of sizes. It was possible to collect 313 prices for 55 of the 70
products in the standard panel in all three rounds in the same stores. S1 Text provides details
on the store price survey design.
Point-of-sale data. Point-of-sale electronic scanner data were requested using personal
outreach to all large supermarkets in Berkeley, as well as to pharmacies, small supermarkets,
ethnic markets, convenience stores, and gas stations with scanner systems, and with extensive
follow-up as needed to owners or corporate headquarters. Ultimately, two chains of large
supermarkets with three of the city’s nine large groceries provided electronic data covering 1
January 2013 through 29 February 2016 (26 months pre-tax; 12 months post-tax). They also
provided data on six Bay Area control stores. Data covered 118.8 million barcode scans from
15.5 million transactions (checkout episodes), with 16.2 million barcode scans involving bever-
ages (16,769 unique barcodes), of which 10.8 million barcode scans (5,631 unique barcodes)

 are included here. S2 Text describes the point-of-sale study design and the stores and beverage
products included in our analyses. The tax status of each beverage was classified using the
Berkeley law [13], nutrition data from product websites, and ingredient data from Mintel [14].
Dietary and shopping behavior surveys. These telephone surveys were conducted Novem-
ber–December 2014 (pre-tax/baseline) and November–December 2015 (post-tax/follow-up).
The sample was identified using dual frame (landline/cellular) random digit dialing that over-
sampled lower income census blocks (>50% of households with annual gross household
income <$100,000) in Berkeley. Only Berkeley residents were interviewed. Oral informed
consent was obtained from all participants. Trained interviewers used standardized question-
naires and computer-assisted telephone interviews to collect information on beverage shop-
ping locations and behaviors, demographics, and 24-h recall of beverage intake [15]. To adjust
for typical daily intake, a second 24-h beverage recall interview was collected 3–7 d later from
consenting respondents.
Sampling weights were calculated using iterative proportional fitting (raking) [16] to adjust
the data to demographic proportions for Berkeley, California, obtained from the United States
Census Bureau for 2010 [12]. Details on the sample design, other methods, and response rates
are found in S5 Text. Caloric intake from beverages consumed was calculated using nutrition
data from product websites, nutrition facts panel data from Mintel [14], and US Department
of Agriculture databases [17,18].
Analytical approaches
Changes in prices.
Prices were calculated based on prices paid, excluding sales tax and
California Redemption Value bottle fee. Inflation-adjusted prices were derived by applying the
US Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the monthly average price of
non-alcoholic beverages [19] to price measures, using January 2013 as the base. To measure
changes in price after imposition of the tax, known as “pass-through,” using prices from the
store price surveys, we compared the mean prices in cents/ounce of beverage products col-
lected across the 26 stores in Berkeley at three time points (December 2014, June 2015, and
March 2016) using paired t-tests. Data were analyzed using only beverages that could be
matched for product and size across all three rounds, reflecting same product prices, rather
than total consumer experience. For details see S1 Text.
Point-of-sale data included repeated measures of beverages sold (at barcode level) at both
Berkeley and non-Berkeley stores, during both pre-tax and post-tax periods (see S2 Text for
details). We used a fixed effects approach using the price (cents/ounce) of taxed beverages per
barcode-month-store as the outcome, controlling for month-year (relative to January 2013)
and potential underreporting due to data that were missing completely at random because of
technical (data storage) issues for some stores on random days that contributed to the monthly
value. For model specifications, see S3 Text. From the models, adjusted beverage prices (cents/
ounce) in Berkeley versus non-Berkeley stores overall and by beverage category were derived.
Since the tax implementation timeline was altered, the January–February 2015 period was
ambiguous with regards to tax implementation and price change, so we compared prices from
March–December in 2016 to the same 10-month period in earlier years. All analyses were con-
ducted in Stata 13 [20].
Changes in sales and store revenue (consumer spending).
Store-day data on the volume
of taxed and untaxed beverages (ounces per transaction) and average daily store revenues
(CPI-adjusted dollars per transaction) from all sales were the key outcomes and were modeled
separately. We examined whether there were differences in these outcomes in non-Berkeley
stores by distance from Berkeley. Comparison stores were classified into zones: zone 1,

 adjacent to Berkeley (two stores in two cities); zone 2, San Francisco (one store); and zone 3,
�20 miles (three stores in three cities) (see map in S4 Text). Since the beverage volume distri-
butions (and their residuals) were skewed, outcomes were log-transformed to normalize distri-
butions. For the volume outcomes, ordinary least squares models were used, with controls for
store ID, day of week, holiday and holiday eve, month, year, number of transactions (linear
and quadratic), a post-tax indicator, and interactions of store ID with the post-tax indicator,
month, and year, correcting the standard errors by clustering the analyses at the city level. A
similar model was used for revenue per transaction (a measure of the gross revenue for the
stores as well as customer’s spending in these stores), excluding number of transactions as a
control.
To test whether the post-tax trend in sales differed significantly from the pre-tax trend, we
predicted taxed and untaxed beverage sale volume and store revenue per transaction if the
post-tax indicator = 0 during March 2015–February 2016 (i.e., a “counterfactual” for if the tax
had not been implemented [9]) and compared these predicted values to the adjusted volumes
observed during the post-tax period. For detailed specifications, see S4 Text.
Changes in usual intake of beverages.
Using a repeated cross-sectional approach, the
National Cancer Institute method was used to estimate the usual intake distribution (kilocalo-
ries/day and grams/day) of taxed and untaxed beverages in each year, controlling for age,
gender, race/ethnicity, education, income, weekend (including Friday), and recall sequence
[21,22]. To account for the large proportion of nonconsumers for taxed beverages, a two-part
probability-amount nonlinear mixed model was fitted [23,24], while a one-part nonlinear
mixed model was fitted for untaxed beverages. Standard errors were estimated via bootstrap-
ping, with 200 replications. The primary outcomes of interest were change in calories and
grams consumed from taxed beverages, using a two-sided test with statistical significance set
at p < 0.05. For modeling approach, see S6 Text.
Results
Store price survey prices
Prices of taxed beverages collected in all three time points across large supermarkets showed
increases from December 2014 (pre-tax) to June 2015 (1.31¢/oz), which continued for Decem-
ber 2014 to March 2016 (1.07¢/oz). Taxed beverages in small chain supermarkets and gas sta-
tions also had price increases from December 2014 to June 2015 (2.20¢/oz) that continued
through March 2016 (1.31¢/oz). Price increases were comparatively lower in pharmacies for
both intervals (0.90¢/oz and 0.45¢/oz) and were not seen in independent corner stores and gas
stations (−0.09¢/oz and −0.64¢/oz) (S3 Table). The difference between prices of taxed and
untaxed beverages (cents/ounce) increased in all store types between December 2014 and
March 2016, except for beverages sold in independent corner stores and gas stations (Fig 2).
Point-of-sale prices from two supermarket chains
Fig 3 shows the model adjusted sales-unweighted beverage prices in Berkeley and non-Berke-
ley stores, illustrating the price differential for taxed versus untaxed beverages and change in
prices of taxed beverages over time. Among taxed beverages, there were visible price increases
in Berkeley stores after January 2015, but it was not until around April 2015 that prices stabi-
lized. Specifically, among the Berkeley stores, taxed beverages had price change of +0.83¢/oz
(p < 0.001), while this was only +0.16¢/oz (p < 0.001) in non-Berkeley stores, for a net differ-
ence of +0.67¢/oz (p < 0.001). Meanwhile, there were no statistically significant differences
in the prices of untaxed beverages between Berkeley and non-Berkeley stores in the post-
tax period. Sales-unweighted pass-through was complete among sodas and energy drinks

price changes for taxed beverages was similar, at +0.69¢/oz (S9 Table).
Point-of-sale volume sold in two supermarket chains
The volume of untaxed beverages sold was consistently higher than for taxed beverages in all
locations January 2013–February 2016 (Fig 4), and both types of sales were consistently and
markedly lower in Berkeley than in comparison stores overall, and most notably in neighbor-
ing zone 1 stores, suggesting lower baseline purchasing of SSBs and of beverages in general.
Focusing on the post-tax period, our model adjusted estimates show that compared to their
counterfactuals, volume (ounces/transaction) of taxed beverages sold fell significantly by 9.6%
for untaxed beverages. Prices account for inflation. Values in bold italics show the price difference between taxed and untaxed beverages. *Statistically

rose by 3.5% in Berkeley stores and 0.5% in non-Berkeley stores (Fig 4B), and sales of all study
beverages increased by 0.7% and 1.5% in Berkeley and non-Berkeley stores, respectively (Fig

1) had the highest increase in sales of taxed and untaxed beverages, whereas sales of taxed bev-
erages declined in more distant zone 3. S11 Table shows the results by untaxed beverage cate-
gory for Berkeley versus non-Berkeley stores.
Point-of-sale store revenue (consumer spending) per transaction in two
supermarket chains
Over the first year of the SSB tax, across both comparison and Berkeley stores, there was a
small reduction in revenue in CPI-adjusted dollars per transaction from all sources (not just
beverages). Mean store revenue per transaction fell by 18¢ less in Berkeley stores (−$0.36, p <
0.001) compared to non-Berkeley stores (−$0.54, p < 0.001) (see Fig 5).
Usual intake of beverages from self-reports
At baseline (November–December 2014), 649 of 3,721 eligible and contactable Berkeley resi-
dents age �18 y participated (17.4% cooperation), of whom 253 completed a second 24-h bev-
erage recall. At follow-up (November–December 2015), 654 Berkeley residents participated,
and 462 completed a second 24-h beverage recall; 346 (53.3%) of the 2015 respondents had
completed the baseline survey. After exclusion due to missing values on self-reported race/eth-
nicity, age, education, income, and monthly intake of SSBs, the final analytic sample included
623 at baseline and 613 at follow-up.
S12 Table provides details on beverage subcategories by tax status and percent consumers
within subcategory before and after the tax. The Berkeley sample had lower per capita and per
consumer mean caloric intake from both taxed and untaxed beverages relative to the general
US population (S13 Table). At baseline, 29% of the Berkeley sample consumed SSBs, substan-
tially below the 58% of consumers in the US population estimated in the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey. Daily usual taxed beverage intake was 121 g/d pre-tax and 97

 kcal/d to 39 kcal/d (−19.8%, p = 0.56) (Table 1); neither difference is statistically significant.
From the pre- to post-tax period, mean volume of untaxed beverage intake went from 1,839
g/d to 1,897 g/d (+3.2%, p = 0.21). Reported mean caloric intake of untaxed beverages rose
from 116 kcal/d to 148 kcal/d (+27.6%, p = 0.02). The increase in untaxed calories appeared to
be mainly from increased milk intake and also “other” beverages (which included dairy-based
beverages such as yogurt smoothies and milkshakes). Neither juice nor diet soda intake
increased. There was no significant change in reported beverage shopping location: “in Berke-
ley” was 90% at baseline versus 94% at follow-up (p = 0.17).
Discussion
A year following SSB tax implementation in Berkeley, California, there was heterogeneous
pass-through of Berkeley’s SSB excise tax across store and beverage types. SSB sales in Berkeley
fell significantly in two chains of large supermarkets, while sales of untaxed beverages, espe-
cially water, and of all beverages increased. From the available data, there was no evidence of
higher consumer spending, nor was there a greater reduction in store revenue per transaction
in relation to comparison sites. Changes in self-reported SSB intake were not statistically
significant.

 For taxes to directly affect consumption, beverage distributors (upon whom the tax is levied)
have to pass the tax on to retailers, and retailers likewise need to pass the tax on to consumers.
Tax pass-through in the store price survey was predominant in larger and chain stores but var-
ied in degree and implementation speed by store type, possibly reflecting delayed implementa-
tion for “self-distributing” stores. Focusing on large supermarkets, scanner data from two
chains showed that the tax was partially passed through for SSBs and that pass-through varied
across SSB types, being highest for carbonated beverages. This may have been due to confusion
on what products were taxed, and how distributors and retailers responded to the tax based on
market shares of their beverages. These findings resemble findings in Mexico [10] and France
[25], where pass-through was complete on carbonated SSBs and lower on noncarbonated prod-
ucts. Falbe et al. [26] examined pass-through in Berkeley and comparison cities in the first
3 months post-tax, with similar findings. Cawley and Frisvold [27] examined pass-though also
after only 3 months of the tax—9 months prior to full implementation of the tax in small retail-
ers—and for a smaller panel of products (five products in several sizes each), and found lower
pass-through then Falbe et al.; however, they did not have an adequate sample size of small
non-chain stores [27]. The present study examined a larger group of beverage products over a
full year, including the second stage of tax implementation in the third store price survey. Pass-
through may still evolve, as some price changes emerged later in the year. Consumers also saw
greater price differentials between taxed and untaxed beverages across all store types. Jurisdic-
tions may wish to include recommendations to retailers in future policies to pass through the
tax to SSBs. Cook County, Illinois, included a requirement to do so in their measure [28].
Despite incomplete pass-through of the SSB tax in the two chains of large supermarkets, the
volume of SSBs sold fell by 9.6% in Berkeley stores. The volume of beverages sold per transac-
tion as a whole rose in Berkeley, and shopping location did not change. This study was also
unique in permitting examination of overall consumer spending at the stores studied, which
did not increase, a concern widely cited by opponents of SSB taxes [29]. This study found that
consumer spending, measured as store revenue per transaction, declined slightly, falling less in
Berkeley stores than in comparison stores, despite increasing overall beverage sales in Berkeley.
This appears to belie, at least in the chains studied, beverage industry arguments that such
policies will raise grocery bills in general or that they will hurt local business. The volume of
SSBs bought in stores nearest to Berkeley rose, consistent with either potential shifts to buying
SSBs outside Berkeley (not reported in the telephone survey) or increasing consumption by

 residents of the non-Berkeley cities, as found by Falbe et al. [30]. When taxes are implemented
in very small geographical areas such as Berkeley, shifts in shopping location may be a greater
risk. Recent approval of similar policies in three neighboring cities may reduce or displace any
shifting. Since Berkeley has on average higher education and median income and lower base-
line SSB consumption compared to the US in general, it was unclear whether the tax would be
high enough to change demand. In Berkeley, the post-tax sales of SSBs declined to a greater
degree than in Mexico, where the decline was 6% over the first year, and this decline is consis-
tent with earlier estimates that a 10% increase in soft drink prices would reduce consumption
by 8%–12% [31,32]. The decline may be due to concomitant high rates of residents in poverty.
Using a 3- to 10-min street intercept survey of low-income residents in Berkeley and
control cities, Falbe et al. found a significant 21% decline in the frequency of SSB intake in
Berkeley [30]. Our telephone study used calories and grams of reported intake rather than fre-
quency; our finding on change in mean daily SSB intake across the general population lacked
statistical significance, although it was of similar magnitude to that found by Falbe et al., with a
19.8% reduction in grams. Falbe et al. examined only water consumption for untaxed bever-
ages [30], while the present study asked about most untaxed beverages. The higher calories
from untaxed beverages in our self-reported post-tax survey came predominantly from two
sources: milks and “other” untaxed beverages, which included higher-fat beverages such as
yogurt smoothies, milkshakes, atole, horchata, and eggnog. These findings contrast with the
substitution pattern seen in our Berkeley point-of-sale data, which showed an increase in
water sales and smaller but still significant increases in sales of plain milk and untaxed fruit,
vegetable, and tea drinks, as well as a significant decline in untaxed diet drinks. Prior evidence
suggests that when individuals substitute beverages in the wake of increased SSB prices, they
are likely to choose water or diet soft drinks or fruit drinks [33], of which only fruit drinks
would add calories. Our point-of-sale data are consistent with regard to increases in sales of
water, and possibly fruit drinks, but not diet drinks. Since the point-of-sale data do not show
that sales of these “other” untaxed beverages rose meaningfully, perhaps there was an increase
in the intake of these beverages at home (prepared from fruit and plain yogurts or milks) or at
food-service locations. It is unclear whether consumption changes can be attributed to the tax,
and we do not want to speculate since the self-reported beverage intake component of our
study did not sample non-Berkeley residents, so we are unable to tell if the increase in the self-
reported intake of “other” untaxed beverages was a secular trend or specific to Berkeley. None-
theless, our results are consistent with Falbe et al.’s findings of small increases for frequency of
SSB intake in control communities, no change in location of SSB shopping, and an increase in
frequency of water intake in Berkeley [30].
In this comparatively low-SSB-consuming city, the city’s tax revenue over the first year of
the SSB tax was $1,416,973 (approximately $12 per capita) [34], roughly four times the 2015
per capita amount in the federal Prevention and Public Health Fund. Proceeds are being used
for child nutrition and community health programs [35]. This suggests that SSB taxes can pro-
vide significant revenue for prevention or other societal goals.
Limitations
This observational study cannot establish causal links between the SSB tax implementation
and changes in measured outcomes, nor did it assess health outcomes. It cannot distinguish
the longer-term effects of education and intensive media debate on SSBs in the communities
surrounding the San Francisco Bay as a result of tax and other preexisting campaigns in both
Berkeley and San Francisco in 2014, although, in contrast to Falbe et al.’s work, baseline store
price survey and consumption data were collected after those campaigns but before tax

 implementation, mitigating this issue somewhat. Our selection of comparison sites used cities
that had been exposed to similar educational campaigns and to the Bay Area tax media cam-
paigns (both for and against), so that the difference-in-difference analysis more purely reflects
the effects of the tax itself. The alternative of a more distant control would have better captured
the combined effects of the campaigns and the tax itself.
This study also cannot clarify whether distributors, retailers, and/or consumers altered their
behaviors in anticipation of the SSB tax or to what degree changes in these various parties’
behaviors were associated with changes in prices and sales. The 26-store survey sample was
less representative of small and independent stores than of larger groceries. Analysis of con-
sumption was limited by the small effect size in relation to high standard error and Berkeley’s
low baseline consumption, leading to an underpowered sample, and by the absence of a com-
parison community, suggesting the need for a larger, controlled sample, optimally with higher
SSB consumption, more reflective of national consumption patterns. Obtaining such a sample
in Berkeley proved unfeasible using the random digit dialing approach and available resources
in the time-sensitive 6-wk window between passage of the tax and the original implementation
date of 1 January 2015, when baseline survey data were collected.
Despite the large number of transactions, while many grocers were invited, scanner data
were limited to two chains of large supermarkets and are not generalizable to all stores or store
types. Independently owned small corner stores, in particular, are very different, did not
exhibit price changes in our data, and may not have reliable records on their sales. Conse-
quently, Berkeley consumers may have shifted their SSB purchases to independent stores, but
our data are unable to determine this. The differential pass-through also warrants further
investigation. However, in separate descriptive analyses of food purchases for the Bay Area
from the 2014 Nielsen Homescan data [36,37], about 50% of the volume of beverages pur-
chased is from chain groceries (with �10 locations nationwide), and only about 2% from inde-
pendent stores (<10 locations nationally) (per our own calculations) [36]. For this reason,
chain groceries likely constitute the most significant consumer SSB purchasing setting.
Strengths of this study include an intimate understanding of the local implementation pro-
cess, the ability to sample large and small stores and chains, and the large volume of transac-
tions studied. These strengths allow us to begin learning where and to what degree the tax was
implemented as well as to observe changes in prices, volume sold, and store revenue.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that implementing a SSB excise tax was feasible and SSB sales fell con-
comitantly, while the tax captured revenue for obesity prevention and other societal goals.
Whether observed changes in sales were related to enactment of the tax or other local activities
cannot be definitively determined due to the observational design. However, the observation
of price increases for SSBs in two distinct data sources, the timing of those increases, and the
patterns of change in taxed and untaxed beverage sales suggest that the observed changes may
be attributable to the tax. Assessment of newly approved SSB taxes in a number of other cities/
counties in the US at 1–2¢/oz will be important, and associations of taxation with substitutions
in beverage sales and intake should be further assessed in settings with more typical consump-
tion and using larger samples.
