Summary
Objective: We investigate whether physicians in secondary
care in the English NHS receive adequate training to rec-
ognise and appropriately refer for services those persons
suspected to be victims of human trafficking.
Design: Freedom of Information requests were sent to the
105 England’s NHS Trusts delivering acute care in England.
Setting: NHS Trusts providing secondary care in England.
Participants: English NHS Trusts.
Main outcome measures: We requested data about the
training provided on human trafficking to clinicians, includ-
ing the nature, delivery, and format of any education, and
any planned training.
Results: A total of 89.5% of the 105 Trusts responded.
Of these Trusts, 69% provide education to physicians on
human trafficking, and a further 6% provide training but did
not specify who received it. The majority of Trusts provid-
ing training did so within wider safeguarding provision
(91%). Only one trust reported that it provides stand-
alone training on trafficking to all its staff, including phys-
icians. Within training offered by Trusts, 54% observed best
practice providing training on the clinical indicators of
trafficking, while 16% referenced the National Referral
Mechanism. Amongst those not providing training, 39% of
Trusts report provision is in development.
Conclusions: Our results find that 25% of NHS Foundation
Trusts appear to lack training for physicians around human
trafficking. It is also of concern that of the Trusts who cur-
rently do not provide training, only 39% are developing
training or planning to do so. There is an urgent need to
review and update the scope of available training and bring
it into alignment with current legislation.

Background
Human trafficking – now known in the United
Kingdom (UK) often by the broader term ‘modern
slavery’ – is a growing and abhorrent crime, involving
the
exploitation
of
both
adults
and
children.1
At present, individuals are exploited in the sex trade
(including in prostitution, escort work, and pornog-
raphy), in forced labour (across the manufacturing,
farming, construction, entertainment, and tourism
industries), through organ harvesting, and in domes-
tic servitude, amongst other trades.1,2
Human trafficking is an escalating problem in the
UK and the rest of Europe. There is scant data on its
actual scale, but in England between 10,000 and
13,000 individuals are believed to be trafficked each
year.3 The vast majority of trafficked persons remain
unassisted, a failure that has deleterious consequences
for mental and physical health. Alongside the on-
going refugee crises and recent Brexit vote which
looks to restrict legal migration routes, there is a
danger that trafficking within and to the UK will
increase.4,5
The broad spectrum of abuse categories that fall
under the ‘trafficking’ term leads to a wide variety of
physical and psychological sequelae. The heterogeneity
of clinical presentation amongst victims of human traf-
ficking presents a great challenge to healthcare workers
seeking to identify and treat them. Health problems
can reflect the type or types of abuse suffered: for
example victims of sexual exploitation suffer higher
rates of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV
and Hepatitis B.6 However, general health trends
amongst this population have been observed: they
include an increased risk of suffering traumatic injuries
such as fractures, bruising, and bleeding; increased risk
of chronic pain; exacerbation of pre-existing chronic
disease; dental and nutritional problems; and mental
health disorders such as depression, personality dis-
orders, and anxiety disorders such as Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD), as well as an increased risk of
suicide and self-harm.7–13
Additionally, due to the nature of human trafficking
as a crime that relies on the isolation and disempower-
ment of its victims, several barriers exist to their

 engaging with healthcare professionals, for example
language difficulties, controlling behaviour by traf-
fickers, and a lack of awareness of entitlement on
the part of the victim.14 The nature of the clinical
presentation of such individuals, coupled with these
unique barriers to engagement, constitutes a signifi-
cant challenge to healthcare professionals who come
into contact with them. And yet, research and policy
widely acknowledge that healthcare professionals
are advantageously positioned to identify and assist
trafficked
individuals,
sometimes
uniquely
and
exclusively so.15–17 In its 2015–2017 ‘Strategic Plan’,
the UK Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner has
confirmed that healthcare professionals, including
doctors, play a vital role in victim identification.15
For this to happen physicians must first be aware
of risk factors, clinical indicators, and appropriate
response strategies. Clinical indicators include, for
example, traumatic injuries consistent with manual
labour or physical and/or sexual abuse, the presence
of a ‘minder’, inability to speak the local language,
evidence of international migration, and work in
a job sector associated with trafficking.18 Victims
of trafficking can present to both primary and second-
ary care.14
Until recently, scant research had been done in the
UK on the context and scale of contact between
healthcare professionals and trafficked individuals.
Recent studies have observed that such contact
occurs in both primary and secondary care settings.7,14
Despite this, however, the UK response to trafficking,
until recently, neglected to involve consistent training
and engagement with the health sector.19 In the setting
of secondary care it has been shown that victims of
trafficking can present to a wide variety of specialties
and services, including emergency medicine, sexual
health, maternity services, paediatrics, gynaecology,
as well as other general medical specialties.14,16
However, it is speculated that current physician train-
ing is inadequate. One recent cross-sectional survey of
782 NHS professionals in secondary care settings
found that 86.8% of participants reported lacking
knowledge of how to identify potential victims of
human trafficking, and 78.3% reported they lacked
the knowledge and confidence to assist trafficked
people.7 This gap likely arises from inadequacies in
training available. Indeed, the same study concluded
that better training provision for healthcare workers
would improve their ability and preparedness to iden-
tify and appropriately treat and refer victims of human
trafficking who might otherwise remain untreated.7
We acknowledge that more research is needed in
both primary and secondary care; the focus of this
short
study
is
on
the
latter;
we
ask
whether
England’s physicians in the setting of secondary
care receive sufficient training to recognise and appro-
priately refer for services those persons suspected to
be victims of human trafficking.
Methods
Information on training provision specific to human
trafficking within NHS Trusts is not publicly available.
We sent Freedom of Information requests to 105 NHS
Foundation Trusts and Trusts providing acute hos-
pital care in England in 2016 (see Appendix 1).
These Trusts were identified via the NHS website,
with information from the Quality Assurance Agency
(QAA) and UK Government’s website,20–22 and rep-
resented all relevant Trusts providing acute secondary
care. The scope of the study necessitated a focussed
approach on secondary care, but the authors acknow-
ledge
the
need
for
research
in
primary
care
also. According to the legislation, the Trusts have 20
business days to respond.
The request contained an initial closed question
directed to identify provision of training on traffick-
ing. Based on the answer of either ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to this
initial question, further closed questions were then
asked about the extent, content, and any planned
future provision. For example, Trusts who answered
‘yes’ were asked whether they provided training to
clinical staff, and in particular doctors at various
levels of seniority. Trusts were not required to pro-
vide a breakdown of other clinical staff receiving
training.
Where
responses
did
not
follow
the
Freedom of Information structure or were ambigu-
ous, to reduce bias, we sought clarification from the
relevant information governance officer, or where
possible entered data in line with the original
Freedom of Information question structure.
Results
Out of 105 Trusts, 94 Trusts (89.5%) provided a
response to the Freedom of Information, while 11
(10.5%) did not reply to the request or any follow-up
in contravention of the Freedom of Information Act
2001. Ofthe 94Trusts providing answers to the request,
two declined to respond citing exemptions in the legis-
lation, giving a response for analysis rate of 87.6%.
Provision of training
Figure 1 shows the results of the survey. Sixty-five
Trusts (69%) responded that they provide training
for physicians on human trafficking. Additionally,
four Trusts (4%) stated that they provide training
to clinical staff but did not specify which staff
groups. In total, 69 Trusts (75%) responded that
2

 they provide training for some or all staff. Twenty-
three Trusts (25%) do not provide any training, either
indicating that they are only mentioning in passing
the issue (8%, n ¼ 7) or not providing any mention
of the issue (17%, n ¼ 16). Of those not offering train-
ing, 39% (n ¼ 9) responded that training is in devel-
opment. Two Trusts (2%) identified that they were
considering requiring staff to complete the Human
Trafficking Programme via Electronic Staff Record
– a digital platform offering e-Learning for staff in
the NHS. Next, we evaluated the content of training
among those 69 Trusts that provide it.
Training content
Of the 69 Trusts identified as providing training, 21
(30%) provided training to all their staff and 39
(57%) to all clinical staff, both of which criteria include
physicians. Only two (3%) Trusts separated training
by medical grade, and four (6%) provided training to
only specific staff groups in certain specialties, namely
those working in Emergency Medicine or those work-
ing with children. Of the Trusts that provide training
to all clinical staff, two (3%) provide more focussed
specialty specific training in addition to general provi-
sion. Four Trusts (6%) declined to specify.
The 69 Trusts identifying provision were asked to
provide details on the training content and delivery.
One Trust (1.5%) reported that they provide stand-
alone training on the subject of human trafficking to
all staff, while 63 Trusts (91.5%) provided training as
part of safeguarding training – either safeguarding
adults or children, or both. Notably, two Trusts
also reported that alongside this general safeguarding
training, stand-alone training is provided to specific
key staff groups (e.g. A&E consultants and nurses).
Five Trusts (7%) did not specify whether their train-
ing was standalone or not. Trusts were not asked if
training was mandatory.
Of the training on human trafficking that was
included in safeguarding by 63 Trusts, they differed
as where in the general safeguarding provision such
training was provided. For example, 30% (n ¼ 19) of
Trusts included trafficking training in the content on
safeguarding adults, 8% (n ¼ 5) included it only in safe-
guardingchildren, 30% (n ¼ 19) included it within both
safeguarding adults and children training, and 32%
(n ¼ 20) of Trusts did not respond on this question.
Trusts were asked whether the training they pro-
vided included reference to the clinical indicators of
human trafficking, a key point in recognised best
practice in training.17,23 Of the 69 Trusts providing
training, 37 (54%) reported that their training con-
tained content on clinical indicators, 26 (38%)
reported that their training did not contain the rele-
vant content, three (4%) stated they provide training
to specific staff groups on clinical indicators, and
three Trusts (4%) declined to answer the question
(see Figure 2).
Trusts were asked whether the training they pro-
vided included reference to the National Referral
Mechanism, the official pathway for the identification
and support of victims of human trafficking or
modern slavery in the UK. Of the 69 Trusts providing
training, 11 (16%) replied that the National Referral
Mechanism is covered, 50 (72%) did not refer to the
National Referral Mechanism, two (3%) said they
provide training to specific staff groups, which refer-
enced the National Referral Mechanism, and six
(9%) declined to answer the question (see Figure 3).

 Mechanism for training delivery
Trusts were also askedhow theydelivered their teaching
on human trafficking, in light of recent findings that
online only modules may have decreased efficacy, and
that they may be being reproduced without adequate
updatingandevaluation.24,25Ofthe69Trustsproviding
training, 28 Trusts offered combined methods of teach-
ing, while 27 Trusts (39%) delivered face-to-face teach-
ing, and three Trusts (4%) provided e-Learning delivery
only. Three Trusts (4%) only used workbooks. One
Trust (1%) used face-to-face teaching combined with
workbooks. Eight Trusts (12%) declined to specify.
Of the non-providing Trusts, four (6%) said
that they were considering requiring staff to com-
plete
the
Human
Trafficking
Programme
via
e-Learning for Healthcare, an admirable national
training platform delivered electronically via the
Electronic Staff Record.

Discussion
Our evidence reveals that training on human traffick-
ing in hospitals in the NHS England is inconsistent,
with gaps in training provision that are deeply con-
cerning. Over one-fifth of Trusts appear to provide no
training, either apart from or within safeguarding
training. Of the Trusts providing training, about
40% do not adhere to best practices. These results
help account for why healthcare workers lack the
confidence and knowledge to address trafficking; a
significant number of clinicians lack training.7
The clinical implications of such a lack of training
could constitute the failure of a duty of care on the part
of the NHS to appropriately identify and treat victims of
human trafficking, whose health needs are significant,
and whose identification is challenging.7,14,16 One US

 study estimates that 28% of trafficking survivors came
into contact with healthcare professionals at some point
during captivity.26 According to the UK’s newly
appointed
Independent
Anti-Slavery
Commissioner
(IASC), such contact represents a crucial opportunity
for intervention and constitutes a vital part of govern-
mental strategy to combat modern slavery as a whole.15
This is not to mention the profound beneficial impact
that it could have upon victims of this crime.
As with all request approaches, our analysis has sev-
eral limitations. Eleven Trusts did not reply to the
request or subsequent emails, in contravention to the
legislation, leaving us with an incomplete data set. We
followed up these Trusts to improve compliance with
future information requests. Also, some Trusts failed to
answer the questions in alignment with the request,
instead providing extended prose. We moved the
data into alignment with the questions, which may
have
introduced
bias
through
our
classification.
Additionally, because requests are sent to information
governance officers who acquire data from other staff
to answer to the request, there is also a chance these
officers may have introduced bias when interpreting
responses from safeguarding leads or training leads.
Our observations clearly, though, have implications
for both policy development and NHS training provi-
sion. For policy, there is an urgent need to develop
training in those 22 Trusts that appear to lack it. At
present, the lack of training stands in contrast to legal
requirements set out in the Care Act 2014 and Modern
Slavery Act 2015 for safeguarding adults and children
from abuse and neglect, including human trafficking.27
The Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner could
liaise with these Trusts to help speed up the process
and aid those Trusts with training in development.
For training, several Trusts’ training programmes
did not adhere to best practices, which could be rec-
tified in several ways. One area of development per-
tains to the indication that Trusts use or intend to use
the e-Learning for Healthcare platform as a sole
mechanism for delivery of training, which is concern-
ing as this module is out of date following the incep-
tion of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, and fails to
encourage completion of the MS1 form – a new ano-
nymous data collection form directed to improve
information on trafficking in the UK.3 Additionally,
several Trusts revealed in their responses to us that
they do not have access for all staff to this platform
due to human resource processes, so its use must be
extended as well as revised.
A second area for training development is in provid-
ing specialised guidance and training on clinical indica-
tors.7,17 This is important because persons subjected to
trafficking can display a wide variety of health prob-
lems, as detailed above, or may have ‘no obvious risk
factors or indicators of abuse’.16 Clinicians should also
proactively obtain information on vulnerable migrants,
including trafficked persons, especially in the wake of
recent national and regional developments.
Additionally, training needs to cover both adult
and child trafficking. We found that 43% of training
was exclusively geared towards one group only. This is
troubling as when referring using the National
Referral Mechanism, consent is required if the patient
is an adult, but not if they are a child.28 Limiting train-
ing to one framework may result in clinicians lacking
awareness of the diversity of individuals covered by
current charging exemptions and referral mechanisms.
Vulnerable adult and child migrants may be missed, or
may be inappropriately charged for their healthcare; a
potential outcome that may compound the stress and
harm they are already experiencing.
Taken together, it is clear that training of phys-
icians on human trafficking is inconsistent and vari-
able. The new Anti-Slavery Commissioner places
healthcare at the centre of anti-trafficking strategies.
Our analysis reveals a critical need to improve training
of healthcare professionals in the NHS to give staff the
necessary expertise and confidence to effectively iden-
tify and refer individuals they suspect have been traf-
ficked. Where training does not exist it should be
developed, and where training does exist, especially
where it is e-Learning based, it should be qualitatively
evaluated, improved, and regularly updated. Because
the training we have discussed is ultimately an issue of
patient protection, we suggest that the existence and
quality of training could be part of Care Quality
Commission evaluation of hospitals as an expansion
of their current remit. We recognise that this would
have to be designed carefully amid recent suggestions
of
‘gaming’
at
hospitals
under
Care
Quality
Commission inspection.29 We currently have a critical
moment for the profession to take a leading role in the
newly announced £14 m anti-trafficking commitment,
but this requires every clinician to be informed and to
act to address this most abhorrent crime.
