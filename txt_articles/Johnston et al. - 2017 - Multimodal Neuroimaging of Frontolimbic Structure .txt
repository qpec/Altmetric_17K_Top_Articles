Abstract
Objective—Bipolar disorder is associated with high risk for suicide behavior that often develops 
in adolescence/young adulthood. Elucidation of involved neural systems is critical for prevention. 
This study of adolescents/young adults with bipolar disorder with and without history of suicide 
attempts combines structural, diffusion tensor and functional magnetic resonance imaging 
methods to investigate implicated abnormalities in structural and functional connectivity within 
fronto-limbic systems.
Method—Participants with bipolar disorder included 26 with a prior suicide attempt and 42 
without attempts. Regional gray matter volume, white matter integrity and functional connectivity 
during processing of emotional stimuli were compared between groups and differences were 
explored for relationships between imaging modalities and associations with suicide-related 
symptoms and behaviors.
Results—Compared to the non-attempter group, the attempter group showed reductions in gray 
matter volume in orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum; white matter integrity in 
uncinate fasciculus, ventral frontal and right cerebellum regions; and amygdala functional 
connectivity to left ventral and right rostral prefrontal cortex (p<0.05, corrected). In exploratory 
analyses, among attempters, right rostral prefrontal connectivity was negatively correlated with 
suicidal ideation (p<0.05), and left ventral prefrontal connectivity was negatively correlated with 
attempt lethality (p<0.05).
Conclusions—Adolescent/young adult suicide attempters with bipolar disorder demonstrate less 
gray matter volume and decreased structural and functional connectivity in a ventral fronto-limbic

 neural system subserving emotion regulation. Among suicide attempters, reductions in amygdala-
prefrontal functional connectivity may be associated with severity of suicide ideation and attempt 
lethality.
Introduction
As many as 56% of individuals with bipolar disorder attempt suicide and 15–19% die by 
suicide (1). Suicidal behavior is a leading cause of death and often commences during 
adolescence/young adulthood, when fronto-limbic systems implicated in suicide behavior 
are maturing. Thus, elucidating neural underpinnings of suicide behavior during 
adolescence/young adulthood may improve early identification and prevention.
Convergent neuroimaging evidence in adult attempters across psychiatric disorders supports 
involvement of fronto-limbic system structural and functional abnormalities. Structural 
magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and functional neuroimaging [functional MRI (fMRI) 
and positron emission tomography] studies in adult attempters have shown decreased gray 
matter volume and frontal dysfunction during emotion stimulus processing (2), particularly 
in ventral prefrontal cortex. Postmortem findings in suicides suggest decreased ventral 
prefrontal neuroreceptor binding and neurotrophic factors (3, 4). Also implicated are ventral 
prefrontal connection sites subserving emotion and impulse processing/regulation, including 
anterior cingulate cortex, insula, thalamus, striatum, and amygdala (5).
Suicide behavior has been linked to reduced structural integrity and functional fronto-limbic 
connections in adults in postmortem (6), sMRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and fMRI 
studies (5), though few were conducted in bipolar disorder specifically.
Data on neural circuitry associated with suicide attempts in adolescents/young adults are 
scant. Initial reports suggest consistencies with adults in reduced frontal gray matter, altered 
frontotemporal system responses to negative emotional stimuli and white matter 
abnormalities (5). Adolescent sample sizes have been low and most have had major 
depressive disorder.
Single modality structural and functional imaging studies in attempters implicate structure-
function relationships, suggesting a need for multimodal studies. Few studies have examined 
associations of imaging measures with suicide-related symptom/behaviors, such as attempt 
lethality, ideation, intent, impulsivity and hopelessness. In adult attempters, ventral 
prefrontal volume decreases and dysfunction have been linked to lethality (7, 8), frontal 
dysfunction and white matter abnormalities to ideation (9, 10), and orbitofrontal white 
matter fractional anisotropy decreases to impulsivity in bipolar disorder (11). Imaging 
studies of suicide ideation are rare (1); one study of ideation in pediatric epilepsy showed 
decreased orbitofrontal white matter (12).
This study in bipolar disorder of adolescent/young adult attempters, compared to non-
attempters, combines sMRI, DTI and fMRI connectivity methods to study gray matter 
volume, white matter integrity and functional connectivity. We hypothesized attempters 
would show lower ventral frontal and mesial temporal gray matter, lower white matter 
fractional anisotropy and functional connectivity in their connections. We explored

 relationships between imaging findings across modalities and with attempt lethality, 
anticipating ventral prefrontal associations, and with suicidal ideation and intent, 
hopelessness and impulsivity. We explored comparisons to a healthy adolescent/young adult 
group.
Method
Subjects
Participants included 68 with bipolar disorder (age range: 14–25yrs): 26 with ≥1 suicide 
attempt (attempters), 42 without attempts (non-attempters) (Table 1). A healthy comparator 
group (n=45, Mage=20.8±3.3; range 15–25, 58% female) had no lifetime DSM-IV Axis I 
disorders or suicide attempt or first-degree relative with a major mood or psychotic disorder 
or suicide attempt. Family history was assessed with the Family History-Research 
Diagnostic Criteria (13). Written informed consent was obtained from participants ≥18yrs, 
and permission from parents/guardians and assent from minors, in accordance with the Yale 
University Institutional Review Board. Presence/absence of Axis I diagnoses and mood state 
at scanning were confirmed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Diagnosis 
(First MB, Spitzer RL, Gibbon M, Williams JBW, NY, 1998) for participants ≥18yrs and 
Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (14) if <18yrs. Adolescents 
were mid-to-late pubertal. No subject had history of loss of consciousness ≥5min, or 
neurological/major medical disorder, except treated hypothyroidism [2(8%) attempters, 
1(2%) non-attempters].
Suicide attempts, defined as self-injurious acts committed with at least some intent to die, 
were assessed using the Columbia Suicide History Form (15) and medical lethality with the 
Beck Medical Lethality Scale (16). The Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (17) assessed 
suicide ideation severity and Suicide Intent Scale (16) past intent to die. Additional 
assessments included the Beck Hopelessness Scale (18) and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 
(19).
MRI Acquisition
The scanning session for each subject included high-resolution sMRI, DTI and fMRI using a 
single 3-Tesla Siemens Trio MR scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Sagittal sMRI 
images were acquired with a three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition 
gradient-echo T1-weighted sequence with parameters: repetition time (TR)=1500ms, echo 
time (TE)=2.83ms, matrix=256×256, field of view=256mmx256mm, 160 1mm slices 
without gap and two averages. DTI acquisition was aligned with the anterior commissure-
posterior commissure plane. Diffusion sensitizing gradients were applied along 32 non-
collinear directions with b-value=1000sec/mm2 and an acquisition without diffusion 
weighting b-value=0, TR=7400msec, TE=115msec, matrix=128×128, field of 
view=256mmx256mm and 40 3mm slices without gap. FMRI data were acquired with a 
single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence aligned to DTI: TR=2000msec, TE=25msec, 
matrix=64×64, field of view=240mmx240mm and 32 3mm slices without gap. Participants 
performed an fMRI event-related emotional face task (20), viewing faces depicting happy, 
neutral or fearful expressions with button press to indicate if a female or male face.

 SMRI Processing
Images were processed with Statistical Parametric Mapping 5 (SPM5) (http://
www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), with the segmentation function implemented for bias correction, 
spatial normalization and segmentation of the original structural images in the same model. 
SPM5 tissue probability maps (voxels 2×2×2mm3) guided normalization and segmentation. 
To ensure overall tissue amount in a class was not altered, a “modulation” step was used 
during normalization. Gray matter images were smoothed with an 8mm full-width-at-half-
maximum (FWHM) isotropic kernel (21).
DTI Processing
Diffusion-weighted data were interpolated to 1.5mm isotropic voxels and denoised by a 
three-dimensional isotropic Sigma 2mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. Diffusion eigenvectors 
and corresponding eigenvalues (λ1,λ2,λ3) were acquired after diagonalization of DTI data. 
Fractional anisotropy was calculated and whole brain fractional anisotropy maps were 
normalized with SPM5 to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using a tissue 
probability map of white matter template, resampled to 2×2×2mm3 during normalization 
and spatially smoothed at 10mm FWHM (22).
Functional Connectivity Processing
FMRI processing was performed with SPM8 (20). The first two images of each run were 
discarded to account for hemodynamic delay. Remaining images were realigned, then 
spatially normalized to MNI space. FMRI data were resampled to voxels 3×3×3mm3 during 
normalization and smoothed at 8mm FWHM. Event-related response amplitudes were 
estimated using the general linear model (23) at the individual subject level for each of the 
three emotion event types: happy, neutral and fearful expressions. For each subject, this 
created statistical images of the BOLD signal change related to the three emotional event 
types versus the baseline fixation cross-hair control (24). A bilateral amygdala seed region 
of interest (ROI) was defined with the Wake Forest University PickAtlas Tool (http://
www.fmri.wfubmc.edu/download.htm). The amygdala was chosen because it is implicated 
in suicidal behavior (5), has strong connectivity with other implicated regions showing 
decreased connectivity to it in adolescents/adults with bipolar disorder (20), and it may be 
less likely than cortex to show age-related changes in health and bipolar disorder (25, 26). 
For each subject, a mean time series for amygdala for each emotion type (happy, neutral, 
fearful) was calculated by averaging the time series for all ROI voxels. Correlational 
analyses were performed between the time series for the bilateral amygdala ROI with that 
for each brain voxel, resulting in a correlation map including the correlation coefficient for 
each voxel with that of the amygdala ROI, for each emotion type (20, 22). Correlation 
coefficients were transformed to Z-values using Fisher r-to-z transformation.
Statistical Analyses
Potential differences in age and gender across all three groups were assessed by one-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests, respectively. Within the bipolar sample, 
two-sample t-tests and chi-square tests were utilized to assess potential attempter group 
differences in impulsivity, hopelessness, suicide ideation severity, medication status (on/off),

 lifetime comorbid substance abuse/dependence (yes/no), mood state (euthymic, depressed, 
elevated), psychosis and rapid-cycling.
Within Imaging Modality Analyses—For primary hypothesis testing, two-sample t-tests 
were conducted in SPM to assess group differences in gray matter volume and fractional 
anisotropy, with age as a covariate. Findings were considered significant at p<0.005 
(uncorrected), if also meeting a spatial extent empirically determined by Monte Carlo 
simulation implemented in AlphaSim for a corrected significance of p<0.05. Group 
differences in functional connectivity were analyzed using two-sample t-tests in SPM, with 
age as a covariate and functional connectivity correlation coefficients (Z-scores) from 
amygdala to brain voxels as the dependent variables for each face condition (happy, neutral, 
fearful). Findings were Bonferroni corrected for the three emotion conditions at p<0.0016, 
and spatial extent empirically determined by Monte Carlo simulation. Results that survived 
to p<0.001, with and without AlphaSim spatial extent thresholding (p<0.05, corrected), are 
noted. Gray matter volumes, fractional anisotropy and functional connectivity correlation 
coefficients (Z-scores) were extracted from each cluster in which group differences were 
detected (MarsBar toolbox, http://marsbar.sourceforge.net).
Gender and medication effects on group differences were assessed with ANCOVA, but were 
not significant and dropped for parsimony. Exploratory analyses employed two-tailed two-
sample t-tests to determine whether extracted values in regions of difference differed by 
clinical factors: medication status, lifetime substance use disorders, psychosis or rapid-
cycling, and by one-way analysis of variance for mood state.
Associations between Imaging Modalities and with Behaviors—Correlational 
analyses were performed between gray matter volumes, fractional anisotropy, and functional 
connectivity correlation coefficients (Z-scores) from each cluster in which group differences 
were detected. Relationships between gray matter, white matter and functional connectivity 
abnormalities with suicide-related symptoms/behaviors (maximum lethality of attempts, 
intent for most lethal attempt, most severe ideation, and current hopelessness and 
impulsivity) were assessed using Spearman (rs) or Pearson (r) correlations as appropriate. 
Correlation analyses were performed in attempters only, and for all subjects, partial 
correlations (radj) were estimated controlling for group (attempter vs. non-attempter) using 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Given the exploratory nature of analyses, correlations 
were considered significant at p<0.05, uncorrected.
Healthy Group Comparisons—In secondary analyses, gray matter volumes, fractional 
anisotropy and functional connectivity correlation coefficients (Z-scores) were extracted for 
the healthy comparison group in each region of attempter and non-attempter group 
differences. Three-group (healthy comparison, attempter, non-attempter) one-way ANOVAs 
were performed, followed by Dunnett’s t-tests to control for multiple comparisons.
Results
Attempters and non-attempters did not differ from each other or from healthy controls in age 
or gender. Attempters and non-attempters differed significantly in suicide ideation severity

 [t(60) = 5.95, p<0.001], but not impulsivity, hopelessness, medication status, lifetime 
comorbid substance abuse/dependence, mood state, psychosis or rapid-cycling.
Group Differences Within Imaging Modalities
SMRI—Attempters demonstrated significantly lower gray matter volume than non-
attempters in right orbitofrontal cortex and hippocampus, and bilaterally in cerebellum 
extending into the vermis (Table 2, Figure 1). Results for all regions survived to p<0.001 and 
right orbitofrontal and hippocampus survived AlphaSim spatial extent thresholding (p<0.05, 
corrected). No areas showed significantly increased gray matter.
Results were unrelated to clinical factors explored.
DTI—Attempters demonstrated significantly lower fractional anisotropy than non-attempters 
in a left uncinate fasciculus region extending into left ventral frontal areas, a right uncinate 
region, and right cerebellum (Table 2, Figure 2). Results for all regions survived to p<0.001 
and for right uncinate and right cerebellum survived AlphaSim spatial extent thresholding 
(p<0.05, corrected). No areas showed significantly increased fractional anisotropy.
Results were unrelated to clinical factors, except fractional anisotropy in the right uncinate 
region was lower in bipolar disorder participants with, compared to without, rapid-cycling 
[t(65) = 2.07, p=0.042].
Functional Connectivity—Attempters demonstrated significantly lower functional 
connectivity than non-attempters from amygdala to a left ventral prefrontal region, including 
orbitofrontal, rostral prefrontal and ventral anterior cingulate regions in happy and neutral 
conditions (Table 2, Figure 3). A similar region showed lower connectivity in the fearful 
condition; however, it was below the AlphaSim spatial extent threshold. There was a region 
of significantly lower connectivity in right rostral prefrontal cortex in the neutral condition. 
Significance for all regions survived to p<0.001, and for all regions but the left ventral 
prefrontal region in the fear condition survived AlphaSim spatial extent thresholding 
(p<0.05, corrected). No areas showed significantly increased functional connectivity.
Results were unrelated to clinical factors explored.
Associations between Imaging Modalities and with Behaviors
Bilateral cerebellum gray matter volume was significantly correlated with right uncinate 
fasciculus fractional anisotropy among attempters only (r=0.53, p=0.008), and with right and 
left uncinate among all subjects (radj=0.32, p=0.009, radj=0.28, p=0.027). Among all 
subjects, right orbitofrontal and bilateral cerebellum gray matter volumes were significantly 
correlated with right cerebellum fractional anisotropy (radj=0.25, p=0.047, radj=0.29, 
p=0.022).
Among attempters, suicide ideation severity was negatively correlated with functional 
connectivity in the right rostral prefrontal cortex (rs=−0.490, p=0.033). This correlation was 
not significant in the overall sample adjusted for group. Attempt lethality was negatively

 correlated with left ventral prefrontal functional connectivity during happy, neutral, and fear 
conditions (rs=−0.47, p=0.031, rs=−0.49, p=0.025, rs=−0.58, p=0.006).
Healthy Group Comparisons
SMRI—Right hippocampal volume in the attempter group, but not the non-attempter group, 
was significantly lower than in the healthy comparison group (pDunnet<0.05).
DTI—Fractional anisotropy in the attempter group, but not the non-attempter group, was 
significantly lower than in the healthy comparison group in the bilateral uncinate fasciculus 
regions (pDunnet<0.05), with a trend (pDunnet=0.06) in the right cerebellum region.
Functional Connectivity—Secondary analyses indicated that functional connectivity in 
the attempter group, but not the non-attempter group, was significantly lower than in the 
healthy comparison group in the left ventral prefrontal cortex region for the three face 
conditions (pDunnet<0.05) with a trend (pDunnet=0.07) in the right rostral prefrontal cortex 
region in the neutral condition.
Discussion
This study demonstrated reductions in gray matter volume and integrity of structural and 
functional connections in a fronto-limbic system in attempters, compared to non-attempters. 
Decreases were observed in gray matter volumes in right orbitofrontal cortex and 
hippocampus, and in bilateral cerebellum regions. Diminished integrity of white matter in 
uncinate and ventral frontal and right cerebellum regions, and decreased functional 
connectivity between amygdala and left ventral prefrontal and right rostral prefrontal regions 
were also observed. Cerebellar gray matter volume was associated with uncinate and 
cerebellar fractional anisotropy, and orbitofrontal gray matter volume was associated with 
cerebellar fractional anisotropy. Among attempters, decreases in rostral and ventral 
prefrontal functional connectivity were associated with severity of suicide ideation and 
attempt lethality, respectively.
Gray matter volume reductions associated with suicide attempts in bipolar disorder were in 
orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum, regions implicated in emotional 
processing and regulation and in bipolar disorder (27). The orbitofrontal cortex plays a 
central role in regulating emotional responses, including through its connections to 
amygdala, hippocampus, and cerebellum (27). Volume decreases in the orbitofrontal cortex 
of attempters has been reported in adult attempters with major depressive disorder (28). The 
hippocampus may also influence emotional reactions and regulatory processes, given its role 
in encoding and recall of the emotional significance of events. Moreover, impaired memory 
processes have been associated with suicide attempts, implicating the hippocampus (29). 
Cerebellar connections with prefrontal cortex and amygdala suggest a role for cerebellum in 
emotion regulation, consistent with emotion dysregulation observed with cerebellum lesions 
(27). Hippocampus and cerebellum volume decreases have been observed in adult attempters 
(30, 31), but have been studied primarily in attempters with major depression, and some 
findings are inconsistent (28, 32). We did not detect differences in amygdala volume

 between the bipolar disorder attempters and non-attempters. Varying findings may be due to 
differences in imaging methodology and subject samples.
White matter findings were in regions of bilateral uncinate, extending into left ventral frontal 
regions, and in right cerebellum. The uncinate provides major ventral prefrontal cortex-
amygdala connections and is therefore implicated in emotional regulation. In bipolar 
disorder, white matter orbitofrontal decreases have been reported and were associated with 
impulsivity (11). The white matter decreases observed herein in attempters included more 
caudal frontal and temporal areas and were not associated with impulsivity. Right uncinate 
fractional anisotropy values were lower in association with rapid-cycling, a suggested risk 
factor for suicide in bipolar disorder (33), and suggests a link to mood dysregulation. 
Decreased white matter volumes have been observed in cerebellum in attempters with major 
depression (31). The cerebellum finding in attempters with bipolar disorder suggests it may 
be a structural abnormality associated with attempts across these mood disorders.
Exploratory analyses also provided preliminary evidence for associations between some of 
the gray and white matter findings. This raises the possibility of interactions between 
development of gray and white matter in suicide risk. This study’s data do not permit 
addressing this possibility. However, reciprocal relationships between neurons and glia 
during development may contribute to concomitant gray and white matter developmental 
changes (34–36). It is also possible that gray-white associations are the results of other 
biological processes, as opposed to a direct interaction between their developmental 
processes. For example, they may reflect responses to common genetic or environmental 
factors.
Amygdala-ventral prefrontal functional connectivity is critical in emotion regulation and 
showed decreases during processing of happy and neutral faces, and a trend for fearful faces, 
in attempters compared to non-attempters. Studies suggest emotion regulation deficits in 
adolescent suicide attempters and adolescents may attempt suicide in an effort to dampen 
intolerable emotional states (37). Moreover, adolescents with higher affect dysregulation are 
more likely to have multiple suicide attempts (38). Previous fMRI studies have shown 
increased responses to negative emotional faces, specifically angry faces, in frontal circuitry 
in adolescents (39) similar to adults (2). Depression and suicidal ideation have been 
associated with altered responses to neutral face stimuli in adults, particularly with 
projecting a negative bias (40). Together with reductions in amygdala-ventral prefrontal 
functional connectivity in the happy condition and at the trend level in the fearful condition, 
this suggests more widespread affective dysregulation may be present in suicide attempters 
with bipolar disorder, limiting modulation of emotional responses and impairing effective 
management of affect.
Decreased functional connectivity from the amygdala was also noted in right rostral 
prefrontal cortex in the neutral condition, suggested by exploratory analyses to be associated 
with suicide ideation severity. Less is known about the role of the rostral prefrontal cortex in 
suicidal behavior. The experience of mental pain in attempters during recall of suicidal 
episodes showed associations with decreased functioning of the rostral prefrontal cortex 
(41), a region implicated in self-referential and introspective mental functions (42) altered in

 suicidal ideation and during suicidal acts (43). Frontal dysfunction was observed in a study 
of adult ideators (9). In depressed youths, maladaptive emotion regulation response 
tendencies increased the likelihood of suicide ideation, planning and action, while adaptive 
regulatory responses decreased suicidal behavior (46). As the rostral prefrontal cortex is 
important in the development of regulation of emotions and adaptive responses tendencies 
(44), it is possible that emotional dysregulation, resulting from disruptions in prefrontal 
system functional connectivity, contributes to suicide ideation and risk for suicide behavior.
The magnitude of functional connectivity between amygdala and left ventral prefrontal 
cortex was negatively associated with attempt lethality. Individuals who make high-lethality 
attempts may be at most risk for suicide death (8). Our finding comports with adult 
neuroimaging studies demonstrating associations between attempt lethality and ventral 
prefrontal hypometabolism (8). High lethality has been associated with highly planned, less 
impulsive attempts (8). Together with the lack of associations between impulsivity and 
reductions in structural and functional integrity among attempters in this study, this suggests 
that altered ventral prefrontal functioning in attempt lethality may not, at least for some 
individuals, be related to its role in controlling impulses, but may relate to emotional 
dysregulation. However, impulsivity was assessed at scanning. It is possible associations 
with ventral prefrontal alterations may exist at the time of attempt.
For most regions in which attempters differed from non-attempters, attempters, but not non-
attempters, also differed significantly from healthy controls. Although this suggests findings 
may be related to suicidal tendencies, comparisons to individuals with other disorders are 
needed. It is also possible findings are a consequence of bipolar disorder or attempts. Future 
longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate the predictive value of these results. 
Orbitofrontal and cerebellum gray matter volume decreases in healthy controls compared to 
suicide attempters did not reach significance. This suggests gray matter volumes in these 
regions may better differentiate attempter status within bipolar disorder. Orbitofrontal 
volume decreases in attempters compared to non-attempters have been reported previously 
in bipolar disorder (45). Orbitofrontal decreases have also been reported between healthy 
comparison groups and attempter groups with major depressive disorder and borderline 
personality disorder (5). It is possible that aspects of our sample or methods decreased the 
ability to detect significant differences between attempters and healthy controls. Cerebellar 
findings are mixed (5) and additional studies are warranted.
Study limitations include the modest sample size. While no effects in the regions of group 
differences were detected for gender, medication, substance comorbidity, mood state or 
psychosis, the number of subjects in the subgroups for the factors assessed was small, 
limiting power. There were not sufficient numbers of subjects to perform meaningful 
analyses for subtypes of medications and non-substance psychiatric comorbidities. Age 
range was large and the sample included pubertal teens and young adults. While age was 
included as a covariate, developmental brain changes could still have affected results. 
Although suicide attempt and ideation history were assessed systematically, assessments 
were based on retrospective subject reporting, which could decrease accuracy. Results were 
reported with a primary threshold of p<0.005, with AlphaSim spatial extent thresholding 
(p<0.05, corrected), in order to balance effort to avoid premature strict correction that may

 limit report of findings that could prove useful in the future to the field, especially as there is 
rare similar data in the relatively young field of suicide research, with potential report of 
spurious results. However, caution should be taken in considering the results, as lower 
primary thresholds may lead to spurious findings when utilizing cluster extent based 
thresholds (46). We noted which results survived to a threshold of p<0.001, with and without 
AlphaSim spatial extent thresholding (p<0.05, corrected), to provide this further 
information. Correlational analyses should be considered preliminary. Exploratory 
correlational analyses were not controlled for multiple comparisons. Although some 
associations across imaging modalities and with behaviors were in directions anticipated, 
these did not reach significance, potentially owing to the sample size. Directionality of the 
DTI acquisition was limited. Additional analyses (e.g. analyses of group differences in 
activation and/or functional connectivity analyses using psychophysiological interaction 
analysis methods to further isolate stimulus-related connectivity) could aid further 
interpretation of the data. However, as in the previous published work of our group (20, 22), 
and other research groups, there can be complex interactions between mood state and stimuli 
emotion type. Thus the sample sizes in the current study limit ability to fully assess further 
interactions with suicide history and additional comprehensive analyses are beyond the 
scope of this manuscript.
In summary, this multimodal structural and functional neuroimaging study of adolescent/
young adult suicide attempters with bipolar disorder demonstrates decreases in gray matter 
and white matter structural and functional connectivity in a ventral fronto-limbic neural 
system that subserves emotion regulation. It provides preliminary evidence for gray-white 
matter relationships and associations between system features with suicide ideation and 
attempt lethality. Integrated study of brain structure and function, and their associations with 
symptoms and behavior, in suicide research is important to elucidating risk mechanisms that 
may involve complex, parallel and interacting relationships between developing circuitry 
and symptoms/behaviors. Longitudinal studies are needed to more fully investigate 
development of system features, their role in transition from suicidal ideation to behavior 
and risk for completed suicide, and further elucidate the role of emotional regulation in 
suicide behavior in bipolar disorder and whether it generalizes to other disorders.

 Figure 1. Decreased Gray Matter Volume in Individuals With Bipolar Disorder With, Compared 
to Without, Suicide Attemptsa
a The structural magnetic resonance T1 axial-oblique and sagittal images display right 
orbitofrontal cortex, right hippocampal and cerebellum regions where gray matter volume 
was decreased in the group with bipolar disorder with suicide attempts, compared to the 
group without suicide attempts (p<0.005, meeting AlphaSim spatial extent threshold for 
p<0.05, corrected). The numbers are the Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates (mm) 
for the corresponding plane. The color bar represents the range of T-values. The right side of 
the axial-oblique images is on the right side of the brain.

 Figure 2. Decreased Fractional Anisotropy in Individuals With Bipolar Disorder With, 
Compared to Without, Suicide Attemptsa
a Axial-oblique images display areas of decreased fractional anisotropy, in regions of the 
bilateral uncinate fasciculus, extending on the left into left ventral frontal cortex, and 
cerebellum in the group with bipolar disorder with suicide attempts, compared to the group 
without suicide attempts (p<0.005, meeting AlphaSim spatial extent threshold for p<0.05, 
corrected). The numbers are the Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates (mm) for the z-
plane. The left uncinate was negatively associated with suicide ideation severity (p<0.05). 
The color bar represents the range of T-values. The right side of the axial-oblique images is 
on the right side of the brain.

 Figure 3. Decreased Functional Connectivity in Individuals With Bipolar Disorder With, 
Compared to Without, Suicide Attemptsa
a Axial-oblique images display the regions of decreased functional connectivity from the 
amygdala, in the group with bipolar disorder with suicide attempts, compared to the group 
without suicide attempts, to left ventral prefrontal cortex during happy (top row, p<0.0016, 
meeting AlphaSim spatial extent threshold for p<0.05, corrected), neutral (middle row, 
p<0.0016, meeting AlphaSim spatial extent threshold for p<0.05, corrected), and fearful face 
(bottom row, p<0.0016, uncorrected) conditions and to right rostral prefrontal cortex in the 
neutral face (second row, right two images, p<0.0016, meeting AlphaSim spatial extent 
threshold for p<0.05, corrected) condition. The numbers are the Montreal Neurological 
Institute coordinates (mm) for the z-plane. Functional connectivity in all areas was 
negatively associated with suicide ideation severity (p<0.05). Only the region of reduced 
amygdala-ventral prefrontal connectivity was negatively associated with lethality of most 
severe attempt in all three face conditions (p<0.05). The color bar represents the range of T-
values. The right side of the axial-oblique images is on the right side of the brain.
