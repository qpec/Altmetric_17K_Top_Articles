Abstract
Background: Asthma is the most common chronic lung disease of childhood, affecting approximately 6 million children 
in the United States. Although asthma cannot be cured, most of the time, asthma symptoms can be controlled by avoiding 
or reducing exposure to asthma triggers (allergens and irritants) and by following recommendations for asthma education 
and appropriate medical care.
Methods: CDC analyzed asthma data from the 2001–2016 National Health Interview Survey for children aged 0–17 years 
to examine trends and demographic differences in health outcomes and health care use.
Results: Asthma was more prevalent among boys (9.2%) than among girls (7.4%), children aged ≥5 years 
(approximately 10%) than children aged <5 years (3.8%), non-Hispanic black (black) children (15.7%) and children 
of Puerto Rican descent (12.9%) than among non-Hispanic white (white) children (7.1%), and children living in low 
income families (10.5%) than among those living in families with income ≥250% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) 
(approximately 7%). Asthma prevalence among children increased from 8.7% in 2001 to 9.4% in 2010, and then 
decreased to 8.3% in 2016. Although not all changes were statistically significant, a similar pattern was observed among 
subdemographic groups studied, with the exception of Mexican/Mexican-American children, among whom asthma 
prevalence increased from 5.1% in 2001 to 6.5% in 2016.
Among children with asthma, the percentage who had an asthma attack in the past 12 months declined significantly 
from 2001 to 2016. Whereas asthma prevalence was lower among children aged 0–4 years than among older children, 
the prevalence of asthma attacks (62.4%), emergency department or urgent care center (ED/UC) visits (31.1%), and 
hospitalization (10.4%) were higher among children with asthma aged 0–4 years than among those aged 12–17 years 
(44.8%, 9.6%, and 2.8%, respectively).
During 2013, children with asthma aged 5–17 years missed 13.8 million days of school per year (2.6 days per child). 
Compared with 2003, in 2013, the prevalence of adverse health outcomes and health care use were significantly lower 
and the prevalence of having an action plan to manage asthma was higher.
Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: Asthma remains an important public health and medical 
problem. The health of children with asthma can be improved by promoting asthma control strategies, including asthma 
trigger reduction, appropriate guidelines-based medical management, and asthma education for children, parents, and 
others involved in asthma care.
Introduction
Asthma is a common chronic lung disease of children that causes 
repeated episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, 
and nighttime or early morning coughing (1). These symptoms 
can often be controlled by avoiding or reducing asthma triggers 
(allergens and irritants) and by following recommendations for 
appropriate medical care (initiating asthma control medications 
or adjusting the current treatment regimen when needed) (1,2).
A 2012 CDC National Surveillance of Asthma report 
showed an increasing trend in asthma prevalence among 
children between 2001 and 2010, with children experiencing 
more asthma attacks and emergency visits than did adults (3). 
Asthma is more common among some children than others. 
Boys, children aged ≥5 years, black children and children of 
Puerto Rican descent, and children living in households with 
income of <100% of FPL had higher prevalence than did girls, 
children aged <5 years, white children, and children living in 
households with income >250% FPL (3,4). Asthma-related 
hospitalizations were 3.6 times higher and emergency depart-
ment visits were 3 times higher among black children than 
among white children (4).

Uncontrolled asthma results in significant costs to families 
and society when asthma exacerbations result in medical 
encounters, lost school days, and reduced productivity. The 
cost of asthma for children varies by state. In 2012, the median 
annual medical cost of asthma was $983 per child (ranging 
from $833 in Arizona to $1,121 in Michigan) for all payers (5).
Because of changing physical, social, and economic environ-
ments and medical management of asthma at individual and 
population levels over time (6,7), there is a need to update 
prevalence estimates and to reassess demographic differences 
in health outcomes and health care use to better define the 
current burden of asthma overall and among subpopulations. 
This report reviews the current state of asthma among U.S. 
children aged 0–17 years and related health outcomes, health 
care use, and asthma care and management.
Methods
To describe asthma status and to assess trends and demo-
graphic differences in self-reported health outcomes, health 
care use, and asthma care and management among children 
aged 0–17 years, CDC analyzed annual core* data (2001–
2016) and periodic asthma supplemental† data (2003, 2008, 
and 2013) from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).
The NHIS, conducted by CDC’s National Center for Health 
Statistics (NCHS), is a cross-sectional household interview 
survey of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population in 
50 states and the District of Columbia. NHIS uses a multi-
stage, clustered sample design, and applies sampling weights 
to account for household nonresponse and oversampling of 
blacks, Hispanics, and Asians to produce national estimates for 
a variety of health indicators (the sampling design was changed 
in 2016, and oversampling of these groups was not conducted 
during that year). NHIS collects additional data on asthma 
(e.g., routine care visits, hospitalization, missed school days, 
self-management education, and asthma medication use [rescue 
and control medications]) every 5 years (i.e., 2003, 2008, and 
2013; https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/about_nhis.htm).
In 2016, persons aged 0–17 years accounted for 11,107 of 
NHIS respondents, including 960 (8.3%) who had current 
asthma. Children were considered to have current asthma if 
proxy adults answered “yes” to the following two questions: 
“Has a doctor or other health professional ever told you that 
[child] had asthma?” and “Does [child] still have asthma?” 
(3,4). Trends in prevalence of current asthma (asthma) and 
asthma attack were assessed. Among children with asthma, 
* Core data include sociodemographic characteristics and information on health 
conditions, health care access and utilization, health behaviors and risk factors.
† Supplemental modules collect data on new topics or more detailed information 
on core topics; can change from year to year; and are designed to meet 
department goals and objectives.
demographic (age, sex, race/ethnicity, income status, and 
U.S. Bureau of the Census geographic region) differences in 
self-reported school absenteeism, asthma attack, and health care 
use because of asthma (routine care visit, ED/UC visit, and hos-
pitalization) in the past 12 months were assessed. Prevalences of 
asthma attack and ED/UC visit were defined as the percentage 
of children with current asthma who experienced an asthma 
attack and had an ED/UC visit because of an asthma attack 
in the past 12 months, respectively. School absenteeism was 
defined as one or more missed school days by a child aged 
5–17 years in the past 12 months. NHIS 2003, 2008, and 
2013 data were also analyzed to assess changes in health care 
use (asthma-related routine care visit and hospitalization in 
the past 12 months) and asthma care status (ever received any 
of the 6-component asthma self-management education,§ and 
asthma medication use [rescue medication and asthma control 
medication] in the past 3 months). Additional information is 
available at https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/index.htm.
Statistical software was used for analysis to account for the 
complex sampling design. Trends in prevalence of current 
asthma and asthma attack during 2001–2016 were assessed 
using Joinpoint software from the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) (8), which characterizes trends as joined linear segments. 
All stated comparisons between demographic groups were 
evaluated by using two-sided significance tests with statistical 
significance defined as p<0.05. Relative standard error (RSE), 
defined as standard error divided by prevalence estimate, was 
used as a measure of an estimate’s reliability (an RSE <0.30 
indicates a reliable estimate) (3).
Results
During 2016, asthma affected boys (9.2%) more than girls 
(7.4%), children aged 5–11 years (9.6%) and 12–17 years 
(10.5%) more than children aged 0–4 years (3.8%), black 
children (15.7%) and children of Puerto Rican descent 
(12.9%) more than white children (7.1%), and children liv-
ing in families with income of less than 100% FPL (10.5%) 
more than those living in families with income of ≥250% FPL 
(250% to <450% FPL: 6.9%; ≥450% FPL: 6.7%). However, 
current asthma prevalence did not differ significantly by U.S. 
Census region (Table 1) or metropolitan statistical area (MSA).
Asthma prevalence among children aged 0–17 years increased 
from 8.7% in 2001 to 9.4% in 2010, and then decreased to 
8.3% in 2016. Although not all changes were statistically 
§ The 6-component asthma self-management education includes 1) having been 
given an action plan, 2) having taken a class to learn how to manage asthma, 
3) having been taught to recognize early signs and symptoms of an asthma 
attack, 4) having been taught how to respond to an asthma attack, 5) having 
been taught to use a peak flow meter, and 6) having received advice on 
environmental control.

significant, a similar pattern was observed among all sex, age, 
and racial/ethnic groups studied, except for Mexican/Mexican-
American children, among whom asthma prevalence increased 
from 5.1% in 2001 to 6.5% in 2016.
In 2013 and 2016, nearly 54% of children with asthma were 
reported to have had ≥1 asthma attack, 71.1% had routine care 
visits, 4.7% were hospitalized, 16.7% had an ED/UC visit 
because of an asthma attack, and 49.0% of school-age children 
with asthma missed one or more school days (Table 2). Having 
an asthma attack, missing school days, and having health care 
visits because of asthma (routine care visits and hospitaliza-
tions) did not differ by sex, race/ethnicity, and U.S. census 
region. However, the prevalence of asthma attacks, hospital-
izations, and ED/UC visits were higher among children aged 
0–4 years than among those aged 12–17 years and ED/UC 
visits were higher among black children (22.5%) than among 
white children (12.2%) (Table 2).
During 2001–2016, the percentage of children with asthma 
who experienced an asthma attack decreased significantly, 
from 61.7% in 2001 to 53.7% in 2016 (Figure). A significant 
decline in asthma attacks was experienced across all sex, age, 
and racial/ethnic groups.
Assessment of asthma self-management education found that 
50.8% of children with asthma received an asthma action plan, 
11.0% were taking a class to learn how to manage their asthma, 
76.0% were taught how to recognize early signs of an asthma 
attack, 80.0% were taught how to respond to an asthma attack, 
50.6% were taught how to use a peak flow meter (a portable, 
handheld device that is used to measure how well air moves 
out of the lungs), and 46.4% received advice on environmen-
tal control in 2013. Compared with 2003, the percentages of 
children with asthma who were hospitalized because of asthma 
and, among school-aged children with asthma, the percent-
age with missed school days were significantly lower in 2013, 
while the percentage having an action plan to manage asthma 
was higher (Table 3). Similar to estimates in 2003, in 2013, 
94.4% of children with asthma had health insurance coverage, 
and 6.4% could not afford prescription medicine during the

Key Points
• One in 12 children aged 0–17 years had asthma in 2016.
• Asthma was more prevalent among boys, non-Hispanic 
black children, children of Puerto Rican descent, and 
children from low-income households.
• The percentage of children with asthma who had an 
asthma attack during the preceding year declined from 
2001 to 2016. Even so, approximately half of children 
with diagnosed asthma had one or more asthma attack 
in 2016.
• Children with asthma had fewer missed school days 
and hospitalizations in 2013 compared with 2003.
• Approximately 55% children with asthma were taking 
asthma control prescription medicines during the 
preceding 3 months. Among children who were taking 
asthma control medicines, only 54.5% of them were 
taking control medicines regularly as prescribed, which 
was significantly lower than during 2003.
• The health of children with asthma can be further 
improved by promoting asthma control strategies, 
including asthma trigger reduction, appropriate 
guidelines-based medical management, and asthma 
education for children, parents, and others involved in 
asthma care.

gov/vitalsigns/.
past 12 months. In 2013, nearly 68% of children with asthma 
were taking asthma rescue medications and 55.2% had taken 
asthma control medicine in the past 3 months. In addition, 
approximately 9% of children with asthma overused rescue 
medications (i.e., used more than three disks or canisters of 
quick relief inhaler medication in the past 3 months) and 
30.1% were taking asthma control medications every day or 
almost every day as recommended, with 25.1% reporting tak-
ing them less often (Table 3). Having received self-management 
education and use of asthma control prescription medication 
did not differ by race/ethnicity. However, among children 
with asthma who were taking asthma control medicine dur-
ing the preceding 3 months, the percentage of children using 
asthma control prescription medicine regularly as prescribed 
declined significantly from 65.7% in 2003 to 54.5% in 2013 
(p<0.01) (Table 3).
Conclusions and Comments
Although asthma still affects some children more than oth-
ers, the findings in this report are somewhat encouraging. The 
prevalence of asthma and asthma attacks have decreased in 
recent years (since 2010 and 2001, respectively), fewer children 
with asthma reported missed school days and hospitalizations 
because of asthma, and more children with asthma received a 
written asthma action plan during 2013 than did during 2003. 
Among children with asthma, asthma attacks, hospitalizations, 
and ED/UC visits were more prevalent among children aged 
0–4 years than among children aged 12–17 years. This might 
be partially explained by more frequent viral respiratory infec-
tions among this age group. These infections are the most 
common precipitants of asthma symptoms and hospitalizations 
among this age group (9).
The findings in this report indicate that more children with 
asthma received an asthma action plan, were taught how to rec-
ognize early signs of an asthma attack, and were taught how to 
respond to an asthma attack in 2013 than in 2003. However, in 
2013 only half (51%) of children with asthma received an asthma 
action plan and less than half (46%) received advice on environ-
mental control, indicating a need for further improvement in 
these areas, given that multicomponent self-management educa-
tion programs, including an written asthma action plan (1,10,11); 
educating healthcare providers (12) can improve asthma-related 
health outcomes and reduce unnecessary health care use.
Access to and adherence to guidelines-based medical care, 
including prescribing inhaled corticosteroids, is a key com-
ponent of effective asthma care (1,13,14). The findings show 
that just over half (54.5%) of children with asthma who were 
taking asthma control medications were taking them regularly 
as prescribed, indicating a need for further improvement in 
medication adherence.

The findings in this report are subject to at least two limita-
tions. First, because NHIS is a cross-sectional survey, it provides 
prevalence estimates and associations, but cannot determine 
causal associations. Second, NHIS data are based on adult 
proxy responses for children; therefore, the findings might be 
biased because of inaccurate recall or the social desirability of 
providing positive responses.
Asthma remains an important public health and medical 
problem. Some progress has been made in providing asthma 
education and in decreasing adverse health outcomes. The health 
of children with asthma can be further improved by promoting 
asthma control strategies, including asthma trigger reduction, 
appropriate guidelines-based medical management, and asthma 
education for children, parents, and others involved in asthma 
care. The CDC National Asthma Control Program (https://
www.cdc.gov/asthma/nacp.htm) works with 25 funded state and 
territorial grantees and four nongovernmental organizations to 
engage persons with asthma, their families, schools, communities, 
and health care providers to achieve better care and better health 
outcomes and to decrease unnecessary asthma-related emergency 
department and urgent care visits and hospitalizations.
