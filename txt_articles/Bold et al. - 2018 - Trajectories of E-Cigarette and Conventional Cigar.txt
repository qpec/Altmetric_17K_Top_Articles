BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is common among youth, and there are 
concerns that e-cigarette use leads to future conventional cigarette use. We examined 
longitudinal associations between past-month cigarette and e-cigarette use to characterize 
the stability and directionality of these tobacco use trajectories over time.
METHODS: High school students (N = 808, 53% female) completed surveys across 3 waves 
(2013, 2014, and 2015) in 3 public schools in Connecticut. Using autoregressive cross-
lagged models, we examined bidirectional relationships between past-month cigarette and 
e-cigarette use over time. Models were adjusted for covariates related to tobacco use  
(ie, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and use of other tobacco products).
RESULTS: Past-month e-cigarette use predicted future cigarette use (wave 1–2: odds ratio 
[OR] = 7.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.34–21.42; wave 2–3: OR = 3.87, 95% CI = 
1.86–8.06). However, past-month cigarette use did not predict future e-cigarette use (wave 
1–2: OR = 2.02, 95% CI = 0.67–6.08; wave 2–3: OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 0.77–4.71). Additionally, 
frequency of cigarette and e-cigarette use increased over time. By wave 3, 26% of cigarette 
users and 20.5% of e-cigarette users reported using 21–30 days out of the past month.
CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarette use was associated with future cigarette use across 3 longitudinal 
waves, yet cigarette use was not associated with future e-cigarette use. Future research 
needs to examine mechanisms through which e-cigarette use leads to cigarette use. 
E-cigarette regulation and prevention programs may help prevent future use of cigarettes 
among youth.

 Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) 
are battery-operated devices used 
to vaporize liquid solutions that may 
contain nicotine, flavors, and other 
chemicals. E-cigarettes are now 
the most commonly used tobacco 
product among youth; an estimated 
3 million US adolescents currently 
use e-cigarettes, 
1 including many 
who have never used conventional 
cigarettes.2, 
 
3 There are concerns 
that e-cigarette use among youth 
may lead to conventional cigarette 
smoking, which is a leading cause of 
morbidity and mortality in the United 
States.4
Longitudinal cohort studies provide 
some of the strongest scientific 
evidence to assess the prospective 
relationship between e-cigarette use 
and future cigarette use. To date, 
results from several longitudinal 
studies indicate that e-cigarette 
use among nonsmoking youth 
increases the likelihood of future 
use of conventional cigarettes.5 
– 
10 
Specifically, the pooled odds ratio 
(OR) in a recent meta-analysis of 
studies of adolescents and young 
adults (aged 14–30) indicates 
that those who had ever used 
e-cigarettes were 3.62 times more 
likely to report using cigarettes at 
follow-up compared with those who 
had not used e-cigarettes.11 This 
finding was robust and remained 
significant when adjusting for 
known risk factors associated 
with cigarette smoking, including 
demographic, psychosocial, and 
behavioral variables such as cigarette 
susceptibility.
Thus, there is growing evidence to 
support the concern that e-cigarette 
use is associated with future cigarette 
use. However, previous studies 
have focused on the unidirectional 
relationship between 2 time points, 
examining the association between 
baseline e-cigarette use and future 
cigarette use but not the stability 
of these relationships over time or 
the potential reverse directionality. 
E-cigarette and cigarette use may be 
highly correlated over time such that 
the use of either product is associated 
with the use of the other, in which 
case cigarette use would also confer 
risk for future e-cigarette use.
To better understand the stability 
and directionality of these 
associations over time, we used a 
cross-lagged model to examine the 
direct and reciprocal relationships 
between e-cigarette and cigarette 
use across 3 waves (2013, 2014, 
and 2015) using longitudinal survey 
evidence from high school students 
in Connecticut. With this analytic 
approach, we can simultaneously 
model cross-lagged effects (ie, 
relationships between e-cigarette use 
at 1 wave predicting cigarette use at 
a future wave and vice versa) while 
controlling for previous levels of the 
variables across waves (ie, direct 
effects of earlier use on future use of 
the same product), 
12 thereby ruling 
out the possibility that a cross-lagged 
effect is merely representing a strong 
correlation between the likelihood 
of e-cigarette and cigarette use at 
a given point in time. If the cross-
lagged relationship is unidirectional 
over multiple waves such that 
e-cigarette use predicts future 
cigarette use but not vice versa, this 
would further support the notion 
that e-cigarette use is a risk factor 
for future conventional cigarette 
smoking.
MethODs
Longitudinal data were collected in 
school-wide surveys across 3 time 
points (wave 1: fall 2013; wave 2: 
spring 2014; and wave 3: spring 
2015). Surveys were repeated 
across 3 Connecticut high schools 
that were selected across different 
district reference groups (ie, school 
groupings that vary on the basis 
of characteristics such as family 
income levels, parental education and 
occupation levels, and the use of a 
non-English language in the home)13 
to include diverse demographic 
and socioeconomic characteristics. 
Individual paper-and-pencil 
surveys were distributed during 
homeroom periods at each wave of 
the survey administration. Parents 
were contacted in advance of the 
study and could indicate if they did 
not want their child to participate. 
Students were informed that their 
participation was voluntary and 
that data were anonymous. Study 
procedures were approved by the 
Yale University Institutional Review 
Board and school administrators.
It has been suggested that more 
accurate reports of youth substance 
use are obtained from anonymous 
surveys, so all surveys were 
anonymous to encourage honest 
responding.14, 
 
15 Unique 5-factor 
identification codes (eg, day value 
from date of birth, school, sex) were 
used to match student responses 
longitudinally by following 
previously validated procedures.16, 
 
17  
Out of 1408 students, n = 1098 
were matched from wave 1 to 2, 
and n = 972 were matched from 
wave 2 to 3. These match rates 
are comparable to those observed 
in other regional and national 
longitudinal surveys that used 
procedures for either anonymous16 
or identifiable survey matching.5, 
 
6 
Those who were matched across all 3 
waves (n = 808) did not significantly 
differ from those who were not 
matched longitudinally in terms of 
sociodemographic characteristics (eg, 
sex, race) or substance use (eg, ever 
or past-month use of cigarettes or 
e-cigarettes), and comparable match 
rates were observed across schools 
and grades, reducing potential 
concerns about attrition bias.

 Demographics
Students reported demographic 
characteristics including sex (male 
or female), age, and race/ethnicity 
(white, black or African American, 
Hispanic and/or Latino, Asian, 
American Indian or Alaskan Native, 
Native Hawaiian or other Pacific 
Islander, Middle Eastern, or other). 
Socioeconomic status (SES) was 
assessed by using the Family Affluence 
Scale, which has been shown to be 
a reliable and valid measure of SES 
among adolescents.18 The 4-item 
Family Affluence Scale assessed the 
following: (1) whether an adolescent’s 
family owns a car, van, or truck (no = 
0, yes = 1); (2) whether an adolescent 
has his or her own bedroom (no = 0, 
yes = 1); (3) the number of laptops 
and/or computers an adolescent’s 
family owns (none = 0, 1 = 1, 2 = 2, >2 = 
 
3); and (4) whether an adolescent’s 
family had vacationed in the past 12 
months (not at all = 0, once = 1, twice = 
 
2, more than twice = 3). Responses 
were added to create a total SES score.
Ever Use of Other Tobacco Products
Ever use of other tobacco products 
(ie, cigars, hookah, blunts, smokeless 
tobacco) was assessed by asking 
students if they had ever tried each 
product (yes or no) at wave 1.
Longitudinal Outcome Measures
E-Cigarette Use
E-cigarette use was measured at 
each wave by asking, “Have you ever 
tried an e-cigarette?” (yes or no) 
and, “How many days out of the past 
30 days did you use e-cigarettes?” 
(open-ended response, 0–30).
Cigarette Use
Cigarette use was measured at each 
wave by asking, “Have you ever tried 
a cigarette, even just 1 or 2 puffs?” 
(yes or no) and, “During the past 
30 days, on how many days did you 
smoke a cigarette (even just 1 or 2 
puffs)?” Categorical response options 
included the following: “none, 
” “1 
day, 
” “2 days, 
” “3 to 5 days, 
” “6 to 
10 days, 
” “11 to 20 days, 
” “21 to 28 
days, 
” and “everyday.”
Primary Outcomes
To capture recent use, which may 
be less prone to recall bias, the 
primary outcomes of interest were 
past-month use (1 = yes, 0 = no) of 
cigarettes and e-cigarettes at each 
wave. If data on past-month use were 
missing and youth reported never 
trying the product in their lifetime, 
past-month use was imputed as  
0 = no use (n = 10 records, 0.4%  
of cases).
Data analysis
Analyses were run by using Mplus 
(version 7.4). Outcome data were 
missing for 6.5% of cases across 
waves and were handled by using 
maximum likelihood estimation 
with robust standard errors. Past-
month cigarette and e-cigarette use 
outcomes were modeled as binary 
variables with a logit link function. 
School was included as a covariate 
across all waves to account for 
potential school cohort effects. Path 
models were used to simultaneously 
estimate the following: (1) the 
autoregressive direct effects within 
cigarette and e-cigarette use across 
waves (ie, the association between 
e-cigarette and cigarette use at each 
wave and use of the same product at 
the next wave) and (2) the reciprocal 
predictive pathways between 
e-cigarette and cigarette use at each 
wave to use of the other product at 
the next wave (eg, e-cigarette use at 
wave 1 predicting cigarette use at 
wave 2 and vice versa) (see Fig 1).
Baseline variables such as 
sociodemographic characteristics 
and use of other tobacco products 
(ie, cigars, hookah, blunts, smokeless 
tobacco) were selected a priori as 
covariates on the basis of previous 
literature.19, 
 
20 Results were 
consistent across the models in which 
the direct and reciprocal effects were 
estimated without including any 
covariates (n = 808) and the model 
in which the effects were estimated 
including all baseline covariates 
(ie, sex, race/ethnicity, SES, use of 
other tobacco products; n = 795). 
Therefore, results are presented 
from adjusted models including all 
covariates.
Lastly, frequencies of e-cigarette 
and cigarette product use were 
examined at each wave (Table 2). The

frequencies over time.
ResuLts
Results from the path models (Fig 1) 
indicated significant autoregressive 
direct effects (ie, stability in use over 
time). As expected, past-month use 
of e-cigarettes and cigarettes at wave 
1 predicted greater odds of past-
month use of that same product at 
wave 2 (cigarette: OR = 17.74, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 5.56–56.56; 
e-cigarette: OR = 9.95, 95% CI = 4.92–
20.13). Similarly, past-month use of 
e-cigarettes and cigarettes at wave 2 
predicted greater odds of past-month 
use of that same product at wave 3 
(cigarette: OR = 8.30, 95% CI = 3.43–
20.10; e-cigarette: OR = 7.00, 95%  
CI = 3.96–12.40).
Additionally, our results indicated 
that there were significant reciprocal 
pathways between past-month 
e-cigarette use at each wave and 
future cigarette use. Specifically, 
individuals using e-cigarettes in 
the past month at wave 1 were 
>7 times more likely to report 
subsequent cigarette use at wave 2 
(OR = 7.08, 95% CI = 2.34–21.42) 
when compared with those not using 
e-cigarettes. Furthermore, those 
using e-cigarettes in the past month 
at wave 2 were close to 4 times 
more likely to report subsequent 
cigarette use at wave 3 (OR = 3.87, 
95% CI = 1.86–8.06) when compared 
with those not using e-cigarettes. 
Conversely, past-month cigarette use 
at each wave was not significantly 
predictive of future e-cigarette use 
(wave 1–2: OR = 2.02, 95% CI = 0.67–
6.08; wave 2–3: OR = 1.90, 95% CI =  
0.77–4.71). Thus, the effects were  
unidirectional such that youth  
using e-cigarettes were at greater 
risk for future cigarette use 
compared with those not using 
e-cigarettes, whereas the reverse 
relationship (cigarette use  
predicting future e-cigarette use)  
was not observed.
To further characterize cigarette  
and e-cigarette use, rates of product 
use were examined over time  
(Table 2). Overall, the rates of past- 
month use of both cigarettes and  
e-cigarettes significantly increased  
in the longitudinal sample over  
time (cigarettes: χ2 [N = 2424],  
P = .001; e-cigarettes: χ2 [N = 2424],  
P = .001), almost doubling from  
wave 1 (2013) to wave 3 (2015).  
Frequency of use (measured as the 
number of days of use in the past  
month) also increased significantly 
over time for both cigarettes (χ2  
[N = 2424], P = .003) and e-cigarettes 
(χ2 [N = 2424], P = .001). By wave 
3, a greater proportion of youth 
reported using cigarettes on most 
days in the past month (ie, 21–30 
days) when compared with waves 1 
or 2. Additionally, significantly higher 
rates of low (1–5 days), moderate 
(11–20 days), and heavy (21–30 
days) e-cigarette use were observed 
in wave 3 compared with earlier 
waves. By 2015, 26% of past-month

 cigarette users and 20.5% of past-

DIscussIOn
This study is the first to examine 
reciprocal relationships between 
past-month e-cigarette and cigarette 
use among high school youth using 
3 waves of matched longitudinal 
data. We found that e-cigarette use 
is prospectively associated with a 
greater risk of future conventional 
cigarette use, while controlling for 
the autoregressive effects of stability 
of use over time. Importantly, 
we also observed that this risk is 
unidirectional, such that cigarette 
use was not significantly associated 
with e-cigarette use over time. 
The observed relationships were 
consistent across unadjusted models 
and when including covariates 
known to relate to cigarette and 
e-cigarette use (eg, sociodemographic 
characteristics, other tobacco 
use). Furthermore, rates of past-
month cigarette and e-cigarette use 
increased significantly across our 3 
waves of assessment, indicating more 
youth were using these products 
over time, which is consistent with 
epidemiologic evidence of higher 
rates of tobacco use as youth age.1, 
 
21  
The rising frequency of recent 
e-cigarette use among youth over 
time is concerning, especially in light 
of evidence that e-cigarette use is 
a significant risk factor for future 
conventional cigarette use.
In future studies, researchers 
should examine potential mediators 
to better understand possible 
mechanisms that account for the 
observed directionality of the 
association between e-cigarette  
use and future cigarette use. For  
example, adolescents may be more 
likely to use e-cigarettes before  
conventional cigarettes because  
of factors unique to e-cigarette 
products, such as perceptions that  
e-cigarettes are less harmful than 
conventional cigarettes, 
2, 
 
22 the  
widespread availability of unique 
e-cigarette liquid flavors that may be 
especially appealing to youth, 
23, 
 
24 and 
 
limited enforcement or restrictions 
on youth access to e-cigarettes (eg,  
through online sales).25, 
 
26 At the same  
time, there is evidence that the adoles-
cent brain is highly sensitive to the 
rewarding effects of nicotine, 
27, 
 
28  
so e-cigarette use may provide 
early exposure to the reinforcing 
pharmacological effects of nicotine, 
which may increase the likelihood 
of transitioning to conventional 
cigarettes. Furthermore, nicotine may  
be delivered more efficiently through  
cigarettes than e-cigarettes depending 
on the e-cigarette device, 
29, 
30 
so youth who use conventional 
cigarettes may find e-cigarettes 
less reinforcing and be less likely to 
transition in the reverse direction: 
from cigarette to e-cigarette use over 
time. Given the observational nature 
of the current survey study, we 
are unable to ascertain the specific 
causal mechanisms accounting for 
the association between e-cigarette 
use and future cigarette use. Yet 
our findings suggest that early 
prevention and intervention efforts 
as well as policies targeting youth 
e-cigarette use may be needed to 
reduce future conventional cigarette 
use among youth. Prevention 
efforts may include new e-cigarette 
regulatory policies given that the 
deeming rule now extends the 
regulatory authority of the Food and 
Drug Administration to other tobacco 
products, including e-cigarettes.31 
As e-cigarette regulatory policies are 
enforced and product regulations 
change, continued research will be 
needed to understand how these 
strategies influence youth e-cigarette 
and cigarette use behaviors.
The current study has several 
important strengths, including the 
use of matched longitudinal data 
from the same high school students 
across 3 time points (2013, 2014, 
and 2015) and a cross-lagged model 
with which we assessed the stability 
and directionality of associations 
between e-cigarettes and cigarettes 
over time. Furthermore, we used 
anonymous survey procedures that 
are known to improve the validity 
of substance use reporting among 
youth. With the current results, 
we extend previous longitudinal 
research that is focused on ever use 
of cigarettes and e-cigarettes, which 
may primarily capture youth who 
experiment with the product a single 
time, by examining past-month rates 
and frequencies to better quantify 
recent product use over time.
Several limitations should also  
be noted. For example, the  
sample comprised high school 
students from Connecticut,  
with the majority identifying  
as white, so our results may  
not generalize to other  
geographic or more diverse 
sociodemographic areas. 
Additionally, there may be  
other product characteristics  
(eg, nicotine strength) or  
covariates (eg, advertisement 
exposure, parental tobacco  
use) not assessed in this study 
that may relate to cigarette and 
e-cigarette use over time that 
should be considered in future 
investigations. Although we 
controlled for use of other  
tobacco products at baseline  
in the current study, it will be 
important for researchers  
to also consider how use  
patterns change across multiple 
tobacco products longitudinally.  
In our study, we intended to  
focus on adolescents during 
high school given the unique 
vulnerability to tobacco product  
use during this developmental 
period, and further research  
is needed to characterize 
trajectories between e-cigarette

 and cigarette use among people 
of other ages, including persistence 
of use into adulthood. Lastly, we 
focused on binary outcomes of past-
month use of the products given the 
small sample sizes across the full 
range of use frequency. However, 
our preliminary analyses indicated 
higher rates of e-cigarette and 
cigarette use over time, consistent 
with national samples. Future large-
scale longitudinal studies are needed 
to address the question of how 
frequency of use of 1 product relates 
to future use of another product.
cOncLusIOns
This study is the first to examine 
reciprocal associations between 
cigarette and e-cigarette use among 
youth across 3 longitudinal waves. 
The observed relationship between 
cigarette and e-cigarette use over time 
was unidirectional. E-cigarette use 
was associated with future cigarette 
use across 3 longitudinal waves, yet 
cigarette use was not associated 
with future e-cigarette use. Potential 
mediators of this effect should be 
examined in future research to 
better understand the mechanisms 
through which e-cigarette use 
increases the risk for future cigarette 
use. Prevention and intervention 
efforts and policies targeting youth 
e-cigarette use may be needed to 
reduce future conventional tobacco 
use among youth.
