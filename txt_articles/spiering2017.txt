Summary
Background Carotid baroreflex activation lowers blood pressure and might have potential application for the treatment 
of resistant hypertension. We did a proof-of-principle trial with a novel endovascular baroreceptor amplification 
device, MobiusHD (Vascular Dynamics, Mountain View, CA, USA), in patients with resistant hypertension.
Methods CALM-FIM_EUR was a prospective, first-in-human, open-label study done at six European centres. Eligible 
patients were adults with resistant hypertension (office systolic blood pressure ≥160 mm Hg despite taking at least 
three antihypertensive agents, including a diuretic). MobiusHD devices were implanted unilaterally in the internal 
carotid artery. The primary endpoint was the incidence of serious adverse events at 6 months. Secondary endpoints 
included changes in office and 24 h ambulatory blood pressure. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT01911897.
Findings Between December, 2013, and February, 2016, 30 patients were enrolled and underwent successful 
implantation. Mean age was 52 years (SD 12), 15 patients (50%) were men, and mean antihypertensive use was 
4·4 drugs (1·4). Mean office blood pressure was 184/109 mm Hg (18/14) at baseline and was reduced by 24/12 mm Hg 
(13–34/6–18) at 6 months (p=0·0003 for systolic and p=0·0001 diastolic blood pressure). Mean baseline 24 h 
ambulatory blood pressure was 166/100 mm Hg (17/14) at baseline and was reduced by 21/12 mm Hg (14–29/7–16) at 
6 months (p<0·0001 for systolic and diastolic blood pressure). Five serious adverse events had occurred in four patients 
(13%) at 6 months: hypotension (n=2), worsening hypertension (n=1), intermittent claudication (n=1) and wound 
infection (n=1). 
Interpretation In patients with resistant hypertension, endovascular baroreceptor amplification with the MobiusHD 
device substantially lowered blood pressure with an acceptable safety profile. Randomised, double-blind, sham-
controlled trials are warranted to investigate the use of this treatment further.

Introduction
Approximately 10% of all treated hypertensive patients 
have resistant hypertension, defined as uncontrolled 
blood pressure despite treatment with three or more 
drugs, including a diuretic. Patients with resistant hyper­
tension have increased risks of cardiovascular and renal 
complications and all­cause mortality compared with 
patients who have controlled hypertension.1,2 Although 
additional drug therapies are effective,3 not all patients 
can tolerate these medications long term. Several devices 
have thus been developed for the treatment of resistant 
hypertension, but none has so far been adopted for 
routine care because safety or efficacy data from testing in 
sham­controlled trials are needed.4
Stimulation of the carotid baroreflex pathway offers 
the potential to treat resistant hypertension effectively. 
Amplifying the signal sensed by the carotid baroreceptors 
results in inhibition of sympathetic outflow, which 
results in a decrease in blood pressure.5 An implantable 
pulse generator that directly stimulates the carotid 
baroreceptors lowered blood pressure in a randomised 
clinical trial,6 but implants required an invasive surgical 
procedure, were associated with side­effects, and battery 
replacement was needed every few years.7 An alternative, 
less invasive approach to achieve baroreceptor ampli­
fication has been developed. The MobiusHD (Vascular 
Dynamics, Mountain View, CA, USA) is an endovascular 
implant that reshapes the carotid sinus (figure 1). 
Increased wall strain in the carotid sinus is sensed by the 
baroreceptors as increased pressure, and they respond by 
inhibiting sympathetic outflow, thereby reducing blood 
pressure.8
The concept of endovascular baroreceptor activation is 
built on coupling known stress­strain relations with 
the fundamental principles of pulsatile stretch­induced 
carotid baroreceptor activation. Simulation of fluid­
structure interaction in different carotid artery models 
indicated that the MobiusHD would induce a maximum 
increase of 7·5% in both circumferential and longitudinal 
wall stretch, and a maximum increase of 54·0% in von 
Mises arterial stress at the level of the carotid sinus, 
which suggested baroreceptors would be activated.9 In an 
acute study in dogs, the device induced a more 
pronounced increase in carotid sinus nerve activity than 
a standard carotid stent. Blood pressure was reduced by 
around 50/30 mm Hg, which was sustained for 6 h after

implantation without resetting or extinguishing of the 
haemodynamic effects (appendix). Long­term efficacy, 
however, was not possible because the canine carotid 
sinus is typically less than 1 mm in diameter, which leads 
to difficulty in maintaining device patency for extended 
periods of time. We therefore did a first­in­human study 
to assess the safety and efficacy of the device in patients 
with resistant hypertension.
Methods 
Study design and participants
The Controlling And Lowering blood pressure with the 
MobiusHD, First In Man, in EURope study (CALM­
FIM_EUR) was a prospective open­label study investi­
gating the safety and efficacy of this endovascular passive 
baroreflex amplification device in patients with resistant 
hyper 
tension. The study recruited adults from six 
European centres, five in the Netherlands and one in 
Germany. Eligible patients were aged 18–80 years and 
had resistant hypertension that had been stable for at 
least 30 days with the maximally tolerated doses of at 
least three anti 
hypertensive drugs, including a diuretic. 
Inclusion criteria were at least 80% adherence to 
antihypertensive medi 
cation, as self­reported daily in 
diaries for at least 30 days before enrolment, mean office 
systolic blood pressure 160 mm Hg or greater, mean 24 h 
ambulatory systolic blood pressure 130 mm Hg or 
greater, and mean 24 h ambulatory diastolic blood 
pressure 80 mm Hg or greater. Principal exclusion 
criteria included hypertension secondary to an identi­
fiable and treatable cause other than sleep apnoea; any 
plaque or ulceration in the carotid artery or aortic arch; 
internal carotid artery lumen diameter smaller than 
5·00 mm or larger than 11·75 mm at the planned 
implantation location; body­mass index 40 kg/m² or 
greater; chronic atrial fibrillation; any contraindication 
for dual antiplatelet therapy; use of chronic oral 
anticoagulation 
therapy; 
myocardial 
infarction 
or 
unstable angina in the past 3 months; cerebrovascular 
accident in the past year; estimated glomerular filtration 
rate 45 mL/min per 1·73 m² or less (based on the Chronic 
Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation10); 
previous surgery, radiation, or endovascular stent 
placement in either carotid region; cardiac valvular 
disease; decompensated heart failure, left­ventricular 
ejection fraction 30% or less, or both; use of an imidazoline­
receptor agonist, other centrally acting antihypertensive 
drugs, or both; and deep venous throm 
bosis within the 
past year or documented recurrent deep venous 
thrombosis. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are 
provided in the appendix. 
The study was approved by the local research ethics 
committee at each participating site. All patients provided 
written informed consent. Data were monitored by an 
independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB), with 
prespecified assessments done after device implantation 
in one, five, and ten patients.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Endovascular baroreflex amplification is a novel technique for 
lowering blood pressure. We searched PubMed for case reports, 
clinical trials, observational studies, and randomised controlled 
trials published up to May 1, 2017, in English, with the search 
terms “baroreflex”, “baroreceptor”, “activation”, “stimulation”, 
“amplification”, “hypertension”, and “blood pressure”. An 
implantable pulse generator that directly stimulates the 
carotid baroreceptors was associated with lowering of blood 
pressure in a randomised clinical trial, but implantation 
required an invasive surgical procedure and the treatment was 
associated with side-effects and required battery replacement 
every few years. Less invasive interventions to stimulate the 
carotid baroreceptors to lower blood pressure were not 
described.
Added value of this study
We showed that in patients with resistant hypertension, 
endovascular passive baroreflex amplification with MobiusHD 
(Vascular Dynamics, Mountain View, CA, USA) resulted in 
substantial lowering of blood pressure and reduced use of 
antihypertensive medication with an acceptable safety profile.
Implications of all the available evidence
Therapeutic activation of the baroreflex, whether via an 
implantable pulse generator or by an endovascular passive 
device, can substantially lower blood pressure in patients with 
resistant hypertension. Randomised, double-blind, 
sham-controlled clinical trials are warranted to definitively 
prove the safety and efficacy of the MobiusHD device.

Procedures
Before implantation, the carotid anatomy of potential 
recip 
ients was assessed by duplex ultrasonography and CT 
angiography or magnetic resonance angiography to en­
sure that the carotid arteries were suitable for implant 
ation 
(lumen diameters of the carotid sinuses between 5·00 and 
11·75 mm without atherosclerosis). The MobiusHD device 
was implanted by interventionalists who had previously 
done at least 100 carotid stent placements. Each operator 
received training before the first implantation from a 
representative of the sponsor, including in­vivo implant­
ations in sheep. All implantations were done in the 
presence of two sponsor representatives who mon 
itored 
the procedure. Dual anti 
platelet therapy with 80–325 mg 
aspirin and a P2Y12­receptor inhibitor (75 mg clopidogrel 
or equivalent substitute) was admin 
istered from 3 days 
before to 3 months after implantation. Aspirin was con­
tinued indefinitely.
A 6 Fr guide sheath or 8 Fr guiding catheter was inserted 
via the femoral artery over a 0·035 inch (0·09 mm) 
guidewire and advanced to the carotid artery. Angiographic 
measurements were undertaken to confirm the dia­
meter of the carotid sinus and to select an appropriate 
implant size. The implants are available in three sizes: 
5·00–7·00 mm, 6·25–9·00 mm, and 8·00–11·75 mm. A 
0·014 inch (0·04 mm) guidewire was navigated into the 
distal internal carotid artery, and the delivery catheter was 
introduced over the guidewire and the implant was 
deployed at the target site. Devices were implanted 
unilaterally with no predefined preference for the right or 
left internal carotid artery. Intravenous heparin was given 
during the implantation procedure according to local 
hospital carotid stent protocols.
Baseline assessments included office and 24 h ambu­
latory blood pressure measurements, physical exam­
ination, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 
(NIHSS) scores, review of medications, basic blood 
chemistry and haematology, and duplex imaging of the 
carotid artery. Follow­up assessments were done on the 
day of discharge, 7 days and 1, 3, and 6 months after 
discharge, and every 6 months thereafter until 3 years 
after implantation. At the time of reporting, all patients 
had completed 6 months of follow­up.
Office blood pressure was measured at each follow­up 
visit, after 5 min rest while the patient was seated. 
Measurements were taken with an automated oscillo­
metric device (Omron M10­IT, OMRON Healthcare, 
Hoofddorp, Netherlands) with selected appropriate cuff
 
size in the non­dominant arm. Two readings were recorded 
for every assessment, 1 min apart, and the results were 
averaged. If the difference in systolic blood pressure 
between the two measurements was more than 5 mm Hg, 
a third measurement was taken and the latter two values 
were used to obtain the average. 24 h ambulatory blood 
pressure monitoring was done at baseline and at 3 and 
6 months after implantation with an oscillometric device 
(Spacelabs 90217, Spacelabs Healthcare, Issaqua, WA, 
USA) applied to the non­dominant arm. Blood pressure 
was recorded every 30 min during the day and every 
60 min during the night. The 24 h recordings were deemed 
acceptable if at least 70% of the readings over the 24 h 
period were successfully recorded and at least 14 of them 
were recorded in the daytime and at least seven at night.
Laboratory chemistry and haematology measurements 
were analysed at local hospital laboratories. At each visit, 
adverse events were recorded. Investigators were told not 
to change patients’ medications except when medically 
required for hypotension or worsening hypertension. 
Patients were asked to adhere to their prescribed 
antihypertensive drugs and to record use per day in a diary.
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was the incidence of serious adverse 
events, including unanticipated adverse device effects, 
at 6 months. All adverse events were reviewed and 
adjudicated by the DSMB. Secondary endpoints included 
changes from baseline in office and 24 h ambulatory blood 
pressures and use of antihypertensive medication at any 
time during the 6­month follow­up period. To assess the 
intensity of antihypertensive medication use over time, 
doses were converted to total daily defined doses (DDD) by 
use of conversion factors provided by WHO’s Collaborating 
Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology.11 Reductions in 
mean office systolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg or more, 
in mean 24 h ambulatory systolic blood pressure of 
5 mm Hg or more, or use of antihypertensive medication at 
6 months were taken to be clinically important responses. 
All data were centrally collected via an electronic case report 
form and monitored by the study sponsor. 
Statistical analysis
The number of patients needed to establish study device 
feasibility was informed by the sample sizes in similar 
feasibility studies assessing continuous endpoints.12 The 
enrolment of 30 patients also met the minimum sample 
size for a feasibility study suggested by Browne.13 In 
concert with regulatory bodies, it was therefore decided 
that a sample of 30 patients would be appropriate to 
establish signals related to safety and efficacy, since 
substantial improvement in blood pressure would be 
needed to justify the risk of a carotid implant. We calculated 
mean (SD) office and 24 h ambulatory blood pressures. 
Changes from baseline in blood pressure and medication 
use over the 6 months of follow­up were analysed by one­
way ANOVA with pairwise comparisons of significant 
values and Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. 
A multivariate linear regression model was applied to 
explore which baseline and procedural characteristics were 
related to the change in 24 h mean ambulatory systolic 
blood pressure at 6 months, and used the Mann­Whitney 
U test for dichotomous comparisons in subgroups. 
Wilcoxon’s signed rank test was used to compare changes 
in the number of antihypertensive medications used and 
DDD from baseline to 6 months. Two­tailed p values less

Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had a role in the study design, data 
analysis, and had the right to a non­binding review of the 
final report. The funder had no role in the data analysis, 
data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corre­
sponding author had access to all the data in the study and 
had final responsibility for the decision to submit for 
publication.
Results
86 patients were screened between December, 2013, and 
February, 2016, among whom 32 (37%) underwent carotid 
angiography (figure 2). Two patients had inappropriate 
vessel diameters for device implantation and were 
excluded. The remaining 30 patients were included and 
underwent implantation (figure 2, table 1).
MobiusHD was successfully implanted in all patients, 
in the right internal carotid artery in 19 and in the 
left internal carotid artery in 11. Eight patients received 
implants of 5·00–7·00 mm, 20 of 6·25–9·00 mm, and 
two of 8·00–11·75 mm.
As adjudicated by the DSMB, five serious adverse 
events occurred in four patients that were deemed to be 
possibly related to the procedure or device (table 2), 
but none were classified as unanticipated adverse 
device effects. One patient was admitted to hospital 
6 days after implantation with worsening of hypertension 
because of self­initiated discontinuation of medications. 
Antihypertensive medications were reintroduced, but 
resulted in hypotension, leading to dose adjustment that 
stabilised blood pressure. One patient developed hypo­
tension 2 days after implantation and needed to be 
admitted to hospital for rehydration and medication 
reduction, to which the patient responded. One patient 
was admitted with worsening hypertension 33 days after 
implantation that was treatable with increased antihyper­
tensive medication. In one patient, intermittent claudi­
cation developed due to a dislodged femoral closure 
device, which was treated with surgical thrombo­
endarterectomy. The wound later became infected and 
needed drainage and antibiotic treatment. Ipsilateral 
focal neuro 
logical events immediately after implantation 
were reported in two patients treated at one study centre, 
which were initially interpreted as minor strokes. 
One patient had received an implant in the right carotid 
sinus during a procedure without complications and 
noticed reduced strength and numbness of her left arm 
and leg 5 min after implantation (NIHSS score 6). CT 
angiography showed no abnormalities. The symptoms 
were almost recovered at discharge 1 day later (NIHSS 
score 0), although the patient reported difficulty with 
walking due to “delay” of her left foot. The other patient 
had received a left­sided implant during a procedure 
without complications. Directly after implantation the 
patient complained of numbness and reduced strength 
of the right arm and leg (NIHSS score 2). CT angiography 
showed no abnormalities. Most of the symptoms had

resolved 1 day later (NIHSS score 0). At 3 weeks after 
implantation, the patient complained of pain, tiredness, 
and cramps in the right arm and leg. These two patients 
had not taken their antihypertensive medi 
cation before 
the implantation and both had systolic blood pressure 
greater than 200 mm Hg during the procedure. The 
DSMB did not feel the residual symptoms in these 
two patients were neurological and, because the NIHSS 
scores were 0 in both patients 1 day after implantation, 
these events were judged not to be strokes but, rather, 
transient ischaemic attacks.
No device migrations and no significant changes in 
plaque formations in the carotid arteries were seen. Of 
42 adverse events, the most frequently reported were 
dizziness (n=9, 21%), musculoskeletal pain (n=7, 17%), 
and hypotension (n=5, 12%).
During the first 24 h after implantation, office blood 
pressure decreased by a mean of 38/23 mm Hg (95% CI 
29–46/16–29). During follow­up, the mean reductions 
from baseline in office blood pressure were 27/14 mm Hg 
(18–37/8–21) at 1 week, 22/10 mm Hg (12–31/3–16) at 
1 month, 24/11 mm Hg (12–35/4–18) at 3 months, and 
24/12 mm Hg (13–34/6–18) at 6 months (figure 3). At all 
timepoints after implantation, mean office systolic and 
diastolic blood pressures were significantly lower than at 
baseline (all p<0·02 in the overall ANOVA and reaching 
p=0·0003 for systolic and p=0·0001 for diastolic blood 
pressure at 6 months in the pairwise analysis, figure 3). 
Reductions in 24 h mean ambulatory blood pressures were 
15/8 mm Hg (95% CI 7–23/3–13) at 3 months and 
21/12 mm Hg (14–29/7–16) at 6 months (all p<0·002 in the 
overall ANOVA, and reaching p<0·0001 for systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure at 6 months, figure 4).
In 22 (73%) patients, blood­pressure reductions met 
predefined criteria for clinically important response 
(reduction in office systolic blood pressure of ≥10 mm Hg 
and in 24 h mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure of 
≥5 mm Hg or using less antihypertensive medication at 
6 months). In 25 (83%) patients, a mean reduction in 24 h 
ambulatory systolic blood pressure of 5 mm Hg or more 
or reduced use of antihypertensive medication was seen at 
6 months. We found no significant associ 
ations between 
change in 24 h mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure 
at 6 months and any of the following variables: age, sex, 
baseline body­mass index, baseline 24 h mean ambulatory 
systolic blood pressure, baseline office heart rate, baseline 
estimated glomerular filtration rate, previous renal 
denervation therapy, and side of implanted device 
(appendix). Dichotomous subgroup analyses of these 
variables also indicated no differences in change of mean 
24 h ambulatory systolic blood pressure at 6 months, 
except in the comparison of mean baseline values greater 
than 168 mm Hg versus less than 168 mm Hg, where the 
changes were –29 mm Hg (IQR –44 to –14) versus 
–9 mm Hg (–19 to –3, p=0·0080; appendix).
Mean heart rates during follow­up were 74 (SD 14), 
76 (14), 76 (15), and 78 (15) beats per min at 1 week, and 1, 
3, and 6 months, respectively. None differed significantly 
from baseline.
Self­reported adherence to prescribed medications was 
greater than 80% in all patients during follow­up. The 
median number of antihypertensive medications was 
reduced by 0·50 (IQR 1·25–0, p=0·0020) and the median 
DDD was reduced by 0·42 units (2·13–0·09, p=0·010) at 
6 months.
Discussion
This first­in­human study of a novel endovascular baro­
reflex amplification device, the MobiusHD, showed accept­
able safety and resulted in clinically important reductions 
in office and 24 h ambulatory blood pressure in patients 
with resistant hypertension. Additionally, need for medi­
cation was lessened in most patients during 6 months 
of follow­up. The favourable effect on blood pressure 
occurred irrespective of patients’ baseline character 
istics, 
blood pressure, or medication use. More

experienced in carotid stent placement, who achieved 
100% procedural success.
Reductions in blood pressure were substantial in most 
patients and resulted in symptomatic hypotension in 17% 
of patients. Most of these episodes were successfully 
managed by reductions in antihypertensive medications. 
However, as cerebral autoregulation might be impaired in 
patients with long­standing hypertension, a more 
controlled reduction in blood pressure is preferable. This 
effect might be achieved by routine periprocedural saline 
infusion. Also, despite the absence of atherosclerotic 
plaques in the treated vessels, ipsilateral focal neurological 
events were noted immediately after device implantation 
in two patients treated in one study centre. Both patients 
had stopped taking antihypertensive medication before 
implantation and, consequently, had very high blood 
pressures at the start of and during the procedures. Of 
note, an autoinjector for contrast was used in these cases, 
but not at other sites, and we cannot exclude that this was 
the explanation for these two events. CT angiography in 
these two cases did not reveal any abnormalities, but might 
have been less sensitive than diffusion­weighted magnetic 
resonance angiography, which was not done. Given the 
ipsi 
lateral nature of these two neurological events, platelet 
thrombo 
emboli, contrast encephalopathy due to severe 
hyper 
tension during the multiple angiograms, air emboli, 
device­related particulates, or focal hypoperfusion of a 
vulnerable area of the brain due to hypotension cannot be 
excluded.
We saw substantial decreases in blood pressure in the 
first 24 h after implantation of the MobiusHD, which is 
consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of the 
device. Previous studies have shown that stimulation of 
the carotid baroreceptors results in immediate inhibition 
of sympathetic outflow and reduction in blood pressure.5 
In this study, reductions in blood pressure persisted at 
6 months, with the mean difference from baseline in office 
blood pressure being –24/–12 mm Hg despite less use of 
antihypertensive therapy than at baseline. Similar and 
sustained effects were noted on 24 h ambulatory blood 
pressure at 6 months (mean change –21/–12 mm Hg). 
Subgroup analyses indicated that only a higher 24 h 
ambulatory systolic blood pressure at baseline was 
significantly associated with the change in 24 h ambulatory 
systolic blood pressure at 6 months. Studies in baroreflex 
activation therapy show that right­sided stimulation has a 
more profound effect on blood pressure than left­sided 
stimulation.14 We found no difference in effects between 
patients who had endovascular baroreflex amplification 
implants in the right or the left internal carotid artery, but 
the study was not powered to assess this difference, which 
might explain the discrepancy. We saw no tachyphylaxis or 
carotid­sinus resetting after blood pressure response, 
meaning that the effect of device implantation on blood 
pressure did not seem to diminish over time for up to 
6 months.
Our study has several limitations. As a first­in­human 
study, the CALM­FIM_EUR study was small, non­
controlled, and unblinded. Although two focal ipsilateral 
neurological events were seen, major strokes did not occur, 
nor were there any unanticipated device­related safety 
issues up to 6 months. Larger studies with more patients 
and longer follow­up are needed to further assess the 
safety profile of this intervention and to determine whether 
device fracture, migration, thrombosis, intimal prolifer­
ation at the implantation site, or other complications occur. 
Our study was also not large enough to establish whether 
differential blood pressure responses would occur in 
specific subgroups of patients. Second, we cannot rule out 
the role of placebo and Hawthorne effects contributing to 
the magnitude of reductions in blood pressure owing to 
the unblinded and uncontrolled study design. In this 
regard, promising results were seen with renal denervation 
in the proof­of­principle Symplicity HTN­1 study,15 and

even in the randomised, but unblinded, Symplicity HTN­2 
trial.16 The findings, however, were not replicated in the 
randomised, double­blind, sham­controlled Symplicity 
HTN­3 trial.17 Third, although self­reported adherence to 
prescribed antihypertensive medications was good (>80%), 
we did not directly measure metabolites in blood or urine 
to confirm use. Adherence to antihypertensive medication 
might be an important confounder in characterising the 
true effects of novel therapies on lowering blood pressure 
in patients with resistant hypertension.18,19 Finally, follow­
up was not long enough to assess whether the haemo­
dynamic responses are sustained over time.
Implantation of the passive endovascular baroreflex 
amplification device MobiusHD in patients with resistant 
hypertension was feasible and was associated with 
acceptable safety when done in carefully selected patients 
by an operator experienced in endovascular carotid artery 
intervention. Device placement resulted in immediate and 
substantial reductions in blood pressure that were 
sustained for at least 6 months. Based on these findings, 
two randomised, double­blind, sham­controlled trials of 
safety and efficacy with the MobiusHD in patients with 
resistant hypertension are planned—the CALM­START 
(off medication) and the CALM­II (treated resistant 
hypertension).
