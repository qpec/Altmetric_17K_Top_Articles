ABSTRACT: Rodent studies demonstrate that supplementing the maternal diet with choline during pregnancy pro-
duces life-long cognitive benefits for the offspring. In contrast, the two experimental studies examining cognitive
effects of maternal choline supplementation in humans produced inconsistent results, perhaps because of poor
participant adherence and/or uncontrolled variation in intake of choline or other nutrients. We examined the effects
of maternal choline supplementation during pregnancy on infant cognition, with intake of choline and other
nutrients tightly controlled. Women entering their third trimester were randomized to consume, until delivery,
either 480 mg choline/d (n = 13) or 930 mg choline/d (n = 13). Infant information processing speed and visuospatial
memory were tested at 4, 7, 10, and 13 mo of age (n = 24). Mean reaction time averaged across the four ages was
significantly faster for infants born to mothers in the 930 (vs. 480) mg choline/d group. This result indicates that
maternal consumption of approximately twice the recommended amount of choline during the last trimester im-
proves infant information processing speed. Furthermore, for the 480-mg choline/d group, there was a significant
linear effect of exposure duration (infants exposed longer showed faster reaction times), suggesting that even
modest increases in maternal choline intake during pregnancy may produce cognitive benefits for offspring.—

Demand for the essential nutrient choline is extremely
high during prenatal development because of accelera-
tions in fetal and placental tissue expansion, DNA meth-
ylation, and other physiologic processes (1–3). Choline
supplyis of particularimportance forthe developing brain
because it is a precursor of acetylcholine, a key neuro-
transmitter for regulating neuronal proliferation, differ-
entiation, migration, maturation, plasticity, and survival,
as well as for synapse formation (4–8). Choline also pro-
vides substrate for the formation of phosphatidylcholine
and sphingomyelin, principal components of neuronal
and other cellular membranes required for signal trans-
duction, brain development, and fetal growth (9–11).
Moreover, choline is the primary dietary source of methyl
groups, which, via epigenetic modifications, can exert
lasting effects on gene expression (8, 12, 13).
More than 25 yr of research with rodents has consis-
tently demonstrated that supplementing the maternal
diet with additional choline produces life-long cognitive
benefits for the offspring (14, 15). Furthermore, maternal
choline supplementation not only improves offspring
spatial memory and attentional function in young adult
animals(16–20)butalsocanreduceorpreventnormalage-
related decline in those core cognitive functions (15). Ma-
ternal choline supplementation is also neuroprotective
against a range of prenatal and early postnatal neural in-
sults (21–25). The exact mechanisms responsible for those
beneficial effects on cognitive performance are incom-
pletely understood but are likely linked to the enduring
neuroanatomic, neurochemical, molecular, and electro-
physiologic changes that are caused by variations in pre-
natal choline supply (15, 24).
Despite numerous studies showing beneficial cogni-
tive effects of maternal choline supplementation in ani-
mal models, only two experimental studies have been

 conducted, to our knowledge, to evaluate that putative
effect in humans. Ross et al. (26) conducted a randomized,
placebo-controlled trial of phosphatidylcholine supple-
mentation (;900 mg choline/d), beginning in the second
trimester of pregnancy and continuing into the third
postnatal month. At 5 wk of age, a greater percentage of
the infants in the choline-supplemented group, relative to
the control group, exhibited electrophysiologic evidence
of cerebral inhibition in an auditory, evoked-response
task—a characteristic associated with a reduced risk of
both attentional dysfunction and schizophrenia as the
child matures. In the other study, Cheatham et al. (27)
randomized pregnant women to placebo or supplemental
phosphatidylcholine (750 mg choline/d) from 18 wk ges-
tation through 90 d postpartum. Infants were tested at
both 10 and 12 mo of age using tasks of short-term,
visuospatial memory and long-term, episodic memory
but, contrary to predictions from the animal work, no ef-
fects of maternal choline supplementation were observed.
It is not clear why this latter study did not observe a cog-
nitive benefit of increased maternal choline intake. How-
ever, it could be due to poor participant adherence and/or
uncontrolled variations in the intake of choline and other
nutrients. In the current study, we sought to further ex-
amine that question in humans under conditions of highly
controlled maternal intake of choline and other nutrients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The present study was a single-center, randomized, double-
blind, parallel-group controlled feeding intervention conducted
at Cornell University (3). Ethics approval was obtained from the
Institutional Review Board for Human Study Participant Use at
CornellUniversity.Thistrialwasregistered(NCT-1127022)atthe
U.S. National Library of Medicine (Bethesda, MD, USA; https://
clinicaltrials.gov/); it was not overseen by a data monitoring
committee and is now closed.
Participants
Pregnant women were recruited between January 2009 and Oc-
tober 2010 at maternity clinics throughout the Ithaca (NY, USA)
region using flyers. Eligible participants were $21 yr old, enter-
ing their third trimester of pregnancy (self-reported), and were
willing to comply with the study protocol, which required them
to eat $5 meals/wk on-site, and consume only study-provided
foods and beverages. Women were excluded if they were anemic
(based on complete blood cell count), had blood markers of
kidneyandliverfunctionoutsideofthereferencerange(basedon
blood chemistry profile), or reported having cardiovascular dis-
ease, cancer, type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, gastrointestinal dis-
orders, or kidney orliver disease(based on health questionnaire).
Additional exclusion criteria included use of prescription med-
ications known to affect liver function; presence of .1 fetus; self
-reported tobacco, drug, or alcohol use during gestation; or
presence of pregnancy-associated complications (e.g., preeclamp-
sia, gestational diabetes). Of the 29 women recruited, 26 (90%)
completed the protocol, and 24 (83%) provided written, in-
formed consent to have their infants participate in the
cognitive-assessment component of the study (Fig. 1). One of
the pregnant women in the 480 mg choline/d group in-
advertently entered the study at gestational week 23 (rather
than wk 27), which increased her exposure time to the study
intervention.
Randomization and masking
Upon study entry, pregnant women were randomized on a 1:1
ratio to receive either 480 or 930 mg choline/d. All women con-
sumedthestandardstudydiet(providing380mgcholine/d)and
a choline supplement of either 100 or 550 mg/d to achieve target
choline doses of 480 or 930 mg/d, respectively. The supplement
wasmixedwithcranberry–grapejuiceandservedin50-ml,color-
coded, conical tubes (opaque blue or purple) to conceal the
supplemental dose from the participant. Study personnel who
performed the cognitive assessments and statistical analyses had
no role in the intervention phase of the feeding study and were
blinded to the choline dose assignment.
Procedures
Feeding study
Eligible pregnant women entered the feeding study on a rolling
basis until target numbers of 13 in each choline group were
achieved. The study diet (3) provided an average of 380 mg
choline/d and 2100 calories/d across the 7-d rotational menu,
which could be adjusted to meet caloric needs by adding or
subtracting noncholine containing foods and beverages (e.g.,
white rice and sugar-sweetened beverages). Supplemental cho-
line (choline chloride; Balchem, New Hampton, NY, USA) at
intake levels of 100 or 550 mg was prepared by study personnel,
as described in Yan et al. (3). On weekdays, participants con-
sumedatleast1meal/danddrankthecholinesupplementunder
the supervision of study personnel in the Human Metabolic
Research Unit. All other weekday meals were provided as take-
away food and were consumed off site. On weekends, partici-
pantsconsumedallmealsoffsiteandwereinstructedtoconsume
the supplement with the take-away meal of their choice. Partic-
ipant adherence to the designated two levels of choline intake
was high, based on in-laboratory monitoring of the consumption
of the choline supplement on 5 of 7 d/wk, completion of daily
food checklists, and the return of the supplement and food con-
tainers. Further evidence for excellent adherence was provided
by the finding that fasting plasma concentrations of choline and
its metabolites were significantly greater in the women con-
suming 930 mg choline/d than in those consuming 480 mg
choline/d (3).
To meet nutrient recommendations and consensus guidelines
for pregnant women (11, 28) and to further ensure comparable
nutrient intake, participants received the same daily, over-the-
counter, prenatal multivitamin supplement (Pregnancy Plus; Fair-
haven Health, Bellingham, WA, USA), a 200-mg docosahexaenoic
acid supplement (Nature’s Way Neuromins; Schwabe North
America, Green Bay, WI, USA), and a thrice weekly potassium and
magnesium supplement (General Nutrition Corp., Pittsburgh, PA,
USA). These supplements were consumed at the on-site meal dur-
ing the week and with an off-site meal on weekends.
Most women completed the 12-wk feeding study before de-
livering their babies. Those who had not delivered after 12 wk
continued the designated supplement regimen until delivery.
Data collection
Maternal and newborn information were obtained from medical
charts at the time of delivery. Maternal information included due
date, complications during the third trimester of pregnancy, and
complications during labor or delivery. Newborn information

 included the date and method of delivery, gestational age, birth
weight, and gender.
Cognitive testing
During 1-h laboratory visits at ;4, 7, 10, and 13 mo of age, infants
performed a visual attention task designed to measure the la-
tency of saccadic eye movements to locations on a display screen,
in which small, animated pictures appeared. Two types of sac-
cades are distinguished in this task: 1) visually guided reactive
saccades, which occur when the infant detects a peripheral
stimulus and makes an abrupt shift in visual fixation to align the
fovea with the visual target; and 2) memory-guided, anticipatory
saccades, which occurwhen the infant predicts the appearance of
a future picture based on detecting the spatiotemporal regularity
of past picture onsets (29). Reactive saccades provide an early
measure of information processing speed—widely acknowl-
edged to be an important dimension of individual differences in
human cognitive performance and intelligence (30). That is, in-
fant saccade reaction time, assessed on 1 occasion as early as 3–4
mo of age, predicts information processing speed later in child-
hood (assessed in a manual reaction time paradigm) and child-
hood intelligent quotient (IQ) scores (31, 32). Moreover,
longitudinal studies reveal that infant saccade reaction time
shows lawful, age-related changes across the first year of life and
robust stability of individual differences during infancy (33, 34).
In contrast, the number of anticipatory saccades an infant makes
dependsgreatlyonthenatureofthestimulussequencepresented
and has not generally provided a reliable index of age-related
changes or individual differences during infancy (33, 34). How-
ever, measures of visual anticipation in young infants have been
shown to predict IQ scores in childhood (32) and some compo-
nents of adult IQ (35).

a sequence of animated images that appeared briefly at 10° to the
left or right of visual center. Each image appeared for 700 ms and
was followed by a 1.0-s interstimulus interval (blank screen).
Infrared corneal reflection videography was used to record the
eye region (at 30 Hz) as infants made visual fixation shifts during
the 37-image sequence. The side of appearance of the first 7 im-
ages (baseline sequence) was unpredictable, whereas the sub-
sequent30imagesappearedinapredictableleft–rightalternation
(postbaseline sequence). For each video frame of eye movement
data, eye position and stimulus position were scored off-line by
human observers (blinded to the choline intake level of the
mother) using computer-assisted software. Saccade latencies
were computed as the difference between the time of stimulus
onset and the time the infant’s eye began rotating to fixate at the
location of the stimulus. A predictive saccade was defined as any
fixation shift directed toward the next stimulus location that oc-
curred before the actual onset of the stimulus (i.e., during the
interstimulus interval) plus those saccades that occurred so
quickly after stimulus onset that they could not have been trig-
gered by the visual information itself (i.e., ,133 ms) (34). Fixation
shifts that followed the onset of the stimulus onset by $133 ms
were defined as reactive (i.e., visually guided) saccades (34).
Outcomes

stimulus-guided fixation shifts. Our secondary outcome was the

at ages 4, 7, 10, and 13 mo and were computed separately for
fixation shifts to unpredictable stimuli during the baseline se-
quence and for fixation shifts during the postbaseline alternating

 sequence. As a result, each infant could contribute up to 2 data
points for each outcome at each assessment age.
Statistical analysis
The sample size of the pregnant women who participated in the
feeding study was based on a power calculation that predicted
differences of 20% in biomarkers of choline metabolism (choline
and betaine) with a power of 80% at an a of 0.05 between choline
intake groups (i.e., 480 compared with 930 mg/d). For the mean
saccade reaction time, analyses were powered at .80% to detect
a difference of 10% between groups. All participants were in-
cluded in all analyses by intention to treat. Statistical analyses
were conducted using linear or logistic mixed-model methods in
SAS 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Statistical
significance was set at P , 0.05 for main effects and P , 0.10 for
interactions. All tests were 2-tailed.
For mean saccade reaction time, we used linear, mixed-effects
regression modeling for longitudinal data with random coeffi-
cients to estimate and test parameters of individual growth
curves(36).Agewasenteredasthenaturallogarithmofpostnatal
age in days on each of the 4 testing dates to account for the
nonlinearity of age-related change in saccade reaction time dur-
ing that age period (34).
The effects of maternal choline intake level on mean saccade
reaction time was first examined using an unadjusted model that
included fixed effects for the independent variables choline intake
(480 or 930 mg/d), infant age in days (;4, 7, 10, and 13 mo), and
image sequence type (unpredictable baseline vs. predictable
postbaseline sequence). Random effects were estimated for the
intercept and slope of age, for sequence type as a grouping
variable, and for the individual child. We used restricted
maximum-likelihood estimation and assumed an unstructured
variance–covariance matrix. This model tested whether greater
third-trimester, maternal choline intake resulted in faster infant
mean saccade reaction time and whether the choline dose effect, if
any, varied as a function of age, the type of image sequence, or the
interactionofageandsequence type(i.e.,allinteractionsincluded).
Foradjustedanalyses,weprespecifiedtheinclusionofcovariates
known to be prognostic of infant cognitive outcomes. First, we in-
cluded maternal age at conception and maternal education because
recruitment for the feeding study did not include them as stratifi-
cation variables. Second, we included gestational age, birth weight,
and presence of labor or delivery complications because they were
unknowable at the time of random assignment. Finally, ethnicity/
race was included as a covariate because it affected the randomi-
zation (37) (via a minimization procedure). In this a priori model,
covariates were entered only as fixed main effects (no interactions
included). After the adjusted analyses, we conducted a secondary
analysis to explore a refinement to our exposure estimation.
The same modeling approach was used for the secondary
outcome, number of predictive saccades, with the following ex-
ceptions. First, because number of predictive saccades is a count
variable,weused logistic, mixed-modelregression methods with
Poisson distribution and used the logarithm of the number of
opportunitiestoanticipateapictureasanoffset,usingtheSAS9.4
Glimmix procedure. Second, because the number of predictive
saccades has no confirmed pattern of age-related change, post-
natal age was entered as an untransformed variable, and only a
random intercept was included.
RESULTS
Data were obtained from 24 of the 26 eligible infants
(92%). Table 1 shows baseline demographic and clinical
characteristics of mothers and infants that were consid-
ered in the statistical models for the 480 and 930 mg
choline/d groups. No adverse effects of the choline doses
were reported.
Saccade reaction time
For mean saccade reaction time, data were available for
139 of 192 possible participant visits (72%) and a total of
1477 stimulus presentation trials. Unadjusted regression
analyses revealed that, when averaged across all ages and
both sequence types (unpredictable, predictable), the es-
timated mean saccade reaction time for infants in the 930
mg choline/d group was 22.6 ms faster [confidence in-
terval (CI): 1.3–43.8 ms; P = 0.03) than the mean saccade
reaction time for infants in the 480 mg choline/d group
(Supplemental Fig. 1). There was a highly significant effect
of age at reaction time assessment (P , 0.0001), indicating
that saccade reaction times became faster from 4 to 13 mo.
However, that age-related increase in speed did not differ
by choline intake group (interaction P = 0.3). There was
also no effect of sequence type and no interactions in-
volving any combination of intake group, sequence type,
or age (all values P .0.2).
Adjusted analyses from the a priori model revealed a
greater (33.8 ms; CI: 2.7–54.8 ms) beneficial effect of higher
maternal choline intake, as compared with the unadjusted
model estimate. The statistically significant difference (P =
0.03)inreactiontime-betweenthetwocholineintakegroups
is illustrated in Fig. 2, which also shows the decline in mean
saccade reaction time with increasing age for both groups
(P , 0.0001) and that the effect of maternal choline intake
level did not differ significantly as a function of age (age 3
choline intake group interaction P = 0.4). Gestational age

associated with an 18.3 ms decline (CI: 0.5–36.1) in mean
saccade reaction time (when saccade reaction time was es-
timated at gestation age of 40 wk and infant age of 7 mo).
To further characterize dose–response in an intent-to-
treat fashion, we explored the possibility that gestational
age was serving as a proxy for differences in duration of
choline exposure by including the number of days of ex-
posure to the intervention in our a priori–adjusted model. In
that model, there was a statistically significant effect of days
of exposure (P = 0.02); the estimated effect of the choline
dose was 51.3 ms (CI: 15.8–86.7 ms), and the effect of ges-
tational age was no longer significant (P = 0.3). In a final
model, we estimated the simple effects of days of exposure
to the intervention, nested in dose, which revealed a sig-
nificant effect of exposure days for the 480 mg choline/d
group (b = 22.25; SE = 0.64, P , 0.001), but no effect in the
930 mg choline/d group (b = 20.17; SE = 1.27, P = 0.9).
Figure 3A shows the dose–response for the predicted
mean saccade reaction time by days of prenatal exposure
to 480 mg choline/d intake for all ages combined, and
Fig. 3B shows that relationship at each assessment age.

 predictable stimulus sequence than they did during the
unpredictable baseline sequence (mean difference = 1.14;
P , 0.0001). However, no significant effect of maternal
choline intake during pregnancy was detected for the
number of predictive saccades (mean difference = 0.08;
P = 0.7). Adjustment for covariates in the a priori model
did not alter that result (mean difference = 0.08; P = 0.6)
but revealed that infants who experienced a medical
complication during pregnancy or labor produced fewer
predictive saccades than did infants without such com-
plications (mean difference = 0.39; P = 0.01). The number
of prenatal exposure days to choline was not related to
the number of anticipatory saccades produced (P = 0.5).
DISCUSSION
The results of this controlled-feeding trial reveal signifi-
cantly faster saccade reaction time, a measure of in-
formation processing speed (30,34), among infants bornto
mothers consuming the higher level of choline intake
throughout their third trimester. Infants of mothers ran-
domly assigned to consume 930 mg choline/d were con-
sistently movements than were the infants of mothers
who consumed 480 mg choline/d. Notably, infants in the
930mgcholine/dgroupwereconsistentlyfastertoreactto
pictures across the 4 assessment ages, indicating that the
beneficial effect of a higher maternal choline intake on in-
fant information processing speed endured for at least the
first year of postnatal life. Moreover, those findings were
not model dependent because they were observed in both
unadjusted and a priori covariate-adjusted models. In light
of prior evidence that infant saccade reaction time predicts
IQ scores and information processing speed in early
childhood (31, 32), our findings support the view that
maternal choline supplementation has lasting beneficial
effects on offspring cognitive function. Finally, our find-
ings indicate that the last trimester of pregnancy consti-
tutes a sensitive period for the functional effects of
maternal choline supplementation on cognitive develop-
ment, consistent with the animal data (19, 38). However,
maternal choline supplementation during other stages of
pregnancy and/or early postnatal development may also
have lasting offspring effects, and the present study does
not address their relative sensitivity.
Our findingsalsoprovide some supportfor a beneficial
effect of consuming 480 mg choline/d, relative to wom-
en’s usual choline intake. Specifically, we found a signif-
icant linear dose–response showing that faster infant
processing speed was associated with a greater number of
days of fetal exposure to the 480 mg/d maternal choline
dose, even after controlling for the gestational age at birth.
That duration effect could have been found only if par-
ticipants’ usual choline intake (i.e., prior to the start of the
intervention) was substantially ,480 mg/d; otherwise, if
usualcholine intakewasapproximatelyequalto480mg/d,
then all participants would have had the same duration
of exposure to that amount of choline throughout preg-
nancy, regardless of the number of days the intervention
was administered. This inference is consistent with the
evidence, discussed above, indicating that the average
choline intake ofpregnant womenin theU.S. is ;300–350
mg choline/d, with fewer than 25% of women consum-
ing the adequate intake (AI) level (39–41). Considered in
that light, the intake duration effect we report suggests
that, even a modest increase in typical maternal choline
intake during pregnancy would be beneficial for infant

 information processing speed, with possible long-term
benefits for offspring cognitive function throughout life.
Although few studies have examined the effect of ma-
ternalcholineintakeonoffspringcognitioninhumans,our
finding of faster information processing speed among
infants of mothers consuming more choline during
pregnancy is broadly consistent with results from the
randomized clinical trial by Ross et al. (26) showing im-
proved auditory sensory gating among 5-wk-old infants
of choline-supplemented mothers. The Ross finding and
our present finding could both reflect enhanced gating
of extrinsic stimuli by Ch6 cholinergic neurons in the
brainstem reticular formation and/or Ch1 cholinergic
neurons in the basal forebrain medial septal nucleus (42,
43).Another factorcontributing tofaster processingspeed
could be improved nerve conduction velocity because of
greater availability of choline-derived cell membrane
phospholipids (e.g., phosphatidylcholine and sphingo-
myelin) (44). Other mechanisms could relate to lasting
changes in gene expression because of choline’s role as a
primary dietary source of methyl groups (45, 46).
In contrast to the saccade reaction time findings, we
found no evidence for an effect of maternal choline intake
on the number of anticipatory saccades, a putative mea-
sure of spatial memory for sequential regularity. Cheat-
ham et al. (27) also reported no effects of maternal choline
supplementation on infant spatial memory assessed at 10
and 12 mo using a manual search task. These findings
might indicate that prenatal choline does not affect the
cognitive operations underlying spatial memory in hu-
mans(contrary torodents) but sucha conclusion would be
premature given the paucity of experimental studies with
human subjects. It is also possible that effects of prenatal
choline on neural systems subserving spatial memory do
not emerge until later in life, given that the neural systems
underlying mature forms of spatial and episodic memory
do not emerge until after 2 yr of age in humans (47).
Consistent with that contention are the results of a large,
prospective study by Boeke et al. (39), which reported
a positive association between maternal self-reported,
third-trimester choline intake and children’s performance
on two visual memory tasks at age 7 yr.
The present study had several strengths which, in
combination, likely increased our ability to detect an effect
in a small sample of infants. First, during the intervention
period, all participants consumed the same foods from a

points are predicted values from the a priori mixed-effects regression model of maternal choline intake group on mean saccade
reaction time, adjusted for the natural logarithm of infant age at testing, gestational age at birth, birth weight, presence of
pregnancy or labor complications, maternal age, maternal ethnicity, and maternal education level. Each infant could contribute
up to 2 data points for mean reaction time at each age, one for the baseline sequence and one for the postbaseline alternating
sequence. The choline intake group effect is significant at P = 0.03. Lines represent least-squares linear-regression estimates and

supplement occurred in the laboratory under the su-
pervision of study personnel, thus ensuring that the two
groups differed substantially in choline intake during
the treatment period. In the 2 previous studies in this
area, there was no control of dietary choline intake and
adherence to the choline supplementation was inferred
only from pill counts and other indirect measures of
adherence (26, 27). A third factor that may have in-
creased our ability to detect a cognitive benefit was our
use of choline chloride as the supplemental form of the
nutrient. Research with rodents has shown superior
bioavailability of choline chloride to the brain, as com-
pared to phosphatidylcholine, the supplement used in
the two prior human studies (48). An additional
strength of our study was the successful randomization,
researcher and participant blinding, and the use of
intention-to-treat analyses. Moreover, the longitudinal

choline/d. A) Data points are predicted values of mean saccade reaction time for all ages combined (estimated at the mean age
of 8.05 mo) from the a priori mixed-effects regression model, adjusted for days of maternal third-trimester intake of choline at 480
mg/d, the natural logarithm of infant age at testing, gestational age at birth, birth weight, presence of pregnancy or labor
complications, maternal age, maternal ethnicity, and maternal education level. Each infant could contribute up to 2 data points
for mean reaction time at each age, one for the baseline sequence and one for the postbaseline alternating sequence. The simple
slope estimate for the effect of days of third-trimester maternal choline intake at 480 mg choline/d is 22.25 (SE = 0.64, P , 0.001)
and is represented by the least-squares fitted line. The shading represents the 95% confidence limit for the slope estimate. B) The
same relationship estimated separately for each assessment age (4, 7, 10, and 13 mo), illustrating the consistency of the effect of
days of choline intake within each assessment age. The reduced range for the abscissa in the plot of 4-mo data is due to missing
data, at that age only, for the participant with the longest duration of prenatal exposure.

 design of our study provided us with multiple assess-
ments of infant information processing speed, enabling
us to show consistency of the choline intake effect from
4 independent assessments that span the entire first
year of postnatal life. A final strength is that we used
infant reaction time as an outcome. Reaction time mea-
sures a central dimension of infant information pro-
cessing and has been shown to predict cognitive
performance later in life (31, 32).
There are several limitations of the present study.
First, the small sample size, although sufficient for our
stated hypotheses, limits generalizability of the find-
ings. Second, the use of only 1 paradigm to assess
effects of maternal choline intake on infant cognition
limits conclusions about the specificity of the cognitive
benefits. In addition, the lack of cognitive assessments
extending beyond infancy precludes determination of
the longevity of the benefits of maternal choline sup-
plementation we observed during the first postnatal
year. A final limitation is that the choline supplemen-
tation was implemented during only the final trimester
of pregnancy, making it impossible to predict the ef-
fects of a longer period of supplementation.
In summary, choline supplementation of the diet
among women in their third trimester of pregnancy, at a
level exceedingthecurrent AI,improvedinfant processing
speed relative to maternal consumption of the AI. This
finding suggests that the current AI level for choline dur-
ing pregnancy may need to be increased for improved
offspring cognitive functioning. In addition, our results
provide evidence that maternal consumption of the AI of
choline during this period also produces benefits relative
to typical choline intake among pregnant women. If the
benefits we report are lasting and are enabled through
improved brain structure and function, as has been shown
in the rodent studies, then increasing maternal choline
intake could be a nutritional strategy for improving off-
spring cognition throughout life.Longitudinalstudies that
extendbeyondinfancyandincorporate multiplemeasures
of cognition are needed to further explore this question in
humans. Although the effects of increased maternal cho-
line intake are expected to be small at an individual level,
they are anticipated to be substantial at a societal level,
including population-wide improvements in cognitive
function (15) and reduced incidence of aging-related cog-
nitive decline (49–51).
