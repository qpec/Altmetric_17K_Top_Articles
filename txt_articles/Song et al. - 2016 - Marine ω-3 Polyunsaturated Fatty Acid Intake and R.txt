Abstract
Importance—Marine ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs; including eicosapentaenoic acid, 
docosahexaenoic acid, and docosapentaenoic acid) possess potent immunomodulatory activity and 
may protect against cancer development. However, evidence relating marine ω-3 PUFAs to 
colorectal cancer risk remains inconclusive.
Objective—To test the hypothesis that marine ω-3 PUFA intake may be associated with lower 
risk of colorectal cancer subsets characterized by immune infiltrate.
Design—Prospective cohort study
Setting—Nurses' Health Study (1984-2010) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study 
(1986-2010)
Participants—Among 173,229 predominantly white participants, 125,172 provided data about 
marine ω-3 PUFA intake every 4 years through a validated food frequency questionnaire and 
followed up for incident colorectal cancer. We documented 614 colorectal cancer cases from 
which we could assess T-cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment. Cause-specific Cox 
proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios for risks of colorectal cancer 
subtypes.
Exposure—Intake of marine ω-3 PUFAs
Main Outcome and Measures—Incidence of colorectal cancer according to CD3+, CD8+, 
CD45RO (PTPRC)+, or FOXP3+ T-cell densities in tumor tissue, measured by 
immunohistochemistry and computer-assisted image analysis.
Results—The inverse association of marine ω-3 PUFAs with colorectal cancer risk differed 
according to FOXP3+ T-cell infiltration (P for heterogeneity = 0.006). Compared to intake of 
<0.15 g/day of marine ω-3 PUFAs, intake of ≥0.35 g/day was associated with a multivariable 
hazard ratio of 0.57 (95% confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.81) (P for trend < 0.001) for FOXP3+ T-
cell-high tumors. In contrast, the corresponding hazard ratio was 1.14 (95% confidence interval,

 0.81 to 1.60) (P for trend = 0.77) for FOXP3+ T-cell-low tumors. No statistically significant 
differential association was found according to CD3+, CD8+, or CD45RO+ cell density (P for 
heterogeneity ≥ 0.34). In functional assays, the suppressive activity of regulatory T cells was 
approximately two-fold lower when pre-incubated with docosahexaenoic acid at 50, 100 and 200 
μM than without docosahexaenoic acid (P<0.0001).
Conclusion and Relevance—High marine ω-3 PUFA intake was associated with lower risk of 
colorectal cancer with high-level, but not low-level, FOXP3+ T-cell density, suggesting a potential 
role of ω-3 PUFAs in cancer immunoprevention through modulation of regulatory T cells.
Introduction
Substantial experimental evidence demonstrates that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids 
(ω-3 PUFAs), namely eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 
docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), exert potent anti-inflammatory effects and protect against the 
development of colorectal cancer (CRC).1 However, human data relating ω-3 PUFA intake 
to CRC risk remain inconclusive, with a null association reported in all2-10 but one11 
prospective study. Recently, we found that the inverse association between intake of marine 
ω-3 PUFAs and CRC was confined to the 10-15% of tumors with high microsatellite 
instability (MSI)12 caused by loss of DNA mismatch repair activity.13 These data suggest 
that the anticancer effects of ω-3 PUFAs may vary by tumor subtypes, and require further 
characterization. Understanding the mechanisms underlying such differential benefits may 
lead to more effective precision medicine-based chemopreventive strategies.
The multifaceted roles of marine ω-3 PUFAs in immune regulation have long been 
recognized, including suppression of T-cell proliferation and promotion of CD4+ T helper 
type 1 (Th1) cell differentiation.14 Likewise, growing evidence indicates that immune cells 
in the tumor microenvironment play an active role in cancer evolution.15 A greater 
lymphocytic reaction to CRC has been associated with better prognosis,16,17 whereas 
regulatory T (Treg) cells with prerequisite expression of the transcription factor FOXP3 may 
be supportive to cancer development by reducing the host antitumor immune responses.18-20 
Moreover, the immune microenvironment of cancer is uniquely associated with tumor 
molecular features.15 For example, MSI-high CRC is characterized by high infiltration of 
activated Th1 cells and altered expression of immunomodulatory and immune checkpoint 
genes.21-24
Taken together, these data suggest that marine ω-3 PUFAs may exert an antitumor effect 
through their immunomodulatory activity, and that our previous observations demonstrating 
a predominant benefit of high marine ω-3 PUFA intake on MSI-high tumor development 
may be due to differences in tumor-infiltrating immune cells associated with MSI status. 
Hence, we hypothesized that the inverse association of marine ω-3 PUFA intake with CRC 
might be stronger for certain immune-subtypes of tumors. To test this hypothesis, we 
classified CRC cases according to the density of T cells in the tumor microenvironment, and 
investigated whether the association of prediagnostic marine ω-3 PUFA intake with CRC 
differed by these subtypes. We then corroborated our findings with experimental studies to 
examine the mechanisms by which marine ω-3 PUFAs influence T-cell function.

 Methods
Study population
Details about the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) (started in 1976, n=121,700 women aged 
30-55 years) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) (initiated in 1986, n=51,529 
men aged 40-75 years) cohorts have been described elsewhere.25,26 Briefly, participants 
completed a detailed questionnaire about their medical history and lifestyle at baseline, and 
every two years thereafter. The response rates have been 95.4% in the NHS and 95.9% in the 
HPFS for each of the questionnaires though 2010. Dietary data were collected and updated 
using the food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) every four years. In the present analysis, we 
used 1984 for the NHS and 1986 for the HPFS as baseline, when we first collected detailed 
data on ω-3 PUFA intake. Among 81,761 women and 49,938 men who returned the baseline 
FFQ, we excluded 4,454 women and 1,997 men who had a history of cancer at baseline and 
59 women and 17 women who left more than 70 blank responses on the baseline FFQ, had 
missing information about marine ω-3 PUFA intake, or reported implausible energy intake 
(<600 or >3500 kcal/day for women, <800 or >4200 kcal/day for men). After exclusions, 
77,248 women and 47,924 men were eligible for analysis. We obtained informed consent 
from all participants. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Brigham 
and Women's Hospital and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Assessment of marine ω-3 PUFA intake
Detailed description of ω-3 PUFA assessment is provided in the eSupplement.10,27 In each 
FFQ, we asked participants how often, on average, they consumed each food of a standard 
portion size during the previous year. We calculated the average daily intake for each 
nutrient by multiplying the reported frequency of consumption of each item by its nutrient 
content and then summing across from all foods. We adjusted nutrient intake for total caloric 
intake using the nutrient residual method.28 Marine ω-3 PUFA intake was calculated by 
summing EPA, DHA and DPA consumption. Use of fish oil supplement was also assessed 
and included in the estimation of marine ω-3 PUFA intake. To estimate long-term habitual 
consumption, we calculated the cumulative average of marine ω-3 PUFA intake during 
follow-up using all of the preceding dietary measures. FFQs have demonstrated good 
reproducibility and validity in assessing marine ω-3 PUFA intake,29,30 as described in the 
eSupplement.
Ascertainment of CRC cases
In both cohorts, cancer diagnoses were reported by participants on the biennial 
questionnaires. Deaths were reported by family members or the postal system, or identified 
through a search of the National Death Index. With consent from participants or next of kin, 
medical records were obtained and reviewed by study physicians, who were blinded to 
exposure information, to confirm CRC diagnosis and extract information on anatomic 
location, stage, and histologic type. We retrieved formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue 
blocks for immunity assessment from hospitals throughout the U.S. where participants had 
undergone surgical resection. Through 2010, we documented 1,488 CRC cases in the NHS 
and 1,016 cases in the HPFS. Tissue specimens were successfully collected and assayed for 
T-cell density measurements from 362 patients in the NHS and 252 patients in the HPFS.

 Tumor tissue analyses
Tissue microarrays were constructed to assess the density of CD3+, CD8+, CD45RO 
(PTPRC)+, and FOXP3+ T cells in tumor tissue, as previously described.31-33 We used 
immunohistochemistry and an automated scanning microscope and Ariol image analysis 
system (Genetix, San Jose, CA) to calculate the average density (cells/mm2) of each T-cell 
marker in tissue microarray cores. We dichotomized cases based on the median density of 
each T-cell marker among all cases. MSI assessment methods34 are provided in the 
eSupplement.
In vitro T cell suppression assay
Colonic lamina propria Foxp3+ Treg cells were isolated from C57BL/6J wild-type mice bred 
and housed in microisolator cages in a barrier facility as previously described35 and pre-
incubated for 4h with different concentrations of DHA (cis-4,7,10,13,16,19-
docosahexaenoic acid) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in complete RPMI 1640 medium 
containing 0.5% BSA. DHA was removed by washing cells with RPMI medium containing 
1% FBS. We employed Cell-Trace™ (Cell-Trace Violet Cell Proliferation kit, Molecular 
Probes) to monitor distinct generation of proliferating cells by dye dilution in flow 
cytometry. Isolated CD4+IL2RA- T effector cells were incubated with Cell-Trace™ 
(5microM/mL) at 37°C for 20 min and washed with pre-warmed RPMI 1640 containing 5% 
FBS. DHA-treated Treg cells were cultured with Cell-Trace™ stained CD4+IL2RA- T 
effector (Teff) cells (Treg:Teff=1:4) in the presence of anti-CD3 antibody (5ug/ml) and anti-
CD28 antibody (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) (5ug/ml) in 96 well round plates for 48h at 
37°C. The proliferation percentage of Teff cells was analyzed by flow cytometry.36 More 
details about flow cytometry and cell sorting are provided in the eSupplement. Experiments 
employing mice were approved and carried out in accordance with Harvard Medical 
School's Standing Committee on Animals and the National Institutes of Health guidelines 
for animal use.
Statistical analysis
Our primary hypothesis testing was the heterogeneity test between the association of marine 
ω-3 PUFA intake with lymphocyte-rich CRC compared to that with lymphocyte-poor CRC. 
All other assessments, including evaluation of individual hazard ratio (HR) estimates, 
represented secondary analyses. More details about statistical analysis are provided in the 
eSupplement.
Participants were followed from the age at which the baseline questionnaire was returned 
until the age at the date of death, CRC diagnosis, loss to follow-up, or end of follow-up 
(June 1, 2010 for the NHS, January 31, 2010 for the HPFS), whichever came first. For 
overall CRC risk, we used a time-varying Cox proportional hazards regression model to 
estimate HR and 95% confidence interval (CI) associated with marine ω-3 PUFA intake. We 
first performed the analyses in each cohort separately. Because no appreciable difference 
was detected by cohort (P for heterogeneity=0.13), we then conducted a pooled analysis in 
the combined cohort.

 For subtype-specific CRC risk, we fitted a cause-specific Cox proportional hazards 
regression model with a duplication method for competing risk data to compute HR and 
95% CI.37,38 A heterogeneity test was performed using a likelihood ratio test, by comparing 
the model in which the association with marine ω-3 PUFAs was allowed to vary by tumor 
subtypes to a model in which all the associations were held constant. We stratified all 
analyses by age, sex, and year of questionnaire return. We conducted the multivariable 
analysis by adjusting for several risk factors of CRC (see footnote of Table 2). Details about 
covariate assessment are provided in the eSupplement.
Results
Characteristics of study participants
Among 125,172 participants with 2,895,704 person-years of follow-up, we documented 
2,504 CRC cases, of which 614 cases had available tissue and data of T-cell density in tumor 
tissue. As shown in Table 1, participants with higher marine ω-3 PUFA intake were less 
likely to be current smokers and were more likely to engage in physical activity, undergo 
endoscopy, use multivitamins, and consumed a healthy diet.
Association of marine ω-3 PUFAs with CRC according to tumor-infiltrating T-cell density
Consistent with our previous report,10 marine ω-3 PUFA intake was not statistically 
significantly associated with CRC risk after adjusting for other risk factors (P for 
trend=0.07, Table 2), with a HR (95% CI) of 0.85 (0.67 to 1.09) comparing participants with 
≥0.35-g/day intake to those with <0.15-g/day intake. Similar results were observed among 
cases without tumor immunity data (eTable 1). We then classified CRC cases into subtypes 
with low-level versus high-level infiltrate of each of the four T-cell markers and tested our 
primary hypothesis that the association between marine ω-3 PUFAs and CRC risk differed 
according to T-cell densities in tumor tissues. To account for multiple-hypothesis testing, we 
adjusted the statistical significance level to α=0.012 (≈0.05/4). We found that the beneficial 
association of high marine ω-3 PUFA intake appeared confined to cancers with high 
infiltration of FOXP3+ T cells (P for heterogeneity = 0.006). Compared to intake of <0.15 
g/day of marine ω-3 PUFAs, intake of ≥0.35 g/day was associated with a multivariable HR 
of 0.57 (95% CI, 0.40 to 0.81) (P for trend<0.001) for FOXP3+ T-cell-high tumors. In 
contrast, the corresponding HR was 1.14 (95% CI, 0.81 to 1.60) (P for trend=0.77) for 
FOXP3+ T-cell-low tumors. Similar heterogeneity was observed for each individual PUFA 
(EPA, DHA and DPA, eTable 2). We did not observe statistically significant heterogeneity 
for tumors classified by CD3+, CD8+, or CD45RO+ cells (P for heterogeneity=0.34, 0.90 
and 0.73, respectively). We obtained similar results from analyses conducted within each 
cohort separately (eTables 3-4). We assessed the dose-response relationship using spline 
analysis and found that marine ω-3 PUFA intake appeared linearly associated with lower 
risk of FOXP3+ T-cell-high cancer (P=0.001), but not with FOXP3+ T-cell-low cancer 
(P=0.58). (eFigure 1)
In secondary analyses, given our previous finding that marine ω-3 PUFA intake was 
inversely associated with MSI-high CRC but not MSS cancer,12 we further classified tumors 
into four subtypes jointly according to FOXP3+ T-cell infiltration and MSI status. As shown

 in Table 3, high marine ω-3 PUFA intake appeared to be associated with lower risk of 
FOXP3+ T-cell-high tumors regardless of MSI status, although the number of MSI-high 
cases was limited. By comparing T-cell density between MSS and MSI-high tumors, we 
found that CD45RO+ and FOXP3+ T cells were more enriched in MSI-high than MSS 
tumors31 (eTable 5).
Marine ω-3 PUFAs decrease the T-cell suppressive activity of Treg cells
Finally, to investigate the effects of marine ω-3 PUFAs on the T-cell suppressive activity of 
Foxp3+ Treg cells, we assessed T-cell proliferation by using colonic Treg cells pre-incubated 
with different concentrations of DHA. We observed that DHA decreased the suppressive 
capacity of colonic Treg cells on naïve CD4+ Teff-cell proliferation in a dose-dependent 
manner (Figure 1). The suppressive activity of Treg cells pre-incubated with DHA at 50, 100 
and 200 μM was approximately two-fold lower than Treg cells pre-incubated without DHA 
(P<0.0001).
Discussion
In two large prospective cohorts, we found that high intake of marine ω-3 PUFAs was 
associated with lower risk of FOXP3+ T-cell-high CRC, but not associated with FOXP3+ T-
cell-low CRC. This differential association appeared to be independent of MSI status. 
Consistent with these epidemiologic findings, our in vitro experiment showed that marine 
ω-3 PUFA DHA reduced the T-cell suppressive activity of colonic Treg cells. Taken 
together, these data support an antitumor effect of marine ω-3 PUFAs on CRC that is, at 
least in part, mediated through immune modulation of Treg cells.
Despite compelling experimental evidence supporting an anti-inflammatory and anti-
neoplastic effect of marine ω-3 PUFAs, human studies have generally not shown a strong 
association between high intake of marine ω-3 PUFAs and lower CRC risk.2-10 If marine 
ω-3 PUFA intake indeed lowers CRC risk, identifying a specific tumor subtype that is 
prevented by marine ω-3 PUFAs can yield more precise risk reduction, and may lead to an 
effective prevention strategy against such a tumor subtype.39 Recent studies suggest that 
marine ω-3 PUFAs are predominantly associated with risk of proximal colon cancer.8,10 Our 
recent molecular pathological epidemiology study39 showed that high marine ω-3 PUFA 
intake was primarily associated with lower risk of MSI-high tumors, which predominantly 
arise from the proximal colon, and thus provided a potential explanation for the previously 
reported subsite heterogeneity.12 However, a mechanistic explanation for this differential 
association with MSI-high CRC was unclear. Therefore, our current results substantially 
extend upon previous findings and provide novel evidence by demonstrating that immune 
modulation may be a potential mechanism linking marine ω-3 PUFAs to lower CRC risk.
The colon is constantly exposed to a variety of environmental antigens from foods, resident 
microbiota and pathogens, underscoring the critical importance of the intestinal immune 
system in maintaining a delicate balance between immunity and tolerance.40 Perturbations 
of this immune homeostasis can result in chronic inflammation that can in turn increase 
cancer risk.40 Gut Treg cells tune Teff immune responses, modulate the basal inflammatory 
tone of the intestine and reset appropriate immune responses for the critical maintenance of

 intestinal homeostasis.41 Although FOXP3+ Treg cells can dampen aberrant immune 
responses against the resident gut microbiota or harmless dietary antigens, they may also 
suppress antitumor immune surveillance and facilitate cancer evasion.19,42 Indeed, a high 
ratio of FOXP3+ Treg cells and CD3+ T cells has been shown to predict CRC risk.43 The 
number of FOXP3+ Treg cells is higher in human CRC than in surrounding unaffected 
mucosa,44-46 and an enhanced infiltration of FOXP3+ Treg cells has been detected in MSI-
high CRCs compared to MSS cancers.31,47 Moreover, in mouse models transient ablation of 
Foxp3+ Treg cells has been shown to decrease colorectal tumor burden through expansion of 
CD8+ T cells.18 Consistent with these data, a low density of FOXP3+ T cells with a high 
density of CD8+ T cells in CRC tissue has been associated with a favorable outcome in 
patients with CRC,48,49 although the independent effect of FOXP3+ Treg cells on CRC 
prognosis remains inconclusive.17
Marine ω-3 PUFAs exert immunomodulatory effects on T-cell proliferation and apoptosis.50 
In this study, we found that DHA decreased the suppressive functions of colonic Treg cells 
on Teff-cell proliferation. These results are consistent with previous reports that a DHA-
enriched diet curtails the suppressive activity of murine splenic Treg cells.36 Collectively, 
these data support the hypothesis that marine ω-3 PUFAs protect against CRC through 
inhibition of the T-cell-suppressive activity of Treg cells and therefore suggest the possibility 
of a strategy in which marine ω-3 PUFAs are used to blunt immunosuppressive Treg cells 
for the purpose of CRC prevention.51
Our study has several strengths, including the prospective design, repeated dietary 
assessment, long-term follow-up, and collection of detailed data on a variety of lifestyle risk 
factors for confounding control. Uniquely, our characterization of immune cells in tumor 
tissue enabled us to identify the specific cancer subtype that can be potentially prevented by 
intervention. Finally, our in vitro experiments provide a mechanistic correlate for our human 
data to support a causal basis for our observations.
The limitations of our study should also be noted. First, dietary assessment using FFQ is 
subject to measurement error. However, given the prospective design, any measurement error 
in ω-3 PUFA intake would have likely biased the observed associations toward the null, and 
would be unlikely to explain the differential associations observed between subtypes of 
CRC. Second, despite our best efforts, we did not obtain tumor specimens from many 
patients for immunity evaluation. This is owing to the fact that we began retrieving tumor 
specimens in 1997 in the HPFS and in 2001 in the NHS. For many cases diagnosed earlier in 
follow-up, sufficient archived tumor tissue was not available for analysis. However, for this 
to lead to any bias in our main results, tissue availability would need to be associated with 
both cancer subtype and marine ω-3 PUFA intake-related CRC risk, which is unlikely. 
Indeed, as shown in eTable 1, we observed similar associations between marine ω-3 PUFA 
intake and CRC risk regardless of tissue availability, suggesting that lack of tissue data in 
some participants is unlikely to cause substantial bias. Third, we are aware of multiple-
hypothesis testing which is inherent in tumor subgroup analyses. Hence, we set subtype 
heterogeneity assessment (rather than evaluation of each subtype stratum) as our primary 
hypothesis testing, and adjusted statistical significance level by Bonferroni correction.

 Finally, due to sparse data, some of the HRs were estimated with limited precision and 
should be interpreted cautiously.
In summary, we have shown that marine ω-3 PUFA intake is associated with lower risk of 
CRC that arises in the immune microenvironment with high, but not low, infiltration of 
FOXP3+ T cells. High DHA reduces the T-cell-suppressive activity of Treg cells in the in 
vitro model. Our data provide evidence that the anticancer effect of marine ω-3 PUFAs may 
be mediated through enhancing the immune response against cancer via modulation of 
FOXP3+ Treg cells. Further studies are needed to determine the potential utility of marine 
ω-3 PUFAs as an immunomodulatory agent for CRC prevention.

Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reduces the suppressive activity of colonic Treg cells. Colonic 
Treg cells were isolated and pre-incubated with different concentration of DHA for 4h. Cell-
Trace ™ stained CD4+IL2RA- Teff cells were coincubated for 48h with DHA-treated Treg 
cells. Representative flow cytometric analyses of Teff cell proliferation are shown in the 
upper panel. Bar graph in the lower panel shows mean ± SEM of two independent 
experiments. ***P<0.0001 (unpaired, two-tailed student's t test)

*Trend test was performed using the median intake of each category.
†Likelihood ratio test was used to compare the model that allows for separate associations for tumors with different subtypes to the model that assumes a common association across subtypes.
‡Cases without tumor-infiltrating T-cell data were excluded. A few cases with missing data on specific T-cell subsets were excluded for analyses of individual T cells: 11 for CD3+ cells; 22 for CD8+ cells; 
and 30 for FOXP3+ cells.
