ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Recent studies have cast doubt on the benefit of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with defi-
brillation (CRT-D) versus pacing (CRT-P) for patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). Left ventricular
myocardial scar portends poor clinical outcomes.
OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to determine whether CRT-D is superior to CRT-P in patients with NICM either
with (þ) or without (�) left ventricular midwall fibrosis (MWF), detected by cardiac magnetic resonance.
METHODS Clinical events were quantified in patients with NICM who were þMWF (n ¼ 68) or �MWF (n ¼ 184) who
underwent cardiac magnetic resonance prior to CRT device implantation.
RESULTS In the total study population, þMWF emerged as an independent predictor of total mortality (adjusted hazard
ratio [aHR]: 2.31; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.45 to 3.68), total mortality or heart failure hospitalization (aHR: 2.02;
95% CI: 1.32 to 3.09), total mortality or hospitalization for major adverse cardiac events (aHR: 2.02; 95% CI: 1.32 to
3.07), death from pump failure (aHR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.11 to 3.41), and sudden cardiac death (aHR: 3.75; 95% CI: 1.26 to
11.2) over a maximum follow-up period of 14 years (median 3.8 years [interquartile range: 2.0 to 6.1 years] for þMWF and
4.6 years [interquartile range: 2.4 to 8.3 years] for �MWF). In separate analyses of þMWF and �MWF, total mortality
(aHR: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.75), total mortality or heart failure hospitalization (aHR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.82), and
total mortality or hospitalization for major adverse cardiac events (aHR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.78) were lower after
CRT-D than after CRT-P in þMWF but not in �MWF.
CONCLUSIONS In patients with NICM, CRT-D was superior to CRT-P in þMWF but not �MWF. These findings
have implications for the choice of device therapy in patients with NICM. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2017;70:1216–27)

ardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a
standard treatment for patients with heart
failure (HF), impaired left ventricular (LV)
systolic function, and a prolonged QRS duration
(1,2). Although CRT-pacing (CRT-P) prevents pump
failure by correcting LV dyssynchrony, the addition
of defibrillation (CRT-D) leads to a greater treatment
effect by preventing sudden cardiac death (SCD)
from ventricular arrhythmias (2,3).
It is well recognized that the clinical outcome of
CRT is influenced by the underlying etiology of HF.
Nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) is associated
with a better LV reverse remodeling response (4) and
better clinical outcomes after CRT (5). Because NICM

 is associated with a lower background risk for ven-
tricular arrhythmias than ischemic cardiomyopathy,
the benefit of CRT-D over CRT-P has been questioned.
In this respect, most of the evidence in favor of
defibrillation in patients with NICM comes from
studies evaluating patients with single- or dual-
chamber
implantable
cardioverter-defibrillators
(ICD)
rather
than
CRT-D
devices.
Both
CAT
(Cardiomyopathy Trial) (6) and AMIOVIRT (Amiodar-
one
Versus
Implantable
Cardioverter-Defibrillator
Trial) (7) used single- and dual-chamber ICDs, but
neither trial showed any survival benefit from ICDs in
patients
with
NICM.
Importantly,
these
studies
involved small numbers of patients (each about 100).
In the DEFINITE (Defibrillators in Non-Ischemic Car-
diomyopathy Treatment Evaluation) study (8), in
which 458 patients with NICM were randomized to
medical therapy or a single-chamber ICD, ICD therapy
did not reduce total mortality, despite a significant
reduction in SCD. A subgroup analysis of SCD-HeFT
(Sudden
Cardiac
Death
in
Heart
Failure
Trial),
including patients with NICM, also failed to show a
significant reduction in mortality from ICD therapy
(9). In the recent DANISH (Defibrillator Implantation
in Patients With Nonischemic Systolic Heart Failure)
study, ICDs did not reduce total mortality in patients
with NICM (10). These studies cast doubt on the
relative benefit of CRT-D versus CRT-P in patients
with NICM.
All clinical outcome
studies of
ICDs
in NICM
(6–9,11), including DANISH (10), have defined NICM
on the basis of findings from echocardiography, cor-
onary angiography, and/or nuclear imaging. These
imaging modalities, however, do not provide tissue
characterization. In this regard, LV midwall fibrosis
(MWF) is a specific form of myocardial scar found in
approximately 30% of patients with NICM (Figure 1).
It is now recognized that MWF, detected using car-
diac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, portends a
poor outcome in the general NICM population (12–15)
and in CRT-P recipients (16). Increasing evidence
supports a link between MWF and ventricular ar-
rhythmias (12–14,17). On this basis, we hypothesized
that the relative benefit of CRT-D over CRT-P is
influenced by MWF.
METHODS
Patients were recruited from 2 centers (Good Hope
Hospital and Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham,
United Kingdom). All patients underwent successful
CRT device implantation and pre-implantation CMR
from July 2002 to January 2017. Some pa-
tients were included in a previous study (16).
The present study extended to a larger group
and a longer follow-up period.
The diagnosis of HF was made on the basis
of clinical features plus echocardiographic
evidence of LV systolic dysfunction. The
diagnosis of NICM was made if LV dysfunc-
tion was associated with either no myocardial
scar or with MWF (14). Exclusion criteria
included a history of myocardial infarction,
coronary revascularization, or diagnosis of
ischemic cardiomyopathy on the basis of
other investigations (e.g., nuclear imaging);
ischemic pattern of scar on CMR; a diagnosis
of hypertrophic or restrictive cardiomyopa-
thy, primary valvular disease, sarcoidosis,
amyloidosis, or myocarditis made on the
basis of CMR or another investigation (e.g.,
echocardiography,
cardiac
biopsy,
and/or
positron emission tomography); and NICM
and scar patterns other than MWF (patchy or
subepicardial). The study was approved by
the local ethics committee or the local clinical
audit departments and conformed with the
Declaration of Helsinki.
DEVICE THERAPY. In the United Kingdom,
the National Institute of Clinical Excellence guide-
lines in 2007 recommended CRT-P rather than CRT-D
for patients with NICM and indications for CRT. With
a subsequent guideline change in 2014 recommend-
ing CRT-D for NICM (18), the proportion of CRT-D
recipients increased thereafter.
Device implantation was undertaken using stan-
dard transvenous techniques under local anesthesia
and
intravenous
sedation.
After
implantation,
patients were followed at dedicated device therapy
clinics. Before 2013, patients in sinus rhythm under-
went transmitral Doppler-directed optimization of
atrioventricular delay using an iterative technique
prior
to
discharge
and
at
every
scheduled
visit
thereafter.
After
2013,
routine
echocardiographic
optimization was abandoned and undertaken only in
the
case
of
symptomatic
nonresponders.
Backup
atrial pacing was set at 60 beats/min, and the pacing
mode was set to DDDR with an interventricular delay
of 0 to 4 ms, according to manufacturer instructions.
In the case of patients in permanent atrial fibrillation,
right ventricular and LV leads were implanted and a
CRT generator was used, plugging the atrial port
and programming to a ventricular triggered mode.
Atrioventricular junction ablation was undertaken
according to physicians’ decision.

 CMR IMAGING. CMR imaging was performed using
1.5-T scanners and a phased-array cardiac coil. A
short-axis LV stack was acquired using a steady-state
free precession sequence (repetition time 3.0 to
3.8 ms, excitation time 1.0 ms, image matrix 224 �
224, field of view 36 to 42 cm, flip angle 45�) in
sequential 8-mm slices (2-mm interslice gap) from the
atrioventricular ring to apex. Acquisition was per-
formed during gated 8-s breath-holds (20 phases).
Quantification of LV volumes was undertaken using
semiautomatic manual planimetry of all short-axis,
steady-state free precession sequence cine images
with MASS (Medis, Leiden, the Netherlands) or Argus
(Siemens,
Erlangen,
Germany)
analysis
software.
Quantification of LV volumes and characterization of
myocardial scar were undertaken by investigators
certified by the British Society of Cardiovascular
Magnetic Resonance using a common protocol. These
investigators were blinded to echocardiographic and
clinical outcome data. A previous cardiac device im-
plantation (excluding loop recorders), end-stage renal
failure, and renal replacement therapy were adopted
as absolute contraindications to CMR.
Short-axis slices identical to the LV stack were
acquired
using
a
segmented
inversion
recovery
technique, 10 min after the intravenous administra-
tion
of
gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic
acid (0.1 mmol/kg). Inversion times were adjusted to
null normal myocardium (260 to 400 ms). Myocardial
scars were classified as subendocardial, midwall,
epicardial, transmural, or patchy (13). Scars in a sub-
endocardial or transmural distribution following cor-
onary artery territories were regarded as ischemic in
etiology, whereas midwall scars and absence of scar
were regarded as indicative of NICM. MWF was
considered present if the area of late gadolinium
enhancement was confined to intramural and/or sub-
epicardial layers in 2 orthogonal views (19). As in other
studies (12,14,16,17,20), we chose to use visual rather
than quantitative assessment of MWF to make our
findings clinically applicable without the need for scar
quantification.

 ENDPOINTS. The primary endpoint was total mor-
tality, which included cardiac transplantation or im-
plantation of a ventricular assist device. Secondary
endpoints included the composite endpoint of total
mortality or HF hospitalization and the composite
endpoint of total mortality or unplanned hospitali-
zation for major adverse cardiac events (MACEs).
These included hospitalization for HF, myocardial
infarction, acute coronary syndrome, and arrhythmia
(ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or
atrial fibrillation). Stroke and pulmonary embolism
were not regarded as MACEs. In composite endpoints,
the first event was included in the analysis. Mortality
data were collected through medical records and,
when
appropriate,
from
interviews
with
patient
caregivers.
Clinical
outcome
data
were
collected
every 6 months by investigators who were blinded to
clinical and imaging data. Also, events were adjudi-
cated by blinded investigators on a 6-month basis.
With respect to mode of death, a “natural, unex-
pected death due to cardiac causes, heralded by an
abrupt loss of consciousness within 1 h of the onset of
acute symptoms” (21) was regarded as an SCD. Death
from pump failure was defined as “death after a
period of clinical deterioration in signs and symptoms
of HF despite medical treatment” (22).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Continuous variables are
expressed as mean � SD. Normality was tested using
the Shapiro-Wilk test. Comparisons between nor-
mally distributed continuous variables were made
using analysis of variance. Categorical variables were
analyzed using chi-square tests. Kaplan-Meier curves
and the log-rank test were used to assess observed
cumulative survival. Cox proportional hazard models
were used to assess relative risks. Proportionality
hypotheses were verified by visual examination of log
(survival) graphs to ensure parallel slopes and by
examining Schoenfeld residuals. Variables reaching
p < 0.10 on univariate analyses were entered in
multivariate models, and further backward elimina-
tion was applied for the final multivariate models.
The predictive ability of MWF was assessed using
Harrell’s C statistic and Somers’s D statistic (23).
Interobserver and intraobserver agreement for the
presence of MWF was assessed using Cohen’s kappa
statistic. Statistical analyses were undertaken using
Stata version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).
A 2-sided p value #0.05 was considered to indicate
statistical significance.
RESULTS
In the total study population (n ¼ 252), 68 patients
(27%) had MWF. The þMWF and �MWF groups were
well matched for age, sex, device type, comorbidities,
atrial
rhythm,
QRS
duration,
QRS
morphology,
medication, and echocardiographic LV ejection frac-
tion (Table 1). The þMWF group had more New York
Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I, II, and IV
patients but fewer NYHA functional class III patients
than the �MWF group (p ¼ 0.031).
MWF AND OUTCOMES. Total mortality was 29 of 68
(42.6%) in the þMWF cohort and 63 of 184 (34.2%) in
the �MWF arm, amounting to annualized rates of
12.8% for þMWF and 6.86% for �MWF. Cardiac
mortality was 27 of 68 (39.7%) and 43 of 184 (23.4%)
for the þMWF and �MWF groups, respectively. Over
a maximum follow-up period of 14 years (median

for þMWF and 4.6 years [IQR: 2.4 to 8.3 years]
for �MWF; p ¼ 0.525), þMWF was associated with
higher total mortality in Kaplan-Meier survival ana-
lyses (log-rank p ¼ 0.006) (Figure 2). Univariate Cox
proportional hazards analyses are shown in Table 2.
In multivariate analyses (Table 3), þMWF was asso-
ciated with higher total mortality (adjusted hazard
ratio [aHR]: 2.31; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.45 to
3.68), independent of age, NYHA class, CRT type,
hypertension,
and atrial rhythm. Other
potential
confounders did not reach significance in multivar-
iate models. The C statistic for the multivariate model
to predict total mortality was 0.68 without inclusion
of MWF status and 0.70 with inclusion of MWF status;
Somers’s D was 0.36 and 0.40, respectively. Although
follow-up
times
were
different
between
the
implanting centers (Good Hope Hospital, 10.7 years
[IQR: 8.7 to 12.8 years]; Queen Elizabeth Hospital,
3.2 years [IQR: 2.0 to 5.3 years]; p < 0.001), implanting
center did not emerge as a predictor of any endpoint
in univariate analyses (data not shown).
Total mortality or HF hospitalization was 34 of 68
(50%) in þMWF and 76 of 184 (41.3%) in �MWF,
amounting to annualized rates of 16.9% for þMWF
and
9.2%
for
�MWF.
In
Kaplan-Meier
survival
analyses, þMWF was associated with higher total
mortality or HF hospitalization (log-rank p ¼ 0.005)
(Figure

In
multivariate
analyses,
þMWF
was
associated with higher total mortality or HF hospi-
talization (aHR: 2.02; 95% CI: 1.32 to 3.09), indepen-
dent of age, NYHA functional class, hypertension, and
left bundle branch block. Other potential confounders
did not reach significance in multivariate models.
Total mortality or hospitalization for MACE was 35
of 68 (51%) in þMWF and 81 of 184 (44%) in �MWF,
amounting to annualized rates of 17.6% for þMWF
and
9.9%
for
�MWF.
In
Kaplan-Meier
survival
analyses, þMWF was associated with lower survival
(log-rank
p
¼ 0.009)
(Figure

In
multivariate
analyses, þMWF was associated with higher total
mortality or hospitalization for MACE (aHR: 2.02;
95% CI: 1.32 to 3.07), independent of age, NYHA
class, CRT type, and diabetes. Other potential con-
founders did not reach significance in multivariate
models.
With respect to mode of death, this was unknown

MWF AND DEVICE TYPE. In univariate (Table 2) and
multivariate (Table 3) analyses of the total popula-
tion, CRT-D was superior to CRT-P with respect to
total mortality (aHR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.77) and
total mortality and hospitalization for MACEs (aHR:
0.51; 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.97) but not total mortality or
HF hospitalization. A significant interaction between
MWF and device type was found (likelihood-ratio
test comparing models with and without MWF status
and device type yielded a p value of 0.007). In
separate analyses of the þMWF and �MWF groups
(Figure 5, Online Table 2), CRT-D was associated with
lower total mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.23; 95% CI:

 In order to exclude a possible time-related bias, we
first explored whether date of implantation emerged
as a predictor of total mortality in univariate Cox
proportional hazards analysis, but no significant ef-
fect was found (data not shown). We also split our
sample in 3 time periods, corresponding to changes in
U.K. national guidelines for CRT. In this analysis, no
difference in total mortality between CRT-D and CRT-
P
emerged between
the
time
periods (HR:
0.70
[95% CI: 0.44 to 1.10] for 2007 to 2013; HR: 0.46 [95%
CI: 0.20 to 1.06] for 2014 to 2017) compared with 2002
to 2006.
Interobserver and intraobserver agreement for the
presence of MWF on 30 randomized scans for 2 ob-
servers, in terms of Cohen’s kappa, was 0.84 (95% CI:
0.51
to
0.96)
and
0.92
(95%
CI:
0.60
to
0.99),
respectively.
DISCUSSION
This is the first study to compare clinical outcomes
after
CRT-D
and
CRT-P
in
patients
with
NICM,
categorized according to the presence or absence of
MWF,
identified
by
CMR.
Several
findings
have
emerged. First, in the total study population, CRT-D
was superior to CRT-P with respect to total mor-
tality and total mortality or MACE. Second, CRT-D
was markedly superior to CRT-P in terms of total
mortality,
cardiovascular
mortality,
and
all
com-
posite endpoints in þMWF, but no benefit from
CRT-D over CRT-P was observed in �MWF with
respect to any of the endpoints. Third, MWF inde-
pendently predicted total mortality as well as total
mortality
or
HF
hospitalization,
cardiovascular
mortality, and total mortality or MACEs. Fourth, the
association between MWF and total mortality was
linked to pump failure as well as SCD and hospi-
talization for ventricular arrhythmias. These find-
ings suggested that MWF is pivotal with respect to
the benefit of CRT-D over CRT-P in patients with
NICM (Central Illustration).
CRT-D VERSUS CRT-P IN NICM. Our findings have
emerged following the elegant DANISH study, in
which 1,116 patients were randomized to ICDs or
usual clinical care (control group) (10). After a median
follow-up period of 5.63 years, ICDs did not reduce
total mortality
(HR: 0.87; 95%
CI: 0.68 to 1.12;
p ¼ 0.28), despite a significant reduction in SCD
(HR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.82; p ¼ 0.005). We should
consider, however, that a meta-analysis undertaken
prior to DANISH showed that larger numbers of pa-
tients (at least 1,457) are needed to show a significant
effect of ICDs on total mortality in NICM (3). This was
also the case in recent meta-analyses that included

Although use of cardiac resynchronization therapy–defibrillation (CRT-D) was superior to cardiac resynchronization therapy–pacing (CRT-P) in the presence of midwall
fibrosis (MWF) for the primary and secondary endpoints, there was no significant difference between the devices in patients without MWF.

 DANISH (24–26). It is possible, therefore, that DANISH
was underpowered to show an effect of ICD therapy
on total mortality. In contrast, we found that CRT-D
was superior to CRT-P, even in a relatively small
sample of patients (n ¼ 252).
The contrasting findings of our comparison be-
tween CRT-D and CRT-P in the present study and
that of DANISH (10) may be due to differences in
study design and statistical power. In the present
study, all patients in the comparator group under-
went CRT, compared with only 58% in the control
group of DANISH. In addition, more patients in the
present study were in NYHA functional class III or IV
(57%) than in DANISH (46%). It is therefore not sur-
prising to see that total mortality in the present study
was higher (between 6.9 and 12.8 per 100 person-
years in �MWF and þMWF groups, respectively)
than in DANISH (between 4.4 and 5.0 per 100 person-
years in the ICD and control groups, respectively).
Similarly, cardiac mortality in the present study
(39.7% in þMWF and 23.4% in �MWF) was also
higher than in DANISH (“cardiovascular mortality” of
13.8% in the ICD group and 17% in the control group).
It would appear, therefore, that compared with pa-
tients in DANISH, patients in the present study were
“sicker,” and a greater proportion died from cardiac
causes.
In separate analyses of þMWF and �MWF, CRT-D
was superior to CRT-P in NICM þMWF. Even though
patient numbers were approximately 3 times higher
in the �MWF subgroup, no differences in outcomes
emerged between CRT-D and CRT-P. Admittedly, to-
tal mortality was lower in �MWF than in þMWF
(annualized rate of 6.9 vs. 12.8), raising the possibility
that larger numbers might be needed to show a
benefit from CRT-D over CRT-P in NICM �MWF.
Notwithstanding, our findings suggested that MWF
identifies a subpopulation of patients with NICM who
are more likely to benefit from CRT-D.
Our finding of a higher risk for pump failure deaths
and HF hospitalizations in þMWF was not unex-
pected. We have previously shown that MWF is
associated with a selective impairment of circumfer-
ential LV myocardial strain, apical rotation, and dia-
stolic
function
(27).
The
result
is
a
“stiff”
left
ventricle, which is less able to twist to an applied
torque (rotation) and more likely to move as a solid
body.
These
mechanical
disturbances
may
be
responsible for the known associations of MWF with
HF and the suboptimal response to medical and de-
vice therapy (12–14,16,17).
In the present study, we found that compared
with �MWF, þMWF was associated with a 3.75-fold
higher risk for SCD and a 2.6-fold higher risk for the
combined endpoint of SCD or hospitalization for
ventricular arrhythmias. These findings were consis-
tent with those of Wu et al. (28), using Langendorff
hearts, in which myocardial fibrosis was shown to
provide continuous re-entry. Clinical studies have
also shown that MWF is associated with an increased
risk
for
ventricular
arrhythmias
(12–14,17).
Other
studies supported the use of T1 mapping in predicting
ventricular arrhythmias in ICD recipients (29).
Physicians may refer to the DANISH study as a
basis for making decisions on the choice of device
therapy in patients with NICM. We should consider,
however, that DANISH did not use CMR for tissue
characterization of the underlying cardiomyopathy.
In the present study, we showed that NICM with
MWF behaves differently than NICM without MWF.
On this basis, MWF should be regarded as a “high-
risk feature” in patients with NICM and raises the
possibility that patients with MWF may derive a
clinical benefit from CRT-D over CRT-P.
STUDY
LIMITATIONS. This
study
has
the
typical
limitations of an observational study. Rather than by
study design, the choice of device therapy in pa-
tients with NICM was governed by U.K. guidelines,
which, prior to 2014, did not recommend CRT-D for
patients with NICM (18). Because we did not use
telemonitoring, we cannot clarify whether patients
who were coded as having died from pump failure
could have died from arrhythmic events. Impor-
tantly, this was an observational study, and any
parallels
or
discrepancies
with
randomized,
controlled
trials
should
be
interpreted
with
caution. We did not use quantification of myocardial
scar, but we cannot discount the possibility that
semiautomatic methods (30) may further improve

 risk stratification. Unfortunately, only 52 patients
underwent CRT implantation using a quadripolar
lead. Although we found no interaction between lead
type and outcomes, this might be due to statistical
underpowering. The lack of systematic, prospective
collection of device interrogation data might also
have led to an underestimation of the overall benefit
from CRT-D. Novel CMR techniques, such as map-
ping of border zone of scar and scar morphology,
which were not addressed in the present study,
might add to the risk stratification.
CONCLUSIONS
In
our
total
population
of
patients
with
CMR-
confirmed NICM, CRT-D was superior to CRT-P. This
benefit,
however,
was
evident
in
þMWF
but
not �MWF patients. In the total study population,
MWF emerged as an independent predictor of mor-
tality and morbidity in patients with NICM undergo-
ing CRT, a relationship that was mediated by pump
failure,
SCD,
and
ventricular
arrhythmias.
These
findings reinforce a tailored approach in the choice of

We sought to determine whether cardiac resynchronization therapy–defibrillation (CRT-D) was superior to cardiac resynchronization therapy–pacing
(CRT-P) in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) with or without midwall fibrosis. (A) Four-chamber and short-axis inversion recovery late
gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance images show midwall enhancement (yellow arrows) in the interventricular septum, typical of
midwall fibrosis. (B) Survival curves for patients with NICM demonstrated that CRT-D was superior to CRT-P for total mortality and the presence of
midwall fibrosis affected the likelihood of sudden cardiac death.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE AND
PROCEDURAL SKILLS: Patients with NICM who
have MWF detected by CMR face worse clinical out-
comes than those without MWF. Hence, patients with
MWF may benefit from devices with defibrillation
capability (CRT-D).
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Prospective trials
are needed to confirm the utility of CMR for detection
of MWF as a guide to selection of patients with NICM
for device-based therapies.
