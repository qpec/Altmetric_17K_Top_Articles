Abstract
Objectives—To determine whether subjective poor sleep prospectively increases functional 
limitations and incident disability in a national sample of adults living in the United States.
Design—Prospective cohort
Setting—Longitudinal Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS)
Participants—Young, middle aged, and older men and women (age 24–75) surveyed in 1995–
1996 (MIDUS 1) and followed up in 2004–2006 (MIDUS 2). Complete data were available for 
3,620 respondents.
Measurements—Data were from telephone interviews and self-administered questionnaires. 
Participant reported chronic sleep problems within the prior month; functional limitations were 
assessed using the Functional Status Questionnaire. Demographic (age, sex, race), socioeconomic 
(educational attainment), health (chronic conditions, depression), and health behavior (obesity, 
smoking) covariates were assessed to reduce potential confounding.
Results—Approximately 11% of the sample reported chronic sleep problems at both MIDUS 
waves. Average numbers of basic and intermediate ADL limitations increased significantly 
between MIDUS 1 (basic: .06; intermediate: .95) and MIDUS 2 (basic: .15; intermediate: 1.6; P<.
001). Adjusted regression models estimating change in ADL scores showed that chronic sleep 
problems at MIDUS 1 predicted significantly greater increases in both basic (incident rate ratio 
(IRR) = 1.55, P<.001) and intermediate (IRR = 1.28, P<.001) ADL limitations. In those with no 
functional limitations at baseline, logistic regression models showed that chronic sleep problems 
significantly increased the odds of incident basic (OR = 2.33, CI:1.68,3.24, P<.001) and 
intermediate (OR = 1.70, CI: 1.21,2.42, P<.01) ADL disability.

 Conclusion—Reports of chronic sleep problems predicted greater risk of both onset of and 
increases in functional limitations 9–10 years later. Poor sleep may be a robust and independent

INTRODUCTION
Disability rates in older adults have declined in recent years,1,2 due principally to medical 
and technological advances and to broad improvements in socioeconomic indicators, 
including poverty and educational attainment.3 Nonetheless, inability to perform daily 
activities remains common. Estimates from the National Health Interview Surveys and the 
National Long-Term Care Survey show that 15%–20% of adults over age 65 have at least 
one functional limitation.1,2 Further improvements in disability rates will largely rest on 
changes in lifestyle factors. Obesity4 and physical inactivity,5 for example, are robustly 
linked to increased risk of disability,1,6 and rates of both are high in aging adults; these 
factors threaten to slow or stall the downward trends in disability rates. Another lifestyle 
factor – sleep – has received relatively little attention as a predictor of disability, despite 
well-documented links between sleep problems and a range of adverse health outcomes, 
including mortality.7–10 This study examines the prospective associations between self-
reported sleep problems and activities of daily living (ADL) in a national sample of middle-
aged and older adults living in the United States.
Two lines of research converge on sleep as a compelling focus for understanding disability 
risk. First, sleep quality tends to decline with age. Objective assessments show significant 
age-related declines in sleep duration, sleep efficiency, rapid eye movement (REM), and 
stage 3/4 sleep coupled with significant increases in sleep latency and stage 1–2 sleep.11 
Subjective complaints of poor sleep also tend to increase with age.12,13 Second, both 
quantitative (e.g. number of hours slept per night) and qualitative (e.g. complaints of poor 
sleep) aspects of sleep are linked to morbidity and mortality in older adults.7,8,14 Subjective 
reports of impaired sleep, for example, significantly increased the risk of subsequent heart 
attack, stroke, and cardiac mortality in older men and women with primary acute myocardial 
infarction from the Stockholm Heart Epidemiology Program.14 A regional longitudinal 
study in Sweden found that sleep complaints at baseline predicted greater risk of coronary 
artery disease15 and diabetes16 in men 12 years later. Few studies have examined the 
prospective links between sleep complaints and disability. A recent study of 908 older 
Catholic clergy in the United States found that poor subjective sleep significantly increased 
risk of disability at follow-up 9.6 years later.17
The current study extends this earlier work by examining the prospective associations of 
sleep complaints and disability in a representative national sample of men and women in the 
US: the Survey of Mid-Life Development in the United States (MIDUS)18. We hypothesized 
that subjective report of sleep problems would increase the risk of both increases in 
functional limitations and incident disability in those with no functional impairments at

 baseline. The MIDUS sample is community dwelling, making the results applicable to the 
general adult population of the US. The broad age range of the MIDUS sample, spanning 5 
decades from mid-20s to mid-70s, also makes it possible to determine whether the links 
between poor sleep and functional impairment are limited to older adults or extend to mid-
life and younger adults as well. Finally, while the main analyses in this study involve self-
reported functional limitations, these are bolstered by supplemental analyses using objective 
assessments of functional status available for sub-samples of MIDUS participants.
METHODS
Participants
Data are from the first two waves of MIDUS, a longitudinal study of the physical and mental 
health of middle-aged and older adults.18 The first wave of data collection (MIDUS 1; N = 
7,108) included a national probability sample of non-institutionalized English-speaking 
adults living in the contiguous United States recruited by random digit dialing (RDD; n = 
3,487), a sample of monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs from a national twin registry (n = 
1,914), oversamples from five metropolitan areas (n = 757), and siblings of individuals from 
the RDD sample (n = 950). Respondents completed telephone interviews and self-
administered questionnaires (SAQ). A follow-up study was completed 9–10 years later 
(MIDUS 2). Mortality-adjusted retention from the original study was 75%. Complete data 
for the present analyses were available for 3,620 participants. Compared to the full 
longitudinal sample, the analytical sample had fewer female respondents, was better 
educated, and had fewer functional limitations at baseline; they were comparable on all other 
key variables. Collection of data for both waves of MIDUS and analyses for the current 
study were approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of Wisconsin-
Madison and Purdue University, respectively.
Measures
Sleep complaints were assessed using a single questionnaire item: “In the past 12 months, 
have you experienced or been treated for chronic sleeping problems?” A dichotomous 
variable was used in all models. Information on basic and intermediate activities of daily 
living came from the Functional Status Questionnaire.19 Respondents were asked how much 
health limited their ability to do a number of activities. Basic ADL limitations were 
determined from two items: “bathing or dressing yourself” and “walking one block.” 
Intermediate ADL limitations were determined from seven items: “lifting or carrying 
groceries,” “climbing several flights of stairs,” “bending, kneeling, or stooping,” “walking 
more than a mile,” “walking several blocks,” “vigorous activities (e.g., running, lifting heavy 
objects),” and “moderate activities (e.g., bowling, vacuuming).” Response ranged from 
1=Not at all to 4=A lot. To determine the number of activities for which respondents 
reported at least some degree of limitation, responses of “Some” or “A lot” of limitation 
were scored ‘1’ and other responses ‘0.’ Responses were then summed into separate scores 
for basic and intermediate ADLs with possible scores of 0–2 for basic and 0–7 for 
intermediate scales. Total scores at both MIDUS 1 and MIDUS 2 were calculated and used 
to examine changes in numbers of functional limitations over time. Dichotomous variables

 for presence or absence of any limitations were also created for logistic regression models 
estimating incident functional limitations between MIDUS 1 and MIDUS 2.
A set of demographic, socioeconomic, health, and health behavior covariates was included 
in all models to reduce the likelihood of confounding. These included age, sex, race, and 
educational attainment (dummy coded variables for high school degree or GED, some 
college, and college degree or more).
To assess health, a variable for 12 chronic medical conditions was used in all analyses. 
Information on 9 of these conditions came from participant responses to self-administered 
questionnaire items; participants were asked whether they had experienced or received 
treatment for any of the following conditions in the prior 12 months: chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), arthritis or other joint conditions, AIDS, hypertension, diabetes, 
tuberculosis, neurological disorders, stroke, ulcer. Presence of heart problems and cancer 
were determined from single items in the telephone interview. Participants were asked 
whether they had had heart trouble suspected or confirmed by a doctor and whether they had 
ever had cancer. Possible scores ranged from 0–12.
Variables for obesity and smoking were included to control for health behaviors. Body mass 
index (BMI) was calculated from participant measurement of height and weight and dummy 
coded variables for normal weight (BMI<24.99), overweight (BMI between 25.00 and 
29.99) and obese (BMI>=30.00) were created. Smoking status was assessed using dummy-
coded variables indicating non-smoker, ex-smoker, and current smoker.
Finally, as depressed individuals are more likely to report both poor sleep20 and greater 
functional impairment,21 likely depression was determined using the short form of the 
Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).22 Respondents were scored as 
positive for depressed affect if they indicated 1) that they felt sad, blue, or depressed and that 
“The feeling of being sad, blue, or depressed lasted ‘All day long’ or ‘Most of the day’ and 
2) that they felt this way “Everyday” or “Almost every day.” They were scored as positive 
for anhedonia if they reported a loss of interest in most things lasting “All day long” or 
“Most of the day” and that this feeling was “Everyday” or “Almost every day.” A 
dichotomous variable indicating likely clinical depression (i.e. positive scores for both 
depressed affect and anhedonia) was included in all models.
Statistical analyses
Longitudinal increases in ADL limitations were estimated in separate Poisson regression 
models. Poisson modeling was appropriate because the outcome measures (numbers of 
limitations) were counts rather than continuous variables. Incident rate ratios (IRR) 
comparing the rate of functional limitations in respondents with sleep problems to those 
without were determined; these are interpreted in a similar fashion as odds ratios. All models 
adjusted for age, sex, race, educational attainment, and functional limitations at MIDUS 1. 
To control for the possible influences of coincident illness, obesity, and depressive 
symptoms on functional abilities, MIDUS 2 measures of number of chronic medical 
conditions, smoking status, BMI, and depression were included in all models. Poisson 
models used data from the full longitudinal sample.

 Binary logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of incident basic and 
intermediate ADL disability between MIDUS 1 and MIDUS 2, adjusted for covariates. In 
these models, the analytical samples were limited to respondents with no functional 
limitations at MIDUS 1 (n = 3,244 for basic ADLs, and n=1,329 for intermediate ADLs). 
Models were estimated using Stata 13.0 (Statacorp., College Station, TX).
Given age-related changes in both sleep complaints and disability risk, and to determine 
whether the associations between sleep and ADL limitations varied with age, we conducted 
additional analyses that included interaction terms for sleep problems and age as predictors 
of longitudinal changes in ADL and incident ADL impairments.
Clustered robust standard errors were applied to account for familial relatedness among the 
twins and siblings in the sample. A threshold for statistical significance was set at alpha = 
0.05 in all models.
RESULTS
Descriptive statistics for the full analytical sample are shown in Table 1. Sociodemographic 
characteristics are from MIDUS 1. Mean age was 46.5 years, slightly more than half the 
sample was female, 6.3% were non-White, and 35.9% had completed a 4-year college 
degree or more. Data on other variables were from both MIDUS 1 and MIDUS 2. Between 
the two data collection points the average number of basic (MIDUS 1 = 0.06; MIDUS 2 = 
0.15; t(3,619)=−12.2, p<.001) and intermediate ADL limitations (MIDUS 1 = 0.95; MIDUS 
2 = 1.61; t(3,619)=−20.2, p<.001) rose significantly while the fraction of the sample 
reporting sleep problems did not change significantly (MIDUS 1 = 11.3; MIDUS 2 = 10.7; 
χ2=0.91, p=0.33). Of those who reported sleep problems at MIDUS 1, 38.9% continued to 
report sleep problems at MIDUS 2 (data not shown). The fraction of people who met criteria 
for depression on the CIDI-SF declined significantly between MIDUS 1 (12.0 %) and 
MIDUS 2 (10.1%; χ2=10.32, p=.001), and average number of chronic conditions increased 
significantly between MIDUS 1 and MIDUS 2 (t(3,619)=28.89, p<.001).
Poisson regression models were used to estimate the increase in basic and intermediate ADL 
limitations associated with reporting poor sleep at MIDUS 1 adjusted for MIDUS 1 
sociodemographic characteristics and initial levels of functional limitations and MIDUS 2 
health, health behavior, and depression. As shown in Table 2, reporting chronic sleep 
problems at MIDUS 1 was associated with significantly increased rates of both basic and 
intermediate ADL limitations. Compared to those without sleep complaints, respondents 
who reported chronic sleep problems in the prior year showed a 55% increase in basic (p<.
001) and a 28% increase in intermediate ADL limitations (p<.001). Greater risk of increases 
in functional impairments was also associated with greater age, being female, being White 
(intermediate ADLs only), not having completed a 4-year college degree or more, greater 
numbers of chronic medical conditions, obesity, higher scores on the CIDI depression scale, 
and smoking either currently or in the past.
The likelihood of incident disability between MIDUS 1 and MIDUS 2 was estimated using 
logistic regression models; analytical samples were limited to those respondents without

 ADL limitations at MIDUS 1. As shown in Table 3, compared to those with no sleep 
complaints, respondents who reported chronic sleep problems at MIDUS 1 were more than 
twice as likely to develop basic ADL limitations (p<.001) and 70% more likely to develop 
intermediate ADL limitations (p<.05). Age, being female, low educational attainment, being 
overweight or obese, more chronic conditions, depression, and smoking were all associated 
with likelihood of incident functional limitations at MIDUS 2.
Analyses that included age X sleep problems interaction terms showed that age significantly 
moderated the association of MIDUS 1 sleep problems and longitudinal increases in 
intermediate ADL limitations. Specifically, the rate of increases in limitations among 
younger and middle-aged adults (e.g. 45 year-olds) who reported sleep problems (increase of 
1.04 limitations) was double that of peers with no sleep complaints (2.13 increase; 
interaction effect: IRR = 0.98, p<.001). This interaction is displayed in Figure 1. Age did not 
moderate the association between sleep problems and change in basic ADL limitations.
Analytical refinements
We probed these results in four ways to rule out potential alternative explanations of the 
observed associations.
First, 39% of full analytical sample reported chronic sleep problems at both MIDUS 1 and 
MIDUS 2. It is possible that the observed longitudinal associations for sleep complaints are 
accounted for by coincident poor sleep and functional limitations at MIDUS 2. To test this 
possibility, all regression models were re-estimated with an additional adjustment for sleep 
complaints at MIDUS 2. Inclusion of MIDUS 2 sleep complaints slightly reduced the 
coefficients for MIDUS 1 sleep complaints, but the associations remained robust (p<.001 in 
both basic and intermediate ADL models). In the logistic regression models, the likelihood 
that someone with chronic sleep problems would develop basic ADL limitations at MIDUS 
2 declined from 133% that of someone without sleep complaints to 78%, but the effect 
remained statistically significant (p=.001). For intermediate ADL limitations, the odds 
declined from 79% to 69% and became marginally significant (p=.05). In all of these 
analyses, the coefficients and odds ratios associated with sleep problems at MIDUS 1 were 
consistently larger than those associated with sleep problems at MIDUS 2 (data not shown).
Second, as sleep complaints were assessed using a single item that was subjective and global 
in nature, we compared these responses to scores on a widely used measure of sleep quality, 
the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index23 (PSQI; this measure was only used in a sub-sample of 
MIDUS 2 respondents (n = 1,063), so it was unavailable for longitudinal analyses). The 
PSQI is a 24-item scale assessing 7 different sleep components: subjective sleep quality, 
sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping 
medication, and daytime dysfunction. Compared to respondents without sleep problems, 
those who reported sleep problems at MIDUS 2 had significantly higher scores on the PSQI 
(M = 9.47 vs. 5.47, t(997) = 153.81, p<.001), indicating significantly poorer sleep quality.
Third, use of sleep medication in the context of sleep complaints may contribute to 
functional limitations. The only variable available at MIDUS 1 referred to the use of 
sedatives without a doctor’s prescription; 105 MIDUS 1 respondents (2.3% of the sample)

 reported taking such medication, and inclusion of this variable in longitudinal models did 
not affect the relationship between MIDUS 1 sleep problems and MIDUS 2 functional 
limitations (data not shown). MIDUS 2 data, in contrast, included a specific question about 
the use of sleeping pills as part of the PSQI. To gauge the association of sleep medication 
use and ADLs cross-sectionally at MIDUS 2, we regressed numbers of basic and 
intermediate ADL limitations (separate models) on the 7 individual PSQI components, 
adjusted for age, sex, race, and education. The results showed that only the sleep disturbance 
(assessing trouble sleeping) and daytime dysfunction (assessing sleepiness during waking 
hours) components were associated with ADL limitations (p<.001 for both); use of sleep 
medication was not independently associated with either type of ADL (data not shown).
Finally, sleep problems and functional limitations were both assessed using self-report 
measures, raising the possibility that unobserved subjective factors may underlie both sets of 
ratings. To probe this issue, we examined an objective measure of functional status – a 50 
foot timed walk – and potential longitudinal effects of sleep complaints; walk time was 
measured in a sub-sample of MIDUS 2 respondents (n = 1,063). Linear regression models 
predicting walk time adjusted for sociodemographic, health, and health behavior covariates 
showed that on average respondents who reported chronic sleep problems at MIDUS 1 took 
more than 1 second longer to walk 50 feet than those who slept better (15.4 vs. 14.2 sec; p<.
05); this association remained significant after adjusting for sleep problems at MIDUS 2 
(p<.05).
DISCUSSION
The prospect of disability is a signature concern among aging adults, and as the population 
ages a better understanding of the causes of disability is increasingly important for 
individual health and quality of life as well as policies designed to improve overall 
population health. These analyses focused on subjectively poor sleep as a potential risk 
factor for disability. Reports of chronic sleep problems were associated with increases in 
basic and intermediate ADL limitations and with significantly greater odds of developing 
functional limitations at follow-up. In the case of basic ADL limitations, reporting poor 
sleep more than doubled the risk of incident disability. These associations were observed 
after accounting for a set of established disability risk factors, including advancing age, low 
educational attainment, chronic medical conditions, obesity, depression, and smoking. 
Moreover, with the exception of cross-time increases in intermediate ADL limitations, the 
relationship between sleep problems and disability did not vary with age (and for 
intermediate ADLs, differences based on sleep problems were more evident among younger 
and middle aged adults than older adults). Collectively, these results suggest that poor 
subjective sleep is a robust and independent risk factor for functional limitations, and that 
this risk is not limited to later life.
Impaired or insufficient sleep has been linked to a variety of diseases and associated risk 
factors. Population-based studies have consistently shown that routine sleep duration that is 
shorter or longer than the optimal amount (typically 7 hours a night) predicts greater risk of 
mortality.8–10,24 Objectively assessed low sleep quality, often associated with disruptions 
due to sleep-disordered breathing, increases the risk of hypertension, diabetes,

 cardiovascular disease, stroke, disability, and mortality.25–28 Subjective sleep ratings have 
also been linked to a range of adverse health outcomes, including diabetes, cardiovascular 
disease, and cardiac mortality.14–16 In spite of these associations, relatively few studies have 
focused on disability risk associated with poor sleep, and fewer still have involved 
representative population samples. Regional studies in Italy29 and China30 have linked low 
subjective sleep quality to greater risk of disability, and a recent study in the US reported 
greater risk of incident disability in members of the clergy who reported sleep problems.17 
The current study of a larger, community-based, nationally representative sample with a 
broader age range now adds robust support to the conclusion that poor sleep is an 
independent risk factor for disability in aging adults.
Poor sleep may lead to impaired function by way of a number of paths. Physical activity, for 
example, is protective against functional decline in aging men and women. Subjective 
reports of poor sleep are linked to fatigue31 that is often sufficient to limit daily activities in 
older adults.32 Physical activity in adults who sleep poorly may thus be reduced to levels 
that increase risk of functional limitations. Poor sleep is also linked to dysregulation of 
diverse physiological systems. For example, studies using both objective and subjective 
assessments show that naturally occurring poor sleep is associated with higher circulating 
levels of inflammatory proteins.33–37 In parallel experimental studies, sleep restriction 
reliably produces elevated levels of inflammation both acutely and chronically.38–41 
Inflammation in turn is linked prospectively with increased risk of disability,42 and 
experimental studies highlight a role for inflammatory proteins in the loss of muscle tissue 
that can result in sarcopenia43,44 and associated functional limitations. Poor sleep has also 
been shown to increase risk of obesity prospectively,36,45,46 and obesity increases risk of 
disability.6 There are thus multiple behavioral and physiological routes by which sleep may 
be linked to subsequent disability risk, although specific mechanisms have yet to be 
elucidated.
This study has several important limitations. Principally, sleep problems and functional 
limitations were both reported by MIDUS respondents rather than assessed using objective 
measures. This leaves open the possibility that their associations are explained by one or 
more unmeasured variables that capture a common subjective dimension. A number of 
observations from the current study make this possibility less likely. In the sub-sample of 
respondents who completed an objective assessment of functional status – the timed walk – 
those who reported sleep problems 9–10 years earlier were significantly slower, independent 
of current sleep problems. Moreover, sleep problems were claimed by many MIDUS 1 
respondents who reported no functional limitations, suggesting some independence between 
these measures, and those who did report sleep problems were twice as likely to develop 
substantial limitations in the intervening years. Finally, those who reported sleep problems 
had an average score on the PSQI, a widely used measure of sleep and sleep pathology, that 
was almost double that of people who reported none. All of these observations increase 
confidence that the observed links between sleep problems and functional status are not 
spurious. Another issue worth noting is that subjective reports of poor sleep often do not 
match the results of objective sleep assessments.13,47,48 Nonetheless, subjective complaints 
of poor sleep are meaningfully linked to health outcomes independently of objectively 
determined sleep patterns,49 the implication being that subjective and objective assessments

 capture unique aspects of sleep that are both important for understanding how sleep affects 
health.
Against these limitations are substantial strengths, including a large, nationally 
representative sample, a large time difference between the waves of data collections for 
assessing long-term change, and the availability of data with which to control for 
confounding and to probe for alternative explanations. The current results suggest that 
subjective reports of poor sleep significantly increase disability risk independently of 
demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, health, or health behavior, and that such 
risk extends to middle-aged men and women as well as older adults. These results add to a 
growing literature citing the importance of sleep to good health and the resulting need for 
effective ways to promote good sleep in the general population.50
