 Background—Antidepressant treatment failure is a common problem worldwide. In this study, 
we assess whether or not an important aspect of depression, cognitive impairment, is untreated by 
antidepressants by studying the effect of acute antidepressant treatment on a range of cognitive 
domains.
Methods—In this randomised longitudinal study, which is part of the International Study to 
Predict Optimized Treatment in Depression (iSPOT-D) trial, we assessed the effects of acute 
antidepressant treatment in a large patient population, across clinical remission outcomes, on a 
range of cognitive domains: attention, response inhibition, executive function during visuospatial 
navigation, cognitive flexibility, verbal memory, working memory, decision speed, information 
processing speed, and psychomotor response speed. We enrolled patients from primary or 
specialty care clinics in a multicentre, international, open-label, randomised, prospective trial. 
Eligible patients (aged 18–65 years) were previously untreated or were willing to undergo a 1-
week medication washout before the study start, and could not have had inadequate response to 
study medications in the past. We enrolled a large population of medication-free (ie, untreated) 
outpatients in a depressive episode and assessed them for cognitive function at enrolment (pre-
treatment), and again after 8 weeks of treatment with one of three antidepressant drugs 
(escitalopram, sertraline, or venlafaxine extended-release). Patients were randomly assigned 
(1:1:1) to one of the three antidepressants using a blocked randomisation procedure (block size of 
12). As a comparison group, we also simultaneously enrolled matched healthy participants. 
Healthy participants received no medication or intervention, but were assessed for change in 
cognitive and clinical measures during the same interval and testing protocol. Therefore, this 
group acts as a test–retest control for the primary outcome measure examined in this study, change 
in cognitive measures over 8 weeks of treatment in depressed patients. This study is registered 
with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00693849.
Findings—Between Dec 8, 2008, and Sept 30, 2011, we enrolled 1008 eligible people into the 
study. Impairment in five domains—attention, response inhibition, verbal memory, decision speed, 
and information processing—showed no relative improvement with acute treatment (controlling 
for time or repeated testing), irrespective of antidepressant treatment group, even in patients whose 
depression remitted acutely according to clinical measures. Broader cognitive impairment was 
associated with greater illness chronicity (earlier illness onset) but not with symptom severity or 
previous antidepressant failures.
Interpretation—Depression is associated with impairments in higher-order cognitive functions 
and information processing, which persist independently of clinical symptom change with 
treatment. We recorded no difference between the three antidepressants tested, with none showing 
efficacy for these impairments. Although the 8-week treatment period limits interpretation to acute 
treatment effects, it does highlight cognitive impairment as an untargeted contributor to incomplete 
treatment success.

Introduction
Major depressive disorder is a leading cause of the global burden of disability and disease,1 
and carries a persistent risk of relapse even during remission. Neither chronic illness features 
nor treatment response can be predicted by clinical symptoms in the acutely ill state. Rather,

 data increasingly point to persistent cognitive impairments being related to the effect of the 
illness on quality of life and underlying brain network mechanisms.2,3 New medications are 
also being developed with potential for greater efficacy for cognition.4,5 Therefore, definitive 
characterisation of the effects of depression and present treatment on cognition can have 
rapid implications for guiding optimisation of treatment.
Cognition encompasses a hierarchy of dissociable domains, mediated by distinct 
neurocircuitry, functioning in concert to enable people to carry out behaviour. These 
domains range from high cognitive load functions coordinating several task demands 
according to abstract rules and goals, to lower cognitive load psychomotor functions that 
sequence and enact motor responses based on concrete rules and cues.6 Depression and its 
treatment can have varying effects across these domains. Therefore, to definitively 
understand the effects of depression on cognition as a whole or its use as a treatment target, 
depression needs to be characterised on a wide range of cognitive tests in both the acutely ill 
and antidepressant-treated states. Unfortunately, the published scientific literature is very 
inconsistent with respect to whether or not successful antidepressant treatment improves 
cognition, and if so in which domains—an especially important question in light of previous 
reports implicating poor cognition as a predictor of worse treatment outcomes.7–9
Cognitive impairments have been recorded in acute depressive episodes in the domains of 
episodic memory, verbal memory, and varying subsets of executive function,10,11 although 
some studies instead have reported a more global cognitive impairment across all domains.12 
In terms of the effects of treatment, some studies have reported that impairments in 
executive function generally persist into euthymia13 but that verbal fluency improves with 
clinical remission.11,14 By contrast, a recent large meta-analysis reported treatment effects 
most commonly in the domains of verbal memory (a combination of verbal learning or 
acquisition with verbal recall and memory), working memory, processing speed, and, to a 
lesser degree, executive function.15 Importantly, however, in the studies that the meta-
analysis was based on, these findings were often not corrected for multiple comparisons, 
used inconsistent methods, and reported quite small improvements compared with the size 
of the illness-related impairment. These problems were described as substantial limitations 
by the authors of the meta-analysis. Other authors have cited additional inconsistencies in 
the existing scientific literature studying cognition in depression that limit definitive 
conclusions, including small study sizes and variability in cognitive domains assessed, tasks 
used, task design and reporting, assignment of task impairment to cognitive domain, and 
clinical assessment methods and criteria.15
Therefore, a large-scale and systematic investigation of cognition using a standardised test 
battery is needed to ascertain which cognitive domains, if any, are improved by 
antidepressant treatment.16 We sought to address this major knowledge gap by first studying 
the effect of depression on cognition in a well powered sample, and second, by assessing the 
effects of three frequently used antidepressants on cognitive change as a function of clinical 
treatment outcome. Based on the published literature, we postulated that a subset of 
cognitive impairments in depression would persist despite acute treatment with conventional 
antidepressants and attainment of clinical remission—ie, cognition is independent of clinical 
symptoms.

 Methods
Study design and participants
The methods of the International Study to Predict Optimized Treatment in Depression 
(iSPOT-D) are described in detail elsewhere.17,18 Briefly, this is a multicentre, international, 
open-label, randomised, prospective trial, measuring change in multiple cognitive and 
clinical measures in medication-free patients compared with healthy controls.
A complete list of participating institutions and regulations is provided in the original 
publication of the trial protocol.17,18 Eligible participants were adults (aged 18–65 years) 
with first-onset or recurrent, non-psychotic major depressive disorder or healthy controls 
matched in age, sex, and years of education. Patients were non-medicated at the start of the 
trial (they were either previously untreated or had at least 1 week of medication washout 
before the start of the trial). The inclusion criteria stipulated that patients had no history of 
treatment failure to any of the three protocol drugs (escitalopram, sertraline, or venlafaxine 
extended release [venlafaxine-XR]) and met criteria for single or recurrent non-psychotic 
major depressive disorder with total score on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for 
Depression (HRSD-17) less than or equal to 17. Patients were excluded for other psychiatric 
comorbidities and medical conditions that would interfere with completion of assessments or 
lead to contraindication to protocol medications. Patients were diagnosed according to 
DSM-IV criteria and their diagnosis was confirmed by Mini-International Neuropsychiatric 
Interview (MINI-Plus).19
Institutional review board approval was obtained at each clinical site. Every participant 
received a verbal and written explanation of study aims, methods, and potential risks and 
benefits from investigators, and provided written informed consent.
Randomisation and masking
Participants were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to antidepressant treatment with escitalopram, 
sertraline, or venlafaxine-XR, using a blocked randomisation procedure (block size of 12). 
An open-label study design was used to match clinical practice and to ensure safety, with 
treatment managed by usual care clinicians who did not participate in study ratings. 
Clinically trained study coordinators supervised by clinically qualified investigators carried 
out ratings masked to both patient treatment and cognitive performance.
Procedures
Clinic visits for all patients took place at study clinical sites (including academic settings 
and clinical practices) at week 0 (pretreatment) and week 8 (post-treatment) and included an 
interview with a study coordinator who used the HRSD-17 and the self-report 16-item Quick 
Inventory of Depression Symptomatology (QIDS-SR16) to assess each patient’s severity of 
depressive symptoms. Additionally, the QIDS-SR16 was administered via self-report 
assessments using standardised web-based infrastructure at clinical sites at 1, 2, 4, and 6 
weeks into treatment. Since some of the discrepancies in the published literature are 
attributed to use of different assessments of clinical remission, we did our analysis using

 these two different assessments to define clinical remission, which enabled us to ask whether 
our findings would differ depending on the definition of clinical remission used.
Antidepressant medication dosing was adjusted by the usual treating clinicians according to 
standard clinical practice. The mean dose of each treatment given to the patients was 12·3 
mg per day (range 5–20 mg) for escitalopram, 61·1 mg per day (range 12·5–200 mg) for 
sertraline, and 83·4 mg per day (range 18·75–225 mg) for venlafaxine-XR.18
Clinical remission was defined by an HRSD-17 score less than or equal to 7 or a QIDS-
SR16 score less than or equal to 5. Cognitive testing was done with the IntegNeuro battery, 
derived from and validated against well established neuropsychological constructs,20 and 
delivered at the pretreatment timepoint (week 0) and at week 8 as parallel versions through a 
computerised infrastructure allowing standardised acquisition. Nine cognitive domains were 
tested at each timepoint, which were chosen to cover a gradient of increasing cognitive load 
and complexity. These domains were: attention (1–back continuous performance test); 
response inhibition (go–no go task); verbal memory (verbal interference task); executive 
function (Austin maze); cognitive flexibility (Stroop task); working memory (forward digit 
span); decision speed (choice reaction time); information processing (switching of attention 
between numbers and letters in a trails A and B task); and motor coordination (finger 
tapping). In total, the computerised task battery took around 40 min to complete, and is used 
in patients with depression,9 and in cognitively impaired patient groups with schizophrenia21 
and distractible groups with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).22
Outcomes
We measured changes in performance in patients with depression after 8 weeks of treatment 
with one of the three antidepressants compared with the healthy controls who were retested 
at the same interval with no other intervention. Second, we analysed change in cognitive 
performance across domains in the subset of patients whose clinical symptoms remitted with 
treatment, compared with healthy controls tested during the same intervals and patients with 
depression whose symptoms did not remit. We assessed changes in cognition both across the 
group as a whole and at the individual level (to ensure that group effects were not countered 
or driven by a subpopulation of patients). We postulated that the effects on cognition would 
be similar across the three different treatment groups. We therefore studied the effects of 
treatment group on change in cognitive performance across domains at both the group and 
individual level. We did additional post-hoc analyses to assess differences in clinical severity 
and chronicity associated with different individual cognitive courses.
Statistical analysis
For each task, we recorded measures of accuracy, reaction time, and task completion time. 
We created summary-normalised performance indices for each task (appendix pp 1–2). 
Since our primary analysis compared change in cognitive measures over time and repeat 
testing, and therefore needed data from both pre-treatment and post-treatment timepoints to 
assess change, we included only patients who completed both the week 0 and week 8 
clinical and cognitive testing in our analysis (712 [71%] of 1008 patients). We used median 
replacement for outliers, which were defined as results that were more than 4 SDs away 
Shilyansky et al.

 from the mean, after initial confirmation that findings are consistent irrespective of whether 
median replacement or exclusion of outliers is used. Median replacement is done by 
replacing the outlier value with the value of the median of the group (with the outliers 
excluded) to avoid introducing skew in the distribution of the variable. To account for the 
effects of time and test– retest practice, all our analyses compared the change in cognitive 
performance in healthy controls against the change in performance in patient groups using 
repeated measures ANOVAs (at a group level) or reliable change index (on an individual 
level), or compared the same single timepoint in all groups (eg, week 8 patient group 
performance is compared with week 8 healthy control performance). We considered inter-
individual variability in cognitive change with treatment by assessing individual longitudinal 
change in cognitive performance. We did this using the reliable change index—a statistical 
device that establishes whether or not the change in each individual’s cognitive performance 
scores is significantly greater than expected from test–retest variation or practice effects. The 
reliable change index is defined as ([X2 - X1] – [M2 – M1]) / SDD, in which X1 is the 
recorded pre-test score for a patient in the depressed group, X2 is the recorded post-test 
score for a patient in the depressed group, SDD is the SD of the healthy control group test–
retest difference, M1 is the healthy control group mean pre-test score, and M2 is the healthy 
control group mean post-test score (see appendix p 4 for detail).
Role of the funding source
Brain Resource was involved in study design, central coordination, and quality control of the 
raw data. Brain Resource provided a publication committee to manage preparation of the 
report and factual check of protocol information. Brain Resource had no role in the 
acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of the data, nor in the preparation, review, or approval 
of the report, or the decision to submit for publication. AE had full access to all the data in 
the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Between Dec 8, 2008, and Sept 30, 2011, we enrolled 1008 patients with depression (mean 
age 37·8 years [SD 12·6]; 571 [57%] were women), and 336 healthy controls (mean age 37·0 
years [SD 13·1]; 191 [57%] were women).18 Enrolled patients were randomly assigned 
(1:1:1) to escitalopram (n=336), sertraline (n=336), or ven lafaxine-XR (n=336). Appendix p 
21 shows the trial profile. Participant demographics, clinical history, and completer rate did 
not differ by treatment group.18 Completers (patients who completed both the week 0 and 
week 8 clinical and cognitive testing) did not diff er from non-completers in week 0 clinical 
measures or cognitive scores (p>0·05, two-tailed t test) except in attention (p=0·002, 
Cohen’s d=0·21, two-tailed t test). 316 (94%) of the 336 healthy controls were completers 
(median replaced, appendix p 1).
We initially looked for evidence of persistent cognitive dysfunction after treatment in the 
patient group as a whole (appendix p 2). We found no additional improvement in cognitive 
performance in patients with depression after 8 weeks of treatment beyond the effects of 
time and practice effects noted in healthy controls during the same period (repeated 
measures ANOVA, group × time interactions; table 1). Cognitive performance in patients

 remained impaired post-treatment at week 8 compared with healthy controls at week 8 in 
most domains, with effect sizes similar to those reported in previous large studies (table 1; 
appendix).23
We then analysed the relation of impairments in each cognitive domain to patient factors 
such as age and subjective cognitive symptoms. Age is not related to cognitive impairment 
in patients, when studied across the age range of participants (figure 1; appendix p 6). 
Furthermore, subjective measures of concentration and decision making did not correlate 
with objective performance (appendix p 7).
We then studied whether or not depression-related cognitive dysfunction persisted in the 
subgroup of patients whose clinical symptoms remitted after 8 weeks of antidepressant 
treatment. Here, we describe the results of our analysis with remission defined according to 
HRSD-17 scores at week 8, and report similar analyses with remission defined according to 
week 8 QIDS-SR16 scores in the appendix. We compared change in cognitive performance 
in patients who achieved clinical remission (major depressive disorder [MDD]-remit group) 
over the course of treatment with change in cognitive performance in healthy controls during 
the same time interval and retesting procedure. We did this analysis in cognitive domains in 
which the MDD-remit group showed impairments compared with healthy controls (repeated 
measures ANOVA, main effect of group; table 2). Within these domains, cognitive 
performance in the MDD-remit group between the two timepoints showed no change above 
that seen in healthy controls (repeated measures ANOVA, group × time interactions; table 2) 
in attention, response inhibition, cognitive flexibility, verbal memory, decision speed, and 
information processing (figure 2). We then compared cognition between the MDD-remit 
group at post-treatment on week 8 and the healthy control group at week 8. At the post-
treatment timepoint, the MDD-remit group showed significant deficits (post-hoc t test, table 
2) in attention, response inhibition, verbal memory, decision speed, and information 
processing compared with healthy controls after the same 8-week interval (figure 2). 
Therefore, these five domains showed persistent impairment in people affected by major 
depressive disorder, with no change in cognition above that seen in healthy controls, despite 
clinical improvement.
Cognitive flexibility and executive function (figure 2B) showed impairments in the acutely 
ill phase, but week 8 performance scores did not differ significantly between the MDD-remit 
group and healthy controls (post-hoc week 8 t test; table 2). Change in cognition in the 
MDD-remit group over the 8-week interval did not differ across treatment groups in either 
executive function (repeated measures ANOVA, time×treatment group p=0·43, 
F[2,320]=0·85) or cognitive flexibility (repeated measures ANOVA, remission 
time×treatment group, p=0·21, F[2,320]=1·55). Causes of improvement in these two 
domains cannot be distinguished between effects of treatment, placebo, and practice effects 
(which would have to be greater in patients than controls). However, within cognitive 
flexibility, the data suggest a benefit from practice effects with retesting in the MDD-remit 
group because no change in cognitive performance occurred above that found in healthy 
controls over the 8 weeks and the test–retest procedure.

 In summary, although this pattern was not detected in assessment of the patient group as a 
whole, analysis only of patients with a successful treatment course showed improvement in 
executive function (in this case, assessed by a visuospatial planning task) and cognitive 
flexibility (figure 2B). By contrast, even when treatment led to clinical remission, no change 
occurred in cognitive impairments in attention, response inhibition, verbal memory, decision 
speed, or information processing. Furthermore, the severity of impairments in these five 
domains did not differ significantly between remitters and non-remitters (appendix pp 7–8). 
These findings remain robust irrespective of whether remission is defined by objective 
(HRSD-17) or subjective (QIDS-SR16) measures of clinical symptoms, or timing of clinical 
change (appendix pp 8–9, 12).
Next, we assessed treatment group effects, to ascertain whether any one of the three 
antidepressant treatments led to a greater change in cognition than the others during the 8 
weeks of treatment and retesting, in either the MDD-remit or the MDD-non-remit group. We 
did not record a significant effect of treatment group on changes in cognition in either 
patient subgroup (repeated measures ANOVA, group×time×treatment; table 3, appendix p 
13). Individual drug-level data, specifically cognitive change in each domain in MDD-remit 
and MDD-non-remit groups with each drug, are shown in appendix p 13. Overall, we 
recorded no change in the course of cognitive symptoms over time, testing, or treatment; this 
situation remained the same irrespective of antidepressant treatment choice between 
venlafaxine-XR, escitalopram, or sertraline.
For our evaluation of inter-individual variability in cognitive change with treatment, we 
assessed individual longitudinal change in cognitive performance. The percentage of patients 
showing improvement, worsening, or no change in performance in each cognitive domain 
over the course of treatment is tabulated (appendix p 14). In all domains, most patients 
(82·0–95·1%) showed no significant change, irrespective of clinical remission status 
(appendix p 14). Furthermore, improvement in any one cognitive domain was not 
consistently associated with improvement in any other domain. Only 4·5% of patients 
showed improvement in more than two areas of cognition, and these patients showed similar 
clinical symptom severity (appendix p 15) but less clinical chronicity (appendix p 15). The 
proportion of individuals who showed improvement in more than two cognitive domains was 
no higher in any of the treatment groups versus the others (nine patients in the escitalopram 
group, 12 in the sertraline group, and 11 in the venlafaxine-XR group, χ² [2 degrees of 
freedom; n=712]=0·33, p=0·85, no significant deviation from equal distribution across all 
three groups). The percentage of patients with previously unsuccessful antidepressant 
treatment did not differ significantly between patients whose cognition improved in more 
than two domains and all other patients (appendix p 15, χ² [1 degree of freedom, 
n=712]=0·22, p=0·64).
Discussion
In this report, we present a large-scale and definitive study that broadly assesses the profile 
of the cognitive effects of depression and antidepressant treatment, longitudinally across ill 
and euthymic states (encompassing successful and unsuccessful treatment) and across three 
different, frequently used antidepressants. With this approach, we reconcile inconsistencies

 in the published literature that have restricted our understanding of the cognitive effects of 
depression and antidepressant treatment, and the relevance of cognition as an endophenotype 
or as a treatment target. Until now, the question of whether cognitive impairments in 
depression are trait-like or state-like phenomena had not been answered conclusively. Here, 
we show a trait-like persistence of and absence of anti depressant treatment efficacy for 
impairments in attention, response inhibition, verbal memory, information processing, and 
decision speed, even in the context of clinical remission and independent of age. 
Furthermore, we show state-like improvement in the domains of cognitive flexibility and 
executive function (here, measured in visuospatial planning and self-monitoring task). 
Although we cannot definitively say if improvement in executive function above that seen in 
healthy controls is due to benefit from practice, placebo effects, or active treatment, our data 
for cognitive flexibility suggest improvement caused by intact practice effects in this 
domain. By virtue of assessing a broad set of cognitive domains over the course of treatment 
in a large sample, our data overcome difficulties of previous work that has produced 
inconsistent results, and clearly delineate which subsets of domains show more trait-like and 
which show more state-like impairments. Interestingly, the pattern of trait-like and state-like 
cognitive impairments is not directly indicative of cognitive load, which is consistent with 
previous studies.11,16 One area probed by our tasks with more traitlike impairments,24 the 
orbitofrontal cortex, also shows trait-like abnormalities in activity during a functional 
imaging study of a mood challenge in the clinically remitted state of depression.25 Perhaps 
tasks showing trait-like impairments probe an underlying persistent neural circuit 
dysfunction associated with depression.
Our objective test battery captured objective task-based cognitive impairments that persisted 
beyond improvement in subjective reports of impaired concentration. A poor correlation 
between subjective and objective measures of cognitive performance has long been recorded 
in depression, across different assessment methods.26 Subjective report (either broadly, or of 
concentration symptoms specifically) therefore provides a poor assessment of cognitive 
function in the setting of depression, where it can be affected by mood symptoms and self-
evaluation biases. Additionally, poor subjective insight into cognitive accuracy is reported in 
healthy patients, in part due to expectancy effects,27 and similarly might contribute to a poor 
correlation between subjective and objective assessment of cognition in depression. Our 
work emphasises the usefulness of objective cognitive measures in capturing the complete 
range of impairments associated with depression during acute episodes and upon remission.
Our study assessed the effects of three different commonly prescribed antidepressants on 
cognitive impairments that occur in depression. All three antidepressants were prescribed 
according to standard clinical practice: two selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(escitalopram and sertraline) and a serotonin– norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor 
(venlafaxine-XR). Cognitive change, however, does not differ across treatment groups in any 
cognitive domain, including for those cognitive domains in which improvement was 
recorded at week 8. Therefore, if any true difference between treatment groups were to exist, 
it would have to have a very small effect size relative to the severity of cognitive impairment 
in patients, since our study is powered to detect changes with effect sizes greater than 0·009 
(partial η², based on power analysis for repeated measures ANOVA examining 
time×remission status×treatment group effects), which is well below what is accepted as a

 small effect size (0·2–0·3). Consistent with this idea, only a small proportion of people show 
broad cognitive improvement in any treatment group (4·5%, based on the individual reliable 
change index analysis), and the average cognitive change in any treatment group is small 
compared with the total cognitive impairment in all domains (based on the group analysis). 
Interestingly, cortical activity during cognitive task performance (response inhibition) 
predicts outcome to venlafaxine-XR in a neuroimaging subsample from this study,28 but 
cognitive performance itself does not change with venlafaxine treatment at the behavioural 
level.
Our analysis of individuals grouped by their course of cognitive symptoms shows that 
improvement in cognition rarely occurs in more than two cognitive domains in any 
individual. However, the small subgroup of patients (32 [4·5%] of all patients with 
depression) showing broader improvement across more cognitive domains also has later age 
of illness onset, although interestingly not a decrease in the number of lifetime depressive 
episodes. Furthermore, where improvement is recorded at the group level in cognitive 
flexibility and executive function, greater improvement is associated with less clinical 
chronicity.
Several limitations of this study should be noted. Since the remitted group still has a small 
but still statistically significant increase in symptoms after 8 weeks of treatment compared 
with healthy controls, we cannot rule out that complete elimination of symptoms might be 
necessary before cognitive dysfunction improves. Second, the 8-week treatment period is 
quite short, with sustained remission defined by a period of 8 weeks since last depressive 
episode in published literature.23 Therefore, further studies assessing patients over longer 
periods of treatment will be important follow-up to the present findings. Additionally, 
patients have a variable clinical history before entry into this study. Neither clinical history 
nor demographics predicted treatment response or differed across treatment groups in this 
study;18 however, we cannot generalise our findings here to patients earlier in their illness 
course without previous acute episodes or treatment history. Again, follow-up studies in this 
population might address whether or not cognitive impairment is less persistent earlier in 
illness or lifetime treatment course. Finally, although unlikely, cognitive dysfunction post-
treatment might be related to medication use at week 8 in all patients (whereas cognitive 
impairments at baseline were due to the illness itself).
Future studies can address these limitations and analyse cognitive dysfunction as a distinct 
treatment target, aimed at improving long-term outcomes and addressing domains not 
already targeted by anti-depressant medication. Antidepressants with alternative mechanisms 
to those tested in this study are available and can be assessed for efficacy in targeting 
cognitive impairments in domains that we find remain untreated using the medications tested 
here. Early studies of these medications have reported efficacy for cognitive domains that we 
found to be unresponsive to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and serotonin–
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressants used in this study. For example, 8 weeks 
of treatment with vortioxetine (a pharmacodynamically novel multimodal antidepressant that 
exerts effects across several neurotransmitter systems in addition to acting at serotonin 
receptors and inhibiting the serotonin transporter) was shown to improve verbal memory 
(measured using the Rey auditory verbal learning test), information processing (using simple

 reaction time), decision speed (using the trail-making test), and cognitive flexibility (using 
Stroop) in adult patients with recurrent major depressive disorder.4 Although cognitive 
flexibility was improved by antidepressants in our study too, the first three domains were not 
improved in our study of the effects of antidepressants and therefore might be domains 
where vortioxetine shows improved efficacy for cognition. Adjunct lisdexamfetamine (a 
pharmacologically inactive prodrug of D-amphetamine currently approved for treatment of 
ADHD) was also shown to improve executive function in patients with mild depression 
above that reported with monotherapy with a con ventional antidepressant.5 However, here 
we also found executive function to improve with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or 
serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor treatment. In future work, it will be important to 
examine whether adjunct lisdexamfetamine also improves function in the five cognitive 
domains unaffected by common antidepressant treatment in our study. Consistent with our 
findings here, studies of these agents suggest that additional mechanisms besides those used 
by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or serotonin– norepinephrine re uptake inhibitor 
anti depressants are needed to target the cognitive impairments associated with depression. 
Finally, our finding that patients still benefit from intact practice-related learning in some 
domains is also consistent with early evidence for the efficacy of cognitive training 
approaches in depression.29

 Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed from Jan 1, 1975, through to Nov 30, 2015, with the terms 
“cognition”, “unipolar depression”, and “antidepressant” for articles published in English 
characterising change in cognitive impairment in unipolar depression with antidepressant 
treatment. Despite published studies showing overwhelming consensus for the 
importance of assessment and treatment of cognition in depression, no conclusion has 
been reached about the full profile of cognitive domains impaired in unipolar depression, 
whether this profile differs between acutely ill and euthymic patients, and the effect of 
treatment with typical antidepressants on cognition. Rather, the existing literature is 
fractured by conflicting findings from small studies using inconsistent methods, 
examining different subgroups of cognitive domains and often without appropriate 
controls for multiple comparisons, assessing patients with mild to severe clinical 
symptoms rather than those in remission, and often focusing only on older adults. 
Therefore, whether or not cognition is affected by treatment with typical antidepressants 
and whether this differs by type of antidepressant or clinical outcome, remain unknown. 
This major knowledge gap has important clinical implications: no guidelines exist 
regarding assessment of cognitive impairment in depression or treatment strategies for 
patients with impaired cognition. What is therefore needed is a definitive determination 
of the effects of antidepressants on the entire cognitive profile associated with depression, 
across the full non-elderly adult age range (18–65 years).
Added value of this study
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first large-scale, primary, prospective 
analysis of cognitive change with typical antidepressant medication treatment. It is also 
the first study to systematically probe a broad range of cognitive functions, 
longitudinally, in patients across the full adult age range, allowing a comprehensive 
determination of the efficacy of three commonly used antidepressants on the cognitive 
profile of depression. Furthermore, we assess the effects of both successful and 
unsuccessful treatment on cognition, compared with a large sample of healthy controls 
reassessed at the same interval, and do analyses at both the group and individual level. 
This approach ensures a robust result that is not dependent on analysis method, outcome 
definitions, or the potential for false-positive results common in small studies. Our 
findings show that at the population level, patients with depression have robust cognitive 
impairments in attention, response inhibition, verbal memory, decision speed, and 
information processing, which show no change despite antidepressant treatment when 
compared with controls tested at the same intervals, and are notably similar irrespective 
of clinical remission. Other cognitive domains (executive function and cognitive 
flexibility) do improve over the course of acute treatment. These findings create a robust 
foundation for understanding previous studies that were not able to assess all domains in 
the same patient population, adding a characterisation of relative impairments and change 
across domains. Our findings are also notable for the analysis of the course of cognitive 
impairments on an individual level, which is rarely done but is of major clinical 
importance. We found that impairments persist despite treatment in more than 95% of

 patients and broader cognitive impairments occur in individuals with greater illness 
chronicity. Importantly, we also add to the literature a comparison across treatments, and 
report that none of the three commonly used antidepressants tested showed better efficacy 
for cognition compared with the others, irrespective of clinical outcome or age.
Implications of all the available evidence
Impairments in higher order cognitive operations are representative of trait-like features 
of depression that commonly used antidepressants do not effectively improve in the 
overwhelming majority of patients, even when clinical remission is achieved. These 
specific cognitive domains are an untreated aspect of depression that probably contributes 
to high rates of treatment failure and risk of relapse. Our findings therefore support the 
importance of cognition as an unmet treatment need, and therefore a potential therapeutic 
target, and highlight the need for careful assessment of cognition in trials of new 
antidepressants.
