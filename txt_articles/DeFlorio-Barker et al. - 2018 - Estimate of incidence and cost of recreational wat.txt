recreational waterborne illness on United
States surface waters

Abstract
Background: Activities such as swimming, paddling, motor-boating, and fishing are relatively common on US
surface waters. Water recreators have a higher rate of acute gastrointestinal illness, along with other illnesses
including respiratory, ear, eye, and skin symptoms, compared to non-water recreators. The quantity and costs
of such illnesses are unknown on a national scale.
Methods: Recreational waterborne illness incidence and severity were estimated using data from prospective
cohort studies of water recreation, reports of recreational waterborne disease outbreaks, and national water
recreation statistics. Costs associated with medication use, healthcare provider visits, emergency department
(ED) visits, hospitalizations, lost productivity, long-term sequelae, and mortality were aggregated.
Results: An estimated 4 billion surface water recreation events occur annually, resulting in an estimated 90
million illnesses nationwide and costs of $2.2- $3.7 billion annually (central 90% of values). Illnesses of moderate severity
(visit to a health care provider or ED) were responsible for over 65% of the economic burden (central 90% of values:
$1.4- $2.4 billion); severe illnesses (result in hospitalization or death) were responsible for approximately 8% of the total
economic burden (central 90% of values: $108- $614 million).
Conclusion: Recreational waterborne illnesses are associated with a substantial economic burden. These findings may be
useful in cost-benefit analysis for water quality improvement and other risk reduction initiatives.

Background
Surface water recreation in lakes, ponds, rivers, and
oceans is popular in the US. According to the National
Survey on Recreation and Environment (NSRE), over
61% (142 million people) of the US population over
16 years of age used waterbodies to participate in a
range of non-motorized water sports like swimming,
kayaking, and canoeing [1].
The enjoyment people get from surface water recreation
is tempered by the risk of illness from exposure to polluted
water. Water recreators have a higher incidence of acute
gastrointestinal illness (AGI) and non-enteric illnesses, in-
cluding respiratory, ear, eye, and skin symptoms than non-
water recreators [2–6]. Sporadic illnesses from water recre-
ation often are mild and identified through epidemiologic
studies [3, 7]. In contrast, outbreaks among surface water
recreators are documented in the Waterborne Disease and
Outbreak Surveillance System (WBDOSS) annually. From
2000 to 2010 WBDOSS recorded 102 outbreaks associated
with untreated recreational water (excluding swimming
pools and water parks), and more than 1559 cases of illness.
WBDOSS is a passive outbreak surveillance system. Mem-
bers of the public, clinicians, or clinical microbiology
personnel are to notify health department personnel about
suspected outbreaks. Health department personnel investi-
gate to verify whether an outbreak has occurred and
whether it is linked to water recreation. Recognized out-
breaks constitute an unknown fraction of all waterborne
disease outbreaks that occur [8].

 To date, the literature does not describe the number
of illnesses attributable to surface water recreation in the
US or the costs of such illnesses per year. Without these
estimates, costs of improved public health protections,
beach monitoring and notification programs, or beach
remediation efforts cannot be put into context. Assess-
ments of economic burden from illnesses due to water
recreation have been published in recent years though
they are limited either in terms of data availability, a
focus on a specific location [9], or focus on costs associ-
ated with hospitalization of illnesses thought to be trans-
mitted by water, but not specifically through recreational
water exposure [10]. We have recently described the se-
verity [11] and costs [12] associated with sporadic cases
of AGI in two large cohort studies of water recreation.
Costs of AGI attributable to water recreation per 1000
recreators,
ranged
between
$338
and
$1681
for
incidental-contact recreation (paddling, motor-boating,
and fishing) and between $425 and $2743 for swim-
ming/wading per 1000 recreators. Our primary objective
in the present study was to construct an estimate of the
national economic burden of surface water recreation in
the US for sporadic and outbreak-associated illnesses.
Methods
Overview
To estimate the annual number of cases of illness (AGI,
respiratory, ear, eye, and skin) attributable to surface
water recreation, we first estimated the number of
people who engage in surface water recreation annually.
We combined estimates of the size of the water recrea-
tor population with estimates of rates of the occurrence
of illness and the fraction of illnesses attributable to
water recreation from cohort studies of swimming and
incidental-contact recreation to form estimates of the
number of sporadic illness that occur annually due to
water recreation. Two cohort studies used to estimate
sporadic cases of recreational waterborne illness in the
US included the National Environmental and Epidemio-
logical Assessment of Recreational Water (NEEAR,
which addressed swimming) and the Chicago Health,
Environmental
Exposure,
and
Recreation
Study
(CHEERS, which addressed incidental-contact recre-
ation, such as paddling, motor-boating, and fishing).
NEEAR evaluated health outcomes among approxi-
mately 26,000 beachgoers at freshwater and marine
water beaches in six states [4–6] between 2003 and
2009. CHEERS evaluated similar health outcomes of
incidental-contact
water
recreation,
enrolling
over
11,000 participants at 39 locations in the Chicago, Illi-
nois area between 2007 and 2009 [3]. These studies eval-
uated the health impacts of water recreation at locations
impacted by human fecal pollution, among a large num-
ber of water recreators.
We defined illnesses in the analysis as being mild,
moderate, or severe. Mild illnesses were defined as not
having contact with a health care provider (HCP), while
moderate illnesses were defined has having contact with
a HCP, whether in an outpatient facility, or an emer-
gency department (ED). Rates of mild and moderate
illness were estimated using the two cohort studies.
Severe illnesses were defined as illnesses resulting in
hospitalization or death, and were estimated using
WBDOSS outbreak surveillance data. Assumptions of
FoodNet surveillance system researchers were used to
account for underdiagnosis and underreporting of cases
of severe illness in the outbreak surveillance system [13].
Costs for all levels of severity were estimated based on
the
use
of
over-the-counter
(OTC)
medication,
prescription medication, and time missed from work.
Moderate illnesses also included costs associated with
relevant HCP or ED visits. Severe illnesses, also included
costs of hospitalization (rates were estimated based on
both WBDOSS outbreak data and published studies
(Additional file 1: Table S1), death (using value of a stat-
istical life (VSL) [14], as well as costs associated with
other health consequences which developed due to the
primary illness (sequelae). By multiplying the estimated
number of cases of illness attributable to water recre-
ation (recreation events × attributable risk) by the distri-
bution of costs we arrived at a range of cost estimates
for each illness type (mild, moderate, or severe). Monte
Carlo simulation calculated 100,000 realized values of
the potential cost of surface water recreation, allowing
us to estimate the mean and central 90% of values (C90)
(5th and 95th percentile of the distribution) of costs for
mild and moderate gastrointestinal, respiratory, eye, ear,
skin conditions, as well as pathogen-specific severe
illnesses attributable to water recreation.
Data sources: Number of water recreation events
The number of swimmers/waders, paddlers, motor-
boaters, and anglers per year in the US were estimated
using the proportion of the non-institutionalized US
population over 16 years of age who engage in water
recreation each year [1]. These proportions, combined
with the total US non-institutionalized population in
2007, estimated by the US Census [15], yield the total
number of water recreators in the US over 16 years.
Estimates of the total number of water recreators
16 years and under were estimated based on the pro-
portion of persons 16 and under, relative to the num-
ber of those over age 16 by activity in two studies of
water recreation [3, 4, 6]. The estimated number of re-
creation events was calculated using national esti-
mates of days of water recreation per water recreator
by recreational activity [1].

 Mild and moderate illness occurrence and severity
NEEAR and CHEERS data demonstrate that among
participants who developed AGI, over 50% took OTC
medications, 40% stayed home from work, school, or
missed daily activities, almost 20% were in contact
with a HCP, 10% took prescription medications, and
1% went to an ED [11]. Costs of AGI varied among
water recreators, depending on whether illness re-
sulted in lost activities (such as work) and the extent
to which individuals with AGI utilized the healthcare
system [12]. In addition to AGI, we also evaluated
the occurrence and costs of ear, eye, skin, and re-
spiratory symptoms, by calculating the attributable
risks based on the two previous epidemiology studies
(Additional file 1: Table S2). Severity and costs of
these non-AGI illnesses were evaluated similarly (See
Additional file 1) as was done previously [12].
Severe illness occurrence and severity
To estimate the number of hospitalizations and deaths
due to each pathogen, we applied pathogen-specific
hospitalization
and
death
rates
among
laboratory-
confirmed illnesses (see Additional file 1: Table S1). Rec-
ognized outbreaks represent an unknown fraction of all
outbreaks, and underreporting and underdiagnosis are
threats to the accuracy of waterborne disease outbreak
surveillance data. To mitigate underreporting bias, we
used estimates of underreporting rates from validation
studies to construct adjusted illness counts, which were
then used to estimate the number of hospitalizations
and deaths. In a study of foodborne outbreaks of gastro-
intestinal infections, Scallan et al. [13] found that for
every case of illness identified during an outbreak, ap-
proximately 25.5 other cases were estimated to occur
without being captured by the outbreak surveillance sys-
tem. We used this multiplier of 25.5 to correct for the
underreporting and underdiagnoses of pathogen-specific
recreational waterborne illnesses under the assumption
that generally the same types and severity of illnesses
would be underreported and underdiagnosed at similar
rates whether the source of the illness was waterborne
or foodborne. Cases of vibriosis linked to surface water
recreation identified in WBDOSS include outbreaks as
well as single cases that occurred outside recognized
outbreaks [16]. As a result, numbers of vibriosis cases
are thought to be better estimated; and only an underre-
porting multiplier of 1.1 developed for foodborne gastro-
intestinal illness [13] was applied. Once the number of
outbreak-related cases were estimated, we then approxi-
mated the proportion of these cases which would be
hospitalized or would result in death, since our severe
illness category only included hospitalizations and deaths
due to recreational waterborne illness (Additional file 1:
Table S5 and S10). No multipliers were used for cases of
primary amoebic meningoencephalitis due to Naegleria
fowleri, since the illness is nearly 100% fatal and is un-
likely
to
go
undiagnosed
and
unrecognized
[17].
Hospitalization data
and death
data
(distinct from
counts of the number of cases in communities) can also
underestimate the number of cases caused by specific
pathogens. Therefore, to account for underdiagnosis
and/or underreporting, namely, we doubled the number
of hospitalizations and deaths [13, 18] realizing this
multiplier is subject to uncertainty.
Economic burden estimation
Health-related costs among the projected number of ill
water recreators were summarized for mild (no contact
with HCP), moderate (contact with HCP), and severe
(hospitalization or deaths identified from WBDOSS) water-
borne illnesses using methods common in studies estimat-
ing total economic burden of ill health [19, 20]. Total costs
associated with each outcome (i = [mild, moderate, severe])
were estimated according to Eq. 1, using the total cost of
OTC medications (OTCi), prescription medications (Rxi),
HCP visits (HCPi), ED visits (EDi), hospitalizations (Hospi-
tali), sequelae (Sequelaei), indirect costs resulting from
missing time from work (Productivityi), as well as costs as-
sociated with mortality, using the Value of a Statistical Life
(VSLi) [14] due to illness. All costs were adjusted for infla-
tion to 2007 dollars (the year when both NEEAR and
CHEERS overlapped), using relevant consumer price index
for medical care commodities (medications) and medical
care services (medical and hospital services) [21]. Cost
assumptions
and data
sources are described in the
(Additional file 1: Table S1). Costs for ED visits or hospitali-
zations were estimated from the Nationwide Emergency
Department Sample (NEDS) and Nationwide Inpatient
Sample (NIS) respectively, aggregated by the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), by ICD-9-CM
(Additional file 1: Table S3). Total excess costs per case
due to the development of with sequelae were estimated
for the following specific illnesses: Guillain-Barré syn-
drome (Campylobacter) [19, 22], hemolytic-uremic syn-
drome with or without end stage renal disease (E. coli
0157H7), [19, 20, 23], and reactive arthritis (Campylobac-
ter, Shigella) [19, 24, 25].

Rather than using point estimates to develop an esti-
mate of the total economic burden, we used a stochastic
approach using a Monte Carlo simulation. This simula-
tion is an effort to account for inherent randomness
in the many estimates involved in the analysis. A single
run of the simulation works by randomly drawing a
value from each of the distributions (Additional file 1:
DeFlorio-Barker et al. Environmental Health  (2018) 17:3 
Page 3 of 10
 Tables S4-S8) from means and other moments reported
in the literature or estimated from the cohort studies.
With the selected parameters, numbers of ill recrea-
tors and costs are calculated and then stored. This
process was repeated 100,000 times to yield an esti-
mated mean costs and the 5th and 95th percentile of
the distribution, or the central 90% of values (C90)
around
the
mean.
The
simulation
was
conducted
using Crystal Ball version 11.1.
Results
Approximately 4.04 billion surface water recreation events
were estimated to occur annually in the US. People who
engage in many of these activities tend to do so multiple
times annually [1]. The largest number of person-days of
water recreation are accounted for by swimming (1.9 bil-
lion, 47.7%), followed by fishing (1.1 billion, 27.3%)
(Table 1).
Epidemiologic data indicates risk for developing AGI
symptoms attributable to swimming/wading of approxi-
mately 15 cases per 1000 recreators (Table 2). The risk of
AGI illness attributable to fishing is approximately 15 per
1000, while the risk attributable to other incidental-contact
water recreation activities is 6 per 1000. The attributable
risks of respiratory, eye, ear, and skin symptoms varied by
type of water recreation. Given the number of water recre-
ation events (Table 1), and the activity-specific attributable
risks (Table 2), we estimate that of the 50 million sporadic
cases (outside of recognized outbreaks) of AGI illness at-
tributable to water recreation, 29 million (57%) are attribut-
able to swimming and 16.5 million (32%) are attributable to
fishing (Table 3). Approximately 10 million cases each of
respiratory, eye, ear, and skin illness attributable to water
recreation occur annually. These cases are almost entirely
in the context of swimming, with the exception of eye
symptoms, which primarily occur in the context of motor-
boating. The vast majority of sporadic illnesses are mild in
the sense that they do not result in contact with a HCP. Re-
spiratory, eye, and ear symptoms were more likely to result
in moderate illness involving HCP contact (Table 3). Ac-
cording the epidemiologic data, adults (aged 20–54) tend to
experience the majority of mild illnesses, while children (0–
10) experience the majority of moderate illnesses (Add-
itional file 1: Table S9). It is less clear how age effects those
with severe illness who are hospitalized or who die as this
information generally not publicly available. Based on out-
break data, we estimate that between 333 and 1696 hospi-
talizations and 16–67 deaths occur annually due to
recreational waterborne illness (Additional file 1: Table
S10).
Based on the distribution of illness severity in NEEAR
and CHEERS, the number of cases of illness, and the
cost of each severity category of illness, we estimate an
annual economic burden of recreational waterborne ill-
ness of $2.9 (C90: 2.2, 3.7) billion (Table 4). Lost prod-
uctivity accounted for $663 million (23% of the total),
due to the large number of individuals who could not at-
tend work. Moderate severity illnesses account for a
small percent of waterborne illness (9.2%), yet accounted
for the majority of the economic burden (C90: $1.9 bil-
lion, or 65% of the total). Among those with moderate
illness, HCP and ED visits accounted for 81% of the

 economic cost. While death was rare, the costs of lost
life accounted for 97% of the estimated $233.7 (C90:
108.5, 613.9) million attributed to severe illness events.
The cost of illness per case of illness ranged from $9.50
(C90: 8.62–10.34) for with mild illness, $233.38 (C90:
202.30–277.15) for moderate illness, and $302,685 (C90:
156,803–775,605) for the most severe illnesses. The
complete breakdown of economic burden by illness type
can be found in the (Additional file 1: Tables S11-S13).
Discussion
We estimate that swimming/wading, paddling, motor-
boating, and fishing in US surface waters account for
over 90 million cases of GI, respiratory, ear, eye, or
skin-related illnesses with a wide range of severity.
The estimated annual economic burden of
recre-
ational
waterborne
illnesses
is
approximately
$2.9
(C90: 2.2, 3.7) billion. While mild illness was com-
mon, approximately 65% of the cost was attributable

Dwight et al. [9] estimated the annual economic bur-
den (direct and indirect costs) due to water recreation at
two beaches in Orange County, California to be $3.3
million in 2001 dollars ($3.9 million in 2007 dollars)
based on lost productivity and healthcare office visit
costs. In the current analysis, we estimated 1.9 billion
swimming events occur annually in the US (Table 1). An
estimated 5.5 million swimming events occur annually at
Orange County beaches [26], or approximately 0.3% of
the swimming events in the US. If costs estimated by
Dwight and colleagues were scaled up, the national esti-
mate of the annual economic burden due to swimming
in surface water would be more than $1 billion. In con-
trast to the current study, Dwight et al. did not include
costs associated with hospitalization, deaths, or medica-
tions, and was focused on adults 18 years of age and
older, yet their estimate is still within the margin of error
for our estimate ($1.7 (C90: 1.4, 2.0) billion) among
swimmers/waders. Both cohort studies in the current
analysis included children, which could also account for
the cost differential between our analysis and the one
conducted by Dwight and colleagues, especially since
children (aged 0–10) appear to experience the majority
of moderate illnesses (Additional file 1: Table S9).
Another study by Given et al. (2006) examined the
number of excess gastrointestinal illnesses due to swim-
ming at 28 beaches in southern California [27]. This
study estimated that 627,800 and 1,479,200 excess
gastrointestinal illnesses occur annually due to swim-
ming in Los Angeles and Orange County California, or
between 2 and 5% of our national estimate. Using the
per-case cost estimate from Dwight et al. [9], costs (time
missed from work, doctor visits) Given et al. (2006) esti-
mated costs of GI illness to range from $21 to $51 mil-
lion
in
2000
dollars,
or
about
1–3%
of
our
national estimate of costs attributable to gastrointestinal
illness. Therefore, costs estimated by Given et al. (2006)
are consistent with our national estimate, despite not in-
cluding information regarding hospitalization or medica-
tion use.
Collier et al. [10] estimated that US hospitalization
costs for illnesses caused by microbes primarily trans-
mitted by water (giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, Legion-
naires’
disease,
otitis
externa,
and
non-tuberculous
mycobacterial infection) were $970 million annually and
illnesses only partially transmitted by water (campylo-
bacteriosis, salmonellosis, shigellosis, hemolytic-uremic
syndrome, and toxoplasmosis) accounted for $860 mil-
lion in hospitalizations annually. In that study, re-
searchers estimated the annual number of infections
caused by specific pathogens, then estimated the propor-
tion possibly due to water exposure (not specifically sur-
face
water
recreation).
In
the
present
study,
we
estimated costs due to hospitalizations from recreation
in untreated surface water to be $6.8 (C90: 3.2 to $14.1)
million, or approximately 4% of the Collier et al.

 estimate. This discrepancy between the two estimates
could be largely due to their inclusion of illnesses that
may have been acquired via drinking water, swimming
pools, and water parks, in addition to surface water re-
creation, or not via water exposure. From 2007 to 2008,
approximately 90% of all outbreaks and 95% of all out-
break cases were associated with treated recreational
water, such as swimming pools, spas, and water parks
[28]. Also, pathogens responsible for sporadic illness are
rarely identified [29]. Thus, estimation of costs of spor-
adic illness that rely upon identifying specific pathogens
in stool samples of ill recreators will underestimate the
costs overall in the absence of multipliers that account
for underdiagnosis and underreporting.
Foodborne illness has been estimated to cost between
$51–77 billion each year, depending on assumptions re-
garding lost productivity and pain and suffering [19].
Cost of illness due to surface water recreation would be
expected to be a fraction of the costs of foodborne ill-
nesses, as food consumption is a daily occurrence, unlike
water recreation.
A strength of the present study is large prospective co-
hort studies containing a combined over 35,000 partici-
pants were used to estimate risk of illness attributable to
surface water recreation. These studies obtained data
directly from those engaged in water recreation regard-
ing illness, healthcare utilization, and lost productivity.
Prior studies of the cost of waterborne illness that uti-
lized healthcare claims and hospital discharge data [10]
but had no available information regarding water expos-
ure. The present study used a combination of cohort
and outbreak data with known water exposure, and
other components of economic burden, such as costs as-
sociated with lost productivity and medication use. Un-
like the prior estimate of the cost of waterborne illness
at a California beach [9], the present study is likely more
representative of surface water recreation nationally, as
it included data from freshwater and marine beaches, as
well as urban inland waters. Furthermore, we incorpo-
rated additional costs components in the estimate (hos-
pitalizations, sequelae, and mortality).
Our findings are subject to several limitations. The ac-
curacy of the economic burden estimate depends on the
accuracy of the estimation of the total number of people
in the US engaging in water recreation and an estimate
of the total number of person-days associated with a
particular water activity. We only used estimates of the
number of warmwater fishing events, (fishing in rivers,
streams, lakes, and oceans); less common types of fish-
ing, including andromodous, coldwater, and saltwater,
[1], were not considered. We also focused primarily on
five major health outcomes (AGI, respiratory, ear, eye,
and skin symptoms) in addition to severe pathogen-
specific illnesses. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) produce
toxins that can result in AGI, respiratory, skin, eye, ear,
and neurological symptoms [30], and have been esti-
mated to be responsible for $0.5–$4 million in respira-
tory ED visits in Sarasota Country, Florida annually [31].
Exposures to HABs may have a significant economic im-
pact, but were not included in our analysis. We consid-
ered
sequelae
(hemolytic-uremic
syndrome
with
or
without end stage renal disese, reactive arthritis, and
Guillain-Barré syndrome) as a result of illness among
those who were hospitalized. However, we did not con-
sider costs of reactive arthritis, which can be treated in
an outpatient setting, for any individuals who were not
hospitalized, which could have also underestimated costs
among those with moderate illness.
In addition, our analysis assessed risks for individual
illnesses, but it is possible that water recreation can re-
sult in the development of more than one type of illness
(ie AGI and respiratory illness). While this would likely
not impact the attributable fraction, it could be expected
to have an impact on cost. For example, a person experi-
encing both AGI and respiratory symptoms who saw a
HCP or visited an ED, most likely would have been
treated for both symptoms concurrently, opposed to be-
ing charged for two individual visits. This could have re-
sulted
in
an
overestimation
of
economic
burden.
Additionally, we were not able to differentiate individ-
uals whose symptoms were due to infection versus other
causes; likewise, our reliance on symptom reporting
means that we were not able to estimate the number of
asymptomatic infections.
In our analysis, we did not estimate economic burden
according to age category. Since children are more likely
to have contact with surface water [32] and are at an in-
creased risk of illness [33], we would expect that some
of the economic burden for water recreation to be
among children. We found that according epidemiology
studies, a large portion of mild illness is among adults
aged 20–54, while the majority of moderate illness is
among children aged 0–10 (Additional file 1: Table S9).
While we expect risk to differ by age, whether the costs
differ according to age is less clear. With regard to lost
productivity for mild and moderate illnesses, we used an
estimate of the mean (and the 5th and 95th percentile of
the distribution) estimate of time missed from work esti-
mated from epidemiology studies, which already takes
into account the distribution of the age of those who be-
come ill. However, we know less about the age distribu-
tion among those who develop severe (hospitalizations/
death) illnesses following water recreation.
CHEERS and NEEAR were conducted at study loca-
tions that were likely impacted by human fecal pollution
(particularly CHEERS [34]). Thus, the attributable risks
calculated within the context of these studies may have
potentially
overestimated
the
risk
of
recreational

 waterborne illnesses relative to surface water recreation
overall. For example, illness rates at Boqueròn beach in
Puerto Rico, had lower concentrations of fecal indicators
and observed illness rates were much lower than those
in other NEEAR sites [35, 36], However, Boquerón is
atypical of US beaches as it is tropical and symptoms
following water recreation at Boquerón beach have been
strongly linked to cyanobacteria [37], as opposed to fecal
indicators. Water quality at NEEAR beaches generally
met local water quality criteria and health risks ob-
served there should reflect those at comparable bea-
ches elsewhere. The range of water quality observed
at waters where recreation took place in the epidemi-
ologic studies is well within those described in a na-
tional summary of water quality [38]. It is reasonable
to assume that as water quality improves, economic
burden would decrease, yet further study is necessary
to make this conclusion.
In addition, since the attributable risks were based on
epidemiologic studies, there is a possibility of over-
reporting of illness if they had at baseline concerns about
health risks due to water recreation, a phenomenon re-
ferred to as risk perception bias [39]. The use of the distri-
butions of the attributable risks may allow for some
degree of heterogeneity among beachgoers. Some attribut-
able risks confidence intervals estimated for specific out-
comes include zero (Table 2). To be conservative, we
included these negative values at the lower bound in our
Monte Carlo simulation. When we truncated risk at zero,
we did not observe significant differences in the mean
costs or in the C90.
Our cost estimates were approximated using 2007
USD. We chose to estimate the economic burden based
on the year 2007 since it was a year in which several of
our data sources overlapped. Accounting for inflation or
2007 USD estimate of $2.9 (2.2, 3.7) billion would be ap-
proximately $3.4 (2.6, 4.4) billion in 2017 USD. However,
since there have been several changes to the healthcare
system in recent years, it is inappropriate to express our
estimate in more recent dollars.
The use of outbreak and passive surveillance multi-
pliers based on foodborne illness data may not be
ideal for adjusting for undercounting of recreational
waterborne
outbreaks.
Currently,
extensive
surveil-
lance data exists for foodborne illnesses, which were
used to construct the multipliers [14]. Active surveil-
lance systems for recreational waterborne illnesses do
not exist in the US and it is unknown whether out-
break and passive surveillance multipliers are appro-
priate for recreational waterborne illness. However,
these
multipliers,
based
on
several
ratios
of
laboratory-confirmed cases of
foodborne
illness
to
cases identified through foodborne outbreak surveil-
lance, are currently the best available.
Conclusions
The annual economic burden due to surface water re-
creation ranges between $2.2–3.7 billion. Estimates of
costs of prevention activities (beach monitoring and no-
tification programs), and reduction of wastewater and
storm-water discharges near beaches, should be viewed
in context of this burden estimate. To date, approxi-
mately $140 million has been allocated toward beach-
water protection programs since 2001 [40] or about $10
million annually, a small fraction of annual estimated ill-
ness burden. Efforts to reduce severity of illness among
water recreators should be explored to reduce total eco-
nomic burden and encourage more individuals to enjoy
surface water recreation. Furthermore, we hope that fu-
ture investigations build upon our work by estimating
the health care costs saved as a function of improve-
ments in water quality.
