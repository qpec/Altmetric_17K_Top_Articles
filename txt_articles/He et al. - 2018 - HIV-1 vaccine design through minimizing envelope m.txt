Overcoming envelope metastability is crucial to trimer-based HIV-1 vaccine design. Here, we present a coherent 
vaccine strategy by minimizing metastability. For 10 strains across five clades, we demonstrate that the gp41 
ectodomain (gp41ECTO) is the main source of envelope metastability by replacing wild-type gp41ECTO with BG505 
gp41ECTO of the uncleaved prefusion-optimized (UFO) design. These gp41ECTO-swapped trimers can be produced 
in CHO cells with high yield and high purity. The crystal structure of a gp41ECTO-swapped trimer elucidates how a 
neutralization-resistant tier 3 virus evades antibody recognition of the V2 apex. UFO trimers of transmitted/
founder viruses and UFO trimers containing a consensus-based ancestral gp41ECTO suggest an evolutionary root 
of metastability. The gp41ECTO-stabilized trimers can be readily displayed on 24- and 60-meric nanoparticles, with 
incorporation of additional T cell help illustrated for a hyperstable 60-mer, I3-01. In mice and rabbits, these gp140 
nanoparticles induced tier 2 neutralizing antibody responses more effectively than soluble trimers.
INTRODUCTION
The envelope glycoprotein (Env) of HIV-1 harbors the epitopes of 
all broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) (1) and is the main target 
of vaccine design (2). The cleaved, mature Env is presented on HIV-1 
virions as a metastable trimer of heterodimers each containing a 
(co-)receptor-binding protein, gp120, and a transmembrane protein, 
gp41, which anchors the Env spike within the viral membrane and 
drives the fusion process during cell entry (3). Because of its labile 
nature and a dense layer of surface glycans (4), Env has long resisted 
structure determination and trimer-based vaccine design efforts. 
While the functional necessity of a metastable Env for HIV-1 infection 
is well understood, the molecular source of metastability and how to 
eliminate it from the Env trimer remain unclear. It is perhaps not an 
overstatement that overcoming Env metastability is central to trimer- 
based HIV-1 vaccine design.
Several strategies have been proposed to create stable and soluble 
gp140 trimers as potential vaccine immunogens. The early generation 
of gp140 trimers was based on intuitive designs to overcome meta-
stability via deletion of the cleavage site between gp120 and the gp41 
ectodomain (gp41ECTO) and the addition of trimerization motifs at 
the C terminus (5–7). A more rigorous and successful trimer design, 
designated SOSIP.664, stressed the importance of the gp120/gp41ECTO 
cleavage, trimer stability, and solubility (8). This format uses a di-
sulfide bond to covalently link gp120 and gp41ECTO, an I559P mutation 
in the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) region, and truncation of gp41ECTO at 
position 664. When applied to clade A BG505, the SOSIP trimer was 
shown to be a close mimic of the native Env spike (9) that enabled 
Env structure determination for the first time by x-ray crystallogra-
phy and electron microscopy (EM) (10, 11). The BG505 SOSIP trimer 
has substantially advanced HIV-1 research by providing an antigen 
for bNAb isolation and structural characterization (12–23), a strategy 
for stabilizing diverse Envs (24–27), and a template for trimer optimi-
zation either to shield non–neutralizing antibody (non-NAb) epitopes 
or to target bNAb precursors (28–31). As the SOSIP design continued 
to evolve, new versions (designated SOSIP.v5 and SOSIP.v6) that 
further improved trimer stability and immunogenicity were proposed 
(32). Removal of the cleavage site has proven successful in the forms 
of single-chain gp140 (sc-gp140) (33), native flexibly linked (NFL) 
(34, 35), and uncleaved prefusion-optimized (UFO) (36) trimers. However, 
it was not until recently that the primary cause of Env metastability— 
an HR1 bend (residues 547 to 569) in gp41ECTO—was identified and 
targeted directly by rational redesign (36). Notably, the I559P mu-
tation that improved trimer stability in the SOSIP design is within 
this HR1 bend (9). Glycine substitution in this region was also found 
to improve trimer properties in the NFL form (37). While attempts 
to elicit tier 2 NAb response with BG505 SOSIP trimers in wild-type 
(WT) mice were unsuccessful (38), both SOSIP and NFL trimers 
consistently induced autologous tier 2 NAbs in rabbits and nonhuman 
primates (NHPs), although only sporadic neutralization was ob-
served for heterologous tier 2 isolates (26, 39–43). Therefore, despite 
recent advances in rational design and structural analysis of native- 
like trimers (44, 45), critical barriers still remain in the path to an 
effective HIV-1 vaccine.
In this study, we set out to address the diverse challenges in HIV-1 
vaccine development with a coherent strategy centered on Env meta-
stability. We first examined the utility of a transient Chinese ham-
ster ovary (CHO) cell line (ExpiCHO) to express native-like trimers, 
which resulted in superior trimer yield, purity, and antigenicity 
while displaying subtle differences in glycosylation pattern and B cell 
response compared to human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 F–produced

trimers. We then demonstrated that gp41ECTO is the main source of 
metastability by replacing WT gp41ECTO with BG505 gp41ECTO of 
the UFO design for 10 Envs across clades A, B, C, B/C, and A/E. The 
gp41ECTO-swapped trimers (termed UFO-BG) exhibited substantial 
yield and purity and were structurally validated by negative-stain 
EM. Analysis of UFO and UFO-BG trimers by biolayer interferometry 
(BLI) against a large panel of 19 antibodies provided comprehensive 
antigenic profiles for each of the 10 Envs tested. A crystal structure 
was determined for the H078.14 UFO-BG trimer (tier 3, clade B) at 
a resolution of 4.6 Å, which explains how this neutralization-resistant 
virus evades apex bNAbs and enables antigenic optimization of this 
UFO-BG trimer. We also observed high yield, high purity, and native- 
like antigenicity for the UFO trimers of transmitted/founder (T/F) 
viruses and the UFO trimers containing a consensus gp41ECTO (termed 
UFO-C), suggesting an evolutionary explanation of Env metastability. 
Next, we displayed diverse UFO-BG trimers on a 24-meric ferritin 
nanoparticle (46) and demonstrated how to incorporate T cell help 
into nanoparticle constructs for a hyperstable 60-mer, I3-01 (47). In 
WT mice, ferritin and I3-01 nanoparticles, as well as a scaffolded 
gp140 trimer, induced autologous tier 2 NAbs to BG505.T332N after 
8 weeks, whereas soluble trimers did not. In rabbits, the ferritin 
nanoparticle elicited an autologous tier 2 NAb response after 6 weeks, 
which was statistically different than the tier 2 NAb response elicited 
by the trimer throughout the course of immunization. Heterologous 
neutralization was also detected in the analysis of rabbit samples 
against a 12-virus global panel (48). Our study thus presents a coher-
ent strategy for HIV-1 vaccine design as well as vaccine candidates 
that merit further evaluation in NHPs and potentially in humans.
RESULTS
A robust expression system for production of native-like 
gp140 trimers
Rapid growth in protein therapeutics and vaccines has accelerated the 
development of high-yield mammalian cell lines (49). In the past, trimer 
designs were primarily characterized in laboratory expression sys-
tems, with uncertainties in their transferability to an industrial setting. 
The CHO cell line is one of the principal mammalian expression sys-
tems that meet the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standard. 
Although SOSIP and NFL trimers have been produced in stable CHO 
cell lines for in vitro and in vivo testing, gp140 modification and bNAb 
affinity purification were required to achieve high-quality materials 
(42, 50–52). A transient, high-yield CHO cell line derived from the GMP 
CHO-S cells, such as ExpiCHO, would likely accelerate the evalua-
tion of new trimer designs and their development toward vaccine 
candidates.
Previously, we reported ExpiCHO expression of gp140-ferritin 
nanoparticles (46). Here, we examined the utility of ExpiCHO for 
producing native-like trimers. First, we transiently expressed BG505 
SOSIP, HR1-redesigned, and UFO gp140 trimers in ExpiCHO cells 
(all gp140 constructs tested hereafter were truncated at residue 664 
unless otherwise stated). Env proteins were extracted from super-
natants using a Galanthus nivalis lectin (GNL) column and purified by 
size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Superdex 200 16/600 col-
umn. Ultraviolet absorbance at 280 nm (UV280) was used as a metric 
to compare the SEC profiles (Fig. 1A). A 100-ml ExpiCHO expression 
produced well-folded gp140 protein equivalent to that obtained from 
2 to 4 liters of 293 F cells (5 to 12 mg before SEC). Overall, we observed 
a substantial reduction of misfolded species in the Env protein produced 
by ExpiCHO cells as compared to 293 F cells (36). While SOSIP and 
HR1-redesigned trimers were still mixed with small amounts of ag-
gregates, as shown by the shoulder to the left of the trimer peak at 
55 ml, the UFO trimer displayed a single peak indicative of homoge-
neity. In addition, the UV280 value of the UFO trimer was 2.6- and 1.2-fold 
greater than that of SOSIP and HR1-redesigned trimers, respectively, 
indicating a higher yield for the UFO trimer. Blue native polyacryl-
amide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) showed a characteristic trimer 
band across all SEC fractions with minimal impurity (Fig. 1B). We then 
evaluated trimer antigenicity using BLI and a panel of six bNAbs and 
four non-NAbs (Fig. 1C and fig. S1A). While binding kinetics appeared 
to be largely independent of the cell lines used, trimers produced in 
ExpiCHO cells showed enhanced bNAb recognition relative to those 
in 293 F cells (36). The UFO trimer displayed the least binding to non- 
NAbs, consistent with its high purity and stability, although all three 
trimers bound to a V3-specific non-NAb, 19b.
Next, we investigated the N-glycan processing of the cleaved HR1- 
redesigned BG505 trimer (36) in ExpiCHO and 293 F cells using meth-
ods previously reported for the cleaved BG505 SOSIP trimer (53, 54). 
The oligomannose content of gp140 was quantified using ultrahigh- 
performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) (Fig. 1D and fig. S1B). 
Glycans released from 293 F–expressed gp140 consisted of 56% oligo-
mannose type and 44% complex type, while an elevated proportion 
(64%) of oligomannose-type glycans was observed for the same con-
struct expressed in ExpiCHO cells. The oligomannose content of gp140 
expressed in both cell lines appeared to be similar to that observed for 
the BG505 SOSIP trimer, approximately 63% (53) or 68% (52). Site- 
specific glycan analysis was performed using liquid chromatography– 
mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to determine the relative intensities of 
the various glycoforms at each N-glycosylation site, revealing features 
characteristic of the native-like trimers (fig. S1C). As determined by 
UPLC, many glycosylation sites that present solely oligomannose- 
type glycans are from regions of underprocessed glycans previously 
characterized for the SOSIP trimer. For example, glycans at sites N332 
and N295 are exclusively oligomannose type (53) and are the key 
elements of a glycan supersite targeted by multiple classes of bNAbs 
recognizing Man9GlcNAc2 (55). Our analysis thus confirmed that 
this glycan supersite is present on the HR1-redesigned trimers pro-
duced in both cell lines. Similarly, another oligomannose-rich region 
encompassing N156 and N160 near the trimer apex showed patterns 
consistent with those observed for the SOSIP trimer (53, 54). Overall, 
the HR1-redesigned trimers expressed in either 293 F or ExpiCHO 
cells presented glycosylation patterns consistent with correctly folded 
Env. However, some ExpiCHO-specific glycan patterns were also ob-
served, such as a lower to nondetectable proportion of complex-type 
glycans at N339, which may contribute to the enhanced bNAb bind-
ing to the N332 supersite (fig. S1D). To examine whether cell line–
specific glycan patterns affect trimer-induced B cell responses in vivo, 
we immunized BALB/c mice with intraperitoneal injections of 50 g 
of BG505 gp140 trimer (HR1 redesign 1) adjuvanted with AddaVax 
at weeks 0, 3, and 6 and then probed the peripheral B cell repertoires 
by next-generation sequencing (NGS) (56). Although the two groups 
of mice displayed similar patterns of germline gene usage, slightly 
increased IGHV3 and IGHV5 frequencies (up to 4%) were observed 
in the B cell repertoires primed by the ExpiCHO-expressed trimer, 
suggesting a potential glycan influence on trimer-induced B cell re-
sponse (Fig. 1E).
Together, ExpiCHO provides a robust expression system for produc-
ing both native-like trimers and gp140 nanoparticles, with important

implications for manufacture. In addition to the proper proteolytic 
cleavage by furin when coexpressed in ExpiCHO cells, as previously 
reported for a standard CHO cell line (51), subtle differences in gly-
can processing and the B cell repertoire response are noted between 
trimers produced in ExpiCHO and 293 F cells.
Design and characterization of UFO-BG trimers for five  
HIV-1 clades
A major obstacle faced by current trimer designs is measurable loss 
in yield, purity, and stability once they are extended from BG505 to 
other strains. The solutions proposed thus far include the following: 
(i) purification methods aimed to separate native-like trimers from 
misfolded and other Env species (monomers, dimers, and aggregates), 
such as bNAb affinity columns (24), negative selection (34), multi-
cycle SEC (33), and a combined chromatographic approach (57), and 
(ii) auxiliary Env-stabilizing mutations informed by atomic struc-
tures (29, 37) or selected from large-scale screening (31, 58). However, 
these are empirical solutions that may often result in suboptimal out-
comes such as reduced trimer yield and bNAb recognition. Recently, 
we identified an HR1 bend (residues 547 to 569) in gp41ECTO as the 
primary cause of Env metastability (36). Rational redesign of this 
HR1 bend notably improved trimer yield and purity for multiple 
HIV-1 strains, yet still produced varying amounts of misfolded Env 
(36). These results suggested that other regions besides HR1, which 
might be located within gp120 and/or gp41ECTO, also contribute to 
Env metastability. Thus, determining the location of these “second-
ary factors of metastability” and eliminating them from the Env tri-
mer may prove crucial for trimer-based vaccine design.
Here, we hypothesized that all factors of Env metastability are 
encoded within gp41ECTO and that BG505 gp41ECTO of the UFO de-
sign (termed UFO-BG) can be used to stabilize diverse HIV-1 Envs 
(Fig. 2A). To investigate this hypothesis, we selected 10 Envs across five 
clades (A, B, C, B/C, and A/E) from either a large panel of tiered HIV-1 
pseudoviruses (59) or the available database (www.hiv.lanl.gov) and 
included three Envs tested in our previous study (36). Notably, 7 of 
10 Envs tested here were derived from tier 2/3 isolates. For each Env, 
the gp140 constructs of SOSIP, UFO, and UFO-BG designs were tran-
siently expressed in 100-ml ExpiCHO cells, with the SOSIP trimer 
cotransfected with furin. Following GNL purification, the SEC profiles 
of 30 gp140s were generated from a Superdex 200 16/600 column for 
comparison (Fig. 2B). Overall, UFO-BG produced pure trimer pro-
tein up to 53- and 5-fold more than SOSIP and UFO, respectively. 
For all 10 Envs, except for BG505, SOSIPs showed a large propor-
tion of aggregates (at volumes of 40 to 50 ml in the SEC profile) ac-
companied by an extremely low yield and sometimes the absence of 
a trimer peak. UFOs showed considerably improved trimer yield and 
purity, most notably for two clade C strains, although not for clade 
A/E. UFO-BGs demonstrated unparalleled trimer yield and purity for 
8 of 10 strains, with no or only slight hints of dimers and monomers. 
All 30 gp140 proteins were then characterized by BN-PAGE (fig. 
S2A). Overall, UFO-BG markedly reduced the dimer and monomer 
content with respect to SOSIP and UFO, showing a trimer band 
across all SEC fractions and only occasionally faint bands of lower 
molecular weight. On the basis of this finding, we compared the total 
Env protein obtained from a GNL column against the pooled trimer 
protein after SEC and fraction analysis. GNL purification alone yielded 
comparable purity for all UFO-BG trimers, except for those derived 
from a tier 2 clade B strain and a tier 3 clade B/C strain (Fig. 2C). Next, 
thermal stability was assessed for eight purified UFO-BG trimers using 
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Fig. 2D and fig. S2B). No-
tably, the DSC profiles exhibited a clade- or strain-specific pattern, 
with the thermal denaturation midpoint (Tm) ranging from 60.9° to 
68.4°C. Among the eight UFO-BG trimers tested, BG505 displayed 
the highest Tm (68.4°C), which was followed by two clade C trimers 
(65.2° to 66.2°C). The DSC data largely reflected the thermal stabil-
ity of gp41ECTO-stabilized Envs in the absence of additional disulfide 
bonds and cavity-filling mutations. Additional DSC data for selected 
constructs revealed that the further enhanced thermal stability of 
UFO-BG trimers was a result of gp41ECTO swapping (fig. S2C). The 
expression system had negligible effect on Env thermal stability, as 
ExpiCHO- and 293 F–expressed trimers showed almost identical 
Tm values (fig. S2D). It should be noted that the CN54 UFO and UFO-BG 
constructs contained 14 mutations (CN54M14), which reduced ag-
gregates for 293 F–produced trimers (fig. S2E). Four UFO-BG trimers 
were randomly selected from clades B, C, and B/C for expression in 
293 F cells and SEC characterization (fig. S2F). UFO-BG was found to 
improve trimer properties regardless of the expression system but 
achieved optimal purity when produced in ExpiCHO cells.
Our results thus confirm that gp41ECTO is the primary source of 
metastability and BG505 gp41ECTO of the UFO design can be used to 
stabilize diverse Envs. Notably, Env stabilization by BG505 gp41ECTO 
of the SOSIP design was recently reported (60, 61), but the trigger of 
Env metastability—the HR1 bend (36)—is still present in the result-
ing trimers. For UFO-BG trimers, the similar purity before and after 
SEC suggests that a simple and cost-effective manufacturing solu-
tion can be achieved. The inherent high purity of UFO-BG trimers 
should also accelerate the development and clinical testing of nucleic 
acid vaccine strategies (62–64).
Structural characterization of the UFO-BG trimers
While biochemical and biophysical properties are informative, struc-
tures would provide the most convincing evidence that the UFO-BG 
trimers are an accurate mimic of the native Env (45). The clade B 
H078.14 gp140 construct was selected for crystallization screening, 
as the trimer structure for a tier 3 neutralization-resistant isolate had 
yet to be determined. Briefly, this UFO-BG trimer was produced in 
293 F cells with kifunensine treatment to inhibit the formation of 
complex-type glycans and then purified with a 2G12 affinity column 
followed by SEC on a Superdex 200 16/600 column. Cocrystalliza-
tion with antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) of bNAbs PGT124 and 
35O22 resulted in a complex structure at a resolution of 4.6 Å (Fig. 3A, 
left, and fig. S3A). Overall, the H078.14 UFO-BG trimer adopts a 
native-like Env conformation closely resembling that of BG505 
SOSIP [Protein Data Bank (PDB): 5CEZ, 3.03 Å] and HR1-redesigned 
(PDB: 5JS9, 6.92 Å) trimers (22, 36), with global C root mean square 
deviations of 0.36 and 1.09 Å, respectively (Fig. 3A, middle). Small 
differences were noted at the HR1 bend and the first turn of HR1 
central C-terminal helix after structural superposition of gp41ECTO 
(Fig. 3A, right). Crystallographic analysis at this moderate resolu-
tion thus confirmed that BG505 gp41ECTO of the UFO design, with a 
minimal level of metastability, can be used to stabilize diverse HIV-1 
Envs in a prefusion state, in addition to providing the first structural 
model for a tier 3 neutralization-resistant Env spike. Negative-stain 
EM was used to characterize eight UFO-BG trimers that showed sub-
stantial purity in SEC and BN-PAGE (Fig. 2, B and C). As indicated by 
the two-dimensional (2D) class averages, 67 to 100% of GNL-purified 
Env protein appeared to be native-like trimers (Fig. 3B and fig. S3B). Sim-
ilar results were reported for the SOSIP trimers only after purification

using bNAb affinity columns (9, 24–26, 32, 65). To summarize, crystal-
lographic and EM analyses validated the structural integrity of UFO-BG 
trimers derived from five subtypes, supporting the notion that UFO-BG 
is a general and effective strategy for trimer stabilization.
Antigenic evaluation of UFO and UFO-BG trimers
Following structural characterization, the effect of gp41ECTO substi-
tution on trimer antigenicity was assessed by BLI (Fig. 4A and fig. S4). 
To this end, we compared the UFO-BG trimers to the UFO trimers 
containing WT gp41ECTO and a generic GS linker at the HR1 bend 
(36). Following GNL and SEC purification, trimer proteins were 
tested for antibody binding on Octet RED96, as previously described 
(36). A panel of 11 bNAbs was used to assess conserved neutralizing 
epitopes on the trimer surface, including the V2 apex recognized by 
PGDM1400 (12), PGT145 (55), and PG16 (66); the N332 supersite 
recognized by PGT121, PGT128, PGT135 (55), and 2G12 (67); the

and 10 UFO-BG trimers (right) against 11 bNAbs and 8 non-NAbs. Sensorgrams were obtained from an Octet RED96 using a trimer titration series of six concentrations 
(200 to 6.25 nM by twofold dilution) and are shown in fig. S4. The peak values at the highest concentration are summarized in the matrix, in which cells are colored in red

UFO and UFO-BG trimers, the average peak value (AVE) and SD are listed for each antibody in the two matrices. P values calculated from paired t test are listed in the last 
column of the UFO-BG matrix, with statistically significant P values (<0.05) highlighted in gray. (B) Top-down view of the H078.14 UFO-BG trimer apex and zoomed-in

by far the most complete antigenic profiles for these HIV-1 subtypes 
(Fig. 4A). Overall, both UFO trimer designs exhibited largely similar 
antigenic properties with clade-specific patterns. Notably, trimers 
derived from clade B 6240.08.TA5.4622 and H078.14 were poorly 
recognized by apex-directed bNAbs while shielding the immuno-
dominant V3 and gp41 epitopes more effectively than trimers of other 
clades. However, this reduced non-NAb recognition of the distal V3 
and gp41 epitopes was accompanied by enhanced non-NAb binding 
to the CD4bs and the CD4i epitope, suggesting localized antigenic 
features specific to these two clade B Envs. The trimers derived from 
A/E-recombinant strains displayed similar antigenic patterns, with 
relatively weak binding to most of the antibodies tested. Notably, 
the substitution of WT gp41ECTO with BG505 gp41ECTO of the UFO 
design was found to significantly improve trimer binding to bNAbs 
VRC01, PGT151, and 35O22, with P values (paired t test) of 0.0229, 
0.0269, and 0.0407, respectively. This improved bNAb recognition 
was likely due to a more stable gp120 conformation (for VRC01) and 
a restored quaternary epitope at the gp120-gp41 interface (for PGT151 
and 35O22). However, this gp41ECTO swapping exerted a more com-
plicated effect on other bNAb epitopes, causing small variations in 
peak signal and, in some cases, binding kinetics. For example, for 
clade A tier 2 Q842-d12, the UFO-BG trimer bound to PGDM1400 
and PG16 with a faster association rate than the UFO trimer, whereas 
the B/C-recombinant CN54 trimer showed a decreased on-rate in 
PGDM1400 and PGT145 binding after gp41ECTO swapping (fig. S4, 
B and G). For five selected Envs, we also assessed CD4 binding to 
SOSIP, UFO, and UFO-BG trimers using BLI and CD4-Ig (immuno-
globulin), revealing a strain-specific rather than a design-specific pat-
tern (fig. S4K). Nonetheless, systematic antigenic profiling by BLI 
confirmed that UFO-BG trimers present a close antigenic mimic of 
the native Env.
Structure-informed optimization of a tier 3  
clade B UFO-BG trimer
Even with a medium-resolution structure (Fig. 3A), the H078.14 UFO-BG 
trimer provides a valuable template for vaccine design, as it only bound 
to three of eight non-NAbs (Fig. 4A). However, it is imperative to first 
determine the cause of poor bNAb binding to the V2 apex, which ap-
peared to be inconsistent with the native-like prefusion trimer con-
formation. To this end, we superposed the apices of H078.14 UFO-BG 
and BG505 SOSIP trimer structures (22) for visual inspection, which re-
vealed a short insertion at the tip of the V2 hairpin, an additional N-linked 
glycan at position N171 (HXB2 numbering), and a shortened V2 loop 
(Fig. 4B). On the basis of the sequence alignment and the crystal struc-
ture, we identified two more residues in strand C that may have desta-
bilized the V2 apex. Specifically, the inward-facing Q170 and V172 in 
BG505 are now replaced with charged bulky residues R170 and E172 
in H078.14 (Fig. 4C). On the basis of this information, we sought to op-
timize the H078.14 UFO-BG trimer by restoring the V2 apex with a tri-
ple mutation in strand C (Q156N/R170Q/E172V, Q156N to restore this 
N-glycosylation site) and a deletion at the tip of the V2 hairpin (KDGS) 
and by blocking the CD4 binding–induced conformational change 
with an I201C-A433C disulfide bond (28, 35). As shown in SEC and 
BN-PAGE, the modified H078.14 UFO-BG trimer retained the same 
level of yield and purity as the original construct (Fig. 4D, left and mid-
dle). In BLI assays, this trimer was well recognized by PGDM1400, 
but still less effectively by PG16, while showing notably reduced 
binding to a CD4i non-NAb, 17b (Fig. 4D, right). Our analysis thus con-
firmed that H078.14 can evade apex bNAbs through mutations in 
strand C and surrounding loops. The additional glycan at N171 may 
have little effect on apex bNAb binding as it points sideways in the crys-
tal structure (Fig. 4B, left). However, we noted that clade B 6240.08.
TA5.4622, which also showed poor trimer binding to apex bNAbs, has 
the same amino acids as BG505 at those positions critical to H078.14 
(Fig. 4C), suggesting that this tier 2 virus must use a different mech-
anism to shield its apex.
Envelope metastability has an evolutionary root
The genetic diversity of HIV-1 has been extensively studied (70) and 
is considered a crucial factor for vaccine design (71, 72). Envs ob-
tained from T/F viruses or derived from a sequence database by phy-
logeny, which both represent ancestral states of HIV-1, have been 
evaluated as vaccine immunogens (73–75). The T/F viruses have been 
found to exhibit greater infectivity relative to chronic viruses (76). 
Considering that BG505 is a T/F virus (77) and that BG505 gp41ECTO 
of the UFO design can stabilize diverse Envs, we hypothesized that 
the superior infectivity of T/F viruses could be a result of greater 
gp41ECTO stability, and hence, the T/F UFO trimers might exhibit higher 
yield, purity, and stability (fig. S5A). To explore this hypothesis, we 
tested UFO and UFO-BG trimers for three T/F strains: clade B B41 
(24, 40, 58), clade C CH505 (78–80), and clade C 1086 (37, 73). Follow-
ing 100-ml ExpiCHO expression and GNL purification, the Env pro-
tein was characterized by SEC (fig. S5B). For clade B T/F B41, UFO and 
UFO-BG trimers showed similar purity, with a greater yield observed 
for UFO-BG. For two clade C T/F Envs, a considerably high trimer 
yield was observed for the UFO-BG design. B41 UFO and CH505 
UFO-BG were then assessed by BLI using a small panel of antibodies, 
both displaying antigenic profiles consistent with native-like trimers 
(fig. S5C). In a recent study, Sullivan et al. (58) screened 852 muta-
tions to improve the antigenicity and stability of a B41 SOSIP tri-
mer. In another study, Guenaga et al. (37) screened various glycine 
substitutions in the HR1 bend in addition to other stabilizing muta-
tions to improve the 1086 NFL trimer. Our results suggest that UFO 
and UFO-BG may provide a simple and effective alternative to the 
large-scale screening-based approaches for engineering native-like 
T/F trimers.
We next explored the UFO design using a consensus gp41ECTO 
derived from the available Env sequences in the database, designated 
UFO-C (fig. S5D). If such a UFO-C design is proven successful, then 
it will provide further evidence for the evolutionary root of meta-
stability, as consensus has been considered a simple approximation 
to the ancestral state in HIV-1 evolution (72, 81, 82). To this end, we 
derived a consensus gp41ECTO from 6670 full-length Env sequences 
(www.hiv.lanl.gov/) with the HR1 bend replaced by a generic HR1 
linker, as reported in our previous study (36). The UFO-C constructs 
were created for five Envs of different subtypes and characterized by 
SEC following ExpiCHO expression and GNL purification (fig. S5E). 
Overall, UFO-C outperformed SOSIP and UFO for five and three 
Envs, respectively, displaying improved trimer yield and purity. For 
clade A BG505, UFO-C exhibited a SEC profile similar to that of UFO 
but with slightly increased aggregates and decreased trimer yield. 
This result confirmed that consensus gp41ECTO can recapitulate, in 
large part, the inherent features of BG505 gp41ECTO. UFO-C appeared 
to be least effective for a tier 3 B/C-recombinant strain, CH115.12, 
for which UFO-BG was also less successful than for other Envs (Fig. 2B). 
In terms of thermal stability, UFO-C trimers showed a reduction of 
Tm in the range of 3.5° to 5.5°C compared to their respective UFO-BG 
trimers (fig. S5F). UFO-C trimers derived from clade A and B Envs

were further validated by BN-PAGE and showed no difference in 
purity before and after SEC (fig. S5G). Consistently, negative-stain 
EM confirmed that more than 90% of UFO-C trimers were native like 
(fig. S5H). Last, BLI was used to assess the antigenicity of five UFO-C 
trimers (fig. S5I). In general, UFO-C exhibited antigenic profiles on 
par with UFO-BG for Envs of clades A and B but not of others. To-
gether, the results suggest that consensus gp41ECTO is a promising 
design but will require further optimization to achieve the same lev-
el of stability as BG505 gp41ECTO.
Nanoparticle presentation of UFO-BG trimers derived  
from diverse subtypes
It has been well established that nanoparticle display of antigens elic-
its stronger immune responses than non-arrayed antigens (83–86). 
However, creating trimer-presenting nanoparticles by the gene fu-
sion approach has proven difficult and was only reported for clade A 
BG505 (46, 87). On the surface of these gp140 nanoparticles, gp41ECTO 
would form a “neck” region that connects the gp140 trimer and the 
nanoparticle backbone beneath. Here, we hypothesized that BG505 
gp41ECTO of the UFO design can facilitate both gp140 trimerization 
and nanoparticle assembly (Fig. 5A). To validate this hypothesis, we 
displayed eight UFO-BG trimers of five subtypes on a ferritin (FR) 
nanoparticle, which was previously used to present an HR1-resesigned 
BG505 trimer (46). Briefly, UFO-BG-FR constructs were designed 
by fusing the C terminus of gp41ECTO (residue 664) to the N terminus 
(Asp5) of a ferritin subunit. These constructs were expressed transient-
ly in 100-ml ExpiCHO cells followed by a single-step purification with 
a 2G12 affinity column. BN-PAGE displayed a distinctive band of high 
molecular weight corresponding to well-formed UFO-BG-FR nanopar-
ticles for all eight strains (Fig. 5B). Nanoparticle assembly was further 
confirmed by negative-stain EM, showing a visible core decorated with 
eight trimer spikes protruding from the nanoparticle surface (Fig. 5C 
and fig. S6A). The UFO-BG-FR nanoparticles exhibited greater ther-
mal stability than the respective UFO-BG trimers, with Tm ranging from 
68° to 70°C (fig. S6B). The antigenicity was assessed for five represent-
ative UFO-BG-FR nanoparticles using six bNAbs and four non-NAbs. 
Overall, particulate display retained, and in some cases enhanced, the 
native-like trimer antigenicity, showing patterns specific to epitopes as 
well as HIV-1 subtypes (Fig. 5D and fig. S6C). For the V2 apex, PGDM1400 
bound to all nanoparticles with comparable or notably higher affin-
ity than the corresponding trimers (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the 
displayed trimers have native-like, closed conformations. For clade 
B tier 3 H078.14, the restored binding to apex bNAbs might be ex-
plained by the enhanced stability of V2 hairpin due to molecular 
crowding in the presence of neighboring trimers on the nanoparti-
cle surface (88), whereas for Du172.17 and 93JP_NH1, the increased 
affinity for apex bNAbs was likely a result of avidity. For the N332 
supersite and the CD4bs, particulate display exerted a more favor-
able influence on the H078.14 UFO-BG trimer. For the gp120-gp41 
interface, while all UFO-BG-FR nanoparticles retained the trimer 
binding to PGT151 (15), a cross-clade reduction in 35O22 binding 
was observed due to the constrained angle of approach (13) on the 
ferritin nanoparticle surface. For non-NAbs, UFO-BG-FR nanopar-
ticles displayed similar antigenic profiles to respective UFO-BG tri-
mers, with slightly reduced binding to non-NAbs except for 19b. 
Our results suggest that UFO-BG trimers of diverse subtypes can be 
readily displayed on nanoparticles due to their enhanced gp41ECTO 
stability, thus providing an effective approach for designing heter-
ologous nanoparticle vaccines.
Design of trimer-presenting nanoparticles with built-in  
T cell help
Previously, we designed and characterized gp120 and gp140 nanopar-
ticles based on a large 60-mer, E2p (46). Recently, Hsia et al. (47) 
reported a hyperstable 60-mer (I3-01) resistant to guanidine hydro-
chloride at high temperature. Our database search identified a bac-
terial enzyme from Thermotoga maritima with only five residues 
differing from I3-01 that has been crystallized at a resolution of 2.3 Å 
(PDB: 1VLW) (fig. S6D). Here, we examined the utility of I3-01 for 
designing gp140 nanoparticles. In terms of symmetry (dodecahedron) 
and size (25 nm), I3-01 (Fig. 5E, left) closely resembles E2p (46). 
However, the large spacing between the N termini of I3-01 subunits 
(~50.5 Å) requires a long linker to connect with the C termini of the 
gp140 trimer (29.1 Å) (Fig. 5E, middle). We thus hypothesized that a 
helper T cell epitope may be used not only as a linker between gp140 
and I3-01 but also as an embedded signal to boost T cell response 
and to accelerate Env-specific B cell development toward bNAbs (89). 
To explore this possibility, we designed three constructs, each con-
taining an HR1-redesigned BG505 gp140 (termed gp140.664.R1) 
(36), one of the three selected T cell epitopes [PADRE (90), D, and 
TpD (91)], and an I3-01 subunit (Fig. 5E, right). A fourth construct con-
taining a 10–amino acid (G4S)2 linker was included for comparison. 
Following furin coexpression in ExpiCHO cells, the 2G12-purified 
protein was characterized by SEC (Fig. 5F). The 10–amino acid GS 
linker resulted in I3-01 nanoparticles of high yield and purity, whereas 
the three T cell epitopes appeared to affect nanoparticle assembly to 
various extents due to their hydrophobic nature. Of the three T cell 
epitopes, PADRE produced nanoparticles of the highest purity, as 
indicated by SEC (Fig. 5F), BN-PAGE (Fig. 5G), and negative-stain 
EM (Fig. 5H). In BLI assays, the gp140.664.R1-PADRE-I3-01 nanopar-
ticle exhibited a desirable antigenic profile with strong bNAb bind-
ing and minimal non-NAb binding (Fig. 5I). To probe the stability 
of this nanoparticle, we designed 10 variants based on the original 
gene of I3-01, 1VLW (fig. S6E). The SEC profiles revealed the impor-
tance of a hydrophobic patch at the dimeric interface that facilitates 
nanoparticle assembly (fig. S6F). Together, we have reengineered a 
hyperstable nanoparticle to display 20 gp41ECTO-stabilized trimers 
on the surface with a built-in T cell help signal.
Nanoparticles potently activate B cells expressing bNAbs
Previously, we demonstrated that various BG505 gp120 and gp140 
nanoparticles could engage B cells expressing cognate VRC01 re-
ceptors (46). Here, we assessed the degree of B cell activation by five 
UFO-BG-FR nanoparticles and a BG505 gp140.664.R1-PADRE-I3-01 
nanoparticle with respect to trimers (Fig. 6A and fig. S7A). B cell 
lines expressing bNAbs PGT145, VRC01, and PGT121 (92) were used 
in this assay. Overall, nanoparticles stimulated bNAb-expressing 
B cells more effectively than trimers, with peak signals approaching 
the maximal activation by ionomycin. However, the results also re-
vealed an epitope-dependent pattern: When tested in B cells express-
ing bNAb PGT121, which recognize the N332 supersite, some trimers 
and all nanoparticles rendered detectable Ca2+ flux signals; in con-
trast, none and few trimers activated B cells expressing PGT145 and 
VRC01, which target the V2 apex and the CD4bs, respectively. The 
stimulation of PGT145-expressing B cells by H078.14 UFO-BG-FR 
provides further evidence that the apex can be stabilized by neighbor-
ing trimers on the nanoparticle surface, consistent with the BLI data 
(Fig. 5D). A similar effect was also observed for clade A/E 93JP_NH1 
UFO-BG-FR, which bound to PGT121 only weakly by BLI but induced

a strong Ca2+ flux signal in PGT121-expressing B cells, suggesting 
that cross-linking of B cell receptors (BCRs) by nanoparticles may 
help overcome the inherent low affinity of trimers. As a result, these 
nanoparticles will likely elicit a more effective NAb response than 
trimers, thus providing more promising vaccine immunogens.
Rapid induction of tier 2 neutralizing antibodies  
in mice and rabbits
Here, we performed animal immunization to assess gp41ECTO- 
stabilized trimers and nanoparticles derived from an HR1-redesigned 
BG505 gp140 construct, termed gp140.664.R1, which has been char-
acterized previously (36) and in this study. This construct is paren-
tal to BG505 UFO, which adds a cleavage site linker, and all UFO-BGs, 
which replace WT gp41ECTO with BG505 gp41ECTO of the UFO design, 
because they all contain BG505 gp41ECTO with a redesigned HR1 bend. 
The high purity, yield, and stability as well as native-like structure and 
antigenicity of UFO-BG trimers, in large part, originate from this 
construct. Thus, the in vivo properties of this gp140 construct and its 
nanoparticles are likely common to most UFO-BGs and their nanopar-
ticles. To obtain an initial readout of immunogenicity, we first assessed 
these Env antigens in WT mice. In a previous study, BG505 SOSIP 
trimers failed to elicit autologous tier 2 NAb response to BG505.T332N 
in WT mice after 18 weeks (38). It was concluded that the glycan shield 
of native-like trimers is impenetrable to murine antibodies due to their 
short heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) 
loops. Here, we immunized WT BALB/c mice three times with 3-week 
intervals to test eight trimers and four nanoparticles (Fig. 6B and fig. 
S7B, top panel). PIKA, a Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist with en-
hanced T cell and antibody responses reported for a phase 1 rabies 
vaccine trial (93), was used as an adjuvant. IgG was purified from 
immunized mouse serum to eliminate nonspecific antiviral activity 
present in the mouse sera (38). We assessed the group-combined IgGs 
with trimer and epitope probes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) (fig. S7B). Mouse IgGs elicited by trimers produced in 
293 F and ExpiCHO cells (groups 1 and 2) bound differentially to the 
293 F–expressed probes, supporting our findings in glycan and B cell 
repertoire analyses (Fig. 1, D and E). The three scaffolded gp140.681.
R1 trimers (groups 3 to 5) elicited stronger antibody responses than 
the parent gp140.664.R1 trimer (group 2), consistent with our pre-
vious study (56). While the ferritin nanoparticle (group 6) showed a 
high level of N332-specific IgG response, all three I3-01 nanoparticles 
(groups 10 to 12) outperformed the respective trimers containing 
the same T cell epitopes (groups 7 to 9). We then evaluated the neu-
tralization of group-combined IgGs (3 to 8 mg/ml) in TZM-bl assays 
(fig. S7C). Autologous tier 2 neutralization was observed for a scaf-
folded gp140.681.R1 trimer (group 3), a ferritin nanoparticle (group 6), 
and two I3-01 60-mers (groups 10 and 11), but not for soluble trimers. 
When the starting IgG concentration was reduced to 1 mg/ml in neu-
tralization assays, group 3 showed a borderline response, whereas 
one mouse in group 6 and two mice in group 10 generated autologous 
tier 2 NAbs against BG505.T332N at week 8 (Fig. 6B). The mouse im-
munization data suggested a potential correlation between antigen 
valency (the number of trimers presented on an antigen) and rapid 
elicitation of tier 2 NAbs.
Subsequent analysis was performed on the BG505 gp140.664.R1 
trimer (36) and its ferritin nanoparticle (46) in rabbits with five in-
tramuscular injections over 28 weeks (Fig. 6C). Rabbit plasma col-
lected at six time points during immunization were analyzed by 
ELISA with a trimer probe and an N332-specific probe (Fig. 6C and 
fig. S7D). Overall, rabbits in the trimer group yielded comparable 
median effective concentration (EC50) titers that increased steadily 
over time, whereas rabbits in the ferritin group exhibited a stronger 
and more rapid antibody response with varying EC50 titers. In the 
ferritin group, rabbit 65 showed a midpoint titer of a trimer-specific 
response that was 7- to 12-fold greater than that of others at week 6, 
and rabbit 63 reached a high level of antibody response at week 22. 
A similar trend was observed in ELISA binding of the N332 probe: 
The ferritin group showed mean midpoint 3.6- and 2.1-fold greater 
than the trimer group at weeks 6 and 22, respectively, with a statis-
tically significant P value (0.0471) found for week 6. The elevated 
binding antibody titers might be linked to greater neutralizing activ-
ity. To examine this possibility, we conducted TZM-bl neutralization 
assays longitudinally (Fig. 6C and fig. S7E). The ferritin nanoparti-
cle induced autologous tier 2 NAbs to BG505.T332N more effective-
ly than the trimer, showing a higher percent neutralization at the 
first point of the sample dilution series (50-fold). At week 6, all rab-
bits in the ferritin group exhibited consistent autologous tier 2 neu-
tralization, whereas the trimer group did not induce these detectable 
tier 2 NAbs until week 14 (fig. S7E). A statistical analysis found that 
the tier 2 NAb response was significantly different between the fer-
ritin group and the trimer group for week 6 (P < 0.0001), week 14 
(P = 0.0016), week 22 (P = 0.0330), and week 30 (P = 0.0016). Both 
trimer and ferritin groups showed tier 1 neutralizing activity against 
clade B SF162 starting at week 6, with greater ID50 titers observed for 
the trimer group, which was consistent with the mouse data (Fig. 6B), 
although this finding is not statistically significant. Last, the week 22 
samples were analyzed against a global panel of 12 viruses using the 
preimmunization samples as a control (fig. S7, F and G). Neutraliza-
tion against isolate p398F1 within the same subtype as BG505 (clade A) 
was observed for both trimer and ferritin groups with ID50 titers in 
the range of 53 to 290, while cross-neutralization was detected for 
other subtypes at low titers, as indicated by the percent neutraliza-
tion 2-fold greater than the control at the 20- and 60-fold dilutions.
Our results demonstrate the superior immunogenicity of nanopar-
ticles displaying gp41ECTO-stabilized trimers in small animals when 
compared to trimers alone and confirm the difficulty of eliciting a 
rapid tier 2 NAb response with soluble trimers independent of the 
design platform (26, 39–41). The immunogenicity of gp140 nanopar-
ticles can be improved by optimizing the vaccine regimen (42) or 
using larger 60-mers designed here and in our previous study (46).
DISCUSSION
Antibody-based HIV-1 vaccines aim to elicit antibodies capable of 
neutralizing tier 2 strains, thus preventing the acquisition of infection 
(2). The advent of the BG505 SOSIP.644 gp140 trimer and structur-
al analysis of trimers based on SOSIP and other designs have estab-
lished native-like trimers as a promising vaccine platform (44, 45). 
These native-like trimers have elicited autologous tier 2 NAb response 
in rabbits and NHPs following 6 to 12 months of immunization 
(40–42, 87). The failure for SOSIP trimers to elicit tier 2 NAbs in WT 
mice has been attributed to the dense glycan shield and short HCDR3 
loops of murine antibodies (38). Design of virus-like particles pre-
senting native-like Env spikes (94) and induction of high-quality 
T follicular helper cells (89) were also deemed critical for developing 
effective HIV-1 vaccine candidates.
Here, we addressed these critical issues in HIV-1 vaccine devel-
opment with a strategy that focused primarily on Env metastability.

Previously, we identified the HR1 bend in gp41ECTO as the primary 
cause of Env metastability and developed the UFO platform—con-
taining a redesigned HR1 bend and a cleavage site linker—for tri-
mer stabilization (36). In this study, we demonstrated that gp41ECTO 
is the main source of metastability by replacing gp41ECTO of diverse 
Envs with BG505 gp41ECTO of the UFO design and revealed the evo-
lutionary root of metastability by analyzing UFO trimers of three 
T/F strains and with a consensus gp41ECTO. The importance of 
gp41ECTO stability for nanoparticle vaccines was illustrated by design-
ing ferritin nanoparticles for diverse subtypes and incorporating 
T cell help into a large 60-mer, which was only possible when gp41ECTO 
has minimized metastability. A subset of gp41ECTO-stabilized trimers 
and gp140 nanoparticles derived from the HR1-redesigned BG505 
gp140 construct, gp140.664.R1 (36), was assessed in WT mice and 
rabbits, revealing a critical factor in tier 2 NAb elicitation that has not 
been apparent or clear in current trimer vaccines: Nanoparticles can 
induce tier 2 NAbs more effectively than individual trimers, indi-
cating a correlation between antigen valency and tier 2 NAb elicita-
tion. High-quality UFO trimers and nanoparticles can be produced 
in ExpiCHO cells with substantial yield and purity, bearing important 
implications for vaccine manufacture.
Future investigation should be directed toward optimization and 
evaluation of the large, 60-meric I3-01 and E2p nanoparticles, which 
would be expected to be more effective than the ferritin nanoparticle in 
the elicitation of tier 2 NAbs. Nanoparticles presenting gp41ECTO- 
stabilized trimers of diverse subtypes, when used in a cocktail or se-
quentially, may be more capable of generating rapid NAb response to 
each subtype and thus conferring broad protection against HIV-1.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Antibodies
We used a panel of bNAbs and non-NAbs to characterize the anti-
genicity of various native-like trimers and gp140 nanoparticles. Anti-
bodies were requested from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) AIDS 
Reagent Program (www.aidsreagent.org/) except for bNAbs PGDM1400, 
PGT145, PGT121, and PGT151 and non-NAb 19b, which were pro-
vided by D.S. and D.R.B. Soluble CD4 in an Ig form (CD4-Ig, catalog 
no. 12960) was also obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program.
Expression and purification of HIV-1 Env trimers  
and nanoparticles
Trimers were transiently expressed in HEK293 F or ExpiCHO cells 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) except for crystallographic analysis in 
which HEK293 F cells were treated with kifunensine. The protocol 
used for trimer production in HEK293 F cells has been described 
previously (36, 56). For cleaved HR1-redesigned trimers, the furin 
plasmid was added during transfection. The protocol for trimer 
and nanoparticle production in ExpiCHO cells is as follows. Briefly, 
ExpiCHO cells were thawed and incubated with ExpiCHO Expres-
sion Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a shaker incubator at 37°C, 
with 135 rpm and 8% CO2. When the cells reached a density of 10 × 
106 ml−1, ExpiCHO Expression Medium was added to reduce cell den-
sity to 6 × 106 ml−1 for transfection. The ExpiFectamine CHO/plasmid 
DNA complexes were prepared for 100-ml transfection in ExpiCHO 
cells following the manufacturer’s instructions. For SOSIP and HR1- 
redesigned trimers as well as the I3-01 nanoparticles presenting an 
HR1-redesigned trimer of the BG505 strain, 80 g of antigen plasmid, 
30 g of furin plasmid, and 320 l of ExpiFectamine CHO reagent 
were mixed in 7.7 ml of cold OptiPRO medium (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific), whereas for UFO trimers (including UFO-BG and UFO-C) 
as well as UFO-BG-FR nanoparticles, 100 g of antigen plasmid was 
used without furin. After the first feed on day 1, ExpiCHO cells were 
cultured in a shaker incubator at 32°C, with 120 rpm and 8% CO2 
following the Max Titer protocol with an additional feed on day 5 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Culture supernatants were harvested 13 
to 14 days after transfection, clarified by centrifugation at 4000 rpm 
for 20 min, and filtered using a 0.45-m filter (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific). For trimers, Env protein was extracted from the culture super-
natants using a GNL column (Vector Labs), whereas for nanoparticles, 
Env fusion protein was purified using a 2G12 affinity column. Some 
trimers were further purified by SEC on a Superdex 200 Increase 
10/300 GL column or a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 PG column 
(GE Healthcare). The purity of I3-01 nanoparticles was character-
ized by SEC on a Superose 6 10/300 GL column. For both trimers and 
nanoparticles, protein concentration was determined using UV280 
absorbance with theoretical extinction coefficients.
Analysis of total and site-specific glycosylation profiles
The total glycan profiles of ExpiCHO and 293 F–produced trimers were 
generated by HILIC-UPLC. N-linked glycans were enzymatically released 
from Envs via in-gel digestion with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase 
F), subsequently fluorescently labeled with 2-aminobenzoic acid, and 
analyzed by HILIC-UPLC, as previously described (53, 54, 95, 96). Di-
gestion of released glycans with Endo H enabled the quantitation of 
oligomannose-type glycans (95). The composition of the glycans was 
determined by analyzing released glycans from trimers by PNGase 
F digestion using ion mobility MS (53). Negative ion mass, collision- 
induced dissociation, and ion mobility spectra were recorded with a 
Waters SYNAPT G2-Si mass spectrometer (Waters Corp.) fitted with 
a nanoelectrospray ion source. Waters DriftScope (version 2.8) soft-
ware and MassLynx (version 4.1) were used for data acquisition and 
processing. Spectra were interpreted as described previously (97–100). 
The results obtained served as the basis for the creation of sample- 
specific glycan libraries, which were used for subsequent site-specific 
N-glycosylation analyses. For site-specific N-glycosylation analysis, 
before digestion, trimers were denatured and alkylated by incuba-
tion for 1 hour at room temperature in a 50 mM tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer 
containing 6 M urea and 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), followed by 
addition of 20 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for a further 1 hour at room 
temperature in the dark and then additional DTT (20 mM) for 
another 1 hour to eliminate any residual IAA. The alkylated trimers 
were buffer-exchanged into 50 mM tris-HCl (pH 8.0) using Vivaspin 
columns and digested separately with trypsin and chymotrypsin 
(Mass Spectrometry Grade, Promega) at a ratio of 1:30 (w/w). Glyco-
peptides were selected from the protease-digested samples using 
the ProteoExtract Glycopeptide Enrichment Kit (Merck Millipore). 
Enriched glycopeptides were analyzed by LC–electrospray ioniza-
tion MS on an Orbitrap fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific), as previously described (53), using higher-energy colli-
sional dissociation fragmentation. Data analysis and glycopep-
tide identification were performed using Byonic (version 2.7) and 
Byologic software (version 2.3; Protein Metrics Inc.), as previously 
described (53).

G250 loading dye and added to a 4 to 12% bis-tris NuPAGE gel (Life 
Technologies). BN-PAGE gels were run for 2.5 hours at 150 V using 
the NativePAGE running buffer (Life Technologies) according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions.
Differential scanning calorimetry
Thermal stability of UFO, UFO-BG, and UFO-C trimers expressed 
in ExpiCHO and 293 F cells and trimer-presenting nanoparticles 
was measured using a MicroCal VP-Capillary calorimeter (Malvern) 
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer at a scanning rate of 90°C 
hour−1 from 20° to 120°C. Data were analyzed using the VP-Capillary 
DSC automated data analysis software.
Protein production and purification for crystallization
The clade B tier 3 H078.14 UFO-BG trimer was expressed in FreeStyle 
293 F cells treated with kifunensine and purified from culture super-
natant using a 2G12 affinity column followed by SEC. Fabs PGT124 and 
35O22 were transiently transfected into FreeStyle 293F cells (Invitrogen) 
and purified using a LC- capture select column, before further pu-
rification by ion exchange chromatography and SEC on a Superdex 
200 16/600 column. The trimer complexes were prepared by mixing 
H078.14 UFO-BG trimer protein with PGT124 and 35O22 at a molar 
ratio of 1:3.5 for 30 min at room temperature. To decrease glycan 
heterogeneity, deglycosylation was conducted on the PGT124- and 
35O22-bound H078.14 UFO-BG Env protein produced in 293 F cells 
with Endo H (New England Biolabs) overnight at 4°C. The trimer com-
plexes were subjected to crystal trials after further purification by SEC.
Protein crystallization and data collection
The SEC-purified H078.14 UFO-BG trimer complexes were con-
centrated to ~8 mg/ml before being subjected to extensive crystalli-
zation trials at both 4° and 20°C using our automated CrystalMation 
robotic system (Rigaku) at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) 
(101). Crystals for protein complex containing Fab PGT124 and 35O22 
bound to the UFO-BG trimer were obtained from 0.1 M tris (pH 7.4), 
0.2 M lithium sulfate, and 6% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, using 
the sitting drop (0.2 l) vapor diffusion method, and harvested and 
cryoprotected with 30% ethylene glycol, followed by immediate flash 
cooling in liquid nitrogen. The best crystal diffracted to a resolu-
tion of 4.60 Å, and diffraction data were collected at the Advanced 
Photon Source (APS) beamline 23IDB, processed with HKL-2000 
(102), and indexed in space group P63 with 98% completeness with 
the following unit cell parameters: a = b = 127.3 Å and c = 316.3 Å 
(table S1).
Structure determination and refinement
The H078.14 UFO-BG trimer structure bound to PGT124 and 35O22 
was solved by molecular replacement (MR) using Phaser (103) with 
the BG505 SOSIP.664 protomer:35O22 component from a previous 
structure (PDB: 5CEZ) (22), followed by the PGT124 Fab structure 
(PDB: 4R26) (23) as the MR models. The structures were refined using 
Phenix (104), with Coot used for model building (105) and MolProbity 
for structure validation (106). Because of the limited resolution of the 
datasets, two B-factor groups per residue were used in refinement. 
The final Rcryst and Rfree values for complex structure are 31.2 and 
34.0%. Figures were generated with PyMOL and Chimera (107). 
In the crystal structure, residues were numbered according to the 
Kabat definition (108) for the Fabs and according to the HXBc2 sys-
tem for gp140.
Negative-stain EM
UFO-BG trimers, UFO-C trimers, and gp140 trimer-presenting nanopar-
ticles were analyzed by negative-stain EM. A 3-l aliquot containing 
trimers or nanoparticles (~0.01 mg/ml) was applied for 15 s onto a 
carbon-coated 400 Cu mesh grid that had been glow discharged at 
20 mA for 30 s and then negatively stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl for-
mate for 30 s. Data were collected using a FEI Tecnai Spirit electron 
microscope operating at 120 kV, with an electron dose of ~25 e− Å−2 
and a magnification of ×52,000 that resulted in a pixel size of 2.05 Å 
at the specimen plane. Images were acquired with a Tietz 4k × 4k 
TemCam-F416 complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) 
camera using a nominal defocus of 1500 nm and the Leginon package 
(109). UFO-BG trimer particles were selected automatically from the 
raw micrographs using DoG Picker (110), while trimer-presenting 
nanoparticles were selected manually using the Appion Manual Picker 
(111). Both were put into particle stack using the Appion software pack-
age (111). Reference-free 2D class averages were calculated using 
particles binned by two via iterative multivariate statistical analysis/
multireference alignment and sorted into classes (112). To analyze the 
quality of the trimers (native-like and non-native), the reference- 
free 
2D class averages were examined by eye, as previously described (26).
Biolayer interferometry
The kinetics of trimer and nanoparticle binding to bNAbs, non-
NAbs, and CD4-Ig was measured using an Octet Red96 instrument 
(fortéBio, Pall Life Sciences). All assays were performed with agita-
tion set to 1000 rpm in fortéBio 1× kinetic buffer. The final volume for 
all the solutions was 200 l per well. Assays were performed at 30°C 
in solid black 96-well plates (Geiger Bio-One). Antibody (5 g ml−1) in 
1× kinetic buffer was loaded onto the surface of anti-human Fc cap-
ture (AHC) biosensors for 300 s. A 60-s biosensor baseline step was 
applied before the analysis of the association of the antibody on the 
biosensor to the antigen in solution for 200 s. A twofold concentration 
gradient of antigen, starting at 200 nM for trimers and 14 to 35 nM 
for nanoparticles depending on the size, was used in a titration series 
of six. The dissociation of the interaction was followed for 300 s. 
Correction of baseline drift was performed by subtracting the mean 
value of shifts recorded for a sensor loaded with antibody but not 
incubated with antigen and for a sensor without antibody but incubated 
with antigen. Octet data were processed by fortéBio’s data acquisi-
tion software version 8.1. Notably, for apex-directed bNAbs, experi-
mental data were fitted with the binding equations describing a 2:1 
interaction to achieve the optimal fitting results. CD4-Ig binding exper-
iments were performed following the same procedure described 
above. Paired t test in Prism (two groups, n = 10) was used to deter-
mine whether trimer-antibody binding signals were statistically dif-
ferent (P < 0.05) upon gp41ECTO swapping.
B cell activation assay
Generation of K46 B cell lines expressing PGT121, PGT145, or VRCO1 
has been previously described (92). Briefly, K46 cells expressing a 
doxycycline-inducible form of bNAb BCRs were maintained in ad-
vanced Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Gibco), supple-
mented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics, 
and puromycin (2 g/ml; Gibco). Cells were treated overnight in doxy-
cycline (1 g/ml; Clontech) to induce human BCR expression. After 
loading with Indo-1 (Molecular Probes) at 1 M for 1 hour at 37°C, washed 
cells were stimulated with the indicated agents at a concentration of 
10 g ml−1: anti-mouse IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch), UFO-BG

or an HR1-redesigned gp140 trimer (36) with a T helper epitope 
(PADRE) fused to the C terminus, and UFO-BG-FR or I3-01 nanopar-
ticle presenting an HR1-redesigned gp140 trimer. Calcium mobili-
zation was assessed on an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). 
In each run, the unstimulated B cells were first recorded for 60 s; 
immunogen was added, mixed thoroughly, and recorded for 180 s; 
and then 1 l of ionomycin (1 g ml−1; Sigma) was added and re-
corded for another 60 s to verify Indo loading.
Immunization and serum IgG purification
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guide-
lines were followed with animal subjects tested in the immunization 
study. Seven-week-old BALB/c mice were purchased from the Jackson 
Laboratory. The mice were housed in ventilated cages in environ-
mentally controlled rooms at TSRI, in compliance with an approved 
IACUC protocol and AAALAC (Association for Assessment and 
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care) International guidelines. At 
week 0, each mouse was immunized with 200 l of antigen/adjuvant 
mix containing 50 g of antigen and 100 l of the AddaVax adjuvant 
(InvivoGen) or 50 l of the PIKA adjuvant (Yisheng Biopharma) as 
per the manufacturer’s instruction via the intraperitoneal route. At 
weeks 3 and 6, the animals were boosted with 50 g of antigen for-
mulated in the AddaVax or PIKA adjuvant. At week 8, the animals 
were terminally bled through the retro-orbital membrane using hep-
arinized capillary tubes. Samples were diluted with an equal volume 
of PBS and then overlaid on 4.5 ml of Ficoll/Histopaque in a 15-ml 
SepMate tube (STEMCELL Technologies) and spun at 1200 rpm for 
10 min at 20°C to separate plasma and cells. The plasma was heat 
inactivated at 56°C for 1 hour, spun at 1200 rpm for 10 min, and ster-
ile filtered. The cells were washed once in PBS and then resuspended 
in 1 ml of ACK red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer (Lonza). After two 
rounds of washing with PBS, peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs) were resuspended in 2 ml of BAMBANKER Freezing 
Media (Lymphotec Inc.). Spleens were also harvested and grounded 
against a 40-m cell strainer (BD Falcon) to release splenocytes into 
a cell suspension. The cells were centrifuged, washed in PBS, treated 
with 10 ml of RBC lysis buffer as per the manufacturer’s specifica-
tions, and resuspended in BAMBANKER Freezing Media for cell 
freezing. One-third of the total serum per mouse, or 600 l of 
serum, was purified using a 0.2-ml protein G spin kit (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified IgGs 
from four mice in each group were combined for characterization 
by ELISA binding and initial neutralization assays, while purified 
IgGs from individual mice in two nanoparticle groups, 6 and 10, 
were used for further analysis of HIV-1 neutralization in TZM-bl 
assays. Rabbit immunization and blood sampling were carried out 
under a subcontract at Covance (Denver, PA). Two groups of fe-
male New Zealand White rabbits, four rabbits per group, were im-
munized intramuscularly with 30 g of the trimer or nanoparticle 
formulated in 250 l of adjuvant AddaVax (InvivoGen) with a total 
volume of 500 l, at weeks 0, 4, 12, 20, and 28. Blood samples, 15 ml 
each time, were collected at day −10 and weeks 1, 6, 14, 22, and 28, 
as shown in Fig. 6C. Plasma was separated from blood and heat in-
activated for ELISA binding and neutralization assays.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
Each well of a Costar 96-well assay plate (Corning) was first coated 
with 50 l of PBS containing 0.2 g of the appropriate antigens. The 
plates were incubated overnight at 4°C and then washed five times 
with wash buffer containing PBS and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. Each 
well was then coated with 150 l of a blocking buffer consisting of 
PBS, blotting-grade blocker (20 mg ml−1; Bio-Rad), and 5% (v/v) 
fetal bovine serum. The plates were incubated with the blocking buf-
fer for 1 hour at room temperature and then washed five times with 
wash buffer. In the mouse sample analysis, purified IgGs were diluted 
in the blocking buffer to a maximum concentration of 100 g ml−1, 
whereas in the rabbit sample analysis, heat-inactivated plasma was 
diluted by 50-fold in the blocking buffer; both samples were sub-
jected to a 10-fold dilution series. For each sample dilution, a total 
volume of 50 l was added to the wells. Each plate was incubated for 
1 hour at room temperature and then washed five times with wash 
buffer. A 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase–labeled goat anti- 
mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab-
oratories) was then made in the wash buffer, with 50 l of this diluted 
secondary antibody added to each well. The plates were incubated 
with the secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature and 
then washed five times with wash buffer. Last, the wells were developed 
with 50 l of 3,3′, 5,5;-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Life Technologies) 
for 3 to 5 min before stopping the reaction with 50 l of 2 N sulfuric acid. 
The resulting plate readouts were measured at a wavelength of 450 nm.
Pseudovirus production and neutralization assays
Pseudoviruses were generated by transfection of 293 T cells with an 
HIV-1 Env-expressing plasmid and an Env-deficient genomic back-
bone plasmid (pSG3Env), as described previously (113). HIV-1 Env- 
expressing vectors for BG505 (catalog no. 11518), SF162 (catalog no. 
10463), and the global panel (catalog no. 12670) were obtained through 
the NIH AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, National Insti-
tute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH (www.aidsreagent.org/). 
A T332N mutation was introduced into BG505 Env to produce the 
BG505.T332N clone. Pseudoviruses were harvested 72 hours after 
transfection for use in neutralization assays. Neutralizing activity of 
purified mouse serum IgGs or heat-inactivated rabbit plasma was 
assessed using a single round of replication pseudovirus assay and 
TZM-bl target cells, as described previously (113). Briefly, pseudovirus 
was incubated with serial dilutions of mouse serum IgG or rabbit plas-
ma in a 96-well flat-bottom plate for 1 hour at 37°C before TZM-bl 
cells were seeded in the plate. In the analysis of rabbit samples against 
autologous clade A tier 2 BG505.T332N and clade B tier 1 SF162, 
the plasma was diluted by 50-fold and subjected to a 3-fold dilution 
series in the TZM-bl assays. Luciferase reporter gene expression was 
quantified 48 to 72 hours after infection upon lysis and addition of 
Bright-Glo Luciferase substrate (Promega). Data were retrieved from 
a BioTek microplate reader with Gen 5 software, the average back-
ground luminescence from a series of uninfected wells was sub-
tracted from each experimental well, and neutralization curves were 
generated using GraphPad Prism 6.0, in which values from experi-
mental wells were compared against a well containing virus only. 
To determine ID50 values, dose-response curves were fit by nonlinear 
regression in Prism. Unpaired t test (nonparametric) in Prism was 
used to determine whether the two rabbit groups immunized with 
trimer and ferritin nanoparticle (two groups, n = 14 when antibody 
titer was used or n = 8 when percent neutralization with duplicates 
was used) were significantly different (P < 0.05) in plasma binding 
and neutralization. Rabbit plasma neutralization against a global 
panel of 12 isolates was briefly assessed for two time points, before 
immunization (day −10) and week 22, without duplicates. To increase 
the sensitivity of detection, rabbit plasma was diluted by 20-fold

followed by a 3-fold dilution series in TZM-bl assays. To reduce false 
positives caused by nonspecific antiviral proteins present in the rab-
bit plasma, a simple metric that directly compares the percent neu-
tralization of the week 22 sample to that of the day −10 sample from 
the same animal subject at the 20- and 60-fold dilutions was used. 
The week 22 signals at both dilutions had to be twofold greater than 
the corresponding day −10 signals for a sample to be considered 
neutralizing a virus clone in the global panel.
Mouse repertoire sequencing and bioinformatics analysis
A 5′-RACE [rapid amplification of complementary DNA (cDNA) ends] 
protocol has been developed for unbiased sequencing of mouse B cell 
repertoires, as previously described (56). Briefly, RNA (including 
mRNA) was extracted from total PBMCs of each mouse into 30 l of 
water with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). 5′-RACE was performed 
with the SMARTer RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech). The 
Ig polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were set up with Platinum Taq 
High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Life Technologies) in a total vol-
ume of 50 l, with 5 l of cDNA as template, 1 l of 5′-RACE primer, 
and 1 l of 10 M reverse primer. The 5′-RACE primer contained a 
PGM/S5 P1 adaptor, while the reverse primer contained a PGM/S5 
A adaptor. We adapted the mouse 3′-C1-3 and 3′-C inner primers 
as reverse primers for 5′-RACE PCR processing of the heavy chains. 
A total of 25 cycles of PCR was performed, and the expected PCR 
products (500 to 600 base pairs) were gel purified (Qiagen). NGS was 
performed on the Ion S5 system. Briefly, heavy-chain libraries from 
the same group were quantitated using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer with 
the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit and then mixed using a ratio of 1:1:1:1 
for sequencing. Template preparation and (Ion 520) chip loading were 
performed on Ion Chef using the Ion 520/530 Ext Kit, followed by 
sequencing on the Ion S5 system with default settings. The mouse anti-
bodyomics pipeline was used to process the raw data and to determine 
the distributions of heavy-chain germline gene usage.
