Abstract
Background: Acute heart failure (AHF) is one of the most common diagnoses assigned to emergency
department (ED) patients who are hospitalized. Despite its high prevalence in the emergency setting, the
diagnosis of AHF in ED patients with undifferentiated dyspnea can be challenging.
Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of
the operating characteristics of diagnostic elements available to the emergency physician for diagnosing
AHF. Secondary objectives were to develop a test–treatment threshold model and to calculate interval
likelihood ratios (LRs) for natriuretic peptides (NPs) by pooling patient-level results.
Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and selected bibliographies were searched from January 1965 to March
2015 using MeSH terms to address the ability of the following index tests to predict AHF as a cause of
dyspnea in adult patients in the ED: history and physical examination, electrocardiogram, chest
radiograph
(CXR),
B-type
natriuretic
peptide
(BNP),
N-terminal
proB-type
natriuretic
peptide
(NT-proBNP), lung ultrasound (US), bedside echocardiography, and bioimpedance. A diagnosis of AHF
based on clinical data combined with objective test results served as the criterion standard diagnosis.
Data were analyzed using Meta-DiSc software. Authors of all NP studies were contacted to obtain
patient-level data. The Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) for
systematic reviews was utilized to evaluate the quality and applicability of the studies included.
Results: Based on the included studies, the prevalence of AHF ranged from 29% to 79%. Index tests with
pooled positive LRs ≥ 4 were the auscultation of S3 on physical examination (4.0, 95% confidence interval
[CI] = 2.7 to 5.9), pulmonary edema on both CXR (4.8, 95% CI = 3.6 to 6.4) and lung US (7.4, 95% CI = 4.2
to 12.8), and reduced ejection fraction observed on bedside echocardiogram (4.1, 95% CI = 2.4 to 7.2).
Tests with low negative LRs were BNP < 100 pg/mL (0.11, 95% CI = 0.07 to 0.16), NT-proBNP < 300 pg/
mL (0.09, 95% CI = 0.03 to 0.34), and B-line pattern on lung US LR (0.16, 95% CI = 0.05 to 0.51). Interval
LRs of BNP concentrations at the low end of “positive” results as defined by a cutoff of 100 pg/mL were
substantially lower (100 to 200 pg/mL; 0.29, 95% CI = 0.23 to 0.38) than those associated with higher BNP
concentrations (1000 to 1500 pg/mL; 7.12, 95% CI = 4.53 to 11.18). The interval LR of NT-proBNP
concentrations even at very high values (30,000 to 200,000 pg/mL) was 3.30 (95% CI = 2.05 to 5.31).
Conclusions: Bedside lung US and echocardiography appear to the most useful tests for affirming the
presence of AHF while NPs are valuable in excluding the diagnosis.

 A
cute heart failure (AHF) is defined as a gradual
or rapid deterioration in heart failure signs and
symptoms in need of urgent treatment.1 Dysp-
nea is the most common presenting complaint prompt-
ing AHF patients to seek acute care.2,3 A primary
diagnosis of AHF accounts for approximately one mil-
lion emergency department (ED) visits in the United
States.4 Despite its high prevalence in the ED setting,
diagnosing AHF in ED patients with undifferentiated
dyspnea can be challenging, especially in patients with
advanced age5 and comorbid disease.6 There is no sin-
gle
historical,
physical
examination,
electrocardio-
graphic (ECG) or radiographic finding that can on its
own reliably diagnose or rule out AHF as the cause of
dyspnea. An ED diagnosis of AHF based on history,
physical examination, chest radiograph (CXR), and ECG
is qualified as “uncertain” in 44% of cases7 and is dis-
cordant with the final discharge diagnosis in nearly one
out of every four cases.8–11 Natriuretic peptide (NP) test-
ing improves diagnostic uncertainty for acutely dysp-
neic patients7,12 and is a now a routine component of
the workup of patients with possible AHF.13 However,
even when NP testing is incorporated into the clinical
workup of acute dyspnea, the misclassification rate
remains 14% to 29%.14–17 Other diagnostic modalities
such as bedside echocardiography,18–21 lung ultrasound
(US),22,23 and bioimpedance24,25 have been shown to
help discriminate between AHF and other primary
causes of dyspnea, but their added clinical utility has yet
to be fully characterized.
Reviews and meta-analyses aimed at helping clini-
cians sort through the array of available resources for
evaluation of dyspneic patients have been previously
published, but the most comprehensive of these is now
more than a decade old.26 As new diagnostic modalities
have been integrated into clinical practice and new data
have been published in the ensuing period, the primary
objective of this systematic review was to cohere the
current best evidence concerning the diagnostic accu-
racy of index tests that might help discriminate AHF
from other clinical conditions in patients presenting to
the ED with dyspnea. The index tests evaluated in this
review
include:
clinical
history,
symptoms,
physical
examination
findings,
ECG,
CXR,
B-type
natriuretic
peptide (BNP), N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide
(NT-proBNP), lung US, ED-based bedside echocardiog-
raphy, and bioimpedance.
METHODS
Study Design
We conducted a systematic review of studies that exam-
ined the operating test characteristics of the modalities
used by emergency physicians (EPs) for the diagnosis of
AHF among patients presenting to the ED with dysp-
nea. The systematic review was conducted using the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and
Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.27
Search Strategy
The design and manuscript structure of this systematic
review
conform
to
the
recommendations
from
the
Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
(MOOSE)
statement.28
The
medical
literature
was
searched using PubMed and EMBASE from their incep-
tion through March 2015. With the assistance of an
experienced health sciences librarian, the selected Medi-
cal Subject Headings (MeSH) terms heart failure and
dyspnea were individually combined with the MeSH
terms sensitivity and specificity, predictive value of tests,
history taking, physical examination, electrocardiography,
natriuretic
peptide,
ultrasonography,
ultrasonics,
echocardiography, and bioelectrical impedance. Refer-
ences from review articles identified by these searches
were searched for relevant studies. Two authors inde-
pendently screened the search results of each diagnostic
modality of interest.
Studies eligible for inclusion in the systematic review
were those that focused on the diagnosis of AHF in the
ED population. Studies that focused on diagnostic tests
that were not available shortly after ED presentation
were excluded, as were studies that focused on patients
with compensated, chronic heart failure and those that
focused on prognosis or therapeutics. Case studies and
reports or studies published solely in abstract form
were excluded. The search was also restricted to human
studies published in English.
Shortly after this systematic review project began, a
comprehensive systematic review by Hill et al.29 on NPs
for the diagnosis of AHF in the ED was published. All
references identified by Hill et al.29 were screened for
possible inclusion in this review. To avoid duplicating
the PubMed and EMBASE NP searches performed by
Hill et al,29 we limited our search for NP articles using
these databases to a time frame beyond the stop point
of their review (June 2012).
A review author (JLM) was tasked with ensuring that
reported diagnostic data outside of the scope of each
individual search was included in the analysis of the
other relevant diagnostic elements in this review (e.g., a
study identified only by the bioimpedance search strat-
egy that reported BNP data was referred to reviewers
also assigned to BNP/NT-proBNP).
Criteria for Considering Studies for this Review
Types
of
Participants.
We
included
studies
that
recruited adult patients presenting to the ED with dysp-
nea as a primary complaint. The authors chose to
exclude studies that recruited patients who presented to
an urgent care setting, as we felt these patients might
undergo an abbreviated diagnostic workup and likely
represent a different spectrum of AHF than those who
present to the ED with true, emergent dyspnea. Patients
were not excluded based on comorbidities, etiology of
AHF, or the presence of arrhythmia.
Types of Index Tests.
We included studies that used
history, symptoms, and physical examination findings
as index tests for the diagnosis of AHF. Our search for
NP testing was limited to BNP and NT-proBNP since
these are the two most commonly used peptides for the
ED diagnosis of AHF. We did not limit our search to
point-of-care testing, as results from standard NP tests
conducted in a hospital laboratory are typically made
available to EPs during a patient’s ED course. We also
did not limit our search and inclusion to any specific
224
Martindale et al. • DIAGNOSING ACUTE HEART FAILURE IN THE ED
 type of assay. Our search for lung US studies was not
limited to a specific protocol. We narrowed our inclu-
sion of studies investigating lung US and echocardiog-
raphy to those that had EPs both performing and
interpreting these tests. Inclusion of bioimpedance stud-
ies was not limited to any particular type of protocol,
bioimpedance metric, or specific device.
Types of Reference Standard.
Acute heart failure is a
clinical diagnosis, and there are currently no universally
accepted diagnostic criteria to serve as the criterion
standard for AHF in the acute care setting. Previously
published diagnostic criteria (Framingham,30 Boston,31
National
Health
and
Nutrition
Examination
Survey
[NHANES]32) may be used as clinical guides but on their
own lack sensitivity for the diagnosis of AHF.33,34 The
most prevalent accepted criterion standard for diagnos-
tic research in AHF is an adjudicated diagnosis reached
by physicians after retrospective review of inpatient
medical records.7,26,35,36 We therefore chose to include
studies that used as a reference standard a final diagno-
sis of AHF based on adjudication of clinical data by
independent reviewers who were blinded to the study’s
primary index test. We imposed no restrictions on the
timing of the final diagnosis, the type of physician mak-
ing the final diagnosis, or the type of clinical data upon
which the final diagnosis was based.
Data Abstraction.
Two or more authors for each
index test independently selected articles from the com-
bined PubMed/EMBASE search for full text review (his-
tory and physical, JM and AW; CXR, BH and GF; ECG,
JM and AW; NT-proBNP and BNP, SC, DD, and PL;
echocardiography, RS and IdS; lung US, RS and IdS;
bioimpedance, BH and GF). Each reviewer indepen-
dently selected potentially eligible studies before both
authors agreed on the list of studies for full text review.
Differences in study selection were resolved by consen-
sus. Having read the methods sections of the full-text
version of the studies potentially eligible for inclusion,
each author then applied the stated inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria to determine which studies to include in
our systematic review. Differences were resolved by
consensus after discussion and adjudication.
A standardized data collection form (see Data Supple-
ment S1, available as supporting information in the
online version of this paper) was used to abstract data
pertaining to study funding, study location and setting,
patient selection, patient demographics, prevalence of
heart failure, manufacturer of the index test, definition
of a positive diagnostic test, specialist performing and
interpreting the index test, blinding with respect to the
index test and criterion standard, and data incorporated
into the criterion standard diagnosis of AHF. Study
authors were contacted when study methodology or
results required clarification.
Data Analysis
Sensitivities, specificities, and likelihood ratios (LRs)
were calculated based on constructed two-by-two tables
for each included study. To compute meta-analysis sum-
mary estimates when more than one study assessed the
same index test, we combined test characteristic data
using a random-effects model with MetaDiSc37 soft-
ware. Interstudy heterogeneity was assessed for pooled
estimates
of
sensitivity
and
specificity
using
the
DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model.38 Publication
bias, or overrepresentation of studies yielding positive
results in published literature, was not assessed because
a consensus approach toward funnel plot analysis is
lacking for meta-analyses of diagnostic studies.39
BNP and NT-proBNP Analysis
Summary analyses for dichotomous NP results were
performed separately for each type of peptide, assay
manufacturer, and common cutoff value. Cutoff values
within 5 pg/mL for BNP and 50 pg/mL for NT-proBNP
were considered common. Because they are ubiquitous
in clinical practice, and have various decision-making
cut-points, we also used patient-level data to compute
interval LRs for BNP/NT-proBNP. The interval LR repre-
sents the probability of a test result within a user-
defined interval in patients with a criterion standard
diagnosis of AHF divided by the probability of a result
in the same interval in patients with an alternative (non-
AHF) diagnosis.40 To derive patient-level data, we con-
tacted the authors of included studies that examined the
test characteristics of BNP or NT-proBNP and requested
actual patient-level NP results and their associated final
diagnoses (AHF/not AHF).
Quality Assessment
Two authors independently used the revised Quality
Assessment
Tool for
Diagnostic
Accuracy
Studies-2
(QUADAS-2) to evaluate the overall quality of evidence
for included studies relating to each index test.41 The
QUADAS-2 tool assists review authors in making expli-
cit judgments for the risk of bias in four domains of
study methodology: 1) patient selection, 2) index test, 3)
reference standard, and 4) flow and timing. The tool
also allows authors to rate how well a study’s 1) patient
selection, 2) index test, and 3) reference standard apply
to the specific research question posed by the system-
atic review. There are currently no criteria for assessing
risk of bias in studies that compare multiple index
tests.41 Studies that evaluated more than one index test
were excluded from our QUADAS-2 analysis. The fol-
lowing signaling questions and statements were used to
tailor the QUADAS-2 tool to this systematic review and
guide quality judgments:
Patient Selection.
The risk of spectrum bias was con-
sidered high if 1) the study was a case-control design or
2) the study made inappropriate exclusions that elimi-
nated diagnoses with overlapping features of AHF or
reduced the burden of disease in the non-AHF popula-
tion. Examples of unacceptable exclusions included renal
insufficiency, cirrhosis, morbid obesity, and other causes
of dyspnea such as pneumonia, pulmonary embolism,
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Excluding these conditions would inflate the specificity
of diagnostic tests.42 Acceptable exclusions included
trauma patients, patients with an acute coronary syn-
drome unless dyspnea was the predominant complaint,
and obvious noncardiac diagnoses such as pneumotho-
rax. Loss of applicability was rated as “high” if the study
ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE • March 2016, Vol. 23, No. 3 • www.aemj.org
225
 failed to consider all patients presenting to the ED with a
chief complaint of dyspnea for which AHF was in the dif-
ferential. Studies that excluded patients based on age
demographic (other than > 18 years) or dyspnea severity
or had significant gender imbalance were also at high
risk for losing applicability.
Index Test.
If the result of the index test was inter-
preted with the foreknowledge of the initial diagnosis
or other clinical data, the study was at high risk of over-
estimating the accuracy of the diagnostic test. This
applied to all index tests except history and examina-
tion, bioimpedance, and NP. If the study failed to use a
predetermined cut-off value or definition of a positive
test, the study was also considered to be at high risk for
bias in this domain. Loss of applicability was rated as
“high” if the diagnostic test was performed or inter-
preted by specialists other than EPs. Sonographic stud-
ies
performed
by
fellowship-trained
EPs
were
considered to be at high risk for losing applicability to
the majority of EPs without formal US training.
Reference Standard.
If the results from the index test
were incorporated into the final diagnosis of AHF, this
domain was considered at high risk for incorporation
bias and inflated estimates of both sensitivity and speci-
ficity.42,43 Exception for history and examination ele-
ments was made, as these were considered essential for
the reference standard. If the approach to the criterion
standard diagnosis of heart failure was not explicit or if
it failed to incorporate previously established clinical
criteria (for example, Framingham,30 Boston,31 Euro-
pean Society of Cardiology,44 NHANES32), the risk of
bias was considered high. If the study’s criterion stan-
dard did not match our review’s clinical definition (new
or worsening dyspnea in addition to objective evidence
supporting the diagnosis of AHF), this domain was con-
sidered less applicable to our review. For example, a
study that diagnosed AHF based on echocardiographic
evidence alone would be less applicable.
Flow and Timing.
If there was a significant delay
between ED presentation and performance of the index
test, this domain was considered to be at high risk for
bias. We used 6 hours as the cutoff after which a
patient would likely have received therapeutic interven-
tions and change clinical course enough to affect diag-
nostic testing. Sonographic and bioimpedance studies
that excluded patients because of lack of feasibility (for
example, body habitus, poor acoustic windows) were
also considered to be at high risk for bias.
Each pair of authors independently piloted the QUA-
DAS-2 tool with a sample of one to three included stud-
ies. Signaling questions that led to incongruent piloted
responses were refined as deemed necessary. Kappa
analysis using SPSS Statistics version 17.0 was used to
calculate statistical agreement regarding blinded QUA-
DAS-2 answers when more than three studies per index
test could be evaluated by these criteria. When consen-
sus agreement could not be reached between the two
authors, a third reviewer (JLM) adjudicated.
Risk of bias and applicability for the 35 NP studies
derived from the systematic review by Hill et al.29 was
already examined using the QUADAS-2 tool. Evaluation
of bias and applicability was therefore limited to the
more
recent
studies
identified
by
our
search
and
included in this review.
Test–Treatment Threshold
The Pauker and Kassirer decision threshold model,45
which incorporates diagnostic test characteristics as
well as estimated risks and benefits of treatment of
AHF, was used to determine testing and treatment
thresholds. Briefly, the Pauker and Kassirer decision
threshold model is based on five variables: sensitivity,
specificity, risk of a diagnostic test, risk of treatment,
and anticipated benefit of treatment.
RESULTS
From the 9,405 citations identified by the PubMed
searches, 9,317 citations identified by the EMBASE
searches, and two studies identified from the bibliogra-
phies of review articles, a total of 57 studies including
52 unique patient cohorts were chosen for inclusion in
this systematic review. A summary of the selection pro-
cess for the systematic review is presented in Figure 1.

searches applied to each index test are shown in Data
Supplement S2 (available as supporting information in

prospective and cross-sectional in design. Only two15,46
of the included studies published after 2003 were con-
ducted using the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic
Accuracy (STARD) criteria.47
Prevalence
The combined population from the 52 unique cohorts
included in this review was 17,893 patients. The sum-
mary prevalence of AHF in these studies was 45.6%
(95% CI = 44.9 to 46.4) with a range from 29% to 79%.
History and Physical Examination
A total of 31 studies7,8,12,14–16,18–21,23,25,46,48–65 reporting
test characteristics for history and physical examination
were selected for inclusion and are fully described in
Data Supplement S3 (available as supporting informa-
tion in the online version of this paper). Studies that
duplicated the cohort of an included study,36,66 reported
insufficient information to calculate test characteris-
tics67,68 or took place in the prehospital setting rather
than the ED69 were excluded after full text review (Data
Supplement
S2).
Two56,59
of
the
included
studies
focused on history and physical examination as the pri-
mary index tests of interest.
Point estimates for variables relating to clinical his-
tory, symptoms, and physical examination findings that
were reported in at least four separate patient cohorts
are included in Table 1. Additional point estimates are
included in Data Supplement S3. Statistical heterogene-
ity was very high for all pooled estimates of variables
reported in more than two studies except for diabetes
(I2 = 21%).
There
was
no
single
historical
variable,
symptom, or physical examination finding that could
significantly reduce the likelihood of AHF. A history of

226
Martindale et al. • DIAGNOSING ACUTE HEART FAILURE IN THE ED
 hypertensive crisis49 were found to increase the likeli-
hood of AHF, but these point estimates were derived
from a single study rather than pooled studies (Data
Supplement S3). The physical examination finding with
the highest positive LR was an S3 gallop. For the 14
studies that reported S3 data,7,8,14,15,20,53,55,57,59,60,64,65
(forest plot, Data Supplement S2) positive LRs ranged
from 1.658 to 13.0.59
Based on the QUADAS-2 tool and due to the patient
exclusion criteria used, the risk of bias in patient selec-
tion was high for the majority of the 17 studies sub-
jected to this analysis7,8,12,15,16,18,35,50,51,53,54,56–60,70 (Data
Supplement S2). Exclusion of patients with significant
renal dysfunction, acute coronary syndrome, and other
comorbidities in these studies likely resulted in a spec-
trum of patients that were less severely ill, leading to an
overestimation of specificity for the diagnostic tests
evaluated in these studies.42 Risk of bias for the crite-
rion standard was rated low in 65% of the included
studies.
The
reliability
for
the
authors’
QUADAS-2
assessments was moderate71 (j = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.43 to
0.75).
ECG
Searches from PubMed, EMBASE, and references of
review articles identified 2,258 citations, 13 of which
were selected for full text review. Of these, three15,16,65
were selected for inclusion in the systematic review.
Searches dedicated to other index tests in this review
identified an additional eight studies.7,12,19,20,51,58,60,62
ECG variables were grouped with baseline patient char-
acteristic data in each of the included studies; electro-
cardiogram was not the index test of primary interest in
any of these studies. All but two studies15,16 excluded
patients with acute coronary ischemia or myocardial
infarction. None of the abnormal electrographic find-
ings substantially increased or decreased the likelihood
of AHF (Table 2). The QUADAS-2 criteria could be
applied to seven of the included studies (Data Supple-
ment S2). Agreement between the two investigators
was moderate (j = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.29 to 0.81).

cles, 18 were selected for full text review. However, only

 primary studies; the diagnostic accuracy of chest radio-
graphy in AHF was the focus of two secondary analy-
ses.66,72 Of the 18 included studies (N = 5,328 patients),
eight
studies7,8,15,16,54,60,64,72
excluded
patients
with
comorbid renal insufficiency or failure. Three of the
included studies14,66,72 evaluated interstitial and alveolar
edema as separate radiographic variables, while others
reported pulmonary edema as an inclusive variable. It
was unclear who interpreted radiographs in the major-
ity of included studies. Retrospective review of radiol-
ogy reports served as the source of data in four
studies.14,15,66,72
Interobserver
agreement
in
radio-
graphic interpretation was not reported in any of the
included studies.
The radiographic variable most commonly reported
by the included studies was pulmonary edema. For the
purpose of pooling results, the terms “condensation,”
“pulmonary congestion,” “edema,” pulmonary venous
hypertension,” “interstitial and/or alveolar edema,” and
“interstitial edema” (when alveolar edema was not an
included study variable) were equated with “pulmonary
edema.” The positive LR associated with pulmonary
edema was 4.8 (95% CI = 3.6 to 6.4; Table 2; forest plot,
Data Supplement S2). Pulmonary edema, however, was
an insensitive finding (sensitivity = 56.9%; 95% CI = 54.7
to 59.1%). The presence of enlarged cardiac silhouette
and pleural effusions were less helpful findings.

analysis
could
be
performed
on
117,8,12,15,16,18,23,54,58,60,72 of the included studies (Data
Supplement S2). Agreement between the two investiga-
tors applying the QUADAS-2 criteria was fair (j = 0.40,
95% CI 0.24 to 0.56). Patient selection was at risk for
decreased applicability in 73% of the studies because
they excluded subgroups of dyspneic patients based on
comorbidities. Risk of bias for the criterion standard
diagnosis was rated high in each of the included studies
because radiographic results were consistently incorpo-
rated into final diagnoses.

(69%) of the included studies.
Test characteristics were pooled according to assay
manufacturers, given the systematic differences that
have been shown among commercially available NP
assays.89 At the most commonly reported cutoff value of
100 pg/mL, BNP demonstrated high sensitivity and a
negative LR less than 0.2 (forest plot, Data Supplement
S2). The pooled sensitivity and specificity among the 19
studies14,19,35,50,51,54,55,58,60,67,73–78,82,84,85 (9,143 patients)
that used the Triage Biosite assay was 93.5% (95%
CI = 92.6 to 94.2%) and 52.9% (95% CI = 51.6 to 54.2%),
respectively. Specificity improved at a cutoff value of
500 pg/mL to 89.8% (95% CI = 88.5 to 91.1%), but at the
cost of reduced sensitivity to 67.7% (95% CI = 65.5 to
69.9) (Table 3). Ten studies7,20,46,64,73,75,77,81,83,87 using
the Elecsys Roche immunoassay for NT-proBNP pro-
vided test characteristic data for the cutoff value of
300 pg/mL. The pooled negative LR at this cutoff was
0.09 (95% CI = 0.03 to 0.34; forest plot, Data Supplement
S2). At a significantly higher cutoff value of 1550 pg/mL,
specificity improved, but only to 72.9% (95% CI = 70.6
to 75.0%). Diagnostic performance data for other NP
assays used in the included studies of this systematic
review are shown in Table 3.

studies46,75,77,81,83 that shared patient-level NT-proBNP
data (N = 2,013 patients) were pooled. Interval LRs are
shown in Table 4. Interval LRs of BNP concentrations at

as
defined by
a
dichotomous cutoff of 100 pg/mL were substantially
lower (100–200 pg/mL; 0.29, 95% CI = 0.23 to 0.38) than
those associated with higher BNP concentrations (1000–
1500 pg/mL; 7.12, 95% CI = 4.53 to 11.18). High NT-
proBNP concentrations (150,000–300,000 pg/mL) were
associated with an interval LR of 2.93 (95% CI = 1.95 to
4.39). The area under the curve using a summary recei-

based
on
patient-level results was 0.86 (95% CI = 0.83 to 0.86) for
BNP and 0.76 (95% CI = 0.74 to 0.78) for NT-proBNP
(Data Supplement S2).
According to the QUADAS-2 analysis performed by
Hill et al.,29 the only category rated as high risk of bias in
the majority of included studies was patient selection. In
four25,49,64,79of
the
five
studies
published
after
Hill
et al.’s29 systematic review (that evaluated more than one
index test), patients with renal disease were excluded. By
eliminating patients with this common comorbidity from
the sample population, there are likely to be fewer false-
positive NP results; spectrum bias in these studies results
in inflated specificity.42 Two studies18,83 not included in
Hill et al.’s29 systematic review evaluated a single index

at the time of patient enrollment were included if the
physicians performing and interpreting lung US were
considered EPs in their countries. A total of eight stud-
ies23,24,48,62,63,81,90,91 (N = 1,918 patients) were selected
for inclusion in this review. All studies included adults
presenting to the ED with dyspnea. Study characteris-
tics
are
described
in
Data
Supplement
S3.
Russell
et al.63 selected only those patients in whom dyspnea
was truly undifferentiated; patients in whom a diagnosis
of AHF seemed clinically obvious were excluded. Train-
ing was limited to didactic and workshop sessions for
most studies; in two of the studies48,63 sonographers
were fellowship-trained in emergency US. Study char-
acteristics are presented in Data Supplement S3.
A positive lung US was defined in every study by the
presence of at least three B lines in two bilateral lung
zones. In six of the included studies,23,24,48,62,63,81 the US
protocol was based on scanning eight thoracic lung
zones (four anterior and four lateral, as described by
Volpicelli92). Two studies90,91 modified this protocol to
interrogate six anterior-lateral thoracic lung zones.

US
proved to be a diagnostic variable with discriminatory
value (positive LR 7.4, 95% CI = 4.2 to 12.8; negative LR
0.16, 95% CI = 0.05 to 0.51). Statistical heterogeneity
was high for these pooled estimates (I2 = 78% and
I2 = 99%, respectively). Positive LRs among the eight
included studies ranged from 2.863 to 1924 (forest plot,
Data Supplemental 2). Pleural effusions visualized on
lung US were less helpful in diagnosing or excluding
AHF (positive LR 2.0, 95% CI = 1.4 to 2.8).
The risk for bias in the criterion standard diagnosis
was rated as high in the four studies23,24,63,90 that could
be
evaluated
by
QUADAS-2
(Data
Supplement
S3)
because standard clinical criteria were not applied to
the criterion standard diagnosis in these studies. In only
one of these studies24 were lung US results incorpo-
rated into the criterion standard diagnosis. Risk of
decreased applicability in the domain of patient selec-
tion was rated as high in three studies that excluded
patients with comorbid conditions24 or patients requir-
ing mechanical ventilation.23,63 Agreement between the
two investigators applying the QUADAS-2 criteria was
high71 (j = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.79 to 1.0).
Beside Echocardiography
After
reviewing
the

version
of
18
studies,
four20,21,48,63 (N = 675patients) were selected for inclu-
sion in this review (Data Supplement S3). Three ED-
based studies18,19,53 were excluded from this review
because cardiologists rather than EPs performed or
interpreted the sonograms (Data Supplement S2). EPs
fellowship-trained in US performed the US examina-
tions in the studies by Anderson et al.48 and Russell
et al.63 The sonographers in the studies by Nazerian
et al.,20 Russell et al.,63 and Wang et al21 were blinded
to clinical data. Inter-observer agreement was reported
only by Wang et al.21 (0.889). In all four included stud-
ies20,21,48,63 the physicians who made the final diagnosis
were blinded to the echocardiograms performed as
index tests. Three studies20,21,63 analyzed patients with
suboptimal imaging as false negatives. To maintain con-
sistency, these patients were not included in pooled esti-
mates in our review.
A summary of the echocardiographic test characteris-
tics analyzed in the four included studies20,21,48,63 are
reported in Table 5. Ejection fraction (EF) was deter-
mined by visual estimation in the studies by Anderson

negative LRs of 8.3 (95% CI = 4.0 to 16.9) and 0.21 (95%
CI = 0.12 to 0.36), respectively.
The QUADAS-2 criteria could only be applied to the
study by Russell et al.,63 because these criteria do not
apply to studies that compare multiple index tests. Risk
of bias in patient selection was rated as high due to
their exclusion of patients with causes of dyspnea pre-
sumed to be obvious (a patient with known heart failure
who was not compliant with taking medications) and
those who had received prior treatment (Data Supple-
ment S3).
Bioimpedance
Four studies24,25,60,78 that evaluated the diagnostic accu-
racy
of
bioimpedance
on
ED
patients
(N = 1,039
patients) were selected from the 65 studies that were
screened (Data Supplement S2). One study60 evaluated
conventional
bioelectrical
impedance
analysis,
while
three24,25,78 used bioelectrical impedance vector analysis
(BIVA) in which resistance and reactance are plotted as
a bivariate vector on a nomogram. Characteristics of
the included studies are listed in Data Supplement S3.
One78 of the four studies was designed as a case-control
study in which study groups were divided based on
BNP value, clinical evidence of AHF, and respiratory
symptoms; however, for our pooled analyses the author
provided us with the final criterion standard diagnoses
of AHF/not AHF and the associated hydration index
values for each patient.
Segmental resistance measures thoracic fluid status
using sensing and output electrodes placed on the ante-
rior thigh and suprasternal notch.93 Segmental resis-
tance values lower than the cutoff determined by ROC
curve intercept offered the highest positive LR (10.6,
95% CI = 5.8 to 19.2; Table 6). BIVA, which accounts for
age, sex, and body mass index, offered lower positive
LRs (Table 6).
QUADAS-2 criteria could be applied to the two24,60
included studies that evaluated a single index test (Data
Supplement S3). Risk of bias in patient selection was
rated as high in these studies because they excluded
patients with comorbid conditions that caused ascites
and peripheral edema.
Test–Treatment Threshold Estimates
Test–treatment threshold models contextualize a diag-
nostic test in a clinical setting by linking the discrimina-
tory
value
of
a
test
with
the
benefits
and
risks
associated with a given treatment. Evidence regarding
the clinical benefits and risks of pharmacologic treat-
ments for AHF, however, is very limited.94 No pharma-
cologic therapy for the treatment of acute AHF has
been given a class I/level of evidence A recommenda-
tion from the American Heart Association or Heart Fail-
ure
Society
of
America.13,95
Randomized
controlled
trials investigating the effect of loop diuretics on clini-
cally relevant outcomes are lacking. In the DOSE (Diure-
tic Optimization Strategies Evaluation in Acute Heart
Failure) trial,96 high-dose intravenous diuretic therapy
was associated with a higher risk of increasing serum
creatinine within 72 hours of treatment initiation com-
pared with low-dose diuretic therapy, but this increase
was not observed at 60 days.
A recent Cochrane review
on nitrate
vasodilator
therapy showed no difference in outcomes compared
with alternative interventions, but this review reflects a
paucity of available evidence.97 In the Vasodilation in
the Management of Acute CHF (VMAC) trial98 compar-
ing intravenous nitroglycerin with nesiritide and with
placebo, 10% of the 216 patients receiving intravenous
nitroglycerin
experienced
symptomatic
hypotension;
mean doses 3 hours after treatment initiation were
42 lg/min in catheterized patients and 29 lg/min in
noncatheterized patients. These studies, however, may
not provide an accurate estimation of the benefits and
risks of diuretics and nitrates when administered early
in the course of managing a patient in the ED. Some of
the patients included in these studies were enrolled
well after their initial presentation and early manage-
ment. Doses studied in the VMAC trial98 may be lower
than those administered to hypertensive patients with
AHF
in
the
ED.
A
test–treatment
threshold
model
based on these numbers might be less relevant to the
EP.

Martindale et al. • DIAGNOSING ACUTE HEART FAILURE IN THE ED
 The estimated benefits and risks of common pharma-
cologic interventions such as intravenous diuretics or
nitrate vasodilator therapy that we chose to apply to a
test–treatment threshold model, therefore, are hypothet-
ical and used for illustrative purposes. Mathematically,
the test–treatment threshold is based on the relative
costs
of
treating
patients
without
disease C
(i.e.,
hypotension from vasodilator and diuretic therapy) and
failing to treat those with disease B. Higher estimated
risk of heart failure treatment C relative to treatment
benefit B results in a higher treatment threshold. If the
risk of treating dyspneic patients without underlying
AHF were estimated to be 0.45 and the risk of failing to
treat AHF patients expeditiously were 0.19, then the
treatment threshold, or posterior probability of disease
(PTT), at which the costs of these two risks (B and C)
would be balanced is 70%. This assumes that the cost of
NP testing (including harm to the patient) is negligible.
Figure 2 displays the posterior probabilities yielded by
different diagnostic tests when starting at a pretest
probability of 46%. Those diagnostic tests with positive
LRs
large
enough
to
yield
a
posterior
probability
greater than 70% would guide the Bayesian clinician to
treat for AHF.
Applying the Pauker and Kassirer45 threshold model
to a diagnostic test with a dichotomous outcome also
allows one to start with a posterior probability (treat-
ment threshold; PTT) and using the positive and negative
LRs associated with the test, calculate the range of pret-
est probabilities for which the diagnostic test has the
potential to change the decision to treat for AHF. This
range is defined by the limits of the no treat–test thresh-
old and the test–treatment threshold. Starting with a
posterior treatment threshold probability of 70% and
using the positive and negative LRs of lung US, the no
treat–test threshold is 24% and the test–treat threshold
is 94% (Figure 3). When the pretest probability lies
between these thresholds, lung US has the potential to
affect management. Different values for estimated risks
and benefits of administering AHF treatment can be

DISCUSSION
The diagnosis of AHF in the adult ED population remains
challenging. This systematic review demonstrates that
clinical elements such as past medical history, presenting
symptoms, and physical examination findings, on their
own, cannot be relied on for excluding or establishing
the diagnosis. It also demonstrates that symptoms com-
monly sought in a clinical history such as orthopnea,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and weight gain fail to
distinguish patients with AHF. S3 gallop, the physical
examination finding most suggestive of AHF, is only
13% sensitive. Rales and peripheral edema are even less
suggestive of AHF. This review did not evaluate the diag-
nostic accuracy of historical elements, symptoms, or
examination findings in combination. Clinical gestalt,
based on an aggregate effect of the history and physical
examination, likely outperforms these diagnostic ele-
ments in isolation and plays an important role in deter-
mining the pretest probability of AHF. However, greater
awareness of the limitations associated with individual
variables may help to avoid diagnostic overconfidence
and some of the biases inherent in a heuristic approach
to formulating an initial diagnosis.
Our review shows that the ECG, often available
within minutes of patient arrival, does little to alter the
probability
of
AHF.
However,
none
of
the
studies
included in this review investigated QRS amplitude, a
parameter that has been shown to attenuate with wors-
ening heart failure.99,100 Chest radiography is consid-
ered a fundamental component of the ED workup for
AHF but radiographic signs of pulmonary edema and
vascular redistribution are often absent in AHF patients.
The poor sensitivity of CXR findings for diagnosing pul-
monary
edema
has
been
previously
described.26,101
Even in the presence of severely elevated pulmonary
capillary wedge pressures in patients with heart failure,
radiographic pulmonary congestion is absent 39% of
the time.102
The data in this systematic review are consistent with
that of prior studies demonstrating that at recom-
mended respective cut-points of 100 and 300 pg/mL,103
BNP and NT-proBNP testing are most useful for exclud-
ing AHF.29,104 Calculation of interval LRs from patient-
level NP results, however, is unique to this review and
helps provide a more clinically intelligible interpretation
of NP test performance. This review highlights the
shortcomings
of
dichotomizing
continuous
variables
into binary outcomes above and below a single cutoff
point. The positive LR associated with a BNP of 150 pg/
mL, when applying pooled binary data relating to the
single
cutoff
value
of
100 pg/mL
(Triage,
Biosite,
Table 3), is 2.2 (95% CI = 1.8 to 2.7). Based on this value,
a diagnosis of AHF would be favored because it is sta-
tistically grouped with substantially higher BNP values
in AHF patients. Using interval LR data, however, a

Martindale et al. • DIAGNOSING ACUTE HEART FAILURE IN THE ED
 BNP value of 150 pg/mL is associated with an LR of
0.29 (95% CI = 0.23 to 0.38) and thus favors an alterna-
tive diagnosis
(Table 4).
Only above a
cut-point of
800 pg/mL for BNP does the interval LR substantially
increase the posttest probability of AHF. The interval
LRs for NT-proBNP only modestly favor the diagnosis
of AHF even at extremely elevated levels.
This review focuses on the diagnostic accuracy of
NPs. The utility of these biomarkers, however, is based
on whether or not their use results in clinical benefit.105
Several randomized controlled trials that have evaluated
the clinical performance of NPs have failed to demon-
strate
differences
in
patient-centered
clinical
out-
comes.106–108 One possible explanation is that NPs add
little value beyond the clinical judgment of an EP. When
the diagnosis of AHF is relatively certain, clinical judg-
ment has been shown to be more accurate than the
BNP result.9 In the subset of dyspneic patients for
whom the diagnosis of AHF is uncertain, the perfor-
mance of NPs is suboptimal.109 NPs may prove to have
greater
clinical
utility
when
used
with
a
Bayesian
approach and interpreted as a continuous rather than
as a dichotomous variable.87
Given the limitations of NP values above recom-
mended “rule-out” cut-points, point-of-care lung US can
play a potentially significant role in the ED diagnosis of
AHF in the ED. The diagnostic performance of lung US
in this review was superior to any other diagnostic test
that was studied in more than one cohort of patients.
With a pooled positive LR of 7.4 (95% CI = 4.2 to 12.8)
and negative LR of 0.16 (95% CI = 0.05 to 0.51), lung US
demonstrates potential to both rule in and exclude the
diagnosis of AHF. Statistical heterogeneity among these
studies was substantial, and this should be taken into
account while interpreting these summary estimates.
Spectrum bias resulting from the exclusion of patients
with alternative causes of dyspnea62 and peripheral
edema24 should also be considered.
Perhaps the most robust data in our pooled lung US
sample comes from the multicenter study by Pivetta
et al.23 (N = 1,005). Patient exclusions were limited to
those with initially obvious causes of dyspnea (traumatic
pneumothorax) and intubated patients. Lung US in this
study was performed by 62 EPs across community and
academic hospitals, and the criterion standard diagnosis
of AHF at hospital discharge was determined with high
inter-rater agreement (j = 0.93). The positive and nega-
tive LRs determined in this study were 14.0 (95%
CI = 10.2 to 19.3) and 0.10 (95% CI = 0.08 to 0.14),
respectively. Incorporation of lung US into the classifi-
cation of AHF in this study led to a net reclassification
improvement of 19% (95% CI = 14.6 to 23.6%). The
authors of this study report that the vast majority of
lung US examinations were performed within 40 min-
utes of ED presentation. The feasibility of lung US to
rapidly identify pulmonary edema in real time shortly
after ED presentation and before therapeutic interven-
tion may increase the sensitivity of this test.
In a recent meta-analysis, Al Deeb et al.22 evaluated
the test performance of lung US in diagnosing AHF.
The pooled positive and negative LRs from this meta-
analysis were 12.4 (95% CI = 5.7 to 26.8) and 0.06 (95%
CI = 0.02 to 0.22), respectively. However, only three of
the seven studies62,81,90 included in their analysis took
place in the ED. Two110,111 of the seven included studies
took place in the intensive care unit (ICU) where spec-
trum bias might increase the sensitivity of pathologic B-
lines. While the prevalence of other causes of diffuse
sonographic B-lines such as interstitial lung disease,
multifocal pneumonia, and severe acute respiratory dis-
tress syndrome might decrease the specificity of this
pattern for AHF in the ICU,112 higher estimates of
specificity in these studies may be related to study
design. The test characteristics of B-lines in one ICU
study were evaluated in predefined groups of patients
with pulmonary edema, COPD, and no cardiopulmonary
disorder.111 In the other ICU study, sonography was
performed by experts in thoracic US who used sono-
graphic artifacts to classify other causes of dyspnea
including pneumonia, venous thromboembolism, and
pneumothorax.110
Echocardiography is considered key to the diagnosis
of chronic heart failure, but limited availability and
echocardiographic experience among EPs have limited
its role in the diagnostic evaluation of dyspnea in the
ED setting. Echocardiography is more technically chal-
lenging and complex than lung US, but perhaps the
simplest echocardiographic assessment relating to heart
failure is the visual estimation of EF. EF data was based
on visual estimation in the three included studies20,48,63
that reported this variable. Visual estimation of EF by
both cardiologists112 and EPs113 has been shown to cor-
relate well with quantitative assessments of EF. How-
ever, use of reduced EF alone as an echocardiographic
variable for predicting AHF would result in the failure
to detect the 50% of heart failure patients with pre-
served EF.114 Further, many patients also have a prior
EF available in the medical record, which may limit the
amount of new information provided by an EF recorded
in the ED.
Pulsed Doppler analysis of mitral inflow enables the
evaluation of relative velocities during early and late
diastolic filling and provides a surrogate measure of ele-
vated left ventricular filling pressures. A restrictive pat-
tern of diastolic filling in the single included study was
associated with a positive LR of 8.3 (95% CI = 4.0 to
16.9) for the diagnosis of AHF. However, mitral inflow
analysis cannot reliably be applied to patients who are
tachycardic or have permanent pacing or mitral valve
prostheses, and standard definitions cannot be applied
to patients in atrial fibrillation.115 Accurate mitral inflow
analysis is also highly dependent on preload, leading to
an increasingly common use of combined approaches
that incorporate tissue Doppler imaging techniques.116
Perhaps most importantly, acquiring mitral inflow and
tissue Doppler data may be beyond the scope of many
EPs who do not have formal fellowship training. Given
this, further studies investigating the ability of a restric-
tive pattern to predict AHF and the ability of EPs with
minimal echocardiographic training to accurately per-
form and interpret Doppler analysis are needed.
Bioimpedance analysis has emerged as a potential
noninvasive assessment of pulmonary congestion and
peripheral edema, based on the theory that intratho-
racic fluid decreases resistance to an applied electrical
current.117 Both thoracic and whole body impedance

 devices have been evaluated. While many implantable
devices incorporate a data channel to measure thoracic
impedance, EPs rarely have the output from the device
while the patient is being evaluated in the ED. There-
fore, this review focuses on measurements taken by
external monitoring devices. Barriers to routine adop-
tion thus far have included the time that it takes to
acquire the data and requirement for the patient to
remain relatively motionless for up to several min-
utes.118
Implications for Future Research
Given the suboptimal accuracy with which AHF is dis-
criminated from other causes of dyspnea in the ED,
clinical decision aids based on multiple logistic regres-
sion modeling may have a role in assisting with the clin-
ical diagnosis of AHF. Useful models will likely require
several diagnostic components and should incorporate
rather than take the place of clinical gestalt. One such
model
based
on
age,
pretest
probability,
and
NT-
proBNP intervals has demonstrated diagnostic accuracy
in
both
internally
derived
and
externally
validated
cohorts.87 Lung US and bedside echocardiography are
diagnostic tests to consider including in different deci-
sion models and NPs are likely best utilized to exclude
the diagnosis of AHF. We could foresee other biomark-
ers and diagnostic tests quantifying pathophysiology
and assisting with the diagnosis of AHF by excluding
other causes such as infection, acute kidney injury, or
obstructive pulmonary disease. The clinical utility of
these new diagnostic adjuncts would need to be evalu-
ated alongside current diagnostic modalities.
Future
diagnostic
studies
should
adhere
to
the
STARD reporting guidelines to make more explicit the
potential for bias.47 Ideally, diagnostic studies for AHF
would avoid overt spectrum bias by including patients
with comorbidities such as renal failure. Reporting test
characteristics as they pertain to discrete intervals of
biomarker values in future studies would be more infor-
mative than reporting data relating to a single cutoff
value.87 As shown in this review, dichotomization of
continuous variables can produce distorted and exag-
gerated LRs. Dichotomous results from cutoff values in
future biomarker and bioimpedance studies may be
reported for expediency. Results based on cutoff values
that are determined a priori rather than retrospectively
derived from intercepts of ROC curves are likely to be
more generalizable.
Diagnostic test results that are
based on interpreter judgment should be reported with
statistical data reflecting inter-rater reliability. Until a
better criterion standard for the diagnosis of AHF
becomes available, a clinical diagnosis made by two
reviewers blinded to the index test will have to serve as
the criterion standard.
LIMITATIONS
The most important limitations of this systematic review
apply to the criterion standard diagnosis of AHF. The
criterion standard for AHF in the included studies was
a clinical diagnosis made by two or more clinicians after
medical record review. In the absence of a better crite-
rion standard for the diagnosis of AHF, a clinical diag-
nosis that combines a subjective assessment of a patient
with some combination of objective data points must be
relied on as a criterion standard. Estimations of the
diagnostic accuracy of an index test for AHF are only
as valid as the criterion standard diagnoses are accu-
rate. The credibility of the criterion standard diagnosis
is likely to vary among the studies included in this
review. Incorporation of echocardiographic data, for
example, into the diagnostic workup and criterion stan-
dard diagnosis among the included studies was vari-
able.
Although our search strategies for the electronic
databases used in this systematic review were con-
structed by an experienced health sciences librarian
using accepted principles of health information science,
it is still possible that they may have missed some stud-
ies eligible for inclusion. However, the comprehensive
nature of our literature search makes it unlikely that we
have excluded any important studies whose findings
would significantly alter the conclusions of this review.
In addition, there is the possibility of language bias in
the findings of this review because non-English publica-
tions were excluded. However, this type of exclusion
has not been shown to significantly affect the results of
meta-analyses.119
Data relating to all diagnostic tests reported by a
study were included in the meta-analysis, even if some
of these diagnostic tests were not the primary index test
evaluated by that study. We analyzed multiple tests
derived from a single study as independent diagnostic
variables to aggregate results according to diagnostic
category. Coming from the same sample of patients,
which has a distinct composition and spectrum of dis-
ease, it is unlikely that the individual variables investi-
gated in this sample behave independently with respect
to test performance. Likewise, to think of the summary
LRs for each diagnostic test as stand-alone values would
overlook their interdependence and derivation from the
same studies. Also, data collection relating to other
diagnostic tests included in a study may not have been
as rigorous as that applied to the study’s primary index
test. Data from those diagnostic tests other than the pri-
mary index test under a study’s investigation likely fac-
tored
into
the
criterion
standard
diagnosis.
Incorporation bias challenges the validity of these data,
potentially increasing the sensitivity and specificity of
the diagnostic test.42,43
The quality of studies that were included in the meta-
analysis
was
variable.
Differences
in
inclusion
and
exclusion criteria among the included studies put them
at varying degrees of risk for spectrum bias.42 Appraisal
of pooled results should factor in the clinical as well as
statistical heterogeneity among included studies.
A limitation specific to the NP analyses in this review
was our lack of consideration of age as a variable affect-
ing BNP and NT-proBNP values. Data relating to the
specificity of these tests may have been more accurate if
age-based cutoffs were evaluated.7,12,120,121 Other vari-
ables known to affect NP values, such as renal func-
tion,75,77,80,122,123
were
also
not
factored
in
to
our
analysis of diagnostic accuracy.
Last, the test–treatment threshold model suggested in
this review is a conceptual model. It is limited by the
236
Martindale et al. • DIAGNOSING ACUTE HEART FAILURE IN THE ED
 paucity of available data on which to base estimates for
the clinical benefits and risks of treatment. However, it
may be useful for the EP to apply this model to patient
disposition; the posterior treatment threshold can be
thought of as a threshold above which the physician,
confident that AHF is the underlying cause of dyspnea,
can stop testing. Below this threshold, the physician
would be compelled to seek further evidence in the ED
favoring the diagnosis of AHF.
CONCLUSIONS
Elements of clinical history, symptoms, physical exami-
nation, chest radiography, and electrocardiography, on
their
own,
lack
discriminatory
value
in
making
or
excluding the diagnosis of acute heart failure in ED
patients.
B-type
natriuretic
peptide
and
N-terminal
proB-type natriuretic peptide are most valuable in rul-
ing out acute heart failure when values are lower than
the suggested cutoff points of 100 and 300 pg/mL,
respectively. Values above these thresholds may be less
helpful for establishing the diagnosis than previously
described. Lung ultrasound appears to have the best
combination of test characteristics with the presence or
absence of diffuse B-lines providing reliable information
to confirm or exclude the ED diagnosis of acute heart
failure. Other diagnostic modalities such as bioimpe-
dance
may
have
future
utility
in
the
ED
setting,
although more study is needed.
