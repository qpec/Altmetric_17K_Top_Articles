Animal behavior is shaped through interplay among genes, the
environment, and previous experience. As in mammals, satiety
signals induce quiescence in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we re-
port that the C. elegans transcription factor ETS-5, an ortholog of
mammalian FEV/Pet1, controls satiety-induced quiescence. Nutri-
tional status has a major influence on C. elegans behavior. When
foraging, food availability controls behavioral state switching be-
tween active (roaming) and sedentary (dwelling) states; however,
when provided with high-quality food, C. elegans become sated
and enter quiescence. We show that ETS-5 acts to promote roaming
and inhibit quiescence by setting the internal “satiety quotient”
through fat regulation. Acting from the ASG and BAG sensory neu-
rons, we show that ETS-5 functions in a complex network with
serotonergic and neuropeptide signaling pathways to control
food-regulated behavioral state switching. Taken together, our re-
sults identify a neuronal mechanism for controlling intestinal fat
stores and organismal behavioral states in C. elegans, and establish
a paradigm for the elucidation of obesity-relevant mechanisms.

A
nimal behavior is strongly influenced by the availability of
food. In invertebrates and vertebrates, appetite, locomotor
activity, and sleep rhythms are all driven by nutritional state (1–7).
When malnourished, animals seek out a new food source by ac-
tively exploring their environment (roaming), whereas animals
that are well fed tend to explore less (dwelling) and when fully
sated enter a quiescent or sleep-like state (1–3, 8, 9). Transitions
between these behavioral states can be regulated by sensory per-
ception of external stimuli and through gut signals or other in-
ternal cues that are generated according to food quality (3, 4, 6).
Initial evidence for neuronal regulation of feeding behavior
was shown in mammals using hypothalamic lesions (10). Sec-
tioning of specific regions within the rat hypothalamus evoked
opposing behaviors. Removal of one section caused overeating
and obesity, whereas removal of an adjacent section resulted in
starvation owing to reduced eating (10). Subsequent studies
showed that the pro-opiomelanocortin–expressing neurons in the
hypothalamus function to suppress feeding, whereas a hypotha-
lamic region that contains neuropeptide Y/agouti-related pro-
tein–expressing neurons promotes feeding (11). These adjacent
brain regions integrate signals received from the gut that report
satiety (12). The nutritive content of food itself also serves as a
potent regulator of behavior. In mammals, a diet loaded with fats
and sugars stimulates overfeeding and leads to obesity (13). In
addition, rats can learn to select a source of food based exclu-
sively on its nutritional value in the absence of external cues (14).
In Caenorhabditis elegans, as in mammals, nutritive value is a
behavioral stimulus (1, 4). Nematodes exhibit different behaviors
when cultured on low-quality food compared to high-quality food,
with high-quality food defined as a superior supporter of worm
growth (1, 4). Sensory perception of food in the environment can
promote roaming, whereas internal perception of food abundance
in the intestine promotes dwelling (3). As such, animals that are
unable to sense their environment, and thus cannot sense the
presence of food, exhibit reduced time spent roaming (9).
When fed on the standard laboratory Escherichia coli strain
(OP50, a low-quality food), C. elegans spontaneously transition
between dwelling and roaming, and are quiescent <5% of the
time (1). This suggests that nematodes are not fully sated in
laboratory conditions and hence increase their roaming behavior
to search for a more optimal environment. In support of this
idea, when grown on high-quality bacteria, C. elegans are >90%
quiescent due to satiety (1). At a behavioral level, this quiescent
state is reminiscent of postprandial somnolence in mammals.
Postprandial somnolence is thought to reflect an increase in the
tone of the parasympathetic nervous system relative to the
sympathetic nervous system, as well as altered activity of arousal
circuits as a result of increased blood glucose levels, although the
pathways mediating these effects are poorly understood (15). In
C. elegans, neuronal signaling pathways using serotonin (5-HT),
pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) neuropeptides, TGF-β, and the
cGMP-dependent protein kinase EGL-4 regulate roaming, dwell-
ing, and quiescent behaviors (1–3, 9). These modulators of food-
regulated behavior function in dedicated, mostly nonoverlapping
neuronal circuits that detect environmental cues, along with eval-
uating internal metabolic status (2); however, the transcriptional
control of food-regulated behaviors has not yet been defined.
The ETS (E twenty-six) family is one of the largest tran-
scription factor (TF) families in metazoa. In humans, there are
29 family members, whereas in C. elegans, there are 10, with
representative members of all of the major classes (16–18). ETS
TFs use their conserved 85-aa winged helix-turn-helix ETS
Significance
Animals constantly monitor their internal energy levels and
modify their eating and foraging behavior as required. Our work
defines a role for the ETS-5 transcription factor in the control of
body fat levels and thereby the activity of animals. We have
defined the responses controlled by ETS-5 at the genetic, cellular,
and organismal levels and identified how ETS-5 interacts with
known
pathways
that
regulate
food-regulated
behavioral
states. These findings provide insight into how fat levels are
regulated and how satiety controls organismal activity.

 domain to interact with regulatory elements of target genes
harboring purine-rich DNA sequences (19–21). Members of the
ETS TF family are functionally diverse; in C. elegans, for example,
AST-1/ETV1 regulates axon guidance and dopaminergic neuron
differentiation (22, 23), LIN-1/ELK3 regulates vulval development
downstream of MAP kinase signaling (24), and ETS-4/SPDEF
controls lifespan (25). We and others have previously shown that
ETS-5/FEV controls the carbon dioxide-sensing function of the
BAG neurons (26, 27). In vertebrates, the homologs of ETS-5,
FEV(human)/Pet1(mouse), also play prominent roles in brain
development and function, including the control of circadian
rhythms, as well as anxiety-like and aggressive behaviors (28–30).
We sought to identify additional neuronal functions of ETS-5
by screening for behavioral phenotypes in ets-5 loss-of-function
mutant animals. Using this approach, we discovered that ets-5 is
required for food-regulated behavioral state switching. When
cultured on low-quality food, ets-5 mutant animals exhibit re-
duced roaming and an increase in quiescent behavior, suggesting
that they are more sated, or perceive that they are sated, even on
low-quality food. This behavioral change was abrogated when ets-5
mutant animals were malnourished, suggesting that internally
generated metabolic signals regulate the changes in behavior. In-
deed, we found that ets-5 mutants stored excess fat, and that a
reduction in fatty acid biosynthesis suppressed the exploratory
defects of these animals. Finally, we show that ets-5 acts in the
ASG and BAG sensory neurons to control exploratory behavior,
most likely through the action of multiple neuropeptides.
Taken together, our findings identify a function of the con-
served ETS-5 TF in food-regulated behavioral state switching
that is controlled by internal metabolic signals of satiety. In
mammals, ETS TFs are associated with obesity regulation and
behavioral states (31, 32) pointing to a potentially conserved
regulatory function.
Results
The ETS-5 Transcription Factor Is Required for Exploratory Behavior in
C. elegans. When cultured on a standard laboratory bacterial lawn
(OP50 E. coli), we noticed that ets-5 null mutant animals do not
explore their environment to the same extent as wild-type (WT)
animals. To quantify this defect, we used a well-established ex-
ploratory behavior paradigm (2). In this assay, single larval stage
4 (L4) animals were placed in the center of a nematode growth
medium (NGM) agar plate that was completely coated with a
lawn of OP50 E. coli bacteria, and the tracks the animals made
over a 16-h period were recorded (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A). Com-
pared with WT animals, the ets-5 null mutant animals exhibited an
approximate 10-fold reduction in exploratory capacity (Fig. 1B).
Both of the ets-5–predicted null alleles that we analyzed exhibited
similar defects in exploratory behavior, and we rescued the
ets-5(tm1734) mutant phenotype using an ets-5::gfp fosmid
transgene (Fig. 1B).
The significantly reduced exploration exhibited by the ets-5
mutant animals could be caused by general defects in neuronal
function and/or locomotion. However, we found that the loss of ets-5
did not cause a detectable change in locomotor speed or in the
ability to sense and respond to gustatory and olfactory cues (Fig. S1
B–F), indicating that the exploratory defect observed in the ets-5
mutant animals was not caused by general defects in locomotion or
in the ability to sense external cues in the environment.
To more precisely define the effect of ets-5 loss on exploratory
capacity, we studied the behavioral state of individual worms. We
detected three behavioral states in this analysis: roaming, dwelling
and quiescence, as described previously (1). Roaming animals
moved forward rapidly, turning infrequently; dwelling animals ei-
ther turned frequently in a localized area or remained stationary
while pumping the pharynx; and quiescent animals did not move
or pump the pharynx during the 10-s analysis period (1, 2). We
found that the proportions of WT animals in the roaming (21%),
dwelling (75%), and quiescent (4%) states were similar to those
reported previously (1) (Fig. 1C). In ets-5 mutant animals, the
proportion of dwelling animals was unchanged (73%), whereas
that of roaming animals was reduced (8%) and that of quiescent
animals was increased (19%) (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these data
indicate that ets-5 is required to control the behavioral state of C.
elegans, in which ets-5 loss causes reduced activity.
ets-5 Acts in the ASG and BAG Sensory Neurons to Control
Exploratory Behavior. To elucidate the focus of action for ETS-5
in the regulation of exploratory behavior, we analyzed the full
4-kb upstream intergenic region of ets-5 and found that it drives
the expression of a fluorescent reporter in two pairs of neurons
(Fig. 2A). Based on position, morphology, and colocalization
with neuron-specific reporters, we identified these neurons as
ASGL/R and BAGL/R (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2A). We found that
the ets-5(tm1734) exploration defect was rescued in transgenic
animals expressing ets-5 cDNA under control of the ets-5 pro-
moter (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the expression of ets-5 in these
neurons controls exploratory behavior. To reinforce these data,
we performed neuron-specific RNA-mediated interference (RNAi)
of ets-5 in the ASG and BAG neurons, and found that exploratory
behavior was diminished (Fig. 2C). These data demonstrate that
ets-5 acts in the ASG and/or BAG neurons to regulate explor-
atory behavior in C. elegans.
To confirm the importance of the ASG and BAG neurons in
exploration, we performed genetic and laser ablation experi-
ments (Fig. 2 D and E and Fig. S2B). We first used a laser mi-
crobeam to kill the ASG and BAG neurons and then assayed the
exploratory capacity of ablated animals. We found that ablation
of either the ASG or BAG neurons reduced exploration (Fig.
S2B). For technical reasons, we were unable to reliably laser-kill
the ASG and BAG neurons in the same animal, and thus we

 turned to the split caspase genetic ablation system (33). As in the
laser ablation experiments, caspase-induced genetic ablation of
either the ASG or BAG neurons reduced exploration (Fig. 2D).
We also found that ablation of both the ASGs and BAGs
resulted in a further reduction of exploratory capacity, resembling
ets-5 mutant animals (Fig. 2D). In concurrence with this finding,
behavioral state analysis of ASG ablation, BAG ablation, and
ASG and BAG ablation showed an increase in quiescence com-
pared with controls (Fig. 2E). These data confirm the roles of the
ASG and BAG neurons in the regulation of exploratory behav-
ioral states in C. elegans.
ETS-5 Mutant Defects in Oxygen- and Carbon Dioxide-Sensing
Function Do Not Affect Exploratory Behavior. Previous studies have
shown that ETS-5 specifies the oxygen- and carbon dioxide-sens-
ing neuron fate of the BAG neurons (26, 27). ETS-5 is required
for BAG expression of the CO2-sensing receptor-type guanylate
cyclase GCY-9 and the O2-sensing soluble guanylate cyclases
GCY-31 and GCY-33. As such, ets-5 mutant animals are unable to
coordinate behavioral responses to CO2 exposure or to downsteps
in O2 levels (Fig. S1 B and C) (26, 27). We tested whether these
deficits in O2- and CO2-sensing function in ets-5 mutant animals
may be responsible for their reduced exploratory capacity. We
analyzed the gcy-9(n4470) mutant (loss of BAG-regulated CO2
sensing), the gcy-31(ok296); gcy-33(ok232) double mutant (loss of
BAG-regulated O2 sensing) and the gcy-9(n4470) gcy-31(ok296);
gcy-33(ok232) triple mutant (loss of BAG-regulated O2 and CO2
sensing) (Fig. S2C). We found that none of these mutant back-
grounds caused a significant change in exploratory behavior, in-
dicating that defective O2 and CO2 sensing in ets-5 mutant animals
does not cause the exploration defects (Fig. S2C).
ets-5 Functions in a Complex Genetic Network with 5-HT, PDF, and
cGMP Signaling to Control Behavioral State Switching. Previous
work has shown that the dwelling, or resting, state is promoted by
5-HT signaling, and that the roaming, or active, state is pro-
moted by PDF signaling (2). In addition, EGL-4 cGMP-
dependent protein kinase signaling inhibits roaming and promotes
quiescence (1, 9). To better understand the genetic hierarchy
between these pathways and the behavioral state regulator ETS-5,
we performed double-mutant genetic analysis. The exploration
assay shown in Fig. 1B provided some epistatic information (Fig.
S3); however, the resolution was low, and it was unable to gauge
quiescence. Therefore, we also directly studied the behavioral
state of single worms as shown in Fig. 1C.
To assay behavioral states and exploration, we first crossed
ets-5(tm1734) mutants with animals mutant for mod-1(ok103),
which encodes a 5-HT-gated chloride channel previously shown
to suppress roaming (Fig. 3A and Fig. S3A) (2). In concurrence
with this work, we found that the loss of mod-1 increased ex-
ploration; however, in mod-1; ets-5 double mutant animals, we
observed the ets-5 mutant phenotype (Fig. S3A). This finding
suggests that ets-5 acts genetically downstream of 5-HT signaling
to control exploration behavior. However, when we studied the
behavioral states of these animals directly, we found that loss of
MOD-1–dependent 5-HT signaling suppressed the increased
quiescence, but not the reduced roaming, of ets-5 mutant animals
(Fig. 3A). This finding suggests that defective neuronal signaling
in mod-1 mutant animals switches the behavioral state of ets-5
mutants from quiescent to dwelling.
We next performed a similar analysis with the PDF-1 pathway.
Loss of PDF signaling using the PDF-1/2 receptor mutant
pdfr-1(ok3425) resulted in exploratory behavior similar to that
exhibited by ets-5 mutant animals (Fig. S3B). The ets-5; pdfr-1
double mutant explored to a similar degree as each single mutant,
thus preventing any further resolution. Using behavioral state
analysis, we found that the ets-5; pdfr-1 double mutant exhibited
similar quiescence and lack of roaming as the pdfr-1 single mutant
(Fig. 3B). This finding suggests that PDFR-1 acts downstream of
ets-5 to control behavioral state. Finally, we confirmed a previous
report that cGMP signaling inhibits roaming (9), showing that
egl-4(n479) loss-of-function animals explored more than WT ani-
mals (Fig. S3C). When the egl-4(n479) and ets-5(tm1734) muta-
tions were combined, WT exploration was restored (Fig. S3C),
and in the behavioral state assay, egl-4 was epistatic to ets-5 (Fig.
3C). This finding suggests that EGL-4 acts downstream of ETS-5
in the regulation of exploration. Taken together, these data pre-
sent a complex network comprising a TF (ETS-5) and conserved
neuronal signaling pathways (5-HT, PDF, and cGMP) that control
behavioral states in C. elegans (Fig. 3D). It predicts that exquisite
control of neuronal signaling by these factors can modulate the
behavioral state of animals to optimize their survival potential in
ephemeral environments.

 Malnutrition Suppresses Exploration Defects Caused by Loss of ETS-5.
It was previously shown that satiety, engendered by high-quality
food, induces quiescence (1). We hypothesized that the sixfold
increase in quiescence in ets-5 mutant animals could be a result
of enhanced satiety or a perception of satiety. Therefore, we
tested whether reducing satiety through chemically induced or
genetically induced malnutrition could modify the ets-5 mutant
phenotype (Fig. 4 A and B). First, we treated OP50 E. coli
bacteria with the antibiotic aztreonam, which prevents bacterial
division and produces filamentous bacteria that are inedible to
worms (3, 34). When ets-5 mutant animals were placed on ex-
ploration plates containing this inedible food, their exploratory
ability was restored to WT levels (Fig. 4A). This effect of mal-
nutrition occurred rapidly; a time-course experiment showed
that ets-5 mutant animals explored similarly as WT animals as
early as 1 h after being transferred to aztreonam-treated bacte-
rial plates (Fig. S4).
The suppression of the ets-5 mutant exploratory defects by
aztreonam-treated bacteria could be due to a sensory response to
poor (inedible) food or to an internal starvation/metabolic re-
sponse. To distinguish between these possibilities, we crossed the
ets-5(tm1734) strain into a mutant lacking the EAT-2 ligand-
gated ion channel that has been used to model dietary restriction
in previous studies (35, 36). The EAT-2 channel is required for
rapid pharyngeal pumping on food, and as such, the rate of
pumping in eat-2(ad465) mutant animals fed on E. coli bacteria
was only ∼15% that of WT animals. Consequently, eat-2(ad465)
mutants stored less fat and explored more compared with WT
animals (37) (Fig. 4B). We also found that the eat-2(ad465)
mutation fully suppressed the ets-5(tm1734) exploration defect
(Fig. 4B). Taken together, these data show that decreasing food
intake can reverse the reduced exploratory behavior of ets-5
mutant animals. A possible explanation for this shift in behavior
could be that ets-5 controls the level of an internal satiety signal,
and that a reduction of food cues stimulates exploratory behavior
to enable optimal foraging.
ets-5 Mutants Exhibit Increased Fat Storage. What could be the
satiety signal in ets-5 mutant animals that causes reduced ex-
ploration? We hypothesized that loss of ets-5 may cause in-
creased fat storage, and that the resulting enhanced satiety might
thus trigger quiescence. Indeed, it has been noted that quiescent
animals often have a dark intestine, an indicator of increased fat
storage (1). In C. elegans, fat storage can be assayed by staining
fixed worms with the lipophilic dyes Nile Red and Oil Red O (37,
38). We stained ets-5 mutant animals using both dyes and found
that loss of ets-5 caused enhanced fat storage compared with WT
animals (Fig. 5A and Fig. S5A). The increase in body fat was not
accompanied by an enhanced rate of pharyngeal pumping (Fig.
S5B), suggesting that a shift in metabolism, rather than increased
feeding, is responsible for the increased body fat phenotype of
ets-5 mutant animals.
Based on our finding that transgenic expression of ets-5 in the
ASG and BAG neurons rescued the ets-5 mutant defect in ex-
ploratory behavior (Fig. 2B), we asked whether such neuron-
specific expression could rescue the excess fat phenotype of the
ets-5(tm1734) mutant. Using Oil Red O staining, we found that
expression of ets-5 cDNA in the ASG and BAG neurons reduced
the levels of fat in ets-5 mutant animals (Fig. 5B). These data
suggest that increased fat in ets-5 mutant animals causes a re-
duction in exploratory behavior.
To more directly investigate whether increased fat storage in
ets-5 mutant animals causes reduced exploration, we decreased
body fat levels in the intestine by RNAi of pod-2 (encoding an
acetyl-CoA carboxylase that produces malonyl CoA, a crucial
precursor of fatty acid synthesis) and elo-2 (encoding a palmitic
acid elongase that converts C16:0 fatty acids to C18:0 fatty acids)
(39–41). We found that pod-2 and elo-2 RNAi partially suppressed

 lipase) (42). We found that atgl-1 RNAi caused a reduction in
exploratory behavior (Fig. 5D). Therefore, our data indicate that
internal fat stores can be interpreted by C. elegans to modify
exploratory behavior.
We have shown that exploratory behavior is modulated by
genetic perturbations that regulate fat storage in C. elegans (Fig.
5). We next asked whether a change in diet could directly modify
exploratory behavior. High-glucose diets in humans are closely
linked to obesity (43). Likewise, glucose supplementation to the
C. elegans diet caused a significant rise in fat storage, likely by
altering the quality of bacterial food grown on glucose (44) (Fig.
S5 C and D). Therefore, we investigated whether diet-induced
fat storage also might affect exploratory behavior in WT animals
by feeding worms with bacteria supplied with a high-glucose diet.
As expected, we found that a high-glucose diet reduced the ex-
ploratory behavior of WT animals (Fig. S5E), as demonstrated
by a decrease in the proportion of animals roaming (from 21% to
11%) and an increase in the proportion of those in quiescence
(from 4% to 10%). This behavioral defect could be reversed
after recovery on food with no glucose supplement (Fig. S5E),
which is associated with decreased fat staining (Fig. S5F). These
data indicate that the exploratory behavior of C. elegans is dy-
namic and responsive to internally generated satiety cues, most
likely from the intestine.
Neuropeptide Signaling Contributes to the Control of Exploratory
Behavior. Because the C. elegans intestine is not directly in-
nervated, communication between the ASG and BAG neurons
and the intestine most likely occurs through the action of neu-
ropeptides. To test this hypothesis, we performed neuron-spe-
cific RNAi against unc-31, which encodes a calcium-dependent
activator protein for secretion that is required for neuropeptide
release (45). We found that both BAG-specific (gcy-33 pro-
moter) and ASG- and BAG-specific (ets-5 promoter) knockdown
of unc-31 reduced the exploratory behavior of WT animals (Fig.
5E). The reduced exploratory capacity of ASG and BAG knock-
down was similar to that of BAG knockdown alone, suggesting
that the role of neuropeptides in the control of exploration may
originate predominantly from the BAG neurons.
The transcriptional targets of ETS-5 in the ASG and BAG
neurons have not been fully described; however, previous studies
have shown that specific FMRFamide-related neuropeptides,
expressed in the BAG neurons (FLP-13 and FLP-19), are reg-
ulated by ETS-5 (26, 27). Therefore, we examined the behavior
of mutant strains lacking these neuropeptides, and found that
loss of both flp-13 and flp-19 caused a partial decrease in ex-
ploratory capacity. Taken together, our findings show that the
ETS-5 TF acts in the ASG and BAG neurons to control satiety-
regulated behavioral states in C. elegans, most likely through the
action of multiple neuropeptides (Fig. 5G).
Discussion
Satiety signals from the gastrointestinal tract and adiposity in-
dicators from adipose tissue control appetite in mammals. Hy-
pothalamic regions in the mammalian brain assimilate such
information to enable the formulation of appropriate food-
related behavioral responses. In C. elegans, as in mammals, satiety
results in quiescence, which is reminiscent of postprandial som-
nolence. Here we report that the conserved ETS-5 TF regulates
quiescence in C. elegans through the control of satiety. WT
C. elegans exposed to low-quality food minimally entered quies-
cence owing to a lack of satiety, a behavior controlled by ETS-5,
given that loss of this TF caused enhanced quiescence under the
same conditions. As such, we propose that ETS-5 is required for
setting the “satiety quotient” in C. elegans. In support of this
hypothesis, we found that reducing fatty acid synthesis in the
intestine was sufficient to suppress the ets-5 mutant defects in
exploratory behavior.
We found that when ets-5 mutant animals were exposed to
inedible food or their feeding was genetically impeded, their
exploratory behavior resembled that of WT animals. This re-
version of behavior is rapid, indicating that ets-5 mutant animals
can perceive and respond to their environment when challenged
with low concentrations of food in their pharynx. Therefore, the
ability to perceive the presence of low-value nutritional food
through mechanosensory and chemosensory cues (34) is intact in
ets-5 mutant animals. These findings suggest that signals reporting
the internal metabolic state of the animals (satiety) can be over-
ridden by indicators of poor food influx into the mouth, most likely
through neuronal signaling. This would be a potential means of
anticipating starvation that would enable animals to rapidly re-
locate to more optimal environments. Given that C. elegans lose
approximately 70% of their body fat within 2–3 h of fasting (40),
the rapid reversal of exploratory behavior is an important sur-
vival mechanism in these animals.
We have shown that satiety-induced quiescence can be pro-
moted by a diet that causes excessive storage of fat in C. elegans.
Remarkably, we found that the behavioral consequence of high
fat stores (quiescence) in C. elegans can be reversed after a few
hours on a regular bacterial diet. This suggests that satiety-
induced quiescence caused by excess fat may be used as a model
to identify molecular and neuronal mechanisms that control in-
teractions between the gut and nervous system.
Our genetic data and the neuronal circuitry work of others (2)
indicate the existence of a complex network of mostly non-
overlapping neuronal signaling pathways (5-HT, PDF, cGMP)
that control exploratory behavior. This is not surprising, con-
sidering that the ephemeral habitat of C. elegans (46) requires a
sophisticated mechanism for perceiving complex external food
cues and integrating this information with the internal metabolic
state. We have identified a TF, ETS-5, as an important regulator
of exploratory behavior, promoting roaming of C. elegans while
inhibiting quiescence. As such, ETS-5 may be considered an
arousal factor; our data suggest that ETS-5 acts in the same
pathway as PDFR-1 in this regard. Given that PDF signaling also
acts in Drosophila to promote waking states (47), it will be in-
teresting to establish whether PDF in the fruit fly acts in con-
junction with an ETS TF to control wakefulness.
Our genetic analysis also identified a role for MOD-1–directed
5-HT signaling in quiescence. Loss of MOD-1 caused complete
suppression of satiety-induced quiescence in ets-5 mutant animals,
suggesting that when animals are sated, modification of seroto-
ninergic signaling can still regulate quiescence. The significance of
this finding in C. elegans is unclear; nonetheless, there appears to
be a conserved role for 5-HT in the regulation of feeding behavior
in other systems (48).
We have shown that the ASG and BAG neurons are important
for the regulation of exploratory behavior. Previously, the ASG
neurons were shown to regulate dauer formation and longevity,
in addition to the detection of food or food breakdown products
(49–51). The ASG neurons are also able to act in stress condi-
tions when they are recruited to a novel neuronal circuit to enable
an escape response (52). In contrast, the BAG neurons function to
detect changes in oxygen and carbon dioxide in the environment
and to coordinate behavioral responses according to changes in
environmental gas status (26, 53–56). Our behavioral state analysis
shows that the ASG and BAG neurons are both important for
the inhibition of quiescence under standard laboratory condi-
tions, whereas the ASG neurons potentially play a more major
role in the inhibition of roaming behavior.
Owing to the absence of intestinal innervation in C. elegans,
communication between the nervous system and intestine most
likely occurs through the action of neuropeptides. Indeed, we
found that disrupted neuropeptide release from the ASG and
BAG neurons partially reduces exploratory capacity, as does loss
of specific neuropeptides from the BAG neurons. Future work

 should concentrate on understanding the molecular mechanism
through which ETS-5 controls body fat storage/metabolism
through the action of neuropeptides, and how satiety signals
control locomotion and feeding. Multiple ETS TFs have been
linked to obesity in humans (57–60), and thus the important role
of the ETS-5 TF that we describe here may be conserved in
higher organisms as well.
Materials and Methods
C. elegans Maintenance. All C. elegans strains were cultured on NGM plates at
20 °C as described previously unless stated otherwise (61). All strains gen-
erated and used in this study are described in SI Materials and Methods.
Exploration Assay. Exploration assays were performed as reported previously
(2) and described in detail in SI Materials and Methods. Single OP50 E. coli
colonies were inoculated in 400 mL of LB and incubated at 37 °C overnight
for 16 h without shaking. Worms were grown in uncrowded conditions to
the L4 stage. Individual L4 animals were then placed in the center of 55-mm
NGM plates uniformly seeded with 500 μL of OP50 E. coli bacteria that had
been grown for 48 h at 20 °C. After a 16-h period of exploration at 20 °C, the
worms were removed, plates were superimposed on a grid of 3-mm squares,
and the number of squares entered by worm tracks was counted manually.
The investigator was blinded to genotype, and experiments were repeated
at least three times.
