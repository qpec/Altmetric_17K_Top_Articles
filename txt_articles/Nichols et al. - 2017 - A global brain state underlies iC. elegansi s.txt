A global brain state underlies
C. elegans sleep behavior
Annika L. A. Nichols, Tomáš Eichler, Richard Latham, Manuel Zimmer*
INTRODUCTION: Global brain states such as
sleep and wakefulness involve reconfigurations
of neural circuit activity across the entire ner-
vous system. Yet it is not understood how the
brain can effectively switch between and main-
tain different states. Do dedicated brain centers
control states via top-down mechanisms? And
to what extent do self-organizing principles
of neuronal networks play a role? To address
these questions, it would be ideal to measure
the contributions of all individual neurons to
a global brain state. Unfortunately, this is cur-
rently not possible in mammals or other large
organisms. Every animal thoroughly studied
exhibits sleeplike behaviors, implying that sleep
is an essential, primordial, and common func-
tion of neural networks. In mammals, sleep is
defined at the physiological level by a charac-
teristic electroencephalography (EEG) signal.
Such a definition is missing for invertebrate
models, which primarily rely on behavioral
definitions.
RATIONALE: The nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans is a tractable model organism with the
potential to overcome these limitations: It has a
stereotypic and mapped nervous system of only
302 neurons. Sleep is developmentally timed
and occurs predominantly during lethargus
periods of ~2 hours at the end of each larval
stage. During wakefulness, the worm brain
exhibits neuronal population dynamics that in-
volve a large fraction (~40%) of neurons. These
neuronal activities are highly coordinated across
the neuronal population; that is, they share
common activity patterns. This feature can be
quantified with computational methods and
visualized in low-dimensional brain state phase
plots. The resulting brain state trajectory repre-
sents the action sequence
of the animals. To control
sensory-evoked switching
between sleep and wake-
fulness, we established a
behavioral genetics para-
digm combined with con-
trolled changes in oxygen (O2) concentration.
This method, together with whole-brain imag-
ing at single-cell resolution, enables us to ob-
serve brainwide neuronal activity dynamics
during brain state transitions.
RESULTS: During lethargus, wild C. elegans
strains prefer to sleep in social aggregates, and
local O2 concentrations are a key underlying
cue. In this study, we have shown that a neu-
ropeptide receptor (NPR-1) expressed in a hub
interneuron regulates information processing
of the arousal cue. We could recapitulate these
switches between sleep and wakefulness in
immobilized animals while recording the ac-
tivity of nearly all neurons in the brain via Ca2+
imaging. We found that sleep in C. elegans is a
global brain state in which about 75% of neu-
rons displaying activity during wakefulness
become inactive. However, a few specific neu-
rons retained activity during sleep, notably
g-aminobutyric acid–producing (GABAergic)
and peptidergic head neurons such as the sleep-
promoting interneuron RIS. Chemosensory cir-
cuits activated by atmospheric O2 rapidly evoked
transitions to wakefulness by effectively activat-
ing neuronal population dynamics. In contrast,
entries into sleep occurred spontaneously in
the absence of arousing cues via convergence
of neuronal activities toward the global qui-
escent state. Here, the sleep-active neurons
retained stationary high activity.
CONCLUSION: Using computational analy-
sis, we have shown that sleep is an emergent
property of neuronal networks. When lethargus
animals are in a favorable environment such
as a social aggregate, sleep can evolve sponta-
neously in the absence of arousing cues; these,
however, can rapidly reactivate dynamical brain
activity. Our analysis reveals that neuronal
networks feature properties of dynamic attrac-
tors during wakefulness, whereas during sleep
these dynamics converge toward a fixed point.
This attractor state mechanism could be a
means to effectively switch between and main-
tain global brain states.▪

Sleep is a global quiescence brain state. Social aggregates of worms create a preferred
milieu of low oxygen. During the lethargus developmental stage, these conditions permit sleep.
Fluorescence heat maps (rectangles) show that wakefulness is associated with brainwide
activity, whereas during sleep most neurons are down-regulated. The brain state cycles
on a low-dimensional trajectory [as displayed by computational analysis (phase plot)],
which corresponds to the pictured action command sequence. At sleep onset, these dynamics
converge toward a tangle representing a fixed-point attractor state.

A global brain state underlies
C. elegans sleep behavior
Annika L. A. Nichols, Tomáš Eichler, Richard Latham, Manuel Zimmer*
How the brain effectively switches between and maintains global states, such as sleep and
wakefulness, is not yet understood. We used brainwide functional imaging at single-cell
resolution to show that during the developmental stage of lethargus, the Caenorhabditis
elegans brain is predisposed to global quiescence, characterized by systemic down-regulation
of neuronal activity. Only a few specific neurons are exempt from this effect. In the absence
of external arousing cues, this quiescent brain state arises by the convergence of neuronal
activities toward a fixed-point attractor embedded in an otherwise dynamic neural state
space. We observed efficient spontaneous and sensory-evoked exits from quiescence.
Our data support the hypothesis that during global states such as sleep, neuronal
networks are drawn to a baseline mode and can be effectively reactivated by signaling
from arousing circuits.
B
ehavioral states resembling mammalian
sleep have been described across the Ani-
malia phyla (1). The ubiquity of such obser-
vations suggests that some aspects of sleep
observed in mammals might be fundamen-
tal to all nervous systems. Nonetheless, sleep is
incompletely understood in terms of mechanism,
regulation, and function. There are two major
hypotheses concerning how this global brain state
arises in the brain. One is a top-down regulatory
mechanism implicating sleep-promoting centers
in inducing sleep upon the rest of the brain (2).
Alternatively, sleep onset may be a bottom-up
mechanism, an emergent property of neuronal
circuits, which is then spatially and temporally
coordinated by sleep-regulatory circuits (3–6). In-
triguingly, cultured mouse cortical neurons spon-
taneously display sleeplike activity but can be
induced into wakelike activity by wake-promoting
substances; this finding indicates that sleep may
be the default state of neuronal networks (7). In
mammals, there are cases in which behavior and
local brain state are uncorrelated. For example,
cetaceans such as dolphins can be awake and
alert while their brains are sleeping unihemi-
spherically (8). Furthermore, local cortical net-
works in awake rats can transiently go “offline”
and display sleeplike properties (6). Similarly, sub-
populations of Kenyon cells in Drosophila display
sleeplike properties upon prolonged sleep dep-
rivation (9). These studies highlight the need for
comprehensively measuring the activity of local
circuits and individual neurons across the entire
brain to understand its global state.
Although great leaps in our understanding of
neuronal activity during sleep have been made
by recording local activity (6, 10–14) and global
activity at low resolution (15–18), currently avail-
able recording techniques do not have the spatial-
temporal resolution to measure brainwide activity
of single neurons in mammals. Therefore, we
cannot determine how individual neurons across
the entire brain are contributing to the emergent
properties of global brain states.
The behavioral quiescence seen during the de-
velopmentally timed lethargus periods of the soil-
dwelling nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has
recently been shown to fulfill behavioral criteria
for sleep [i.e., increased arousal thresholds (19),
reversibility (19), specific posture (20–22), and ho-
meostasis (19, 20, 23)]. During the lethargus stage,
animals switch between behavioral quiescence
(i.e., absence of any motion) and short, spontane-
ous periods of motion (19, 20). Furthermore, there
is wide molecular conservation of regulation, in-
cluding control of timing during development via
PERIOD (which regulates circadian timing in other
organisms); wakefulness-promoting signaling via
pigment-dispersing factor (PDF), cyclic adeno-
sine monophosphate (cAMP), and dopamine; and
quiescence-promoting signaling via epidermal
growth factor (EGF) (24–28). The g-aminobutyric
acid–producing (GABAergic) and peptidergic in-
terneuron termed RIS has been shown to exhibit
elevated activity during lethargus and to induce
immobility when activated optogenetically (29).
Furthermore, both sensory and downstream neu-
rons have been shown to have dampened activity
during quiescence (30–32). However, a compre-
hensive view of global nervous system activity
changes during behavioral quiescence with single-
cell resolution has been lacking.
Low-O2 environments promote
behavioral quiescence in npr-1 animals
We first sought to establish an experimental par-
adigm for effective switching between quiescent
and aroused brain states. Previous reports suggest
that during the domestication of the standard
laboratory strain N2, several mutations were
acquired and fixed in its genome (33). One of
these mutations is a gain-of-function mutation
in the G protein–coupled receptor neuropeptide
receptor 1 (npr-1) (34). All true wild C. elegans
isolates tested so far have a low-activity allele of
npr-1, called g320 in the wild strain Hawaiian
(33). These animals, as well as animals containing
an npr-1 loss-of-function mutant (ad609) in the
N2 background (henceforth npr-1 animals), accu-
mulate at the border of bacterial lawns, where
food is enriched. Here, they feed in groups by
forming social aggregates, whereas standard N2
animals exhibit solitary feeding behavior. There-
fore, the behavior of npr-1 animals often serves
as a proxy for behavior of wild strains (33, 34).
Previous behavioral studies on animals in the
lethargus period have reported that npr-1 animals
and wild strains have low levels of behavioral
quiescence relative to N2 animals (25). However,
when animals are left unperturbed in highly
controlled environments for an extended time,
npr-1 shows only slightly less quiescence relative
to N2 (23, 35). Because these studies were done on
isolated animals, we aimed to measure the quies-
cence of animals in groups. We generated trans-
genic npr-1 animals with fluorescent pharynges
to easily detect and video-track individuals in
social aggregates (Fig. 1, A and B, fig. S1A, and
movie S1). We found that lethargus [as described
in this study, representing late larval stage 4 (L4)]
npr-1 animals within social aggregates show
periods of locomotor quiescence, whereas animals
in the mid-L4 stage (prelethargus) generally do
not. The same difference in activity between
lethargus and prelethargus animals was seen for
isolated npr-1 animals that dwell in the bacterial
border (Fig. 1B and fig. S1B). Thus, lethargus
npr-1 animals exhibit quiescence behavior in
aggregates and bacterial lawn borders.
Low O2 tension is one of the key environmen-
tal features found in both bacterial lawn borders
and social aggregates (36, 37). To test whether
O2 levels alone could permit quiescence in npr-1
animals, we modified a previously reported be-
havioral assay in which worms were placed in an
O2 flow arena for direct video tracking (38, 39);
behavior was observed on a homogeneous food
lawn lacking borders. The animals were kept at
21% (atmospheric) O2 for 10 min, then shifted to
10% O2, which is within the preferred concen-
tration range of npr-1 animals (36), for 10 min.
This assay enables quantitative imaging of be-
havior, so that we could apply stringent criteria
for defining quiescence versus active behavior—
that is, prolonged absence versus occurrence
of detectable movement such as locomotion or
head motions (fig. S1, C to I, and supplementary
materials). We found that prelethargus and
lethargus npr-1 animals were seldom quiescent
at 21% O2, which is consistent with the studies
on isolated animals. At 10% O2, only a few short
bouts of quiescence could be observed in pre-
lethargus npr-1 animals; however, lethargus
npr-1 animals displayed long quiescence inter-
vals with short interrupting bouts of activity

 (Fig. 1, C and D). This motion pattern, referred
to as lethargic behavior, was described previously
in lethargus N2 animals (19, 20).
For all subsequent behavioral experiments, we
established a high-throughput assay that allowed
us to track individuals by video in populations
of ~150 animals per assay, spanning the 10- to
12-hour period during which animals develop
from the L4 prelethargus to the young adult stage
under controlled O2 environments. At constant
10% O2, populations of npr-1 animals were en-
riched in quiescent animals around the L4-to-
adult transition (fig. S1J). We found that shifting
the O2 concentration to 21% for 6 min rapidly
aroused all lethargic npr-1 animals in a sustained
manner (Fig. 1, E and F, and fig. S1K). The wild
strain Hawaiian, like animals bearing the Hawaiian
npr-1(g320) allele in the N2 genetic background,
showed a similar response (Fig. 1, E and F). Con-
versely, lethargic N2 animals could only tran-
siently be aroused in this paradigm (Fig. 1E). N2
populations kept at either constant 10% O2 or
constant 21% O2 had nearly identical quiescence
profiles, showing that the N2 lethargus quiescence
is robust to these O2 tensions (fig. S1, L and M).
Next, we leveraged the O2 stimulation paradigm
to induce controlled periods of sleep deprivation
and found that the longer the time of sleep dep-
rivation, the greater the fraction of the popula-
tion in quiescence (fig. S2A) as well as the greater
the fraction of time each animal was found
quiescent (fig. S2B), both indicating homeosta-
sis. Moreover, lethargus behavior at 10% O2 was
associated with increased arousal thresholds (fig.
S2, C to H). Both observations support our inter-
pretation that quiescence during the lethargus
phase at 10% O2 is a sleep state, as was pre-
viously shown for lethargus at uncontrolled O2
tensions (19–23). These results imply that atmo-
spheric O2 levels (21%) cause sustained arousal
during lethargus in a wild strain and in npr-1
animals, whereas low-O2 environments permit
quiescence behavior like that reported for N2
animals.
O2 sensory neurons and RMG hub
interneurons are part of a neural circuit
for arousal maintenance
To determine where this state-switching signal
enters the nervous system, we tested genetic cell-
ablation strains of previously identified chemo-
sensory neurons involved in O2 upshift sensing
[AQR, PQR, and URX (38)] and downshift sensing
[BAG (38)]. AQR, PQR, and URX, as well as a sol-
uble guanylate cyclase homolog [gcy-35(ok769)],
are required for O2 sensation in these cells (36, 38)
and were required to arouse npr-1 animals in a
sustained manner at 21% O2 (Fig. 2, A and B).
Ablating BAG had no effect on arousal (Fig. 2B).
In the absence of these cells or functional gcy-
35, a transient arousal response to O2 upshift
remained, indicating a previously undescribed
sensing mechanism for O2 upshift (Fig. 2A and
fig. S3A).
To identify the site of npr-1–mediated modula-
tion, we performed transgenic rescue experiments.
As a positive control, we expressed the N2 gain-
of-function allele of npr-1 from its endogenous
promoter and could show full restoration of N2-
like behaviors in npr-1 animals (Fig. 2, C and D).
Previous work showed that npr-1 expression in
the hub interneuron RMG is sufficient to promote
solitary behavior (40). RMG is a gap junction
hub connecting many sensory neurons (including
URX) and interneurons (41) (fig. S4). We found
that npr-1 is required partially in the interneuron
RMG to repress sustained arousal in response to
21% O2 (Fig. 2, C to F), but not in the O2 upshift
sensory cells or the principal URX interneuron
target AUA; there was no significant additive
effect when combining with URX, AQR, and

 PQR or with AUA (Fig. 2, C and D). These re-
sults were consistent when tested in indepen-
dent transgenic lines (fig. S3B). Furthermore, as
previously described (40), endogenous npr-1 ex-
pression as well as specific rescue in RMG re-
stored solitary behavior (fig. S3C). We were not
able to identify the remaining important npr-1–
expressing cells with available promoter expres-
sion constructs.
Are there other modulatory inputs into the
RMG circuit? To address this question, we first
tested mutants for the known NPR-1 ligands but
observed only a small effect on 21% O2–induced
arousal during lethargus (fig. S5, A and B). This
is consistent with similarly small effects on ag-
gregation behavior (42) and suggests additional
yet unidentified NPR-1 ligands or the possibility
that the N2 npr-1 allele has constitutive activity.
We also tested the involvement of the neuro-
peptide PDF and its receptors, which were re-
ported to genetically interact with the npr-1
pathway and are required for npr-1–mediated
elevation of locomotor activity (25). Using our
assay, we found that PDF signaling is required
specifically for 21% O2–evoked high-speed loco-
motion of npr-1 animals but not for 21% O2–
evoked arousal from quiescence (fig. S5, C to H).
These findings imply the existence of a sensory
circuit including primary oxygen sensors (URX,
AQR, or PQR) and the RMG hub interneurons,
which contribute to environment-dependent
switching between active and quiescent behav-
ioral states during lethargus.
Whole-brain imaging recapitulates
lethargic behavior
Having established an experimental paradigm
to rapidly switch between aroused and quiescent
behavioral states, we next sought the underlying
neurological basis. We applied a recently reported
brainwide Ca2+-imaging approach using a nu-
clear localized and pan-neuronally expressed
Ca2+ indicator to record the activity of most
head ganglia neurons at single-cell resolution
(43, 44). In this approach, single animals are
imaged while immobilized in microfluidic devices
that allow for tight control over environmental
O2 levels (38). Using this approach, we previously
reported on neuronal population dynamics in
the brains of adult N2 animals and showed that
the brain state, despite the immobilization con-
dition, transitions through a cyclical sequence
of motor command states (forward crawl, back-
ward crawl, dorsal or ventral turn, forward crawl,
etc.). These dynamics involve a large fraction
(~40%) of all neurons in the brain, and each motor
command state can be described by characteristic,

 phasic, neuronal ensemble activities (44). We
assayed npr-1 and N2 animals in the presence
of bacterial food at either the prelethargus or
lethargus stage (n = 10 to 12 different individ-
uals for each condition); a typical recording
encompassed 80 to 130 neurons, of which the
cell class of 20 to 41% could be identified. The
stimulus reiterated a segment of the protocol
used for the behavioral population assays (6 min
of 10% O2, 6 min of 21% O2, 6 min of 10% O2)
(Fig. 3 and movie S2). Prelethargus N2 and npr-1
animals displayed the typical neuronal population
dynamics at both 10% and 21% O2 levels; lethargus
N2 and npr-1 animals in addition displayed
periods of widespread down-regulation of brain
dynamics at 10% O2 (Fig. 3 and movie S2). Only
npr-1 animals were effectively aroused in all
recordings by the 21% O2 stimulus (Fig. 3D).
For subsequent quantitative analyses of these
observations, we first established a classifier for
the quiescent brain state periods. We defined
quiescence by the absence of motor-related ac-
tivity as defined by readings from AVAL/R in-
terneurons and SMDDL/R, SMDVL/R, VB, and
RIVL/R motor neurons (most neuronal classes
are represented by a left and a right member,
specified by appending L or R, respectively). The

 activity of these neurons in freely behaving worms
corresponds to the execution of one of the motor
command states (44, 45) (Fig. 4, A and B, and
fig. S6) (see supplementary materials for details).
Prelethargus animals had very few periods of
quiescence, whereas both N2 and npr-1 lethargus
animals displayed quiescence at baseline 10%
O2 (Fig. 4, C and D), like the levels seen in our
behavioral assays (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, all npr-1
lethargus animals exited quiescence when shifted
to 21% O2 and on average maintained the active
state for the duration of the 6-min stimulus (Fig.
4C). Consistent with our behavioral results (for
controls of transgenic lines, see fig. S7, A and B),
the fraction of lethargus N2 animals in an active
brain state transiently increased upon O2 upshift
(Fig. 4D). These data show that our results
obtained in the behavioral paradigm can be re-
capitulated by whole-brain imaging in immobi-
lized animals.
Quiescence during lethargus is a global
brain state
We next quantified how the above-defined qui-
escence state correlates with global neuronal ac-
tivity levels by calculating the mean cumulative
frequency distributions of the change in fluores-
cence intensity (DF/F0) across all neurons (except
neurons that encode O2 sensory information).
According to a DF/F0 cutoff for defining active
versus inactive neurons during the aroused state
in either prelethargus or lethargus animals, ~40%
of all neurons were active; this number dropped
to ~10% during quiescence in both lethargus N2
and lethargus npr-1 animals (Fig. 4, E and F).
Thus, during quiescence, about three-fourths of
all neurons that are normally found to be active
were down-regulated.
To investigate this observation further, we
focused our subsequent analyses on all neurons
from cell classes that could be reproducibly iden-
tified in enough recordings (n ≥ 3). For example,
the RIM and AVB interneurons, which are active
during the reversal and forward motor command
states, respectively (44), were both found to be
largely inactive during quiescence (Fig. 4, G and
H). We made the same observation for the gross
majority of the other neurons belonging to the
reversal or forward ensembles (Fig. 4, I and J).
Also, a large fraction of neurons whose activity
was not exclusive to the forward or reversal
states was significantly down-regulated during
quiescence; notable among these were sensory
neurons that show spontaneous activity during
active brain states (Fig. 4K). In summary, qui-
escence during lethargus affects many neurons
of both the sensory and premotor domains.
Npr-1 animals exhibit an enhanced
sensory-motor transformation
How could npr-1 control the arousal thresholds
of animals? To address this question, we inter-
rogated our data for possible correlations between
sensory circuit activity and genotype, develop-
mental stage, or brain state. Mechanosensory and
nociceptive neurons exhibit weaker sensory re-
sponses during lethargus in N2 animals but not
in npr-1 animals (25, 30–32). In agreement with
this, npr-1 had nearly identical O2-evoked re-
sponses in URX and AQR in prelethargus versus
lethargus, but N2 had a larger variability in URX
responses during lethargus, with some neurons
not responding (fig. S8, A and B). Lethargus
npr-1 animals showed increased URX peak re-
sponses relative to lethargus N2 animals (fig.
S8B). Although URX peak responses correlated
with transient arousal (0 to 1 min after stimulus),
we did not find such a correlation with sustained
arousal (3 to 6 min after stimulus) (fig. S8, C
and D). However, N2 AQRs responded similarly
in prelethargus versus lethargus. Neither tran-
sient nor tonic responses in AQR (46) correlated
with transient or sustained arousal (fig. S8, E
to I). In summary, we did not find a striking
modulation of AQR and URX that could explain
the sustained arousal phenotype of npr-1 animals.
We found that npr-1 animals might have more
complex O2 sensory representations than N2, as
we more frequently observed responses from
AUA (a principal interneuron target of URX)
and RMG interneurons (fig. S9, A and B). More-
over, we found more putative IL2 sensory neuron
responses to O2 upshift in npr-1 animals (fig. S9C).
O2 sensory activity in IL2s, or in any other neuron
in the anterior ganglion, has not been reported
previously.
How do motor behavior–related brain dynam-
ics change in response to the stimulus? The
frequency of reversal command states, which
corresponds to the frequency of cycles through
the motor command sequence, was up-regulated
at 21% O2 in npr-1 animals but not in N2 animals
(fig. S10), showing that in comparison to N2,
npr-1 animals exhibit a more effective sensory-
motor transformation in both prelethargus and
lethargus stages. This is consistent with findings
in adult animals (47). This effect could be caused
by a more complex sensory representation of O2
stimuli. As npr-1–mediated sustained arousal can
be rescued in RMG neurons, RMG modulation
might dampen the excitability of sensory circuits
in an npr-1–dependent manner, preventing O2-
evoked sustained motor dynamics in N2 animals.
Quiescence displays features of a
fixed-point attractor in neuronal
population dynamics
We next focused our analysis on the neurons that
were exempt from down-regulation during qui-
escence. Most prominent among these was the
GABAergic and peptidergic sleep-active inter-
neuron RIS, which exhibited Ca2+ plateaus during
the forward state and remained active during
quiescence (Fig. 4, B, L, and M); this observation
is consistent with previous RIS recordings at
low temporal resolution in unconstrained ani-
mals (29). Relative to prelethargus animals, RIS
activity is elevated during the forward period in
lethargus animals, which suggests that elevated
RIS activity increases the likelihood of entering
the quiescent state and that RIS activity during
the forward state may reflect sleep pressure
(Fig. 4, L and M). Besides RIS, other GABAergic
head neurons such as RMED and RMEV, which
are active during the forward state (44) (Fig. 4,
A and I, and fig. S11), showed residual (i.e.,
reduced-amplitude) Ca2+ plateaus during qui-
escence. This is consistent with increased GABA
signaling during mammalian sleep (2). Similar-
ly, the neuropeptidergic GABA uptake neuron
ALA, which is required for stress-induced qui-
escence in adults (26, 48–50), showed some spon-
taneous activity and was not down-regulated
during quiescence (Fig. 4K). In addition, the GABA
uptake neuron AVF (50) was only slightly down-
regulated during quiescence (Fig. 4K). Thus, al-
though RIS, RMED, and RMEV decrease activity
when the brain transitions from forward into a
reversal state (44), they maintain tonic (i.e., sus-
tained) activity when the system transitions into
the quiescent state.
We next sought to characterize how quies-
cence is embedded in the neuronal population
dynamics, where activities of subpopulations of
neurons move through the motor command cycle
described above (i.e., forward crawl, backward
crawl, dorsal or ventral turn, forward crawl, etc.).
Brain state evolution for populations of neurons
can be visualized by means of dimensionality
reduction techniques, such as principal compo-
nents analysis (PCA) (51). In our system, PCA was
used to visualize the motor command cycle (44),
which was readily observable in brain dynamics
of npr-1 animals (Fig. 5, A to D, fig. S6, and
movie S2). In contrast, periods of quiescence
were found to be bundled to small and confined
regions between the forward and reverse motor
command states (Fig. 5, B and D, fig. S6, and
movie S2). Therefore, although all other motor
command states feature phasic dynamics [i.e., a
continuous evolution through the motor com-
mand cycle via continuously changing neuronal
ensemble activities (44)], the confined bundling
of principal component trajectories indicated that
quiescence converged toward a fixed-point attrac-
tor. This fixed point reflects the down-regulation
of many neurons but is not merely at zero in
PCA space, as it is offset by the sustained ac-
tivity of neurons active during quiescence, such
as RIS.
Characteristic state transitions during
spontaneous and evoked arousal
Next, we sought to investigate how the quiescent
brain state switches to active in a spontaneous
and evoked manner. Spontaneous, short-lived
exits from quiescence occurred through both
forward and reversal states; however, 21% O2–
evoked exits from quiescence of npr-1 animals
exclusively occurred via a reversal state (Fig.
5E). In our previous work, we described two
types of reversal states named reversal 1, which
occurs after long forward periods (>3 s), and re-
versal 2, which occurs after short forward periods.
Reversals 1 and 2 are further distinguished from
each other by the delay times of Ca2+ transients
of individual neurons participating in the global
brain state transitions (44). Here we describe two
new types of reversal transitions, named spon-
taneous activating reversal and evoked reversal,
which correspond respectively to spontaneous or

 21% O2–evoked events that terminate quiescence.
Figure 5, F and G, summarizes results; fig. S12
shows details. Spontaneous activating reversals
feature early recruitment of some neurons (e.g.,
interneurons AIB and RIM; head motor neuron
SMDDL) but otherwise display a similar order
of Ca2+ signals as in reversal 1 (compare Fig. 5, F
and G; compare fig. S12, B and C). In contrast,
evoked reversals in npr-1 animals are rapid tran-
sitions exhibiting short phase delays between
neurons, a feature shared with reversal 2 (com-
pare Fig. 5, F and G; compare fig. S12, A and D).
This observation highlights a difference between
O2-evoked responses and a previously reported
nociceptive response, which during lethargus is
accompanied by a decorrelation of interneuron
activity (31). During evoked reversals, Ca2+ signals
of O2 sensory neurons URX, AQR, IL2, and
URX’s principal postsynaptic interneuron tar-
get AUA rose consistently earlier than all other
participating neurons (fig. S12, A and E). Thus,
spontaneous arousal from quiescence evolves
through a characteristic sequence of neuronal
ensemble activity, and O2 sensory circuits effec-
tively and rapidly recruit motor command ac-
tivity similar to that observed in already active
animals. Table S1 shows statistical tests for all
relevant comparisons.
Prolonged forward states transition
to quiescence
Next, we investigated how the active brain state
switches to quiescence. The great majority of
transitions into quiescence occurred through for-
ward states (Fig. 5H). We calculated the fractions
of reversal and quiescence transitions as a func-
tion of forward duration, which we define as the
time passed since AVA activity fall (Fig. 5, I to P).
Behavioral studies have shown that the duration of
forward episodes decays with two exponential time
constants (52, 53). We made a consistent obser-
vation with forward state durations in our im-
mobilized preparation: In both N2 and npr-1
prelethargus animals, most forward initiations
were terminated by a reversal command within
3 s, leading to continuation of active states (Fig. 5,
I, J, M, and N). In contrast, in lethargus animals
the distributions of forward lengths shifted to
longer durations (>3 s). Furthermore, instead of
observing constant transition rates into quies-
cence, we observed that the fraction of forward
periods ending in quiescence increased over for-
ward state duration, thereby exceeding the fraction
of reversal commands after 30 s (Fig. 5, K, L, O,
and P). This was the case for both N2 and npr-1
animals, except for npr-1 animals experiencing
21% O2 stimulation, where reversal command
probability remained relatively high throughout
the length of forward periods (Fig. 5L). These
data show that quiescence entry during lethargus
depends on the prior time that animals spent in
the forward period and that arousing sensory cues
can maintain the active brain state by triggering
reversal commands, thereby resetting the system
to another active period.
Our findings indicate that the low activity of
the NPR-1 neuropeptide receptor in wild C. elegans
confers regulation of a quiescent behavioral state
during lethargus in response to environmental
O2 conditions. This might be a self-protective
strategy in which low O2 could signify safer en-
vironments such as a social aggregate (37). EEG
signatures define the various stages of sleep in
mammals, although with low spatial resolution
(14). In contrast, sleep states in invertebrates have
so far mostly relied on the classical behavioral
definition of sleep (19–22, 54–56); however, local
field potential recordings and calcium imaging
in flies show neuronal down-regulation during
sleep (9, 57). Our work reveals a global neuronal
signature of an invertebrate sleep state, which
modulates the activity of most individual active
neurons. Although active C. elegans exhibit pha-
sic neuronal population dynamics that repre-
sent the motor command states (44), quiescence
corresponds to a more stationary region around
a fixed point in neuronal state space. This attrac-
tor feature implies that the quiescent state is
an intrinsic network property and that sleep-
promoting neurons and brain centers—as reported
across many organisms (2, 29, 58–60)—might be
integral parts of neural networks, as opposed to
hierarchically organized top-down controllers. This
could enable an efficient means of changing the
global state of the brain via neuromodulators by
subtly changing its state bias, as opposed to in-
stantaneous reprogramming of all its individual
network components. During lethargus, the qui-
escence attractor can thus be seen as a default
state of the network that emerges in the absence
of arousing inputs. Dedicated sensory circuits
can rapidly switch the brain state to active by
recruiting behavior-related neuronal population
dynamics. Conversely, during nonlethargic phases
such as prelethargus, the putative default state is
maintained activity (switching among forward,
reverse, and turning) regardless of the sensory
input. Building on recent studies reporting the
requirement for neuropeptides, we suggest that
these neuromodulators are crucial for establish-
ing the propensity for the quiescent network state
during lethargus (19, 29, 49, 61–63). Therefore,
global brain states are likely controlled by multi-
ple signals antagonizing or promoting arousal and
quiescence, and which originate from both the
environment and the internal state of the animal.
It is possible that the quiescence brain state in
C. elegans serves a function equivalent to the de-
fault mode in the human brain, which corresponds
to intrinsic functional activity of the awake brain
at rest (64, 65). Moreover, we find differences as
well as parallels between mammalian deep sleep
and C. elegans lethargus. Ensembles of cortical
neurons exhibit periodic high-amplitude oscilla-
tions (delta wave) during deep sleep (10), whereas
the C. elegans brain during lethargus nonperiodi-
cally fluctuates between quiescence and short
active bouts. However, both have periods of al-
most complete down-regulation of neuronal ac-
tivity: the trough of the delta wave oscillation in
mammals (10–12) and brainwide quiescence in
C. elegans. In addition, the short active bouts re-
semble micro-arousals occurring during mam-
malian deep sleep (12, 66). We thus provide a
neuronal imaging paradigm to study the en-
docrine control, network mechanisms, evolu-
tion, and basic functions of global brain states
such as active wakefulness, rest, and sleep.
