Background: Pimobendan is effective in treatment of dogs with congestive heart failure (CHF) secondary to myxomatous
mitral valve disease (MMVD). Its effect on dogs before the onset of CHF is unknown.
Hypothesis/Objectives: Administration of pimobendan (0.4–0.6 mg/kg/d in divided doses) to dogs with increased heart
size secondary to preclinical MMVD, not receiving other cardiovascular medications, will delay the onset of signs of CHF,
cardiac-related death, or euthanasia.
Animals: 360 client-owned dogs with MMVD with left atrial-to-aortic ratio ≥1.6, normalized left ventricular internal
diameter in diastole ≥1.7, and vertebral heart sum >10.5.
Methods: Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded, multicenter clinical trial. Primary outcome variable was
time to a composite of the onset of CHF, cardiac-related death, or euthanasia.
Results: Median time to primary endpoint was 1228 days (95% CI: 856–NA) in the pimobendan group and 766 days
(95% CI: 667–875) in the placebo group (P = .0038). Hazard ratio for the pimobendan group was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.47–0.87)
compared with the placebo group. The benefit persisted after adjustment for other variables. Adverse events were not differ-
ent between treatment groups. Dogs in the pimobendan group lived longer (median survival time was 1059 days (95% CI:
952–NA) in the pimobendan group and 902 days (95% CI: 747–1061) in the placebo group) (P = .012).
Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Administration of pimobendan to dogs with MMVD and echocardiographic and
radiographic evidence of cardiomegaly results in prolongation of preclinical period and is safe and well tolerated. Prolonga-
tion of preclinical period by approximately 15 months represents substantial clinical benefit.

yxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the
most
common
cardiovascular
disease
in
the
dog.1,2 Progressive degenerative lesions of the valve
result in mitral regurgitation (MR) imposing a gradu-
ally increasing chronic volume load on the left side of
the heart. In some dogs, the volume load will result in
clinically detectable enlargement of the left side of the
heart and might eventually result in the development of
signs of congestive heart failure (CHF), that is, pul-
monary venous congestion and edema.
Dogs with MMVD can progress through various
stages of the disease. One widely used staging system
for this condition divides affected dogs into 4 cate-
gories.3 Those at risk for developing the disease are
considered to be at stage A; those with evidence of
MR and no signs of CHF are at stage B; those with
signs of CHF are at stage C; and those with signs of
CHF refractory to treatment are considered to be at
stage D. Stage B, the preclinical period, is a long per-
iod characterized by varying degrees of progression.4
Dogs with early stage B disease and no evidence of
cardiac enlargement are categorized as stage B1; dogs
in which cardiac enlargement has developed in order
to compensate for the volume load, but which have
not yet developed signs of CHF, are categorized as
stage B2.
A number of therapies are considered effective in
dogs with stage C disease3 including pimobendan, which
has been shown to improve survival and maintain qual-
ity of life.5 Despite the effectiveness of recommended
treatments3, median survival time for dogs with stage C
disease is less than 1 year.5
Due to the lengthy nature of the preclinical period,
any treatment effective in prolonging this period could
have a major impact on longevity and quality of life of
affected dogs. Currently, there is no consensus about
the effectiveness of medical treatment in stage B despite
2 published prospective randomized clinical trials that
evaluated the effectiveness of angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) at this stage.6,7 In these stud-
ies, although no clearly beneficial effect of ACEI was
found, the median period free of signs of CHF for dogs
with stage B2 disease was approximately 27 months
(800 days).
The effectiveness of pimobendan in dogs with stage
B2 disease has not been previously evaluated. The
mechanism of action of pimobendan includes a combi-
nation of positive inotropy and balanced vasodilatation
caused by calcium sensitization and phosphodiesterase
inhibition.8 Four previous studies, 1 evaluating dogs
with preclinical dilated cardiomyopathy and 3 concern-
ing dogs with stage C MMVD, demonstrated that
pimobendan use is associated with a reduction in heart
size.9–12 A reduction in heart size might also be benefi-
cial in dogs with stage B2 MMVD, provided adequate
systemic perfusion is maintained.
On the basis of the known actions of pimobendan,
we hypothesized that the chronic oral administration of
pimobendan in dogs with evidence of increased heart
size secondary to preclinical MMVD, not receiving any
other cardiovascular medications, would delay the onset
of signs of CHF or cardiac-related death or euthanasia
compared to similar dogs not receiving pimobendan.
Materials and Methods
Trial Design
The “Evaluation of Pimobendan In dogs with Cardiomegaly
caused by preclinical mitral valve disease” (EPIC) trial was a prospec-
tive multicenter, blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study. The
trial protocol was prepared by independent cardiologists (AB, JH,
and SG) in conjunction with the sponsor and was approved by an eth-
ical review committee at each site where this was required. The

Dogs
Enrollment Criteria. Dogs were eligible for participation in the
study provided that the owner had given informed consent.
To be eligible for inclusion, a dog had to be 6 years of age or
older, have a body weight ≥4.1 and ≤15 kg, have a characteristic sys-
tolic heart murmur of moderate to high intensity (≥ grade 3/613) with
maximal intensity over the mitral area, have echocardiographic evi-
dence of advanced MMVD defined as characteristic valvular lesions
of the mitral valve apparatus, MR on the color Doppler echocardio-
gram, and have echocardiographic evidence of left atrial and left
ventricular dilatation, defined as a left atrial-to-aortic root ratio
(LA/Ao)14 ≥ 1.6 and body weight normalized left ventricular internal
diameter in diastole (LVIDDN)15 ≥ 1.7, in addition to radiographic
evidence of cardiomegaly (vertebral heart sum (VHS) > 10.5).16
Exclusion Criteria. Dogs were excluded from the study if they
had any of the following: known clinically important systemic or
other organ-related disease that was expected to limit the dog’s life
expectancy or required chronic cardiovascular medication precluded
as part of the trial (Table 1). Dogs with hypothyroidism could be
included provided the investigator deemed them clinically stable on
treatment. Dogs with current or previous evidence of cardiogenic
pulmonary edema, pulmonary venous congestion or both, cardiac
disease other than MMVD, clinically significant supraventricular,
ventricular tachyarrhythmias or both (i.e, requiring antiarrhythmic
treatment), or evidence of pulmonary hypertension considered to be
clinically relevant (RV:RA pressure gradient > 65 mmHg) were
excluded. Dogs with a history of chronic or recent administration
(>14 days of duration or within 30 days of intended enrollment) of
any medication listed in Table 1 were excluded. Dogs that were
pregnant or lactating were not eligible for enrollment. In the event
that before study enrollment, a dog had received short-term treat-
ment (<14 days) with agents listed in Table 1, but was no longer
receiving treatment and had not received it within 30 days of
intended enrollment, then the dog was eligible for inclusion.
Study Sites
Dogs were recruited by investigators specializing in veterinary
cardiology at 36 centers: 18 in the United States, 3 in the UK, 3 in
Germany, 3 in France, 2 in Japan, 2 in Sweden, 1 in each of Italy,
Spain, the Netherlands, Canada, and Australia. (All authors
except one (PW) were investigators recruiting cases).
Randomization and Allocation
Block randomization17 was used with a 1:1 allocation ratio in
blocks of 20 to maintain similar sample sizes in both treatment
groups. The randomization sequence was generated by the manu-
facturer of the trial medicationa by computer software.b Each
investigator was initially assigned 10 consecutive case numbers
from a block of 20, ensuring that each investigator did not know
how many cases assigned to each treatment were under their care.
When an investigator recruited a new dog, that dog was assigned
the next available case number and received the preassigned treat-
ment. During recruitment, some case numbers were reallocated
between investigators in order to reach the recruitment target.
Case numbers reallocated to an investigator were always from a
treatment block different to that from which the investigator’s
original 10 case numbers came. The maximum allowable number
of cases enrolled by any single center was 20.
Blinding
Investigators, owners, study monitors, the statisticianc , and the
sponsor were blinded to treatment allocation.
The blinding code for the treatment groups was held by individ-
uals who had no other role in the study. Predefined procedures
were available to permit unblinding of individual cases in the event
of a medical emergency. Unblinding could be achieved by contact-
ing named individuals who held the randomization list; they could
then break the treatment code and inform the investigator of the
treatment the animal was receiving. In the event of unblinding, a
dog would be censored from the study at the time of unblinding.
Neither the investigators, nor the monitor, nor the sponsor of the
study had access to the randomization list.
Trial Medication
Pimobendan verum (Vetmedin 2.5 mg chewable tablets) was
administered PO at a target dose of 0.4–0.6 mg/kg/d as per regis-
tered label instructions in most countries where the product was
licensed. The calculated daily dose was divided into 2 administra-
tions and adjusted to a suitable number of tablets. Placebo was

Prohibited cardiovascular agents. Chronic administration of these agents before study entry was an exclu-
sion criterion. Initiation of any of these agents during the study was considered an event in the time-to-first-event
analysis. Initiation of chronic treatment resulted in a dog being censored from the per-protocol population.

 administered PO according to the calculated daily dose for
pimobendan verum tablets, divided into 2 administrations, and
adjusted to a suitable number of placebo tablets. Placebo and
verum tablets and packaging containers were visually identical.
Dogs were dosed in the morning and evening approximately
12 hours apart. Dose of study medication was not adjusted
throughout the study.
Populations Analyzed
Any dog that was randomized and received at least 1 dose of
study medication was included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) pop-
ulation. Any dog in the ITT population that was confirmed to
have met all inclusion criteria (and none of the exclusion criteria)
was included in the per-protocol (PP) population until one of the
following occurred: the dog reached the primary endpoint, the dog
was censored from the primary endpoint analysis due to the occur-
rence of an event that precluded continuation in that population,
or the end of the study was reached.
Concomitant Treatments
All concomitant medications that dogs were receiving at the
time of enrollment or received during the course of the study were
recorded.
A dog was censored from the per-protocol (PP) primary end-
point analysis if an attending veterinarian deemed it necessary to
chronically administer open-label cardiovascular medication(s) for
an indication other than having reached the primary endpoint. A
list of such cardiovascular medications (Table 1) was prospectively
defined and included in the protocol. An exception to this rule
was that short-term use of medications in Table 1 was allowed for
a period of <5 days if a dog required anesthesia or sedation, or in
the event that a dog enrolled in the study was inadvertently
administered one of the medications listed in Table 1 for a period
of <3 days, but the reason for administration was not substanti-
ated and chronic medication was unnecessary. Medications, the
chronic administration of which did not result in a dog being cen-
sored from the PP analysis of the primary endpoint, were prede-
fined in the protocol and are listed in Table 2. Initiation of
chronic treatment with any medication in Table 1 or Table 2 was
recorded as an event. All commercially available topical treatments
for ears and eyes were allowed even if some ingredients are found
in Tables 1 and 2, and their chronic administration was not con-
sidered an event nor did they preclude enrollment in the study.
Schedule of Events
Before inclusion, a case history was taken for each dog. The
dog then underwent a physical examination, measurement of sys-
tolic arterial blood pressure (SAP), echocardiography, thoracic
radiography, and routine hematology and blood biochemistry
(performed at laboratories local to each investigator) with a mini-
mum database consisting of packed cell volume (PCV), ALT
(GPT), total protein, creatinine, potassium (K+), and sodium
(Na+) concentrations. Re-examinations were scheduled at day 35,
and approximately 4 months after inclusion. Thereafter, the dogs
were scheduled for re-examination every 4 months. Dogs enrolled
to the study underwent appropriate clinical monitoring including
home monitoring of respiratory rate.
A dog that reached the primary endpoint and survived was
treated with open-label pimobendan and other cardiovascular
medications at the discretion of the investigator. All dogs in the
ITT population were followed until they died, were euthanized,
were lost to follow-up, or the end of the study was reached. The
date of death, if it was known to have occurred, was recorded.
Clinical Evaluation
At inclusion, dog characteristics such as breed, age, sex, and
neutering status were documented. The body weight, body condi-
tion score (BCS)d, and rectal temperature were measured.
Quality-of-Life Observations
After history taking and clinical examination, the following
variables were scored (according to the system outlined in Table 3):
appetite, demeanor, exercise tolerance, coughing, nocturnal dysp-
nea/cough, and fainting.
Circulatory and Respiratory Variables
The respiratory rate was measured. Cardiac auscultation was
performed to detect the presence of any arrhythmia, and to mea-
sure the heart rate and grade heart murmur intensity on a scale of
1–6.13
Systolic
arterial
blood
pressure
was
measured
before
inclusion by 1 of 2 methods: Doppler sphygmomanometry or
oscillometry.
Echocardiography
Echocardiography was performed on unsedated dogs. The fol-
lowing measurements were taken from at least 3 cardiac cycles
and the mean was recorded: the LA/Ao obtained from the right
parasternal short-axis 2D view as previously described,14 the left
ventricular internal diameter at end diastole (LVIDd), and left
ventricular internal diameter at end systole (LVIDs) measured on
the M-mode echocardiogram, obtained from the right parasternal
short-axis view.18 M-mode values were used to derive the frac-
tional shortening (FS%). Normalized dimensions15 were calculated
according
to
the
following
formulae:
normalized
LVIDd
(LVIDDN) = LVIDd(cm)/(BW
(kg))0.294;
normalized
LVIDs
(LVIDSN) = LVIDs(cm)/(BW(kg))0.315.
Thoracic Radiography
Thoracic radiography was performed at inclusion and at the
time a dog was considered to have developed signs of CHF. Right
lateral and dorsoventral projections were used to evaluate the tho-
rax. Cardiac size was assessed by the VHS method16 and pul-
monary edema and congestion were recorded, when considered to
be present, by the attending cardiologist.
Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint was a composite of the development of
left-sided CHF, or euthanasia for a cardiac reason, or death pre-
sumed to be cardiac in origin in dogs in the PP population. The
primary outcome variable of the study was the time period from
inclusion until the primary endpoint was reached.

 A dog was considered to have left-sided CHF when there was
radiographic evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary edema as indi-
cated by an interstitial or alveolar lung pattern. In addition to
these radiographic findings, the dog must have been showing con-
temporaneous clinical signs consistent with left-sided CHF includ-
ing increased respiratory effort and rate by comparison with
previously noted values for this patient.
Two members of an endpoint committee, comprised of the 3
lead investigators (AB, JH, and SG) and 2 additional investigators
(RSt and GW), reviewed the radiographs and case records for
each dog reaching the CHF component of the primary endpoint in
order to verify that the endpoint had been reached. In the event of
a disagreement between the 2 members of the endpoint committee,
the case was adjudicated by a third endpoint committee member.
Endpoint
committee
members
did
not
evaluate
their
own
cases and were blinded to treatment allocation at the time of
adjudication.
If a dog died in the absence of evidence of a noncardiac cause
of death before radiographic confirmation of pulmonary edema, it
was also considered to have experienced cardiac death and there-
fore reached the primary endpoint.
Dogs that reached the primary endpoint and in which no rele-
vant protocol deviation or violations occurred during the study
were included in the PP analysis. Dogs in which a major protocol
deviation occurred during the study (e.g, the owner was not com-
pliant with study procedures, or there were lengthy treatment gaps
comprising a single period without trial medication of >30 days or
the total duration of period without medication was >10% of the
dog’s total time on study) were included in the PP analysis until
the time when the protocol deviation occurred, at which time they
were censored. However, these dogs could still be eligible for inclu-
sion in the ITT analyses.
At any point in the study, an owner or investigator could
remove a dog from the study for reasons of animal welfare, sus-
pected adverse drug reaction, and illness or injury that prohibited
the dog’s continuation.
Secondary Endpoints
A dog was considered to have experienced an event if it reached
the primary endpoint, underwent euthanasia or died for a noncar-
diac reason, had chronic medication initiated (Table 1 or Table 2),
had a CHF endpoint that was not verified by the endpoint com-
mittee, the owner became noncompliant with study procedures,
experienced lengthy treatment gaps, or the dog was withdrawn
from the study by the owner or investigator. The time to the first
of these events experienced by dogs in the PP population was ana-
lyzed as a prospectively defined secondary endpoint. (For further
information, see Table S2).
Time to death by any cause was also a prospectively defined
secondary endpoint and analyzed in the ITT population.
Appropriate pharmacovigilance was undertaken and adverse
events experienced by dogs on the study were noted, classified,
and reported in accordance with applicable guidelines.
Data Management
Data management was undertaken by an independent data
management company.e All clinical and dispenser records were
collected from all centers. Data were verified and double entered
into a database by separate individuals. After data entry, the 2 sets
of data were compared to verify accuracy of entry of data and any
discrepancies between the 2 databases were explored and resolved.

1769
 Blinding was maintained during data entry and audit. All decisions
on censoring and exclusions from the study were made on the
basis of predetermined criteria by the members of the lead com-
mittee who remained blinded.
Statistical Methods
Power Calculation. Power calculations for study population size
were performed by nQuery platform.f The planned duration of the
accrual period was 2 years and the maximum duration of follow-
up was 5 years. A minimum of 3 years follow-up was planned
after the accrual period. Results of prior studies had shown that
the median time to the onset of left-sided CHF in dogs with stage
B2
MMVD
is
approximately
27 months.6,7
Based
on
these
assumptions, 150 animals per group were considered necessary to
detect a difference in median time to the onset of left-sided CHF
of greater than or equal to 13 months with a power of 80% and
an alpha of 5%. To compensate for possible dropouts, 180 ani-
mals per group were included in each treatment group.
Populations Analyzed. In both the interim and final analyses, all
efficacy analyses with respect to the primary endpoint were
planned as analyses comparing treatment groups in the PP popula-
tion. Time to first event was also compared between treatment
groups in the PP population. The safety analyses, all-cause mortal-
ity, and proportion of suspected serious or worse adverse events
were evaluated in the ITT population.
Interim Analysis. A preplanned interim analysis was undertaken
with predefined stopping criteria for convincing evidence of effi-
cacy and safety, performed on data obtained after 80% of the ini-
tial
anticipated study
period
was
complete.

ology. The P-value for stopping on the basis of convincing evi-
dence of efficacy with respect to the primary endpoint was decided
by appropriate statistical softwaref and set at P < .01477.

are reported as median values with interquartile range (IQR); for
categorical and ordinal variables, they are reported as frequency
and proportions. For the analysis of the final data, each of the
variables obtained at baseline was assessed for homogeneity
between treatment groups in the PP populations. All continuous
and ordinal baseline variables were compared between groups by a
Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. For categorical data, a chi-square
or Fisher’s exact test was used. No adjustment was made for mul-
tiple comparisons. The P-value for the final analysis was corrected
according to the O’Brien-Fleming alpha spending function.19 The
critical two-sided nominal efficacy alpha level for the final analysis
was calculated to be 0.04551 by appropriate statistical software.g
The local alpha levels were calculated for a total type I error level
of 5% with a power of 80 % and the assumptions of a hazard
ratio of 0.667 and proportional hazards.
In time-to-event analyses, a log-rank test with right censoring
was used to determine whether a significant difference existed
between the 2 treatment groups in the probability of the event of
interest occurring at any time point. The Kaplan-Meier method
was used to estimate the median time to endpoint for each treat-
ment group and plot time to event curves.
Univariate Cox proportional hazards analysis with right censor-
ing was performed for the effect of treatment and each baseline
variable, to determine whether there was any association with time
to primary endpoint. For the purpose of the Cox proportional
hazards analysis, categories of ordinal baseline variables with a
small number of observations (<5 observations) at a single level
were combined with the adjacent level to create a larger group
with the same directional tendency. The robustness of the treat-
ment effect was evaluated by adjusted univariable Cox propor-
tional hazards analysis to determine the influence of each baseline
variable individually on the treatment hazard ratio. Multivariable
Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed in a backward
stepwise manner. Baseline variables were selected for entry to the
model if they had a P-value of <.2 in the univariate analysis. Vari-
ables entered into the multivariable analysis were assessed for mul-
ticollinearity
and
to
ensure
that
the
proportional
hazards
assumption was met. The variable with the highest P-value was
eliminated at each subsequent step, with reanalysis between steps,
until the final model was obtained with all the remaining variables
having a P-value <.05. A second exploratory multivariable model
was created as above but excluding echocardiographic variables in
the first iteration, and also run in a backward stepwise manner
until all variables in the final model had a P-value <.05. First-
order interaction terms between each pair of variables remaining
in the final model were evaluated and included in each model if
found to be significant.
Proportions of dogs that experienced severe or worse adverse
events were compared between groups by a chi-square test.
For all analyses other than those specifically mentioned above,
an alpha of 5% was used. All analyses were two-tailed. Statistical
analyses were performed by a statisticianc independent of the
sponsor by a commercially available software program.h

Results
Recruitment to the study began in October 2010 and
finished in June 2013. Follow-up was continued until
the study was closed on the first of March 2015. The
interim analysis was conducted in January 2015 on data
collected up to October 1, 2014, in which the criteria
for unblinding and stopping the study were met with
respect to the time to primary endpoint. The statistician
and 1 lead investigator (AB) were therefore unblinded
at this time. All other lead investigators (JH and SG)
and
those
involved
in
data management
remained
blinded until data entry was complete.
Three hundred and sixty dogs were enrolled in the
study and randomized to receive trial medication. The
median number of dogs recruited per center was 9
(range 1–20). One dog was allocated a case number but
did not complete enrollment and never received trial
medication. The outcome for the remaining 359 dogs in
the ITT population is summarized in Figure 1. After
randomization, 4 dogs randomized to placebo and 1
dog randomized to pimobendan were excluded because
they were subsequently found to have failed an inclu-
sion criterion (4 dogs did not meet at least one of the
heart size criteria and 1 dog had been chronically pre-
treated before enrollment to the study). The remaining
354 dogs—178 receiving pimobendan and 176 receiving
placebo—comprised the PP population. The PP popula-
tion consisted of 161 (45.5%) Cavalier King Charles
Spaniels (CKCS), 21 (5.9%) Dachshunds, 13 (3.7%)
Miniature Schnauzers, 8 (2.3%) each of Poodles and
Yorkshire Terriers, 98 (27.7%) other pure breeds, and
45 (12.7%) mixed breeds. The median age of the
enrolled population was 9.0 years (IQR 7–11).

 Baseline characteristics of the 2 groups were summa-
rized and compared (Table 4). The groups were balanced
for all baseline variables with the exception of breed and
BCS. In the PP population of dogs receiving pimoben-
dan, the median dose received was 0.49 mg/kg/d (IQR
0.441–0.528) divided into 2 doses.
The median time in study for the PP population was
623 days (IQR 292–959). One hundred and sixty-two of
the 354 dogs reached the primary endpoint giving an
overall event rate of 45.8%. The median time in study
for all dogs that reached the primary endpoint was
433.5 days (IQR 242-718). One hundred and ninety-two
dogs were censored from the analysis of the primary
endpoint, including 104 dogs receiving pimobendan and
88 dogs receiving placebo. Of these, 79 dogs (54 dogs
receiving pimobendan and 25 dogs receiving placebo)
were still alive, not having reached the primary end-
point, at the end of the study. The median time in study
for these dogs was 1056 days (IQR 976-1238). The
cause of censoring for the remaining 113 dogs is shown
in Figure 1. The median time in study for these 113
dogs was 502 days (IQR 228–787). The proportion of
dogs reaching the primary endpoint was not different
between groups (pimobendan, 74/178 (41.6%); placebo,
88/176 (50.0%); P = .14).
The estimated median time to the primary endpoint
was 1228 days (95% confidence intervals (CI): 856–NA)
in the pimobendan group and 766 days in the placebo
group (95% CI: 667–875) (Fig 2). The risk of a dog in
the pimobendan group reaching the primary endpoint,
at any time point, was lower (P = .0038) and the hazard
ratio was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.47–0.87) compared with a
dog in the placebo group. The times taken for dogs in
the 2 treatment groups to reach the individual compo-
nents of the composite primary endpoint were com-
pared and are summarized in Table 5. The proportions
of dogs in each group experiencing each of the 3 indi-
vidual components of the primary endpoint, CHF,
spontaneous cardiac death, and cardiac euthanasia,
were not different between groups (P = .063, P = .134,
and P = .218).
Nine dogs initially thought to have developed CHF
did not have the presence of radiographic signs of CHF
verified by the endpoint committee. Three of these dogs
were in the pimobendan group and 6 in the placebo
group. Failure to confirm CHF was either due to

 radiographs being present but failing to demonstrate
evidence of an interstitial/alveolar lung pattern, or
radiographs not having been obtained at the time of the
CHF event. In 8 of these cases, medications listed in
Table 1 were administered and these dogs were there-
fore censored at the time of the suspected heart failure
for receiving precluded medication. In 1 case, severe
clinical signs resulted in euthanasia of the patient before
radiographic
confirmation
of
CHF
and
this
was
subsequently (before unblinding) reclassified as a car-
diac-related euthanasia.
In the time-to-first-event analysis, 130 dogs in the
pimobendan group and 158 dogs in the placebo group
experienced an event. Forty-eight dogs in the pimoben-
dan group and 18 dogs in the placebo group were cen-
sored in this analysis. The median time to the first event
was 640 (95% CI: 555–753) days in the pimobendan
group versus 406 (95% CI: 316–527) days in the placebo

estimated hazard ratio never included the value 1 (Fig-
ure S2). In the univariate Cox proportional hazards
analysis, in addition to treatment, of the 32 baseline
variables tested, the following 16 variables demon-
strated an association with the time to primary end-
point at P < .2 and were entered in the first iteration of
the multivariable analysis: Miniature Schnauzer (yes/
no), appetite, exercise tolerance, fainting, respiratory
effort, cough, nocturnal coughing/dyspnea, respiratory
rate, heart rate, SAP, VHS, FS%, LVIDDN, LA/Ao,
PCV, and creatinine. The final model of the multivari-
able analysis is summarized in Table 7 (and Figure S3).
The final multivariable model without inclusion of
echocardiographic measurements is detailed in Table 8.

One hundred and eighty-six dogs were known to have
died by any cause at the date of study closure, 83 of
179 dogs (46.4%) in the pimobendan group and 103 of
180 dogs (57.2%) in the placebo group (P = .0260). The
median time to death by all causes was 1059 (95% CI:
952–NA) days in the pimobendan group and 902 (95%
CI: 747–1061) days in the placebo group (P = .012)

Discussion
Myxomatous mitral valve disease is the leading cause
of heart disease in dogs, and development of CHF
results in substantial morbidity and mortality.2,21 The
EPIC study has shown, for the first time, convincing evi-
dence of benefit of a treatment before the onset of CHF
in dogs with cardiac enlargement secondary to MMVD
(stage B2). Dogs receiving pimobendan had approxi-
mately two-thirds the risk of reaching the primary end-
point compared with dogs on placebo. This resulted in a

Pimobendan in Preclinical Mitral Valve Disease
1773
 60% prolongation of the preclinical period with dogs
receiving pimobendan taking, on average, an additional
462 days, or approximately 15 months, to develop CHF
or die as a consequence of MMVD. The subanalyses of
the primary endpoint suggest that the majority of this
benefit was attributable to delaying the onset of CHF,
with relatively few dogs meeting the endpoint by experi-
encing cardiac death or euthanasia (Table 5). Overall
survival was longer in the dogs receiving pimobendan in
the ITT population, which included dogs experiencing
death or euthanasia due to noncardiac causes. This indi-
cates that chronic administration of pimobendan in this
population was safe. Fewer dogs in the pimobendan
group were censored before reaching the end of the
study. The treatment effect of pimobendan was robust
and persisted comparatively unchanged after adjustment
for each of the baseline characteristics, either individu-
ally, or in combination in the multivariable analyses. In
the explanatory multivariable analysis, the treatment
effect was strengthened with a lower hazard ratio and
narrower confidence intervals after the confounding
effect of other dog characteristics measured at baseline
was taken into account.
As well as confirming the strength of the treatment
effect, the multivariable analysis confirmed the predic-
tive importance of absolute heart size with respect to
the onset of CHF as previously reported.22,23 Two sepa-
rate echocardiographic indicators of heart size, LA/Ao
and
LVIDDN,
were
strongly
and
independently
associated with time to the primary endpoint in the
final explanatory multivariable model. Two other non-
treatment
variables
remaining
in
the
model
were
increased FS% and reduced appetite. Increased FS%
might, in this situation, represent a surrogate measure
of the severity of MR with a larger total left ventricular
stroke volume being associated with worse regurgita-
tion. The significant effect of reduced appetite persisted
in the final model despite there being relatively few dogs
with this finding. This supports the previously described
negative prognostic significance of reduced appetite in
dogs with MMVD.24
The
exploratory
multivariable
model,
excluding
echocardiographic variables, confirmed the prognostic
value of widely used clinical and radiographic measure-
ments. This analysis was performed in order to provide
information of prognostic value for patients encoun-
tered in a setting where accurate echocardiographic
measurements
might
not
be
available;
however,
it
should be borne in mind when interpreting these results
that all dogs included in the analyses also met the
echocardiographic inclusion criteria and these results
therefore might not be generalizable to all dogs with a
VHS > 10.5 in the absence of concurrent echocardio-
graphic measurements and a confirmed diagnosis of
MMVD. In our population, increased VHS, lower SAP,
and higher heart rate were all independently associated
with a worse outcome, although reduced appetite was
not found to be significant in this model. The fact that
appetite was not included in both final models (explana-
tory and exploratory) suggests that the effect of this
variable is not stable when other variables are consid-
ered at the same time. Although a lower (but within ref-
erence
range)
blood
pressure
has
previously
been
described in dogs with severe MMVD, when compared
to dogs with mild to moderate disease,25,26 this is the
first study to demonstrate a worse outcome associated
with lower blood pressure, even though no dog enrolled
to the study would have been considered clinically
hypotensive.
Radiographically
evident
cardiomegaly
and increased heart rate have previously been reported
to predict a worse outcome.6,7
The EPIC study design has several notable strengths.
It is the largest prospective, randomized clinical trial in
small animal cardiovascular medicine. It is comparable
in size to average-sized studies of human patients with
cardiovascular disease; with 360 enrolled patients, it
would fall within the interquartile range of similar stud-
ies of human patients.27 All CHF endpoints were inde-
pendently verified by an endpoint committee. Events
other than reaching the primary endpoint which could
have been influenced by the administration of trial med-
ication were also captured in the secondary endpoint of
“time to first event”. Analysis of this secondary end-
point demonstrated a significant difference in favor of
the group receiving pimobendan, with a P-value lower
than that found in the primary endpoint analysis. This
might imply that pimobendan delayed the onset of
events other than those incorporated in the primary
endpoint, for example, coughing, right-sided CHF, and
syncope. An additional strength of the study is the

 absence of the confounding effect of any concurrent
cardiovascular medications; however, this restriction led
to it being necessary to censor a number of the dogs
from the primary endpoint analyses when the introduc-
tion of these drugs was required. A greater number of
dogs in the placebo group needed to be censored from
the study for this reason.

strated convincing evidence of efficacy with respect to
the primary endpoint. The decision to stop a clinical
trial is a difficult one and involves weighing up the
validity of the conclusions that can be drawn from a
foreshortened study against the risks to animals remain-
ing in a treatment trial where 1 method of treatment
appears clearly more efficacious than the other.28 There
are risks associated with the premature termination of

 studies in response to results obtained at interim analy-
ses. Such a study might overestimate the benefit of the
treatment effect by basing the results on observation of
a smaller number of events than originally anticipated.29
The risk of such an erroneous result is relatively low in
the current study. Only 1 interim analysis was planned
and only 1 was conducted. This was performed after
4 years when the study was almost 80% complete and
all the anticipated patients had been recruited to the
study. The final analysis included data acquired during
a further 5 months of follow-up, meaning that the final
duration of the study was nearly 90% of the duration
originally planned. Finally, to minimize the risk of
obtaining a “false-positive” study result, the O’Brien-
Fleming alpha spending function19 was used to set the
P-value to be used for the interim analysis and the
adjustment of the P-value in the final analysis.
Cardiac-related death, either spontaneous or due to
euthanasia, was incorporated as part of the primary
endpoint in the EPIC study, as this was known to be
an infrequent but important manifestation of MMVD
that might occur in dogs with stage B2 disease. An
important reason to include, rather than censor, this
outcome was that concerns had previously been raised
about possible detrimental effects of the administration
pimobendan to dogs with preclinical MMVD.30,31 If
our primary endpoint had focused exclusively on the
onset of CHF, with dogs that died being censored, it
might have appeared that we were choosing to ignore
potentially detrimental effects of the treatment. We
found, not unexpectedly, that only a small number of
dogs met the primary endpoint in this way. Although a
greater number of dogs in the pimobendan group expe-
rienced spontaneous cardiac death (12 versus 5), the
proportion of dogs in each group experiencing this
event was not significantly different. A greater number
of dogs in the placebo group underwent cardiac-related
euthanasia (7 versus 3), but again the difference in pro-
portions between groups was not significant. Subanaly-
sis of the time to the separate components of the
primary endpoint suggested that the difference in out-
come observed between groups is largely attributable to
a delay in the onset of signs of CHF. Any previously
raised concerns regarding the safety of the medication
should be allayed by the longer survival observed in the
pimobendan group in the all-cause mortality analysis.
There was no difference between groups in the rate or
type of potential adverse events observed, indicating that
pimobendan administration is safe and well tolerated.
This is despite the fact that dogs in the pimobendan
group spent longer in the study and therefore were at
risk of experiencing adverse events for a longer period.
This clinical trial was fully sponsored by a pharmaceu-
tical company (as acknowledged), and industry funding
of studies is recognized as a potential source of bias in
clinical trials.32 However, it remains the case in studies

 of human patients that the majority of published clinical
trials are sponsored by industry.33 In the veterinary field,
there are no large independent funding organizations
comparable to the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
that are likely to be able to (or wish to) fund a study of
the magnitude of the one we describe; therefore, such
studies are only likely to be achieved with industry spon-
sorship. Potential explanations of the increased likeli-
hood of industry-sponsored research having positive
findings include the following: Industrial sponsors might
be more likely to support studies that are likely to suc-
ceed, industrial sponsors might design studies with an
inappropriate comparator group, or there might be pub-
lication bias with unsuccessful studies being less likely to
be published.34 In the current study, evaluating the use
of pimobendan for an indication where there is currently
no evidence of a benefit of other treatment, the most
appropriate comparator is a placebo, as was used. The
risk of publication bias was minimized by the existence
of a clause in the lead investigators’ contracts guarantee-
ing the right to publish irrespective of outcome.
Limitations
Diagnosis of CHF and confirmation of cardiac-
related death remain a challenge in clinical trials. In this
study, we attempted to minimize the impact of the first
of these challenges by use of an independent blinded
consensus verification of CHF endpoints.
It is not possible to irrefutably confirm whether any
death is cardiac related or not. In the case of dogs that
died spontaneously, the investigator classified the death
as being cardiac or noncardiac on the basis of the circum-
stances of the death and their own opinion. Postmortem
examinations were not systematically undertaken, and it
is therefore possible that in some cases, death was attrib-
uted to cardiac disease when in fact it was due to another
condition (and vice versa). The study also allowed car-
diac-related euthanasia as part of the primary endpoint.
Euthanasia is influenced by owner-related factors, but it
is likely to be precipitated by the animal having a poor
quality of life, and therefore, the frequency with which it
occurs is likely to be reduced by therapies that delay the
onset of clinical signs. The impact of individual owner-
related factors on this outcome should be minimized by
randomization of a large population, as was done in this
study. Comparatively few dogs met the primary endpoint
through experiencing spontaneous cardiac-related death
or euthanasia. The subanalysis of this component of the
primary endpoint did not show a significant difference
between groups. It appears that most of the observed
effect of pimobendan can be attributed to the delay in the
onset of CHF; therefore, the impact of any uncertainty in
the classification of such cases should be minimal and is
likely to be equally distributed between groups.
The recruitment period of the trial was longer than
originally expected, but this has had no impact on the
outcome of the study, as it was prematurely closed after
the findings of the interim analysis.
After the primary endpoint had been reached, all
dogs that developed CHF received pimobendan as part
of their treatment regime, but other treatment was no
longer controlled. Variability of such treatment could
not have had an impact on the major conclusions of the
study, but introduced a confounding factor in the all-
cause mortality analysis.
Generalizability of the Study
The results of this study are readily generalizable to the
large population of dogs at risk of developing MMVD.
The population recruited to the study was large, recruited
in numerous countries, by many investigators, and is typi-
cal of dogs with this disease. The breed, weight, and age
distribution of the population are similar to those of other
populations described with this condition.4,35 It is also
notable that the outcome for the placebo group, particu-
larly in time to the onset of CHF and event rate, in the cur-
rent study, was very similar to that reported in previous
studies conducted in dogs with preclinical MMVD.6,7 The
restricted weight range of dogs recruited to the study
reflected the weight range for which appropriate verum
and placebo study medication were available and was not
because of any hypothetical limited weight range in which
the treatment effect was expected to be seen. It is therefore
likely, although not proven, that the conclusions of this
study can be extrapolated to dogs of any bodyweight with
stage B2 MMVD. The conclusions of this study are only
relevant to dogs with cardiac enlargement secondary to
preclinical MMVD (stage B2) as all dogs entering the study
met or exceeded 3 different heart size criteria (LA/Ao ≥ 1.6,
LVIDDN ≥ 1.7, and VHS > 10.5) and no dogs without car-
diac enlargement were recruited to the study. Similarly, the
conclusions are only relevant to dogs with a murmur of at
least a grade 3/6 in intensity. Treatment with pimobendan
of all dogs that have a murmur compatible with the pres-
ence of MMVD would not be justified on the basis of the
findings of this study.
Conclusions
Chronic oral administration of pimobendan to dogs
with echocardiographic and radiographic evidence of
cardiomegaly secondary to MMVD, in the absence of
concurrent cardiovascular medication, results in the
prolongation of the preclinical period, and is safe and
well tolerated. The median time to the onset of CHF or
cardiac-related death was prolonged by approximately
15 months, and the risk of a dog experiencing this event
was reduced by approximately one-third; the majority
of the benefit observed was attributable to delaying the
onset of CHF. This substantial degree of prolongation
of the preclinical period is of clinical relevance and is of
importance to veterinarians and owners of dogs affected
by this common disease.
