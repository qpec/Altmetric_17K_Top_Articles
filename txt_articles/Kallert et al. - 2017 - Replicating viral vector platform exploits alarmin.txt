Viral infections lead to alarmin release and elicit potent cytotoxic effector T lymphocyte
(CTLeff) responses. Conversely, the induction of protective tumour-specific CTLeff and their
recruitment into the tumour remain challenging tasks. Here we show that lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) can be engineered to serve as a replication competent,
stably-attenuated immunotherapy vector (artLCMV). artLCMV delivers tumour-associated
antigens to dendritic cells for efficient CTL priming. Unlike replication-deficient vectors,
artLCMV targets also lymphoid tissue stroma cells expressing the alarmin interleukin-33.
By triggering interleukin-33 signals, artLCMV elicits CTLeff responses of higher magnitude
and functionality than those induced by replication-deficient vectors. Superior anti-tumour
efficacy of artLCMV immunotherapy depends on interleukin-33 signalling, and a massive
CTLeff influx triggers an inflammatory conversion of the tumour microenvironment.
Our observations suggest that replicating viral delivery systems can release alarmins for
improved anti-tumour efficacy. These mechanistic insights may outweigh safety concerns
around replicating viral vectors in cancer immunotherapy.

for

vaccine
formulations that should aim at delivering large numbers of
CD8 þ cytotoxic effector T lymphocytes (CTLeff) to the tumour
site while simultaneously establishing a pool of self-replenishing
memory cells for durable tumour control7–9. The immunological
response profile of replicating viral vaccines represents an
excellent match to these requirements10. By delivering tumour-
associated antigens (TAA) in the context of an acute viral
infection, such delivery systems should supply critical alarmin
signals, also referred to as damage-associated molecular patterns ,
as well as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) for
optimal CTL induction and differentiation11,12.
Classical tumour vaccination regimens such as peptides-in-
adjuvant showed only marginal clinical benefit, despite the
induction of sizeable tumour antigen-specific CTL responses13.
Major impediments include inefficient tumour infiltration and
efficacy of specific CTLeff (refs 14,15). Overcoming these hurdles
will critically depend on innate immune activation, which can be
achieved by virus-induced inflammation16.
Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), the prototype
member of the arenavirus family, elicits CTLeff responses of high
magnitude and cytolytic capacity, in combination with life-long
CTL immunity. These features, together with a low hazard profile
for humans, have rendered it a primary workhorse of immuno-
logists since the 1930s (ref. 17). Experimental LCMV infections in
humans have documented a systemic inflammatory reaction,
accompanied by a lymphoblastic reaction in peripheral blood18,
which was reminiscent of the massive CTLeff response in
infectious mononucleosis19. Accordingly, studies in accidentally
LCMV-infected
laboratory
workers
have
confirmed
that,
analogously to mice, high frequencies of effector memory CTL
are maintained for several years after a single acute infection20.
These features in combination with low seroprevalence in the
human population21,22 raised our interest in LCMV as a
live-attenuated
cancer
immunotherapy
platform,
to
deliver
TAA-specific
immunization
alongside
with
potent
innate
immune activation.
We and others have previously reported that interleukin-33
(IL-33) is a key driver of potent and protective CTLeff responses
to several replicating RNA and DNA viruses11. Subsequently,
IL-33 was found to also be essential for antiviral Th1 CD4
responses23 and for graft-versus-host disease24. Collectively, these
reports underscore the global significance of IL-33 in promoting
type 1 immune responses (reviewed in ref. 25), besides an
additional undisputed function in type 2 immune responses such
as in the context of allergy and immunity to parasites. Upon
release from necrotic cells, IL-33 signals through its receptor ST2
on activated CD8 þ T cells, thereby enhancing clonal expansion,
effector differentiation and ultimately CTL efficacy11. By contrast
to wild-type LCMV (LCMVwt), however, replication-deficient
LCMV-based vectors (rLCMV26) fail to trigger the IL-33 alarmin
pathway11.
Hence we engineer a TAA delivery platform based on
live-attenuated LCMV (artLCMV). Unlike replication-deficient
rLCMV vectors, artLCMV targets not only dendritic but also
lymphoid stromal cells, thereby triggering the IL-33–ST2 alarmin
pathway and inducing superior TAA-specific CTLeff responses.
The activation of critical innate immune pathways including
alarmins represents a discriminating feature of replicating
microbial delivery systems, which might be decisive for the
success of active cancer immunotherapy.
Results
Generation of genetically stable and live-attenuated artLCMV.
We aimed at combining tumour antigen vaccination with
infection-induced alarmin signals. Hence we sought a strategy
how to stably incorporate transgenes into replicating LCMV. The
virus’ genome consists of two negative-stranded RNA segments
designated L and S, respectively, encoding two viral genes each
(LCMVwt, Fig. 1a). 50 and 30 untranslated regions (UTR) and an
intergenic region (IGR) flank the ORFs on each segment (Fig. 1a).
Reverse genetic tools are available to efficiently tailor the
infectious
virus’
genome
for
medical
application26,27.
As
reported28, transgenes of interest can be accommodated in the
LCMV genome by segregating the viral glycoprotein (GPC) and
nucleoprotein (NP) genes onto artificially duplicated S segments
(SNP, SGP in r3LCMV, Fig. 1a). According to the originally
published vector design strategy28, both NP and GPC remain
under control of their respective regulatory RNA elements
(natural
positioning;
r3LCMV).
Genetic
and
phenotypic
stability represent key criteria for manufacturing and clinical
translation
of
live-attenuated
viral
vector
systems29,30.
Accordingly,
observations
on
transgene
loss
in
r3LCMV-
infected
animals (see
below) prompted
us to search
for
molecular strategies to stabilize r3LCMV genomes. By placing
GPC under 30UTR control, we generated viruses with an artificial
genome organization (artLCMV, Fig. 1a). The reasoning was that,
although a rare event in negative strand RNA viruses31,
inter-segmental recombination32 would reunite NP and GPC on
a single S segment, thereby deleting the transgenes (Fig. 1b). The
arenavirus promoter consists of an intra-segmental RNA hybrid
formed by a highly conserved stretch of 19–21 terminal
nucleotides in each segment’s 50UTR and 30UTR. Therefore,
viral promoter activity requires both, a 50UTR and a 30UTR
on
each
RNA
template
(Fig.
1b)33.
Unlike
in
r3LCMV,
a recombination event reuniting the NP and GPC ORFs of
artLCMV would occur at the expense of losing the 50UTR,
thus creating an inactive recombination product devoid of a
viral promoter (Fig. 1c). Both, r3LCMV and artLCMV were
significantly attenuated in cell culture (Fig. 1d). Flow cytometric
studies with green (GFP) and red fluorescent protein (tomato)
co-expressing viruses (r3LCMV-GFP/tom, artLCMV-GFP/tom)
revealed
that
red/green
double-positive
virions
were
out-
numbered by a 4tenfold excess of bi-segmented replication-
deficient particles, carrying either only SGP or SNP in combination
with the L segment (Fig. 1e, see Supplementary Fig. 1 for flow
cytometry gating strategies). An immunofocus assay (IFF)-based
quantification of SNP-only and SGP-only virions yielded analogous
results (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Hence, attenuation was, at least
in part, due to inefficient co-packaging of SNP and SGP segments.
To study the genetic stability of artLCMV and r3LCMV we
exploited AGR mice. Owing to targeted deletions of RAG1 (T-cell
and B-cell deficiency) as well as of the type I and type II
interferon genes, AGR mice readily reveal an attenuated virus’
reversion to virulence34. We measured viral loads in blood by IFF,
relying on the detection of the viral structural protein NP
(NP-IFF, Fig. 2a). Within the first 20 days after infection,
r3LCMV and artLCMV remained at considerably lower titres in
blood than LCMVwt, which was in line with published data
documenting in vivo attenuation of r3LCMV35. After 30–40 days,
however, r3LCMV-infected AGR mice reached NP-IFF titres
identical to those infected with LCMVwt. Conversely, artLCMV
viremia remained at low levels throughout the observation period
of 120 days (Fig. 2a). In artLCMV-infected animals, the
assessment of total infectivity by NP-IFF and the quantification
of GFP-expressing viruses by GFP-IFF yielded comparable titres
on day 5 as well as on day 120 after infection, indicating
that the transgene had been retained (Fig. 2b,c). In contrast,

 r3LCMV-GFP-infected mice turned GFP-IFF-negative while
abundant NP-IFF infectivity persisted, suggesting that the virus
had lost its transgene. Indeed, the viral NP was abundant in the
liver and spleen of r3LCMV-GFP-infected mice, as expected,
while GFP was absent (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 2b). In
contrast, liver and spleen of artLCMV-GFP-infected animals
exhibited dense green fluorescence (Fig. 2d, Supplementary
Fig. 2b; analogous data for blood monocytes in Supplementary
Fig. 2c). To verify whether r3LCMV-GFP had inactivated its
transgene by recombining its two S segments, as hypothesized
(Fig. 1b), we relied on an PCR with reverse transcription
(RT-PCR)-based sequencing strategy (Supplementary Fig. 2d).
Recombined S segment RNA species (Srec, Supplementary Fig. 2d)
reuniting NP and GPC sequences in a single RNA molecule were
detected in ten out of ten r3LCMV-GFP-infected AGR mice from
two independent series of experiments. In contrast, the blood of
11 artLCMV-infected mice was free of detectable Srec RNA.
Sequence analysis of Srec segments revealed that individual
non-homologous recombination events had occurred in each
animal, with breakpoints in the GFP–IGR border region (Fig. 1b,
Supplementary Fig. 2e). Genetic tags in the IGR and GPC
sequences of r3LCMV-GFP excluded laboratory contaminations
as potential confounder in these analyses and assigned genetic
elements in Srec to its parental SNP or SGP segments (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2f,g). We found that a cDNA-derived bi-segmented virus
with an exemplary Srec segment (Srec#1) grew to LCMVwt titres in
cell culture (Fig. 2e). In combination with the inefficient co-
packaging of SNP and SGP in tri-segmented particles (Fig. 1d), this
finding
explained
the
selective
advantage
and
consistent
outgrowth of Srec segments in r3LCMV-infected AGR mice.
Apathogenic artLCMV induces potent CTLeff responses. In vivo
attenuation represents a prerequisite for the use of live vaccine
delivery platforms in immunocompromised cancer patients.

 Infection of wt mice with LCMVwt, but not with artLCMV
resulted in viremia (Fig. 3a). Moreover, low level artLCMV
infectivity was only transiently detected in spleen and liver on day
4 and was cleared by day 7, whereas LCMVwt persisted for 10
days at high titres (Fig. 3b). LCMVwt can cause choriomeningitis
in accidentally infected humans and in mice the virus is
invariably lethal at intracranial (i.c.) doses of r10 plaque forming
units (PFU, Fig. 3c, ref. 36). In contrast, artLCMV failed to cause
disease at doses up to 104 PFU i.c., and only one of five animals
developed terminal disease when given 105 PFU i.c. Despite its
attenuation, intravenous artLCMV-induced substantial levels of
serum type I interferon (IFN-I, Fig. 3d) for at least 48 h. rLCMV
triggered a comparably minor and short-lived IFN-I release,
whereas neither rAd-based nor replicating vaccinia virus-based
vectors induced detectable levels of systemic IFN-I. Analogous
results were obtained when rAd vectors were given intramuscu-
larly or upon subcutaneous and intradermal administration of
vaccinia virus-based vectors (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Although
we used replication-competent vaccinia virus for our study, the
lack of systemic IFN-I was expected owing to multiple virally
encoded antagonists of the IFN-I response37. Taken together,
these results indicated that artLCMV was genetically stable and
substantially attenuated, both in vitro and in vivo, but retained the
ability to efficiently activate the innate immune system. To assess
artLCMV-induced
CD8 þ
T-cell
responses
to
transgenes
of choice, we generated an ovalbumin- (OVA-) expressing
vector (artLCMV-OVA). It induced OVA epitope-specific CTL
numbers, which were substantially higher than those elicited by
an OVA-recombinant adenovirus 5-based vector (rAd-OVA) or
by a replication-deficient LCMV-based vector (rLCMV-OVA,
Fig. 4a). Most notably, artLCMV-OVA-triggered KLRG1þCD127�
effector CD8 þ T-cell (CTLeff) responses in blood and spleen
exceeded those of the other delivery systems by Btenfold
(Fig. 4b,c), while CD127 þ CTLmem memory precursor cell
numbers were comparable (Fig. 4d). OVA-specific total CTL and
CTLeff responses to artLCMV-OVA immunization were also
significantly higher than those induced upon intramuscular
administration
of
rAd-OVA
and
either
subcutaneous
or
intradermal
vaccination
with
rVACC-OVA
(Supplementary
Fig. 3b,c). Intracellular cytokine staining showed that artLCMV-
OVA elicited ten to 20-fold higher numbers of IFN-g-producing
and IFN-g/TNF co-producing CD8 þ T cells than rAd-OVA or
rLCMV-OVA, and also IFN-g/TNF/IL-2 triple producers were
significantly more numerous (Fig. 4e). These differences in
magnitude and functionality of OVA-specific CTL populations
persisted in the memory phase (Fig. 4f). Superior functionality of
artLCMV-induced CTLeff responses was also evident in primary
ex vivo Cr51 release assays, with Ztenfold more lytic units in
spleen
after
artLCMV
infection
than
after
rLCMV-OVA,
rAd-OVA
or
recombinant
vaccinia
virus
(rVACC-OVA)
immunization (Fig. 4g). Importantly, artLCMV-based vaccines
elicited
also
robust
CD8 þ
T-cell
responses
against
the
tumour self-antigens Her2 and P1A (Fig. 4h,i). Analogously to
artLCMV-OVA immunization, P1A-specific CD8 þ T cells in
blood of artLCMV-P1A-immunized mice were Btenfold more
numerous than in animals receiving rLCMV-P1A (Fig. 4i).
LCMVwt evades antibody neutralization by means of its
envelope glycan shield38, and even two sequential artLCMV
immunizations failed to induce detectable neutralizing serum
activity (Fig. 4j). Accordingly, artLCMV-induced CTL responses

artLCMV-vectorized transgenes.
artLCMV triggers IL-33-driven CTL by targeting stromal cells.
We investigated the mechanisms underlying exceptionally potent
CTLeff responses upon artLCMV immunization. First we studied
its tropism for antigen-presenting cells in vivo as a basis for
potent CTL induction. While both, rLCMV and artLCMV,
efficiently targeted plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), artLCMV infected
a significantly higher number of conventional dendritic cells and
macrophages than its replication-deficient counterpart rLCMV
(Fig. 5a). In addition we hypothesized that artLCMV, analogously
to LCMVwt, triggered the IL-33–ST2 alarmin pathway, thereby
potentiating CTL responses and CTLeff responses in particular11.
When immunized with artLCMV-OVA, wt mice mounted
Btenfold higher OVA-specific CTL responses than animals
lacking the IL-33 receptor ST2 (Il1rl1 � / �), both in spleen and
blood (Fig. 5b,c). These differences were particularly pronounced
in the KLRG1 þCD127 � CTLeff subset (Fig. 5b,c). Conversely,
the responses to rAd-OVA, rVACC-OVA and rLCMV-OVA were
unaffected by ST2 deficiency, suggesting that artLCMV-OVA
immunization but neither replication-deficient rLCMV- nor rAd-
or vaccinia-vectored vaccination triggered the IL-33–ST2 axis.
The capacity to replicate in vivo differentiates artLCMV and
rLCMV and was apparently required to activate this pathway.
Bioactive IL-33 is released from non-haematopoietic stromal
cells11, which are a target of replicating LCMV infection40. To test
the hypothesis that artLCMV triggered ST2 signalling by infecting
IL-33-expressing stromal cells inside secondary lymphoid organs,
we developed and validated a green fluorescent IL-33 reporter
mouse (IL-33gfp/wt, Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). More than half

that

rLCMV and artLCMV infected a sizeable number of splenic BECs
(Fig. 5d). A subset of artLCMV-infected BECs also reported
IL-33, whereas rLCMV-infected BECs were virtually uniformly
IL-33-GFP-negative
(Fig.
5d).
IL-33-reporting
BECs
were
highly overrepresented amongst those infected by artLCMV
(Supplementary Fig. 4d), suggesting that artLCMV infection
either had a predilection for a rare subset of IL-33-expressing
BECs or that it triggered IL-33 expression in infected BECs.
Both artLCMV-infected (tom þ) IL-33-GFP þ BEC and FRC

artLCMV-infected lymphoid tissue stromal cells, offering a
mechanism whereby replicating viral delivery systems supply
IL-33 to the ensuing CTL response inside secondary lymphoid
organs.
IL-33-driven tumour control upon artLCMV immunotherapy.
To compare the efficacy of several viral vector platforms in cancer
immunotherapy, we first exploited a transplantable OVA-
expressing tumour model (EG7-OVA). Unlike rLCMV-OVA and

 failed to prevent tumour progression, indicating that tumour
antigen-specific T-cell induction was essential for clinical efficacy
(Fig. 6a,b). Moreover, artLCMV-OVA-based tumour immu-
notherapy of EG7-OVA tumours was only effective in ST2-suf-
ficient wt animals but failed in Il1rl1 � / � mice (Fig. 6c–f). These
differences correlated with OVA-specific CTLs and CTLeff, which
were 4tenfold higher in the blood of artLCMV-OVA-treated wt
mice than in analogously treated Il1rl1 � / � mice (Supplementary
Fig. 5c), altogether attesting to the critical function of the IL-33–
ST2 axis in artLCMV-based cancer immunotherapy. To assess the
potency of artLCMV-based immunotherapy in a mouse tumour
model without artificially introduced non-self antigens, we
exploited the P815 mastocytoma model. Immunotherapy with
artLCMV
expressing
the
cancer
testis
(self)
antigen
P1A
(artLCMV-P1A) significantly delayed the growth of established
subcutaneous tumours and prolonged the animals’ survival,
whereas
replication-deficient
rLCMV-P1A
and
irrelevant
artLCMV-GFP were ineffective (Fig. 6g,h). Of note, P815
tumours were refractory to anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibition but
responded to artLCMV-P1A (Fig. 6i,j). Anti-PD1 unresponsive-
ness of P815 tumours has been previously documented and may
be due to several mechanisms including insufficient expression of
PD-1 ligands, as reported41. Accordingly, the combination of
artLCMV-P1A and anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade was not
superior
to
artLCMV-P1A
monotherapy
(Supplementary
Fig. 5h).

 represents
an
important
goal
of
cancer
immunotherapy.
artLCMV-OVA immunotherapy yielded higher numbers of
circulating OVA-specific CTLs and CTLeff in blood of EG7-
OVA tumour-bearing mice than did artLCMV-GFP, rAd-OVA
or
rLCMV-OVA
(Fig.
7a).
Flow
cytometry
and
immunohistochemistry documented also that artLCMV-OVA
immunotherapy yielded significantly higher densities of tumour-
infiltrating
CTLs
(TILs),
OVA-specific
TILs
and
tumour-
infiltrating
OVA-specific
CTLeff
(Fig.
7b,c).
Analogously,
artLCMV-P1A immunotherapy augmented P1A-specific CTLs
and CTLeff in blood of tumour-bearing mice and in tumour tissue
(Supplementary Fig. 5d–f). The administration of irrelevant
artLCMV-GFP resulted in only modestly elevated TIL numbers
and was clinically ineffective, corroborating that artLCMV
immunotherapy operated in a largely antigen-specific manner
(Fig. 7b,c). Accordingly, immunohistochemical analysis did not
reveal artLCMV antigen in the tumour, while viral antigen was
clearly detected in spleen (Supplementary Fig. 5g), arguing
against an oncolytic effect of artLCMV. Inflammatory gene
expression profiling of EG7-OVA tumours on day 9 after
artLCMV-OVA immunotherapy identified 30 genes, which
were significantly different from tumours of untreated control
mice. Thereof 20 were IFN-inducible (Fig. 7d). Validation
by
TaqMan
RT-PCR
confirmed
that
artLCMV-OVA
immunotherapy
induced
several
inflammatory
mediators
namely including the chemokines Ccl5, Cxcl9, Ccl4 and Cxcl10,
which are predictive of prolonged survival in human cancers
(Fig. 7e)42–44. Of note, expression of CCL5 was significantly
higher in tumours of artLCMV-OVA-treated animals than in
those receiving rLCMV-OVA or rAd-OVA (Fig. 7e, similar trend
for Cxcl9). Importantly, however, only tumours of artLCMV-
OVA immunized but not of artLCMV-GFP control-treated
animals
exhibited
substantial
chemokine
induction.
This
indicated that OVA-specific CTLeff infiltration was essential for

Figure 7 | artLCMV immunotherapy leads to CTL infiltration and inflammatory conversion of the tumour. (a–e) We implanted EG7-OVA tumour
cells subcutaneously into the flank of C57BL/6 mice. On day 7, when tumours became palpable, we treated them with artLCMV-OVA, artLCMV-GFP,
rLCMV-OVA, rAd-OVA or left them untreated. Peripheral blood (a) and tumour tissue (b–e) were analysed on d8 and d9 after treatment, respectively.
We enumerated OVA-tetramer-binding total CTLs and CTLeff (Klrg1 þ) in blood (a) and tumour (b) as indicated. CTLs were gated as live
CD8 þCD4 �CD3 þB220 � lymphocytes. For normalization to EG7 tumour cells the latter were differentiated from infiltrating inflammatory cells by size

 inflammatory activation of the tumour microenvironment in
artLCMV-OVA immunotherapy whereas the accompanying
non-specific
inflammation,
which
was
also
induced
by
artLCMV-GFP, was insufficient to mediate these effects in full.
Discussion
These results identify virally delivered alarmin signals as key
drivers of protective CTLeff responses in vectored cancer
immunotherapy.
The
function
of
such
damage-associated
molecular patterns appears non-redundant with PAMPs, which
can also be provided by replication-deficient viral delivery
systems45,46. As schematically outlined in Supplementary Fig. 6,
the
ability
of
artLCMV
to
trigger
IL-33/ST2-dependent
CTLeff induction correlated with the vectors’ spread into
IL-33-expressing lymphoid stroma cells. Subsequent death of
these cells, possibly as a consequence of CTL attack47, offers a
likely mechanism for IL-33 release to neighbouring T cells.
Activated CTLs inside secondary lymphoid organs express ST2,
and IL-33 sensing is known to potentiate their expansion, effector
differentiation and survival11. The present observations suggest
that upon emigration to the tumour, these alarmin-imprinted
CTLs
contribute
essentially
to
tumour
microenvironment
changes and to tumour control, thus providing a mechanistic
rationale for the exploitation of replicating delivery platforms in
the fight against cancer. Besides renewed interest in the tumour
immunotherapy
field,
replicating
live
vaccine
approaches
currently experience a revival in indications such as Ebola
hemorrhagic fever48, tuberculosis49 and immunodeficiency virus
infection50. These infectious diseases and cancer have in common
that potency is rate-limiting, outweighing potential concerns
related to the safety profile of replicating vector systems or to the
release of genetically modified organisms into the environment.
Accordingly, the safety profile of genetically engineered live
viruses has become acceptable for oncolytic virus therapy,
with a licensed product already on the market1.
The development of artLCMV represents an innovative
addition to a limited quiver of replicating viral vaccine delivery
systems. Several mechanistic features suggest it holds promise for
tumour immunotherapy. Efficient DC targeting results in potent
CTL priming. In vivo spread and infection of IL-33-expressing
lymphoid
stromal
cells
unleashes
the
IL-33–ST2
alarmin
pathway,
thereby
augmenting
CTL
function
and
effector
differentiation11. Low LCMV seroprevalence in the human
population21,22 predicts high response rates. Inefficient vector-
neutralizing antibody induction38 facilitates repeated vector
re-administration. The intravenous administration of LCMV is
safe in humans and non-human primates18,51.
In recent years, checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1
or anti-CTLA-4 antibodies had groundbreaking success in a
variety of malignancies2. However, immune checkpoint blockade
merely disinhibits ongoing T-cell responses and, by consequence,
tends to fail in tumours with a paucity of pre-existing tumour-
infiltrating CTLs52,53. Such ‘cold’ tumours can be the result of
immunoediting and T-cell escape54. Alternatively, tumours can
exhibit immunogenic determinants but fail to induce clinically
significant CTL responses, which is referred to as immune
exclusion or ignorance14,53. As a powerful tool for active
immunization artLCMV immunotherapy delivered significant
numbers of tumour-reactive CTLeff to the tumour bed, resulting
in an inflammatory conversion of the tumour microenvironment
(Fig. 7, Supplementary Fig. 5). This transition is thus predicted
to render the corresponding tumours more responsive to
immunomodulatory therapy.
Beyond the commonly benign nature of human LCMV
infection and a lack of horizontal transmission in humans,
inefficient co-packaging of the three artLCMV genome segments
represents a molecularly defined mechanism of attenuation. The
41,000-fold increase in i.c. mouse LD50 exceeds the B100-fold
safety margin of the clinically used, live-attenuated Junin
arenavirus vaccine Candid#1 (ref. 55). Last but not least,
genetic stability (Fig. 2a–d) should enable industrial exploitation.
During scale-up in batch production, but also upon administra-
tion to vaccinees, rearranged genomes with a fitness gain are
readily selected32,56, compromising product safety as well as
efficacy29,30.
Accordingly,
stable
transgene
expression
and
attenuation of artLCMV, together with the simplicity and
rapidity of vector generation, represent critical assets for clinical
translation and the vector’s exploitation in personalized medicine
approaches57.
Taken together, our study identifies alarmin signals as crucial
for the induction of protective anti-tumour CTLeff responses in
vectored immunotherapy. By demonstrating mechanistically that
alarmin release depends on viral in vivo spread, our work suggests
that live viruses deserve their place in the rapidly evolving array
of cancer treatment modalities. artLCMV may represent the
prototype of a novel class of live microbial delivery systems,
which leverage not only PAMPs but also alarmin release for
CTLeff differentiation and enhanced anti-tumour efficacy.
Methods
Cells. BHK-21 cells were obtained from ECACC (Clone 13, Cat #85011433),
MC57 cells (CRL-2295), EL-4 cells (TIB-39), EG7 thymoma cells (EL-4 cells
expressing OVA, CRL-2113) and P815 mastocytoma cells (TIB-64) were obtained
from ATCC. Stably transfected BHK-21 cells expressing the LCMV-NP and -GP
proteins, respectively (BHK-NP; BHK-GP), and GP-expressing 293T cells have
previously been described26,58. All cell lines were tested mycoplasma negative.
Viruses and virus neutralization test. The origin, passage and titration of the
LCMV strains Armstrong and Clone 13 strains have been described11. GP-IFF has
previously been described58. For GFP-IFF we used rat-anti-GFP antibody
(Biolegend, 1:2,000 dilution) as primary antibody. Replication-competent LCM
viruses were propagated on BHK-21 cells, rLCMV vectors on 293T-GP cells26.
Growth curves of LCM viruses were performed on BHK-21 cells at a multiplicity of
infection of 0.01. The reverse genetic engineering of rLCMV, r3LCMV and
artLCMV vectors has been described26,27. Entire ORFs of the cancer-testis antigen
P1A (comprising the immunodominant LPYLGWLVF epitope), GFP, dTomato,
OVA (comprising the immunodominant SIINFEKL epitope) and Cre were used for
insertion into the respective vectors and viruses. artLCMV-Her2 contained a
ubiquitin-based expression cassette59 delivering the immunodominant
TYLPANASL miniepitope. Recombinant vaccinia virus and E1-deleted
recombinant adenovirus 5-based vectors expressing ovalbumin (rVACC-OVA,
rAd-OVA) have previously been described60,61. A genetically tagged GPC-encoding
S segment cDNA (pol-I-S-GPCtag) was generated by codon-optimizing the 255
C-terminal nucleotides of the viral GPC ORF, creating a novel ORF named
‘GPCtag’. To create a Srec#1 expression plasmid, we substituted the IGR in
pol-I-S-GPCtag for a synthetic cDNA fragment (Genscript) as described in
Supplementary Fig. 2e. The neutralizing capacity of mAb and immune serum was
analysed in immunofocus reduction assays11.
Animal experimentation and ethics statement. Il33 � / � mice62 were obtained
through the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology (Acc. No. CDB0631K;
http://www.cdb.riken.jp/arg/mutant%20mice%20list.html). AGRAG mice
(IFNa/bR � / �, IFNgR � / �, RAG1 � / � triple-deficient)63, Il1rl1 � / � (ref. 64) and
ZP3-Cre mice65 have been described. IL33 reporter mice (Il33gfp/wt) were generated
by intercrossing IL-33 � / � mice with the ZP3-Cre germ line deleter strain to
remove the neomycin cassette. C57BL/6, BALB/c and DBA/2 wild-type mice were
either purchased from Charles River and Janvier Labs or were bred at the Institut
fu
¨r Labortierkunde of the University of Zurich, Switzerland under specific
pathogen-free conditions. Unless specified otherwise, rAd-OVA vectors and
rVACC-OVA were administered in their respective optimal dose range of 108
viral particles i.v. and 106 PFU i.v., respectively66,67. The same respective doses
were used for intramuscular (rAd-OVA) and intradermal or subcutaneous
(rVACC-OVA) immunizations in the experiments to Supplementary Fig. 2.
artLCMV and r3LCMV were routinely given at a dose of 105 PFU i.v., except for
virus tracing experiments in C57BL/6 mice (106 PFU) and experiments in AGRAG
mice (104 PFU). rLCMV vectors were used at 105 PFU for standard immunization
experiments or at 106 PFU for immunization with tumour self antigens, for tumour
immunotherapy and for Cr51 release experiments. Except for prime-boost
immunization experiments in Fig. 4j,k, animals were given only a single shot of
viral vector or virus, respectively. LCMVwt was administered i.v. at the same dose

 as artLCMV was used. Intracranial LCMV challenge was performed through the
skull and animals developing terminal disease were euthanized by CO2 inhalation
in accordance with the Swiss law. PD-1 blocking antibody (clone RMP1-14, from
BioXcell) was administered at a dose of 12.5 mg kg � 1 intraperitoneally. CD8 þ T
cells were depleted by injecting 200 mg anti-CD8 antibody (YTS169, from BioXcell)
intraperitoneally. Animal experiments were performed at the Universities of
Geneva and Basel in accordance with the Swiss law for animal protection.
Permission was granted by the Direction ge
´ne
´rale de la sante
´, Domaine de
l0expe
´rimentation animale of the Canton of Geneva and by the Veterina
¨ramt
Basel-Stadt, respectively. Experimental groups were sex- and age-matched. Animals
in tumour therapy experiments were assigned to groups in a manner to assure even
distribution of tumour volumes between groups at the time of tumour therapy. The
groups were neither randomized, nor were experiments conducted in a blinded
manner. The Swiss law for animal protection requires that mice with wounds on
the tumour or exhibiting signs of distress (evident namely in lethargy, hunchback,
piloerection, emaciation and agonal breathing) be euthanized by CO2 inhalation
irrespective of tumour size and diameter. Accordingly, animals not reaching
humane endpoints of tumour volume or diameter were excluded from survival
curves.
Virus sequencing and gene expression profiling. Viral RNA was extracted from
cell culture supernatant or serum of infected mice using the QIAamp Viral RNA
Mini Kit (QIAGEN, cat. no. 52906). Reverse-transcription was performed with
ThermoScript RT-PCR System (Invitrogen) and an LCMV-NP-specific primer
(50-GGCTCCCAGATCTGAAAACTGTT-30). PCR amplification used the same
primer together with a GPC-specific primer (50-GCTGGCTTGTCACTAATGG
CTC-30). Amplified products were purified for Sanger sequencing (Microsynth).
Whole-cell RNA was extracted from tumour tissue using QIAzol (QIAGEN).
nCounter Nanostring Mouse Inflammation v2 assay and Applied Biosystems
TaqMan RT-PCR assays were used for quantification of gene expression. TaqMan
results were normalized to GAPDH.
Flow cytometry. Antibodies against CD4 (RM4-5 or GK1.5), CD8 (53-6.7),
CD45R/B220 (RA3-6B2), CD45.2 (104), Ter-119 (TER-119), CD31 (390), gp38
(Podoplanin; 8.1.1), CD3 (17A2), Klrg1 (2F1), CD127 (A7R34), CD11c (N418),
CD11b (M1/70), CD19 (6D5), NK1.1 (PK136), CD90.2 (30-H12), GR-1
(RB6-8C5), IFN-g (XMG1.2), TNF (MP6-XT22) and IL-2 (JES6-5H4) were from
Biolegend, Pharmingen and eBioscience. All fluorescently labelled monoclonal
antibodies were used at a 1:100 dilution, except for gp38 (Podoplanin) and Ter-119,
which were diluted 1:1,000, and 1:10, respectively. Dead cells were excluded with
Zombie UV Fixable Viability Kit (Biolegend, cat. no. 423108). OVA- (SIINFEKL)
and P1A epitope- (LPYLGWLVF) specific CTLs were identified as peptide-MHC
class I tetramers (TCMetrix) binding cells amongst CD8 þB220 � lymphocytes. BD
Trucount Absolute Counting Tubes were used to determine absolute cell counts in
blood. Spleen lymphocyte counts were determined in a Neubauer chamber.
Peptide-MHC tetramer-binding CTLs were back calculated. Cytokine profiles
after restimulation with peptide (SIINFEKL for OVA, TYLPANASL for Her2;
ProImmune) were determined in intracellular cytokine assays11. Samples were
measured on BD LSRFortessa and Beckman Coulter Gallios flow cytometers and
were analysed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).
Isolation of cells. Splenic single-cell suspensions were prepared by mechanical
disruption. The isolation of stromal cells from spleen has been described68.
Briefly, spleens were flushed with RPMI containing 3 mg ml � 1 Collagenase IV
(Worthington), 40 mg ml � 1 DNAseI (Roche) and 2% (vol/vol) FCS), were cut
into pieces and digested. Erythrocytes were lysed in 0.15 M NH4Cl/10 mM
KHCO3/0.1 mM EDTA and haematopoietic CD45 þ cells were depleted using
anti-CD45 beads (Miltenyi Biotec). For TIL analysis, tumours were cut and
digested with accutase (PAA), Collagenase IV (Worthington), Hyaluronidase
(Sigma) and DNAseI (Roche) and red blood cells were lysed. Mononuclear cells
were isolated using a Histopaque-1119 gradient.
Tumour transplantation and measurements. Suspensions containing 106
tumour cells were implanted subcutaneously in the right flank. Tumour growth
was monitored three times per week and the longest (‘length’) and the shortest
diameter (‘width’) were measured using a caliper. Tumour volumes (mm3) were
calculated as 1/2 (length*width^2). In accordance with the Swiss law for animal
protection, mice were euthanized when tumour volumes exceeded 1,500 mm3 or
when the longest median tumour diameter exceeded 20 mm.
Immunohistochemistry. For immunohistochemical bright-field staining, tissues
were prepared in HOPE fixative (DCS Innovative) and paraffin embedded.
Upon inactivation of endogenous peroxidases, tissue sections were incubated
with rat-anti-mouse CD8a (YTS169.4, diluted 1:2,000) or rat-anti-LCMV NP
(VL-4, hybridoma supernatant was diluted 1:10). Bound primary antibodies
were visualized with biotin-labelled anti-rat antibody (diluted 1:100) and strepta-
vidin-peroxidase staining method using polymerized 3,30-diaminobenzidine (all
reagents from Dako; haemalaun counterstaining of nuclei).
For detection of GFP in virus-infected organs, cryosections (10 mm)
were prepared from PFA-fixed tissues and nuclei were stained with
40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Invitrogen).
Immunostained bright-field sections and fluorescence sections of virus-infected
tissues were scanned using a Panoramic Digital Slide Scanner 250 FLASH II
(3DHISTECH). White balance was adjusted and contrast was linearly enhanced
using the tools ‘levels’, ‘curves’, ‘brightness’ and ‘contrast’ in Photoshop CS6
(Adobe).
For GFP detection in naı
¨ve IL-33gfp/gfp and IL-33gfp/wt, cryosections (8–10 mm)
were prepared from PFA-fixed spleens. For detection of nuclear IL-33, rat
anti-gp38 (anti-podoplanin, 8F11, MBL, diluted 1:900), rabbit anti-GFP (A11122,
Invitrogen, diluted 1:400) and goat anti-IL33 (AF3626, R&D Systems, diluted
1:200) were used as primary antibodies. As secondary antibodies donkey-anti-rat
IgG HRP (horse radish peroxidase, diluted 1:500), donkey-anti-rabbit Alexa488
(diluted 1:500) and donkey-anti-goat Alexa647 (diluted 1:300) were used (Jackson
Immunoresearch). HRP was visualized using a Tyramide Cy3 (Invitrogen)
reaction. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Immunostainings were visualized using
an AxioImager Z.1 microscope (Zeiss), followed by image processing in Adobe
Photoshop.
Primary ex vivo cytotoxicity assays. Primary ex vivo cytotoxicity of splenocytes
was determined in a 5-h assay on Cr51-loaded EL-4 target cells pulsed with
SIINFEKL peptide according to established procedures69. Cytotoxicity on
unlabelled target cells was subtracted to obtain specific lysis. Lytic units were
determined according to established procedures from dose–response curves69;
one lytic unit was calculated to represent the minimal number of spleen cells that
lysed 410% of the target cells.
IFN-a ELISA. Serum interferon-alpha levels were determined by ELISA
using the Verikine Mouse Interferon Alpha ELISA Kit (PBL Assay Science, cat.
no. KMC4011).
Statistical analysis. For statistical analysis, GraphPad Prism software (Version
6.0, GraphPad Software) was used. Differences between two groups were assessed
using unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-tests. Single values of multiple groups were
compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni
post hoc test or Dunnett’s post hoc test when comparing against a reference group.
A Bonferroni correction was made when comparing multiple parameters. Two-way
ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test was used to compare multiple groups with
multiple measurements. Survival curves were analysed by log-rank tests with
Bonferroni correction. For the comparison of tumour growth curves, the area
under the curve was compared70. The analysis ended when the first animals
reached human endpoints.
Viral load data were log-converted to obtain a near-normal distribution prior to
statistical analysis. Variances within different groups in a given experiment were
similar. In accordance with current standard practice in the field of viral
immunology, only very substantial differences were reported, obviating the need
for variance testing.
P values of Po0.05 were considered significant (*), Po0.01 (**) and Po0.001
(***) as highly significant.
