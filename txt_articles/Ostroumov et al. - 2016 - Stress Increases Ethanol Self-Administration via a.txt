SUMMARY
Stress is a well-known risk factor for subsequent alcohol abuse, but the neural mechanisms 
underlying interactions between stress and alcohol remain largely unknown. Addictive drug 
reinforcement and stress signaling involve common neural circuitry, including the mesolimbic 
dopamine system. We demonstrate in rodents that pre-exposure to stress attenuates alcohol-
induced dopamine responses and increases alcohol self-administration. The blunted dopamine 
signaling resulted from ethanol-induced excitation of GABA neurons in the ventral tegmental area. 
Excitation of GABA neurons was mediated by GABAA receptor activation and involved stress-
induced functional down-regulation of the K+, Cl− cotransporter, KCC2. Blocking stress hormone 
receptors, enhancing KCC2 function, or preventing excitatory GABA signaling by alternative 
methods all prevented the attenuated alcohol-induced dopamine response and prevented the 
increased alcohol self-administration. These results demonstrate that stress alters the neural and 
behavioral responses to alcohol through a neuroendocrine signal that shifts inhibitory GABA 
transmission towards excitation.

 exposure to stressful life events represents a significant risk factor (Keyes et al., 2012). 
Stress increases alcohol consumption in alcohol dependent and non-dependent populations 
(Ayer et al., 2011; Tamers et al., 2014; Thomas et al., 2011), and stress is thought to underlie 
a transition to pathological drug use (Koob and Le Moal, 2005). Animal studies have 
revealed interactions between stress and ethanol self-administration under certain stressor 
and drinking paradigms, but some results have been equivocal (Becker et al., 2011; Noori et 
al., 2014; Spanagel et al., 2014). These discrepancies indicate that the basic neuronal 
mechanisms linking stress and alcohol use are not well understood.
Stress-induced changes in alcohol use likely arise from an interaction between the stress and 
reward systems of the brain (Spanagel et al., 2014; Uhart and Wand, 2009). At the cellular 
level, both stress hormones and ethanol influence the DA system by direct actions on DA 
neurons or indirectly via changes in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs (Niehaus et al., 
2010; Saal et al., 2003). Stress hormone signaling also may alter midbrain GABAA receptor 
signaling, but the molecular mechanism underlying this adaptation has not been identified 
(Doyon et al., 2013) and may arise from changes in GABA synthesis, in release, or in 
expression of specific GABAA receptor subunits (Maguire, 2014). Alternatively, acute stress 
exposure has been shown to induce a paradoxical shift towards excitatory GABAA receptor 
signaling within the HPA axis by altering the intracellular anion homeostasis (Hewitt et al., 
2009; Sarkar et al., 2011). Given that the GABAA receptor is a target of ethanol, we 
postulated that alterations in GABAA receptor transmission could contribute to an 
interaction between stress and ethanol self-administration.
To examine the interaction between stress and ethanol, we exposed drug-naïve rats to stress 
and then measured their subsequent ethanol intake. Concomitant with increases in ethanol 
self-administration, we show that acute stress attenuates ethanol-induced DA neuron firing 
in the VTA and DA release at target regions. These stress hormone-dependent effects were 
mediated by an increase in VTA GABAergic inhibition onto DA neurons in response to 
ethanol. Stress induced the functional down-regulation of KCC2, shifting GABAA receptor 
signaling towards excitation of some downstream GABA neurons. Pharmacological 
activation of KCC2 restored the GABAergic circuitry and DA neuron signaling and 
prevented the escalation in ethanol self-administration induced by stress. These results 
indicate that a shift toward excitatory GABA signaling within the mesolimbic system is 
associated with increased drinking after exposure to stress.
RESULTS
Stress increases ethanol self-administration via activation of glucocorticoid receptors
We first examined how a single episode of restraint stress alters subsequent ethanol intake 
measured during daily operant self-administration sessions (Figure 1A). Stable lever 
pressing for saccharin (0.125%, w/v) was first established followed by the introduction of 
ethanol (2–4%) into the drinking solution (Doyon et al., 2013). Animals were subjected to 
restraint stress (1 hr) approximately 15 hrs prior to the first ethanol self-administration 
session. The 15-hr separation between the stress and ethanol self-administration was chosen 
to examine the lasting impact on neural circuits, not the immediate proximal influence of the 
stressor itself (Noori et al., 2014).

 Pre-exposure to stress caused a significant and long-lasting increase in ethanol self-
administration compared to the non-stressed control group (Figure 1A): group: F(1,21) = 
19.32, p < 0.01. Blood-ethanol levels were measured in a subset of animals and were 
correlated with ethanol intake (Figure 1B). Stressed rats showed significantly higher blood-
ethanol levels (120.8 ± 13.6 mg/dl, n = 5) than non-stressed rats (61.3 ± 4.3 mg/dl, n = 10, p 
< 0.01). Mean intake of ethanol over the first 7 days was 0.74 ± 0.03 g/kg for the control 
group (n = 19) and 0.95 ± 0.03 g/kg for the stressed group (n = 16, p < 0.01) (Figure 1C, 
black and red bars). Elevated drinking after stress was also observed at higher ethanol 
concentrations (7–10%) over a 3-week period (Figure S1A, B). Therefore, acute restraint 
stress induced robust changes in the acquisition and maintenance of ethanol-drinking 
behavior.
Restraint stress is known to increase circulating glucocorticoid levels (Pitman et al., 1988). 
To determine whether the effect of stress on drinking was mediated by stress hormone 
signaling, a separate group of rats was pretreated with RU486 (a glucocorticoid receptor 
antagonist) prior to stress. Pretreatment with systemic RU486 prevented the stress from 
increasing subsequent ethanol self-administration (Figure 1C, dark blue bar; 0.67 ± 0.07 g/
kg). To determine whether stress hormone signaling acted locally within the DA system 
(Spanagel et al., 2014; Uhart and Wand, 2009), we microinfused RU486 bilaterally into the 
VTA prior to stress exposure. Intra-VTA administration of RU486 (Figure S1C) prevented 
the stress from increasing subsequent ethanol self-administration (Figure 1C, light blue bar; 
0.55 ± 0.05 g/kg), revealing that the effect of stress requires glucocorticoid receptor 
activation within the VTA. In non-stressed control rats, RU486 did not significantly 
influence ethanol intake when administered systemically or by local microinfusion (Figure 
1C, gray bar on the right; 0.67 ± 0.04 g/kg), demonstrating a selective effect of RU486 on 
stress-induced drinking. Additional control experiments with saccharin and palatable food 
suggest that the effect of stress we observe was specific to ethanol self-administration (see 
Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
Stress attenuates ethanol-induced DA activity in vivo via glucocorticoid receptor signaling
Because ethanol self-administration involves DA signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) 
(Gonzales et al., 2004), we hypothesized that stress might also alter ethanol-induced DA 
release in the NAc. To test this hypothesis, rats were subjected to 1-hr restraint stress 15 hrs 
prior to ethanol exposure, and microdialysis samples were collected to measure changes in 
the extracellular DA concentration in response to ethanol administration (Figure 2A). We 
observed a sustained increase in DA levels in the control group (Figure 2B, black trace), but 
stressed animals showed a blunted DA response to ethanol (Figure 2B, red trace): group × 
time: F(10,160) = 2.79, p < 0.01. No significant differences in baseline DA levels were 
detected between control and stress groups: 2.0 ± 0.2 nM in control vs. 2.1 ± 0.2 nM after 
stress.
Next, we tested whether glucocorticoid receptor activation mediated the stress- induced 
decrease in ethanol-evoked DA release. Systemic pretreatment with RU486 prevented the 
inhibitory effect of stress on ethanol-induced DA release (Figure 2B, grey data). The 
distribution of the microdialysis probe placements within the NAc is shown in Figure S2.

 Ethanol stimulates DA release in the NAc by increasing the firing rate of VTA DA neurons 
(Foddai et al., 2004). To determine whether restrained stress altered DA neuron firing rate in 
vivo, we conducted single unit recordings of VTA DA neurons in anesthetized rats 15 hrs 
after stress (Figure 2C). DA neurons were recorded in the lateral VTA (Figure 2D) and were 
identified based on their electrophysiological and pharmacological properties (Figure S3A, 
B).
The spontaneous firing rate of VTA DA neurons was measured before and after intravenous 
infusion of ethanol (0.6–1.5 g/kg). Ethanol administration induced an increase in the 
spontaneous firing rate of VTA DA neurons in control animals (128.6 ± 7.6%). In contrast, 
stressed animals failed to demonstrate a significant firing-rate increase upon ethanol 
administration (102.3 ± 3.1%) (Figures 2E and F; n = 8–13, p < 0.01). Together with the 
microdialysis experiments, these data indicate that ethanol-induced DA signaling was 
blunted after exposure to stress.
Stress attenuates ethanol-induced DA firing ex vivo
To examine the cellular mechanisms of the blunted DA signaling after stress, we measured 
the ex vivo responses of VTA DA neurons to ethanol (Figure 3A). Midbrain horizontal slices 
containing the VTA were cut 15 hrs after restraint stress, and patch clamp cell-attached 
recordings were performed on DA neurons. Putative DA neurons were recorded from the 
lateral VTA and were identified based on established electrophysiological criteria (Figure 
S3C–E). In 34 of 36 cells displaying these electrophysiological properties, the DA 
phenotype was confirmed by tyrosine hydroxylase staining (Figure 3B)
Bath application of 50-mM ethanol increased the spontaneous firing rate of DA neurons 
from unstressed control rats (Figure 3C and D, black data), but DA cells from stressed 
animals failed to show significant increases in firing rate upon ethanol application (Figure 
3C and D, red data): group × time: F(10,200) = 3.55, p < 0.01.
Stress attenuates ethanol-induced DA neuron firing rates via enhanced GABA release ex 
vivo
Reduced DA activity after stress could be mediated through decreased excitation or 
increased inhibition of DA neurons. To probe the relative contribution of excitatory 
neurotransmission, we recorded ethanol-induced DA activity during inhibition of ionotropic 
glutamate receptors with DNQX (20 µM) and AP5 (50 µM), which inhibit AMPA and 
NMDA receptors respectively. When comparing control and stressed groups, the basal firing 
rate of DA neurons was not significantly altered by bath application of DNQX and AP5. 
Upon ethanol application, DA neurons from stressed animals again showed reduced DA 
activity compared to controls (Figure 3E): group × time: F(10,130) = 6, p < 0.01, indicating 
that this effect of stress was not mediated via changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission.
Next, we tested the contribution of GABAergic signaling by comparing ethanol-induced 
VTA DA neuron firing between control and stress groups in the presence of picrotoxin, a 
GABAA receptor antagonist. Picrotoxin (50 µM) did not significantly alter the basal firing 
rate between the control and stress groups. However, upon application of ethanol, the 
presence of picrotoxin prevented the blunted DA responses to ethanol observed after stress

 (Figure 3F, red trace). This finding suggests that stress reduced DA responses to ethanol via 
changes in GABAergic neurotransmission.
Altered inhibitory control of DA neurons after stress could be mediated through changes in 
presynaptic neurotransmitter release or postsynaptic receptor responses. To determine the 
site of adaptation for GABAergic neurotransmission, whole-cell patch clamp recordings of 
VTA DA neurons were performed and spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC) 
were measured in the presence of ethanol (Figure 3G). In control animals, bath-applied 
ethanol produced a small increase in sIPSC frequency (116.1 ± 5.0%). In contrast, DA 
neurons from stressed animals showed significantly greater ethanol-induced potentiation of 
sIPSC frequency compared to the control response (171.5 ± 7.2%) (Figures 3H and I, black 
and red data; n = 8–10, p < 0.01). Systemic injection of RU486 prior to stress prevented the 
stress-mediated increase in sIPSC frequency observed after ethanol application (Figure 3I, 
grey bar): 110.6 ± 4.5%, n = 8.
To demonstrate the direct action of glucocorticoids in mediating the effects of stress, brain 
slices from control rats were incubated in corticosterone (1 µM) for 1 hr (Pitman et al., 
1988). DA neurons from control animals treated with corticosterone showed a potentiation 
of ethanol-induced sIPSC frequency that was indistinguishable from stressed animals 
(Figure 3I, dark blue bar): 182.7 ± 10.7%, n = 8. Importantly, incubation with RU486 
prevented this corticosterone-mediated increase in sIPSC frequency (Figure 3I, light blue 
bar): 114.5 ± 5.5%, n = 6. Increased frequency, but not amplitude, of sIPSCs suggests that 
the change caused by stress and corticosterone resides with the presynaptic neuron (i.e., the 
GABA neuron) not with the postsynaptic neuron (i.e., the DA neuron) (see Fig. 3G).
Stress increases ethanol-induced VTA GABA neuron firing rate ex vivo and in vivo
Patch-clamp recordings indicated that stress induced long-term alterations in GABAergic 
inputs onto VTA DA neurons. Local VTA GABA neurons can modulate VTA DA neuron 
activity (Creed et al., 2014). To examine whether stress altered the effects of ethanol on local 
VTA GABA neurons, we performed electrophysiological recordings of these cells ex vivo 
(Figure 4A). Putative VTA GABA neurons in slices were recorded in the lateral VTA and 
identified by a combination of factors including small somata size (< 20 µm), high 
pacemaker-like firing rate (> 7 Hz), and the lack of Ih-current (Figure 4B) (Korotkova et al., 
2006; Margolis et al., 2006). Importantly, 47 of 49 VTA neurons with these properties were 
not immunoreactive for TH (Figure 4C). We measured ethanol’s effect on VTA GABA 
neuron spontaneous firing rate in a cell-attached configuration. Bath-application of ethanol 
on VTA slices from control animals produced a marginal increase of GABA neuron firing 
rate (Figure 4D, black trace). A significantly higher ethanol-induced increase in GABA 
neuron firing rate was observed following stress, compared to non-stressed controls (Figure 
4D, red trace): group × time: F(10,160) = 5.89, p < 0.01.
Qualitatively similar effects of stress on ethanol-induced GABA neuron firing were observed 
during in vivo single unit electrophysiological recordings in anesthetized rats. Putative 
GABA neurons in the lateral VTA (Figure S4A) were identified based on their 
electrophysiological and pharmacological properties (Figure S4B, C). Whereas i.v. 
administration of ethanol (0.6–1.5 g/kg) slightly decreased the firing rate of VTA GABA

 neurons in control animals (88.7 ± 5.2%, n = 6), the same doses of ethanol significantly 
increased spontaneous activity after stress (124.5 ± 8.1%, n = 6, p < 0.01) (Figure S4D–F.
As was previously examined in VTA DA neurons (Figures 3E and F), we probed for changes 
in excitatory and inhibitory input onto VTA GABA neurons ex vivo. After application of 
ethanol, inhibition of ionotropic glutamate receptors with DNQX and AP5 did not prevent 
the enhanced GABA cell firing rate observed after stress, indicating that this effect was not 
mediated via changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission (Figure 4E): group × time: 
F(10,110) = 11.19, p < 0.01. However, blocking GABAA receptors with picrotoxin 
prevented the enhanced firing rate of VTA GABA neurons observed after stress (Figure 4F, 
red trace). This result suggests that, in stressed animals, ethanol increased VTA GABA 
neuron firing rate via GABAA receptors.
Stress promotes excitatory GABA input onto VTA GABA neurons ex vivo
Based on our findings in Figure 4F, we hypothesized that GABA inputs onto VTA GABA 
neurons produced excitatory responses. To test this, we measured VTA GABA neuron firing 
rates in response to repetitive stimulation of synaptic GABAA receptor inputs with 
ionotropic glutamate receptors inhibited (Figure 5A). Upon electrical stimulation (20 Hz for 
1 s), GABA neurons from control animals showed decreased firing (Figures 5B and C, black 
data), indicative of GABAergic inhibition of the recorded GABA neuron. In marked 
contrast, slices from stressed animals showed increased GABA neuron firing after GABAA 
receptor stimulation (Figures 5B and C, red data): group × time: F(29,464) = 10.03, p < 
0.01. This finding directly demonstrates excitation mediated by high frequency stimulation 
of GABAA receptors. Importantly, this effect was blocked by picrotoxin (Figures 5D upper 
and E, Stress + picrotoxin), providing further confirmation that the observed excitation of 
VTA GABA neurons following stress was mediated by GABAA receptors. In control 
animals, similar GABAA receptor mediated excitation was also observed following 1 hr 
incubation of brain slices in corticosterone (Figure 5E, blue bar, Cort), suggesting that 
prolonged exposure to corticosteroids is sufficient to promote excitatory GABAA 
transmission onto VTA GABA neurons.
Next, we tested whether the stress-induced transition in GABAA receptor signaling was also 
observed in VTA DA neurons. Upon electrical stimulation of GABAA receptor input (20 Hz, 
1 s), DA neurons from control and stressed animals showed decreased firing (Figure S5A 
and B), indicating that the direct GABA input onto DA neurons remains inhibitory.
It has been reported (Staley et al., 1995) that GABAA receptor-mediated excitation can be 
prevented by application of acetazolamide, an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase. Based on 
these findings, we postulated that acetazolamide would prevent the transition from GABAA 
receptor-mediated inhibition to excitation of GABA neurons observed after stress. Bath 
application of acetazolamide (10 µM) did not change basal GABA neuron firing rate 
between control and stress groups, nor did it change control responses to repetitive 
stimulation. However, repetitive stimulation in the presence of acetazolamide blocked the 
increase in GABA neuron firing after stress (Figures 5D bottom and E, Stress + ACTZ).

 Acetazolamide prevents stress and ethanol interactions ex vivo and in vivo
Given that stress promoted excitatory GABA input onto VTA GABA neurons, we tested 
whether this phenomenon mediated the stress-induced alterations in alcohol’s actions. Based 
on the results of our repetitive stimulation studies (Figures 5D and E), we bath-applied 
acetazolamide to prevent the changes in GABA and DA neuron firing to ethanol observed 
after stress. We found that upon application of ethanol, there was no longer a difference in 
GABA and DA neuron firing rates between control and stressed groups (Figure 6A and B, 
black and red traces compared to the dotted red lines representing stress without 
acetazolamide).
To prevent stress from changing ethanol-induced DA release in the NAc, we infused 
acetazolamide into the VTA prior to the microdialysis experiments (Figure 6C). In contrast 
to the intra-VTA infusion of vehicle, acetazolamide prevented the inhibitory effect of stress 
on ethanol-induced [DA] (Figure 6D): group × time: F(10,120) = 2.96, p < 0.01. The effect 
of acetazolamide was indistinguishable from the non-stressed control group (Figure 6D, 
black dotted trace). Microinfusion of acetazolamide outside the VTA did not reverse the 
inhibitory effect of stress exposure (Figure S6A). In unstressed control animals, the 
microinfusion of acetazolamide in the VTA did not alter the DA response to ethanol (data 
not shown, n = 6, p > 0.05).
To prevent stress from escalating ethanol intake, we bilaterally infused acetazolamide into 
the VTA prior to each ethanol self-administration session (Figure 6E). Intra-VTA infusion of 
acetazolamide significantly decreased the average daily ethanol intake in the stressed group 
(0.67 ± 0.06 g/kg) compared to the stressed group that received intra-VTA infusions of 
vehicle (0.92 ± 0.08 g/kg) (Figure 6F; n = 10–14, p < 0.05). These data were 
indistinguishable from the non-stressed control group (Figure 6F, dotted horizontal line). 
VTA infusions of acetazolamide did not alter ethanol consumption in control animals 
(Figure S6B). All microinfusion sites of acetazolamide in the VTA are shown in Figure S6C 
and D.
Stress alters anion homeostasis in VTA GABA neurons ex vivo
We next investigated the causes underlying the increased GABA cell excitation by alcohol. 
The transition in GABAA receptor signaling (Figure 5B) suggests a depolarizing shift in the 
GABAA reversal potential (EGABA) in VTA GABA neurons (Hewitt et al., 2009). EGABA is 
the membrane potential at which evoked IPSCs change their direction from inward to 
outward. To determine EGABA in VTA GABA neurons, gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp 
recordings were performed to preserve the intracellular anion concentrations, and GABAA 
IPSCs were measured at different membrane potentials (Figure 7A). VTA GABA neurons 
from stressed animals showed a significantly more depolarized EGABA value compared to 
controls (Figure 7B and C): −63.4 ± 3.1 mV after stress (red data) vs. −88.2 ± 3.3 mV in 
controls (black data), n = 10, p < 0.01.
A depolarizing shift in EGABA reflects a higher intracellular chloride concentration, which in 
adult neurons is often mediated by a decrease in Cl− extrusion capacity. During prolonged 
GABAA receptor stimulation, decreased Cl− extrusion capacity leads to intracellular Cl−

 accumulation, culminating in the collapse of the Cl− gradient and decreased synaptic 
GABAA receptor inhibition. To test whether exposure to stress weakens Cl− extrusion in 
VTA GABA neurons, we applied repetitive GABAA receptor stimulation and measured 
activity-dependent depression of the IPSCs (Hewitt et al., 2009). The rate of decrease in 
IPSC amplitude at the conditions that favor Cl− influx (0 mV) depends on Cl− accumulation 
and activity-dependent synaptic depression. In contrast, GABAA receptor stimulation at the 
conditions of Cl- efflux (-90 mV) only depends on activity-dependent synaptic depression. 
Upon electrical stimulation at 20 Hz at a holding potential of −90 mV, stress did not affect 
the rate of synaptic depression in VTA GABA neurons (Figure S7A and B). In contrast, the 
decrease of IPSC amplitude at 0 mV occurred significantly faster after stress (Figure 7D and 
E): F = 39.9, p < 0.01. The differential effect of stress at −90 mV vs. 0 mV indicates that 
stress increased Cl− accumulation, suggesting a reduced capacity for Cl− extrusion in VTA 
GABA neurons.
Stress and glucocorticoids induce dephosphorylation of KCC2 at serine 940
Stress-induced reductions in Cl− extrusion capacity have been associated with 
dephosphorylation of the K+, Cl− cotransporter, KCC2, at serine 940 (S940) (Kahle et al., 
2013; Sarkar et al., 2011). To examine stress-induced alterations in KCC2 protein expression 
and its phosphorylation in the VTA, we performed western blot analysis using an antibody 
against total KCC2 protein, as well as a phospho-specific antibody against the KCC2 
phosphorylation site S940 (Sarkar et al., 2011). Immunoblots revealed two prominent bands 
(~140 and ~270 kDa) for both total and S940 KCC2 antibodies, indicating the presence of 
monomeric and dimeric structures of KCC2 protein (Figure 7F) (Hewitt et al., 2009). No 
significant differences in the expression of total KCC2 protein between control and stressed 
groups were observed (Figure S7C, red data). In contrast, the ratio of phosphorylated-S940 
KCC2 to total KCC2 protein after stress was significantly lower compared to control (Figure 
7F, G): 78.3 ± 5.5% for monomer, 79.6 ± 4.7% for dimer. Importantly, as also reported 
previously (Taylor et al., 2015), immunolabeling analysis in the VTA suggested that KCC2 
protein was expressed exclusively on non-DA neurons (data not shown), which is consistent 
with the presence of another chloride extrusion mechanism in DA neurons (Gulacsi et al., 
2003).
To determine whether glucocorticoids mediate the effect of stress on KCC2, VTA slices 
from control animals were incubated for 1 hr in corticosterone. Similar to in vivo exposure 
to stress, this treatment did not alter levels of total KCC2 protein in the VTA (Figure S7C, 
blue data). However, the ratio of phosphorylated-S940 KCC2 to total KCC2 protein was 
significantly lower after corticosterone incubation (Figure 7H): 75.5 ± 7.6% for monomer, 
78.6 ± 9.4% for dimer. Taken together, these results suggest that stress or corticosterone 
leads to dephosphorylation of KCC2 protein at S940, which decreases KCC2 function and 
alters anion homeostasis.
Enhanced Cl− extrusion restores anion homeostasis in VTA GABA neurons
Based on our findings in Figure 7, we hypothesized that enhancement of Cl− extrusion 
would restore normal GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition in VTA GABA neurons from 
stressed animals. To enhance Cl− extrusion specifically, we used recently developed

 activators of KCC2, CLP257 and CLP290 (Gagnon et al., 2013). First, we confirmed that 
CLP257 and CLP290 were effective in VTA GABA neurons by measuring activity-
dependent depression of IPSCs (as in Figures 7D, E and S7B). After incubation of VTA 
slices with CLP257 (>1hr, 5 µM) or CLP290 (>1 hr, 10 µM) the rates of decrease in IPSC 
amplitude at 0 and −90 mV were similar between control and stressed groups (Figures S8A–
D). Given that CLP257 was shown to be rapidly metabolized in vivo, we further tested 
CLP290, which was demonstrated to have longer bio-availability (Gagnon et al., 2013).
Next, we studied the effect of CLP290 on the stress-induced depolarizing shift in EGABA and 
conditional GABAA receptor-mediated excitation of GABA neurons observed after stress (as 
in Figures 7C and 5E, respectively). We found that correcting the Cl− gradient with CLP290 
in slices from stressed animals returned the EGABA back to the control value (Figure 8A) and 
blocked the stimulation-induced increase in GABA neuron firing (Figure S8E).
Enhanced Cl− extrusion prevents stress and ethanol interactions ex vivo and in vivo
Given that stress altered anion homeostasis in VTA GABA neurons, we next determined 
whether this phenomenon mediated stress-induced alterations in alcohol’s actions. In slices 
from stressed animals, boosting Cl− extrusion with the KCC2 activator, CLP290, returned 
the alcohol-induced firing rate of DA neurons to the control value (Figure 8B).
Next, we locally microinfused CLP290 bilaterally into the VTA prior to the first ethanol 
self-administration session and measured ethanol intake over 7 days (Figure 8C). Intra-VTA 
infusion of CLP290 (Figure S8F) significantly decreased the average daily ethanol intake in 
the stressed group back to control levels (0.79 ± 0.05 g/kg) compared to the stressed group 
that received intra-VTA infusions of vehicle (1.00 ± 0.08 g/kg) (Figure 8C; n = 12–13, p < 
0.05). These data were indistinguishable from the non-stressed control group (Figure 8C, 
dotted horizontal line). VTA infusions of CLP290 did not alter ethanol consumption in 
control animals (0.84 ± 0.05 g/kg, data not shown).
DISCUSSION
While epidemiological studies consistently report associations between stress and ethanol 
consumption (Keyes et al., 2012), the underlying neuronal effects have not been well 
delineated. We found that alterations in GABAA receptor responses on GABAergic neurons 
of the VTA correlate with an increase in ethanol self-administration induced by temporally-
distant, acute stress. After stress, we detected enhanced VTA GABAergic inhibition of DA 
neurons and reduced mesolimbic DA release in response to ethanol. Blunted DA signaling 
was mediated by a transition towards excitatory GABAA receptor signaling and was 
associated with decreased Cl− extrusion capacity in VTA GABA neurons. Stress-induced 
adaptations were prevented by acetazolamide (Staley et al., 1995) or by CLP290 (Gagnon et 
al., 2013). The effect of stress on GABA transmission was recapitulated in vitro by 
corticosterone exposure and was prevented by pharmacological blockade of glucocorticoid 
receptors (Cadepond et al., 1997). Most importantly, when acetazolamide, CLP290, or 
RU486 were locally infused in the VTA in vivo, stress no longer increased ethanol self-
administration.

 The decreased DA response to ethanol was correlated to the stress event and to the excitatory 
GABA signaling. Although the DA response was not directly examined as a cause of the 
increased self-administration, others have reported that enhancing DA signaling exogenously 
attenuates voluntary drinking in rats (Bass et al., 2013). Furthermore, the correlation 
between decreased ethanol-induced DA release and increased self-administration has been 
previously reported in rodent studies (Brodie and Appel, 2000; Doyon et al., 2013; 
Ramachandra et al., 2007).
The shift towards excitatory GABAA receptor signaling was correlated to the stress event 
and was required for the stress to cause increased ethanol self-administration (Figures 6 and 
8). Although GABAA signaling normally mediates inhibitory synaptic transmission in the 
adult mammalian nervous system, it can shift towards excitation under certain pathological 
conditions, including epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and neuronal trauma (De Koninck, 2007). 
The shift arises from the decreased function of the chloride extrusion pump, KCC2 (Kaila et 
al., 2014). Upon strong GABAA receptor stimulation, diminished function of KCC2 led to 
the accumulation of chloride ions inside the cell and subsequent loss of the chloride 
gradient. Activity-dependent loss of the hyperpolarizing chloride gradient unmasks an 
outward flux of bicarbonate ions through GABAA receptors, resulting in neuronal 
depolarization/excitation (Staley et al., 1995). Consistent with this model, we found that the 
GABAergic circuitry responds as expected in the basal condition, but when GABAA 
receptors are highly engaged by strong stimulation (Figure 5) or by ethanol (Figures 2, 3, 4), 
a compromised extrusion capacity leads to a collapse in the Cl− gradient and excitation of 
GABAergic neurons within the VTA (Figures 5 and 7). This shift towards excitatory GABA 
may occur elsewhere in the brain after stress, but the increased ethanol self-administration 
was prevented if this shift was blocked in the VTA. Although an excitatory shift in GABA 
transmission in the adult brain is usually associated with pathological conditions, similar 
transitions were found in the HPA axis following stress and in the VTA following chronic 
exposure to opiates (Hewitt et al., 2009; Laviolette et al., 2004; Sarkar et al., 2011). When 
our results are taken with the accumulation of evidence in the literature, we speculate that 
the shift towards excitatory GABA signaling may be a more common phenomenon than is 
presently appreciated (Astorga et al., 2015; Chung, 2012).
Here we demonstrated that glucocorticoid receptor signaling within the VTA was necessary 
to increase ethanol self-administration after stress. Moreover, prolonged exposure to 
corticosterone in vitro (in midbrain slices) was sufficient to induce neuroadaptations 
associated with in vivo stress. These findings highlight the importance of glucocorticoid 
signaling within the VTA, but we do not rule out the participation of other stress signaling 
molecules or hormones, such as CRF, in mediating stress-induced adaptations (Hwa et al., 
2016; Ungless et al., 2003). Furthermore, the effect of glucocorticoids on VTA GABA 
neurons may involve the activity of noradrenaline, glutamate, and glial cells (Coull et al., 
2003; Hewitt et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2011; Taylor et al., 2015).
Although animal studies generally support the hypothesis that stress increases ethanol 
consumption, some results have shown that stress decreases intake or has no effect on it 
(Becker et al., 2011). These differences arise from a combination of factors, including the 
type of stressor used, the duration or timing of the stressor, as well as the type of drinking

 paradigm employed (Noori et al., 2014). An important parameter in our experimental design 
is that the stress exposure was well separated (15–20 hrs) from the ethanol self-
administration, which allowed us to examine the lasting neural circuit consequences of the 
treatment not the proximal effect of stress itself. In our study, we kept the ethanol content of 
the drinking solutions relatively low during the acquisition phase, which likely resulted in 
less variability in self-administration. The rats experienced less of the aversive stimulus cues 
of ethanol while still achieving significant blood-ethanol levels. In addition, some animals 
show resilience to the effects of stress (Pfau and Russo, 2015), so it is essential to verify that 
there is a physiological response to the stressor and to exclude animals that do not show that 
response.
In summary, we showed that acute stress exposure decreases the sensitivity of the DA 
system to ethanol and increases subsequent ethanol self-administration. These effects 
required a shift towards excitatory GABAA signaling in the VTA and were associated with 
decreased chloride extrusion capacity in VTA GABA neurons. The temporally distant, acute, 
intense stress experience produced long-lasting neuroadaptations within the mesolimbic 
systems of the brain that were expressed upon exposure to ethanol. This overall process 
represents one mechanistic pathway linking life stress experiences to increased alcohol use. 
However, future work should determine if similar mechanisms also contribute to the effects 
of stress during chronic alcohol use and relapse.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Additional detail is provided in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Subjects
Male Long-Evans rats (Harlan-Envigo) weighing 300–500 g were used for in vivo studies. 
All animals were handled at least 5 days prior to the onset of surgery/behavioral testing and 
were singly housed in a quiet, temperature- and humidity-controlled satellite facility under at 
12-hour light/dark cycle. Rats had food and water available ad libitum in their home cage. 
All procedures were carried out in compliance with guidelines specified by the Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee at University of Pennsylvania.
Drugs and experimental design
Systemic or intra-VTA administration of RU486 occurred 15 min before stress (Saal et al., 
2003), whereas intra-VTA microinfusions of acetazolamide or CLP290 occurred 15–30 min 
before microdialysis or ethanol self-administration.
Stressed animals were subjected to a 1-hour of immobilization in a clear cylindrical 
Broome-style restrainer. We required that the rats display somatic signs of stress, and the 
immobilization potently activated the stress hormone systems (Pitman et al., 1988). Restraint 
stress occurred 15–20 hours prior to ethanol exposure or testing.

 Operant ethanol self-administration
Standard operant chambers (Med Associates Inc., St. Albans, VT, USA) were used for the 
self-administration experiments. Animals were initially water-restricted overnight and 
trained to lever press for a saccharin solution (0.125%, w/v). Once trained, the animals were 
no longer water restricted and their baseline saccharin intake was monitored for at least 3 
days until intake appeared stable. If the animals underwent surgery, saccharin intake was re-
established. The effects of stress on acquisition of ethanol self-administration were then 
measured. Ethanol was introduced into the saccharin drinking solution in the following way: 
2% ethanol on day 1 and 4% ethanol usually for all subsequent days except for additional 
experiments with 7% and 10% ethanol (Figure S1A, B).
In vivo microdialysis
For in vivo microdialysis (Doyon et al., 2013), animals were habituated to tethering and the 
microdialysis chambers one day prior to testing. Baseline DA samples were collected (15–
30 min), followed by a timed intravenous (i.v.) infusion of ethanol (1.5 g/kg, 20% in sterile 
saline, v/v) over 5 min. The i.v. route (using a cannula) was chosen to circumvent handling-
related disturbances in DA levels associated with i.p. injections. Dialysis samples were 
analyzed for DA content using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to an 
electrochemical detector.
In vivo electrophysiology
Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and implanted with a catheter in the jugular vein. 
Animals were positioned on a stereotaxic apparatus and burr holes were drilled to 
accommodate recording and ground electrodes. Rat body temperature was maintained 
throughout the experiment at 37 °C using an isothermal pad.
Glass electrodes backfilled with 0.5M Na+-acetate and 2% Chicago Sky Blue (5 −15 MΩ) 
were positioned in the lateral VTA (coordinates: 5.3–6.0 mm posterior from bregma, 0.8–1.4 
lateral to midline and 7.5–8.5 ventral to brain surface). Electrical signals were filtered at 0.3- 
5 kHz.
DA and GABA neurons were identified in vivo using established electrophysiological and 
pharmacological criteria (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). After 6–20 min of 
stable baseline recording, we infused 0.3 g/kg of ethanol i.v. every 3 mins (for a final dose of 
1.5 g/kg) and recorded single-unit activity. Drug-induced changes were calculated as a 
percent of baseline for each 3-min period. Following ethanol administration, quinpirole and 
eticlopride were infused (i.v., 0.25 mg/kg) to aid in the identification of VTA neurons. 
Chicago Sky Blue injections were used to identify the recording sites.
Ex vivo electrophysiology
Horizontal slices (230 µm) containing the VTA were cut (Leica Microsystems) from Long-
Evans rats (21–30 days old). The firing rates of VTA DA and GABA neurons were recorded 
in the cell-attached configuration in passive voltage-follower mode. For synaptic stimulation 
recordings, a bipolar tungsten-stimulating electrode (World Precision Instruments, Inc) was 
placed 100–150 µm away from the recording electrode. After each cell-attached experiment,

 recordings were converted to the whole-cell configuration and Ih current was measured. 
Most cells were also backfilled with neurobiotin for immuno-identification.
Spontaneous and evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents were recorded in voltage clamp 
mode in the whole-cell configuration. Synaptic GABAA inputs were isolated 
pharmacologically. The liquid junction potential between the bath and the pipette solutions 
was corrected. Gramicidin perforated-patch recordings were applied to maintain the anionic 
gradient during reversal potential measurements. Supplemental Experimental Procedures 
provide the details for the perforated-patch, the western blot, and the immunohistochemical 
procedures.
Statistical analysis
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures (in SPSS for Windows) was used to 
analyze the dialysate and the basal DA concentrations, and the DA and GABA neuron firing 
rates. For analysis of action potential firing, the raw data (in Hz) were converted into percent 
of basal, and the last three bins (2-min each) before bath application of ethanol were used as 
the baseline. For analysis of repetitive synaptic stimulation, the last ten bins (0.5-s each) 
before the stimulus were used as the baseline. Exponential fittings were compared by F-test. 
A two-tail t-test assuming equal variance was used to assess differences between the mean 
sIPSC frequency, the mean firing rates, as well as the mean ethanol intake levels. For 
western blot analysis, a paired t-test was used to compare protein levels from control and 
stress littermates that were run on the same gel. Significance for all analyses was determined 
by p < 0.05.

repeated measures, p < 0.01, n = 7–8 cells/group.
F) The GABAA receptor antagonist, picrotoxin, prevented ethanol’s attenuation of VTA DA 
neuron firing rates after stress (red) and showed a response similar to the unstressed controls 
(black), n = 9–15 cells/group.
G) Spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC) onto VTA DA neurons were 
recorded using the whole-cell patch clamp configuration. No significant differences were 
detected in the mean basal sIPSC frequency or amplitude between stressed and control 
groups before ethanol: frequency, 2.4 ± 0.6 Hz in control vs. 2.3 ± 0.3 Hz after stress; 
amplitude, 26.2 ± 4.0 pA in control vs. 30.8 ± 3.6 pA after stress, p > 0.05, n = 8–10.
H) Representative recordings of sIPSCs before and after ethanol administration in the 
control (black) and stressed (red) groups.
I) Mean changes in the sIPSC frequency after ethanol application in VTA DA neurons. DA 
neurons from stressed animals (red) demonstrated a significantly increased ethanol-mediated 
sIPSC frequency compared to neurons from unstressed controls (black). Systemic inhibition 
of glucocorticoid receptors with RU486 (40 mg/kg) prior to stress prevented elevated sIPSC 
frequency (gray). Incubation of VTA slices from control animals with corticosterone 
increased ethanol-mediated sIPSC frequency in DA neurons up to stress levels (dark blue). 
Co-incubation with RU486 prevented this increase (light blue). Incubation of brain slices 
with RU486 and/or corticosterone did not alter basal parameters of sIPSCs (data not shown). 
Across all groups, ethanol application did not produce significant changes in the sIPSC 
amplitudes (data not shown, n = 6–10, p > 0.05). **Significantly different from control and 
RU486-treated groups by t-test, p < 0.01, n = 6–10 cells/group.

 Figure 4. Stress Increases Ethanol-induced GABA Neuron Firing Rates Ex Vivo
A) Spontaneous firing rate of VTA GABA neurons was measured using the cell-attached 
configuration, and the whole-cell configuration was used to identify GABA neurons 
electrophysiologically and histochemically upon termination of the recording.
B) VTA GABA neurons displayed fast spontaneous firing rates (> 7 Hz) and lack of Ih 
current.
C) Neurobiotin-labeled VTA neurons with these electrophysiological properties were 
immuno-negative for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), consistent with a non-DA phenotype.
D) VTA GABA neurons from stressed rats (red) showed a greater increase in firing rate 
following ethanol application (grey horizontal bar) than did GABA neurons from the 
unstressed controls (black). **Significantly different from the control by ANOVA with 
repeated measures, p < 0.01, n = 9 cells/group.
E) Glutamatergic receptor antagonists (DNQX and AP5) did not prevent the enhanced firing 
rate of VTA GABA neurons from stressed animals in response to ethanol. **Significantly 
different from the control by ANOVA with repeated measures, p < 0.01, n = 6–7 cells/group.
F) GABAA receptor antagonist, picrotoxin, prevented the ethanol-induced increase of 
GABA neuron firing rates after stress (red), and the firing rate was similar to the unstressed 
controls (black), n = 7–12 cells/group. The basal firing of VTA GABA neurons was not 
significantly different between control and stress groups (before ethanol): 11.1 ± 1.4 Hz vs. 
11.3 ± 1.3 Hz, p > 0.05, n = 9.

 Figure 5. Stress Promotes GABA-mediated Excitation of VTA GABA Neurons Ex Vivo
A) VTA GABA neurons were recorded in a cell-attached configuration before and after 
electrical stimulation of GABAA receptor inputs. To isolate GABAA receptor inputs, AMPA, 
NMDA, and GABAB receptors were inhibited with antagonists: DNQX, AP5 and 
CGP55845 respectively.
B) Representative GABA neuron recording from a control animal demonstrated decreased 
firing rate in response to stimulation of GABAergic input (black). Similar stimulation

traces were filtered and stimulus artifacts were removed.
C) Mean changes in VTA GABA neuron firing rate from control (black) and stressed (red) 
rat slices following repetitive stimulation of synaptic GABA inputs. **Significantly different 
from the control by ANOVA with repeated measures, p < 0.01, n = 8–10 cells/group.
D) Representative VTA GABA neuron recording from a stressed rat demonstrated that in the 
presence of picrotoxin (upper) or acetazolamide (ACTZ, lower), repetitive stimulation of 
GABA inputs failed to increase the firing rate.
E) Normalized mean changes in the firing rates of VTA GABA neurons in response to 
stimulation for each treatment group. Values were averaged over 5 s immediately following 
termination of the stimulation. In controls, GABAA receptor-mediated increase in the firing 
rate was observed after slice incubation with corticosterone (blue). Significantly different 
from the control by t-test (p < 0.05, *), n = 8–10 cells/group or (p < 0.01, **), n = 6–8 cells/
group.

 Figure 6. Stress Requires Excitatory GABA Shift to Attenuate Ethanol-induced DA Levels and 
Increase Ethanol Self-administration Ex Vivo and In Vivo
A) In the presence of bath applied acetazolamide (ACTZ), ethanol-induced VTA GABA 
neuron firing was no longer enhanced after exposure to stress (red) and was similar to the 
response of the unstressed controls (black). The effect of stress exposure and ethanol 
application in the absence of acetazolamide from Figure 4D is shown for comparison (dotted 
red line), n = 8 cells/group. Note, bath application of acetazolamide on VTA slices (before 
ethanol) did not produce any significant alterations in the mean basal firing rate of GABA 
neurons between control and stress groups.

 B) In the presence of bath ACTZ, ethanol-induced VTA DA neuron firing was no longer 
attenuated after exposure to stress (red) and was similar to the response of the unstressed 
controls (black). The effect of stress exposure and ethanol application in the absence of 
ACTZ from Figure 3D is shown for comparison (dotted red line), n = 10–14 cells/group. 
Note, bath application of ACTZ on VTA slices (before ethanol) did not produce any 
significant alterations in the mean basal firing rate of DA neurons between control and stress 
groups.
C) Stressed animals received intra-VTA infusion of ACTZ or vehicle prior to the onset of 
baseline microdialysis sample collection. Subsequent ethanol-induced DA release in the 
NAc was measured.
D) In contrast to vehicle injection (red), ethanol-induced DA levels in the NAc following 
ACTZ infusion were not blunted (blue) and were similar to the control response from Figure 
2B (dotted black line). **Significantly different from the VTA vehicle group by ANOVA 
with repeated measure, p < 0.01, n = 7 rats/group.
E) Stressed animals received bilateral intra-VTA infusions of ACTZ or vehicle prior to the 
onset of each self-administration session.
F) ACTZ-infused stressed animals consumed significantly less ethanol (blue) compared to 
vehicle-infused stressed animals (red). Ethanol consumption in unstressed control rats from 
Figure 1C is shown for comparison (dotted horizontal line). *Significantly different from the 
VTA vehicle group by t-test, p < 0.05, n = 10–14 rats/group.

 Figure 7. Stress Weakens Cl− Extrusion and Decreases the Function of KCC2 in the VTA
A) GABAergic input onto VTA GABA neurons was recorded using gramicidin perforated 
patches at different holding potentials to measure stress-induced alterations in anion 
homeostasis. GABAA IPSCs were evoked by electrical stimulation in the presence of 
DNQX, AP5, and CGP55845.
B) Representative IPSCs recordings from control (black) and stressed (red) animals at the 
given holding potentials. The IPSCs reverse direction at the EGABA. For display, the traces 
were filtered and stimulus artifacts were removed.

 C) VTA GABA neurons from stressed animals (red, **, p < 0.01 by t-test) demonstrated a 
significantly more positive EGABA value compared to neurons from unstressed control 
animals (black square), n = 10 cells/group.
D) Cl− accumulation was estimated by stimulating repetitive GABAA receptor input. Upon 
stimulation (20 Hz, Vh = 0 mV), a representative GABA neuron from a control (black) 
animal demonstrated a minor depression of IPSC amplitude compared to the significantly 
greater depression seen in a GABA neuron from a stressed animal (red).
E) At 0 mV, VTA GABA neurons from stressed animals (red) demonstrated a significantly 
higher rate of evoked IPSC amplitude depression compared to control animals (black). 
**Significantly different from the control by F-test, p < 0.01, n = 10–17 cells/group.
F) Western blot analysis was conducted for total KCC2 and phosphorylated-S940 KCC2 
with GAPDH as a loading control. A representative western blot indicates no differences in 
total KCC2 expression after stress. However, stressed animals showed reduced expression of 
pS940 KCC2 relative to total KCC2 when compared to non-stressed controls.
G) Densiometric analysis revealed a significant reduction in the ratio of pS940 KCC2 to 
total KCC2 protein in stressed animals compared to non-stress controls (horizontal dashed 
line). *Significantly different from the control by t-test, p < 0.05, n = 10 animals/group.
H) Densiometric analysis revealed a significant reduction in the ratio of pS940 KCC2 to 
total KCC2 protein in corticosterone-incubated slices from controls *Significantly different 
from the control by t-test, p < 0.05, n = 16 animals/group.

 Figure 8. KCC2 activation in the VTA prevents stress-ethanol interaction
A) When brain slices were incubated in the KCC2 activator, CLP290, EGABA was 
hyperpolarized comparably in VTA GABA neurons from control (black) and stressed (red) 
animals. The effect of stress exposure on EGABA in the absence of CLP290 is shown for 
comparison (open red square), n = 6 cells/group
B) After CLP290 incubation, ethanol-induced VTA DA neuron firing was no longer 
attenuated after exposure to stress (red) and was similar to the response of the unstressed 
controls (black). The effect of stress exposure and ethanol application in the absence of

 CLP290 is shown for comparison (dotted red line), n = 10 cells/group. Note, incubation of 
VTA slices with CLP290 (before ethanol) did not produce any significant alterations in the 
mean basal firing rate of DA neurons between control and stress groups.
C) CLP290 was infused bilaterally intra-VTA (40 µM at 0.5 µl/min). After CLP290 
administration, stressed animals consumed significantly less ethanol (blue) compared to 
vehicle-injected stressed animals (red). Ethanol consumption in unstressed control rats is 
shown for comparison (dotted horizontal line). *Significantly different from the VTA 
vehicle group by t-test, p < 0.05, n = 12–13 rats/group.
