Health Disorders in the United States

Background: The extent to which adults with mental health disorders in the United States receive opi-
oids has not been adequately reported.
Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of a nationally representative sample of the noninsti-
tutionalized U.S. adult population from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. We examined the rela-
tionship between mental health (mood and anxiety) disorders and prescription opioid use (defined as
receiving at least 2 prescriptions in a calendar year).
Results: We estimate that among the 38.6 million Americans with mental health disorders, 18.7%
(7.2 million of 38.6 million) use prescription opioids. Adults with mental health conditions receive
51.4% (60 million of 115 million prescriptions) of the total opioid prescriptions distributed in the
United States each year. Compared with adults without mental health disorders, adults with mental
health disorders were significantly more likely to use opioids (18.7% vs 5.0%; P < .001). In adjusted
analyses, having a mental health disorder was associated with prescription opioid use overall (odds
ratio, 2.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.83–2.35).
Conclusions: The 16% of Americans who have mental health disorders receive over half of all opi-
oids prescribed in the United States. Improving pain management among this population is critical to
reduce national dependency on opioids. (J Am Board Fam Med 2017;30:407–417.)

The United States is in the midst of an epidemic of
morbidity and mortality due to prescription opioid
use.1 Over the past 15 years the number of pre-
scription opioid analgesic medications sold in the
United States has quadrupled, yet the amount of
pain or disability that Americans experience has
remained unchanged.2 The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention reports that from 2000 to
2014, more than 165,000 people have died from
overdoses related to prescription opioid use.2 The
identification of specific populations that rely heav-
ily on opioids is of strategic importance for risk
mitigation efforts. For instance, attention has fo-
cused on patients recovering from trauma and sur-
gery, among whom poor coping strategies were
associated with long-term reliance on opioids.3,4
Previous studies suggest that adults with mental
health disorders (ie, mood and anxiety disorders)
are more likely to be prescribed opioids and remain
taking them long-term.5–8 For example, adults with
mood disorders are nearly twice as likely to use
opioids long-term for pain.8 In fact, pain is very
common among adults with mental health disor-
ders,9,10 and the relationship between mental ill-
ness and opioid use is complex. However, some
suggest that mental illness may be a moderator in
the relationship between pain and opioid use.5 De-
spite the increase in the prevalence of mental health
disorders11 and the importance of tracking use of
prescription opioids nationally, the extent to which

 U.S. adults with mental health disorders use pre-
scription opioids has not been thoroughly exam-
ined. Furthermore, identification of the specific
factors that may underpin the association would
help clarify the complex relationship between men-
tal health and pain.
Therefore, we used the nationally representative
Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to ex-
amine the relationship between mental health dis-
orders and prescription opioid use. Because anxiety
and depression are the predominate mental health
disorders among adults in the United States,11 we
focused our attention on these 2 conditions. Our
objective was to derive national estimates of opioid
use among Americans with mental health disorders
and to examine factors associated with such use.
Methods
We performed a cross-sectional study using nation-
ally representative data from the MEPS, a survey of
the U.S. noninstitutionalized population that is
conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality that gathers extensive information on
health care utilization (including prescription med-
ications), expenditures, and health status.12 The
survey uses an overlapping panel design consisting
of a household component, a medical provider
component, and an insurance provider component.
To avoid potential recall bias, participants are sur-
veyed about past health and health care use at
6-month intervals. Personal and family-level data
obtained from the household, medical provider,
and insurance provider components are aggregated
by the MEPS study team. For this study we used
data from the MEPS household component files,
including the full-year consolidated, medical con-
dition, and prescription medication files. Because
our study used only publically available and deiden-
tified data, it was granted an exemption from insti-
tutional board review.
Study Sample
To increase the sample size in order to generate
more stable national estimates for subgroups, we
appended 2011 and 2013 MEPS data. These survey
years were chosen because they were the most re-
cently available at the time of analysis and ensured
an adequate sample size. We excluded 2012 data
because of duplication of participants due to the
overlapping panel design (ie, aggregation of MEPS
surveys in adjacent years would result in noninde-
pendence of study participants). A total of 52,000
adults (aged �18 years) participated in MEPS in
these 2 years (25,465 in 2011 and 26,535 in 2013).
After ineligible respondents were removed, such as
those who were institutionalized for a period of
time during the study, our final analytic sample
consisted of 51,891 adults.
Measures
Identification of Adults with Mental Health Disorders
Each MEPS participant is asked to identify any
health conditions in 6-month time periods. For
those who have a self-reported health condition,
trained MEPS staff code conditions using the In-
ternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revi-
sion, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. A
special feature of the MEPS is that the health care
providers and facilities provide data on MEPS par-
ticipants’ health care use; such data are then cross-
referenced with survey responses from the partici-
pant. Thus, if a person with a mental health
disorder did not self-report having the condition,
they would still be identified if they had a clinical
diagnosis.
Based on the combination of self-report and
administrative clinical data, we identified partici-
pants who had a mental health disorder. To do so
we used ICD-9-CM codes truncated to the first 3
digits, including 300 (Anxiety, dissociative and so-
matoform disorders), 311 (Depressive disorder),
and 296 (Episodic mood disorders), to identify
adult MEPS participants with mental health disor-
ders13 (Appendix Table 1).
Prescription Opioid Use
The MEPS collects detailed data on prescription
medications using a unique combination of partic-
ipant self-report and administrative data obtained
from pharmacies. MEPS participants are asked to
supply the name of any prescribed medications and
the name and location of the pharmacy where they
obtained the prescription. Participants provide
written permission for the release of pharmacy re-
cords. Pharmacies are contacted to obtain records,
which detail the date filled, the National Drug
Code, medication name, strength of the medication
(amount and unit), quantity (package size), and pay-
ments by source. To identify meaningful classes of
drugs, National Drug Codes are merged to the
comprehensive Multum Lexicon crosswalk.14 We

 used the Multum drug classes for oral “Narcotic
analgesics” and “Narcotic analgesics combinations”
in order to identify oral prescription opioid medi-
cations. In the MEPS prescription medication data,
the most common oral opioid prescriptions—
which account for approximately 65% of all opioid
prescriptions—include
hydrocodone
with
acet-
aminophen, tramadol, and hydrocodone. Our study
was focused on examining the likelihood of receiv-
ing prescription opioid medications rather than
chronic use; thus we operationally defined an opi-
oid user as an adult who filled �2 prescription
medications in the calendar year.
To explore the clinical diagnoses associated with
prescription opioids, we also examined the top 10
clinical diagnoses for which opioids were pre-
scribed. To collapse ICD-9-CM codes into rele-
vant clinical disorders, the MEPS uses the Clinical
Classification Software developed by the Health-
care Cost and Utilization Project.15
Covariates
We extracted a variety of health measures to be
used as covariates (Appendix Table 2). The MEPS
administers the 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-
12) to participants.16 From these data, we calcu-
lated the mean physical component summary
(PCS) and mental component summary (MCS)
scores of the SF-12 (PCS and MCS scores range
from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating the highest level
of health). We examined several items of the SF-12
separately as well. We collapsed self-reported
health status17 into “excellent, very good, or good”
versus “fair or poor.” Because pain is the primary
driver of prescription opioid use, we examined the
SF-12 item on pain. The item inquires, “During
the past 4 weeks, how much did pain interfere with
your normal work (including work outside the
home and housework)?” We collapsed the response
set into none or little (“not at all” or “a little bit”),
moderate (“moderately”) or severe (“quite a bit” or
“extremely”). Based on a combination of measures
of both physical and cognitive limitations, we also
calculated the percentage of participants with “any
functional limitation,” “physical limitation,” “social
limitation,” and “cognitive limitation.” We also
identified those who were smokers (current vs
never or former). Last, based on all medical condi-
tions (ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes reported in the
medical condition files) we generated a comorbid-
ity score. To do so, we applied a modified version
of the Charlson Comorbidity Index18 developed by
D’Hoore et al.19
We used ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes 303 (Alco-
hol dependence syndrome), 304 (Drug depen-
dence), and 305 (Nondependent abuse of drugs) to
identify study participants with substance abuse
disorders. The MEPS inquires about cancer diag-
noses; we used these items to identify participants
who had cancer. We also identified participants
with musculoskeletal conditions using a previously
applied approach.20
From the MEPS annual consolidated files, we ex-
tracted sociodemographic data for participants in our
study, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital sta-
tus, level of education, and health insurance coverage.
Age was collapsed into relevant age categories, in-
cluding young adult (18–44 years), middle-aged adult
(45–64 years), and older adult (�65 years). We also
identified those adults who underwent an outpatient
surgery, underwent surgery during an inpatient ad-
mission, or visited an emergency department specifi-
cally related to a physical injury.
Statistical Analyses
Our primary analyses examined the relationship
between having a mental health disorder and the
likelihood of prescription opioid use. We used sim-
ple descriptive measures to examine differences be-
tween adults with mental health disorders and
those without, restricted to those with specific
characteristics (eg, a cancer diagnosis, those self-
reporting having severe pain, etc.). The �2 test was
used to compare proportions and an independent t
test was used to compare means. A 2-sided P value
�.05 was considered statistically significant.
We used logit models to examine the relation-
ship while adjusting for differences, and coefficients
from our models were exponentiated to express
associations in the form of odds ratios. Covariates
in our model included age (continuous), sex, race/
ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
Hispanic, other), health insurance coverage (pri-
vate, public, uninsured), having a usual source of
care, self-reported limitation due to pain (little/
none, moderate, severe), PCS score (continuous),
physical limitation, substance use disorder diagno-
sis, outpatient surgery use, and inpatient surgery
use. Because our operational definition of an opioid
user was based on receiving 2 or more prescriptions
in the calendar year, we also performed a sensitivity
analysis in which we varied our definition to in-

 clude between 1 and 5 prescriptions and then re-
examined associations.
For all analyses we used complex survey design
methods to make national estimates, which account
for a participant’s probability of selection and sam-
pling methodology. Because our study aggregated
2011 and 2013 MEPS data, survey weights were
adjusted so that the data represented a single cal-
endar year. Analyses were based on complete case
analysis, and we assumed any missing values to be
missing completely at random. Analyses were con-
ducted using Stata MP, version 14.0 (StataCorp,
College Station, TX).
Results
Among the 239.4 million U.S. adults, we estimate
that 38.6 million had a mental health disorder (Ta-
ble 1 and Figure 1). Of the adults with mental
health disorders, 18.7% were opioid users, com-
pared with only 5.0% among those without mental
health disorders (P �.001) (Figure 2). We estimate
that approximately 115 million opioid prescriptions
are distributed each year in the United States,
51.4% (60 million prescriptions) of which are re-
ceived by adults who have a mental health disorder.
Characteristics of Adults with a Mental Health
Disorder Who Use Opioids
Among adults with mental health disorders, opioid
users differed in several ways. Opioid users were
older (nearly 75% of opioid users were aged �45
years compared with 60% among nonopioid users),
more likely to be non-Hispanic white, and com-
pleted less educational (P � .001 for all) (Table 1).
Comparing opioid users with and without a mental
health disorder, those with a mental health disorder
were more likely to be middle-aged, female, non-
Hispanic white, and divorced, separated, or wid-
owed.
Among adults with mental health disorders, opi-
oid users were considerably less healthy than non-
opioid users (Table 1 and Appendix Table 2). The
mean PCS score was 33.5 (standard error, 0.50)
among opioid users versus 47.7 (standard error,
0.20) among nonopioid users (P � .001). Likewise,
among adults with mental health disorders, opioid
users had considerably more comorbidities; for in-
stance, 18.1% of opioid users had �3 comorbidi-
ties, compared with just 6.3% among nonopioid
users. Adults with mental health disorders who use
opioids also had much higher self-reported pain
levels (eg, 60.0% of opioid users reported severe
pain compared with only 16.2% among nonopioid
users). Among opioid users, those with mental
health disorders were less healthy than those with-
out mental health disorders, but the differences
were less pronounced.
Opioid Use Among Adults with Mental Health
Disorders
Among specific subpopulations based on the level
of self-reported pain, cancer diagnosis, and muscu-
loskeletal conditions, the higher percentage of opi-
oid users persisted among adults with mental health
conditions compared with those without (P � .001
for all) (Figure 2). Most notable was nearly twice
the percentage of opioid users among adults with
severe pain (45.3% of adults with mental health
disorders were opioid users compared with 24.1%
among those without mental health disorders).
The top 10 clinical diagnoses associated with
prescription opioids for Americans with mental
health disorders included musculoskeletal disor-
ders, poorly defined conditions, or an otherwise
missing diagnosis (Figure 3). The top 10 clinical
diagnoses we identified among adults with mental
health disorders account for 54.0% of the total
opioids prescribed to this population, suggesting
considerable variation in clinical diagnosis.
Association Between Mental Health Disorders and
Opioid Use
In unadjusted analyses the odds of opioid use was
�4 times higher among adults with mental health
disorders than among those without (odds ratio
[OR], 4.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.93–
4.77) (Table 2). After adjusting for sociodemo-
graphic characteristics, health status, and use of
selected health services, although attenuated, the
association persisted: adults with mental health dis-
orders had more than twice the odds of being an
opioid user (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.83–2.35). Other
notable factors in the fully adjusted model associ-
ated with opioid use included having a usual source
of care (OR, 1.67), having moderate or severe self-
reported pain (ORs , 2.15 and 3.15, respectively),
reporting a physical limitation (OR, 1.84), having
had surgery (ORs, 2.73 and 3.58 for outpatient and
inpatient surgery, respectively), and having a sub-
stance abuse diagnosis (OR, 2.42).

 study offers several contributions. First, we found
that the population of adults with mental health
disorders receive more than half of the total opioid
prescriptions in the United States. Second, among
the nearly 40 million Americans who have a mental
health condition, approximately 19% use prescrip-
tion opioids. Last, higher opioid use among those
with mental health disorders persists across key
characteristics, including cancer status and various
levels of self-reported pain.
Although evidence-based prescribing guidelines
are emerging,21,22 there exists a complex interac-
tion of factors related to the patient, provider, and
medical and social conditions that ultimately results
in the decision to prescribe an opioid.23 Our find-
ings that patients with mental illness are more
likely to receive opioid prescriptions across all dif-
ferent levels of pain suggests that there may be
additional patient- and provider-related factors
specific to those with mental illness that increase
the likelihood of receiving prescription opioids.
Such a relationship is particularly concerning be-
cause mental illness is also a prominent risk factor
for overdose and other adverse opioid-related out-
comes.24,25 Thus, the expectation would be that
physicians would be more conservative with their
prescribing behaviors in the setting of mental ill-
ness and favor nonopioid alternatives. The ability

 to identify populations that may use prescription
opioids independent of pain would be of strategic
importance for mitigating potential risk at a popu-
lation health level.
The challenge with pain management is that
there is no biological measure of pain or objective
assessment of efficacy of treatment. The Interna-
tional Association for the Study of Pain adopted a
definition of pain that is widely accepted.26 The
definition states that pain is “an unpleasant sensory
and emotional experience, associated with actual or
threatened tissue damage, or described in terms of
such.” The definition thus relies on physician in-
terpretation and the subjective experience of the
patient. Thus, one could hypothesize that increased
opioid use in patients with mental health disorders
may be related to a variety of psychological factors
that may contribute to an increased subjective ex-
perience of pain or to increased likelihood of using
opioids irrespective of pain level.5
Our finding that approximately 19% of adults
with mental health disorders use prescription opi-
oids aligns with what is to our knowledge the only
other article that used nationally representative
data to examine this relationship. Halbert and col-
leagues8 examined patients with pain-related con-
ditions and found those who had mood disorders
were more likely to initiate opioid use than those
without mood disorders: 19.3% of patients with
pain and mood disorders initiated opioid use, com-
pared with 17.2% of patients with pain without
mood disorders. Evidence indicating an increased
risk of depressive symptoms in patients receiving
chronic opioids may raise concerns regarding re-
verse causality.27 The relationship between mental
health disorders and pain is also likely bidirectional,
with improvements in pain leading to improve-
ments in mental health symptoms and vice versa.28
Furthermore, some evidence indicates that opti-
mizing depression and pain treatment can improve
outcomes in both areas for patients seen in primary
care.29 Although the relationship between mental
health disorders, pain, and opioid use is complex,
we found that having a mental health disorder is
associated with increased opioid use even after con-
trolling for a wide array of other demographic and
clinical risk factors, including substance abuse. The
high prevalence of mental health disorders cou-
pled with prescription opioid use suggests that
this population is critical to consider when ad-
dressing the issue of opioid use from a health
system or policy perspective. Although a number
of important steps are already underway to ad-
dress opioid use in this country, such as the

treatment of comorbid mental health disorders

to reduce the overall negative impacts of opioid
use on patients and communities.
Study Limitations
Our study has several limitations that must be
acknowledged. First, our study used a cross-sec-
tional, observational design and therefore is not
intended to demonstrate a cause–effect relation-
ship between having a mental health disorder and
using opioids. Thus we cannot rule out the ef-
fects of residual confounding nor potential re-
verse causality. However, with regard to the lat-
ter, recent evidence from longitudinal analyses
suggests opioid-naïve patients with mood disor-
ders are in fact more likely to initiate prescription
opioids and to transition to longer-term opioid
use than those without a mood disorder.8 Second,
because we focused on determining whether clin-
ical treatment varies by mental health disorder
status, our study only examined prescription opi-
oid use and therefore neglects any concurrent
illicit medication use. Third, we investigated the
association between mental health disorders and
opioid use among noninstitutionalized U.S. adult
citizens. Therefore, findings among children or
institutionalized adults may differ. Last, the
MEPS data on health care utilization and expen-

causing inaccuracies; however, the MEPS at-

Despite these inherent limitations, our study of-
fers valuable insights regarding opioid use among
Americans with mental health disorders. Although
the relationship between mental health and pain
management is complex, we find that as a popula-
tion, adults with mental health disorders receive
more than half of all opioid prescriptions distrib-
uted each year in the United States. This finding
warrants more research to understand further the
association between mental health disorders and
prescription opioid use, and to promote safer opi-
oid use among this population.
