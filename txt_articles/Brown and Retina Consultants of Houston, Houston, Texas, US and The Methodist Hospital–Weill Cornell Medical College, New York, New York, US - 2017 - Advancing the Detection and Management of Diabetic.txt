T
he incidence of diabetes in the US population has increased more than fourfold over the last several decades and a high proportion 
of these patients manifest diabetic eye disease, including diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME). Ultra-widefield 
(UWF) retinal imaging has emerged as a valuable tool in the evolving standard of care for DR, providing essential visualization of ischemia 
and related pathology across the retina, particularly in the periphery, where these signs may appear earliest but may not be detected by 
conventional fundus photography. Multimodal UWF imaging has helped correlate changes in the periphery with DR progression, providing 
important guidance for treatment planning and facilitating improved understanding of the underlying mechanisms of disease. Rapid capture, 
immediate retrieval and efficient sharing of UWF retinal images support a wide spectrum of care settings—including teleophthalmology 
programs—and facilitate patient education.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of adult vision loss in the developed world.1,2 
Epidemiological and demographic factors, including the rising rates of diabetes related to obesity 
and an aging population, are driving the incidence of diabetic eye disease inexorably higher. Over 
the past 35 years, the number of Americans diagnosed with diabetes increased fourfold, from 
 
5.5 million in 1980 to 22.0 million in 2014.3 In 2014, approximately 8 million Americans with diabetes 
were undiagnosed, making the total incidence of the disease in the US more than 29 million, or 9.3% 
percent of the population.4 Analyses based on data collected a decade ago in the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) suggest that nearly a third of all adults with diabetes 
 
in the US had signs of DR. This rate was even higher among specific populations of diabetic patients, 
with more than a third of Mexican Americans and nearly 40% of African Americans having diabetic 
eye disease. Patients in these groups were also more likely to present with severe disease and 
vision loss. Overall, an estimated 4.2 million adults had DR at that time and 655,000 had disease 
severe enough to be vision threatening.5 Given the data showing that the at-risk population has 
continued to grow at a similar rate, the clinical community must take aggressive action toward earlier 
identification and treatment of patients with DR. Meeting this challenge requires improved access 
to screening and referral as well as enhanced strategies for earlier detection, evaluation, treatment, 
and assessment of treatment success.
In this setting, digital, multi-modality ultra-widefield (UWFTM) retinal imaging (Optos, plc., Dunfermline, 
Scotland) provides a technological cornerstone for the evolving standard of care. With a single, 
non-contact capture, UWF retinal imaging allows high-resolution visualization of up to 82%, or 200 
degrees, of the retina (producing the digital optomap®), displaying the most retinal surface area of any 
available imaging system.6 Optos systems incorporate a proprietary scanning laser ophthalmoscope 
(SLO) and ellipsoidal mirror, engineered specifically for UWF imaging. The SLO utilizes two low-power 
lasers that scan the retina simultaneously, with the green ‘red free’ wavelength (532 nm) permitting 
visualization of the sensory retina to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the red wavelength 
(635 nm) reaching deeper structures from the RPE to the choroid. The latest generation Optos 
UWF platform, California, utilizes enhanced optical hardware and software to improve resolution 
during scanning, producing clear, high-resolution images of virtually the entire retina. The automatic 
montage feature increases the field of view in many eyes to greater than 95%.7 California provides 
 
multi-modality imaging options including color, autofluorescence (AF), fluorescein angiography (FA), 
and indocyanine green angiography (ICG).

Ultra-widefild imaging in diabetic retinopathy 
detection and evaluation
The potential role of UWF imaging in the detection of DR has been described 
for nearly a decade.8 Early studies established the excellent correspondence 
between conventional Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study 
(ETDRS) 7-fields and optomap in evaluating DR and verified that UWF 
enabled the visualization of a much larger area of the peripheral retina 
(see Figure 1).9,10 One comparison in 103 patients with diabetes confirmed 
the correlation of conventional fundus photography and UWF images in 
DR assessment, while demonstrating that optomap required less than 
half the image capture time.11 Because at least two-thirds of potential 
retinal pathology lies in the periphery, UWF color and FA images allow 
the detection of vascular nonperfusion, peripheral microaneurysms, 
neovascularization, and vascular leakage that are missed by conventional 
ETDRS 7-fields photography. These peripheral lesions often occur earlier 
in the disease course; they may also provide evidence of more advanced 
disease.12–14 Combining UWF capabilities with ocular coherence tomography 
(OCT) has also been shown to have clinical utility in the assessment of DR.15
The capabilities of UWF retinal imaging are proving particularly 
useful in efforts to expand screening programs for DR, particularly in 
teleophthalmology settings for underserved, high-risk populations. 
Because optomap images can be captured, stored, and shared easily, even 
between practices that do not have Optos imaging systems, diagnostic 
efficiency, referral speed, and resource utilization can be improved in an 
increasingly time- and cost-constrained environment. In one diabetes 
teleophthalmology program, utilization of nonmydriatic UWF imaging 
shortened the time required for image evaluation by 28% and reduced 
the ungradable rate to less than 3%, compared with conventional imaging, 
while increasing the detection of DR by 17%.16 The same group studied 
nonmydriatic UWF imaging in a multi-state DR ocular telehealth program 
administered for the Indian Health Service. They found that, compared with 
non-mydriatic fundus photography, UWF imaging in this setting reduced 
the ungradable image rate by 81%, increased DR detection by nearly 
twofold, and identified peripheral lesions suggestive of more severe DR in 
nearly 10% of patients.17
The importance of examining the periphery in 
diabetic retinopathy
In addition to the fact that a significant amount of pathology associated 
with DR lies outside the central fields, a growing body of evidence points 
to the retinal periphery as a locus of early signs of diabetic eye disease 
and a source of important indications of its progression. Ischemia, a key 
driver of progression in DR, may appear first in the retinal periphery, well 
beyond the range of traditional angiography. A close association between 
predominantly peripheral lesions, the extent of nonperfusion and ischemia, 
and DR severity has been demonstrated with UWF FA.18 Analogous to trees 
shedding peripheral leaves in times of drought, and frostbite affecting distal 
extremities as the body works to preserve critical central organs, the human 
retina can experience marked peripheral capillary loss well before evidence 
of central pathology. Identifying the presence and extent of ischemia across 
the entire retina may permit more accurate assessment and effective 
management, particularly in staging anti-vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) treatments with photocoagulation (see Figures 2 and 3).19 Indeed, 
the value of UWF imaging in linking the extent of peripheral ischemia to 
the presence or potential development of diabetic macular edema (DME) 
and worsening disease, has been evaluated in several studies. Peripheral

ischemia, detected on UWF FA, has been strongly correlated with DME 
in treatment-naïve patients.20 Other investigators have proposed a new 
ischemic index based on UWF findings. 
This work established the relationship 
between peripheral nonperfusion, severity of DR, and recalcitrant macular 
edema, while suggesting that areas of untreated peripheral nonperfusion 
may be the source of mediators of ischemia and disease progression.21 The 
potential prognostic value of peripheral lesions identified with UWF was 
confirmed in a study that demonstrated the association of these findings 
with a significantly increased risk of disease progression over a four-
year period, independent of baseline severity of DR or diabetic control.22 
These observations suggest that the established ‘4-2-1’ rule for identifying 
severe non-proliferative DR and a high risk for disease progression, based 
on the evaluation of signs identified through conventional imaging of the 
central fields (diffuse intraretinal hemorrhages and microaneurysms in 
four quadrants, venous beading in two or more quadrants, or intraretinal 
microvascular abnormalities in one or more quadrants), may underestimate 
DR severity compared with findings in the periphery from UWF imaging. 
 
A multi-year study that will enroll at least 350 participants is being conducted 
by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCRnet) to further 
establish the impact of UWF evaluation of the retina on the assessment 
of DR and in predicting rates of DR progression over time, compared with 
conventional ETDRS 7-fields.23
The use of ultra-widefield retinal imaging in 
treatment planning
Visualization of the entire retina may provide a rationale to initiate treatment 
earlier and arrest progression sooner. This hypothesis is supported by the 
results of the Ranibizumab Injection in Subjects With Clinically Significant 
Macular Edema With Center Involvement Secondary to Diabetes Mellitus 
(RIDE and RISE) studies, which demonstrated that greater improvements in 
vision were achieved in eyes treated within the first two years, compared to 
eyes with chronic DME associated with irreversible damage to the retina.24 
Findings from peripheral examination have allowed us to intervene in 
cases of proliferative retinal vein occlusion before a hemorrhage occurs, 
reduce the number of vitrectomies we perform for floaters, and identify 
neovascularization earlier. The value of acting earlier is supported by data 
confirming that patients with post vitrectomy diabetic vitreous hemorrhage 
display higher rates of neovascularization, nonperfusion, and late vascular 
leakage in the periphery.25
Peripheral findings also provide important information about which areas 
of the retina should be treated. Our experience suggests that identifying 
areas of ischemia with UWF allows more precise targeting of pan-retinal 
photocoagulation (PRP) to retinal pathology while sparing areas that 
remain adequately perfused. Sparing of useful visual field (especially 
nasal and superior retina) can help preserve inferior and temporal depth 
perception important for walking down stairs or curbs and making driving 
safer. Finally, UWF retinal imaging can be employed to evaluate treatment 
success (see Figures 4, 5, and 6). For example, documentation with UWF FA 
of reperfusion in areas of nonperfusion following anti-VEGF treatment was 
recently described.26
Improving clinical and patient communication
The immediate availability of multimodal optomap images following single-
shot, nonmydriatic capture permits more efficient evaluation at the point of 
care. Remote review at a reading center or in other practices is facilitated 
by browser-based, platform-independent (DICOM compatible), Health

Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant image 
sharing and cloud storage. This ease of image sharing is particularly useful 
in referral situations or teleophthalmology settings. 
In addition to efficient evaluation and annotation by the clinical team, a 
single optomap or historical comparisons can be reviewed with the patient 
without delay during the office visit on a computer screen or tablet. While 
diabetes affects small blood vessels all over the body, DR is often the first 
manifestation of end-organ disease that can be detected. Many patients 
with diabetes are non-compliant with blood sugar control and are in 
denial that this is detrimental to their physical health and end organs. We 
have found that counseling a patient on improving blood sugar control 
while demonstrating with UWF imaging that damage is already occurring 
in their peripheral retina is often a very effective and convincing approach 
to education and behavior modification. We review the optomap with 
the patient and their care partners, pointing out microaneuryms and 
capillary non-perfusion. We advise them that if damage is occurring in 
the retina, then it is also happening in the heart, the kidneys, the brain, 
and throughout their body. In our experience, the immediacy of this vivid 
demonstration of the impact of their lack of adherence on the blood 
vessels in their body, particularly if historical comparison has indicated 
progression, helps patients and their loved ones realize that they need to 
become more serious about glycemic control and other aspects of their 
treatment plan.
Conclusion
The dramatic increase in the incidence of diabetes and associated eye 
disease will continue to pose a challenge for the clinical community. In 
this environment, UWF retinal imaging is valuable for effective screening, 
refinement of treatment decision-making, and advancement of our 
understanding of the disease process itself. By facilitating earlier diagnosis, 
earlier treatment, and more effective patient education, UWF retinal imaging 
is helping to shape the new standard of care for DR that will preserve vision 
for more of our patients with diabetes.
