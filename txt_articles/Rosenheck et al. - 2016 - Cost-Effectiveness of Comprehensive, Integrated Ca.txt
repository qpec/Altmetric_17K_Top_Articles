This study compares the cost-effectiveness of Navigate 
(NAV), a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, team-based treat-
ment approach for first episode psychosis (FEP) and usual 
Community Care (CC) in a cluster randomization trial. 
Patients at 34 community treatment clinics were randomly 
assigned to either NAV (N = 223) or CC (N = 181) for 2 years. 
Effectiveness was measured as a one standard deviation change 
on the Quality of Life Scale (QLS-SD). Incremental cost 
effectiveness ratios were evaluated with bootstrap distributions. 
The Net Health Benefits Approach was used to evaluate the 
probability that the value of NAV benefits exceeded its costs 
relative to CC from the perspective of the health care system. 
The NAV group improved significantly more on the QLS and 
had higher outpatient mental health and antipsychotic medi-
cation costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 
$12 081/QLS-SD, with a .94 probability that NAV was more 
cost-effective than CC at $40 000/QLS-SD. When converted 
to monetized Quality Adjusted Life Years, NAV benefits 
exceeded costs, especially at future generic drug prices.
Key words: schizophrenia/cost-effectiveness/ 
quality adjusted life years
Introduction
Research suggests that early intervention for psychotic 
disorders such as schizophrenia can improve outcomes,1–5 
and 2 cluster randomized trials6,7 have demonstrated 
effectiveness in routine service settings. One unanswered 
question is whether the increased costs of comprehen-
sive first episode psychosis (FEP) programs are offset by 
reduced inpatient costs, or whether the value of health 
benefits justifies the additional costs. While it has been 
reported that early intervention programs reduce hospi-
tal days in nonrandomized matched comparisons8–10 and 
in 1 randomized clinical trial (RCT),11 only 2 RCT-based 
cost-effectiveness analyses have been published.12,13 Both 
trials found non-significant reductions in costs, although 
when benefits were assigned monetary values, both sug-
gested that the benefits outweighed costs, albeit at less 
than the 95% confidence level. Further evaluation of the 
cost-effectiveness of early intervention programs in real-
world treatment settings is needed.
This study uses data from the Recovery After an 
Initial Schizophrenia Episode-Early Treatment Program 
(RAISE-ETP) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the 
Navigate (NAV) intervention package as compared to 
standard Community Care (CC) over 2 years from the 
perspective of the health care system.
Methods
The ETP study is part of the National Institute of Mental 
Health (NIMH) RAISE initiative. Details of the study,14 
the clinical intervention,15 participant characteristics,16–18 
and 2-year clinical outcomes,6 have been reported.

Cost-Effectiveness of First Episode Psychosis Treatment
Subjects and Sites
A total of 404 individuals aged 15–40 who presented for 
treatment for a FEP and had taken ≤6 months of life-
time antipsychotics were enrolled between July 2010 and 
July 2012. A CONSORT diagram of recruitment was 
previously published.6 Written informed consent was 
obtained from adult participants and legal guardians for 
those under 18 years old. The study was approved by the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the coordinating 
center and at participating sites. The NIMH Data and 
Safety Monitoring Board provided oversight. Thirty-four 
community mental health treatment centers were selected 
following a national invitation and selection process and 
randomly randomized equally to NAV or CC.
Intervention
NAV included 4 components: personalized medication 
management (assisted by a web-based decision support 
system, “COMPASS”); family psychoeducation; individ-
ual, resilience-focused illness self-management therapy; 
and supported education and employment.15 Robust dif-
ferences were demonstrated between NAV and CC sites 
in the delivery of these interventions.6
Weekly team meetings facilitated communication and 
coordination and NAV clinicians received training, on-
site supervision, and external expert consultation. CC 
sites provided treatment according to clinician choice and 
service availability.
Assessments
Outcomes. Trained clinician interviewers assessed the 
primary outcome measure, the Quality of Life Scale 
(QLS)19 using 2-way, live video conferencing. The pre-
ferred measure of outcome in cost-effectiveness analysis is 
the Quality Adjusted Life Year (QAL
Y), a cardinal mea-
sure ranging from 0 to 1 (death to perfect health).20 Since 
methods for deriving QAL
Ys from the QLS have not been 
published, we used a one standard deviation change on the 
QLS (the QLS-SD; 18.8 points) as our unit of outcome.
Data were also collected during video-conference 
interviews on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 
(PANSS).21 An algorithm that combines PANSS scores 
with side-effect indicators has been developed in recent 
years, and was used to generate a schizophrenia-spe-
cific measure of QALYs.22 Equipercentile linking was 
used to estimate the number of QLS-SDs in a QALY
. 
Equipercentile linking is a recently developed method 
for identifying corresponding points on correlated mea-
sures23 and has come into frequent use in psychiatric 
research recent years.24
Service Use. Research assistants documented service 
use through monthly client interviews using the Service 
Use and Resource Form (SURF) which documents 
service use from diverse sources of inpatient and outpa-
tient care.25 Antipsychotic medication with daily doses, 
and other psychotropic and nonpsychotropic medication 
use was also documented based on patient self-report 
each month.
Costs. Unit costs of these services were estimated from 
published reports26–29 and administrative data sets from 
Medicaid, MarketScan® (a private sector claims data 
base), the Veterans Health Administration and State 
Mental Hospitals26,29–31 adjusted for inflation to July 2014 
prices using the medical care component of the con-
sumer price index from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics 
(http://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables.htm). Antipsychotic and 
other medication costs were estimated from discounted 
prices from the Federal Supply Schedule Prices for 2014. 
Since on-patent drugs will soon be generic,32 sensitivity 
analyses were also conducted in which drug-costs were 
considered at generic prices.
Costs of training conferences and on-site internal and 
expert external supervision for NAV were calculated from 
study administrative records. Training costs for CC sites 
included attendance at study-related conferences and bi-
weekly routine staff supervision. These CC costs were 
small (6.5% as large as the NAV training and supervi-
sion costs) and were subtracted from estimated costs of 
NAV training to evaluate the incremental cost of train-
ing for NAV as compared to CC. These net training costs 
for NAV were distributed across visits as a proportion of 
direct per capita monthly health care costs per patient.
The unit of analysis for cost-evaluation is the total 
average 6-month health costs per patient ie, average 
monthly costs multiplied by 6 over 4 distinct 6-month 
periods totaling 24 months. Total costs addressed health 
services, medications, plus the marginal cost of training 
staff in the NAV intervention.
Statistical Methods
The initial evaluation of effectiveness on the QLS was the 
mixed model linear regression analysis presented previ-
ously6 that examined average QLS scores over the entire 
24-month trial.
Analyses of service use, cost components and total 
costs compared NAV and CC on average 6-month post-
baseline service use and costs covering all 24 months. 
Six-month costs were examined to correspond to the tim-
ing of clinical assessments. These analysis used a mixed 
model including terms representing treatment group and 
categorical time, and estimated the least square mean 
service use and cost values33,34 by group and the signifi-
cance of treatment differences. Untransformed measures 
provided the best fit. These analyses were conducted 
using 3-level mixed-effects linear regression models for 
repeated measures, which included a random intercept 
at client and site levels. Mixed models allow use of all

available data even when some data from some individu-
als are missing for some time points.
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 
calculated as the difference in average annualized total 
costs divided by the difference in effectiveness (improve-
ment in the QLS from baseline). The uncertainty of dif-
ferences in effectiveness and total cost was estimated 
using bootstrap sampling with replacement.35 For each 
of 5000 bootstrap samples, the differences in least 
square mean of total cost and of effectiveness between 
groups were calculated from mixed models with terms 
representing treatment and time. The ICER was cal-
culated as the average group difference in cost divided 
by the average difference in effectiveness and its 95% 
confidence interval. These data show the proportion of 
observations in each quadrant of the cost-effectiveness 
plane.35
Cost-benefit analysis was conducted using Net Health 
Benefits (NHB).36 This approach assumes that we do 
not know the monetary value of health outcomes like 
the QLS-SD. Instead, a range of estimates for the dollar 
value of one QLS-SD are examined in a sensitivity analy-
sis in which each monetary estimate is multiplied by the 
change from baseline in QLS-SD for each patient at each 
time point. This yields an estimate of the economic value 
of health gains for each observation. Following conven-
tions used in policy making for the value, or willingness 
to pay for a QALY
,37,38 we monetized health status with 
estimates from $0 to $50 000/QLS-SD/year in a sensitiv-
ity analysis. This yielded a monetized estimate of health 
gains for each client at each time point.
Annualized total health care costs (average 6-month 
costs ×2) were then subtracted from these estimated mon-
etary health benefits to generate an estimate of average 
“annualized net health benefit” for each client at each of 
the estimated monetary values of a QLS-SD.
Mixed model regression analyses of the type described 
above were used to compare mean differences between 
the groups using annualized estimates of NHB from all 
4 follow-up time points and adjusting for time and the 
baseline value of the NHB. These 3-level mixed-effects 
linear regression models included a random intercept at 
both client and site levels. To eliminate outliers, NHB 
data were winsorized at the fifth and 95th percentile.
Over the past decade, it has been increasingly recog-
nized that policy makers have to make decisions even 
when findings do not meet the usual 5% standard of 
uncertainty used in scientific research. It is thus impor-
tant to know the probability that one treatment will be 
more cost-effective than another, even when the uncer-
tainty is greater than the conventional 5%.35 Using the 
method of Hoch et al,39 we calculated the probability 
that NAV had greater NHBs than CC at each of the esti-
mated monetary values of the QLS-SD. This calculation 
was based on a 1-tailed test using the P-value associated 
with the coefficient representing treatment group in the 
regression analysis of NHB, computed as 1-p/2.39 These 
analyses allow plotting of a cost-effectiveness acceptabil-
ity curve, which illustrates graphically the probability that 
that NAV was more cost-effective than CC at each esti-
mated monetary value of a QLS-SD.39
Marked differences in the effectiveness of NAV for cli-
ents with high and low duration of untreated psychosis 
(DUP: the time from the onset of symptoms of psychosis 
to the time of first antipsychotic medication treatment)16 
were previously reported for this study.6 Accordingly we 
evaluated the impact of DUP as a moderator of boot-
strapped ICERs and NHB comparisons. The interaction 
of DUP by treatment group was modeled as predicting 
NHB. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves are pre-
sented for low and high DUP.
Finally, equipercentile linking40 of PANSS-based 
QALYs22 and the QLS-SD was used to estimate the num-
ber of QLS-SDs per QALY
. Since there is an extensive 
literature on the economic value of a QALY
, these results 
supported translation of QLS-SD outcomes into QALYs 
and related monetary values.
Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS 
Institute, Inc).
Results
The sample included 223 NAV and 181 CC patients with 
an average age of 23 years, 71.0% lived with families of 
origin, 73.6% had been previously hospitalized and 83.8% 
were taking antipsychotic medications at study entry. 
Average QLS scores were 52.6 (18.8), average PANSS 
scores were 76.6 (14.9), and 90% met criteria for schizo-
phrenia spectrum disorder. Median DUP was 74 weeks. 
More extensive baseline data have been presented previ-
ously (table 1 of Kane et al6).
On the primary outcome measure, the NAV group 
participants experienced significantly greater improve-
ment over the 2-year assessment period than CC (group 
by time interaction, P < .02), with an effect size from 
baseline to final follow-up of 0.31 and 0.24 over the 
entire 2-year period.6 NAV participants also experi-
enced significantly greater improvement on PANSS 
total scores.6
Service Use
There were no significant differences during the 2-year 
follow-up period in inpatient service use, with 14% greater 
mental health or medical surgical days among NAV 
patients (table 1). In contrast, NAV clients received 6.5 
(35%) more mental health outpatient visits per 6-month 
period (P = .05) than CC patients. NAV clients received 
39.6% more clinical visits (eg, with psychiatrists and 
nurses; NS), 61.8% more rehabilitation visits (P < .001), 
and 646% more family treatment visits (P < .001), but 
69% fewer peer support visits (P = .04; table 1).

Cost-Effectiveness of First Episode Psychosis Treatment
Costs
Despite having more days hospitalized, average 
6-month inpatient costs were $86 lower (2.2%, NS) for 
NAV than CC clients (table 2) because of 14.5% lower 
average per diem costs. Total average 6-month outpa-
tient mental health costs were $491 (35.6%, P = .05) 
greater for NAV.
Total medication costs were $665 (51.4%, P = .02) greater 
per 6-month period for NA
V due to $679 greater (64%, 
P = .01) antipsychotic medication costs, reflecting greater use 
of on-patent aripiprazole and second generation long-acting 
injectable antipsychotics. When generic prices were applied 
to all antipsychotic medications, there were no significant

differences in total medication costs, although NA
V antipsy-
chotic costs remained slightly greater by $35 (P = .01).
Total clinical service costs (ie, excluding medications) 
were 7.5% greater for NA
V than CC (P = .79), while this 
cost difference increased to $1113 (P = .44) when medi-
cation costs were included and to $1837 (27.3%, P = .22) 
when the marginal cost of NA
V training (amounting to 9% 
of all health care costs) was added. Although training actu-
ally had no effect at all on CC costs the additional cost for 
NA
V training appears to lower the costs for CC because 
of the statistical modeling of least square means in table 2.
When generic costs for antipsychotic medications were 
applied, total cost differences were reduced by almost 
half to $1069 greater for NAV (P = .53; table 2).
Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratios and Bootstrap 
Analyses
Dividing the aggregate difference in average “annual-
ized” total costs ($3674) by the aggregated benefit of 0.25 
QLS-SDs yields an arithmetic ICER of $14 696/QLS-SD. 
Bootstrap analysis yielded somewhat smaller average costs 
per 6-month period for an ICER of $12 081/QLS-SD 
(figure 1) and with 95% of all observations falling in the 
upper right quadrant of the cost effectiveness plane, rep-
resenting greater benefits and greater costs for NA
V
.
Low and High DUP
In the original QLS analysis, the NA
V-CC effect size gain of 
0.57 among low-DUP patients was substantially higher than 
the .07 observed among high-DUP patients. Among low-
DUP patients (table 3), the NA
V group had “fewer” mental 
health or medical/surgical inpatient days per 6-month period 
and $3778 (56.7%, P = .34) “lower” inpatient costs. In con-
trast, among high-DUP patients, the NA
V group averaged 
“more” inpatient days per 6-month period, and $1820 (63%, 
P = .29) “higher” inpatient costs (table 3).
As a result, among low-DUP patients, NAV total 
costs averaged $1368 per patient per 6 months less than 
CC (14.8%, P = .72), while among high-DUP patients, 
NAV showed increased costs of $3839 (64%, P = .05) per 
patient per 6 months (table 3).
Related bootstrap analyses show an ICER of only 
$1035/QLS-SD among low-DUP patients (figure 2), com-
pared to an ICER of $41 307/QLS-SD among high-DUP 
patients (figure 3), with wide 95% confidence intervals.
Finally, the ICER using generic costs for antipsychotic 
medications (figure 4) was only $6501/QLS-SD, still with 81% 
of observations in the quadrant representing greater costs and 
greater benefits. When calculated with generic antipsychotic 
costs, the ICER among high-DUP clients declined from $41 
307/QLS-SD to $29 516/QLS-SD (figure not shown).
NHB Analysis
There is a .80 probability that NAV is cost-effective in 
comparison with CC if a QLS-SD is valued at $20 000 
(figure 5); a .90 probability if the QLS-SD is valued at $30 
000; and the scientifically normative .95 probability if the 
QLS-SD is valued at $40 000 or more.
Evaluation of the interaction of treatment assign-
ment by DUP in a model of NHB showed a significant 
interaction, even at $0 value of one QLS-SD (t = 2.43, 
P = .016). In the low-DUP sub-group, there is a .83 prob-
ability that NAV is cost-effective in comparison with CC 
if one QLS-SD is valued at only $10 000 (figure 6) and a 
.94 probability if the QLS-SD is valued at only $20 000. 
Among the high-DUP sub-group (figure 7), in contrast, 
there is a less than even probability (.31) that NAV is 
more cost effective than CC if 1 QLS-SD is valued at $20 
000; and only a modestly greater than average probability 
(.64) if a QLS-SD is valued at $50 000.
Conversion to QALYs
A highly significant correlation of 0.36 (P < .0001) was 
found between the QLS and the PANSS-derived measure 
of QALYs. Equipercentile linking of these data shows that 
a one unit change in the QLS-SD represents a 0.14 change 
in QALYs, or, reciprocally, that 7 QLS-SDs = 1 QALY
.
The overall ICER of $12 081/QLS-SD thus equates to 
7 × 12 081 = $84 567 per QALY
, while the low-DUP ICER 
equates to $7245/QALY
, the high-DUP ICER to $289 
149/QALY
, and the generic antipsychotic prices ICER to 
$45 507/QALY
. High-DUP clients evaluated with generic 
drug costs had an ICER of $206 612/QALY
.
Reexamination of the NHB analysis from the QALY 
perspective suggests that there is a .90–.95 probability

that NAV is more cost effective than CC at dollar 
values of $210 000/QALY to $280 000/QALY
. In the 
low-DUP group, there is a .94 probability that NAV 
is more cost-effective than CC at $140 000/QALY, 
although among high-DUP patients there is only a 
.65 probability chance that NAV is more cost-effective 
than CC at $350 000/QALY, all below the upper-range 
estimates of the monetized value of a QALY (see dis-
cussion below).
Discussion
This study used 3 strategies to evaluate the cost-effective-
ness and cost-benefit of NAV in comparison to CC in a

2-year cluster randomized trial. First, mixed linear mod-
els showed greater NAV effectiveness, and greater total 
costs than CC with 26% of the increased costs attribut-
able to increased outpatient service costs, 36% to greater 
medication costs, and 9% to additional training costs. 
There was no significant reduction in inpatient costs 
with NAV, similar to 2 previous RCT cost-effectiveness 
analyses of FEP treatment.12,13 The increase in medica-
tion costs was presumably driven by guidance from the 
COMPASS decision support system that encouraged the 
use of second generation antipsychotics with favorable 
metabolic side effect profiles and also long acting antipsy-
chotic formulations for adherence enhancement, despite 
their greater cost.
The second method, using bootstrap analysis of 
ICERs, confirmed findings of greater benefits and cost 
for NAV
. The greatest cost-effectiveness was observed 
among low-DUP clients and when generic drug prices 
were used (as is likely to be the case in the future)32
The third analytic approach, using NHB, found a .95 
probability that NA
V was more cost-effective than CC if the 
QLS-SD is valued at $40 000. Among the low-DUP samples 
there was a .94 probability that NA
V was more cost-effective 
at only $20 000/QLS-SD, while among the high-DUP patients 
there was a .31 probability at $20 000 and only a .64 probabil-
ity that NA
V was cost-effective compared to CC at $50 000.

Cost-Effectiveness of First Episode Psychosis Treatment
Thus in all 3 analyses, NAV was both more effective 
and more costly than CC, with considerably greater cost-
effectiveness among low-DUP clients than among high-
DUP clients, and when generic drug prices were used for 
antipsychotics.
Monetary Value of Clinical Improvement
The remaining feature of our analysis was a cost-benefit 
analysis based on an estimate of the monetary value of 
one QLS-SD, since the ultimate meaning of both ICER 
and NHB analyses hinges on the estimated willingness-
to-pay for, or dollar value of, a QLS-SD. Using data col-
lected with the algorithm for estimating QALYS from the 
PANSS, we estimated that there are 7 QLS-SDs in one 
QALY
. Using this figure, ICERs for NAV ranged from 
$7245/QALY to $45 507/QALY
, with the exception of the 
high-DUP group, which ranged from $200 000/QALY 
to $300 000/QALY
. NHB analysis, further, suggests that 
there is a 0.90–0.95 likelihood that NAV is more cost 
effective than CC at dollar values of $210 000/QALY to 
$280 000/QALY
.
There is an extensive literature on the monetary value 
of a, QAL
Y37,38,41 which has been estimated to range from 
$50 000 (in 1984 dollars) to $117 000 (in 2014 inflation-
adjusted dollars) to $183 000–$264 000 in a recent analysis 
of expenditures and costs in the US health care system38 
and by some methods to as high as $400 000/QAL
Y
.41 Thus 
ICER and NHB estimates presented here all suggest that 
the value of clinical improvements for NA
V compared to 
CC fall under the published range of estimates for the ceil-
ing value of a QAL
Y although for high-DUP patients this 
is limited to estimates based on generic drug prices.
Two previous cost-benefit analyses of FEP programs 
using the NHB approach12,13 found no statistically signifi-
cant cost savings for FEP early intervention. However, 
they reported greater NHBs for FEP treatment when they 
took the monetary value of clinical improvement into 
consideration in a cost-benefit analysis. Benefits in these 
studies were measured at £1000–£10 000 for “full voca-
tional recovery” in the first case,13 and £2000 per point on 
the 0–100 Global Assessment of Function (GAF) scale in 
the second.12 When these monetized benefits were added 
to inpatient cost savings, the claim for cost-effectiveness 
was strengthened, although the greater cost-benefit for 
FEP treatment still fell short of the .95 probability level. 
However, “full vocational recovery” was not operation-
ally defined and neither study presented a justification for 
the monetary value they assigned to these clinical out-
comes. Claims of cost-effectiveness in these studies thus 
rest on assumptions that are incompletely substantiated.
The multistep estimation method used here provides a 
firmer foundation than had previous been available for 
concluding that the health benefits of NAV exceed their 
costs and thus pass the “cost-benefit” test.
Limitations
Several limitations of this study require comment. First, 
the conditions of a randomized trial like RAISE-ETP 
may not be generalizable to real-world practice since all 
sites that volunteered for RAISE-ETP were capable and 
motivated to successfully implement a comprehensive, 
integrated care FEP program with existing non-research 
sources of funding. As a result, CC sites most likely offered 
a level of FEP care that was superior to usual FEP treat-
ment in the US, thus minimizing observed differences 
between NA
V and usual treatment. In several other RCTs 
of FEP programs,2,4,5,11 rates of hospitalization among 
control groups were 37% to 71% over 12 months, 1.5 to 3.5 
times greater than the 20% seen in the first 12 months for 
CC in this study. This difference suggests that the lack of 
more favorable NA
V-CC differences in inpatient care and 
costs may reflect an exceptionally good performance at 
keeping hospital utilization low at CC sites in this study. If 
CC subjects in the present study had performed similarly

to control groups in previous trials cited above, the differ-
entially greater costs associated with NA
V might have been 
reduced to zero or might even have been reversed to as 
much as $7000 in savings. Generalizability of these results 
is thus uncertain as RAISE-ETC may have artificially 
increased CC effectiveness and reduced CC costs.
Second, our method for determining the number of 
QLS-SDs per QALY
, and hence the monetary value of 
documented clinical outcomes, is novel. Each step in the 
process was based on empirical data, but the validity, 
reliability and generalizability of the methods used, has 
not been replicated. We relied on a broad range of pub-
lished estimates with consistent results favoring NAV
.
Third, we note that inpatient service use is strongly 
influenced by the local supply of inpatient beds and local 
clinical practice patterns.42,43 Treatment-related reduc-
tions in hospital service use and related cost savings are 
limited where the baseline supply and utilization of inpa-
tient services is low to begin with and the RAISE-ETP 
sample averaged only 3 mental health inpatient days per 
client per month. NAV showed lower rates of hospital-
ization at 12 months than other recent demonstrations 
of multimodal FEP treatment (20% for NAV vs 32% for 
the RAISE Connection program and 23% for the STEP 
program),44 reflecting generally low levels of inpatient use 
at both NAV and CC sites.
Fourth, it should be acknowledged that RAISE-ETP, 
with a total sample of 404 participants clustered in 34 
sites, was not adequately powered for cost-effectiveness 
analysis. Since the distribution of cost data was highly 
non-normal, differences in results across our methods of 
analysis are in part attributable to a relative lack of statis-
tical power (as evidenced by the wide confidence intervals 
of the bootstrap analyses), although the overall findings 
are highly consistent.
Finally, we note that although RAISE-ETP has a longer 
duration of follow-up than many previous studies of FEP 
interventions, it cannot speak to the very long-term benefits 
that may accrue over decades in what can be a life long ill-
ness. In addition, the analysis was conducted from the per-
spective of the health care system, and thus did not address 
costs to patients’ families or other social welfare systems.
Conclusion
This study showed that a comprehensive service package 
for FEP can improve quality of life, albeit at increased 
costs. However, the value of the achieved clinical benefit 
appears to justify these additional expenditures, espe-
cially for clients with shorter DUP, and when generic 
prices for antipsychotic medication are applied.
