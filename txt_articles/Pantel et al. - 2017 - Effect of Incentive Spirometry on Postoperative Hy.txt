Effect of Incentive Spirometry on Postoperative Hypoxemia
and Pulmonary Complications After Bariatric Surgery
A Randomized Clinical Trial
Haddon Pantel, MD; John Hwang, MD; David Brams, MD; Thomas Schnelldorfer, MD; Dmitry Nepomnayshy, MD
IMPORTANCE The combination of obesity and foregut surgery puts patients undergoing
bariatric surgery at high risk for postoperative pulmonary complications. Postoperative
incentive spirometry (IS) is a ubiquitous practice; however, little evidence exists on its
effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of postoperative IS on hypoxemia, arterial oxygen
saturation (SaO2) level, and pulmonary complications after bariatric surgery.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized noninferiority clinical trial enrolled
patients undergoing bariatric surgery from May 1, 2015, to June 30, 2016. Patients were
randomized to postoperative IS (control group) or clinical observation (test group) at a
single-center tertiary referral teaching hospital. Analysis was based on the evaluable
population.
INTERVENTIONS The controls received the standard of care with IS use 10 times every hour
while awake. The test group did not receive an IS device or these orders.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was frequency of hypoxemia,
defined as an SaO2 level of less than 92% without supplementation at 6, 12, and 24
postoperative hours. Secondary outcomes were SaO2 levels at these times and the rate of
30-day postoperative pulmonary complications.
RESULTS A total of 224 patients (50 men [22.3%] and 174 women [77.7%]; mean [SD] age,
45.6 [11.8] years) were enrolled, and 112 were randomized for each group. Baseline
characteristics of the groups were similar. No significant differences in frequency of
postoperative hypoxemia between the control and test groups were found at 6 (11.9% vs
10.4%; P = .72), 12 (5.4% vs 8.2%; P = .40), or 24 (3.7% vs 4.6%; P = .73) postoperative
hours. No significant differences were observed in mean (SD) SaO2 level between the control
and test groups at 6 (94.9% [3.2%] vs 94.9% [2.9%]; P = .99), 12 (95.4% [2.2%] vs 95.1%
[2.5%]; P = .40), or 24 (95.7% [2.4%] vs 95.6% [2.4%]; P = .69) postoperative hours. Rates
of 30-day postoperative pulmonary complications did not differ between groups (8 patients
[7.1%] in the control group vs 4 [3.6%] in the test group; P = .24).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Postoperative IS did not demonstrate any effect on
postoperative hypoxemia, SaO2 level, or postoperative pulmonary complications. Based on
these findings, the routine use of IS is not recommended after bariatric surgery in its current
implementation.

A
t present, approximately 13% of the world population
or 600 million adults worldwide are obese.1 This in-
crease in obesity has been accompanied by a concur-
rentincreaseinbariatricsurgery,with468 609casesbeingper-
formed in 2013 alone.2 These morbidly obese patients are at a
higher risk for postoperative pulmonary complications such
as hypoxemia, atelectasis, pneumonia, laryngospasm, respi-
ratory distress, or the potential need for reintubation.3,4
Pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery are a
majorcauseofmorbidityandmortality.Foregutsurgeryinpar-
ticular has high rates of pulmonary complications due to the
close proximity to the diaphragm and the caudal location of
theincisionorportsites.5Laparoscopicforegutoperationsalso
predispose patients to postoperative pulmonary complica-
tions due to altered pulmonary mechanics from pneumoperi-
toneum and patient positioning.6 By definition, bariatric sur-
gery combines the risk factors of morbid obesity and foregut
surgery, putting these patients at increased risk for post-
operative pulmonary complications.
As a means to decrease postoperative pulmonary compli-
cations, Bartlett et al7 first described the incentive spirometry
(IS) device in 1970.7 This device functions by encouraging pa-
tients to achieve maximal inspiration by providing visual feed-
back.Sinceitsintroduction,IShasgainedwidespreaduseinthe
postoperative period for the prophylaxis and treatment of re-
spiratory complications.8,9 At present, postoperative IS is con-
sidered the standard of care and is incorporated into standard-
ized bariatric surgery recovery protocols.10 However, despite
the ubiquitous use of IS in the postoperative period, data on its
efficacy is conflicting, and high-quality evidence is lacking.5,11
The intrinsic combination of morbid obesity and laparo-
scopic foregut surgery puts patients undergoing bariatric
surgery at higher risk for postoperative pulmonary complica-
tions. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of
postoperative IS on the clinical, relevant pulmonary outcome
measureofpostoperativehypoxemia.Secondaryoutcomemea-
sures of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) and 30-day postop-
erative pulmonary complications after bariatric surgery were
also analyzed. We hypothesized that postoperative IS would
have no effect on any of these outcomes. To answer this ques-
tion, we conducted a randomized noninferiority clinical trial
examining the effect of postoperative IS on these outcomes.
Methods
Study Design
This study was a single-center randomized clinical trial. All re-
search and clinical care were performed at Lahey Hospital and
MedicalCenter,Burlington,Massachusetts.TheSurgicalWeight
Loss Center at Lahey Hospital is an American College of Sur-
geonsBariatricSurgeryCenterNetwork–accreditedprogramthat
performs approximately 300 bariatric operations a year, with
a bariatric surgery fellow or a general surgery resident assist-
ing.Beforethestartoftheproject,theinstitutionalreviewboard

provided written informed consent.
This study enrolled all consenting patients who under-
went laparoscopic bariatric surgery from May 1, 2015, to June
30, 2016. No exclusion criteria other than failure to obtain con-
sent were applied. We used a simple randomization scheme
for group allocation. Before the start of the study, a computer-
randomized list of group assignments was generated. After
completion of the consent process, patients were random-

Key Points
Question What is the effect of postoperative incentive spirometry
on hypoxemia, oxygen saturation, and pulmonary complications
after bariatric surgery?
Findings In this randomized noninferiority clinical trial of 224
patients undergoing bariatric surgery, no significant difference in
the frequency of postoperative hypoxemia was found between
patients who used incentive spirometry after surgery and those
who did not. In addition, oxygen saturation levels and 30-day
postoperative pulmonary complication rates did not differ
between groups.
Meaning In its current implementation, use of postoperative
incentive spirometry after bariatric surgery does not appear to
decrease hypoxemia or postoperative pulmonary complications.

Intervention and Control
Patients randomized to the control group received the cur-
rent standard of care at our institution for postoperative use
of IS. A postoperative nursing order was implemented to pro-
vide the patients with an IS device when the patient
was “awake and alert” and for the patient to use the IS device
“10 times every hour while awake.” In addition, preoperative
teaching and postoperative coaching and prompting were per-
formed by the nursing staff. Patients randomized to the test
group were not provided with an IS device (Figure).
All patients received deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis
with 5000 U of subcutaneous heparin sodium in the preop-
erative period. The anesthetic regimen was left to the dis-
cretion of the anesthesia team. Postoperatively, a standard-
ized analgesia regimen was implemented, and no patient
had epidural anesthesia. In addition to this analgesia proto-
col, a standardized recovery pathway of ambulation 3 times
daily, diet advancement, and fluid management was imple-
mented for both groups.
IS Use
To evaluate the frequency of IS use in the control group, a
pilot study was conducted for 1 month before the start of
this trial. Patients undergoing bariatric surgery received the
same IS protocol used in the control group to record their
device use. At the time of discharge, these logs were col-
lected and analyzed.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure of this study was the fre-
quency of postoperative hypoxemia at 6, 12, and 24 postop-
erative hours. Hypoxemia was defined as an SaO2 level of less
than 92%. Because no strict definition of hypoxemia exists
based on oxygen saturation, with a mean pulse oximeter pre-
cision of 2%12 and less than 90% often used to represent hy-
poxemiainvariousstudies,13avalueoflessthan92%wasused.
Pulse oximetry measurements as opposed to arterial blood gas
values were used because they were readily available, less
costly, and less invasive. Data points needed to be measured
within 1 hour before or after the determined time to be in-
cluded. All SaO2 levels were measured with patients discon-
tinuing any supplemental oxygen therapy or positive airway
pressure ventilation for 5 minutes and while sitting up with
the head of their bed at more than 45°. This interval without
supplementationwasbasedonSaO2withoutsupplementaloxy-
genreachingequilibrationat4.5minutes14and95%ofchanges
in SaO2 measurement to decreases in inspired oxygen occur-
ring within 5 minutes.15 In addition, the interval when a de-
crease in positive pressure ventilation results in an SaO2 reach-
ing equilibrium is about 5 minutes.16
The secondary outcome measure of SaO2 as a continuous
quantitative variable was examined from the values recorded
in the above method. The secondary outcome measure of
30-day postoperative complications was defined as atelecta-
sis, pneumonia, or the need for intubation. Atelectasis was de-
fined as any radiology report mentioning pulmonary atelec-
tatic changes regardless of clinical manifestations. Pneumonia
wasdefinedasradiographicorclinicaldocumentationofpneu-
monia. Incidence of reintubation was obtained through the
retrospective review of medical records.
Statistical Analysis
Before the start of the study, a noninferiority power calcula-
tion was performed to determine sample size. Review of the
literature showed a 10% baseline proportion of patients after
bariatric surgery with SaO2 levels less than 92%.17-19 A mini-
mum of 112 patients per group provided a power of more
than an 80% (β = 0.20) chance of rejecting a false null
hypothesis. This level was based on detection of a clinically
significant Δ statistic of 10% between groups with an
expected SD of pulse oximetry values of 2%.12,20 We used
2-tailed paired t tests and χ2 tests to compare means of con-
tinuous variables and distributions of binary variables
between both groups, respectively. We used Fisher exact
tests to compare categorical variables between both groups.
P < .05 was considered statistically significant.
Generalized linear models were used to evaluate out-
comes over time with adjustment for multiple measures on
each patient. A generalized linear mixed model with main
effects for treatment and time (6, 12, and 24 hours) and the
2-factor interaction was used to evaluate the effect of IS use
on postoperative hypoxemia. Because hypoxemia status
was binary, the model assumed a binomial distribution for
the outcome. The model adjusted for repeated measures
over time on each person and used an autoregressive covari-
ance structure.
We used a multivariable logistic regression model with a
stepwise selection process to choose among candidate pre-
dictor variables that had unadjusted P < .15 for the outcome
of any postoperative hypoxemia. This model included no IS
as a candidate variable. The candidate variables included
age, body mass index, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease (COPD), baseline SaO2 level, and no use of IS.
For the variable selection process, limits were set to allow
variables with adjusted P = .10 to enter and stay in the
model. Power analysis and statistical analysis were per-
formed by a blinded data assessor from the Tufts University
Clinical and Translational Science Institute. All analyses
were performed using SAS for Windows (version 9.4; SAS
Institute Inc).
Results
Study Population
From May 1, 2015, to June 30, 2016, a total of 284 patients
underwent laparoscopic bariatric surgery at our center. Of
those, 224 (78.9%) provided informed consent and were
enrolled (50 men [22.3%] and 174 women [77.7%]; mean
[SD] age, 45.6 [11.8] years) (Figure). A total of 112 patients
were randomized to the control group and 112 were random-
ized to the test group. Baseline characteristics of each group
were similar, with no statistically significant differences in
their demographics (Figure). The control group was noted
to have more patients with COPD when compared with the
test group (5 patients [4.5%] vs 0; P = .02). For all other

preexisting pulmonary conditions, American Society of
Anesthesiologists class, preoperative SaO2 level, operation
types, and mean operative times, no differences were
observed between groups (Table 1).
IS Use
During the pilot study, a total of 16 patients underwent bar-
iatric surgery. Of those 16 patients, log sheets on IS use were
collected from 12. On postoperative day 1, the mean fre-
quency of IS use was 4.1 times per day. On postoperative
day 2, mean frequency of IS use was 10.4 times per day.
Postoperative Hypoxemia
We found no statistically significant differences in frequency
of hypoxemia observed between groups for all points among
patients with available measurements (Table 2). At 6 postop-
erative hours, 13 of 109 patients (11.9%) in the control group
were hypoxemic compared with 11 of 106 patients (10.4%) in
the test group (P = .72). At 12 postoperative hours, 6 of 112 pa-
tients (5.4%) in the control group were hypoxemic compared
with 9 of 110 patients (8.2%) in the test group (P = .40). At 24
postoperative hours, 4 of 108 patients (3.7%) in the control
group were hypoxemic compared with 5 of 108 patients (4.6%)
in the test group (P = .73).
Postoperative SaO2 Level
We observed no statistically significant differences in mean
SaO2 levels between groups for all times (Table 2). At 6 post-
operative hours, patients in the control group had a mean
(SD) SaO2 level of 94.9% (3.2%) compared with a mean of
94.9% (2.9%) for patients in the test group (P = .99). At 12
postoperative hours, patients in the control group had a
mean (SD) SaO2 level of 95.4% (2.2%) compared with a
mean of 95.1% (2.5%) for patients in the test group (P = .40).

At 24 postoperative hours, patients in the control group had
a mean (SD) SaO2 level of 95.7% (2.4%) compared with
95.6% (2.4%) for patients in the test group (P = .69).
Postoperative Pulmonary Complications
We observed no differences between the rates of 30-day post-
operative pulmonary complications between groups (Table 3).
Eight of 112 patients (7.1%) in the control group had post-
operativepulmonarycomplications,including7occurrencesof
atelectasis (6.%), 1 of pneumonia (0.9%), and no reintuba-
tions. For the test group, 4 of 112 patients (3.6%) had postop-
erative pulmonary complications, all consisting of atelectasis
(P = .24 for the difference between groups).
Univariate and Multivariate Logistic Regression Models
We found no significant interaction of treatment and time
(P = .41), with no significant variation between the different
evaluation points. We found no significant difference in hypo-
xemia between the control and test groups (P = .49; adjusted
mean hypoxemia with or without IS, 5.8% vs 7.6%).
Forthemultivariatelogisticregressionmodelwhenthevari-
able selection process was run, the only variable that reached
significance was baseline SaO2 level. A single patient was hy-
poxemic preoperatively and hypoxemic at 6 and 24 postopera-
tive hours. Using the unadjusted logistic regression model for
each potential predictor variable, preoperative hypoxemia had
a 100% specificity for postoperative hypoxemia based on this
singlepatient.However,aftercontrollingforthisvariable,none
oftheothervariableshadadjustedsignificantassociationswith
hypoxemia with the outcome at the level of P < .10.
Discussion
We present findings from, to our knowledge, the first reported
randomizedclinicaltrialtoevaluatetheeffectofISuseafterbar-
iatric surgery. We found no significant difference in the fre-
quency of postoperative hypoxemia among patients using an
ISdeviceaftersurgerycomparedwiththosewhodidnot.Inad-
dition, we did not observe a difference in SaO2 level or the rate
of30-daypostoperativepulmonarycomplicationsbetweenpa-
tientsusinganISdeviceaftersurgerycomparedwiththosewho
did not. These findings support our null hypothesis that post-
operative IS use has no significant effect on hypoxemia or
SaO2 after bariatric surgery. Based on these findings, we do not
recommend the routine use of IS in its current implementa-
tion after bariatric surgery. In addition, we question its routine
use for other laparoscopic foregut procedures.
Thesefindingsareconsistentwiththecurrentpublishedlit-
erature on IS use postoperatively. A 2007 Cochrane review of
randomizedclinicaltrialsofISinadultpatientsundergoingup-
perabdominalsurgery11foundthatparticipantsreceivingIShad
the same rates of clinical or pulmonary complications as those
whodidnot.Inbariatricsurgeryspecifically,preoperativeISuse
has been shown to have no effect on postoperative lung
function.21 Despite the lack of evidence, use of IS is a common
practice.8-10 At our institution, $33 491 was spent on purchas-
ingthesedevicesinthe2013-2014fiscalyear.Inasettingwhere
resourcesarelimitedorarebeingconserved,ISusehasnotbeen
showntobeeffective.22Also,timeisspentbyhealthcarework-
ers in teaching, encouraging, and educating about these de-
vices with little proven benefit. In addition to the time and
monetary costs, these disposable devices go against many ini-
tiatives to reduce the amount of the environmental effect of
health care.
By definition, bariatric operations combine the risk factors
for postoperative complications of obesity3,4 and foregut
surgery.5,6 This innate combination puts these patients at in-
creased risk for postoperative pulmonary complications and
hypothetically would make them ideal candidates for postop-
erative IS benefit. If no benefit is seen in this high-risk popula-
tion, we postulate that the use of IS postoperatively in its cur-
rent form for similar- or lower-risk operations would be of no
benefit.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. Although postoperative hy-
poxemia and SaO2 level are both meaningful clinical mea-
sures, postoperative pulmonary complications are of more
clinical significance. However, pulmonary complications af-
ter bariatric surgery are very rare, with the American College
of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project re-
porting a 0.2% pneumonia rate, 0.2% reintubation rate, and
0.1% requiring ventilation for more than 48 hours in 2014.23
Owing to the infrequency of these complications, this study
was not powered to detect this difference; to power a study
with postoperative pulmonary complications as a primary out-
come, a very large sample size would be needed. Therefore,
we opted to use hypoxemia as our primary outcome mea-
sure. At our institution, patients with SaO2 levels less than 92%
receive supplemental oxygen therapy, thus making this out-
come measure of clinical significance.

Another limitation is that patients with COPD were not
stratified during randomization. As such, significantly more
patients with COPD were in the control group (5 of 112) com-
pared with the test group (0 of 112). Analysis of these patients
with COPD revealed more frequent hypoxemia and lower SaO2
levels but without any 30-day postoperative pulmonary
complications. However, when these patients were excluded
from analysis, we found no significant difference between
groups in any outcome measures. In addition, a multivariate
logistic regression model did not identify COPD as having a sig-
nificant association with hypoxemia. Thus, COPD is unlikely
to have acted as a confounding variable; however, because few
patients with COPD were enrolled, extrapolation of our re-
sults to patients with COPD is limited.
For patients in the control group, adherence to IS use was
lower than protocol determined. The control group was or-
dered to use the IS device 10 times per hour based on our pre-
existing institutional policy. However, observed compliance
was much lower, with a mean of 4.1 times per day on the first
postoperative day and a mean of 10.4 times per day on the sec-
ond day. This rate of adherence would appear to be poor; how-
ever, a standardized and evidence-based frequency of IS use
is not defined.11 This lack of definition may have been attrib-
utable to a combination of factors, including variable length
of hours in the first postoperative day because some opera-
tions were finished later in the day. Also, patients slept more
on the first postoperative day; thus, IS was not used as fre-
quently. For the purposes of this study, a frequency of 10 times
per hour was used because this was a preexisting protocol at
our institution, and our nurses were familiar with these in-
structions. This protocol was continued for the control group.
However, review of the literature reveals a wide range of re-
ported values from 4 times per day24 to every 6 minutes while
awake or 10 times per hour.25 Although controls used IS less
frequently than instructed by protocol, they still fell within the
reported range of use and still represent an adequate control
group for device use. However, the results of this study may
be a consequence of that low adherence rate in the control
group, with the possibility of increased adherence altering the
results. Even in this study with structured teaching, adher-
ence was difficult. This low rate of compliance may reflect a
more universal problem with IS and may contribute to its lack
of effectiveness.
The secondary outcome of 30-day postoperative pulmo-
nary complications may have been confounded by patients
seeking care at other facilities. After discharge, appoint-
ments are scheduled at 1 and 2 weeks from discharge; in our
centers,annualratesof30-dayfollow-uptrackedbytheAmeri-
can Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery is more than
90%. We have no way of determining whether some patients
presented to another facility with pulmonary complications,
but we believe this occurrence to be a low number.

Invited Commentary
Incentive Spirometry After Bariatric Surgery
Yes or No?
Julie Ann Wesp, MD; Meredith C. Duke, MD; Timothy M. Farrell, MD
Since the 1950s, deep breathing exercises have been thought
to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications after ab-
dominal operations. The incentive spirometer was designed
in the 1970s to assist patients in performing appropriate deep
breathing through visual feedback.1
Incentive spirometry (IS) is used commonly after surgical
procedures.2 However, previous meta-analyses in 19943 and
20014 and a Cochrane review in 20145 did not find a benefit
to IS in preventing postopera-
tive pulmonary complica-
tions. Still, IS is believed to be
the standard of care and is included in emerging enhanced re-
covery pathways for bariatric surgery.6
It is timely that, in this issue of JAMA Surgery, Pantel and
colleagues7reporttheirrandomizedclinicalstudytoassessthe
effect of IS on patients undergoing bariatric surgery. They ran-
domizedpostoperativepatientstouseornonuseofISandfound
nodifferenceintheoccurrenceofpostoperativehypoxemia(ar-
terial oxygen saturation level of <92%) at 6, 12, and 24 postop-
erative hours or the rate of 30-day postoperative pulmonary
complications. They cite the annual cost of incentive spirom-
eters was $33 491 at their institution and make an argument
againsttheroutineuseinpatientsundergoingbariatricsurgery.
Proponents of IS might point out that the results are not
translatable to patients undergoing open bariatric procedures
or that the study is not sufficiently powered to detect differ-
encesinpostoperativepulmonarycomplications.Werealarger
studyperformed,evenasmallreductioninpostoperativepneu-
monia would negate the cost containment logic. However, the
more compelling data for continuing routine IS may be found
by a quick internet search using keywords lawsuit and incen-
tive spirometry.
