A significant proportion of all deaths globally can be attributed to alcohol consumption.
Although a range of correlates of alcohol consumption have already been identified at
the individual level, less is understood about correlates at the macro level, such as
cultural values. As a development in this understanding may prove useful for global
health organizations aiming to tackle the problems associated with excessive drinking,
our aim was to investigate the association between encultured alcohol consumption and
Cultural Value Orientations. We obtained data describing average alcohol consumption
and Cultural Value Orientations, for 74 countries, from an online data repository. To
assess whether Cultural Value Orientations are associated with alcohol consumption
we calculated partial correlations and performed a ridge regression analysis. Our
analyses revealed that Cultural Value Orientations were significantly associated with
alcohol consumption, even after controlling for average income and education level.
A profile emerged in which values of autonomy and harmony were shown to be
positively associated with alcohol consumption, and hierarchy and embeddedness
negatively associated with alcohol consumption. The effect was modified by gender.
Changes in cultural Harmony, Mastery, Autonomy and Egalitarianism were associated
with increases in alcohol consumption in males, but not females, while changes in
cultural Embeddedness and Hierarchy were associated with decreases in consumption
in females, but no change in males. Finally, we demonstrate that latitude, and by
extension its covariates such as climatic demands, partially accounted for the effect of
harmony and affective autonomy on alcohol consumption. This research highlights that
cultural values, and their interaction with gender, should be an important consideration
for international public health organizations aiming to tackle the problems associated
with alcohol consumption, but that future research is required to fully understand the
link between cultural values and alcohol.

INTRODUCTION
Alcohol consumption is known to have a range of negative consequences at the individual and
societal levels. In 2012, alcohol consumption was estimated to have caused 3.3 million deaths
globally, a figure that corresponds to 5.9% of all deaths that year (World Health Organization
[WHO], 2014a). It is strongly associated with hypertension, liver cirrhosis, and chronic pancreatitis

Cultural Values and Alcohol
(Corrao et al., 2004), and causes an economic burden of around
1% on Gross Domestic Product (Sassi, 2015). An effective attempt
to prevent and reduce harmful alcohol consumption requires
an understanding of the complex network of risk factors that
cause it (Miranda et al., 2008). Since many of these risk factors
are likely to be affected by cultural factors (e.g., Neumark et al.,
2003; Chartier et al., 2013), or to be at the cultural level, a better
understanding of this complexity necessitates an examination of
their socio-cultural underpinnings.
Past research has identified a range of correlates and predictors
of alcohol consumption including attitudes, subjective norms,
and self-efficacy (Cooke et al., 2016), marital and employment
status (Temple et al., 1991), and various demographic factors
(Moore et al., 2005). In general, most conducted studies
have focused on correlates and predictors uniquely at the
individual level. Shifting this focus to examining predictors at
a macro level (country, regional or cultural; Bronfenbrenner,
1974) should help facilitate an understanding of the overall
pattern of correlates and predictors of alcohol consumption and
potentially aid in the development of large scale interventions
led by international organizations such as the World Health
Organization [WHO] (2014a). In other words, the effectiveness
of an intervention targeting harmful alcohol consumption
may be improved with a better understanding of the cultural
factors that are associated with this risky behavior. One such
country-level factor is cultural values – the degree to which
members of a cultural group value autonomy/individualism vs.
embeddedness/collectivism, for example. Past research, which
has shown differences in alcohol consumption based on within-
country cultural differences, has highlighted the need for more
research into cultural risk-factors (Chartier et al., 2013). However,
to the best of our knowledge, the associations between cultural
values and alcohol consumption have not been systematically
investigated.
The theoretical model we focus on in this study is Schwartz’
s
model of Cultural Value Orientation (Schwartz, 2006), which
is derived from his prior theory of human values (Schwartz,
1992) and related to other influential models of cultural values
such as Hofstede’
s (1980) cultural dimensions and Inglehart
(1977) modernization theory (e.g., Dobewall and Rudnev, 2014).
Schwartz posits seven a priori cultural value orientations that
correspond to cultural ideals, which are shared conceptions of
good and desirable cultural standards (Schwartz, 2006, p. 139).
The seven cultural value orientations are Intellectual Autonomy
(being independent), Affective Autonomy (pursuing positive
affective experiences), Mastery (encouraging self-assertion),
Hierarchy (unequal distribution of power), Embeddedness (being
part of a collective), Harmony (being at ease with the world), and
Egalitarianism (being concerned for others). The seven cultural
value orientations can be ordered along three dimensions:
Embeddedness vs. Autonomy, Hierarchy vs. Egalitarianism, and
Mastery vs. Harmony (see Figure 1). A crucial aspect of this
model is that the cultural value orientations are ordered in
a systematic way according to their motivational synergies
and conflicts. Schwartz (1992, 2006) proposed a circumplex
arrangement, making specific predictions about the pattern of
relations between values. Specifically, the motivational synergies
and conflicts in the model predict that the importance ratings of
adjacent cultural value orientations are positively correlated with
each other, orthogonal cultural value orientations are relatively
weakly or unrelated to each other, and opposing cultural value
orientations are negatively correlated. For example, if a variable
(e.g., alcohol consumption) is positively related with Intellectual
Autonomy, this variable is also expected to be positively related
to Egalitarianism and Affective Autonomy, but negatively related
with Embeddedness.
Several studies have found positive associations between
Autonomy and a wide range of country-level variables which
are usually considered as beneficial to society. These include
peacefulness (Basabe and Valencia, 2007), domestic product
per capita, democratization, gender equality (Schwartz, 2006),
and well-being (Diener et al., 1995). In line with predictions
made by Schwartz, the same variables were negatively related to
Embeddedness. However, high levels of Autonomy also result
in less commitment to norms and traditions (Schwartz, 2006).
These findings allow us to derive specific hypotheses regarding
the relations between Autonomy and Embeddedness with alcohol
consumption.
Alcohol consumption is often associated with socially
undesirable behaviors and health problems (World Health
Organization [WHO], 2014a), both of which are threatening
to the collective and tradition. Further, many religions that
totally forbid alcohol consumption, such as Islam, promote
cultural embeddedness (Schwartz, 2009). It therefore seems
reasonable to believe that alcohol consumption would be
negatively associated with embeddedness and related values
(respect for tradition, obedience, social order), and because of the
underlying motivational continuum of Schwartz’
s (2006) cultural
value orientations, positively related to Autonomy.
Additionally, the rights of women in many countries are
more limited than the rights of men, a case which is especially
true in countries with lower Intellectual Autonomy (Schwartz,
2006). Many cultures and societies also hold negative attitudes
toward women drinking alcohol, but accept this behavior in
men (Pretorious et al., 2009). We were therefore also interested
in assessing whether there were differences in the alcohol
consumption of males and females based on cultural values.
With the above considered, the aim of our study was to
investigate the relationship between cultural value orientations,
especially
Autonomy
and
Embeddedness,
and
alcohol
consumption. Based on previous findings (Martin and Sher, 1994;
Perkins, 2002) we expected Autonomy to be positively associated
with alcohol consumption, and Embeddedness to be negatively
related with alcohol consumption. Because of the circumplex
structure of Schwartz’
s CVO-model, we also expected positive,
albeit weaker, correlations between Egalitarianism and alcohol
consumption and also negative associations with Hierarchy,
because Egalitarianism and Hierarchy are motivationally similar
to Autonomy and Embeddedness, respectively (Schwartz, 2006).
Finally, beyond simply understanding whether Cultural
Values Orientations and encultured alcohol consumption share
an association, we were also interested in understanding whether
any observed association might be explained by ecological
variables that covary with a country’
s geographical position.

Cultural Values and Alcohol
FIGURE 1 | Schwartz’ cultural value orientation model.
The prevalence of non-zoonotic parasitic diseases such as cholera,
which are more highly present in southern countries compared to
northern countries, have been found to be positively associated
with collectivist cultural values and negatively correlated with
democracy and human freedom (Thornhill et al., 2010). Climate
(temperate vs. demanding) has also been shown to be a critical
predictor of a range of cultural variables, such as freedoms of
press and freedom of discrimination. Van de Vliert (2013), for
example, demonstrated that freedom of expression was worse in
poor countries with demanding climate, best in rich countries
with a demanding climate, and intermediate in countries with
temperate climates.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources
The values we used for cultural value orientations were those
obtained by Schwartz between 1988 and 2000 (please refer
to Schwartz, 2006, for full details). Specifically, we used the
country averages of all seven cultural value orientations which
Schwartz (2008) made openly available. Where cultural value
orientations were presented for different cultural groups within
a single country (e.g., East and West Germany), these values
were averaged. To be clear, what this means is that for the sake
of this article a culture refers to the average culture measured
within a nation. Naturally, within a nation there are usually many
different cultural groups, but we shall consider a nation/country
as a single cultural unit. In total, the cultural value orientations
for 74 nations were included in the analyses.
We obtained our estimates of total alcohol consumption per
capita (15+ years; liters of pure alcohol per year) for these
countries from the World Health Organization, Global Health
Observatory data repository, which is available online (World
Health Organization [WHO], 2017). A 3-year average value is
available for males and females separately for the period 2008–
2010. Year specific values are available for all years for the
total adult population. We also included estimates for Income
(Gross National Income per capita, based on purchasing power
parity; data are in current international dollars based on the
2011 ICP round) and for Education (average years of education
by people ages 25 and older) to act as control variables. The

Cultural Values and Alcohol
decision to control for these two variables was empirically driven
because they have been found to be associated with alcohol
consumption (Grittner et al., 2013; Barr et al., 2016). These
values are available for individual years and were extracted
from the World Bank Open Data set (The World Bank Group
[WBG], 2016) and Human Development Index Data set (United
Nations Developmental Programme, 2014), respectively. The
average country latitudes were obtained from a public data set
which can be retried at https://developers.google.com/public-
data/docs/canonical/countries_csv.
Statistical Analysis
Prior to analysis missing data were imputed using Multiple
Imputation by Chained Equations (Raghunathan et al., 2001).
We then evaluated the relationship between cultural value
orientations and alcohol consumption in four stages:
First we conducted partial correlations between cultural
value orientations and alcohol consumption for males, females,
and total population (2008–
2010 period) controlling for the
effect of the mean Income and Education for these years. For
significance tests, we applied a Holm�s adjustment to correct for
multiple comparisons. We interpret the effect size of correlation
coefficients using the guidelines described by Cohen (1988).
Secondly, in line with what might be expected from
a
circumplex
model,
VIF
analyses
revealed
significant
multicollinearity
between
cultural
value
orientations.
We
therefore used linear ridge regression, a technique that uses a
shrinkage constant (k) to make regression coefficients more
stable in the case of multicollinearity (Ryan, 2008), to determine
the amount of unique variance in alcohol consumption that can
be accounted for by cultural value orientations. One effect of
adding a shrinkage parameter to regression equations is that
the estimates of effect size are conservative (Draper and Smith,
1988). We included the same variables in the model as we did
in the partial correlations with the addition of the dummy
variable Gender and seven Gender-by- cultural value orientation
interaction terms.
To assess the sensitivity of our findings we conducted
two further sets of partial correlations. Partial correlations
were calculated for alcohol consumption and cultural value
orientations for three time periods (1990, 2000, and 2010).
The effects of Income and Education for the corresponding
years were controlled for. Partial correlations for males, females
and total sample (once more for the period 2008–
2010) were
then calculated, but for two subsamples, one containing only
European countries (n = 35), the other containing the remainder
non-European countries (n = 39). The effects of mean Income
and Education for the corresponding years, and corresponding
countries, were controlled for.
As will become apparent, our results revealed that Cultural
Value Orientations were associated with alcohol consumption
across the 74 nations. Our final stage of analysis was an
assessment of whether latitude – and by extension a range of
ecological factors that have been shown to covary with latitude –
might account for the variance between values and alcohol
consumption. To do this, 14 statistical mediation analyses were
conducted following the proposals of Baron and Kenny (1986).
For each analysis, the effect of a Cultural Value Orientation on
alcohol consumption (male or female) via the mediating effect
of latitude was assessed using a series of regression analyses.
To conclude that a latitude is a mediator, the effect between
the cultural value and latitude must be significant (path a);
the effect between latitude and alcohol consumption must be
significant (path b); the total effect of the cultural value on alcohol
consumption must be significant (path c); and the effect of the
cultural value on alcohol consumption after adjusting for the
mediator (path c�) should be smaller than that for path c. We
assessed any indirect effects via an inspection of bootstrapped
confidence intervals.
RESULTS
Descriptive Statistics
Based on World Health Organization defined geographical
regions our sample comprised 9 countries from Africa, 12 from
the Americas, 4 from the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 35
from Europe, 5 from the South East Asia Region and 9 from
the Western Pacific Region. The average Income (GNI) for the
period 2008–
2010 was $1.08 trillion. For the same years, the mean
years of schooling (Education) for countries in our sample was
9.41 years (Range: 2.23 –12.90). In total, males were shown to
consume more liters of pure alcohol per year (M = 12.97, Range:
0.40 –23.90) than women (M = 4.32, Range: 0.00 –7.80). In terms
of cultural value orientations, Egalitarianism was the most highly
valued across all countries (M = 4.68) while Hierarchy was the
least (M = 2.35).
Partial Correlations
Table 1 presents the partial correlations between cultural value
orientations and estimates of alcohol consumption for males and
females. Inspection of these profiles reveals a similar general
pattern for males and females, although some striking differences
are evident.
For males there was a significant positive correlation between
Harmony and alcohol consumption, and a significant negative
correlation between Embeddedness and alcohol consumption.
There were weak, and not significant, positive correlations
between alcohol consumption and the values of Autonomy.
There were also weak negative correlations between Hierarchy,
Mastery and Egalitarianism, and alcohol consumption, but none
of these were significant.
For females it is evident that the overall pattern of associations
was stronger than for males. There were medium-sized,
significant positive correlations between Autonomy (Intellectual
and
Affective)
and
Harmony
with
alcohol
consumption,
and medium-sized, significant negative correlations between
Embeddedness
and
Hierarchy
with
alcohol
consumption.
Egalitarianism and Mastery were not significantly correlated
with alcohol consumption for females.

Figure 2 shows the significant gender-by-cultural value
interactions plotted on an axis representing standardized alcohol
consumption. What these plots therefore show is that when
all else is equal, for countries low in all seven values males
consume roughly the average level of alcohol for males, and
females consume roughly the average levels of alcohol for
females. The interactions were apparent when observing gender
differences in countries with high levels of each value. For
Harmony, Mastery, and Affective and Intellectual Autonomy, in
countries with high levels of these values females drank around
the average level of alcohol for females (although there was a
small increase in consumption), but males drank roughly 0.25
standard deviations more than the mean per year. In contrast,
for Embeddedness and Hierarchy, when all else was held equal,
males drank similar levels of alcohol in countries with low and
high levels of these values, but females drank less alcohol in
countries with high levels of these values. For Egalitarianism,
compared to countries with low levels of this value, males
drank more alcohol in countries with high Egalitarianism,
and females drank slightly less alcohol in countries with high
Egalitarianism.

three time points were similar, although over time the strength
of associations was weakening. Furthermore, these patterns are
consistent with the overall pattern of associations shown in
Table 1.
Table 4 presents Pearson correlations for males and females
(2008–
2010 values) for two subsets; 35 European nations and
39 non-European nations. The general pattern of associations
between alcohol consumption and cultural values was similar
between the subsamples, and to the results presented in Table 1.
This was particularly the case for Harmony (medium positive),
Embeddedness (medium negative), Mastery (negligible) and
Affective Autonomy (weak positive). For Hierarchy, European
countries showed a weaker negative correlation (r = −0.07)
compared to non-European countries (r
= −0.23). For
Intellectual Autonomy, European countries showed a stronger,
but still weak, positive correlation (r = 0.16) than non-European
countries (r = 0.08), and for Egalitarianism European countries
had a medium positive correlation (r = 0.30), while non-
European countries showed little evidence of any association
(r = 0.02).
Some clear differences were observed when inspecting
consumption for males and females separately. Firstly, while
males in the European subsample had similar correlations
to those shown in Table 1, males in the non-European
subsample showed very little association between alcohol
consumption and the cultural values. The exception was for
Egalitarianism, which showed a moderate negative correlation
(r = −0.42) which differed from the European subsample,
where
males
showed
a
positive
correlation
(r
=
0.28).
For females the correlations were remarkably similar for
European and non-European subsamples, although an exception
was
Egalitarianism,
which
showed
little
association
with
alcohol consumption in non-European countries (r = 0.04),
but a medium positive correlation in European countries
(r = 0.37).
Latitude as a Mediator of the
Relationship between Cultural Value
Orientations and Alcohol Consumption
As a primary step to understanding the relationship between
latitude and alcohol consumption, Pearson’
s correlations were
calculated between latitude and male and female alcohol
consumption. Significant positive correlations were found for
male, r = 0.35, p = 0.002, and female alcohol consumption,
r = 0.37, p = 0.001. Thus there appears to be evidence of a
north–
south consumption gradient.
The complete output from the 14 statistical mediation analyses
are presented in Supplementary Tables S1–
S7. Mastery and
Egalitarianism did not present all the significant effects, as
defined by Baron and Kenny (1986), for the effect of these
values on alcohol consumption to be mediated by latitude. In
all cases, the Sobel test did not indicate a significant statistical
mediation effect. However, for Harmony (c�male = 0.095, [CI
0.022, 0.217]; c�female = 0.081, CI [0.011, 0.200]), Hierarchy in
males (c�male = −0.094, [CI −0.216, −0.011]), and Affective
Autonomy (c�male = 0.077, [CI 0.006, 0.213]; c�female = 0.066,
CI [0.001, 0.192]), and inspection of the 95% confidence

on alcohol consumption. Embeddedness (c�male = −0.072, [CI

DISCUSSION
Our analyses demonstrate that there is a pattern with which
cultural
value
orientations
are
associated
with
alcohol
consumption. There was a clear association between the
Autonomy vs. Embeddedness value dimension and levels of
consumption. For males and females, countries which highly
valued Intellectual and Affective Autonomy (Germany and the
United Kingdom for example) were generally associated with
higher levels of consumption, and countries which highly valued
Embeddedness (such as Yemen and Senegal) were generally
associated with lower levels of consumption. This pattern of
associations was found to be robust over three time points,
and reasonably similar across subsamples of European and
non-European nations. These data therefore suggest that certain
cultural characteristics are associated with a propensity for
higher cultural alcohol consumption, a behavior associated at the
individual level with hypertension, liver cirrhosis, and chronic
pancreatitis (Corrao et al., 2004) and considered as a modifiable
behavioral risk factor for non-communicable diseases (NCDs)
including cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory
disease and diabetes, and at a societal level a causes of social and
economic losses (World Health Organization [WHO], 2014b).
We also assessed the possibility that country latitude, and
by extension covariates of latitude such as heat demands and
presence of parasitic diseases, might offer some explanation for
the observed relationship between Cultural Value Orientations
and alcohol consumption. Latitude was shown to be a weak
but meaningful partial mediator of the relationship with alcohol
consumption for Harmony, Affective Autonomy, and Hierarchy
(males only for this value), but not Intellectual Autonomy or
Embeddedness. Since this means that latitude and its associated
variables should be considered as an incomplete explanation for
how Cultural Value Orientations account for national differences
in alcohol consumption, it is necessary to consider which other
variables may also be accountable.
A
sociocultural
approach
to
describing
alcohol-related
behaviors has been to categorize cultures based on clusters of
traits (Room and Mäkelä, 2000). One category to emerge from
this approach contains what might be referred to as abstinent
societies. These societies, including some Islamic and Hindu
societies, are characterized by an absolute religious and legal
forbiddance of alcohol consumption. The association between
religiousness and alcohol consumption is well established (e.g.,
Haber and Jacob, 2007; Neighbors et al., 2013) and specific
religious beliefs, such as that homosexuality, abortion and
divorce are bad, have also been found to be negatively correlated
with the cultural value Harmony (Schwartz, 2006). Thus one

Cultural Values and Alcohol
alternative to ecological variables that remains to be tested is that
there may be a relationship between cultural values, religion, and
alcohol consumption.
Similar research questions might also emerge for other
cultural variables. Populations of different countries, for varying
political and historical reasons, experience differing degrees of
freedom, equality, relative safety, and social control that are
likely to provide environments in which there are more or
less opportunities to consume alcohol. Many of such variables
are likely to directly explain some partial variance in the
cultural alcohol consumption patterns. In support of this claim,
American states that have become more politically liberal over
time have increased their alcohol consumption (Yakovlev and
Guessford, 2013). Naturally, such variables are also likely to be
correlated with cultural values. For example, gender equality
has been shown to be strongly positively correlated with
Intellectual Autonomy (Schwartz, 2006). Autonomous countries
have also been shown to enjoy fewer strict social rules (Basabe
and Valencia, 2007). Thus, one future line of investigation
should be examining the interaction between variables such as
political liberalism, cultural values of autonomy, and alcohol
consumption.
The Case of Harmony
The finding that Harmony was positively associated with
alcohol consumption needs further explanation because the
neighboring cultural value orientation, Embeddedness, was
negatively correlated with it. Based on the motivational synergies
proposed by Schwartz, we implicitly expected Harmony to be
unrelated or slightly negatively related to alcohol consumption
because the underlying motivational synergies are related to
Embeddedness, which was, as predicted, negatively correlated
with alcohol consumption. We believe that this can be explained
with the definition of Harmony that “
emphasizes fitting into the
world as it is, trying to understand and appreciate rather than
to change”(Schwartz, 2006, p. 141). In line with this, social
motives related to Harmony such as having a good time with
friends have been found to be predictors of alcohol consumption
(Kuntsche et al., 2005). Furthermore, research that has looked
into the relationship between cultural value orientations and
peacefulness related variables, such as violent inequality, has also
found that the sign of the correlation coefficients was reversed
for Embeddedness and Harmony (Basabe and Valencia, 2007).
This suggests that the underlying motivation for at least those
two adjacent cultural value orientations can also be conflicting
in relation to specific external variables.
The Effect of Gender
Our results indicated some interesting gender effects. Firstly,
the partial correlations between cultural values and alcohol
consumption were stronger for women than for men, suggesting
that cultural values are a more reliable predictor of alcohol
consumption in women than for men. Secondly, the gender-
by-cultural value interactions were all found to be significant.
These indicated that alcohol consumption in women appeared
to differ only slightly, all else being equal, between countries with
high and low values of each value. Nonetheless, despite the small
changes in consumption, it was evident that female consumption
was higher in countries that highly valued Autonomy, and lower
in countries that highly valued Embeddedness. Men tended
to consume more alcohol in countries with higher levels of
each value, the exceptions being Hierarchy and Embeddedness,
for which the differences were small. These findings are in
line with what is expected from opposing cultural values
and supports the relevance of the Autonomy-Embeddedness
dimension for determining cultural alcohol consumption (the
Harmony-Mastery and Egalitarianism-Hierarchy dimensions
showed similar patterns of results for each of the values).
They also suggest that Embeddedness and its adjacent value
Hierarchy, which are more highly associated with less gender
equality (Schwartz, 2006) and negative attitudes about women
drinking alcohol (Pretorious et al., 2009), are relevant cultural
values to consider in accounting for gender differences in alcohol
consumption.
Implications for Public Health
A broad aim of international organizations concerned with public
health is to collect and use data to inform national governments
on how best to tackle health issues. In relation to alcohol,
the WHO in particular has made a continued effort to collect
information and to use this to help nations reduce the harmful
use of alcohol and its consequences (World Health Organization
[WHO], 2014a). Although the WHO uses considerable amounts
of information to help with this process, we argue that cultural
information such as a country’
s value profile may well serve
as a useful tool for helping to inform policy. At a basic level,
our results suggest that the WHO should prioritize tackling
alcohol consumption in countries that are high in Autonomy and
Harmony, and low in Embeddedness and Hierarchy. At the very
least, our results indicate that future research should be directed
at further understanding the causal mechanisms between cultural
values and alcohol consumption, and their interaction with
gender, the results of which could be used to tailor intervention
programs that are culturally sensitive.
Importantly, alcohol consumption is just one of four
modifiable behavioral risk factors of NCDs, which are responsible
for 70% of global deaths (World Health Organization [WHO],
2014b). The other risk factors are smoking, physical inactivity,
and diet. Having shed some light on the cultural underpinnings
of alcohol consumption, an obvious next step is to create similar
profiles and models to understand the cultural underpinnings
of these other risk factors. When combined, this information
may prove to be highly impactful on how governments opt to
implement health policies aimed at reducing the prevalence of
NCDs.
Strengths
The results of our study are interesting because our variables –
cultural value orientations, Education, Income and Alcohol
consumption–were measured independently and are based on
different sources (self-report vs. official statistics). This rules
methodological bias out as a hidden moderator – a problem
which many studies that rely on self-reports face (Richardson
et al., 2009). Also, the data we used is highly reliable and

Cultural Values and Alcohol
stable, given that it relies on around 40,000 participants, whose
responses were used to estimate the 74 country averages of the
cultural value orientations.
A test of the validity revealed a similar overall CVO profile for
three different time points over 20 years and for the European
subset of countries for men and women for the time period
2008–
2010: These findings suggest firstly that the identified
pattern of associations between cultural value orientations and
alcohol is not specific to a single time point, although it appears
that the overall association between cultural values and alcohol
is decreasing: likely a result of converging levels of alcohol
consumption across countries (Room and Mäkelä, 2000). This
is interesting since the global trend and current projections for
2025 are an increase in alcohol consumption (World Health
Organization [WHO], 2014a). At a regional level, however, there
are some differences, with Europe showing a trend for decreases
in consumption.
The pattern of associations was replicated with a European
subsample of our data. Inspecting the total levels of alcohol
consumption, the pattern of correlations between the European
sample and the total sample (Table 1) were, with the exception of
Hierarchy, remarkably similar. Hierarchy had a weaker negative
correlation in the European sample than the total sample. The
non-European sample was also fairly similar to the total sample,
particularly for Harmony, Embeddedness, Hierarchy, Mastery
and Affective Autonomy.
Limitations
In our analyses we controlled for two variables that have been
shown to be associated with alcohol consumption; income and
education (Grittner et al., 2013; Barr et al., 2016). Of course, other
variables such as the average age of a population, the price of
alcohol, national alcohol laws/policies, degree of urbanization etc.
also influence alcohol consumption and were not controlled for.
These variables should be considered in future research. Since
the number of predictors/variables determines the sample size
required for sufficiently powered statistical analyses, including
additional covariates in future research will require multi-level
data from a larger sample of countries. Further, although not
reported, our analyses revealed that cultural value orientations
were correlated with income and education. Thus it is likely
that our analysis controlled out some of the cultural variance in
alcohol consumption.
When examining the association between cultural value
orientations and alcohol consumption at different years we used
the same CVO values and so it might be argued that our results
do not entirely accurately reflect the time specific associations.
However, cultural value orientations are claimed to be stable over
time (Schwartz et al., 2000; Hofstede, 2001; Manfredo et al., 2017;
Tormos et al., 2017) and this suggests that over a relatively short
period of time using the same values of cultural value orientations
is legitimate.
While the associations between total alcohol consumption
and values for European and non-European countries were
similar for Harmony, Embeddedness, Mastery and Affective
Autonomy, some notable differences were evident between the
European subsample and non-European subsample. Firstly, with
the exception of Egalitarianism, alcohol consumption in males
from non-European countries showed little evidence of being
correlated with cultural value orientations. In this sense, the
pattern of associations for males displayed in Table 1 can be
said to be driven by European countries. In other words, while
encultured drinking levels by men in Europe is associated with
cultural values, outside of Europe these values are unrelated to
consumption. Why this might be, lies beyond the scope of this
discussion. For women, the associations between consumption
and values were, more or less, consistent between the subsamples,
although of note was that Egalitarianism was more strongly
associated with alcohol consumption in European countries
than non-European countries. This highlights the complexity
of the relationship between values and alcohol consumption,
specifically demonstrating that beyond the presented two-
way gender-by-value interactions, there may also be three-
way region-by-gender-by-value interactions. Future research,
incorporating larger data-sets should consider this complex
interplay of variables.
Future Research
In addition to investigating the interplay between cultural values,
alcohol consumption, and variables such as religiosity, we suggest
that future research should look into causal relations between
cultural value orientations and alcohol consumption, using a
multi-level longitudinal design. Prior pseudo-longitudinal work
using cultural value orientations to predict socioeconomic
development and democratization has found that cultural value
orientations predict said national variable rather than vice
versa (Schwartz, 2006). Also, a longitudinal study has found
that values and value-expressive behaviors influence each other
reciprocally, but values tended to have a stronger influence on
behavior then behavior on values (Vecchione et al., 2015). We
are therefore expecting that cultural value orientations influence
alcohol consumption directly, but that alcohol consumption can
also influence cultural value orientations through indirect routes
such as conflict and increased levels of psychopathology: both
values and alcohol consumption have been found to be related
to or causing aggression and depression (Hoaken and Stewart,
2003; Boden and Fergusson, 2011; Hanel and Wolfradt, 2016;
Souchon et al., submitted). A multi-level design would allow us
to test whether the same pattern observed on a country level
can also be found on an individual level consistently in each
country.

latitude such as climatic demands, were shown to partially
explain the relationship between Cultural Value Orientations

inability to account for the relationship between Embeddedness,
