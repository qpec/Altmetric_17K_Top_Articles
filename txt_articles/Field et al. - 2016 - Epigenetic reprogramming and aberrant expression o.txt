Background: We previously identified PRAME as a biomarker for metastatic risk 
in Class 1 uveal melanomas. In this study, we sought to define a threshold value for 
positive PRAME expression (PRAME+) in a large dataset, identify factors associated 
with PRAME expression, evaluate the prognostic value of PRAME in Class 2 uveal 
melanomas, and determine whether PRAME expression is associated with aberrant 
hypomethylation of the PRAME promoter.
Results: Among 678 samples analyzed by qPCR, 498 (73.5%) were PRAME- and 
180 (26.5%) were PRAME+. Class 1 tumors were more likely to be PRAME-, whereas 
Class 2 tumors were more likely to be PRAME+ (P < 0.0001). PRAME expression was 
associated with shorter time to metastasis and melanoma specific mortality in Class 
2 tumors (P = 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively). In Class 1 tumors, PRAME expression 
was directly associated with SF3B1 mutations (P < 0.0001) and inversely associated 
with EIF1AX mutations (P = 0.004). PRAME expression was strongly associated with 
hypomethylation at 12 CpG sites near the PRAME promoter.
Materials and methods: Analyses included PRAME mRNA expression, Class 1 
versus Class 2 status, chromosomal copy number, mutation status of BAP1, EIF1AX, 
GNA11, GNAQ and SF3B1, and genomic DNA methylation status. Analyses were 
performed on 555 de-identified samples from Castle Biosciences, 123 samples from 
our center, and 80 samples from the TCGA.
Conclusions: PRAME is aberrantly hypomethylated and activated in Class 1 and 
Class 2 uveal melanomas and is associated with increased metastatic risk in both 
classes. Since PRAME has been successfully targeted for immunotherapy, it may prove 
to be a companion prognostic biomarker.
INtrODUctION
Uveal melanoma is the most common primary 
cancer of the eye and the second most common form 
of melanoma. Due to a high rate of metastasis, much 
research has focused on the development of biomarkers 
to predict metastatic risk. Previously, we described a gene 
expression profile that could be performed on a fine needle 
biopsy of the primary tumor that accurately predicted 
metastasis [1]. Tumors with the Class 1 profile have a 
low metastatic risk, whereas those with the Class 2 profile 
have a high metastatic risk. Consequently, a 15 gene 
array (12 discriminating genes and 3 control genes) was 
developed and prospectively validated [2, 3]. This assay

is now available commercially as the DecisionDx-UMTM 
test (Castle Biosciences), which has been independently 
validated [4] and is widely used to stratify patients for 
metastatic surveillance and to identify high risk patients 
for adjuvant therapy trials [5].
While the vast majority of metastatic events in 
uveal melanoma arise from Class 2 tumors, a small 
subset of Class 1 tumors also give rise to metastasis. We 
found that the expression of two of the 12 discriminating 
genes on the array (CDH1 and RAB31) could be used 
to identify Class 1 tumors that may have increased 
metastatic risk. Class 1 tumors with low expression 
of these genes and very low predicted metastatic risk 
were called Class “1A,” whereas those with high 
expression and higher predicted metastatic risk were 
called Class “1B.” In our efforts to further improve 
the prognostic accuracy of the gene array platform, we 
conducted a genome wide search for new biomarkers 
and found that mRNA expression of the cancer-testis 
antigen Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma 
(PRAME) was an accurate biomarker for metastasis in 
Class 1 tumors [6]. In that initial study, we found that 
any detectable mRNA expression of PRAME above 
baseline was associated with increased metastatic risk. 
Limitations of that study included a relatively small 
number of tumor samples that were biased towards 
larger tumor size.
To date, there have been five common driver 
mutations identified in uveal melanoma: BAP1, EIF1AX, 
GNA11, GNAQ and SF3B1 [7–11]. Mutations in BAP1, 
SF3B1 and EIF1AX are almost mutually exclusive and are 
associated with high, intermediate and low metastatic risk, 
respectively [6, 12]. Also, SF3B1 mutations were found to 
be associated with PRAME expression [6].
The purpose of the present study was to study 
PRAME expression in a much larger number of Class 1 
and, for the first time, in Class 2 uveal melanomas spanning 
the true range of tumor sizes encountered in clinical 
practice. We sought to define a threshold value for calling a 
tumor sample positive for PRAME expression (PRAME+), 
compare PRAME expression to the 1A/1B designation 
in Class 1 tumors, identify clinical and molecular 
factors associated with PRAME expression, evaluate the 
prognostic value of PRAME expression in Class 2 tumors, 
and determine whether PRAME expression in uveal 
melanoma is correlated with promoter hypomethylation.
rEsULts
To evaluate the spectrum of PRAME mRNA 
expression and to establish a threshold for positive 
PRAME expression in primary uveal melanoma, 
we analyzed qPCR data from 678 tumor samples, 
including 123 of our samples and 555 de-identified 
samples submitted from a large number of ocular 
oncology centers to Castle Biosciences. These samples 
included 454 (67.0%) Class 1 tumors and 224 (33.0%) 
Class 2 tumors. Class 1 tumors included 317 (69.8%) 
Class 1A tumors, 131 (28.9%) Class 1B tumors, and 6 
(1.3%) tumors for which 1A/1B information was not 
available. Whereas most samples showed negligible 
PRAME expression, a subset of samples showed a broad 
range of PRAME expression (Figure 1A). We previously 
showed that any PRAME expression above baseline was 
associated with increased metastasis in Class 1 tumors 
and consequently defined any expression above baseline 
as positive PRAME expression (PRAME+) [6]. In this 
study, we used the same methodology to establish a 
broadly applicable PRAME+ threshold from qPCR data 
using a much larger dataset that included both Class 1 
and Class 2 tumors, with a majority derived from fine 
needle biopsy of small and medium sized tumors and 
a smaller number from large, enucleated specimens 
that is representative of the actual distribution of tumor 
sizes encountered in clinical practice (Figure 1B–1C). 
A similar method was used to determine a PRAME+ 
threshold using RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) dataset (Figure 1D). 
Overall, 498 (73.5%) tumors were PRAME− and 180 
(26.5%) were PRAME+. Class 1 tumors were more likely 
to be PRAME−, whereas Class 2 tumors were more likely 
to be PRAME+ (Fisher exact test, P < 0.0001) (Figure 2A). 
Among Class 1 tumors, 357 (78.6%) were PRAME− and 
97 (21.4%) were PRAME+. Among Class 1A tumors, 261 
(82.3%) were PRAME− and 56 (17.7%) were PRAME+. 
Among Class 1B tumors, 93 (71.0%) were PRAME− and 
38 (29.0%) were PRAME+. Class 1A tumors were more 
likely to be PRAME−, whereas Class 1B tumors were 
more likely to be PRAME+ (Fisher exact test, P = 0.01) 
(Figure 2B). Among Class 2 tumors, 141 (62.9%) were 
PRAME− and 83 (37.1%) were PRAME+. Additionally, 
we determined PRAME mRNA status in commonly used 
UM cell lines: Mel202 and MP41 are PRAME+, whereas 
92.1, Mel270, Mel290, and MP46 are PRAME−. 
Association between PrAME and clinical 
features
Clinical annotations and PRAME expression 
were available for 123 of our uveal melanoma samples 
(Supplementary Table S1). The only features that were 
significantly associated with PRAME+ status were larger 
tumor diameter and thickness (Mann-Whitney test, P = 0.01 
 
and P = 0.02, respectively). To expand this analysis, we 
examined the TCGA Research Network dataset which 
consists of an independent cohort of 80 primary uveal 
melanoma 
samples 
(http://cancergenome.nih.gov/) 
(Supplementary Table S2). Since PRAME expression 
data were obtained from RNA-Seq analysis in the 
TCGA dataset, we established a threshold for PRAME+ 
expression using the same procedure as for qPCR data 
(Figure 1D). Consistent with our original dataset, PRAME+

status in the TCGA dataset was associated with larger 
tumor diameter (P = 0.02). In both datasets, well-known 
 
risk factors for metastasis such as increased patient age, 
ciliary body involvement, and extrascleral tumor extension 
were not associated with PRAME expression status. 
We previously showed that PRAME expression 
was associated with increased metastatic risk in Class 1 
uveal melanomas [6]. Here, we extend that analysis 
to determine whether PRAME expression is also a 
biomarker for metastasis in Class 2 tumors. For this 
analysis, we combined our 123 cases with the 80 cases 
from the TCGA. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, 
PRAME+ status was associated with shorter time to 
metastasis for both Class 1 and Class 2 tumors together 
(P = 0.0002; 22 metastatic events; median follow-up of 
19 months, range 0–125 months) and for Class 2 tumors 
alone (P = 0.01; 15 metastatic events; median follow-up 
 
of 18 months, range 0–89 months)(Figure 3A–3B). 
Similarly, PRAME+ status was associated with shorter 
time to melanoma-specific mortality for both Class 1 and 
Class 2 tumors together (P = 0.001; 32 melanoma-specific 
mortality events; median follow-up of 19 months, range 
0–142 months) and for Class 2 tumors alone (P = 0.02; 
28 melanoma-specific mortality events, median follow-up 
of 18 months, range 0–89 months) (Figure 3C–3D). 
Association between PrAME and chromosomal 
alterations
To identify chromosomal copy number changes 
that may be associated with PRAME expression, we 
analyzed 26 of our cases and 80 TCGA cases for which 
chromosomal copy number and PRAME expression 
data were available (Supplementary Table S3). Overall, 
PRAME+ tumors were strongly associated with 6q loss 
(P < 0.0001), 8p loss (P = 0.04), 8q gain (P < 0.0001) 
and 16q loss (P < 0.0001) (Figure 4). Notably, PRAME 
expression status was not associated with monosomy 3 
 
(P = 0.3), the chromosomal alteration most strongly 
associated 
with 
metastasis 
in 
uveal 
melanoma, 
highlighting the potential benefit of including PRAME 
expression status in a prognostic test. 
We then analyzed Class 1 and Class 2 tumors 
separately. Among Class 1 tumors, PRAME+ status was 
associated with 1q gain (P = 0.04), 6p gain (P = 0.01), 
6q loss (P < 0.0001), 8q gain (P < 0.0001), and 16q 
loss (P = 0.004). PRAME+ status in Class 2 tumors was 
associated with 6p gain (P = 0.04), 6q loss (P = 0.0001), 8p 
loss (P = 0.05), 8q gain (P = 0.02) and 16q loss (P = 0.003). 
PRAME expression was not associated with monosomy 3 
in either comparison (Supplementary Table S3).

Association between PRAME and driver gene 
mutations
To identify common driver mutations that may be 
associated with PRAME+ status, we analyzed 59 of our 
cases for which mutation data were available, as well 
as the 80 TCGA cases, for mutations in EIF1AX, BAP1, 
GNA11, GNAQ and SF3B1 (Supplementary Table S4). 
When Class 1 and Class 2 tumors were considered 
together, PRAME+ status was associated with BAP1 
mutations (P = 0.02). However, this association is likely 
due to BAP1 mutations occurring almost exclusively in 
Class 2 tumors [9], which we show here to be associated 
with PRAME+ status. When Class 1 tumors were analyzed 
separately, PRAME expression was directly associated 
with SF3B1 mutations (P < 0.0001) and inversely 
associated with EIF1AX mutations (P = 0.004). There 
were no mutations associated with PRAME expression in 
Class 2 tumors when analyzed separately.
PRAME expression is associated with aberrant 
promoter hypomethylation
Testes is the only normal adult tissue that expresses 
PRAME mRNA at appreciable levels (Figure 5A), 
which strongly suggests that the expression of PRAME 
in uveal melanoma is anomalous. Consequently, we 
hypothesized that PRAME may become aberrantly 
activated in uveal melanoma by hypomethylation of 
the promoter region. Consistent with this hypothesis, 
12 CpG sites within and near the PRAME promoter 
were significantly hypomethylated (FDR < 0.05 for all 
probes) in PRAME+ tumors compared to PRAME− 
tumors (Figure 5B). We validated these findings using 
bisulfite conversion followed by Sanger sequencing in 
a subset of cases (Supplementary Table S5). Strikingly, 
there was a highly significant correlation between the 
level of hypomethylation of all 12 CpG sites and the 
level of mRNA expression (P < 0.0001) (Figure 5C and 
Supplementary Figure S1). The most differentially 
methylated CpG site (recognized by probe cg27303185) 
is hypermethylated in all adult tissues except placenta and 
sperm (Figure 5D). These data indicate that the PRAME 
promoter region is normally hypermethylated and silenced 
in virtually all normal adult tissues, but it is targeted for 
hypomethylation and aberrant transcriptional activation 
during uveal melanoma progression.
DIscUssION
We previously reported that PRAME mRNA 
expression is a significant risk factor for metastasis in 
Class 1 uveal melanomas, and we developed a general 
method for establishing a PRAME+ threshold in various 
datasets [6]. In that article, our analysis included a much 
greater proportion of large tumors treated by enucleation 
than are encountered in actual clinical practice. However, 
since we show here that PRAME expression is strongly 
associated with larger tumor size, a study composed 
primarily of large tumors may not accurately reflect 
the true range of PRAME expression. To pursue the 
development of PRAME as a clinical biomarker, we sought 
here to rigorously establish a standard method for defining 
the PRAME+ expression threshold using a standardized 
and widely used qPCR platform. To achieve a widely 
applicable threshold and avoid potential systematic biases 
arising from a single center study, we analyzed a large 
number of samples obtained from many different ocular 
oncology centers representing a wide range of tumor 
sizes and both Class 1 and Class 2 tumors in proportions 
representative of actual clinical practice. From this 
analysis, we established a PRAME+ threshold and used it 
to identify clinical, chromosomal and mutational features 
associated with PRAME expression. We also established 
a PRAME+ threshold for RNA-Seq using the TCGA 
dataset, but this threshold must be considered provisional 
since that dataset was composed primarily of very large 
tumors treated by enucleation. Indeed, 43% of the TCGA 
samples were PRAME+, compared to only 27% of our 
samples. 
Across all samples, larger tumor size was the only 
clinical feature that correlated with PRAME+ status, 
Figure 4: Association of PRAME expression with chromosomal gains and losses. The bar graphs depict chromosomal gains 
and losses that were significantly associated with PRAME+ tumors when Class 1 and Class 2 tumors were analyzed together, and when 
each class was analyzed separately. PRAME+ (red), PRAME− (blue).

suggesting that PRAME becomes transcriptionally 
activated later during tumor progression. Interestingly, 
even though PRAME+ status was a stronger predictor of 
metastasis in Class 1 tumors, it was also associated with 
metastasis in Class 2 tumors. In our earlier study that was 
much smaller and biased towards larger tumors treated by 
enucleation, we did not find a correlation between PRAME 
expression status and the “1A/1B” system that the clinical 
test currently uses to indicate low (1A) versus moderate 
(1B) metastatic risk [6]. In the present study that included 
a much larger number of samples that better represented 
the full spectrum of uveal melanomas, we observed 
a highly significant correlation between PRAME+ 
status and “1B” status. Nevertheless, since there were a 
number of discordant cases, we are preparing to start a 
multi-center prospective study to determine the relative 
prognostic value of PRAME expression status versus the 
1A/1B designation in Class 1 tumors in order to determine 
the optimal biomarker for increased metastatic risk in 
Class 1 tumors. A limitation of this analysis is the limited 
follow-up, particularly from the TCGA dataset, which 
results in a large number of censored data points. Our 
planned prospective multicenter study with long follow-up 
is the appropriate study design to validate these findings. 
Since we found that PRAME+ correlates significantly 
with tumor size, this multi-center study will also evaluate 
whether there is a minimum threshold tumor size at which 
point PRAME becomes prognostic. 
PRAME expression was associated with specific 
chromosomal gains and losses, some of which were 
specific to either Class 1 or Class 2 tumors. Changes that 
were associated with PRAME+ status in both Class 1 and 
Class 2 tumors included 6p gain, 6q loss, 8q gain and 
16q loss. 6p gain and 6q loss were frequently found in 
the same tumor samples, likely representing the formation 
of an isochromosome 6p [13, 14]. A previous study 
identified 16q loss in 16% of uveal melanomas, but no 
prognostic significance was found [14]. Our study using 
a larger number of samples and more accurate molecular 
analytical methods indicates that 16q loss may indeed 
have prognostic significance. 1q gain was associated 
with PRAME+ status only in Class 1 tumors, which 
confirms our previous observation [6]. 1q gain has only 
rarely been mentioned in the uveal melanoma literature 
[15], but our findings suggest the need for further studies 
to determine whether 1q gain has pathogenic as well as 
prognostic significance. 8p loss was associated with 
PRAME+ status only in Class 2 tumors, whereas 8q 
gain was associated with PRAME+ status in both tumor 
classes. 8q gain is prevalent in both Class 1 and Class 2

tumors, but the mechanism leading to 8q gain tends to be 
different between the two tumor classes [16]. In Class 1 
 
tumors, 8q gain often occurs through gain of an entire 
copy of chromosome 8 or by simple gain of the q arm, 
whereas in Class 2 tumors, 8q gain frequently occurs 
through formation of an isochromosome 8q, which is 
accompanied by loss of 8p [17]. The common association 
of PRAME expression and isochromosome formation on 
chromosomes 6 and 8 is of interest and may provide new 
insight into uveal melanoma tumorigenesis. We previously 
showed that genes which become aberrantly up-regulated 
in PRAME+ tumors are enriched for functions related to 
chromosome maintenance, meiotic recombination and 
telomere maintenance [6]. In addition, the PRAME protein 
has been shown to associate at transcriptional target 
sites on chromatin with the KEOPS/EKC complex [18], 
which is involved in chromosome segregation, telomere 
maintenance and other highly conserved functions [19]. 
Hence, aberrant expression of PRAME may predispose 
tumor cells to isochromosome formation, as well as other 
forms of aneuploidy that promote tumor progression.
Our finding that PRAME becomes aberrantly 
hypomethylated and transcriptionally activated during 
uveal melanoma progression is similar to findings in other 
cancers [20, 21] and may have therapeutic implications. 
Since PRAME is not normally expressed in most normal 
adult tissues, targeted molecular inhibition of the PRAME 
protein or immunotherapy directed against PRAME−
expressing tumor cells may be well tolerated. Indeed, 
there is growing evidence that PRAME may be a good 
target for immunotherapy [22–25]. Since the PRAME 
protein is not normally expressed on the cell surface, 
one strategy is to target PRAME using a T-cell receptor 
mimic (TCRm) monoclonal antibody that recognizes 
the PRAME300–309 peptide presented by HLA*A02:01 on 
the cell surface [26]. Others have developed PRAME−
specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes that have shown 
effective responses against PRAME-expressing tumor 
cells, including progenitor populations that are notoriously 
resistant to current cancer therapeutic strategies [24, 27]. 
Furthest along in development are vaccines against 
PRAME that are currently undergoing clinical trials in 
cutaneous melanoma and other cancers (Trial numbers 
NCT01149343, NCT01853878 and NCT00423254) [28]. 
Interestingly, we evaluated PRAME expression of two 
matched primary and metastatic UM samples analyzed by 
the Illumina HumanRef-8 v1.0 expression microarray in 
our previously published dataset (GEO accession number 
GSE39717) [29], and we found that both the primary and 
metastatic samples were PRAME+ (data not shown), 
supporting a mechanistic role for PRAME expression 
in UM metastasis. Since no effective therapies currently 
exist for metastatic uveal melanoma [30], our center and 
others are preparing to undertake clinical trials to assess 
the efficacy of PRAME-directed immunotherapy in 
appropriately selected patients.
In summary, we have provided a threshold for 
PRAME+ expression from qPCR data for primary uveal 
melanomas across a wide spectrum of tumor sizes and 
in both tumor classes representative of actual clinical 
practice. We previously identified PRAME expression as a 
biomarker for increased metastatic risk in Class 1 tumors 
[6], and here we showed for the first time that PRAME 
expression is also associated with worse prognosis 
among Class 2 tumors. We demonstrated that specific 
chromosomal gains and losses, as well as specific driver 
mutations, are found preferentially in PRAME+ tumors. 
Finally, we showed that specific CpG sites around the 
PRAME promoter are differentially hypomethylated 
in PRAME+ tumors, suggesting that the aberrant 
transcriptional activation of PRAME in uveal melanoma 
is the result of epigenetic reprogramming during tumor 
progression. In addition to its prognostic value, PRAME 
expression status may potentially be useful in the future 
for guiding the use of PRAME-directed immunotherapy, 
which would make PRAME the first true “companion 
prognostic” biomarker in uveal melanoma. 
MAtErIALs AND MEtHODs
The sources of all uveal melanoma samples used 
in this study are summarized in Supplementary Table S6. 
Tumor samples were obtained from 123 primary uveal 
melanomas from the practice of one of the authors 
(JWH), including 64 samples that were included in a 
previous publication [6]. The research was conducted in 
a HIPAA-compliant manner in accordance with the tenets 
of the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval was obtained 
from the Institutional Review Board of the University of 
Miami. Written informed consent was obtained from each 
patient from our center. Baseline clinical information and 
patient outcomes were recorded. De-identified PRAME 
expression and GEP Class data were obtained from 555 
uveal melanoma samples from Castle Biosciences that had 
been collected between July 21, 2015, and March 2, 2016, 
as part of internal PRAME qPCR method development. 
These samples were obtained as formalin-fixed paraffin-
embedded tissue from enucleations in 55 (9.9%) cases and 
as fresh-frozen samples from fine needle aspirate biopsies 
in 500 (90.1%) cases. The data available for these cases 
included GEP class, 1A versus 1B subtype for Class 1 
tumors, and PRAME mRNA expression. Additionally 
we analyzed clinical, whole exome sequencing, RNA 
sequencing, SNP 6.0 array data, and DNA methylation 
data from 80 uveal melanoma samples generated by the 
TCGA Research Network: http://cancergenome.nih.gov/.
PRAME mRNA expression analysis 
For the RNA samples from our center and from 
Castle Biosciences, PRAME mRNA expression was 
analyzed by qPCR using the Applied Biosystems 7900 HT

Real-Time PCR System with TaqMan primers and Gene 
Expression Master Mix following the manufacturer’s 
protocol as previously described [6]. Ct values were 
calculated using the manufacturer’s software and 
ΔCt values were calculated by subtracting the geometric 
mean of the Ct values of the endogenous control genes 
from the mean Ct values for PRAME, as previously 
described [6]. Relative normal expression was calculated 
using the equation 2^-ΔCT. For the 80 samples from the 
TCGA, raw RNA-Seq datasets were aligned to the hg19 
genome using STAR [31], which was also used to generate 
count files. Count files were then normalized using 
DeSeq2 [32]. Next-generation sequencing analysis was 
conducted on Pegasus, the supercomputer administered 
by the Advanced Computing Group of the Center for 
Computational Science at the University of Miami. For 
PRAME mRNA expression in normal tissues, RNA-Seq 
data was obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression 
(GTEx) project [33].
Estimating class status from RNA-sequencing 
data
For research purposes of this study, we estimated the 
gene expression profile class assignment for the 80 TCGA 
samples, which were analyzed by RNA-Seq. Raw RNA-
Seq datasets were prepared using the pipeline described 
in the previous section. The top 20% most variable genes 
were selected, analyzed by principal component analysis, 
and plotted using the stats, matrixstats, and rgl packages, 
respectively, in R (version 3.2.3).  This analysis grouped 
the samples into two clusters, as we have previously 
described for Class 1 and Class 2 tumors [34]. The identity 
of each cluster was determined to be most consistent with 
Class 1 versus Class 2 based on the expression of genes 
previously known to be differentially up-regulated in each 
Class. The DecisionDx-UM test results were available for 
11 of these samples, and there was 100% concordance 
with our class assignment. This method was used solely 
for research purposes and is not meant for actual clinical 
testing, as it has not been prospectively validated in a 
manner analogous to the DecisionDx-UM test. 
Determining PRAME+ expression threshold
qPCR and RNA-Seq samples were separately 
ordered from lowest to highest relative and normalized 
PRAME expression, respectively, and each was plotted 
with a line representing the best-fitting LOESS model 
(second degree, family = ”Gaussian”, spanning 0.4 for 
qPCR and 0.45 for RNA-Seq, fitting by least-squares)
(Figure 1A). Based on the LOESS model, a predicted 
dataset fitting the LOESS model was generated 
(Figure 1B) and the slope between each predicted point 
was calculated and plotted (Figure 1C) to represent the 
change in slope. The point of inflection where the slope 
sustainably rose above baseline was defined as the cut-off 
for PRAME+ and PRAME− (Figure 1C–1D).
Exome sequencing and chromosomal copy 
number analysis
Whole-exome sequencing was conducted on 24 of 
our primary uveal melanomas and matched blood using 
NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Human Exome Library v2.0 
(Roche Nimblegen) and run on the Illumina Genome 
Analyzer II. Exome sequencing data on 80 primary 
uveal melanoma TCGA samples were downloaded from 
CGHub and aligned to the hg19 reference genome using 
Novoalign. Variant calling was conducted using Mutect2 
[35] and Varscan2 [36]. Chromosomal copy number 
analysis was obtained for 106 samples, including 26 
samples from our center (15 from previously published 
data and 11 newly analyzed from exome sequencing data) 
and 80 from the TCGA. Chromosomal gains and losses 
were called by CNVKit [37] for exome sequencing data 
and by ASCAT [38] for TCGA SNP 6.0 array data. 
DNA methylation analysis
The 80 TCGA uveal melanoma tumors samples 
were assayed for global DNA methylation status with the 
Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip (Illumina). 
This kit interrogates ~450,000 methylation sites at single-
nucleotide resolution, including at CpG sites within 
promoter, 5ʹUTR, first exon, gene body, and 3ʹUTR 
regions. Methylation data underwent quality control, 
normalization, and differential analysis of PRAME+ 
and PRAME− samples using the ChAMP methylation 
pipeline in R [39]. CpG sites that were differentially 
hypomethylated at a significance level of FDR < 0.05 were 
plotted along the PRAME locus using the GViz package 
in R. All 12 methylation probes targeting PRAME that 
are included in the Methyl450K array were significantly 
hypomethylated in the TCGA PRAME+ samples.
For validation, primers were designed against a 
region containing 3 of these 12 probes and validated in 
4 PRAME+ and 3 PRAME− samples. This validation 
study was small due to limited sample availability. 
For primer design, 500 ng of tumor DNA was bisulfite 
converted using the EZ Methylation-Lightning Kit 
(Zymo Research). Primers for PCR amplification 
of the PRAME promoter were designed with the 
Bisulfite Primer Seeker (http://www.zymoresearch.
com/tools/bisulfite-primer-seeker). 
Forward 
Primer: 
GAAGGATTTCGTGTTTAAGGTTTTTTAAGG. Reverse 
 
Primer: GTGTTTTTATTTTGGAAATAGAGATTTAGT 
TTTTTTT. The PRAME promoter region was amplified 
with the EpiMark Hot Start Taq polymerase (New England 
Biolabs) at Tm = 54.5°C, and the PCR product purified by 
agarose gel separation/elution before Sanger sequencing.

cg27303185 in normal tissues was obtained from Marmal-

R in comparison to TCGA uveal melanoma data.
statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Medcalc® 
version 14.10.2. Fisher’s exact test was used to evaluate 
discrete dichotomous variables, the Mann-Whitney test for 
comparison of continuous variables, Spearman’s rho for 
correlation analyses of continuous variables, and Kaplan-
Meier survival analysis for determining the association of 
PRAME expression status with patient outcomes.
