Aim: Hamstring strain injury is common in soccer. The aim of this study was to evaluate
the physical capacity of players who have and have not suffered from hamstring strain
injury in a sample of semi-professional and professional Norwegian soccer players
in order to evaluate characteristics and to identify possible indications of insufficient
rehabilitation.
Method: Seventy-five semi-professional and professional soccer players (19 ± 3 years)
playing at the second and third level in the Norwegian league participated in the study.
All players answered a questionnaire, including one question about hamstring strain
injury (yes/no) during the previous 2 years. They also performed a 40 m maximal sprint
test, a repeated sprint test (8 × 20 m), a countermovement jump, a maximal oxygen
consumption (VO2max) test, strength tests and flexibility tests. Independent sample t-tests
were used to evaluate differences in the physical capacity of the players who had suffered
from hamstring strain injury and those who had not. Mixed between-within subject’s
analyses of variance was used to compare changes in speed during the repeated sprint
test between groups.
Results: Players who reported hamstring strain injury during the previous two years
(16%) had a significantly higher drop in speed (0.07 vs. 0.02 s, p = 0.007) during the
repeated sprint test, compared to players reporting no previous hamstring strain injury.
In addition, there was a significant interaction (groups × time) (F = 3.22, p = 0.002),
showing that speed in the two groups changed differently during the repeated sprint
test. There were no significant differences in relations to age, weight, height, body fat,
linear speed, countermovement jump height, leg strength, VO2max, or hamstring flexibility
between the groups.
Conclusion: Soccer players who reported hamstring strain injury during the previous 2
years showed significant higher drop in speed during the repeated sprint test compared
to players with no hamstring strain injury. The maximal speed, leg strength, ability to

produce maximal power, endurance capacity, and hamstring flexibility was similar for
both groups. Thus, a repeated sprint test consisting of 8 × 20 m could be used as
a field-based diagnostic tool to identify players in need of reconditioning programs to
ensure complete post-injury rehabilitation.

INTRODUCTION
Hamstrings strain injuries are common among soccer players,
and account for 12–16% of all soccer-related injuries (Arnason
et al., 2004; Woods et al., 2004; Ekstrand et al., 2011a; Hagglund
et al., 2016). Although there has been a great focus on prevention
and treatment of these injuries, the relative number of registered
cases has not decreased over time (Ekstrand et al., 2011a,b, 2016).
The consequences of hamstring strain injury depends largely
on the severity, and the extent of the damage can vary from
microscopic muscle-fiber ruptures to a complete tear involving
several muscle fascicles (Opar et al., 2012). These injuries account
for more than one-third of all time-loss in high-level European
professional football, and represent a significant cost burden for
the clubs and a major challenge to the players’ careers (Woods
et al., 2004; Ekstrand et al., 2016).
It is important for both clubs and players that rehabilitation
and return to play takes place as quickly as possible after
hamstring strain injury. On the other hand, incomplete
rehabilitation increases the risk of another and often more
severe hamstring strain injury (Maniar et al., 2016). Since the
most commonly cited risk factor for a future hamstring strain
injury is a previous hamstring strain injury (Arnason et al.,
2004; Hägglund et al., 2006), sufficient rehabilitation is crucial.
To prevent re-injury, it is important to identify the physical
capacities that can identify insufficient rehabilitation. In previous
studies, various measurements of complete rehabilitation after a
hamstring strain injury such as leg strength, hamstring flexibility
(Maniar et al., 2016), and sprinting speed have been used (van der
Horst et al., 2016). However, there is to date no gold standard, and
the recurrence rate of hamstring strain injury is reported to be as
high as 33% (van der Horst et al., 2016).
Endurance, acceleration, deceleration, maximal sprinting and
repeated sprinting ability are important capacities in soccer
(Ingebrigtsen et al., 2015). The hamstring muscle is very
important in sprint acceleration performance and in maximal
sprinting (Morin et al., 2015). The vast majority of hamstring
strain injuries in soccer occur when running (Woods et al.,
2004; Opar et al., 2012), most often late in the match or
training session (Woods et al., 2004; Mohr et al., 2005; Ekstrand
et al., 2011a), which suggests that neuromuscular fatigue plays
a role (Small et al., 2009; Russell et al., 2016). Thus, there
is a need of a specific test, with ecological validity, able to
identify those players standing into a risk of hamstring re-
injury. Most rehabilitation tests are performed maximal effort
without muscular fatigue. One exception was a recent study
which showed increased neuromuscular fatigue, measured as
reduced jump height after repeated sprints, in players with
former lower-limb injury (Padulo et al., 2016).
In the present study, the aim was to evaluate the physical
capacities of players who had and had not suffered from
hamstring strain injuries in a sample of semi-professional and
professional Norwegian soccer players in order to identify
possible indications of insufficient rehabilitation.
METHODS
Design
A cross-sectional design was employed, with data collection from
January to March 2015. All physical tests were performed during
2 subsequent days for each player. Sprinting tests were performed
in an indoor area with a Dynaspike running surface, whereas
countermovement jump, strength, flexibility, and maximal
oxygen consumption (VO2max) tests were conducted in the
physiological testing laboratory at Bergen University College
(Figure 1).
Participants
In total, 94 male semi-professional and professional soccer
players (20 ± 4 years, 75 ± 10 kg, 181 ± 6 cm) who play at the
second and third level in the Norwegian league participated in the
study, which included a questionnaire and a variety of physical
tests (Figure 1). Eighty-nine of the players answered the question
regarding previous hamstring strain injury, and 75 of the players
performed the repeated sprint test (Figure 2).
Procedures
Players were instructed not to engage in strenuous exercise the
day before testing, and to perform all tests in t-shirt, shorts, and
suitable shoes. They were also told to eat and drink properly
before testing, and to drink and eat a light meal containing
carbohydrates between the sprint and the strength tests.
The 40 m Linear Sprint Test
Before the sprint tests, all players went through a standardized
15-min warm-up protocol led by a physical trainer. The warm-
up protocol consisted of a 10-min general part with low
intensity running. Then, players performed 5-min of guided
stretching (i.e., of hamstrings, quadriceps, iliopsoas, and hip
adductors). Finally, players performed 4 × 40–50 m linear runs
with increasing intensity and speed, followed by two maximal
linear accelerations of 20 mm.
After the warm-up, all players performed three maximal
sprints of 40 m separated by 2–3 min of rest. Players started
in a standing start position with split legs, and the toes of
the front foot placed on the starting line 50 cm behind the
first photogates. The players started when ready. They were not

allowed to move their body backward before starting. The same
starting procedures were followed for the repeated sprint test.
Times were recorded using Brower equipment (Wireless
Sprint System, USA, accuracy of 0.01 s). The height of the first
photogates was 40 cm to avoid the hand of the player to start the
timer, whereas the photogates at 40 m were 60 cm high. Only the
best attempt was included in the analyses.
The 8 × 20 m Repeated Sprint Test
After a 10-min rest, players performed the repeated sprint test,
which consisted of 8 × 20 m sprint starting every 30 s. Players
were instructed to perform every sprint with maximal effort.
Times at 0–10 m (T10), 0–20 m (T20), and 10–20 m (T10−20)
were recorded using Brower equipment (Wireless Sprint System,
USA). The mean time for all eight runs, and the drop in speed
[(mean time of seventh and eighth runs) minus (mean time of
first and second runs)] was calculated (Psotta et al., 2005) to
evaluate the ability to maintain maximal speed during the test.
Counter movement Jump (CMJ)
The counter movement jump (CMJ) test was performed using a
Kistler 9286B force plate (Kistler Instruments AG, Winterthur,
Switzerland). From a standing position (with hands on hips
and a knee angle of 180◦), a countermovement was performed
(until a knee angle of ∼90◦), followed by an immediate jump.
The jumping height was calculated from take-off velocity (Dello
Iacono et al., 2016) using the Kistler MARS software. The best of
three attempts was used in the analyses.
Leg Strength
A five repetition maximum (RM) back squat test was used
to determine leg strength. The players started in an up-right
position, with parallel feet hip-width apart, and with an external
weight braced across the trapezius muscle or rear deltoid muscle
in the upper back. The back squat test started with a flexion of
the hip and knee joints. In the lowest position, the hip joints
had to be lower than the knee joints. The hip and knee joints
were fully extended between each repetition. The negative and the
positive phases of the lift took ∼2 s each. A standardized warm-
up protocol with increasing weight (10 repetitions with 20 kg, 8 ×
40 kg, 8 × 50 kg, 5 × 60 kg) was followed for all players. After the
warm-up players increased weight until 5 RM was reached. The
technique was supervised and approved by a physical trainer.
Body Composition
A direct segmental multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance
analysis (DSM-BIA) for determining body composition was
performed using the In-Body720 (Biospace Co. Ltd, Seoul,

Korea) body composition analyzer (Lim et al., 2009; Ling et al.,
2011; Tompuri et al., 2015). Standard procedures were followed
for all players. Body weight (kg) and body fat (%) were used in
the statistical analyses.
Maximal Oxygen Consumption
Gas exchange values were measured using an Oxycon Pro
apparatus (Jaeger GmbH, Hoechberg, Germany) with a mixing
chamber. The flowmeter was calibrated with a 3 L volume
syringe (Hans Rudolph Inc., Kansas City, MO). Before each
measurement, the volume of oxygen (VO2) and volume of
carbon dioxide (VCO2) gas analyzers were calibrated using high-
precision gases (16.00 ± 0.04% O2 and 5.00 ± 0.1% CO2,
Riessner-Gase GmbH & co, Lichtenfels, Germany). Heart rate
(HR) was measured with an HR monitor (Polar V800, Polar
Electro OY, Kempele, Finland), using a 5 s interval for data
storage. VO2max was defined as the highest 1 min average VO2
during the test. Maximal HR was defined as the highest value that
was attained on average over a 5 s period at the final stage of the
protocol. VO2 consumption, respiratory exchange ratio (RER),
volume of expired air (VE), velocity, and HR were recorded and
stored during the tests, whereas blood lactate concentration was
measured by taking samples from the fingertip using a Biosen
S-line (EKF diagnostics, Germany).
The test started with a 10-min warm up, running at 10 km·h−1
at an inclination of 1.7% on a motorized treadmill (Woodway
PPS 55, USA). VO2max was determined using an incremental
running test. The test began at 11 km·h−1 at an inclination of
5.2%, and the velocity was increased by 1 km·h−1 every 1 min
until exhaustion. Exhaustion was defined as meeting three of the
following four criteria (Bassett and Howley, 2000): (1) HR within
five beats of the participants self-reported HRmax; (2) Lactate level
above 8.0 mmol/l; (3) RER > 1.15; (4) VO2 consumption plateau,
or decrease in VO2 consumption with increasing work rate.
Hamstring Flexibility
Hamstring flexibility was measured using the sit and reach
test (Wells and Dillon, 1952; The Canadian Physical Activity
Fitness and Lifestyle Approach (CPAFLA), 2003) and the
straight leg raise test (Kendall and McCreary, 2005). Two
experienced physiotherapists supervised all of the tests, following
standardized test procedures. In the sit and reach test, the player
sat on the floor with knees extended. Shoes were removed and
the soles of the feet were placed flat against a standardized box
developed for the sit and reach test. The player slowly reached
forward with parallel arms, placing his hands as far as possible
forward on the box in front of his feet. With the help of a ruler
placed on the top of the box (scale 3), the player’s flexibility was
measured in cm. The player was instructed to reach as far as
possible and to hold the end position for 2 s. The test has been
recommended to measure hamstring flexibility (Mayorga-Vega
et al., 2014).
In the straight raise leg test, the player was in a supine start
position. One leg was passively moved into hip flexion until a firm
end-feel was ascertained. The knee of the moving leg was held
in extension during the whole movement, whereas the opposite
thigh was held down on the bench by the physiotherapist. The
angle (◦) between the bench and the femoral bone on the flexed
leg was measured by a goniometer, with the pivot point at the
trochanter major.
Questionnaire Data
All participants answered a questionnaire including questions
about age and experience of hamstring strain injuries during the
last 2 years (yes/no). Based on the answer regarding hamstring
strain injury, players were divided into two groups for the
statistical analyses: players who had suffered from hamstring
strain injury, and players who had not.
Statistical Analyses
Mean and SD was calculated for each variable. Visual inspection
of histograms confirmed that the data were normally distributed.
Independent sample t-tests were used to investigate any
differences in physical performance between players who had and
had not experienced hamstring strain injuries. Mixed between-
within subject’s analyses of variance, with one between group
factor (presence and absence of hamstring strain injury the last
2 years) and one within subjects/repeated-measures factor (8 ×
20 m sprints) were conducted to assess the effect of a former
hamstring strain injury on the player’s ability to perform repeated
sprints. The interaction effects (group × time) are reported.
When significant, an interaction effect indicates a different
development over time between the groups. Intraclass correlation
coefficient (ICC) analyses with a two-way mixed model and
absolute agreement were performed to evaluate the reliability
of the repeated sprint test. Typical error (SEM) was calculated
as SD/√(1-ICC) (Hopkins, 2000). Minimal detectable change,
reflecting the 95% confidence interval (MDC95), a statistical
estimate of the smallest amount of change that can be detected
by a measure that corresponds to a noticeable change in ability,
was calculated as SEM √2 × 1.96. Post-hoc power calculations
with two-tailed distribution and an alpha error level of 5% were
performed for the various tests. Significance levels were set at
<0.05. The Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS Statistics,
version 23) for Windows was used for all statistical analyses.
Ethics
The study followed the principles of the Helsinki declaration.
All players signed a written informed consent form and were
informed about the right to withdraw from the study at any
time. Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD) approved
the study.
RESULTS
Of the 75 players who performed the repeated sprint test, 16%
had reported hamstring strain injury during the 2 previous years.
An independent sample t-tests showed no significant difference
in age, height, body weight, or body fat percentage between
players who had and had not experienced hamstring strain injury
during the previous 2 years (Table 1).
Players reporting previous hamstring strain injuries showed
a significantly higher drop in speed (i.e., mean of the last two
runs minus mean of the first two runs) during the repeated

sprint test compared to those without hamstring strain injuries
during the previous 2 years (Table 2 and Figure 3). The mixed
between-within subject’s analyses of variance showed a significant
interaction (group × time) (F = 3.22, p = 0.002), indicating
that speed in the two groups changed differently during the
repeated sprint test. The ICC for average measures was 0.978
(95% confidence interval: 0.969–0.985), SEM was 0.008 s, and
MDC95 was ± 0.022 seconds. Post-hoc power analyses showed
a statistical power of 88.8%.
There was however, no significant difference in mean time
of the eight runs between the two groups. There was also no
significant difference in linear speed (statistical power of 70.1%),
in hamstring flexibility (SLR test: statistical power of 15.5%), or in
countermovement jump height (statistical power of 5.3%), the 5
RM squat test (statistical power of 8.5%) or in VO2max (statistical
power of 5.7%) between the two groups.
DISCUSSION
Our result showed that soccer players who reported previous
hamstring strain injury (16%) had a significantly higher drop
in speed during the repeated sprint test compared to players
reporting no hamstring strain injury.
Repeated sprinting ability is very important to succeed in
soccer (Ingebrigtsen et al., 2015). The higher drop in speed
during the repeated sprint test in players with previous hamstring
strain injury, may be related to neuromuscular fatigue and
insufficient rehabilitation. A recent study by Padulo et al. (2016)
showed increased neuromuscular fatigue, measured as reduced
jumping height after repeated sprints in players with previous
lower limb injuries. Increased neuromuscular fatigue was evident
even though the players had been cleared to return to play by
the team physician, and had completed a standard 3-month
rehabilitation program and a standard 3-month soccer-training
program (Padulo et al., 2016). There was no significant difference
in CMJ height between groups after the repeated sprint test in the
present study. This may be due to the use of different repeated
sprint test with different lower-limb muscle load or to different
time between the tests. The CMJ was performed immediately
after the repeated sprint test in the study by Padulo and colleague,
and ∼1 h after in the present study.
Padulo and colleagues reported however no difference
between players who had suffered from previous injury with
regard to repeated sprint performance, which differs from our
findings in the present study. This incongruence may be due to
the use of different repeated sprint tests (6 × 40 m shuttle runs vs.
8 × 20 m), and different ways of evaluating the results of the tests
(fatigue index vs. drop in speed). The muscular recruitment and
the biomechanical demands of the hamstring muscles is different
between sprints including acceleration, decelerations, and change
of directions compared to sprints only including accelerations
as in the present study. In addition, Padulo and colleagues
included players with a variety of lower limb injuries, whereas
we only included players with previous hamstring strain injuries.
Although Padulo and colleagues found no significant difference
in the repeated sprint performance, players with previous lower
limb injuries reported a significantly higher rate of perceived
exertion, indicating that they were more fatigued (Padulo et al.,
2016).
Neuromuscular fatigue has been suggested to be a potential
risk factor for muscle strain injury (Heiser et al., 1984; Worrell
et al., 1991; Mair et al., 1996; Woods et al., 2004; Ekstrand
et al., 2011b), indicating that insufficient rehabilitation after
a hamstring strain injury may increase the risk of re-injury.
Fatigue while playing a soccer match has been associated with
decreased eccentric hamstring strength (Worrell et al., 1991)
in healthy players. Another study has shown that intermittent
running, designed to mimic the demands of competitive soccer,
significantly reduces eccentric hamstring torque (Greig, 2008;
Small et al., 2009). Mair et al. (1996) confirm this finding in
a laboratory study, showing that pre-fatigue muscles absorbed
less energy before failure compared to unfatigued muscles,
indicating that a fatigued muscle may be more likely to suffer
from a strain injury due to its reduced capacity to resist over-
lengthening. It is claimed that those who exhibit greater levels
of eccentric hamstring fatigue may be at a greater risk of
hamstring strain injury, thus linking eccentric weakness and risk
of hamstring injury (Croisier et al., 2008; Sugiura et al., 2008).
The higher drop in speed during the repeated sprint test may
be an indication of increased disposition to hamstring muscle
fatigue in players with previous hamstring injury. Although
neuromuscular fatigue is also found in healthy players after a
soccer match, and after intermittent running designed to mimic
the demands of competitive soccer, the identification of fatigue
only after an 8 × 20 m repeated sprint test may indicate the need
for targeted reconditioning programs to ensure complete post-
injury rehabilitation in players recovering from hamstring strain
injury.
Inappropriate
hamstring
muscle
recruitment
patterns
(Schuermans et al., 2016) are suggested as factors linking
neuromuscular fatigue with the elevated risk of strain injuries
(Devlin, 2000). Schuermans et al. (2016) recently demonstrated
a causal relationship between the intramuscular recruitment
pattern and the risk of a secondary hamstring strain, indicating
that intermuscular interplay changes after hamstring strain
injury. Higher drop in speed in the repeated sprint test may
be related to insufficient rehabilitation due to changed muscle
recruitment pattern (Schuermans et al., 2016).
Previous studies have shown that the physiological and
mechanical demands associated with league soccer games
produce a time-dependent alteration in sprinting kinematics

(Pinniger et al., 2000; Small et al., 2009, 2010). An inappropriate
sprinting technique, per se, and a change in sprinting technique
due to fatigue may both be risk factors for hamstring strain
injury due to the increased eccentric hamstring muscle load.
Studies have shown that technical changes due to fatigue cause
greater strain on the hamstring muscle during the terminal
swing phase of the gait (Pinniger et al., 2000; Thelen et al.,
2005), with the consequence that repeated over-lengthening and
microscopic muscle damage may accumulate to a hamstring
strain injury (Morgan, 1990; Allen et al., 2010). The higher drop
in speed in players with previous hamstring strain injury may
be related to inappropriate sprinting technique or a change in
sprinting technique during the repeated sprint test. Inspection

Although information regarding previous hamstring strain

present study is in line with that previously reported in
comparable studies (Arnason et al., 2004; Woods et al., 2004;
Ekstrand et al., 2011b). Despite lack of clinical information
related to hamstring strain severity and location, our data
showed significant differences regarding drop in speed of players

reporting previous hamstring strain injury compared to players
reporting no previous hamstring strain injury. Based on the
above mention factors, we suggest that the drops in speed in the
repeated sprint test are an important and novel characteristic of
players with previous hamstring strain injury.
There was no significant difference in maximal speed,
countermovement jump height, leg strength, endurance capacity,
and hamstring flexibility between players who had and had
not suffered from hamstring strain injury. Hence, the above
mention factors do not seem to explain the significantly higher
drop in speed in players with previous hamstring strain injury.
However, we cannot conclude due to low statistical power.
It would be interesting in a future study also to evaluate
potential asymmetry between a previously injured leg and an
uninjured leg in strength, and to evaluate possible asymmetries
between knee flexors and extensors (Dello Iacono et al.,
2016).
CONCLUSION
A significantly higher drop in speed during repeated sprints
was observed in soccer players who reported previous hamstring
strain injury compared to players who did not. A repeated
sprint test consisting of 8 × 20 m could be used as a field-
based diagnostic tool to identify players who are in need of
targeted reconditioning programs to ensure complete post-injury
rehabilitation.
