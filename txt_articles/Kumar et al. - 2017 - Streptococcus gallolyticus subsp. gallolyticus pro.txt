Abstract
Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (Sg) has long been known to have a strong
association with colorectal cancer (CRC). This knowledge has important clinical implica-
tions, and yet little is known about the role of Sg in the development of CRC. Here we dem-
onstrate that Sg promotes human colon cancer cell proliferation in a manner that depends
on cell context, bacterial growth phase and direct contact between bacteria and colon can-
cer cells. In addition, we observed increased level of β-catenin, c-Myc and PCNA in colon
cancer cells following incubation with Sg. Knockdown or inhibition of β-catenin abolished the
effect of Sg. Furthermore, mice administered with Sg had significantly more tumors, higher
tumor burden and dysplasia grade, and increased cell proliferation and β-catenin staining in
colonic crypts compared to mice receiving control bacteria. Finally, we showed that Sg is
present in the majority of CRC patients and is preferentially associated with tumor compared
to normal tissues obtained from CRC patients. These results taken together establish for
the first time a tumor-promoting role of Sg that involves specific bacterial and host factors
and have important clinical implications.

 Author summary
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death. The recognition that
microbial agents can contribute to the development of CRC raises hope for improving
CRC diagnosis and treatment by incorporating both microbial and patient characteristics
into clinical strategies. S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (Sg) has been implicated in CRC
for decades. Patients with Sg infections display a much higher risk of having CRC com-
pared to the general population. Despite this, the precise role of Sg in the development of
CRC—i.e., whether this organism plays an active role in the development of tumor or its
presence is merely a consequence of the tumor environment being favorable for its coloni-
zation of the colon—was unknown. Here using in vitro cell cultures and mouse models of
CRC, we demonstrate that Sg actively promotes colon cancer cell proliferation and tumor
growth, suggesting that it is not an innocent “passenger”. These results represent a major
step forward in understanding the relationship between Sg and CRC. This combined with
the prevalence of Sg in CRC patients highlight Sg as being both clinically relevant and
functionally important for CRC.
Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second to third most common cancer and a leading cause of
cancer-related death [1,2]. The human gut is normally exposed to ~ 1014 microorganisms,
which are increasingly recognized as being intimately involved in the health and disease status
of the gut [3]. The identification of specific microbes driving colon tumorigenesis [4–9] raises
hope that we may exploit knowledge about specific tumor-promoting microbes to improve
cancer diagnosis, prevention and treatment [10–15].
Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (Sg) belongs to the Streptococcus bovis/Strepto-
coccus equinus complex (SBSEC) and was previously known as S. bovis biotype I [16,17]. This
is a Gram-positive, opportunistic pathogen that causes bacteremia and endocarditis in
humans. Patients with bacteremia/endocarditis due to Sg display a strong association with
CRC as shown in numerous case reports and case series [3,12–15,18–29]. A meta-analysis of
case reports and case series published between 1970 and 2010 found that patients with S. bovis
infections had ~60% chance of having concomitant colon adenomas/carcinomas [30], much
higher than that in the general population. The SBSEC group includes a number of closely
related species such as Sg, S. pasteurianus, S. macedonicus and S. infantarius [16,31]. Among
these different species, Sg infection has the strongest association with CRC (~ 7 fold higher risk
compared to infections caused by the other species), suggesting the existence of a Sg-specific
mechanism(s) that promotes the association between the pathogen and CRC. Other similar
studies consistently revealed elevated risks of colorectal adenoma/carcinoma for patients with
Sg infections [14,21–25,32]. These epidemiological studies clearly show a strong association
between Sg bacteremia/endocarditis and CRC. Due to the overwhelming clinical association, it
is recommended that patients with Sg infections undergo thorough colon examination. In
addition, recent prospective studies followed patients with endocarditis due to Sg or other
pathogens for several years and found that a significantly higher percentage of Sg endocarditis
patients developed new colonic neoplasm during the follow-up period, compared to patients
with endocarditis caused by other pathogens [33,34]. This suggests that Sg plays a role in the
early stages of tumor development. On the other hand, CRC patients may be colonized with Sg
in their colon with no signs of bacteremia or endocarditis [35,36], although the prevalence of

 Sg in CRC patients is not as well defined as the risk for CRC in patients with active Sg
infections.
Despite a strong clinical association between Sg and CRC, the role of Sg in CRC develop-
ment, i.e. whether it drives colon tumorigenesis or merely colonizes the colon tumor envi-
ronment, was unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of Sg on colon tumor
development using in vitro cultured human colon cancer cells and mouse models of CRC.
We demonstrated that Sg promoted colon cancer cell proliferation in a manner that depends
on the specific cell context, bacterial growth phase, and direct contact between bacteria and
colon cancer cells. In addition, we showed that Sg promoted cell proliferation by up-regulat-
ing β-catenin, a central signaling molecule in colon tumorigenesis. Exposure to Sg also
resulted in larger tumors in a xenograft model. In an azoxymethane (AOM)-induced mouse
model of CRC, mice given Sg had significantly higher tumor burden, higher average dysplasia
grade, increased cell proliferation and β-catenin level in colon crypts compared to control
mice. Lastly, we analyzed tumors and adjacent normal tissues from CRC patients. The results
indicate that Sg is present in the majority of CRC patients and preferentially associates with
tumor tissues. These results demonstrate a tumor-promoting role of Sg and have important
implications with respect to microbial contributions to CRC as well as clinical practices to
combat CRC.
Results
Sg promotes colon cancer cell proliferation
The overall effect of Sg on cell growth and proliferation was examined using a variety of cell
lines. Human colon cancer cell lines HCT116, HT29, LoVo, SW480, SW1116, normal human
colon epithelial cell lines FHC and CCD 841 CoN, human kidney epithelial cell HEK293 and
human lung cancer cell line A549 were co-cultured with Sg strains TX20005 and TX20030,
and Lactococcus lactis MG1363 (used as a negative control bacterial strain). The number of via-
ble cells was counted after 24 and 48 hours of incubation. We found that, in the presence of
the Sg strains, HCT116, HT29 and LoVo had significantly more viable cells than colon cancer
cells cultured in the presence of L. lactis or no bacteria (~ 50–60% more at 24 hours and ~ 20–
30% more at 48 hours) (Fig 1A–1C). Interestingly, we did not observe any increase in cell
numbers for the other cell lines tested including SW480, SW1116, A549, HEK293, CCD841
CoN, and FHC (Fig 1D–1I). These results suggest that Sg strains TX20005 and TX20030 pro-
mote colon cancer cell growth in a cell context-dependent manner. Therefore, we refer to
HT29, HCT116 and LoVo hereafter as “responsive” colon cancer cells, and the others as unre-
sponsive cells.
The increased number of viable cells after co-culture with Sg could be due to increased pro-
liferation, reduced apoptosis, or both. We therefore examined the effect of Sg on cell prolifera-
tion and apoptosis. Cells co-cultured with Sg or L. lactis were labeled with bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Co-culture with Sg TX20005 resulted in ~3 and
~ 1.7-fold increase in the percentage of S phase cells in HCT116 and HT29 cells, respectively,
compared to cells incubated with L. lactis or cells only control (Fig 2A and 2B and S1 Fig). No
significant changes in the percentage of S phase cells were observed in FHC cells following
incubation with TX20005, as compared to no bacteria or L. lactis-incubated FHC cells (Fig 2C,
S1 Fig). We further determined the level of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a marker
for cell proliferation [37], in cells incubated with Sg, L. lactis or cells only. The results showed
that HCT116 and HT29 cells incubated with TX20005 had significantly higher levels of PCNA
compared to cells co-cultured with L. lactis or cells only control (Fig 2D, 2E, 2G and 2H). No
difference was observed in the PCNA level in FHC cells between the different conditions, as

 expected (Fig 2F and 2I). These results indicate that Sg promotes cell proliferation in respon-
sive cells.
We next examined the effect of Sg on cell apoptosis in HCT116, HT29, and FHC cells co-
cultured with TX20005, L. lactis, or media only. The cells were stained with anti-Annexin V
antibodies and propidium iodide followed by flow cytometry analysis. No significant differ-
ence was observed in the percentage of apoptotic cells between the different groups in any of
the cell lines (Fig 2J–2L and S2 Fig). To further confirm this, we compared the level of cleaved
caspase 3 and observed no difference between the different conditions in any of the cell lines
tested (S3 Fig). Taken together, these results indicate that Sg does not affect cell apoptosis, but
promotes colon cancer cell proliferation in a cell context-dependent manner.
Fig 1. Sg stimulates cell proliferation in responsive colon cancer cell lines. Human colon cancer cell lines HCT116 (A), HT29 (B),
LoVo (C), SW480 (D), and SW1116 (E), human lung cancer cell line A549 (F), human kidney epithelial cell line HEK293 (G), and normal
human colon epithelial cell lines CCD841CoN (H) and FHC (I) were tested. Cells were seeded into the wells of 6-well plates at 1x104 cells
per well and incubated for 12 hours. Stationary phase bacteria were washed with sterile phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS) and
resuspended in the appropriate cell culture media. Bacterial suspension or media only were then added to the wells at 1x102 cfu/well, and
incubated for 24 or 48 hours. Cells were stained with trypan blue and counted in an automated cell counter. Each experiment was done with
duplicate wells and repeated at least three times. Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Two-way, two-tailed
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) test was used to analyze the data. Significance shown in panels

 The proliferation-promoting effect of Sg is Sg-specific and depends on
bacterial growth phase and direct contact between bacteria and
responsive cells
We next examined the effect of an expanded panel of bacterial strains on HT29 and HCT116.
The panel included Sg strains TX20005, TX20030 and TX20031, and strains of closely related
species within the SBSEC—S. infantarius (TX20012), S. macedonicus (TX20026), and S. pas-
teurianus (TX20027). E. coli strain XL-1 Blue and L. lactis were included as negative control
bacteria. All three Sg strains significantly increased HT29 and HCT116 cell numbers at 24 (Fig
3A and 3D) and 48 hour (S4A and S4B Fig) time points, whereas none of the other bacterial
strains had any effect.

and HCT116 (E) cells and co-cultured for 24 hours. Viable cell numbers were enumerated. C and F. Promotion of cell proliferation requires
direct contact between Sg and responsive cells. Stationary phase TX20005 bacteria were added to transwell inserts (0.4 μm pore)
(TX20005-TW) or directly to cells and co-cultured with HT29 (C) and HCT116 (F) cells for 24 and 48 hours. Viable cell numbers were
enumerated. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. Each experiment was done with duplicate wells and was repeated at least three times.
Data in panels A and D were analyzed using one-way, two-tailed ANOVA, followed by SNK test. Data in panels B and E were analyzed by
unpaired, two-tailed t test, stationary phase vs. exponential phase. Data in panels C and F were analyzed using two-way, two-tailed ANOVA
followed by SNK test. Significance shown in C and F is for comparison between cells co-cultured with TX2005 directly and cells cultured with
TX20005-TW. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01.

 Bacterial growth under co-culture conditions were determined (S5 Fig). There was no sig-
nificant difference in the growth curve between the different strains as analyzed by ANOVA.
TX20026 showed virtually the same growth curve as TX20005. For TX20012, TX20027 and
L. lactis, the bacterial counts were lower than TX20005 at 6 hours. However, there was no sig-
nificant difference in the bacterial counts between these strains and TX20005 after 6 hours.
In the co-culture experiments described above, the bacteria added to the wells were from
stationary phase cultures. We examined the effect of exponential phase cultures of TX20005,
TX20030 and L. lactis on HT29 and HCT116 cells. In contrast to stationary phase bacteria,
exponential phase TX20005 or TX20030 did not cause any significant increase in HT29 (Fig
3B) or HCT116 (Fig 3E) cell numbers at 24 hours compared to the no bacteria controls. Thus,
the results suggest that the ability of Sg to promote cell proliferation is growth phase-
dependent.
We next examined whether secreted bacterial factors or bacterial metabolites in the culture
supernatant were sufficient to promote colon cancer cell growth. Supernatants from stationary
phase cultures of TX20005, TX20030 and E. coli were collected and filtered to remove any
residual bacteria. HT29 and HCT116 cells were cultured in media only or media supplemented
with the culture supernatants. Bacterial culture supernatants were insufficient to promote cell
proliferation in HT29 and HCT116 cells (S6A and S6B Fig). The inability of Sg culture super-
natants to stimulate host cell proliferation could be due to the possibility that the proliferation-
promoting effect of Sg required bacteria to directly contact host cells. It could also be due to
that the factors/metabolites in the culture supernatants were unstable and required a continu-
ous presence of live bacteria in the culture. To distinguish these two possibilities, we used a
transwell system in which bacteria were cultured in inserts with permeable membranes of
0.4 μm pore size. This pore size allows the passage of secreted bacterial factors and metabolites
but not bacteria. Culturing Sg bacteria in transwells resulted in a complete loss of the prolifera-
tion-promoting effect of TX20005 on both HT29 and HCT116 cells (Fig 3C and 3F). HT29
cells were also incubated with either heat-killed bacteria or bacterial lysates, prepared from sta-
tionary phase culture. We did not observe any increase in the cell number compared to the
control group under either treatment conditions (S7 Fig), suggesting that live bacteria are nec-
essary to produce the observed effect on proliferation shown in Fig 1.
Taken together, these results suggest that the proliferation-promoting effect of Sg is depen-
dent on Sg-specific factors, bacterial growth phase and direct contact between live bacteria and
responsive cells.
Adherence of Sg to both responsive and unresponsive cells
Since direct contact between bacteria and cancer cells is required to promote cell proliferation,
we investigated the ability of Sg to adhere to responsive and unresponsive cell lines. The results
showed that both TX20005 and TX20030 adhered to HCT116, HT29, and A549 cells at a simi-
lar level (~ 20% of the initial inoculum) and slightly higher to SW1116 and SW480 (~ 30% of
the initial inoculum). Adherence to CCD 841 CoN colonic epithelial cells was significantly
lower than to the colon cancer cell lines (~15% of the initial inoculum) (S8A Fig). The ability
of Sg strains to invade these cells was also investigated using gentamicin protection assay.
Hardly any intracellular bacteria were detected, suggesting that the two Sg strains are poorly or
non-invasive (S8B Fig). We further investigated the adherence ability of stationary and expo-
nential phase TX20005 and TX20030. Exponential phase TX20005 and TX20030 adhered to
HCT116 cells significantly less than stationary phase bacteria (S8C Fig).
Together these results suggest that the ability of Sg to adhere to responsive cells is also
growth phase-dependent, consistent with the growth phase-dependency observed in cell

 proliferation assays. On the other hand, Sg strains are able to adhere to unresponsive cells as
well as to responsive cells, suggesting there may be multiple interactions between Sg and differ-
ent cell lines.
Sg promotes cell proliferation in a β-catenin dependent manner
The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway regulates cell fate and proliferation and is a critical path-
way in colon tumorigenesis [38–40]. We investigated the effect of Sg on β-catenin in respon-
sive and unresponsive cells. For HCT116 and HT29 cells, co-culture with TX20005 led to a
significantly elevated level of total β-catenin compared to cells co-cultured with L. lactis or no
bacteria after 12 hours of incubation (Fig 4A–4D). In contrast, no increase in β-catenin level
was observed in unresponsive FHC, SW480 and SW1116 cells following Sg co-culture (Fig 4E,
4F, 4H and 4I). In addition, Sg had no effect on the level of β-catenin in A549 cells (S9 Fig).
Upon activation, β-catenin is translocated into the nuclei and triggers the enhanced expression
of downstream targets, such as c-Myc and cyclin D1 [41]. We examined the level of nuclear β-
catenin. The results showed that HCT116 and HT29 cells co-cultured with TX20005 had sig-
nificantly increased nuclear β-catenin compared to cells co-cultured with L. lactis or cells only
(Fig 4A–4D). No change in nuclear β-catenin was observed in FHC cells under the same
experimental conditions (Fig 4E and 4F). In accordance with this observation, the level of c-
Myc (Fig 4A–4D) and cyclin D1 (Fig 4G) in HCT116 and HT29 was also significantly
increased following co-culture with TX20005 compared to that in the control groups (Fig 4A–
4D). No increase in the level of c-Myc (Fig 4E and 4F) or cyclin D1 (Fig 4G) was observed in
FHC cells, as expected. In A549 cells, we also observed no changes in the level of c-Myc (S9
Fig). Taken together, these results suggest that incubation of responsive cells with Sg results in
up-regulation of β-catenin and its oncogenic downstream targets.
To determine the role of β-catenin in Sg-mediated cell proliferation, β-catenin stable knock-
down cells were generated using two specific shRNA. Knockdown was confirmed using west-
ern blot assays (S10A Fig). In co-culture experiments, β-catenin knockdown completely
abolished the effect of Sg on cell proliferation, whereas cells transfected with control shRNA
showed a similar increase in cell numbers as untransfected cells (Fig 5A and S10B Fig). To fur-
ther confirm this, we used a β-catenin responsive transcription (CRT) inhibitor iCRT3, which
disrupts β-catenin-TCF4 interaction [42]. In the presence of iCRT3, TX20005 co-culture with
HT29 cells did not increase cell proliferation compared to the control groups (Fig 5B). We
next examined the effect of TX20005 on the level of c-Myc and PCNA in the presence of
iCRT3. Treatment of HT29 cells with iCRT3 significantly reduced the effect of TX20005 on c-
Myc and PCNA expression (Fig 5C and 5D). To determine if β-catenin knockdown or iCRT3
treatment affected bacterial adherence to HT29 cells, we performed adherence assays. We did
not observe any significant change in the adherence of TX20005 to either β-catenin knock-
down cells or cells treated with iCRT3 compared to untransfected or untreated cells (S10C
Fig). Taken together, these results indicate that promotion of cell proliferation by Sg is through
up-regulation of β-catenin dependent signaling.
Sg promotes tumor growth in a xenograft model
HCT116 cells cultured with TX20005 or L. lactis were injected into nude mice and tumor
growth monitored (Fig 6A). Starting from day 13, TX20005-treated cells formed significantly
larger tumors than L. lactis-treated cells. Expression of β-catenin, c-Myc and PCNA was ana-
lyzed in tumors obtained at day 21 (Fig 6B and 6C). A significant increase in the levels of β-
catenin, c-Myc and PCNA were observed in tumors from TX20005-treated cells compared to
those from L. lactis-treated cells. We also tested the effect of Sg using the non-responsive

 SW480 cells. The results showed that TX20005-treated SW480 cells did not form bigger
tumors compared to cells treated with L. lactis (S11 Fig). These results indicate that TX20005
treatment promoted tumor growth in the xenograft model, and that this growth promotion
requires responsive cells.

 Sg promotes colon tumor development in an AOM-induced mouse
model of CRC
To further evaluate the role of Sg in the development of colon tumor, we used an AOM-
induced mouse model of CRC. This model is commonly used to represent sporadic CRC.
Mice were treated with 2 doses of AOM followed by antibiotic treatment for a week and then
orally gavaged with TX20005, L. lactis or saline for 24 weeks. Colons were harvested for visual
examination for macroscopic tumors. Overall, most of the tumors were found in the distal por-
tion of the colon. We observed that Sg-treated mice had higher tumor burden compared to
both the saline and L. lactis control groups (Fig 7A).
H&E stained colon sections were evaluated. Colons from Sg-treated mice showed a signifi-
cantly higher average dysplasia grade compared to those from L. lactis-treated or saline control
mice (Fig 7B). Adenocarcinomas were observed in Sg-treated mice but not in the control
groups (Fig 7C). We next examined cell proliferation and apoptosis in mouse colonic crypt
cells. Sg-treated mice had a significantly higher percentage of proliferating cells (BrdU+) in the
colonic crypts compared to L. lactis- or saline-treated control groups (Fig 7D and 7E). In addi-
tion, Sg-treated mice had higher levels of β-catenin in the colon epithelium as compared to
L. lactis-treated or saline controls (Fig 7F). In contrast, we did not observe any significant dif-
ference in the percentage of apoptotic cells between the different treatment groups as deter-
mined by TUNEL assays (Fig 7G, S12 Fig). These results are consistent with the observations
from our in vitro cell culture assays.
Inflammation in the colon of mice was also scored. Both Sg- and L. lactis-treated groups dis-
played significantly higher average inflammation scores compared to the saline group. How-
ever, overall inflammation in these groups was mild and there was no apparent difference
between the Sg- and L. lactis-treated groups (Fig 7H). We further measured the level of cyto-
kines TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, IL23 and Cox-2 in tumor and normal tissues collected from
the mouse colon using RT-qPCR. There was no significant difference between TX20005 and
L. lactis treated groups in any of the cytokines tested (S13 Fig). These results suggest that Sg
and L. lactis trigger similar inflammatory responses.

xenografts had higher levels of β-catenin, c-Myc and PCNA compared to L. lactis-treated ones. Tumors were collected on day 21. Three
tumors were randomly selected from each group. Protein extracts were analyzed by western blot assays (B). Protein level was normalized
to β-actin first and then to L. lactis-treated controls (C). Data is presented as the mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was done using unpaired,

 We further tested the effect of Sg on tumor development using a different shorter proce-
dure, in which mice were treated with four doses of AOM and gavaged with bacteria for 12
weeks. Similar to the results from the first longer procedure, a significant increase in tumor
numbers was observed in Sg-treated mice compared to the saline control (S14A Fig). When
compared to the L. lactis group, mice gavaged with TX20005 also had more tumors; however,
the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.08). Tumor burden also displayed a similar
trend as that observed in the longer procedure, in which Sg-treated mice had a higher average
tumor burden than the other two groups (S14B Fig). In the shorter procedure, however, the
difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.06 vs. L. lactis-treated mice) perhaps due to
reduced duration, less bacterial gavage or more AOM injections in this second procedure.
Overall, results from the two procedures show a consistent trend pointing towards Sg acting as
a promotional agent for tumor development in the mouse colon.
To determine whether the abundance of TX20005 in the colon correlates with tumor num-
ber or burden in the mice, we collected fecal material from mice at the end of the 12-week
gavage experiment. Relative abundance of Sg was determined by qPCR using Sg specific prim-
ers. We observed positive and statistically significant correlations between the relative abun-
dance of TX20005, tumor number (Fig 8A, Pearson’s r = 0.77, p = 0.001), and tumor burden
(Fig 8B, Pearson’s r = 0.60, p = 0.02), respectively. We further stained colon sections from mice
treated with Sg or saline with anti-Sg antiserum. The antiserum was tested against strains of
closely related species in SBSEC, as well as Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli, and L. lactis. The anti-
serum specifically recognized Sg but not the other strains (S15 Fig). In colon sections, we
observed positive staining in Sg-treated mice but not in the saline control (Fig 8C and 8D), fur-
ther indicating that the antiserum was specific. Sg bacteria were found within tumor tissues.
The presence of Sg around normal-looking crypts was observed only occasionally, suggesting a
preferential association of Sg with tumor tissues. Taken together, the results described above
suggest that Sg promotes colon tumor development in the AOM-induced mouse model of
CRC and this promotion involves up-regulation of β-catenin and increased colonic crypt cell
proliferation.
S. gallolyticus is present in the majority of CRC patients and
preferentially associates with tumor tissues
While the association between patients with bacteremia/endocarditis caused by Sg and CRC is
well documented, this population only represents a small proportion of CRC patients. Previous
studies indicated that CRC patients might be “silently” infected with Sg in their colon with no
symptoms of bacteremia or endocarditis [35,36]. However, the prevalence of Sg in CRC
patients has not been extensively studied. We analyzed 148 tumors and 128 adjacent matched
normal tissues from CRC patients by qPCR using Sg-specific primers. Overall, we found that
~74% of tumor tissues and ~47% of the normal tissues were positive for Sg (p < 0.0001, tumor
vs. normal, Fisher’s exact test), suggesting that Sg is present in the majority of CRC patients
and preferentially associates with tumor tissues. We further divided the positive samples into
those with relatively high or low abundance of Sg. More tumor tissues were highly enriched
with Sg (26%) than normal tissues (9%) (p = 0.0025, Fisher’s exact test), indicating a higher
bacterial abundance in the tumor tissues (Table 1). Streptococcus pasterianus (Sp), previously
were also stained for β-catenin (F). Apoptosis was assessed by performing TUNEL assays (G). H&E stained colon sections were also
evaluated for inflammation and average inflammation score for each treatment group is shown (H). n = 5 for saline, n = 7 for L. lactis and
TX20005, respectively. All colon evaluation was done by blinded observers. Data is presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was
performed using one-way, two-tailed ANOVA followed by SNK test. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; ****, p < 0.0001.

 S. bovis biotype II, is closely related to Sg however; patients with bacteremia or endocarditis
due to Sp did not display a strong association to CRC as that reported for Sg in epidemiological
studies [19,43,44]. The prevalence of Sp in CRC patients with no signs of bacteremia or endo-
carditis is unknown. We examined a small subset of randomly selected tumor and matched
normal tissues using Sp-specific primers. The results showed that only 11% of tumor tissues
(n = 27) and 7% of normal tissues (n = 27) were Sp positive, significantly lower than that of Sg
(p < 0.0001, Fisher’s exact test) (Table 2). Thus the high prevalence in CRC patients is
observed for Sg but not for a closely related organism. Taken together, these results suggest
that Sg is present in the majority of CRC patients and preferentially associates with tumor
tissues.
Tissue sections of tumors from CRC patients were stained using Sg-specific antibodies to
visualize the bacteria. We examined 4 normal and 21 tumor samples from CRC patients. Sg
was detected in one of the normal samples (25%), and in 10 of the tumor samples (48%). Sg
were seen attached to tumor tissues (Fig 9). This result is consistent with our in vitro observa-
tion that proximity of Sg to colon epithelial cells is critical for its effect on cell proliferation.
Discussion
CRC is the second to third most common cancer and a leading cause of cancer death in the
world. Annually, over a million people are diagnosed with CRC and ~700,000 die due to CRC
[45]. In recent years, the role of microbial agents in the development of CRC has gained
increasing recognition, raising hope that we may be able to exploit the knowledge on how
microbes modulate the development of CRC to improve CRC diagnosis, prevention and treat-
ment. To achieve this goal, a clear understanding of how precisely microbes exert their influ-
ence on tumor development is important. Sg infections have long been known to display a
strong association with CRC, and yet virtually nothing was known about the nature of this
association—i.e., whether this organism plays an active role in tumor development or its pres-
ence is merely a consequence of the tumor environment being favorable for its colonization—
was unknown. The results described in this study demonstrate a tumor-promoting role of Sg
that is dependent on cell context, specific bacterial factors, direct contact with colon cancer
cells, and β-catenin signaling. We further show that Sg is present in the majority of CRC
patients and preferentially associates with tumor tissues. Taken together, these findings high-
light the importance of Sg in the development of CRC that extends far beyond previous
recognitions.
That Sg promotes cell proliferation in responsive cells is based on the following results.
Responsive cells co-cutlured with Sg had significantly higher number of viable cells, higher
percentage of cells in S phase, higher level of PCNA, β-catenin (both total and nuclear), c-Myc
and cyclin D1, compared to cells cultured in media only or with negative control bacteria. Sg
did not affect the level of β-catenin or c-Myc in unresponsive cells. In addition, Sg did not
affect cell apoptosis, as shown by a lack of sigficannt difference in annexin V staining or the
level of cleaved caspase 3 between cells co-cultured with Sg and those with media only or with
negative control bacteria.

 Our results also provide evidence indicating that β-catenin is functionally important for Sg
stimulated cell proliferation. Knockdown of β-catenin in responsive cells by two independent
shRNA abolished Sg’s effect on cell proliferation. Treatment of cells with a β-catenin inhibitor
iCRT3, which blocks the interaction between β-catenin and its partner transcriptional factor,
also abolished Sg’s effect on cell proliferation, c-Myc and PCNA. Thus, Sg promotes the prolif-
eration of responsive cells in a β-catenin dependent manner. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling
pathway regulates cell proliferation and cell fate. Dysregulation of this pathway plays a central
role in the development of CRC [46–50]. It is highly pertinent, therefore, that Sg also targets
this critical pathway. The upstream events leading to the activation of β-catenin signaling
upon exposure to Sg are unknown and are the focus of on-going studies in our laboratory.
Studies on other tumor-promoting bacteria indicate that diverse strategies are used to influ-
ence β-catenin signaling. For example, Fusobacterium nucleatum modulates β-catenin signal-
ing by binding to E-cadherin through its FadA adhesin [5]. Bacteroides fragilis secretes a zinc-
dependent metalloprotease toxin that cleaves E-cadherin, leading to nuclear translocation of
β-catenin, increased c-Myc expression and cell proliferation [51]. Helicobacter pylori, which is
an important cause for gastric cancer, activates β-catenin signaling in multiple ways including

 affecting the expression of Wnt ligands [52], activating Wnt receptors [53], suppressing
GSK3β [54,55], interfering with β-catenin/TCF4 complex by downregulating the gastric tumor
suppressor Runx3 [56–58], and interacting with E-cadherin to disrupt the E-cadherin/β-cate-
nin complex [59]. In addition, there have been numerous studies in recent years linking
microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation to CRC (recent reviews [60–64]). Evidence suggests that
microbes (e.g., H. pylori, Citrobacter rodentium, and human papillomavirus (HPV)) can regu-
late β-catenin signaling and cell proliferation by affecting certain miRNAs [65–67]. However,
Sg does not appear to encode any homologs to any bacterial factor known to modulate β-cate-
nin or cell proliferation [68–71], suggesting the involvement of a potentially novel mechanism.
The observation that some colon cancer cell lines (SW480 and SW1116) as well as a lung
cancer cell line A549 are not responsive to the effect of Sg suggests that Sg functions by engag-
ing host factors specific to the responsive cells. All five of the colon cancer cell lines we tested
contain mutations in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway; HT29, LoVo, SW480 and SW1116
have mutations in APC whereas HCT116 contains a mutated version of β-catenin that results
in increased protein stability [72,73]. Sg further increases β-catenin level in HT29, HCT116,
and LoVo, but not in SW480 and SW1116 cells. It is possible that Sg up-regulates β-catenin at
a more upstream level or by affecting factors outside the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling
pathway. The fact that TX20005 adheres to unresponsive colon cancer cells as well as, or even
better than, responsive cells suggests that the differential effects of Sg on responsive and unre-
sponsive cells are not due to differences in the amount of bacteria adhering to these cells.
Rather, whether or how the signal is transduced from the cell surface where Sg is attached is
likely to be responsible for the difference. It is also possible that Sg adheres to different recep-
tors on responsive and unresponsive cells. Overall, our results suggest that the effect of Sg
depends on specific cell context. This implies that not everyone colonized by Sg may be equally
affected; some individuals with certain genetic or epigenetic makeup may be more susceptible
to the tumor-promoting effect of Sg than others. Identifying host factors that render cells
responsive to Sg will be important.
The observation that bacterial species closely related to Sg failed to stimulate cell prolifera-
tion in vitro suggests the involvement of Sg-specific factors in this process. This finding is con-
sistent with previous clinical observations that among the closely related species in the S. bovis
group, Sg displays a particularly strong association with CRC. Our results also suggest that
direct contact between Sg and responsive cells is required for Sg’s effect on cell proliferation.
We observed that Sg culture supernatants or Sg cultured in transwell inserts were unable to
stimulate cell proliferation. Furthermore, heat-killed Sg or Sg lysates had no effect on the prolif-
eration of responsive cells. These results suggest that direct contact or close proximity of live
Sg to host target cells is required for its stimulation of cell proliferation. We do need to point
out that with respect to the requirement of live Sg, we cannot exclude the possibility that the
relevant Sg factor(s) is inactivated during the heating or bacterial lysis process. The results also
show that both adherence to responsive cells and promotion of cell proliferation by Sg depend
on bacterial growth phase. Taken together, these results suggest several possibilities. Firstly, it
is possible that adherence and promotion of cell proliferation is mediated by the same Sg sur-
face factor(s) up-regulated in bacterial stationary phase. Secondly, it is possible that adherence
brings Sg close to the surface of responsive cells. Subsequent actions by other Sg surface or
secreted factors then promote cell proliferation. A third possibility is that adherence of Sg to
responsive cells results in the up-regulation or activation of other Sg surface or secreted factors,
which in turn stimulate cell proliferation. Studies are on-going to identify Sg factors involved
in cell adherence and stimulation of cell proliferation. It was reported previously that an Sg
mutant deficient of the Pil3 pilus was significantly impaired in the ability to adhere to mucus-
producing cells and to colonize mouse distal colon compared to a Pil3 overexpressing Sg

 variant strain [74]. The Pil3 pilus has been shown to bind intestinal mucins and fibrinogen
[75]. Sg also expresses a collagen binding protein Acb that mediates binding to collagen I, IV
and V [70]. The genome of Sg encodes proteins with homology to fibrinogen/fibronectin bind-
ing proteins and major cell surface adhesion pac, as well as additional pilus operons [68,69].
These surface proteins can potentially play a role in Sg adherence to host target cells and/or
colonization of the mouse colon.
The results from mouse models suggest that Sg promotes tumor development. Sg-treated
responsive cells developed larger tumors in a mouse xenograft model than cells treated with
control bacteria L. lactis. Higher levels of β-catenin, c-Myc and PCNA were also observed in
Sg-treated xenografts compared to L. lactis-treated ones. In the AOM CRC model, mice treated
with Sg had more tumors and higher tumor burden compared to L. lactis or saline-treated
mice. This was confirmed using two different experimental procedures. In addition, Sg-treated
mice had a higher percentage of proliferating cells and stronger β-catenin staining in colonic
crypts compared to the control mice. Apoptosis in colon epithelial cells of Sg-treated mice was
similar to that in L. lactis-treated mice. These findings are consistent with the results from cell
culture assays. Furthermore, we observed a significant and positive correlation between Sg bac-
terial burden in the mouse colon and tumor number and burden, respectively, suggesting a
dose effect. Finally, Sg bacteria were detected within tumor tissues from the AOM CRC model
and were seen directly associated with tumor tissues from CRC patients. These results are con-
sistent with the in vitro finding and suggest that Sg promotes tumor development by adhering
to or in close proximity with tumor.
The observation that Sg and L. lactis induced similar levels of inflammatory responses sug-
gests that Sg-induced immune responses may not play a major role in Sg-mediated tumor pro-
motion. However, this does not exclude the possibility that Sg may induce specific types of
immune reactions that favor tumor development or Sg’s promotion of tumor development
requires a certain component of the immune system. In addition, the role of microbiota in Sg-
mediated tumor promotion remains unclear. The results here suggest a direct effect of Sg on
colon epithelial cells. However, whether Sg functions in concert with other microbial agents in
the gut or elicits specific responses when mixed with certain other microbes is unknown. It is
also unclear whether Sg plays a role in tumor initiation, since all mice were treated with AOM.
Further studies are needed to clarify these issues. Overall, the results presented here support a
model in which Sg actively promotes colon tumor growth. This promotion appears to involve
up-regulation of β-catenin by Sg, resulting in increased cell proliferation.
Previous epidemiology studies have primarily focused on CRC risks for patients with bac-
teremia/endocarditis due to Sg. These patients only constitute a small proportion of CRC
patients. Limited information was available on the prevalence of Sg in CRC patients with no
signs of infections [35,36]. Abdulamir et al. studied 52 CRC patients without symptoms of bac-
teremia and found that approximately 33% of tumors and 23% of matched normal colon tis-
sues were Sg-positive when a conventional PCR method was used for the detection of Sg [36].
A recent study investigated the presence of S. bovis group organisms in the colonic suction
fluid from individuals who underwent colonoscopy [35]. S. bovis was isolated from each of the
17 patients diagnosed with malignant tumors. However, it was not clear if the S. bovis isolates
were Sg or other species within the S. bovis group. Here we analyzed 148 tumor and 128
matched adjacent normal tissues from CRC patients and showed that ~ 74% of CRC patients
were Sg positive and that Sg preferentially associates with tumor tissues. The difference in Sg
prevalence between this study and others could be due to the different detection methods
used, patient characteristics and/or the fact that samples were collected from different geo-
graphical regions (Malaysia [36], Israel [35], and United States (this study), respectively).
Despite the difference, these studies appear to have a common theme–Sg is present in a much

 larger proportion of CRC patients than previously recognized and preferentially associates
with tumor tissues. More extensive epidemiology studies are needed to further define the prev-
alence of Sg in CRC patients and its correlation with clinical, pathological and molecular char-
acteristics of CRC. Overall, the results taken together indicate that a large proportion of CRC
patients are “silently” infected with Sg. This information combined with our finding that Sg
actively promotes tumor growth further highlights the clinical importance of this organism.
Previous studies have shown that S. bovis or Sg was isolated from fecal cultures in approxi-
mately 10% of healthy individuals [27,36]. The factors that affect Sg abundance in healthy
individuals are unclear. It is plausible that host factors, gut microbiome composition and anti-
biotics usage can all have an impact. The prevalence of Sg in healthy individuals is lower than
that in CRC patients. It was found that metabolites produced by colon cancer cells facilitate Sg
outgrowth, resulting in a significant growth advantage of Sg over other bacteria in a simulated
colon tumor microenvironment [76]. This could be a possible explanation for the higher prev-
alence of Sg in CRC patients. It is also possible that as tumors develop in the colon, changes in
the inflammatory status and microbiome composition creates a colon environment that favors
Sg survival and growth. Altered expression of surface proteins on tumor cells may also facilitate
Sg adherence to the cells and colonization of the colon tissue.
In summary, this is the first report demonstrating a tumor-promoting role of Sg. The find-
ings here have important clinical implications. Going forward, identifying the Sg factor(s)
responsible for promoting cell proliferation and tumor development, and host factors targeted
by Sg, will be critical for understanding how Sg functions as a tumor-promoting agent and for
developing optimized strategies based on both bacterial and host characteristics to better diag-
nose and treat CRC.
Methods and materials

S. bovis group strains (S. gallolyticus, S. pasteurianus, S. infantarius, S. macedonicus) [70], Lacto-
coccus lactis MG1363 (provided by Timothy J. Foster, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland), and
E. coli XL-1 Blue were grown at 37˚C in brain-heart infusion (BHI) broth with shaking or on
BHI agar (Difco Laboratories, Sparks, MD). Starter cultures were prepared by growing strains
overnight in 3 ml BHI broth. Fresh BHI broth was then inoculated with the overnight culture
at 1:100 ratio. Cells were harvested at 0.5 OD600nm for exponential phase bacteria and at 1.0
OD600nm for stationary phase bacteria.
Cell lines and growth conditions
Human colon cancer cell lines HCT116, HT29, LoVo, SW1116, SW480 and kidney epithelial
cell line HEK293 (obtained from Dr. Scott Koptetz, Universoity of Texas M. D. Anderson Can-
cer Center, Houston, Texas and Cheryl L Walker, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston,
Texas) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, GIBCO, USA) supple-
mented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (GIBCO, USA). Human normal colon epithelial
cell lines CCD 841 CoN and FHC were cultured in DMEM/F12 (GIBCO, USA) supplemented
with 15% FBS (GIBCO, USA). Human lung carcinoma cell line A549 was maintained in
F12-K media supplemented with 10% FBS. SW480, CCD 841 CoN, FHC, and A549 were pur-
chased from ATCC. All of the cells were cultured in a humidified incubation chamber at 37˚C
with 5% CO2. HT29 stable knockdown cells were established by infecting cells with Lentiviral
Transduction Particles containing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against CTNNB1 (Sigma-
Aldrich, TRCN0000314991 and TRCN0000314990) or MISSION pLKO.1-puro Non-Mamma-

 lentiviral CTNNB1 shRNA plasmid or a non-mammalian shRNA control plasmid were trans-
fected into HEK293T cells to produce lentiviral particles. Gene knockdown was confirmed by
Western blot assays. All cell lines were validated based on short tandem repeats (Characterized
Cell Line Core Facility, University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX).
Cell proliferation assays
Cells were seeded onto the wells of 6-well plates at 1x104 cells per well and incubated for 12
hours. Exponential or stationery phase bacteria were washed with sterile phosphate buffered
saline, pH 7.4 (PBS), resuspended in the appropriate cell culture media, added to the wells at
1x102 cfu/well, and incubated for 24 or 48 hours. Antibiotic trimethoprim was added at
50 μg/ml final concentration after 24 hours of incubation to prevent media acidification due to
bacterial growth. Trimethoprim is generally bacteriostatic for Gram-positive bacteria [77]. We
have also confirmed that at the concentration we used, trimethoprim is bacteriostatic and does
not kill Sg. Cells were detached by trypsin treatment, stained with trypan blue and counted in a
Cellometer1 Mini automated cell counter (Nexcelome Biosciences, Lawrence, MA). Transwell
experiments were performed as described above except that bacteria were cultured in Trans-
well inserts (Corning) with 0.4 μm pore size, which allows the passage of secreted factors
and soluble metabolites but not bacteria. Each experiment was performed in duplicate and
repeated at least three times. Treatment of cells with iCRT3 was based on a protocol previously
described [78]. Briefly, 25 μM of iCRT3 (Sigma) was added to the cells 1 hour before the addi-
tion of bacteria. Fresh inhibitor was added every 4 hours subsequently until the end of the
experiment. iCRT3 has no effect on the growth of L. lactis or Sg. To determine the effect of
bacterial culture supernatants, stationary phase cultures grown in BHI were centrifuged and
supernatants collected and filtered through a 0.2 μm filter to remove residual bacteria. 0.5 ml
of a supernatant was added to each well in a 6-well culture plate.
To prepared heat killed bacteria, bacterial cells from stationary phase were incubated at
95˚C for 30 mins. Bacterial lysate was prepared by using a cell disruptor (Constant Systems
Ltd, UK). 100 ml of stationary phase bacterial culture was pelleted and resuspended in 10 ml
PBS and then processed in the cell disruptor.
Adherence and internalization assays
This was performed following a procedure described previously with slight modifications [79].
Cells were seeded onto the wells of 24-well tissue culture plates at 106 cells/well. Bacteria from
a stationary phase culture were washed twice in PBS, resuspended in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS, and added to the wells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. The plates
were incubated in a humidified incubation chamber at 37˚C with 5% CO2 for 1 hour. Each
well was washed three times with sterile PBS to remove unbound bacteria. To determine the
number of associated bacteria, cells were lysed with sterile PBS containing 0.025% Triton
X-100 and dilution plated. For the detection of internalized bacteria, after washing with PBS,
cells were incubated in DMEM containing 10% FBS, gentamicin (200 μg/ml) and ampicillin
(200 μg/ml) for 1 hr. Cells were washed again with PBS for three times, lysed and dilution
plated. All experiments were performed in triplicate wells and repeated at least three times.
Adherence and internalization was expressed as a percentage of total bacteria added.
Western blot assays
Cells were cultured in the appropriate medium in the presence or absence of bacteria for 12
hours and washed with sterile PBS three times. To obtain total cell lysates, cells were lysed with
a lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM

 EGTA, 100 mM NaF, 10 mM Na pyrophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10% glycerol, and phospha-
tase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)). To extract nuclear proteins, cells were resuspended in 200 μl
of a buffer consisting of 10 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA
and 10 μl of 1%NP-40. Cells were vortexed for 30 sec and then centrifuged at 2000g for 5 min.
Pellets were then resuspended in 100 μl of a buffer consisting of 20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 500
mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA and vortexed for 10 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm
for 10 min and supernatants were used for western blots. To extract protein from tumor tis-
sues, tissues were homogenized using a Tissue LyserLT (Qiagen) and lysed with the lysis buffer
used for total cell lysates. The lysates were subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis and western
blot. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against β-catenin (1:4000), c-Myc (1:3000), PCNA (1:2000),
cleaved caspase 3 (1:1000), lamin B1 (1:1000) and β-actin (1:5000) were all from Cell Signaling
Technology (CST). Horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (CST) was
used as the secondary antibody. Signals were detected using HyGLO, chemiluminescent HRP
(Denville, Mteuchen, NJ). Band intensity was quantified using Image J.
Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) to compare relative
expression of cyclin D1 and cytokines
Total RNA was extracted from co-cultured cells or colon tissues using the RNeasy Kit (QIA-
GEN) or All-Prep DNA/RNA/Protein Mini kit (QIAGEN). cDNA was generated by using the
Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche). qPCR was performed using FastStart
SYBR green master mix (Roche) in a Viia 7 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The
following cycle conditions were used: 95˚C for 10 minutes followed by 40 cycles at 95˚C for 30
seconds and 60˚C for 1 minute. For cyclin D1, CT values were first normalized to GAPDH,
then to cells cultured in media only (ΔΔCT). For cytokines in colon tissues, CT values were
normalized β-actin (ΔCT).
Flow cytometry
Cells were co-cultured with bacteria for 12 hours and washed with sterile PBS three times. To
detect proliferating cells, cells were incubated with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (BD Biosci-
ences) at a final concentration of 10 μM in cell culture media for 30 mins. Cells were washed
and stained for BrdU incorporation by using BrdU Flow kit (BD Pharmingen) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. For the detection of cells undergoing apoptosis, cells were stained
with prodium iodide (PI) and anti-Annexin V antibodies by using Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis
Detection Kit (BD Phamingen). Flow cytometry analysis of samples was done using a LSRII
flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson), and data were analyzed using the FCS Express 3 software.
Animal experiments
All animal experiments were performed according to prototocls approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use committee at Texas A&M Health Science Center. (1) Xenograft model.
HCT116 or SW480 cells (1 x 106) were incubated with TX20005 or L. lactis (MOI = 1) for 12
hours. The cells were immediately washed, trypsinized and mixed with Matrigel (Corning,
MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and subcutaneously injected (100 μl) into
the dorsal flap of 5-week-old nude mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Three hours
after the injection, mice were administered a broad-spectrum antibiotic imipenem (MSD) by
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection (150 mg/kg body weight). Tumor diameters were measured
with a digital caliper, and tumor volume calculated using the formula: Volume = (d1xd1xd2)/
2, with d1 being the larger dimension [80]. (2) AOM-induced mouse model of CRC. Eight-
week old female A/J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were treated with AOM

 (10 mg/kg body weight) by i.p. injection once a week for 2 or 4 weeks. Mice were then given
ampicillin (1g/L) in drinking water for one week and switched to antibiotic-free water 24
hours prior to bacterial inoculation. Mice were orally gavaged with saline, TX20005 or L. lactis
using a feeding needle (~ 1 x 108 cfu/mouse) at a frequency of three times per week for 24
weeks, or once a week for 12 weeks and were euthanized one week after the final gavage. One
hour before sacrifice, mice received an i.p. injection of BrdU at 100 mg/kg body weight. Colons
were removed by cutting from the rectal to the cecal end and opened longitudinally for visual
evaluation. Tumor number was recorded and tumor size measured using a digital caliper.
Tumor burden was calculated as the sum of all the tumor volumes of one mouse. Visual evalu-
ation was carried out by two blinded observers. Mice were fed with standard ProLab IsoPro
RMH3000 (LabDiet).
Histology and immunohistochemistry
At necropsy, colons from 3 randomly selected mice from each group were “Swiss rolled” from
the rectal to the cecal end, fixed in Methcarn (60% methanol, 30% chloroform, and 10% glacial
acetic acid), paraffin embedded, and cut into 5μm sections across. Every 10 sections were
stained with hematoxylin/eosin (H&E) and histological evaluation performed by a pathologist
in a blinded fashion. Pathological scores were given using the following scale [81]: 0, no dys-
plasia; 1, mild dysplasia characterized by aberrant crypt foci (ACF), +0.5 for small gastrointes-
tinal neoplasia (GIN) or multiple ACF; 2, moderate dysplasia with GIN, +0.5 for multiple
occurrences or small adenoma; 3, severe or high grade dysplasia restricted to mucosa; 3.5,
adenocarcinoma (involvement through muscularis mucosa); 4, adenocarcinoma (through sub-
mucosa and into or through the muscularis propria). Inflammation was scored using the fol-
lowing scoring matrix [82]: 0, normal; 1 - </ = 1 multifocal mononuclear cell infiltrates in
lamina propria accompanied by minimal epithelial hyperplasia and slight to no depletion of
mucous from goblet cells; 2, involves more of intestine or more frequent, occasional small epi-
thelial erosions, no submucosa involvement; 3, moderate inflammation plus submucosa neu-
trophils, crypt abscesses, ulcers; 4, most of colon; transmural; crowding of epithelial cells with
elongated crypts, ulcers plus crypt abscesses [82].
Proliferating crypt cells were detected by staining every 10 sections with anti-BrdU antibod-
ies and counting BrdU-positive cells. A total of ~50 crypts were counted per mouse and the
percentage of BrdU+ cells vs. total crypt epithelial cells counted was calculated. Apoptosis was
determined by performing TUNEL assay on every 10 sections. Crypts were counted in the
same manner as for BrdU+ cells. Sections were also stained for β-catenin. A Leica DM2000
LED microscope was used for imaging. Paraffin embedding, sectioning, histochemistry and
immunohistochemistry were performed by the Histology Core, Gulf Coast Digestive Diseases
Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.
Detection of Sg and Sp by qPCR
To detect Sg in the mouse colon, fecal pellets were collected from mice at the end of 12-week
gavage with TX20005. DNA was extracted using QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen)
following manufacturer’s instructions. Sg and Sp-specific primers were designed based on
genomic sequences unique to Sg and Sp, respectively. The specificity of the primers was tested
against a panel of strains of closely related species within the S. bovis group (S16 Fig). The
primers correctly identified Sg, and Sp strains respectively, and not closely related species. The
sequence for the oligonucleotides is as follows: forward Sg-specific primer– 5’ TGACGTACGA
TTGATATCATCAAC 3’, reverse Sg-specific primer –5’CGCTTAACACATTTTTAGCTAAT
ACG 3’, forward Sp-specific primer– 5’ ATGGATAGTCATAGAATTGA 3’, and reverse

 Sp-specific primer– 5’ GGACAATGCCCTCATCTAGC 3’. qPCR was performed using Fast
Plus EvaGreen qPCR Master Mix (Biotium) in a Viia 7 Real Time PCR System (Applied Bio-
systems) with the following cycling condition: 95˚C for 10 minutes followed by 40 cycles at
95˚C for 30 seconds and 60˚C for 1 minute. Melting temperature analysis was performed at
the end the cycles. ΔCT was normalized to the results from qPCR reactions using universal
16S rRNA primers. DNA was extracted from mouse colon tissues spiked with serially diluted
Sg cultures of known concentration and was used to generate a standard curve. The standard
curve was then used to convert ΔCT to bacterial concentration.
The same primers and cycling conditions were used to detect Sg and Sp in DNA extracted
from human tumor and adjacent normal tissues. Samples enriched with Sg (strongly positive)
is arbitrarily defined as with a 5 CT cutoff from the mean, which corresponds to approximately
90-fold enrichment above the average and approximately 750 CFU/100 ng DNA. PCR prod-
ucts from randomly selected positive samples were purified and sequenced. All were found to
have the correct DNA sequence.
Immunofluorescence detection of Sg in tumor tissues from mouse and
human
Rabbit serum was raised against formalin killed TX20005 (Rockland Immunochemicals). The
antiserum and pre-bleed serum were tested against TX20005, S. infantarius (TX20012), S.
macedonicus (TX20026), S. pasterianus (TX20027), E. coli XL-1 Blue, and L. lactis MG 1363, to
determine the specificity of the antibodies. The antiserum specifically recognized Sg not other
bacterial strains under the experimental conditions (S15 Fig). Methcarn-fixed paraffin embed-
ded colon sections (5 μm) from mice treated with two weekly injections of AOM and 24 weeks
of oral gavage with bacteria were used to detect Sg. Human colon tissue sections were obtained
from US Biomax. Briefly, sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated in an etha-
nol gradient. The slides were incubated in a citrate buffer at 95˚C for 15 min, cooled to room
temperature (RT), rinsed with PBS and incubated in blocking buffer (PBS containing 1% Sapo-
nin and 20% BSA) for 30 min. The slides were then incubated with rabbit anti-Sg serum (1:250
dilution) at 4˚C overnight, washed with PBS, and incubated with donkey-anti-rabbit Alexa
594 (1:500 dilution in PBS) for 1 hr at RT. The slides were washed again, stained with DAPI,
mounted and examined in a DeltaVision Elite microscope (GE Healthcare).
Statistical analyses
Comparisons of multiple groups were done by two-tailed one-way or two-way analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) followed by Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) test. Comparison between two
groups of data was done by unpaired, two-tailed t test. Pearson correlation analysis was per-
formed to determine the correlation between Sg burden and tumor number and burden,
respectively. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the qPCR data from human tissues. Anal-
yses were carried out using the Graphpad Prism 6 software.
