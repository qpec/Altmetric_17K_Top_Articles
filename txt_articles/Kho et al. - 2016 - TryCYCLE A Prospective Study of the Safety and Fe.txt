Abstract
Introduction
The objective of this study was to assess the safety and feasibility of in-bed cycling started
within the first 4 days of mechanical ventilation (MV) to inform a future randomized clinical
trial.
Methods
We conducted a 33-patient prospective cohort study in a 21-bed adult academic medical-
surgical intensive care unit (ICU) in Hamilton, ON, Canada. We included adult patients
(� 18 years) receiving MV who walked independently pre-ICU. Our intervention was 30
minutes of in-bed supine cycling 6 days/week in the ICU. Our primary outcome was Safety
(termination), measured as events prompting cycling termination; secondary Safety (discon-
nection or dislodgement) outcomes included catheter/tube dislodgements. Feasibility was
measured as consent rate and fidelity to intervention. For our primary outcome, we calcu-
lated the binary proportion and 95% confidence interval (CI).
Results
From 10/2013-8/2014, we obtained consent from 34 of 37 patients approached (91.9%),
33 of whom received in-bed cycling. Of those who cycled, 16(48.4%) were female, the
mean (SD) age was 65.8(12.2) years, and APACHE II score was 24.3(6.7); 29(87.9%) had

 medical admitting diagnoses. Cycling termination was infrequent (2.0%, 95% CI: 0.8%-
4.9%) and no device dislodgements occurred. Cycling began a median [IQR] of 3 [2, 4] days
after ICU admission; patients received 5 [3, 8] cycling sessions with a median duration of
30.7 [21.6, 30.8] minutes per session. During 205 total cycling sessions, patients were
receiving invasive MV (150 [73.1%]), vasopressors (6 [2.9%]), sedative or analgesic infu-
sions (77 [37.6%]) and dialysis (4 [2.0%]).
Conclusions
Early cycling within the first 4 days of MV among hemodynamically stable patients is safe
and feasible. Research to evaluate the effect of early cycling on patient function is
warranted.

Introduction
Functional disability can last for many years in critical illness survivors [1,2]. Due to an aging
population, and increasing survival from critical illness [3,4], the burden of physical and cogni-
tive disability among patients discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU) is also increasing
[5]. A systematic review of 14 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) identified that exercise-based
physical therapy (PT) interventions started in the ICU were most effective to improve physical
function compared to other strategies such as nutrition or different modes of mechanical ven-
tilation (MV) [6]. This improved function following critical illness may be due to addressing
the early and rapid reduction in muscle size and strength that occur within the first 10 days of
a patient’s ICU stay [7,8]. Thus, interventions to prevent or reduce muscle size and minimize
strength losses within this early time period may help to improve long-term outcomes in ICU
survivors.
Rehabilitation interventions started very early in a patient’s ICU stay can improve function
at hospital discharge. In a 104-patient RCT, those who received occupational (OT) and PT
interventions in the ICU within 1.5 days of starting MV were more likely to be functionally
independent at hospital discharge than those started at 7.4 days [9]. Here, the main difference
was receipt of 20 minutes of therapy during MV by the intervention group versus no therapy
during MV by the control group. However, common ICU interventions like MV can pose bar-
riers to rehabilitation. For example, a recent prospective cohort study reported that the pres-
ence of an oral endotracheal tube (ETT) was an important barrier to receipt of mobilization
within the first 14 days of MV [10].
In-bed cycling (“cycling”) is a promising early intervention for critically ill patients, with
evidence supporting its use later in a patient’s ICU stay. In a 90-patient RCT, those receiving
cycling started 14 days after ICU admission versus usual care had better 6-minute walk (6
MWT) distances, greater leg strength, and better Short Form 36 (SF-36) physical function
scores at hospital discharge [11]. Commercially-available devices can provide 3 possible activ-
ity modes: passive (i.e., fully motorized, no patient initiation), active-assisted (i.e., partially ini-
tiated by the patient), or active (i.e., fully initiated by the patient). Cycling can enhance
rehabilitation in critically ill patients[12] by providing low-intensity movement, allowing

 patients’ spontaneous participation in activity, and facilitating rest breaks in severely decondi-
tioned patients.
Cycling started earlier in a patient’s ICU stay may further improve patient outcomes. How-
ever, evidence for early cycling is limited to observations of single sessions [13], cycling incor-
porated in a multi-modal rehabilitation strategy [14,15], a case-control study of cycling with
functional electrical stimulation[16], or retrospective review of cycling in routine PT care [17].
In preparation for a larger trial of this intervention, the objective of this study was to evaluate
the safety and feasibility of early leg cycling in critically ill patients.
Materials and Methods
We enrolled adult patients (>18 years) from a 21-bed academic medical-surgical ICU in Ham-
ilton, ON, Canada. Immediately upon ICU admission, a research coordinator screened for eli-
gible patients: MV for 0 to �4 days, ICU LOS for 0 to �7 days, and who were able to ambulate
with or without a gait aid before hospitalization. Pre-enrolment, we screened patients for the
duration of their eligibility as long as they met the MV and LOS criteria. Table 1 outlines study
exclusion criteria and cycling exemptions developed from a systematic review of early mobility
activities [18], clinical trials published at the time of study design [9,11,19], and clinical
research team consensus. Written informed consent was obtained by a research coordinator
from all participants (or their proxy) included in this open-label study.
Intervention
We prescribed 30 minutes of leg cycling with an additional 1 minute cool down, 6 days/week,
for the duration of the patient’s ICU stay to a maximum of 28 days. This intervention was in
addition to routine PT. If a patient was re-admitted to ICU during the index hospitalization,
we re-started cycling. We reviewed patients daily for temporary cycling exemptions (Table 1).
ICU PTs led all cycling sessions. We used a specialized cycle ergometer purchased by our
hospital (RT300 supine cycle, Restorative Therapies, Baltimore, MD; Fig 1)[11]. All PTs
received a 1-day in-service and had over 6 months of clinical experience with the cycle before
starting the study. The participants started with passive cycling at a rate of 5 revolutions/min-
ute (RPM) based on our clinical experience where patients actively cycled at low pedal
cadence. If patients initiated active cycling, the PT promoted active participation. The thera-
pists encouraged as much active cycling as possible, and low resistance (0.5 NM) was used dur-
ing active cycling. Due to a variable level of consciousness throughout their stay, we allowed
patients to cycle at a self-selected rate. We chose not to add resistance during the cycling inter-
vention because we would not be able to discern if early cycling at a patient’s self-selected pace
or increased resistance influenced outcomes in a future RCT. If the patient stopped cycling
actively, the ergometer reverted to passive cycling.
We measured vital signs pre-, during (at 5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes), and post- cycling. Dur-
ing cycling, if the patient had 2 consecutive readings of mean arterial pressure (MAP) <60 or
>110 mmHg, heart rate (HR) < 40 or >140 beats per minute (BPM), or SpO2 <88%, despite
adjustments to FiO2, we advised PTs to use clinical judgment to stop a cycling session, accord-
ing to each patient’s individual clinical circumstances in consultation with the ICU team.
We collected the following data: APACHE II score,[20] Charlson Comorbidity Index,[21]
and Functional Comorbidity Index [22]. We collected the Katz Activity of Daily Living (ADL)
Scale,[23] and Functional Status Score for ICU (FSS-ICU) [24] at study entry from interviews
with the proxy or patient. Daily ICU data included Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score
(MODS),[25] and exposures including MV, receipt of neuromuscular blockers, vasopressors

 or inotropes; benzodiazepines, opioids, or propofol; and dialysis. We collected MV, drug expo-
sures and receipt of dialysis as binary variables for each study day.
Primary Outcome and Sample Size Calculation
Our primary outcome was Safety (termination), defined as receipt of 30-minute leg cycling
sessions without stopping due to 5 a-priori reasons: 1) unplanned extubation, 2) suspected
new unstable or uncontrolled arrhythmia, 3) concern for myocardial infarction (MI), 4) ICU
physician request to terminate session, and 5) PT terminated session due to physiologic con-
cerns. We hypothesized that the observed Safety (termination) event rate would not differ, or
would be better (i.e., lower) than other early rehabilitation studies (0 to 4%).[18] We estimated
we needed 164 cycling sessions to ensure an observed Safety (termination) rate was within an
upper 95% confidence interval (CI) of 3% from a point estimate of 4% (7 events) [26].

 Assuming a median ICU length of stay of 7 days, 2 days to enroll patients from ICU admission,
and 5 cycling sessions per patient, we enrolled 33 patients.
Secondary Outcomes
Safety (disconnection or dislodgement).
Inadvertent ventilator disconnection or device
dislodgement (catheters: peripheral venous, arterial, central venous, pulmonary artery, or dial-
ysis; tubes: orogastric, nasogastric, or percutaneous gastrostomy or jejunotomy).
Feasibility.
Consent rate >70%[9], ability to provide cycling sessions, and ability to collect
physical outcome measures at ICU awakening, ICU discharge, and hospital discharge. We
recorded the duration of cycling by the patient and the total duration (including patient setup
and equipment take-down) of all sessions. Other outcomes included PT assessment of muscle
strength (Medical Research Council sum score (MRC-SS),[27,28], ICU-acquired weakness
(MRC-SS <48)[29], hand grip[28,30], quadriceps strength with dynamometry[31], and func-
tion (FSS-ICU[24], Physical Function ICU Test-scored (PFIT-s)[32,33], 6MWT[34]). We also
collected duration of MV, discharge location, ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS) and
mortality.
Analysis
For binary variables, we calculated the binary proportion and 95% CI. For continuous vari-
ables, we calculated the mean and standard deviation (SD), or if non-normally distributed, the
median and interquartile range [IQR]. We compared continuous variables using a two-sided

Ethical Approval
The Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board approved this study (13–173; Clinicaltrials.
gov: NCT01885442).
We reported our study according to the Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Non-
randomized Designs (TREND) Statement[35] and Template for Intervention Description and
Replication (TIDieR)[36] checklist (S1 and S2 Tables).
Results
Between October 30, 2013 and August 18, 2014, we enrolled 34 patients (Fig 2). One patient
did not receive any cycling during their ICU stay due to persistently high MAP and was
excluded from further analysis. Of all patients, 11 (33.0%) received vasopressors or inotropes,
5 (15.1%) received neuromuscular blockers, and 7 (21.2%) received dialysis during their ICU
stay. Table 2 outlines patient characteristics.
Safety
The Safety (termination) rate was 2% (95% CI (0.8% to 4.9%) in 205 cycling sessions (4 events:
high MAP (n = 2), SpO2 <88% (n = 1), and physician request for termination due to concern
for MI (n = 1; subsequent workup revealed no evidence of MI)). There were no unplanned
extubations, or Safety (disconnection or dislodgement) events. Of 205 cycling sessions, pro-
vided by 5 different PTs, there were 56 respiratory or cardiovascular physiologic changes from
baseline (Table 3). In most instances, PTs did not stop cycling early due to these transient
changes. There was a statistically, but not clinically significant difference in pre- and post-
cycling HR and MAP, and no differences in the remaining vital signs (BP, SpO2, FiO2; S3
Table).
Feasibility
Our consent rate was 91.9% (34/37), and median [IQR] time from ICU admission to consent
was 2 [1, 3] days. The median [IQR] time from ICU admission to first cycling was 3 [2, 4]
days. Patients received a median [IQR] of 5 [3, 8] sessions, and the duration of cycling and
total session (including set up and take down) was 30.2 [20.0, 30.7] and 43 [36, 49] minutes,
respectively. Of 320 opportunities, 115 (35.9%) sessions were withheld (Table 4) and patients
completed the full 30-minute protocol on 138 of 205 (67.3%) occasions. Table 4 outlines details
for the 67 sessions stopped early.
Cycling Session Characteristics
Of 205 cycling sessions, 150 (73.1%) occurred while patients received MV (via oral ETT
(n = 144, 96.0%) or via tracheostomy (n = 6, 4.0%)), and the mean (SD) FiO2 was 38%(15).
Over half (106 (51.7%) of all sessions occurred within the first 7 days of patients’ admission to
the ICU (Fig 3). The mean (SD) MODS score [25] on cycling days was 3.4(2.9). Any infusions
of benzodiazepines, opiates, propofol, or any bolus of benzodiazepine, opiate or propofol
occurred during 40 (19.5%), 44 (21.5%), 38 (18.5%), and 77 (37.6%) of all sessions, respectively.
The mean (SD) RASS score was -1.4 (1.6). Patients received vasopressors or inotropes during 6
(2.9%), and dialysis during 4 (2.0%) of all sessions (continuous renal replacement therapy,
n = 3; hemodialysis, n = 1).

 The median [IQR] distance cycled per session and per patient was 1.0 [0.9, 2.2] and 8.7 [5.0,

41.2 km, respectively. Therapists observed active cycling in 165 (80.5%) of all sessions. On days
of in-bed cycling, the 3 most common additional PT interventions were passive range of
motion (39 days, 19.0%), bed mobility (32, 15.6%), and airway clearance techniques (28,
13.7%). Sitting at the edge of the bed, standing, and walking occurred on 27 (13.2%), 24

 no additional PT interventions occurred. Additional information on non-cycling physiother-
apy interventions and cycling details per patient are available in S4 and S5 Tables.
Strength and Functional Outcomes
At ICU discharge, 7/28 (25.0%) of all survivors were walking, which improved to 18/23
(78.3%) by hospital discharge (Table 5). For 20 survivors with paired assessments, patients’
Katz ADL and FSS-ICU scores were significantly lower at hospital discharge than at baseline
(Tables 2 and 5, p-value for difference, Katz = 0.004; FSS-ICU = 0.015). At hospital discharge,
patients required assistance for at least 2 ADLs as well as for standing or walking.
Discussion
Our results suggest that it is safe and feasible to enroll critically ill, hemodynamically stable
MV patients in a rehabilitation study of early cycling. In this study of 33 MV patients, we
began cycling within 3 days of ICU admission, session termination was infrequent, and device
dislodgements did not occur. On average, patients received 5 cycling sessions of 30 minutes
duration, cycled 1 km per session, and cycled a distance of 9 km in total in the ICU.
Our data add to a growing body of literature suggesting early cycling can occur safely with
critically ill patients. A single, 20-minute passive cycling session started within the first 72
hours of MV documented no safety concerns while patients received low-dose vasoactive drug
infusions, and no increase in cardiac output, or oxygen consumption.[13]. In a retrospective
study of cycling incorporated into routine PT interventions in a medical ICU, cycling began
within 4 days of MICU admission, and only 1 device dislodgement occurred out of 541 ses-
sions (0.2% event rate).[17] In a case-control study of cycling and functional electrical

 stimulation initiated within the first 96 hours of MV, 1 transient desaturation occurred in 69
sessions.[13,16]
Due to the dynamic nature of critical illness, patients’ suitability for rehabilitation may vary
daily. We designed our study to start cycling within the first 4 days of MV. Of 179 potentially
eligible patients, 114 met some (or multiple) exclusion criteria. Of 144 exclusion reasons,
almost half (68, 47%) occurred because patients had one or more persistent temporary exemp-
tions precluding cycling within the first 4 days of MV (Fig 2). Most temporary exemptions
reflected patients’ acuity: receipt of neuromuscular blocking agents (n = 19), increasing vasoac-
tive medications (n = 14), or active myocardial ischemia/uncontrolled arrhythmia (n = 8).
During our study, new studies supporting the safety of rehabilitation (including cycling) with
femoral catheters were published[37,38]; we subsequently revised our protocol to remove this

This table summarizes reasons for not cycling that were recorded during daily review pre-cycling and
reasons for stopping cycling early (i.e., before 30 minutes). Abbreviations: RASS = Richmond Agitation and
Sedation Scale; bpm = beats per minute; ICU = intensive care unit.
aTotals sum greater than 115 because each session could have more than one reason for not cycling. Data
are reasons as a proportion of 115 sessions.
bOf 27 sessions, 10 patients refused 1 or more cycling sessions, and 2 patients accounted for 16 (60%) of all
refusals (10 and 6 refusals each). On 6 of these occasions, patients received alternate mobility activities
(e.g., sitting at the edge of the bed, sitting in a chair) on the same day.
cPatients were not available due to procedures in the operating room (n = 2) or diagnostic imaging (n = 1).
dOther includes bike unable to fit on bed (n = 1), left foot intravenous catheter interfering with cycling (n = 1).

 exemption. Future studies need to consider the possible impact of temporary exemptions from
cycling in ICU patients and their impact on patient outcomes, and document protocol adher-
ence, as in other critical care trials.
Prospective research in early cycling is feasible. We attained a high consent rate (92%), met
our target sample size, delivered early cycling, and measured physical function in all survivors
at hospital discharge. Previous early rehabilitation studies [9,11,14,39–41] had consent rates
varying from 48% [42] to 89% [11], indicating differing receptivity of substitute decision mak-
ers to early rehabilitation research. We met our recruitment target, whereas some studies
closed early due to slow accrual.[14,40,41] While another early rehabilitation intervention,
NMES, had difficulty consistently achieving muscle contractions[40,43], all but 1 patient in
this study successfully received cycling. However, of 31 patients eligible not enrolled, 22 (71%)
were not enrolled because physiotherapists did not have capacity to manage multiple cycling
trial patients concurrently (Fig 2). Investigators need to consider how to best engage front line
ICU staff in delivering and/or outcome measure assessment to optimize timely accrual and
cycling opportunities.
Further prospective research on the efficacy of early cycling in medical-surgical MV
patients is needed. Cycling targets the legs, particularly hip flexors, which are most vulnerable

sessions, over half (106 (52%)) occurred within the first 7 days of the patient’s ICU admission.

 to muscle atrophy and weakness during bed rest [44]. Two RCTs of cycling as part of a multi-
modal intervention showed no functional differences between intervention and control groups
[14,15]. In these studies, cycling occurred later in the patients’ rehabilitation, and it was diffi-
cult to discern the unique contribution of cycling to patient outcomes[14,15]. In a retrospec-
tive cohort of cycling in a medical ICU, patients received 25 minutes of cycling in 2 of 4 total
PT sessions during their stay, but functional status was not reported[17]. Cycling may offer a
rehabilitation option for a broad range of ICU patients, particularly those who must be bed-
bound, have ~75˚ knee and ~80˚ available hip flexion[17], are not on active spinal precautions,
and have no other orthopedic restrictions (e.g., no weight-bearing). However, further research
in this area is needed.
Early mobility is recommended as a front-line non-pharmacological intervention to reduce
the incidence and duration of delirium in critically ill patients.[45] However, some mobiliza-
tion protocols require patients to be interactive [41,46], which may delay the time to start
rehabilitation during the early critical time period for muscle size and strength losses. A multi-
center prospective cohort study reported the presence of an oral ETT as one of the main barri-
ers to mobilization in 192 MV patients.[10] Only 37% of all patients received any mobilization
within the first 14 days of MV, and only in 16% of all potential occasions.[10] In contrast,
patients in our cohort started cycling within a median of 3 days of MV, over half of all sessions
occurred within the first 7 days of ICU admission (Fig 3), and 70% occurred while patients
received MV via ETT.
Limitations and Strengths
We had no control group to determine if cycling improved patient outcomes compared to
usual care. Experienced ICU PTs conducted all biking sessions and outcome measures. Com-
pared to other ICU cycling studies,[13,47] few patients cycled while receiving vasopressors or

 inotropes in our cohort, reflecting the predominant respiratory conditions in our population.
We did not systematically record patients’ delirium status or reasons why they refused cycling.
We conducted this study in a single centre ICU with a highly collaborative PT department and
strong interprofessional critical care research culture.
To our knowledge, this is the largest prospective cohort of early cycling sessions in MV,
medical-surgical ICU patients. We included an a-priori sample size calculation focused on
safety events, prospectively collected all data, and engaged clinical PTs to lead all cycling ses-
sions. We had a high consent rate, achieved our sample size target, and patients received multi-
ple cycling sessions. Our Safety (termination) event rate of 2% was similar to the RCT of
cycling started 2 weeks after ICU admission, where 3.8% (16/425) of sessions terminated early.
[11] While we originally excluded patients from cycling if they had femoral catheters in-situ,
we revised our protocol during the study to reflect new evidence supporting the safety of
mobility activities with femoral catheters.[37,38]
Conclusions
This study suggests that it is safe and feasible for hemodynamically stable MV patients to
receive early cycling in the ICU and may inform future RCTs in this field.
