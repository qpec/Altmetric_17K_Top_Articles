Abstract
 Background—Little is known about trajectories of PTSD symptoms across the peripartum 
period in women with trauma histories, specifically those who met lifetime PTSD diagnoses prior 
to pregnancy. The present study seeks to identify factors that influence PTSD symptom load across 
pregnancy and early postpartum, and study its impact on postpartum adaptation.
 Method—The current study is a secondary analysis on pregnant women with a Lifetime PTSD 
diagnosis (N=319) derived from a larger community sample who were interviewed twice across 
pregnancy (28 and 35 weeks) and again at 6 weeks postpartum, assessing socioeconomic risks, 
mental health, past and ongoing trauma exposure, and adaptation to postpartum.
 Results—Using trajectory analysis, first we examined the natural course of PTSD symptoms 
based on patterns across peripartum, and found 4 distinct trajectory groups. Secondly, we explored 
factors (demographic, historical, and gestational) that shape the PTSD symptom trajectories, and 
examined the impact of trajectory membership on maternal postpartum adaptation. We found that 
child abuse history, demographic risk, and lifetime PTSD symptom count increased pregnancy-
onset PTSD risk, whereas gestational PTSD symptom trajectory was best predicted by interim 
trauma and labor anxiety. Women with the greatest PTSD symptom rise during pregnancy were 
most likely to suffer postpartum depression and reported greatest bonding impairment with their 
infants at 6 weeks postpartum.
 Conclusions—Screening for modifiable risks (interpersonal trauma exposure and labor 
anxiety) and/or PTSD symptom load during pregnancy appears critical to promote maternal 
wellbeing.

  Introduction
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common following trauma, and low-income and 
minority women are at particularly high risk for both exposure to trauma 1,2 and 
development of PTSD 3–5. Prevalence rates among women ranges from 10–20% for lifetime 
PTSD and around 5% 6,7 for current PTSD. With growing awareness of cross-generational 
transmission of risk for psychopathology there is increasing attention to PTSD during the 
peripartum (i.e., pregnancy and first year postpartum). PTSD rates are up to 24% during 
pregnancy for high-risk women who are racial minorities, teens, less educated or poor 8.
Maternal PTSD in pregnancy, even after controlling for demographic factors, increases the 
odds for poor pregnancy and birthing outcomes, such as ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, 
preterm labor 8, and low birth weight9. Furthermore, maternal gestational stress, trauma, and 
PTSD adversely impact fetal functional and structural brain development. Maternal stress 
hormones during pregnancy modulate fetal stress hormone reactivity 10 and babies of 
“stressed” mothers are likely to show altered HPA axis functioning of basal cortisol11,12 and 
stress reactivity 13,14. Additionally, animal work demonstrates a link between prenatal stress 
exposure and alterations in specific brain structures 15. Although evidence from humans is 
still sparse in this area 16, there is initial evidence that prenatal maternal stress, trauma or 
PTSD might be associated with child difficult temperament17–19 attention problems20,21, 
mood and anxiety symptoms 22–24, cognitive delay25,26, and adult disease 27.
The peripartum period may be experienced as stressful and/or traumatic, particularly for 
women with past trauma histories 28. PTSD often exhibits chronic course with fluctuating 
symptom severity that can be exacerbated by re-exposure to traumatic/stressful events 29,30. 
Women with prior reproductive trauma 31 or prior interpersonal trauma history, especially 
childhood maltreatment, may have increased risk for re-emergence of PTSD 
symptoms 29,32,33. Onoye and colleagues 34 reported that community-recruited women 
peaked with PTSD symptoms in late gestation if they were exposed to trauma during 
pregnancy.
Thus, reducing the prevalence of maternal trauma exposure and the incidence or severity of 
PTSD during pregnancy has important public health implications, for both the mother and 
child. Systematic screening for trauma exposure and signs of PTSD relapse early in 
gestation may reduce risk for relapse to clinical PTSD diagnosis during the peripartum, and 
subsequently reduce risks for adverse outcomes in both mother and baby 11,35,36. Women 
with PTSD symptoms in pregnancy might be in critical needs for services 37 in order to 
facilitate a healthy course of pregnancy and to promote adequate fetal growth and 
development.
Although cumulatively prior research has demonstrated clinically significant impact of 
PTSD on peripartum women37 and their infants9–12, there are no longitudinal studies of 
PTSD across peripartum in women at greatest risk. Therefore, the primary goal of this study 
is to examine the natural course of PTSD symptoms across the peripartum period in women 
with heightened vulnerability for illness or relapse (i.e., current/lifetime PTSD diagnoses 
due to interpersonal violence) 30. Based on prior works, we hypothesize that the majority of

 such vulnerable women will experience an increase in PTSD symptoms during the 
peripartum period28,31–34. Additionally, although research shows that past trauma 28, 
poverty 8, concurrent stress/trauma34, history of PTSD30, and pregnancy28 itself can increase 
risk for PTSD, we have no actual data to model the course of PTSD symptoms across 
pregnancy and early postpartum in these vulnerable women. Therefore, our secondary 
research question is to identify risk factors (demographic, historical, gestational) that shape 
the natural course of peripartum PTSD symptom trajectories. We hypothesize that more risk 
factors, especially experiencing trauma, will be associated with a greater increase in PTSD 
symptoms. Finally, our third research question will examine the impact of peripartum PTSD 
symptom trajectories on women’s postpartum functioning in other domains relevant to 
motherhood (i.e., depression, subjective bonding with infant, breastfeeding).
This study is the first to longitudinally follow women with PTSD risk across gestation and 
early postpartum with the goals of describing naturalistic PTSD symptom patterns, 
identifying risk factors, and examining consequences of these PTSD patterns on postpartum 
adaptation. We aim to shed light on those vulnerable for and resilient to symptom 
exacerbation with the hope that findings can guide development of more targeted 
interventions to reduce illness burden and reduce transmission of risk to the child.
 Method
The current study is a secondary analysis from a larger study focused on determining the 
effects of PTSD on childbearing outcomes (i.e., pregnancy health, birth, and postpartum 
adjustment) in a community sample of pregnant women (NIH NR008767; “the Stress, 
Trauma, Anxiety, and the Childbearing Year, STACY project”). Eligible women presenting 
to antenatal care (≥18 years, English speaking, expecting their first infant, < 28 weeks 
completed gestation) were recruited from 2005 to 2008. The study oversampled for low SES 
by recruiting from prenatal clinics of three academic health centers, two of which were in an 
urban area, with one serving 90% women who were publically insured. Women initiating 
prenatal care in these clinics were invited to participate by obstetric nurses and those 
interested in participating gave contact information and assent to be called up by a research 
survey organization (DataStat, Inc.) for more interviewing over the phone. DataStat team 
was comprised of 13 diverse women who specialized in health-related standardized 
telephone interviews, who conducted all participant interviews averaging 32 minutes each. 
Ten percent of interviews were monitored live by a supervisor. The phone contacts were as 
follows: at or before 28 weeks gestation (wave 1); at 35 weeks gestation (wave 2); and at 6 
weeks postpartum (wave 3). Of the 2,689 interested women, 758 were unreachable, 284 
were ineligible, 58 declined at the start of the first interview, and 8 interviews were 
interrupted and not completed, leaving a total of 1,581 women enrolled in the study. Prior 
published work shows detailed screening and enrollment flow chart on these 1,581 eligible 
women with complete first interviews at wave 138. Among these 1,581 women, 319 (20.2%) 
had met PTSD diagnosis (lifetime or current), 532 (33.6%) were subsyndromal (i.e., had few 
PTSD symptoms but never had met diagnostic criteria), 380 (24%) were trauma-exposed 
resilient without PTSD, and finally, 350 (22.1%) were healthy controls. For the current 
study, we selected the subsample of women with heightened risk for PTSD, those who either 
at present or in lifetime had met diagnostic criteria for PTSD (n=319, 20.2% of total

 sample), with the aim to study the course of symptoms among these risk-women across 
gestation and early postpartum (see Table 1).
 Measures
 Demographics—Demographics were assessed using the Perinatal Risk Assessment 
Monitoring Survey (PRAMS)39. A score of “1” was assigned for each “risk” (under 21 
years, non-White, no partner, high school diploma or less, income less than $15,000); scores 
were summed as a cumulative risk index for analyses40.
 Historical and Gestational Characteristics—The National Women’s Study PTSD 
Module (NWS-PTSD)41 was utilized for the assessment of both continuous PTSD 17 
symptom count and a diagnosis based on DSM-IV criteria41. Depression was assessed at 
wave 1 with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview short form (CIDI)42. The 
Dissociative Experience Scale-Taxonomic Version (DES-T)43 assessed lifetime status of 
dissociative experiences commonly associated with PTSD and childhood abuse44. The Life 
Stressor Checklist-Revised (LSC-R)45 assessed lifetime trauma for 29 potential trauma 
exposures. Three subscales were derived from this checklist including: child abuse (5 items), 
adult abuse (3 items), and non-abuse trauma (21 items). In wave 2, 13 of the items assessed 
the occurrence of concurrent stress/trauma, the most frequent of which included ‘severe 
financial problems’, ‘family member put in jail’ and ‘care for an ill family member’. Also at 
wave 2, labor anxiety was assessed using a 5-item subscale of the Childbirth Self-Efficacy 
Inventory46, social support was assessed using the Family APGAR 47, a five-item 5-point 
scale that measures family functioning, and the client’s appraisal of the quality of her 
maternity care providers was assessed using the Health Care Alliance Questionnaire, a 16-
item scale adapted from therapeutic alliance measurements48.
 Postpartum Adaptation—Using the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire49, 
participants self-rated problematic bonding with their infant and indicated whether they were 
breastfeeding at wave 3. Depression was assessed using the Postpartum Depression 
Screening Scale (PDSS)50 which is more detailed and valid in obstetric settings compared to 
other common screening measures 51. It provides a continuous score (35–175), with a 
validated cutoff >80 indicating probable depressive diagnosis50.
 Plan for Analyses
 Missingness—Prior to analyses addressing the primary research aim, we performed 
imputation of missing data. First, item-level imputation was done to compensate for a single 
item omission error of a PTSD symptom at wave 2 and 3 using the dissociation score and 
trauma items (Receptive Operative Characteristics curve of .91). Following guidelines52, we 
also imputed for attrition because 42.9% had missing data at wave 2 and 51.1% at wave 3. 
These rates are consistent with methodological studies showing imputation should not yield 
bias in parameter estimates53–55. Attrition analyses found those who completed all three 
waves of data collection had significantly lower cumulative sociodemographic risk than 
those lost to follow up, but there were no significant differences in PTSD status or outcome 
variables of interest. We proceeded with the SAS PROC TRAJ procedure with a Poisson 
distribution, an approach that handles random wave nonresponse. Results describing the

 complete dataset (N=319) and a smaller dataset without missing values (n=156) were 
similar.
 Hypothesis testing—To examine the course of PTSD symptoms across peripartum, we 
conducted semiparametric, group-based trajectory analysis56. Conclusions about the best 
number and shape of the trajectory groups are based on the Bayesian Information Criterion 
(BIC)56, seeking the most parsimonious models56. To examine demographic, historical, and 
gestational predictors (N=319) and postpartum adaptation (n=156) that might explain the 
distinct PTSD trajectories, we utilized two-tailed ANOVAs and chi-square tests, and General 
Linear Model regressions with manual backward steps.
 Results
 PTSD symptom trajectory groups
Posterior probability scores ≥ .80 were calculated to assign each participant to a trajectory 
yielding the optimal number of distinct PTSD trajectories of four, with quadratic shapes 
(BIC=-2431; Figure 1). This means that PTSD symptoms over time were likely to follow a 
non-linear path for all groups; however, the groups meaningfully differed from each other. 
We identified two groups with rapid symptom changes across gestation: a rapidly increasing 
group (Increase), and a rapidly decreasing group (Decrease). These groups had significantly 
different starting points in early pregnancy, with Increase intercept significantly lower than 
Decrease (t(173)=−15.54, p <.001). Across gestation the trajectories of these 2 groups cross
— Increase shows significant rise from T1 to T2 (t(84)= −10.00, p=.000), whereas Decrease 
shows significant decline (t(98)=15.85, p=.000). At 6 weeks postpartum Increase endpoint is 
significantly higher than Decrease (t(181)=5.41, p <.001).
In contrast, the other two trajectory groups show more stable patterns. One group shows 
constant low PTSD symptoms across pregnancy to 6 weeks postpartum (Low; T1 to T2 
t(49)= −.49, p=ns, and T2 to T3 (t(49)= −2.19, p=.033). Finally, the remaining trajectory 
group shows a slow significant decline of PTSD symptoms across this time period (T1 to T2 
(t(86)=3.93, p=.000); and T2 to T3 (t(86)=6.45, p=.000), yet remains overall significantly 
above all other PTSD trajectory groups (High).
PTSD diagnostic rates highlight the clinical significance of these PTSD symptom 
trajectories throughout peripartum (see bottom of Figure 1).
 Demographic, historical, and gestational factors by trajectory group
First we analyzed demographic and historical predictors to PTSD trajectory groups (Table 
2). Women in the trajectory groups that showed low PTSD symptom load in early gestation 
(i.e., Low and Increase) were less likely non-White (X2(3, N=318)=44.05, p=.000), poor 
(F(3, 306)=20.42, p=.000), single (X2(3, N=319)=45.30, p=.000), and very young (F(3, 
315)=29.75, p=.000), and overall had less cumulative risk (F(3, 315)=39.59, p=.000) (< 21 
years, < $15,000, <=HS education, non-White, and not having a partner) compared to 
women in the other 2 groups (i.e., Decrease and High). Not having a high school education 
(X2(3, N=319)=72.38, p=.000) followed a dose effect in the expected direction (Low > 
Increase > Decrease > High).

 As historical predictors, we tested lifetime PTSD and dissociation symptoms, and lifetime 
trauma exposure. We found that Low and Increase had fewer lifetime PTSD symptoms than 
Decrease and High (F(3, 315)=28.87, p=.000). Moreover, Low experienced significantly less 
child abuse than High (F(3, 315)=3.77, p=.011). Finally, lifetime dissociation scores also 
differed by group (F(3, 315)=4.27, p=.006); Low and Decrease were similar in dissociation 
scores, and both had significantly lower scores than High. Lifetime adult abuse and lifetime 
non-abuse trauma did not differentiate group membership.
We next explored gestational factors and found anticipatory labor anxiety, social support, 
comorbid depression, and trauma exposure during pregnancy as relevant for symptom 
course. Specifically, we found that Low experienced less labor anxiety compared to all other 
groups (F(3, 147)=6.09, p=.001); and had significantly more social support than High (F(3, 
178)=3.48, p=.017). Low and Increase also had less comorbid depression compared to 
Decrease and High (X2(3, N=319)=13.43, p=.004). Trauma-exposure differed by group 
status (F(3, 178)=3.48, p=.017), but this time Low and Decrease were less likely to 
experience trauma compared to Increase and High. Health care alliance did not differentiate 
group membership.
 Post-Hoc Analyses Predicting PTSD symptom crossing patterns
Intrigued by the crossing pregnancy PTSD trajectory patterns (Increase vs Decrease), we 
investigated predictors of these patterns, using for each as contrast the group with 
complimentary starting point. We found as predictors for Increase (compared to Low) 
having more stressors during pregnancy (β=1.448, p=.013) and more labor anxiety (β=.274, 
p=.015) (X2(3, N=72)=16.49, p=.000; Nagelkerke R2=.281). By contrast, predictors for 
Decrease (compared to High) were less pregnancy stressors (β=1.307, p=.016) and less 
lifetime PTSD symptoms (β=.376, p=.001) (X2(3, N=79)=25.18, p=.000; Nagelkerke R2=.
364).
 Trajectory group impact on postpartum adaptation
PTSD trajectory group membership, rather than initial baseline PTSD status, was 
significantly associated with postpartum adaptation (Table 3). Women across the PTSD 
trajectory groups differed on 6 weeks postpartum depression (X2(3, N=156)=12.17, p=.007), 
with Increase group showing greatest prevalence of major depression (52.3%), followed by 
Decrease and High (48.4% and 41.7%, respectively), and then Low (15.2%). Results for 
bonding impairment paralleled depression findings (F(3, 152)=6.08, p=.001), such that 
Increase mothers reported highest bonding problems with their infants compared to all other 
groups. Low rates of breastfeeding at 6 weeks postpartum were associated with mothers’ 
PTSD symptoms in early pregnancy, but not concurrent PTSD (F(3, 155)=15.843, p=.001).
 Discussion
In this secondary data analysis paper utilizing a sample of pregnant community women with 
PTSD risk, we aimed to examine naturalistically occurring patterns of PTSD symptoms 
across gestation and early postpartum (i.e., peripartum), and relate symptom occurrence to. 
presence or absence of various demographic, historical, and gestational factors. We found

 four distinct patterns of PTSD symptoms across peripartum. We had proposed, that women 
with PTSD risk based on lifetime/current PTSD diagnoses such as those in our sample, 
would all increase in PTSD symptoms across gestation. However, in contrast to our primary 
hypothesis, only one group (26% of sample) significantly increased in PTSD symptoms over 
peripartum. This was surprising and unexpected. Moreover, the majority of women in our 
sample (58%) started with high PTSD rates, and these women all significantly decreased in 
symptom load throughout peripartum. We identified, not surprisingly, several risk factors 
(i.e., current/lifetime PTSD symptoms, history of child abuse, demographic risk) associated 
with higher PTSD symptoms at the early pregnancy starting point. Furthermore, variation in 
women’s PTSD trajectories across peripartum was best predicted by their experience of 
pregnancy stress/trauma exposure, labor anxiety, and lifetime PTSD symptoms; confirming 
our second hypothesis that stress/trauma during pregnancy would be a particularly salient 
predictor for symptom exacerbation. Finally, PTSD trajectory was significantly associated 
with postpartum adjustment such that women whose PTSD symptoms rose during 
pregnancy were most impacted by postpartum depression and subjective bonding 
impairment with their infant at 6 weeks postpartum.
In contrast with our first hypothesis and despite substantial impairment during early 
pregnancy, the majority of vulnerable women in our cohort did not increase in PTSD 
symptoms during peripartum. In fact, the two highest-risk groups of women who had started 
pregnancy with high PTSD symptoms (High and Decrease) both dropped in PTSD diagnosis 
across peripartum by almost half, confirming prior work 34 that showed PTSD symptom 
reduction in postpartum. We speculate that increases in estradiol and progresterone 
concentrations at the end of pregnancy 57 may be associated with lower perceived distress 
and more positive perception of peripartum to promote reproduction and offspring care58. 
This was pronounced in High mothers who reported low subjective bonding impairment. 
These significant improvements in the High group occurred despite these women carrying 
great historical and psychosocial burden: 50–70% of these High women had entered 
pregnancy with a current PTSD diagnosis, the majority had high lifetime PTSD symptoms, 
childhood abuse exposure, were younger, more likely poor, uneducated, single and of ethnic 
minority status. All these risks are in fact associated with greater illness burden in the 
literature (28,59,60,61), thus, it is interesting that PTSD women actually improve in symptom 
load across pregnancy. More research with larger samples and a wider range of potential 
predictors (e.g., physical health complications, factors related to maternity care, mental 
health treatment, biological markers etc) is needed to shed light on this phenomenon.
Women classified in Decrease dropped dramatically in PTSD diagnoses across pregnancy 
(56.6 % to only 1.8%). Interestingly, Decrease members shared one similar feature with the 
Low group—only a few experienced stress/trauma during pregnancy. Based on these 
findings, we propose that excessive stress/trauma exposure during pregnancy is the most 
salient factor for mental health in pregnancy and immediate postpartum, confirming our 
second hypothesis and prior work on the detrimental effects of trauma/stress on maternal 
perinatal outcomes 8,10,62..
The women showing the greatest change in risk constellation across gestation were mothers 
in the Increase group; starting with low PTSD symptoms and increasing to high rates of

 active illness in postpartum (PTSD: 23%; MDD: 52%). The predictors for this striking 
deterioration were 2-fold more exposure to stress/trauma during pregnancy, and higher 
labor–related anxiety compared to members in the Low group. This is consistent with past 
studies finding that interim stress or trauma leads to a 2.4-fold increase in PTSD symptoms 
across pregnancy 34.
Increase mothers showed highest rates of postpartum mental illness (>50% depression and 
22% PTSD) and reported the highest levels of subjective bonding impairment with their 
infants. This finding is consistent with prior research showing link between postpartum 
mental illness and poor bonding63. While bonding impairment is a mother’s self-perception 
and open to distortions, prior research has show associations to observed parenting 63. 
Because bonding impairment was associated with PTSD trajectory across pregnancy, and 
not simply the postpartum PTSD symptom load alone, our data seem to validate the clinical 
utility of longitudinal data collection over and above cross-sectional data. Interestingly, 
breastfeeding frequencies were not associated with group trajectories, even in Increase 
mothers, who had high rates of postpartum psychopathology. Perhaps breastfeeding may be 
more a product of education and other demographic factors64, than driven by 
psychopathology.
Our findings are a novel contribution to the field as no known past research has considered 
factors related to PTSD symptom trajectories across the perinatal period. Put together, our 
results highlight the essential need for repeated assessment of symptomology during this 
time given the substantial fluctuation in symptoms. This is relevant for several reasons. First, 
it gives a message of hope that a current/lifetime diagnosis of PTSD is by no means 
deterministic of worsening PTSD in the perinatal period. In fact, results indicate that it is 
more likely than not that PTSD symptoms will remain the same or get better during the 
perinatal period. Second, it highlights a vulnerable group (Increase) and describes factors 
that providers can identify as heightening risk for symptom exacerbation (e.g., pregnancy 
stressors/trauma, labor-related anxiety, lifetime PTSD load). Preventing symptom 
exacerbation and manifest postpartum illness protects the offspring from the detrimental 
impact of postpartum mental illness on parental capacity 65. Treatment providers could 
quickly identify (via a few questions/brief screening measures) mothers who are 
experiencing such risk factors and heighten awareness for support, case management and 
referrals for treatment. Lastly, our results identify a modifiable protective factor that 
promotes resilience in risk women with lifetime-PTSD, namely social support (more so than 
healthcare alliance).
 Limitations
This study selected participants with heightened risk for PTSD who at baseline met either 
lifetime or current diagnostic criteria, thus women’s symptom levels at baseline were high. 
As such, generalizability of the findings from this population to other obstetrics populations 
and women with less baseline risk may be limited. In order to maximize our sample size, we 
imputed data; this is a limitation, which is mitigated by the use of a sophisticated approach 
and by validation of results of the total dataset using the non-imputed data (n=156). It would 
have benefitted the study if measures assessed at only wave 2 were assessed at multiple time

 points to better understand their roles as group determinants. Although we may infer 
negative child outcomes of mothers with subjective impaired bonding and postpartum 
psychopathology based on the literature, we remain cautious in this implication and suggest 
future research directly investigate this link. As our study was a secondary analysis with 
limited range of collected variables potential confounding factors (e.g., physical health 
complications etc.) that may influence PTSD risk were unavailable. Lastly, we focused on 
the progression of PTSD, and although the overlap of PTSD with depression was high for 
some groups, for others the link was more distinct. Future studies could better understand 
the interaction of these two psychopathologies over time. Please note, PTSD diagnosis is 
based on DSM-IV66 criteria.
