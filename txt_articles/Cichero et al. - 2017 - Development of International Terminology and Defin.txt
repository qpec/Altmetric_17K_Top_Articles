Abstract Dysphagia is estimated to affect *8% of the
world’s population (*590 million people). Texture-mod-
ified foods and thickened drinks are commonly used to
reduce the risks of choking and aspiration. The Interna-
tional Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI)
was founded with the goal of developing globally stan-
dardized terminology and definitions for texture-modified
foods and liquids applicable to individuals with dysphagia
of all ages, in all care settings, and all cultures. A multi-
professional volunteer committee developed a dysphagia
diet framework through systematic review and stakeholder
consultation. First, a survey of existing national termi-
nologies and current practice was conducted, receiving
2050 responses from 33 countries. Respondents included
individuals with dysphagia; their caregivers; organizations
supporting individuals with dysphagia; healthcare profes-
sionals; food service providers; researchers; and industry.
The results revealed common use of 3–4 levels of food
texture (54 different names) and C3 levels of liquid
thickness (27 different names). Substantial support was
expressed for international standardization. Next, a sys-
tematic review regarding the impact of food texture and

Introduction
Standardized terminology exists to reduce misunderstand-
ing and ambiguity and to improve communication effi-
ciency [1]. The field of dysphagia has benefited from
standardized scales in outcome measurement that allow
clinicians to reliably document change in status during
management. Examples of dysphagia-specific standardized
scales include the Penetration–Aspiration Scale [2]; the
Swal-QOL and Swal-CARE [3]; the Dysphagia Outcome
Severity Scale [4]; and the Functional Oral Intake Scale
[5]. However, despite the fact that texture modification is
one of the most common intervention approaches for
dysphagia [6], the descriptions of thickened drinks and
texture-modified foods vary throughout the world, includ-
ing within countries, and even across hospitals located with
close geographic proximity [7]. We hypothesize that a
standardized framework for dysphagia diets could offer
benefits including but not limited to improved patient
safety; improved communication within and between
health professionals, healthcare providers and patients;
increased visibility of professional interventions; and
greater opportunities to collect and evaluate treatment
outcomes [7–11]). Of these, the two most compelling
reasons to pursue standardization of dysphagia diets are to
promote patient safety and to facilitate evolution of the
field to deliver better treatment outcomes.
Much like dose-driven medication prescriptions for
different severities of medical conditions, individuals with
dysphagia are assessed and prescribed graded food textures
and drink thicknesses that are commensurate with their
physical and cognitive abilities. Also similar to medication
adverse events, inconsistencies and errors in labeling of
texture-modified foods have unfortunately resulted in
deaths attributed to the delivery of inappropriate food
textures to patients with dysphagia [7, 12–14]. In recent
years, a number of countries have worked hard to create
standards for texture-modified foods and thickened drinks
with the goal of improving patient safety and care
[7, 15–20]. However, with an increase in mobility of the
global community and access to information via the
internet, the plethora of dysphagia diet terminology, labels,
numbers, and levels of food texture and thickened drinks
has only led to greater opportunities for confusion. Fur-
thermore, a proliferation of companies producing thicken-
ers and ready-to-use products means that patients and their
caregivers cannot assume similarity in thickness across
brands. This scenario is in contrast to expectations of
bioequivalence in medicine between name brand medica-
tions and generic versions, which must have the same
active ingredient, strength, dosage form, and route of
administration as the brand name product [21]. There is no
such regulation of dysphagia products to ensure ‘like-for-
like’ in terms of commercially prepared fluid thickness
levels or food texture modification. To be fair, manufac-
turers cannot be held accountable for producing products
that conform to standards until such standards have been
established, and this requires stakeholder agreement, clar-
ity regarding labels, detailed definitions, and testing
methods to demonstrate conformance to desired properties.
A lack of standardized nomenclature regarding food
texture and drink thickness is a major barrier to research in
the dysphagia field. Without clear definitions, we cannot
presume that the outcomes of research conducted on the
efficacy of prescribing ‘nectar-thick’ drinks for patients

 with Parkinson’s disease in one country, for example, can
be generalized around the world. Use of a term such as
‘nectar-thick’ in research conducted in the USA (e.g.,
[22, 23]) may not translate to products or liquid consis-
tencies used in other countries, such as the United King-
dom, Japan, or Australia, regardless of the fact that each
has a set of National Descriptors. Without agreement on a
single standardized terminology, clinical research and
development of therapies is impeded.
The International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Ini-
tiative Inc. (IDDSI) was founded in 2012 by a multi-pro-
fessional international group of volunteers. IDDSI is an
independent, not-for profit entity (Incorporation Number
IA40577). The ultimate objective of the initiative is to
pursue a patient-safety-oriented innovation in practice,
based on consideration of research evidence, current
practice, and stakeholder feedback. There was no plan for
the initiative to address the nutritional adequacy or the
patient acceptability of texture-modified foods or thickened
fluids.
The aims of the initiative that are discussed in this
manuscript were to
1.
determine the number of food texture and drink
thickness levels for international standardized use
(adult and pediatric);
2.
develop culturally sensitive standard names/identifiers
for each food and drink level;
3.
develop detailed definitions for each level of food
texture and drink thickness;
4.
develop user-friendly, inexpensive, easily accessible
measurement methods for determining classification of
food textures and thickened drinks;
5.
seek input and consensus from international stake-
holders; and
6.
publish and widely communicate the international
standards.
The process used to develop the framework follows the
key elements of evidence-based practice guideline devel-
opment including those recommended by the National
Health
and
Medical
Research
Council
of
Australia
(NHMRC), the National Institute of Health and Clinical
Excellence in the UK (NICE), the New Zealand Guidelines
Group (NZGG), the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline
Network (SIGN), the Council of Europe, and the World
Health Organization (WHO) [24]. These key elements
include: establishment of a multidisciplinary guideline
development group; involvement of consumers; clear
identification of clinical issues; systematic review and
appraisal of quality literature; a process for drafting the
recommendation of the multidisciplinary group; and con-
sultation with others beyond the multidisciplinary frame-
work development group [24, 25].
Methods
Strategy and Incorporation
An inaugural multi-professional expert panel meeting was
held in Toronto, Canada (2012) to discuss international
standardization of terminology and definitions for texture-
modified foods and drinks. A snowball sampling method-
ology was used to populate the expert panel following
initial recruitment of two members with experience in the
development of national terminologies [7, 19] and one who
had commenced but not completed national terminology
development in Canada (PL). Remaining members were
invited to join the panel based on their previous work with
national guideline development [16], their representation of
key stakeholder groups, and their ability to contribute
international perspectives. In 2013, IDDSI was incorpo-
rated as an independent, not-for-profit association operat-
ing under the regulatory guidelines of its registration in
Australia. Two people volunteered to be co-chairs, with ten
others agreeing to serve as members of the IDDSI Foun-
dation Committee. All positions were voluntary. The
committee, representing ten countries, was composed of
experts from the fields of Nutrition and Dietetics, Food
Service and Catering, Speech Pathology, Occupational
Therapy,
Physiotherapy,
Gastroenterology,
Nursing,
Mechanical Engineering, and Food Science. The group
counted among its members published scientists, journal
editors, representatives from international organizations
such as the Patient Safety - Nursing Directorate, National
Health Service (NHS) England, and internationally recog-
nized dysphagia clinicians and researchers. The committee
met by teleconference on a monthly basis, with two in-
person meetings over the project period (2013–2015).
Sponsors were approached for financial support to cover
costs associated with administration, research, and data
analysis (e.g., research assistant support for the systematic
review). At no time have sponsors been involved with the
design or development of the IDDSI framework; rather,
IDDSI sponsors have been briefed about IDDSI progress
using time-zone sensitive teleconferences at key milestones
over the course of the IDDSI project. Professional associ-
ations and organizations were also contacted to alert them
to the IDDSI project and invite their participation and
support.
A dedicated website was developed to provide an
internationally accessible repository for information and a
way for interested individuals or groups to contact IDDSI
(www.iddsi.org). The IDDSI project plan, committee
member profiles, lists of supporting organizations, and
sponsors can be found on the website. A multi-phased work
plan was approved by the committee with the goal of

 bringing forth a framework between 2013 and 2015. Each
of these phases is summarized in Fig. 1.
Ethical Considerations
The IDDSI committee considered ethical issues associated
with the collection of survey data in different phases of the
project. It was agreed that participation in IDDSI surveys
involved minimal risk and was entirely voluntary. The
committee agreed that the purpose of each survey and the
overall project would be communicated at the time of
invitations to participate. The introductory text of IDDSI
surveys stated clearly that information gathered from
individuals or organizations would remain non-identifying
in all reports arising from the project. Participants were
also free to withhold responses to survey questions at any
stage without penalty. Several key stakeholder groups were
identified and attempts were made to disseminate invita-
tions regarding survey opportunities to all of these groups.
To avoid commercial conflicts of interest, it was agreed
that industry sponsors would not be involved with any
aspects of IDDSI sub-project design, conduct, writing, or
interpretation of results.
Review of Existing National Terminologies
A review of existing national terminologies was conducted
and published in 2013. Further details can be found in the
open access journal publication [26].
Survey 1 (International Current Practice)
In 2013, a set of five stakeholder-specific surveys was
developed to gather information regarding the current use
of standardized dysphagia diet terminology or other terms
used, any testing done prior to serving to ensure correct
consistency/thickness and appropriate texture, use of
schemes to differentiate levels (e.g., colors, shapes), and
comments or recommendations for the development of an
international standardized framework. Each survey was
tailored to one of five stakeholder groups: (a) individuals
with dysphagia, their caregivers, or organizations providing
support to people with dysphagia; (b) healthcare profes-
sionals and food service professionals; (c) dysphagia
research scholars; d) industry representatives from com-
panies manufacturing texture-modified foods; and (e) in-
dustry
representatives
from
companies
manufacturing
thickeners or thickened drinks for people with dysphagia.
English language style and complexity of the surveys was
adjusted to be appropriate for each group. There were
commonalities in some survey questions, while other ele-
ments were specific to stakeholder experiences (see
Table 1).
Surveys comprised forced choice and free-text response
formats. An information sheet about the survey and invi-
tation to participate were translated by native speaker
volunteers into 10 languages other than English. Surveys
were launched via the IDDSI website to individuals who
had signed up to receive information about the initiative. In
addition, 45 national healthcare professional associations
and three dysphagia-specific associations were emailed
information about the survey and asked to forward notices
to their membership with embedded web links to facilitate
ease of survey access. Invitations to complete the survey
were also announced at international conferences. Survey
responses were collected from October 2013 to November
2014 using SurveymonkeyTM. Upon closure of the surveys,
the response data were transferred to an independent
research group for analysis (Australian Survey Research

 Group) in order that the IDDSI committee did not have any
opportunity to inadvertently bias the results.
Systematic Review of the Literature
A systematic review of the literature regarding the influ-
ence of food texture and liquid consistency on swallowing
physiology was conducted in 2014, with the results pub-
lished in 2015. The key findings from the systematic
review showed that there is evidence that thicker liquids
not only reduce the risk of penetration–aspiration, but also
increase the risk of post-swallow residue in the pharynx.
Further, the existing literature is insufficient to support the
delineation of specific viscosity boundaries or other quan-
tifiable material properties related to clinical outcomes.
With regards to food texture used in dysphagia manage-
ment, the systematic review determined that the best
available evidence for selecting optimal food consistency
comes from careful exploration of tolerance for different
foods as part of a comprehensive swallowing assessment.
The systematic review also demonstrated evidence that
solid food and thick consistencies require greater effort in
oral processing and swallowing. Note that terms related to
choking, airway obstruction, or asphyxiation were not
included in the search strategy for the systematic review.
Further details can be found in the open access journal
publication [27, 28].
Draft Framework Development
With information gathered from (a) existing national dys-
phagia diet terminology from around the world [26]; (b) the
current practice international stakeholder surveys; and
(c) the systematic review [27, 28], the IDDSI committee
gathered in Vancouver, Canada in January, 2015 for a 2 �
day in-person expert panel meeting to develop a draft
international
framework.
Committee
members
from
Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United King-
dom were able to attend in person, covering areas of
expertise in nutrition and dietetics, food service and
catering, speech pathology, occupational therapy, physio-
therapy, food science, mechanical engineering, research,
and both adult and pediatric clinical dysphagia services.
Input from absent committee members on key questions
was obtained via e-mail and telephone both during the
meeting and over the following months.
The objectives of the expert panel meeting were to
determine
(a)
the number of levels of texture-modified foods for
inclusion in a new standardized international dyspha-
gia diet framework;
(b)
the number of levels for thin and thickened drinks for
inclusion in a new standardized international dyspha-
gia diet framework;
(c)
English language labels for texture-modified foods at
each level;
(d)
English language labels for thickened drinks at each
level;
(e)
a numbering system;
(f)
whether to use a color scheme;
(g)
graphical representations to capture the framework;
(h)
detailed definitions and descriptions of the texture or
flow characteristics of food and drink items included
at each level; and
(i)
reproducible testing methods to enable end users to
assign foods and drinks to the different levels.
A group nomination process was used to achieve deci-
sions for objectives a) to g). After discussion of the
available evidence (both from the scientific literature and
collected through the current international practice survey),
motions were put forward and committee members indi-
cated their agreement or dissent through a blinded ballot
process. Unanimous voting resulted in adoption of that

 particular motion. Less than unanimous voting resulted in
further rounds of discussion and further blinded voting
until unanimous consensus was reached. There were only
two occasions where a second round of voting was
required.
Classification of levels and exploration
of measurement methods
Based on consideration of the scientific and survey evi-
dence, the IDDSI Committee achieved consensus that a
new framework should include 5 levels of drink thickness
(thin plus 4 levels of thickness) and 5 levels of food texture
(regular plus 4 levels of modification). The next aim was to
define and describe the specific texture/flow characteristics
for each level.
Liquids
Thirteen powder, gel, or liquid-thickening agents and four
brands of commercially pre-prepared thickened liquids
(produced by manufacturers from Australia, Canada,
Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of
America) were either donated or purchased prior to the
meeting. Thickening agents included starch, gums, or
combinations of starch and gums. Participants at the face-
to-face meeting worked in pairs to prepare samples of
graded thickness according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. The various thickening agents were mixed with
cranberry juice (Ocean Spray). Previous national guideli-
nes have identified a need for dysphagia diet frameworks to
include a level for thickened infant milk, which is thinner
than the first level of thickness commonly used for adults,
but will still flow through a nipple/teat [7]. Therefore, in
cases where the manufacturer’s instructions on products
typically used for adults specified only three gradations of
thickening, an additional level between thin and the first
level of thickening was prepared to produce a thickness
akin to thickened infant milk. Half of the manufacturer
recommended the amount of thickener for the first level of
thickened drinks was used to prepare this new thickness
level. Samples of human milk and infant formulas,
including specialty anti-regurgitation, semi-elemental, and
elemental formulas were also prepared and thickened with
a view to ensuring that the framework would address needs
across the pediatric-to-adult continuum. The resulting array
of samples comprised four columns by 17 rows of liquid,
such that the far left column was the thickest item and the
far right column was the thinnest for that product according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. This array, which is
illustrated by the schematic diagram in Fig. 2, allowed
comparison of consistency across the nominally similar
items in each row. Participants then continued to work in
pairs to evaluate, measure, and describe the flow charac-
teristics of all items in the array.
As well as assessing the consistency of products in each
level, participants concurrently assessed the efficacy and
reliability of several available methods for subjective and
objective measurement, including: visual inspection; stir-
ring; pouring from a spoon or cup; oral sampling and
tasting; the line spread test [29]; and gravity flow tests
using drinking straws and syringes of various dimensions.
Rheological data were not obtained at the time, however,
some members of the committee had familiarity with
existing rheological measures for some of the products
present. Based on these extensive tests, clusters of similarly
behaving liquids were created. Further testing and discus-
sion enabled the committee to confirm the similarity of
liquids in each of five clusters corresponding to five levels
of
drink
thickness
(including
thin)
and
to
develop
descriptions of the flow characteristics of each level. The
syringe-based flow test was confirmed to be the preferred
testing method for quantifying liquid consistency and it
was agreed that four members of the committee with food
science expertise would do further testing of this method
upon return to their cities of origin to confirm construct
validity in comparison to laboratory rheology and to
establish boundary points between levels for liquids with
different flow characteristics. This subsequent verification
testing led to finalization of the IDDSI Syringe Flow Test
(see Results section, below). The syringe-based flow test
also affords the ability to evaluate liquids that are not
typically considered ‘drinks’ such as condiments (e.g.,
sauces), liquid foods (soups), and nutritional supplements
or liquid medication. The text term ‘thickened liquids’ is
intended to include all of these items in addition to thick-
ened drinks.
Foods
In order to develop a system for categorizing food texture,
labels and descriptors for five different levels were pro-
posed through a group nomination process. A hotel chef
(naı
¨ve to dysphagia and texture-modified food used for this
population) was then asked to prepare foods from the hotel
menu in consistencies matching the draft labels. These
samples, together with samples of ready-to-use texture-
modified foods donated by industry, were assessed by the
committee using spoons and forks (dropping and pressure
tests) and oral appraisal, providing the opportunity to
consider mouthfeel and the behavior of the sample in the
mouth.
Through debate to the point of group consensus, the
committee developed definitions of thickened liquids and
texture-modified foods, together with the physiologic
rationale for each level in the draft framework. Descriptors

 and physiologic rationale for each level were based on the
shared experience of experimenting with a very broad
range of currently available dysphagia products, combined
with each expert’s relevant experience, and drawing from
descriptions in all available national standard documents.
Proposed labels were assessed via readability scores
(Flesch–Kincaid Reading Ease score [30]) to confirm ease
and understanding of terms in English. In addition, trans-
lation to languages other than English was achieved with
assistance from personal contacts and volunteers, so that
provisional translations of the terms were developed over
the next month in Afrikaans, Arabic, Dutch, Farsi, French,
German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Man-
darin, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and Viet-
namese. Preferred methods of objective testing for liquids
and foods were discussed with plans to review and finalize
these following laboratory assessments upon return to cities
of origin and a planned second international stakeholder
survey of the draft framework. These steps led to a con-
sensus-based and evidence-informed draft framework for
public consultation, described in the Results section below.
Survey 2: Feedback on Draft IDDSI Framework
A second international stakeholder online survey was
designed with assistance from the Australian Survey
Research group (ASR) to gather feedback on the draft
framework. ASR administered, analyzed, and reported on
the survey. The survey was announced and disseminated in
the same way as the preceding current practice survey.
Respondents were specifically asked to use Likert-scale
responses with additional free-text comment boxes to
•
provide demographic information (e.g., the stakeholder
group they identified with; country they lived/worked
in);
•
provide feedback regarding the draft framework:
•
colors (ability to distinguish; ease of implementa-
tion; ease of reproducibility);
•
number of levels (too few/too many, about right;
ease of implementation);
•
pyramid
diagram
(ease
of
understanding
and
implementation);
•
names or labels of each level (ease of understanding
and implementation);
•
specific questions about the terms ‘‘slightly thick’’
liquids, ‘‘minced and moist’’ food, and the label
‘‘Level 7 minus’’;
•
detailed definitions of each level (ease of under-
standing; usefulness; relevance); and
•
the Syringe Test (ease of understanding; likelihood
of implementing the test).
•
Comment about the overall framework; and
•
what works well with the proposed framework;
likelihood of implementation; and factors that
would assist or impede implementation.
The online survey was open from May 1 to 1 June 1,
2015. The results of the stakeholder survey informed the
final framework. Robust committee discussion followed
via email and teleconferences between July–November
2015. The final framework comprises: (a) a diagram of the
framework, including labels and colors; (b) detailed defi-
nitions and testing methods for liquids; and (c) detailed

Results
Survey 1 (Current International Practice)
The current practice survey yielded responses from 2050
participants representing 33 countries. The majority of
responses came from Canada, the USA, Australia, New
Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Figure 3 illustrates the
distribution of respondents by stakeholder group. Eighty
percent of health professionals who responded saw adults
with dysphagia, 8.2% saw children with dysphagia, and
16.5% saw a mixed caseload. Health professionals pre-
dominantly saw individuals in hospital settings (
[
60%) and
approximately one quarter saw individuals in the commu-
nity or aged care settings.
Healthcare professional respondents reported use of
both site-prepared and commercial ready-to-use modified
products. This was particularly true with respect to the
preparation of texture-modified foods, for which fewer than
1% reported exclusive use either of commercial or on-site
preparation methods. For drinks, exclusive use of com-
mercially pre-thickened drinks was reported by 17% of
respondents who had pediatric caseloads, and 30% of
respondents whose caseloads included adults or a mix of
adults and children. Exclusive in-house preparation of
thickened drinks was more common for those working with
pediatric caseloads (46%) compared to 30% for those
working with adults or mixed caseloads.
Between 85 and 90% of health professionals reported
using standardized terminology to describe thickened
drinks and texture-modified food. However, considerable
variation in terminology was observed from the responses
obtained both within and between countries around the
world. There were 27 different labels reported to be in use
to refer to B 5 levels of drink thickness. Most commonly,
drink options were reported to include regular thin liquids
plus three or more levels of thickened drinks (see Table 2).
Of particular note, survey responses confirmed use with
pediatric and palliative care clients of slightly thickened
drinks that are thicker than water but thinner than the
thickened
drinks
commonly
used
for
adults
[7, 11, 17, 31–34].
For texture-modified foods, a total of 54 labels were
reported to be in use to refer to B5 levels. Food options
were reported to commonly include regular, non-modified
foods plus four to five levels of texture modification (see
Table 3). Responses from all stakeholder groups indicated
support for international standardization.
The survey responses showed that some terms were not
commonly used or familiar in all countries. For example,
the terms ‘‘pudding,’’ ‘‘minced,’’ and ‘‘nectar’’ while
understood by respondents from western cultures were not
understood by respondents from Asia. Some currently used
terms were considered to be problematic for certain pop-
ulations. For example, it was noted that in the pediatric
population and specifically children under 12 months of
age, ‘honey from bees’ is contraindicated due to botulism
risk. Thus, use of the term ‘honey thick’ was not felt to be
an appropriate label for liquids served to pediatric popu-
lations. In addition, comments suggested that perceptions
of honey differ considerably, as honey comes in crystalline,
thick, and thin runny forms. Color coding was reported to
be the most commonly used schema (53%) for differenti-
ating different levels of thickened drinks or texture-modi-
fied foods; however, there was no congruency in colors
chosen.
Of the respondents to the healthcare and food service
professional stakeholder survey, 41 and 43%, respectively,
reported that they test the consistency of foods and drinks
to confirm suitability prior to serving. Consistency testing
was more common among patients and caregivers, of
whom, 57 and 60% reported testing foods and drinks,
respectively. Visual inspection or observation was the most
commonly used method of testing, regardless of stake-
holder type. Patients, caregivers, and health professionals
also reported using a spoon drop test or a utensil such as a
fork for testing foods and liquids. Industry respondents,
however, were most likely to assess liquids using a vis-
cometer, Bostwick consistometer, or rheometer, in con-
junction
with
visual
inspection.
For
foods,
industry
respondents reported use of a texture analyzer, sieve,
Bostwick consistometer, and visual inspection.

 Draft IDDSI Framework
The draft framework resulting from the 2015 face-to-face
meeting was represented as a continuum of 8 levels with
foods and liquids displayed on a single scale using a twin-
pyramid design showing foods in the top, inverted pyramid
and liquids in the bottom, standing pyramid (see Fig. 4).
The decision to use the pyramid image was partly influ-
enced by the fact that a pyramid was already in use
nationally in Japan for dysphagia diets. In addition to
making decisions about the pyramid graphic, the number of
levels, and the numbering scheme, the committee chose a
draft color scheme with the aim of making each color as
distinguishable as possible. It was decided that the color
red should be avoided, given that red is frequently used as a
color to denote alarm and danger in medical contexts and
may also have other symbolism in some cultures.
A novel feature of the draft framework was the decision
to recognize that certain food textures shared flow
properties with thickened liquids creating an overlap zone
in the middle of the framework. Using the same numbers to
refer to both food and drink items at these levels, recog-
nized the shared flow properties of these textures. Specif-
ically, Level 3 was used both for Liquidized foods and
Moderately Thick fluids, while Level 4 was used both for
Pureed food and Extremely Thick fluids. All other levels
had distinct flow or texture properties.
Draft Definitions
The committee developed detailed definitions for each
level of the draft Framework, based on (a) the measure-
ment activities conducted at the 2015 face-to-face meeting;
(b) drawing from descriptors in all available national
standards documents; and (c) the literature describing
properties that increase risk for choking [35–44]. The draft
definitions included a warning after Level 6 to clarify that
the physiological skills of being able to both bite and chew

 food were required to safely transition to Level 7 Regular
foods. Physiological contraindications for advancing to
Level 7 were listed, such as xerostomia, requirement for
dentures, difficulty managing mixed textures, impulsive
behavior, cognitive impairment, delayed oral skills (den-
tition,
chewing
development),
and
fatigue
(impaired
strength or stamina). A level that was tentatively titled
‘Level 7 Minus’ was included to capture food textures
that are hard in their original state but break down quickly
with moisture or temperature change and can then be
manipulated with minimal chewing or just with tongue
pressure.
Draft Measurement Guidelines
Liquids
The 2015 face-to-face meeting included evaluation and
discussion of the available testing methods for liquids:
viscosity measurement was rejected due to being inacces-
sible in most situations and not necessarily capturing the
important textural properties for swallowing (see ‘‘Dis-
cussion’’ section below). The draft IDDSI framework
included a description of a gravity flow testing method for
liquids using a syringe aiming to provide physiologically
relevant flow conditions in a convenient, accessible, inex-
pensive test (see ‘‘Discussion’’). An explanation of the
gravity flow test was included in the survey to gauge
acceptance of the method prior to final development.
Stakeholder feedback indicated that the test was easy to
understand and to implement. Detailed information about
the gravity flow test is shown in ‘‘Final IDDSI Framework’’
section (see ‘‘Results’’ below).
Foods
Formal assessment of food texture commonly requires
complex and expensive machinery, such as Food Texture
Analyzers. This type of assessment was rejected as a
practical measurement option given the lack of access to
food texture analyzers and expertise or interpretation. The
draft framework did not include quantitative methods for
testing food texture, although the committee agreed that a
method to distinguish food into the various categories was
highly desirable. Subsequent to stakeholder feedback on
the draft framework the committee developed practical
quantitative methods for testing food size and texture (see
‘‘Final IDDSI Framework’’ in ‘‘Results’’ for more details).
Survey 2: International Feedback on Draft IDDSI
Framework
The draft framework was submitted to international
stakeholder consultation with a total of 3190 respondents
residing
in
57
different
countries.
The
majority
of
respondents (87%) were health professionals working with
dysphagia, although responses were also collected from
caterers
providing
food
to
people
with
dysphagia,
researchers/academics, industry that provides products to
people with dysphagia, professional associations, govern-
ment/regulatory bodies, caregivers to persons with dys-
phagia, and persons with dysphagia. Ninety percent of
respondents came from English-speaking backgrounds and
predominantly northern hemisphere countries. Fifty-three
percent of respondents indicated that they or their organi-
zation were likely to implement the framework, with 28%
neutral (see Fig. 5). Fewer than 19% of respondents indi-
cated that implementation of the framework was unlikely.
Feedback regarding the colors representing the different
food textures and thickened drink levels showed that they
were considered easy to distinguish from each other and easy
to implement. The number of levels was considered by more
than two-thirds of respondents to be ‘about right’ and
response to the twin-pyramid design was positive. Eighty
percent of respondents rated the relevance and amount of
information in the detailed definitions as ‘excellent’ or
‘good.’ Seventy-three percent of respondents indicated that
the description of the syringe test was easy to understand.
Clinicians who treated pediatric populations and people with
developmental disability confirmed the need to have a cat-
egory that included ‘meltable’ or ‘dissolvable’ solid foods.
Forty percent of respondents agreed with the inclusion of
Level 7 Minus with the same number neutral regarding its
inclusion. The survey consultants (ASR) recommended that
IDDSI review the framework based on the feedback received
and make adjustments. This process of review and discussion
occurred between June and November 2015.

 Final IDDSI Framework
The final framework is shown in Fig. 6. Notable changes
from the draft to the final framework included delineation
of the ‘transitional foods’ side-bar category to replace
‘Level 7 minus,’ changes to the color scheme and the
inclusion of specific testing methods for foods.
The label ‘Level 7 Minus’ was deleted from the
framework and replaced with the term ‘Transitional foods,’
running alongside Levels 5–7 on the inverted food pyra-
mid. This location reflects the fact that transitional foods
are regular foods (Level 7) with special textural properties
such that with the application of moisture (e.g., saliva) or a
change in temperature, they rapidly change their texture,
crossing boundaries between levels. The colors were
reviewed in detail and assessed for suitability for people
with color blindness (e.g., protanopia, deuteranopia, tri-
tanopia and monochromatism) to distinguish the frame-
work colors. Based on the review, certain colors were
changed to maximize the difference in color between
neighboring levels. The final scheme has six colors plus
black and white that are individually distinguishable across
all the different types of color blindness tested and par-
ticularly for red blind and green blind, which is the most
common variant [45]. Specifically, Level 0 is white; Level
1 is gray; Level 2 is pink; Level 3 is yellow; Level 4 is
green; Level 5 is orange; Level 6 is blue; and Level 7 is
black.
Liquid Specifications and Measurement
The draft framework introduced the concept of the gravity
flow test. The gravity flow test uses a 10-mL slip tip
hypodermic syringe. Although 10-mL syringes were ini-
tially thought to be identical throughout the world based on

 reference to an ISO standard (ISO 7886-1) [46], it has
subsequently been determined that the ISO document
refers only to the nozzle of the syringe and that variability
in barrel length and dimensions may exist between brands.
As illustrated in Fig. 7, a syringe with a measured length of
61.5 mm from the zero line to the 10 mL line was used as
the reference syringe (BDTM syringes were used for the
development of the tests). To conduct the flow measure-
ment, 10 mL of liquid is placed into an empty syringe and
a stopper or finger is placed at the nozzle to impede flow
until ready. When ready, the stopper or finger is removed
from the syringe nozzle with flow allowed for 10 s. At
10 s, the nozzle is again blocked so that the volume of
liquid remaining in the syringe can be recorded. The IDDSI
Flow Test instructions and interpretations are included in
the Appendix in supplementary material. During develop-
mental testing by the committee, the IDDSI Flow Test was
found to be suitable for thin liquids, naturally thick liquids
and liquids thickened with a range of thickening agents
(gums and starches) as well as items such as gravy, sauce,
condiments, smooth soup, nutritional supplements, and
liquid medication. Although the equipment is simple, the
test has been found to categorize a wide range of liquids
reliably in agreement with currently existing laboratory
tests and expert judgment. It has been found to be sensitive
enough to demonstrate small changes in thickness associ-
ated with change in serving temperature. The test requires
that liquids are able to flow under their own weight, which
corresponds to the threshold between level 3 and 4. While
the test can be used to confirm whether a material is above
the threshold for level 4 (no flow will occur), it is more
convenient to simply use a spoon to determine whether the
material is able to hold its shape or not. A number of
countries use Fork Drip Tests to describe flow of thickened
drinks or pureed food in their national terminologies
[7, 17, 19]. Fork Drip Test criteria were developed for
IDDSI Levels 3–5.
Food Texture Specifications and Measurement
The systematic review demonstrated that the properties of
hardness, cohesiveness, and slipperiness were important
factors for consideration [27, 28]. In addition, as noted in
the initial publication documenting the need for a new
international framework, the size and shape of food sam-
ples have been identified as relevant factors for choking
risk [26]. In view of this information, the IDDSI committee
agreed that measurement of foods needed to capture both
the mechanical properties (e.g., hardness, cohesiveness,
adhesiveness, etc.) and the geometrical, size, or shape
attributes of the food. Prior to release of the final frame-
work, the committee worked to develop specifications
based on the best available practical tools: the surveys had
reported that utensils such as forks and spoons were
commonly used for assessment of texture-modified food
and thickened liquids. Assessments using chopsticks and
finger tests have also been incorporated in recognition that
these may be the most accessible methods in some
countries.
Food Particle Size
Assessment of foods requires a combination of evaluation
for particle size and food hardness, cohesiveness, and
adhesiveness. With regard to particle size, 2–4 mm repre-
sents the size of chewed particles that healthy adult indi-
viduals naturally masticate and reduce hard foods to for
swallowing [47]. For Level 5 Minced & Moist, the rec-
ommended particle size for food served to adults is 4 mm.
In recognition of the smaller anatomy and in lieu of pedi-
atric research, for infants, the recommended particle size
for Level 5—Minced & Moist food is 2 mm. The slots/-
gaps between the tines/prongs of a standard metal fork
typically measure 4 mm, which provides a useful compli-
ance measure for particle size of Minced & Moist foods
served to adults.
For hard and soft solid foods served to adults, a maxi-
mum food sample size of *1.5 9 1.5 cm is recom-
mended, which is the approximate size of the adult human
thumb nail [48] and the approximate width (from left to
right] of the tip a standard metal fork. These dimensions

measurement requirements

 represent the food texture industry standard ‘bite sample’
[47, 49], but most importantly are small enough to pass
completely into the average adult trachea rather than
obstruct it at the laryngeal inlet if accidentally inhaled
[50, 51]. Tracheal size for adult males is 22 mm (range
15–27 mm) and for adult females is 17 mm (13–25 mm)
[50]. Furthermore, food particle size of these dimensions
has been identified as reducing asphyxiation risk [51].
Particle sizes for soft and hard food served to children
younger than 5-year old are recommended to be no larger
than 0.8 cm, which again relates to tracheal size and
reduction of asphyxiation and choking risk [52]. Tracheal
size of infants obviously changes as children grow. At age
20 months, the infant’s anteroposterior dimensions of the
region just below the vocal cords, at the entrance to the
trachea are approximately 3.8 mm 9 6.5 mm. At 3 years
4 months (40 months), the dimensions are 7 mm x 3.9 mm
and at 5 years of age the dimensions are approximately
8 mm 9 4 mm [53]. It is for this reason that the Level 6—
Soft & Bite-Sized specifies a particle size of 0.8 cm or less
for children (i.e., 8 mm) and Level 5—Minced & Moist
specifies a pediatric particle size of 0.2 cm (2 mm). Note
also that food samples that are smaller than the maximum
width of the child’s fifth fingernail (littlest finger) are
unlikely to represent a choking risk, as this measurement is
used to predict the internal diameter of an endotracheal
tube in the pediatric population [54].
Food Hardness, Cohesiveness, and Adhesiveness
Chewing results in the breaking down of food, determined
by a number of factors including: toughness, moisture
content of the food, ability to adsorb or absorb saliva, and
the fibrous nature of the food [47, 55]. The level of
moisture content in food has been particularly singled out
as an important variable for determining food readiness for
swallowing [55]. Salivation moistens the food bolus and
assists with softening, disintegration, and dilution, thus
reduced salivation will hinder even fully dentate individ-
uals from adequately preparing a bolus for swallowing.
During particle size reduction while chewing, the normal
bolus is not ‘lump-free,’ however, it is moist and cohesive.
For assessment of cohesiveness and adhesiveness a spoon
tilt test is recommended. In each case the sample should
(a) hold its shape on the spoon; and (b) fall easily from the
spoon when tilted or turned sideways. There should be little
residue left on the spoon. These characteristics provide a
bolus that is moist and cohesive, but not sticky or adhesive.
Quantification of food hardness is technically chal-
lenging because the mechanical structure of foods is gen-
erally complex. In industrial and scientific laboratories, a
food texture analyzer is used to crush a sample of the food
under controlled pressure and motion, but that requires
motors and sensors. A practical test using a fork or spoon
was previously recommended as part of the United King-
dom dysphagia diet standards [19] for assessing foods that
would fall into IDDSI Levels 5–7 and transitional foods.
The test involves applying a fork to the food sample to
observe its behavior when pressure is applied, however,
this varies with the level of force applied by the individual.
In order to provide some standardization of the pressure
applied, the IDDSI fork pressure test recommends that the
fork be pressed onto the food sample by placing the thumb
onto the bowl of the fork (just below the prongs), and
pressing just hard enough to cause blanching of the
thumbnail, Fig. 8a. Blanching occurs when the pressure
overcomes mean arterial blood pressure and has been
quantified at approximately 17 kPa, Fig. 8b. This pressure
corresponds closely to a typical tongue pressure used
during swallowing [56, 57]. In places where forks are not
used, descriptions and testing methods have been devel-
oped for chopsticks and finger pressure testing.
To meet the requirements for Level 6—Soft & Bite-
sized, a food sample should squash with the application of
pressure and not return to its original shape when pressure
is released. Transitional foods can also be identified using
the Fork Pressure Test. For transitional foods, a sample
1.5 9 1.5 cm is placed in a container with 1 mL of water.
Testing occurs after 1 min of food soaking has occurred.
The sample qualifies as transitional food texture if the
sample squashes and disintegrates and no longer resembles
its original shape, or if it has melted significantly so that it
no longer looks like its original shape.
Consistent with existing national terminologies and
evidence from autopsy data, tables showing ‘texture
requirements’ and ‘texture restrictions’ for each level were
generated (see Appendix in supplementary material).
Foods that have been identified in multiple autopsy reviews
to increase choking risk were specifically addressed in a
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) section (www.iddsi.
org).
Release of the Final IDDSI Framework
The final framework was released by staggered roll out.
The framework design including the twin-inverted pyramid
design was launched at the Japanese Society of Dysphagia
Rehabilitation Conference September 2015. The detailed
descriptors for drinks were released online and via poster at
the European Society of Swallowing Disorders Conference
in September 2015; and the detailed descriptors for foods
were released online and at the Food for the Elderly
Conference, Hangzhou, China, in November 2015. Further

Discussion
The International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative
utilized an evidence-based method of guideline develop-
ment [24, 25] to produce new global standardized termi-
nology and definitions to describe texture-modified foods
and thickened liquids used for individuals with dysphagia
of all ages, in all care settings and all cultures. The final
framework was developed with reference to existing
national
terminologies,
empirical
data
from
multiple
international stakeholder consultations of people from 57
countries, systematic review of the research literature and
collaborative, feedback-driven refinement. Feedback about
the framework was collated and analyzed by a research
group independent to IDDSI further strengthening confi-
dence in the refinement of the final framework. The final
framework consists of eight levels (Levels 0–7) that are
identified by numbers, text labels, and color codes. Text
labels have been scrutinized for ease of translation and
color codes have been developed to be sensitive to color
blindness. Descriptors are supported by simple, accessible
yet objective measurement methods that can be used by
people with dysphagia and their caregivers, clinicians, food
service professionals, researchers, and industry to confirm
the level of attribution of a food or liquid. The IDDSI
framework provides a solid platform for the development
of future research in the dysphagia field.
The IDDSI framework provides categorization of liquid
thickness levels applicable to neonates, infants, children,
and adults with dysphagia. The IDDSI systematic review
found evidence confirming that thickening liquids reduces
the likelihood of aspiration, however, it was not able to
pinpoint specific viscosities that represent minimally
effective thickening to reduce aspiration. The review did,
however, find evidence to suggest that some extremely
thick liquids may promote the accumulation of pharyngeal
residue [23, 27, 28, 58]. This finding has been further
corroborated by Newman and colleagues [59], who con-
ducted an independent systematic review of the literature
on the efficacy of thickened liquids for the management of
dysphagia. Recognition that some liquids may promote
residue by being ‘too thick’ is an important development
for the dysphagia field. Given the paucity of research
regarding therapeutic thickness levels for thickened drinks,
the IDDSI framework is based on an understanding that
increasing thickness has a demonstrated therapeutic benefit

number of levels of drink thickness included in the

 the synthesis of international stakeholder consensus on
current clinical practice. The systematic review points to an
urgent need to conduct quality research to determine
specific thickness levels that provide therapeutic benefit by
reducing risk for penetration/aspiration and/or improving
swallowing function. The IDDSI framework provides a
reference point for this research and with future develop-
ments it is anticipated that the IDDSI levels will be refined
to reflect new evidence regarding therapeutic thickness
levels.
International Food Textures for Dysphagia
Management
The IDDSI framework provides categorization of food
textures applicable to babies, infants, children, and adults
with dysphagia. Children younger than three years of age,
adults over 65 years of age, individuals with poor denti-
tion, and those with neurological conditions are at high risk
of death from asphyxiation on food [35, 60]. In healthy
people, regardless of the initial state of the food, after oral
processing and at the point of swallow initiation, the bolus
is a cohesive mass. Texture modification mechanically
alters the food prior to ingestion to the level that is required
to promote safe swallowing of the bolus. The paucity of
research into the therapeutic use of food texture modifi-
cation for dysphagia management means that the recom-
mendations in this document regarding food texture are
based on an understanding that altering food texture
modification has demonstrated a therapeutic benefit for
reducing the risk of choking. Empirical evidence gathered
from the current practice survey indicated that foods are
commonly altered in both size (chopped, diced) and texture
(soft, puree) to reduce choking risk. This practice is con-
sistent with evidence in the literature specific to choking
and asphyxiation risk, which reveals that food textures that
pose the most risk are categorized according to texture,
shape, and size. Specifically, foods that are described as
hard or dry; chewy or sticky; crunch or crumbly; floppy;
fibrous or ‘tough’; have husks; are stringy; round or long in
dimension or consist of multiple or ‘dual’ textures are high
choking risks [35–44]. Additional discussion regarding
choking risk can be found in the IDDSI Foundation
manuscript [26].
The IDDSI framework promotes strict adherence to
both particle size and food texture requirements. For
Level 6—Soft & Bite-Sized, international feedback has
requested justification for the food particle size on this
diet.
To
reduce
choking
risk,
pre-cut
food
to
1.5 9 1.5 cm has been recommended. For easy reference,
it has been determined that the width of a standard dinner
fork (from left to right running perpendicular to the
prongs)
corresponds
approximately
to
this
1.5 cm
dimension. It is not possible to guarantee that a person
with dysphagia will be able to cut food to this size, or that
care staff or family will be available to pre-cut the food.
Individuals with cognitive impairment are at increased
risk of choking with poor ability to self-monitor food size
and rate of ingestion [51, 61]. Some elderly people
without a formal dysphagia diagnosis, but with fewer than
20 teeth, or with dentures may benefit from soft food for
ease of mastication. These individuals do not strictly
require the stringent particle size requirement described in
Level 6—Soft & Bite-Sized, but perhaps they also do not
strictly require a dysphagia diet. In these cases, it is
suggested that facilities consider specifying soft options
from a regular diet. This option should not be considered
as part of the dysphagia diet. The testing methods out-
lined in the IDDSI Framework are generalizable to testing
the softness of food texture in such circumstances. It
should be noted that the loss of occlusal units affects bite
force. Individuals with greater than 20 teeth (10 paired
occlusal units) are reported to have normal bite force
values of *555 N. An exponential decline in bite force is
observed with a reduction in the number of teeth, for
example, 383 N for 10–19 teeth remaining; 180 N for 1–9
teeth remaining and 155 N for edentulous individuals
[62]. Regardless of a formal dysphagia diagnosis, reduced
bite force and poor masticatory efficiency increases
choking risk [63].
Accessible, Objective Testing Methods for Texture-
Modified Liquids and Foods
To date, the measurement of fluid thickness in most
national terminologies has been based on subjective
methods such as flow through the prongs of a fork which
has inherent variability [64]. Objective quantification was
highly desirable but was challenging. The only national
standard to recommend categorization of liquids according
to quantified viscosity ranges is the National Dysphagia
Diet (NDD), developed in the USA in 2002 [15]. However,
the IDDSI committee considered that there were major
practical and scientific limitations to viscosity measure-
ment as follows:
•
The lack of access to testing equipment and the
expertise required to perform and interpret rheological
testing.
•
Viscosity is only one of a number of relevant param-
eters affecting liquid flow; others include density, yield
stress, sample temperature, elasticity, and propulsion
pressure [65–69].
•
Drinks thickened with different thickening agents—or
naturally thick—may have the same measurement of
apparent viscosity at the specified test shear rate (e.g.,
310
J. A. Y. Cichero et al.: Development of International Terminology and Definitions…
123
 NDD: 50 s-1) and yet may have very different flow
characteristics in practice [27, 28, 70–73].
•
The non-Newtonian nature of thickened drinks makes
them impossible to characterize fully with only one
viscosity measurement [70, 74, 75].
•
In addition to variations in flow associated with drink
characteristics,
flow
rates
during
swallowing
are
expected to differ depending on a person’s age and
level of impairment of swallowing function [59].
For these reasons, a measurement of viscosity has not
been included in the IDDSI descriptors. Instead, an
objective and practical measurement has been selected by
IDDSI to classify liquids based on their rate of flow under
the action of gravity down a narrow tube with an orifice at
the bottom. Such tests have a history in the dairy industry
for studying oral perceptions of milk, cream, and yogurt
(e.g., [76, 77]). The controlled dimensions selected are
broadly representative of drinking through a straw or
beaker and the regime of top-down flow through a narrow
tube with exit through a small orifice has physiological
parallels with bolus flow through the pharynx, with exit via
the upper esophageal sphincter. This type of extensional
flow (as opposed to shear) has been hypothesized to be
more relevant to perception and to dysphagia [78–80].
Rather than specify a proprietary instrument, we have
specified a common 10-ml syringe due to its increased
availability and affordability globally. The syringe may be
disposed after each use or washed and re-used; the 10 ml
sample fluid would be discarded. The nature of the test
means it is possible to measure drinks at the point of ser-
vice. Although we would not expect this to be performed
routinely, it does provide a standardized objective measure
for training, auditing, and research. The ability to measure
liquid thickness also provides opportunity to accurately
audit thickness of sauces, condiments, soups, nutritional
supplements, and liquid medications at the time of prepa-
ration and at the point of serving.
It is desirable to develop similar practical tools for
quantifying food textures, however, food texture assessment
provides more variables for assessment than drinks as both
texture and size requirements are needed. Additionally, a
degree of added pressure is required in order to deform the
materials (which will not flow under gravity), and that is
difficult to control in an inexpensive and globally stan-
dardized manner. The IDDSI Fork pressure test provides
guidelines with greater quantification than would be
achievable by text alone. The dimensions of common forks
have been found to be fairly consistent internationally,
which provides some ability to specify particle size, and a
version of the test has been produced for chopsticks. How-
ever, it is acknowledged that further work in the area of food
texture assessment for texture-modified foods is warranted.
Limitations of the Current Study
The IDDSI process utilized online stakeholder surveys to
gather empirical evidence. It is acknowledged that despite
the range of stakeholder groups engaged that the sample
size of the stakeholder groups was uneven. The largest
group of respondents in both surveys was healthcare pro-
fessionals. People with dysphagia and their caregivers
made up the smallest stakeholder group. Often communi-
cation impairment accompanies dysphagia, and it is pos-
sible that communication impairment may have limited
respondents’ ability to participate in the surveys. The sur-
veys were heavily influenced by responses from English-
speaking countries, with the top 10 countries of origin
responses coming in order from Canada, USA, England,
Australia, Scotland, Brazil, Ireland, New Zealand, Singa-
pore, and Japan. The stakeholder groups consisted of
motivated responders. It is noted that in the development of
the Australian standardized terminology for texture-modi-
fied foods and fluids that differences were seen in the
responses from motivated vs. targeted respondents [7]. Due
to the scale of the IDDSI initiative, it was not possible to
solicit responses from individuals or organizations that had
not already volunteered to take part in the surveys. It could
be argued that those motivated to respond will be more
active in change management.
Future Directions
The IDDSI framework has been well received by the
international community. The IDDSI Board is in the pro-
cess of developing materials and resources to assist inter-
ested parties to transition to the IDDSI framework (www.
iddsi.org). The IDDSI web site aims to provide a large and
up-to-date resource for the international community to
share and discuss ideas and experiences relating to texture
modification and adoption of the IDDSI framework. We
hope this will include practical tips and guidance for local
regions. The web site is a channel for stakeholders to feed
back evidence of the success or limitations of the IDDSI
framework across settings internationally.
The IDDSI framework is considered a living document
such that it will be formally reviewed at specified intervals
with new editions noted by updated version numbers and
year of review. As research is conducted and technology
continues to expand, it is anticipated that further refine-
ments to the framework and detailed definitions will occur.
The framework and detailed definitions will be formally
reviewed in 2020 to ensure that the evidence base sup-
porting the IDDSI framework remains current.
