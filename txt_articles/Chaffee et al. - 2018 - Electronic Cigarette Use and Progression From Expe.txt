BACKGROUND: It has been shown that never-smoking adolescents who try electronic cigarettes 
(e-cigarettes) are at increased risk of subsequent conventional cigarette smoking. We 
evaluated associations between e-cigarette use and progression to established smoking 
among adolescents who had already tried cigarettes.
METHODS: Among participants (age 12–17 years) in the nationally representative Population 
Assessment of Tobacco and Health survey who had smoked a cigarette (≥1 puff) but not 
yet smoked 100 cigarettes (N = 1295), we examined 3 outcomes at 1-year follow-up as 
a function of baseline e-cigarette use: (1) having smoked ≥100 cigarettes (established 
smoking), (2) smoking during the past 30 days, and (3) both having smoked ≥100 cigarettes 
and past 30-day smoking (current established smoking). Survey-weighted multivariable 
logistic regression models were fitted to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) adjusted for smoking risk factors.
RESULTS: Versus e-cigarette never use, having ever used e-cigarettes was positively 
associated with progression to established cigarette smoking (19.3% vs 9.7%), past 30-day 
smoking (38.8% vs 26.6%), and current established smoking (15.6% vs 7.1%). In adjusted 
models, e-cigarette ever use positively predicted current established smoking (OR: 1.80; 
95% CI: 1.04–3.12) but did not reach statistical significance (α = .05) for established 
smoking (OR: 1.57; 95% CI: 0.99–2.49) and past 30-day smoking (OR: 1.32; 95% CI: 
0.99–1.76).
CONCLUSIONS: Among adolescent cigarette experimenters, using e-cigarettes was positively 
and independently associated with progression to current established smoking, suggesting 
that e-cigarettes do not divert from, and may encourage, cigarette smoking in this 
population.

What’s KnOWn On thIs subject: In previous studies 
of youth who have never smoked cigarettes, those who 
tried electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) were more likely 
to initiate conventional cigarette smoking compared 
with e-cigarette never users. In cross-sectional studies, 
e-cigarette use is associated with established youth 
smoking.
What thIs stuDy aDDs: Among youth who already 
experimented with cigarettes but were not yet established 
smokers, having used e-cigarettes was prospectively 
associated with onset of current established cigarette 
smoking. For these youth, e-cigarettes appear to 
encourage progression to established smoking.

 Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) 
are increasingly popular among 
youth; from 2014 to 2016, more US 
middle and high school students used 
e-cigarettes than any other tobacco 
product, including conventional 
cigarettes.1 All currently available 
longitudinal studies have revealed 
that among never-smoking 
adolescents and young adults, 
e-cigarette use is associated with 
subsequent cigarette smoking.2 
– 
6 
This association was shown in 
studies taking place in California, 
3 
Hawaii, 
2 and the Mid-Atlantic  
region, 
7 as well as in nationally 
representative US samples, 
6, 
 
8 Canada, 
4  
and the United Kingdom.5 Seven of 
these studies were summarized in a 
recent meta-analysis, revealing more 
than a threefold increase in the risk 
of cigarette smoking initiation when 
comparing youth e-cigarette ever 
users to never users.9 Although this 
association between e-cigarettes 
and smoking initiation has been 
consistent across the literature 
and could be explained by using a 
proposed “catalyst” model, 
10 some 
have argued that the relationship 
partly reflects a shared propensity 
for experimentation with different 
nicotine-containing products.11
Many individuals at low risk of 
smoking initiation may be included 
in studies of baseline cigarette 
never-users. In contrast, youth 
who have already begun cigarette 
experimentation represent a 
population at high risk of progression 
to greater levels of cigarette use 
later in adolescence and into 
adulthood. Although smoking even 1 
cigarette is concerning, becoming an 
established smoker in adolescence 
is of substantial clinical and public 
health concern and is strongly 
associated with continuing to smoke 
regularly.12 Therefore, in the present 
investigation we consider high-risk 
youth, as evident by having already 
tried smoking (ever smoked ≥1 puff) 
but not yet smoked 100 cigarettes, 
and evaluate whether e-cigarette 
use in this population predicts 
progression from experimentation to 
established cigarette smoking 1 year 
later.
In a previous cross-sectional analysis 
of the 2011 and 2012 National Youth 
Tobacco Surveys (NYTSs), among 
youth who had ever smoked a 
cigarette, ever use of e-cigarettes was 
associated with being an established 
smoker (lifetime smoked ≥100 
cigarettes), including after adjusting 
for socio-demographic variables.13 
However, the cross-sectional design 
of that analysis precluded causal 
conclusions because of uncertain 
temporal sequencing between 
e-cigarette use and established 
smoking.
In the current study, we used 
the nationally representative 
Population Assessment of Tobacco 
and Health (PATH) Study14 Waves 
1 (2013–2014) and 2 (2014–2015) 
to examine these same relationships 
prospectively. We hypothesized that 
among PATH youth participants 
who had already tried cigarette 
smoking but not yet smoked a total 
of 100 cigarettes, use of e-cigarettes 
would be positively associated with 
becoming an established cigarette 
smoker within 1 year.
MethODs
Researchers from the PATH Study 
selected participants using a 4-stage 
stratified probability design with 
oversampling for tobacco users, 
African Americans, and young adults 
(ages 18–24 years). The PATH youth 
sample consisted of adolescents (up 
to 2 per household) whose parents 
were selected for the PATH adult 
sample.14 Researchers from the 
PATH Youth Study enrolled 13 651 
US adolescents ages 12 to 17 years at 
baseline (2013–2014), with 87.9% 
retention (unweighted) at Wave 2 
(2014–2015).
In-home in-person computer-
assisted interviews were conducted 
in administering the PATH 
questionnaire. In separate sections, 
participants were asked about their 
tobacco use (eg, ever use, number 
of lifetime uses, and number of days 
used in the past 30 days) for 8 types 
of tobacco and nicotine-containing 
products, including cigarettes and 
e-cigarettes. Tobacco use questions 
were repeated during the Wave 2 
interview, including for individuals 
who reached age 18 before follow-up 
and were therefore administered the 
Wave 2 adult questionnaire.
In the present analysis, we included 
youth who had smoked ≥1 cigarette 
puff but had not yet smoked 100 
cigarettes at baseline (smoking 
experimenters), with known smoking 
status at follow-up (N = 1295). We 
examined 3 outcomes at follow-up as 
a function of baseline e-cigarette use: 
(1) having smoked ≥100 cigarettes 
(established smoking), (2) smoking 
during the past 30 days, and (3) 
both having smoked ≥100 cigarettes 
and past 30-day smoking (current 
established smoking). We categorized 
e-cigarette use in 2 ways: (1) ever 
use or never use, and (2) never use, 
nonpast 30-day use (former use), or 
past 30-day use.
Logistic regression models (Stata 
14; StataCorp, College Station, TX) 
were used to adjust for hypothesized 
confounding variables in 3 stages. 
First, 6 separate unadjusted models 
were fitted to cover each combination 
of independent variable (Wave 1 
e-cigarette never or ever use and 
e-cigarette never or former or past 
30-day use) and dependent variable 
(Wave 2 established smoking, 
current smoking, and current 
established smoking). In the second 
stage, we added sex, age (in years), 
and race and/or ethnicity (Hispanic 
and/or Latino, non-Hispanic white, 
non-Hispanic African American, 
other) as covariables in all models, 
matching the confounders used in 
a previous cross-sectional analysis 
of NYTS data.13 In the third stage,

 bachelor degree or greater), urban 
residence (based on sampling units), 
household tobacco use (lives with 
≥1 tobacco user), alcohol ever use, 
tobacco advertisement receptivity15 
(can recall brand of favorite 
advertisement), sensation-seeking 
score (scale from 3 to 15), cigarette 
warning label exposure (Likert-
type scale), interview time of year 
(summer versus all other months), 
and ever use of any other tobacco 
product (ie, cigars, pipes, hookah, 
bidis, kreteks, snus, dissolvable 
tobacco, and conventional moist 
snuff or chewing smokeless tobacco) 
were also included in additional 
adjusted models. A sensation-
seeking score was a composite of 3 
Likert-type items (liking frightening 
things, willingness to break rules, 
and preference for exciting and 
unpredictable friends) and has 
been shown to correlate with youth 
tobacco use.16 Interview time of year 
was included because, for youth, 
the scholastic calendar may play a 
role both in opportunity and social 
pressure to experiment with tobacco 
products.
All models were weighted for 
sampling design and nonresponse by 
using balanced repeated replication 
to be representative of the Wave 
1 target population.17 Multiple 
imputation was performed for 
missing observations (0.7% of data), 
with variance estimates adjusted 
accordingly.
An institutional review board at 
the University of California, San 
Francisco reviewed and designated 
the study protocol exempt for this 
analysis of deidentified survey 
data. The PATH Study protocol 
received a National Institutes of 
Health Certificate of Confidentiality 
and approval from the Westat 
Institutional Review Board. Parental 
consent was requested on behalf 
of participating youth. Youth who 
completed the questionnaire were 
given $25.
Results
Among baseline cigarette 
experimenters (mean age: 15.5 
years; 48.3% girls), having ever used 
e-cigarettes was positively associated 
with progression to established 
cigarette smoking in Wave 2 (Table 1). 
 
Compared with e-cigarette never 
users, e-cigarette ever users were 
twice as likely to report Wave 2 
established smoking (19.3% vs 9.7%; 
P < .001) and current established 
smoking (15.6% vs 7.1%; P < .001) 
and were more likely to report past 
30-day smoking (38.8% vs 26.6%;  
P < .001).
In models adjusted for sex, age, and 
race and/or ethnicity (Table 1), 
Wave 1 e-cigarette ever use (versus 
never use) was associated with 
approximately twice the odds of 
progression to Wave 2 established 
cigarette smoking (odds ratio [OR]: 
2.23; 95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 1.55–3.21; P < .001), past 
30-day smoking (OR: 1.75; 95% CI: 
1.35–2.27; P < .001), and current

Downloaded from 
 established smoking (OR: 2.43; 95% 
CI: 1.55–3.80; P < .001). Associations 
were attenuated in fully adjusted 
models (Table 1), but e-cigarette 
ever use remained a positive and 
statistically significant predictor of 
current established smoking (OR: 
1.80; 95% CI: 1.04–3.12; P = .035). 
Associations did not reach the 
threshold for statistical significance 
for established smoking (OR: 1.57; 
95% CI: 0.99–2.49; P = .055) and past 
30-day smoking (OR: 1.32; 95% CI: 
0.99–1.76; P = .059).
When baseline e-cigarette former 
use (tried but not used in past 30 
days) and past 30-day use were 
considered separately, there was a 
stepwise increase in the probability 
of progression to future established 
smoking from never to former to past 
30-day e-cigarette use (Table 1).  
For example, the probability of Wave 
2 past 30-day cigarette smoking 
rose from baseline e-cigarette never 
use (26.6%) to former use (36.1%) 
to past 30-day use (45.3%). Both 
e-cigarette former use and past 
30-day use remained statistically 
significantly associated with all 
3 Wave 2 cigarette outcomes in 
models adjusted for sex, age, and race 
and/or ethnicity (Table 1). In fully 
adjusted models, baseline e-cigarette 
former use remained a statistically 
significant predictor of progression 
to current established smoking 
(OR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.02–3.36; P = 
.042), and baseline e-cigarette past 
30-day use statistically significantly 
predicted progression to past 
30-day smoking (OR: 1.64; 95% CI: 
1.12–2.41; P = .010). Adjustment 
variables that were consistently 
associated with greater progression 
to established smoking included 
household tobacco use and 
tobacco advertisement receptivity 
(Supplemental Table 2).
DIscussIOn
In this study, among youth who 
had experimented with cigarettes 
but had not progressed to 
established smoking, additional 
use of e-cigarettes was positively 
associated with future onset of 
current established smoking. 
Across 3 different definitions of 
established smoking and 2 different 
specifications of e-cigarette use, 
baseline e-cigarette users were 
at 1.5 to 2 times greater odds of 
progression to established smoking 
than e-cigarette never users, 
after adjustment for confounding 
variables. Fully adjusted associations 
with e-cigarette ever use were 
statistically significant for 1 
definition of established smoking 
(current established smoking; P = 
.035) but fell just short of the a priori 
threshold for statistical significance 
for established smoking (P = .055) 
and past 30-day smoking (P = .059). 
The ORs in the present longitudinal 
analysis were in the same direction 
but smaller in magnitude than in the 
previous cross-sectional analysis 
of NYTS data13 in which new trials 
of e-cigarettes among previously 
established smokers could have been 
captured.
Regardless of how Wave 1 e-cigarette 
and Wave 2 smoking variables were 
specified, positive associations 
persisted after statistical adjustment 
for sex, age, and race and/or 
ethnicity. Adding the full set of 
confounding variables to models, 
such as household tobacco use, 
warning label exposure, and baseline 
use of other tobacco products, 
reduced the strength of some of the 
observed associations to below the 
threshold for statistical significance. 
However, all associations remained 
positive in direction and similar 
in magnitude across different 
definitions of e-cigarette exposure 
and the smoking outcome.
Suggested in these results is that 
e-cigarette use is more likely to 
encourage youth smoking than to 
divert youth from smoking when 
considering individuals who have 
already experimented with cigarette 
use. Unlike adults, particularly 
cigarette smokers, who commonly 
report a desire to quit smoking as a 
main motivator for e-cigarette use, 
18 
youth are more likely to cite curiosity 
as a reason to try e-cigarettes.19 
E-cigarette use was not associated 
with cigarette quit attempts or with 
quit contemplation among US middle 
and high school students in any NYTS 
wave from 2011 to 2015.20
In existing studies of youth who had 
never smoked a cigarette at baseline, 
those who tried e-cigarettes were 
more likely to initiate cigarette 
smoking in the future.2 
–6, 
 
9 In addition 
to smoking initiation among youth 
never-smokers, we demonstrate in 
the current study that e-cigarette use 
was also associated with progression 
to current established smoking 
among youth smoking experimenters.
In a study of California 10th grade 
students that included never smokers 
and current smokers at baseline, 
greater frequency of e-cigarette 
use at baseline was associated 
with subsequently greater levels of 
smoking frequency (days smoked 
in past month) and heaviness 
(cigarettes smoked per day) 6 
months later.21 Similarly, in a school-
based study of adolescent never 
and current smokers in Canada, 
baseline past 30-day e-cigarette 
use was associated with initiation 
of daily smoking 1 year later.4 In 
the results of a school-based study 
of baseline cigarette ever smokers 
in Hawaii, a statistically significant 
change at follow-up in smoking 
frequency (measured as numerical 
categories) between baseline 
e-cigarette ever and never users 
was not yielded.2 However, in a 
school-based study of adolescents 
in the United Kingdom, ever use 
(versus never use) of e-cigarettes 
was associated with “escalation” to 
smoking sometimes or usually among 
baseline nonsmokers who had used 
cigarettes in the past.5 Authors of 
that study reported an adjusted OR 
that was similar to the current study

Downloaded from 
 (OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 0.82–4.33) but not 
statistically significant (P = .13) in a 
smaller sample (n = 318).5
The smoking outcomes evaluated 
in the current study represent 
intensity levels of clear clinical and 
public health concern. Although 
smoking as infrequently as 1 day 
in the past month in adolescence is 
predictive of adult smoking, 
22 youth 
who reach higher levels of smoking 
are even more likely to continue 
to smoke.12 Additionally, although 
more recent (past 30-day) e-cigarette 
use was a stronger predictor of 
future established smoking than 
former e-cigarette use in unadjusted 
models, this pattern did not 
necessarily persist in fully adjusted 
models. We suggest that any level 
of e-cigarette use among adolescent 
cigarette experimenters may be a 
meaningful risk indicator of smoking 
progression.
Several study advantages 
strengthened the conclusions that 
can be drawn from this research. The 
large, prospective, and nationally 
representative nature of the PATH 
Study enhanced generalizability and 
certainty regarding the temporal 
sequence between exposure and 
outcome. The PATH questionnaire 
was rigorously pilot tested and 
administered under a consistent 
protocol.14 Furthermore, the 
magnitude of associations found in 
this study was largely consistent 
across different specifications of 
e-cigarette and cigarette use. Among 
other study aspects to consider, 
in-home administration of the PATH 
questionnaire could have led to 
differences in estimated tobacco 
use compared with school-based 
surveys. However, results of this 
analysis were qualitatively similar to 
previous work in which NYTS data 
was used.13 As with all observational 
studies, residual confounding from 
unmeasured variables cannot be 
ruled out, although associations 
remained positive and at the 
threshold for statistical significance 
after adjustment for an extensive set 
of variables known to predict youth 
cigarette smoking.23
In July 2017, the US Food and Drug 
Administration announced a plan for 
tobacco and nicotine regulation that 
delayed federal e-cigarette regulation 
from 2018 until 2022.24 However, 
local governments have taken 
regulatory action of e-cigarettes. 
For example, a 2017 San Francisco, 
California, ordinance prohibits the 
sale of flavored tobacco products, 
including e-cigarettes, with the 
intention of reducing the appeal of 
tobacco products to youth.25 It is 
indicated in our results that among 
youth cigarette experimenters, those 
who have also used e-cigarettes are 
more likely to progress to current 
established smoking than those 
who tried cigarettes alone. As long 
as e-cigarettes remain attractive to 
youth, concern persists that these 
products contribute to greater 
combustible cigarette smoking 
among adolescents.
cOnclusIOns
Among youth cigarette 
experimenters, using e-cigarettes 
was positively and independently 
associated with future onset of 
current established smoking, 
suggesting that e-cigarettes do not 
divert from, and may encourage, 
cigarette smoking in this population. 
In weighing the overall public health 
impact of e-cigarette availability, 
regulation, and use, the potential 
to increase combustible cigarette 
smoking by youth deserves special 
consideration.
