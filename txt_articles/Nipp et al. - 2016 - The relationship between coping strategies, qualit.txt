BACKGROUND: Patients with incurable cancer face many physical and emotional stressors, yet little is known about their coping
strategies or the relationship between their coping strategies, quality of life (QOL), and mood. METHODS: As part of a randomized
trial of palliative care, this study assessed baseline QOL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–General), mood (Hospital Anxiety
and Depression Scale), and coping (Brief COPE) in patients within 8 weeks of a diagnosis of incurable lung or gastrointestinal cancer
and before randomization. To examine associations between coping strategies, QOL, and mood, we used linear regression, adjusting
for patients’ age, sex, marital status, and cancer type. RESULTS: There were 350 participants (mean age, 64.9 years), and the majority
were male (54.0%), were married (70.0%), and had lung cancer (54.6%). Most reported high utilization of emotional support coping
(77.0%), whereas fewer reported high utilization of acceptance (44.8%), self-blame (37.9%), and denial (28.2%). Emotional support
(QOL: b 5 2.65, P < .01; depression: b 5 –0.56, P 5 .02) and acceptance (QOL: b 5 1.55, P < .01; depression: b 5 –0.37, P 5 .01; anxiety:
b 5 –0.34, P 5 .02) correlated with better QOL and mood. Denial (QOL: b 5 –1.97, P < .01; depression: b 5 0.36, P 5 .01; anxiety: b 5
0.61, P < .01) and self-blame (QOL: b 5 –2.31, P < .01; depression: b 5 0.58, P < .01; anxiety: b 5 0.66, P < .01) correlated with worse
QOL and mood. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with newly diagnosed, incurable cancer use a variety of coping strategies. The use of emo-
tional support and acceptance coping strategies correlated with better QOL and mood, whereas the use of denial and self-blame
negatively correlated with these outcomes. Interventions to improve patients’ QOL and mood should seek to cultivate the use of
adaptive coping strategies. Cancer 2016;122:2110-6. V

INTRODUCTION
Patients with incurable cancer often endure numerous physical and emotional challenges as they cope with a life-limiting
illness. Not only do these patients have to deal with the notion that they have a terminal diagnosis, they also often experi-
ence a high symptom burden and encounter a variety of difficult medical decisions.1-3 Specifically, patients must decide
whether the benefits of treatment outweigh the significant toxicities and unwanted side effects of cancer therapy.4,5 How
patients cope with their illness can influence their ability to make decisions regarding both their cancer care and their care
at the end of life.6-9 In addition, patients’ use of certain coping strategies can affect their desire for information about their
disease, their self-efficacy, and the ways in which they adjust to the disease and its treatment.10-13 However, little is known
about how patients cope with a diagnosis of incurable cancer.
Although patients with incurable cancer confront numerous stressors, the relationship between their coping strat-
egies, quality of life (QOL), and psychological distress has not been fully evaluated. The existing literature for the general
cancer population suggests that certain strategies are more commonly utilized and adaptive than others,7,9,14-17 but studies
have not yet evaluated coping and its relationship with other outcomes for patients with a new diagnosis of incurable can-
cer. Adaptive coping strategies generally refer to more positive or constructive coping responses that may benefit patients
in certain situations, whereas maladaptive coping strategies refer to those that are more negative or dysfunctional.18
Importantly, patients with incurable cancer may cope differently than those with curable disease because they often experi-
ence a greater symptom burden and emotional distress related to their life-threatening illness.1,19-21 In addition, under-
standing the strategies used most frequently by this population and the associations between their coping strategies and

 well-being is particularly important because patients with
newly diagnosed, incurable cancer are often asked to make
rapid and difficult decisions about their cancer treatment.
The use of certain coping strategies may affect patients’
perceptions of their illness and influence their decisions
regarding treatment, which can have a lasting impact on
their treatment course and ultimately their end-of-life
outcomes.8,13,22,23 Thus, an understanding of the rela-
tionship between patients’ coping strategies and their
QOL and mood will allow us to better support patients as
they navigate their new diagnosis of incurable cancer.
In the current analysis of baseline data from a
randomized trial of early palliative care, we sought to
investigate how patients with incurable cancer cope with
their illness. We also examined the associations between
patients’ coping strategies and their QOL and mood. By
studying the relationship between incurable cancer
patients’ coping strategies, QOL, and mood, we aim to
highlight both adaptive and maladaptive strategies that
can be addressed in future interventions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
As part of a randomized trial of early palliative care, we en-
rolled patients within 8 weeks of their diagnosis of incura-
ble cancer. All medical oncologists agreed to recruit and
obtain consent from their patients. After they had provided
written informed consent, we asked participants to com-
plete baseline measures before their randomization assign-
ment and the notification of their study arm allocation.
Study staff subsequently obtained clinical data from the
medical record. The Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Care
institutional review board approved the study protocol.
Patient Selection
The sample included ambulatory patients at the Massa-
chusetts General Hospital Cancer Center with confirmed
incurable lung or noncolorectal gastrointestinal cancer
diagnosed within the previous 8 weeks who were not
receiving treatment with curative intent, had an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to
2, were 18 years old or older, and had the ability to read
and respond to questions in English or be able to com-
plete patient-reported measures with minimal assistance
required from an interpreter or family member. We con-
firmed the noncurative intent of therapy by reviewing
clinical documentation in the electronic medical record
and chemotherapy or clinical trial consent forms. Patients
who were already receiving consultation from the pallia-
tive care service were not eligible for study participation.
Study Measures
Sociodemographic and clinical factors
Participants completed a demographic questionnaire that
included race, ethnicity, religion, marital status, smoking
history, income, and education level. We reviewed partici-
pants’ electronic medical records to obtain data on their
age, sex, cancer diagnosis and stage, Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status, and cancer therapy.
QOL
We measured self-reported QOL with Functional Assess-
ment of Cancer Therapy–General (FACT-G).24 FACT-
G contains 28 items with subscales assessing well-being
across 4 domains (physical, functional, emotional, and
social) during the past week. Scores on FACT-G range
from 0 to 112, with higher scores indicating a better
QOL.
Depression and anxiety
We measured patients’ depression and anxiety symptoms
with
the
Hospital
Anxiety
and
Depression
Scale
(HADS).25 HADS is a 14-item questionnaire that con-
tains two 7-item subscales assessing depression and anxi-
ety symptoms during the past week. Scores on each
subscale range from 0 to 21, with higher total and subscale
scores indicating higher levels of distress.
Coping strategies
We used the Brief COPE to assess patients’ use of coping
strategies. Brief COPE is a 28-item questionnaire that
assesses 14 coping methods with 2 items for each
method.26 To minimize the questionnaire burden for par-
ticipants, we limited our assessment to the following 7
coping strategies, which we felt were most appropriate for
our study population: emotional support, positive refram-
ing, active, acceptance, self-blame, denial, and behavioral
disengagement. Scores on each scale range from 2 to 8,
with higher scores indicating greater use of that particular
coping strategy. To determine the strategies used most fre-
quently in our sample, we calculated the median scores on
each item of Brief COPE and then described the propor-
tion of patients with a score greater than the median.8,22,23
We designated patients with scores above the median as
high utilizers of that particular coping strategy.
Statistical Analysis
We used descriptive statistics to analyze the frequencies,
medians, means, and standard deviations of the study var-
iables. We assessed differences in high utilization of each
coping strategy by patient characteristics with Fisher’s
exact test. To examine the associations between patients’

 coping strategies and their QOL and mood, we computed
linear regression models that were adjusted for potential
confounders known to be associated with the predictor of
interest (coping) and the outcomes of interest (QOL and
mood). Specifically, our models were adjusted for
patients’ age, sex, marital status, and cancer type.27,28 We
performed our statistical analyses with SPSS 17.0 (SPSS,
Chicago, Ill).
RESULTS
Participant Sample
From May 2011 to July 2015, we enrolled 350 of 480
eligible patients (72.9%). Sample characteristics are pre-
sented in Table 1. Participants (mean age, 64.9 6 10.9
years) were primarily white (92.3%), and the majority
were male (54.0%), were married (70.0%), and had a
lung cancer diagnosis (54.6%).
Use of Coping Strategies
Emotional support, active, and acceptance coping had the
highest median scores, whereas behavioral disengagement,
self-blame, and denial had the lowest. Figure 1 depicts the
proportion of patients using each coping strategy more
than the median. Most patients reported high utilization
of emotional support coping (77.0%), yet many also
reported high utilization of acceptance (44.8%), self-
blame (37.9%), and denial (28.2%).
We compared the proportions of patients reporting
high utilization of each coping strategy by age (<65 years
vs �65 years), sex, marital status, cancer type, religion,
and smoking history. A greater proportion of younger
patients (58.6% vs 39.9%, P 5 .001), non-Catholics
(55.9% vs 44.4%, P 5 .038), and patients with a smoking

 history less than 10 pack-years (56.2% vs 42.9%, P 5
.017) reported high utilization of positive reframing in
comparison with their counterparts. In addition, a larger
percentage of younger patients (43.9% vs 32.0%, P 5
.027), patients with lung cancer (43.1% vs 31.6%, P 5
.034), and patients with a smoking history � 10 pack-
years (44.6% vs 30.2%, P 5 .008) reported high utiliza-
tion of self-blame. We found no differences in the use of
active, denial, emotional support, behavioral disengage-
ment, and acceptance coping strategies across these demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics.
Associations Between Coping Strategies and
QOL
Using linear regression, we found an association between
participants’ use of emotional support, acceptance, denial,
and self-blame coping strategies and their QOL (Table 2).
Emotional support (b 5 2.649, standard error [SE] 5
0.856, P 5 .002) and acceptance coping strategies (b 5
1.549, SE 5 0.540, P 5 .004) correlated with higher
FACT-G scores. Conversely, denial (b 5 –1.968, SE 5
0.542, P < .001) and self-blame (b 5 –2.305, SE 5
0.617, P < .001) were associated with lower FACT-G
scores.
Associations Between Coping Strategies and
Mood
We found an association between participants’ use of
emotional support, acceptance, denial, and self-blame
coping strategies and their HADS depression scores.
Emotional support (b 5 –0.560, SE 5 0.230, P 5 .016)
and acceptance coping strategies (b 5 –0.374, SE 5
0.145, P 5 .010) correlated with lower depression scores,
whereas denial (b 5 0.363, SE 5 0.146, P 5 .013) and
self-blame (b 5 0.580, SE 5 0.166, P 5 .001) correlated
with higher depression scores. In addition, we found an
association between participants’ use of acceptance,
denial, and self-blame coping strategies and their HADS
anxiety scores. Use of acceptance coping (b 5 –0.336, SE
5 0.140, P 5 0.017) correlated with lower anxiety scores,
whereas denial (b 5 0.606, SE 5 0.141, P < .001) and
self-blame coping strategies (b 5 0.661, SE 5 0.160, P <
.001) correlated with higher anxiety scores.
DISCUSSION
We investigated how patients with newly diagnosed, in-
curable gastrointestinal and lung cancer cope with their
illness and found an association between patients’ coping
strategies and their QOL and mood. In this cohort, emo-
tional support was the most frequently used coping strat-
egy, yet more than one-third of the patients also reported
high utilization of positive reframing, acceptance, active,
and self-blame coping. We demonstrated that emotional
support and acceptance coping strategies were associated
with better QOL and mood. We also found that denial
and self-blame correlated with worse QOL and mood.
Collectively, these findings not only underscore that
patients’ coping strategies influence their physical and
psychological well-being but also indicate that certain
coping behaviors may be more adaptive than others.
Our work highlights the coping strategies most
highly utilized by patients with newly diagnosed, incura-
ble cancer. A more comprehensive understanding of the
most frequently used coping strategies in this population
could be instrumental in 1) providing psychological and
supportive care services that meet patients’ needs, 2)
understanding
how
coping
can
influence
patients’
approach to their medical care and decision making, and
3) identifying frequently utilized adaptive coping behav-
iors that can be further nurtured to improve patients’ out-
comes. In addition, by understanding the coping
strategies used by patients soon after their cancer diagno-
sis, clinicians may be prepared to better support their
patients during future times of stress. Thus, our study suc-

 commonly utilized ways that patients with newly diag-
nosed, incurable cancer cope with their terminal illness,
and this can enable us to better support this population
and ultimately improve the quality of their care.
Interestingly, we identified differential use of spe-
cific coping strategies across patient subpopulations. For
example, younger patients were more likely to highly uti-
lize positive reframing and self-blame coping in compari-
son with older patients. Studies suggest that older adults
more effectively mitigate the highs and lows associated
with a cancer diagnosis, and this may help explain their
lower reliance on these coping strategies.29,30 We also
demonstrated that patients with a more extensive smoking
history and those with a lung cancer diagnosis were more
likely to report high utilization of self-blame, and this
adds to the literature suggesting that these patients experi-
ence more guilt and shame related to their cancer diagno-
sis.31-33 By highlighting the different coping strategies
commonly used across specific subgroups of patients,
these findings may help clinicians anticipate the needs of
their patients and identify those at risk for maladaptive
coping and higher psychological distress.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to report that
coping strategies are associated with QOL and mood in
patients with newly diagnosed, incurable cancer. Impor-
tantly, these findings will inform future efforts to improve
QOL and mood in this vulnerable population. By assessing
patients’ coping at the time of diagnosis, we can identify
those using strategies such as denial and self-blame, who are
at increased risk of distress, and provide greater psychologi-
cal support through the early involvement of social work or
psychology. In addition, we can implement behavioral
interventions that encourage patients to use more adaptive
coping mechanisms and prevent the perpetuation of mal-
adaptive strategies. Previous studies have consistently dem-
onstrated that early integration of palliative care for
patients with newly diagnosed, incurable cancer improves
their QOL and mood,34-37 yet none have investigated the
impact of early palliative care on patients’ coping strategies.
Determining how early palliative care interventions influ-
ence patients’ coping strategies may shed light on one of
the possible mechanisms underlying the positive outcomes
seen for patients receiving these interventions. In future
analyses, we will examine how the integration of palliative
care early in the disease course for patients with incurable
cancer can influence their use of coping strategies over
time. This work may further support the importance of
assessing patients’ use of coping strategies and training
clinicians to tailor their care according to patients’ unique
needs. Thus, these data mark the first step in understanding
the relationship between patients’ coping mechanisms and
other patient-reported outcomes that will help build a
foundation for developing interventions to improve the ex-
perience of patients with newly diagnosed, incurable
disease.
Our findings expand on prior research suggesting
that particular coping strategies may be more adaptive than
others in patients with cancer.7,9,15-18,38,39 Prior studies of
women with breast and gynecologic cancers demonstrated
that acceptance coping was positively associated with
QOL, whereas denial and self-blame negatively correlated
with this outcome.9,40,41 Similarly, studies have shown that
denial and self-blame coping correlated with greater psy-
chological distress in patients with potentially curable
breast and head and neck cancers.42-44 Although our find-
ings are consistent with these results, most of these studies
lacked male representation and evaluated patients with cur-
able disease at varying times in their disease course. Patients
in our study all had newly diagnosed, incurable cancer with
a poor prognosis, which is generally associated with greater
emotional and psychological distress compared with
patients diagnosed with curable cancers.45 Thus, our study
provides valuable new insights about the relationships
between coping strategies, QOL, and psychological distress
in a large sample of patients with newly diagnosed, incura-
ble cancer.
Our work has several limitations that warrant con-
sideration. First, we performed this study at a single aca-
demic cancer center with a relatively homogeneous
patient sample. Therefore, our findings may not be gener-
alizable to other patient populations with more racial and
ethnic diversity or to patients from other geographic areas.
In addition, patients in this study were enrolled in a
randomized trial of early palliative care, and these patients
may differ from those who chose not to participate. Sec-
ond, we did not collect information about patients’ use of
other services, such as psychiatric, social work, or chap-
laincy services, which may affect patients’ coping, QOL,
and mood.23 However, participants were less likely to
have extensively received these services because they com-
pleted baseline study measures early in their disease
course. Third, our findings support an association
between coping strategies and patients’ QOL and mood,
but we cannot state the directionality of this relationship
or whether one predicts the other. Finally, this study does
not provide information about unmeasured coping strat-
egies (eg, religious coping or substance use) or about the
ways in which patients’ coping strategies change through-
out their illness trajectory. Future efforts to better under-
stand the longitudinal impact of coping strategies on

 patients’ QOL and mood are underway and will help fur-
ther decipher the mechanisms underlying the relation-
ships between patients’ use of coping strategies and other
outcomes, including QOL and mood.
In summary, we have demonstrated that patients use
a variety of coping strategies early after their diagnosis of
incurable cancer. Notably, most reported high utilization
of emotional support coping, but a concerning proportion
also reported high utilization of denial and self-blame
coping. In addition, we found that emotional support and
acceptance coping were associated with better QOL and
mood, whereas denial and self-blame correlated with
worse QOL and mood in patients newly diagnosed with
incurable cancer. These findings highlight an important
need to better understand how patients with incurable
cancer cope with their illness and to determine whether
interventions can enhance more adaptive coping behav-
iors. Future research should focus on developing interven-
tions to facilitate the use of certain coping strategies while
also determining the impact of these interventions on
patients’ QOL, mood, and end-of-life care.
