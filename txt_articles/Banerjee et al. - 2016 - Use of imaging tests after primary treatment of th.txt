ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To determine whether the use of imaging tests after 
primary treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer is 
associated with more treatment for recurrence and 
fewer deaths from the disease.
Design
Population based retrospective cohort study.
setting
Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare 
database in the United States.
PartiCiPants
28 220 patients diagnosed with differentiated thyroid 
cancer between 1998 and 2011. The study cohort was 
followed up to 2013, with a median follow-up of 69 
months.
Main OutCOMe Measures
Treatment for recurrence of differentiated thyroid 
cancer (additional neck surgery, additional radioactive 
iodine treatment, or radiotherapy), and deaths due to 
differentiated thyroid cancer. We conducted propensity 
score analyses to assess the relation between imaging 
(neck ultrasound, radioiodine scanning, or positron 
emission tomography (PET) scanning) and treatment 
for recurrence (logistic model) and death (Cox 
proportional hazards model).
results
From 1998 until 2011, we saw an increase in incident 
cancer (rate ratio 1.05, 95% confidence interval 
1.05 to 1.06), imaging (1.13, 1.12 to 1.13), and treatment 
for recurrence (1.01, 1.01 to 1.02); the change in death 
rate was not significant. In multivariable analysis, use of 
neck ultrasounds increased the likelihood of additional 
surgery (odds ratio 2.30, 95% confidence interval 2.05 
to 2.58) and additional radioactive iodine treatment 
(1.45, 1.26 to 1.69). Radioiodine scans were associated 
with additional surgery (odds ratio 3.39, 95% 
confidence interval 3.06 to 3.76), additional radioactive 
iodine treatment (17.83, 14.49 to 22.16), and 
radiotherapy (1.89, 1.71 to 2.10). Use of PET scans was 
associated with additional surgery (odds ratio 2.31, 95% 
confidence interval 2.09 to 2.55), additional radioactive 
iodine treatment (2.13, 1.89 to 2.40), and radiotherapy 
(4.98, 4.52 to 5.49). Use of neck ultrasounds or PET 
scans did not significantly affect disease specific 
survival (hazard ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.98 
to 1.27, and 0.91, 0.77 to 1.07, respectively). However, 
radioiodine scans were associated with an improved 
disease specific survival (hazard ratio 0.70, 95% 
confidence interval 0.60 to 0.82).
COnClusiOns
The marked rise in use of imaging tests after primary 
treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer has been 
associated with an increased treatment for recurrence. 
However, with the exception of radioiodine scans in 
presumed iodine avid disease, this association has 
shown no clear improvement in disease specific 
survival. These findings emphasize the importance of 
curbing unnecessary imaging and tailoring imaging 
after primary treatment to patient risk.
Introduction
Differentiated thyroid cancer has been increasing in 
incidence for several decades and is expected to be the 
fourth leading cancer diagnosis by the year 2030.1 2 
 
Most of this rise in incidence is explained by diagnoses 
of small, low risk cancers.3 
4  These low risk cancers are 
associated with an excellent long term survival; disease 
specific survival at 10 years for patients diagnosed with 
low risk thyroid cancer is between 96% to 100%.5  Yet, 
despite this increase in low risk cancers, our previous 
work found that the use of imaging tests after primary 
treatment of thyroid cancer is rising.6  The reason for 
this rise in imaging is unknown, but because risk of 
death from thyroid cancer is low, increased use of imag-
ing could be due to growing concern for the risk of 
recurrence, which ranges from 1% to 68%.7 
8  When thy-
roid cancer recurrence occurs, treatment options 
include repeat neck surgery, radioactive iodine for 
iodine avid recurrence, and radiation for unresectable 
disease. However, these treatments are not without

Over the past two decades, the incidence of thyroid cancer has risen; most of this 
rise is secondary to an increase in low risk disease (that is, disease that will not 
result in death)
During this same period, the use of imaging after primary thyroid cancer treatment 
has also increased
The relation between imaging after primary treatment and thyroid cancer outcomes 
has not been assessed
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
In a cohort of 28 220 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer diagnosed between 
1998 and 2011 and included in the SEER-Medicare database, there was a 
substantial rise in incident cancer, imaging after primary treatment, and treatment 
for recurrence. There was no significant change in death rate
Use of neck ultrasounds, radioiodine scans, and positron emission tomography 
scans were associated with treatment for recurrence, but only the use of 
radioiodine scans was associated with improved disease specific survival
In light of the growing incidence of low risk thyroid cancer and the paradoxical rise 
in imaging after primary treatment, this study provides the foundation needed to 
reassess thyroid cancer surveillance patterns and to curb unnecessary imaging

risks,9-16 and the relation between imaging, treatment 
for recurrence, and survival remains unknown.
Owing to the lack of evidence linking imaging after 
primary treatment of thyroid cancer to improvement in 
outcome, the standard surveillance strategy for patients 
with differentiated thyroid cancer continues to 
evolve.17-19  However, despite no evidence for survival 
benefit, there are costs, potential radiation exposure, 
and potential downstream treatment risks associated 
with imaging after primary treatment.9-11 
15 
16 Therefore, 
the rising use of imaging after primary treatment neces-
sitates further inquiry into the effects on patient out-
comes, including treatment for recurrence and disease 
specific survival.
We hypothesize that undergoing imaging after pri-
mary treatment of thyroid cancer will be associated 
with more treatment for recurrence and improved sur-
vival. We examine trends over time for diagnosis of 
 
differentiated thyroid cancer, use of imaging after pri-
mary treatment, treatment for recurrence, and death in 
patients with the disease. We then determine whether 
undergoing an imaging test is associated with an 
increased likelihood of treatment for recurrence or 
improved disease specific survival.
Methods
Data source and study population
The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 
(SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute 
 
provides population based data on cancer in the USA. 
SEER cancer registries include about 30% of the US 
population.20  From 1991, data from SEER were linked 
with Medicare reimbursement claims to create a dataset 
that included information on services provided before 
and after cancer diagnosis. For this study, all patients 
from the SEER-Medicare linked database who were 
diagnosed with differentiated thyroid cancer (defined 
as papillary, follicular, or Hϋrthle cell tumor histology) 
between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2011 were 
identified and included in the study cohort.21 In total, 
28 220 patients were included. The study used linked 
longitudinal data that follows treatment episode over 
time. The study cohort was followed up to 2013, with a 
median follow-up of 69 months. 
Measures
SEER collects data on patient demographics, tumor 
site, stage, and treatment. For patients with well differ-
entiated thyroid cancer, the analysis included informa-
tion on age, SEER defined race or ethnicity (included to 
correct for racial disparities), median household 
income by geographical region, percentage of popula-
tion over age 25 years of the geographical region with only 
a high school diploma, tumor size (<1.0 cm, 1.0-1.9 cm, 
2.0-3.9 cm, and >4 cm), tumor histology, and SEER stage 
at diagnosis. The type of initial surgery (characterized 
as no surgery, lobectomy, or total thyroidectomy) and 
presence or absence of initial lymph node resection 
were included.
SEER-Medicare data were used to obtain information 
on imaging after primary treatment. We used Current 
Procedure Terminology (CPT) codes to identify the type 
of imaging used. Neck ultrasounds were identified by 
CPT code 76536. Radioiodine scans were identified by 
CPT codes 78015, 78016, 78017
, 78018, 78020, 78800, 
78801, 78802, and 78804. We excluded the first billing 
of radioiodine scans done, because we thought that 
they were likely to be part of initial staging and not used 
for surveillance. Positron emission tomography (PET) 
scans were identified by CPT codes 78810, 78811, 78812, 
78813, 78814, 78815, and 78816.
We also used SEER-Medicare CPT codes to identify 
treatments for recurrence. Codes used to identify repeat 
neck surgeries were 38510, 38520, 38720, 38724, and 
60260. Codes used to identify radioactive iodine treat-
ment were 79005, 79030, and 75035. We omitted the first 
billing for radioactive iodine treatment that was per-
formed to avoid including ablation that was done as 
part of primary treatment for differentiated thyroid 
 
cancer. The CPT codes used to identify radiotherapy 
were 77261, 77262, and 77263. 
The mortality data reported by SEER were provided 
by the National Cancer for Health Statistics.20 22  SEER 
uses algorithms to process causes of death from the 
death certificate in order to identify a single, disease 
specific, underlying cause of death.20 SEER disease spe-
cific survival is defined as the time interval from diagno-
sis to death from differentiated thyroid cancer or time of 
censoring.
statistical analysis
We analyzed baseline patient characteristics, including 
the proportion of patients who underwent neck ultra-
sounds, radioiodine scans, and PET scans. To investi-
gate trends over time, the number of diagnoses, 
imaging tests (a composite of neck ultrasounds, radio-
iodine scans, and PET scans), treatments for recurrence 
(a composite of repeat neck surgery, additional radioac-
tive iodine treatment, and radiotherapy), and disease 
specific deaths were obtained for each year from 1998 to 
2011. We used Poisson regression to model the inci-
dence of differentiated thyroid cancer, use of imaging 
tests, and treatment for recurrence over time. The 
denominator for incidence was the US standard 
 
population20 and the denominators for imaging, treat-
ment of recurrence, and death were the number of 
patients at risk for the specific year.
To address bias due to potential differences between 
the imaged and non-imaged groups in terms of patient 
and disease characteristics, we used propensity score 
based analysis as a technique for quasi-randomization. 
Use of a specific imaging modality was analyzed as a 
dichotomous variable (eg, whether the patient had a 
neck ultrasound or not, radioiodine scan or not, and 
PET scan or not). In the first step of the analyses, we 
estimated propensity scores based on the multivariable 
logistic regression model of the imaging indicator 
 
variable. Observed covariates were age, sex, race, edu-
cation, income, SEER stage at diagnosis, histology, 
tumor size, initial surgery, and lymph nodes resection.

individual’s covariates—has been shown to serve as a 
balancing score, and can be used to reduce bias due to 
any covariate imbalance.23 Once estimated, the propen-
sity scores were therefore used in a second step model 
through regression adjustment. The second step model 
for investigating the association between use of imag-
ing and undergoing treatment for recurrence was based 
on multivariable logistic regression of each treatment 
variable: repeat neck surgery (yes v no), additional 
treatment with radioactive iodine (yes v no) and radio-
therapy (yes v no).
We used Cox proportional hazards regression to 
investigate the association between use of imaging and 
disease specific survival. Once again, propensity scores 
from the first step model described above were used in 
the second step Cox model through regression 
 
adjustment.
Of 28 220 patients in the study cohort, 191 (0.7%) had 
missing information on race, 2950 (10.5%) had missing 
information on high school education, 2950 (10.5%) 
had missing data on median household income, 2462 
(8.7%) had missing tumor size, 90 (0.3%) had missing 
surgery, and 107 (0.4%) had missing information on 
lymph node resection. There were no significant 
 
differences in sociodemographics, tumor characteris-
tics, and treatment between the patients with complete 
data and those with missing data in at least one covari-
ate. Hence, for logistic regression and Cox proportional 
hazards regression, primary analysis was based on 
patients with a complete set of information (n=22 770). 
Additionally, as a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the 
logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regres-
sion by coding the missing data for each covariate in a 
separate category by itself. This way, we were able to 
rerun the analyses on the entire cohort (n=28 220). The 
results were similar. All statistical analyses used SAS 9.4 
and R 3.2.4.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. There are no plans to dis-
seminate the results of the research to study participants 
or the relevant patient community.
Results
Table 1 describes the demographics of the study popu-
lation. Overall, 64.1% of the study population had local-
ized disease, with 32.1% having tumors less than 1.0 cm 
in diameter. Consistent with other studies of differenti-
ated thyroid cancer, 86.9% of the diagnoses were papil-
lary thyroid cancer and 70.3% of patients were women. 
Overall, there was a substantial utilization of imaging 
after primary treatment, with 56.7% of patients under-
going at least one neck ultrasound, 23.9% having a 
radioiodine scan, and 14.9% undergoing a PET scan.
Based on the Poisson regression model to account for 
the increasing size of the population at risk over time 
(from 1998 to 2011), there was a significant increase in 
incident cancer (rate ratio 1.05, 95% confidence interval 
1.05 to 1.06), imaging (1.13, 1.12 to 1.13), and treatment of 
recurrence (1.01, 1.01 to 1.02; fig 1 ). Use of imaging rose 
the most substantially. Change in death rate was not 
statistically significant (0.98, 0.96 to 1.00). Trends in

ment, 1.01 (0.99 to 1.02) for additional neck surgery, and 
1.01 (0.99 to 1.02) for radiotherapy (fig 2).
Table 2 shows the relation between imaging test 
(neck ultrasound, radioiodine scan, and PET scan) and 
treatment for recurrence (additional surgery, additional 
radioactive iodine treatment, and radiotherapy) after 
controlling for patient and tumor characteristics 
(patient age, sex, race, education, income, stage of dis-
ease, histology, tumor size, type of surgery, and lymph 
nodes resected). Undergoing ultrasound increased the 
likelihood of additional surgery (odds ratio 2.30, 95% 
confidence interval 2.05 to 2.58) and additional radioac-
tive iodine treatment (1.45, 1.26 to 1.69). We saw no sig-
nificant relation between use of neck ultrasound and 
subsequent treatment with  
radiotherapy (1.08, 0.97 to 
1.20). Radioiodine scans were associated with addi-
tional surgery (3.39, 3.06 to 3.76), radioactive iodine 
treatment (17
.83, 14.49 to 22.16), and radiotherapy (1.89, 
1.71 to 2.10). PET scans were associated with additional 
surgery (2.31, 2.09 to 2.55), radioactive iodine treatment 
(2.13, 1.89 to 2.40), and radiotherapy (4.98, 4.52 to 5.49).
A total of 1155 (4.1%) patients from the study cohort 
died from thyroid cancer. Results of the multivariable 
Cox proportional hazards model are shown in table 3. 
Undergoing neck ultrasound or PET scans did not sig-
nificantly affect disease specific survival (hazard ratio 
1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.98 to 1.27 and 0.91, 0.77 
to 1.07
, respectively); however, radioiodine scans were 
associated with an improved disease specific survival 
(0.70, 0.60 to 0.82).
discussion
Principal findings
Relative to the incident cases of differentiated thyroid 
cancer, the use of imaging after primary treatment has 
grown dramatically from 1998 to 2011. This substantial 
increase in imaging after primary treatment is associ-
ated with more diagnoses of recurrence, but no signifi-
cant improvement in disease specific survival, except 
with use of radioiodine scans. This finding suggests that 
imaging after primary treatment could lead to detection 
of more recurrence and subsequent treatment of recur-
rence, but in many cases without a beneficial effect on 
disease specific survival.
In our study, use of neck ultrasound was associated 
with a significant increase in the likelihood of recur-
rence treatment with surgery and with radioactive 
iodine treatment. However, neck ultrasound was not 
associated with improved disease specific survival. It is 
well known that most thyroid cancer recurrence is

regional (that is, appearing in metastases to cervical 
lymph nodes).17 18  Neck ultrasound is the optimal 
 
imaging modality for detecting recurrence of regional 
thyroid cancer, and our previous work demonstrates a 
significant rise in the use of neck ultrasound in patients 
with thyroid cancer between 2001 to 2009.6 
18  However, 
unlike distant metastases, the prognostic significance 
of regional recurrence for survival is debated.24 There-
fore, it is plausible that greater use of ultrasound imag-
ing is detecting more regional recurrence, but that this 
regional recurrence might not always indicate worse 
survival.
Use of radioiodine scans was associated with a signif-
icant increase in the use of surgery, radioactive iodine 
treatment, and radiation to treat recurrence. Radioio-
dine scans were associated with a significant improve-
ment in disease specific survival. There are two 
plausible reasons for this finding. Radioactive iodine 
scans should only be used for patients with a history of 
iodine avid disease who have biochemical evidence of 
recurrence. These patients have a need to know whether 
structural iodine avid recurrence exists, and therefore 
warrant treatment with radioactive iodine. In patients 
with iodine avid disease, especially those with distant 
metastases that are not amendable to surgery, 
 
radioactive iodine is often effective treatment. In addi-
tion, iodine avidity generally suggests well differenti-
ated disease, disease that historically is slower growing, 
and disease with a better prognosis.12 
25 Even with pro-
pensity score analysis to reduce potential bias induced 
by confounding by indication, the relation between 
radioiodine scans and improved survival exists.
PET scans were also associated with a significant 
increase in the likelihood of being treated with surgery, 
radioactive iodine, and radiation after recurrence. How-
ever, PET scans were not associated with improved dis-
ease specific survival. There are two possible 
explanations for this finding. Firstly, disease detected 
by PET scans is rarely iodine avid and is typically less 
well differentiated, more aggressive, and less  
responsive 
to treatment than iodine avid disease.26 27  Thus, PET 
positive disease correlates with worse prognosis, which 
could explain why use of PET imaging is not associated 
with improved disease specific survival. However, pro-
pensity score analysis, which introduces quasi-ran-
domization, still showed no significant association 
between use of PET scans and outcome. Secondly, PET 
scanning is an expensive imaging modality, with a 
marked rise in use for patients with thyroid cancer since 
2004.6 
9  However, despite being used more frequently in 
these patients, our previous work has found that imag-
ing with PET scans only changed management 30% of 
the time.28 This suggests that although there is a role for 
PET scans in thyroid cancer surveillance, its use needs 
to be better defined.
strengths and limitations of study
There is currently little data on effective long term sur-
veillance in patients with thyroid cancer. A major 
strength of our study was that we evaluated current 
imaging practices after primary treatment of thyroid 
cancer and we investigated its relation to both recur-
rence and disease specific survival. A second strength is 
that we addressed potential confounding by indication 
through use of propensity score analysis.
This study had several limitations. Large patient 
databases, such as SEER-Medicare, lack patient specific 
data such as iodine avidity, patient preference, and 
indications for imaging or procedures. In addition, 
SEER-Medicare does not have adequate information on 
type of insurance and type of hospital. These could be 
relevant confounders that were unmeasured in our 
study. However, the large size of the SEER-Medicare 
database is also an asset because it allows us to identify 
associations that cannot be identified with smaller 
cohorts. 
Another limitation was the use of billing data to iden-
tify imaging after primary treatment and treatment of 
recurrence. Although studies using billing data have 
limitations, previous studies focusing on other medical 
conditions have shown the feasibility and use of billing 
data to identify patients with specific diagnoses or pro-
cedures.29-31 An additional limitation was that some 
physicians might use bedside ultrasound as an exten-
sion of the physical examination and a billing record 
might not be created. Therefore, the number of neck 
ultrasounds could have been underestimated. Physi-
cians might also be more likely to get formal imaging if 
there is biochemical evidence of recurrence, such as 
rising thyroglobulin, or an abnormality on bedside 
ultrasound, thus resulting in a selection bias and inflat-
ing the likelihood that patients undergoing imaging 
will result in a diagnosis and treatment for recurrence. 
Furthermore, this current study included patients 
primarily over the age of 65 years, which could have 
limited the applicability to other patient populations. 
However, the fastest increase in thyroid cancer has been 
seen in this age group.32  This cohort also has an 
increased risk of mortality from thyroid cancer due to 
their advanced age, which makes it the optimal cohort 
to identify any effect on survival.20 Finally, the retro-
spective nature of this study only allows us to show

associations between imaging and treatment for recur-
rence or survival. Although causality could be complex, 
this study still serves as the necessary groundwork for 
future randomized controlled trials, cost effectiveness 
analysis, and studies assessing the role of patients in 
surveillance decision making.
Despite the study limitations, we believe that this 
study has powerful implications. As far as we know, it is 
the first population based study in differentiated thy-
roid cancer to assess the effect of imaging after primary 
treatment on treatment for recurrence and disease spe-
cific survival.
Comparison with other studies
Previous work has looked at the effect of imaging after 
primary treatment on survival in other cancers.33-35 In 
these other studies, more imaging was associated with 
a worse prognosis. However, in thyroid cancer, we 
found no strong relation between imaging and disease 
specific survival, except with radioiodine scans. Com-
pared with other cancers, this finding might be due to 
the relatively indolent course of differentiated thyroid 
cancer versus other malignancies, or due to controlling 
for other patient characteristics (such as age and stage 
at diagnosis).
Conclusions and policy implications
This current study has implications for patients, physi-
cians, and policy makers. It is the foundation for under-
standing when to image and when to treat recurrence, 
two key issues in the follow-up of patients with thyroid 
cancer. This controversy over appropriate imaging and 
subsequent management of recurrence arises from the 
overall excellent prognosis for patients with thyroid 
cancer and the fact that treatment of recurrence is not 
without risks and can result in patient harm.1 11-16 20  In 
addition, although the incidence of thyroid cancer has 
been rising for the past several decades, the disease 
specific survival in differentiated thyroid cancer has 
remained relatively stable by comparison.1
Imaging after primary treatment could lead to more 
treatment for recurrence; however, without an 
improvement in survival, except for radioiodine scans 
in presumably iodine avid disease, it is not clear 
whether more imaging equals better care. It is also not 
clear whether the benefits of greater imaging outweigh 
the financial costs, heightened patient anxiety, and 
risk of patient harm from the treatment for recur-
rence.36-39 This current study is the foundation needed 
to define the appropriate long term follow-up of 
patients with thyroid cancer. This is the groundwork 
for future cost effectiveness studies, randomized con-
trolled trials, and studies assessing the role of the 
patient and the physician in determining the optimal 
surveillance plan. The necessary next steps are to 
understand the role of patient preference and patient 
anxiety in surveillance trends, determine the role of 
physician incentives in defining imaging patterns, and 
determine patient outcomes when small recurrences 
are followed versus when small recurrences are inter-
vened on.
