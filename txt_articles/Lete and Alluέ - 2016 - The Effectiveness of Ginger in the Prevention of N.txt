Introduction
Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) is a perennial herb belonging 
to the family Zingiberaceae, primarily grown in Asia and 
tropical regions, and is one of the most important and widely 
consumed herbs worldwide. Cultivated for its edible under-
ground stem (rhizome), ginger has been used since antiquity 
both as a spice and as a herbal medicine to treat a variety of 
primarily gastrointestinal ailments, such as nausea, vomiting 
(emesis), diarrhea, and dyspepsia, and also diverse ailments, 
including arthritis, muscular aches, and fever.1 This long and 
established history of medicinal use in humans has stimulated 
ongoing clinical trials to scientifically assess the effectiveness 
of ginger as an adjuvant therapy or as a complementary and 
alternative medicine (CAM) in a number of indications related 
to nausea and vomiting; the most studied of these include 
nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP), chemotherapy-
induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), postoperative nausea 
and vomiting, and, to a lesser extent, motion sickness.2 Ginger 
is considered as a safe herb for human consumption.3 Ginger 
appears on the US Food and Drug Administration generally 
recognized as safe list and is included in the pharmacopeias of 
many Western countries. The British Herbal Compendium lists 
ginger as a remedy for vomiting with pregnancy along with 
other indications.4 Indeed, ginger capsules have been available 
in UK for more than 40 years as a remedy for motion sickness 
and as a carminative. In 2012, the European Medicines Agency 
published an assessment report from the committee of herbal 
medicinal products describing the use of ginger in the preven-
tion of nausea and vomiting, concluding that plausible clinical 
evidence exists for the beneficial effects of dry powdered rhi-
zome on a number of conditions related to nausea and vomit-
ing.5 This review summarizes the development of ginger as an 
antiemetic for NPV and CINV and will also focus more on a 
critical appraisal of the different preparations and presenta-
tions of ginger available for patients and the posology used.
Ginger Chemistry and Pharmacological Effects
The rhizome of ginger contains a wide variety of biologically 
active secondary metabolites. The rhizome comprises 1%–4% 
of volatile oils and an oleoresin.6 The distinctive odor and fla-
vor of ginger are due to these volatile oils and also nonvolatile 
phenolic compounds, which have pungent properties.7 The 
volatile (steam extracted) oils consist mainly of sequiterpene 
hydrocarbons, predominantly zingiberol, which gives rise to 
the characteristic aroma of ginger. The nonvolatile pheno-
lic phytochemicals of ginger consist of gingerols, shogaols, 
paradols, and zingerone, and more than 30 gingerol-related 
compounds can be fractionated from crude ginger.8 Gin-
gerols correspond to a series of chemical homologs differenti-
ated by the length of their unbranched alkyl chains (n6–n12). 
 
Of all the gingerols, 6-gingerol is the most abundant and well-
investigated ginger phytochemical.2

AbstrACt: The rhizomes of Zingiber officinale (ginger) have been used since ancient times as a traditional remedy for gastrointestinal complaints. The 
most active ingredients in ginger are the pungent principles, particularly gingerols and shogaols. Various preclinical and clinical studies have evaluated 
ginger as an effective and safe treatment for nausea and vomiting in the context of pregnancy and as an adjuvant treatment for chemotherapy-induced nausea 
and vomiting. Here, we provide an update and analysis of ginger use for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, with a focus on the types and presentations 
of ginger available. We also examine the pharmacokinetic properties of ginger and highlight the type and posology of ginger and its metabolites.

The major pharmacological activity of ginger appears to 
be attributed to gingerols and shogaols, which are the dehy-
drated products of gingerols. Consequently, gingerols are 
the major components in the fresh ginger rhizome, whereas 
shogaols, especially 6-shogaol, are the most abundant poly-
phenolic constituents of dried ginger.7
In relation to its antiemetic properties, ginger (and its 
constituents) acts peripherally, within the gastrointestinal 
tract, by increasing the gastric tone and motility due to antich-
olinenergic and antiserotonergic actions.9,10 It is also reported 
to increase gastric emptying.11 This combination of functions 
explains the widely accepted ability of ginger to relieve symp-
toms of functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as dyspep-
sia, abdominal pain, and nausea, which is often associated 
with decreased gastric motility. Although the exact mode of 
action of ginger in relation to its antiemetic properties is still 
being unraveled, three recent studies have investigated the 
action of ginger on serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT3, 
and 5-HT4) and cholinergic (M3) receptor activities.12–14 
Working on the evidence that emetogenic chemotherapeu-
tic drugs increase 5-HT concentration and activate visceral 
vagal afferent nerve activity, Jin et al used patch-clamp meth-
ods to study the effects of ginger and its pungent constitu-
ents on 5-HT-evoked inward currents in rat nodose ganglia 
neurons. Results showed that 6-shogaol, 6-gingerol, and 
zingerone could inhibit the 5-HT response in a concentration- 
dependent manner, with 6-shogaol exhibiting the great-
est potency.12 Furthermore, the inhibition of 5-HT activity 
occurred in a noncompetitive manner, validating the earlier 
work.10 Using a different methodological approach (calcium 
influx and radioligand-binding assays), Walstab et al.13 used 
heterologous expression to demonstrate, for the first time, the 
inhibitory effect of 6-shogaol and 6-gingeral on recombinant 
human 5-HT3 receptors and also native receptors from human 
gut enteric neurons. This inhibition was found to be noncom-
petitive since a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, GR65630, was 
not displaced by the ginger extract. Interestingly, both studies 
posited that since binding of ginger to 5-HT receptors occurs 
at a site other than the orthosteric-binding site of competitive 
5-HT antagonists, combination therapy with known phar-
maceutical 5-HT antagonists might increase the antiemetic 
efficacy. Additionally, using a bioassay for contractile (M) 3 
receptors (guinea pig ileum), Pertz et al.14 demonstrated that 
6-, 8-, and 10-gingerol and 6-shogaol could slightly but sig-
nificantly depress carbachol-induced contractions. Collec-
tively, these studies provide molecular evidence that ginger 
antagonizes activation of (M) 3 and 5-HT3 receptors, thereby 
inhibiting afferent inputs to the central nervous system that 
are stimulated by specific neurotransmitters, such as sero-
tonin, released from the gastrointestinal tract.
Ginger has also been studied extensively in vitro and in 
animal models of hypertension, oxidative stress, fungal infec-
tion, and cancer; consequently, ginger has been investigated 
in the treatment of many different disease states, including 
cancer, osteoarthritis, and diabetes. These are beyond the 
scope of this review but have been the subject of several recent 
reviews.15–17
Presentations of Ginger
Ginger is used in numerous forms, including fresh, dried, 
pickled, preserved, crystallized, candied, and powdered or 
ground. Presentations can include capsules, tablets, tinc-
tures, teas, and liquid extracts. Evidently, the concentra-
tions of active ingredients (gingerols and shogaols) will differ 
between the different preparations and the processing steps 
involved. Indeed, gingerols are thermally labile, and the extent 
of gingerol-to-shogaol conversion will likely impact signifi-
cantly on the medicinal benefits since the two compounds 
vary in their bioavailability and pharmacological properties.18 
A recent methodological analysis using high-performance liq-
uid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to time-of-flight mass 
spectro 
metry demonstrated that dried ginger powder products 
contained the highest quantity of gingerol-related compounds 
(7–14 mg/g), followed by fresh ginger (2–2.8 mg/g) and pow-
dered ginger tea products (∼0.8 mg/g).19 Attempts to assess 
the efficacy of ginger in many clinical trials might have been 
conceivably weakened by the inconsistency in the form of gin-
ger used (fresh or dried) and also the dosing regimen. Of the 
12 studies reviewed in a recent meta-analysis on the use of 
ginger in NVP, various preparations were described, includ-
ing ginger biscuits, ginger powder capsules, ginger essence 
capsules, ginger extract capsules, and ginger syrup in water.20 
Also, the daily dosage varied from 600 to 2500 mg. Similarly, 
in a recent systematic review on the use of ginger in CINV, 
typical dosing regimens were 1–2 g of ginger.21 To obtain 
patient compliance, it would be necessary to formulate ginger 
into the dosage forms that are practical to use, while retaining 
the active components. In this respect, capsules are the com-
mon dosage form considered for many oral drugs and differ-
ent methodologies exist for the preparation of active gingerols 
(and shogaols) in capsule form.22 In the above meta-analysis of 
NVP, 10 out of 12 studies used ginger in a capsule form and 
7 out of 7 the studies reviewed for CINV used encapsulated 
ginger.20 Considering the dosage, there is a remarkable lack of 
information on the concentration of active ingredients in the 
various preparations used in clinical trials; none of the NVP 
studies reviewed above described any form of chemical analy-
sis to quantify the concentration of active ingredients, and only 
 
2 out of 7 CINV studies did so. This is obviously essential infor-
mation as commercial preparations of ginger may have widely 
different concentrations of gingerols. In a study of dietary gin-
ger root supplements, Schwertner et al used HPLC to measure 
the concentrations of active ingredients in locally purchased 
ginger capsules. Results ranged from 0.0 to 9.43 mg/g for 
6-gingerol, 0.16 to 2.18 mg/g for 6-shogaol, 0.00 to 1.1 mg/g 
for 8-gingerol, and 0.00 to 1.40 mg/g for 10-gingerol, and 
somewhat worryingly, the suggested daily dose varied from 
250 mg to nearly 5 g.23 The absence of standardized ginger

constituents has also been highlighted in a recent study pro-
tocol to assess ginger in the setting of chemotherapy-induced 
nausea.24 In this study design, the authors have chosen to use 
a commercially prepared ginger extract capsule that has been 
standardized to contain 5% gingerols (referring to the total 
gingerol strength), which is equivalent to 15 mg of active 
ingredient per 300 mg ginger extract and is an amount uti-
lized in some previous clinical trials.24
In addition to differences in the quantity of ginger used 
between studies, the dosing intervals also vary between clinical 
trials. In this regard, two recent clinical studies have investi-
gated the pharmacokinetics of different ginger preparations in 
humans.25,26 In the first study, healthy volunteers were given a 
single oral dose of ginger, ranging from 100 mg to 2 g, and the 
blood samples were periodically taken up to 72 hours. Results 
showed that no free gingerols or shogaol could be detected in 
the plasma; however, these analytes were readily detected as 
predominantly glucuronide and sulfate conjugates in serum, 
indicating that gingerols undergo oxidation of their pheno-
lic side chain.25 Extending this analysis, the same authors 
developed a more sensitive technique and established that free 
forms of 10-gingerol and 6-shogaol, as well as glucuronide 
metabolites of 6-, 8-, and 10-gingerol and 6-shogaol could be 
identified one hour after oral dosing with 2 g of the ginger 
extract.26 Interestingly, the half-life of these compounds and 
their metabolites was determined to be between one and three 
hours in human plasma, and multiple dosing experiments 
established that no accumulation of metabolites occurred. 
Given these results, it may be prudent to extend the frequency 
of dosing, within the expectations of patient compliance.
Although there is no consensus agreement on the correct 
dosage of ginger, most clinical studies recommend a safe daily 
dose of 1000 mg, at least in the setting on NVP.27–29 Accord-
ingly, 7 out of 12 studies described in the Viljoen et al.20 meta-
analysis used this final amount, and a subgroup analysis in 
this report favored the lower daily dosage of ,1500 mg for 
nausea relief. As a demonstration, Ding et al.30 calculated 
that 1000 mg is equivalent to one teaspoon (5 g) of freshly 
grated ginger extract, 2 mL of liquid ginger extract, four cups 
(237 mL each) of prepackaged ginger tea, two teaspoons of gin-
ger syrup (10 mL), or two pieces of crystallized ginger (1 in2). 
The European Medicines Agency monograph summarized the 
following most often used dosages (through June 2010): NVP 
500 mg three times daily for three to five days, postopera-
tive nausea and vomiting 1000 mg for one hour before induc-
tion of anesthesia, and motion sickness 1000 mg for one hour 
before start of travel.5 The US Food and Drug Administration 
generally recognized as safe list states that up to 4 g of ginger 
can be consumed daily, although these amounts are generally 
not reached in studies. Indeed, the illustration by Ding et al.30 
serves to apprise patients of the ease of exceeding the maxi-
mum daily dose subject to the type of ginger consumed. Inter-
estingly, these regimens often consider the prophylactic use of 
ginger to delay acute emesis, presumably working in a manner 
associated with priming of receptors. Indeed, successful 
 
treatments for CINV have been proven to be those given 
before chemotherapy treatment starts.31
Clinical Effectiveness of Ginger
As stated earlier, the most common and well-established use 
of ginger is undoubtedly its utilization in alleviating symptoms 
of nausea and vomiting. In this sense, it is perhaps appropri-
ate to mention the differences between nausea and vomiting. 
Nausea is characterized by an uncomfortable sensation experi-
enced in the throat and epigastrum that may or may not result 
in the expulsion of contents from the stomach, while vomit-
ing is the involuntary, forceful expulsion of contents from the 
stomach. Nausea and vomiting can occur separately, although 
since vomiting is nearly always preceeded by nausea, they are 
often considered components of a single entity.32 Nausea is a 
nonobservable phenomenon, while vomiting is objective, and 
the occurrence and the frequency of vomiting may be mea-
sured. In the clinical setting, various instruments are used 
to assess nausea and vomiting based on self-reporting.33 The 
INV-2 or Rhodes Index of Nausea, Vomiting, and Retching 
is an eight-item self-report questionnaire that measures nau-
sea and vomiting as separate entities and is used frequently 
as an outcome measure in controlled studies.34 Another com-
mon tool to measure nausea is a visual analog scale (VAS) of 
0–10 cm to score severity.
Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. Nausea and vomit-
ing affects a large proportion of women in early pregnancy. It 
is thought that up to 80% of women have NVP in some degree 
during the first trimester of pregnancy, and for the major-
ity of women, symptoms typically resolve by 12–14 weeks 
gestation.35,36 Colloquially known as morning sickness, this term 
is clearly a misnomer because symptoms can occur at any time 
of the day.37 In a small percentage of pregnancies (0.2%–5%), 
persistent and excessive nausea and vomiting resulting in 
dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and weight loss (termed 
Hyperemesis gravidarum) can occur and is a leading cause of 
hospital admissions during the first half of pregnancy.38 Evi-
dently, this often debilitating condition can have a significant 
impact on the quality of a woman’s life, both personally and 
professionally, and can be emotionally traumatic. The exact 
cause of NVP remains unclear and probably depends on sev-
eral factors.39 Among these, a commonly accepted etiology is 
ascribed to hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy, 
such as elevation of serum human chorionic gonadotrophin,40 
estrogens,41 and also Helicobacter pylori infection.42
Several medications are currently available for the treat-
ment of NVP.43,44 Emesis can be treated with drugs known 
as antiemetics, most notably serotonin (5-HT3) receptor 
antagonists. However, many women are cautious of medi-
cines for fear of harming the fetus, especially given that NVP 
usually occurs during the vulnerable period of embryonic 
organogenesis. Accordingly, the popularity of CAM, includ-
ing nonpharmacological medicines and herbal extracts, has 
 Lete and Allué
14
IntegratIve MedIcIne InsIghts 2016:11
grown considerably in recent years, and a high frequency of 
CAM use during pregnancy has been noted.45 A recent multi-
national study on the prevalence of herbal medicine use in 
pregnancy found that over 28% of participating women used 
herbals (2735/9459).46 Of the 134 different herbs used, ginger 
and cranberry accounted for the majority of herbals (23.5% 
and 22.7%, respectively), with valerian and raspberry being 
also popular choices.
The impact of the use of ginger as an antiemetic in NVP 
has been extensively investigated in clinical studies for at least 
30 years.47 Because of the heterogeneity inherent in the study 
design and occasional problems with quality, not all randomi-
zed clinical trials can be incorporated into a meta-analysis. 
Nonetheless, two meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials 
(Level I evidence) have been published very recently.20,48 In the 
smaller of the two meta-analyses, six studies conducted from 
1991 to 2009 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and 508 subjects 
were randomly assigned to receive ginger (∼1000 mg daily) 
or placebo.48 Predictably, these studies varied in the formula-
tion and dosage of ginger: three studies administered 250 mg 
ginger capsules four times daily28,29,49; one study used 350 mg 
ginger capsules four times daily,50 one study administered 
250 mg ginger syrup four times daily,51 and one study admin-
istered 500 mg ginger powder in biscuit, five biscuits daily.52 
Although the duration of study also varied (between four days 
and three weeks), using an end point of improvement of early 
NVP, the meta-analysis demonstrated that ginger was bet-
ter than placebo in improving NVP when given at a dose of 
∼1000 mg/d for at least four days. The authors of the meta-
analysis concluded that ginger was an effective nonpharma-
cological option for NVP and was better than placebo. In the 
second systematic review and meta-analysis, Viljoen et al.20 
studied the efficacy of orally administered ginger as treatment 
for NVP in pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy and 
reviewed randomized studies from 1991 to 2011. From 302 
records identified through database searching, 12 studies met 
the criteria established by the authors, involving 1278 preg-
nant women and included the six studies reviewed by Thomson 
et al.3 The six additional studies used ginger capsules of dif-
ferent dosages: 125 mg four times daily,53 200 mg three times 
daily,54 325 mg (× 2) three times daily,55 and 500 mg two 
times56,57 or three times58 daily. Ginger versus placebo was 
assessed in 7 out of 12 studies.28,29,49,51–54 Individual results 
from all seven studies concluded that ginger was more effec-
tive than placebo in relieving the intensity of NVP in general; 
however, only three from the seven studies concluded that 
ginger was more effective in reducing the number of vomiting 
episodes (although there was a trend for improvement).28,29,48 
In four studies assessing ginger versus vitamin B6 supplemen-
tation, a common first-line treatment for nausea, three studies 
reported no difference between the two groups,50,57,58 and one 
study showed that ginger significantly improved nausea and 
vomiting symptoms.55 Besides this meta-analysis, a recently 
published study also found no significant differences between 
the ginger group (47 patients treated with 250 mg ginger four 
times daily) and the vitamin B6 group (40 mg twice daily).59 
One study assessed the efficacy of ginger against the anti-
histaminic drug dimenhydrinate and found ginger to be just 
as effective, with fewer side effects.56 Lastly, one study used 
metoclopramide, a dopamine receptor antagonist, as compar-
ator. The effects of ginger were not significantly different from 
those obtained to metoclopramide54 In conclusion, Viljoen 
et al acknowledged the limited number of studies and low 
quality of evidence, but based on the evidence, ginger could 
be a possibly effective option for women with NVP, although 
large standardized trials are necessary. A brief description of 
the studies is given in Table 1.
Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. CINV is 
a major adverse effect of chemotherapy, and cancer patients’ 
rate of nausea is the most distressing side effect of chemother-
apy.60 The risk of suffering CINV is dependent on the emetic 
potential of the chemotherapy.61 Some chemotherapeutic 
agents, including cyclophosphamide and cisplatin, can lead 
to an extremely high incidence of CINV, upward of 90%.31 
The standard of care for chemotherapy-induced vomiting is 
antiemetics, most notably sertononin (5-HT3) receptor ana-
tagonists and glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone; how-
ever, efforts to control nausea have been less successful.62 With 
respect to chemotherapy-induced nausea, the following three 
separate stages can be categorized: anticipatory nausea (before 
initiation of chemotherapy), acute nausea (occurring within 
24 hours of chemotherapy), and delayed nausea (24 hours 
to five days postchemotherapy).63 In a recent double-blind 
multicenter trial, 576 adult cancer patients were assigned 
to receive: (1) placebo, (2) 0.5 g ginger, (3) 1.0 g ginger, or 
 
(4) 1.5 g ginger, on top of antiemetic treatment (5-HT3 recep-
tor antagonists).64 Patients received the regimen for two × six-
day periods; ginger administration started three days prior 
to chemotherapy. Significantly, this study, the largest to date, 
standardized the ginger constituents used in the trial and the 
capsules contained a purified liquid extract of ginger root with 
concentrated 8.5 mg of combined gingerols, zingerone, and 
shogaol content (equivalent to 250 mg of ginger root). Results 
from mixed-model analyses showed that all concentrations 
of ginger significantly reduced the incidence of acute, but 
not delayed, nausea, with 0.5 and 1.0 g being the most effec-
tive.64 A prior study of CINV also standardized the ginger 
concentration to a combination of active ingredients.65 In this 
case, HPLC analysis was used to verify the concentrations, 
which were found to be 2.15% 6-gingerol, 0.72% 8-gingerol, 
1.78% 10-gingerol, and 0.37% 6-shogaol. Participants (129) 
were randomized to receive 1 g (four capsules of 250 mg) of 
ginger daily, 2 g (eight capsules) of ginger daily, or matching 
placebo for three days together with an antiemetic (5-HT3 
receptor antagonist and/or aprepitant, a neurokinin 1 recep-
tor blocker), and the duration of intervention was three days 
postchemotherapy. Although well tolerated, ginger provided 
no additional benefit for reduction of the prevalence or severity

pyrosis (heartburn or reflux)71 and eructation (belching).50 
In a study of 27 healthy volunteers who were given a single 
oral dose of ginger (ranging from 100 mg to 2 g), minor gas-
trointestinal upsets were the major treatment associated tox-
icities.25 Despite previous studies indicating that ginger could 
interfere with platelet aggregation and cause excessive bleed-
ing,72 in a randomized crossover study of 12 healthy volunteers 
taking 1.2 g of dried rhizome three times daily for two weeks, 
ginger did not affect platelet aggregation and had no effect 
on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of a single 
25 mg dose of warfarin taken on day 7.73 Of note, the meta-
analysis of NVP by Viljoen et al also reviewed the safety of 
ginger as a secondary objective. The authors found that ginger 
did “[not] pose a risk for side-effects or adverse events during 
pregnancy.”20
Aside from Level I evidence, safety of ginger in NVP 
has been studied in at least two Level II (nonrandomized or 
cohort) studies. In the first prospective study, the pregnancy 
outcome of 187 women from Toronto who were exposed to 
ginger during the first trimester of pregnancy was compared 
with women who had been exposed to nonteratogenic drugs 
that were not antiemetics.74 There were no statistically signifi-
cant differences between the two groups in terms of live births,

ginger was equivalent to vitamin B6 for  
reducing nausea
 
of acute or delayed CINV when used as an adjuvant therapy. 
These two studies were included in a recent review of con-
trolled clinical trials by Marx et al.21 who performed a system-
atic search of the literature until April 2012. From 27 records 
analyzed, seven studies fitted the inclusion criteria. The five 
additional studies used the following encapsulated ginger of 
different dosages: 250 mg four times daily,66,67 500 mg three 
times68 or four times69 daily, and 167 mg six times daily or 
400 mg five times daily depending on patient weight.70 Of the 
five additional studies, one reported no additional benefit to 
standard emetic control,66 two reported some benefit,68,70 and 
two reported that ginger performed equally well as metoclopr-
amide.67,69 Thus, from the seven trials analyzed, five reported 
favorable results, while results from the other two clinical tri-
als were unfavorable. Similar to the conclusions in the study 
by Viljoen et al.20, Marx et al posited that the mixed results 
from the trials could perhaps be explained by the nonstan-
dardized preparations of ginger used and inconsistencies in 
study methods and outcomes.
safety Issues of Ginger
Adverse effects after ingestion of ginger are uncommon but 
can include mild gastrointestinal complications, such as 
 Lete and Allué

spontaneous abortions, therapeutic abortions, birth weight, or 
gestational age. A more recent and larger population-based 
cohort study in Norway (68,522 women) found that the use of 
ginger during pregnancy (1020 women, 1.5%) was not associ-
ated with an increased risk of congenital malformations, still 
birth/perinatal birth, low birth weight, or preterm birth.75
Conclusion
Ginger is an ancient herb used widely in history for its many 
natural medicinal properties and particularly as an antiemetic. 
The best available evidence demonstrates that ginger is an 
effective and inexpensive treatment for nausea and vomiting 
and is safe. Given the attainability of ginger preparations with 
known active ingredients, it would be interesting to perform 
preclinical studies to understand the efficacy of principal 
ginger constituents, including gingerols and shogaols. Dose-
finding studies using varied standardized extracts should also 
be undertaken to accurately determine the effective dose and 
preparation of ginger. The results from these studies could be 
used to optimize the design of clinical trials to enhance the 
efficacy of ginger in nausea and vomiting.
