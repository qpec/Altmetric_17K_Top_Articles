Abstract
Importance—CJD is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder associated with the accumulation of 
infectious abnormal PrP through a mechanism of templated misfolding. A recent report has 
described the detection of abnormal PrP in vCJD patient urine using protein misfolding by cylic 
amplification, which was apparently absent in the more common sporadic form of CJD (sCJD). A 
non-invasive diagnostic test could improve early diagnosis of sCJD, and by screening donations, 
mitigate the potential risks of prion transmission through human urine-derived pharmaceuticals. 
Here we describe the adaptation of the direct detection assay, developed originally as a blood test 
for vCJD, for the detection of disease-associated PrP in urine samples from sCJD patients.
Objectives—To determine the feasibility of sCJD diagnosis by adaptation of an established 
vCJD diagnostic blood test to urine.
Design—Retrospective, cross sectional study.
Setting—Urine samples obtained during the MRC PRION-1 trial, the National Prion Monitoring 
Cohort study, and/or referred to the National Prion Clinic or Dementia Research Centre at the 
National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in the United Kingdom.
Participants—Anonymised urine samples from healthy non-neurological control subjects 
(n=91), patients with non-prion neurodegenerative diseases (n=34) and patients with prion disease 
(n=37) of which 20 were sCJD.

 Main Outcome Measure—Presence of sCJD infection determined by an assay that captures, 
enriches, and detects disease-associated prion protein isoforms.
Results—The assay’s specificity for prion disease was 100% [CI: 97% to 100%] with no false 
positive reactions from 125 controls, including 34 from a range of neurodegenerative diseases. In 
contrast to a previous study which used a different methodology, sensitivity to vCJD infection was 
low with only 1 out of 13 patients testing positive whilst sensitivity to sCJD was unexpectedly 
high at 40% [CI:19-64%].
Conclusions—We determined 40% of sCJD urine samples as positive. This is the first 
demonstration of an assay that can detect sCJD infection in urine or any target analyte outside of 
the central nervous system. Urine detection could allow the development of rapid, molecular 
diagnostics for sporadic CJD and has implications for other neurodegenerative diseases where 
disease-related assemblies of misfolded proteins might also be present in urine.
Introduction
Prion diseases are lethal, transmissible neurodegenerative conditions of humans and animals 
caused by misfolding and aggregation of the prion protein (PrP)1;2. It is the transmissibility 
of disease that is a defining feature of the group, and has resulted in several high profile 
epidemics of acquired prion disease, including for example, kuru in humans, bovine 
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and its human counterpart variant Creutzfeldt-
Jakob disease (vCJD)3. Prion disease may also occur as sporadic CJD (sCJD) without any 
obvious exposure to an infectious source, the clinical syndrome being rapidly progressive 
with a median survival of around four months4. Central to the pathogenesis of prion disease 
is the autocatalytic, templated remodelling of the host’s normal cellular prion protein (PrPC) 
leading to accumulation of abnormal PrP isoforms typified by insoluble aggregates often 
termed PrPSc 5–8. It is increasingly recognised that more common neurodegenerative 
diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease also involve similar seeding processes and worldwide 
efforts are now being made to establish the precise role of prion-like mechanisms in a range 
of human diseases9–12.
As a consequence of widespread exposure to BSE prions, it is thought that as many as 1 in 
2000 of the UK population may be prion carriers13. Significant public health concerns are 
associated with the transmissibility of prion diseases and the potential prevalence of vCJD 
infection has required widespread precautionary measures to limit iatrogenic transmission. 
The risks of iatrogenic transmission from individuals with sCJD have long been established, 
with the primary sources being contaminated neurosurgical instruments and devices14 and 
cadaveric donor-derived materials such as dura mater and pituitary growth hormone15. The 
incidence of sCJD is around 2 persons per million per year, which typically occurs with 
increasing incidence from late middle age onwards and has a uniform gender and 
geographical distribution. The lifetime risk of sCJD is around 1 in 5000 in the UK. 
Unfortunately, approximately half of patients are only diagnosed at a clinically advanced 
state16.
The presence of PrPSc and other abnormal isoforms of PrP is a specific and potentially 
sensitive diagnostic indicator for prion disease and methods for their detection have been

 developed that can be applied to a range of tissues and fluids17–21. The impetus for the 
development of diagnostic methods has been the emergence of vCJD which is characterised 
by a widespread peripheral pathology22 and the infection of blood23;24 and urine25. 
Despite the development of an assay for the diagnosis of vCJD using blood21;26 and the 
reporting of vCJD infection being detectable in urine25, the application of such techniques 
to sCJD has been confounded by the restriction of significant pathology to the central 
nervous system (CNS). Coincident with the reporting of detection in the urine of patients 
with vCJD was the failure to detect any signs of infection in sCJD patient samples using the 
same technique25. However, the method used has never been convincingly demonstrated to 
detect sCJD and notably no positive controls were included in this study. Whilst the 
application of amyloid seeding assays to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have proved effective for 
the diagnosis of sCJD, the invasive nature of this procedure has limited their application to 
patients with a high index of suspicion of prion disease27.
A non-invasive pre-mortem biochemical test for sCJD diagnosis could significantly reduce 
the extended time currently taken to establish a firm diagnosis, which can comprise the 
majority of a patient’s remaining life16, and reduce the threshold for testing in patients with 
relatively early, non-specific clinical features. Here we report the application to urine testing 
of an adapted blood assay, originally developed for vCJD21. Strikingly, the assay was able 
to detect sCJD infection in almost half of the patient samples, the first demonstration of an 
assay capable of diagnosing sCJD from urine or any peripheral analyte.
Methods
Source of urine samples
Patient and control urine samples were obtained with informed consent from patients 
enrolled in the MRC PRION-1 trial28, National Prion Monitoring Cohort study, and/or 
referred to the National Prion Clinic or Dementia Research Centre at the National Hospital 
for Neurology and Neurosurgery. CJD diagnoses were made according to established 
criteria27;29 All samples were collected using standard urinalysis preservative (boric acid, 
sodium formate and sodium borate) and stored frozen at -70°C in multiple aliquots of 2ml 
and thawed before use. Samples were analysed blind to the operators and only decoded after 
analysis and determination of positive or negative status.
Testing procedure
Samples were tested using a modification of a method previously described21. Briefly, 
400μL of each sample was diluted 1:1 into 400μL buffer [200mM Tris, 4%w/v BSA, 4%w/v 
CHAPS, 2 tablets complete protease inhibitors (Roche), 80 units Benzonase (Grade II, 
Merck)] containing 23mg of Capture Matrix (CM) [sub-45μm stainless steel particles, 
Goodfellow, Cambridge, UK] and incubated overnight. The CM was isolated using a 
magnetic rack, supernatant discarded, and washed repeatedly with 1mL PBS + 0.05%v/v 
Tween-20 (PBST). After the final wash, all liquid was removed and the CM heated at 110°C. 
To each tube 50µL of biotinylated primary antibody (ICSM18, D-Gen, Ltd) prepared at 
1µg/mL in PBS + 1%v/v Tween-20 (PBST*) was added and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. 
Samples were washed repeatedly with 1mL PBST isolating CM each time. Each sample was

 then incubated with High Sensitivity NeutrAvidin-HRP (Pierce) prepared at a 1:100 000 
dilution in PBST* at 37°C for 45 minutes. Samples were again washed repeatedly with 1mL 
PBST isolating CM each time. To each sample 60µL of SuperSignal ELISA Femto 
chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) was added and CM was evenly distributed into three 
replicate wells of a black 96-well plate (Greiner). Each plate included set of six quality 
control samples (5 negative control normal urine samples and one positive control). An 
additional 80µL of chemiluminescent substrate was added to each well immediately prior to 
the plate scan. The total luminescent output over a fixed integration time was measured for 
each well using a M1000 plate reader (Tecan).
Positivity criteria and data analysis
Samples were scored reactive if the mean chemiluminescence from three replicate wells 
exceeded an on-plate cut-off threshold of the mean plus five standard deviations of five 
negative control normal urine samples. Thus, samples with a “ratio relative to cut-off” 
greater than one were scored reactive. All samples were tested twice with those that were 
repeat-reactive, ie reactive in both anlayses considered positive for prion disease. Non-
reactive and single-reactive samples were considered negative.
Conductivity measurements
In order to control for the possibility of dehydration in prion disease patients producing 
higher urine direct detection assay (DDA) signals, an approximation to the concentration 
levels of urine samples was determined by conductivity measurement. Conductivity is 
known to correlate with urine osmolality and specific gravity30;31 and was determined 
using a low volume conductivity meter (Horiba Laqua Twin B-771). Calibration of the 
conductivity meter was performed using a 1.41mS/cm standard solution and the conductivity 
of urine samples determined by taking the mean of three independent measurements from 
three separate aliquots of 100μl of urine sample, washing the electrode with ddH2O between 
readings.
Results
DDA analysis of urine from patients with prion disease
A panel of urine samples obtained from a total of 37 patients with confirmed prion disease 
and 125 controls from both normal individuals and patients with neurological diseases other 
than prion disease were analysed using an adaptation of a previously reported DDA blood 
test for vCJD infection. The samples were tested in groups of 12 with a quality control panel 
on each plate, consisting of five negative normal controls and one positive control. Each 
sample was tested in triplicate wells across two independent runs. An arbitrary ‘cut off’ was 
determined from the mean plus 5 S.D.’s of the panel of five normal samples in the quality 
control panel. A ratio for the mean chemiluminescence of each sample to the plate ‘cut off’ 
was calculated for each sample and if greater than 1 a sample was classified as reactive. 
Only samples repeat reactive in both test runs were scored as positive. Of the 162 blinded 
samples tested, 15 and 22 samples were scored as reactive in the first and second test runs 
respectively (Figure 1), with 10 samples scored repeat reactive across the two test runs. All 
of the 10 positive samples were from patients with prion disease, one from a case of vCJD,

 one from a growth hormone related case of iCJD and eight from patients with sCJD. A 
summary of the major clinical findings in all 37 cases of prion disease is provided in eTable 
1.
There were no clear associations with any aspects of the clinical history, disease progression, 
or investigations. The National Prion Clinic have developed a functionally-orientated rating 
scale to measure CJD disease progression termed the MRC Prion Disease Rating Scale 4. 
The mean MRC Scale was 4.0/20 for positive cases, and 5.0 for negative cases (P=0.57, t-
test). The patient with least disease progression of sCJD had an MRC Scale of 10/20, 
however at present most sCJD in the UK is diagnosed at advanced clinical stages for a 
variety of reasons; we had no samples from any patient with sCJD at earlier disease stages. 
All genotypes at polymorphic codon 129 of the prion protein gene, an important 
susceptibility factor and disease modifier32, were represented in both DDA positive and 
negative cases. Typical investigation findings, including periodic sharp wave complexes on 
EEG, abnormal signal on diffusion weighted MRI brain in the cortex and basal ganglia, and 
abnormal 14-3-3 protein levels in CSF were found in an expected proportion of DDA 
positive and negative cases (eTable 1).
Based on the criteria of a sample being repeat reactive in two independent runs, 10/37 (27%) 
of the prion disease urine samples were identified in the absence of any false positive 
reactions. However, considering sCJD in isolation, sensitivity of detection was 8/20 samples 
or 40% (CI:19-64%) with 100% (CI:97-100%) specificity.
Comparison of the mean DDA results expressed as RRC for the four types of prion disease 
analysed (Figure 2) confirms significantly elevated abnormal PrP levels in both sCJD and 
iCJD with respect to controls (p<0.0001), but with levels in both vCJD and IPD failing to 
achieve statistical significance, possibly due to the low numbers of samples analysed.
Conductivity of urine samples as a measure of concentration
Conductivity, a simplified measure of osmolality which correlates with urine 
concentration30;31, was measured in approximately a third of the samples (n=55), where 
sufficient volume was available. No correlation was observed between urine concentration 
and DDA signals (Figure 3) confirming patient hydration was not the cause of elevated 
abnormal PrP signals in urine.
Discussion
Blood is a commonly used analyte for range of diagnostic and prognostic tests, being readily 
accessible with minimal risk in almost all patients. We have previously reported the 
development and validation of a blood test for vCJD21;26 which despite excellent 
performance characteristics against vCJD was unable to detect infection in the blood of 
patients with sCJD. An accurate diagnosis of sCJD in patients with advanced symptomatic 
disease patients can usually be achieved16 without recourse to molecular diagnostics but the 
ability to diagnose patients much earlier would have obvious benefits, particular with respect 
to early entry into therapeutic trials.

 The ability of disease-associated abnormal PrP to catalyse the conversion of recombinant 
PrP into amyloid conformations has been exploited in the development of amyloid-seeding-
assays capable of detecting the presence of prion disease infection in a variety of tissues and 
fluids18;19;33. However, the detection of sCJD prion infection has been limited to the 
tissues of the central nervous system and cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF). In one study, analysis 
of CSF obtained from patients with sporadic CJD using amyloid seeding has indicated the 
detection limit is sufficient for excellent discrimination of affected individuals from controls 
with a sensitivity of around 90% 34. However, the requirement for CSF limits the 
application of the assay as the collection of such samples is an invasive procedure that is 
generally performed only when significant neurological symptoms and signs are evident.
An alternative to blood as a peripheral analyte, and one that can be readily obtained for 
routine diagnostic use, is urine. Our study has shown for the first time that it is feasible to 
identify sCJD using a urine sample by capture of disease-associated PrP on a stainless steel 
matrix and detection using anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies. Whilst the sensitivity of 
diagnosis is relatively low, at 40%, the high mean signals obtained in the assay suggest this 
could be improved considerably by pre-treatment or processing of large volumes of urine 
prior to assay. It is likely the current diagnostic sensitivity could be significantly improved 
by improvements in the analytic sensitivity of the assay but it is unclear if this could 
approach 100% as there is likely to be variability in the presence and concentration of 
abnormal PrP in the urine of individual patients. The high mean signals observed in the two 
samples from cases of iatrogenic growth-hormone related CJD suggest such an assay may 
also have significant sensitivity to cases of secondary CJD infection, although this will 
require the analysis of larger numbers of samples. The detection of abnormal misfolded 
prion protein in the urine of CJD patients is somewhat unexpected and intriguingly suggests 
other neurodegenerative diseases associated with protein misfolding may have diagnostic 
urine signatures. An unparalleled advantage of urine as an analyte is the easy availability of 
large sample volumes for research which will facilitate the development of protocols for the 
isolation and characterisation of the specific form of abnormal PrP present, leading to 
improved diagnostic sensitivity.
The origin of disease-associated PrP in the urine of sCJD patients is unknown but it is clear 
that urine contains PrPC, largely in a truncated form that carries only a partial 
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor lacking the associated lipid moiety35;36, and 
therefore there is the potential for prion replication in situ as well as accumulation from the 
glomerular filtration of blood. Although urine is normally considered to lack detectable 
protein in the absence of kidney disease, in fact, normal kidney function results in trace 
protein concentrations of between 50-200 µg ml-1, sufficient to result in the accumulation of 
abnormal PrP derived from blood. It is notable that although abnormal PrP is present in 
urine it is not readily detectable in blood. A plausible explanation is the enrichment of 
abnormal PrP by the action of filtration in the kidney to concentrations that are detectable, 
but this could also be explained by active prion replication in the kidney or urinary tract. 
Certainly all the requirements for prion amplification are present; normal PrPC, disease-
associated abnormal PrP and a slightly denaturing environment provided by urea. However it 
is important to note that transmission studies have indicated the potential prion titres in 
native urine are low (<0.38 infectious units ml-1)37 or absent, and there are no reported

 cases of CJD resulting from sexual transmission with the evidence from experimental 
models indicating that this is unlikely to occur38;39. The complex milieu of blood 
contributes to greater difficulties in specifically detecting disease-related signals whereas 
urine is relative ‘clean’ analyte with low background levels of protein which may be 
sufficient to account for the apparent discrepancy alone.
Prion protein has previously been identified in commercially available injectable urine-
derived gonadotropin products that are used to treat infertility in women40 and undescended 
testes in boys41 and are available for illicit use in body building and as performance 
enhancing drugs42. This fact, coupled with the detection of abnormal PrP in the urine of 
vCJD patients25, has raised questions about the safety of such products should the 
purification methods result in the co-purification of prions as is known to have been the case 
for human cadaveric pituitary-derived hormones15. Typically urine is sourced from post-
menopausal women with a median age of over 50 years, an age cohort where sCJD can be 
expected, although exclusion criteria exist for donations, analogous to those in place for 
donating blood. Despite transmission studies indicating the potential prion titres in native 
urine are low37, it is conceivable that commercial purification of hormone products could 
concomitantly enrich for prion infectivity. Our finding, that the urine of sCJD patients 
contains abnormal PrP is consistent with concerns that urine-derived fertility products could 
contain infectious prions as sCJD remains the most common form of prion disease and has a 
uniform world-wide incidence.
Our findings are in marked contrast to those recently reported using the technique of protein 
misfolding by cyclic amplification (PMCA) where a high sensitivity for the detection of 
vCJD infection in urine was observed and yet none of 68 patient samples from sCJD tested 
positive25. A critical limitation to the interpretation of this finding is that the assay 
methodology (PMCA) has never been convincingly demonstrated to detect sCJD and indeed 
no positive controls were included in this study. Parallel CJD strain-dependent differences 
are observed with other assay methods, some of which are attributable to differences in 
peripheral pathogenesis21;22;43;44 but some of which remain unexplained45.
Implications for practice and conclusions
The detection of disease-related prion proteins in the urine of patients with sCJD is the first 
demonstration that sCJD can be diagnosed from urine of any peripheral analyte by 
biochemical means. This offers the possibility of improved early diagnosis of sCJD and also 
the potential precautionary screening of human urine-derived pharmaceuticals.

 Figure 1. Assaying a blind panel of 162 urine samples.
Testing was performed in two independent assays on a blind panel of 162 urine samples 
from patients with diagnoses of; sCJD (orange bars, n=20), vCJD (red bars, n=13), inherited 
prion disease (IPD, pale blue bars, n=2), growth hormone related iatrogenic CJD (iCJD, dark 
blue bars, n=2), healthy normal and neurological disease controls (green bars, n=91 and 
n=34 respectively). Neurological disease controls comprised; Alzheimer’s disease (AD, 
n=21), Huntington’s disease (HD, n=3), fronto-temporal dementia (FTD, n=3), familial 
Alzheimer’s disease (FAD, n=2), early onset dementia (EOD, n=1) and referrals to the 
Nation Prion Clinic determined as non-prion disease (n=4). Runs 1 and 2 represent data

 from the individual assay runs of blind samples. Data are shown as the chemiluminescent 
signal ratio relative to a cut-off determined from the mean + 5 x SD of normal controls (see 
Methods).

 Figure 2. Discrimination of various forms of prion disease from normal and neurological 
controls.
Data shown are the group mean ratios relative to cut-offs (RRC) for both assay runs 
combined for the groups of samples indicated; 91 normal controls, 34 neurological disease 
controls (for details see Figure 1 Legend), 13 vCJD, 20 sCJD, 2 IPD and 2 iCJD. Error bars 
represent the standard error of the mean (SEM). The two tailed p values for comparison of 
control samples to prion disease cohorts support a significant difference for both sCJD and 
iCJD (* p <0.0001).

 Figure 3. Correlation of urine sample DDA values and conductivity.
The conductivities of 55 urine samples were quantified as milliSiemens cm-1 and plotted 
versus the mean of the previously determined RRC values on the y-axis. A Pearson 
correlation co-efficient was calculated as 0.058 for the relationship between the two values 
which was not significantly different from 0 (p=0.68, two tailed t test). The line 
superimposed on the data is the best fit of a linear regression, highlighting the lack of 
correlation with a gradient of 0.002.
