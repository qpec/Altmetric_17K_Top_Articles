Abstract
Microglia survey the brain microenvironment for signals of injury
or infection and are essential for the initiation and resolution of
pathogen- or tissue damage-induced inflammation. Understanding
the mechanism of microglia responses during pathology is hence
vital to promote regenerative responses. Here, we analyzed the
role of purinergic receptor P2X4 (P2X4R) in microglia/macrophages
during autoimmune inflammation. Blockade of P2X4R signaling
exacerbated
clinical
signs
in
the
experimental
autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) model and also favored microglia activa-
tion to a pro-inflammatory phenotype and inhibited myelin
phagocytosis.
Moreover,
P2X4R
blockade
in
microglia
halted
oligodendrocyte differentiation in vitro and remyelination after
lysolecithin-induced demyelination. Conversely, potentiation of
P2X4R signaling by the allosteric modulator ivermectin (IVM)
favored a switch in microglia to an anti-inflammatory phenotype,
potentiated myelin phagocytosis, promoted the remyelination
response, and ameliorated clinical signs of EAE. Our results provide
evidence that P2X4Rs modulate microglia/macrophage inflamma-
tory responses and identify IVM as a potential candidate among
currently used drugs to promote the repair of myelin damage.

Introduction
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the
brain and spinal cord leading to demyelination and neurodegenera-
tion. The clinical disease course usually starts with reversible
episodes of neurological disability (relapsing–remitting MS; RRMS),
which later goes into a progressive stage with irreversible neurologi-
cal decline (secondary progressive MS; SPMS; Dendrou et al, 2015).
Demyelinated lesions, a hallmark of multiple sclerosis, are caused
by immune cell infiltration across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) that
promotes inflammation, demyelination, gliosis, and neuroaxonal
degeneration (Dendrou et al, 2015; Lassmann & Bradl, 2017).
Axonal loss occurs in both the acute and chronic phases of MS and
its
animal
model
experimental
autoimmune
encephalomyelitis
(EAE), and the loss of compensatory central nervous system (CNS)
mechanisms contributes to the transition from RRMS to SPMS (Ran-
sohoff, 2012; Dendrou et al, 2015). Activated microglia and macro-
phages are thought to contribute to neurodegeneration as their
number correlates with the extent of axonal damage in MS lesions
(Bitsch et al, 2000; Rasmussen et al, 2007; Fischer et al, 2013; Vogel
et al, 2013). The activation of microglia/macrophages may repre-
sent one of the initial steps in EAE pathogenesis, preceding and
possibly triggering T-cell development and infiltration of blood-
derived cells (Heppner et al, 2005; Ajami et al, 2011; Goldmann
et al, 2013; Yamasaki et al, 2014; Yoshida et al, 2014). However,
other studies indicate that microglia/macrophage activation counter-
acts pathological processes by providing neurotrophic and immuno-
suppressive factors and by promoting recovery (Kotter et al, 2006;
Miron & Franklin, 2014; Lampron et al, 2015).
Microglia/macrophages are highly heterogeneous immune cells
with a continuous spectrum of activation states (Xue et al, 2014).
The so-called classically activated or pro-inflammatory and the alter-
natively activated or anti-inflammatory microglia/macrophages are

 at the opposite ends of this spectrum (Mosser & Edwards, 2008;
Murray et al, 2014; but see also Ransohoff, 2016). Although such a
classification underestimates the complexity of macrophage/micro-
glia plasticity, the distinction nevertheless provides a useful frame-
work for exploring the diverse functions of the innate immune
system in disease pathogenesis. Anti-inflammatory macrophages
have been shown to play central roles in mediating Th2 immunity,
wound healing, and the suppression of effector T-cell function
(Mosser & Edwards, 2008). In MS, pro-inflammatory microglia exist
in all types of lesions and correlate with axonal damage, whereas
anti-inflammatory microglia are increased in acute active lesions
and in the rim of chronic active lesions where efficient remyelina-
tion occurs (Miron et al, 2013). Anti-inflammatory microglia secrete
anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors that promote oligo-
dendrocyte progenitor differentiation and that protect neurons from
damage (Butovsky et al, 2006; Mikita et al, 2011; Starossom et al,
2012; Miron et al, 2013; Yu et al, 2015). Finally, a block in the pro-
inflammatory-to-anti-inflammatory switch has been hypothesized to
contribute to remyelination failure in chronic inactive MS lesions
(Miron et al, 2013; Sun et al, 2017).
As key immune effector cells of the CNS, surveillant microglia
act as sensor of infection and pathologic damage of the brain, lead-
ing to a rapid plastic process of activation that culminates in the
endocytosis and phagocytosis of damaged tissue. Multiple signals
converge on microglial cells to actively maintain or alter their func-
tional state and orchestrate the specific repertoire of microglial func-
tions. In the absence of pathogens, microglia sense the injury by
recognizing the release of molecules that are normally located inside
the cell, known as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
or “endogenous danger signals” (Di Virgilio, 2007). Recently, ATP
has been characterized as a danger signal implicated in innate and
adaptive
immunity
(Junger,
2011),
leading
to
a
plethora
of
responses in microglia through its interaction with their purinergic
P2 receptors (Domercq et al, 2013). On the basis of their signaling
properties, P2 receptors can be further subdivided into metabotropic
P2Y receptors (P2YRs) that are G-protein-coupled, and ionotropic
P2X receptors (P2XRs) that are nucleotide-gated ion channels
(Domercq et al, 2013). We have previously observed that purinergic
P2X4R is highly expressed in activated microglia in EAE and in
human MS optic nerve samples (Va
´zquez-Villoldo et al, 2014).
Here, we identified P2X4R as a significant regulator of microglia
inflammatory cascade and the resultant repair response after
demyelination.
Results
P2X4R expression is upregulated during EAE
Following peripheral nerve injury, microglia in the spinal dorsal
horn exhibit a reactive phenotype and upregulate expression of a
variety of genes, including purinergic P2x4r (Tsuda et al, 2003;
Beggs et al, 2012). Accordingly, we detected previously an increase
in P2x4r mRNA expression in multiple sclerosis (MS) samples and
at the peak of the immune attack in the acute EAE model (Va
´zquez-
Villoldo et al, 2014). We have further analyzed the time course of
the P2x4r expression in EAE mice immunized with myelin oligoden-
drocyte glycoprotein (MOG). Levels of P2x4r expression were
increased at the peak of the disease and remained elevated during
the recovery phase (30 days; Fig 1A). Interestingly, there was a
strong correlation between P2x4r expression and the neurological
score, both at the peak and at recovery (Fig 1A; r2 = 0.99 and 0.61,
respectively). Previous data have demonstrated that interferon regu-
latory factor 8 (IRF8)–IRF5 transcriptional axis is a critical regulator
for shifting microglia toward a P2X4R+-reactive phenotype (Masuda
et al, 2014). Accordingly, we observed that Irf8 and Irf5 transcrip-
tion factors were upregulated at the peak and recovery phases of the
disease and their expression correlated well with P2x4r expression
(Fig 1B). P2x4r upregulation was also detected in FACS-isolated
microglia (Cd11b+CD45high) in the spinal cord at the EAE recovery
phase (Fig 1C).
P2X4R blockade exacerbates EAE
We then tested the role of P2X4R in EAE pathogenesis in mice
treated daily with P2X4R antagonist TNP-ATP (10 mg/kg) from the
onset of the disease at 10 days postimmunization (dpi). This time
window is coincident with microglia activation, as previously
reported (Ajami et al, 2011), and does not interfere with immune
priming. Microglia die at early stages of EAE induction, and this
population is replenished by infiltrating monocytes, promoting
progression to paralysis (Ajami et al, 2011). Because P2X4R block-
ade was previously demonstrated to prevent LPS-induced microglial
cell death (Va
´zquez-Villoldo et al, 2014), we reasoned that blockade
of microglial cell death by TNP-ATP would prevent replacement by
monocyte and improve clinical signs of EAE. In contrast, blockade
of P2X4R with TNP-ATP exacerbated EAE disease (Fig 2A). Accord-
ingly, the latency of the corticospinal tract was significantly
increased in TNP-ATP-treated mice (Fig 2A), indicative of higher
demyelination. We next stained spinal cord sections at the end of
the experiment for ionized calcium-binding adapter protein 1 (Iba1),
which is a marker commonly used to identify microglia/macro-
phages in the CNS. TNP-ATP-treated mice showed a significant
increase in Iba1+ cells in the white and gray matter of the spinal
cord versus vehicle-treated EAE mice (Fig 2B). The increase was
observed even at the same neurological score (Fig EV1), probably
indicating that the increase in microglia/macrophage number is not
only the consequence of the higher EAE severity after P2X4R
blockade.
We next confirmed the role played by P2X4R in EAE pathogene-
sis using P2X4�/� mice. We first checked whether P2X4R deficiency
could affect microglia and oligodendrocytes in normal conditions.
We did not detect any change in the number or morphology of
Iba1+ cells nor in the number of Olig2+ oligodendrocytes in the
spinal cord of 2-month-old P2X4�/� mice (Appendix Fig S1). Then,
we compared neurological score in WT and P2X4�/� MOG-injected
mice. In accordance with results obtained with TNP-ATP, P2X4�/�
mice showed an exacerbated EAE, higher latency of the corti-
cospinal tract, and an increase in the number of Iba1+ microglia/
macrophage cells (Fig 2C). To further assess that the effect of TNP-
ATP was P2X4R-dependent, we treated P2X4�/� mice with TNP-
ATP from the onset of the disease. TNP-ATP failed to alter the
course of EAE disease in P2X4�/� mice (Fig 2D). All these data con-
firmed the role played by P2X4R in EAE pathogenesis.
During EAE, T cells are primed in the mouse peripheral immune
system before the onset of the clinical signs (Stromnes & Goverman,

 2006), suggesting that treatment with TNP-ATP starting after the
onset of the disease would have no impact on T-cell infiltration. In
order to corroborate this hypothesis, we analyzed immune cell infil-
tration (CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, cd T cells, neutrophils, and
macrophages) in the brain (Fig EV1) and spinal cord (Fig 2E) at the
peak of disease in vehicle- and TNP-ATP-treated mice by flow cytom-
etry in another set of mice. We found similar proportions for all of
CNS-infiltrating CD45+ leukocytes in TNP-ATP- and vehicle-treated
mice at the peak of EAE except for CD8+ T cells in the spinal cord
(Fig 2E) and brain (Fig EV1) which were significantly increased in
TNP-ATP-treated mice. We further assessed the role of P2X4R on T-
cell function directly by stimulating isolated splenocytes in vitro with
anti-CD3/CD28 in the presence or absence of TNP-ATP for 3 days
and then measured proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Further-
more, we determined T-cell cytokine production via intracellular
cytokine staining of PMA/ionomycin-stimulated cells. Importantly,
in vitro assays showed that blockade of P2X4R on lymphocytes did
not alter T-cell proliferation or cytokine production (Fig 2F).
To further exclude the involvement of P2X4R in adaptive
immune system, we performed an additional EAE experiment and
treated mice with TNP-ATP during the priming phase (0–17 dpi).
TNP-ATP treatment did not affect disease development (Fig 3A). At
the peak, we quantified by flow cytometry the immune response in
periphery (spleen and lymph nodes) and in the spinal cord. Treat-
ment with TNP-ATP during the priming phase did not change the
number of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and cd T cells in spleen,
lymph nodes, or the spinal cord (Fig 3B). To further assess the
CD4+ T-cell response, we measured mRNA for Foxp3 and Ror, tran-
scription factors that specify Tregs and Th17, respectively, and Ifng,
signature cytokine for Th1 cells. We did not detect any change in
transcript expression after TNP-ATP treatment (Fig 3C). Finally, to
check whether P2X4R blockage could alter infiltration of T cells
during the immune priming phase, we measured BBB disruption by
PET imaging using a radioligand that enabled tracking of matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP) activity as a marker of early lesions and
ongoing leukocyte infiltration (Gerwien et al, 2016). An increase in
MMP activity was detected in the lumbar spinal cord at the peak of
the disease; however, treatment with TNP-ATP during the immune
priming did not change the MMP-PET signal in EAE (Fig 3D). Alto-
gether, these data suggest that blockade of P2X4R did not interfere
with the efficacy of immunization and the T-cellular immune
response against MOG.
Role of P2X4R on microglia polarization
Since myelin clearance is necessary for remyelination and recovery
(Li et al, 2005; Kotter et al, 2006; Neumann et al, 2009) and phago-
cytosis and remyelination are modulated by microglia/macrophage
polarization (Miron et al, 2013), we hypothesized that P2X4R could
be involved in this process. We first checked the status of micro-
glia/macrophage in TNP-ATP- and vehicle-treated EAE mice. We
performed gene expression profiling from the lumbar spinal cord of
vehicle- and TNP-ATP-treated EAE mice at the peak and recovery
phases (Fig 4A and B). Expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-
inflammatory genes involved in microglia/macrophage activation
was analyzed using a 96.96 Dynamic Array™ integrated fluidic
circuit (Fluidigm). In accordance with previous data showing that
macrophages and microglia showed an intermediate activation
status in MS (Vogel et al, 2013), most pro-inflammatory and anti-
inflammatory genes were significantly increased at the EAE peak
(Fig EV2) and recovery phase (Fig 4B). Blockade of P2X4R with
TNP-ATP did not significantly alter anti-inflammatory gene expres-
sion, but it significantly increased pro-inflammatory gene expression
at the recovery phase (Fig 4B), but not at EAE peak (Fig EV2). A
higher increase in pro-inflammatory gene expression was also
detected on microglia FACS-sorted (Cd11b+CD45high; see gating in
Fig 1C) from EAE P2X4�/� mice versus EAE WT (Fig 4C). Accord-
ingly, we found an increase in iNOS expression in microglia/macro-
phage after EAE in P2X4�/� mice and in TNP-ATP-treated mice
(Fig 4D and E). These data suggest that P2X4R could be influencing
microglia/macrophage activation.
To further analyze the influence of P2X4R on microglia polariza-
tion in vitro, cells were primed with colony-stimulating factors to
differentiate into pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory microglia
according to a previous protocol (Fig 5A; see details in Materials
and Methods) and analyzed by immunocytochemistry using pro-
inflammatory (iNOS) and anti-inflammatory (mannose receptor;
MRC1) markers. Blockade of P2X4R with TNP-ATP induced a
significant increase in iNOS+ cells and a significant reduction in
MRC1+ cells (Fig 5B). Accordingly, qPCR analysis revealed an
increase in pro-inflammatory genes and a decrease in anti-inflam-
matory
genes
after
TNP-ATP
treatment
during
polarization
(Fig 5C). Similar results were obtained in P2X4�/� microglia
(Fig EV3). Altogether, these data suggest that P2X4Rs modulate
microglial polarization.

 Effect of P2X4R on oligodendrocyte differentiation
and myelination
A switch from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory pheno-
type occurs in microglia and peripherally derived macrophages
during remyelination in MS, and this change is essential for efficient
remyelination (Miron et al, 2013). These data led us to the hypothe-
sis that P2X4R blockade in microglia could be indirectly affecting
oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination. We first charac-
terized the expression and function of P2X4R in oligodendrocytes

 and microglia. Double-immunocytochemistry analysis showed that
P2X4R expression is virtually absent from Olig2+ oligodendrocytes
and highly enriched in isolectin B4+ microglial cells in microglia–
oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) mixed cultures (Fig 6A;
Appendix Fig S2). On the contrary, P2X7 receptors are expressed in
both cell populations. The function of P2X4R in microglia and oligo-
dendrocytes was further analyzed by electrophysiology in acute
slices from CXCR3-GFP and PLP-DsRed mice, respectively. When
ATP was applied to whole-cell-clamped microglia at �70 mV, it
elicited a massive inward current (619 � 100 pA; n = 8) that was
significantly reduced by A438079 (10 lM), antagonist of P2X7R
(172 � 69 pA; n = 8; Fig 6B). However, the remaining ATP-evoked
current was virtually abolished in the presence of TNP-ATP
(Fig 6B). These data suggest that P2X7R and P2X4R are the main
contributors to ATP-evoked currents in microglia. In contrast, ATP-
evoked currents in oligodendrocytes (80 � 21 pA) were totally
abolished in the presence of A438079 (Fig 6B), indicating the lack
of functional P2X4R on these cells. To further exclude any direct
role of P2X4R on oligodendrocyte differentiation, we stimulated
culture oligodendrocytes with ATPcS (10 lM, 3 days) at low
concentrations to avoid P2X7R activation. ATPcS did not induce any
change in oligodendrocyte differentiation (Fig EV4). Altogether,
these
results
suggested
that
oligodendrocytes
lack
functional
P2X4Rs.
Next, we analyzed whether microglia P2X4R could play a role
on oligodendrocyte differentiation. To this end, we conditioned
oligodendrocyte culture medium (SATO; see Materials and Meth-
ods) with control, pro-inflammatory, and anti-inflammatory micro-
glia for 24 h and then incubated oligodendrocyte progenitors with
microglia-conditioned media for 3 days (see cartoon in Fig 6C). All
microglia-conditioned media induced an increase in the number of
mature
MBP+
oligodendrocytes
as
compared
to
polarization
factors
alone
(Fig 6C).
However,
anti-inflammatory
microglia
induced a higher increase in oligodendrocyte differentiation, an
effect that was blocked in the presence of TNP-ATP (Fig 6C). Since
BDNF enhances oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination
(Wong et al, 2013) and P2X4R stimulation in microglia has been
linked to BDNF release (Tsuda et al, 2003; Coull et al, 2005; see
also Fig EV4), we analyzed BDNF production in differentially
polarized microglia. Western blot analysis revealed a significant
increase
in
BDNF
production
in
anti-inflammatory
microglia,
which was significantly reduced in the presence of TNP-ATP
(Fig 6D). Accordingly, Bdnf mRNA expression during the recovery
phase of EAE was significantly reduced in the presence of TNP-
ATP, a fact that correlated with the downregulation of Mbp
expression (Fig 6E). Bdnf mRNA was also reduced in FACS-
isolated microglia from control and EAE P2X4�/� mice (Fig EV4).
These data suggested that P2X4R blockade in microglia inhibits
oligodendrocyte differentiation by shifting microglia toward a pro-
inflammatory phenotype, an effect that could impede remyelination.
To assess that possibility, we further checked the impact of P2X4R
on remyelination on the lysolecithin-induced demyelination model
using ex vivo organotypic cerebellar slice culture (Fig 6F), a model
independent of adaptive immune system. Indeed, slices treated with
TNP-ATP (10 lM) during the remyelination phase (7 days) showed
a significant decrease in their remyelination capacity, as revealed by
analyzing MBP expression by Western blot (Fig 6F).
Myelin clearance is modulated by P2X4Rs
Phagocytosis of myelin debris by microglia is essential for an effi-
cient regenerative response (Kotter et al, 2006; Ruckh et al, 2012).
We observed a higher accumulation of disrupted or fragmented
myelin after EAE induction in TNP-ATP-treated mice (Fig 7A) as
well as in P2X4�/� mice (Fig EV5). Fragmented myelin yielded
higher immunoreactivity likely due to additional exposed epitopes
of the MBP antibody. Myelin debris accumulation could be the
result of higher demyelination or a defect on myelin phagocytosis.
Indeed, we observed higher accumulation of myelin debris not
surrounded by microglia phagocytic processes in TNP-ATP-treated
mice (Fig 7A) at the recovery phase. Because of that, we challenged
the hypothesis that these features could be the consequence of a fail-
ure on microglia/macrophage phagocytosis. For that, myelin was
isolated from adult rat whole brain using sucrose gradient (Norton
& Poduslo, 1973), labeled with the dye Alexa 488, and added to
microglia cultures. In order to efficiently clear up myelin, microglia
should internalize myelin and deliver it to lysosomes to degrade it.
We monitored by confocal microscopy myelin endocytosis and
myelin degradation time course. At initial stages, myelin endocyto-
sis (1 h) was significantly increased in anti-inflammatory microglia
(Fig 7B), in accordance with recent data (Healy et al, 2016). Block-
ade of P2X4R with TNP-ATP significantly reduced the anti-inflam-
matory-dependent increase in myelin endocytosis (Fig 7B). We then
checked myelin degradation in the different polarized microglia
populations. After 1-h incubation with Alexa 488-myelin, microglia
were kept in label-free growth medium for up to 6 days in the pres-
ence of polarizing factors. We could not eliminate polarization
factors because microglia activation quickly reverses without them
(unpublished observations). We found that microglia retained Alexa
488-labeled myelin for up to 6 days and only about 30% of

 internalized myelin was degraded in that time in control microglia
(Fig 7C). Anti-inflammatory microglia showed a higher capacity to
degrade myelin at 3 and 6 days, whereas pro-inflammatory micro-
glia degraded myelin less efficiently (Fig 7C). Moreover, P2X4R
blockade by TNP-ATP significantly attenuated the increase on
myelin degradation observed in anti-inflammatory microglia and
exacerbated the deficits on myelin degradation characteristic of pro-
inflammatory microglia (Fig 7D). These results suggest that P2X4R
blockade could contribute to the failure on myelin phagocytosis
necessary prior to regeneration.
P2X4R potentiation ameliorates EAE
We then explored the therapeutic potential of P2X4R potentiation.
Ivermectin (IVM) is an FDA-approved semi-synthetic macrocyclic
lactone used in veterinary and clinical medicine as an anti-parasitic
agent. IVM allosterically modulates both ion conduction and chan-
nel gating of P2X4Rs (Priel & Silberberg, 2004). We first analyzed
the role of P2X4R potentiation in EAE pathogenesis in mice treated
daily with IVM (1 mg/kg) after the onset of the disease (14 dpi).
IVM induced a rapid and significant amelioration of the motor

P2X4R and autoimmune demyelination

 deficits of EAE (Fig 8A) that lead to an improvement in corticospinal
tract function in the recovery phase, as revealed by the decrease in
the latency of corticospinal tract (Fig 8A). These data indicate that
IVM treatment effectively promoted myelin recovery. Accordingly,
IVM
significantly
enhanced
remyelination
in
the
lysolecithin-
induced
demyelination model
in
organotypic
cerebellar slices
(Fig 8B).
Then, we analyzed the effect of IVM on microglial polarization
and phagocytosis in vitro. IVM (3 lM) induced a significant increase
in polarization to an anti-inflammatory phenotype (Fig 8C). Accord-
ingly, qPCR analysis revealed a decrease in pro-inflammatory genes
and an increase in anti-inflammatory genes after IVM treatment
during polarization (Fig 8D). Finally, we analyzed the effect of IVM
on myelin phagocytosis. We did not detect a potentiation of myelin
endocytosis (1 h) in anti-inflammatory microglia, perhaps because
myelin endocytosis capacity is already saturated. However, myelin
endocytosis was significantly increased in pro-inflammatory micro-
glia and even in control microglia in the presence of IVM (Fig 8E).
Regarding myelin degradation, long-term treatment with ivermectin
potentiated myelin degradation in control (Fig EV5), pro-inflamma-
tory, and anti-inflammatory microglia (Fig 8F). The effect of IVM in
myelin phagocytosis was absent in P2X4�/� microglia (Fig EV5).
Previous studies have described P2X4R to be located intracellularly
in late endosomes and lysosome membranes where they form
functional ATP-activated cation channels regulated by luminal ATP
in a pH-dependent manner (Huang et al, 2014). We observed that
IVM induced lysosome fusion, an effect dependent on P2X4R
(Fig EV5). Because fusion of lysosomes with late endosomes gener-
ates acidic endolysosomes with high cathepsin activity for phago-
cytic
degradation,
we
then
measured
intralysosomal
pH
in
microglia. Anti-inflammatory microglia showed an acidic shift of
lysosomes, which correlates with its higher phagocytic capacity.
Moreover, IVM treatment (3 lM, 16 h) induced a significant acidifi-
cation of lysosomes (Fig EV5). Altogether, data suggested that
P2X4R potentiation by IVM could favor microglia switch necessary
to efficient remyelination.
The therapeutic potential of ivermectin in MS could be compro-
mised by its possible influence in neuropathic pain. Thus, a recent
study reported the anti-allodynic effect of a novel P2X4R antagonist
in mice with traumatic nerve damage, although the antagonist did
not affect acute nociceptive pain and motor function (Matsumura
et al, 2016). We therefore measured the effects of IVM in mechani-
cal allodynia at different stages of EAE before the appearance of
severe motor deficits. Withdrawal thresholds were significantly
diminished in both vehicle- and IVM-treated mice at EAE onset and
before EAE peak relative to baseline responses, but there were no
significant differences between the two cohorts at any stage
(Fig 8G).
Discussion
Brain injury induces an upregulation of P2X4R and shifts microglia
toward a P2X4R-expressing reactive state through an IRF8–IRF5
transcriptional axis (Beggs et al, 2012). In the present study, we
showed that IRF8–IRF5–P2X4R is upregulated in the peak and recov-
ery phases of EAE. Moreover, we demonstrated that blockade of
P2X4R exacerbates EAE, whereas potentiation with IVM ameliorates
this experimental disease. Mechanistically, P2X4 receptor signaling
potentiation in microglia/macrophages favors a switch to an anti-
inflammatory phenotype that, by secreting factors such as BDNF
and increasing myelin phagocytosis, leads to higher remyelination.
Altogether, data here suggest that P2X4R upregulation could be a
marker of the neuroinflammatory response in MS and that potentia-
tion of signaling by P2X4R has therapeutic potential to treat
demyelinating disorders.
Microglial P2X4R upregulation through IRF8–IRF5 transcription
factors, the P2X4R+ state of microglia, seems to be common in most
acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases associated with
inflammation (reviewed in Domercq et al, 2013). IRF5 drives de
novo expression of P2X4R by directly binding to the promoter region
(Masuda et al, 2014). Here, we showed that Irf5, Irf8, and P2x4r
mRNA expression is increased and is correlated at the peak as well
as in the recovery phase of the EAE. Recent genome-wide SNP anal-
ysis has identified IRF8 as a susceptibility factor for multiple sclero-
sis (De Jager et al, 2009). In addition, genetic polymorphisms in
human IRF5 that lead to the expression of various unique isoforms
or higher expression of Irf5 mRNA have been linked to autoimmune
diseases, including MS (Kristjansdottir et al, 2008). IRF5 and IRF8
play a key role in the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines,

 function (Appendix Fig S3). However, the risk factor for MS of IRF5
and IRF8 contrasts with the protective role described here of P2X4R.
Thus, although this receptor is activated during pro-inflammatory
polarization, it is conceivable that P2X4R overexpression may help
to resolve or counterbalance the inflammatory reaction by priming a
subsequent anti-inflammatory response. Indeed, the presence of
pro-inflammatory macrophages is a prerequisite for the successive
emergence of anti-inflammatory macrophages and tissue homeosta-
sis during wound healing and Listeria monocytogenes infections
(Chazaud, 2014; Bleriot et al, 2015).
Antigen-presenting cells, including CNS microglia and perivas-
cular macrophages, play pivotal roles in initiating Th17-cell devel-
opment and transmigration through the BBB leading to EAE
(Bartholoma
¨us et al, 2009; Goldmann et al, 2013; Xiao et al,
2013; Yoshida et al, 2014). However, our results did not substan-
tiate a direct (T-cell-mediated) or indirect (APC-dependent) role of
P2X4R for the development of T-cell response and recruitment to
the CNS, excluding any role of P2X4R on the onset of EAE
disease. A role of P2X4R in recovery is also supported by the
beneficial/detrimental effect of P2X4R manipulation in remyelina-
tion in LPC-treated slices, a model lacking adaptive immune
activation.
The role of inflammation in promoting neural repair is gaining
increasing recognition. Products of macrophages as well as of
microglia, their CNS counterparts, facilitate the regeneration of
axons (David et al, 1990; Yin et al, 2006) and promote remyelina-
tion in animal models of demyelination as their deficiency retards
the process of remyelination (Kotter et al, 2005; Kondo et al, 2011;
Miron et al, 2013; Sun et al, 2017; Cantuti-Castelvetri et al, 2018).
However, the innate immune system capacity to restore myelina-
tion in the context of MS depends on microglia/macrophage
polarization state. Thus, pro-inflammatory microglia/macrophage
deactivation suppresses EAE acute phase (Starossom et al, 2012),
whereas microglia/macrophage polarization to an anti-inflamma-
tory phenotype is essential for efficient remyelination later on
(Butovsky et al, 2006; Miron et al, 2013; Sun et al, 2017). Thus, a
switch from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory dominant
polarization of microglia/macrophage is critical in the repair
process, and therefore, manipulating polarization phenotypes of
microglia/macrophage might be a promising therapeutic strategy
for treating MS. We here demonstrate that blocking P2X4R exacer-
bated a switch to a pro-inflammatory phenotype and increased
neurological deterioration in the recovery phase, whereas its
potentiation with IVM increased anti-inflammatory polarization
and ameliorated clinical signs. Resident microglia and monocytes
contribute differentially to EAE induction (Ajami et al, 2011;
Yamasaki et al, 2014), whereas few studies have addressed their
specific contribution to remyelination (Lampron et al, 2015). The
experiments described in this paper do not allow us to discrimi-
nate between microglia and monocyte-derived macrophages, and
further experiments are necessary to define the role played by
P2X4R in the two cell populations.
The benefits of microglia/macrophage may be attributed to being
required in clearing myelin debris after a demyelinating episode
(Kotter et al, 2006; Neumann et al, 2009; Lampron et al, 2015;
Cantuti-Castelvetri et al, 2018), as well as their release of a variety
of growth factors into the injured CNS that favor oligodendrocyte
differentiation (Miron et al, 2013). Phagocytosis of myelin is more
robust in anti-inflammatory microglia than in pro-inflammatory
microglia (Durafourt et al, 2012; Healy et al, 2016). We also
detected an increase in myelin endocytosis as well as in the subse-
quent myelin degradation in anti-inflammatory microglia, and a
decrease in pro-inflammatory microglia. Moreover, we demon-
strated here that P2X4R blockade or potentiation modulates the
effect of polarization on phagocytosis. However, the opposite inter-
pretation is also possible. Thus, phagocytosis of myelin controls
microglia/macrophage inflammatory response (Kroner et al, 2014).
Recently, it has been described that phagocytosis of myelin in aged
microglia/macrophages after demyelination results in cholesterol
accumulation in these cells, leading to a maladaptive inflammatory
response with inflammasome activation that impairs remyelination
(Cantuti-Castelvetri et al, 2018).
Our data showed that IVM also potentiates myelin engulfment
and
degradation
in
control
microglia.
Previous
studies
have
described that P2X4R-mediated endolysosomal Ca2+ release is
involved in vacuolation and endolysosomal membrane fusion with
lysosomes (Cao et al, 2015) which could control phagocytosis. In
accordance, we observed that P2X4R induces endosome–lysosome
fusion and lysosome pH acidification, a pivotal step for enzymatic
degradation of material delivered by phagocytic pathways. Thus, it
is possible that these strategically located P2X4Rs could directly
modulate myelin phagocytosis. Whether IVM potentiation of phago-
cytosis is the mechanism controlling microglia polarization or the
opposite requires further studies.
On the other hand, previous data on literature demonstrated
that OPC differentiation and myelination in the CNS are controlled
by highly regulated sequences of molecular interactions with
neurotransmitters released by axons, growth factors, neuregulins,
integrins, and cell adhesion molecules. Among all, it is well known
that BDNF enhances oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelina-
tion (Wong et al, 2013). A source of BDNF promoting oligodendro-
genesis after white matter ischemic insults is astrocytes (Miyamoto

P2X4R and autoimmune demyelination
Alazne Zabala et al

 et al, 2015). However, microglia are also another important source
of BDNF in physiological conditions and after injury (Dougherty
et al, 2000; Parkhurst et al, 2013), and microglia P2X4R activation
has been linked to BDNF release, causing tactile allodynia (Ferrini
et al, 2013). We showed here that BDNF production by microglia
was increased in anti-inflammatory microglia, an effect signifi-
cantly reduced by TNP-ATP treatment. In addition, Mbp levels
after EAE strongly correlated with Bdnf levels and were dramati-
cally reduced in the recovery phase of EAE after TNP-ATP treat-
ment. These data are only correlative, so we not exclude the role
of other factors secreted by microglia after P2X4R activation to
EAE remyelination.
Manipulating innate immune system to promote repair might
be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating MS. The results of
our study identify P2X4R as a key modulator of microglia/macro-
phage polarization and support the use of IVM to potentiate a
microglia/macrophage switch that favors remyelination in MS. It is
important to note that anti-helminthic host responses are based on
anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization (Satoh et al, 2010),
and thus, it is conceivable that the mechanism described here
could be added to the IVM therapeutic effects against helminths.
The fact that IVM is already used as an anti-parasitic agent in
humans will facilitate challenging this drug in clinical trials in that
demyelinating disease.
Materials and Methods
Animals
All experiments were performed according to the procedures
approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of the Basque
Country (UPV/EHU). Animals were handled in accordance with
the European Communities Council Directive. Mice were kept
under
conventional
housing
conditions
(22 � 2°C,
55 � 10%
humidity, and 12-h day/night cycle) at the University of the
Basque Country animal facilities. All possible efforts were made
to minimize animal suffering and the number of animals used.
Generation of P2X4�/� mice was described previously (Sim et al,
2006).
Cell cultures
Microglia and OPC culture
Primary mixed glial cultures were prepared from the cerebral cortex
of neonatal rats and mice (P0–P2) as previously described (Domercq
et al, 2007). After 10–15 days in culture, microglia were isolated by
mechanical
shaking
(400 rpm,
1 h)
as
previously
described
(Domercq et al, 2007). The remaining oligodendrocyte progenitor
cells (OPCs) present on the top of the confluent monolayer of astro-
cytes in the flasks were dislodged by shaking flasks overnight at
400 rpm. The final cell suspension was collected, centrifuged, and
resuspended in a chemically defined high-glucose Dulbecco’s modi-
fied Eagle’s medium supplemented with 100 lg/ml transferrin,
60 ng/ml progesterone, 40 ng/ml sodium selenite, 5 lg/ml insulin,
16 lg/ml putrescine, and 100 lg/ml BSA.
Microglial cells were polarized according to previous protocols
(Durafourt et al, 2012) with minor modifications. To generate pro-
inflammatory microglia, cells were treated with GM-CSF (5 ng/ml;
Peprotech)
for
5 days
followed
by 24-h
treatment
with
LPS
(10 ng/ml) and IFNc (20 ng/ml; Peprotech). To generate anti-
inflammatory microglia, cells were treated with M-CSF (20 ng/ml;
Peprotech) for 5 days followed by 24-h treatment with
IL-4
(20 ng/ml; Peprotech) and IL-13 (50 ng/ml; Peprotech). Microglia-
conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged (270 g, 5 min).
OPCs were treated with microglia-conditioned medium for 3 days at
37°C. Polarizing factors alone were directly applied to OPCs as a
control. Calcium measurements were performed at 37°C using Fluo-
4 calcium indicator in a Leica LCS SP2 AOBS confocal microscope.
T cells
Mouse splenocytes were obtained by mashing the disintegrated
organs through cell strainers into PBS. Cell suspension was freed
from erythrocytes by incubation with ACK lysing buffer (155 mM
NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3, 100 lM EDTA, pH ~7.2). Cytokine measure-
ment and cell proliferation assay are described in Appendix.
Cerebellar organotypic cultures
Cultures were prepared from cerebellar sections of P5–P7 Sprague
Dawley rat pups according to previously described procedures
(Cavaliere et al, 2010). Slices (350 lm) were maintained in medium

 consisting in 50% basal medium with Earle’s salt, 25% HBSS, 25%
inactivated horse serum, 5 mg/ml glucose (Panreac), 0.25 mM
L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C in an atmosphere of humidified
5% CO2. Demyelination was induced at 14 days in vitro by lysole-
cithin (0.5 mg/ml; 17 h). Slices were allowed to remyelinate during
1 week, and remyelination was analyzed by Western blot using
antibodies to MBP (#SMI-99P; Covance).
EAE induction
EAE was induced in 8- to 10-week-old female P2X4�/� (backcrossed
for > 15 generations onto C57Bl/6 background; Sim et al, 2006) and
their wild-type littermate C57Bl/6 mice by subcutaneous immuniza-
tion with 300 ll of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35–55
(MOG; 200 lg; Sigma) in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant supple-
mented with 8 mg/ml Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra. Pertussis
toxin (500 ng; Sigma) was injected on the day of immunization and
again 2 days later. Motor function was recorded daily and scored
from 0 to 8 following standard scales (Matute et al, 2007). Mice
were daily treated with TNP-ATP (10 mg/kg, i.p.; Tocris), iver-
mectin (1 mg/kg, i.p.; Sigma), or vehicle from EAE onset to the end
of the experiment except for the experiments designed to check the
effect of TNP-ATP on immune priming, where TNP-ATP was admin-
istered daily from day 0 to EAE peak. All mice were randomized
before the immunization and before the appearance of EAE symp-
toms. Conduction velocity of the corticospinal tract was assessed at
the end of the experiment in anesthetized mice with tribro-
moethanol (240 mg/kg, i.p.; Sigma) using stimulatory and recording
electrodes placed in the primary motor cortex and in the vertebral
canal at the L2 level, respectively (Matute et al, 2007). Neurological
score and latency recording were undertaken by readers blinded to
the study. Disease phases were assigned according to days after
onset as follows: peak, 6–10 days after onset; and recovery, score
stabilized and 18–30 days after onset.
Pain assessment
Mechanical allodynia was assessed by an e-VF Electronic von Frey
aesthesiometer (Ugo Basile SRL) at different stages of EAE: before
immunization, EAE preonset (5 dpi), onset (10–11 dpi), and before
peak (15 dpi). Mice, placed upon an elevated wire mesh surrounded
by a Perspex box, were exposed to increasing mechanical pressure
to the plantar hind paw through a metal filament. Withdrawal
threshold was
measured
automatically
from
the
initiation
of
mechanical stimulus to withdrawal of the paw three times in both
left and right hind paws separated by at least 10 min between each
stimulus. Mean results for each animal were calculated.
Immunochemistry
Cells were fixed in 4% PFA in PBS for 20 min and processed for
conventional immunocytochemistry. For tissue, adult mice were
deeply anesthetized with chloral hydrate (500 mg/kg, i.p.) and tran-
scardially perfused with 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4,
followed by 4% PFA in the same buffer. Antibodies used are
described in Appendix.
Images were acquired using a Leica TCS STED SP8 confocal
microscope or a Zeiss AxioVision microscope with the same settings
for all samples within one experimental group. Olig2+ cells in corpus
callosum and in longitudinal sections of spinal cord and Iba1+ cells
in longitudinal sections of spinal cord were counted blindly using a
40× objective in an AxioVision microscopy (Zeiss). At least four dif-
ferent fields from three slices per animal were counted from each
mouse. To quantify microglia polarization, immunoreactivity of
iNOS and MRC1 was calculated with the ImageJ software (NIH) and
normalized to the number of cells (eight fields per coverslip from at
least four different experiments performed in triplicate). To analyze
the effect on OPC differentiation, MBP+ cells were counted and the
results were expressed in percentage versus total cells (15 fields per
coverslip were analyzed by two observers from n = 3 different exper-
iments performed in triplicate). To quantify microglia and oligoden-
drocyte expression of P2X receptors, regions of interest (ROIs) were
generated with ImageJ software (NIH) in IB4+ and Olig2+ cells (12–
15 cells per culture from three independent experiments).
Western blot
Total protein was extracted from microglia by scraping the cells in
SDS/sample buffer. Tissue from cerebellar organotypic slices was
directly heated at 100°C in sample buffer (7 min). Samples were
loaded and size-separated by electrophoresis using Criterion TGX
Precast 12% gels and transferred to Trans-Blot Turbo Midi PVDF
Transfer Packs (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA). Membranes were blocked
in 5% skimmed milk and 5% serum in Tris-buffered saline/0.05%
Tween-20 (TBS-T) and proteins detected by specific primary anti-
bodies to BDNF (#sc-547, 1:200; Santa Cruz), to MBP (#SMI-99P,
1:2,000, Covance), to GAPDH (#MAB374, 1:2,000; Millipore), and to
b-actin (#A2066, 1:1,000; Sigma), followed by secondary peroxi-
dase-coupled goat anti-rabbit antibodies (#A6154, 1:2,000; Sigma)
or sheep anti-mouse antibodies (#A6782, 1:2,000; Sigma). After
washing, blots were developed using an enhanced chemilumines-
cence detection kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(SuperSignal West Dura or Femto, Pierce). Images were acquired
with a ChemiDoc MP system (Bio-Rad) and quantified using ImageJ
software. Values of BDNF and MBP were normalized to correspond-
ing b-actin and GAPDH signal, respectively.
Myelin phagocytosis and lysosomal pH measurement
Rat and mouse myelin was isolated as previously described (Norton
& Poduslo, 1973). Briefly, brain was mechanically homogenized in
0.32 M sucrose and subjected to repeated sucrose gradient centrifu-
gation and osmotic shocks to separate myelin from other cellular
components. Myelin was incubated with Alexa 488-NHS dye (A2000
Life Technologies) for 1 h 45 min at RT in PBS (pH 8). Dyed myelin
was dialyzed for removing dye excess, resuspended in PBS (pH
7.4), vortexed for 60 s for fragmentation in homogeneous size
aggregates, and added to microglia culture medium (1:100 dilution).
To evaluate myelin endocytosis, microglia were incubated with
Alexa 488-NHS-labeled myelin for 1 h at 37°C, rinsed, and fixed. To
evaluate myelin degradation, cells were subsequently chased at 3
and 6 days for rat microglia and at 3 days for mouse microglia. Cells
were fixed with 4% PFA and stained using antibodies to Iba1 (#019-
19741, 1:500; Wako) and Hoechst 33258. Myelin was quantified on
Iba1+ cells using ImageJ on individual microglial cells outlined with
the Iba1 immunostaining as the defining parameter for the ROIs (at

 least 50 cells were analyzed in each experiment). Identical acquisi-
tion parameters were used for image capture of individual experi-
ments.
The measurement of lysosomal/endosomal pH by confocal
microscopy is based on the use of the ratio of the pH-sensitive fluo-
rescein fluorescence to pH-insensitive rhodamine fluorescence as
previously described (Majumdar et al, 2007). The same dye was
used to measure lysosome area. Briefly, cells were incubated for
16 h with 5 mg/ml dextran conjugated to both fluorescein and
rhodamine (70,000 mol. wt.; ThermoFisher), washed thoroughly,
and then further incubated for 2 h to chase dextran into lysosomes.
Cells were then examined by confocal imaging at 37°C. Lysosome
fluorescence and lysosome area were quantified in defined ROIs
corresponding to individual lysosomes using Fiji software. For pH
measurements, the ratio of fluorescein to rhodamine fluorescence
was determined. For all experimental sets, cross-talk of the fluo-
rophores was negligible. Calibration curves were generated after fix-
ing and equilibrating the fluorescein–rhodamine–dextran-loaded
cells to a range of buffer pH values. We quantified about 40 ROIs
per field (63× photographs) from at least 10 fields per condition in
two independent experiments performed in duplicate.
Electrophysiology
Cortical slices (300 lm thick) were prepared from the brain of P15–
P20 PLP-DsRed and CXCR3-GFP mice to record oligodendrocytes and
microglia, respectively. Slices were obtained in ice-cold solution
containing (in mM): 215 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO3, 1.6 NaH2PO4,
1 CaCl2, 4 MgCl2, 4 MgSO4, 20 glucose, and 1.3 ascorbic acid bubbled
with 95% O2/5% CO2, pH 7.4. Slices were then stored for at least 1 h
at 32°C in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) that contained (in mM)
124 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 NaHCO3, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 1.25 CaCl2, 2.6 MgCl2,
and 10 glucose. Standard whole-cell recordings of microglia and
oligodendrocytes (Vh = �70 mV) were performed at 37°C on a Leica
microscope (Leica DM LFSA) using the MultiClamp 700B amplifier
(Axon). Recordings were low-pass-filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at
5 kHz, and stored as data files on a computer using the pClamp 8.2
program (Axon Instruments, CA) for later analysis. The extracellular
bath solution contained (in mM) 124 NaCl, 26 NaHCO3, 1 NaH2PO4,
2.5 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 2.5 CaCl2, and 10 glucose, bubbled with 95% O2/
5% CO2, pH 7.4. ATP was applied through a 5242 microinjector
(Eppendorf) in divalent cation-free extracellular solutions to maxi-
mize purinergic currents. Patch clamp pipettes (3–5 MΩ) were filled
with a solution containing (in mM) 135 KCl, 4 NaCl, 0.7 CaCl2, 4
MgATP, 10 HEPES, 10 BAPTA, and 0.5 Na2-GTP, pH 7.3.
FACS
For flow cytometric analyses, cells were stained in FACS buffer
containing 0.1% BSA and 1 mM EDTA with fluorochrome-conju-
gated monoclonal antibodies. Details about antibodies used are
described in Appendix. Stained cells were washed and resuspended
in 300 ll FACS buffer. Cells were measured using a BD LSRFortessa,
and data were analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star).
For
microglia
sorting,
samples
were
sorted
using
CD11b
(#101205, 1:100; Biolegend), CD45 (#103134, 1:100; Biolegend),
Ly6C (#128012, 1:100; Biolegend), Ly6G (#127622, 1:100; Biole-
gend), and CCR2 (#FAB5538, 1:100; R&D Systems) to distinguish
between resident microglia (CD11b+/CD45low) and invading macro-
phages (CD11b+/CD45high; Szulzewsky et al, 2015). Cells were
sorted using a FACSAria IIIu (BD Bioscience).
qPCR and gene expression profiling
Total RNA from control and EAE lumbar spinal cords and from
microglia cultures was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA from sorted microglia was
isolated using RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen). Subsequently, cDNA
synthesis was conducted using SuperScript III retrotranscriptase
(200 U/ll; Invitrogen) or AffinityScript Multiple Temperature cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Agilent Technologies Inc.) and random hexamers as
primers (Promega). cDNA from EAE experiments was processed via
Fluidigm real-time PCR analysis and GenEx software, and the results
were depicted as relative gene expression according to the DDCq
method (2�DDCt) and expressed in base 2 logarithmic scale. For
in vitro experiments, real-time quantitative PCRs were performed
with SYBR Green using a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection
System as described previously (Domercq et al, 2016).
PET imaging
[18F]BR-351, the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor used for PET
imaging (18F-MMPi), was prepared from its tosylate precursor
according to a previously reported procedure (Wagner et al, 2011)
using a TRACERlab FXFN synthesis module (GE Healthcare). Radio-
chemical yields (non-decay-corrected) were in the range 12–16%,
and radiochemical purity was always > 95% at the time of injection.
Naı
¨ve control mice and EAE mice � TNP-ATP (treatment from day 0
to day 17 postimmunization) at the peak of the EAE were subjected
to lPET imaging using the radiotracer [18F]BR-351 for assessment of
MMP activity. Thirty-minute static lPET scans were acquired for
100 min after intravenous injection of 10 MBq. CT acquisitions were
performed to provide anatomical information and the attenuation
map for reconstruction using 2DOSEM. PET images were co-regis-
tered to the anatomical data of the CT of the same mouse, and
volumes of interest (VOIs) were manually drawn in the inner part of
the brain and spinal cord. The PET signal was expressed as percent-
age of injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g).
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean � s.e.m. with sample size and number
of repeats indicated in the figure legends. Comparisons between two
groups were analyzed using paired Student’s two-tailed t-test for data
coming from in vitro experiments and unpaired Student’s two-tailed
t-test for data coming from in vivo experiments, except in MOG-EAE
experiments where statistical significance in neurological score was
determined by Mann–Whitney U-test. Comparisons among multiple
groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison tests for post hoc
analysis. Statistical significance was considered at P < 0.05.
Study approval
Organotypic cultures, primary cultures, electrophysiology protocols,
and EAE experiments in wild-type or P2X4�/� mice were approved

The paper explained
Problem
Promoting endogenous remyelination represents an attractive target
for regeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS). A major component of
remyelination in the CNS is a robust innate immune response.
Although microglia and macrophages are implicated in CNS autoim-
mune disease via secretion of toxic molecules and antigen presenta-
tion
to
cytotoxic
lymphocytes,
they
also
exhibit
regenerative
properties through the phagocytosis of myelin debris and secretion of
growth
and
neurotrophic
factors
that
promote
oligodendrocyte
progenitors differentiation and myelination. Thus, identifying molecu-
lar targets that could switch microglia/macrophage activation/polar-
ization could be therapeutically relevant. We have here analyzed the
role of P2X4 receptor, as we detected previously P2X4R+ reactive
microglia/macrophages to be present in EAE as well as in MS demyeli-
nating lesions.
Results
To study the role played by P2X4R in MS pathophysiology, we tested
the effects of pharmacological or genetic blocking of P2X4 as well as
the effect of the allosteric modulator ivermectin, an enhancer of
P2X4R function, in the experimental autoimmune encephalitis mice
(EAE), a chronic animal model of MS. Treating mice with TNP-ATP, an
antagonist of P2X4R, or knockout for the P2X4 gene showed exacer-
bated EAE neurological symptoms, whereas administration of iver-
mectin, an enhancer of P2X4R function, ameliorated neurological
damage. Detailed FACS immune analysis in combination with PET
imaging demonstrated that P2X4R modulation did not interfere with
the efficacy of immunization and the cellular adaptive immune
response against MOG. Rather, the beneficial effect of ivermectin,
administered after the onset of the disease, was clear in the recovery
phase and was associated with a switch in microglia polarization that
favors myelin phagocytosis and remyelination. This conclusion is also
supported by the results obtained in another model of MS, which lack
the adaptive immune activation, the lysolecithin-induced demyelina-
tion. Thus, we propose that ivermectin could have potential benefit to
promote remyelination in MS lesions.
Impact
Available therapies for MS include immunomodulators that reduce
relapses, but they do not halt the neuronal damage and the remyeli-
nation. Understanding chronic progression of MS, more than autoim-
mune-driven relapses, and understanding the disease pathways that
allow recovery in the animal models is certainly relevant to design
alternative interventions to treat specifically primary and secondary
progressive MS.
