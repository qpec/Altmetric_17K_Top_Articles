World TB Day — March 24, 2018
World TB Day is recognized each year on March 24, 
commemorating the date in 1882 when Dr. Robert Koch 
announced his discovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 
the bacillus that causes tuberculosis (TB). World TB Day 
is an opportunity to raise awareness about TB and the 
measures needed to tackle this devastating disease. The 
U.S. theme for World TB Day 2018, “Wanted: leaders for 
a TB-free United States. We can make history. End TB” 
highlights the importance of engaging and empowering 
public health partners, clinicians, and communities in 
efforts to eliminate TB.
A study reported in this issue of MMWR found that in 
2017, a provisional total of 9,093 TB cases were reported 
in the United States (rate of 2.8 cases per 100,000 persons) 
(1), a decrease from the 2016 case count and rate and 
the lowest rate and number of TB cases on record since 
reporting began in 1953. However, increased diagnosis 
and treatment of latent TB infection is important for 
eliminating TB in the United States (2).
CDC is working to eliminate TB in the United States 
by engaging new domestic and global partners, strength-
ening control of TB disease, and expanding testing and 
treatment of latent TB infection. Additional information 
about World TB Day and CDC’s TB elimination activities 
is available online (https://www.cdc.gov/tb/worldtbday).

In 2017, a total of 9,093 new cases of tuberculosis (TB) 
were provisionally* reported in the United States, representing 
an incidence rate of 2.8 cases per 100,000 population. The 
case count decreased by 1.8% from 2016 to 2017, and the 
rate declined by 2.5% over the same period. These decreases 
are consistent with the slight decline in TB seen over the 
past several years (1). This report summarizes provisional TB 
surveillance data reported to CDC’s National Tuberculosis 
Surveillance System for 2017 and in the last decade. The rate

verified as of February 12, 2018. Updated data will be available in CDC’s annual 
TB surveillance report later this year.

of TB among non–U.S.-born persons in 2017 was 15 times 
the rate among U.S.-born persons. Among non–U.S.-born 
persons, the highest TB rate among all racial/ethnic groups 
was among Asians (27.0 per 100,000 persons), followed by 
non-Hispanic blacks (blacks; 22.0). Among U.S.-born persons, 
most TB cases were reported among blacks (37.1%), followed 
by non-Hispanic whites (whites; 29.5%). Previous studies 
have shown that the majority of TB cases in the United States 
are attributed to reactivation of latent TB infection (LTBI) 
(2). Ongoing efforts to prevent TB transmission and disease 
in the United States remain important to continued progress 
toward TB elimination. Testing and treatment of populations 
most at risk for TB disease and LTBI, including persons born 
in countries with high TB prevalence and persons in high-risk 
congregate settings (3), are major components of this effort.
Health departments in the 50 states and the District of 
Columbia electronically report to CDC verified TB cases 
that meet the CDC and Council of State and Territorial 
Epidemiologists’ surveillance case definition.† Reported data 
include the patient’s country of birth, self-identified race and 
ethnicity (i.e., Hispanic or non-Hispanic), human immuno-
deficiency virus (HIV) status, drug-susceptibility test results,

uberculosis (RVCT) Instruction 
Manual. https://www.cdc.gov/tb/programs/rvct/instructionmanual.pdf.
and information on risk factors, including homelessness§ and 
residence in a congregate setting (i.e., long-term care or cor-
rectional facility). Persons of Hispanic ethnicity might be of 
any race; non-Hispanic persons are categorized as Asian, black, 
white, American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or 
other Pacific Islander, or of multiple races. A U.S.-born person 
is defined as a person who was eligible for U.S. citizenship 
at birth, regardless of the actual place of birth. CDC calcu-
lates overall national and state TB rates using U.S. Census 
Bureau population estimates and by racial/ethnic group and 
national origin using population denominators from the 
bureau’s Current Population Survey.¶ Yearly case counts and 
rates were compared overall and by origin of birth and race/
ethnicity. Annual percent changes between years were cal-
culated to compare differences in case counts and rates over 
time. Drug-susceptibility testing results were reported from 
§ Homelessness is defined as a lack of fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime 
residence at any time during the 12 months preceding TB diagnostic evaluation 
and a primary nighttime residence that is either a shelter, an institution that 
provides temporary residence for persons intended to be institutionalized, or 
a public place not designated for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping 
accommodation for human beings. A homeless person may also be defined as 
a person without a home or in an unstable housing situation. Pages 85–86,

culture-confirmed cases in 2016, the most recent year for 
which complete TB drug-susceptibility data were available.
State-specific TB rates (cases per 100,000 persons) ranged 
from 0.3 in Montana to 8.1 in Hawaii (Table 1) with a median 
state TB rate of 1.8. As has been the case for the past decade, 
four states (California, Florida, New York, and Texas) reported 
half of the total TB cases in the United States in 2017. The 
annual percent change in rate in recent years has slowed from 
an average decline of 5.3% during 2010–2013 to an average 
decline of 2.0% during 2014–2017. In 2017, a total of 6,346 
(69.8%) of U.S. TB cases occurred among non–U.S.-born 
persons, 2,698 (29.7%) cases occurred among U.S.-born per-
sons, and 49 (0.5%) occurred among persons with no reported 
national origin. The TB rate among non–U.S.-born persons 
(14.6) was 15 times the rate among U.S.-born persons (1.0) 
(Figure). Although these rates represent decreases among both 
groups in 2017 compared with 2016, the rate among U.S.-born 
persons declined 7.0%, whereas that among non–U.S.-born 
persons declined 0.9%.
Among non–U.S.-born persons, the highest TB rate among 
all racial/ethnic groups occurred among Asians (27.0 per 
100,000 persons), followed by blacks (22.0) (Table 2). As in 
previous years, in 2017, the top five countries of birth of non–
U.S.-born persons with TB were Mexico (1,204; 19.0% of all 
non–U.S.-born persons with TB), Philippines (783; 12.3%), 
India (595; 9.4%), Vietnam (526; 8.3%), and China (400; 
6.3%). Persons who received a diagnosis of TB ≥10 years after 
arriving in the United States accounted for 2,854 (45.0%) of 
all TB cases among non–U.S.-born persons.

* Case counts based on data from the National Tuberculosis Surveillance System as of February 12, 2018.
† U.S. Census Bureau midyear population estimates provide the denominators used to calculate TB incidence.
§ Percentage change in incidence is calculated based on unrounded incidence for 2016 and 2017.
Among U.S.-born persons in 2017, a total of 1,001 (37.1%) 
TB cases were reported among blacks, and 797 (29.5%) 
among whites, representing a 55% decrease in case count for 
each group in the past decade. The highest TB rate among 
U.S.-born persons was reported among Native Hawaiians and 
other Pacific Islanders (6.5), followed by American Indians 
and Alaska Natives (3.7), blacks (2.8), Asians (2.0), Hispanics 
(1.5), and whites (0.4).
In 2017, 388 (4.3%) TB cases were reported among persons 
experiencing homelessness in the year preceding diagnosis, 148 
(1.6%) among persons residing in a long-term care facility at 
the time of diagnosis, and 266 (3.0%) among persons confined 
in a correctional facility at the time of diagnosis. Although cases 
among U.S.-born persons accounted for <30% of total TB 
cases in the United States, they accounted for 61.1% among 
those reporting homelessness, 44.6% among those in long-
term care facilities, and 39.5% among persons incarcerated 
at the time of diagnosis. HIV status was known for 86.3% 
of TB cases reported in 2017; among those cases, 5.6% had 
coinfection with HIV.
Drug susceptibility testing results were reported for 98.3% 
of culture-confirmed cases in 2016. Among all 9,256 cases 
reported in 2016, 97 (1.0%) were multidrug-resistant (MDR) 
TB, including 78 (80.4%) cases with primary MDR TB,** 
18 (18.6%) with a prior history of TB, and one (1.0%) with 
an unknown history of previous TB diagnosis. Among the 
97 MDR TB cases in 2016, 89 (91.8%) occurred among 
6,355 non–U.S.-born persons, accounting for 1.4% of all TB 
cases among non–U.S.-born persons. One case of extensively 
drug-resistant†† TB was reported in a non–U.S.-born person.
 
** Primary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is defined as a case of TB in a 
person with a Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate with resistance to at least 
isoniazid and rifampin and who was not previously diagnosed with or treated 
for drug-susceptible TB disease.
 
†† Defined by the World Health Organization as a case of TB in a person with 
a Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate with resistance to at least isoniazid and 
rifampin among first-line anti-TB drugs, resistance to any fluoroquinolone 
(e.g., ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin), and resistance to at least one second-line 
injectable drug (i.e., amikacin, capreomycin, or kanamycin).

Discussion
In 2017, the provisional TB case count and incidence were 
the lowest in the United States since national TB surveillance 
began in 1953 (1); however, the rate in 2017 (2.8 per 100,000) 
is still 28 times the U.S. elimination threshold of less than one 
case per million persons (4). Since 2014, the annual percentage 
change in rate compared with the preceding year has slowed 
to an average decline of 2.0%. To achieve TB elimination 
by 2100, a sustained annual decline of 3.9% is required.§§ 
Previous studies have indicated that reactivation of LTBI, 
rather than recent transmission, is the primary driver of TB 
disease in the United States, accounting for >80% of all TB 
cases (2). Ongoing efforts to prevent TB transmission must 
be sustained, and efforts to detect and treat LTBI, especially 
among groups at high risk, must be increased.
An epidemiologic model found that substantial (i.e., qua-
druple) increases in LTBI testing and treatment completion 
would accelerate progress toward TB elimination (4). Several 
accepted treatment regimens are available for LTBI (5). Among 
these, CDC encourages the use of shorter, rifamycin-based 
regimens, such as 4 months of rifampin or 3 months of once-
weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid, which have better treatment

completion rates (6) and are less hepatotoxic (7,8) than a regi-
men of 9 months of isoniazid. Improved treatment comple-
tion, less toxicity, and shorter treatment regimens can reduce 
morbidity and accelerate TB elimination in the United States.
Distinct disparities exist between populations affected by TB. 
Highly affected and vulnerable populations include persons 
housed in congregate settings and persons from countries with 
high TB prevalences. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force 
(USPSTF) recommends screening for LTBI in populations 
at increased risk, including persons born in countries with 
high TB prevalences, regardless of length of residence in the 
United States and age (3); this recommendation is consistent 
with a previously published report documenting an increasing 
proportion of TB diagnoses among non–U.S.-born persons 
living in the United States for ≥10 years (9). In addition to 
USPSTF screening recommendations, CDC also recommends 
treatment of LTBI to reduce the number of persons developing 
TB disease (5). Increased support of global TB elimination 
efforts would help to reduce global TB and LTBI prevalence, 
thereby indirectly reducing the incidence of reactivation TB 
in the United States among non–U.S.-born persons from 
higher-prevalence countries.
Spending time in congregate settings, such as homeless 
shelters, long-term care facilities, and correctional facilities, 
increases the risk for TB transmission. Most requests from 
state or local health departments for on-site CDC assistance

* Incidence calculated per 100,000 persons.
† Case counts based on data from the National Tuberculosis Surveillance System 
as of February 12, 2018. The Current Population Survey (https://www.census.
gov/programs-surveys/cps.html) provides the population denominators used 
to calculate TB incidence according to national origin and racial/ethnic group.
§ U.S.-born persons were born in the United States or U.S. territories (American 
Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, 
and the U.S. Virgin Islands) or born elsewhere to a U.S. citizen. Non–U.S.-born 
persons were born outside the United States (or the U.S. territories), and include 
those born in the sovereign freely associated states (Federated States of 
Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Republic of Palau) (unless 
one or both parents were U.S. citizens).
¶ Incidence was not calculated for these categories.
arise from TB outbreaks involving congregate settings serving 
vulnerable populations (10). The USPSTF recommends TB 
testing for persons who have lived in high-risk congregate set-
tings, such as homeless shelters and correctional facilities (3). 
Control of transmission requires not only preventing disease 
through treatment of LTBI, but also strong infection control 
practices in settings with increased risk for transmission.
The findings in this report are subject to at least two limita-
tions. First, this analysis is limited to reported provisional TB 
cases and case rates for 2017; final results will be available in 
the fall of 2018. Second, case rates are calculated using 2017 
population estimates as denominators.
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Since 1993, tuberculosis (TB) case counts and rates have 
declined in the United States. As the number of cases decreases 
overall, an increasing percentage of cases occurs among 
non–U.S.-born persons. Disparities also exist within racial, 
ethnic, and social groups among U.S.-born persons with TB.
What is added by this report?
In 2017, preliminary data indicate that 9,093 new TB cases were 
reported in the United States, a rate of 2.8 per 100,000 population. 
This is the lowest case count and rate on record, representing a 
decrease in case count of 1.8% from 2016 to 2017 and a 2.5% 
decrease in rate over the same period. The annual percent decline 
in rate in recent years has slowed to 2.0%. To achieve TB elimination 
by 2100, a sustained annual decline of 3.9% is required.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Control of active TB and a major effort to decrease latent TB 
infection are both necessary to reduce morbidity and achieve 
TB elimination in the United States. An important component of 
this strategy is the testing and treatment of populations most at 
risk for latent TB infection, persons born in countries with high 
TB prevalence, and persons in high-risk congregate settings.
Since 2015, TB case counts and rates in the United States 
have declined, in large part because of the work of local TB 
programs in detecting and treating persons with TB disease. 
Approximately 96% of persons with diagnosed TB disease 
in the United States complete therapy (1), thereby limiting 
the risk for further transmission and development of MDR 
TB. TB is preventable through LTBI testing and treatment 
and implementation of effective infection control measures; 
however, TB elimination goals in the United States will not be 
achieved without steadfast engagement among public health 
partners and sustained prevention and control programs. 
Public health priorities for TB elimination in the United States 
include developing comprehensive and innovative approaches 
to diagnosing, treating, and monitoring LTBI; continued 
engagement by the United States in global TB control efforts; 
and enhanced efforts to prevent TB transmission in the United 
States, particularly in congregate settings.
