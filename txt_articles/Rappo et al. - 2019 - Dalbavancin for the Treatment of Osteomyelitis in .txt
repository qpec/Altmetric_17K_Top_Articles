Background. Osteomyelitis is a challenging infection that can involve 4–6 weeks of intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Dalbavancin, 
approved for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, has potent activity against gram-positive pathogens. This study 
assessed the efficacy and safety of dalbavancin as a 2-dose regimen for osteomyelitis.
Methods. This study was a randomized, open-label, comparator-controlled trial in adults with a first episode of osteomyelitis 
defined by clinical symptoms, radiologic findings, and elevated C-reactive protein. Patients were randomized 7:1 to dalbavancin 
(1500 mg IV on days 1 and 8) or standard of care (SOC) for osteomyelitis (oral or IV) per investigator judgment for 4–6 weeks. The 
primary endpoint was clinical response at day 42, defined as recovery without need for additional antibiotics in the clinically evalu-
able (CE) population. Clinical response was also assessed at day 21, 6 months, and 1 year.
Results. Eighty patients were randomized to dalbavancin (n = 70) or SOC (n = 10). All had baseline debridement; Staphylococcus 
aureus was the most common pathogen (60% of patients). Clinical cure at day 42 was seen in 65/67 (97%) and 7/8 (88%) patients in 
the dalbavancin group and SOC group in the CE population, respectively. Clinical response was similar in the dalbavancin group at 
day 21 (94%), 6 months, and 1 year (96%). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 10 patients in the dalbavancin group; no 
patient discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.
Conclusions. A 2-dose regimen of weekly dalbavancin is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of osteomyelitis in adults.
Clinical Trials Registration. NCT02685033.
Keywords. osteomyelitis; dalbavancin; gram-positive.
Osteomyelitis in adults is a major clinical challenge and typi-
cally involves up to 6 weeks of parenteral and oral antibiotics. 
Debridement of infected tissue and surgical resection of necrotic 
bone are often needed [1, 2]. Diagnosis is established by bone 
biopsy with culture, in conjunction with clinical symptoms, ele-
vated inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), 
and radiologic findings [1–3]. The most commonly isolated 
pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative 
staphylococci (CoNS), which can be difficult to treat [1, 3, 4]. 
The increasing incidence of infections caused by methicillin-re-
sistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant CoNS fur-
ther complicates therapy, as recommended treatment includes 
vancomycin, which then requires an indwelling catheter, moni-
toring of serum drug levels, and careful dose adjustments [5–7]. 
Better treatment options are needed that would not require an 
indwelling catheter, unnecessary inpatient stays, or long-term 
administration of daily intravenous (IV) or oral antibiotics, in 
order to improve compliance and avoid associated toxicities.
Dalbavancin is a long-acting lipoglycopeptide antibiotic that 
inhibits cell wall synthesis, with a terminal half-life of 14.4 days 
[8, 9]. It is approved for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and 
skin structure infection (ABSSSI) as a 30-minute IV infusion 
in a single dose (1500 mg IV) or as 2 doses (1000 mg IV fol-
lowed 1 week later by 500 mg IV) [9–13]. Dalbavancin also has 
potent activity against gram-positive pathogens that cause bone 
and joint infection, with a minimum inhibitory concentration 
(MIC) required to inhibit the growth of 90% of S. aureus isolates

(MIC90) of 0.06 μg/mL and an MIC99.9 of 0.12 μg/mL, including 
MRSA [14, 15].
An earlier phase I study evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK) 
of dalbavancin in bone and articular tissue after a 1000-mg IV 
infusion. Mean dalbavancin levels in bone were 6.3 μg/g at 12 
hours and were sustained at 4.1 μg/g at 14 days postdose [16]. 
A separate phase I study evaluated the PK and safety of dalba-
vancin after extended-duration dosing of 1000 mg IV followed 
by 500 mg IV weekly for 7 additional weeks [16]. Population 
PK modeling from these 2 studies led to a proposed dosing 
regimen of two 1500-mg IV infusions 1 week apart to provide 
tissue exposure above the dalbavancin MIC99.9 of 0.12 μg/mL for 
S. aureus for 8 weeks, with a similar overall area under the curve 
(AUC) as a regimen of 1000 mg IV followed by 4 weekly doses 
of 500 mg IV [16].
The objective of this clinical trial was to describe the efficacy 
and safety of dalbavancin for the first episode of osteomyelitis 
known or suspected to be caused by gram-positive pathogens 
in adults.
METHODS
Study Conduct
This study was a phase II, single-center, randomized, open-la-
bel, comparator-controlled, parallel-group study conducted 
between March 2016 and December 2017 in Cherkasy Regional 
Hospital, an 860-bed tertiary care teaching hospital in Cherkasy, 
Ukraine. The site had participated in the 3 pivotal dalbavancin 
ABSSSI trials, and as a large orthopedic referral center for 20 
regions, it could complete enrollment in a reasonable time 
frame with an efficient collection of reliable data, including 
bone cultures. The protocol was approved by the independent 
ethics committee and government agencies of the Ukraine 
(approval No. 778) and by the European Union Clinical Trial 
Directive (Directive 2001/20/EC). The study was conducted in 
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients pro-
vided written informed consent.
Study Patients
Patients enrolled were ≥18 years old with a first episode of 
osteomyelitis with (1) pain or point tenderness upon palpation 
or probing to bone, (2) radiological findings (plain radiograph 
or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) consistent with osteo-
myelitis, and (3) elevated CRP above the upper limit of nor-
mal. Key exclusion criteria included >24 hours of IV antibiotics 
within 96 hours of randomization, prosthetic material at the 
site of infection at study initiation, a prior episode of osteomy-
elitis or a failed course of therapy for osteomyelitis, infection 
associated with a burn wound, sacral decubitus ulcer, multiple 
sites of osteomyelitis, septic arthritis that was noncontiguous to 
osteomyelitis, gram-negative bacteremia, or concomitant endo-
carditis or necrotizing fasciitis. Patients with acute or chronic 
osteomyelitis were enrolled if they met inclusion criteria.
Randomization and Intervention
Patients were randomized 7:1 to dalbavancin 1500 mg IV as a 
30-minute infusion on day 1 and day 8 or to standard of care (SOC) 
for osteomyelitis (oral or IV) based on investigator judgment for 
4–6 weeks (Supplementary Figure 1). A list of patient randomiza-
tion numbers was generated by the sponsor statistical program-
mer and was provided to the site with corresponding treatment 
group assignment, which was concealed with scratch-off labels 
that were opened just before randomization, to minimize patient 
selection bias. Randomization numbers were assigned consecu-
tively by the investigator at the time each patient was randomized. 
The dalbavancin dose was adjusted to 1000 mg IV by the phar-
macist or designee for patients not on dialysis with a creatinine 
clearance of <30 mL/minute. Aztreonam was allowed at random-
ization for presumed gram-negative coinfection and could be dis-
continued if a gram-negative pathogen was not identified; a switch 
to an oral antibiotic for gram-negative coverage was allowed after 
clinical improvement only for those with a gram-negative coinfec-
tion identified at baseline. Patients with gram-negative pathogens 
only in baseline bone cultures were discontinued from study drug 
per protocol, received appropriate antibiotics for gram-negative 
infections, and remained in the study for follow-up.
Endpoints
The primary endpoint was clinical response at day 42 in 
the clinically evaluable (CE) population, defined as recov-
ery without need for additional antibiotic therapy. Failure 
was defined as any of the following: additional antibiot-
ics for no response or worsening after improvement, new 
purulence, amputation due to progression of infection, >6 
weeks of antibiotics in the comparator arm, or death (for 
any reason). Indeterminate status was defined as loss to fol-
low-up or amputation due to vascular insufficiency. Clinical 
response was also assessed at day 180 (6 months) and day 
365 (1 year); early clinical improvement was assessed at day 
21 as no worsening of pain and/or point tenderness relative 
to baseline and again at day 28, now also associated with a 
decrease in CRP.
The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population includes 
patients who received any amount of randomized medication 
and met criteria for known or suspected gram-positive osteo-
myelitis; it excludes patients with only a gram-negative patho-
gen isolated from blood and/or bone culture. The CE population 
is a subset of the mITT population that also received ≥1 dose 
of dalbavancin (or ≥2 weeks of SOC) as randomized, and no 
more than 1 dose of a non-study systemic antibiotic with activ-
ity against the causative organism for an indication other than 
osteomyelitis. The microbiological-mITT (micro-mITT) popu-
lation is a subset of the mITT population that had a gram-pos-
itive pathogen isolated from blood and/or bone. The safety 
population includes all randomized patients who received any 
amount of randomized medication.

Safety data were collected at each visit (baseline, days 1, 8, 
21, 28, 42, 6 months, and 1 year) and included adverse events, 
physical examination, chemistry and hematology assessments 
(baseline, days 8 and 28), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 
and CRP (baseline, days 8, 28, 42, and 6 months), and imaging 
with plain film or MRI (baseline, days 28, 42, and 6 months).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical Analysis Software (SAS), version 9.3, was used for 
statistical analyses. Descriptive statistics, including the num-
bers and percentages for categorical variables and the num-
bers, means, standard deviations, medians, minimums, and 
maximums for continuous variables, were provided. P values 
were obtained using the Fisher exact test for the analysis of 
categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for the 
analysis of continuous variables. Two-sided 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) for the percentage of patients with clinical cure 
were obtained using the Clopper-Pearson method. Safety data 
were coded using version 20.1 of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA Maintenance and Support 
Services Organization).
RESULTS
Patients
A total of 81 patients were assessed for eligibility; 1 was a screen 
failure due to not meeting inclusion criteria. Eighty patients 
were randomized to dalbavancin (n = 70) or SOC (n = 10), as 
specified in the study protocol; all received study drug, and the 
trial ended after the last enrolled patient completed the study 
(Figure 1). Patients on SOC received an IV comparator twice 
daily for 4–6 weeks (Supplementary Table 1); the most common 
regimens were vancomycin IV for 29–30 days (n = 3) or vanco-
mycin IV for 5–16 days with switch to linezolid IV or levofloxa-
cin IV to complete 29 days of therapy (n = 4). The mITT and CE 
populations at day 42 included 67/70 (96%) dalbavancin patients 
and 8/10 (80%) SOC patients. Three patients in the dalbavancin 
arm received only the day 1 dalbavancin dose, and 2 patients in 
the SOC arm discontinued study drug per protocol; the reason 
for the premature discontinuation from study drug in both arms 
was that only gram-negative pathogens were isolated from bone 
at baseline, and this was also the reason that they were excluded 
from the mITT population (Figure 1). All other patients in the 
dalbavancin group completed both doses of dalbavancin.

Demographics and baseline disease characteristics of each 
treatment group are shown in Table 1. Ten patients (14.3%) in 
the dalbavancin group and 5 (50%) in the SOC group had a his-
tory of diabetes mellitus, including 4 patients and 1 patient with 
baseline diabetic foot infections, respectively. There was a higher 
percentage of men in the dalbavancin group (P = .024) and a 
higher percentage of patients with diabetes in the SOC group 
(P = .017); no other differences were statistically significant. 
The most common sites of osteomyelitis were the tibia, foot, 
and femur. Mean baseline CRP was 43.9 mg/L and 20.4 mg/L in 
the dalbavancin and SOC groups, respectively. All patients had 
baseline debridement and open biopsy with culture; bone his-
tology showed acute inflammatory cells in 80% of patients and 
necrotic bone consistent with chronic osteomyelitis in 61.4% of 
dalbavancin patients and 60% of SOC patients. A pathogen was 
isolated from bone in 65/70 (93%) patients in the dalbavancin 
group and 10/10 (100%) patients in the SOC group; S. aureus 
was the most common pathogen. Four patients in the dalba-
vancin group (2 with MSSA and 2 with CoNS) and 1 in the SOC 
group (CoNS) had bacteremia at baseline. No patient developed 
an organism that was not susceptible to dalbavancin during the 
study. Concomitant aztreonam was used in 11.4% of dalba-
vancin patients and 10% of SOC patients; none of the patients 
in either group received follow-up oral gram-negative coverage.

 Dalbavancin for Osteomyelitis • ofid • 5
Efficacy Outcomes
Clinical cure at day 42 in the CE and mITT populations was 
seen in 65/67 (97%) patients in the dalbavancin group and 7/8 
(88%) patients in the SOC group (Figure 2). There were no fail-
ures in the dalbavancin group at day 42; 2 patients were inde-
terminate due to loss to follow-up before day 21, and both had 
clinical improvement with decreased pain and point tenderness 
on day 8. There was 1 failure in the SOC group at day 42, due 
to having received >6 weeks of antibiotic therapy; he received 7 
weeks of SOC antibiotics based on investigator judgment and 
clinical status. The 95% CI for the primary endpoint of clinical 
cure at day 42 in the CE population was 89.6–99.6 in the dalba-
vancin group and 47.3–99.7 in the SOC group. Clinical cure at 
6 months and 1 year was seen in the dalbavancin group in 63/66 
(95%) of the CE and 63/67 (94%) of the mITT populations; clin-
ical cure was seen in 7/8 (88%) patients in the SOC group in 
both populations. Four patients in the dalbavancin group did 
not meet criteria for clinical cure in the mITT population at 
6 months and 1 year: 2 were indeterminate due to loss to fol-
low-up, 1 was a clinical failure due to death from an underlying 
medical condition approximately 5 months after the study drug, 
unrelated to treatment with dalbavancin, and 1 was a clinical 
failure due to requiring additional antibiotics approximately 
4 months after the study drug for soft tissue inflammation at 
the site of prior bone biopsy; he had debridement of soft tissue 
with no signs of inflammation in the bone and no growth from 
repeat site cultures. One patient in the SOC group did not meet 
criteria for clinical cure in the mITT population at 6 months 
and 1 year due to indeterminate status from loss to follow-up 
before the 6-month visit; this patient was categorized as a clini-
cal cure at the day 42 visit.
Clinical improvement at day 21 in the mITT and CE 
populations was seen in 63/67 (94%) patients in the dalba-
vancin group, and in 5/8 (63%) patients in the SOC group; 
an additional analysis of improvement at day 28 (no worsen-
ing of pain and/or point tenderness relative to baseline) with 
decrease in CRP measured at day 28 yielded identical results. 
The reasons for not meeting criteria for clinical improvement 
at day 21 were: in the dalbavancin group, 2 patients had miss-
ing CRP values due to loss to follow-up and 2 had increased 
CRP; in the SOC group, 2 patients had no change in CRP and 
1 had increased CRP.
All (4/4) patients with baseline gram-positive bacteremia in 
the micro-mITT population were in the dalbavancin group, 
had the same pathogens isolated from bone as from blood (2 
with MSSA and 2 with CoNS), and cleared their bacteremia by 
the second set of blood cultures, drawn 2–3 days later, with no 
recurrence of bacteremia. All patients with diabetic foot infec-
tion in the dalbavancin group (4/4) and the SOC group (1/1) 
were clinical cures at day 42, 6 months, and 1 year.

In the micro-mITT population, 60/62 (96.8%) patients in 
the dalbavancin group and 7/8 (87.5%) patients in the SOC 
group were clinical cures at day 42, with no failures in the dal-
bavancin group at day 42. Clinical cure by baseline pathogen 
is shown in Supplementary Table 2. All baseline gram-positive 
isolates from bone or blood cultures were susceptible to dalba-
vancin, with dalbavancin MICs spanning a narrow range: 0.06 
to 0.12 μg/mL for S. aureus and 0.06 μg/mL for Enterococcus 
faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. The highest dalbavancin MIC 
for any gram-positive isolate was 0.25 μg/mL in 2 patients in 
the dalbavancin group: Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 1) and 
Corynebacterium striatum (n = 1). All gram-positive pathogens 
in the micro-mITT population were susceptible to vancomycin 
(MIC ≤ 2 μg/mL), with a vancomycin MIC of 2 μg/mL for the 
following isolates: Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 9), E. faecalis 
(n = 4), MSSA (n = 2), and S. haemolyticus (n = 1).
In the dalbavancin group, all 11 patients with mixed infec-
tions in bone (Supplementary Table 3) were clinical cures at 
all  
timepoints; 3 received adjunctive gram-negative coverage 
with aztreonam for an average (range) of 8.7 (6–12) days. All 3 
patients in the dalbavancin group with gram-negative  
infections 
only in bone were discontinued from the study drug per proto-
col, received gram-negative antibiotics, and were clinical cures 
at all timepoints. In the SOC group, 2 patients had mixed infec-
tions in bone (Supplementary Table 3): 1 received an antibiotic 
with gram-negative coverage and was considered a clinical fail-
ure at day 42 (due to >6 weeks of antibiotics) and clinical cure at 
6 months and 1 year; 1 received an antibiotic with gram-negative 
coverage and was a clinical cure at all timepoints. Of 2 patients 
in the SOC group with gram-negative infections only in bone, 
1 received a gram-negative antibiotic and was indeterminate at 
all timepoints (due to withdrawal/loss to follow-up); 1 received a 
gram-negative antibiotic and was a clinical cure at all timepoints.
The mean length of hospital stay was 15.8 days in the dalba-
vancin group and 33.3 days in the SOC group (P < .001) (Table 
2). Patients in the dalbavancin group received a 30-minute infu-
sion on days 1 and 8 for a total IV duration of 1 hour; patients 
in the SOC group received an average of 31.6 days of twice-daily 
IV antibiotic therapy for an average total IV duration of 101.3 
hours per patient.
CRP decreased from baseline to 6-month follow-up in both 
groups (Supplementary Figure 2). All patients had elevated 
CRPs at baseline; the mean CRP was 42.1 mg/L in the dal-
bavancin group and 22.5 mg/L in the SOC group at baseline. 
Patients in the dalbavancin group with the highest baseline 
CRPs (192 mg/L) had the following pathogens in bone: MSSA 
(n = 4), MRSA (n = 1), and mixed gram-positive and gram-neg-
ative pathogens (n = 1). CRP decreased in all these patients by 
day 28, including 4 with normal CRP (6 mg/L); CRP was nor-
mal (6 mg/L) in all patients in the study at 6 months (n = 5). All 
6 patients were clinical cures at day 42, as were all patients in the 
study at 6 months and 1 year (n = 5).
Safety
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 
10 (14.3%) patients in the dalbavancin group and in no patients 
in the SOC group (Table 3). The most common TEAEs, each 
reported in 2 patients in the dalbavancin group, were anemia 
(associated with baseline debridement) and impaired healing, 
assessed as not related to the study drug. Two patients had 
serious TEAEs approximately 4–5 months after the study drug 
that were assessed as not related to the study drug. There were 
no patients who discontinued the study drug due to TEAEs. 
There were no observed safety concerns in clinical laboratory 
parameters.
DISCUSSION
The clinical trial presented here represents one of the largest 
randomized comparative clinical trials in osteomyelitis [17]. 
Its purpose was to describe the efficacy and safety of dalba-
vancin for the treatment of osteomyelitis known or suspected to 
be caused by gram-positive pathogens in adults. The majority 
of patients in this trial had a gram-positive organism isolated 
from bone, consistent with previous literature. The dalbavancin

 Dalbavancin for Osteomyelitis • ofid • 7
group had high clinical cure rates at day 42 (97% in the CE, 
mITT, and micro-mITT populations), sustained through 1 year. 
The 95% CI for the primary endpoint of clinical cure at day 
42 had a lower limit of approximately 90% in the dalbavancin 
group, suggesting that the data from this group alone are good 
evidence of a treatment effect, especially given the lack of an 
approved drug for osteomyelitis to use as a comparator. These 
findings are consistent with the efficacy of dalbavancin in an 
animal model with MRSA sternal osteomyelitis [18] and recent 
anecdotal observations of high response rates in the treatment 
of osteomyelitis with dalbavancin, associated with a reduced 
length of stay and treatment costs [19, 20].
Dalbavancin was well tolerated in this study; no patient 
discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, and no seri-
ous adverse events were considered related to dalbavancin. 
All patients had a baseline bone culture, with 89% and 80% 
of patients with a gram-positive pathogen in the dalbavancin 
and SOC groups, respectively. Most patients achieved clinical 
cure regardless of the baseline pathogen. Despite the low rate 
of gram-negative therapy in patients in the dalbavancin group 
(3/11) with concomitant gram-negative aerobes in bone, all 11 
patients with mixed infections were sustained clinical cures at 
all timepoints, suggesting that the gram-positive organisms in 
these patients were the most clinically important.
Recently, there has been increased interest in oral antibiotics 
as SOC for treatment of osteomyelitis [21, 22]. Although oral 
antibiotics do not require an indwelling catheter, their pro-
longed use is associated with increased risk of poor adherence, 
gastrointestinal intolerance, and inconsistent serum levels [21]. 
Dalbavancin may provide a simplified, 2-dose, alternative treat-
ment option, ensuring 100% adherence and minimal impact on 
gastrointestinal flora [23].
Patients in the dalbavancin group had a total IV duration of 
1 hour, whereas patients in the SOC group had an average total 
IV duration of 101.3 hours per patient. The brief 2-dose dalba-
vancin regimen may be suitable for an outpatient setting, such 
as emergency rooms, infusion centers, and hospital outpatient 
departments [24].
Limitations of this study include the open-label, single-cen-
ter design in Ukraine and the small sample size in the SOC 
group. An open-label design was chosen due to challenges with 
conducting a blinded study with various treatment options 
and dosing schedules. Although the focus of the trial was on 
obtaining as much data as possible on dalbavancin outcomes, 
benchmarking the outcomes against the local standard of care 
in a small subset of patients highlighted the unique character-
istics of this 2-dose regimen. A small SOC group was preferred 
over extrapolating from historical controls that may differ from 
the study cohort and would lack efficacy data and inflamma-
tory markers at the same timepoints as the dalbavancin group. 
The length of stay (LOS) was significantly shorter in the dalba-
vancin group than in the SOC group, though if the study was 
conducted in the United States, the LOS may have been shorter 
in both study groups. Another limitation is that native osteo-
myelitis was the objective of this trial; these results could serve 
as the basis for further study of osteomyelitis after joint replace-
ment rather than direct extrapolation of these data.
There are significant potential advantages in a 2-dose regi-
men of dalbavancin providing 6 weeks of antibiotic coverage for 
the treatment of osteomyelitis. The high microbiologic potency 
of dalbavancin combined with the prolonged tissue exposure at 
the site of infection and high clinical cure rates observed in this 
study make dalbavancin a convenient and effective option for 
an infection that has historically been burdensome for patients, 
providers, and the health care system.
