Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of Parkinson’s disease (PD) revealed at least 26 
risk loci, with associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in non-coding DNA having 
unknown functions in risk. In order to explore in which cell types these SNPs (and their correlated 
surrogates at r2 ≥ 0.8) could alter cellular function, we assessed their location overlap with histone 
modification regions that indicate transcription regulation in 77 diverse cell types. We found statistically 
significant enrichment of risk SNPs at 12 loci in active enhancers or promoters. We investigated 4 risk 
loci in depth that were most significantly enriched (−logeP > 14) and contained 8 putative enhancers in 
the different cell types. These enriched loci, along with eQTL associations, were unexpectedly present 
in non-neuronal cell types. These included lymphocytes, mesendoderm, liver- and fat-cells, indicating 
that cell types outside the brain are involved in the genetic predisposition to PD. Annotating regulatory 
risk regions within specific cell types may unravel new putative risk mechanisms and molecular 
pathways that contribute to PD development.
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting about 1% of those 
over the age of 60. Classically, PD was considered a movement disorder with akinesia, rigidity, tremor and pos-
tural instability as the predominant motor features. More recently, it became clear that patients also experience 
a wide range of disabling nonmotor disturbances, e.g. olfactory deficits, sleep disorders, depression, cognitive 
decline, constipation and other autonomic changes1. The neuropathology is characterized by severe degener-
ation of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons (crucial for the motor deficits) and progressive development 
of intraneuronal α 
-synuclein aggregates throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems2. Monogenetic 
forms of PD are rare and only account for 5–10% of cases3 (see also longer reviews4–6); a total of 7 autosomal and 
recessive genes have been identified, exhibiting varying degrees of penetrance. Thus, the vast majority of cases 
of PD are sporadic and a combination of environmental factors and complex genetic loci likely play a causative 
role4. In addition to the rare Mendelian-inherited cases of PD, the genetic predisposition to PD includes at least 
26 common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants (“index SNPs”), each imposing low but significant 
risk7,8. These risk loci associated with PD were discovered by population-based genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS), published in 2014 in a comprehensive large-scale meta-analysis of reproducible hits7 and conveniently 
summarized in a Cell snapshot3. Importantly, most (> 
90%) of the identified index SNPs in PD GWAS7,8 are 
located in noncoding DNA regions, making the assignment of potential functionality or causality-even the iden-
tification of the specific genes associated with the risk-SNPs-quite challenging.
Since 2005, over 1,600 significant SNP risk variants have been identified by GWAS for more than 250 
traits, many with complex genetic predisposition and unknown gene involvements (https://www.genome.
gov/26525384). Most genetic epidemiological studies have attempted to characterize the risk SNPs found in 
non-coding DNA simply by considering the “nearest gene” as the one being involved in risk. However, many 
index SNPs and their surrogates [in linkage disequilibrium (LD)] reside in regulatory regions (mainly in

enhancers) and the target genes of such regulation are most likely not the nearest genes9. Therefore, there is still 
a significant gap between the identification of most risk SNPs and an understanding of their biological function 
in human disease. Here, we have addressed this conundrum via the development and use of two Bioconductor 
software tools, FunciSNP and motifbreakR10,11, to functionally annotate risk SNPs for PD. The approach allows 
the identification of risk SNP enrichment at active regulatory elements in non-coding DNA (promoters and 
enhancers, in this study). Enrichment is defined as the presence of risk SNPs nonrandomly distributed and at 
an increased prevalence within chromatin regions with putative functions. The two alleles of the SNP may each 
impose a differential risk by affecting the regulatory capacity of the region on target genes.
In the past, we and others have used bioinformatic tools, including FunciSNP and motifbreakR, to interrogate 
genetic studies in light of both public and in-house next generation sequencing data. Noncoding risk regions of 
many complex diseases have thus been investigated in recent years. However, in most cases, this was done only 
in one specific cell- or tissue type within databases. More recently, with the curation of epigenetic data within 
the Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium (REMC), the mapping of risk alleles in a variety of cell types12 
became possible. Thus, our present approach is based on the assessment of PD risk SNP enrichment at specific 
chromatin regulatory regions in multiple distinct cell- and tissue types. Twenty-one PD risk loci were assessed in 
77 REMC cell types of diverse tissue- and lineage-origin. Eight enhancers at the four most significantly enriched 
PD risk loci were annotated in detail. They were found respectively in lymphocytes, mesendoderm, brain-, liver- 
and fat cells, allowing refined hypotheses to be formulated for the genetic predisposition to PD at these loci.
Results
We assessed 21 PD risk loci in 77 REMC tissues and cell types (supplemental Tables 1 and 2). One of the 77 REMC 
tissues was derived from human substantia nigra, which contains the dopaminergic neurons that undergo exten-
sive degeneration in PD. The majority of the data in REMC are from tissues or cells that classically have not been 
considered to be affected by PD and have, so far, not been implicated in the disease development. We collected 
three data types. They were histone H3K4 mono and trimethylation (H3K4me1&3), and acetylation of H3K27 
(H3K27ac). For the purposes of the present analyses, we restricted ourselves to active regulatory sequences in 
non-coding DNA (The data from Supplemental Table 1 are presented as a heat-map in Fig. 1). Regions with 
positive signals for the histone modification H3K4me3 were classified as promoters, and we considered them to 
be active if they overlapped with the active histone mark H3K27ac. On the other hand, we classified H3K4me1 
regions as enhancers, and similarly we considered them to be active if there was overlap with H3K27ac. We com-
pared enrichment of risk SNPs with all 1000 genomes SNPs within a window of 1 MB around each GWAS index 
SNP that we had found to occur within enhancer/promoter regions in the 77 REMC cell types. To this end, we 
counted correlated SNPs (at r2 ≥ 
 0.8; denoted as risk SNPs) at each risk locus in each of the 77 REMC cell types.

We statistically assessed them (risk SNPs in regulatory regions vs. non-risk 1000genomes SNPs in regulatory 
regions) for significant differences, using the hypergeometric test after locus-specific corrections for multiple 
hypotheses (Supplemental Table 1 and Fig. 1). A schematic presentation of the workflow is found in Supplemental 
Fig. 1.
Enrichment. 
We found enrichment of risk SNPs at 12 of the 21 loci, mainly at enhancers and not exclusively 
in nervous tissues, suggesting that the etiology of genetic risk is not restricted to the central nervous system. 
Based on very high significance (− 
logeP > 
 14) of enrichment, we chose to analyze eight putative enhancers in 
depth, as a proof-of-principle that our approach generates interesting and novel hypotheses about etiological and 
pathogenetic mechanisms of PD. The eight putative enhancers were at 4 most significantly enriched loci. They 
were at chromosome 4q21 (SNP enrichment in liver and fat cells, Fig. 2), chromosome 8p22 (SNP enrichment in 
BMP4 treated ES-derived mesendoderm, Fig. 3) and 12q12 (SNP enrichment in CD19-B lymphocytes, Fig. 4), 
and chromosome 14q24 (SNP enrichment in CD19-B lymphocytes and substantia nigra cells, Fig. 5).
Locus 4q21.1. 
SNP enrichment was found at active enhancers in both liver and fat cells, but not in substantia 
nigra cells at 4q21.1 (Fig. 2). In both active cases the regulatory regions are likely to be super-enhancers13 (a.k.a. 
stretch enhancers14) each spanning some 10 kb. One of the enriched SNPs disrupts topoisomerase I binding, 
an arginine/serine-rich, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (TOPORS). TOPORS is a nuclear protein and contains a 
RING-type zinc finger domain. It functions as an ubiquitin-protein E3 ligase15 but its function as a DNA binding 
protein is unknown. The response element (binding motif) falls within an intron for five isoforms of FAM47E. 
FAM47E is a protein of unknown function, but it is likely involved in inflammation and within epithelial biology 
networks16.
Locus 8p22. 
Four putative active risk enhancers at chromosome 8p22 demonstrate risk-SNP response-element 
disruption in BMP4-treated ES-derived mesendoderm, but not in substantia nigra cells (Fig. 3A,B). Three of the 
enhancers (Fig. 3A) are either independent or form part of a super/stretch-enhancer13,14 spanning about 5 kb. 
Three SNPs (rs6991493, rs7001099, and rs62504203) disrupt response elements in DMRTA2, POU6F2, and 
FOXG1/IRX2,3&6, respectively. DMRTA2 (doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor-like family A2) is 
mutated in novel cortical brain malformation17. POU6F2 (POU-domain homeobox transcription factor class 5) 
is associated with autism risk18. FOXG1 (forkhead box G1) is a transcription factor involved in the dysregulation 
of GABA/glutamate neuron differentiation in autism spectrum disorders19. IRX2,3&6 (Iroquois homeobox tran-
scription factors) are involved in internal organ development such as the heart20. The fourth SNP (rs1717289) 
right next to H3K27ac mark in BMP4 treated ES-derived mesendoderm, disrupts several transcription response 
elements including a CTCF site (Fig. 3B). The CTCF site may demarcate enhancer/promoter loops important in 
distal enhancer regulation. The transcription factors in question RXRA, BCL, PAX5, SP11, EP300, and MEF2 are 
all involved in cell type differentiation in some way or another. All four enhancers are located in a large intron of 
the gene RP11-13N12.1, which encodes for a lincRNA of unknown function.
Locus 12q12. 
A putative enhancer cluster at chromosome 12q12 is within an active enhancer region 
(H3K4me1 & H3K27ac) in CD19 B-lymphocytes cells but not brain cells. A strong promoter (H3K27ac) is also 
nearby. The enhancer is likely a super/stretch-enhancer13,14 spanning about 8 kb. A risk SNP (rs74324737) in the 
vicinity disrupts the response elements of four transcription factors with very similar response elements, namely 
TCF3, MYOD1, LMO2 and ZEB1 (Fig. 4). All four transcription factors are involved in tissue-specific signaling. 
The enhancer is within intron 2 of a multi-domain leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene, which encodes a 
kinase regulating a subset of Rab GTPases and is known to give rise to autosomal dominant PD when mutated21.
Locus 14q24.1. 
Two very strong risk enhancers (as judged by the type, extent and sizes of the modified 
histone peaks) likely forming part of another super/stretch-enhancer13,14 (spanning about 5 kb), are located at 
chromosome 14q24.1 (Fig. 5). They are found specifically in substantia nigra and to a lesser extent in CD19 
B-lymphocyte cells. Risk SNPs (rs2273596 and rs7160654) are respectively disrupting response elements for 
NHLH1 (Nescient helix-loop-helix) and NR3C1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C member 1). The NHLH1 
transcription factor correlates with DNA methylation and gene expression in the brains of patients with bipolar 
disorder and schizophrenia22. NR3C1, also known as the glucocorticoid receptor, is involved in multiple aspects 
of the inflammatory response.
Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) associations. 
Using data from the Genotype-Tissue 
Expression consortium (GTEx), we interrogated risk SNP genotypes and gene expression in different tissues. 
Since the tissue overlap between REMC and GTEx was only partial, risk polymorphisms at two loci (4q21.1 
and 12q12) were significantly associated (p < 
 2.5 × 
 10−5) with gene expression within tissues where enhancer 
enrichment was observed. Thus we found that the risk alleles of rs6812193 and its surrogates were associated with 
decreased expression of CCDC158, FAM47E, NAAA and NUP54 in many tissues including liver and fat. The 
risk alleles of rs76904798 and its surrogates were associated with increased expression of LRRK2 in many tissues 
including blood.
Discussion
In this study we employed a novel approach to identify the potential functionality of risk-SNPs as identified by 
GWAS in PD. We first determined whether risk SNPs are enriched at regulatory regions in distinct cell types or 
tissues in the REMC database, followed by an assessment from known databases of whether and how risk SNPs 
disrupt response elements (transcription factor binding motifs). Although similar enrichment analyses have been 
employed in other studies (e.g., by Farh et al.12), this is the first time such an approach has been undertaken for

PD or any neurodegenerative disease. We argue that if clusters of risk SNPs are found more often than by chance 
in regulatory regions (i.e., significant enrichment in that region), it is likely that alleles as defined by one or more 
SNPs are functional and modulate the risk of PD. In other words, alleles as defined by one or more SNP drivers 
carry the other SNP alleles as passengers within haplotype blocks. By this approach, we identified 12 loci signif-
icantly enriched in distinct cell types or tissues. Interestingly, only one locus with significant SNP enrichment in 
active regulatory regions was found in the substantia nigra. Our conclusion is that the risk SNPs identified by 
GWAS are likely involved in biological mechanisms conferred by cell types beyond the substantia nigra dopamin-
ergic neurons that have traditionally been the focus of PD risk.
Despite a dramatic increase in knowledge regarding the genetics of PD during the past decade4–6, the pre-
cise underlying pathogenetic mechanisms have remained elusive. Indeed, the contributing mechanisms might 
differ greatly among PD patients, because the clinical features, age at onset and rate of disease progression vary 
significantly1. The emerging picture of PD is one of a clinical syndrome with different underlying etiologies and 
molecular mechanisms, rather than a single disease1,5,23. This concept is consistent with the idea that changes in 
multiple independent molecular pathways, and the genes that control their activities, might influence the risk for 
PD. Several studies have implicated an impairment of the lysosomal autophagy system; mitochondrial deficits, 
oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation as key upstream events in the disease process24. This concept also agrees 
with the emerging view that the initial molecular triggers for PD might not always occur in the cell types that 
eventually bear the brunt of the disease, i.e., the midbrain dopaminergic neurons and other neurons that show 
exhibit α 
-synuclein aggregates. The concept of such “non-cell autonomous” toxicity has gained recent support25 
and stresses the need to also study non-neuronal cells when searching for the causes of PD.
We observed that genetic variants in lymphocytes, mesendoderm, brain, liver- and fat-cells could all be 
involved in PD risk, which is consistent with the theory that PD risk is affected by changes in multiple independ-
ent molecular pathways and the genes that control their activities; in different cell and tissue types, even outside 
the brain. Indeed, only one of the risk loci we identified has risk SNP enrichment in substantia nigra. Despite the 
traditional research focus on nigral dopaminergic neurons, pathological alpha-synuclein aggregates are present 
throughout both the peripheral nervous system and brain26 and they are believed to first appear in the olfactory 
system and in the nerves innervating the gastrointestinal tract and heart27, possibly as early as 5–15 years before 
diagnosis28,29. This phase is entitled “prodromal PD” and excludes overt motor symptoms, but it is associated 
with other functional deficits, e.g., anosmia, sleep disorder and constipation28,29. Considering the length of this 
prodromal phase, genetic variations that influence the pathogenic mechanisms, even in a minor way and outside 
the nervous system, could conceivably profoundly impact lifetime PD risk. Although this paper does not attempt

to establish the exact mechanisms by which the identified loci confer risk, in the following sections we discuss 
hypothetically how they may be involved in the pathobiological mechanisms of PD.
Three of the risk loci we identified are related to the immune system. Neuroinflammation is an integral part 
of the disease process in PD30–32, with ample evidence available for both activated microglia and increased levels

of pro-inflammatory cytokines33. Taken together, this brings changes in the genetic regulation of immune cells 
to the center stage. Two of the PD risk SNPs were enriched in CD19+ B-lymphocytes, at enhancers for LRRK2 
(chromosome 12) and at another locus (chromosome 14) the disruption of the glucocorticoid receptor response 
element. The immune system might be relevant to PD in at least three fundamentally important pathogenetic 
aspects: (i) interactions of the immune system and α 
-synuclein aggregation; (ii) autoimmunity; and (iii) changes 
in host defenses against pathogens.

Inflammation has been suggested to be a potential trigger of Lewy pathology. Specifically, neuroinflamma-
tion promotes α 
-synuclein misfolding in the brain34, and inflammation in the gut has been proposed to cause 
α 
-synuclein aggregation in enteric nerves starting a cascade of propagating Lewy pathology via the vagal nerve35–37. 
As stated above, one of the risk loci in B-lymphocytes is localized at an enhancer region within LRRK2, a gene 
which can harbor mutations that collectively are the most common known genetic cause of both familial and 
sporadic PD. LRRK2 is also associated with the inflammatory bowel disorder Crohn’s disease, hinting that it is 
involved in regulating intestinal inflammation38. The LRRK2 protein possesses both kinase and GTPase activ-
ities. The precise function of LRRK2 is not fully understood and expression of the protein in nigral dopamine 
neurons remains controversial. On the other hand, LRRK2 is expressed in immune cells including monocytes, 
microglia and CD19 + 
 B-lymphocytes, and is up-regulated following recognition of microbial structures39. 
Therefore LRRK2 has been suggested to regulate immune responses in the brain, and microglia lacking LRRK2 
exposed to proinflammatory stimuli have attenuated responses40,41. Brain microglia can phagocytose extracellular 
α 
-synuclein, reduce neuron-to-neuron transfer of α 
-synuclein and thereby potentially play a protective role by 
limiting the propagation of α 
-synuclein pathology between brain regions42–44. Changes in LRRK2 mediated sign-
aling have been suggested to alter clearance of misfolded alpha-synuclein from the brain and these effects might 
at least in part be mediated by microglia. Interestingly, where comparisons could be made between the GTEx 
and REMC databases, two of the enriched risk loci (rs6812193 and rs76904798) were associated with near-cis 
(+ 
/− 
 1000 kb) gene expression in the same tissues, indicating tissue-specific functionality of the risk enhancers 
involved. It is unclear how the eQTL genes at the two loci participate in PD risk, with the notable exception of 
LRRK2. Thus, the positive direction of association between risk alleles of rs76904798 and LRRK2 expression is in 
line with the known gain-of-function Mendelian mutations in this gene, which in turn lead to PD.
Despite that reactions in brain tissue are more tightly controlled than in the peripheral tissue, peripheral 
immune cells can readily access the brain45 and expression of risk loci in B-lymphocytes might directly contrib-
ute to inflammatory mechanisms in PD pathogenesis. Under physiological conditions, memory- and regulatory 
T-cells, and most likely also regulatory B-cells, traffic and monitor the central nervous system tissue and react to 
damage and invading pathogens46. Potential aberrations in these patrolling immune cells could lead to autoim-
munity or unrestricted immune reactions reactions. Co-stimulatory receptors expressed on B cells include CD19, 
a B-cell activating factor receptor and Toll-like receptor. Hyperactivity of these receptors may break B-cell toler-
ance in several autoimmune diseases. B-lymphocytes could also be important in PD pathogenesis considering 
their key role in the primary host defense against pathogens and the evidence that B-cell-related genes, including 
CD19, are significantly down-regulated in peripheral blood leukocytes from patients with PD47,48. Moreover, the 
absolute numbers of circulating CD19 cells are reduced in PD patients49. Another risk locus, possibly regulating 
FAM47E, was present in liver and adipocytes. In the liver, processes such as oxidation and the detoxification 
of metabolites and exogenous agents might contribute to PD. States with increased metabolic inflammation, 
such as diabetes, are coupled to an increased vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons to certain neurotoxins50–52. 
Furthermore, changes in liver cell function could impact uric acid metabolism. This would be important because 
changes in uric acid have been suggested to protect against PD, via its antioxidant effects of urate, and changed 
liver function is associated with changes in urate levels53. The liver harbors a large population of monocytes and 
macrophages that functions as phagocytes, breaking down pathogens and toxins, and that also presents antigens 
to lymphocytes54.
Possible effects of neurodevelopmental changes cannot be overlooked. A diagnosis of PD requires motor 
symptoms that are consequential to severe degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons and their striatal termi-
nals55. The number of nigral dopaminergic neurons varies greatly among normal human subjects56,57 and between 
different inbred strains of mice58, Thus, genetic factors might affect dopaminergic neurogenesis in humans and 
one can postulate that individuals born with more nigral dopaminergic neurons are less likely to be diagnosed 
with PD during their lifetime. Mesendoderm gives rise to, inter alia, mesodermal cells59, which in turn gives rise 
to (again inter alia) the notochord. The notochord releases hedgehog signaling proteins which are necessary for 
the development of the floor plate60,61 -an ectodermal tissue that forms neural progenitors including those that 
differentiate into midbrain dopaminegic neurons62. Our analysis of the 8p22 PD risk locus revealed disruption 
in several transcription factor response elements that are active in BMP4-treated ES-derived mesendoderm. It is 
conceivable that they affect the differentiation of the notochord; thereby they might have an effect on lifetime PD 
risk by reducing the number of midbrain dopaminergic neurons generated by the floor plate.
Concluding remarks
Genetic studies have led to novel insights in risk mechanisms of complex diseases, especially in studies of the 
genetic predisposition to cancer63. Despite this, many identified risk loci still remain challenging to functionally 
assess, due to the presence of too many potentially functional SNPs and lack of knowledge of the 3D structure of 
chromatin, making it difficult to link enhancers with their target genes. Annotating regulatory risk regions within 
specific cell types, as reported here, will go a long way toward understanding the risk mechanisms of complex 
genetic diseases. The putative risk mechanisms for PD are summarized in Fig. 6, in which we have considered 
developmental, trigger, and adaptive response mechanisms. The work reported here represents a novel strategy 
for identifying biological mechanisms that might influence PD risk and, importantly, provides new insight into 
the etiology of this devastating and progressive neurological disorder. We are currently developing laboratory 
models to investigate the mechanisms of these genetic associations within their appropriate organ and cellular 
contexts as informed by our enrichment analysis.
Methods
Functional annotation of GWAS. 
Twenty-six index SNPs associated with PD were downloaded from 
http://www.pdgene.org/top_results. Five SNPs were removed from further analysis. Rs17649553 was removed

because it was in an assembly exception. Rs11060180, rs34311866, rs356182 and rs62120679 were removed 
because they had no SNPs with r2 ≥ 
 0.8. This left 21 SNPs for further enrichment analysis. These SNPs were 
integrated with comprehensive data from the Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium (REMC) for 77 tis-
sues and cell types and 1000 genomes using FunciSNP software11. For each of the cells and tissues from REMC, 
consortium IDR-processed data64 were obtained for each of three data types, H3K4me1 and 3, and H3K27Ac. 
SNPs in LD at r2 ≥ 0.8 and overlapping these features were identified using FunciSNP software. In order to func-
tionally categorize the SNPs, we used a rules-based segmentation algorithm to classify regions in every listed cell 
type based on histone marks. The following describes the rules in order of decreasing precedence. Regions with 
a positive signal for the histone modification H3K4me3 were classified as promoters, and as active or poised on 
the basis of overlap with the active histone mark H3K27ac (promoter active region PAR). H3K4me1 regions 
were classified as enhancers, and similarly as active or poised on the basis of overlap with H3K27ac (enhancer 
active region EAR). Each region had a single annotation assigned such that SNPs could be assigned one of three 
unambiguous functions based on the combinations of histone marks. The 77 REMC cell types used for the study 
and numerical significance of enrichment (see below) are listed in Supplemental Table 1. Cell type abbreviations 
are listed in Supplemental Table 2. The enrichment is also presented as a heatmap in Fig. 1 for visual simplicity.
Enrichment analyses. 
We used the hypergeometric distribution to calculate the probability of the overlaps 
against the background of 1000 genomes (within 1 MB windows around the index SNPs inclusive) and adjusted 
for multiple comparisons for each cell type with FDR < 
 0.05. This was repeated for the pooled categories EAR 
& PAR (active enhancers and promoters). Enriched regions were evaluated in the UCSC genome browser with 
wiggle tracks (.wig) for H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, our genome segmentations and tissue-specific FunciSNP results. 
We calculated a Euclidean distance metric for log-scaled p values for each index SNP in each tissue and used 
average linkage hierarchical clustering with the heatmap. 2 package in R (Fig. 1).
Analysis of Transcription Factor binding sites. 
SNPs located within enhancers or promoters of any kind 
were analyzed using the bioconductor motifbreakR package using default method settings (weighted sum) with 
a p-value cutoff at 5 × 
 10–5 (ref. 10). Figures were prepared from screenshots of the UCSC genome browser and 
MotifbreakR plotting functions for SNPs at p < 10–5.
Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL). 
All polymorphisms within + 
/− 
 50 kb of the FAM47E or 
LRRK2 locus which were included the meta-analysis by Nalls et al.7 and associated with a p-value of at least 
0.05 were downloaded from pdgene.org. To these were added unique SNPs in LD (r2 ≥ 
 0.8) found via the Broad 
Institute SNAP program (https://www.broadinstitute.org/mpg/snap/). This enlarged set was used to subset 
the significant eQTL SNP-gene associations available from the GTEx consortium (http://www.gtexportal.org/
home/). This subsetting produced a tissue specific collection of SNP-gene expression associations linked to PD.
Computers and Software. 
Genome segmentations, FunciSNP, clustering, motifbreakR, and SNP-tissue 
enrichment analyses were carried out in R (https://cran.r-project.org) on an iMac Retina 5k with a 3.5-GHz pro-
cessor and 24 GB of memory.
