Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) causes recurrent outbreaks of acute life-threatening human and livestock 
illness in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. No licensed vaccines are currently available for humans 
and those widely used in livestock have major safety concerns. A ‘One Health’ vaccine development 
approach, in which the same vaccine is co-developed for multiple susceptible species, is an attractive 
strategy for RVFV. Here, we utilized a replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine platform 
with an established human and livestock safety profile, ChAdOx1, to develop a vaccine for use against 
RVFV in both livestock and humans. We show that single-dose immunization with ChAdOx1-GnGc 
vaccine, encoding RVFV envelope glycoproteins, elicits high-titre RVFV-neutralizing antibody and 
provides solid protection against RVFV challenge in the most susceptible natural target species of the 
virus-sheep, goats and cattle. In addition we demonstrate induction of RVFV-neutralizing antibody 
by ChAdOx1-GnGc vaccination in dromedary camels, further illustrating the potency of replication-
deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine platforms. Thus, ChAdOx1-GnGc warrants evaluation in 
human clinical trials and could potentially address the unmet human and livestock vaccine needs.
RVFV, a negative-stranded RNA virus in the Bunyaviridae family, is listed as an emerging zoonotic Category A 
viral pathogen in the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) list of priority pathogens for 
biodefense research. The disease, Rift Valley Fever, has serious implications for livestock agriculture and trade 
and is also listed as a notifiable disease by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Although primarily 
restricted to Africa, the virus can be transmitted by at least ten mosquito species that are more widely distributed 
than RVFV leading to concerns of disease spread1, as has occurred in the Arabian Peninsula and Madagascar2,3. 
Humans can also get infected through contact with virus-contaminated tissues and fluid4. Due to its epizootic 
nature related to heavy rainfall and flooding5, Rift Valley Fever is a difficult disease to study. It is thought that 
successive and overlapping swarms of different mosquitos infect and amplify infection rates in ruminants with 
subsequent transmission to humans, resulting in epidemics6. The high levels of human morbidity and mortality 
during the last major outbreak in 2006/7 in eastern Africa underscores the urgency of developing comprehensive 
surveillance, response and control programs, especially since there is growing evidence for inter-epidemic trans-
mission of RVFV.
Rift Valley Fever causes high rates (> 
90%) of mortality in young ruminants, primarily sheep, goats and cat-
tle. Although older animals are more resistant to disease, high rates of abortion (so-called ‘abortion storms’) are 
observed following RVFV infection in pregnant animals and this is often used as a warning sign of imminent 
human disease epidemics7. Unlike other domestic ruminants, RVFV infection in dromedary camels tends to be 
mild or inapparent, with abortion among pregnant animals being the only clinical sign8. However, severe clinical 
signs, including haemorrhagic septicaemia and sudden death, have been observed among infected dromedary 
camels in Mauritania9. In humans RVFV infection presents as an acute self-limiting febrile illness, but severe

manifestations, including haemorrhagic fever and encephalitis, also occur, with case fatality rates > 
30% reported 
in some outbreaks, and long-term sequelae (e.g. impaired vision) in some survivors10,11. Live and inactivated 
RVFV vaccines are available for livestock, but no licensed vaccines or anti-viral therapies are currently available 
for humans.
Recovery from natural RVFV infection results in long-lived cross-strain immunity conferred by neutralizing 
antibodies against the viral envelope glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, which are conserved across different viral iso-
lates12,13. Thus, whilst the neutralizing antibody titre threshold required for protection against RVFV infection is 
currently unknown, development of vaccines that elicit antibody titres within the range induced by natural infec-
tions is a very attractive way forward. The widely used live attenuated RVFV vaccines (e.g. Smithburn vaccine) in 
livestock in Africa14 elicit high titre neutralizing antibody and provide durable cross-strain protection. However, 
these livestock vaccines carry the risk of reversion to virulence and risks of teratogenicity and abortion14, making 
their general use in humans very unlikely. A formalin-inactivated investigational RVFV vaccine, TSI-GSD-200, 
has previously been evaluated in humans and found to be safe but poorly immunogenic, requiring three primary 
immunizations and a booster dose to generate and maintain neutralizing antibody responses15. A live-attenuated 
RVFV vaccine has undergone clinical testing and the study registered as completed in 2012 but results are as yet 
unpublished (ClinicalTrials.gov No. NCT00415051). Development and licensure of safe, highly immunogenic 
and efficacious RVFV vaccines for humans is clearly an unmet need for this neglected public health threat. The 
use of vaccine platforms with a well-established human safety profile is an attractive strategy for this purpose.
Replication-defective chimpanzee adenoviruses (ChAd) are among the most promising human vaccine 
platforms available. Unlike platforms that utilize adenoviruses to which humans are naturally exposed to (e.g. 
HAdV5) ChAd vectors are not prone to significant anti-vector immunity that could limit vaccine performance in 
humans16,17. In addition, ChAd vectors have a large insert capacity (~8 kb), achieve high level, persistent transgene 
expression and are adaptable for use with diverse immunogens. Of relevance to their potential use in a human 
RVFV vaccine, ChAd vectors, including ChAdOx117, have passed safety evaluations in humans for a wide range 
of infectious disease targets including malaria18, HIV19, tuberculosis, influenza20, hepatitis C21, RSV22 and, most 
recently, Ebola23. Their use as a common vaccine development platform has the advantage of allowing multiple 
vaccines to be biomanufactured rapidly with standardized processes and low cost of goods.
We previously showed that a single-dose immunization with ChAdOx1-GnGc, composed of ChAdOx117,20, a 
species E adenovirus, encoding RVFV Gn and Gc, elicits high-titre neutralizing antibody and confers protection 
against lethal viral challenge in mice24. Here, to further evaluate ChAdOx1-GnGc as a potential candidate vac-
cine for humans and livestock we determined its immunogenicity and protective efficacy against virulent RVFV 
challenge in sheep, goats and cattle in a disease-endemic setting in Kenya. In addition, we evaluated the immu-
nogenicity of ChAdOx1-GnGc in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia and compared vaccine-elicited responses to 
those measured in the sheep, goat and cattle efficacy studies in Kenya.
Results and Discussion
Sheep (Dorper breed), goats (Galla breed) and cattle (Holstein-Friesian breed) aged 4–6 months were sourced 
from local commercial farms and pre-screened for previous exposure to RVFV using the serology-based ID 
Screen® 
 RVF kit (IDvet, France). Groups of seronegative animals were then immunized intramuscularly on 
the right base of the neck with 109 infectious units (iu) ChAdOx1-GnGc without adjuvant (group 1), 109 iu 
ChAdOx1-GnGc mixed with the saponin-based Matrix-QTM adjuvant (group 2) or placebo immunized with 
phosphate buffered saline (PBS; group 3). A fourth comparator group received the licensed live Smithburn RVFV 
livestock vaccine widely used in Africa (group 4). Four weeks later all animals were challenged by subcutaneous 
inoculation of 107 plaque-forming units of the same batch of a heterologous virulent RVFV strain 56/74IN25 and 
monitored for 14 days after which they were culled. The primary endpoint for efficacy was development of virae-
mia as measured by qRT-PCR26 in whole blood sampled daily over the monitoring period.
Whilst all sheep, goats and cattle in the placebo group developed viraemia, no viraemia could be detected 
among any of the ChAdOx1-GnGc vaccinees in all three species (Fig. 1). Marked increase in rectal temperature 
accompanied viraemia in sheep and cattle (Fig. 1c,i), but not in goats (Fig. 1f) confirming the unreliability of 
rectal temperature as a read-out for vaccine efficacy in this species7,27. The licensed Smithburn vaccine was also 
protective but, consistent with previous reports of its variable immunogenicity in some livestock14,28, one goat and 
one calf receiving this vaccine developed viraemia post-challenge (Fig. 1e,h).
Next we measured RVFV neutralizing antibody titres in sera sampled four weeks post-immunization. In all 
three species ChAdOx1-GnGc vaccination elicited high-titre neutralizing antibody, comparable to the licensed 
Smithburn vaccine (Fig. 2a). Similar neutralizing antibody titres were observed in parallel ChAdOx1-GnGc 
immunogenicity studies in sheep and cattle in the UK (Fig. 3), and remained high at 3 months post-vaccination. 
We could not detect neutralizing antibody in sera from the viraemic Smithburn vaccinees (Fig. 1e,h). Further, 
unlike studies utilizing a similar adjuvant in mice24, Matrix-Q™ 
 adjuvant had no effect on the antibody response 
elicited by ChAdOx1-GnGc in any of the livestock species (Figs 2a and 3), highlighting the importance of evalu-
ating candidate vaccine regimens in target species.
Significant post-challenge boosting of neutralizing antibody titres was observed in all three species inde-
pendent of vaccine allocation (Fig. 2c), though overall responses were notably higher among goats. To perform 
inter-species comparisons of the magnitude of boosting, data from vaccinees were pooled, maximizing statistical 
power whilst minimizing the number of comparisons. As expected, pooled pre-challenge neutralizing antibody 
titres were comparable between species (Fig. 2b). However, post-challenge antibody titres were significantly 
higher in goats compared to sheep and cattle (Fig. 2d) suggesting potential differences in the kinetics and/or 
nature of secondary adaptive immune responses between species.
Next, given their susceptibility to RVFV infection and role in virus transmission8,9 we sought to evaluate 
ChAdOx1-GnGc immunogenicity in dromedary camels. We sourced dromedary camels aged 1 to 2 years from

commercial farms in Qassim, Saudi Arabia and screened for previous exposure to RVFV by virus neutraliz-
ing antibody assay. Eleven unexposed camels were then randomly allocated into two groups for intramuscular 
immunization with 109 iu ChAdOx1-GnGc (n = 
 7), as in the efficacy studies in Kenya, or placebo (PBS, n = 
 4).

Six of the seven ChAdOx1-GnGc vaccinees mounted a neutralizing antibody response detectable at day 28 
post-vaccination (Fig. 2b) and the remaining ChAdOx1-GnGc vaccinee had seroconverted by the next sampling 
time point (day 56 post-vaccination). Neutralizing antibody titres between the two time points were comparable 
(mean at day 28 = 
 70, range 0–1277 vs. mean at day 56 = 
 108, range 40–384; Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank 
test p = 
 0.7). However, the titres elicited in camels were lower in comparison to those observed in sheep, goats and 
cattle at the same ChAdOx1-GnGc dose and time post-vaccination (day 28; Kruskal-Wallis test p = 
 0.02; Fig. 2b), 
but still within the range associated with protection in other livestock studies29,30. However, lack of appropriate 
biocontainment facilities for camel RVFV challenge studies limited our ability to directly determine the protective 
efficacy of this response, though this is clearly a priority for future studies.
In summary we have demonstrated the utility of the replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus platform in 
induction of functional antibody and protective immunity against RVFV in multiple target livestock species in 
a disease-endemic setting. Larger field efficacy and dose optimization studies of ChAdOx1-GnGc in animals of 
different age groups and physiological status will be required to underpin its future licensure and general use in 
livestock, and to explore potential inter-species differences in vaccine-elicited immune responses. The durability 
of the immune response in vaccinees, as well as safety and efficacy in pregnant animals and prevention of mor-
tality in neonatal animals will be key endpoints in such studies. The current widely used livestock RVFV vaccines 
have major safety concerns14 and their use makes it impossible to distinguish infected from vaccinated animals

(DIVA) since the anti-RVFV antibody profile in both groups of animals is similar. DIVA compatibility is particu-
larly important for livestock disease surveillance and rapid effective control during epizootics. ChAdOx1-GnGc, 
like other candidate vaccines in development31,32, only encodes RVFV envelope glycoproteins-the major target of 
protective immunity - making it compatible with commercially available serological DIVA kits that assign ‘vac-
cinated’ (only seropositive for RVFV envelope glycoproteins) or ‘infected’ (seropositive for all RVFV antigens) 
status with high sensitivity and specificity.
Evaluation of ChAdOx1-GnGc in human clinical trials is an obvious next step. However, because deliberate 
human infection with RVFV to test vaccine efficacy is not possible, the pathway to licensure for human use will 
likely rely on special approval processes such as the US Food and Drug Administration Animal Efficacy Rule 
in which licensure for an intervention with an acceptable safety profile can be obtained based on its protective 
efficacy in suitable animal species. Evaluation of the most promising human RVFV vaccine candidates in clinical 
trials to support licensure will ensure better preparedness for future outbreaks through vaccine stockpiling, allow-
ing rapid deployment in first response teams of health workers and others at most risk of RVFV infection. This is 
now a favoured approach for high impact outbreak pathogens in general, and is among key lessons emerging from 
the devastating Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa33.
Finally, the One Health vaccine development approach used here, by which the same vaccine is co-developed 
for humans and susceptible animal species, is well suited to many emerging outbreak pathogens, most of which 
involve zoonotic transmission34. Further to providing stringent evaluation of a candidate human vaccine in 
pre-clinical efficacy studies utilizing actual target animal species, the approach allows the possibility of cost 
reductions for the final product by increasing the scale of manufacture. GlaxoSmithKline, one of the largest 
pharmaceutical companies, is already developing large-scale biomanufacture capacity for replication-deficient 
chimpanzee adenovirus vaccines indicating strong industrial interest for the platform23.
Methods
Vaccines, adjuvant and RVFV. 
The ChAdOx1-GnGc vaccine was prepared by Gateway® 
 recombination 
between the ChAdOx1 destination vector17 and an entry plasmid containing the coding sequence for RVFV 
Gn and Gc (Genbank accession number DQ380208, bases 411–3614) as described (22). The live attenuated 
Smithburn RVFV vaccine (Riftvax™ 
) was obtained from the Kenya Veterinary Vaccines Production Institute, 
Kenya, for use as a comparator in the efficacy experiments. The saponin-based Matrix-Q™ 
 adjuvant, developed 
and licensed for use in ruminants, was obtained from Novavax AB, Sweden. The virulent RVFV strain 56/74IN 
was propagated in C6/36 insect cells (23), purified by ultracentrifugation and resuspended in PBS for challenge of 
sheep, goats and cattle as outlined below.
RVFV challenge experiments in Kenya. 
All animal challenge experiments were reviewed and approved 
by the International Livestock Research Institute’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ILRI-IACUC) 
and conducted in accordance with the ILRI-IACUC and the Kenya National Biosafety Authority guidelines. Four 
to six-month old sheep, goats and cattle were sourced from local commercial farms and pre-screened for previ-
ous exposure to RVFV by the ID Screen® 
 RVF kit (IDvet, France). Sheep were of the Dorper breed, cattle of the 
Holstein-Friesian breed and goats of the Galla breed. Following an acclimatization period in the animal facility, 
animals were randomly allocated to four experimental groups and vaccinated intramuscularly at the right base of 
the neck with 109 infectious units (iu) ChAdOx1-GnGc without adjuvant (group 1; n = 
 7 sheep, 6 goats, 6 cattle) 
Figure 3. ChAdOx1-GnGc elicits comparable RVFV neutralizing antibody titres in Kenyan and UK 
livestock. Sheep and cattle in the UK were immunized with either ChAdOx1-GnGc (n = 
 4/species), ChAdOx1-
GnGc with Matrix-Q™ 
 (n = 
 4/species) or placebo (n = 
 3 sheep, n = 
 4 cattle) using the same vaccine dose and 
volumes as in studies in Kenya (see Methods). RVFV neutralizing antibody titres were then measured over a 
3-month period before culling. As in the Kenyan studies, Matrix-Q™ 
 did not enhance the magnitude of the 
response in either species across the study period and the range of titres across time points were comparable 
to those in sheep (Kruskal-Wallis test p = 
 0.6) and cattle (Kruskal-Wallis test p = 
 0.9) in Kenya. Black circles–

or 109 iu ChAdOx1-GnGc mixed with 100 μ 
g (sheep and goats) or 400 μ 
g (cattle) Matrix-QTM adjuvant (group 2; 
n = 
 7 sheep, 6 goats, 5 cattle) or placebo-vaccinated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, group 3; n = 
 7 sheep, 6 
goats, 6 cattle). All immunizations were done in a total volume of 1 ml. A fourth group of 4–5 animals was vac-
cinated with the Smithburn vaccine as per manufacturer’s instructions, and used as positive controls (group 4; 
n = 
 5 sheep, 4 goats, 4 cattle).
Serum was sampled from all animals on the day of vaccination (day 0) and on day 28 post-vaccination. 
The immunogenicity endpoint for this study was the induction of RVFV neutralizing antibody, measured 
pre-challenge (day 28 post-vaccination). All animals were challenged by subcutaneous inoculation of 107 
plaque-forming units of RVFV 56/74IN on the left base of the neck on day 28 post-vaccination and monitored for 
the next 14 days. The subcutaneous route was chosen as one that consistently induces viraemia in ruminants7,27. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was viraemia as measured by qRT-PCR in whole blood sampled daily over the 
entire two-week monitoring period. The qRT-PCR assays were done on a StepOnePlus™ 
 Real-Time PCR system 
using TaqMan® 
 Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix with published primers, probe and cycling conditions26. The group 
sizes of ≥ 
4 provided 90% power for a two-sample comparison of proportions at an alpha of 5%, allowing detec-
tion of 100% efficacy in the vaccine groups (i.e. no viraemia post-challenge) versus no protection in the placebo 
group (i.e. presence of viraemia post-challenge in all animals). All animal staff and investigators were blinded to 
group allocation during the experiment and measurement of efficacy and immunogenicity endpoints.
ChAdOx1-GnGc immunogenicity studies in the UK and Saudi Arabia. 
In parallel with stud-
ies in Kenya ChAdOx1-GnGc immunogenicity was evaluated in Merino sheep and Holstein-Friesian cattle at 
the Pirbright Institute, UK, having been reviewed and approved by the institute animal ethics committee. The 
study was conducted in accordance with the UK Home Office guidelines. Two to four-month old lambs and 
calves were sourced from commercial farms. For each species, groups of animals each were immunized with 109 
iu ChAdOx1-GnGc without adjuvant (n = 
 4 sheep, 4 cattle) or 109 iu ChAdOx1-GnGc co-administered with 
Matrix-Q™ 
 (n = 
 4 sheep, 4 cattle) as in the studies in Kenya. Placebo controls (n = 
 3 sheep, 4 cattle) received PBS. 
Serum was sampled from all animals on the day of vaccination (day 0) and on days 28, 56 and 84 post-vaccination 
after which animals were culled.
Following on from the Kenya and UK studies we evaluated the immunogenicity of ChAdOx1-GnGc in drom-
edary camels, sourced locally in Qassim, Saudi Arabia and pre-screened for previous exposure to RVFV by neu-
tralizing antibody assay. Eleven unexposed camels were acclimated to the animal facility at Qassim University 
college of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine and randomly allocated to intramuscular 109 iu ChAdOx1-GnGc 
immunization (n = 
 7) or placebo (PBS, n = 
 4). Serum was sampled from all animals on the day of vaccination 
(day 0) and on days 28 and 56 before culling. All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the 
institutional animal use guidelines at Qassim University.
Assessment of RVFV neutralizing antibody responses. 
Sera were heat-inactivated for 30 minutes 
at 56 °C before use. Then, serial two-fold dilutions of the sera were made in 100 μ 
l Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle 
Medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (DMEM-10) to which a further 100 μ 
l of DMEM-10 containing 
100 TCID50 of the MP-12 RVFV strain was added. After a one-hour incubation at 37 °C the virus-serum mixture 
was transferred onto confluent Vero cell monolayers in 96-well plates in quadruplicate and incubated for 72 hours 
at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were then fixed in PBS containing 10% formaldehyde, stained in 1% 
crystal violet, plaque formation scored and the Spearman-Karber algorithm used to determine the 50% endpoint 
titres (hereafter termed VNT50).
Statistical analyses. 
All analyses were performed using non-parametric tests in GraphPad Prism® 
 v6 using 
a two-sided p value < 
0.05 as the cut-off for statistical significance.
