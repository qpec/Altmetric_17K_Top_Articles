IMPORTANCE The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor evolocumab has
been demonstrated to reduce the composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or
cardiovascular death in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. To
our knowledge, long-term cost-effectiveness of this therapy has not been evaluated using
clinical trial efficacy data.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of evolocumab in patients with atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease when added to standard background therapy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A Markov cohort state-transition model was used,
integrating US population-specific demographics, risk factors, background therapy, and event
rates along with trial-based event risk reduction. Costs, including price of drug, utilities, and
transitional probabilities, were included from published sources.
EXPOSURES Addition of evolocumab to standard background therapy including statins.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction,
ischemic stroke and cardiovascular death, quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), incremental
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and net value-based price.
RESULTS In the base case, using US clinical practice patients with atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of at least 70 mg/dL
(to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259) and an annual events rate of 6.4 per
100 patient-years, evolocumab was associated with increased cost and improved QALY:
incremental cost, $105 398; incremental QALY, 0.39, with an ICER of $268 637 per QALY
gained ($165 689 with discounted price of $10 311 based on mean rebate of 29% for branded
pharmaceuticals). Sensitivity and scenario analyses demonstrated ICERs ranging from
$100 193 to $488 642 per QALY, with ICER of $413 579 per QALY for trial patient
characteristics and event rate of 4.2 per 100 patient-years ($270 192 with discounted price of
$10 311) and $483 800 if no cardiovascular mortality reduction emerges. Evolocumab
treatment exceeded $150 000 per QALY in most scenarios but would meet this threshold at
an annual net price of $9669 ($6780 for the trial participants) or with the discounted net
price of $10 311 in patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of at least
80 mg/dL.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE At its current list price of $14 523, the addition of evolocumab
to standard background therapy in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
exceeds generally accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds. To achieve an ICER of $150 000
per QALY, the annual net price would need to be substantially lower ($9669 for US clinical
practice and $6780 for trial participants), or a higher-risk population would need to be
treated.

density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels with certain thera-
pies, including statins, reduces cardiovascular events.8,9 Yet,
many patients with established ASCVD need further LDL cho-
lesterol lowering and remain at substantial risk for cardiovas-
cular events despite optimal statin therapy.1,4,9 In the past 5
years, monoclonal antibodies that inhibit proprotein conver-
tasesubtilisin/kexintype9(PCSK9)havedemonstratedmarked
LDL cholesterol level lowering. Evolocumab, a fully human
monoclonal antibody against PCSK9, lowers LDL cholesterol
by approximately 60%.10-13 The evolocumab cardiovascular
outcomes trial, Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research
With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk
(FOURIER),14 demonstrated that the addition of evolocumab
to standard background therapy, including moderate- to high-
intensity statin therapy, reduced incidence of cardiovascular
events in patients with established ASCVD.
Cost-effectiveness of new therapies is important as health
care costs rise, and accurate information about value and po-
tential tradeoffs among therapies is essential. Several analy-
ses have assessed the potential economic value of PCSK9 in-
hibitors in patient populations with varied risk levels,7,15-18
extrapolating cardiovascular event reduction rate ratios per
38.67 mg/dL of LDL cholesterol reduction observed in the Cho-
lesterol Treatment Trialists Collaboration (CTTC) meta-
analyses of statin trials (to convert LDL cholesterol to milli-
moles per liter, multiply by 0.0259).8,19,20 To our knowledge,

In this study, a Markov cohort state-transition model was

added to standard background therapy in clinical practice pa-
tients with established ASCVD from a societal and US health
plan perspective to help better identify the patient popula-

ment would provide value.
Methods
Model Structure
A Markov cohort state-transition model was used, consider-
ing the US societal perspective and assuming lifetime hori-
zon to capture the lifetime progression of ASCVD in adults. A
similar model to that used previously to estimate cost-
effectivenessandvalue-basedpricerangeofevolocumabusing
LDL cholesterol–lowering data from the statin trials and car-
diovascular event reduction from CTTC meta-analyses7,17 was
used.Themodel(eFigure1intheSupplement)wasusedtopre-
dict subsequent cardiovascular events and cardiovascular- or
noncardiovascular-related mortality as a function of age, sex,
LDL cholesterol level, and cardiovascular event history. The
model transition-states were adapted to match those ana-
lyzed in FOURIER.14 The model comprises mutually exclu-
sive health states that include ASCVD, 2 acute event states
(myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke for a 1-year dura-
tion), and postevent health states and their combination that
are introduced to enable the model to account for event re-
currence. In addition, distinctions are made between cardio-
vascular and noncardiovascular death. Revascularization is in-
cludedasaprocedureandnotasaseparatehealthstatebecause
it is assumed that it does not affect cardiovascular event risk
or quality of life.
Patient Population
A representative clinical practice-based population with es-
tablishedASCVDwasmodeledtoembodytheUSpatientpopu-
lation. Patients were selected from the US population–
weighted National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
basedonindividuals18yearsorolder(meanage,66years)with
a recorded atherosclerotic cardiovascular condition and LDL
cholesterol level of at least 70 mg/dL (mean, 104 mg/dL) while
receiving statin therapy (Table 1). Written informed consent
was obtained from National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey participants. The survey was approved by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics ethics review board.
The Truven MarketScan database, a large-scale database
of claims for commercially insured patients and patients with
Medicare Supplemental insurance, was used to estimate con-
temporary cardiovascular event rates for US patients with
ASCVD.15However,cardiovascular-relateddeathdatawerenot
complete in MarketScan. Cardiovascular mortality rates were
estimated by combining multiple National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Surveys death files (2004-2012) and Na-
tional Vital Statistics Report 2012.15 Rates were adjusted by
baseline LDL cholesterol levels and age and previous event
history.21 Ten-year and lifetime event rates for this popula-
tion are shown in eTable 1 in the Supplement. These rates re-
flect multiple events. For reference, the annual cardiovascu-
lar event rate (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke,
or cardiovascular death) was 6.4 per 100 patient-years in this
Key Points
Question What is the cost-effectiveness of the proprotein
convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor evolocumab in patients
with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease?
Findings In this study, a Markov cohort state-transition model
determined that adding evolocumab at current list price to
patients receiving standard background therapy was estimated to
cost $268 637 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Sensitivity and
scenario analyses demonstrated incremental cost-effectiveness
ratios ranging from $100 193 to $488 642 per quality-adjusted
life-year.
Meaning To achieve a threshold of $150 000 per quality-adjusted
life-year gained in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of at least
70 mg/dL and an annual event rate of 6.4 per 100 patient-years,
an annual net price of $9669 or a higher risk population would
need to be treated.

 US practice-based population, whereas in participants in the
FOURIER trial placebo plus standard background therapy arm,
the event rate (including multiple events) was 4.2 per 100 pa-
tient-years (eTable 2 in the Supplement).14 The noncardiovas-
cular mortality rate was assumed to be that of the general US
population.22
Intervention Effects and Model Assumptions
Hazard ratios were based on landmark analysis of the indi-
vidual end points in FOURIER of nonfatal myocardial infarc-
tion, nonfatal ischemic stroke, and coronary revasculariza-
tion, with respective risk reductions of 21%, 26%, and 16% in
the first year and 36%, 25%, and 28% beyond year 1
(Table 2), as previously published.14 Cardiovascular event
rate ratios per 38.67 mg/dL of LDL cholesterol reduction
were derived from the hazard ratios and the LDL cholesterol
reduction reported in the trial (53.36 mg/dL) and then
applied in the model (Table 2). In FOURIER, cardiovascular
mortality reduction was not observed within the first 3 years
of follow-up. In the base case, risk reduction for cardiovas-
cular mortality was set at 0% for the first 5 years and then
estimated to proportionally match the cardiovascular mor-
tality event reduction in the CTTC meta-analysis8 for overall
or more vs less intensive statin therapy when appropriate
thereafter (risk reduction 9.5% per 38.67 mg/dL LDL choles-
terol reduction) (eTable 3 in the Supplement). The 5-year
delay before the emergence of cardiovascular mortality
reduction was selected in the base case to be consistent with
findings from contemporary greater-intensity LDL
cholesterol–lowering clinical outcome trials in which cardio-
vascular mortality reduction was not observed in the first 5
years.9,27,28 Consistent with the safety profile reported in
FOURIER, among patients receiving evolocumab, 2.1% were
assumed to develop mild injection site reactions over 2
years, resulting in a small quality-of-life decrement (Table 2).
Evolocumab therapy persistence rates over time were based
on those observed in FOURIER during the first 3 years of
follow-up and then kept steady. Within-trial persistence and
adherence effects on efficacy were already reflected in the
intention-to-treat hazard ratios reported in FOURIER during
the first 3 years and modeled as not further varying.
Costs and Utilities
Directmedicalcostsassociatedwithcardiovasculareventswere
obtained through US claims data23,24 and adjusted for infla-
tion to January 2017 using the Consumer Price Index.29 Indi-
rect cost estimates were obtained from the 2017 American
Heart Association/American Stroke Association report on car-
diovascular disease burden by applying reported ratios of di-
rect and indirect costs.25 Noncardiovascular death events were
assumed to incur no costs and not vary by treatment alloca-
tion.Medicationcostofevolocumabinthebasecasewasbased
on the current wholesale acquisition cost for evolocumab,
$14 523 (list price). Additional analyses were performed based
on the estimated mean annual net cost of $10 311 (list price mi-
nus an average rebate of 29% for branded pharmaceuticals).30
The average of Red Book prices and the market share of ge-
neric simvastatin and atorvastatin were used for standard
therapy($68)andezetimibe($2780).31Additionalanalysesused

 ity estimates for cardiovascular health states were based on
results of a time tradeoff study.26
Base-Case Cost-effectiveness Analysis
The lifetime cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) ac-
crued under the 2 treatment options, evolocumab added to
standard background therapy (moderate- to high-intensity
statin with or without ezetimibe) vs standard background
therapy alone, were projected through simulation. The incre-
mental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as the in-
crementalcostperQALYgained.Theanalysisconsideredacost-
effectiveness threshold of $150 000 per QALY gained in the
base case, aligned with the American College of Cardiology/
American Heart Association statement on cost/value meth-
ods for intermediate vs low value,32 recommendations from
the World Health Organization,33 and contemporary
literature.34 The annual net value–based price to achieve an
ICER of $150 000 per QALY gained was calculated. A range of
willingness-to-pay thresholds were also considered.34,35 Ad-
ditional model outcomes included the probabilistic mean and
95% credible intervals for the net value–based price. The QALY
and costs were discounted at an annual rate of 3.0%, consis-
tent with the Second US Panel on Cost-effectiveness in Health
and Medicine recommendation.35
Sensitivity and Scenario Analyses
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to reflect uncertainty in
model inputs and to assess robustness of model outcomes. In
the deterministic sensitivity analyses, model parameter val-
ues (Table 2) were varied individually through plausible
ranges (eg, 95% confidence intervals). Probabilistic sensitiv-
ity analyses examined the combined effect of parameter
uncertainty on the model results. A sensitivity analysis was
performed using the FOURIER patient population character-
istics and cardiovascular event rates analyses. We also ana-
lyzed in the clinical practice population analyses where the
background cardiovascular event rates were 25% and 50%
higher or lower of those in US clinical practice. As a sensitiv-
ity analysis, a range of cardiovascular mortality effect sizes
were applied to assess the effect on overall results (eTable 3
in the Supplement). Additional sensitivity analyses included
extreme cases where all hazard ratios were increased or
decreased simultaneously by 1 SE.
A range of scenario analyses were considered including
modeling a 3-year, 7-year, or infinite delay of treatment effect
on cardiovascular mortality; modeling treatment effect on
myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality
based on the corresponding key secondary end point from
FOURIER; and modeling cost-effectiveness confined to
patients with ASCVD with baseline LDL cholesterol levels of
at least 100 mg/dL (mean, 130 mg/dL). A scenario analysis
was performed where the risk ratios derived from the
FOURIER key secondary end point did not vary from year 1
and subsequent years. In addition, scenario analyses with
ezetimibe priced similarly to generic statin therapy ($68),
where all patients with ASCVD were treated with ezetimibe
and statin therapy and where only the US payer perspective
was considered (no indirect costs) were performed. We also
analyzed what LDL cholesterol treatment initiation threshold
for the population would yield an ICER of $150 000 per QALY
gained at current list price and current net drug price (value-
based LDL-cholesterol treatment initiation threshold). Fur-
thermore, we determined the annual event rate thresholds
where the current list price and net price of evolocumab
would yield an ICER of $150 000.
The model was developed using Microsoft Excel 2013, ver-
sion 14.0 (Microsoft). The Impact Inventory Template and the
Reporting Checklist for Cost-effectiveness Analyses from the
Second Panel on Cost-effectiveness in Health and Medicine35
are in eTables 4 and 5 in the Supplement.
Results
In the base case using a US clinical practice patient popula-
tion, the LDL cholesterol level was at least 70 mg/dL (mean,
104 mg/dL) and the cardiovascular event rate was 6.4 per 100
patient-years with standard background therapy. In this base
case,meanlifetimecostswouldbe$234 877perpatienttreated
with standard therapy and $340 275 per patient treated with
evolocumab added to standard background therapy, with in-
cremental costs of $105 398 (Table 3; eTable 6 in the Supple-
ment). The lifetime QALY was 7.23 with standard background
therapy and 7.62 with evolocumab, with a difference in health
effects of 0.39 QALY. Compared with standard background
therapy alone, use of evolocumab at its current list price
($14 523) results in an ICER of $268 637 per QALY gained
(Table 3). If, instead, a net price of evolocumab reflecting a 29%
discount was used ($10 311), the ICER would be $165 689 per
QALY. To achieve a value threshold of $150 000 per QALY
gained, a value-based net price of $9669 annually would be
required (Table 3). The net value-based prices at ICERs of
$50 000, $100 000, $150 000, $200 000, and $250 000 per
QALY would be $5578, $7623, $9669, $11 715, and $13 760 per
year, respectively. For the FOURIER trial participants, the ICER
would be $413 579 per QALY, and the net value-based price
would be $6780 (Table 3). Net value-based prices at ICERs of
$50 000, $100 000, $150 000, $200 000, and $250 000 per
QALYwouldbe$3843,$5312,$6780,$8249,and$9718peryear,
respectively.
Sensitivity Analyses
When we varied the background cardiovascular event rates for
the US clinical practice population by 25% and 50% higher or
lower, the ICER ranged from $194 551 to $488 642 per QALY,
and the net value-based price ranged from $12 218 to $6164

Scenario Analyses
We tested various assumptions of the treatment benefit
(Table 4). A 3-year time before cardiovascular mortality ben-
efits emerge yielded an ICER of $245 066 and a value-based
net price of $10 221 per year. A 7-year delay in the cardiovas-
cular mortality treatment benefit yielded an ICER of $293 720
per QALY, and a net value-based price of $9188 per year. In the
caseofnolifetimecardiovascularmortalityreduction,theICER
was $483 800 per QALY, and the net value-based price was
$7246. This reflects the improvements in the rate of subse-
quent events, health state utilities (the quality of the life-
years), and cardiovascular disease events and procedures costs
by reducing nonfatal events, even in the absence of direct sur-
vival benefit. Additional scenarios are shown in Table 4. If all
patients were receiving ezetimibe and statin therapy, then the
ICER was $271 313. When only the US payer perspective was
integrated into the model, then the ICER was $304 392 per
QALY, and the net value-based price was $8206. At current list
price,theLDLcholesteroltreatmentinitiationthresholdforpa-
tients with ASCVD that would yield an ICER of $150 000 per
QALY was calculated to be at least 119 mg/dL (at this thresh-
old, mean LDL cholesterol level for the ASCVD population is
144 mg/dL) and at the discounted price at least 80 mg/dL (at
thisthreshold,meanLDLcholesterollevelfortheASCVDpopu-
lationis110mg/dL).TheannualeventratefortheASCVDpopu-
lation that would yield an ICER of $150 000 per QALY was cal-
culated to be 13.5 per 100 patient-years at list price and 7.1 per
100 patient-years at the discounted price.
Discussion
In this study, a model based on the clinical risk reduction dem-
onstrated in FOURIER and extrapolated over lifetime was used
to investigate the economic value of evolocumab in a US clini-
cal practice–based population of patients with established
ASCVD. This evaluation has found that evolocumab at its cur-
rent list price of $14 523, when added to standard background
therapy, including statins, in patients with established ASCVD
with a background event rate of 6.4 per 100 patient-years had
an ICER of $268 637. This ICER exceeds the threshold estab-
lished by the World Health Organization for cost-effective-
ness and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart
Association threshold for intermediate vs low value.32,33 The
ICER would be substantially higher if cardiovascular mortal-
ity benefits with evolocumab were not to emerge or if the car-
diovascular event rates were similar to those in FOURIER. Evo-
locumab therapy could meet the threshold of $150 000 per
QALY with an annual value-based price of $9669 for a popu-
lation with an event rate of 6.4 per 100 patient-years. This
evaluation provides insights as to the economic implications
of evolocumab therapy if applied to eligible patients with
ASCVD in US clinical practice.
Sensitivity and scenario analyses resulted in ICERs that,
with few exceptions, exceeded the American College of Car-
diology/American Heart Association intermediate value and
WorldHealthOrganizationcost-effectivenessthresholds.How-
ever, a value-based net annual price of $9669 would yield an
ICER of $150 000 per QALY in an ASCVD clinical practice
population.32,33 The treatment effect on cardiovascular mor-
talityinthebasecaseissupportedbydatafrommendelianran-
domization analyses demonstrating virtually identical lower
odds of coronary heart disease mortality in patients with life-
long genetically mediated lower LDL cholesterol levels either

ductase or in PCSK9.36 In the scenario that no cardiovascular
mortality benefit was to emerge, the ICER would be $483 800
per QALY gained, substantially exceeding current intermedi-
ate value and cost-effectiveness thresholds. The base case re-

 similartothoseinFOURIER,treatmentwithevolocumabwould
lead to an ICER of $413 579 and a value-based net annual price
of $6780.
Despite significantly higher medication costs, the incre-
mental reduction in cardiovascular events, corresponding re-
ductions in hospitalizations, and revascularizations resulting
from the addition of evolocumab therapy drives the ICER. In
patients with established ASCVD who, with other currently
available lipid-modifying therapies including maximally tol-
eratedstatins,requireadditionalLDLcholesterollowering,add-
ing evolocumab could facilitate improved clinical outcomes
foraconsiderableproportionofpatients.15,16Substantialpopu-
lation health improvements and further progress toward re-
duction in noncommunicable diseases could result.15 How-
ever, with an ICER of $268 637 per QALY with the current list
price, there are legitimate concerns regarding the appropri-
ate allocation of health care resources along with challenges
in coverage and access to this therapy, despite demonstration
of clinical event reduction in FOURIER. Adopting a net value-
based price of $9669 annually would be 1 potential strategy
that could affect the value proposition and willingness to pay.
Targeting a subset of patients with ASCVD who are at particu-
larly high risk for events based on clinical factors, formal risk
scores, or use of a higher LDL cholesterol treatment initiation
threshold for the addition of evolocumab therapy would be
alternative approaches to improve value and limit expen-
ditures.16 At an LDL cholesterol treatment initiation thresh-
old of at least 100 mg/dL, evolocumab therapy would be cost-
effective with an ICER of $100 193 per QALY for a US clinical
practice ASCVD population, with an event rate of 6.4 per 100
patient-years, but only at a net price of $10 311.
This study provides, to our knowledge, the first cost-
effectiveness data on evolocumab integrating the results of
FOURIER. Prior cost-effectiveness analyses of PCSK9 inhibi-
tion have been published based on the projected benefits of
LDL cholesterol lowering on clinical events, with variable
findings.15-17 A prior analysis using a similar model from a US
payer perspective suggested therapy at list price was cost-
effective for patients with established ASCVD and LDL cho-
lesterol levels of 100 mg/dL or higher.17 In contrast, a study

 usingtheCoronaryHeartDiseasePolicymodelfromaUSpayer/
healthsystemperspectiveconcludedthatPCSK9inhibitionwas
not cost-effective.16 Several methodological differences may
account for the discrepancies in these prior modeling studies
and the Coronary Heart Disease Policy model may underesti-
mate event risk overall.37,38 The policy model did not con-
sider indirect costs.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. The results should be in-
terpreted within the context of the data inputs and modeling
assumptionsused.ClinicaloutcomesdatafromFOURIERwere
limited to a median follow-up of 26 months, yet model pre-
dictions are based on the assumption that clinical benefits ex-
tend beyond the period with direct follow-up. If the clinical
benefits differ from those modeled in this study, particularly
in regards to the magnitude and timing of cardiovascular mor-
tality reductions, the cost-effectiveness findings could be af-
fected by overestimating or underestimating the cost-
effectiveness of evolocumab therapy. Cost-effectiveness
estimatescouldalsobealteredifsignificantadverseeventsma-
terialize beyond 3 to 4 years of observation to date.39 If the lev-
els of persistence with and adherence to evolocumab therapy
differ from those in FOURIER, costs and clinical effective-
ness may be affected. This economic evaluation included in-
direct costs to apply the US societal perspective, as is
preferred,32 but detailed data on indirect costs for each con-
ditional state are limited. This analysis is only applicable to US
patients with established ASCVD and is not generalizable to
primary prevention patients, other populations at lower car-
diovascular event risk, or patients outside the United States.
Conclusions
At its current list price of $14 523, the addition of evolocumab
to standard background therapy in patients with ASCVD pro-
vides a treatment option that exceeds generally accepted cost-
effectiveness thresholds. To achieve an ICER of $150 000 per
QALY gained in a US clinical practice ASCVD population with
an annual event rate of 6.4 per 100 patient-years, a price reduc-
tionwithanetannualpriceof$9669orwithanannualnetprice
of $10 311 targeting treatment in patients with LDL cholesterol
levelsof80mg/dLorhigherwouldbeneeded.FortheFOURIER
trial participants, with an annual event rate of 4.2 per 100 pa-
tient-years, a net annual price of $6780 would be necessary.
These findings highlight the need for a comprehensive disease
management approach for ASCVD that includes vigorous life-
style changes, assiduous adherence to all guideline-directed
therapies, and judicious use of new, more costly therapies.
