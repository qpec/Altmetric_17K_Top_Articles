Abstract
Antibiotic regimens often include the sequential changing of drugs to limit the development
and evolution of resistance of bacterial pathogens. It remains unclear how history of adapta-
tion to one antibiotic can influence the resistance profiles when bacteria subsequently adapt
to a different antibiotic. Here, we experimentally evolved Pseudomonas aeruginosa to six 2-
drug sequences. We observed drug order–specific effects, whereby adaptation to the first
drug can limit the rate of subsequent adaptation to the second drug, adaptation to the sec-
ond drug can restore susceptibility to the first drug, or final resistance levels depend on
the order of the 2-drug sequence. These findings demonstrate how resistance not only
depends on the current drug regimen but also the history of past regimens. These order-
specific effects may allow for rational forecasting of the evolutionary dynamics of bacteria
given knowledge of past adaptations and provide support for the need to consider the history
of past drug exposure when designing strategies to mitigate resistance and combat bacterial
infections.
Author summary
Bacteria readily adapt to their environments and can develop ways to survive and grow in
the presence of antibiotics. While many studies have investigated how bacteria evolve to
become resistant to single drugs, it is unclear how adaptation to other drugs and environ-
ments in the past affect the way bacteria adapt to new drugs and environments. In this
study, we allowed bacteria in a laboratory setting to adapt to three different antibiotics.
We first exposed wild-type susceptible bacteria to high concentrations of the three antibi-
otics individually and then exposed these populations to each of the other drugs. By track-
ing the levels of resistance to all three drugs in all of the treatments, we identified cases in
which past adaptation to one treatment influenced subsequent evolutionary dynamics
with regard to both phenotypes (levels of resistance) and genotypes (genes that became
mutated). Additionally, by allowing bacterial isolates originating from human patients to
adapt to the three drugs, we recapitulated a subset of the adaptation history-dependent
evolutionary dynamics. Overall, this study sheds light on how adaptation history in

Introduction
Antibiotic resistance is a growing healthcare concern whereby bacterial infections are increas-
ingly difficult to eradicate due to their ability to survive antibiotic treatments [1]. There have
been reported cases of resistance for nearly every antibiotic we have available [2]. Coupled
with the fact that the antibiotic discovery pipeline has slowed over the past few decades [3],
there is a dire need to find better treatment strategies using existing antibiotics that can slow
or even reverse the development of resistance.
Adaptive laboratory evolution is a technique that can be used to study and test evolutionary
principles in a highly controlled laboratory setting [4]. Microorganisms with short generation
times such as bacteria are especially amenable to adaptive laboratory evolution and can be
adapted to an environment through repeated cycles of growth in a specific media environ-
ment, dilution of the culture, and subsequent passaging into fresh media [5]. Multiple repli-
cates for each condition can be evolved in parallel to investigate the reproducibility of
evolutionary dynamics [6]. The evolutionary trajectories of the bacteria can be measured as
they adapt to different nutrients and stressors over time [7]. Whole-genome resequencing on
the evolved strains can subsequently be used to determine the mutations that occurred that
may be associated with the observed phenotypes [8,9].
Adaptive laboratory evolution can be used to study the development of antibiotic resistance
in bacterial pathogens [10]. Resistance to antibiotics is an evolutionary response of bacteria to
withstand and survive the effects of the stressor. Deliberately evolving bacteria to withstand
antibiotics through experimental evolution can yield insights into the evolutionary dynamics
and trajectories of this adaptive process [11,12]. These evolution experiments can provide a
longer-term perspective, which can yield information for the design of novel treatment strate-
gies that can reduce the rate of resistance evolution or potentially even reverse the effects of
resistance [13–15].
Recent studies have explored how adaptation to an antibiotic can cause bacteria to concur-
rently become more susceptible or more resistant to other drugs, an effect termed collateral
sensitivity or collateral resistance [14,16,17]. Collateral sensitivities between drugs have been
used to design drug cycling strategies and to explain the decreased rate of adaptation to certain
antibiotics [12,14,18–23]. Drug deployment strategies that exploit such collateral sensitivities
between pairs of antibiotics to minimize resistance evolution have been tested in vitro. A
recent study determined the collateral sensitivity drug interaction network in Escherichia coli
and demonstrated how an alternating sequential treatment of 2 reciprocal, collaterally sensitive
antibiotics can slow down the rate of resistance evolution [14]. In this drug cycling strategy,
the development of resistance to 1 drug concurrently increased the sensitivity to the second
drug, and this allowed wild-type cells to outcompete the resistant cells when exposed to the
second drug. In a different study, evolution experiments of alternating sequential therapies of
pairs of antibiotics were performed on Staphylococcus aureus, and the study showed that the
alternating treatments slowed the rate of resistance development compared to single-drug
treatments [12]. Consistent with the E. coli study, this study found that collateral sensitivities
could explain the evolutionary constraints in the cases in which alternating treatment resulted
in decreased resistance development compared to the single-drug treatment.

 Most of the prior studies that test the use of alternating antibiotic therapies to reduce the
rate of resistance development employ an adaptive laboratory evolution scheme in which the
drugs are switched at daily or subdaily intervals with the purpose of testing if rapidly changing
antibiotic environments can diminish the rate of drug-resistance adaptation [12,19,23,24]. In
this study, we expand on these prior works, but we are not focused on studying the evolution-
ary dynamics of bacteria adapted to rapidly changing drug environments. Rather, we explore
the evolutionary dynamics of sustained, longer treatments of drugs and how the development
of high levels of resistance to 1 drug influences the subsequent dynamics of sustained adapta-
tion to a second drug. In clinical settings, when antibiotic cycling strategies are employed, they
are used typically at the level of the hospital ward, and the cycling of antibiotics are often done
at monthly intervals [25,26]. The rationale here is that if resistance to 1 drug arises after fre-
quent use in a ward, switching to an antibiotic of a different class may allow resistance rates to
the withdrawn drug to stabilize or even fall, enabling the first drug to be efficiently reintro-
duced again at a later time [27]. This practice of cycling drugs of different classes over the
course of monthly intervals is done empirically, and it remains unclear how these regimens
constrain the evolutionary dynamics of antibiotic resistance development. Here, we explore
the evolutionary trajectories of bacteria as they evolve high levels of resistance to 1 antibiotic
and the subsequent trajectories as the selection pressure from the first drug is withdrawn and
replaced with the sustained pressure of a different drug. It remains unexplored how prior
adaptation to 1 drug environment affects the evolutionary dynamics of a bacterial population
during subsequent adaptation to a second drug in terms of the amount of resistance it can
potentially develop and the resistance profile of the first drug. Collateral sensitivities and collat-
eral resistances between 2 drugs have been studied in the context of adaptation to single drugs
[21], i.e., as bacterial populations evolve and become resistant to 1 drug, do the cultures con-
currently become more resistant or sensitive to other drugs? In this study, we focus not on if
bacteria become concurrently more resistant or sensitive to other drugs, but rather, if adapta-
tion to 1 drug constrains or potentiates the evolutionary dynamics to sustained adaptation to
a second drug. How does the history of adaptation to 1 drug influence the subsequent adapta-
tion to a second drug? If there are such historical dependencies, can we use this knowledge
to design sequential therapies that slow down the evolution of resistance to the drugs used?
What happens to the previously developed resistance once the drug pressure is taken away or
switched to a different drug? Do compensatory adaptations sustain the high resistance, or do
the bacteria revert and become susceptible again [28]? The answers to these questions are
important for understanding how bacteria adapt to different antibiotic environments. Bacte-
rial pathogens have complex evolutionary histories and elucidation of any historical dependen-
cies of antibiotic resistance evolution would allow for rational forecasting of future resistance
development and would aid in the design of strategies for mitigating antibiotic resistance.
Results
Adaptive evolution of P. aeruginosa to sequences of antibiotics
To test how different antibiotic-resistance backgrounds affect the subsequent adaptation
dynamics when evolved to a new antibiotic, we used a laboratory evolution approach to evolve
P. aeruginosa to all 2-drug sequences of the 3 clinically relevant drugs piperacillin (PIP), tobra-
mycin (TOB), and ciprofloxacin (CIP). In each of the experimental sequences, P. aeruginosa
was subjected to 20 days of adaptation to each drug by serially passaging parallel replicate
cultures to increasing concentrations of the drugs followed subsequently by 20 more days of
adaptation to each of the 3 drugs or to lysogeny broth (LB) media without a drug (Fig 1A).
Additional parallel replicates were adapted to LB media without a drug for 40 days as a control.

 For each drug treatment, changes in the resistance to the other 2 drugs were concurrently mea-
sured (Fig 1B). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) gradients in microtiter plates were
used to simultaneously measure the drug resistance level and to propagate the bacteria daily.
To adapt the bacteria to a drug, a sample is taken from the population from the well of the
highest drug concentration that allowed for growth (i.e., MIC/2) and then used to inoculate a
new MIC gradient. This serial dilution cycle is done daily. More explicitly, 20 μl of culture is
sampled from the well of the highest concentration that allowed for growth, then diluted in 5
ml of fresh LB media, and then this diluted culture is used to inoculate a new MIC gradient.
This dilution protocol results in a daily dilution factor of the bacterial population of 1/500
(Materials and methods, Fig 1B). S1 Data provides the estimated number of generations per
day for the evolved lineages based on the daily measurements of the OD600. For each lineage,
the OD600 values are fairly consistent from day to day, and so with a dilution factor of 1/500,
the cultures undergo approximately 9 generations of growth per daily dilution cycle (S1 Data).
We observed differences in final resistance levels to the different drugs depending on the
history of past treatments (or lack of treatments), an effect we call drug-order–specific effects
of adaptation. Our results show that a history of past drug adaptation can affect the rate at
which resistance can potentially arise when subsequently adapted to a new antibiotic.

tobramycin (TOB), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and lysogeny broth (LB) media. In the following 20 days, the 1-drug–resistant lineages were passaged further to the
first drug, as well as subpassaged to the other 2 drugs, and to LB media. (B) Bacteria were taken from the highest concentration that allowed growth
(defined as OD600 > 0.1), diluted in fresh LB, and inoculated into fresh minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) gradients, corresponding to a daily dilution
factor of 1/500. After overnight incubation, the process is then repeated.

 Furthermore, in some cases, adaptation to a second drug or to LB can partially or fully restore
sensitivity to the first drug. These observations suggest that in order to limit the rate of devel-
opment of antibiotic resistance, it is important to consider which drugs a bacterial population
may have been exposed to in the past when choosing which drugs to subsequently deploy.
The 3 drugs tested have different mechanisms of action and are clinically used to treat P.
aeruginosa infections [29]. Piperacillin is a beta-lactam that inhibits cell wall synthesis [30];
tobramycin is an aminoglycoside that binds to the prokaryote ribosome and inhibits protein
synthesis [31]; and ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone that binds DNA gyrase and inhibits
DNA synthesis [32]. We chose to study these 3 antibiotics because of their common use in the
clinical setting to treat P. aeruginosa infections [29], their diverse mechanisms of action, and
their well-studied resistance mechanisms [33]. Adaptive evolution for 20 days to these drugs
individually resulted in 1-drug–resistant mutants denoted as PIPR, TOBR, and CIPR. The Day
20 PIPR, TOBR, and CIPR populations had averages of 32-, 64-, and 64 times higher MICs to
piperacillin, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin, respectively, compared to their initial levels. To
determine if the population MICs that were measured during the course of the adaptive labo-
ratory evolution experiments were representative of individual colony MICs, we retrospec-
tively measured the MICs of cultures grown from multiple revived colonies from the saved
frozen stocks (S2 Data). Overall, 73% of the retrospectively measured MICs were within one
2-fold dilution step of the originally measured population MICs, which suggests that the
reported MIC values for each of the evolved lineages are well representative of the bacterial
populations (S1 Fig).
By following how the resistance to each of the 3 drugs changes for each of the drug
sequences (Fig 2; S2 and S3 Figs and S3 Data), we observed 3 types of drug-order–specific
effects in the MIC profiles (Fig 3). Note that for now, we focus on summarizing the different
drug-order–specific effects (as seen by the changes in drug MICs), and later, we discuss several
hypotheses for the underlying mechanisms of the drug-order–specific effects based on analysis
of the genomic mutations of the adapted lineages. In the first type of drug-order–specific
effects, adaptation to a second drug or to LB restores the susceptibility to the first drug (Fig
3A). In these experiments, we were first interested to see if the increases in MICs of the
1-drug–resistant lineages (Day 20 PIPR, TOBR, and CIPR) were permanent or transient. By
evolving them to LB and hence removing the selection pressure of the drug for 20 days, we
observed that the high MICPIP was maintained in Day 40 PIPRLB (Fig 3A [top], p = 0.80; Fig
2A), while MICTOB declines (leading to partial resensitization) in Day 40 TOBRLB (Fig 3A
[middle], p < 0.0001; Fig 2E), and MICCIP declines (although not significantly) in Day 40
CIPRLB (Fig 3A [bottom], p = 0.18; Fig 2I). Thus, for these 3 treatments, removal of the antibi-
otic pressure can maintain the high resistance or lead to resensitization in a drug-specific man-
ner. Similar trends were seen in a recent adaptive evolution study whereby P. aeruginosa was
evolved to tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, and ceftazidime,
followed by subsequent adaptation in the absence of the drug (growth medium only) to deter-
mine the effects of removing the drug selection pressure [34]. Similar to the patterns seen in
our study, they observed that the tobramycin-resistant cultures partially resensitized, the cipro-
floxacin-resistant cultures had a modest resensitization, and the 3 beta-lactam–evolved cul-
tures maintained high levels of resistance.
Next, we were interested to see if evolving the 1-drug–resistant lineages to the other 2 drugs
would show the same patterns seen as when evolved to LB. Interestingly, we saw unique out-
comes for each of the 3 lineages. When Day 20 PIPR was evolved to tobramycin, the MICPIP of
Day 40 PIPRTOBR remained high (p = 0.90), similar to how the MICPIP of Day 40 PIPRLB
remained high (Fig 3A [top]). This result suggests that subsequent tobramycin adaptation has
no role in altering the high piperacillin resistance. This specific order of drug treatments can

 Fig 3. Summary of the drug-order–specific effects. (A) The Day 20 PIPR, TOBR, and CIPR lineages were partially or fully resensitized to piperacillin
(PIP), tobramycin (TOB), and ciprofloxacin (CIP), respectively, during subsequent adaptation to the other 2 drugs and/or lysogeny broth (LB). For
example, in the top plot, a one-way ANOVA of the data shown yielded p < 0.01, suggesting that the mean MICPIP values of the 5 PIPR lineages being
compared are different. A post-hoc Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD) test then shows that the MICPIP of Day 40 PIPRCIPR is significantly less
than that of Day 20 PIPR (p < 0.05), indicating that resensitization to piperacillin occurred after subsequent ciprofloxacin adaptation but not after tobramycin
(p = 0.90) or LB (p = 0.80) adaptation. Similar types of comparisons are done for the TOBR and CIPR lineages in the middle and bottom plots, and we
observed that not every type of subsequent adaptation led to resensitization. The table above the plots summarizes which subsequent adaptations
(columns) led to the resensitization of the 3 drugs in their respective lineages (rows). (B) The MICTOB of Day 40 PIPRTOBR was less than that of Day 20
TOBR (p < 0.05, Tukey’s HSD test), while the MICTOB of Day 1 TOBR and Day 20 PIPR were comparable. This suggests that the rate of tobramycin
adaptation when there is a prior history of piperacillin adaptation is less than the rate of tobramycin adaptation when starting from the ancestor. (C) When
bacteria are adapted to 2 drugs, the order of adaptation to those 2 drugs can lead to differences in the endpoint minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs).
For example, in the first plot, adaptation to ciprofloxacin followed by piperacillin led to a higher final MICPIP than the reverse order (MICPIP of Day 40
CIPRPIPR versus Day 40 PIPRCIPR, p < 0.05) when they had initially comparable MIC values (MICPIP of Day 1 PIPR versus Day 1 CIPR). The second and
third plots show how the final levels of MICPIP and MICCIP are different when tobramycin adaptation is followed by ciprofloxacin adaptation or with the
reverse order. For all 3 panels, the asterisks denote p < 0.05 (Tukey’s HSD test), not significant (n.s.) denotes p > 0.05, and the color of the asterisks
denotes which drug MIC is being compared. In the plots, for each lineage being shown, the black bar denotes the mean of the 4 individual replicate values
(gray dots). See S3 Data for the raw data and S2 Text for the calculations of the statistical tests.

 then result in multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa cultures that are resistant to both piperacillin
and tobramycin. On the other hand, when Day 20 PIPR was evolved to ciprofloxacin, the
resulting cultures became resensitized to piperacillin (Fig 3A [top], p < 0.05), and the MICPIP
declined to levels comparable to those of the initially susceptible cultures (MICPIP of Day 1
PIPR versus Day 40 PIPRCIPR, p = 0.80), indicative of a full resensitization. Since resensitiza-
tion did not occur after subsequent adaptation to tobramycin or LB, we suspect that the subse-
quent ciprofloxacin adaptation had an active role in the resensitization to piperacillin in such a
way that tobramycin and LB did not. These results show that if a piperacillin-resistant culture
(that is also sensitive to tobramycin and ciprofloxacin) is evolved to tobramycin, multidrug
resistance can occur. However, if it is evolved to ciprofloxacin, despite the fact that ciprofloxa-
cin resistance increases, the culture becomes susceptible to piperacillin again, making pipera-
cillin a potentially rational choice for further treatment.
When Day 20 TOBR was evolved to ciprofloxacin, partial resensitization occurred
(MICTOB of Day 20 TOBR versus Day 40 TOBRCIPR, p < 10−5), and the MICTOB of Day 40
TOBR-CIPR fell to a comparable level as that of Day 40 TOBRLB (p = 0.98) (Fig 3A [middle]).
This result suggests that the resensitization seen during the subsequent ciprofloxacin adapta-
tion is not caused by the selection pressure of ciprofloxacin, but rather by the absence of the
selection pressure of tobramycin. On the other hand, evolving Day 20 TOBR to piperacillin
also led to a partial resensitization (MICTOB of Day 20 TOBR versus Day 40 TOBRPIPR,
p < 0.05) but not as much as it did when Day 20 TOBR was evolved to ciprofloxacin (MICTOB
of Day 40 TOBRPIPR versus Day 40 TOBRCIPR, p < 0.01) and LB (MICTOB of Day 40
TOBRPIPR versus Day 40 TOBRLB, p < 0.05). Because of this difference, we suspect that the
maintenance of the comparably high tobramycin resistance is a consequence of the piperacil-
lin selection pressure, since we observed that adaptation in the absence of the drug pressure
in LB led to substantially greater resensitization. This case highlights how the removal of all
drug pressures may lead to the resensitization of the culture more than with the treatment of
the culture to a new drug. In conjunction with the result that subsequent tobramycin adapta-
tion of Day 20 PIPR still maintained a high MICPIP, this case then also shows how regardless
of the order, sequential adaptation to piperacillin and tobramycin leads to multidrug resis-
tance of the 2 drugs.
Lastly, when Day 20 CIPR was evolved to piperacillin and tobramycin, both treatments lead
to a partial resensitization to ciprofloxacin (Fig 3A [bottom]). During subsequent tobramycin
adaptation, the decrease in the MICCIP from Day 20 CIPR to Day 40 CIPRTOBR (p < 0.01)
was marginally more than the decrease in the MICCIP from Day 20 CIPR to Day 40 CIPRPIPR
(p < 0.05) during subsequent piperacillin adaptation. As mentioned above, subsequent adapta-
tion of Day 20 CIPR to LB led to a decrease in MICCIP that was not statistically significant;
however, we argue that the decrease is comparable to that seen when adapted to piperacillin
and tobramycin as the final MICCIP of Day 40 CIPRLB was not significantly different than that
of Day 40 CIPRPIPR (p = 0.93) and that of Day 40 CIPRTOBR (p = 0.53). Hence, in this case,
evolution of a ciprofloxacin-resistant culture to either a different drug or to a no-drug condi-
tion led to a partial resensitization of ciprofloxacin. Interestingly, we also observed that the
resensitization that occurred during subsequent piperacillin adaptation happened more
quickly than the resensitization that occurred during subsequent tobramycin and LB adapta-
tion (Fig 2I). After 5 days of subsequent piperacillin adaptation (Day 25 CIPRPIPR), the MIC-
CIP was significantly different than that of Day 20 CIPR (p < 0.001), while this was not the case
after 5 days of subsequent tobramycin (p = 1.00) or LB (p = 0.57) adaptation. These cases in
which partial or full resensitization to the first drug occurs after adaptation to a second drug or
LB highlight opportunities in which resistance to 1 drug can potentially be reversed by treating
with a second drug or by removing the drug pressure completely.

 In the second type of drug-order–specific effects, prior adaptation to a first drug reduces
the rate of subsequent adaptation to a second drug (such that the endpoint level of resistance
to that second drug is lower compared to the amount of resistance developed when the Day 0
Ancestor is directly evolved to that second drug). We observed that evolution first to piperacil-
lin reduces the rate of subsequent evolution to tobramycin (Fig 2D and 2E). That is, the
MICTOB of Day 40 PIPRTOBR was less than that of Day 20 TOBR (Fig 3B, p < 0.05). This
observation suggests that, in some cases, different bacterial populations may evolve resistance
to a given antibiotic at different rates depending on the history of prior adaptations that the
populations have experienced. Having knowledge of prior adaptations may then potentially be
used to slow down the development of resistance to a drug if that drug is selected rationally.
Interestingly, we observed no cases in which prior drug adaptation led to an enhancement in
the rate of adaptation to a second drug.
The last type of drug-order–specific effects is when the final MIC of a drug is different after
adaptation to a 2-drug sequence compared to after adaptation to the opposite order of the 2
drugs (Fig 3C). This third type of drug-order–specific effect exists as a consequence of a com-
bination of the first type of effect (resensitization of the 1-drug–resistant lineages during subse-
quent adaptations to other drugs) and specific cases of collateral sensitivities during the
adaptation of certain lineages. First, the MICPIP was higher when piperacillin was used after
ciprofloxacin (Day 40 CIPRPIPR) compared to when piperacillin was used before ciprofloxacin
(Day 40 PIPRCIPR) (Fig 3C [top], p < 0.05). In this case, adaptation to piperacillin first led to
high levels of piperacillin resistance, and subsequent adaptation to ciprofloxacin led to the
resensitization to piperacillin as discussed before (Fig 2A). On the other hand, even though
adaptation to ciprofloxacin first led to a collateral sensitivity to piperacillin (S4A Fig [right],
p < 0.01), subsequent adaptation to piperacillin resulted in a final MICPIP comparable to that
of Day 20 PIPR (Fig 2C).
Next, we observed that during the adaptation to tobramycin followed by ciprofloxacin
and vice versa, the final MIC values of piperacillin and ciprofloxacin were different depend-
ing on the order of adaptation to the 2 drugs (Fig 3C [bottom and middle]). With regards to
the difference seen in the final MICCIP (Fig 3C [bottom], p < 0.05), the partial resensitiza-
tion to ciprofloxacin starting from Day 20 CIPR during subsequent tobramycin adaptation
(Fig 2I) resulted in the MICCIP to be less than adaptation to tobramycin first, followed by
ciprofloxacin (Fig 2H). Finally, it was interesting that even though piperacillin was not
the direct selection pressure, there was a difference in the final MICPIP level whether cipro-
floxacin adaptation occurred after tobramycin adaptation or vice versa (Fig 3C [middle],
p < 0.01). In this case, initial adaptation to tobramycin first did not affect the MICPIP (Fig
2B), but subsequent adaptation to ciprofloxacin resulted in a collateral sensitivity to pipera-
cillin (S4C Fig, p < 0.01). On the other hand, as previously mentioned, adaptation to cipro-
floxacin first initially resulted in the collateral sensitivity to piperacillin (S4A Fig [right],
p < 0.01); however, the MICPIP returned to baseline values during subsequent adaptation to
tobramycin (Fig 2C). Thus, regardless if ciprofloxacin adaptation occurred before or after
tobramycin adaptation, ciprofloxacin adaptation led to piperacillin collateral sensitivity.
However, in order to take advantage of this collateral sensitivity, ciprofloxacin adaptation
should be used after tobramycin adaptation, rather than vice versa. In a contrasting exam-
ple, we also found it interesting that while ciprofloxacin adaptation also led to collateral sen-
sitivity of tobramycin, subsequent piperacillin adaptation did not cause the MICTOB to
return to baseline levels (Fig 2F) in the manner in which subsequent tobramycin adaptation
returned the MICPIP to baseline values (Fig 2C). Altogether, these cases highlight how treat-
ing an infection with a sequence of 2 drugs can result in different resistance profiles depend-
ing on the order used.

 All the cases of collateral sensitivity that were observed occurred during ciprofloxacin treat-
ment whereby ciprofloxacin adaptation resulted in a lower MIC of piperacillin or tobramycin
compared to baseline levels (S4 Fig). First, adaptation to ciprofloxacin starting from the Day 0
Ancestor resulted in collateral sensitivity to both piperacillin (Fig 2C; S4A Fig [right],
p < 0.01) and tobramycin (Fig 2F; S4A Fig [left], p < 0.0001). Next, adaptation to ciprofloxacin
starting from both the 1-drug–evolved lineages Day 20 PIPR (Fig 2D) and Day 20 TOBR (Fig
2B) resulted in collateral sensitivity to tobramycin (S4B Fig, p < 0.01) and piperacillin (S4C
Fig, p < 0.01), respectively. These results suggest that regardless of historical background, cip-
rofloxacin adaptation results in collateral sensitivity to the other 2 drugs. While we observed
that collateral sensitivity of other drugs occurs only during ciprofloxacin adaptation, a recent
study in which P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 was evolved to different antibiotics reported that
evolution to tobramycin resulted in collateral sensitivity to piperacillin-tazobactam and cipro-
floxacin, whereas we did not observe this effect [34]. Also, this study did not observe that adap-
tation to ciprofloxacin resulted in collateral sensitivity to piperacillin and tobramycin, as we
reported here. We suspect that these inconsistences may be due to strain-specific differences
in the different P. aeruginosa strains used (strain PA14 was used in this study).
We were interested in measuring the fitnesses of the evolved lineages to see if the adapta-
tions to the different treatments altered their growth dynamics. We measured the growth
curves (OD600) of the 68 evolved replicate lineages as well as the Day 0 Ancestor in quadrupli-
cate grown in LB for 24 hours (S5 Fig). The exponential growth rates were subsequently
calculated from the growth curves (S6A Fig, S1 Text and S4 Data). While we observed many
different growth rates across the different lineages, we did not observe any correlation between
the growth rate and the change in MIC between the Day 20 1-drug–evolved lineages and the
subsequent Day 40 lineages (i.e., altered growth rates could not explain the cases in which sub-
sequent adaptation led to the maintenance of high resistance or resensitization to the first
drug) (S6B Fig and S1 Text).
Genomic mutations of adapted lineages
We hypothesized that genomic mutations acquired during adaptive evolution contributed to
the drug-order–specific effects observed in the MIC profiles. We sequenced genomes of the
Day 0 Ancestor, Day 20 PIPR, TOBR, CIPR, and LB Control lineages and the Day 40 1-drug–
and 2-drug–evolved lineages, as well as the LB Control lineages. Genome sequencing of the
Day 20 and Day 40 mutants revealed a total of 201 unique mutations across the 56 samples
consisting of 77 SNPs, 31 insertions, and 93 deletions (Fig 4; S7 Fig, S1 and S2 Tables). The 77
SNPs were found within 49 genes. Two SNPs were synonymous, and 6 were intergenic. To test
how representative the sequencing results were of the mutant populations, we used PCR and
Sanger sequencing to test for the presence of specific mutations in multiple colonies of differ-
ent lineages after reviving the lineages from the saved frozen samples. We used the primers
from S3 Table to test for the presence of 1 mutation from 1 replicate of each lineage, with 4 col-
onies of each lineage. Overall, while there may be limited heterogeneity in the populations
with respect to a few of the mutations, the large majority of the mutations were homogeneous
in the populations and fixed within the lineages (S1 Text).
While some genes were mutated during evolution to all drugs, other mutations were drug-
specific and were related to the drugs’ primary mechanisms of action as would be expected (S4
Table). Genes encoding transcriptional regulators for multidrug efflux pumps were commonly
mutated during evolution to all 3 drugs (mexC, mexR, mexS, nalC, nalD, nfxB, parS) [35]. Ribo-
somal proteins (rplJ, rplL, rpsL, rplF) [36] and NADH dehydrogenase subunits (nuoB, nuoG,
nuoL, and nuoM) [37,38] were frequently mutated during tobramycin evolution. The most

treatment during the first 20 days. The color of the plotted mutation denotes during which treatment the mutation occurred. For example, a blue dot on a
yellow track denotes a mutation in a Day 40 CIPRTOBR replicate lineage that occurred during tobramycin adaptation (i.e., between Day 21 and Day 40). For
the Day 40 1-drug–evolved lineages, circles denote mutations that occurred during the first set of 20 days, and triangles denote mutations that occurred
during the second set of 20 days. Large rectangles denote large genomic deletions. Numbers in parentheses next to gene names indicate the number of

 commonly mutated gene was fusA1, which encodes elongation factor G and was mutated in 11
different replicate lineages adapted to tobramycin. fusA1 has been observed to be mutated in
clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa [39–41], as well as in adaptive evolution studies to aminoglyco-
sides in P. aeruginosa [34] and E. coli [12,16,18]. Mutations in fusA1 may also contribute to
altered intracellular (p)ppGpp levels, which may modulate virulence in P. aeruginosa [41].
Mutations in gyrA and gyrB were observed during ciprofloxacin evolution, but none were
observed in parC and parE (the other genes of the quinolone resistance-determining region
[29]). Lastly, genes encoding peptidoglycan synthesis enzymes (dacC, mpl) and beta-lactamase
regulators (ampR) were mutated during piperacillin treatment. Many of these genes have also
been observed to be mutated during human host adaptation of P. aeruginosa [42], highlighting
the importance of several of these clinical resistance determinants (S1 Text).
We next analyzed the genomic mutations to see how the historical context affects which
mutations occur during adaptation to a drug. For example, how do the mutations that occur
during adaptation to piperacillin only (Day 20 PIPR and Day 40 PIPR) compare to the muta-
tions that occur during piperacillin adaptation when there is a prior history of adaptation first
to tobramycin (Day 40 TOBRPIPR) or ciprofloxacin (Day 40 CIPRPIPR)? To this end, we first
categorized the genes in which mutations occurred into 23 broad categories based on the avail-
able literature and on the PseudoCAP functional classifications from the Pseudomonas
Genome Database [43] (Table 1). Next, for each lineage, we tallied the number of times a gene
in a functional category was mutated across the 4 biological replicates for each of the lineages
(Fig 5). For a complete list of genes in each functional classification and descriptions of the
genes, see S2 Table.
We observed several general trends in the genes mutated during adaptation to the 3 drugs,
depending on their historical context. In the lineages adapted to piperacillin, we saw history-
dependent trends in the mutated genes that were related to multidrug efflux pumps (Fig 5,
dashed-black box). While all the piperacillin-adapted lineages had mutations in genes related
to the MexAB-OprM efflux pump (which is the primary efflux pump of piperacillin [44]) such
as nalD and mexR (whose products repress the expression of mexAB-oprM [45]), the Day 40
CIPRPIPR lineage had additional mutations in the structural subunit genes of the other efflux
pumps MexCD-OprJ (mexC) and MexEF-OprN (mexF). Lastly, no mutations in genes related
to the MexXY-OprM pump were observed in any of the piperacillin-adapted lineages. With
regard to adaptation to piperacillin only, most of the mutations that occurred in genes related
to MexAB-OprM occurred within the first 20 days, with only a few additional mutations
occurring between Day 21 and 40. Regardless of historical context, metabolic and cell wall
genes tended to be frequently mutated in piperacillin-adapted lineages, whereas metabolic and
cell wall genes did not seem to be consistently mutated across the tobramycin-adapted and cip-
rofloxacin-adapted lineages. This result is perhaps due to the fact that the primary target of
piperacillin is cell wall (peptidoglycan) synthesis, which is largely a metabolic process. Interest-
ingly, we also observed that the lineages adapted only to piperacillin (Day 20 PIPR) sustained
large chromosomal deletions that were not seen in the lineages in which there was prior tobra-
mycin or ciprofloxacin adaptation (Day 40 TOBRPIPR and Day 40 CIPRPIPR). We discuss and
explore the potential implications of these large deletions below.
The tobramycin-adapted lineages consistently had mutations occur in ribosomal subunit
genes and other ribosomal machinery genes, regardless of historical context. In the lineages
adapted only to tobramycin, mutations in genes related to the ribosome, membrane, energy,
and NADH dehydrogenase tended to occur by Day 20, followed by mutations in efflux pump–
related genes by Day 40. The mutations in genes related to membrane, NADH dehydrogenase,
and energy likely reflect the unique requirement of the proton-motive force for the uptake of
aminoglycoside antibiotics [46], and the mutations occurring during tobramycin adaptation

 may contribute to the resistance by reducing the proton-motive force [16]. While we observed
mutations in the NADH dehydrogenase genes in the lineages adapted only to tobramycin, we
saw no such mutations in the lineages in which prior piperacillin or ciprofloxacin adaptation
occurred (Day 40 PIPRTOBR and Day 40 CIPRTOBR). Also, while efflux pump–related genes
were mutated in the Day 40 TOBR and Day 40 CIPRTOBR lineages, no such mutations were
seen in the Day 40 PIPRTOBR lineages in which prior adaptation to piperacillin occurred (Fig
5, dashed-purple boxes).
The mutations in the ciprofloxacin-adapted lineages were fairly consistently distributed
regardless of historical context. For all ciprofloxacin-adapted lineages, mutations were seen in
genes related to DNA/RNA synthesis as expected, as well as in genes related to membrane, fla-
gella, efflux pumps, metabolism, and transcriptional regulators. Mutations related to the Mex-
AB-OprM, MexCD-OprJ, and MexEF-OprN efflux pumps (mostly in genes encoding negative
regulators of the pumps) are seen in the ciprofloxacin-adapted lineages, reflecting the ability of
these different pumps to extrude ciprofloxacin; however, no mutations were seen in genes

 related to MexXY-OprM, even though this pump is also known to contribute to fluoroquino-
lone resistance [44]. Further experiments in measuring the gene expression of the different
efflux pumps may help elucidate the roles that these pumps play in contributing to the differ-
ent drug-order–specific effects.
Next, we sought to determine if the patterns in mutated genes could explain the mecha-
nisms of some of the drug-order–specific effects that were observed in the MIC time courses.
We first discuss the cases of resensitization or maintenance of high resistance in which the
1-drug–evolved lineages were subsequently adapted to the other 2 drugs or to LB (Fig 3A).
While subsequent adaptation of Day 20 PIPR to LB and tobramycin maintained high piperacil-
lin resistance, subsequent adaptation to ciprofloxacin led to full resensitization to piperacillin
(Fig 3A [top]). We hypothesize that these differences stem from the different efflux pump-
related genes that were mutated in these lineages (Fig 5, dashed-purple boxes). Evolution of
the Day 0 Ancestor to piperacillin resulted in 2 different SNPs in nalD, and 1 SNP in mexR
across the 4 biological replicates of Day 20 PIPR, likely leading to the overexpression of the
MexAB-OprM efflux pump [45]. We suspect that MICPIP remained high during subsequent
adaptation to LB and tobramycin due to continued overexpression of MexAB-OprM.
However, when Day 20 PIPR was adapted to ciprofloxacin, several mutations occurred in
genes related to other efflux pumps, including 1 in mexA, 2 in nfxB, and 2 in mexS (Fig 5,
dashed-purple boxes). In particular, mexS encodes a negative regulator of the expression of
MexEF-OprN, and mutations in this gene likely lead to the overexpression of the efflux pump
[47]. Interestingly, expression of MexEF-OprN has been observed to correlate inversely with
the expression of MexAB-OprM [47,48]. Hence, we suspect that the resensitization to pipera-
cillin when Day 20 PIPR was subsequently adapted to ciprofloxacin may be have been due to a
concurrent decrease in MexAB-OprM expression (leading to reduced piperacillin efflux) as
MexEF-OprN expression increased. That is, it is possible that the mutations that occurred dur-
ing ciprofloxacin adaptation that led to the overexpression of MexEF-OprN negated the effects
of the mutations that occurred during prior piperacillin adaptation that led to overexpression
of MexAB-OprM. Furthermore, we observed no mutations in efflux pump–related genes in
Day 40 PIPRTOBR (Fig 5, dashed-purple boxes), which supports the notion that because no
mutations occurred, which would have negatively correlated with the expression of MexA-
B-OprM, expression of this efflux pump was maintained throughout the subsequent adapta-
tion to tobramycin, and hence the MICPIP remained high.
We observed that subsequent adaptation of Day 20 TOBR to LB and ciprofloxacin resulted
in a partial resensitization to tobramycin, and that while subsequent adaptation to piperacillin
also led to a significantly lower MICTOB, it was not as low as that of Day 40 TOBRLB and
grouped according to the final (or only) drug that the lineage was adapted to in order to compare how historical context affects how
often genes in the functional classes are mutated. For example, the first 4 columns (with red shading) correspond to the frequency
of genes mutated in the lineages that were adapted to piperacillin only (Day 20 PIPR and Day 40 PIPR) and piperacillin after prior
adaptation to a first drug (Day 40 TOBRPIPR and Day 40 CIPRPIPR). Note that the data in the Day 40 PIPR column correspond to
additional mutations that occurred (between Day 21 and 40) and do not double count the ones from Day 20 PIPR column. As an
example of how different genes are mutated during piperacillin adaptation under different historical contexts, the cells outlined by
the dashed-black box show that regardless of historical context, all lineages that underwent piperacillin adaptation had mutations in
genes related to the MexAB-OprM efflux pump. However, only the lineage that had prior ciprofloxacin adaptation (Day 40
CIPRPIPR) had mutations in genes related to the MexCD-OprJ and MexEF-OprN efflux pumps. Lastly, none of the piperacillin-
adapted lineages had mutations in genes involved in the MexXY-OprM efflux pump. The cells outlined by the dashed-purple boxes
show that while subsequent adaptation of Day 20 PIPR to ciprofloxacin (Day 40 PIPRCIPR) resulted in several mutations in genes
involved in efflux pumps, subsequent adaptation to tobramycin (Day 40 PIPRTOBR) resulted in no mutations in genes involved in
efflux pumps. The corresponding mutations that occurred are explicitly listed at the bottom. See the main text for more details of
how this difference may play a role in the resensitization to piperacillin during subsequent ciprofloxacin adaptation of Day 20 PIPR.
See S1 Table for the complete list of mutations and S2 Table for descriptions of the mutated genes.

 TOBRCIPR (Fig 3A [middle]). In this case, the partial resensitization during subsequent adap-
tation to LB may be attributable to adaptive resistance of aminoglycosides in P. aeruginosa.
Adaptive resistance is a phenomenon in which resistance to a drug is transiently induced in
the presence of the drug, and resistance recedes upon the removal of the drug [49]. In contrast
to acquired resistance, which is mediated through genetic mutations, adaptive resistance is
explained by phenotypic alterations that allow for temporary increases in resistance. P. aerugi-
nosa is known to exhibit adaptive resistance to aminoglycosides [50,51], and it is primarily
mediated through up-regulation of MexXY-OprM during drug exposure and subsequent
down-regulation after the removal of the drug [52]. We suspect that the partial resensitization
during subsequent ciprofloxacin adaptation is also a consequence of adaptive resistance once
the tobramycin selection pressure is removed. We further speculate that during the initial
adaptation to tobramycin, the increase in tobramycin resistance was a combination of adaptive
resistance and acquired resistance from accumulation of the mutations as seen in Day 20
TOBR. Thus, the resensitization during subsequent LB and ciprofloxacin adaptation was not a
full resensitization but rather a partial one, perhaps reflecting the remaining contribution of
the acquired resistance. Lastly, with regards to Day 40 TOBRPIPR, it is unclear how subsequent
piperacillin adaptation seemingly resulted in the maintenance of high MICTOB compared to
that of Day 40 TOBRLB and TOBRCIPR. We hypothesize that the subsequent piperacillin adap-
tation somehow counteracted the resensitization effects of adaptive resistance, even when the
tobramycin selection pressure was removed.
The mechanism of ciprofloxacin resensitization when Day 20 CIPR was subsequently
adapted to LB, piperacillin, and tobramycin remains unclear (Fig 3A [bottom]). While rever-
sion of aminoglycoside sensitivity has been the most characterized case of adaptive resistance
in P. aeruginosa, other studies have suggested that adaptive resistance may be prevalent in
other classes of antibiotic classes as well, and that it may be mediated by epigenetic processes
such as methylation and stochastic gene expression [53], particularly affecting the expression
of efflux pumps [54]. It could be possible that adaptive resistance partially explains the resensi-
tization to ciprofloxacin. We also note that qualitatively, there was much more variability in
the MIC time courses between the individual replicates of the CIPR lineages, as seen by the
larger error bars in Fig 2I, compared to that of the PIPR (Fig 2A) and TOBR (Fig 2E) lineages.
Taken together, further investigation of the partial ciprofloxacin resensitization is needed.
While we observed clear cases of collateral sensitivity develop to piperacillin and tobramy-
cin during the course of ciprofloxacin adaptation (S4 Fig), other adaptive evolution studies of
P. aeruginosa evolved to ciprofloxacin showed mixed results. In one study, the adaptation of P.
aeruginosa ATCC 27853 to ciprofloxacin showed no change in the MIC of 3 different beta-lac-
tams (including piperacillin-tazobactam), nor of tobramycin [34]. In another study, while no
statistical significances were assigned, adaptation of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to ciprofloxacin
appeared to result in slight collateral sensitivities to piperacillin-tazobactam and tobramycin in
some of their replicates. Nevertheless, in our study, we hypothesize that the collateral sensitiv-
ity to piperacillin and tobramycin during ciprofloxacin adaptation is attributable to the muta-
tions seen in nfxB (which encodes a transcriptional repressor that regulates MexCD-OprJ
[55]) in the Day 20 CIPR lineages. Three of the Day 20 CIPR replicates had deletions in nfxB
(15, 13, and 16 base pairs), likely resulting in the inactivation of NfxB and concomitant up-reg-
ulation of MexCD-OprJ and increased ciprofloxacin resistance [56]. In fact, nfxB mutants
have been reported to be hypersusceptible to certain beta-lactams and aminoglycosides
[57,58].
Lastly, with regards to the decreased rate of tobramycin adaptation given a history of prior
piperacillin adaptation (Fig 3B), we attribute this effect to the large chromosomal deletions
that were sustained in 3 of the 4 Day 20 PIPR replicates. The consequences of these deletions

 are discussed in more detail in the subsequent sections of the manuscript. In summary, based
on the genomic mutations, we have presented our interpretations of potential mechanisms
that contribute to the drug-order–specific effects. These include how historical context can
influence the frequency of mutations in certain genes, the varying contributions of adaptive
and acquired resistance to total resistance, and specific cases of inverse correlation of the
expression of different efflux pumps. While mutations are likely not the sole determinants of
the differences [34,59], many of the observed genomic mutations can partially explain the
drug-order–specific effects.
Drug history dependence of pyomelanin hyperproduction
One striking mutation we observed was that 3 of the 4 replicates of Day 20 PIPR (Day 20 PIPR-
1, -2, and -3) had large, approximately 400 kbp deletions (corresponding to approximately 6%
of the genome) in a conserved region of the chromosome (Fig 4 [large red rectangles]; S5
Data), suggestive of selective genome reduction [60–63], and have been associated with
directed repeats [64] and inverted repeats [65] at the boundaries of the deletions. These large
deletions were also fixed in the corresponding Day 40 PIPRTOBR, Day 40 PIPRCIPR, and Day
40 PIPRLB lineages. Interestingly, the 3 PIPR lineages with these large deletions hyperproduced
the brown pigment pyomelanin during piperacillin evolution, and this visually observable phe-
notype also persisted when evolved to tobramycin (PIPRTOBR), ciprofloxacin (PIPRCIPR), and
LB (PIPRLB). The loss of hmgA as part of the large chromosomal deletions correlates exactly
with the pyomelanin phenotype of these lineages. Indeed, hmgA mutants of P. aeruginosa
hyperproduce pyomelanin [66]. This observation shows that evolving to piperacillin results in
a high probability of sustaining large deletions spanning hmgA, which results in the pyomela-
nogenic phenotype. However, when we evolved the Day 20 TOBR and CIPR lineages to pipera-
cillin to yield the Day 40 TOBRPIPR and Day 40 CIPRPIPR lineages (4 replicates each), none of
them became pyomelanogenic, suggesting that prior history of tobramycin or ciprofloxacin
adaptation leads to a lower propensity of becoming pyomelanogenic when subsequently
evolved to piperacillin. Interestingly, 1 of the Day 20 TOBR replicates became pyomelanogenic
when subsequently evolved to ciprofloxacin (Day 40 TOBRCIPR-2). Hence in this study, pyo-
melanin hyperproduction is a consequence of piperacillin and ciprofloxacin evolution, yet the
likelihood to evolve this visually striking and observable phenotype depends on the history of
prior drug adaptation.
While the 3 PIPR lineages that produced pyomelanin were not significantly more resistant
to piperacillin than the nonpyomelanogenic PIPR lineage, pyomelanin-producing strains have
been observed clinically [60] and have been shown to be more persistent in chronic lung infec-
tion models [66]. We tested the reproducibility of this example of a phenotypic dependence on
the history of drug adaptation with a higher throughput approach. Starting with clonal popula-
tions of Day 0 Ancestor, Day 20 TOBR, and Day 20 CIPR, we seeded 92 replicate populations
of each lineage into microplates, and we used a 96-pin replicating tool to serially propagate
these populations and evolve them to increasing concentrations of piperacillin daily. The line-
ages that started from Day 0 Ancestor had the highest propensity to become pyomelanogenic
(Fig 6A) compared to lineages starting from Day 20 TOBR (Fig 6B) or Day 20 CIPR (Fig 6C).
Still, certain lineages starting from Day 20 TOBR and Day 20 CIPR did also produce pyomela-
nin, albeit with less propensity than starting from Day 0 Ancestor (Fig 6D; S8–S10 Figs).
Drug-order–specific effects in clinical isolates
To explore the relevance of our laboratory evolution results clinically, we tested for the drug-
order–specific MIC evolutionary dynamics in clinical isolates. We first tested the evolutionary

 dynamics of clinical isolates that were resistant to piperacillin but susceptible to tobramycin
and ciprofloxacin. We evolved 3 piperacillin-resistant clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa to piper-
acillin, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin for 10 days and tracked how the piperacillin resistance
changed in these lineages. If the results from the adaptive evolution experiment applied to
these piperacillin-resistant clinical isolates, then we would expect that evolving to tobramycin
would not affect the high piperacillin resistance, but evolving to ciprofloxacin would restore
susceptibility to piperacillin. As mentioned previously, evolving Day 20 PIPR to LB did not
result in a reduction of MICPIP, which suggests that the resensitization to piperacillin when
Day 20 PIPR was evolved to ciprofloxacin was a consequence of the switch to the ciprofloxacin
drug pressure. Of the 3 isolates we tested, the evolutionary dynamics of 2 of these isolates
matched these expectations (Fig 7; S11 Fig and S3 Data). After normalizing to Day 1 MIC val-
ues, the MICPIP after 10 days of ciprofloxacin adaptation was significantly less than the MICPIP
Fig 6. Wild-type P. aeruginosa has a higher propensity to become pyomelanogenic when evolved to piperacillin compared to tobramycin-
resistant (TOBR) and ciprofloxacin-resistant (CIPR) lineages. We tested how common it was for piperacillin adaptation to lead to pyomelanin
hyperproduction under different historical backgrounds. Ninety-two replicates of (A) Day 0 Ancestor, (B) Day 20 TOBR-3, and (C) Day 20 CIPR-1 were
passaged daily to low, increasing concentrations of piperacillin for 10 days. Photographs of Day 7 of passaging show how the Ancestor had a higher
propensity of evolving the pyomelanin phenotype during piperacillin treatment compared to evolution of Day 20 TOBR-3 and Day 20 CIPR-1. The complete
set of photographs for all lineages tested is shown in S8–S10 Figs. (D) The number of visibly brown wells was tracked daily over the course of the 10 days of
piperacillin evolution. Overall, Day 0 Ancestor had the highest propensity to become pyomelanogenic during piperacillin evolution, followed by Day 20 CIPR-
3 and Day 20 TOBR-2. Interestingly, the number of brown wells for these lineages did not increase monotonically over time, suggesting heterogeneity in
these populations, and that nonpyomelanogenic subpopulations outcompeted the pyomelanogenic ones in the wells that transiently turned brown.

 after 10 days of LB adaptation in isolate #2 (Fig 7B, p < 0.05) and in isolate #3 (Fig 7C,
p < 0.001), indicating resensitization to piperacillin during ciprofloxacin adaptation. This
observation suggests that the MIC evolutionary dynamics we observed are not limited to labo-
ratory strains of P. aeruginosa and may be observed in diverse strains of P. aeruginosa, includ-
ing those originating from human patients. Note that these 3 clinical isolates were isolated
from different patients, and their phylogenetic relatedness between each other and to the labo-
ratory PA14 strain used in our study is untested. In isolate #1, there was no significant differ-
ence in the normalized MICPIP values after 10 days of adaptation to tobramycin, ciprofloxacin,
and LB (Fig 7A, p = 0.237, one-way ANOVA). Interestingly, this isolate evolved higher levels
of piperacillin and ciprofloxacin resistance than the other 2 isolates (S11 Fig and S3 Data),
which suggests the possibility that adaptation to ciprofloxacin in these higher piperacillin-
resistant cultures could still result in a restoration of piperacillin susceptibility.
In the next set of evolution experiments, we investigated the role that the large chromo-
somal deletions play in a drug-order–specific effect. We had observed that compared to the
Day 20 PIPR replicate that did not have a large deletion, the 3 Day 20 PIPR replicates with the
large deletions, when subsequently evolved to tobramycin, developed less tobramycin resis-
tance (S3 Data and S12 Fig). This observation suggests that the large deletions were involved in
reducing the subsequent rate of tobramycin resistance evolution given a prior history of piper-
acillin adaptation. A recent study isolated 4 pairs of clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, in which
each pair consisted of a pyomelanogenic (PM) isolate and a “parental wild-type (WT)” non-
pyomelanogenic isolate [64]. In each of the 4 pairs, the only genomic difference between the
pyomelanogenic (denoted APM, BPM, CPM, and DPM) and its corresponding parental wild-type
isolate (denoted AWT, BWT, CWT, and DWT) was the presence of large chromosomal deletions
that overlap with parts of the deletions seen in Day 20 PIPR-1, -2, and -3 (Fig 8E; S5 Data).
Indeed, all of the large deletions encompass hmgA, whose loss accounts for the pyomelanin
Fig 7. Clinical isolates with high piperacillin resistance become resensitized to piperacillin following adaptation to ciprofloxacin. To see
if we could recapitulate the adaptation dynamics of the minimum inhibitory concentration of piperacillin (MICPIP) when Day 20 PIPR was evolved to
tobramycin and ciprofloxacin, we evolved 3 piperacillin-resistant clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa to piperacillin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, and
lysogeny broth (LB). (A) While the first isolate did not show restoration of piperacillin sensitivity during ciprofloxacin evolution as anticipated, (B and
C) the other 2 isolates recapitulated this effect. In clinical isolates #2 and #3, the relative changes in the MICPIP when the isolates were evolved to
ciprofloxacin were significantly different from the relative changes when evolved to LB at Day 10 (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). For each of
the 3 isolates, a one-way ANOVA was first performed on the Day 10 MICPIP values of the lineages evolved to LB, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin.
Error bars show SEM of 3 replicates per treatment. See S2 Text for the calculations of the statistical tests and S11 Fig for the original,
prenormalized data.

 phenotype. We used these 4 pairs of clinical isolates to test the hypothesis that the large dele-
tions play a role in lowering the rate of tobramycin resistance evolution. We evolved the 4
pairs of isolates to tobramycin using the same daily serial passaging technique used throughout
this study and tracked the MICs of tobramycin, piperacillin, and ciprofloxacin over the course
of 15 days (Fig 8; S3 Data and S13 Fig). At the end of the 15 days, we saw that APM, BPM, and
CPM had lower relative increases in MICTOB, compared to AWT (p < 0.01), BWT (p < 0.05),
and CWT (p < 0.05), respectively (Fig 8A–8C). These data provide support for the idea that the
large chromosomal deletions do indeed play a role in reducing the rate of tobramycin adapta-
tion, and potentially even in limiting the maximum level of tobramycin resistance that can be
developed comparatively. In the case of the fourth pair, we saw that DWT and DPM had compa-
rable increases in MICTOB over the course of the tobramycin adaptation (Fig 8D, p = 1.00). It
can be speculated that some combination of the presence or loss of specific genes in DPM led to
this evolutionary trajectory that is different from the other 3 pyomelanogenic isolates. We
would also like to point out that within each pair, the “WT” and “PM” isolates vary in initial
Day 1 MICTOB. The BPM and BWT pair was the most disparate pair, as BPM had a much lower
MICTOB than BWT (S13 Fig).
Interestingly, a recent study also observed large genomic deletions spanning hmgA when P.
aeruginosa PAO1 was evolved to meropenem, which is another beta-lactam antibiotic [65].
Fig 8. Clinical isolates with large chromosomal deletions have lower rates of tobramycin (TOB) resistance evolution. To see if large
chromosomal deletions played a role in reducing the rate of tobramycin resistance evolution, 4 pairs of clinical isolates were evolved to tobramycin. Each
pair consisted of a pyomelanogenic (PM) isolate with a large deletion, and its corresponding nonpyomelanogenic parental isolate that does not have a
large deletion (“wild-type” [WT]) [64]. As anticipated, we observed that (A) APM, (B) BPM, and (C) CPM had lower relative increases in the minimum
inhibitory concentration of tobramycin (MICTOB) compared to AWT, BWT, and CWT, respectively. However, (D) DWT and DPM had comparable relative
increases in MICTOB. Asterisks denote p < 0.05 of a two-sample t test after the raw MIC values were normalized by subtracting the average Day 1
MICTOB for each evolved lineage. See S2 Text for the calculations of the statistical tests. Error bars show SEM of 3 replicates per treatment (except BPM-
2, which had 2 replicates). (E) The large deletions of the 4 “PM” isolates are located in the same region as the deletions of Day 20 PIPR-1, -2, and -3, and
all of the deletions encompass hmgA, whose loss causes the hyperproduction of pyomelanin. See S13 Fig for the original, prenormalized data.

 These mutants were also pyomelanogenic. The large deletions in both our study as well as this
recent study also span mexX and mexY, which encode portions of the efflux pump that is a sig-
nificant determinant of aminoglycoside resistance [67]. The loss of these genes in the 3 PIPR
replicates may partially explain why subsequent tobramycin adaptation is limited compared to
the replicate that did not sustain the large deletion.
Discussion
This study presents evidence of how the evolutionary history of bacterial adaptation to antibi-
otics can complicate strategies for treating infections and for limiting the further development
of multidrug resistance. Exposing bacteria to fluctuating environments has been shown to be a
potentially good strategy for slowing down the development of resistance [12,19,68]. More
broadly, mechanisms of memory and history dependence in bacterial systems are being
uncovered to better understand the dynamics of bacterial survival and adaptation in changing
environments [69–71]. For example, a recent study showed that the survival of Caulobacter
crescentus in response to a high concentration of sodium chloride stress depended on the dura-
tion and timing of an earlier treatment of a moderate concentration of sodium chloride and
that this effect was linked to delays in cell division, which led to cell-cycle synchronization
[72]. Another study described what they call response memory, which is when a gene regula-
tory network continues to persist after the removal of its external inducer. The study showed
that in E. coli, lac induction transiently continued when the environment was switched from
lactose to glucose, which may be beneficial when the environment fluctuates over short time-
scales [73]. The results of those studies as well as the results from this study challenge the
notion that bacteria respond solely to their present environment. Bacteria can encounter dif-
ferent stressors over time such as osmotic, oxidative, and acidic stress, and other studies have
looked at how adaptation to 1 stressor protects the bacteria against other stressors [7,74].
Another example of bacteria adapting to changing environments is how P. aeruginosa, which
can be found in the natural environment in the soil and water, can readily adapt to a human
host under the right conditions and consequently become pathogenic [75].
There are several factors involved in the emergence of antibiotic resistance that are clinically
important that are not considered in this study. We have not taken into account any patho-
gen/host interactions, such as the role of the immune system. We also do not take into consid-
eration the pharmacokinetics of the drug and the time-dependent fluctuation of drug
concentration as experienced by the bacteria in a human-host environment. Furthermore, the
dosages of clinical regimens are typically much higher than the wild-type MIC, and the evolu-
tionary dynamics of the bacteria under these conditions may be different from those seen in
our study, in which the drug pressure is slowly increased over time. We neglect to consider the
role of horizontal gene transfer, which is a common mechanism of antibiotic resistance trans-
fer, and focus rather on the role of de novo mutations acquired during adaptation. Because of
the nature of the serial passaging method, we may be selecting for fast growers that may not
necessarily have mutations that confer the most amount of resistance in terms of the MIC. We
used a strong selection pressure in this study by propagating from the highest concentration of
drug that showed growth, but it has been shown that weak antibiotic selection pressure can
greatly affect the adaptive landscape [76,77]. Lastly, these bacteria were evolved to 1 antibiotic
at a time, and we do not know how different mutant lineages would adapt if competed against
each other. It would be interesting in the future to conduct competition experiments to mea-
sure the fitness of the different lineages with respect to each other.
While adaptive evolution of clinical isolates suggests that the drug-order–specific effects
are clinically relevant, actual clinical studies must be performed to test the true clinical

 applicability of these effects. A major challenge that still needs to be addressed is how to trans-
late the results of in vitro adaptive evolution experiments to effective therapies that can be used
in a clinical setting [78]. For example, while we observed that piperacillin adaptation often led
to the large chromosomal deletions and concomitant pyomelanin hyperproduction, the clini-
cal isolates that had the large deletions (Fig 8) were not necessarily resistant to piperacillin. On
the other hand, the other set of clinical isolates, which did have resistance to piperacillin, did
not have the large deletions (Fig 7). Disparities between the phenotypic and genotypic adapta-
tions such as this will need to be studied further in terms of strain-specific differences, actual
history of antibiotic exposure, and other factors that are beyond the scope of this study.
Despite these caveats, there are several key factors of this study that provide confidence in
the claims made. We saw consistency in the parallel replicates for the treatment lineages. An
interesting exception is Day 40 PIPRTOBR-4, which had a higher final tobramycin resistance
compared to Day 40 PIPRTOBR-1, -2 and -3, which we believe is attributed to the large geno-
mic deletions seen in the first 3 replicates but not in the fourth replicate. We observed parallel
evolution in which several genes were mutated independently across multiple lineages, and
overall, there were less than 15 mutations per 20 days of evolution, which suggests positive
selection. Furthermore, many of the mutated genes are also observed in clinical isolates of P.
aeruginosa, further giving credence to the clinical relevance of these mutations.
As mentioned previously, studies that have looked at alternating treatments of antibiotics
have primarily looked at the effects of rapid switching, typically at daily or subdaily intervals.
One of such recent studies evaluated how E. coli responded to 136 different sequential treat-
ments of subinhibitory concentrations of doxycycline and erythromycin, with each treatment
consisting of 8 “seasons” of 12-hour-long adaptation periods to 1 of the drugs [19]. Using final
optical density as an endpoint metric, the study found that 5 of the sequential treatments could
clear the bacteria at the end of the eighth season. Interestingly, one of those 5 successful treat-
ments consisted of 4 seasons of erythromycin, followed subsequently by 4 seasons of doxycy-
cline. On the other hand, the treatment consisting of 4 seasons of doxycycline followed by 4
seasons of erythromycin did not manage to clear the bacteria at the end of 8 seasons. While the
experimental setup is much different compared to that of this present study in terms of organ-
ism, antibiotics used, duration of treatment, and endpoint metric, these 2 treatments (4 sea-
sons of erythromycin then 4 seasons of doxycycline and vice versa) are quite analogous to the
types of treatments tested in our present study. The fact that these authors found a difference
in the outcomes of this pair of opposite sequential treatments may suggest that drug-order–
specific effects similar to those presented in our study may play a role in the evolutionary
dynamics of their experiments.
Cycling between 2 drugs that exhibit collateral sensitivity to one another has been pro-
posed and tested as a strategy to slow down the rate of resistance development [14]. Studies
that have systematically tested for collateral sensitivities across a variety of antibiotics in E.
coli have consistently discovered that when E. coli is adapted to drugs of the aminoglycoside
class, it develops collateral sensitivity to several other drugs of different classes including
beta-lactams, DNA synthesis inhibitors, and protein synthesis inhibitors [14,16,77]. In our
present study, we tested 1 aminoglycoside (tobramycin), and we did not observe any collat-
eral sensitivity arise to piperacillin or ciprofloxacin during adaptation to tobramycin.
Instead, we saw collateral sensitivity to piperacillin and tobramycin arise as P. aeruginosa
was adapted to ciprofloxacin, which is a DNA synthesis inhibitor. While we only tested 1
drug in each of 3 drug classes, the dissimilarity of collateral sensitivity profiles between those
studies and this present study may highlight how collateral sensitivity profiles may be organ-
ism-specific and drug-specific. Further supporting this idea, these prior studies also showed
that while adaptation to drugs of the aminoglycoside class as a whole tended to lead to

 collateral sensitivity to other drug classes, not every aminoglycoside drug that was tested
induced the same collateral sensitivity profiles.
While we did observe cases of collateral sensitivity, the main focus of our study was not to
look at how resistance profiles to other drugs concurrently change during adaptation to 1
drug, but rather to see how adaptation to 1 drug influences the future evolutionary dynamics
as the resistant population adapts to a new drug. Additionally, we wanted to see how adapta-
tion to the second drug affected the resistance profile of the drug that the bacteria originally
developed resistance to. Our sustained drug adaptation scheme can be thought of as being
more akin to month-long antibiotic cycling at the level of the hospital ward or the environ-
ments that bacteria in persistent chronic infections are exposed to. The history-dependent evo-
lutionary dynamics presented in this study highlight the complexity of bacterial adaptation to
multidrug therapies, serve as a framework for forecasting evolutionary trajectories based on
genetic and phenotypic signatures of past adaptation, and ultimately help elucidate our funda-
mental understandings of the evolutionary forces that drive resistance adaptation.
Asymmetrical evolutionary responses in changing environments have been studied in
terms of collateral sensitivity/resistance [14,16], temperature [79], other abiotic stresses [7],
and in cancer treatments [80]. Here, we present the concept of drug-history–specific effects in
multidrug resistance adaptation, whereby the history of adaptation to 1 antibiotic environment
can influence the evolutionary dynamics during subsequent adaptation to another antibiotic
environment. These history-specific effects have direct clinical implications on optimizing
antibiotic treatment strategies to slow and prevent the emergence of dangerous multidrug-
resistant bacterial pathogens.
Materials and methods
Ethics statement
The set of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates collected from the University of Virginia Health Sys-
tem (presented in Fig 7) were deidentified, did not require Institutional Review Board
approval for their use, and were anonymized. The Hocquet P. aeruginosa clinical isolates
(which were originally collected by the authors of the Hocquet study [64]; presented in Fig 8)
also did not require Institutional Review Board approval for their use and were anonymized.
Experimental study design
We evolved, in parallel, 4 independent replicates for each lineage in the primary adaptive evo-
lution experiment and 3 independent replicates for each of the clinical isolates to balance the
statistical power of the conclusions with the technical feasibilities of the daily serial propaga-
tions. In the primary adaptive evolution experiment, we concluded the 1-drug evolution at the
end of 20 days because the resistance levels of the evolved lineages to their respective drugs
were saturated or close to saturated at that point. The clinical isolates from Fig 7 and from Fig
8 were evolved for 10 and 15 days, respectively, because the similarities and differences of the
drug-specific effects to those of the primary adaptive evolution experiment were readily appar-
ent at that point.
Media, growth conditions, and antibiotics
MIC plates were made daily using the broth microdilution method with the standard 2-fold
dilution series [81]. LB was used as the growth medium for all experiments (1% tryptone, 0.5%
yeast extract, 1% NaCl). Antibiotics tested include piperacillin sodium, tobramycin, and cipro-
floxacin HCl (Sigma). Aliquots of 1 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml antibiotic stocks were made by

 diluting the antibiotic powders in LB and were stored at −20˚C. New frozen drug aliquots
were used on a daily basis.
Adaptive laboratory evolution
A frozen stock of P. aeruginosa PA14 was streaked on an LB agar plate, and a single colony was
inoculated into 4 ml of LB, which was then grown overnight at 37˚C, shaking at 125 RPM.
This antibiotic-susceptible culture, denoted as the Day 0 Ancestor, was diluted to an OD600 of
0.001 (approximately 106 CFU/ml) and then inoculated into 3 identical MIC plates consisting
of concentration gradients of piperacillin and tobramycin. A sample of the ancestor was saved
in 25% glycerol and stored at −80˚C. The 3 MIC plates were used to serially propagate cultures
evolved to LB media, piperacillin, and tobramycin, with 4 biological replicates per condition.
Wells for growth control (media + culture) and sterility control (media) were included in each
MIC plate. For adaptation to LB media, bacteria were sampled from the growth control well.
MIC plates were placed in a plastic container (to prevent evaporation) and incubated at 37˚C
with shaking at 125 RPM (Thermo Scientific MaxQ 4000). MIC plates were incubated daily
for approximately 23 hours.
At the end of incubation, growth in the MIC plates was determined using a plate reader
(Tecan Infinite M200 Pro). Growth was defined as OD600 > 0.1 after background subtraction.
We recorded the MIC of each lineage for each drug, which was defined as the lowest antibiotic
concentration tested that did not show growth (S1 and S3 Data). To propagate, cultures were
passaged from the highest concentration that showed growth (i.e., MIC/2) from the corre-
sponding MIC drug gradient. For adaptation to LB, cultures were passaged from the growth
control well that contained only LB without any drug. For each culture to be passaged, the cul-
ture was first diluted by a factor of 1/250 in fresh LB (e.g., 20 μl of the culture was diluted in 5
ml of LB), which was then inoculated in fresh piperacillin and tobramycin drug gradients in
the new day’s MIC plate. Wells of the MIC plate thus contained 100 μl of double the final con-
centration of the antibiotic and 100 μl of the diluted culture. Hence, the cultures were diluted
by a total factor of 1/500 daily. Daily samples were saved in 25% glycerol and stored at −80˚C.
For Day 21, the piperacillin and tobramycin evolved cultures were subcultured in additional
MIC plates such that they could subsequently be evolved to tobramycin and piperacillin,
respectively.
A similar protocol was used to establish the ciprofloxacin-evolved lineages (CIPR). Starting
with a clonal population of the Day 0 Ancestor, 4 replicates were established and propagated
daily under ciprofloxacin treatment for 20 days. CIPR was then subpassaged to piperacillin and
tobramycin to establish the CIPRPIPR and CIPRTOBR lineages in addition to continued cipro-
floxacin evolution.
To establish the PIPRCIPR and TOBRCIPR lineages, bacteria from the frozen stocks of Day
20 PIPR and TOBR were revived on LB agar plates, and clonal populations were evolved to cip-
rofloxacin to establish these lineages. Similarly, to establish the PIPRLB, TOBRLB, and CIPRLB
lineages, bacteria from the frozen stocks of Day 20 PIPR, TOBR, and CIPR were revived on LB
agar plates, and clonal populations were evolved to LB.
Lastly, the MIC to ciprofloxacin was retrospectively measured for the Control, PIPR, TOBR,
PIPRTOBR, and TOBRPIPR lineages. Frozen stocks were revived and plated on LB agar plates.
The notation for the day numbering is such that Day X PIPR means X days exposure to pipera-
cillin. For consistency, stocks were revived from Days 0 (Ancestor), 5, 10, 15, 19, 20, 25, 30, 35,
and 39 for Control, PIPR, and TOBR. One day of exposure to ciprofloxacin would yield Days 1,
6, 11, 16, 20, 21, 26, 31, 36, and 40 MICs to ciprofloxacin. For PIPRTOBR and TOBRPIPR,
stocks were similarly revived from Days 20, 25, 30, 35, and 39 and exposed to ciprofloxacin to

 measure Days 21, 26, 31, 36, and 40 MICs to ciprofloxacin. S3 Data shows the MICs to pipera-
cillin, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin, respectively, for all the lineages. Note that not all drug
MICs were measured on a daily basis for all lineages.
During analysis of the mutations, we deduced that there were some cross-contaminations
between replicates in a few lineages. Namely, we saw sets of mutations that were identical in 2
replicates. We believed that the most likely explanation was that the following 7 lines were
cross-contaminated sometime between Day 21 and Day 40: CIPRPIPR-3, CIPRPIPR-4, TOBR-1
CIPRTOBR-1, CIPRTOBR-2, CIPRTOBR-4, and CIPR-3, where the number denotes the repli-
cate. To redo these lineages, the corresponding Day 20 replicate frozen stocks were revived on
LB agar plates. Then clonal populations were used to redo the propagation as described before.
For example, CIPR-3 was evolved to piperacillin for 20 days to redo CIPRPIPR-3. We per-
formed Sanger sequencing of replicate-specific mutations (S3 Table) on the Day 40 mutants to
confirm successful propagation of the cultures.
Whole-genome sequencing
Frozen samples of Day 0 Ancestor, Day 20 Control, PIPR, TOBR, CIPR, Day 40 Control, PIPR,
TOBR, CIPR, PIPRTOBR, PIPRCIPR, TOBRPIPR, TOBRCIPR, CIPRPIPR, and CIPRTOBR were
streaked on LB agar plates and incubated at 37˚C. Agar plates were submitted to Genewiz
Incorporation for sequencing service. A single colony from each plate was chosen for DNA
extraction, library preparation, multiplexing, and sequencing using 101-bp paired-end reads
with the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Reads were aligned to the reference P. aeruginosa
PA14 genome (NC_008463.1) with coverage ranging from 113X to 759X. This large range is
due to the fact that we submitted samples for sequencing in 3 batches and had different num-
bers of samples for each batch but had relatively the same number of reads per batch. Never-
theless, the coverage was more than sufficient to identify the SNPs, insertions, and deletions
in the genomes. The sequencing reads for Day 0 Ancestor and the 56 drug-evolved lineages
are available via the NCBI SRA database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra), accession number
SRP100674, BioProject number PRJNA376615.
Reads were aligned and mutations were called using the breseq pipeline [82] using default
settings. All reported mutations were visually inspected by viewing the read alignments in IGV
and the breseq output files, and mutations with less than 80% frequencies were not counted.
The full list of mutations is presented in S1 and S2 Tables. The circos software package [83]
was used to plot the mutations by genomic position for Fig 4 and the positions of the large
chromosomal deletions in Fig 8.
We confirmed some of the mutations using Sanger sequencing. For each of the Day 20
PIPR, TOBR, and CIPR replicates, we chose 1 mutation each to confirm (S3 Table). We also
used these to confirm that replicates were not contaminated before submitting them for
whole-genome sequencing. These mutations were also confirmed in each of the Day 40 line-
ages that were derived from the Day 20 PIPR, TOBR, and CIPR replicates.
Reproducing drug-history dependence in the pyomelanin phenotype
during piperacillin evolution
Clonal populations of Day 0 Ancestor, Day 20 TOBR-1, -2, -3 and -4, and Day 20 CIPR-1, -2, -3,
and -4 were grown in LB starting from the frozen samples. These cultures were diluted in LB to
OD600 of 0.001. On Day 1, in 96-well plates, 100 μl of the diluted cultures were inoculated with
100 μl of 4 μg/ml piperacillin (to yield a final concentration of 2 μg/ml piperacillin). Ninety-two
wells were used to establish independent replicate populations exposed to piperacillin. Cultures
were incubated at 37˚C with shaking at 125 RPM. On Day 2, replicate populations were

 passaged using a 96-pin replicator tool (V&P Scientific, VP246, 100–150 μl per pin) into 200 μl
of 4 μg/ml piperacillin. This protocol was continued until Day 10 with a final concentration of
20 μg/ml piperacillin. For each plate, 2 wells were used as sterility controls (only LB), and 2
wells were used as growth controls (LB with bacteria, without drug). Photographs were taken
daily (S8–S10 Figs), and the number of visibly brown wells was recorded.
Testing for drug-order–specific evolutionary dynamics in clinical isolates
Three clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa with high piperacillin resistance and low tobramycin
and ciprofloxacin resistance were obtained from the University of Virginia Health System and
were evolved to the 3 drugs in the same manner as the main adaptive evolution experiment
starting from frozen samples. These isolates were first confirmed to actually be P. aeruginosa
with PCR by using primers that specifically amplify the 16S rRNA region of P. aeruginosa [84].
Three replicates of each isolate were evolved to each of the 3 drugs for 10 days, and their MICs
to the 3 drugs were measured as before. In separate subsequent experiments, the 3 clinical iso-
lates were evolved to LB with 3 replicates each. The MICPIP was measured for 10 days (S3
Data). This measurement was done by inoculating into piperacillin concentration gradients to
measure the MICPIP but sampling and passaging from the “growth control” well (LB with bac-
teria, without drug) to adapt to LB.
The 4 pairs of clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa from the Hocquet study [64] were evolved to
tobramycin for 15 days with 3 parallel replicates each, with the exception of BPM, which had 2
replicates due to cross-contamination in the third replicate. The MICs for piperacillin and cip-
rofloxacin were also measured every 5 days (S3 Data). At the end of the 15 days of evolution,
primers amplifying part of the hmgA gene were used to check for the presence of the gene in
the “WT” isolates and the absence of the gene in the “PM” isolates (S3 Table).
Statistical significance of drug-order–specific effects in MIC profiles
All statistical comparisons of MIC values were performed on the log2 transformed values.
Unless noted otherwise, one-way ANOVAs were performed on the MICs of the relevant line-
ages. If the p-value from the ANOVA was less than 0.05, a post-hoc Tukey’s honest significant
difference (HSD) multiple comparisons test was then performed to determine which pairs of
treatments were significantly different from each other. The Tukey’s HSD tests report 95%
confidence intervals for the true mean difference for each pairwise comparison. If the confi-
dence interval does not contain 0, then the 2 groups being compared have significantly differ-
ent means at the p = 0.05 level. To also assess the comparisons using nonparametric statistic
tests, Kruskwal-Wallis tests followed by post-hoc Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests were also
performed. All of the Kruskal-Wallis tests yielded comparable results to the one-way ANOVA
at the alpha = 0.05 significance level, and the conclusions are the same for the key comparisons
that drive the results highlighted in the manuscript. For a complete set of calculations, see S2
Text.
For the comparisons presented in Fig 3, treatments being compared consist of those listed
on the x-axis of each graph in the figure. For the comparisons presented in Fig 7, the raw MIC
values for each lineage were first normalized by subtracting the average Day 1 MIC of each of
their respective lineages. For each of the 3 clinical isolates, a one-way ANOVA and a Kruskal-
Wallis test were performed on the Day 10 MICPIP values of the lineages evolved to LB, tobra-
mycin, and ciprofloxacin (piperacillin-adapted lineages were excluded in the comparisons).
The Tukey’s HSD test and Dunn’s test were then performed to see if the Day 10 MICPIP values
of the lineages evolved to tobramycin and ciprofloxacin were significantly different from the
lineages evolved to LB. For the comparisons presented in Fig 8, the raw MIC values for each

 lineage were first normalized by subtracting the average Day 1 MIC of each of their respective
lineages. A two-sample t test and a Wilcoxon rank sum test were performed for the Day 15
MICTOB values of the “WT” and “PM” lineages evolved to tobramycin in each of the 4 pairs of
isolates. Calculations were done in MATLAB R2016b, using the functions “anova1” for one-
way ANOVA, “multcompare” for Tukey’s HSD test, “ttest2” for two-sample t test, and “rank-
sum” for the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The Kruskal-Wallis test was done with the “kruskal.test”
command in R, and the Dunn’s test was done with the “posthoc.kruskal.dunn.test” command
with the PMCMR R package [85].

S1 Fig. Distribution of retrospective MIC measurements. Minimum inhibitory concentra-
tion (MIC) measurements were performed using 4 colonies per lineage replicate to test the
MICs of the frozen permanent stocks. S2 Data shows which MICs were measured retrospec-
tively for the different lineage replicates and the values of the original and retrospectively mea-
sured MICs. The histogram shows the distribution of the difference between the retrospective
and original MICs for the 320 retrospectively measured MICs. Overall, 234 of the 320 (73%)
retrospectively measured MICs were within one 2-fold dilution step of the originally measured
MIC on either direction (−1, 0, and 1 on the x-axis).

S2 Fig. Summary of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) time courses. This figure
summarizes the data presented in Fig 2 of the main text. The Day 1, Day 20, and Day 40 log2
MIC values (μg/ml) of piperacillin (PIP), tobramycin (TOB), and ciprofloxacin (CIP) are
shown for all the evolved lineages of the main adaptive evolution experiment. The values are
the average of 4 replicates per lineage (S3 Data). For each lineage, the left, middle, and right
boxes denote the MICPIP, MICTOB, and MICCIP, respectively. The color intensity is normalized
by the minimum and maximum MIC of each drug across all the lineages. For example, for log2
MICPIP, the lowest value is 1.5, which is seen in Day 40 CIPR, and the highest log2 MICPIP is
9.5, which is seen in Day 40 PIPR. The color of the arrow denotes the treatment.

S3 Fig. Visualization of drug-order–specific effects and quantification of the changes in
minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs). All values shown are the averages of 4 replicates
(S3 Data). (A) The MICs of the 3 drugs for Days 1, 20, and 40 for all treatments are plotted in
3D MIC space to show how the MIC profiles change over the course of adaptation. Day 1
MICs are denoted by the triangles. A “nonright angle” indicates a change in resistance to 1 (or
more) of the other drug(s). The color/style of the line indicates the treatment and is labeled as
such. (B to D) 2D projections of (A). Labels for the lines carry over from (A). (E) Changes in
average MICs for all drugs for all treatments are plotted on a single axis to better facilitate
quantitative comparison. Here, red, blue, and yellow lines denote MICs to piperacillin (PIP),
tobramycin (TOB), and ciprofloxacin (CIP), respectively.

 S4 Fig. Collateral sensitivity of piperacillin (PIP) and tobramycin (TOB) during ciproflox-
acin (CIP) adaptation. (A) Collateral sensitivities to tobramycin (left) and piperacillin (right)
were observed during the evolution starting from Day 0 Ancestor to ciprofloxacin. While there
were no statistically significant changes in MICTOB and MICPIP after 20 days of evolution to
LB in the Control, there were significant decreases after 20 days of evolution to ciprofloxacin.
Similarly, (B) there was a significant decrease in MICTOB when Day 20 PIPR was subsequently
adapted to ciprofloxacin, (C) and in MICPIP when Day 20 TOBR was subsequently adapted to
ciprofloxacin. For all 3 panels, the asterisks denote p < 0.05 (Tukey’s HSD test), n.s. denotes
p > 0.05, and the color of the asterisks denotes which drug minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC) is being compared. In the plots, for each lineage being shown, the black bar denotes the
mean of the 4 individual replicate values (gray dots). See S2 Text for the calculations of the sta-
tistical tests and S3 Data for the raw MIC data.

S5 Fig. Growth curves of evolved lineages. The OD600 was measured over the course of 24
hours for the 68 evolved replicate lineages (17 lineages of 4 biological replicates each) as well as
the Day 0 Ancestor in quadruplicates grown in lysogeny broth (LB). Note that because of the
pyomelanin hyperproduction, replicates 1, 2, and 3 of the PIPR and PIPR-derived lineages
reach higher final OD600’s than the replicate 4 lineages as is apparent in the curves above (as
discussed in the main text).

S6 Fig. Analysis of growth rates of the evolved lineages. (A) The growth rates were calculated
from the growth curves presented in S5 Fig. The means and standard deviations of the 4 repli-
cates for each of the replicate lineages are shown. (B) The correlation between the growth rates
of the Day 40 lineages (x-axis) and the change in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of
the corresponding Day 20 lineages (y-axis) was calculated. The data suggest no correlation
between growth rate and the degree to which the MIC changes from Day 20 to Day 40. For
example, the 4 red crosses show the growth rates of Day 40 PIPRTOBR-1, -2, -3, and -4 on the
x-axis plotted against the log2 MICPIP of Day 20 PIPR-1, -2, -3, and -4 minus the log2 MICPIP
of Day 40 PIPRTOBR-1, -2, -3, and -4, respectively on the y-axis. See S4 Data for the growth
rate data.

S11 Fig. Evolutionary dynamics in clinical isolates with high piperacillin (PIP) resistance.
Three clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa with high piperacillin resistance were evolved to pipera-
cillin, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin to test if we could recapitulate the evolutionary dynamics
seen in MICPIP of PIPR, whereby evolution to ciprofloxacin would cause MICPIP to decrease,
while evolution to tobramycin would not. We were able to see this result recapitulated in iso-
late #2 and isolate #3, but not in isolate #1 (see main text). Interestingly, isolate #1 was able to
be evolved to higher levels of piperacillin resistance and ciprofloxacin resistance compared to
the other 2. Thin lines show the individual time courses of 3 replicates per treatment, and bold
lines show their averages. The dotted line in the first row shows the mean MICPIP of Day 1
Control to emphasize that the clinical isolates are resistant to piperacillin at Day 1. Error bars
show SEM for the 3 replicates for each lineage. See S3 Data for the raw numerical data.

S12 Fig. Drug history-dependence in MICTOB and large deletions in PIPR. The resistance
levels to tobramycin for individual replicates are plotted for Day 20 PIPR and Day 40 PIPR-
TOBR. The replicates denoted with the filled-in circles have large deletions in their genome,
while the replicate denoted by the open circle does not. We see that the replicates of Day 20
PIPR with the large chromosomal deletions develop less resistance to tobramycin than the rep-
licate that does not have the deletion. See S3 Data for the raw numerical data.
(TIF)
S13 Fig. Evolutionary dynamics in clinical isolates with large chromosomal deletions. Four
pairs of clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa were evolved to tobramycin. Each pair of isolates (col-
umns) consists of a pyomelanogenic isolate (PM) that has a large deletion, and a parental iso-
late from which the PM isolate is derived (wild-type [WT]). In each pair, the only genetic
difference is the presence of a large chromosomal deletion in the PM isolate. The top, middle,
and bottom rows show the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the isolates to
tobramycin, piperacillin, and ciprofloxacin, respectively, as they adapt to tobramycin. Thin
lines show the individual time courses of 3 replicates per treatment (with the exception of BPM,
which has 2 replicates), and bold lines show their averages. Error bars show SEM for the 3 rep-
licates (2 for BPM) for each lineage. See S3 Data for the raw numerical data.
