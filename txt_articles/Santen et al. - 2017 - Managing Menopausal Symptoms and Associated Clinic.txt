Objective: Review evidence to guide management of menopausal signs and symptoms in women
after breast cancer and make recommendations accordingly.
Evidence: Randomized controlled clinical trials, observational studies, evidence-based guidelines,
and expert opinion from professional societies.
Background: Symptoms and clinical problems associated with estrogen depletion—sleep disorders,
vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA), vasomotor symptoms (VMS), mood changes, depressive symptoms,
cardiovascular disease, osteopenia, and osteoporosis—confront the estimated 9.3 million breast
cancer survivors globally.
Recommendations: Following breast cancer, women should not generally be treated with men-
opausal hormone therapy or tibolone but should optimize lifestyle. Women with moderate to
severe symptoms may benefit from mind–brain behavior or nonhormone, pharmacologic therapy.
The selective serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors and gabapentenoid agents improve VMS
and quality of life. For osteoporosis, nonhormonal agents are available. Treatment of VVA remains
an area of unmet need. Low-dose vaginal estrogen is absorbed in small amounts with blood levels
remaining within the normal postmenopausal range but could potentially stimulate occult breast
cancer cells, and although poorly studied, is not generally advised, particularly for those on
aromatase inhibitors. Intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone and oral ospemiphene have been
approved to treat dyspareunia, but safety after breast cancer has not been established. Vaginal
laser therapy is being used for VVA but efficacy from sham-controlled studies is lacking. Therapies
undergoing development include lasofoxifene, neurokinin B inhibitors, stellate ganglion blockade,
vaginal testosterone, and estetrol.
Conclusions: Nonhormone options and therapies are available for treatment of estrogen depletion
symptoms and clinical problems after a diagnosis of breast cancer. Individualization of treatment is
essential. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 102: 3647–3661, 2017)

arly diagnosis and concomitant initiation of more
effective cancer treatments have reduced the death
rate from breast cancer by 38% from 1989 to 2014 (1, 2).
The 5-year survival rate in developed countries is now

 has now reached 3.1 million in the United States and is
estimated to be approximately 9.3 million worldwide (3,
4). Note that the incidence of new breast cancers
worldwide in 2008 was 1.38 million with an estimate of
approximately 9.3 million survivors. This estimate is
based on the ratio of new cases to survivors in the United
States (231,000 new cases/3.1 million survivors) reduced
by an estimated factor of 0.5 to account for higher
mortality outside of North America and Western Europe
(3, 4). In Western countries, approximately 43% are $65
years old and approximately 25% are #50 years old at
diagnosis. The numbers of survivors are increasing due to
the reduction in disease specific death rates since 1989.
Early detection in developed countries has enhanced the
number of women free of lymph node metastases; the 5
year survival rate for these women is 99% in comparison
with 84% if lymph nodes are positive (3).
A large proportion of women experience menopausal
symptoms or clinical manifestations of estrogen deficiency
during treatment of their breast cancer oraftercompletion of
therapy (5, 6). The specific symptoms and clinical challenges
differ based on menopausal status prior to initiation of
cancer treatment and therapeutic agents used. For example,
premenopausal women treated with chemotherapy can
develop ovarian insufficiency and severe menopausal
symptoms as well as infertility resulting from toxic effects of
chemotherapeutic agents on the ovary (7). Postmenopausal
women treated with aromatase inhibitors (AIs) may expe-
rience arthralgia, accelerated bone loss, and an increased
incidence of osteoporotic fractures as a result of markedly
suppressed estrogen levels (i.e.,,2 pg/mL) (8–10). They may
also experience a severe form of vulvovaginal atrophy
(VVA) with significantly higher rates of vaginal dryness
(16.3%) and dyspareunia (17.8%) compared with women
taking tamoxifen (8.4% and 7.5%, respectively) (11–13).
The constellation of signs and symptoms related to
estrogen deficiency has prompted a variety of studies of
menopause management in breast cancer survivors (5, 7,
14–20). However, the lack of randomized placebo-
controlled trials (RCTs) in this population has limited
the evidence upon which to base therapeutic decisions.
Consequently, written guidelines to address menopause
management in women during and after treatment of
breast cancer have not sufficiently focused on treatment
of this subgroup of women. To address this gap, the
writing group (C.A.S., S.R.D., A.G., M.A.L., J.V.P., and
R.J.S.) of the Endocrine Society Guidelines on manage-
ment of menopausal symptoms (13) was prompted to
write a review focusing on current and future approaches
to management of menopausal symptoms and sequelae in
women after breast cancer.
The prevalence of estrogen-deficiency symptoms in
women after breast cancer ranges from 79% to 95% (6,
21–27) and is higher than in women without breast
cancer (6, 22). Survivors report more sleep disturbance
(P
, 0.01),
difficulty
concentrating
(P
,
0.01),
muscular/joint pain (P , 0.01), crying (P , 0.01) and
irritability (P , 0.01), and vasomotor symptoms (VMS;
P , 0.01) (28). These differences may reflect the rapidity
of the menopause transition and the magnitude of es-
trogen deficiency exacerbated by AI therapy. Illustrative
data originate from a follow-up study of women with
breast cancer no longer on therapy and 6 years on average
after diagnosis (6).In the group of women ages 50 to 59,
72.8% reported VMS, and 80.8% sexual symptoms (6).
The prevalence of these symptoms was lower in women
younger than age 50 and older than 59 but the symptoms
were still frequent (i.e., 50% to 60%) (6, 19). The authors
reported that breast cancer survivors had significantly
higher vasomotor domain (P # 0.002) and sexual do-
main (P # 0.004) scores than community controls (6),
indicating more bothersome symptoms. Weight gain is
also a common problem associated with breast cancer
therapy (29).
Specific components of the problem
Both pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer survivors
often experience moderate to severe VMS and sleep
disturbances with related fatigue, mild depressive
symptoms, and mood changes (26). Arthralgia, osteo-
penia, osteoporosis, and related fractures occur pre-
dominantly in postmenopausal women as does VVA
and associated dyspareunia (11, 12, 28, 30, 31). Less
common problems include weight gain, symptomatic
osteoarthritis and intervertebral disk degeneration, de-
generative skin changes, radiation- and chemotherapy-
related cardiovascular disease, and reduced quality of life
(11, 12).
Strategies for Management
Key principles are to determine (a) the severity of the signs
and symptoms related to estrogen deficiency and (b) the
degree of bother to the patient. This allows treatment to
be individually tailored based on these assessments. For
mild symptoms or maintenance of health, lifestyle
modifications or over the counter options may be suffi-
cient. Moderate or severe signs or symptoms usually
require pharmacological management.
Lifestyle modifications
Amelioration of symptoms
Women with mild VMS frequently do not need
pharmacotherapy but do benefit from lifestyle changes

Menopause in Breast Cancer Survivors

 (32). Simple behavioral measures such as lowering of room
temperature, using portable fans, dressing in layers that
can be easily shed, avoiding triggers (such as spicy foods
and stressful situations) and likely exercise, may help re-
duce the number of hot flashes (13, 32, 33). A Cochrane
review provided supportive evidence that exercise results
in a reduction in hot flashes but suggested that additional
randomized trials are needed to resolve existing contro-
versy (34). Whereas a recent RCT provided evidence that
exercise training decreases hot flashes (35), a pooled
analysis of six studies reported no benefit from aerobic
exercise (36). Diet may modify the incidence of VMS (37).
Loss of 10% or more of body weight, as part of a healthy
dietary intervention may significantly reduce VMS (37).
Use of nonpharmacologic agents such as soy, black co-
hosh, flaxseed, remifemin, equol in equol-producers, and
vitamin E have been reported to be beneficial for VMS,
primarily when mild (13, 38, 39). However, RCT evidence
of efficacy is mostly lacking and safety has not been firmly
established in any population, much less in women who
have had breast cancer. Of potential concern are products
that may have some degree of weak estrogenic actions.
Recent research emphasis has been on the develop-
ment of nonpharmacologic therapies of VMS. Cognitive
behavioral strategies which include stress management,
relaxation, deep breathing, and yoga have been tested in
clinical trials with varying results (12, 13, 33). Hypnosis
appears to be promising based on recent randomized
trials (40). Another approach, stellate ganglion block
with a local anesthetic, provides improvement in hot
flashes but has more potential risks (41). Acupuncture
may be another effective procedure although sham
acupuncture is also effective (20, 42, 43).
Overall health and survival benefit
Increased physical activity, weight reduction, and
cessation of smoking and alcohol are important for breast
cancer survivors based on evidence that these steps may
provide objective benefit (44). Specifically, physical ac-
tivity improves postmenopausal women’s balance, body
composition, muscle strength, and bone health; improves
mood (45); reduces cardiovascular risk (46, 47); and,
potentially, reduces falls contributing to osteoporotic
fractures (47). As obesity, independent of treatment, is
associated with a poorer prognosis after breast cancer,
including women with early disease, normalization of
body weight is to be encouraged (48). Smoking cessation
reduces mortality and improves quality of life (49). These
lifestyle improvements may also benefit the metabolic
syndrome (50). Adherence to a Mediterranean diet has
been shown to decrease the incidence of breast cancer,
particularly estrogen receptor negative cancer, and could
reduce the incidence of second breast cancers (51).
Another lifestyle modification is to optimize vitamin D
levels so as to maintain bone health (52). A Cochrane
meta-analysis (53) concluded that supplementation of
vitamin D and calcium in older patients reduces fracture
risk [odds ratio = 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI),
0.80 to 0.99]. An Institute of Medicine (IOM) report (54,
55) stated that raising low levels to normal is beneficial,
whereas no benefits accrue from increasing Vitamin D
levels above 50 ng/mL. Disagreement exists as to what
levels constitute vitamin D deficiency. As defined by the
IOM, deficiency represents a level below which rickets or
osteomalacia occurs, namely ,10 to 20 ng/mL (25 to 50
nmol/L), and normal levels are 20 ng/mL and above (56).
The Endocrine Society Guidelines consider deficiency to
be ,20 ng/mL, insufficiency to be 20 to 29 ng/mL, and
normal to be $30 ng/mL (57). The IOM suggests daily
supplementation
of
vitamin
D
with
600
IU
for
women ,70 years and 800 IU for those older. Although
vitamin D intoxication is rare unless supplementation
exceeds 10,000 IU daily, a recent detailed IOM report
suggests that levels above 50 ng/mL may be associated
with cardiac toxicity (56). Selected recent data suggest
that levels of vitamin D may correlate with overall sur-
vival (58). Calcium supplementation is currently con-
troversial, but postmenopausal women need 1200 mg of
calcium, ideally from diet, to maintain bone health during
menopausal transition.
General advice
All breast cancer survivors should be advised to
modify their lifestyles to include smoking cessation,
losing weight (if indicated), limiting or avoiding alcohol,
maintaining adequate levels of vitamin D and calcium,
eating a healthy diet, and participating in regular physical
activity (59).
Management of moderate or severe signs
and symptoms
VMS
Hot flashes and night sweats have been categorized as
mildly, moderately, or severely bothersome depending on
presence of sweating or disruption of usual activity (32).
Previous opinion held that hot flashes resolve within 5 to
10 years after menopause onset in most women. How-
ever, recent data suggest that this symptom can continue
for 15 years or more in as many as 33% of women with
natural menopause (60). Women taking tamoxifen may
experience severe flushing, which leads to stopping the
treatment. Although the most effective treatment of
moderate to severe VMS is the use of menopausal hor-
mone therapy (MHT) (12, 13), clinical guidelines con-
sider this approach contraindicated in women with a

 history of breast cancer based on existing but limited
RCT evidence. Early meta-analyses based on observa-
tional data reported this approach to reduce breast cancer
recurrence in breast cancer survivors (61). Later, more
critical assessments have suggested that selection bias
may have confounded this conclusion (62). Specifically
women thought to be cured of breast cancer were likely
selected to receive MHT, and the women felt to harbor
residual tumors were not. Accordingly, the recurrence
rate in the women receiving MHT appeared to be reduced
compared with the placebo group.
To address the “wellness bias,” three RCTs compared
MHT to placebo in breast cancer survivors (63–66). Two
of
the
trials
[Hormonal
Replacement
After
Breast
Cancer–Is it Safe? (HABITS) and Stockholm] compared
estrogen with or without a progestogen and were con-
ducted in Stockholm. The trials differed with respect to the
progestogen used, primarily norethisterone in HABITS
Trial and medroxyprogesterone acetate in the Stockholm
Trial. The HABITS Trial with 898 women, reported an
increased hazard ratio (HR) for breast cancer recurrence of
2.2 (95% CI, 1.0 to 5.1) for those using MHT, whereas the
other, the Stockholm trial with 844 women, reported no
increased risk (HR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.35 to 1.9) (63–65).
Differences in the trials included continued use of ta-
moxifen and stage or histology or receptor status of the
preexisting breast cancer. Prior to completion of these
studies, the decision was made to combine the data,
resulting in an overall HR of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.03 to 3.10)
(64). The third trial evaluated tibolone, 2.5mg/day, and
also reported an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence
(HR = 1.40; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.70). The results might have
been influenced by the inclusion of women taking AIs in
the study, as tibolone can exert estrogenic effects (66).
These three trials, though not definitive, have led the
majority of guideline committees to consider MHT to be
contraindicated in breast cancer survivors (13, 66–68).
Other nonhormonal pharmacological treatments of
moderate to severe hot flashes that exhibit substantial
efficacy are available. RCTs demonstrate the efficacy of
the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (serotonin and
norepinephrine
reuptake
inhibitor
class
of
agents,
transdermal nitroglycerin (69), and of gabapentin and
pregabalin (Fig. 1) (36, 70–74). In general, these agents
result in an overall 70% to 80% reduction in hot flash
number and severity. However, on average, approxi-
mately 30% of the reduction is due to placebo effects
(Fig. 1) (75). From the patient’s point of view, overall
efficacy (including both drug and placebo effect) is the
most important factor with respect to reduction of hot
flash severity, sleep disruption, elevation in mood (76),
and improvement in quality of life. Substantial clinical
experience has been gained by the numerous trials of
Charles Loprinzi and colleagues (15, 71, 77) in breast
cancer survivors. The first recommendation from this
group is to try low-dose antidepressants in women with
moderate to severe hot flashes. Women taking tamoxifen
should avoid potent CYP2D6 inhibitors as these agents
reduce the levels of an active metabolite, endoxifene (73).
Higher CYP2D6 inhibitory potency is found with
paroxetine and fluoxetine (avoid), weak to moderate
with citalopram, and relatively low (better choice) with
venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, escitalopram, gabapentin,
and pregabalin (78–82).
Nighttime VMS may be associated with a greater risk
of minor depression, fatigue, and mood changes than
those occurring during the daytime (83). On this basis,
the first step in management is to ascertain whether the
symptoms occur predominantly at night as the pattern of
hot flash presentation can inform the specific therapy to
be chosen. For night time VMS or sleep disruption, a
single dose of gabapentin given 1 hour before sleep is
associated with a reduction in night time hot flashes and a
soporific effect on initiating sleep. The short half-life of
this agent yields fewer side effects upon awakening.
Clinical experience has shown that the gabapentin dose
must be individually determined and ranges from 100 mg
to 1200 mg given as a single dose 1 hour before bedtime.
A formal dose escalation protocol in each patient de-
termines the appropriate dose. For VMS occurring both
during the day and night, an additional morning dose of
gabapentin can be added.
For women with predominantly daytime hot flashes,
the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor class
of agents has been shown to be effective. In the United
States, only one agent, paroxetine salt 7.5 mg, is ap-
proved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
treatment of VMS, but others in this class are also ef-
fective (Fig. 1) and have been shown to be successful for
symptom relief in breast cancer survivors (15, 71, 73, 84).
Another agent, clonidine, is somewhat effective, and can
be a second line agent. Because of side effects with oral
preparations, the long-acting transdermal therapy system
preparation of clonidine is preferable, with titration of
dose depending on symptom relief and effect on blood
pressure. With each of these approaches, approximately
half of these women experience at least a 50% decrease in
hot flash score [see Table 2 from reference (77)].
In
patients
refractory
to
the
above
agents,
in-
tramuscular medroxyprogesterone acetate, 500 mg at 4- to
5-month intervals, has been suggested by the Mayo Clinic
group to be as effective as estrogen therapy (77). Because
this agent has been shown to be an effective therapy for
hormone dependent breast cancer (85–87), these in-
vestigators consider it safe for breast cancer survivors.
However, this conclusion is controversial because of

 concerns about the proliferative effects of a progestogen on
occult breast cancer cells. Until more safety data are avail-
able, this agent is generally not recommended. An important
side effect of medroxyprogesterone acetate is the weight gain
occurring from its glucocorticoid actions. Micronized pro-
gesterone 300 mg nightly also significantly decreases VMS
and improves sleep when compared with placebo (88).
Notably, observational studies in healthy postmenopausal
women have suggested a lesser effect of progesterone/
estrogen combinations on breast cancer risk compared
with synthetic progestogen/estrogen combinations (89–93),
but these findings have not been confirmed in RCTs, and no
data are available in women with breast cancer.
A key question is whether MHT might be prescribed to
breast cancer survivors refractory to the agents men-
tioned previously. A multidisciplinary conference (94)
recommended that MHT can be used in the lowest ef-
fective dose but only after obtaining full, written in-
formed consent from the patient with attention to all
potential risks and benefits (94). The Endocrine Society’s
2015 guidelines also allow for individual women to
accept a degree of risk that might otherwise be considered
to outweigh the benefits of MHT (13). The guideline
states, “A fully informed patient should be empowered to
make a decision that best balances individual QOL
benefits against potential health risks” (13).
Vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA)
This common condition is a consequence of estrogen
deficiency. Symptoms of VVA include vaginal dryness,
irritation, itching, infection, discomfort, and painful sex
(dyspareunia). Dyspareunia, in turn, leads to diminished

 sexual
desire,
arousal
difficulties,
and
relationship
problems. Up to 25% to 50% of postmenopausal
women, particularly those on AIs, have VVA; thus, many
women with breast cancer are profoundly affected by this
problem (25). Dyspareunia interferes with sexual in-
timacy and disrupts the quality of life and successful
partnerships in women with VVA. With the growing
awareness of quality-of-life issues in cancer survivors in
general, the issue of VVA has been increasingly empha-
sized as a major problem. VVA has been recently included
under the broader term genitourinary syndrome of
menopause, which also includes urinary symptoms (ur-
gency, dysuria, and recurrent urinary tract infections)
(31, 95).
For mild symptoms, regular use of vaginal moistur-
izers may be effective in combination with lubricants
proximate to intercourse. (Moisturizers are used con-
tinuously, but not at the time of intercourse, as they may
be irritating.) Differences between lubricants used acutely
prior to intercourse and vaginal moisturizers used
chronically to improve vaginal pH and moisture should
be emphasized to patients. There are many types of
moisturizers and lubricants available, including pre-
servative free if needed. For more severe symptoms, the
measures described previously are not sufficiently effec-
tive. A logical approach is to consider low-dose vaginal
estrogen therapy. However, high-sensitivity mass spec-
trometry assays have demonstrated that all vaginal es-
trogen preparations result in a minor degree of systemic
absorption but not exceeding normal postmenopausal
levels (96). Whether a very small increase in estradiol
exposure will stimulate quiescent, occult breast cancer
cells or contribute to the development of a breast cancer is
not known. Preclinical data have shown that long-term
estrogen deprivation can result in a state of estradiol
hypersensitivity, to both proliferation and apoptosis (97),
but it is not clear which effect would predominate.
Low-dose vaginal estrogen in women taking the an-
tiestrogens tamoxifen or raloxifene might be theoretically
safer than in women not receiving these agents because of
blockade of some possible effects of systemic estrogen
absorption (98). Three studies (observational and case
controlled) have examined the impact of vaginal estrogen
administration in breast cancer survivors, and the results
are reassuring, at least when vaginal estrogen is admin-
istered concurrently with tamoxifen (98–100). These
studies, however, do not provide robust evidence re-
garding the safety of vaginal estrogens in breast cancer
survivors taking AIs, the efficacy of which is due to
markedly suppressed estrogen levels (101). One obser-
vational study of breast cancer survivors using tamoxifen
or an AI, however, found no increased breast cancer
recurrence risk with low-dose vaginal estrogen (7.5 mg
vaginal ring or 10-mg tablet) during a 3.5-year mean
follow-up (98). In general, the use of low-dose vaginal
estrogen in breast cancer survivors has been discouraged,
particularly in those receiving AIs (13, 68). If recom-
mended following consultation with the attending on-
cologist, one should use the lowest effective dose of
vaginal estrogen as recommended by American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (102), American
Cancer Society/American Society of Clinical Oncology
(68), the Endocrine Society (13), and North American
Menopause Society (95).
The selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)
tamoxifen and raloxifene can exert mildly estrogenic
effects on vaginal tissue. In the Anastrozole, Tamoxifen,
Alone or in Combination Trial, 11.4% of women treated
with tamoxifen reported vaginal discharge compared
with 2.8% treated with an AI (103). In a chemo-
prevention trial comparing the effects of tamoxifen and
raloxifene, vaginal discharge was reported more com-
monly by women taking tamoxifen than raloxifene (104,
105). Ospemiphene, an oral SERM, has been approved in
Europe and North America for the treatment of dys-
pareunia secondary to VVA in healthy postmenopausal
women. Comprehensive studies of ospemiphene dem-
onstrated an improvement in vaginal maturation index
and relief of most VVA symptoms, as well as improve-
ment in measures of sexual wellbeing (106, 107). Safety
evaluation showed a negligible estrogen effect on the
uterus, and preclinical data suggested a predominantly
antiestrogen effect on breast cancer growth (106, 107).
Current FDA labeling in the United States recommends
against use of ospemiphene in women with a history of
breast cancer, until results from an adequately powered
RCT of its effect on the breast are available.
A recent FDA-approved (i.e., November 2016) ther-
apy for dyspareunia secondary to VVA is intravaginal
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). This therapy has not
yet been approved beyond the United States. Nightly
vaginal application of a 6.5-mg DHEA ovule has been
shown to significantly improve vaginal cell maturation
indices and the most bothersome symptoms of VVA. As
DHEA can be enzymatically converted into both estrogen
and
androgens
locally,
this
therapy
theoretically
provides a nonsystemic hormonal approach. Carefully
conducted studies with highly sensitive and specific mass
spectrometry assays suggest a slight but statistically
significant increase in plasma estradiol and testosterone
(108). Intravaginal DHEA has not been tested in breast
cancer survivors; thus, there is a warning about its use due
to lack of testing.
A small double-blind RCT of women without breast
cancer has shown that intravaginal testosterone may be
efficacious when compared with a placebo and vaginal

 estrogen in terms of subjective and objective VVA
measures (109). A preliminary noncontrolled trial sug-
gested that intravaginal testosterone may provide an
effective treatment option for women with breast cancer
taking an AI and experiencing symptoms of atrophic
vaginitis (110). Further data on safety and efficacy are
needed before this approach is recommended.
An additional approach to treatment of VVA includes
laser reduction of the vaginal mucosal lining using a
fractional CO2 laser (111). Although FDA approved for
use on soft tissues, the specific indication for laser
treatment of VVA is not included (112). The American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists currently
recommends against this procedure due to lack of safety
and efficacy data (112). Although results appear prom-
ising in a number of observational studies, including one
in women with breast cancer (113, 114), no RCTs have
compared this approach with sham treatment, and its
efficacy and safety therefore remain unclear (113).
Depressive symptoms and mood changes
The relationship between menopause, VMS, and de-
pressive symptoms and mood changes has been well
established (115). Major depression should be identified
and treated with specific pharmacologic agents and/or
cognitive behavioral therapy. Recent experimental data
support the concept that mild depressive symptoms and
fatigue may in part result from sleep disruption with
frequent awakening at night due to hot flashes (83, 116).
Further data are needed to confirm this conclusion in
women with breast cancer.
Cognition
Menopause appears to be associated with subtle
changes in cognitive function, notably, delayed verbal
memory (117). Sleep disruption may contribute, as sleep is
important for the encoding and consolidation of memory
(118). However, evidence that exogenous estrogen ther-
apy improves cognitive function within the first few years
after menopause is lacking except for those with early
surgical menopause (119, 120). Lower testosterone levels,
as seen with age, surgical menopause, or chemotherapy,
have been implicated in cognition (121). As breast cancer
survivors
experience
chemotherapy-induced
“chemo
brain” and sex-steroid deficiency related effects, further
understanding
and
possible
treatments of cognitive
problems remain key goals at the present time.
Osteopenia, osteoporosis, and fractures
Endocrine therapy for hormone dependent breast
cancer impedes either estrogen synthesis or its action.
Surgical oophorectomy or chemotherapy-induced ovar-
ian
insufficiency
in
premenopausal
women
reduce
estrogen levels and accelerate the rate of bone resorption,
as does tamoxifen in this population (11). On this
mechanistic basis, an increased rate of osteopenia or
osteoporosis and fracture has been reported (11). In
postmenopausal women with breast cancer, AIs have
become first-line therapy in preference to tamoxifen. The
substantial reduction of estradiol levels to subpicogram
concentrations (i.e., 0.05 to 0.6 pg/mL) (8, 10) markedly
contributes
to
bone
resorption.
Quantitative
data
demonstrate a rapid and substantial increase in markers
of bone resorption such as N-terminal telopeptide or C-
telopeptide and a subsequent reduction in bone density
with AIs (Fig. 2) (11, 122, 123). These effects are not
sufficiently counteracted by a reflex rise in bone forma-
tion, demonstrated by measurements of osteocalcin and
other markers. Accordingly, there is a net decrease in
bone density and an increase in fracture rate. As recent
data demonstrate the greater efficacy of 10 years vs 5
years of therapy with the AIs, this problem will become
increasingly severe in the future (124). Interestingly, ta-
moxifen acts as a weak estrogen on bone in post-
menopausal women and, as a SERM, increases bone
density. On this mechanistic basis, tamoxifen is associ-
ated with fewer fractures than use of AIs (11, 125, 126).
Minimal trauma fractures are common after a breast
cancer diagnosis, with nonpathological rib fracture the
most commonly reported fracture (30). In a 6-year
follow-up study of 1683 women after a diagnosis of
breast cancer, minimal trauma fracture was not associ-
ated with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, treatment with an
AI, or bilateral oophorectomy (30).
Several additional approaches have been developed to
prevent osteoporosis and fractures in AI treated patients or
in women after breast cancer with osteoporosis. Algo-
rithms to guide decisions whether to use pharmacologic
agents or life style changes havebeen developed (Fig.3) (11,
122). Prophylactic or treatment agents include oral and
parenteral bisphosphonates and denosumab (127). Both
are effective but associated with serious but uncommon
(rare) toxicity such as osteonecrosis of the jaw (estimated
by expert consensus to occur at rates of 1 in 10,000 and 1 in
100,000 person-years) and atypical femoral fractures
(estimated at 3.2 to 50 cases/100,000 person-years)
(127).
The
disproportionate
concern
about
these
toxicities by the public has led to a 50% reduction in
utilization by patients who are candidates for these agents.
Published reviews have recommended such agents in all
breast cancer survivors with osteoporosis and selective use
depending on other risk factors in those with osteopenia
(11, 122).The algorithm in Fig. 3 provides a roadmap for
selection of which patients to treat with pharmacologic
agents during therapy with tamoxifen, AI, or gonadotropin-
releasing hormone agonist. Effects of these agents beyond

 the bone may also be important in breast cancer survivors.
Recent studies have shown that intravenous zoledronic acid
and denosumab are associated with a decrease in breast
cancer recurrence in postmenopausal but not premenopausal
women (128). For zoledronic acid, this represented a 34%
relative risk reduction of disease recurrence and for deno-
sumab 19% (129, 130). Zoledronic acid also was associated
with a 19% relative risk of death (128, 129).
Cardiovascular disease
With aging, the incidence of coronary artery disease,
myocardial infarction, and acute coronary syndrome in-
crease, as does coronary plaque. Incomplete data address
the increased rate of cardiovascular disease in pre-
menopausal
women
aged
,45
years
undergoing
chemotherapy-induced premature menopause. Both che-
motherapy (anthracycline, trastuzumab, and AIs) and
radiation therapy (especially to the left breast and axilla)
can contribute to development of ischemic coronary heart
disease, valvular injury, pericardial injury, and cardio-
myopathy (131, 132). Statins are effective therapy in those
with increased cardiovascular risk factors and represent a
reasonable approach in breast cancer survivors (131).

healthy body weight, nutritious dietary pattern, regular
exercise, and aggressive treatment of traditional risk

 factors such as hypertension and glucose intolerance also
represent appropriate approaches (13, 33, 68).
Emerging Approaches for Unmet Needs in
Breast Cancer Survivors
SERMs
As VVA and the osteopenia/osteoporosis/fracture
complex are common in breast cancer survivors, an ap-
proach targeting both conditions would be useful. A major
goal of pharmaceutical development has been to create
SERMs with three separate actions: (1) prevention of
breast cancer, (2) decrease of bone resorption and pre-
vention of fractures, and (3) improvement in the symptoms
of VVA. Most SERMs increase VMS, but not enough to
cause discontinuation. Although tamoxifen and raloxifene
prevent breast cancer, these two agents have not been
shown to exert sufficient vaginal effects to treat VVA.
Ospemiphene objectively improves VVA by increasing
vaginal maturation indices and reducing the most both-
ersome symptoms (106, 107), and preclinical studies
suggest a neutral effect on breast. No clinical data yet exist
to demonstrate breast cancer prevention and reduction of
bone resorption. With respect to lasofoxifene (an un-
approved SERM), the Postmenopausal Evaluation and
Risk-Reduction With Lasofoxifene studies indicate pre-
vention of breast cancer and fractures, reduction of bone
resorption, and improvement of VVA, suggesting that this
agent shows promise for breast cancer survivors. As breast
cancer survivors experience a 0.5 to 1.0% rate of
contralateral breast cancer per year, an agent blocking
growth of these lesions when too small to be detected
clinically would be useful (133). Of note, VTE rates were
higher with lasofoxifene than other SERMs, but this agent
also significantly reduced both stroke and MI (134).
Lasofoxifene will be starting phase 2 trials for treatment of
locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer.
Tissue-Selective Estrogen
Complex Therapy
The concept of combining a SERM with an estrogen to
create a tissue-selective estrogen complex (TSEC) has
been studied intensively in the past decade, and one
TSEC, pairing 0.45 mg oral conjugated equine estrogen
with 20 mg bazedoxifene, has been approved in the
United States and Canada and by the European Union
(135–142). In a series of studies (141, 142), this com-
bination improves hot flashes, reduces bone resorption,
and exerts no stimulatory effects on the uterus, though
highly effective for VMS and VVA (143). In 2-year
clinical trials, the effect on breast tenderness and breast
density was the same as placebo (144, 145) with no in-
crease in breast cancer cases, but further testing is needed.
Preclinical studies demonstrate that this TSEC blocks the
growth of three separate breast tumor models (MCF-7
xenografts, N-nitrosomethylurea-induced tumors, and
estrogen induced ACI tumors in rats) (146–148). Con-
firmation of breast antitumor effects in women would
support the use of this TSEC in breast cancer survivors.

 Miscellaneous agents
Recent data suggest that the kisspeptin, neurokinin B,
and dynorphin neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the
hypothalamus—particularly, neurokinin B—mediate hot
flashes (149). On this basis, two randomized controlled
trials have evaluated the effects of oral neurokinin B
receptor antagonists on hot flashes (76, 150, 151). Both
agents (MLE 4901 and fezolinetant) reduced hot flash
frequency and severity by 40% to 50% over placebo in
postmenopausal women, with negligible side effects (150,
151). As these inhibitors act on specific hot-flash-
mediating pathways, they show promise as effective,
nonhormonal agents to treat hot flashes. The pregnancy-
associated natural estrogen, estetrol, is undergoing clin-
ical trials in postmenopausal women as a candidate for
hormone therapy. A rationale for use of this agent is that
estetrol did not stimulate the hormone dependent 7,12-
dimethylbenz[a]anthracene tumors in rats and could
potentially be safe for use in breast cancer survivors
(152–158).
Conclusions
Lifestyle optimization may improve estrogen-deficiency
symptoms, improve quality of life, and possibly improve
prognosis. Smoking cessation, losing weight (if in-
dicated), limiting or avoiding alcohol, maintaining ade-
quate levels of vitamin D and calcium, eating a healthy
diet, and participating in regular physical activity are
suggested for all women with prior breast cancer.
Nonpharmacologic therapies for VMS such as cognitive
behavioral therapy, hypnosis, and acupuncture may be
helpful as may vaginal lubricants and moisturizers. For
women with more severe symptoms or signs of estrogen
deficiency, pharmacologic agents are available to relieve
VMS and VVA and to prevent and treat fractures.
Therapy must be individualized based on each woman’s
needs and goals for therapy. Several emerging approaches
such as SERMs, TSECs, estetrol, and neurokinin B in-
hibitors show promise as useful agents to expand options
for symptom relief with less breast cancer risk but have
not yet been tested in women with prior breast cancer.
