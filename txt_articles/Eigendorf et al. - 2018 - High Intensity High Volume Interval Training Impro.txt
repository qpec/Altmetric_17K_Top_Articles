We present here a longitudinal study determining the effects of two 3 week-periods of
high intensity high volume interval training (HIHVT) (90 intervals of 6 s cycling at 250%
maximum power, Pmax/24 s) on a cycle ergometer. HIHVT was evaluated by comparing
performance tests before and after the entire training (baseline, BSL, and endpoint,
END) and between the two training sets (intermediate, INT). The mRNA expression
levels of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms and markers of energy metabolism were
analyzed in M. vastus lateralis biopsies by quantitative real-time PCR. In incremental
tests peak power (Ppeak) was increased, whereas ˙
VO2peak was unaltered. Prolonged
time-to-exhaustion was found in endurance tests with 65 and 80% Pmax at INT and
END. No changes in blood levels of lipid metabolites were detected. Training-induced
decreases of hematocrit indicate hypervolemia. A shift from slow MHCI/β to fast MHCIIa
mRNA expression occurred after the first and second training set. The mRNA expression
of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), a master
regulator of oxidative energy metabolism, decreased after the second training set. In
agreement, a significant decrease was also found for citrate synthase mRNA after the
second training set, indicating reduced oxidative capacity. However, mRNA expression
levels of glycolytic marker enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase did
not change after the first and second training set. HIHVT induced a nearly complete
slow-to-fast fiber type transformation on the mRNA level, which, however, cannot
account for the improvements of performance parameters. The latter might be explained
by the well-known effects of hypervolemia on exercise performance.

High Intensity High Volume Training
INTRODUCTION
Sprint interval training has been predicted to be a potent
and time-efficient means of improving endurance exercise
performance (Coyle, 2005). This was based on a study
demonstrating
that
sprint
interval
training
can
improve
cycle endurance time significantly (Burgomaster et al., 2005).
Extending this study, Gibala et al. (2006) could demonstrate
that a low volume sprint interval training can elicit increases in
exercise capacity, markers of oxidative capacity, resting muscle
glycogen content, and buffering capacity, all of these changes
being comparable to those induced by a high volume endurance
training. Furthermore, in a subsequent study using a similar
low volume high intensity interval sprint training, exercise
capacity (maximal oxygen consumption, ˙
VO2peak), and markers
of oxidative capacity have been shown to increase along with
other metabolic adaptations as seen after endurance training
(Burgomaster et al., 2008). Notably, in the latter two studies
the similar effects of sprint interval and endurance training on
endurance performance were achieved despite large differences
in training volume and time commitment. However, data about
fiber type proportions or myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform
expression have not been presented in these studies.
In contrast, the effect of endurance training on muscle fiber
type and MHC expression has been investigated in numerous
studies. In a large number of studies, MHCIId/x has been shown
to be down-regulated following increased physical activity,
with MHCIIa being upregulated. The majority of experiments
failed to demonstrate the full MHC shift of a fast-to-slow
transformation (Mercier et al., 1999; Harridge, 2007). These
findings led to the hypothesis that, at least in humans, fast-
to-slow transformations require a significant challenge to the
muscle (Harridge, 2007). In contrast, in animal models fast-to-
slow transformations can be easily achieved, for example by low
frequency electrostimulation (Pette and Vrbova, 1992). However,
some examples of exercise-induced fast-to-slow transformations
in humans do exist, and, interestingly, training regimen using
endurance and high intensity interval training (HIT) were among
them (Howald et al., 1985; Simoneau et al., 1985; Linossier
et al., 1993; Russell et al., 2003a,b). Sprint training in general is
associated with a decreased proportion of slow and an increased
proportion of fast fibers (Abernethy et al., 1990). For example,
a running sprint HIT led to a decrease in slow type I and an
increase in fast type II fiber area (Dawson et al., 1998). In the
wake of a high intensity cycle sprint training (Jansson et al., 1990),
the proportion of type I fibers decreased while the proportion
of type IIA increased and that of type IID remained unchanged,
demonstrating again that high intensity sprint training can lead
to a slow-to-fast transformation. In contrast, a 5-s sprint cycle
training as presented by Linossier et al. (1993) induced a fast-
to-slow fiber type shift with an increase in the number of type
I and a decrease in type IID fibers, while the number of type
IIA fibers remained unaltered. Strikingly, activities of two marker
enzymes of oxidative energy metabolism did not change in this
5-s sprint training, while the activities of two glycolytic marker
enzymes showed an increase. The metabolic changes seen in this
study do not appear to be consistent with the effects on MHC
isoform expression, and therefore all changes together did not
constitute a classical fast-to-slow transformation. Nevertheless,
the study provides an interesting training design that might be
used to induce increases in MHCI/β gene expression. The study
also seems to indicate that the elements of exercise-induced
fiber transformations are not inevitably all consistent with either
“slow-to-fast” or “fast-to-slow,” nor must a transformation be
complete. Indeed, a metabolic transformation is often achieved
more easily and can occur without changes in MHC expression.
This is compatible with the finding that fast fibers show a high
degree of adaptability of their oxidative capacity in response to
endurance training (Abernethy et al., 1990).
The effects of endurance exercise on oxidative capacity
are thought to be mediated by the transcriptional coactivator
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)
coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) (Qaisar et al., 2016). PGC-1α is crucial
regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative energy
metabolism (Puigserver and Spiegelman, 2003; Arany, 2008) and
has been reported to be activated in response to endurance
exercise (Qaisar et al., 2016). Furthermore, several studies have
demonstrated that HIT also induces an up-regulation of PGC-1α
(Psilander et al., 2010; Little et al., 2011; Cochran et al., 2014).
Nevertheless, based on studies in PGC-1α knockout mice, it has
been questioned whether PGC-1α is necessary for the majority of
adaptive responses to exercise (Egan and Zierath, 2013).
Motivated by the finding of a HIT-induced shift from fast
to slow fibers by Linossier et al. (1993), we developed for
this study a 6-s sprint high intensity high volume interval
training study (HIHVT; modification of the protocol of Schrader
et al., 2016) designed to answer the following questions.
First: Will the 6-s sprint HIHVT induce an increase in
the expression of slow MHCI/β associated with decreased
expression of fast MHC isoforms? Second: Is the possible shift
toward MHCI/β expression accompanied by increases in the
expression of markers of oxidative energy metabolism? Third: Do
muscular adaptations encompass decreases in glycolytic marker
expression, thus constituting a complete HIHVT-induced fast-
to-slow fiber type transformation?
Contrary to the results of Linossier et al. (1993), the present 6-
s sprint HIHVT led to a slow-to-fast shift in MHC expression that
was accompanied by a decrease in PGC-1α and citrate synthase
(CS) mRNA and a trend toward a decreased mRNA expression
of another marker of oxidative energy metabolism, hydroxyacyl-
CoA-dehydrogenase (HADH), but no change in glycolytic
marker glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH).
The data therefore indicate a nearly complete HIHVT-induced
slow-to-fast fiber type transformation on the mRNA level, with
the exception of the marker of glycolytic energy metabolism. The
observed changes in fiber type characteristics cannot explain the
observed improvements in endurance performance. Thus, other
factors seem to be responsible for these effects of HIHVT.
METHODS
Subjects
Eight healthy, male subjects (Table 1) were recruited for the study
after their written informed consent had been given and their

coagulation status had been tested. Normal coagulation status
was an inclusion criterion. One subject could not complete the
second training session, leaving n = 7 for the last investigated
time point of the session. The training status of the subjects
was heterogeneous, one was untrained and several others were
recreational athletes. All of them had bicycling experience, three
subjects were extensive cyclists. Subjects were asked to refrain
from any specific diet during the study and keep their standard
nutritional habits, with the exception that all of them were
requested to observe a carbohydrate-rich diet on the 2 days
before a test. Also, they were asked to refrain from sporting
activities for 48 h before each test. All tests were performed on
the same time of the day. The study procedures recorded in the
study protocol were approved by the local ethics committee of
Hannover Medical School.
Training and Testing Sessions
All training sessions started with 5 min at rest on the cycle
ergometer, followed by a running-in for 2 min at 10 Watt (W),
a 10 min warm-up at 50% maximum power (Pmax), a 45 min
interval phase with 90 intervals of 6 s at 250% Pmax, each followed
by a 24 s pause at 10 W, and a cool-down of 5 min at 50%
Pmax. Subjects were asked to keep cadence at 70-90 min−1.
Subjects performed three training sessions per week, resulting
in 18 training sessions in 6 weeks. The training was interrupted
after 3 weeks (first phase with a set of 9 training sessions) for 1
week for the intermediate (INT) testing procedures (Figure 1).
Afterwards, training was resumed for another 3 weeks (second
phase with a set of 9 training sessions). Additional testing sessions
were scheduled before the first training session (baseline, BSL)
and after the last (eighteenth) training session (endpoint, END)
(see Figure 1 for set-up of testing sessions). In addition, during
the second, eighth, and seventeenth training session several
parameters were monitored (see below).

Exercise Performance Tests
All tests and training sessions were performed on a Lode
Excalibur cycle ergometer (Groningen, The Netherlands).
Testing procedures included an incremental test (IT), two
endurance tests (ET) and a doubled Wingate-Test (WT). The
IT was used for assessing ˙
VO2peak and peak power (Ppeak).
Subjects completed two ETs to exhaustion, one with 65% Pmax
(ET65) and another with 80% Pmax (ET80). To test for sprint and
regeneration capability subjects performed a doubled WT, i.e.,
two 30 s all-out sprints with 1 min pause in between (Figure 2).

Blood Parameters and Metabolites
During
WT,
ET65,
ET80,
and
selected
(second,
eighth,
seventeenth) training sessions venous blood samples from an
antecubital vein were drawn. EDTA or sodium-heparin was used
for anticoagulation. Blood samples were immediately centrifuged
at 4◦C, plasma was aliquoted and deep frozen at −80◦C for later
analysis.
Glycerol (Gly) concentration [Gly] was determined using
a
UV-method
(R-Biopharm
AG,
Darmstadt,
Germany).
Triglyceride concentration [Tri] was calculated from the
difference of the concentrations of free Gly [fGly] and total Gly
[tGly]. For determination of [tGly], probes underwent alkaline
hydrolysis to release esterified Gly.
FFA were analyzed using the NEFA-HR(2) enzymatic color
Test and standards (Wako Chemicals GmbH, Neuss).
Venous blood samples for hematocrit measurements were
drawn into heparinized micro hematocrit tubes (Brand GmbH
& Co KG, Wertheim, Germany), immediately centrifuged and
evaluated.
Capillary blood samples were drawn from an earlobe during
all testing sessions. Earlobes were hyperaemised at least for
3 min before the first sample was drawn. Capillary blood drawn
into 20 µl end-to-end capillaries was used to analyze glucose
and lactate concentrations within the next 2 h. Analyses were
performed with the Biosen S line analyzer (EKF Diagnostics,
Barleben, Germany) including the glucose/lactate test set-up
with hemolyzing, Glucose/Lactate system, multi standard and
ReadyCon test solutions (EKF Diagnostics).

Muscle Biopsies
All muscle biopsies were taken from the left vastus lateralis
muscle. After skin disinfection using iodine-containing solutions,
the lower third of the muscle was covered with a sterile surgical
sheet. Skin and muscle fascia were anesthetized with 2% lidocaine
plus epinephrine to reduce bleeding (Xylocitin R
�, 2 ml containing
32.46 mg lidocaine and 0.02 mg epinephrine). A spring biopsy
needle (Biopsy Handy 14G, Somatex, Teltow, Germany) was
inserted through a small skin incision and moved forward
through the fascia into the muscle to obtain muscle tissue pieces
of 5–8 mm in length (∼10 mg wet weight). The typical depth
of sampling was 1.5–2 cm below the muscle fascia with little
variation because the fascia serves as an important landmark
during the procedure and the needle construction allows a
standardized and controlled insertion including marks on the
outside. The sampling was performed through the same fascia
puncture in the lower third of the M. vastus lateralis, and
the orientation of the needle was strictly pointed to the knee.
Thus, repeated tissue samples were taken within close proximity.
Each biopsied tissue piece was immediately snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen and kept at −80◦C until analysis. The wound
was afterwards covered with adhesive bandage and a pressure
bandage was applied for 60 min. The first biopsy was taken under
resting condition in supine position at least 2–3 days before
the first pretest. The other three biopsies were taken in sitting
position (on the ergometer) immediately after the last training
bout of the first, ninth, and eighteenth training session (the latter
at the end of the first and of the second set of training sessions,
respectively) (see Figure 1). For this purpose, all steps described
above to prepare the subjects for biopsy taking were performed
within the breaks during the last 15–20 cycles so that the biopsy
needle could be inserted into the muscle immediately after the
last sprint. Except for mild to moderate muscle pain on the
following 2–3 days after the biopsy, volunteers experienced no
adverse effects.
Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qPCR)
Total RNA was isolated from muscle biopsies using the
RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany;
including Dnase I treatment) and subsequently the RNeasy
MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. A Micro-Dismembrator (B. Braun Melsungen AG,
Melsungen, Germany) was used for tissue disruption and
homogenization. A cDNA synthesis with integrated removal
of genomic DNA contamination was performed with the
QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen).
Analysis by qPCR was performed on a Rotor-Gene 2000 real-
time PCR thermocycler (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany; program:
40 cycles of 95◦C for 10 s followed by 60◦C for 45 s) using
Power SYBR Green Supermix (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Data
were quantified using Rotor-Gene Q Series Software 1.7 (Qiagen).
Efficiencies were calculated from the slope of template dilution
curves with primers for genes of interest (MHC isoforms or genes
of energy metabolism) and the reference gene (BSM or RPS12,
respectively), and used for quantification of changes of transcript
levels by the ��Ct-method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). The
efficiency of all primer sets was between 95 and 105%.

Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaPlot 11.0 (Systat
Software Inc.) and GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software,
Inc.). Figures and tables show mean values (MV) with standard
error (SE). Statistical significance was set to p < 0.05. For
statistical analyses of data obtained during the time course
of BSL, INT and END testing, respectively, two way repeated
measurement ANOVA was used. To correct for multiple
comparisons Holm–Sidak post-hoc tests were applied after all
ANOVA tests when significant interactions of two factors were
detected. Additionally, one-way repeated measures parametric or
non-parametric ANOVA was used. Homogeneous distribution of
variances was tested for by the Levene Median test.
RESULTS
Training
Eight subjects (Table 1) performed a high intensity high volume
interval training (HIHVT) consisting of two sets of 9 training
sessions (90 intervals of 6 s cycling at 250% maximum power,
Pmax/24 s, per session). Each set was completed within 3 weeks,
and 1 week was interposed between the two sessions. HIHVT
was performed on a cycle ergometer (Figure 1). In the course
of the HIT sessions, several parameters as described below were
closely monitored. During the second, eighth, and seventeenth
training session, ventilation ( ˙
VE) was significantly increased
compared to rest (min 18–62 and 0–5, respectively, Figure 3A).
During the eighth and seventeenth compared to the second
training session, ˙
VE was significantly lower at indicated time
points (min 18–62). Respiratory parameters mean carbon dioxide
release ( ˙
VCO2mean) and mean oxygen consumption ( ˙
VO2mean)
did not show significant differences between the second, eighth,
and seventeenth training session (Table 2), the latter indicating
no changes in systemic aerobic capacity. Similarly, the mean
respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was not significantly different
between the second, eighth, and seventeenth training session
(Table 2, Figure 3B).
Blood
lactate
concentration
([Lac])
was
significantly
decreased at the indicated time points during the eighth and
seventeenth compared to the second training session (Figure 4,
Table 2). The highest [Lac], 6.5 mmol∗l−1, was measured during
the second training session. These data indicate improvements
in energy metabolism elicited during the HIHVT exercise tests.

To analyze possible effects of HIHVT on lipid metabolism,
concentrations of plasma free fatty acids [FFA], glycerol [Gly],
and triglyceride [Tri] as parameters of lipid metabolism were
determined. [FFA] (Figure 5A) and [Gly] (Figure 5B) did neither
change significantly between rest and indicated time points of
the second, eighth, and seventeenth interval training session nor
between the second, eighth, and seventeenth interval training
sessions. Moreover, no significant changes in [Tri] were found at
the end of the second, eighth, and seventeenth interval training

Testing Sessions
Exercise Testing
To analyze the effect of HIHVT on endurance capacity, time-to-
exhaustion was evaluated in two endurance tests (ET), one with
65% maximum power (Pmax) (ET65) and the other one with 80%
Pmax (ET80). The eight subjects improved time-to-exhaustion by
64% in the ET65 and by 86% in the ET80 at END compared with
BSL testing (Figure 6A, Table 3). The degree of improvement did
not differ significantly between ET65 and ET80. These significant
improvements in both ETs show that HIHVT led to increases in
endurance capacity. During ET65 and ET80, ˙
VO2peak, ˙
VCO2peak
(Table 3) and RER (Figure 6B, ET80 data not shown) did not
show significant differences.
In incremental tests (ITs), subjects reached a Ppeak of 308
± 24 W at BSL testing, 320 ± 23 W at INT testing and 327 ±
22 W at END testing (Table 3). With 4.4% increase at INT testing

and 6.9% increase at END testing both values are significantly
higher than baseline results. The significant improvements in ITs
indicate that the HIHVT led to increases in exercise performance.
In ITs, ˙
VO2peak increased slightly but not significantly at INT
and at END testing compared to BSL (Table 3), indicating that
HIHVT did not markedly improve systemic aerobic capacity. In
addition, ˙
VCO2peak did not change significantly between testing
sessions.
To test for sprint and repeated sprint capability subjects
performed a doubled Wingate Test (WT) meaning two 30 s
all-out sprints (WT1 and WT2, respectively) with 1 min pause
in between. Pmax tended to be increased in WT2 at INT and
END testing, but neither in WT1 and WT2 were significant
changes due to the exercise program seen in Pmax in (Table 3).
Mean power (Pmean) in WT1 also tended to be higher at
INT and END testing compared to BSL testing but changes
were not significant (Table 3). In WT2 Pmean was significantly
increased at INT and at END compared to BSL testing (Table 3).
The increase in Pmean from INT to END testing, however,
was not significant. Results from the doubled WT indicate
that the HIHVT led to enhanced sprint capability at least in
WT2, which indicates an improved recovery between sprint
tests.
No significant differences of ˙
VO2peak and ˙
VO2mean between
testing sessions were detected in WT1 and 2 (Table 3), indicating
no changes in whole body aerobic energy contribution. The same
holds for ˙
VCO2peak and ˙
VCO2mean.
Metabolic Parameters
In ET65 and ET80 no significant changes in [Lac] were found
between the testing sessions at the end of the tests (Table 3),
indicating identical degrees of exertion.
Furthermore, no significant changes in [Glu] between the
testing sessions were found at ET65 and ET80 at the end of the
tests (Table 3), indicating no lasting HIHVT-induced changes in
glucose handling.
In addition, in ET65 and ET80 as well as in WT no significant
differences in [FFA] (Figures 7A,B; data not shown for WT),
[Gly] (Figures 7C,D; data not shown for WT) and [Tri] (Table 3)
were found between BSL, INT and END testing. Taken together,
the data indicate no changes in lipid metabolism as a consequence
of the training.
Hematocrit
Hematocrit was significantly decreased by 2.8% at INT compared
to BSL testing and decreased by a further 2.2% at END compared
to INT testing (Figure 8). The significantly lowered hematocrit
(by 5% at END compared to BSL testing) indicates a significant
expansion in plasma volume that may explain at least in part the
reported improvements of endurance parameters.
Fiber Type-Specific Gene Expression
To investigate possible effects of the HIHVT on fiber type-
specific gene expression, we performed quantitative real-time
PCR. We determined the mRNA expression levels of MHC
isoforms I/β, IIa, and IId/x. The MHC isoforms are the hallmark
of muscle fiber type. We also determined mRNA expression
levels of PGC-1α and of PGC-1α-dependent citrate synthase
(CS) and hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HADH) as markers
of oxidative energy metabolism. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as a marker of glycolytic
energy metabolism. We also investigated possible changes in the
expression of the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2),
a marker of antioxidant metabolism.
The percentage of transcript expression of MHCI/β, IIa and
IId/x did not change after the first training session compared
to the BSL mRNA percentage (Figure 9A). In contrast, the
percentage of MHCI/β mRNA decreased after the ninth and
eighteenth training session (Figures 1, 9A), while the percentage
of MHCIIa mRNA increased. The percentage of MHCIId/x
mRNA remained unchanged. Therefore, the HIHVT induced a
MHC isoform shift from slow to fast on the level of mRNA
expression.
The level of PGC-1α mRNA expression did not change after
the first and after the ninth training session, but decreased after
the eighteenth training session, when compared to BSL mRNA
level (Figure 9B). Furthermore, the mRNA expression levels of

CS were significantly lower at the end of the eighteenth compared
to the end of the first training session (Figure 9B). Moreover,
we found an excellent overall correlation between the values
of PGC1α and CS (p < 0.001; not shown). The two changes,
together with the decrease of MHCI/β mRNA expression after
the ninth and eighteenth training session, support the idea of
a HIHVT-induced slow-to-fast fiber type transformation on the
mRNA level, which includes MHC as well as metabolic changes.
However, mRNA expression levels of HADH did not change
significantly after the first or after the ninth and eighteenth
training session (Figure 9B). Unchanged mRNA levels of this
latter marker of oxidative energy metabolism are at variance with
the decrease of PGC-1α and CS mRNA expression observed after
the eighteenth training session and would not be in agreement
with a classical slow-to-fast fiber type transformation. The same
holds true for the unchanged transcript expression of GAPDH
and SOD2 seen after the first, ninth and eighteenth training
session (Figures 9C,D). Taken together, the lack of effects of
HIHVT on mRNA expression of HADH, GAPDH and SOD2
appear inconsistent with the effects on MHC isoform, CS and
PGC-1α mRNA expression.
Nevertheless, our results can be put into a different perspective
when parameter levels in single training subjects are considered.
Seven of eight subjects showed a decrease of PGC-1α mRNA
expression after the ninth training session as compared to the
BSL mRNA level, while no significant change was found for
the whole cohort (Table 4, Figure 9B). After the eighteenth
training session, all eight subjects showed a decrease in PGC-
1α mRNA expression, thus for the whole group a significant
change compared to the BSL testing level was obtained. The
difference between the ninth and eighteenth training session
may be due to the fact that the number of training subjects
was fairly low and the training history was different among the
subjects at the start of the study. Similarly, with regard to CS
and HADH, at least 75% of all subjects showed a decrease of
mRNA expression levels after the ninth and eighteenth training

session, while the whole cohort showed a significant change
compared to the BSL mRNA level only in the case of CS after
the eighteenth training session (Table 4, Figure 9B). Therefore,
considering single subject data, the changes of mRNA expression
of all markers of oxidative energy metabolism employed show the
tendency to be compatible with the changes in MHC isoform
mRNA expression. Taken together, expression data of markers
of energy metabolism and MHC isoforms indicate a nearly
complete HIHVT-induced slow-to-fast fiber type transformation
on the mRNA level, with the exception of the marker of glycolytic
energy metabolism. Nonetheless, the demonstrated effects of
HIHVT on parameters of exercise performance, especially
endurance capacity, clearly cannot be explained by the presented
mRNA level measurements of markers of energy metabolism or
of SOD2.
DISCUSSION
Changes in Muscular Parameters
In the present paper the effects of a 6-s sprint HIHVT consisting
of two sets of sessions of very short high intensity cycle ergometer
sprints on parameters of skeletal muscle fiber type, exercise
parameters, and metabolites were demonstrated. A slow-to-fast
shift in MHC expression as demonstrated by an increase in
MHCIIa, and a decrease in MHCI/β mRNA expression was
induced by the HIHVT already after the first set of training
sessions. The shift in MHC expression was accompanied by a
decreased expression—or a trend toward decreased expression—
of markers of oxidative energy metabolism, while plasma levels of
lipid metabolites remained unchanged. Performance parameters
like time-to-exhaustion in ET65% and ET80% as well as Ppeak
in IT and Pmean and Pmax in WT2 were all improved by the
present HIHVT, indicating improvements in repeated sprint
ability and endurance performance. Moreover, [Lac] decreased
significantly in ET65, and in ET80 there is a tendency to lower
[Lac]. However, ˙
VO2peak was not significantly altered during ITs.
Sprint interval trainings as presented here are expected to be a
potent and time-efficient means to improve endurance exercise
performance (Coyle, 2005). Indeed, the data of the present study
provide another example for the potency and efficiency of intense
interval training in terms of endurance exercise parameters.
It produces training effects comparable to those induced by
endurance training. The heterogeneous training history of the
group of subjects becomes apparent in the good correlation we
find between the exercise-induced changes in ET80% (�ET80%)
and the initial ET80%, where �ET80% decreases with increasing
initial ET80% (r = 0.69; P < 0.05). The relation was similar
for ET60%, although not significant. Similarly, �Ppeak decreased
significantly with increasing initial Ppeak value (r = 0.76; P
< 0.05). This indicates an influence of training status on the
size of the training effects. Nevertheless, in spite of the rather
small sample size and the heterogeneity of the samples, many
parameters changed statistically significantly for the whole cohort
by the HIHVT protocol.
An outcome very similar to the present one has been
demonstrated earlier after a running sprint HIT by Dawson
et al. (1998), who reported a nearly complete slow-to-fast
transformation that is reflected in an increase in the proportion
of type II fibers, a decrease in citrate synthase activity but no
change in the glycolytic marker phosphofructokinase. This was
accompanied by improved sprint and endurance performance
parameters. This study, like ours, suggests that HIT can induce
an almost complete slow-to-fast fiber transformation. Several
other related studies reported deviating results: (1) Jansson et al.
(1990) in a high intensity sprint training study also showed
decreases in type I and increases in type IIA MHC, but did not
find changes in performance parameters as assessed by WTs. (2)
Sprint training of an especially high intensity has interestingly
been demonstrated to lead to an additional conversion of type
IID to type IIA fibers (Esbjörnsson et al., 1993), which would
indicate that the outcome of high intensity sprint training may
be related to the total training volume. (3) In line with this latter
paper, another highly intense strength and interval training has
also demonstrated a shift toward an increased fraction of type IIA
and decreases in the number of type I and IID fibers (Andersen
et al., 1994). The two last-mentioned studies did not present
metabolic data. We conclude that with regard to changes in fiber
type and/or MHC pattern, the present results are partly similar to
those of some previous investigations.
This is not the case with regard to the study of Linossier et al.
(1993). The sprint training used by Linossier et al. (1993) and the
present 6-s sprint HIHVT have a similar design. However, the
total work performed during the sessions in our investigation is
about twice as high as that used in the study of Linossier et al.
(1993). This is mainly due to the larger number of intervals (90 vs.
16 to 30) and shorter breaks between exercise bouts (24 vs. 55 s).
Linossier et al. (1993) found an increase in the number of type
I and a decrease in type IID fibers, while the number of type IIA
fibers remained unaltered. Therefore, the effects on fiber type and
MHC expression, respectively, are contradictory between the two
studies with regard to the direction of the shift. The impact on the
oxidative energy metabolism is also different, with reduction or

a trend toward reduction of the expression of oxidative markers
CS and HADH in our study, vs. no change in enzymatic activities
of the same markers in the study of Linossier et al. (1993). The
effects on markers of glycolytic energy metabolism were also
different, with an increase of phosphofructokinase and lactate
dehydrogenase activities (and no change of hexokinase activity)
seen by Linossier et al. (1993), but no change of GAPDH seen in
our study. It is not clear whether differences in the study design
and/or in the determination of muscle fiber type parameters can
be the underlying reason for the different outcomes of the two
studies.
The oxidative capacity of type IIA fibers is known to be lower
than that of type I fibers (Saltin et al., 1977). Decreases in PGC-
1α-dependent markers of oxidative energy metabolism have been
observed here in a majority of individual training subjects after
the first and second set of training sessions. This indicates a trend
toward a reduction of muscular oxidative capacity induced by the
present training protocol albeit not all parameters reach statistical
significance in the whole cohort. This interpretation of our data
is strongly supported by the decreased PGC-1α mRNA levels
observed after the second set of training sessions and suggests
Frontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org

High Intensity High Volume Training
a trend toward a nearly complete slow-to-fast-transformation
on the mRNA level, with the exception of glycolytic energy
metabolism. Decreased muscular oxidative capacity and the lack
of changes in plasma lipid metabolite levels suggest that observed
improvements in endurance performance parameters are likely
to be caused by other factors. Unchanged lipid metabolism
is also reflected by the lack of significant differences in RER
during ET65 and ET80. The effects of HIHVT are also not
explainable by changes in SOD2 transcription. Reported effects
of N-acetylcysteine infusion prior to or during exercise have led
to the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species (ROS) might play a
role in exercise performance (McKenna et al., 2006). The present
study shows no up-regulation of SOD2, and thus a possible
role of ROS in mediating the effects of HIHVT is not apparent
from the data presented. Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that
the expression of other enzymes involved in ROS detoxification
might be changed during the HIHVT.
Changes in Metabolite and Blood
Parameters
Fiber type alone is not the only determinant of athletic
performance (Zierath and Hawley, 2004). At least in athletes,
distance running performance is most strongly related to
˙
VO2max, but only modestly to fiber composition (Foster
et al., 1978). Furthermore, this latter study showed that
there is only a weak relationship between oxidative marker
succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity and either performance
or ˙
VO2max. Indeed, other studies demonstrated performance
improvements in response to HIT without a change in CS enzyme
activity (Weston et al., 1997; Cochran et al., 2014). We now could
demonstrate improvements in endurance exercise parameters
despite a partly significant tendency toward a decrease in
muscular oxidative capacity in HIHVT. In contrast to this,
some high intensity sprint interval training studies have even
demonstrated increases in CS activity (Burgomaster et al., 2006,
2008; Larsen et al., 2015).
At first glance, decreased [Lac] during training seems to be
at odds with the finding of a decrease in muscular oxidative
together with unaltered glycolytic capacity. While changes seen
in the biopsy sample are likely not representative for the
entire working musculature, it is in addition well-known that
alterations of whole body metabolism and muscular oxidative
capacity are not necessarily linked. This has been demonstrated
in an endurance exercise study (Green et al., 1992), which showed
that training resulted in pronounced reductions in glycogen
utilization that were accompanied by reductions in muscle lactate
concentrations. At the same time, the activities of two enzymes of
muscular oxidative energy metabolism (CS and SDH) remained
unaffected. In line with this finding, a close relationship between
blood lactate and glycogen utilization has been demonstrated
in a high intensity cycle ergometry study (Coyle et al., 1988).
Interestingly, both factors varied in this study by up to a
factor of two among cyclists with similar ˙
VO2max, pointing
to significant differences in individual metabolic responses to
the same training regime. Improved clearance of lactate by
the liver, increased lactate utilization by the heart and slow
muscle fibers and perhaps a larger distribution volume for
lactate might explain the reduction of [Lac]. Indeed, [Lac] has
been shown to negatively correlate with endurance performance
during submaximal exercise (Coyle et al., 1988). It has also
been shown that skeletal muscle buffering capacity is affected
by high-intensity, submaximal interval training, which indicates
another potentially important factor determining endurance
performance (Weston et al., 1997).
The observed reduction of hematocrit in the present
study indicates an increase in blood volume. Hypervolemia
accompanied by a reduction of blood viscosity is a well-
documented effect of endurance exercise training (Schmidt
et al., 1988; Convertino, 1991; Fellmann, 1992). Interestingly,
the effects of exercise on blood volume and viscosity may
differ depending on the type and intensity of exercise (Neuhaus
and Gaehtgens, 1994; El-Sayed et al., 2005). Several factors are
thought to contribute to the effects of hypervolemia and reduced
blood viscosity on exercise performance. Hypervolemia may
be advantageous for thermoregulation by providing more fluid
to increase skin perfusion for heat dissipation. Hypervolemia
also can positively affect cardiac output via increased stroke
volume by providing larger vascular volume and filling pressure.
Furthermore, a reduced resistance as a result of decreased
blood viscosity may facilitate oxygen delivery to the exercising
muscle by improving perfusion and reduce the work required
by the heart. Further investigations are required to clarify
the mechanisms underlying the improvements in endurance
parameters observed in the present study.
In conclusion, the 6-s sprint HIHVT led to a shift toward
increased MHCIIa and decreased MHCIβ expression and a
trend toward decreased muscular oxidative capacity, but no
significant change in the glycolytic marker. Thus, HIHVT
induces two major constituents of a complete slow-to-fast fiber
type transformation at least on the mRNA level. The findings
reported here fully support one earlier study by Dawson et al.
(1998), but are to different extents at variance with many
previous findings (Jansson et al., 1990; Esbjörnsson et al., 1993;
Linossier et al., 1993; Andersen et al., 1994; Weston et al.,
1997; Burgomaster et al., 2006, 2008; Cochran et al., 2014;
Larsen et al., 2015). The biological response, Dawson et al.
(1998) and we observe upon sprint training, namely a slow-to-
fast fiber transformation, seems logical and in line with many
well-documented observations in animals (Pette and Vrbova,
1992). Nevertheless, the improvements in endurance exercise
performance demonstrate that the 6-s sprint HIHVT at the
same time is an effective and time-efficient training regimen to
induce training effects comparable to those of aerobic endurance
training. Since the changes seen in skeletal muscle cannot
explain the increased endurance exercise performance, other
mechanisms are likely to contribute to these improvements.
Indeed, it has been shown that plasma volume expansion alone
improves endurance performance (Berger et al., 2006).
