Skeletal muscle is highly adaptable and has consistently been shown to morphologically
respond to exercise training. Skeletal muscle growth during periods of resistance
training has traditionally been referred to as skeletal muscle hypertrophy, and this
manifests as increases in muscle mass, muscle thickness, muscle area, muscle
volume, and muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA). Delicate electron microscopy
and biochemical techniques have also been used to demonstrate that resistance
exercise promotes ultrastructural adaptations within muscle fibers. Decades of research
in this area of exercise physiology have promulgated a widespread hypothetical
model of training-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy; specifically, fCSA increases are
accompanied by proportional increases in myofibrillar protein, leading to an expansion
in the number of sarcomeres in parallel and/or an increase in myofibril number. However,
there is ample evidence to suggest that myofibrillar protein concentration may be diluted
through sarcoplasmic expansion as fCSA increases occur. Furthermore, and perhaps
more problematic, are numerous investigations reporting that pre-to-post training
change scores in macroscopic, microscopic, and molecular variables supporting
this model are often poorly associated with one another. The current review first
provides a brief description of skeletal muscle composition and structure. We then
provide a historical overview of muscle hypertrophy assessment. Next, current-day
methods commonly used to assess skeletal muscle hypertrophy at the biochemical,
ultramicroscopic, microscopic, macroscopic, and whole-body levels in response to
training are examined. Data from our laboratory, and others, demonstrating correlations
(or the lack thereof) between these variables are also presented, and reasons for
comparative discrepancies are discussed with particular attention directed to studies
reporting ultrastructural and muscle protein concentration alterations. Finally, we critically
evaluate the biological construct of skeletal muscle hypertrophy, propose potential
operational definitions, and provide suggestions for consideration in hopes of guiding
future research in this area.

What Is Hypertrophy?
INTRODUCTION
Etymology of the term hypertrophy reveals derivation from
the English term “
hyper-,”denoting “
above”or “
beyond,”and
Greek term “
-trophia,”denoting “
growth”or “
nourishment.”In
the context of resistance training, skeletal muscle hypertrophy
has been generally defined as an increase in muscle mass and
cross-sectional area (CSA) at the whole tissue and cellular
levels (Russell et al., 2000). Historically, muscle hypertrophy has
been posited to occur in response to the accrual of contractile
or structural proteins due to an increase in the number of
sarcomeres in parallel in pre-existing myofibrils of muscle
fibers, which results in an increase in fiber cross-sectional
area (fCSA) (Russell et al., 2000). Accordingly, it is logical to
assume that investigations reporting increases in muscle size
and myofibrillar protein alterations would clearly demonstrate
this phenomenon. However, while skeletal muscle hypertrophy
is considered a hallmark adaptation of resistance training of
sufficient duration, there have been inconsistent observations in
the scientific literature dependent upon the outcome variables
being reported. This, in part, is likely due to numerous methods
being used to assess skeletal muscle hypertrophy, and each of
these methods assess distinct characteristics of skeletal muscle.
Many studies in the literature detect regional adaptations using
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), computed tomography
(CT) scanning, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or
ultrasound assessment. Additionally, the percutaneous muscle
biopsy technique has allowed exercise scientists to examine
pre- and post-intervention differences in muscle fCSA. While
these techniques have provided excellent insight regarding how
exercise training affects body composition and muscle tissue
morphology, recent work from our laboratories, and that of
others, suggest that pre- to post-training change scores in these
measurements often correlate poorly with one another.
We are not the first to propose that measures and scales of
muscle growth are not strongly related. For instance, Dr. Edward
E. Gordon published a commentary by Gordon (1967) stating:
First, what is meant by hypertrophy: increase in girth of a limb,
volume of a muscle, or the related weight? Or, are we referring
to the individual muscle fiber, the smallest anatomical unit of
muscle? In [hypertrophy], the gross and microscopic dimensions
are regarded as running parallel courses, and therefore, as
being interchangeable. There would be no serious error if in
hypertrophy the sum of the enlarged parts equalled an increased
whole. But such an equation is not always found. (p. 129)
Gordon went on to note these discrepancies in his own
research and in the work from some of his contemporaries,
stating that there appears to be “
a complete dissociation between
whole muscle and fiber size in trained animals”(p. 130). Indeed,
historical literature is rife with examples that further support this
narrative. For example, in the first formal study on work-induced
hypertrophy, Morpurgo reported 26% greater fCSA values in
run-trained versus untrained animals, although only a 13%
increase in whole-muscle CSA was observed in the former group
(Morpurgo, 1897). Morpurgo related this finding to an increase
in sarcoplasmic volume [i.e., muscle intracellular fluid (ICF)],
rather than an increase in muscle fiber or myofibril number.
Likewise, decades later, Goldspink reported that 5 weeks of
resistance-like training of the biceps muscles in mice produced a
30% increase in fCSA relative to untrained, age-matched controls,
whereas muscle weights in both groups were nearly identical
(Goldspink, 1964). Other historical reports of biochemical and
ultrastructural changes underpinning changes in muscle size have
been inconsistent, which are discussed in following sections.
The aforementioned evidence calls into question what is
meant by the term skeletal muscle hypertrophy. We feel a critical
evaluation of the term and the construct validity of assessments
employed warrant special consideration by researchers moving
forward in this area of inquiry. In particular, researchers invoking
the term should agree on an operational definition so that
the construct validity of an assessment or assessments can be
better characterized and adopted for future research endeavors.
Therefore, we begin this review by briefly describing skeletal
muscle composition and structure, and provide a historical
overview of the scientific assessment of muscle hypertrophy.
Next, we discuss laboratory-based measurements used to assess
training-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy at the biochemical,
ultrastructural, histological, and gross anatomical levels, and
highlight the strengths and limitations of these approaches
as well as how they differ from one another. We then
present whole-body, whole-tissue, microscopic, and biochemical
assessments of skeletal muscle hypertrophy obtained by our
laboratory, and others’
, which demonstrate the degree of
agreeability –or lack thereof –between methods with particular
attention directed to muscle protein concentration alterations.
Finally, we provide potential operational definitions, suggestions
for future research, and discuss methods that could be adopted to
more accurately assess the biological construct of skeletal muscle
hypertrophy. While this review is centered on empirical data
obtained in humans, reference to pertinent animal models are
also provided where applicable given that this area of human
physiology has been largely preceded by delicate animal work.
SKELETAL MUSCLE COMPOSITION AND
STRUCTURE
Skeletal muscle tissue can be categorized into the following
levels of organization: (a) whole muscle sheathed by fascia
(i.e., epimysium), (b) muscle fibers within fascicle bundles
(i.e., peri- and endomysium), (c) myofibrils within individual
muscle fibers, (d) sarcomeres within individual myofibrils, and
(e) proteins (e.g., actin, myosin, and titin) within individual
sarcomeres (Figure 1).
Whole skeletal muscle is sheathed with connective tissue,
primarily composed of collagen protein, and is ∼75% fluid
by volume (Kjaer, 2004). Skeletal muscle can be separated
into intracellular (i.e., beneath the muscle fiber membrane)
and extracellular (i.e., outside the muscle fiber membrane)
components. The extracellular component is primarily composed
of connective tissue and vasculature, and connective tissue
generally occupies between ∼1–
20% of human skeletal muscle

which further separates muscle into fascicular bundles of
fibers and individual muscle fibers (Kjaer, 2004). Notably, the
connective tissue component is also adaptable and can vary in its
contribution to skeletal muscle size and strength. Muscle fibers
consist primarily of myofibrils, mitochondria, and a specialized
structure known as the sarcoplasmic reticulum. These are the
three major components of muscle fibers (Lindstedt et al., 1998),
although glycogen also constitutes ∼2–
3% and intramuscular
triglycerides ∼5% on average (van Loon et al., 2003; Gallagher
et al., 2005). The human skeletal muscle proteome was recently
“
reappraised”by Gonzalez-Freire et al. (2017), who employed
sensitive mass spectrometry-based techniques. Based on this
analysis, most of the proteins in skeletal muscle, by percentage,
are involved in metabolic processes rather contraction directly.
This counters the assumption that most of the proteins in
skeletal muscle serve a direct contractile role. The authors also
categorized around 40% of the total number of proteins in skeletal
muscle as enzymes and under 10% as contractile. Furthermore,
∼20% of proteins were characterized as mitochondrial apparently
serving roles in oxidative metabolism. Notably, these percentages
are relative to the total number of proteins in human skeletal
muscle, and not the concentration of proteins within skeletal
muscle. Traditionally, ∼60–
70% of the human skeletal muscle
mixed protein pool has been characterized as myofibrillar,
∼20–
30% as sarcoplasmic, and ∼5–
10% as mitochondrial (Haus
et al., 2007). Other estimates suggest that myosin represents
∼50% of myofibrillar protein concentration and actin ∼20%
(Yates and Greaser, 1983; Ingalls et al., 1998). Based on data
from Wang (1982) and Yates and Greaser (1983), titin typically
represents ∼10% of myofibrillar protein while nebulin, troponin,
and tropomyosin each represent ∼5%. Quantitatively, these
proteins seem to represent ∼95% of all myofibrillar proteins
by concentration. Mitochondrial, sarcoplasmic reticulum, and
t-tubule proteins have been estimated to occupy most of the
remaining mixed protein pool, while glycolytic enzymes and
other protein constituents of the sarcoplasm predominate the
remaining pool (Hoppeler and Lindstedt, 1985; Al-Qusairi and
Laporte, 2011). Figure 2 summarizes the percentage breakdown
of these components within muscle fibers.
FIGURE 2 | Composition of skeletal muscle tissue. These composition
estimates are based upon numerous studies which have utilized biochemical
and proteomics-based assessments described in text. IMTG, intramuscular
triglycerides; EC, extracellular; IC, intracellular; MF, myofibrillar; SARCO,
sarcoplasmic; MITO, mitochondrial.
Considering the composition and organization of skeletal
muscle tissue, it seems logical that training-induced increases
in fCSA would result in proportional increases in myofibrillar
protein abundance where concentrations would be largely
preserved. Indeed, since ∼60–
70% of muscle protein is made
up of myofibrillar proteins, a number of authors have posited
that skeletal muscle hypertrophy in response to resistance
training is due to an increase in myofibrillar protein abundance
and an increase in the number of sarcomeres in parallel in
existent myofibrils (e.g., sarcomerogenesis) or newly synthesized
myofibrils of existent muscle fibers (e.g., myofibrillogenesis)
(Paul and Rosenthal, 2002; Schoenfeld, 2010; Wisdom et al., 2015;
Franchi et al., 2017). For example, Damas et al. (2018) recently
defined “
true”hypertrophy as an “

and structural muscle proteins adding sarcomeres in parallel to
muscle fibers”(p. 487). However, this mode of skeletal muscle
hypertrophy in response to resistance training has strikingly little
direct supportive evidence in human skeletal muscle samples. To
the contrary, select evidence suggests a dilution of myofibrillar
protein in response to short-term resistance training which is
described in later sections. To better understand how we have
arrived at the current hypothesized model of training-induced
hypertrophy, the following section provides a brief historical
overview of the assessment of skeletal muscle hypertrophy.
Thenceforth, a survey of current-day methods and more detailed
discussion of the biological construct of muscle hypertrophy and
future directions follows.
HISTORICAL ASSESSMENT OF
SKELETAL MUSCLE HYPERTROPHY
Morpurgo (1897) was the first researcher to experimentally
observe work-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy in dog
sartorius muscle following 2 months of run training, which he
described as an increase in fiber diameter due to an increase
in sarcoplasmic volume. Following Morpurgo’
s seminal work,
alternative definitions and modes of work-induced skeletal
muscle hypertrophy emerged. For example, Helander (1961)
reported greater increases in muscle weights and myofibrillar
density in guinea pigs following regimented run training
performed 6 days per week for ∼4 months compared to control
or restricted-activity animals. Helander concluded, “
Exercise
thus enhances the myofilamental density in the muscle cell. . .”
(p. 482), whereas restricted activity “
. . . reduces its myofilamental
density and instead increases sarcoplasmic content”(p. 482).
Goldspink (1964) published a report that involved training mice
through a pulley apparatus designed to tax the biceps brachii
muscle. Following 25 days of training, mice were euthanized
and muscle was prepared for the histological assessment of
muscle fiber size and myofibril number per fiber in cross section.
The author noted a very strong correlation between myofibril
number per fiber and muscle fiber size, and this finding –
along with Helander’
s –helped shape the current-day consensus
that increases in fCSA and myofibrillar protein accretion are
proportional during resistance training. Other animal trials in
the 20th century agreed with or refuted these findings (Gordon
et al., 1967; Seiden, 1976), and Goldspink and Howells (1974)
associated disparate findings on specific modes of hypertrophy
with large variations in experimental design, and specifically,
differences in the dose of exercise.
The introduction of the Duchenne biopsy needle allowed for
percutaneous open biopsies to be obtained from humans (Parent,
2005). While isolated papers in the 1950s reported the allocation
of a biopsy technique in humans, it was not until Jonas Bergstrom
introduced his needle sampling technique in 1962 that these
methods were utilized more openly in human research related
to skeletal muscle hypertrophy (Ekblom, 2017). Penman (1969)
was the first to characterize ultrastructural alterations in human
skeletal muscle tissue in response to three forms of exercise
training which were categorized as isotonic, isometric, or run
training. Interestingly, all three modes of training reduced the
concentration of “
myosin fibers,”which Penman characterized as
the number of myofibrils within a 5 µm2 area of muscle fibers.
In a subsequent 1970 exercise training investigation, Penman
reported ∼40% increases in maximum strength, although he also
observed reductions in the distance between myosin filaments
and modest reductions in gross cell diameter following 10 weeks
of training which involved 5 sessions per week of both leg
extensions and running exercise (Penman, 1970). Penman
interpreted these findings to indicate that increased strength of
skeletal muscle in response to resistance training without an
increase in fiber size involved an increased “
packing density”
of contractile elements. Although pioneering, Penman’
s 1969
investigation included only 6 subjects (2 in each condition), and 3
subjects in the 1970 investigation, prohibiting sufficient statistical
power for population-wide inference. Following Penman’
s work,
a seminal 1982 paper by MacDougall et al. (1982) used
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methods and reported
reductions in biceps brachii myofibrillar and mitochondrial
volumes as well as an increase in sarcoplasmic volume in response
to 6 months of resistance training in previously untrained human
subjects. Furthermore, muscle samples from a group of seven
bodybuilders and powerlifters were compared to the previously
untrained subjects who underwent 6 months of resistance
training, and authors reported that this analysis revealed lower
myofibrillar volume and greater sarcoplasmic volume in the
fibers of bodybuilder and powerlifter subjects. These authors
provocatively concluded that decrements in myofibrillar volume
with increased resistance training experience may have been
related to greater glycogen accumulation and/or increases in
ICF beyond that related to glycogen accumulation (e.g., ∼3 g
of water/1 g of stored glycogen, increased ion or organelle
abundance), particularly in the bodybuilder and powerlifter
subjects. Notwithstanding, the contribution of sarcoplasmic
constituents to muscle fiber hypertrophy during resistance
training has remained largely unexplored.
Between 1970 and 1990, studies by Gollnick, Saltin, Tesch,
Staron, Sale, MacDougall, Alway, and others utilized the
Bergstrom technique to histologically evaluate muscle fiber
type composition and fCSA differences between well-trained
weightlifters and untrained subjects (Gollnick et al., 1972; Staron
et al., 1984; Tesch et al., 1984; Larsson and Tesch, 1986; Sale
et al., 1987; Alway et al., 1988). While most of these studies
examined the vastus lateralis (VL), some studies biopsied the
deltoid, soleus, biceps brachii, or trapezius muscles. In the 1990s,
several exercise physiology laboratories sought to determine how
weeks to months of resistance training affected VL muscle fCSA
values in untrained individuals. Notably, Staron, Hikida, and
many others performed seminal work in this area (Staron et al.,
1990, 1991, 1994; Wang et al., 1993), and this research has
been carried on by several other laboratories in the 21st century
(Hikida et al., 2000; Kadi et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2005; Mackey
et al., 2007, 2011; Petrella et al., 2008; Mitchell et al., 2012;
Snijders et al., 2016; Stec et al., 2016; Reidy et al., 2017b; Mobley
et al., 2018). Collectively, most of these studies have demonstrated
that, in general, weeks to months of resistance training increases
mean (type I and II) fCSA. While there have been a handful

of training studies that have integrated both histological and
TEM methods to describe microscopic and ultrastructural
adaptations (Luthi et al., 1986; Toth et al., 2012), most of the
post-1980s research in this area only performed histological
assessments given that TEM methodologies are painstaking and
not widely accessible. Comparatively fewer investigations have
used biochemical methods to assess skeletal muscle myofibrillar
and/or sarcoplasmic protein concentration adaptations following
periods of training, and these studies are discussed below in
greater detail. In addition to the seminal microscopy work
discussed above, early post-spaceflight investigations of muscle
mass and thin filament density changes from LeBlanc et al.
(2000) and Riley et al. (2000) also paved the way for MRI and
delicate microscopic inquiry of muscle adaptation to training.
The aforementioned literature demonstrates that a common
goal of several laboratories for over a century has been to
assess how training affects indices representative of skeletal
muscle hypertrophy. Yet, a clear definition of hypertrophy
is difficult to elucidate and depends on which literature, or
scientist, is consulted.
WHAT ARE THE MOLECULAR
UNDERPINNINGS OF SKELETAL
MUSCLE HYPERTROPHY?
In 2010, a co-author of the current review (B.J.S.) defined
skeletal muscle hypertrophy as an expansion of contractile
elements and extracellular matrix of skeletal muscle cells
(Schoenfeld, 2010), pointing to the addition of sarcomeres in
parallel and/or addition of myofibrils being largely responsible
for increases in cell size based on supporting evidence
from Paul and Rosenthal (2002) and Tesch and Larsson
(1982). Although this hypothesis is logical, neither investigation
clearly provided counts of myofibrils or sarcomeres, which
warrants reconsideration of the specific mode of short-term
resistance training-induced hypertrophy in human fibers. Lloyd
(2013) provided the elegantly simple definition of cell growth
as mass accumulation. Given the potential for conflicting
definitions, it seems appropriate to operationally define skeletal
muscle hypertrophy as an increase in skeletal muscle mass.
However, this definition may oversimplify the compositional
alterations that occur during skeletal muscle hypertrophy in
response to resistance training that can affect muscle function.
Alternatively stated, if hypertrophy is defined as an increase
in mass, then this definition insufficiently communicates what
specifically is altered within a skeletal muscle cell in response
to resistance training and how the increase affects muscle
function. Moreover, since the type of resistance training (e.g.,
chronic heavy versus light loading) likely results in specific
compositional alterations, this consideration is vital to the
comprehensive understanding of the specificity of skeletal
muscle adaptation.
As stated above, resistance training-induced hypertrophy is
thought to occur primarily through the addition of sarcomeres in
series or in parallel in existent myofibrils (i.e., sarcomerogenesis),
or due to the synthesis of new myofibrils in existent muscle fibers
(i.e., myofibrillogenesis). Paul and Rosenthal (2002) eloquently
summarized this model by stating:
“
. . . muscle fibers may increase in diameter, as is found in singly
innervated muscles, to increase the number of myofibrils in
parallel. Alternatively, intrafascicularly terminating fibers could
elongate, effectively increasing the number of fibers as well as
myofibrils in parallel”(p. 751).
In reference to sarcomerogenesis, Wisdom et al. (2015)
posited, “
On the subcellular scale, in response to elevated forces,
more sarcomeres, the force-producing units of muscle, are built
and added in parallel, increasing muscle cross sectional area”
(p. 207). Interestingly, Wisdom and colleagues cited work from
Johnson and Klueber (1991) and Farup et al. (2012) as evidence to
support their hypothesis, although neither study directly assessed
sarcomere abundance or myofibrillar protein concentration.
Upon activation, muscle contractile force is produced by myosin
and actin cross-bridge formation, the myosin power stroke,
and transmission of tensile forces across the fiber (Tyska and
Warshaw, 2002; Karatzaferi et al., 2004). Therefore, at the single
fiber level, hypertrophy has been posited to coincide with the
maintenance of or increase in specific tension (N/cm2) through
the addition of sarcomeres in parallel (Wisdom et al., 2015;
Dankel et al., 2018). However, select evidence has failed to
confirm this relationship. For example, Meijer et al. (2015) have
reported that lower specific tensions (N/cm2) exist in single fibers
isolated from bodybuilders with significantly larger fCSAs when
compared to muscle fibers from controls and power athletes.
Furthermore, in 1969 (although using a surgical ablation model
in rodents) Rowe reported ∼25% decreases in specific tension
although CSAs of muscle samples significantly increased (Rowe,
1969). These conflicting observations could be explained by
differential mechanisms of fCSA increases. For instance, fCSA
and cell mass can increase through an expansion of other
cell constituents in lieu of contractile protein changes (e.g.,
ICF, t-tubule or sarcoplasmic reticulum volume, sarcoplasmic
proteins, or mitochondrial volume). Indeed, as far back as 1976
Seiden reported robust increases in fiber diameters of rodent
muscle were largely associated with increases in sarcoplasmic
reticulum and t-tubule volumes in the context of “
work-induced
hypertrophy” while no apparent increases were observed in
myofibril densities (Seiden, 1976). Also, it stands to reason that
some individuals may realize significant increases or decreases
in myofibrillar protein content or myofibril number while
others may not in response to the same training or unloading
intervention. Research in humans in this regard seems equivocal
(D’
Antona et al., 2006; Trappe, 2009; Canepari et al., 2010;
Meijer et al., 2015).
A lack of evidence explicitly showing serial or parallel
sarcomere number increases in human fibers after resistance
training precludes the confident conclusion that myofibrillar
protein accretion is largely responsible for, or proportional to,
increases in fCSA. In fact, upon extensive review of the literature,
it remains to be clearly determined if increases in sarcomere
or myofibril number, and therefore protein abundance, strongly
correlate with increases in fCSA in response to short-term

What Is Hypertrophy?
resistance training in human fibers. Conversely, and as suggested
by MacDougall’
s seminal 1982 publication, select evidence points
to the contrary, at least in the short-term. For instance, Hody et al.
(2011)1 used proteomics to analyze VL muscle obtained from
humans prior to and following 2 weeks of eccentric-emphasis
resistance training and reported a decrease in various contractile
proteins and an increase in the expression of oxidative enzymes.
As noted early on by Goldspink and Howells (1974), these
observations could be related to the specific dose of resistance
training. There are several reasons why this may be the case. For
example, early adaptations to muscle fibers in response to novel
training stimuli may consist primarily of preparatory structural
remodeling or metabolic changes that set the stage for subsequent
growth. Also, cell damage experienced in response to a novel
training stimulus is associated with increased swelling/edema and
this could affect assessments of protein abundance at various
time points. Nevertheless, decades of anecdotal observations in
the practical setting of individuals realizing significant increases
in muscle mass in response to chronic resistance training
suggests eventual increases in contractile protein abundance.
Moreover, recent evidence from van der Pijl et al. (2018) in mice
suggests increased sarcomeres in series and parallel resulting in
hypertrophy in response to unilateral diaphragm denervation.
Additionally, a host of studies employing tracer methods
reporting significant increases in myofibrillar protein synthesis
rates in response to resistance training in the fasted and
fed states provide robust support for the notion that chronic
resistance training results in myofibrillar protein accretion
(Louis et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2005; Moore et al., 2005;
Cuthbertson et al., 2006; Carrithers et al., 2007; Kumar
et al., 2009, 2012; West et al., 2009; Burd et al., 2010;
Holm et al., 2010; Camera et al., 2012; Witard et al.,
2014). Notwithstanding, while these tracer studies have been
insightful, it is noteworthy that the measurement of myofibrillar
protein synthesis rates are not synonymous to measurements
of myofibrillar protein concentrations, myofibril number, or
sarcomere number. Moreover, it seems the investigation of
ultrastructural and biochemical alterations to resistance training
have been deprioritized in lieu of delicate tracer work.
Consequently, the hypothetical model of proportional increases
in myofibrillar protein concentration concomitant with increases
in fCSA lacks robust evidence. With this in mind, macroscopic
and microscopic assessments of hypertrophy are briefly described
below while a comparatively greater breadth of attention is
devoted to the molecular assessment of hypertrophy in the
“
Molecular assessment”section that follows.
MEASUREMENT OF HYPERTROPHY
For parsimony, we divide measurement techniques pertaining
to each of these levels into the following categories: (a)
macroscopic measurements, (b) microscopic measurements, and
(c) molecular measurements.
15 sessions per week for 2 weeks consisting of 3 sets of 30 maximal voluntary
contractions of the quadriceps muscle.
Macroscopic Assessment
Assessments of whole-body composition change are not the
focus of this review; however, certain whole-body and other
anthropometric assessments are commonly employed to infer
that muscle hypertrophy has occurred. These whole-body
assessments will not be described or discussed in the same
detail as more direct muscular assessments but deserve mention
and brief description in this section given their macroscopic
nature and inclusion in Figure 3. These include air displacement
plethysmography
(e.g.,
Bod
Pod),
hydrostatic
weighing,
bioelectrical impedance, skinfolds, and other anthropometrics
involving handheld measuring tapes and tools. These techniques
are primarily used to estimate fat and fat-free mass. Since skeletal
muscle tends to occupy a large percentage of fat-free mass,
an observed increase in fat-free mass based on these methods
is commonly thought to indicate hypertrophy has occurred,
although this is not necessarily the case given that many other
factors contribute to fat-free mass (e.g., fluid).
Air

plethysmography
uses
whole-body
densitometry to estimate body composition (fat and fat-free
mass). Hydrostatic or underwater weighing measures mass
per unit of body volume in order to calculate body density
and is based on Archimedes’principle. Once body density is
calculated, fat and fat free mass can be estimated. Bioelectrical
impedance estimates total body water by calculating opposition
to the flow of an electric current. Fat and fat-free mass can be
estimated from total body water. Skinfolds are performed by
pinching specific locations of skin and underlying subcutaneous

relative
to

locations. Skinfold thicknesses can be summed and used to
estimate body composition using various formulae. Technically,
anthropometrics encompasses any assessment of body size,
shape, and composition. However, in Figure 3, we are referring
to the systematic measurement of segment girths in order
ascertain changes in size potentially due to hypertrophy. While
each of these assessments can be considered macroscopic, they
do not directly assess muscle tissue.
The focus of this section is on common measurements in
research studies which aim to directly assess muscle tissue and
intuit that muscle hypertrophy has occurred. A description of
each measurement approach is outlined below in order to provide
context as to how each measure differs and what the implications
of those differences may be. A host of measurement techniques
exist to assess hypertrophy in accordance with a set dimension;
that is, thickness (1D), CSA (2D), volume (3D), and mass.
Muscle Thickness Assessment Using Ultrasound
Muscle thickness, as assessed by B-mode ultrasonography, is a
rapid, easy, relatively inexpensive, and non-invasive assessment
of gross muscle size. To measure muscle thickness, investigators
often image the mid-belly of a muscle and measure the linear
distance between the deep and superficial aponeurosis of the
muscle of interest (Franchi et al., 2018b). While muscle thickness
has been shown to be highly reliable in a range of muscles
(intra-class correlations, or ICCs = 0.65–
0.94) (Thoirs and
English, 2009), it is limited in that it is only representative
of one dimension of the muscle. For example, relative to

What Is Hypertrophy?
FIGURE 3 | Different assessments used to monitor resistance training-induced adaptations. The diagramed techniques are utilized to measure whole-body
adaptations down to molecular adaptations to resistance training. Particular attention in this review is devoted to localized, microscopic, ultramiscroscopic, and
molecular assessments. Images are either from our laboratory or were obtained online where reuse for educational purposes was not restricted.
muscle thickness, muscle width, and length may hypertrophy
differently, and proximal changes may be different than distal
changes. This point was recently demonstrated by Vigotsky et al.
(2018), who reported that hypertrophy of different regions of the
same muscle are not strongly correlated within an individual.
Additionally, ultrasound is highly dependent on the skill of the
investigator, given that differences in the pressure exerted by the
transducer against the skin can result in substantial variations
in measurements and thus high inter-rater error rates. Thus,
ultrasound-based assessments of muscle thickness provide a fast
and practical assessment of 1D muscle size, but the quality of
these assessments may very well be rater-dependent.
DXA
Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was originally designed to
measure bone mineral parameters and is now a widely used
method to assess skeletal muscle mass changes. Whole-body
DXA scans render 2D images, although these scans can provide
mass and density estimates when calibrated against a phantom
of known density. Additionally, region of interest tools can be
used to quantify appendicular lean masses. Newer DXA scanners
have been shown to produce excellent test-retest ICCs with
regard to assessing fat-free/bone-free lean tissue mass during
whole-body scans (e.g., >0.99) (Kephart et al., 2016). Unlike
one-dimensional ultrasound assessments and other methods
discussed below, however, DXA has the inability to discriminate
between muscle groups. Additionally, while DXA can distinguish
bone, fat, and fat-free/bone-free lean tissue, it cannot distinguish
muscle tissue from intramuscular fluid, nor is it sensitive enough
to detect intramuscular fat. DXA can also be highly influenced
by hydration status and other factors described by Nana et al.
(2015) in greater detail which also persuade careful methods
and interpretation. Notwithstanding, DXA can be used as a
non-invasive assessment of gross and segmental lean body mass.
CT
Computed tomography was introduced in the early 1970s
(Hounsfield, 1973) and has the ability to provide high-contrast,
2D images with pixel intensities related to tissue density.
Tissues often measured include adipose and skeletal muscle
(Heymsfield et al., 2014). When used as a measurement of muscle
hypertrophy, it is common for images to be manually segmented
for specific muscles or muscle groups and then quantified. CT
is considered a reliable and valid method of assessing changes

in muscle CSA. For example, Verdijk et al. (2009) reported
coefficients of variation of 0.6% for repeated scans of muscle
CSA using CT methods and inter- and intrarater reliability
coefficients of 0.996 and 0.997, respectively. A drawback to
CT scanning is that subjects are exposed to larger doses of
radiation relative to DXA along with being costly per scan
(Prado and Heymsfield, 2014).
pQCT
Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) was
originally developed for bone density (Gasser, 1995), but has
been validated to measure training-induced changes in muscle
size (DeFreitas et al., 2010) and has been reported to largely
agree with MRI measurements (R2 = 0.98). Beyond the work
of DeFrietas et al. to our knowledge, there are no other studies
directly comparing pQCT with other measures in response to
a hypertrophy stimulus pointing to the need for researchers to
consider this method of assessment in future work. A strength
of this measurement is the ability to detect intramuscular
fat concentration which could indicate skeletal muscle quality
(Sherk et al., 2014). Similar to DXA and CT, however, a
limitation of the pQCT is that it cannot distinguish between
muscle tissue and intramuscular fluid. Therefore, it likely reflects
changes in contractile protein as well as potential alterations
in training-induced fluid shifts or glycogen changes. There also
seem to be no standardized protocols for imaging or analysis, so
comparing studies is difficult (Erlandson et al., 2016).
Panoramic/EFOV Ultrasound
Panoramic and extended-field-of-view (EFOV) ultrasound are
new techniques that use traditional ultrasound B-mode imaging,
but “
stitch”together a series of images, so as to reconstruct
a larger, wider 2D image. These techniques have primarily
been applied for the assessment of anatomical CSA (ACSA)
and fascicle length. Research shows that panoramic ultrasound
displays a range of concordance correlation coefficients (CCC)
when estimating hypertrophy and atrophy compared to MRI
(CCC = 0.37–
0.78) (Scott et al., 2017). Axially, EFOV ultrasound
has been shown to be both valid and reliable for assessing
extensor carpi ulnaris fascicle lengths (Adkins et al., 2017).
Additionally, mid-thigh area muscle assessments using EFOV
ultrasound and CT scans have been shown to agree well with each
other (Noorkoiv et al., 2010). However, Bland-Altman plots have
demonstrated that panoramic ultrasound images from several
muscle groups typically yield lower ACSA values compared to
MRI values (Scott et al., 2012). These findings highlight the
nuances required when interpreting results using whole muscle
imaging, in that there are likely muscle- and dimension-specific
differences in validity and reliability.
MRI
Magnetic resonance imaging is non-invasive, has excellent
resolution, allows discrimination between separate muscles,
and is commonly thought of as the reference standard for
regional muscle mass assessment (Smeulders et al., 2010). MRI
uses radio pulse waves to induce the nuclear spin of atomic
particles –particularly those in hydrogen –and electromagnetic
fields are used to localize those particles. Therefore, MRI is
particularly useful for studying hydrogen-dense soft tissue, such
as adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. For MRI-based volume
assessments, a series of 2D cross-sectional slices are obtained
and integrated as a function of distance to obtain volume (i.e.,
V =
� ins
orig ACSA(x)dx). Test-retest values for select upper and
lower-body muscles have yielded exceptionally high ICCs (e.g.,
0.99) (LeBlanc et al., 2000; Smeulders et al., 2010). Although
these measures are the most accurate in terms of capturing
changes in gross muscle size, MRI equipment is not widely
accessible and the scans are costly; therefore, its use is scarcer
in the literature. Furthermore, while MRI is considered the gold
standard for assessing the 2D area or segmental volume of a
particular muscle group, it does not glean molecular adaptations
that occur within fibers [e.g., changes in contractile protein
concentration, sarcoplasmic protein concentration, intra- versus
extracellular fluid (ECF), etc.] nor does it uncover the metabolic
and functional nature of the tissue compared to other methods
(Hellerstein and Evans, 2017).
Three-Dimensional Ultrasound (3DUS)
Three-dimensional ultrasound is a newer, promising approach
to capturing 3D muscle architecture with standard B-mode
ultrasound. By combining ultrasonography with 3D motion
capture, the location and orientation of each frame of an
ultrasound video can be transformed into the lab coordinate
system (Mozaffari and Lee, 2017). Thus, the muscle boundaries
in each digitized frame can be reconstructed in 3D, from which
muscle volume (or area) can be calculated. These approaches
have been validated against MRI (ICC > 0.99) (Barber et al.,
2009). In addition, 3DUS allows for the quantification of
fascicle-level geometry in 3D (Rana et al., 2013), which classically
has been difficult to measure. Such insights show promise for
improving our understanding of not only muscle geometry, but
also function (Franchi et al., 2018b).

strom was one of the first to utilize these methods
in the evaluation of muscle tissue in mice by staining cardiac
musculature with black India ink and using light microscopy
to examine the structure of the samples. While his interests
ultimately were the transverse tubules, he also found light
and dark bands (isotropic and anisotropic bands, respectively)
stretching the distance of each sarcomere (Nystrom, 1897).
Shortly thereafter, the first study on skeletal muscle hypertrophy
was conducted by Morpurgo examining the effect of run
training on skeletal muscle hypertrophy in dogs which had
their left sartorius muscle removed before undergoing 2 months
of training (Morpurgo, 1897). After sacrificing the dogs, the
right sartorius muscle was evaluated using light microscopy to
examine sections adhered to slides with particular interest in
fCSA change. Much of the work evaluating hypertrophy at the

What Is Hypertrophy?
cellular level between the late-1800s and the mid-1900s utilized
animal models, and similar to present day, the sectioning of
muscle tissue for observation using microscopy. As mentioned
previously, it was not until the Bergstrom needle was introduced
in 1962 that these methods were utilized more openly in research
related to skeletal muscle hypertrophy in humans. The Bergstrom
method can yield tissue weights ranging from ∼25 to ∼300 mg.
Studies conducted prior to 1960 such as the aforementioned,
and those of the modern era share many of the same
fundamentals of sample extraction and preparation with many of
the differences coming via technological advancement of imaging
programs and the introduction of computer based models to
aid in evaluation. The procurement of muscle biopsies are safe,
minimally invasive, and can be performed as an outpatient
procedure using the modified Bergstrom technique (Shanely
et al., 2014). The basic methods of tissue processing are as follows
(Verdijk et al., 2009; Mobley et al., 2017): (a) approximately
20–
40 mg of tissue is typically placed into a cryomold with media
before slow freezing in isopentane cooled by liquid nitrogen and
subsequent storage at −80◦C, (b) samples are cut in thin slices
ranging ∼5–
20 µm thick and are adhered to a slide, and (c)
different methods can be used to stain the samples for evaluation
of mean fCSA or fiber type-specific fCSA such as those described
in Haun et al. (2017), Roberts B.M. et al. (2018), Wang et al.
(2015), and Verdijk et al. (2009). In general, light is emitted from
the microscope and passed through a filter to isolate a specific
frequency which is absorbed by the specimen, and nanoseconds
later, light is returned from the specimen (Stokes shift) which is
filtered by selected band pass filters (FITC, DAPI, TRITC, etc.) to
illuminate the image returned in a certain manner based on the
fluorophores used in the staining process (Sanderson et al., 2014).
Typically, the returned images are captured between 10 and
20× magnifications before being evaluated through specialized
software or manual measurement, although different laboratories
employ distinct techniques which have contributed to some of the
variation in findings (further discussed below).
The hypertrophic response to resistance training correlates
strongly to the volume of training as discussed by Schoenfeld
(2010), suggesting a dose response relationship exists. In this
regard, Tesch and Larsson (1982) found that muscle tissue
from the medial deltoid and the VL obtained from high
level bodybuilders exhibit larger slow twitch fiber fCSA values
compared to recreationally trained individuals, although fibers
exhibiting fast twitch properties yielded similar fCSA values
between cohorts. Additionally, Meijer et al. (2015) reported
that bodybuilders completing moderate to high volume training
display greater mean fCSAs compared to untrained individuals
and strength/power athletes. However, it is also important to
note that while all fiber types were larger, there was a significant
difference between type I fCSA of bodybuilders as compared
to untrained individuals and strength/power athletes, yet no
meaningful difference between type I fCSA of the untrained
group and the strength/power group. Additionally, Eriksson et al.
(2006) conducted a study in high level powerlifters, some of
which self-reported use of anabolic steroids, and found that there
may be potential for fiber splitting along the length of a muscle
fiber with chronic high intensity loading which could have the
potential to present an increase in fiber quantity and perhaps a
decrease in mean fCSA when analyzing via microscopy.
Interestingly,
fCSA
adaptations
to
resistance
training
are usually relatively greater than any other hypertrophy
surrogates when expressed as percent change (described in
the
“
Measurement
Agreement” section).
Regarding
fCSA
hypertrophy, consideration of the fiber type (e.g., I, IIa, and IIx)
seems warranted, as evidence has revealed fibers exhibit different
magnitudes of hypertrophy following periods of resistance
training (Fry, 2004). Reporting of mean fCSA, which accounts
for all fibers, may result in different change scores compared to
reporting type I or type IIa muscle fibers independently. Kosek
et al. (2006) reported that mean type II fCSA (which weights
the percent distribution of both IIa and IIx fibers) exhibited
∼32% hypertrophy in young adult fibers following 16 weeks
of resistance training, yet type IIa fibers demonstrated ∼25%
hypertrophy and type I fibers ∼18%.
Although
a
sensitive
assessment
of
skeletal
muscle
hypertrophy, there are also limitations of fCSA calculations,
such as the method of tissue processing, biopsy location, and
measurement methods. For example, it is practically impossible
to biopsy the same location in a muscle twice, so any changes
in size observed are assumed to extrapolate to surrounding
fibers, or the same fibers along their length. The climate of a
laboratory, buffers, and other factors during tissue processing can
affect measurements of fiber size. For instance, since a muscle
cell is ∼70% fluid, tissue processing can create variability of
water retention in the muscle sample; and this could potentially
alter findings assuming unstandardized processing procedures
from one sample or from one laboratory to the next. Muscle
glycogen concentration could also affect muscle fCSA, and this
variable often remains unreported in manuscripts providing
fCSA measurements. Additionally, muscles can hypertrophy in a
non-uniform manner (distal versus proximal), which would not
be detected with single-site measurements (Narici et al., 1996).
Furthermore, a variety of fiber-sizing software and laboratory
methods described in the published literature could differentially
affect percent change calculations. It is common for authors to
devote only a few sentences to description of how fibers are sized
upon image capturing. For example, some laboratories randomly
select 25–
50 fibers for manual sizing while others size 100 or
more using specialized software (Lau et al., 2018; Wen et al.,
2018). Unfortunately, this often leaves absent specific calibration
procedures, disclosure of the training protocol used for the rater,
and the specific software or technique used to calculate fCSAs. In
this regard, it has been reported that VL type II fCSA increases
from ∼6,000 to ∼8,400 µm2 in college-aged men following
12 weeks of resistance training (Snijders et al., 2016), whereas
our laboratory as well as Reidy et al. have reported that VL type
II fCSA increases from ∼5,100–
5,500 to ∼6,000–
6,500 µm2
during this same time course in this same population (Mobley
et al., 2017; Reidy et al., 2017b). Another independent laboratory
has reported that VL type II fCSA increases from ∼6,200
to 7,500 µm2 in college-aged men following 16 weeks of
resistance training (Bellamy et al., 2014). Considering these
apparent discrepancies, it stands to reason that research subject
characteristics like previous or current activity levels and

nutrition habits could be contributing factors; while differences
in the training interventions and tissue processing methods
between laboratories could also explain the disagreement.
We feel that both more appropriate and transparent method
descriptions and standardization between labs can help resolve
some of these discrepancies moving forward.
Molecular Assessment
The molecular signature that coincides with skeletal muscle
hypertrophy in response to resistance training has largely been
understudied, but can be inferred by analyzing changes in
protein sub-fractions within biopsied tissue through differential
centrifugation protocols followed by simple biochemical assays
(e.g., Bradford or bicinchoninic acid assays), polyacrylamide
gel
electrophoresis,
immunoblotting
for
specific
proteins
of
interest,
or
larger-scale
proteomic-based
assessments.
Although theoretically simple, these methods produce practical
challenges that often prevent laboratories from employing
them. However, we feel this area of inquiry is vital to our
comprehensive understanding of skeletal muscle adaptation
to training. The measurement of skeletal muscle myofibrils
dates back at least as far as 1957 when Hanson and Huxley
(1957) used extraction, solubilization, and polyacrylamide-gel
based separation techniques to quantify myosin and actin
concentrations. More recent studies have used various methods
to determine how resistance training affects myofibrillar and/or
sarcoplasmic protein concentrations, and given that assessment
methods have been inconsistent, discordant findings have
resulted. For instance, Shelmadine et al. (2009) reported ∼50%
increases in myofibrillar protein concentration following 28 days
of resistance training. Willoughby and Rosene (2001) similarly
reported ∼40% increases in myofibrillar protein concentration
after 12 weeks of resistance training, and have also reported
∼85% increases in myofibrillar protein concentrations 6 h after
a single session of resistance training (Willoughby and Nelson,
2002). Cribb and Hayes (2006) and Cribb et al. (2007) have
reported similar increases in myofibrillar protein concentration
after 10 weeks of resistance training in two separate studies.
However, a comparatively greater number of authors have
reported no alteration in protein concentration or an apparent
decrease in response to resistance training. For instance, Brook
et al. (2015) reported no significant change in total soluble
protein concentration after 6 weeks of resistance training
(pre: 521 ± 34 mg/g, post: 552 ± 28 mg/g dry weight). Haus
et al. (2007) reported no significant change in myofibrillar,
sarcoplasmic, myosin, or actin protein concentration after
either 35 or 90 days of resistance training 2–
3 days per week.
Woolstenhulme et al. (2006) reported no significant change
in protein concentration after 8 weeks of resistance training
although significant increases in type II fCSA occurred.
Carrithers et al. (2002) reported no significant change in
total, sarcoplasmic, myofibrillar, myosin, or actin protein
concentrations after 5 weeks of resistance training. Trappe et al.
(2011) reported no significant change in the total percentage
of water or protein content of biopsy samples after 12 weeks
of resistance training in older adults. Our laboratory recently
reported that high and low hypertrophic responders to 12 weeks
of resistance training did not (on average) present increases in
myofibrillar or sarcoplasmic protein concentrations (Roberts
M. D. et al., 2018). Although assessed through TEM, it is
notable that Toth et al. (2012) and MacDougall et al. (1982)
have both reported decreases in myofibril density concomitantly
occur with fCSA increases following 18 weeks and 6 months
of resistance training, respectively, although Luthi et al. (1986)
reported no change in myofibril density following 6 weeks of
training. Additionally, the aforementioned work by Penman in
the 1960s suggest reductions in myosin density occur following
brief periods of resistance training (Penman, 1969). Although
in animal muscle samples, other authors have also reported
no change or reductions in myofibril density in response to
short-term resistance training-induced hypertrophy (Goldspink
and Howells, 1974; Seiden, 1976). Furthermore, the studies
described previously showing lower specific tension (i.e., N/µm2)
in larger fibers or hypertrophied fibers in response to resistance
training seem to support a potential dilution of myofibrils.
A summary of these human studies are presented in Table 1.
In interpreting these data, increases in myofiber size with
no change in myofibrillar protein concentration would indicate
that cellular growth occurs with proportional increases in
myofibril protein accretion. That is, the stoichiometry of the
muscle cell would be mostly preserved in this case. Conversely,
increases in myofiber size with a decrement in myofibrillar
protein concentration would indicate that the protein pool is
being diluted through increases in ICF or other sarcoplasmic
constituents. As mentioned above, select reports have curiously
suggested that resistance training robustly increases myofibrillar
protein concentrations, which would indicate that substantial
myofibrillar packing occurs within the first few weeks to
months of training. Alternatively stated, such findings suggest
myofibril protein accretion far outpaces cell growth. Therefore,
these inconsistent reports on the molecular and ultrastructural
adaptations to resistance training warrant additional research.
Beyond alterations in contractile and sarcoplasmic proteins,
potential
fluid
shifts
are
a
commonly
underappreciated
molecular aspect of skeletal muscle adaptation to resistance
training. Sensitive assessment of skeletal muscle fiber fluid
volume has traditionally been completed by weighing frozen,
hydrated samples on laboratory scales with ≤0.1 mg sensitivity,
freeze-drying samples in a vacuum-sealed benchtop apparatus,
and calculating the difference between hydrated and dehydrated
tissue weights after re-weighing on the same scale. Only a few
investigations in humans have reported alterations in wet and
dry weights after a period of exercise training. For instance,
Reidy et al. (2017a) reported significant increases in muscle
tissue fluid content and fCSA after 12 weeks of resistance
training but no significant change in protein concentration.
Mora-Rodriguez et al. (2016) also reported significant increases
in skeletal muscle sample water content but significant decreases
in total protein concentration after 4 months of aerobic exercise
training. Harber et al. (2009) similarly reported significant
increases in muscle water content and significant decreases in
myofibrillar protein concentrations after 12 weeks of aerobic
exercise training, although fCSA measurements significantly
increased. Given the potential influence fluid volume may exert

on fCSA measurements used to surmise hypertrophy after an
exercise intervention, it seems critical that water content be
accounted for when analyzing microscopic and molecular-level
hypertrophy. However, it should be noted that the freeze-drying
method cannot delineate ICF from ECF levels. Thus, other
techniques are needed to determine these metrics, and this is
discussed in greater detail below.
MEASUREMENT AGREEMENT
While
the
direct
comparison
of
different
methods
of
hypertrophic assessment are sparse, there are data suggesting
that
macroscopic,
microscopic,
ultramicroscopic
and/or
biochemical indices of skeletal muscle hypertrophy following
resistance training have poor agreement. A recent study that
perhaps best demonstrates this phenomenon is by Franchi et al.
(2018a), who observed that, while percent change increases
in ultrasound-assessed VL muscle thickness and MRI-derived
CSA showed strong correlations following 12 weeks of leg
extensor resistance training (r = 0.69), ultrasound findings were
poorly associated with MRI-derived calculations of muscle
volume (r = 0.33). DXA is highly correlated with both MRI and
CT measures of muscle area when assessed at a single point
in time (Levine et al., 2000; Maden-Wilkinson et al., 2013).
However, DXA shows only a moderate correlation with CT
(r = 0.52) when assessing changes in muscle mass following
regimented resistance training, and its high measurement error
raises questions as to suitability for determining subtle changes
in muscle mass over the course of a regimented resistance
training protocol (Delmonico et al., 2008). Consistent with
this hypothesis, Snijders et al. (2015) reported statistically
greater increases in MRI-assessed thigh muscle CSA in a
protein-supplemented versus placebo group following a 12-week
resistance training program; however, lower extremity lean
mass as measured by DXA failed to show statistically significant
changes from pre- to post-study.
There are also differences when comparing the degree
of hypertrophy between MRI and biopsy fCSA metrics. For
example, Narici et al. (1996) reported a 2% increase in VL
fCSA, but a 7% increase in VL CSA measured by MRI
following 6 months of resistance training. These authors
reported that differences existed when comparing either of those
two measurements to whole quadriceps measurements, which
increased by 15%. Another study by Aagaard et al. (2001)
compared changes in VL muscle size using MRI, biopsy, and
ultrasound after 14 weeks of resistance training. These authors
reported a ∼16% increase in fCSA, yet only a ∼10% increase
in muscle volume. Additionally, a positive relationship existed
between the change in fCSA and CSA assessed via MRI, although
this correlation was only moderate (r = 0.58). As previously
mentioned, several studies have also noted fCSA increases in
response to resistance training yield greater relative change
scores compared to other hypertrophy surrogates. For example,
Esmarck et al. (2001) reported a 7% increase in VL CSA assessed
by MRI and a 22% increase in VL fCSA following 12 weeks of
resistance training. Verdijk et al. (2009) reported an 8.5% increase
in quadriceps CSA assessed by CT, but a 28% increase in Type II
fCSA. Frontera et al. (1988) reported a 10% increase in quadriceps
CSA assessed by CT, but ∼28% increase in VL fCSA. Moreover,
when analyzing data from a recently published study from our
laboratory (Haun et al., 2018), the top 10 hypertrophic responders
to 6 weeks of high-volume resistance training experienced a 23%
increase in right VL fCSA, although upper right lower extremity
lean mass assessed by DXA only increased by 8.8% and mid-thigh
thickness assessed via ultrasound only increased by 2.1%.
When associating ultrastructural and histological adaptations
to resistance training, there is no clear relationship. As stated
above, the landmark TEM work by Penman and MacDougall
suggests that the concomitant dilution of myofibrillar proteins
with fCSA increases may occur with resistance training.
Remarkably, these data agree with studies performed decades
later. For instance, Toth et al. (2012) reported that 18 weeks
of resistance training resulted in a statistically significant

What Is Hypertrophy?
13% decrease in VL myofibrillar protein area (assessed via
TEM), although no changes were noted in fCSA. Additionally,
Harber’
s group reported 12 weeks of cycle ergometer training
in older, untrained subjects increased fCSA by ∼20%, increased
quadriceps CSA (assessed via MRS) by 12%, and increased
knee extensor power by 55% (Harber et al., 2009). Yet,
myofibril protein concentrations (assessed through biochemical
methods) decreased by ∼14%. Yet, Harber’
s group has also
shown that elite runners myofibrillar protein concentrations
are higher than recreational runners (Reidy et al., 2014).
Observations of increased micro-/macro-structural variables
indicative of skeletal muscle growth along with improvements
in functional performance metrics led the authors to justifiably
conclude aerobic exercise training resulted in significant muscle
hypertrophy. Nevertheless, it is intriguing that this study similarly
observed various indices of muscle hypertrophy occurred in lieu
of decrements in myofibrillar protein levels.
Importantly, many of the supposedly discrepant findings
compared above originate from different methods and this will be
further discussed in a later section. However, the aforementioned
studies in this section demonstrating that different surrogates
of hypertrophy seemingly disagree with each other prompted
our laboratory to examine VL myofibrillar protein concentration
differences between high versus low anabolic responders
following a 12-week full body resistance training program
(Roberts M. D. et al., 2018). Response clusters were generated
based on pre- to post-training changes in right VL muscle fCSA
(type I + type II fibers), VL thickness assessed via ultrasound, and
total body muscle mass (TBMM) assessed via DXA. Participants
in the upper and lower 25th percentiles were classified as high
(HI, n = 13) and low (LO, n = 12) hypertrophic responders,
respectively. Notably, this clustering method indicated HI
responders presented significantly greater increases in lower
body strength [assessed via three repetition maximum (3RM)
back squat] relative to LO responders (mean ± SE: �3RM
squat = +42 ± 3 kg, LO �3RM squat = +31 ± 9 kg; p = 0.005),
and we noted an advantage of our clustering method included
its association with a functional strength outcome. On average,
pre-to-post training changes in VL fCSA were +1426 ± 253 µm2
(mean ± SE) in HI responders and +5 ± 209 µm2 in LO
responders (p < 0.001). However, no significant between- or
within-cluster changes in myofibrillar protein concentrations
were observed, and regardless of response cluster, there was
not an association between pre-to-post training changes in
fCSA and myofibrillar protein concentrations (r = −0.014,
p = 0.947). Table 2 displays Pearson’
s r correlation values between
whole-body, regional, microscopic, and ultrastructural indices of
skeletal muscle hypertrophy from the subjects of this study.
Notably, the data in Table 2 includes percent change scores
in DXA TBMM, VL thickness, VL fCSA, VL myofibrillar
protein concentrations, VL sarcoplasmic protein concentrations,
and VL myosin protein concentrations. It is apparent that
ultrastructural indices of skeletal muscle hypertrophy typically
agree well with one another. For instance, moderate correlations
exist for raw delta as well as percent change scores in myosin
protein and myofibrillar protein concentrations (r = 0.61).
Moderate correlations also exist for raw delta as well as percent
change scores in myosin protein and sarcoplasmic protein
concentrations (r = 0.71). However, microscopic assessments do
not agree well with ultrastructural assessments or macroscopic
assessments, and vice versa. To this point, we also performed
simple correlations for each of the surrogate measures of
hypertrophy on data from all subjects regardless of cluster
for greater statistical power (aside from myofibrillar and
sarcoplasmic protein concentration changes due to lack of
available sample from this study). Briefly, changes in VL thickness

produced correlation coefficients ranging from r = 0.06–
0.25 in
relation to changes in fCSA and DXA TBMM. Changes in type I
and type II fCSA correlated weakly with changes in DXA TBMM
(r = 0.18, r = 0.13, respectively).
Considering these findings against the background of the
current hypothetical model of RT-induced skeletal muscle
hypertrophy presents a conundrum. For decades, it has been
assumed that the deposition of sarcomeres in parallel in existent
myofibrils, or the genesis of new myofibrils in existent muscle
fibers results in the observed expansion of fCSA and macroscopic
assessments of muscle size in response to RT interventions.
However, it is clear from the above data that this assumption
lacks consistent and explicit empirical support. After performing
an extensive search of the scientific literature, it is apparent
that no studies have directly quantified sarcomere number in
parallel prior to or following resistance training in human
fibers. Furthermore, the few studies employing TEM methods
to provide myofibril densities were severely underpowered
having analyzed few fibers and few subjects, and although
critical first steps, do not allow confident population-wide
inferences. Strikingly, of the available evidence surveyed wherein
molecular and microscopic measurements occurred prior to
and following resistance training, a reduction in myofibrillar
protein concentrations concomitant to observed increases in
fCSA has been a more common finding. According to the widely
assumed model of resistance training-induced hypertrophy,
a maintenance of myofibrillar protein concentration should
coincide with an increase in fCSA. Moreover, this occurrence
should produce an increase in macroscopic measures of muscle
size including muscle thickness, muscle mass, and muscle
volume. Yet, the current state of the evidence tells a different
and relatively inconsistent story. Based upon the current available
evidence, Figure 4 summarizes how resistance training-induced
skeletal muscle hypertrophy occurs at the macroscopic level and
may occur at the ultrastructural level.
POTENTIAL EXPLANATIONS AND
LIMITATIONS
The first and most obvious drawback when comparing biopsy
data to regional or whole body metrics is that the biopsy
specimen is small (e.g., 100 mg) relative to the VL muscle,
and more so, relative to the musculature of the whole body.
In relation to characterizing ultrastructural indices using TEM,
inadequate sampling is an imminent concern given that dozens
(not hundreds) of partial fiber areas are typically analyzed (Alway
et al., 1988). Another viable concern with small samples from
both fCSA and TEM is a regression to the mean phenomenon
from sampling sites, since it is impossible to biopsy the same
location twice. This can make repeated measures difficult to
correlate because large or small values can skew results (Barnett
et al., 2005). Further compounding this issue is the lack of true
controls in most training studies to help correct for repeated
measures sampling complexity.
With regard to biochemical assays to determine myofibrillar,
sarcoplasmic, myosin, and actin protein concentrations, we
recently reported that an adopted method from Alfred Goldberg’
s
FIGURE 4 | Mechanisms of resistance training-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Numerous studies have demonstrated that resistance training increases muscle
thickness (assessed using B-mode ultrasound) as well as muscle CSA (assessed with CT or MRI) (A). Likewise, numerous studies have reported that fCSA increases
occur with resistance training (B). However, the ultrastructural and molecular adaptations to resistance training remain largely unresolved (C).

What Is Hypertrophy?
laboratory (Cohen et al., 2009) yields good separation of
contractile and non-contractile proteins and is sensitive to detect
5–
25% changes in protein concentrations (Roberts M. D. et al.,
2018). However, it is currently difficult to decipher how resistance
training affects subcellular protein concentrations given that
multiple methods have been used (Willoughby et al., 2002; Cribb
and Hayes, 2006; Shelmadine et al., 2009; Roberts M. D. et al.,
2018), and some of these reports using TRIzol-based methods
have likely not accurately reported myofibrillar protein levels
given that this method (Kopec et al., 2017): (a) leads to inefficient
protein retrieval due to poor solubilization of precipitated protein
pellets, and (b) does not contain a sufficient detergent (e.g.,
Triton) to lyse membrane structures. In addition to these points,
although mitochondrial volume has been consistently shown
to decrease in response to resistance training (Groennebaek
and Vissing, 2017), alterations in sarcoplasmic reticulum and
t-tubule volumes have been largely unexplored in human skeletal
muscle in response to training interventions; and changes
in these structures could contribute to observed increases or
decreases in fCSA. Moreover, disproportionate increases in ICF
volume may occur with resistance training, albeit there is no
current microscopic or biochemical method to directly decipher
this phenomenon.
Limitations to various muscle imaging techniques also exist.
For instance, although MRI can estimate total fluid content
within a scan (Ogino et al., 1994), standard MRI, x-ray, and
ultrasound measurements cannot account for potential ECF and
ICF shifts that may occur with training. This is a critical point
that is oftentimes underappreciated given that ECF, which does
not represent the intracellular milieu and contributes to mass
and thickness changes, significantly increases with higher-volume
resistance training (Haun et al., 2018). Thus, the tandem use
of regional bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) with
regional (e.g., thigh muscle area or volume) or whole body scans
is a fruitful area for exploration. In this regard, we recently
used DXA to determine that 6 weeks of voluminous resistance
training increased whole-body DXA LBM by +1.34 kg from
weeks 1 to 3 and an additional +0.85 kg from weeks 4 to 6
in 30 previously trained college aged males (Haun et al., 2018).
When adjusting pre- to post-training changes in DXA LBM for
BIS-extrapolated ECF changes, however, a significant increase
occurred from weeks 1 to 3 (+1.18 kg), but not from weeks
4–
6 (+0.25 kg). Hence, using methods that accurately account
for ICF and ECF shifts which occur during resistance training
may provide more insight as to whether true hypertrophy
occurs. Although BIS-based calculations of ECF and ICF have
been shown to strongly agree with sodium bromide dilution
and deuterium oxide-based assessments (Moon et al., 2008;
Birzniece et al., 2015), it remains to be investigated how valid and
reliable BIS-based assessments are compared to other methods
in context of resistance training-induced hypertrophy and fluid
alterations. Furthermore, Reidy et al. (2017a) have reported
∼4 % increases in plasma volume after 12 weeks of resistance
training and a significant decrease in the percentage of muscle
water (−0.1–
1.3%) which also persuades the measurement of
whole-body and muscle biopsy sample fluid content for more
accurate inference. A relatively new technique proposed by
Hellerstein and Evans (2017) deemed the ‘
Virtual Biopsy’
shows
promise in this regard by assessing whole-body muscle mass
using metabolic labeling techniques for flux-rate measurements
in humans which focus on skeletal muscle, specifically.
When interpreting and contrasting the results of different
gross-level measurements, the dimensionality of each needs to be
considered. Of course, volumes, areas, and thickness are three-,
two-, and one-dimensional, respectively, but understanding what
this means in the context of hypertrophy requires deeper thought.
Starting from a unidimensional level, muscle can grow in
three different, orthogonal directions. For instance, it may be
possible that a muscle grows wider but not thicker, or has
differential growth in different directions or parts of the muscle.
A unidimensional measure, such as thickness via ultrasound,
is inherently limited in capturing these possibilities; changes
in off-axis lengths will not be captured. Area can, to some
extent, account for some of these differences, in that it captures
growth across an entire plane. If absolute growth does occur in
off-axis directions (e.g., a muscle not only grows thicker, but
also wider), or even on parallel axes, we should not expect area
to scale linearly with thickness. If thickness predominates, then
a linear relationship between thickness and area should hold
(Franchi et al., 2018a). Conversely, volume not only takes into
account changes in muscle length, but also heterogeneities in
area along the muscle. For instance, a muscle may grow more
distally than proximally. Such heterogeneities are best captured
by taking advantage of the full dimensionality of the construct
itself –muscle is three-dimensional. This may be why thickness
changes scale with area, but not volume (Franchi et al., 2018a).
Unfortunately, our understanding about the dimensionality and
heterogeneity of growth itself is limited; these properties may be
muscle and protocol-specific.
It is also noteworthy that muscle CSA assessment using
imaging techniques can be measured as one of two constructs
including ACSA and physiological CSA (PCSA). The former
can be assessed at any point along the muscle, and is often
defined to be the CSA orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the
segment on which the muscle is located (i.e., in the transverse
plane). Alternatively, PCSA is the muscle area orthogonal to a
muscle’
s fibers; therefore, greater discrepancies will exist between
ACSA and PCSA with greater pennation. In contrast to ACSA,
PCSA is assessed by measuring muscle volume and dividing it
by average fiber length (usually at optimal length). Therefore,
PCSA is a measure of the average CSA orthogonal to the
fiber orientation and is seemingly related to the number of
sarcomeres in parallel (Lieber and Ward, 2011). Although PCSA
is more related to a muscle’
s function than ACSA, the latter is
more commonly reported, primarily due to the methodological
limitations of obtaining PCSA.

What Is Hypertrophy?
operationally define skeletal muscle hypertrophy in an objective
manner. To serve as rationale for our proposed definition and
types of skeletal muscle hypertrophy, we encourage readers
to consider that various types of hypertrophy have been
characterized in both cardiac and smooth muscle (Johansson,
1984; Mihl et al., 2008), although the construct of hypertrophy
is consistent in these definitions.
We propose that skeletal muscle hypertrophy be generally and
simply defined as an increase in skeletal muscle size accompanied
by an increase in mineral, protein, or substrate abundance (e.g.,
glycogen and intramuscular triglyceride). However, considering
the reviewed evidence, we encourage the formal adoption of
three types of skeletal muscle hypertrophy worthy of further
inquiry: (a) connective tissue hypertrophy, (b) myofibrillar
hypertrophy, and (c) sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. Connective
tissue hypertrophy can be defined as an increase in the volume
of the extracellular matrix of skeletal muscle accompanied by
an increase in mineral or protein abundance. Sarcoplasmic
hypertrophy can be defined as a chronic increase in the
volume of the sarcolemma and/or sarcoplasm accompanied
by an increase in the volume of mitochondria, sarcoplasmic
reticulum, t-tubules, and/or sarcoplasmic enzyme or substrate
content. Myofibrillar hypertrophy can be defined as an increase
in the size and/or number of myofibrils accompanied by an
increase in sarcomere number or sarcomeric protein abundance
directly related to the structure or contractile force generation
of the sarcomere.
Considering these definitions, we feel it is critical to appreciate
the fact that measurement techniques assess different constructs
and these differences do not necessarily make a measurement
better or worse, but simply different. Resource constraints,
technical capabilities, and potential risks to participants are
factors that inherently affect the selection of assessments of
muscle hypertrophy. To dismiss methodologies that provide
less resolution of molecular changes based solely on this fact
is inappropriate as good reliability of a test can be incredibly
useful for examining changes over time and inferring effects of
resistance training interventions. That is to say, while macro- and
microscopic tests do not directly assess myofibrillar protein
accrual and fCSA, increases in these variables should result in
eventual increases in macroscopic indices. Stated differently,
while some methods of detecting true hypertrophy are more
vivid (e.g., myofibrillar protein), lower resolution methods
aren’
t useless as they would almost certainly be corollaries of
true hypertrophy.
While it can be difficult to reconcile why different methods
used to assess skeletal muscle hypertrophy in response to
resistance training do not always agree, we posit that certain
procedures can be adopted to clarify research findings in
the field. First, if a single measure of hypertrophy is being
examined (e.g., VL thickness at the mid-thigh) and is found
to increase in response to training, then we view reporting
that mid-thigh VL thickness increased in response to resistance
training rather than stating muscle hypertrophy occurred is a
more accurate representation of the data. That is, unless multiple
levels of measurement are adopted along with assessment of fluid
alterations, we encourage the reporting of the measurement itself
rather than concluding “
skeletal muscle hypertrophy”occurred
alone. Alternatively stated, we feel clear language pertaining to
the outcome data of a method should be explicitly reported to
better portray the nature of a specific measurement. Second,
if multiple indices of skeletal muscle hypertrophy are being
collected, then it would be valuable to include associations
between the measures in order to provide the reader greater
insight as to how well or poorly the measurements agree.
Third, when possible, we posit that using methods to determine
regional fluid shifts that account for ICF and ECF changes
could better delineate the mode of hypertrophy and whether
mass changes in a region of interest were largely due to fluid
accumulation. Certainly, this assumes the research question
centers around true protein accretion and not simply an
expansion of other microscopic or macroscopic assessments as
dependent variables, specifically.
We recently reported ECF-corrected LBM measures to better
characterize hypertrophic responses to RT beyond ECF retention
potentially due to edema. Although surface electrode BIS
possesses limitations given that greater subcutaneous adipose
tissue thickness values can negatively influence skeletal muscle
impedance readings (Tagliabue et al., 2001), a newer fine
needle BIS approach using small subcutaneous needles to bypass
subcutaneous fat holds promise for more accurate ICF and ECF
assessments (Kwon et al., 2017). Another viable strategy worthy
of consideration is to include multiple indices of skeletal muscle
hypertrophy at various levels. As an example, our laboratory has
implemented K-means cluster analysis based solely upon changes
in VL thickness to generate low, moderate, and high anabolic
response clusters to 12 weeks of resistance training (Mobley et al.,
2018). As discussed earlier, we subsequently adopted a different
approach in these same subjects by generating clusters based
upon a composite hypertrophy score which entailed percent
changes in DXA TBMM (which only considers appendicular lean
mass changes), VL thickness using ultrasound, and fCSA, and
selected high and low hypertrophic responders whose composite
scores existed in the upper and lower quartiles (Roberts M. D.
et al., 2018). Notably, in the former publication we did not
observe a between-cluster interaction for 3RM squat strength
although, as stated above, our latter publication yielded a
cluster × time interaction for 3RM squat strength whereby
strength gains were greater in high responders. Likewise, a
similar multi-variable cluster approach has been adopted by
Davidsen et al. (2011), and more recently by Morton et al. (2018)
to stratify high-responders and low-responders to resistance
training. Thus, if clustering subjects in hopes of characterizing
specific phenotypes or predicting adaptive responses thereof is
the nature of the research question, we feel using a composite
hypertrophy score containing multiple indices (e.g., fCSA +
DXA data + limb circumference + muscle thickness, etc.)
may be a viable approach. This approach can be thought of
as a form of dimensionality reduction; hypertrophic responses
can be measured in a number of ways, so procedures such as
principal component analysis can yield values that are linear
combinations of the predictor variables of interest, and a way that
can account for much of the variance. However, as pointed out by
Rucker et al. (2015), researchers should thoughtfully consider the

specific research question prior to clustering as discretization of
continuous data can potentially result in erroneous conclusions.
Often, if explaining variation in hypertrophic responses to
resistance training is the primary aim via predictors of interest,
researchers would likely be better served to include all subjects
and their raw, continuous scores in the analysis for greater
statistical power.
Finally, calculating the test-retest reliability of hypertrophic
assessments to establish standard errors of measurement is also
a powerful strategy to more confidently conclude if hypertrophy
occurred and direct further exploration. Conceptually, changes
beyond calculated measurement error can allow researchers to
infer that the specific construct being assessed by the employed
technique changed beyond the error of the measurement,
regardless of the extent. Often, test-retest reliability is unreported,
and depending on the calculated error of measurement, changes
within various ranges after resistance training interventions
may be better explained by measurement error rather than
true variation in the construct being assessed due to the
research intervention. As an example, reliability statistics from
our laboratory for macroscopic, microscopic, and molecular
assessments of hypertrophy are shown in Table 3. Both absolute
values (expressed in the unit of the measurement) and relative
values (expressed as percentages of the measurement) can be used
to construct confidence intervals beyond which changes scores
may be more associated with factors other than measurement
error. Importantly, even the calculation of measurement error
possesses a certain degree of confidence, and this is not posited
to negate changes within the calculated range of error, as these
changes could still be real. Nevertheless, the combination of the
calculated measurement error and the measured change itself
provide more information to the researcher, and reader, and
can improve the interpretation and presentation of data. Ideally,
in the case of a well-controlled resistance training intervention,
hypertrophic outcomes could be better associated with the effects
of training rather than measurement error itself.
To
summarize,
we
propose
the
following
strategies
for consideration:
(1) Although we too have underappreciated measurement
error previously, we feel a worthwhile future strategy
in the hypertrophy literature is to consistently report
test-retest
reliability
statistics
and/or
calculated
standard errors of measurements to better understand
changes more associated with training, nutritional, or
supplementation interventions. By understanding the
expected error of measurement with certain confidence,
changes in molecular, microscopic, and macroscopic
assessments
of
muscle
hypertrophy
can
be
more
accurately surmised with improved confidence.
(2) If molecular levels of measurement are not directly
assessed, researchers should report the results of the
measurement itself clearly stating the outcome measure
in its associated unit instead of invoking the general term
hypertrophy alone. For example: “
According to DXA,
lower extremity lean mass increased by 1 kg.”rather than
“
According to DXA, muscle hypertrophy occurred.”
(3) Future work can help clarify the specific type of skeletal
muscle hypertrophy occurring from an intervention by
assessing connective tissue, myofibrillar, and sarcoplasmic
fractions of muscle.
(4) Finally, investigators should choose and justify muscle
size assessments based on that which best answers their
research question. Assessments on different scales are not
inherently better or worse, but they are different insofar as
their construct validity.
CONCLUSION
Assessing
the
macroscopic,
microscopic,
and
molecular
adaptations to resistance training has been a widespread research
goal for exercise physiologists since the 19th century. Given the
current knowledge-gap regarding the ultrastructural adaptations
to resistance training, we hope that future research will better
characterize the biochemical and ultrastructural underpinnings
of skeletal muscle hypertrophy. While different assessment

that this conundrum provides tremendous opportunity for
future researchers to build upon current methods or generate
newer and more valid methods to better assess skeletal
muscle hypertrophy.
