Background: There is currently conflicting evidence surrounding the effects of obesity on postoperative
outcomes. Previous studies have found obesity to be associated with adverse events, but others have found
no association. The aim of this study was to determine whether increasing body mass index (BMI) is an
independent risk factor for development of major postoperative complications.
Methods: This was a multicentre prospective cohort study across the UK and Republic of Ireland.
Consecutive patients undergoing elective or emergency gastrointestinal surgery over a 4-month interval
(October–December 2014) were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was the 30-day major
complication rate (Clavien–Dindo grade III–V). BMI was grouped according to the World Health
Organization classification. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to adjust for patient, operative
and hospital-level effects, creating odds ratios (ORs) and 95 per cent confidence intervals (c.i.).
Results: Of 7965 patients, 2545 (32⋅0 per cent) were of normal weight, 2673 (33⋅6 per cent) were
overweight and 2747 (34⋅5 per cent) were obese. Overall, 4925 (61⋅8 per cent) underwent elective and
3038 (38⋅1 per cent) emergency operations. The 30-day major complication rate was 11⋅4 per cent (908
of 7965). In adjusted models, a significant interaction was found between BMI and diagnosis, with an
association seen between BMI and major complications for patients with malignancy (overweight: OR
1⋅59, 95 per cent c.i. 1⋅12 to 2⋅29, P = 0⋅008; obese: OR 1⋅91, 1⋅31 to 2⋅83, P = 0⋅002; compared with
normal weight) but not benign disease (overweight: OR 0⋅89, 0⋅71 to 1⋅12, P = 0⋅329; obese: OR 0⋅84,
0⋅66 to 1⋅06, P = 0⋅147).
Conclusion: Overweight and obese patients undergoing surgery for gastrointestinal malignancy are at
increased risk of major postoperative complications compared with those of normal weight.

Introduction
The
incidence
of
obesity
is
rising
rapidly
across
high-income countries, with the current prevalence in
the USA (36 per cent) and UK (26 per cent) expected to
double by 20501. It is estimated that up to 66 per cent of
patients undergoing surgery in the UK are overweight2.
Current evidence is conflicting regarding the impact
of obesity on postoperative complications after major
surgery. Contemporary multicentre studies3–7 in spe-
cific patient groups from Japan, Denmark, Switzerland
and the USA have associated obesity with worse or
neutral short-term postoperative outcomes. A recent
risk-adjusted analysis from the US National Surgical Qua-
lity Improvement Program (NSQIP) identified an ‘
obesity
paradox’in non-bariatric surgery, whereby overweight and
obese patients had a lower adjusted risk of postoperative
mortality8.
With at least 600 000 major gastrointestinal opera-
tions being carried out each year in the UK, knowing
whether obesity increases postoperative complication rates
is important for patients, doctors and commissioners9. If
increasing body mass is associated with worse outcomes,
patients may benefit from perioperative optimization.
Depending on the type and timing of surgery, this may
include nutritional optimization before surgery, the appli-
cation of beneficial technology (such as minimally invasive
surgery) and access to high-dependency postoperative care.
Firm evidence would provide justification for research to
assess these programmes, as there may be unintended
consequences, including malnutrition, associated with
weight loss.

As the variable of interest is body mass index (BMI),
randomized trials assigning patients to subgroups of inter-
est (normal weight, overweight and obese) are not possible.
Current evidence is thus based on analysis of observational
data. A dedicated, prospective analysis in a broad group of
patients undergoing elective and emergency surgery with
a preplanned, detailed risk adjustment strategy is lacking.
This prospective study aimed to determine associations
between BMI and postoperative morbidity following elec-
tive and emergency major gastrointestinal surgery in the
UK and Ireland.
Methods
The protocol for this multicentre prospective cohort study
was disseminated through a multinational medical student
and trainee surgical collaborative network (with coverage
in the UK and Republic of Ireland)10. This network has
been described in detail elsewhere11–13. Briefly, teams of
medical students with senior registrar and consultant over-
sight collected data on consecutive patients across 2-week
periods. Results are reported according to Strengthening
the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
(STROBE) and Statistical Analyses and Methods in the
Published Literature (SAMPL) guidelines14,
15. National
Research Ethics Service review of the protocol deemed
that full ethical review was not required owing to the
observational and anonymous nature of this study. Each
participating centre was responsible for local registration
as service evaluation or clinical audit. In the Republic
of Ireland, each participating centre was responsible for
completing the research ethics process at their centre, as
required by local guidelines.
Eligibility criteria
Consecutive adult patients (aged at least 18 years) undergo-
ing gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary surgery were included
in the study. At each centre a minimum 2-week interval
was selected for patient inclusion between 1 October and
12 November 2014; multiple non-overlapping 2-week
periods per hospital were allowed. Eligible procedures
were those involving surgery on any part of the gas-
trointestinal tract or biliary tree, including a hospital
admission with an overnight stay. Both elective and
emergency procedures performed using open, laparo-
scopic, laparoscopically assisted or robotic approaches
were included. Patients undergoing day-case, urological,
gynaecological, vascular or transplant procedures were
excluded.
Outcome measures
The Clavien–Dindo system was used to define post-
operative complications, whereby complication severity
is defined by the subsequent treatment required16. This
classification system is a validated means to determine
the severity of postoperative complications based on
the treatment received. All postoperative events were

included, even when there was no direct relationship with
the surgery. Each patient’
s highest Clavien–Dindo grade
complication was recorded. The primary outcome measure
was the 30-day major complication rate (Clavien–Dindo
grade III–V), which included endoscopic, radiological
or surgical reintervention (Clavien-Dindo III), unex-
pected critical care admission (Clavien–Dindo IV) and
death (Clavien–Dindo V). The secondary outcome was
the surgical-site infection (SSI) rate, chosen as it has
been associated with obesity previously6, defined by the
Centers for Disease Control definition17. Additional sec-
ondary outcome measures listed in the protocol included:
outcomes for underweight patients, system-specific com-
plications, unplanned admission to the critical care
unit, reoperation and readmission. For the purposes
of clarity, these will be described in detail in further
reports.
Main explanatory variable
The main explanatory variable was preoperative BMI,
assessed either in the preoperative assessment clinic or on
admission. This was calculated as weight (in kilograms)
divided by height (in metres) squared. As the primary
aim of this study was to assess the effect of being over-
weight or obese, patients were stratified by BMI accord-
ing to groups defined by the World Health Organization
(WHO): normal weight (BMI 18⋅5–24⋅9 kg/m2), over-
weight (BMI 25⋅0–29⋅9 kg/m2) and obese (BMI at least
30⋅0 kg/m2)18.
Explanatory variables
Explanatory variables were collected in order to provide
a risk-adjusted estimate. Variables were predefined and
selected on the basis of clinical plausibility. The following
patient- and operation-level factors were selected.

Patient
T
o account for co-morbidities, the American Society of
Anesthesiologists (ASA) fitness grade was recorded and the
Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) calculated for each
patient. The ASA grade takes into account disease severity
and is a reliable metric for the measurement of postoper-
ative mortality and complications19. The RCRI is used to
estimate a patient’
s risk of perioperative cardiac complica-
tions, including cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarc-
tion and non-fatal cardiac arrest20. Age, sex and smoking
status were also collected.
Operation
A novel Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)-based operative
risk score was devised in order to determine the mortality
risk associated with each specific operation. HES are
summary, population-level data available from National
Health Service administrative records. From this aggregate
data, a summary of mortality rates by procedure during
2009 and 2010 was obtained as the most recent available,
procedure-level data. Procedures included in the study
were identified and classified according to their 30-day
mortality rate into predefined strata of low-risk (less than
1 per cent), moderate-risk (1– 9⋅9 per cent) and high-risk
(10 per cent or more) groups (Table S1, supporting
information). Additionally, diagnosis (benign versus malig-
nant), urgency of surgery (elective versus emergency)
and operative approach (open versus laparoscopic) were
included.
Data accuracy
Before data collection, all collaborators were invited to
attend investigator meetings and complete a mandatory
online training module. T
o ensure high data quality, only
submitted data sets with over 95 per cent completeness
for both case ascertainment and the study data fields were
eligible for inclusion. If a large proportion of data was
missing, data would be imputed using Markov chain Monte
Carlo equations. In addition, a process of data validation
was performed by independent collaborators. T
en per cent
of all included patients were validated independently for
accuracy. T
welve key predefined data points were validated
for each patient (age, sex, height, weight, Index of Multiple
Deprivation decile, Malnutrition Universal Screening T
ool
score, timing of BMI measurement, urgency of operation,
postoperative critical care admission, complications, return
to theatre, readmission). A data point was defined as a single
value in each of the data fields for an individual patient.
The overall accuracy was calculated according to number
of correct validated data points divided by the total number

of validated data points. The case ascertainment rate was
determined by independent review of theatre logbooks
for eligible cases, cross-referenced against the number of
actual cases submitted.
Data handling
Data collection was performed using the secure research
electronic capture database (REDCap) system21. The sub-
mitted data were then checked centrally and, where missing
data were identified, the local investigator was contacted
and asked to complete the record. Once vetted, the record
was accepted into the data set for analysis.
Sample size
This study was powered to detect a minimum signifi-
cant difference between obese and normal-weight patients,
although no upper limit on patient numbers was set
owing to the nature of the study. A minimum of 3550
normal-weight and obese patients would provide 80 per
cent power to detect a 2⋅8 per cent increase in major
postoperative complication rate from 8 to 10⋅8 per cent
(α = 0⋅05). This was based on previous estimates and a
complication rate increase that would be deemed clinically
significant11.
Statistical analysis
There was likely to be considerable selection bias in rou-
tine practice that influenced the crude outcome of this
study. This is related to individual patient risk factors
and the risks of the operation they are undergoing (for
example obese patients may have higher risk owing to
co-morbidity; equally they may have better outcome after
lower-risk bariatric surgery). Additionally, there may be

bias in how patients are treated across hospitals. Multilevel
models were used to determine unbiased distributions
of fixed-effect regression coefficients for the outcomes
of major complication rate (primary outcome measure)
and SSI (secondary outcome measure). The hospital was
considered as a single, level 1 random effect, with indi-
vidual patient and operative risks entered as level 2 fixed
effects. Age was expressed as a continuous variable with
corresponding odds ratios (ORs) relating to a per-year
increase. Explanatory variables contained within statistical
models were selected based on clinical plausibility and
independence, and model selection was informed using
the Akaike information criterion. Effect estimates are
presented as ORs and bootstrapped 95 per cent confidence
intervals, and statistical significance expressed as P values.
ORs were generated to describe the relationships between
BMI groups and the outcome of interest. An OR greater
than 1 represented increased likelihood in the experimen-
tal group (obese) versus the control group (normal BMI).
The OR describes the relationship between an explanatory
variable and an outcome in terms of odds of suffering a
complication, rather than the risk. The OR was consid-
ered to be statistically significant at the P < 0⋅050 level.
All relevant second-order interactions were examined.
Differences between categorical demographic groups were
tested using the Kruskal–Wallis test or Welch’
s t test for
continuous data or χ2 test for proportions. T
wo-sided
statistical significance was defined at the level of P < 0⋅050.

Fig. 2 Analysis of the interaction between body mass index (BMI) and diagnosis using recoded variables. Odd ratios are shown with 95
per cent confidence intervals
Data analysis was undertaken using R Foundation Sta-
tistical software (R 3.2.1) with the Hmisc, ggplot2, plyr,
lme4, reshape2, RCurl, splines and stringr packages (R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
Results
Of 10 272 records submitted from 163 centres, 9264 eligi-
ble records were submitted to the final analysis (Fig. 1). Of
these, 7965 (86⋅0 per cent) had a preoperative BMI mea-
surement; 2545 patients (32⋅0 per cent) were of normal
weight, 2673 (33⋅6 per cent) were overweight and 2747
(34⋅5 per cent) were obese. Independent validation of 1008
patients with 12 096 data points showed that the accuracy
was 98⋅0 per cent and the case ascertainment rate 92⋅2
per cent.
Demographics
There were significant differences in patient character-
istics across BMI groups (Table 1). Patients in the over-
weight group were older and patients in obese group
were younger than those of normal weight; both groups
were more likely to undergo lower-risk surgery and more
likely to be operated on using a laparoscopic approach.
Obese and overweight patients had higher ASA and RCRI
scores, reflecting greater co-morbidity, but normal-weight
patients underwent proportionally more emergency and
higher-risk procedures. The missing data were minimal
and therefore imputation was not required.
Case mix
Overall, malignancy was the most common diagnosis,
followed by appendicitis and gallstone disease (Table 2). In
the overweight and obese groups, more procedures were
undertaken for gallstone disease than in the normal-weight
group. Of the obese patients, 14⋅3 per cent underwent
bariatric surgery. Obese patients were more likely to
have laparoscopic surgery (69⋅6 versus 54⋅2 per cent
of normal-weight patients), which corresponded with
overweight and obese patients undergoing less risky pro-
cedures than normal-weight patients. However, obese
patients were still subjected to high-risk surgery, with 30⋅8
per cent undergoing emergency surgery and 45⋅8 per cent
a moderate- or high- risk operative procedure (Table 1).
Outcomes
For all patients, the overall 30-day major (Clavien–Dindo
III–V) complication rate was 11⋅4 per cent (908 of 7965
patients). The overall SSI rate was 5⋅9 per cent (472 of
7965), increasing to 11⋅1 per cent (90 of 808) in those
undergoing emergency colorectal resection. An unadjusted
breakdown of these outcomes by BMI group is shown in
Table 3.

(Table 4) and for SSI (Table 5). T
aking these interactions
into account produced adjusted ORs for each group
(Fig. 2). Overweight and obese patients with malignancy
were at greater risk of major complications. Obese patients
with malignancy were at greater risk of SSI. There were
no associations between any BMI groups with a benign
diagnosis and either outcome.
T
o explore the interaction between diagnosis and
obesity, a further analysis of obese patients alone was
performed (Table 6). This showed that obese patients
undergoing surgery for malignancy were subject to higher
patient- and operation-level risks than obese patients
undergoing surgery for benign conditions. This included
older age, higher ASA grades, higher RCRI scores, more
open surgery, and a greater proportion of patients under-
going high-risk surgical procedures (18⋅3 per cent benign
versus 32⋅7 per cent malignant). A comparison of patients
undergoing surgery for malignancy only revealed that
those who were obese had greater risk in terms of ASA
grade and RCRI score than normal-weight or overweight
patients (Table S2, supporting information). Obese patients
undergoing laparoscopic surgery for malignancy were
almost twice as likely to require conversion to an open
operation than normal-weight and overweight patients,
and obese patients having surgery for a benign condition.
Patient characteristics and outcomes within the obese
group according to WHO subgroups are described in

stratification predicted increasing mortality across all three
BMI categories (Table S4, supporting information).
Discussion
This large, prospective study found that overweight and
obese patients undergoing surgery for gastrointestinal
malignancy were at increased risk of major postoperative
complications compared with normal-weight patients.
Overweight and obese patients undergoing surgery for
benign conditions did not have higher risks of complica-
tions, nor was body mass associated with adverse outcomes
in this group. Obese patients were at higher risk of SSI
overall, with a weak association for overweight patients.
These findings may be explained by differences in the
characteristics of patients undergoing surgery for either
a benign or malignant diagnosis. Because of the urgency
of their treatment, patients having surgery for malignancy
are not readily selected or operations delayed based on
fitness. However, those undergoing surgery for benign
conditions are likely to be subject to a selection bias of
fitter patients for generally lower-risk procedures. Obese
patients underwent far more bariatric and gallbladder
operations, leading to a higher number of laparoscopic and
elective procedures. In malignant disease, overweight and
obese patients had more co-morbidity than normal-weight
patients, which may have contributed to their increased
risk. Less use of laparoscopy and higher rates of conversion
in obese patients with malignancy also suggests technical
difficulties. Although these risks were adjusted for in the
present models, it is possible that the variables included
did not fully adjust for the risk to which these patients
were subjected.
The main strength of this study is the accurate and com-
prehensive risk adjustment from a validated prospective
data set, which did not rely on administrative or retro-
spective data. One of the most important clinical factors
affecting mortality risk is the magnitude of the operation
performed and its timing. T
o account for this, a novel
HES-based operative risk score was developed, which can
be used by future investigators to stratify their own patient
groups.
The main limitation of this study is the presence of
selection bias between indication for surgery and obesity.
Here, morbidly obese patients with benign conditions
and co-morbidities might not have been treated with
surgery, as clinicians may have opted for an alternative
management plan or weight loss owing to the perceived
risk of higher complications. Thus surgery for benign
conditions still needs to be balanced against the risks when
co-morbidities are present. Furthermore, patients who
received a benign diagnosis may in fact have had malignant
disease. In the elective setting, this is highly unlikely, as
malignant disease is staged before operation and confirmed
histologically before surgery. The group of patients under-
going emergency surgery may have been at higher risk of a
misclassified diagnosis as they may not have received pre-
operative histopathology, but were likely to have had
cross-sectional imaging. Nevertheless, as histopathology
reports are usually available within 30 days of operation
and therefore the follow-up period, the risk of this influ-
encing the results was low. Complications occurring after
discharge that did not re-present to the same hospital may
not have been detected, but are of uncertain consequence.
The 30-day follow-up period was selected to ensure that
the study was logistically feasible compared with a longer
follow-up period which may have captured additional
complications. Despite this, 30-day follow-up remains
a sensitive measure and is known to correlate well with
90-day outcomes22. Finally, an independent validation
process proved the data to be both highly accurate and
complete.
Previous population-level studies have suggested an
‘
obesity paradox’
, whereby overweight and obese patients
have lower postoperative complication rates than those of
normal weight8. The present findings refute this, as obese
patients with malignant disease were at significantly higher
risk of major complications. There are four possible
explanations for this difference. It may reflect different
statistical risk adjustment strategies. Here, the risk of type
I errors was limited by fitting models according to prespec-
ified clinically relevant factors. The novel HES-based risk
score provides a high level of quality control for impact
of operation, which was lacking in other studies. Other
factors were adjusted for including: age, disease severity
(ASA grade), urgency of operation and smoking status.
A further reason why the present finding has not been
observed in previous studies is that there may have been
selection bias in other populations, with obese patients
being denied surgery or having surgery delayed. It is still
reasonable to suggest that there may be other physio-
logical or lifestyle differences between this UK and Irish
population compared with previously described North
American populations, which remain unaccounted for.
Different preoperative optimization practices may also
exist, especially with the depth of community care from
general practitioners in the UK. Finally, treatment differ-
ences in UK and Irish practice that were not captured in
this study may be associated with different complications,
such as the use of neoadjuvant therapies for cancer.
This large study from the UK and Ireland is globally
relevant, with its findings potentially affecting hundreds
of thousands of patients undergoing major gastrointestinal

surgery every year. Within this context, increased use of
laparoscopy may reduce complications and SSI. Therefore,
a laparoscopic-first approach should be adopted routinely
for all overweight and obese patients where possible23.
Further research is required to determine cost-effective
methods to reduce perioperative complications in over-
weight and obese patients with malignancy. In the present
study, patients undergoing surgery for malignancy were
at an increased risk of complications; therefore this is a
specifically high-risk group. New ways of preoperative
optimization of patients to reduce complications, such
as preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise, have shown
promise in pilot studies. Within the obese and overweight
patient population, improving fitness for surgery may
prove a useful way of reducing major complications24,
25. In
light of the present findings, obese and overweight patients
should be a key stakeholder group for the development of
these studies. Preoperative weight-loss programmes may
not be an ideal solution, as a poor catabolic nutritional
state is associated with worse postoperative outcomes
and heightened mortality26. During the operation, the
physiological differences found between normal and obese
patients should be considered carefully, particularly with
regard to fluid management and drug doses tailored toward
achieving sufficient tissue concentrations. Intraoperative
hypothermia has been shown to increase the risk of SSI27;
obese or overweight patients should therefore receive peri-
operative warming because of their greater surface area.
Finally, adequate fluid management in obese or overweight
patients is difficult to achieve, and studies investigating
fluid management strategies (such as goal-directed fluid
therapy) should assess the effects of BMI on outcomes28.
Intensive postoperative care, early mobilization, physio-
therapy and novel methods to reduce SSI, above and
beyond laparoscopy, should be investigated. Previous
research has associated alterations in tissue oxygen ten-
sion, the pharmacokinetic distribution of prophylactic
antibiotics and impaired immunological response in obese
patients with a heightened risk of SSI29–31. There are con-
siderable additional costs associated with SSI, adding con-
siderable length and costs to inpatient stay32. Education,
novel wound devices and antibiotic delivery methods may
be beneficial in reducing SSI in obese patients with cancer.
