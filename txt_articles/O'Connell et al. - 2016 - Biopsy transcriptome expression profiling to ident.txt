 stable renal function 3 months after transplantation. We used microarray analysis to investigate 
gene expression in 159 of these tissue samples. We aimed to identify genes that correlated with the 
Chronic Allograft Damage Index (CADI) score at 12 months, but not fibrosis at the time of the 
biopsy. We applied a penalised regression model in combination with permutation-based approach 
to derive an optimal gene set to predict allograft fibrosis. The GoCAR study is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00611702.
Findings—We identified a set of 13 genes that was independently predictive for the development 
of fibrosis at 1 year (ie, CADI-12 ≥2). The gene set had high predictive capacity (area under the 
curve [AUC] 0·967), which was superior to that of baseline clinical variables (AUC 0·706) and 
clinical and pathological variables (AUC 0·806). Furthermore routine pathological variables were 
unable to identify which histologically normal allografts would progress to fibrosis (AUC 0·754), 
whereas the predictive gene set accurately discriminated between transplants at high and low risk 
of progression (AUC 0·916). The 13 genes also accurately predicted early allograft loss (AUC 
0·842 at 2 years and 0·844 at 3 years). We validated the predictive value of this gene set in an 
independent cohort from the GoCAR study (n=45, AUC 0·866) and two independent, publically 
available expression datasets (n=282, AUC 0·831 and n=24, AUC 0·972).
Interpretation—Our results suggest that this set of 13 genes could be used to identify kidney 
transplant recipients at risk of allograft loss before the development of irreversible damage, thus 
allowing therapy to be modified to prevent progression to fibrosis.

Introduction
Kidney transplantation is the most common type of solid organ transplant surgery in the 
USA, with more than 16 900 transplants performed in 2013.1 Despite reduced incidence of 
acute rejection over the past two decades, improvements in long-term allograft survival have 
not been realised.2–3
Chronic allograft damage, or interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy of unknown cause, is 
the major cause of allograft loss in the first year after transplantation.4 Clinical and 
histological events associated with interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy are poorly 
predictive of allograft loss,5 making it difficult to identify allografts that could benefit from 
early interventions to prevent progression of fibrosis. Allograft biopsies in response to renal 
dysfunction remain the current approach for the diagnosis of chronic injury, by which stage 
irreversible fibrosis has developed. Substantial evidence suggests that pathological changes 
in the renal graft precede functional changes.6 Studies using surveillance or protocol 
biopsies—ie, biopsies performed at predefined timepoints for surveillance—have shown that 
about 50% of allografts with stable renal function show evidence of interstitial fibrosis and 
tubular atrophy by 1 year.7 The development of a predictive assay to identify allografts at 
risk of chronic damage early after transplantation (ie, within the first 3 months after 
transplantation) will be essential for the design of targeted therapeutic interventions. We 
hypothesised that the molecular changes noted in protocol biopsies early after 
transplantation would reflect the processes that lead to fibrosis and would precede any 
pathological evidence of fibrosis. By use of gene expression profiling of protocol biopsies

 obtained at 3 months after transplantation, we aimed to develop a predictive gene set that is 
able to identify allografts at risk of progressive injury, thereby enabling the identification of 
recipients at risk of allograft loss at a time when therapeutic intervention could still prevent 
the development of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy.
Methods
Study design and patients
This part of the Genomics of Chronic Allograft Rejection (GoCAR) study is a prospective, 
multicentre study done at five clinical sites and central pathological and immunological 
cores in the USA and Australia to examine the use of differential gene expression to predict 
the development of chronic allograft injury. Exclusion criteria included a positive T 
lymphocyte or B lymphocyte complement-dependent cytotoxicity cross match, 
desensitisation for donor-specific antibodies, paediatric transplant recipients (age <18 years), 
and inability to give consent. Protocol renal allograft biopsies were obtained at 0, 3, 12, and 
24 months after transplantation at all five clinical sites. Patients included in the study were 
prospectively enrolled from May 12, 2007, to July 30, 2011. The study was approved by the 
institutional review boards of the participating institutions (appendix p 2). Written informed 
consent was obtained from all enrolled patients. Protocol biopsies at 3 months after 
transplantation were collected from 204 patients. Microarray analysis was done on the first 
159 biopsies (discovery set), and the remaining 45 biopsies were used for validation.
Histopathological classification
Two biopsy cores were taken at each protocol biopsy, with one used for histology and the 
other used for mRNA analysis. Biopsies were processed and evaluated centrally blinded to 
local reports if these were available and scored separately by two of three renal pathologists 
who alternated in serving as the first and second lines of scoring (RC, RNS, and IAR) in 
accordance with the Chronic Allograft Damage Index (CADI)6 and Revised Banff 2009 
Classification,8 which are measures of allograft damage. If diagnoses were discordant 
between pathologists, a third pathologist (RC, RNS, or IAR) provided a consensus 
diagnosis. Whole slide images prepared from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections 
were scanned, analysed by the pathologists, and entered into a customised database that 
calculated the Banff categories and CADI scores6 (appendix p 3). We calculated CADI 
scores for biopsies obtained at 3 months (CADI-3) and 12 months (CADI-12) after 
transplantation. High CADI-12 scores, which indicate chronic allograft damage, were 
defined as scores of 2 or more, which we based on the previous association of such scores 
with adverse allograft outcomes.5,6,9
Microarray, data analysis, and cross-validation
Details of the microarray analysis are described in the appendix (pp 3–9). Briefly, we 
extracted total RNA from fresh frozen biopsies and did the microarray analysis with the 
Affymetrix human exon 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). We identified 
correlations between gene expression in 3-month biopsies and CADI-3 or CADI-12 scores

 by use of Spearman’s correlation analysis and the genes associated with CADI-3 or 
CADI-12 were subsequently subjected to enrichment analysis based on Gene Ontology 
Biological Process (BP) term and immune cell type.
To identify a minimum gene set to predict future kidney fibrosis, as represented by a high 
CADI-12 score, we identified genes that were specifically correlated with CADI-12 scores, 
then did a 100 time random shuffling analysis with adjustment for confounding clinical 
parameters. We identified the gene set with the best area under the curve (AUC) for the 
prediction of high and low CADI-12 scores. We then applied this optimum gene set to 
predict which patients have CADI-3 of 3 or less and increase of CADI-12 scores by at least 
2 points (CADI progression) and early allograft loss (within 2 years or 3 years). We also 
investigated the prediction of CADI-12 with a threshold of 3 or 4, the contribution of 
inflammation to prediction of high CADI-12 by the gene set, and lastly, we assessed the 
prediction of the kidney function by calculating the AUC for estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR) at 12 and 24 months with the gene set.
We independently validated the gene set with quantitative PCR (qPCR) data for the 
remaining biopsies from the GoCAR study (n=45) for prediction of kidney fibrosis at 12 
months and in two external datasets. These datasets consisted of 282 samples from a study 
by Einecke and colleagues investigating graft loss prediction (GSE21374)10 and 24 samples 
from a study by Naesens and colleagues investigating progression prediction based on CADI 
at 24 months (GSE25902).11 Microarray data are available from the Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GSE57387).
Clinical data and statistical analysis
In accordance with the protocol, we collected clinical and laboratory data about the kidney 
transplant donors and recipients (appendix p 2) at 0, 3, 12, and 24 months post-
transplantation, and we summarised these data with descriptive statistics. We used GraphPad 
Prism 5.03 to plot survival curves for the duration of the study, with allograft loss as the 
outcome. Graft losses were entered by the study sites into the electronic research database 
(eRAP). To establish predictive clinical factors for high CADI-12 scores (≥2) and CADI 
progression or non-progression outcomes, we used multiple logistic regression models that 
included donor age, recipient race and sex, donor vital status, expanded-criteria donor 
(ECD) status, cold ischaemia time (h), induction therapy, presence of human leucocyte 
antigen (HLA) antibodies, eGFR at 3 months post-transplantation, acute cellular rejection at 
or before 3 months, delayed graft function, HLA mismatch, and CADI-3 score. We used 
SAS version 9.2 to build logistic models with these predictors to assess factors predictive for 
the development of high CADI-12 scores. The GoCAR study is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00611702.

 Results
We included 204 patients from the GoCAR cohort who had a protocol allograft biopsy at 3 
months post-transplantation in the current study (figure 1). Microarray analysis was done on 
the first 159 samples collected (discovery set), whereas qPCR experiments were done on the 
remaining 45 biopsies as a validation set. All 45 patients included in the validation set and 
101 patients from the discovery set had a corresponding protocol biopsy at 12 months. 
Reasons for the absence of a 12 month biopsy included allograft loss (n=8), death (n=1), 
loss to follow-up (n=9), and contraindication or inability to obtain biopsy (n=40). 
Demographics and clinical variables of the 159 patients included in the microarray analysis 
were similar to those of the 101 patients with biopsies at 12 months (table 1) and the 45 
patients in the validation set (appendix p 30). 57 (57%) biopsies collected at 12 months had 
a CADI-12 score of 0–1, 30 (30%) had a score of 2–4, and 14 (14%) had scores more than 4. 
CADI-12 scores of 2 or more were associated with reduced 3-year allograft survival 
compared with scores less than 2 (log rank p=0·0187; appendix p 16).
The transcriptome obtained from the discovery set was analysed to obtain an optimal gene 
set predictive of CADI-12 score. Initially, we applied Spearman correlation analysis to 
identify significantly associated genes, pathways, and corresponding functions associated 
with high CADI-3 and CADI-12 scores. We noted that the transcripts specifically associated 
with CADI-3 were related to alloimmunity, including T-cell activation, whereas genes 
involved in programmed cell death or apoptosis and cell adhesion were only associated with 
CADI-12. Furthermore, immune cell gene enrichment analysis revealed that dendritic cell 
genes are specifically associated with CADI-3, however stromal cell (mostly fibroblast cell) 
genes are the most over-represented genes significantly associated with CADI-12 according 
to Fisher’s exact test, in addition to genes from macrophage, dendritic, and CD4-positive T 
cells (appendix pp 11, 17–23). To identify an optimal predictive gene set, we filtered genes 
significantly associated with CADI-3 or CADI-12 scores via a two-group re-sampling 
approach to derive a smaller set of 149 genes that correlated specifically with CADI-12 
scores, but not CADI-3 scores (appendix p 5). After excluding genes with low expression 
(log2 of the intensity <5) and adjustment for clinical parameters, we further reduced the 
gene set to 84 genes (appendix pp 31–33). Through iterative application of penalised logistic 
regression fitting on expression data for these 84 genes (appendix p 6), we identified an 
optimal set of 13 genes from 3-month biopsies that was able to differentiate high CADI-12 
scores from low CADI-12 scores with an AUC of 0·967 (table 2, appendix p 24). To avoid 
overfitting of the prediction model on the training set from which the gene set was derived, 
the 101 patient cohort was randomly divided into thirds and assigned into training and test 
sets (threefold cross-validation), and the performance of the selected gene set in these 
random subsets was evaluated. This process was repeated 100 times and these test sets were 
calculated to have an average sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 79%, with an average 
cross-validated AUC of 0·889 (95% CI 0·886–0·897; appendix pp 6–7, 24). To assess 
whether the gene set that we identified was an optimal gene set for the prediction of high or 
low CADI-12 scores, we compared the original prediction AUC with prediction AUCs from 
the gene sets that were identified from high and low CADI-12 score groups, with random 
reassignment of CADI scores to the patients; the original AUC was higher than any AUC

 from 2000 permutations (p=0·0015; appendix pp 7, 24). Finally, we did a complete leave-
one-out cross-validation to validate our approach, which involved gene reselection and 
model building based on the original training set with one patient being left out and 
validation on the left-out patient. Most of the new gene sets identified from this cross-
validation overlapped with the original set of 13 genes, and the prediction AUC of the 
probabilities of all possible testing sets was 0·774, confirming that the originally selected 
gene set was the optimal set for the prediction of CADI-12 scores (appendix pp 7, 24).
The gene set also performed well when higher cutoffs to define a high CADI-12 score were 
used, with an AUC of 0·934 for a CADI-12 cutoff of 3 points or more and an AUC of 0·928 
for a CADI-12 cutoff of 4 points or more (appendix p 25), which supported the robustness of 
our gene set. When validated with the qPCR data from the independent GoCAR cohort 
(n=45), which had similar demographics to the training set (appendix p 30), the gene set 
accurately differentiated between patients with high and low CADI-12 scores (18 patients 
classified as having high CADI-12, 27 patients classified as having low CADI-12, AUC 
0·866; figure 2B).
To examine the contribution of allograft inflammation (represented by the i score in CADI) 
in both the identification of the gene set and the prediction of high CADI-12 scores, we 
tested the gene set against the sum of Banff chronic interstitial fibrosis (Ci) and chronic 
tubular atrophy (Ct) scores obtained at 12 months. The gene set accurately predicted fibrosis 
based on Banff score, with an AUC of 0·922 for the sum of 12-month Ci and Ct scores 
(appendix p 26) and an AUC of 0·923 for interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy by 
diagnosis (interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy >1; appendix p 26). Subclinical rejection 
was present in 20 patients in the discovery set and was associated with high CADI-12 scores 
(p=0·0003) and high Banff scores (Ci plus Ct; p=0·002) at 12 months. However, exclusion of 
these patients with rejection or Banff interstitial inflammation (i) plus tubulitis (t) scores of 
more than two did not alter the ability of the gene set to predict high CADI-12 scores (AUC 
0·975; appendix p 26). These data suggest that inflammation was not the predominant driver 
for the derivation of the gene set.
We also investigated whether the 13-gene set was predictive of kidney function at 12 or 24 
months. We measured the creatinine concentrations of transplant recipients at each biopsy 
timepoint and we calculated eGFR based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease 
(MDRD) Study equation.12 As expected, eGFR was negatively correlated with CADI-12 
(Pearson’s r correlation of –0·38, p=0·0001; appendix p 27). We analysed whether the set of 
13 genes could predict high and low eGFR at 12 and 24 months in all 159 patients in the 
discovery cohort. Our gene set predicted the occurrence of low or high eGFR at 12 months 
with an AUC of 0·872 (appendix p 27), and predicted high or low eGFR at 24 months with 
an AUC of 0·928 at an eGFR cutoff of 30 mL per min (appendix p 27).
To study the clinical variables associated with high CADI-12 scores, we did multivariate 
analyses in the discovery set including clinical and pathological characteristics. The ability 
of our set of 13 genes to predict CADI-12 scores was superior to that of baseline clinical 
variables alone (donor age, recipient race and sex, donor vital status, ECD status, cold 
ischaemia time, induction therapy, presence of anti-HLA antibodies, delayed graft function,

 and HLA mismatch; AUC 0·706; figure 2A). Furthermore, when baseline and clinical 
variables (the variables listed for the previous analysis and eGFR at 3 months) were 
combined with pathological variables at 3 months (acute cellular rejection at or before 3 
months and CADI-3 score), the gene set was still superior (AUC 0·806 for clinical and 
pathological variables vs AUC 0·967 for the gene set; figure 2A). In multivariate analysis 
with a logistic regression model incorporating clinical and pathological variables alone or 
combined with the gene set, the gene set remained significantly associated with high 
CADI-12 scores whereas the clinical parameters did not (appendix p 34).
Predicting the pathological course of allografts that have little or no fibrosis is clinically very 
difficult. We investigated whether the gene set could be used to categorise patients in the 
discovery set with minimal or no fibrosis into those who would or would not develop 
progressive fibrosis by 12 months. From the original 101 patients with protocol biopsies at 
12 months, we identified 66 patients with CADI-3 scores of 3 or less, which indicated 
minimal or no fibrosis. We separated these patients into those with a change from CADI-3 to 
CADI-12 of less than 2 points (non-progression; n=52) versus those who had an increase of 
2 points or more (progression; n=14). Most patients with progression at 12 months had 
further progression at 24 months, and most patients who had not had progression at 12 
months did not have progression by 24 months (table 1; appendix p 28). Comparisons of 
biopsy pathology CADI subscores at 2 months and 12 months are shown in the appendix (p 
35) for patients who had progression versus those without progression. Compared with 
patients without progression, those who had progression had no significant differences in 
CADI-3 subscores. CADI-3 scores did not predict which patients would have progression or 
not by 12 months. Clinical and pathological parameters were poor predictors of progression 
by 12 months or 24 months (baseline clinical variables: AUC at 12 months 0·641; AUC at 24 
months 0·584; clinical plus pathological variables: AUC at 12 months 0·754; AUC at 24 
months 0·613; figure 2C). The gene set accurately predicted which patients would have 
progression in CADI scores and those who would not at both 12 months (AUC 0·916) and 
24 months (AUC 0·845; figure 2C). Multivariate analysis showed that the gene set was 
significantly associated with progression at 12 months, whereas most demographic, clinical, 
and pathological parameters were not, except for eGFR at 3 months (appendix p 36). The 
gene set, but not demographic, clinical, and pathological variables, was associated with 
progression at 24 months (appendix p 37). Furthermore, the gene set was also able to predict 
CADI progression by 12 months and 24 months when the cutoff for CADI-3 was lowered to 
2 points or less (AUC at 12 months 1·00 and AUC at 24 months 0·834; appendix p 28). 
These findings are of clinical relevance because patients with progression in CADI scores 
had reduced allograft survival compared with those without progression at 36 months 
(p=0·0369; appendix p 29).
15 patients who had improvements in CADI scores between 3 and 12 months were excluded 
from our initial progression versus non-progression analysis. We retrospectively applied the 
progression versus non-progression model to this set of patients, and 13 of these 15 patients 
with apparent improvements were accurately predicted to not have progression. Conversely, 
two of these patients were predicted by our gene set to have progression, despite the 
improvements in CADI-12 score. On review, these two patients had high CADI scores at 3 
months and 12 months (one patient had a CADI-3 score of 7 and a CADI-12 score of 4 and

 the other had a CADI-3 score of 7 and a CADI-12 score of 3), suggesting that these two 
patients, irrespective of the changes in their CADI scores, behaved biologically as 
progressors, as predicted by the gene set.
We next generated Cox models with our gene set and clinical variables to predict death-
censored graft loss in the total discovery set of 159 patients (11 cases of allograft loss). We 
did principle component analysis (PCA) on the expression data of the 13 genes in the set, 
and two principle components (P4, P6) were significantly associated with allograft loss 
(p=0·0032 for P4 and p=0·0120 for P6; overall p=0·0287; appendix p 38). We used these two 
principle components to derive the gene set risk score (appendix p 8), and patients were 
stratified into two groups based on this gene set risk score: high risk and low risk. We found 
that a higher score was associated with significantly greater risk of allograft loss (hazard 
ratio for graft loss 2·725, 95% CI 1·528–4·862; log-rank p=0·0194; figure 3A). With 
prediction based on the gene set risk score, the AUCs for time-dependent allograft loss were 
0·844 by 2 years and 0·842 by 3 years post-biopsy (figure 3B). Demographic and clinical 
variables were not significantly associated with allograft loss (overall p=0·4010; appendix p 
39).
To confirm the usefulness of the 13-gene set in other populations of patients, we interrogated 
two independent, publically available datasets in which the endpoints were graft loss in 
Einecke and colleagues’ study10 (GSE21374; 282 samples) and CADI score at 24 months in 
Naesens and colleagues’ study11 (GSE25902; 24 samples; appendix p 40). Our gene set 
accurately predicted the respective endpoints for each of the datasets (figure 2D), performing 
favourably when compared with the original studies (0·831 vs 0.83 [using a 30-gene set by 
Einecke and colleagues10]; 0·974 vs 0·82 to 0·926 [using various immune response genesets 
by Naesens and colleagues11], respectively. Furthermore, our gene set is substantially 
smaller and able to predict the fibrosis at an early time post-transplant. Survival analysis of 
Einecke and colleagues’ cohort10 stratified with our gene set into high-risk and low-risk 
groups showed significant differences between these risk groups with respect to graft 
survival (hazard ratio of graft loss 2·717, 95% CI 2·074–3·561 p=2·1 × 10−9; figure 3C); In 
this dataset, the AUCs were 0·865 for allograft loss within 1 year and 0·807 for graft loss 
within 2 years after biopsy (figure 3D).
Discussion
We have identified a set of 13 genes from biopsies of stably functioning renal allografts that 
predicts the development and progression of chronic allograft damage and subsequent 
allograft loss. Our results show that this molecular gene risk profile has superior predictive 
ability to the clinicopathological variables currently used in practice for the prediction of 
these outcomes.
Many renal allografts show early and rapid histological deterioration by 12 months after 
transplantation.4 Fibrosis at 12 months has been correlated with adverse long-term allograft 
outcomes in all but the highest risk recipients.13–15 The pathological findings from our study 
lend further support to evidence showing that an ongoing cycle of subclinical inflammation 
and injury leads to fibrosis, loss of function, and organ failure.16 Data from our discovery

 cohort and previous studies have shown that CADI-12 scores of 2 or more are associated 
with increased risk of allograft loss.6,17 Interventions started after chronic damage has 
already become established are unlikely to alter outcomes.4 The clinicopathological 
variables currently used to identify allografts at risk of histological deterioration perform 
poorly. For example, although 60% of our cohort had low CADI-3 scores (0–1), more than 
half of the patients with progression in CADI scores at 12 months belonged to this group, 
and were not identified as being at risk of deterioration by histology alone at 3 months. The 
identification of early markers to detect the initiation of pro-fibrotic pathways of 
inflammation and injury at the molecular level within the graft would offer the potential to 
interrupt the process.
As has been shown previously, the causes of chronic kidney allograft injury are diverse and 
cumulative.4,18 This diversity is reflected in the large number of genes that were associated 
with adverse allograft outcomes in the two publically available validation cohorts. Einecke 
and colleagues10 identified a tissue gene signature (886 genes related to tissue injury and the 
effects of TGF-β) that was predictive of allograft loss in clinically indicated allograft 
biopsies obtained between 1 and 31 years after transplantation. A 601-probe set signature 
identified from protocol biopsies collected at 6 months from low-risk paediatric patients 
receiving kidney transplants showed upregulation of genes for immune response in patients 
who had histological progression compared with those who did not.11 Our set of 13 genes 
was validated in these cohorts, showing high predictive value in the prediction of allograft 
outcomes, despite differences in demographics, timing of biopsies after transplantation, 
presence of pre-existing fibrosis, and endpoints (appendix p 40). Additionally, the previous 
study11 used limited gene sets based on previous data or predicted pathological pathways. 
By contrast, we took an all-inclusive, non-hypothesis-driven approach that was enabled by 
our sample size and based on the multifaceted nature of chronic injury. Since the CADI-12 
score is a continuous variable, we derived the list of genes on the basis of indications of 
correlation, identifying genes with higher expression at 3 months that were correlated with 
higher CADI-12 scores, rather than comparing differential gene expression between two 
well-defined clinical cohorts, as in previous studies. This approach avoids the use of cutoffs 
predetermined for experimental purposes and hence more accurately represents the 
continuous nature of pathological processes seen in clinical settings, enhancing the 
usefulness of the gene set in clinical cohorts.
Despite the focus of our approach on prediction, we identified functional implications of the 
differentially expressed transcripts, including pathogenic and protective mechanisms that 
merit further investigation. Genes involved in cell growth and tumour development or 
suppression were significantly over-represented, including MET (MET proto-oncogene), 
ST5 (suppression of tumorigenicity 5) and KAAG1. Also over-represented were genes that 
are involved in ubiquitination either as E3 ligases or as interacting proteins, including 
RNF149 (ring finger protein 149), ASB15 (ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 15), 
KLH13 (Kelch-like family member 13); genes involved in significant developmental or 
growth pathways such as in the NOTCH/Wnt pathway and the RAR pathway through 
SMAD, including the genes TGIF1 (TGFB-induced factor homeobox 1), SPRY4 (sprouty 
homolog 4), WNT9A (Wnt family member 9A), RXRA (retinoid X receptor alpha), and 
FJX1 (four jointed box 1); and genes involved in energy and membrane repair, such as the

 mitochondrial gene CHCHD10 (coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 10) 
and SERINC5 (serine incorporator 5), which phosphorylates membrane proteins. The 
representation of genes involved in embryonic growth and malignancy, gene regulation 
through ubiquitination, developmental signalling pathways, and genes that regulate 
membrane formation and mitochondrial function suggests representation of active repair and 
regeneration pathways, as might be expected for markers of injury and fibrosis. For example, 
c-MET and TGIF proteins have been reported to mediate the anti-fibrotic effects of 
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF),19 whereas SPRY4 and ST5 proteins have been found to 
exert a range of regulatory effects on ERK/MAPK activation.20–22 The SPRY4 gene encodes 
a member of a family of cysteine-rich and proline-rich proteins, and might have a similar 
function in organ fibrosis to that of SPRY1.23 SPRY4 protein is an inhibitor of the receptor-
transduced MAPK signalling pathway. Inhibition of the p38 MAPK24 and MAPK/ERK25 
signalling pathways and treatment with recombinant HGF26 have shown benefit in 
experimental chronic allograft damage, showing that these pathways could be potential early 
therapeutic targets. By comparing gene expression data from stromal cells (mostly fibroblast 
cells) with that from other immune cell types (eg, macrophages, dendritic cells, monocytes, 
T cells, and B cells), we found that most of the 13 genes in our panel, including KLHL13, 
MET, SPRY4, SERINC5, FJX1, ST5, and RXRA are highly expressed in fibroblast cells 
(appendix p 22), suggesting that dysregulation of fibrotic genes at 3 months after 
transplantation are associated with the development of kidney fibrosis.
Contrary to the widely held belief that scar tissue is permanent, growing evidence suggests 
that it is in fact an actively remodelled tissue that, under certain circumstances, can 
regress.16 The development of a predictive indicator to identify those at risk early after 
transplantation allows for the possibility to slow, arrest, or even reverse the progression of 
tissue fibrogenesis. Furthermore, the identification of a gene set that is predictive of 
progressive fibrosis and declining renal function has the potential to guide 
immunosuppression therapy and stratify allografts for risk. At the very least, early 
identification of patients with progressive fibrosis would allow a review of their 
immunosuppression therapy and concomitant medications such as angiotensin-converting-
enzyme inhibitors. Maximising use of anti-proliferative drugs such as mycophenolate 
mofetil where additional immunosuppresion is needed or switching to an mTOR inhibitor or 
belatacept where avoidance of calcineurin inhibitors is safe and appropriate are two possible 
options. Stratification of risk with the gene signature could also be used as an enrichment 
strategy to identify patients for inclusion in an inter ventional clinical trial.
Despite our validation of the predictive gene set, there are limitations to the study. The 
cohort size was limited by the stringent requirements for inclusion. Additionally, roughly 
20% of participants who underwent a biopsy at 3 months did not have a biopsy at 12 
months. Although this loss of patients might have biased the development of the gene set 
and the study outcomes, we showed that the demographics of the original cohort of 159 
patients did not differ from those of the 101 patients who had a 12-month biopsy. The 
patients in the study all received calcineurin inhibitors and anti-proliferative agents such as 
mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine. The validity of this gene set has not been established 
in the context of other immunosuppressive regimens. Finally, although our gene set obtained 
at 3 months is highly predictive of adverse allograft outcomes, histological progression from

 delayed causes of allograft injury such as late-onset antibody-mediated rejection and 
recurrent glomerulonephritis might not be captured by our gene set.
We used a novel, non-biased approach to identify a gene signature that is able to differentiate 
allografts at risk of early histological progression, and has further applications in the 
identification of kidneys at risk of long-term allograft injury and allograft failure. Although 
further studies are needed, the ability to identify patients at risk of allograft loss has 
important clinical and therapeutic applications in an area where progress has so far been 
limited.

 Research in context
Evidence before this study
We have previously systematically followed up and reviewed the scientific literature 
related to the use and application of transcriptional genomic information to chronic 
kidney allograft injury. This literature has substantially expanded within the duration of 
our GoCAR study (2007–13) and the preparation of this manuscript. No large prospective 
transcriptional allograft biopsy datasets such as we report here have been published 
between 2013 and the writing of this manuscript. So far, the application of gene 
expression analysis to allograft transcriptional data to predict subsequent adverse 
outcomes has had limited generalisability. Previous studies have involved either 
retrospective cohorts of clinically indicated biopsies obtained at widely varying 
timepoints, or very early protocol biopsies (ie, at 6 weeks) where gene expression profiles 
might have been confounded by early ischaemia and reperfusion injury signals or small 
sample sizes of highly selected cohorts such as paediatric patients receiving kidney 
allografts.
Added value of this study
In this study, we prospectively enrolled adult kidney transplant recipients from five 
clinical centres and collected protocol biopsies at 3 months to minimise early injury 
signals after transplantation. We then took a non-hypothesis-driven, inclusive approach to 
identify a gene signature that was significantly correlated with the development of 
subsequent histological and functional decline. We identified a set of 13 genes in protocol 
allograft biopsies collected at 3 months after transplantation, which was independently 
predictive of the development of histological injury at 1 year. The predictive capacity of 
the gene set was superior to that of clinical indicators or routine histological parameters. 
Furthermore, the gene set accurately identified allografts that would have histological 
progression by 1 year or 2 years, as well as early allograft loss. We validated these data in 
an independent GoCAR cohort and two independent, publically available expression 
datasets.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our results suggest that those kidney transplant recipients who are at risk of allograft loss 
can be identified before the development of irreversible damage, thus offering the 
potential to modify therapeutic approaches before the onset of fibrosis. Future clinical 
trials in renal graft recipients could use our data to stratify patients by risk before 
enrolment to target specific interventional strategies to high-risk or low-risk groups, 
thereby improving efficiency by reducing sample sizes and costs.

Data are mean (%) or mean (SD) unless noted otherwise. p values are calculated with the Mann-Whitney test (for non-parametric comparisons) or unpaired t test for continuous variables and χ2 or Fisher’s 
exact test for categorical data. CADI-12 scores of 2 or more were deemed to be high and scores of less than 2 were deemed to be low. Progression was shown by a CADI-3 score of 3 or less and an increase 
of CADI score of at least 2 points. Delayed graft function was defined as need for dialysis within the first 7 days after transplantation. CADI-12=chronic allograft damage index at 12 months. 
eGFR=estimated glomerular filtration rate. HLA=human leucocyte antigen.
*Deceased donors only.
†Only 148 of 159 patients included in microarray analysis and 97 of 101 patients with biopsies at 12 months had baseline anti-HLA antibodies reported in the database: 42 patients with high CADI and 55 
with low CADI had anti HLA antibodies reported; all 14 progressors and 52 non-progressors had anti-HLA antibodies reported.
