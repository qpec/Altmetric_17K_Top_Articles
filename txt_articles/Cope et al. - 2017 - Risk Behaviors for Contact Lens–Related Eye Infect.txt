Contact Lens Health Week — 
August 21–25, 2017
August 21–25, 2017, marks the fourth annual Contact 
Lens Health Week. In collaboration with partners from the 
clinical, public health, industry, and regulatory sectors, CDC 
is promoting healthy wear and care practices to reduce the risk 
for eye infections among the approximately 45 million persons 
in the United States who wear contact lenses. Research after 
outbreaks of rare but serious eye infections in the United States 
has indicated that these infections occur most often in contact 
lens wearers who do not take proper care of their contact lenses, 
indicating a need to promote safer wear and care (1,2).
A report in this issue of MMWR describes CDC’s first-
ever population-based estimates of contact lens–related risk 
behaviors in persons aged 12–17 years (referred to here as 
adolescents) in the United States. Approximately six in seven 
adolescents reported at least one behavior (e.g., sleeping in 
lenses, swimming, or not replacing lenses and storage cases 
as recommended) putting them at risk for a serious contact 
lens–related eye infection. Encouraging adolescents to adopt 
healthy contact lens wear and care habits might help them 
maintain healthy habits into adulthood.
Although most contact lens wearers receive the benefits of 
vision correction, contact lenses can pose an infection risk, 
especially if they are not worn and cared for properly. Practicing 
proper contact lens hygiene and regularly visiting an eye care 
provider are important behaviors for keeping contact lens 
wearers’ eyes healthy. Additional information on Contact Lens 
Health Week and the proper wear and care of contact lenses is 
available at https://www.cdc.gov/contactlenses.

Contact lens–related eye infections, which can lead to serious 
outcomes, including blindness, are associated with several risk 
factors, including sleeping in lenses, exposing lenses to water, 
not adhering to replacement schedules, and reusing disinfect-
ing solution (1). In some studies, adolescent and young adult 
contact lens wearers have been reported to be more likely than 
older adult contact lens wearers to develop eye infections (2,3) 
and more likely to have poor contact lens hygiene practices (2).

In 2015, CDC reported the number and demographics of 
adult contact lens wearers in the United States to define the 
population at risk for contact lens–related eye infections (4); 
however, this estimate did not include adolescents. To better 
understand this group of younger contact lens wearers and 
guide prevention efforts, a population-based survey was used 
to assess contact lens wear, care behaviors, risk factors, and 
demographics among persons aged 12–17 years (referred to as 
adolescents in this report), young adults aged 18–24 years, and 
older adults aged ≥25 years in the United States. In 2016, an 
estimated 3.6 million adolescents (14.5%) wore contact lenses. 
Of the adolescents who wore contact lenses, 85% reported at 
least one behavior that put them at risk for a contact lens–
related eye infection, compared with 81% of young adults, and 
88% of older adults. These findings can inform the creation of 
age-specific targeted prevention messages aimed at contact lens 
wearers and establish a baseline for evaluating trends in contact 
lens wear, care habits, and contact lens–related risk behaviors.
To describe contact lens wear and care behaviors, risk fac-
tors, and demographics for adolescents and adults in the 
United States, the Porter Novelli 2016 summer HealthStyles 
and YouthStyles survey, an online survey of 4,548 U.S. adults 
(aged ≥18 years) and 1,618 U.S. adolescents (aged 12–17 years) 
was used. Adolescent participants lived in the households of 
the adult participants.* The 2016 Porter Novelli Styles survey

participants were part of the GfK KnowledgePanel, a nationally 
representative online panel with members recruited through 
probability-based sampling by postal address. Computer and 
Internet access were provided to complete the survey where 
needed. For completing this survey and others, households 
received rewards points, which they could redeem for prizes 
generally worth less than $500. The sample was weighted 
on nine factors (sex, age, household income, race/ethnicity, 
household size, education, census region, metropolitan status, 
and prior Internet access) to match the Current Population 
Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Participants 
were asked to provide demographic and contact lens wearing 
information. If they wore contact lenses, they were asked about 
contact lens hygiene behaviors and risk factors associated with 
contact lens–related eye infections. The question regarding 
contact lens hygiene behaviors was “When you wear contact 
lenses, which of these actions do you do on a regular basis 
(sometimes, most of the time, or always)?”
In 2016, an estimated 3.6 million adolescents aged 
12–17 years (14.5% of adolescents), 7.5 million young adults 
aged 18–24 years (24.4% of young adults), and 33.9 million 
older adults aged ≥25 years (15.5% of adults) in the United 
States wore contact lenses. Among lens wearers, 90.4% of 
adults and 87.8% of adolescents reported wearing soft contact 
lenses (lenses made of soft, flexible plastics that allow oxygen 
to pass through to the cornea). No significant demographic 
differences between adolescent contact lens wearers and adoles-
cent nonwearers were observed (Table 1). By race, older adult

lens wearers were more likely to be white than were adolescent 
lens wearers. No significant geographic region or metropolitan 
residency differences were observed for either adolescents or 
adults, regardless of lens-wearing status.
At least one contact lens hygiene risk behavior was reported 
by older adult (87.5%), young adult (80.9%), and adolescent 
(85.3%) lens wearers (Table 2). The most frequently reported 
risk behaviors in adolescents were not visiting an eye doctor as 
least annually, sleeping or napping in lenses, and swimming 
in lenses (Table 2). Among young adults and older adults, the 
most frequently reported risk behaviors were replacing lenses 
at intervals longer than those prescribed, replacing lens stor-
age cases at intervals longer than those recommended, swim-
ming in lenses, and sleeping or napping in lenses. Adolescents 
were significantly less likely to report replacing lenses at 
intervals longer than prescribed and replacing lens storage 
cases at intervals longer than recommended. Although both 
adults and adolescents most commonly reported purchasing 
contact lenses through their eye care provider, both young 
adults and older adults were more likely than adolescents 
to purchase lenses on the Internet. A higher percentage of 
young adults (14.6%, 1.1 million) and older adults (11.4%, 
3.9 million) than adolescents (4.2%, 152,000) reported ever 
experiencing a red or painful eye that required an eye care 
provider visit.
Discussion
An estimated one in seven adolescents and one in six adults in 
the United States wore contact lenses in 2016, and approximately 
six of seven lens wearers reported at least one behavior putting 
them at risk for a serious contact lens–related eye infection. Lens 
wearers most commonly reported sleeping or napping in lenses, 
swimming in lenses, and replacing both lenses and lens storage 
cases at intervals longer than those recommended.
A previous study suggested that adolescents and young 
adults have lower compliance with contact lens hygiene recom-
mendations and have a greater risk for corneal inflammatory 
events, a category of eye problems that includes serious eye 
infections (3). Young adults in this survey were significantly 
more likely to replace lenses and cases at intervals longer than 
those recommended than were adolescents. These findings 
might reflect the fact that most adolescents are still living with 
their parents who might help to reinforce good contact lens 
hygiene practices whereas young adults might have recently 
left home and are no longer subject to parental reminders (2). 
Young adults also might have fewer resources (e.g., money 
and transportation) to regularly visit eye care providers and 
obtain hygiene education or regularly replace contact lenses, 
lens storage cases, and solution (3). Young adults have been 
reported to have poor planning and a more impulsive lifestyle 
in relation to contact lens hygiene, possibly related to crowded

living conditions (e.g., dormitories, living with roommates, 
and sharing bathrooms), alcohol consumption, and attitudes 
conducive to taking greater risks (2). A higher percentage of 
young adults also reported ever having a red or painful eye 
while wearing contact lenses, suggesting that poor hygiene 
practices might lead to complications.
Engaging in risky contact lens behaviors can lead to poten-
tially serious eye infections (1). Substantial percentages of 
adults and adolescents reported noncompliance with recom-
mended contact lens storage case and lens replacement sched-
ules. Infrequent contact lens storage case replacement has been 
associated with microbial keratitis (5), and lens wearers who 
do not replace their lenses as often as recommended report 
more complications and eye discomfort (6). Not replacing 
contact lenses and contact lens storage cases as often as recom-
mended increases the risk for contact lens–related eye infections 
because recurrent handling of the contact lenses and storage 
cases presents the opportunity to introduce microorganisms; 
in addition, the moist surfaces of the lens and storage case 
provide an environment favorable to microbial growth (7).
Exposing contact lenses to water through swimming or show-
ering increases the risk for infection because microorganisms 
living in water can be transferred to the eye. Even household 
tap water, although safe for drinking, contains microorganisms 
that can contaminate lens cases and contact lenses and cause 
eye infections, especially when not replaced at recommended 
intervals (8). Sleeping in contact lenses was another commonly 
reported risk behavior. Although some soft and rigid contact 
lenses have Food and Drug Administration approval for over-
night wear, sleeping in any type of contact lens increases the 
risk for eye infections (9).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, respondents were part of a larger survey that was 
not specifically focused on contact lens behaviors. Therefore, 
participants might not have been representative of contact lens 
wearers in the United States. Second, adolescents were sampled 
through convenience sampling, specifically those living in the 
household of an adult taking the larger survey. This sampling 
method led to a small sample size of adolescent respondents. 
In addition, the number of young adults in the sample was 
small. Third, the sampling method differed from a sample in 
a previous report (4) that also asked risk behavior questions 
in a different manner (i.e., “ever” versus “regular” behaviors) 
and produced differences in the percentage of respondents 
reporting outcomes and behaviors. Fourth, because data were 
self-reported, respondents might have been reluctant to report 
risk behaviors because of social desirability bias. Finally, for 
the contact lens hygiene and outcomes questions, no period 
was stipulated; this might affect the comparison among age 
groups because the duration of contact lens use might differ 
and individual practices can change over time.
Although adolescent contact lens wearers reported engag-
ing in some healthier contact lens hygiene behaviors than 
their adult counterparts, there is still room for improvement 
to prevent potentially serious outcomes, including blindness. 
Prevention efforts should focus on encouraging contact lens

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
In 2015, CDC established that there were approximately 
41 million contact lens wearers aged ≥18 years in the 
United States, the majority of whom engaged in behaviors  
that put them at risk for serious eye infections. 
What is added by this report?
In 2016, there were an estimated 3.6 million adolescents aged 
12–17 years in the United States who wore contact lenses. Of 
the adolescents who wore contact lenses, 85% reported at least 
one behavior that put them at risk for a contact lens–related eye 
infection, compared with 81% of young adults, and 88% of 
older adults.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Although adolescent contact lens wearers engage in some 
healthier contact lens hygiene behaviors than do their adult 
counterparts, there is room for improvement in order to prevent 
potentially serious outcomes including blindness. Prevention 
efforts should focus on encouraging contact lens wearers to 
replace their contact lens storage case regularly and to avoid 
sleeping or napping in contact lenses.  
wearers to replace their contact lens storage case regularly and 
to avoid sleeping or napping in contact lenses. There are insuf-
ficient data regarding the appropriate frequency of lens case and 
contact lens replacement, but contact lens wearers who do not 
follow recommended lens replacement schedules have more 
complications and self-reported discomfort than contact lens 
wearers who follow the replacement recommendations (6).†
 Existing health communication strategies known to influ-
ence behavior change in adolescents (e.g., appeals to vanity 
and social norms marketing) can be applied to communica-
tion efforts focusing on contact lens hygiene behaviors in this 
population (10). Additionally, encouraging adolescents to 
adopt healthy contact lens wear and care habits early might 
help them maintain these habits into young adulthood, when 
the frequency of reported risk behaviors increases. Prevention 
messages targeting young adults can be shaped around the 
lifestyle changes known to occur in this population.
