IMPORTANCE Overlapping surgery, also known as double-booking, refers to a controversial
practice in which a single attending surgeon supervises 2 or more operations, in different
operating rooms, at the same time.
OBJECTIVE To determine if overlapping surgery is associated with greater risk for
complications following surgical treatment for hip fracture and arthritis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a retrospective population-based cohort study
in Ontario, Canada (population, 13.6 million), for the years 2009 to 2014. There was 1 year of
follow-up. This study encompassed 2 large cohorts. The “hip fracture”cohort captured all
persons older than 60 years who underwent surgery for a hip fracture during the study
period. The “total hip arthroplasty”(THA) cohort captured all primary elective THA recipients
for arthritis during the study period. We matched overlapping and nonoverlapping hip
fractures by patient age, patient sex, surgical procedure (for the hip fracture cohort), primary
surgeon, and hospital.
EXPOSURES Procedures were identified as overlapping if they overlapped with another
surgical procedure performed by the same primary attending surgeon by more than 30
minutes.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Complication (infection, revision, dislocation) within 1 year.
RESULTS There were 38 008 hip fractures, and of those, 960 (2.5%) were overlapping
(mean age of patients, 66 years [interquartile range, 57-74 years]; 503 [52.4%] were female).
There were 52 869 THAs and of those, 1560 (3.0%) overlapping (mean age, 84 years
[interquartile range, 77-89 years]; 1293 [82.9%] were female). After matching, overlapping
hip fracture procedures had a greater risk for a complication (hazard ratio [HR], 1.85; 95% CI,
1.27-2.71; P = .001), as did overlapping THA procedures (HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.02-3.14; P = .04).
Among overlapping hip fracture operations, increasing duration of operative overlap was
associated with increasing risk for complications (adjusted odds ratio, 1.07 per 10-minute
increase in overlap; P = .009).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Overlapping surgery was relatively rare but was associated
with an increased risk for surgical complications. Furthermore, increasing duration of
operative overlap was associated with an increasing risk for complications. These findings
support the notion that overlapping provision of surgery should be part of the informed
consent process.

The American College of Surgeons (ACS) released guidelines
around concurrent and overlapping surgery.6 While 2 recently
published peer-reviewed studies8,9 have suggested that over-
lappingsurgeryisasafepractice,theybothhavesignificantlimi-
tations that limit their generalizability.
The current study sought to address this gap by examining
the impact of overlapping surgery for hip fractures and for pri-
mary elective total hip arthroplasty (THA) at more than 75 hos-
pitals in Ontario, Canada. The specific objectives of this study
were to (1) determine the extent of overlapping surgery in pa-
tientsreceivinghipsurgery;(2)assesswhetheroverlappingpro-
cedures are at increased risk for relevant surgical complica-
tions;and(3)toexplorewhetherthereisanassociationwiththe

Methods
Study Design and Setting
Weconductedapopulation-based,matched-cohortstudyusing
data from several health administrative databases from On-
tario, Canada (population of 13.5 million). Ontarians are in-
suredunderasingle-payersystem,whichcoversmedicallynec-
essary procedures, including hip fracture surgery and elective
hip arthroplasty. The study protocol was approved by the re-
search ethics board at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, To-
ronto, Ontario.
Data Sources
Data on every interaction a person has with our health care
system are captured within administrative databases. These
databases capture relevant demographic information on each
patient (eg, age, sex, comorbidity) and physician (eg, years in
practice, volume). The main data sources were hospital dis-
charge abstracts from the Canadian Institute for Health Infor-
mation Discharge Abstract Database (CIHI-DAD) and physi-
cian service claims from the Ontario Health Insurance Plan
(OHIP) Claims History Database.
Participants
We defined 2 cohorts: the first comprised patients older than
60yearswhohadundergoneanacutesurgicalprocedure(fixa-
tion or replacement) for a hip fracture between April 1, 2009,
and March 31, 2014. The second comprised patients older than
40 years who received a primary elective THA for arthritis be-
tween April 1, 2009, and March 31, 2015. During this study pe-
riod, entry and exit times from the operating room for every
surgical procedure in the province were recorded. We ex-
cluded procedures that were longer than 3 hours because this
length of time is atypical and likely represented challenging
cases that are not representative. See Table 1 for a full list of
exclusions.
Main Exposure Variable—Overlapping Surgery
The start and end times captured in the database for each pro-
cedure reflect the entry and exit times into the operating room.
As such, for each procedure, we chose the duration of overlap
to define a procedure as overlapping that would indicate that
the 2 procedures overlapped for a significant portion of time,
after accounting for the time required to transfer the patient
to the operating table, administer anesthesia, and properly po-
sition and drape the patient. We set the threshold of overlap
todefineaprocedureasoverlappingat30minutes,whichis ap-
proximately 30%ofthemedianduration(door-to-door)ofboth
THAs and hip fracture surgery.
Primary Outcome—Surgical Complications
The primary outcomes were the occurrence of an infection, re-
vision, or dislocation within a year.10 These were selected be-
cause they are the most likely to result from technical errors,
which in turn may occur during unsupervised portions of the
procedure. Other outcomes of interest were duration of sur-
gery and death within 90 days.
Covariates of Interest
We measured and adjusted for several patient and physician
covariates that have been previously shown to affect the risk
of occurrence of complications following hip surgery.10-14 Pa-
tient age and sex were obtained from the OHIP Registered Per-
sonsDatabases(RPDB).Comorbiditieswereassessedviaanad-
aptation of the Charlson Comorbidity Index with a look-back
of 5 years.15 The Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACGs) indicators
were used to identify “frail” patients.16,17 Diabetes mellitus,
Key Points
Question What is the association of overlapping surgery with
increased risks for complications following surgical treatment of
hip fractures and end-stage arthritis?
Findings In this population-based cohort study of patients with
hip fracture and hip arthritis, there were 960 and 1560
overlapping procedures, respectively. For patients undergoing
overlapping procedures, there was an approximately 90%
increase in the risk for surgical complications at 1 year, although
the association was weaker in elective hip replacements than in
hip fractures.
Meaning Overlapping surgery is associated with an increased risk
for complications in hip surgery, particularly for nonelective
procedures.

 priormyocardialinfarction(MI),congestiveheartfailure(CHF),
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cerebrovas-
cular disease, chronic renal failure, and dementia were iden-
tified using validated algorithms.18-24 Median neighborhood
household income quintile was used as a surrogate for socio-
economic status.25-27
Hospital volume was defined as the number of hip frac-
ture or THA procedures performed at the hospital in the 365
days prior to the index procedure. Surgeon volume was simi-
larly defined for each hip fracture and THA patient. Presence
of a billing surgical assistant was determined, as were his or
her specialty (orthopedic surgeon, nonorthopedic surgeon, or
family physician).
Matching
For each patient undergoing hip fracture repair or THA that
overlappedwithanotherprocedure,wematchedapatientwho
underwent the same surgical procedure by the same primary
surgeon without an overlapping procedure; we used “greedy”
matching.28 Patients were further matched according to age,
sex, and hospital where the surgery was performed. We
estimated standardized differences for all covariates after
matching with more than 10 differences considered to be in-
dicative of imbalance.29
Statistical Analyses
Baseline cohort characteristics were described using propor-
tions and medians as appropriate and were compared be-
tween groups using Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous
variables and χ2 tests for categorical variables. Cox propor-
tional hazard tests for the occurrence of a surgical complica-
tion were performed before and after matching, for the latter
pair-matching into account by stratifying on matched pairs. All
analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (ver-
sion 9.3 and EG 6.1; SAS Institute). The type I error probabil-
ity was set to α = .05 for all analyses.
Secondary Analysis
Wealsoperformedasecondaryanalysisintheoverlappingpro-
cedures. First, restricted cubic splines were used to visualize
therelationshipbetweendurationofoverlap(measuredinmin-
utes) and the probability as well as relative risk for a compli-
cation. Second, generalized estimating equations were used
to estimate the odds of complications following hip fracture
surgery based on the duration of overlap, after controlling for
relevant confounders. Other variables in the model included
income quintile, rurality, Charlson Comorbidity Index, frailty,
type of hip fracture, type of fixation, teaching hospital status,
and physician volume, as well as controlling for clustering by
the primary surgeon.
Results
Baseline Patient and Physician Characteristics
Between April 1, 2009, and March 31, 2014, there were 38 008
eligible patients with hip fracture (mean age, 66 years [inter-
quartile range, 57-74 years]; 52.4% were female) (Table 1 and
Table 2) and 52 869 eligible THA recipients(mean age, 84 years
[interquartile range, 77-89 years]; 82.9% were female) (Table 1
and Table 3). A total of 960 (approximately 2.5%) hip fracture
procedures and 1560 (approximately 3%) THAs were per-
formed overlapping with another procedure. More than 70%
of overlapping procedures were performed in teaching hospi-
tals. Prior to matching, overlapping patients with hip fracture
werenotsignificantlydifferentfrompatientswhodidnotover-
lap, in terms of age, sex, comorbidity, or fracture type (Table 2).
Among THAs, patients in overlapping procedures were slightly
younger and had a lower prevalence of comorbid conditions
(prior MI, dementia, diabetes, COPD). (Also see Appendices 1
and 2 and eTables 1-3 in the Supplement.)
Matching
A total of 855 overlapping hip fracture procedures (89%) were
successfully matched (by age, sex, procedure, attending sur-

After matching, absolute standardized differences were 10.0
or less for all measured confounders (Table 2), except for prior
MI, which was higher in the nonoverlapping group, and was

 complications (HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.02-3.14), but we could not
determine the relative risk for individual complications as we
were underpowered.
Secondary Analysis—Impact of Duration of Overlap
in Overlapping Procedures
The restricted cubic splines relating duration of overlap to the
risk for a surgical complication (Figure) suggest that these risks
increase with increasing duration of overlap, but differently
in hip fracture procedures than in THAs. Our regression analy-
sis also indicated that increased duration of overlap is associ-
ated with an increased risk for complications in hip fracture
procedures (adjusted odds ratio, 1.07 for every additional 10
minutes of overlap, P = .009).
Discussion
Key Results
We found that approximately 2.5% of patients with hip frac-
ture and 3.0% of THA recipients were operated on by a sur-
geonwhowasalsoperforminganotheroperation.Aftermatch-
ing, patients undergoing overlapping hip fracture repairs had
a significantly increased risk for surgical complications (an in-
crease from 6.4% to 10.4%). This risk worsened as the dura-
tion of overlap increased, with every additional 10 minutes of
overlap raising the risk for a complication by approximately
7.0%. Overlapping THA procedures were also at increased risk;
however, the relationship was not as pronounced (an increase
from 1.4% to 2.3%).
Interpretation
The primary outcome of our study was the occurrence of sur-
gical complications that directly related to the technical per-
formance of the surgery itself. Overlapping procedures were
at increased risk for the occurrence of a complication, particu-
larly infection and early revision. The most likely mechanism
for increased risk arises from having less experienced sur-
geons or surgical trainees perform portions of the case. We
know from previous work that lack of experience and low sur-
gical volumes are associated with an increased risk for surgi-
cal complications related to technical error.10 One of the tasks
most frequently delegated to trainees and assistants is clo-
sure of the operative wound, as this is not typically consid-
ered“critical.
”30However,inadequateclosureincreasestherisk
for prolonged wound healing and infection,31 which in turn in-
creases the likelihood of early revision. Interestingly the risk
associated with overlapping surgery was much lower in elec-
tive hip arthroplasty than in nonelective hip fracture proce-
dures. This suggests that the provision of overlapping sur-
gery may be safer when the entire surgical team can prepare
to deliver care to multiple patients, and perhaps when the pri-
mary surgeon can select assistants that he or she believes are
suitable to have certain parts of the case delegated to them.
WeselectedhipfracturerepairandelectiveTHAasthestudy
procedures for several reasons. The rates of these hip fractures
are increasing in North America32 and there is a large body of
evidence pointing toward improved outcomes with early sur-
gical intervention.33 In addition, timely treatment of hip frac-
tures is a quality indicator benchmark used by the provincial
government, and in other jurisdictions, to assess hospital
performance.34-36Asnonelectiveprocedures,schedulingofhip
fracture procedures must be balanced with the needs of pa-
tients who have been on waiting lists for elective procedures.
All of these factors contribute to overlapping hip fracture
surgery. However, THAs are one of the most common elective
orthopedic procedures in North America,37 and many centers
have developed standardized care pathways designed to safely
maximize operating room throughput for these procedures. In
addition, we wished to explore the safety of overlapping sur-
gery in the setting of an elective procedure, and indeed found
that it may be safer than for a nonelective procedure.

 We defined overlapping in our cohort as an overlap that
lasted for at least 30 minutes. This represents approxi-
mately 30% of the median time in the operating room for
both hip fracture procedures and THAs and allows for time
to position the patient and administer anesthesia. As such,
procedures labeled as overlapping likely represent ones
with a genuine surgical overlap, and that the overlap
resulted in someone other than the attending surgeon oper-
ating unsupervised for at least a portion of the case. Our
secondary analysis found that increased duration of overlap
in hip fracture procedures was associated with an increased
risk for complications, indicating that as the likelihood that
the surgical procedures themselves overlapped (as opposed
to positioning or induction of anesthesia), so did the risk for
a complication.
Generalizability
Our findings may not generalize to hospitals where overlap-
ping surgical procedures are more commonly performed.38
Indeed, overlapping hip fracture surgery seems to be an
anomaly in our jurisdiction, rather than standard of prac-
tice, which may have had an impact on the quality of its per-
formance. We also cannot assume our findings are general-
izable to other surgical procedures, such as more acute
surgical emergencies, where timely care may necessitate
overlapping surgery.3 However, we were able to assess over-
lapping surgery in both elective and nonelective circum-
stances. While our findings in the arthroplasty cohort in-
dicate that overlapping surgery might lead to slightly
increased risk for complications, the absolute increase in
the rates of complications is low. These findings further sug-
gest that overlapping surgery may be safer when performed
in the context of an elective procedure, when the surgeon
and the rest of the health care team can adequately prepare
to deliver care in an overlapping fashion.
Strengths and Limitations
While overlapping surgery has come under increasing scru-
tinyoflate,thisstudyis,toourknowledge,thefirstpopulation-
based study of this issue. We had the ability to capture com-
plications that presented at centers other than where the
original procedure was performed. We were also able to ex-
amine long-term outcomes (≤1 year), which allowed us to com-
pare complications that may result from technical error (eg,
infection, revision surgery).11,39 We controlled for various
confounders,includingpatient(age,sex,comorbidity)andphy-
sician (surgeon volume, hospital volume, teaching hospital)
factors. Recently, 2 studies have been published that indi-
cated that overlapping surgery does not confer any increased
risk for complications. Zhang et al9 performed a retrospective
review of a single institution over a 3-year period, and com-
pared the rates of complications at 30 days in multiple outpa-
tient procedures.9 However, they did not perform any risk
adjustment for procedure, or by patient and physician fac-
tors. Hyder et al8 looked at multiple surgical procedures at a
single center, using an m:n matching strategy in which all over-
lappingproceduresofaparticulartypeofsurgerywerematched
to all nonoverlapping procedures of the same type of surgery,
with subsequent adjustment for the individual surgeon. Nei-
ther study was able to capture complications that presented
at a different center.
This study used operating room entry and exit times on a
population-wide scale (ie, across an entire geographic area as
opposed to a single center or group of hospitals) to identify
overlapping surgical procedures.40 The data on surgery times
have high face validity; basic tests of their quality included that
(1)starttimesalwaysoccurredafterthehospitaladmissiontime
and that (2) “sensible” surgical durations are predicted by sur-
gery start and end times.41 We were able to measure and bal-
ance a wide variety of patient and physician factors between
groups. Matching by procedure, surgeon, and hospital levels
allowed us to control for unmeasured physician factors. Limi-
tationstothisstudyprimarilyrelatetounmeasuredfactorsthat
were not captured in our database(s), and the study design.
Weattemptedtomitigatetheimpactofunmeasuredconfound-
ers for physicians by matching by surgeon and hospital. How-
ever, there were other patient-level variables we were unable
to assess or control for, such as body mass index and smoking
history.
Weselected30minutesofoverlapasourthresholdtoiden-
tify a procedure as overlapping because it was approximately
one-third of the median door-to-door times for both cohorts;
this would provide sufficient time for induction of anesthe-
sia, positioning, and draping. However, it is possible that in
some procedures these steps would have taken longer, par-
ticularly in patients with hip fracture because they generally
have a higher burden of medical comorbidities. As such, we
performed a second analysis wherein we determined the im-
pact of the duration of overlap on the risk for complications
following hip fracture repair. We also generated splines for
both cohorts to visualize the relationship between overlap
duration and complication risk. These splines suggested that
increasing overlap was associated with an increased risk for
complications; this was more pronounced in hip fracture pro-
cedures than in elective hip arthroplasty.
Most important, we could not identify the actual location
of the attending surgeon, and could not determine where the
attendingsurgeonwasduring“criticalportions”ofthecase.7,38
According to the ACS,2 “concurrent” procedures occur when
“the critical or key components of the procedures for which
the primary attending surgeon is responsible are occurring all
or in part at the same time,” whereas in overlapping proce-
dures, the surgeon is present for all critical portions while a
“qualified practitioner” performs the noncritical portions in
the primary surgeon’
s absence. Although the distinction is po-
tentially important, this concept is severely limited by the fact
that there are no widely accepted definitions of what consti-
tutes a critical portion of a procedure; this is determined by
the primary surgeon. Every surgeon might have a unique defi-
nition for what might be a critical aspect of a specific proce-
dure, which might vary depending on the assistant(s) avail-
able to them. Our contention is that without having knowledge
of which portions of a procedure the attending surgeon would
identify as critical, then potentially every step of the proce-
dure from incision to closure may meet this threshold. This
might explain our findings that overlapping (as opposed to

 concurrent) hip surgery is also associated with an increased
risk for complications.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first population-based study ex-
amining the consequences of overlapping surgery at the level
of a health care system. Our results indicate that while over-
lapping surgery is uncommon in our jurisdiction for hip sur-
gery, it is a risk factor for complications, particularly for hip
fractures. Furthermore, an increasing duration of overlap with
another procedure is associated with progressively increas-
ing risk for complications. Most important, our findings rein-
force the notion that overlapping provision of surgery must be
part of the informed consent process.

HEALTH CARE POLICY AND LAW
Overlapping Surgery—
Perspectives From the Other Side of the Table
Alan L. Zhang, MD
In October 2015, the Boston Globe’
s Spotlight Team brought to
public attention the practice of overlapping or concurrent
surgery.1 The article, titled “Clash in the Name of Care,” high-
lighted possible complications arising from the practice of a
single attending surgeon per-
forming surgical procedures
on 2 patients in separate op-
erating rooms simultane-
ously. The attention garnered by this article would initiate an
investigation by the US Senate Finance Committee, changes
in hospital policies across the country, and a wave of research
aimedtoinvestigatethispractice.TheAmericanCollegeofSur-
geons (ACS) subsequently defined concurrent surgery as when
critical portions of cases are performed at the same time and
overlapping surgery as when critical portions do not coincide.2
Concurrentsurgeryhasbeenbannedbymedicalcentersacross
the country, whereas overlapping surgery is practiced at cer-
tain centers under careful supervision.
In their study published in this issue of JAMA Internal
Medicine, Ravi and colleagues3 evaluated the effects of over-
lappingsurgeryforthetreatmentofhipfracturesaswellaselec-
tive total hip replacements through an administrative data-
base of medical records from Ontario, Canada. The authors
analyzed procedures for 960 hip fracture cases and 1560 hip
replacement cases performed in an overlapping fashion
throughamatched-cohortanalysiswithnonoverlappingcases.
Their results showed that overlapping surgery produced in-
creased risk of surgical complications in a 1-year period after
hip fracture treatment as well as total hip replacement and that
longer overlap time was associated with a higher risk for
complications.
Currently, this seems to be the first study to show an ad-
verseeffectfromthepracticeofoverlappingsurgery.Priorstud-
ies, including those performed at my institution, have found
no association between patient complications and overlap-
ping surgery.4,5 In a review4 of all outpatient orthopedic pro-
cedures performed at our ambulatory surgery center over 3
years, we found no difference in procedure time or incidence
of adverse events within 30 days of surgery when comparing
2474 overlapping and 1166 nonoverlapping procedures. Our
analysis also demonstrated no relationship between longer
overlap time and increased adverse events. One reason for dif-
feringresultsbetweenthe2studiesincludesdifferencesinpro-
cedures and patient populations examined. In our study, out-
patient orthopedic surgical procedures, including arthroscopic
sports surgery, and minimally invasive hand, foot, and ankle
surgery with inherently low-risk for adverse events, were ex-
amined in a healthy population (average age of cohort, 44
years). Ravi et al3 evaluated inpatient surgical procedures for
the treatment of hip fractures and hip arthritis, which typi-
cally occur in medically fragile elderly patients (average age
of cohort, 84 years). The higher-risk procedures in an elderly
population with multiple comorbidities may have magnified
any adverse effects from the practice of overlapping surgery.
In addition, our study followed patients for 30 days after sur-
gery, whereas Ravi et al3 were able to track patients in their da-
