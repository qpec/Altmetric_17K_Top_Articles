ABSTRACT
Background: Relationships among sexual activity, problems and concerns, and well-being among older adults
have not been fully explored.
Aim: To investigate associations among sexual activity, problems and concerns, and experienced well-being in a
representative sample of older adults.
Methods: In this cross-sectional analysis from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, sexual behavior,
problems, and concerns were assessed via a self-completed questionnaire. Covariates included age, partnership
status, socioeconomic status, smoking status, alcohol intake, limiting long-standing illness, and depressive
symptoms. Data were analyzed using 1-way independent analysis of variance.
Main Outcome Measure: Enjoyment of life was assessed with the pleasure subscale of the CASP-19 (Control,
Autonomy, Self-realization, and Pleasure), a validated measure of quality of life specific to older age.
Results: Data on sexual activity and enjoyment of life were available for a total of 3,045 men and 3,834 women
(mean age 64.4 years in men and 65.3 years in women). Men and women who reported any sexual activity in the
past year had significantly higher mean enjoyment of life scores compared with those who were not sexually active
(men, 9.75 vs 9.44 [P < .001]; women, 9.86 vs 9.67 [P ¼ .003]). Among sexually active men, frequent (�2
times a month) sexual intercourse (P < .001) and frequent kissing, petting, or fondling (P < .001) were
associated with greater enjoyment of life. Among sexually active women, frequent kissing, petting, or fondling
was also associated with greater enjoyment of life (P < .001), but there was no significant association with
frequent intercourse (P ¼ .101). Concerns about one’s sex life and problems with sexual function were strongly
associated with lower levels of enjoyment of life in men and to a lesser extent in women.
Conclusion: This is among the first studies to show that well-being is higher among older adults when they are
sexually active. Preferences regarding the expression of sexual activity differed between the sexes. Further lon-
gitudinal research is needed to confirm a causal association between sexual activity and well-being. Smith L,

 INTRODUCTION
Research has shown that subjective well-being is associated
with a number of favorable health outcomes in older adults, as
well as with reduced mortality.1 Owing to such clear and
compelling evidence, promoting subjective well-being has been
identified as an important strategy for promoting public health in
various governmental and organizational policies.2,3 Subjective
well-being encompasses multiple aspects, including experienced
well-being (positive feelings, eg, pleasure and happiness, and
negative feelings, eg, distress), evaluative well-being (overall life
satisfaction), and eudemonic well-being (judgments about the
meaning and purpose in life).4
Experienced well-being, the most widely studied aspect, is typi-
cally conceptualized as positive psychological well-being, happiness,
or optimism. In a meta-analysis conducted a decade ago, positive
psychological well-being was associated with a 28% reduction in
mortality in healthy individuals (combined hazard ratio, 0.82; 95%
CI, 0.76e0.89; P < .001).5 More recent studies have shown
measures of positive affect, enjoyment of life, happiness, and opti-
mism to be protective against the risk of incident coronary heart
disease6 and to reduce the risk of mortality by up to 35%.7e11
To understand how we might effectively promote well-being
in later life, it is important to identify and understand its cor-
relates. A wide range of factors have been associated with well-
being in
older age,
including
fostering
and
maintaining
“noncognitive” life skills such as persistence and conscientious-
ness,12 social support and interaction with friends,13,14 religion
and spirituality,15 and better mobility status.16 Although
important, these factors may not be amenable to change.
A factor that may prove to be a promising modifiable target for
well-being in older age is sexual activity. Sexual health is defined
by the World Health Organization as “a state of physical,
emotional, mental, and social well-being related to sexuality, not
merely the absence of disease dysfunction or infirmity.”17 Sexual
activity is a central component of intimate relationships but has
been shown to decline with age. In a population-based study of
English adults, sexual activity was found to decrease substantially
from age 50e59 years to age �80 years in both men (from
94.1% to 31.1%) and women (from 53.7% to 14.2%).18 A
similar trend and magnitude of decline were also observed in a
U.S. population-based study.19
Several studies have suggested that frequent sexual intercourse
(defined in this study as �2 times a month), 1 aspect of sexual
activity, is associated with a range of benefits for psychological
and physiological well-being, such as improved quality of life and
mental health, increased heart rate variability, and lower risk of
certain cancers and fatal coronary events.1,20e24 Strikingly, a
“positive sex life” (defined based on frequency of intercourse in
men and enjoyment of intercourse in women) has been associ-
ated with a lower annual death rate.25
It is important to note that although the frequency of sexual
activity declines as people age, older adults are not asexual and
have sexual interest.26,27 The benefits of sexual activity may be
particularly relevant for older adults, given that mental and
physical health complications may increase with age28,29 and
tend to be negatively associated with well-being.30,31 Should an
association between sexual activity and well-being in later life be
identified, there would be considerable potential to improve the
well-being of older adults by supporting them in achieving and
maintaining an active sex life. It is plausible that a frequent and
problem-free sex life may be associated with higher levels of
experienced well-being in older adults; however, to our knowl-
edge, this has not yet been empirically evaluated.
The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate the
associations between sexual activity, problems, and concerns with
experienced well-being, measured as enjoyment of life, in a large,
population-based sample of older adults. It was hypothesized that
engagement in sexual activity and fewer sexual problems and
concerns would be associated with higher levels of experienced
well-being.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
Our data were drawn from the English Longitudinal Study of
Ageing (ELSA), a longitudinal panel study of men and women
age �50 years living in private households in England initiated in
2002. Full methodological details have been published else-
where.32 In brief, ELSA participants take part in biennial as-
sessments that include a computer-assisted personal interview
and self-completed questionnaires. Comparisons of the socio-
demographic characteristics of participants against results from
the English national census indicate that the sample is repre-
sentative of the population.32
In ELSA wave 6 (in 2012e2013), the self-completion mea-
sures administered to participants included a Sexual Relation-
ships and Activities Questionnaire (SRA-Q), which was returned
by 7,079 participants (67% of those eligible). In the present
analyses, we used these data in addition to data on enjoyment of
life, which was also assessed in wave 6. A total of 40 individuals
who did not respond to a question asking about engagement in
sexual activity over the last year were excluded, as were 170 who
had missing data on enjoyment of life, leaving a final analytic
sample of 6,869 men and women. All participants provided full
informed consent to participate in the study, and ethical approval
was obtained from the London Multi-Centre Research Ethics
Committee.
SRA-Q
The SRA-Q has been described in detail previously.18 Sex-
specific versions of the questionnaire were developed based on
previously validated measures, with some modifications made to
ensure that the data obtained were comparable with the National
Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles in the United
Kingdom33 and the National Social Life, Health and Aging
Sex Med 2019;7:11e18
12
Smith et al
 Study in the United States.34 The SRA-Q captures data on a
broad range of aspects of sexuality, including frequency of sexual
activities (sexual intercourse, masturbation, kissing, petting, or
fondling), problems with sexual function, concerns about sexual
activities and function, and sexual satisfaction. The versions of
the SRA-Q completed by men and women in this sample are
available online at http://www.elsa-project.ac.uk/documentation.
There were no alternative versions of the questionnaire available
for trans/gender-nonconforming/gender-fluid persons. To pro-
vide assurance of full anonymity of responses, the questionnaire
was completed in private and returned in a sealed envelope.
Enjoyment of Life
Enjoyment of life was assessed with the pleasure subscale of the
CASP-19 (Control, Autonomy, Self-realization, and Pleasure), a
previously validated measure developed specifically to assess
quality of life in old age.35 This instrument has been used to assess
the relationship between subjective well-being and mortality in the
ELSA.7,36 The pleasure subscale asks respondents to indicate their
agreement with 4 statements: (i) “I enjoy the things that I do,” (ii)
“I enjoy being in the company of others,” (iii) “On balance, I look
back on my life with a sense of happiness,” and (iv) “I feel full of
energy these days.” Responses are recorded on a 4-point Likert
scale from 0 (never) to 3 (often). Total scores range from 0 to 15,
with higher scores indicating greater enjoyment of life.
Potential Confounders
All potential confounders were selected a priori. Demographic
information collected included age, sex (male vs female; no other
genders were included) and partnership status (married/cohabit-
ing, separated/divorced, widowed, or single/never married). So-
cioeconomic status was based on household nonpension wealth,
which has been shown to be a sensitive indicator in this age
group,37 categorized into quintiles across all ELSA participants
who took part in wave 6. Descriptive data on ethnicity (white vs
nonwhite [ie, black, Asian, mixed ethnic group, other]) are also
presented, but ethnicity was not included as a covariate because the
ELSA sample is overwhelmingly white British. Health-related
covariates included self-reported limiting long-standing illness
(defined as any long-standing illness, disability, or infirmity that
limits activities in any way), current smoking status (smoker vs
nonsmoker), and frequency of alcohol intake, categorized as never/
rarely (never to once or twice a year), regularly (once every couple
of months to twice a week), or frequently (3 days a week to every
day or almost every day).18 Depressive symptoms were assessed
using the 8-item Centre of Epidemiological Studies Depression
scale, which has been validated for use in older adults.38
Statistical Analysis
Secondary data analyses were performed using SPSS version
22 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Data were weighted to correct for
sampling probabilities and differential nonresponse and to ensure
that the sample matched the 2011 National Census population
distributions for age and sex. The weights accounted for the
differential probability of being included in wave 6 of the ELSA
and for nonresponse to the SRA-Q. Full details of the weighting
procedure are available at http://doc.ukdataservice.ac.uk/doc/505
0/mrdoc/pdf/5050_elsa_w6_technical_report_v1.pdf.
1-way independent analysis of variance was used to examine
the extent to which sexual activities, problems, concerns, and
satisfaction were associated with enjoyment of life. Analyses were
performed separately for men and women, with age, partnership
status, wealth, limiting long-standing illness, smoking status,
alcohol intake, and depressive symptoms entered as covariates.
RESULTS
A total of 3,045 men and 3,834 women who provided data on
their sexual activity and enjoyment of life were included in the
present analyses. Sample characteristics are summarized in
Table 1. Participants ranged in age from 50 to 89 years (mean
age, 64.4 ± 9.8 years in men and 65.3 ± 10.1 years in women).
The majority were married or cohabiting with a partner (74% of
men and 60% of women) and were of white ethnicity (94% of
men and 96% of women). Approximately one-third of both men
and women reported a limiting long-standing illness, 1 in 7
participants were smokers, and the majority (84% of men and
69% of women) were regular alcohol drinkers.
Associations between sexual activities, problems, concerns, and
satisfaction and enjoyment of life are presented in Table 2. After
adjusting for sociodemographic and health-related covariates,
men and women who reported any sexual activity in the past year
had significantly higher mean enjoyment of life scores compared
with those who were not sexually active (men: 9.75 ± 0.04 vs
9.44 ± 0.07 [P < .001]; women: 9.86 ± 0.04 vs 9.67 ± 0.05
[P ¼ .003]). Among sexually active men, frequent (�2 times a
month) sexual intercourse (vaginal, anal, or oral) and frequent
kissing, petting, or fondling were associated with greater enjoy-
ment of life (P < .001 for both). In sexually active women,
frequent kissing, petting, or fondling was also associated with
greater enjoyment of life (P < .001), but frequent sexual inter-
course was not (P ¼ .101). Frequent (�2 times a month)
masturbation was not associated with enjoyment of life in either
men or women (P > .70).
Among men, difficulty having and maintaining an erection
was associated with poorer enjoyment of life (P < .001). In both
men and women, difficulty achieving orgasm was associated with
less enjoyment of life (P < .001 in both).
In men, concerns about one’s sex life were consistently asso-
ciated with poorer enjoyment of life, with lower mean enjoyment
of life scores in those who were concerned about their level of
sexual desire (P < .001), frequency of sexual activity (P ¼ .004),
ability to have an erection (P < .001), and orgasmic experience
(P < .001). These associations were less consistent in women,
with significantly poorer enjoyment of life reported by those
concerned about the frequency of sexual activity (P ¼ .001) and

 ability to become sexually aroused (P ¼ .018), but no association
observed between enjoyment of life and level of sexual desire or
orgasmic experience (P > .10 for both).
In both men (P < .001) and women (P ¼ .001), feeling
emotionally close to one’s partner during sex was associated with
greater enjoyment of life. Satisfaction with one’s overall sex life
was associated with greater enjoyment of life in men (P < .001),
but this association was not significant in women (P ¼ .132).
DISCUSSION
The present study has shown that several domains of sexual
activity and functioning are associated with well-being, specif-
ically enjoyment of life, in a large population-based sample of
older English adults. Men and women who reported any sexual
activity in the last year reported greater enjoyment of life
compared with those who were not sexually active. Moreover,
among those who were sexually active, a greater frequency of
kissing, petting, and fondling was associated with greater
enjoyment of life in both sexes and greater frequency of sexual
intercourse in men only. Feeling emotionally close to one’s
partner during intercourse was also associated with greater life
enjoyment. Those who experienced sexual problems or had
concerns about their sex life reported lower levels of life enjoy-
ment. Men who reported being satisfied with their overall sex life
reported greater enjoyment of life, but there was no significant
association between sexual satisfaction and enjoyment of life in
women.
These interesting findings support the hypothesis that “posi-
tive sexual activity” is associated with well-being. Several mech-
anisms may explain this novel association. First, sexual activity
has been shown to be associated with better health,18,19 and
better health is associated with greater enjoyment of life.39 Sec-
ond, during sexual activity or at the time sexual intercourse is at
its peak, there is a release of endorphins, which generates a happy
or blissful feeling after sex.40 Moreover, those who engage in
sexual intercourse with their partner are likely to share a closer
relationship,41 and indeed closeness to one’s partner has been
shown to be associated with well-being per se.31 This is sup-
ported by the present finding that feeling emotionally close to
one’s partner during intercourse was associated with greater life
enjoyment. Finally, sexual intercourse can be seen as a form of
physical activity that may yield similar physical and psychological
benefits as any activity, and thus may yield similar physical and
psychological benefits.42 Further research in the foregoing areas is
needed to understand what exactly is driving the observed as-
sociations between sexual activity, function, and concerns and
enjoyment of life, most likely a combination of factors.
Importantly, older adults’ concerns about their sex lives were
found to be negatively associated with life enjoyment. This is
likely related to the absence of the benefits of an active and
problem-free sex life discussed earlier. The management of sexual
health concerns might be more challenging for older adults than
for younger adults, due to the common misconception that in-
dividuals lose interest in sexual intercourse and the capacity to
engage in sexual activity,26,43,44 along with the inability or
reluctance of medical professionals to proactively address such
issues with older adults.45 Given the high prevalence of sexual
activity and reported levels of sexual health concerns in our
present study sample and others,26 there is a clear need to sup-
port older adults in maintaining a healthy sex life irrespective of
the effects on well-being. It can be speculated that without an
adequate coping system, such problems and concerns with one’s
sex life may manifest as mental health complications, such as
depression and anxiety; however, further research is needed to
test this hypothesis.
Although our data show an overall pattern for an association
between a “positive sex life” and greater life enjoyment in both
sexes, many aspects of sexuality were much more strongly
associated with enjoyment of life in men than in women. For

Sexual Activity and Life Enjoyment in Older Adults

 example, greater frequency of petting, fondling, and kissing was
associated with greater enjoyment of life in both sexes, but
greater frequency of intercourse was associated with enjoyment
of life in men only. These findings indicate potential sex dif-
ferences in the relative importance of different sexual activities.
It appears that sexual intercourse may be more important for
men than for women in terms of promoting well-being,
whereas women’s enjoyment is more closely linked to other
sexual activities. Although sexual intercourse tends to be the
most commonly assessed sexual activity, recent data show that
physical tenderness (ie, fondling or kissing) comprises a
considerable part of older adults’ sexual activity, particularly in
women.46 Thus, future studies should consider including
nonintercourse measures of sexual activity to gain a more
nuanced insight into the prevalence and importance of sexual
activity in older adults.
Satisfaction with one’s overall sex life was associated with greater
enjoyment of life in men, but the association was not significant in
women. A previous descriptive study found that lack of interest in
sex was more prevalent in elderly women compared with elderly
men.47 This could be due to a decline in levels of sex hormones,
which can influence sexuality after menopause.48 Another factor
that might influence female sexual behavior in later life is longevity;
on average, women live longer than men, and many may find it
difficult to find a partner after the loss of a spouse or partner. The
reason for this difficulty has not been systematically evaluated but
appears to be multidimensional, with biological, cultural, and
psychological factors playing roles.49
Aging is associated with a range of biological and physiological
changes to the human body, including a loss of skeletal muscle
mass,50 a decline in circulating levels of the principal androgen
and sex hormone testosterone,51 as well as a reduction in peak
bone mass.52 Such changes are likely to contribute to the age-
related increase in chronic health conditions, such as car-
diometabolic disease.53 The aging process likely increases the
prevalence of sexual problems54 and may reduce the frequency of
sexual activity. It is possible that men and women who are
sexually active have more positive aging parameters and fewer
chronic conditions, and thus tend to enjoy life more. Indeed, a
recent study across 4 countries showed that higher successful
aging scores were consistently related to a lower reduction in
sexual interest/enjoyment among both men and women.55
However, given that we controlled for age and limiting long-
standing illness in the present analysis, it is unlikely that these
factors are driving our present findings.
Strength of the present study include its large population-
based sample of older English adults and adjustment for a
range of sociodemographic and health-related confounders.
However, our findings must be interpreted in light of several
limitations. The cross-sectional study design precludes casual
inferences; for example, it is not clear whether sexual activity
allows one to enjoy life more or whether those who enjoy life
more are more likely to be sexually active. It is possible that the
relationship is bidirectional. A further limitation is that sexual
information was self-reported, and respondents might not have
answered questions honestly for fear of being judged. However, it
was made clear to participants that the survey responses would
remain anonymous, and each survey was returned in a sealed
envelope. Moreover, there are currently few other options besides
self-reporting questionnaires for measuring the variables investi-
gated in this study. Finally, we were unable to take into account
cultural norms which could influence reasons to engage in sexual
activity, and thus our findings might not be generalizable to
other countries with populations having differing attitudes to-
ward sex in later life.
CONCLUSION
In this large representative sample of older English adults,
sexual activity and feeling emotionally close to one’s partner
during sexual activity were associated with greater enjoyment of
life in both men and women, although an association between
overall satisfaction with sex life and enjoyment of life was only
evident in men. Men who experienced sexual problems or had
concerns about their sex life consistently reported lower levels of
life enjoyment, and some associations were also observed in
women. These findings have important implications for health
practitioners and caregivers, highlighting the need to acknowl-
edge that older adults are not asexual, and that a frequent and
problem-free sex life in this population is related to improved
well-being. Information on and encouragement to try new sexual
positions and explore different types of sexual activity is not
regularly given to aging populations. Engaging in discussions
regarding sexuality in later life could help redress perceived
norms and expectations about sexual activity in older people and
help them live more fulfilling lives. Our present findings and
those of others54 suggest that it may be beneficial for physicians
to routinely query geriatric patients about their sexual activity
and to offer help for sexual difficulties.
