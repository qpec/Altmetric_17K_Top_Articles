Abstract
Objectives—To report characteristics of sexual minority US inmates.
Methods—We drew our data from the National Inmate Survey, 2011–2012, a probability sample 
of inmates in US prisons and jails. We determined weighted proportions and odds ratios with 95% 
confidence intervals to estimate differences between sexual minority and heterosexual inmates.
Results—Sexual minorities (those who self-identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual or report a same-
sex sexual experience before arrival at the facility) were disproportionately incarcerated: 9.3% of 
men in prison, 6.2% of men in jail, 42.1% of women in prison, and 35.7% of women in jail were 
sexual minorities. The incarceration rate of self-identified lesbian, gay, or bisexual persons was 
1882 per 100 000, more than 3 times that of the US adult population. Compared with straight 
inmates, sexual minorities were more likely to have been sexually victimized as children, to have 
been sexually victimized while incarcerated, to have experienced solitary confinement and other 
sanctions, and to report current psychological distress.
Conclusions—There is disproportionate incarceration, mistreatment, harsh punishment, and 
sexual victimization of sexual minority inmates, which calls for special public policy and health 
interventions.
Little is known about incarcerated sexual minorities. Early research that discussed the 
incarceration of sexual minorities, often in the context of the criminalization of sodomy, 
presupposed that sexual minorities were the aggressors or “abnormal deviants.”1(p81) After 
the mid-1970s, with the beginning of the decriminalization of sodomy, scholars and 
advocates shifted the discourse to understanding sexual minorities through the lens of 
antidiscriminatory principles to see lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people as a group 
targeted in hate crimes and other forms of bias.1–3 Public health researchers have focused on 
incarceration as a risk for adverse health outcomes, primarily HIV in men who have sex with 
men (MSM).4–6 Although some studies have suggested that incarceration itself leads to an 
increased risk of HIV infection,7 1 meta-analysis does not support this assertion.8
Since the passage of the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 in the United States, studies 
have focused on sexual assault during incarceration.9–11 Among other stipulations, the law

 required the US Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) to collect data on 
the sexual victimization of inmates. BJS analyses using these data showed that sexual 
minority inmates are at high risk for sexual victimization in jails and prisons and that they 
experience high rates of administrative segregation (e.g., solitary confinement). For example, 
BJS reported that 12.2% of sexual minorities in prisons and jails reported being sexually 
victimized by another inmate and 5.4% reported being sexually victimized by staff, 
compared with 1.2% and 2.1%, respectively, of heterosexual inmates.13
We sought to advance knowledge of the characteristics of incarcerated sexual minorities 
using the Prison Rape Elimination Act data that describe a probability sample of US LGB 
inmates in jails and prisons. To our knowledge, our study provides the first description of 
these rich data by independent researchers outside BJS and demonstrate the scale of LGB 
incarcerations. We have presented information on offense history and sentence, childhood 
victimizations, mental health, and victimization and consensual sexual activity while 
incarcerated. Additionally, we are the first, to our knowledge, to describe both identity and 
sexual behavior measures of sexual orientation and to describe incarcerated sexual minority 
men and women separately.
METHODS
In the National Inmate Survey, 2011– 2012 (NIS-3), a probability sample of 106 532 US 
inmates was interviewed between February 2011 and May 2012 in 233 state and federal 
prisons and in 358 jails and 15 special facilities (e.g., military, Indian country, and 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities). BJS defines jails as “locally operated, 
short term facilities that hold inmates awaiting trial or sentencing or both, and inmates 
sentenced to a term of less than 1 year, typically misdemeanants” and prisons as “long term 
facilities run by the state or the federal government … [that] typically hold felons and 
inmates with sentences of more than 1 year.”14 Of the 106 532 interviews conducted in the 
NIS in 2011–2012, a random sample of n = 13 617 were excluded who were administered 
different, unrelated questionnaire sections; n = 1738 respondents younger than 18 years and 
n = 10 576 respondents had missing data. We analyzed the data of 80 601 respondents.
NIS interviews averaged 35 minutes. They were conducted privately in each facility with the 
inmate. Computer-assisted personal interviewing started the interview, and, after a brief 
interview, the respondent completed the remainder of the interview using a touchscreen and 
synchronized audio instructions delivered via headphones using audio computer-assisted 
self-interviewing. In the audio computer-assisted self-interviewing portion of the interview 
the interviewer provided privacy by walking away from the computer.
The NIS-3 data are managed by the BJS and are available to the public through the National 
Archive of Criminal Justice Data at the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social 
Research. To minimize the risk of breach of confidentiality of survey participants, BJS 
modified the NIS-3 public data set as follows: removed obvious identifiers, recoded 
continuous measures to ordinal, and deleted original variables and random perturbations (a 
method that removes sensitive variables from the data for confidentiality concerns) that may 
add noise to the data but not alter any estimate. To minimize disclosure risk, BJS did not

 disclose the specific procedures of perturbation, but notes for the NIS-3 state that there are 
minimal differences between weighted estimates before and after perturbation.13
In accordance with numerous conditions of usage set by the BJS and National Archive of 
Criminal Justice Data—including, but not limited to, significant restrictions on the number 
of tables we could produce—we performed all data analyses during 4 visits to the restricted 
data enclave at the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research in Ann 
Arbor, Michigan. The tables we produced there were subject to review by BJS and National 
Archive of Criminal Justice Data staff before being released to us.
Measures
Inmates were asked 2 questions related to sexual orientation: “Do you consider yourself to 
be heterosexual or ‘straight,’ bi-sexual, or homosexual or gay [or lesbian, for women]?” and 
“Before you entered this facility, had you had sex with men only, women only, or both men 
and women?” We categorized inmates as LGB if they identified as such in response to the 
first question. We categorized men and women who reported any same-sex sexual behavior 
before entering the facility but did not identify as LGB as MSM or women who have sex 
with women (WSW). We categorized inmates who neither identified as LGB nor reported 
having same-sex sexual partners before incarceration as straight.
We categorized respondents on the basis of their reply to ethnicity and race questions as 
Hispanic (including Latino and Spanish origin), non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black 
(or African American), and non-Hispanic other (including American Indian or Alaska 
Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and multiracial). The age groups 
were 18 to 29 years, 30 to 44 years, and 45 years and older. We dichotomized education to 
indicate whether the respondent completed less than high school or completed high school 
or more years of education (including some college or associate degree and college degree 
or higher). We conducted our analyses stratified by sex as coded in NIS-3.
Incarceration-Related Factors
Respondents reported the nature of the offense for which they were incarcerated at the time 
of the interview. We used the recoded variable (MOST_SERIOUS_OFFENSE) provided by 
NIS-3 to create 3 categories: violent sexual, violent nonsexual, and other (including property 
and drug offenses and parole violation).
Respondents also reported sentence length, and we categorized it for prisons as less than 1 
year, 1 to 5 years, 5 to 10 years, 10 to 20 years, and more than 20 years (including life and 
death sentences); and for jails as less than 1 year, 1 to 5 years, and 5 years or more. 
Respondents reported whether they “spent any time in disciplinary or administrative 
segregation or solitary confinement.”
Health Outcomes
Respondents were given the K-6 scale15—a screening scale asking for symptoms of distress 
in the 30-day period before the interview.

 High scores on the scale are associated with a greater likelihood of the presence of a mental 
disorder. We used the NIS-3 calculated scale score (MH_K6_SCORE1), which provides a 
dichotomized indicator of no versus likely presence of mental disorder (defined as a score 
above 7 on the scale).
Sexual Victimization and Consensual Sex
We used the variable of childhood sexual assault, which asked respondents whether they 
were “physically forced, pressured, or made to feel [they] had to have sex or sexual contact” 
before age 18 years.
Respondents were asked whether they had unwanted sexual contact with other inmates or 
any sexual contact with staff in the 12 months before the interview. Sexual victimization 
included touching or being touched in a sexual way, oral sex, vaginal sex, and anal sex.
We used the NIS-3 recoded variable (INMATE_CONSENSUAL), which describes whether 
the respondent had consensual (“wanted or voluntary”) sex with other inmates in the 12 
months before the interview.
Analytic Strategy
We weighted data to account for probability of selection, nonresponse, and post-stratified to 
reflect a facility’s population by inmate age, gender, race, time since admission, and 
sentence length. All the parameter estimates are weighted, and the SEs account for the 
complex design of the NIS-3. Further details of sampling and weighting procedures can be 
found in BJS reports on the NIS-3.13
We have reported all results separately for men and women. We have reported pro-portions 
weighted for the complex sampling procedure of the NIS-3 by sexual orientation analytic 
groups (LGB vs MSM or WSW vs straight). We have further reported odds ratios (ORs) and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) from logistic regressions that adjusted for demographics and, 
as indicated, the length of time in the facility when this could affect the risk for the 
dependent variable (e.g., the risk for an inmate to be sexually victimized may increase the 
longer an inmate is in a facility).
RESULTS
The sample included 47 471 (unweighted) inmates older than 18 years in jails and 33 130 
(unweighted) inmates older than 18 years in prisons. Of the men in jails, 6.2% were sexual 
minorities, including 3.3% (SE = 0.1) gay or bisexual men and an additional 2.9% (SE = 
0.1) who reported having had sex with men before arrival at the facility but did not self-
identify as gay or bisexual (MSM). Among men in prisons, 9.3% were sexual minorities, 
including 5.5% (SE = 0.2) gay or bisexual men and 3.8% (SE = 0.1) MSM.
Among women in jails, 35.7% were sexual minorities, including 26.4% (SE = 0.7) lesbian or 
bisexual women and 9.3% (SE = 0.4) who reported sex with women before arrival at the 
facility but did not identify as lesbian or bisexual (WSW). Among women in prison, 42.1%

 were sexual minorities, including 33.3% (SE=0.6) lesbian or bisexual women and 8.8% (SE 
= 0.4) WSW (all proportions are weighted).
Demographic Characteristics of Incarcerated Sexual Minorities
Table 1 (prisons) and Table A (jail; available in a supplement to the online version of this 
article at http://www.ajph.org) show that compared with straight men, both gay or bisexual 
men and MSM tend to be older (prisons: OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.2, 1.6 and OR = 2.0; 95% CI 
= 1.7, 2.3, respectively; jails: OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.2, 1.6 and OR = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.9, 2.7, 
respectively). Gay or bisexual men were less likely than were heterosexuals to be Black 
(prisons: OR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.5, 0.7; jails: OR = 0.6; 95% CI = 0.5, 0.7) or Hispanic 
(prisons: OR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.4, 0.6; jails: OR = 0.7; 95% CI = 0.6, 0.9). The racial/ethnic 
composition of MSM was similar to that of gay or bisexual men. The educational attainment 
of sexual minority men was similar to that of straight men, except that gay or bisexual men 
in jails were more likely than were straight men to have attained higher educational levels 
(OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.2, 1.6).
Table 1 shows that, by contrast to men, lesbian or bisexual women and WSW tended to be 
younger than were straight women (prisons: OR = 0.3; 95% CI = 0.3, 0.4 and OR = 0.8; 
95% CI = 0.7, 1.0, respectively; jails: OR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.4, 0.5 and OR = 0.9; 95% CI = 
0.8, 1.1, respectively). Sexual minority women tended to have more mixed patterns of race/
ethnic distribution than did sexual minority men. For example, lesbians or bisexual women 
in prisons were more likely than were straight women to be Black (OR = 1.2; 95% CI = 1.0, 
1.4) and of other non-Hispanic, non-White races (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.2, 1.7). However, 
WSW in prisons were less likely than were straight women to be Black (OR = 0.7; 95% CI = 
0.5, 0.9) or Hispanic (OR = 0.4; 95% CI = 0.3. 0.5). Lesbian or bisexual women and WSW 
tended to have lower education attainment than did straight women (prisons: OR = 0.75; 
95% CI = 0.66, 0.84 and OR = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.64, 0.94, respectively; jails: OR = 0.81; 
95% CI = 0.70, 0.94 and OR = 1.07; 95% CI = 0.88, 1.31, respectively).
Mental Health and Childhood Sexual Victimization
Table 2 (prisons) and Table B (jails; available as a supplement to the online version of this 
article at http://www.ajph.org) show results for mental health problems and history of 
childhood sexual victimization. Both gay or bisexual men and MSM in both prisons and jails 
had a higher prevalence of poor mental health than did straight men. Among women, mental 
health problems were similar for sexual minority and straight women with one exception: 
lesbian or bisexual women in prisons had a higher prevalence of poor mental health than did 
straight women in prisons.
Table 2 also shows that for men and women in both prisons and jails, LGB, MSM, and 
WSW had higher odds of sexual victimization in childhood than did their straight 
counterparts. These associations had very strong effect sizes, with ORs ranging from 4.2 to 
7.0 among men and 2.2 to 2.7 among women.

 Criminal History and Sentence Length
Table 2 and Table B also show results for offense, sentence length, and administrative 
segregation. With a few exceptions—most notably women in jails—sexual minority men and 
women were more likely than were straight men and women to be incarcerated for violent 
sexual and nonsexual crimes rather than crimes related to property, drugs, or parole 
violations. We found the most consistent differences in sentence lengths to be between 
lesbian or bisexual women and straight women. In both prisons and jails, lesbian or bisexual 
women were sentenced to longer periods than were straight women. The only significant 
difference between WSW and straight women was that WSW were more likely to have a 
sentence of longer than 20 years in prison. Among men, the only significant difference was 
that gay or bisexual men, but not MSM, were more likely than were straight men to have 
sentences longer than 10 years in prison.
In general, sexual minority men and women were significantly more likely to have spent 
time in disciplinary or administrative segregation or solitary confinement in both prisons and 
jails than were straight men and women (this relationship was not significant for WSW in 
jails; Table 2).
Sexual Victimization in Jails and Prisons
Table 3 (prisons) and Table C (jails; available as a supplement to the online version of this 
article at http://www.ajph.org) show the 1-year history of sexual victimization. Among men, 
sexual minorities (both gay or bisexual men and MSM) had a much higher risk than did 
straight men of being sexually victimized by staff and other inmates in both prisons and jail. 
Among women, the patterns were similar, with sexual minority women showing a greater 
risk of sexual assault. There was 1 distinct difference: staff sexual victimization in prisons 
and jails was not higher for lesbian or bisexual women or WSW than for straight women. 
Assault by another inmate was higher for LGB women than straight women in both prisons 
and jails and for WSW in prisons but not for WSW in jails. Gay or bisexual men, MSM, 
lesbian or bisexual women, and WSW were more likely than were straight inmates to have 
had consensual sex with other inmates (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
We found that 5.5% and 3.3% of men in prisons and jails, respectively, identify as gay or 
bisexual, a proportion that is similar or somewhat higher than the 3.6% proportion of gay or 
bisexual men in the US population.16 An additional 3.8% and 2.9% of men in prisons and 
jails, respectively, reported having had sex with another man (but do not identify as gay or 
bisexual) before entering their facility. By contrast, we found that 33.3% and 26.4% of 
women in prisons and jails, respectively, identified as lesbian or bisexual, a proportion that is 
about 8 to 10 times greater than the 3.4% of lesbian or bisexual women in the US 
population.17 An additional 8.8% and 9.3% of women in prisons and jails, respectively, had 
sex with another woman (but are not lesbian or bisexual identified) before entering their 
facility. It should be noted that these proportions, which include people who self-identified 
as gay, lesbian, or bisexual as well as people who have had sex with a same-sex partner

 before arrival at their facility, are lower than are proportions reported in some nonprobability 
samples for same-sex sexual behavior while incarcerated.17
On the basis of the estimated number of men and women who are incarcerated in US prisons 
and jails18 and using the weighted proportion of incarcerated sexual minorities we have 
reported, we estimate that there are approximately 94 900 gay and bisexual men, 69 600 
MSM, 56 400 lesbian and bisexual women, and 17 000 WSW in prisons and jails. In total, 
approximately 238 000 sexual minorities are incarcerated (151 300 LGB and 86 600 MSM 
or WSW). On the basis of the population estimate of about 8 039 000 LGB persons (4 008 
000 men and 4 031 000 women) in the United States,16 this corresponds to an incarceration 
rate of 1882 per 100 000 LGB people, or 2368 per 100 000 gay or bisexual men and 1399 
per 100 000 lesbians or bisexual women. These figures show that the rate of incarceration of 
LGB persons is approximately 3 times higher than is the already high general US 
incarceration rate of 612 per 100 000 US residents aged 18 years or older in 2014.19
Limitations
We are limited to presenting descriptive data, which cannot offer explanations for causes of 
the observed patterns. We would like to know much more about the pathways to 
incarceration for sexual minorities, their physical and mental health, access to care within 
the penal system, and prejudice and stigma faced by sexual minority populations in the 
criminal justice system (including before and after incarceration). Our data are also limited 
by self-reports that cannot be verified by more objective data. For example, inmates’ report 
of their crimes and sentences may be biased by poor memory or a limited understanding of 
the particular legal codes under which they were sentenced.
Despite these limitations, the Prison Rape Elimination Act data, using a probability sample 
of US inmates, offer the most comprehensive view of incarcerated sexual minorities to date. 
Three findings are among many that deserve further research to inform public policy. We 
offer insight on the basis of research and theory to provide guidance for future research.
Overrepresentation of Sexual Minority Women
Some readers may find our report of a high proportion of sexual minorities among the 
incarcerated surprising. Understanding the pathways that lead sexual minorities to 
incarceration and explain disparities in incarceration rates would require further research. A 
theory of prejudice, stigma, and social disadvantage suggests one direction: prejudice toward 
sexual minorities may lead to discriminatory treatment, from initial contact with police 
through various stages of the criminal justice system. For example, the profiling of sexual 
minority people as more likely to engage in sex work or commit sexual offenses may lead to 
overpolicing and subsequent incarceration.20
Among factors that may increase the risk of incarceration of sexual minorities are stressors 
related to family rejection, the use of illegal drugs, and community-level marginalization 
related to the stigmatization of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people.21 Also, 
especially regarding the high representation of sexual minority women among the 
incarcerated, gender analysis may be instructive. To the extent that sexual minority women 
are perceived as failing to conform to societal norms of femininity (e.g., by being labeled as

 masculine or aggressive),22, 23 individuals and institutions might stereotype them as 
threatening or dangerous, thus leading to more punitive treatment.
Punishing Consensual Sex Among Inmates
Perhaps not surprisingly, because of sex segregation in carceral institutions, we found that 
sexual minority inmates are more likely than are straight inmates to have consensual sex 
with other inmates. Consensual sexual contact among inmates is typically a violation of 
institutional rules in prisons and jails. Indeed, sexual minority inmates are routinely 
punished for such behavior, with consequences that can affect parole, housing, access to 
programs, and family visitation.24 The National Standards to Prevent, Detect, and Respond 
to Prison Rape under the Prison Rape Elimination Act do not address consensual same-sex 
sexual behavior. Sexual contact between inmates raises safety concerns when officials 
cannot discern consent, for example, when victimized inmates are coerced into sex and do 
not complain for fear of retribution. Distinguishing abusive from nonabusive sex is 
challenging, but the risks of overpolicing consensual behavior ought not to be ignored. 
Paradoxically, regulations and procedures that aim to prevent sexual victimization, which 
disproportionately affects sexual minorities, may also lead to unintended harm when these 
populations face serious consequences for nonabusive behavior that is related to their sexual 
orientation. Moreover, studies have shown that because sexual minorities transgress societal 
norms, they are more likely than are their straight peers to be disciplined for even nonsexual 
behaviors (e.g., attire, gender expression).24 The impact of rules prohibiting consensual sex 
in prisons and jails has not received sufficient attention from researchers or practitioners, 
despite their disproportionate and serious consequences for sexual minority populations.17
Psychological Distress
In addition to punishing inmates for consensual same-sex sexual behavior, some facilities 
isolate sexual minority individuals, purportedly for their own protection, in administrative 
segregation. We found that sexual minority inmates (except for WSW in jails) were 
significantly more likely to have experienced administrative or punitive segregation than 
were straight inmates. The deprivation inherent in many forms of segregation is severe. In 
turn, segregation is also related to adverse health and mental health outcomes.25
Our finding of a high prevalence of psychological distress among sexual minority inmates 
probably reflects a variety of causes that need to be assessed.26 First, sexual minorities may 
have higher rates of distress predating their incarceration. Sexual minorities in the general 
population have a higher prevalence of distress than do heterosexuals, which is caused by 
exposure to minority stress—stress related to homophobia, including events occurring in 
childhood.27
Second, incarceration itself has a strong independent impact on psychological distress and is 
considered a social determinant of mental health problems.28 Although incarceration can 
lead to distress in both sexual minorities and heterosexuals, we found that sexual minorities 
in jails and prisons experience harsher conditions—including disproportionate sexual 
victimization, administrative or punitive segregation, and longer sentences—which may 
place them at higher risk for distress than that of the heterosexual incarcerated population.

 Although medical care in prisons and jails is legally mandated for all inmates, the quality of 
services “lags far behind the standard of care in the community.”29(p389) The high prevalence 
of psychological distress we found among sexual minority inmates raises great concerns 
about the quality of their mental health treatment while incarcerated.
Conclusions
Observing lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people in prisons, Borchert commented,
The mistreatment of LGBT prisoners goes above and beyond the normal 
degradation meted out by the state, enacting a disparate set of punishments for 
LGBT people markedly different than prisoners perceived as heterosexual and/or 
gender conforming.24(p210)
Our findings are consistent with this view and suggest that sexual minority inmates are, in 
many of the measured characteristics, distinct from their heterosexual counterparts and that 
they experience higher rates of mistreatment, harsh punishment, and victimization.
The disproportionate overrepresentation of sexual minorities among the incarcerated, 
particularly among women, indicates an urgent need to incorporate this new insight into 
public health and criminal justice approaches to incarceration. For sexual minority inmates 
more generally, the increased likelihood of consensual sex with other inmates places them at 
disproportionate risk for punitive sanctions. Sexual minority inmates, who are put into 
segregation in significantly greater numbers, experience deprivation that is psychologically 
difficult to endure. Widespread sexual victimization compounds the risk these inmates often 
face. Our finding that sexual minority inmates have a higher prevalence of psychological 
distress than do their heterosexual counterparts raises serious concerns about exposure to 
harm while incarcerated as well as access to much needed mental health care.
Sexual minority populations are, therefore, in need of special attention as the rollout of the 
National Standards to Prevent, Detect, and Respond to Prison Rape under the Prison Rape 
Elimination Act continues. In particular, awareness of the heightened risk that sexual 
minority populations face for sexual victimization, isolation, disproportionate punishment, 
and psychological distress ought to guide both officials working in these settings and public 
health professionals. In addition, all BJS studies (rather than a select few) should include 
data disaggregated by sexual minority status to better illuminate the circumstances faced by 
this uniquely vulnerable population.
