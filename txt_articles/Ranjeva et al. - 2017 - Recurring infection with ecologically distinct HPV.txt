The high prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV), the most
common sexually transmitted infection, arises from the coexis-
tence of over 200 genetically distinct types. Accurately predict-
ing the impact of vaccines that target multiple types requires
understanding the factors that determine HPV diversity. The diver-
sity of many pathogens is driven by type-specific or “homolo-
gous” immunity, which promotes the spread of variants to which
hosts have little immunity. To test for homologous immunity and
to identify mechanisms determining HPV transmission, we fitted
nonlinear mechanistic models to longitudinal data on genital
infections in unvaccinated men. Our results provide no evidence
for homologous immunity, instead showing that infection with
one HPV type strongly increases the risk of infection with that
type for years afterward. For HPV16, the type responsible for
most HPV-related cancers, an initial infection increases the 1-year
probability of reinfection by 20-fold, and the probability of rein-
fection remains 14-fold higher 2 years later. This increased risk
occurs in both sexually active and celibate men, suggesting that it
arises from autoinoculation, episodic reactivation of latent virus,
or both. Overall, our results suggest that high HPV prevalence and
diversity can be explained by a combination of a lack of homolo-
gous immunity, frequent reinfections, weak competition between
types, and variation in type fitness between host subpopulations.
Because of the high risk of reinfection, vaccinating boys who have
not yet been exposed may be crucial to reduce prevalence, but our
results suggest that there may also be large benefits to vaccinat-
ing previously infected individuals.

H
uman papillomavirus (HPV), a major cause of genital warts
and anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers (1), is the most
common sexually transmitted infection (2). While the popula-
tion prevalence of genital HPV is ∼40% among women and 45%
among men in the United States, over 200 HPV types have been
identified, and the prevalence of individual types never exceeds
10% (3). The quadrivalent vaccine has been effective against the
HPV types that cause the most disease (4), and a recent nine-
valent vaccine covers additional oncogenic types (5). Predicting
the effects of multivalent vaccines on HPV prevalence, however,
is difficult without defining the factors that underlie HPV trans-
mission and diversity, which are poorly understood.
Epidemiological theory has shown that the abundance of
many pathogens depends on the dynamics of competition for
susceptible hosts (6–8). Pathogen strains compete by inducing
adaptive immune responses that are specific to shared anti-
gens, limiting the growth rates of antigenically similar competi-
tors (8). The accumulation of specific immunity in the host
population to common strains decreases the transmission of
those strains and promotes the spread of rarer antigenic vari-
ants, a phenomenon known as negative frequency-dependent
selection. Such immune-mediated competition can partly explain
the antigenic and genetic diversity of influenza, pneumococcus,
rotavirus, norovirus, Neisseria meningitidis, malaria, hepatitis C,
HIV, trypanosomes, and other common pathogens (6–9).
It is unclear how HPV interacts with the immune system dur-
ing infection, but in principle, distinctions between HPV types
may arise because of acquired immunity from B cells and T cells.
HPV types are defined by a 10% threshold of dissimilarity in
the L1 gene, which codes for the major capsid protein (10). The
outer capsid modulates viral entry into host cells at the epithelial
basement membrane (11), and the humoral response to infec-
tion is mainly type-specific anti-L1 antibodies (12). Studies of
HPV in T cell-deficient people show that cellular immunity is
important to control infection (13), but it is unclear how cellular
immunity achieves type-specific recognition, if at all. In individ-
uals with HPV16-related cancerous lesions, cytotoxic T lympho-
cytes specific to the E6 and E7 oncoproteins are correlated with
reduced disease (14, 15). The specificity of the T-cell repertoire
to other genes or to the majority of HPV types, however, is not
well-established.
Efforts to understand the effects of immunity on HPV dynam-
ics must begin with homologous immunity or protection against
Significance
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually
transmitted infection. Understanding the factors underlying
the prevalence and diversity of over 200 HPV types is neces-
sary to predict the effects of multivalent vaccines. We investi-
gate HPV transmission dynamics by fitting mechanistic models
to data from unvaccinated men. We find that infection risk in a
susceptible population is, on average, low and concentrated in
high-risk individuals and that, rather than inducing protective
immunity, HPV infection strongly increases the risk of future
infection by the same type. Thus, high HPV prevalence results
from frequent reinfection or persistent infections within indi-
viduals. Vaccinating boys before their first HPV exposure may
be especially effective in reducing prevalence, and vaccinating
previously infected men may also be effective.

 repeat infection with the same HPV type. Homologous immu-
nity would limit the prevalence of any type through negative
frequency dependence. The traditional assumption is that most
HPV-infected individuals permanently clear infection after 1–2 y
(16–18), suggesting protective homologous immunity. In this sce-
nario, the elevated cancer risk associated with particular HPV
types results from a small fraction of persistent infections (18).
Longitudinal studies, however, have shown that hosts can be
infected repeatedly (19). Although type-specific antibodies may
provide modest protection against future infection in women
(20), serum antibody is not a marker of immune protection
in men (21, 22). Thus, the strength of homologous immunity
remains unclear.
Evidence for competition between HPV types is also conflict-
ing. Immune-mediated competition has been invoked to explain
small increases in the prevalence of nonvaccine HPV types after
HPV vaccination (23) and to explain weak cross-protection from
the vaccine against related nonvaccine types (24). Mathematical
models show that type competition is consistent with observed
patterns of HPV prevalence (25, 26). Nevertheless, there is lit-
tle empirical evidence for intertype competition (27), as shown
in part by elevated rates of multiple-type compared with single-
type infections and frequent concurrent acquisition of HPV
types (28).
Meanwhile, the risk of HPV infection depends on differences
in demographic and behavioral risk factors between host sub-
populations. For example, a host’s number of sexual partners
strongly affects infection risk (1, 18, 29), and some evidence sug-
gests that oncogenic and nononcogenic types are differently sen-
sitive to the numbers of partners among hosts (30). However,
detailed comparisons of risk factors for infection with each HPV
type have not been performed. Different risk factors would sug-
gest differences between types among host subpopulations that
could explain type prevalence.
To investigate the factors determining HPV prevalence and
diversity, we fitted mechanistic models of HPV dynamics to an
extensive longitudinal dataset. Mechanistic models have long
been used in infectious disease ecology to quantify the biolog-
ical processes that underlie pathogen dynamics, but HPV has
received comparatively little attention (17). HPV models have
generally focused on qualitative dynamics (25, 31–33) and on
predictions for health policy (34, 35), relying on informal meth-
ods to estimate parameters. Detailed longitudinal studies present
an opportunity to use mechanistic models to rigorously test
hypotheses with robust statistical methods. Here, we use such
methods to show that the prevalence and diversity of HPV types
are best explained by the combined effects of a lack of competi-
tion within and between types, high rates of reinfection or per-
sistence within individuals, and modest differences in high-risk
subpopulations between types.
Results
Low-Prevalence HPV Types Coexist over Time. We fitted models to
data from the HPV in Men (HIM) Study, which tracks genital
HPV infection and demographic and behavioral traits in unvac-
cinated men sampled at 6-mo intervals over 5 y (36). In these
data, the mean prevalence of all HPV is 65%, but no type has
a mean prevalence greater than 10% (Fig. 1A), and the preva-
lence of individual types is roughly constant over time (Fig. 1B),
showing coexistence. The rank prevalence of HPV types is also
constant among geographical locations, although absolute preva-
lence is higher in Brazil than in the United States or Mexico (SI
Appendix, Fig. S4).
We analyzed the five HPV types with the highest mean preva-
lence: HPV62, HPV84, HPV89, HPV16, and HPV51. We also
analyzed HPV6, the ninth most prevalent type, because it is
included in the quadrivalent vaccine and is highly associated
with genital warts (1). We accounted for previously identi-

fied risk factors for HPV infection in the HIM Study dataset
(29, 36). The risk factors for any HPV type include mark-
ers of increased exposure to infected sexual partners as well
as nonsexual behaviors, such as tobacco use, and demographic
traits. Several factors, notably circumcision and sexual orienta-
tion, differ in their effects among HPV types (37, 38). Type-
specific differences may reflect meaningful ecological distinc-
tions. We therefore modeled the effects of a diverse set of risk
factors.
Past Infection with HPV Confers Minimal Protection Against Infec-
tion with the Same Type. Our models test three hypotheses about
HPV infection. Under the simplest or “memoryless” model,
infection risk depends only on the effects of host- and HPV
type-specific risk factors (Eq. 1), with no consideration of immu-
nity. Two more complex models account for the effects of previ-
ous infection with the same type (see Materials and Methods for
model details).
Our three models differ only in their assumptions about the
instantaneous per capita infection risk, or “force of infection”
(39), for host i with HPV type j at time t given by λijt.
i) In the memoryless model, the force of infection depends only
on host-specific risk factors and the type-specific baseline
force of infection, λ0j :
λijt = λ0j f (−
→
αj Cit).
[1]
The vector −
→
αj scales the effect of each of the M covariates
on the force of infection, where Cit is the covariate matrix:
f (−
→
αj Cit) = eαj,1C1it + αj,2C2it + αj,3C3it + ... + αj,M CMit . [2]
Each model included five continuous or ordinal covari-
ates and six binary covariates (M = 11 individual-level risk
factors).
ii) In the homologous immunity model, protective immunity
reduces the probability of reinfection (psubsequent) rela-
tive to the probability of an initial infection (pfirst) with
type j:
pfirst = (1t+∆t|0t) =
�
1 − e−λ0j f (−
→
αj Cit)∆t�
,
[3]
psubsequent = pfirst(1 − (1 − d)e−w(t−tclr)).
The strength of immunity d is constrained to fall between
zero and one, so that d reduces the probability of reinfection

over the time interval ∆t. Note that, for d = 1, the homolo-
gous immunity model is identical to the memoryless model.
After the previous infection clears at time tclr, immunity
wanes at rate w.
iii) In the additional risk model, the risk of an initial infection
is determined as in the memoryless model (Eq. 1), but the
risk of reinfection is allowed to be higher. The force of infec-
tion thus includes an additional risk factor, which is distinct
from the host-specific covariate effects (such as the number
of recent sexual partners) and describes only the effect of
previous infection (Eq. 4 and Fig. 2):
λijt = λ0j f (−
→
αj Cit) + Iprevdjci e−wj (t−tclr).
[4]
The additional risk djci depends on the infecting type j and
on the sexual subclass ci of host i. The variable Iprev indicates
whether there was a previous infection with type j.
We included an observation model that determines the prob-
ability of the observed data using the sensitivity and specificity of
the HPV genotyping test. We fitted our models to the data using
a likelihood-based nonlinear fitting routine (SI Appendix) (40).
For model selection, we used the corrected Akaike Information
Criterion (AICc), which balances the better fit of more complex
models against the parsimony of simpler models, while including
a correction for finite sample size (41). The best model has the
smallest AICc value.
We first tested whether infection with an HPV type reduces
the risk of subsequent infection with the same type, allowing for
variation in the degree and duration of protective homologous
immunity [3]. Notably, the homologous immunity model reduced
to the memoryless model for each HPV type (d = 1) (Eq. 3) at
the point estimate of the maximum likelihood. The likelihood of
the homologous immunity model for each type was thus effec-
tively identical to that of memoryless model (SI Appendix, Table
S1). Small discrepancies in the likelihoods in the two models
arise from the Monte Carlo error associated with the use of
simulation-based estimation of the likelihood (SI Appendix). The
additional parameter in the homologous immunity model there-
fore increased model complexity without meaningfully improv-
ing the likelihood, yielding higher AICc scores. There is thus no
evidence for homologous immunity against any of the HPV types
that we studied, suggesting that intratype competition is weak
or absent.
Because separate types are less closely related, competition
between types should be weaker still. Previous work has never-
theless speculated that there may be cross-immunity between
HPV types. In particular, virus-like particles of HPV16 can
induce a low level of neutralizing antibodies against HPV31,
and clinical trial data suggest that current vaccines, which immu-
nize against HPV16, provide partial protection against HPV31
(42, 43). We therefore tested for competition between HPV16
and HPV31 by fitting a model in which previous infection with
HPV31 affects the risk of infection with HPV16 (SI Appendix).
Our estimate of the additional risk of HPV16 infection given pre-
vious HPV31 infection is centered around 1 (1.3; 95% confidence
interval: 0.5, 2.0), suggesting that the two types do not compete.
This lack of an effect may be partly caused by the low prevalence
of HPV31 (Fig. 1) and correspondingly low statistical power, but
the lack of even a trend toward competition nevertheless suggests
that there is no interaction. We therefore conclude that neither
intratype nor intertype competition has strong effects on HPV
dynamics.
Past Infection with HPV Strongly Increases the Risk of Future Infec-
tion with the Same Type. The additional risk model fits the data
vastly better than the homologous immunity and memoryless
models for all six HPV types (SI Appendix, Table S1). Here, we
included individuals who were infected at baseline, but excluding
such individuals yielded the same result (SI Appendix). To deter-
mine whether the additional risk was caused by repeated expo-
sure to the same HPV type by infected sexual partners, we fitted
the magnitude of the additional risk d separately for three sexual
subclasses: celibate individuals, individuals reporting one recent
sexual partner, and individuals reporting multiple recent sexual
partners. We included only people who remained in the same
sexual subclass for at least 3 consecutive years. Celibate indi-
viduals were defined as reporting no recent receptive or inser-
tional anal, vaginal, or oral sex with male or female partners
(SI Appendix). For all six types, previous infection significantly
raises the risk of subsequent homologous infection in each sex-
ual subclass (Fig. 3A). The high additional risk experienced by
celibate individuals (dcelibate) strongly suggests that serial infec-
tions are driven by factors other than sexual transmission. Cru-
cially, our estimate of the additional risk is uncorrelated with
our estimate of baseline infection risk, λ0j (SI Appendix, Fig.
S1), showing that the high estimated additional risk does not
reflect statistical nonidentifiability between additional risk and
baseline risk. Estimates of the additional risk between different
sexual subclasses have the same magnitude (Fig. 3A), showing
that variation in the additional risk across sexual subclasses is
minimal.
To quantify the impact of previous infection, we calculated
the effect of previous infection on the total risk of a subsequent
homologous infection at t = 0, 1, and 3 y after clearing the pre-
vious infection. Even several years after the initial infection is
cleared, the additional risk caused by previous infection accounts
for more than 90% of the force of infection (SI Appendix, Fig.
S3). Moreover, immediately after infection, the 1-y probability of
reinfection with HPV16 (Eq. 5) is, on average, 20.4-fold higher

 than the probability of infection in a naive individual. The aver-
age increase is 19.1- to 20.5-fold among HPV types. Even 3 y after
clearing an infection, the probability of reinfection with HPV16
in the following year remains 13.5-fold higher (7.4- to 20.5-fold
among types).
The strong additional risk independent of sexual subclass is
consistent with two major biological explanations: repeat infec-
tions, presumably caused by autoinoculation between anatom-
ical sites, or episodic reactivation of latent infection. Because
our models account for 11 different risk factors other than
previous infection, it is unlikely that the increased risk is
because of confounding by unmeasured individual-level risk fac-
tors. Completely ruling out unmeasured covariates is impos-
sible without controlled experiments. As an initial test, how-
ever, we repeated our estimation of the additional risk d
using a model that includes additional measured covariates
(17 in total). In this more complex model, the additional risk
d still accounts for more than 90% of the force of infection
after the initial infection, and the model with more covari-
ates did not provide a better fit to the data than the best fit
model with 11 covariates (SI Appendix). This result suggests
that the increased risk is not simply because of unmeasured
individual-level risk factors, while emphasizing the inability of
traditional risk factors to explain the vast majority of HPV
infections.
Modest Differences in Host-Specific Risk Factors Suggest Ecologi-
cal Differences Between HPV Types and Highlight High-Risk Sub-
populations. Although the additional risk conferred by past infec-
tion is substantial, a model without host-specific risk factors fits
the data far worse than the full additional risk model (Eq. 4) for
all types (SI Appendix). Moreover, the effects of the host-specific
risk factors vary among HPV types. To understand this variation,
we inserted our estimates of the baseline force of infection and
the covariate effects for each HPV type into the best fit model
to calculate the distribution of infection risk in individuals who
have never been infected. The expected time to infection (1/λijt),
a measure of risk, is generally low but varies by orders of mag-
nitude among individuals in the naive population (SI Appendix,
Fig. S2). Thus, the risk of initial infection with any type is con-
centrated in a few high-risk individuals. This feature captures
a major pattern in the data. Under the additional risk model,
the population prevalence of an HPV type arises from repeated
infections in relatively few individuals. In the memoryless model,
by contrast, the initial infection risk is higher, previous infec-
tion has no effect on subsequent risk, and prevalence arises from
fewer infections in more individuals. Simulations from the max-
imum likelihood estimates of the two models show that both
reproduce the population-level prevalence in the data across
visits (SI Appendix, Fig. S9). However, only the additional risk
model accurately predicts the fraction of individuals who ever
experience infection, which the memoryless model overestimates
(Fig. 3B). Unmeasured assortative mixing (44) and simultane-
ous exposure to multiple HPV types through sexual partnerships
(45) can confound associations between HPV incidence and past
exposures. Residual confounding may be a problem, because the
initial infection risk is low and sensitive to host-specific risk fac-
tors. However, such confounding would be minimized in celi-
bate individuals. We, therefore, reestimated the magnitude of
the additional risk dcelibate by fitting the additional risk model
(Eq. 4) to data from celibate individuals only. In the celibates-
only analysis, the risk conferred by previous infection was still
high (SI Appendix) and consistent with our previous estimates.
The high additional risk inferred for the celibate individuals and
the consistency of the additional risk for all three sexual sub-
classes suggest that the additional risk reflects autoinoculation
or reactivation rather than confounding from unmeasured sex-
ual activity.
The effects of each covariate also show interesting similari-
ties and differences between types (Fig. 4). Having more recent
female partners strongly increases risk for all HPV types, empha-
sizing the importance of heterosexual transmission. The addi-
tion of a single female sexual partner raises instantaneous infec-
tion risk by 80–120% among types compared with the risk
in individuals with no recent female partners. The number of
male partners, however, has divergent effects. The addition of
a single male sexual partner reduces instantaneous risk with
HPV16 by 50% but increases the risk of infection with types
HPV84 and HPV89 by 20 and 70%, respectively. Most other
covariates were significant for only some types, indicating sub-
tle differences between types. Our results are largely consis-
tent with previous findings, with differences likely arising from
the greater statistical power of our inference technique (SI
Appendix).
Discussion
Understanding the dynamics of HPV transmission is crucial to
explain the coexistence of over 200 low-prevalence HPV types
and to accurately predict the impact of multivalent HPV vac-
cines. Our results show little evidence of competition within
and between HPV types, and instead, they show high rates of
reinfection or persistence by the same type. The inferred lack
of both homologous and heterologous immunity implies that
HPV-type diversity cannot be explained by negative frequency-
dependent selection, which promotes the coexistence of other
immunologically distinct pathogen strains. Our results instead
suggest that high HPV prevalence results from continuous
or repeated infection with multiple, apparently independent
virus types. Types differ slightly in their risk factors, suggest-
ing that ecological niche partitioning could further promote
coexistence.
Our results add to growing evidence that HPV infection, in
contrast to vaccination, does not confer protective homologous
immunity in men. Although we allowed the strength and dura-
tion of immunity to vary after initial infection, we could not
detect any protection against reinfection with the same type.
Because sterilizing immunity reduces infection rates, models that
assume that infection induces protective immunity in men (33–
35, 46) likely underestimate vaccine effectiveness.
Our conclusion that there is no homologous immunity in men
supports the hypothesis that genital infection differs between
men and women. Although the durations and distributions of
types in genital HPV infection are similar in men and women

 POPULATION
BIOLOGY
(1, 3), the prevalence of genital HPV is higher in men (3).
Acquired immunity has been proposed to explain declining cer-
vical HPV prevalence by age in women in some countries (47,
48), whereas HPV prevalence does not change with age in men
(3, 36). Furthermore, the seroprevalence of some types is higher
in women than in men from the same source population (49),
although homologous protection in women is still likely to be
weak (20).
The high risk of recurring infection is consistent with either
autoinoculation across anatomic sites or episodic reactivation of
latent infection. Studies showing type-concordant HPV infection
across anatomic sites support the importance of autoinoculation.
First, HPV DNA has been detected on the fingers of patients
with genital warts (50), suggesting transmission between the
hands and the genitals. Second, an analysis of a subcohort of the
HIM Study showed a 1.5- to 15-fold increase in the risk of anal
HPV infection after genital infection (38), and a similar analy-
sis of women found a 20-fold increase in the risk of recurrent
anal HPV infection given infection at the cervix (51). Moreover,
63% of the cases of recurrent anal HPV occurred without a self-
reported history of anal sex (51). Significantly, the magnitude of
the effect in these studies is consistent with our estimate that pre-
vious infection yields a 20-fold increase in the risk of subsequent
infection.
Apparent reinfection could instead be caused by the reacti-
vation of latent virus. Whether HPV persists latently remains
unknown (17, 52), but an animal model of cottontail oral papil-
lomavirus provides evidence of a latent reservoir (53). Fur-
thermore, sexually inactive HIV-positive women have a higher
risk of recurrent HPV infection compared with HIV-negative
controls (54), and among HIV-positive females, higher CD4+
T-cell counts are negatively correlated with recurrent infection
risk (55). The latter two studies have been interpreted as evi-
dence of reactivation of latent infection (52), but either effect
may instead result from increases in susceptibility to autoinocu-
lation. Furthermore, the studies in HIV-positive women suggest
that reactivation requires immune suppression and may there-
fore be rare in healthy individuals.
Vaccine efficacy trials suggest that reinfection is more com-
mon than reactivation. Women with previous HPV-related dis-
ease who received the quadrivalent vaccine were protected
against HPV-related lesions (56). Similarly, one study showed
100% efficacy of the HPV vaccine against HPV-related dis-
ease in individuals with serological evidence of past HPV6,
-11, -16, or -18 infection (57). HPV vaccines prevent infec-
tion by inducing antibodies that block viral entry, and such
antibodies would likely not prevent reactivation. If indeed vac-
cines do not affect the disease course of reactivated infec-
tions, then these trials suggest that the vaccine diminishes the
incidence of HPV lesions by blocking true reinfection. Vacci-
nating children before sexual debut clearly reduces infection
rates (4), but if vaccination prevents autoinoculation, then vac-
cinating previously infected individuals may also reduce HPV
prevalence.
The type-specific effects of demographic and behavioral risk
factors that we observed suggest that modest differences exist
in the host subpopulations supporting each HPV type. For all
types, the major determinant of infection risk is the number of
recent female sex partners, suggesting a central role for het-
erosexual transmission. Additionally, current smoking increases
risk in most types, consistent with other studies (3, 29). Smok-
ing can suppress mucosal and cellular immunity (58), but its
effects may be confounded with other high-risk behaviors that
were not documented in the HIM Study. Although shared risk
factors account for most of the initial infection risk for each
type, there are important distinctions too. For instance, cir-
cumcision has a type-specific effect on the risk of HPV infec-
tion. Randomized, controlled trials of male circumcision have
shown that circumcision protects against any HPV infection
(59), whereas observational studies have documented either no
effect or increased risk (3, 29). These conflicting results may
have arisen from differences between types, potentially reflect-
ing adaptation to different epithelial environments in the male
genital tract.
Our modeling approach has several limitations: notably, that
we cannot distinguish between reactivation and autoinocula-
tion and that unmeasured covariates could have affected our
results. While we identified celibate individuals based on detailed
self-reporting on anal, vaginal, and oral sex, celibacy did not
account for all forms of nonpenetrative sexual contact, such as
kissing and masturbation. The construction of covariates from
risk factor data, a necessary feature of any quantitative study of
individual-level risk factors, may have led to bias (SI Appendix),
and we cannot completely rule out the possibility that unob-
served properties of the sexual contact network affected our
results. In addition, our model of homologous immunity assumes
that protection arises immediately after infection, but protection
may be lagged (32). The poor fit of the homologous immunity
model nevertheless suggests that any such effects are weak, but
future investigations should allow for more complex forms of
homologous immunity. We lack information on genetic differ-
ences in host susceptibility and on HPV exposure or changes
in risk factors that occurred before the study. For example, we
would have little power to detect immunity if a large portion of
individuals developed sterilizing immunity before entering the
study. Finally, the data track genital HPV infection, ignoring
other sites.
These caveats notwithstanding, the strong effect of initial
infection on subsequent infection risk that we inferred is impor-
tant for the design of epidemiological studies and models to
inform public health policy. Our results imply that the HPV vac-
cine has the potential to lower HPV prevalence far more than
previously expected.
Materials and Methods
Data. The HIM Study is a multinational cohort study of HPV infection
in unvaccinated men ages 18–70 y old. The study enrolled 4,123 partici-
pants between 2005 and 2009 and tracked men longitudinally over 5 y.
Men were recruited from three cities: Tampa, Florida; Cuernavaca, Mex-
ico; and Sao Paulo, Brazil. Detailed study methods are described elsewhere
(36). The human subjects committees of the University of South Florida,
Tampa, Florida; Centro de Referˆ
encia e Treinamento em Doenc
¸as Sexual-
mente Transmiss´
ıveis e AIDS, Sao Paulo, Brazil; and Instituto Nacional de
Salud P ´
ublica de M´
exico, Cuernavaca, Mexico approved all HIM Study pro-
cedures. All participants provided written informed consent. The data for
each individual consist of binary time series of infection status with each
HPV type for up to 10 clinic visits (median = 10 visits). More information is in
SI Appendix.
Model of HPV Dynamics. Our models are two-state discrete time partially
observed Markov processes, in which an individual is either infected (one)
or uninfected (zero) at any time with an HPV type. Infection of individual i
with HPV type j occurs at rate λijt, such that the probability of infection over
∆t is
p(1t+∆t|0t) = 1 − e−λijt∆t.
[5]
Because we cannot directly observe infection events, the measurement
model relates each observation Yijt to the latent state Xijt:
Yijt ∼ Bernoulli(Xijt(1 − PFP) + (1 − Xijt)PFN),
[6]
where PFP and PFN are the rates of false positives and false negatives, respec-
tively. The duration of infection was drawn from a gamma distribution,
where the shape (kj) and scale (θj) were fixed to match the empirical dis-
tribution of infection durations in the data for type j (SI Appendix, Fig. S8
and Table S7).
