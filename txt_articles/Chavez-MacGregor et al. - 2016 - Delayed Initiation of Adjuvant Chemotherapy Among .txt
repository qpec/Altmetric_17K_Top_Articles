Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Adjuvant chemotherapy improves outcomes of patients with breast cancer. 
However, the optimal timing of chemotherapy initiation is unknown. Delayed administration can 
decrease the benefit of cytotoxic systemic therapies.
OBJECTIVE—To identify the determinants in delayed chemotherapy initiation and to determine 
the relationship between time to chemotherapy (TTC) and outcome according to breast cancer 
subtype. We hypothesized that prolonged TTC would be associated with adverse outcomes.

 DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—In an observational, population-based 
investigation using data from the California Cancer Registry, we studied a total of 24 843 patients 
with stage I to III invasive breast cancer diagnosed between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 
2010, and treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Data analysis was performed between August 2014 
and August 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Time to chemotherapy was defined as the number of 
days between surgery and the first dose of chemotherapy, and delayed TTC was defined as 91 or 
more days from surgery to the first dose of adjuvant chemotherapy. We evaluated overall survival 
and breast cancer–specific survival. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were 
used.
RESULTS—In all, 24 843 patients were included. Median age at diagnosis was 53 years, and 
median was TTC was 46 days. Factors associated with delays in TTC included low socioeconomic 
status, breast reconstruction, nonprivate insurance, and Hispanic ethnicity or non-Hispanic black 
race. Compared with patients receiving chemotherapy within 31 days from surgery, there was no 
evidence of adverse outcomes among those with TTC of 31 to 60 or 60 to 90 days. Patients treated 
91 or more days from surgery experienced worse overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.34; 95% 
CI, 1.15-1.57) and worse breast cancer–specific survival (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.05-1.53). In a 
subgroup analysis according to subtype, longer TTC caused patients with triple-negative breast 
cancer to have worse overall survival (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.17-2.00) and worse breast cancer–
specific survival (HR, 1.53; 95% CI 1.17-2.07).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—For patients with breast cancer, adverse outcomes are 
associated with delaying initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy 91 or more days. Delayed TTC was 
particularly detrimental among patients with triple-negative breast cancer. The determinants of 
delays in chemotherapy initiation appeared to be sociodemographic, and clinicians should provide 
timelier care to all patients.
In 2015, an estimated 231 840 cases of invasive breast cancer were diagnosed in the United 
States.1 Improvements in breast cancer treatment and early detection have resulted in a 
decrease in the mortality rates of patients with breast cancer in the last decades. Among 
patients with early-stage breast cancer, the use of adjuvant chemotherapy has had a dramatic 
effect decreasing the risk of recurrence and improving survival rates.2
Most patients with breast cancer start adjuvant chemotherapy within 30 to 40 days of 
surgery. It is thought that chemotherapy administration delayed beyond this time can 
decrease the benefit provided by cytotoxic systemic therapies. Possible explanations for 
these effects include accelerated growth of micrometastases after resection of the primary 
tumor, increased tumor angiogenesis, or development of primary resistance.3-6 The optimal 
time of chemotherapy administration for patients with breast cancer is not precisely defined. 
Furthermore, it is possible that the time to chemotherapy (TTC) has a different effect 
according to tumor subtype, tumor stage, and tumor grade.7,8 Administration of combination 
systemic chemotherapy within 120 days of diagnosis in women younger than 70 years with 
T1cN0M0 or stage II or III hormone receptor–negative breast cancer is considered a quality 
metric by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. This metric will now be reported

Reporting Program.9
The effect of delayed TTC administration has been evaluated retrospectively with 
contradictory results.10-18 In a recent study, we reported that a delay of 61 or more days of 
adjuvant chemotherapy administration was associated with adverse outcomes among 
patients with stage II and III breast cancer and also among patients with triple-negative and 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ERBB2, formerly HER2 or HER2/neu)-positive 
tumors.14 Our findings suggest that among these specific patient subgroups, every effort 
should be made to avoid delayed adjuvant chemotherapy initiation.
To provide data that is more generalizable and to clarify this important clinical problem, we 
evaluated whether TTC is associated with survival in a large population-based study using 
the California Cancer Registry (CCR) database. In addition, we evaluated the determinants 
of delayed chemotherapy administration.
Methods
Study Population and Variables
We used data from the CCR, a population-based registry that has been collecting 
information on all cancer cases in California since 1988. Breast cancer case ascertainment is 
99% complete.19 The CCR started collecting data on hormone receptor status (both estrogen 
receptor [ER] and progesterone receptor [PR]) in 1990 and began collecting information on 
ERBB2 status in 1999. However, information on ERBB2 breast cancer status did not 
become consistently available until 2005.20,21 The Cancer Prevention Institute of California 
institutional review board oversaw the study, and the University of Texas MD Anderson 
Cancer Center institutional review board considered the study exempt under Category 4 of 
the Code of Federal Regulations.
We identified 41 194 patients with stage I to III primary breast cancer diagnosed between 
January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2010, who underwent surgery and were treated with 
chemotherapy. Patients with inflammatory breast cancer, unknown tumor size or surgery 
type, or incomplete or unknown chemotherapy or surgery dates, were excluded (n = 9843). 
Patients with incomplete treatment dates (n = 9048) were more likely to be diagnosed in 
earlier years, have more advanced cancer, and have Medicare and/or Medicaid coverage (P 
< .001 for all cases). Patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n = 4046) were also 
excluded. The final study cohort included 24 843 patients, and data analysis was performed 
between August 2014 and August 2015.
Patient information, including demographic characteristics and variables related to the 
cancer diagnosis and treatment, were abstracted from medical records by tumor registrars as 
part of routine registry procedures. From the CCR, we obtained the following patient 
characteristics: date of diagnosis, age, marital status, insurance type (private, Medicaid, 
Medicare, military, not insured or self-pay, unknown), race (non-Hispanic whites, non-
Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, Asian or Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic American Indian, other, 
or unknown), type of breast surgery (mastectomy or breast conserving), whether

 reconstructive surgery was performed, and whether the patient received radiation therapy. 
We also obtained data on tumor ER, PR, and ERBB2 status, and we categorized patients into 
subgroups according to breast cancer subtype. The hormone receptor–positive subgroup was 
characterized by ER-positive (ER+) and/or PR-positive (PR+) and ERBB2-negative 
(ERBB2−) breast cancer; ERBB2-positive (ERBB2+) breast cancer was characterized by the 
presence of ERBB2 regardless of ER or PR status; and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) 
was characterized as ER–negative (ER−), PR– negative (PR−), and ERBB2−. To ascertain 
socioeconomic status (SES), residential addresses at the time of diagnosis were geocoded to 
correspond with census block groups. For cases diagnosed in 2005, we used a measure of 
neighborhood-level SES incorporating block group level data from the 2000 Census 
reporting income, education, housing costs, and occupation.22 For cases diagnosed from 
2006 to 2010, we used data from the 2007 to 2011 American Community Survey of the US 
Census to derive a similar SES index.23 We identified patients seen at NCI-designated 
cancer centers.24
Statistical Analysis
Patients were categorized according to TTC categories, and this variable was calculated 
from the date of definitive surgery to the date that the first dose of adjuvant chemotherapy 
was administered. Patients TTC categories were 30 days or less, 31 to 60 days, 61 to 90 
days, or 91 or more days, and delay in chemotherapy administration was defined as 91 or 
more days. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the characteristics of the patient 
population according to TTC, and the distribution was compared using χ2 test. A 
multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with delay in 
chemotherapy administration. Variables in the multivariable model were selected a priori 
and included age, sex, race/ethnicity, year of diagnosis, SES, breast cancer stage, breast 
cancer subtype, marital status, type of breast surgery, whether reconstructive surgery was 
performed, primary payer, and whether the patient was treated at a NCI–designated cancer 
center.
Follow-up was calculated using the reverse censored Kaplan-Meier method. Survival time 
was calculated in days from the date of breast cancer diagnosis to the date of last contact. 
The CCR regularly updates vital patient status information and active hospital follow-ups 
through linkages with state and national databases. Patients who were known to be alive at 
the study cutoff date of December 31, 2012, were censored on that date. For BCSS, 
deceased patients whose underlying cause of death was not breast cancer were censored at 
time of death. Univariate survival analyses according to TTC were performed using the 
Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test was used to compare differences between 
groups. Using a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model, we examined the effect of 
TTC as a continuous (in weeks) and as a categorical variable for OS and BCSS. The 
proportional hazards assumption was assessed using Schoenfeld residuals and also by 
examining log-log plots. Breast cancer subtype violated the proportional hazards 
assumption. Therefore, the models were stratified according to the breast cancer subtype 
variable. Results are expressed in hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs. The following variables 
were included in the final model: TTC, age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, SES, stage,

 primary payer; type of surgery, breast reconstruction, and whether the patient was treated at 
a NCI-designated cancer center.
Statistical analyses were performed with deidentified data from the CCR using SAS version 
9.3 software (SAS Institute Inc). All tests were 2-sided, and P ≤ .05 was considered 
statistically significant.
Results
Among the 24 843 patients included in our study, the median age at diagnosis was 53 years, 
and the median TTC was 46 days. A total of 5224 (21.0%) patients started chemotherapy 
within fewer than 31 days; 12 432 (50.0%) between 31 and 60 days; 4765 (19.2%) between 
61 and 90 days; and 2422 (9.8%) started chemotherapy 91 or more days after surgery. 
Patient characteristics according to TTC are presented in eTable 1 in the Supplement. When 
evaluating the factors associated with a delay in adjuvant chemotherapy administration with 
a multivariable model, we observed that compared with either stage I patients, those with 
stage II and III were less likely to have delays in chemotherapy administration (odds ratio 
[OR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.63-0.76, and OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.52-0.67, respectively). Patients 
with TNBC were also less likely to have delays (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.63-0.81) compared 
with patients with hormone-receptor positive tumors. On the other hand, age, reconstructive 
surgery, and sociodemographic factors were associated with longer TTC. Compared with 
non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics were significantly more likely to 
receive chemotherapy 91 or more days after surgery (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.19-1.60, and OR, 
1.15; 95% CI, 1.03-1.29, respectively). A similar phenomenon was observed for SES. 
Compared with the highest quintile, those in the lowest quintile were more likely to receive 
delayed chemotherapy (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.21-1.62). The complete multivariable model for 
the determinants of delay in TTC is shown in Table 1.
Median follow-up was 62.7 months. Survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method for 
OS according to TTC demonstrated that patients who received chemotherapy 91 or more 
days after surgery had worse OS (P < .001). In the analysis according to tumor subtype, we 
observed that among patients with hormone-receptor positive tumors (P = .002) and TNBC 
(P<.001) those treated with chemotherapy 91 or more days had worse OS. The same 
phenomenon was not observed among patients with ERBB2+ tumors (P = .18) (eFigure in 
the Supplement). Similar results were seen when evaluating BCSS (data not shown).
The multivariable analyses for OS and BCSS are shown in Table 2. After adjusting for 
important confounders, we observed that a 7-day delay in initiation of adjuvant 
chemotherapy increased the risk of death by 1% (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.01). Using a 
reference of TTC less than 31 days from surgery in the analysis, we observed that receiving 
treatment between 31 and 60 days or 61 and 90 days was not associated with worse OS. 
However, patients in the category of 91 or more days had a 34% increase in the risk of death 
(HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.15-1.57). Other factors associated with worse OS included older age, 
advanced stage breast cancer, non-Hispanic black ethnicity, and lower SES. Compared with 
patients with private insurance, those with Medicare and Medicaid coverage had worse OS. 
Patients treated at NCI-designated cancer centers had improved OS. In the analysis

 according to BCSS, we observed similar findings. While TTC 31 to 60 and 60 to 90 days 
was not associated with adverse outcomes, patients with TTC 91 or more days had a 27% 
increase in the risk of breast cancer death (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.05-1.53). The factors 
associated with worse BCSS included older age, advanced stage breast cancer, non-Hispanic 
black ethnicity, and lower SES. In a stratified model including a term for radiation therapy, 
we observed similar results (data not shown), and inclusion of contralateral breast cancer in 
the model did not change our results (data not shown).
We evaluated whether TTC had a different effect according to breast cancer subtype and 
observed that TTC 91 or more days was associated with worse OS among patients with 
TNBC (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.17-2.00) but had no significant effect among those with 
hormone receptor–positive (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.98-1.59) or ERBB2+ (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 
0.93-1.75) tumors. The effect of SES in OS was much stronger among patients with 
hormone receptor–positive and ERBB2+ tumors and patients with Medicaid had worse OS 
in these 2 tumor subtypes (Table 3).
Similar results were seen when evaluating BCSS (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Time to 
chemotherapy 91 or more days was associated with an increased risk in breast cancer death 
among patients with TNBC (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.17-2.07) but had no significant effect 
among patients with hormone receptor– positive (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.92-1.66) or ERBB2+ 
(HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.68-1.53) tumors. The effect of SES on outcome was statistically 
significant among patients with hormone receptor-positive and ERBB2+ tumors.
Discussion
In this large, population-based study, we observed that a delay in initiation of adjuvant 
chemotherapy of 91 or more days after surgery was associated with worse OS and BCSS 
among patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, our study suggests that the adverse 
outcomes associated with delays in TTC are particularly important among patients with 
TNBC.
The optimal time to start adjuvant chemotherapy remains a topic of fundamental clinical 
importance. Given the nature of the question, clinical trials addressing this issue will not be 
undertaken since they will be considered to be unfeasible and unethical. Reports are 
conflicting since some studies have found no relationship between TTC and outcome.11,15,25 
However, these studies11,15,25 were small, reported on single-institution data, and do not 
reflect contemporary breast cancer systemic management.
The notion that a delay in adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with adverse outcomes is 
supported by preclinical data that identified a phase of accelerated growth of the microscopic 
residual disease after initial surgical resection and by mathematical models demonstrating 
the development of chemotherapy resistance.3-6,8 In this study, we observed that delays in 
TTC 91 or more days are associated with poorer outcomes. Our results are consistent with 
previous reports, including 2 large meta-analyses. Yu et al26 identified 34 097 patients from 
7 different studies and observed that OS decreased by 15% for every additional 4-week 
delay in initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.03-1.28). Applying these

 results, a 12-week delay in TTC would be associated with an approximately 30% increase in 
the risk of death, which is consistent with the 34% increased risk that we observed in our 
study for patients with TTC 91 or more days. In the second meta-analysis, Biagi et al10 
evaluated TTC as a continuous variable among 15 327 breast cancer patients. They observed 
that each 4-week increase in TTC was associated with a 6% increase in the risk of all-cause 
mortality, similar to the 4% increase in mortality for every 4-week delay observed in our 
analysis using TTC as a continuous variable.
The optimal time to initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy has been evaluated using clinical 
trial data. No survival differences were observed among participants of Danish Breast 
Cancer Cooperative group trials.12 Given the nature of the study, the authors were not able to 
evaluate the effect of delays beyond 90 days, since 98% of the patients started adjuvant 
chemotherapy within 3 months after surgery. In an analysis including 1788 premenopausal 
patients participating in the IBIS (International Breast Cancer Intervention Study) I, II, and 
VI trials, a differential effect in TTC according to tumor subtype was observed but adverse 
outcomes owing to a delay in TTC were only observed among patients with ER− tumors.13 
In our study, an analysis according to tumor subtype suggests that the effect of delays in 
TTC is of particular relevance among patients with TNBC. This is not surprising considering 
the rapid proliferation rate of these tumors. Also, the proportional benefit provided by 
chemotherapy among high-grade tumors with an aggressive biology is expected to be 
greater.27-29 Our group recently reported a large single-institution study14 including 6827 
patients, and in this selected patient population, TTC 61 or more days after surgery was 
associated with adverse outcomes, particularly among patients with TNBC and those with 
ERBB2+ tumors that received trastuzumab-based therapy. In the present study, we did not 
observe a statistically significant detrimental effect in OS or BCSS among patients with 
ERBB2+ tumors with TTC 91 or more days; however, the direction of the estimate was 
parallel with those with TNBC. It is possible that the lack of statistical significance was the 
product of the small number of patients in the ERBB2+ category or to the heterogeneous use 
of trastuzumab-based therapy in our cohort.
Other population-based studies have addressed the topic of TTC postsurgery with results 
that are consistent with our findings. Data from British Columbia16 including 2594 patients 
with stage I and II breast cancer suggests that OS and relapse-free survival are compromised 
when adjuvant chemotherapy is administered more than 12 weeks after surgery. In a large 
study including 14 380 breast cancer SEER-Medicare participants (data collected 
1992-2005), Nurgalieva et al28 observed that patients with TTC greater than 90 days had a 
statistically significant increase in overall risk of death (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.32-1.80) and 
breast cancer-specific death (HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.31-2.47) compared with patients treated 
within a month of surgery. In this study, African American or Hispanic race/ethnicity was a 
significant factor associated with delays in TTC. Hershman et al30 evaluated 5003 patients 
using the same SEER-Medicare database and reported that a delay in TTC greater than 90 
days in patients older than 65 years was associated with worse OS (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 
1.21-1.75) and BCSS (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.31-2.19). The study by Hershman et al also 
identified that delays in TTC were associated with increased age, rural location residence, 
being unmarried, earlier-stage breast cancer, hormone receptor-positive tumors, and patients 
undergoing mastectomy.

 Our study is unique and adds to the available literature. We report results from a large, 
population-based cohort that reflects general practice patterns, allowing generalization of 
our results. Given the recent years of inclusion, the patients in our cohort were treated with 
contemporary systemic regimens, and we were able to perform subgroup analysis according 
to breast cancer subtype.
In addition to evaluating the relationship between TTC and corresponding outcomes, we 
were also able to identify that the main determinants of delaying TTC are sociodemographic 
in nature. Similar to what others have described,17,30-36 we observed that Hispanics, non-
Hispanic blacks, unmarried patients, patients with low SES, patients with Medicare, 
Medicaid, or military insurance, and patients who are not insured or are self-paid are more 
likely to experience delayed initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy. On the other hand, patients 
with TNBC and those with stage II or III breast cancer were less likely to have delays in 
treatment, probably because such characteristics are associated with poor prognosis. In the 
analysis according to breast cancer subtype, payment coverage method and SES were 
significantly associated with OS and BCSS among patients with hormone receptor-positive 
and ERBB2+ tumors. This finding is likely associated with the financial burden from health 
care costs and that the treatment duration is longer among these patients. It has been 
demonstrated that the out-of-pocket cost of adjuvant endocrine therapy is associated with 
treatment adherence and compliance, therefore affecting outcomes.37-39 Unfortunately, in 
the CCR data on type, duration, or adherence to endocrine therapy is not available, and we 
could not include this important confounder in our analyses.
Our study is limited by its retrospective nature. However, that we are aware of, this study is 
the largest published cohort of patients with breast cancer of known breast cancer subtype 
treated with contemporary regimens. We acknowledge that in clinical practice a number of 
factors determine the optimal TTC, and that in many cases, this time frame is determined by 
comorbidities or complications associated with surgery.40 Unfortunately, data concerning 
comorbidities and complications with surgery are not available in the CCR database, and we 
cannot exclude that the factors associated with delays in chemotherapy administration are 
not also related to worse outcomes. However, the fact that we observed consistent results in 
our OS and BCSS risk estimates makes this scenario unlikely. In addition, we acknowledge 
that the potential determinants of chemotherapy initiation include the recommendation of the 
medical oncologist and the entire multidisciplinary team. Additionally, from the patient-
centered care perspective, a patient’s preferences are likely to play a role, which we were 
unable to take into account.
Conclusions
In our cohort, the median time between diagnosis and surgery was 26 days. We observed 
adverse outcomes among patients with TTC 91 or more days. Our findings support the 
notion that TTC should be used as a quality measure as has been proposed recently by the 
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Given the results of our analysis, we would 
suggest that all breast cancer patients that are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy should 
receive this treatment within 91 days of surgery or 120 days from diagnosis. Administration 
of chemotherapy within this time frame is feasible in clinical practice under most clinical

 scenarios, and as medical oncologists, we should make every effort not to delay the initiation 
of adjuvant chemotherapy. Furthermore, determinants of delay in TTC were 
sociodemographic in nature; better understanding and removing barriers to access of care in 
vulnerable populations should be a priority.

 At a Glance
•
The relationship between time to chemotherapy (TTC) and outcomes for 
subgroups of patients with breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy 
were determined, as well as the determinants in delayed chemotherapy 
initiation.
•
Compared with patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy within 31 days of 
surgery, there was no evidence of adverse outcomes among patients who 
received chemotherapy 31 to 90 days after surgery.
•
Patients treated 91 or more days from surgery experienced worse overall 
survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.34; 95%CI, 1.15-1.57) and worse breast 
cancer–specific survival (HR, 1.27; 95%CI, 1.05-1.53).
•
Among patients with triple-negative breast cancer, longer TTC had a 
significant effect on overall survival (HR, 1.53; 95%CI, 1.17-2.00) and breast 
cancer–specific survival (HR, 1.53; 95%CI, 1.17-2.07).
•
Factors associated with delays in TTC included low socioeconomic status, 
breast reconstruction, nonprivate insurance, and Hispanic ethnicity or non-
Hispanic black race.
