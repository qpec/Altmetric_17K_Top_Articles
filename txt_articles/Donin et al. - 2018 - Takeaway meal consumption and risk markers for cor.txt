Objective To investigate associations between 
takeaway meal consumption and risk markers for 
coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity risk 
markers in children.
Design A cross-sectional, school-based observational 
study.
setting 85 primary schools across London, Birmingham 
and Leicester.
Participants 1948 UK primary school children in year 
5, aged 9–10 years.
Main outcome measures Children reported their 
frequency of takeaway meal consumption, completed a 
24-hour dietary recall, had physical measurements and 
provided a fasting blood sample.
results Among 1948 participants with complete data, 
499 (26%) never/hardly ever consumed a takeaway 
meal, 894 (46%) did so <1/week and 555 (28%) did 
≥1/week. In models adjusted for age, sex, month, school, 
ethnicity and socioeconomic status, more frequent 
takeaway meal consumption was associated with higher 
dietary intakes of energy, fat % energy and saturated fat 
% energy and higher energy density (all P trend <0.001) 
and lower starch, protein and micronutrient intakes (all 
P trend <0.05). A higher frequency of takeaway meal 
consumption was associated with higher serum total 
cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 
(P trend=0.04, 0.01, respectively); children eating a 
takeaway meal ≥1/week had total cholesterol and LDL 
cholesterol 0.09 mmol/L (95% CI 0.01 to 0.18) and 
0.10 mmol/L (95% CI 0.02 to 0.18) higher respectively 
than children never/hardly ever eating a takeaway meal; 
their fat mass index was also higher.
Conclusions More frequent takeaway meal 
consumption in children was associated with unhealthy 
dietary nutrient intake patterns and potentially with 
adverse longer term consequences for obesity and 
coronary heart disease risk.
InTrODuCTIOn
Previous studies in adults have reported that 
increased consumption of takeaway food is asso-
ciated with increased body fatness,1–3 insulin resis-
tance,4 type 2 diabetes5 and coronary heart disease 
(CHD)6; an association between takeaway meal 
consumption and obesity has also been reported in 
adolescents.7 Both adults and children who regu-
larly eat takeaway food have poorer diet quality, 
higher total fat intakes and lower intakes of fruit 
and vegetables.8–10 
In the UK, consumption of takeaway meals has 
increased. Between 1996 and 2006, the frequency 
of consumption has increased by more than a 
quarter, despite concerns about the high fat, sugar 
and salt content of many of these foods.11 A recent 
study in the UK reported that more than half of 
11–14 
year olds reported purchasing food from fast 
food outlets twice or more a week.12 The increasing 
consumption of takeaway meals is a particular 
concern in the context of high rates of childhood 
obesity13 and the early emergence of type 2 diabetes 
risks in children.14 However, the associations 
between frequency of takeaway meal consumption 
and risk markers for coronary heart disease and 
type 2 diabetes have been little studied in children.
We have therefore investigated the associations 
between frequency of takeaway meal consump-
tion and risk markers for coronary heart disease, 
type 2 diabetes and obesity in a large multiethnic 
population of children. Using data from 24-hour 
dietary recalls, we have also examined the associa-
tions between reported frequency of takeaway meal 
consumption and nutrient intakes over a 24-hour 
period, and the nutrient content of the previous 
evening meal in relation to its source (prepared at 
home or obtained from a takeaway restaurant).
What is already known?
 
► Observational evidence suggests that adults 
who regularly eat takeaway meals have poorer 
diet quality, increased adiposity, type 2 diabetes 
and coronary heart disease.
 
► In the UK, takeaway meal consumption is 
increasing. However, little is known about 
the associations between takeaway meal 
consumption and chronic disease risk markers 
in children.
What this study adds?
 
► Our study suggests that children who regularly 
eat takeaway meals have adverse lipid profiles, 
higher body fat and poorer diet quality.
 
► Efforts to reduce takeaway meal consumption in 
children could have both short-term and long-
term health benefits.

Participants
This investigation was based on the Child Heart And health Study 
in England (CHASE),15 which examined markers of cardiovas-
cular disease and type 2 diabetes risk and their determinants in 
a multiethnic population of children aged 9–10 years. Parents 
or guardians provided informed written consent. Balanced 
numbers of children of South Asian, black African-Caribbean 
and white Europeans origin were invited to take part from a 
stratified random sample of 200 primary schools in London, 
Birmingham and Leicester. This investigation is based on the last 
85 schools (visited between February 2006 and February 2007), 
in which detailed information on eating patterns and dietary 
nutrient intakes were collected (described in detail elsewhere16).
Dietary assessment
Participants were asked about their eating patterns, including a 
question ‘how often do you have a meal from a takeaway restau-
rant?’ with four response options—never or hardly ever,<1/week, 
1/week and >1/week. The interviewer made it clear that this 
only included meals from takeaway outlets and not convenience 
stores or supermarkets and included foods such as ‘burgers, fish 
and chips, Chinese, pizza and so on’ and not just drinks or snacks 
such as ‘crisps or fizzy drinks’. Because only a small number of 
children reported consuming a takeaway meal >1/week (n=129, 
7% of the sample), the top two categories were combined for 
analysis. Dietary intake was assessed using a single, structured 
24-hour recall including elements of the United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture multiple pass method.17 Memory cues were 
used to aid recall, such as orientating the child on details of the 
previous day, and checking for any forgotten snacks or drinks 
that the child may have had through the day. Photographs of 
common foods were used to help the child estimate portion 
sizes. The children were also asked to report the source of each 
meal (eg, home, school, takeaway or ‘eat in’ restaurant). Energy 
and nutrient intakes were calculated by the Medical Research 
Council Human Nutrition Research centre (MRC-HNR) using 
an in-house food composition database.18 Energy density was 
calculated by dividing the reported total energy intake from food 
(kJ) by the total weight of food reported (g).19
Physical measurements and blood sampling
Participating children had measurements of height (using a 
portable stadiometer, CMS Instruments, London, UK), weight 
(Tanita, Tokyo, Japan), waist circumference, multiple skin-
fold thicknesses and bioelectrical impedance, measured with a 
Bodystat 1500 body composition analyser (Bodystat Ltd, Isle 
of Man, UK). Bioelectrical impedance was used as the prin-
cipal marker of body fat as it provides valid assessments in this 
ethnically diverse population.20 Fat-free mass was derived using 
validated equations, and fat mass index was calculated (kg/
m5), which is independent of height.21 Seated blood pressure 
was measured twice in the right arm after a 5 
min rest using an 
Omron 907 blood pressure recorder, with an appropriately sized 
cuff. Children provided fasting blood samples after an overnight 
fast for the measurement of all blood markers including total 
cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and 
triglycerides; low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was 
obtained using the Fredrickson-Friedewald equation.22 Serum 
insulin was measured using an ELISA method,23 plasma glucose 
was measured using the glucose oxidase method and  haemo-
globin A1c was measured in whole blood by ion exchange 
high-performance liquid chromatography. The homeostasis 
model equations were used to provide an estimate of insulin 
resistance.24
ethnicity and socioeconomic status
Parents provided questionnaire-based information on their occu-
pation(s), self-defined ethnicity and the ethnicity of the partic-
ipating child. Participating children provided information on 
parental occupation(s) and on the place of birth of parents and 
grandparents. Parental occupation was coded using the National 
Statistics-Socioeconomic Classification (NS-SEC). If both parents 
worked, the highest occupational group recorded provided the 
basis of classification. NS-SEC was categorised into the three class 
version (professional and managerial, intermediate occupations, 
and routine and manual) plus categories of ‘economically inac-
tive’ (currently unemployed or looking after the home) and ‘not 
classified’ (where the occupation was not stated). Ethnicity was 
defined using parental self-defined ethnicity for both parents, 
or using parentally defined child ethnicity. In a small number of

participants where this information was not available (1.4%), 
child-defined place of origin of parents and grandparents was 
used to define ethnicity. The ‘other’ ethnic group includes all 
other categories of individual and mixed ethnic origins.
statistical methods
Statistical analyses were carried out using STATA/SE software 
(STATA/SE 12 for Windows, StataCorp LP
, College Station, 
Texas, USA). Multilevel linear regression models were used to 
provide adjusted means by takeaway frequency groups for risk 
markers and dietary intake, using XTMIXED and LINCOM 
commands. All analyses were adjusted for sex, age in quartiles, 
ethnic group, socioeconomic status and month as fixed effects; 
school was fitted as a random effect to allow for the clustering 
of children within schools. In further analyses in which the influ-
ence of dietary saturated fat intake on differences in blood lipids 
by takeaway meal frequency was examined, classical measure-
ment models (CME command) were used to allow for possible 
measurement error in dietary intake based on reassessment of 
dietary nutrient intakes in 86 study participants within a 1-year 
period of their original assessment.
resulTs
Among 3679 children invited, 2529 (69% response rate) took 
part in the present study; participation rates were similar in all 
ethnic groups except the black African Caribbeans (66%). Among 
these 2529 children, analyses are based on 1948 children who 
provided full questionnaire data and had complete fasting blood 
samples; their mean age was 10.0 years (95% reference range 
9.3 to 10.6 years), 1023 (52%) were girls. They included similar 
numbers of children of white European, black African-Carib-
bean, South Asian and other ethnic origins (n=475, 496, 495 
and 482, respectively). The distribution of parental socioeco-
nomic position included 26% in managerial/professional, 25% in 
intermediate and 29% in routine/manual occupations, with 16% 
economically inactive and 4% unclassified. The characteristics of 
participants eligible for inclusion in these analyses did not differ 
appreciably from those not included.
The frequencies of reported takeaway meal consumption are 
presented in the online supplementary table 1 by sex, ethnic 
group and socioeconomic status. Overall, 499 children (26%) 
reported never or hardly ever eating a takeaway meal, while 894 
(46%) reported consuming a takeaway meal <1/week and 555 
(28%) reported doing so ≥1/week. Boys reported consuming 
takeaway meals more often than girls (P=0.001) and children 
from lower socioeconomic groups also consumed takeaway 
meals more frequently than those from higher socioeconomic 
groups (P=0.008); there were no marked ethnic differences in 
frequency of takeaway meal consumption.
Table 1 presents the means and 95% CIs of risk markers for 
CHD and type 2 diabetes disease by frequency of takeaway meal 
consumption, adjusted for age (quartiles), sex, month, ethnic 
group, socioeconomic status and school (random effect), with 
formal tests for trend across the takeaway frequency groups. Fat 
mass index, sum of skinfolds, total cholesterol and LDL choles-
terol all tended to be higher in children with a higher frequency 
of takeaway meals (P trend=0.03, 0.05, 0.04 and 0.01, respec-
tively). Among children who reported consuming a takeaway 
meal ≥1/week, total cholesterol was 0.09 
mmol/L (95% 
CI 
0.01 to 0.18) higher and LDL cholesterol 0.10 
mmol/L (95% 
CI 
0.02 to 0.18) higher than in children who never or hardly ever 
consumed takeaway meals. There were no differences in insulin 
resistance, blood pressure or any of the other risk markers by 
frequency of takeaway meal consumption. The differences in 
total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were similar in different 
ethnic groups (tests for interaction all P >0.05) and were little 
affected by additional adjustment for fat mass index, remaining 
statistically significant (data not presented).
Associations between frequency of takeaway meal consump-
tion and dietary nutrient intakes, estimated using the 24-hour 
recall data, were investigated (table 2). Higher reported take-
away meal frequency was associated with higher mean intakes

for total energy, energy density, total fat, saturated fat and 
monounsaturated fat (as percentages of energy) increased (all 
P<0.0001), while intakes of starch and protein (also expressed 
as percentages of energy) were lower. Higher reported takeaway 
meal frequency was also associated with lower intakes of vitamin 
C, iron, calcium and folate. These associations were not mate-
rially affected by the exclusion of 180 children who reported 
having a takeaway evening meal in their 24-hour recall (data 
not presented). Finally, the nutrient contents of the evening meal 
included in the 24-hour dietary recall were compared, according 
to whether meals were prepared at home or obtained from a 
takeaway restaurant (table 3). The evening meals obtained from 
takeaway restaurants were more energy dense, with higher 
energy content and higher total and saturated fat content than 
meals prepared at home.
In further analyses examining whether the higher total choles-
terol and LDL cholesterol levels observed in the children who 
consumed a takeaway meal ≥1 
a week could be accounted for 
by their higher intake of saturated fat % energy, and taking 
account of imprecision in saturated fat intakes using classical 
error models, the differences in total and LDL cholesterol were 
reduced by ~20% 
and ~13%, 
respectively; the difference in 
total cholesterol became statistically non-significant. The differ-
ences in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were also slightly 
reduced once total energy intakes were included in the models. 
Sensitivity analysis found similar patterns of association in boys 
and girls and no further changes after additional adjustment for 
pubertal status.
DIsCussIOn
In this study of UK primary school children of diverse ethnic 
origins, children who regularly consumed takeaway meals 
had higher circulating total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol 
concentrations and higher levels of adiposity than children who 
did not; they also had more energy-dense diets with higher 
intakes of total energy, fat and saturated fat and lower micro-
nutrient intakes (including vitamin C and folate). In an analysis 
comparing nutrient intakes in the previous evening meal in rela-
tion to its source, meals from a takeaway restaurant were more 
energy dense and had much higher fat and saturated fat contents 
than meals prepared at home.
These results are consistent with previous studies which have 
shown that children who regularly eat takeaway food have higher 
energy, fat and saturated fat intakes,25 26 and consume less fruit 
and vegetables.9 10 27 The significantly lower starch, protein and 
calcium intakes in this group may also be adversely affecting the 
health of these children, particularly if these dietary patterns are 
sustained. To our knowledge, no previous study has reported on 
the associations between frequency of takeaway meal consump-
tion and risk markers for CHD and type 2 diabetes in children. 
Our findings are consistent with previous reports in young adults 
and adolescents in the USA and UK showing that frequent fast 
food consumption was associated with higher levels of body 
fatness.7 28 However, in contrast with previous reports in young 
American and Australian adults, we did not find evidence that 
frequent fast food consumption was associated with evidence 
of insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia.4 29 We did however 
observe associations between frequent takeaway meal consump-
tion and higher total and LDL cholesterol, which were consis-
tent with our own observations and a previous report25 showing 
associations between fast food consumption and high saturated 
fat intake. Moreover, in the light of the well-documented asso-
ciation between LDL cholesterol and CHD risk,30 our findings 
are also consistent with evidence that greater consumption of 
takeaway meals is associated with higher CHD risk.6
The analyses presented in this paper related frequency of 
self-reported takeaway meal consumption to a wide range 
of CHD and type 2 diabetes risk factors, in a large ethnically 
diverse population. By including a measure of socioeconomic 
status based on parental occupation in our models, we were able 
to take an important potential confounding factor into account. 
Although we were not able to examine the validity of self-re-
ported takeaway meal consumption directly, this is supported 
by the expected gender and socioeconomic patterns27 31 and

the expected absence of appreciable ethnic differences.12 The 
validity of the dietary data, based on the multiple pass 24-hour 
recall method, has been supported by previous analyses.32 The 
cross-sectional nature of the current study makes it a particu-
larly appropriate design for investigating short-term associa-
tions between diet and blood-based risk markers,33 although it 
remains difficult to establish the direction of causality and to 
interpret differences in overall nutrient intakes between the 
different takeaway meal frequency groups and the underlying 
mechanisms. Further research is needed to establish the extent 
of causality between high consumption of takeaway meals and 
CHD risk markers in children.
The higher total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol concen-
trations observed in the frequent takeaway meal group, if 
sustained, are sufficiently large to increase long-term CHD risk 
by ~10%.30 However, the estimates of the excess saturated 
fat intake associated with consumption of one takeaway meal 
per week (table 3) would be insufficient to account for more 
than about one-third of the observed overall difference in satu-
rated fat intake (table 2) and more than about one-seventh 
of the difference in LDL cholesterol between the highest and 
lowest takeaway intake groups (table 1). Although this could 
reflect systematic under-reporting of takeaway frequency in 
the highest frequency group, a more likely explanation is that 
these groups have markedly different dietary nutrient intakes 
in general, with particularly adverse dietary patterns (including 
high energy and high saturated fat intake) in the highest take-
away meal frequency group. The direction of causality in this 
association remains unclear, however there is evidence that the 
regular consumption of takeaway foods affects taste preferences, 
particularly for high fat, energy-dense foods which influence 
overall dietary nutrient patterns.34 35 These findings highlight the 
need for further investigation (particularly prospective studies) 
of the associations between takeaway meals, dietary patterns 
and risk markers for chronic disease both in children and also 
in adolescents, who have much higher takeaway consumption 
rates.12 This issue is particularly important in the context of the 
rising prevalence of takeaway meal outlets in many neighbour-
hoods (increasing more rapidly in more deprived areas36), which 
is itself an important determinant of increased takeaway meal 
consumption.1 Technological advances have also meant that it is 
now much easier to order and have delivered take away foods, 
resulting in an increase in consumption and although healthier 
takeaway foods are becoming available, this may well be strongly 
socially patterned.
These results suggest that further increases in takeaway meal 
consumption (and marketing directed at encouraging such 
increases) are likely to have adverse public health consequences 
and should be actively discouraged. The government should be 
considering health protection initiatives to reverse the current 
trends in takeaway meal consumption, in the context of broader 
efforts to improve childhood diet and nutrition in home and 
school settings.
