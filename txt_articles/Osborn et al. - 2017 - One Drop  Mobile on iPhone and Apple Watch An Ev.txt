Abstract
Background: The One Drop | Mobile app supports manual and passive (via HealthKit and One Drop’s glucose meter) tracking
of self-care and glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).
Objective: We assessed the HbA1c change of a sample of people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) using the
One Drop | Mobile app on iPhone and Apple Watch, and tested relationships between self-care tracking with the app and HbA1c
change.
Methods: In June 2017, we identified people with diabetes using the One Drop | Mobile app on iPhone and Apple Watch who
entered two HbA1c measurements in the app 60 to 365 days apart. We assessed the relationship between using the app and HbA1c
change.
Results: Users had T1D (n=65) or T2D (n=191), were 22.7% (58/219) female, with diabetes for a mean 8.34 (SD 8.79) years,
and tracked a mean 2176.35 (SD 3430.23) self-care activities between HbA1c entries. There was a significant 1.36% or 14.9
mmol/mol HbA1c reduction (F=62.60, P<.001) from the first (8.72%, 71.8 mmol/mol) to second HbA1c (7.36%, 56.9 mmol/mol)
measurement. Tracking carbohydrates was independently associated with greater HbA1c improvement (all P<.01).
Conclusions: Using One Drop | Mobile on iPhone and Apple Watch may favorably impact glycemic control.

Introduction
The digital diabetes ecosystem is booming [1,2], with more than
1500 mobile apps supporting diabetes management [3], yet very
few diabetes apps have been studied. For the few that have, they
significantly reduce glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) by an
average 0.49% [4].
The HbA1c measurement is the amount of hemoglobin in the
blood with glucose attached to it. People are diagnosed with
diabetes when their HbA1c level is 6.5% or greater. An HbA1c
of 7.0% or greater puts people with diabetes at risk of developing
macrovascular and microvascular complications, whereas a
HbA1c less than 7.0% or reducing HbA1c by 1.0% prevents
complications [5,6]. Diabetes self-care (eg, eating fewer

 carbohydrate grams, being more active, taking medications)
improves HbA1c levels.
Diabetes apps offer tracking of self-care and can educate and
motivate people to better care for their health [1]. Together, the
widely used diabetes apps rate highly in terms of functionality,
aesthetics, and engagement [7]. Devices, sensors, wearables,
and watches that passively collect data may bolster engagement.
Passive data collection makes a more useful and less
burdensome diabetes app [1,8]. Very few apps, however, offer
manual and passive data collection from a mobile phone and a
smartwatch, and no study to our knowledge has explored the
health benefit of this type of digital solution.
The One Drop | Mobile app offers manual data entry, but also
passive data collection via Apple’s HealthKit, Apple Watch,
and the Bluetooth-enabled One Drop | Chrome glucose meter.
We hypothesized that there would be a pre-post HbA1c change
among people with diabetes using the One Drop | Mobile app
on an iPhone and Apple Watch. We also hypothesized self-care
tracking with the app would be associated with HbA1c change.
Methods
One Drop | Mobile: A Mobile Phone and Smartwatch
App
The One Drop | Mobile app is free and available on iOS,
WatchOS, and Android operating systems. One Drop users
manually and passively (via HealthKit for iPhone and Apple
Watch, Google Fit for Android mobile phones, and the
Bluetooth-enabled One Drop | Chrome blood glucose meter)
store and track blood glucose readings, medication doses,
physical activity, and carbohydrates consumed. A built-in food
library expedites carbohydrate tracking. A medication scheduler
reminds users when a dose is due, and tracks doses upon
confirmation. Statistics of tracked data are viewable on iPhone,
Android, and Apple Watch.
Watch app users can enter data directly from their Watch, and
view statistics of their data and monitor goal progress on the
Watch face. They can get push notifications on their Watch,
including medication reminders and motivational messages
prompting and reinforcing self-care.
On the mobile phone app, users can view in-depth statistics of
their data and track HbA1c test results and body weight. An
in-app “Newsfeed” delivers health tips, articles, infographics,
and more. A “Community” section facilitates learning from,
supporting, and receiving support from other users. The iPhone
app has a “Notifications” inbox with data-driven insights,
achievements, reminders, and support accumulated from other
users.
Procedures
On June 6, 2017, we identified people with type 1 (T1D) or type
2 diabetes (T2D) using the One Drop | Mobile app on an iPhone
and Apple Watch who had manually entered at least two HbA1c
values in the app with HbA1c test dates 60 to 365 days apart.
We did not recruit participants. Instead, we analyzed data
collected from real users who elected to use the One Drop |
Mobile app on their mobile phone and smartwatch devices.
Users enter and store self-care and health data in the One Drop
| Mobile app. All data exist in a secure server in the cloud. We
characterized users with app-entered demographics (eg, gender,
diabetes type). We tested their HbA1c change (ie, self-reported
HbA1c collected in the app). We also tested if tracking self-care
with the app (ie, the number of times food, activity, blood
glucose, and medications were stored in the app between HbA1c
measurements) was associated with HbA1c change.
All users agree to an end-user license agreement (EULA). In
this agreement, it states that, as a user, you “grant One Drop a
perpetual, transferrable, sublicensable, worldwide, nonexclusive,
royalty-free license to reproduce, distribute, use, modify,
remove, publish, transmit, publicly perform, publicly display,
or create derivative works of Your User Content for any purpose
without compensation to you, including for the purpose of
promoting One Drop and the App, including after your account
is cancelled or otherwise terminated.” It also states that, “One
Drop...may track and report your activity inside of the App,
including for analytics purposes.” The full EULA is available
in the app and online.
Measures
User Characteristics
Gender, diabetes type, and year of diagnosis are self-reported
in the app. The difference between year of diagnosis and year
of One Drop account creation determined years of diagnosed
diabetes. Passively collected time zone data determined user
location. User location was dichotomized as United States versus
non-United States in analyses because few users outside the
United States had entered two HbA1c measurements required
for inclusion.
Insulin Status
We reviewed medication names tracked and scheduled in the
app to determine if a user was taking insulin or not.
Self-Care
We summed self-care data tracked between two HbA1c entries
(60-365 days apart), generating counts of blood glucose, food
(carbohydrates), medications, activity, and the overall number
of self-care entries tracked in the app during that time.
Glycemic Control
Test results and test dates of HbA1c were self-reported in the
app. Self-reported recall of a HbA1c test is highly sensitive
(99%) to medical records and claims data documenting an actual
HbA1c test [9]. A self-reported HbA1c result is sensitive (79%)
to a lab HbA1c test result [10]. Further, we used mean blood
glucose measured before the second HbA1c test date to exclude
invalid HbA1c measurements and, subsequently, validate
self-reported HbA1c at that time point (see Analyses section).
We used HbA1c test dates to calculate the number of days
between HbA1c entries. We divided 365 days by 12 months to
get 30.42 (days per) month. We divided the number of days

 between HbA1c entries by 30.42 (days per) month to get the
number of months between HbA1c measurements.
Study Oversight
One Drop, Informed Data Systems Inc (IDS) received an
exemption for institutional review board approval and a waiver
of informed consent from Solutions IRB, an independent ethics
review company (Little Rock, AR and Yarnell, AZ) to study
all de-identified data owned by One Drop IDS. All One Drop |
Mobile app users must actively agree to a EULA detailing data
ownership and use.
Analyses
All analyses were performed using SPSS version 23 (IBM Corp).
Summary statistics characterized the sample. Mann-Whitney U
tests were used for diabetes type differences with continuous
variables, and chi-square tests for differences with dichotomous
variables. One user with T1D selected “other” for gender.
Because “other” gender was infrequently selected, we removed
the “other” gender subgroup prior to testing diabetes type
differences on gender.
To exclude invalid self-reported HbA1c data, we used the
formula HbA1c=(90-day mean blood glucose + 77.3)/35.6 [11]
to compare self-reported HbA1c to 90-day mean blood glucose,
and excluded users with a greater or less than 2.0% difference
(n=44 were excluded). Spearman rho correlations verified the
relationship between self-reported HbA1c and mean blood
glucose consistent with prior research [12].
Two variables had missing data: gender (37/256, 14.4%) and
duration of diagnosed diabetes (47/256, 18.3%). Multiple
imputation corrected for missing data on these variables [13].
We used predictive mean matching [14,15] to impute 100
datasets.
Three mixed-effects repeated measures models tested mean
HbA1c differences. The first unadjusted model tested the effects
of time, diabetes type, and the interaction of time by diabetes
type. The second model tested these effects adjusted for a priori
covariates: gender, location, years of diagnosed diabetes, and
months between HbA1c measurements. We restricted the third
model to users with T2D and tested the time effect only adjusted
for a priori covariates and insulin status.
Finally, four multiple regression models tested relationships
between self-care tracking with the app and HbA1c change. The
first unadjusted model assessed the relationships between the
amount of tracking by self-care type and HbA1c change. The
second model introduced diabetes type. The third model added
a priori covariates. The fourth model included users with T2D
only, a priori covariates, and insulin status.
Results
Users (N=256) had T1D (n=65) or T2D (n=191), and were
22.7% (58/219) female, diagnosed with diabetes for a mean
8.34 (SD 8.79) years, and tracked a mean 2176.35 (SD 3430.23)
self-care activities in the app between HbA1c entries. Across
each of four self-care types, the Shapiro-Wilk test statistic
ranged from 0.22 to 0.86 (all P<.001), signifying a non-normal
distribution. We dichotomized each self-care variable to tracked
versus not tracked to satisfy assumptions of statistical tests.
Table 1 presents median and interquartile ranges, n (%), or mean
and standard deviation with P values for diabetes type
differences on observed variables before multiple imputation.
Compared to users with T2D, users with T1D had diabetes for
more years and entered more self-care data in the app between
HbA1c measurements, particularly blood glucose readings.
Self-reported HbA1c and 90-day mean blood glucose were
strongly correlated (ρ=.75, P<.001), even when stratified by
diabetes type (T1D: ρ=.84, P<.001; T2D: ρ=.72, P<.001). This
is consistent with previous cohort studies reporting correlations
varying from .71 to .86 [12].
In unadjusted and adjusted models, there was a significant 1.36%
(14.9 mmol/mol) HbA1c reduction (unadjusted and adjusted
F=62.60, P<.001) during a median 4.06 (IQR 2.82) months
(unadjusted: 8.26% [66.8 mmol/mol] to 6.90% [51.9 mmol/mol];
adjusted 8.72% [71.8 mmol/mol] to 7.36% [56.9 mmol/mol]).
In the adjusted model, users with T1D had an average 0.41%
(F=4.38, P=.04) higher HbA1c than users with T2D, but there
was no time by diabetes type interaction. After adjusting for a
priori covariates and insulin status, users with T2D had a 1.27%
(13.9 mmol/mol) HbA1c reduction (F=364.50, P<.001; 8.16%
[65.7 mmol/mol] to 6.89% [51.8 mmol/mol]).
Finally, using the app to track carbohydrates was associated
with greater HbA1c improvement even after adjusting for
covariates and insulin status for users with T2D (all P<.01).

Discussion
We assessed the HbA1c change of 256 people with diabetes
using the One Drop | Mobile app on an iPhone and Apple Watch
for up to one year. HbA1c decreased by 1.36% (14.9 mmol/mol)
in a median of approximately 4 months. Using the app to track
carbohydrates was independently associated with HbA1c
improvement.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate the HbA1c
benefit of a tethered diabetes mobile phone and smartwatch app.
One study asked people with T1D to use a phone and
smartwatch app and give qualitative feedback [16]. Users
appreciated entering and viewing data from their watch, the
watch’s connectivity to their phone, and viewing reminders on
their watch. One Drop | Mobile on Apple Watch delivers all
three benefits and, based on our findings, may improve glycemic
control.
There are study limitations. This is not a randomized controlled
trial, preventing causal conclusions. The sample was
self-selected, limiting generalizability. HbA1c measurements
were self-reported rather than assessed with a laboratory assay.
Passively collected data are less prone to social desirability
biases, but have their own reliability and validity issues [17].
The One Drop | Mobile app has features we did not evaluate or
adjust for in our analyses. Finally, we do not know users’ age
or socioeconomic status (eg, income, education, insurance
status), preventing generalizability to all ages and socioeconomic
groups.
Despite these limitations, people of all ages [18], race/ethnicities,
and socioeconomic backgrounds [19] increasingly want to use
smart devices to assist in the management of diabetes [20].
Research needs to critically evaluate diabetes apps, trackers,
and smartwatches, especially as new devices enter the
marketplace. Findings must be disseminated directly to
consumers and to physicians who can assess these tools and
make recommendations accordingly.
