ABSTRACT
Background: Weight reduction may reduce the severity of psoriasis,
but little is known about the long-term effects.
Objective: We aimed to investigate long-term effects of weight
reduction in psoriasis.
Design: We previously conducted a randomized trial (n = 60)
involving patients with psoriasis who were allocated to a control
group or a low-energy diet (LED) group. Here we followed the
participants for an additional 48-wk period. In total, 56 patients
with psoriasis [mean 6 SD body mass index (in kg/m2): 34.4 6
5.3] underwent a 64-wk weight-loss program consisting of an
initial 16-wk randomized phase with an LED for 8 wk and
8 wk of normal food intake combined with 2 LED products/d,
followed by a 48-wk period of weight maintenance with the latter
diet. After the randomization phase, the control group received
the same 8 + 8-wk LED intervention, and all patients were then
followed for 48 wk while on the weight-loss maintenance diet.
The main outcome was the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index
(PASI), and secondary outcome was the Dermatology Life Qual-
ity Index (DLQI).
Results: For the present study, 56 patients were eligible, 38 agreed
to participate, and 32 completed. After the 16-wk LED-only period,
the mean weight loss was 215.0 kg (95% CI: 216.6, 213.4 kg),
and PASI and DLQI were reduced by 22.3 (95% CI: 23.1, 21.5)
and 22.3 (95% CI: 23.2, 21.4), respectively. At week 64, the mean
weight loss compared with baseline was 210.1 kg (95% CI: 212.0,
28.1 kg), and PASI and DLQI were maintained at 22.9 (95% CI:
23.9, 21.9) and 21.9 (95% CI: 23.0, 20.9), respectively.
Conclusion: Long-term weight loss in patients with psoriasis has
long-lasting positive effects on the severity of psoriasis. This trial
was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01137188.

INTRODUCTION
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting
w2% of the population in Northern Europe and the United
States (1, 2). It is characterized by an immunological re-
sponse mainly elicited by activated T helper 1 and 17 lym-
phocytes. Apart from infiltrating the affected skin areas, these
cells also play a key role in eliciting a systemic low-grade
inflammatory state by interacting with other cellular and
humoral mediators such as IL-2, IL-12, IL-23, TNF-a, IFN-g,
macrophages, dendritic cells, and mast cells (1, 3). Hyper-
proliferation and premature maturation of keratinocytes in-
duce the typical erythrosquamous psoriatic skin lesions,
which are usually located on the scalp, elbows, knees, and
lower back (1).
Epidemiologic studies have established that psoriasis is as-
sociated with obesity and that increased adiposity is a risk factor
for incident psoriasis (4–7). Psoriasis and obesity are accom-
panied by low-grade systemic inflammation, and in theory,
obesity-derived proinflammatory mechanisms may worsen the
severity of psoriasis in overweight individuals with psoriasis (8).
Given the close association between psoriasis and adiposity, we

 recently reported a randomized study on the effects of weight
reduction with a low-energy diet (LED)10 on the severity of
psoriasis (9). In the study, obese patients with psoriasis were
followed for 16 wk, and the weight reduction resulted in a trend in
favor of a clinically important reduction in the severity of psori-
asis and a significant improvement in self-reported quality of life.
In addition, weight reduction significantly improved several risk
factors for cardiovascular disease in these patients (10).
Concerns remain, however, regarding maintenance of weight
reduction in the longer term, especially after rapid weight loss
with an LED (11–13). We therefore determined the extent to
which initial improvements in the severity of psoriasis [mea-
sured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and the
Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)] with weight reduction
were maintained after 1 y in obese patients with psoriasis.
METHODS
Design
The current study was an extension of a previously published
randomized trial in which patients with psoriasis were randomly
assigned to either a 16-wk weight-loss intervention group or
a control group (9). Here we report the subsequent 48-wk tra-
jectories of both groups after entering the 16-wk dietary inter-
vention and undergoing follow-up. The study was conducted at
the Department of Dermato-Allergology of Gentofte Hospital at
the University of Copenhagen between 1 June 2010 and 1 June
2012. The local ethical committee approved the present study,
and the initial study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT01137188). The procedures followed were in accordance
with the ethical standards of the responsible committees on
human experimentation (both institutional and national) and with
the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000.
Weight loss and maintenance phase
The full treatment program lasted for 64 wk and consisted of
2 periods: the LED-only period (lasting 16 wk) and the weight-
loss maintenance period (lasting 48 wk). The dietary weight loss
approach that applied during the first 8 wk consisted of a formula-
based LED containing 800–1000 kcal/d (Cambridge Weight
Plan). During the 8 wk that followed, the participants were re-
introduced to regular foods, including 2 formula LED products
given on a daily basis, and their daily caloric intake was in-
creased to 1200 kcal/d. Those initially randomized to the control
group received the same 8 + 8-wk initial LED intervention after
completing the control period. The maintenance period started
immediately after the 8 + 8-wk LED period and lasted for the
remainder of the study (48 wk), during which all participants
replaced 2 daily meals, 1 main meal and 1 snack meal, with
formula LED products. All of the participants attended bi-
monthly group sessions with the study dietitian, which involved
anthropometric measurements, psychological encouragement,
and support for adherence to the study diet and maintenance of
weight loss. Anti-psoriatic treatment had to be stable and re-
mained unchanged during the study, and the participants were
instructed not to change their anti-psoriatic treatment in any way.
Medications for other medical conditions, e.g., arterial hyper-
tension, could be changed if needed. To control for seasonal
variations in ultraviolet-light exposure, the primary inclusion of
patients was conducted throughout the year to limit this effect.
Main outcome measure
The primary outcome measure was the severity of psoriasis,
assessed by PASI and measured at baseline and at weeks 8, 16, 24,
32, 40, 48, 56, and 64 by the lead investigator (PJ), who was not
blinded regarding the initial study randomization.
Secondary outcome measures
Secondary outcomes included DLQI, which was used to assess
the health-related quality of life (14). Additional outcome mea-
sures were body weight, height, BMI, fat mass, lean body mass,
and waist and hip circumferences. We also drew blood for mea-
surements of concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein,
vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D3), plasma glucose, glycated
hemoglobin, triglycerides, and HDL, LDL, VLDL, and total
cholesterol. All blood samples were analyzed at the Department
of Clinical Biochemistry of Gentofte Hospital at the University
of Copenhagen.
Safety
Consuming only low amounts of calories can cause certain
transient side effects such as gout, gallstones, hair loss, dry skin,
constipation, increased cold sensitivity, fatigue, hunger, and visual
disturbances. The primary investigator (PJ) and study dietitian
noted any adverse events at each visit.
Statistics
This 1-y extension study was not designed based on any
a priori assumption about power with a corresponding sample
size. However, anticipating that at least half of the participants
enrolled (60 in total) would accept the invitation to be part of and
complete the subsequent follow-up study, it would be reasonable
to detect a remaining weight loss of 10 kg. For a paired t test of
a normal mean difference with a 2-sided significance level of
0.05, assuming a common SD of 15 kg and correlation 0.5,
a sample size of 30 pairs has substantial power (94.2%) to detect
a mean difference of 10 kg. Even if the remaining weight loss
among the observed individuals was only 8 kg, our study would
have been reasonably well powered (80.6%).
All data analyses were carried out according to a pre-established
analysis plan with software by SAS Institute Inc. (version 9.3). We
reported all descriptive statistics and tests in accordance with the
recommendations of the network for “Enhancing the quality and
transparency of health research” by use of a merged format be-
tween the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement
and the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in
Epidemiology statement (15–17). For descriptive statistics sum-
marizing the data, mean values and SDs were used unless oth-
erwise stated. Medians and IQRs (quartile 1 and quartile 3) were
used for skewed variables.

 In the primary analyses for the longitudinal part of the study
describing the trajectory over time, we used restricted maximum
likelihood linear mixed-effects models for repeated-measures
data, a method that assumes that the missing values for participants
who were lost to follow-up can be predicted from those who
remained in the study (18). Missing data that satisfy this condition
are said to be “missing at random” (19). Thus, the reported
(primary) analyses were based on the linear mixed-model esti-
mates without data imputation. The linear approach for repeated
measurements was based on the Diggle model, which was fitted
in SAS software (version 9.4) by use of PROC MIXED based
on restricted maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters.
The factor [Subject] was considered as a random effects factor
(Random int/Subject = PtID). The assessment of the group (LED
compared with controls) and time effects (Repeated/Subject =
PtID Type = SP(Gau)(Time) Local) was of interest in testing for
a possible interaction, and both group and time were considered
as systematic factors by using the baseline value as covariate to
reduce the random variation and increase power.
For sensitivity analyses, alternative imputation techniques
were also performed because the statistical modeling approaches
for missing data based on the “missing at random” assumption
might be controversial in a typical weight-loss trial, i.e., those
who drop out are likely to differ from those who remain in the
study (18, 20). We therefore used the “baseline observation
carried forward” (BOCF) technique for replacement of missing
data. Indeed, this assumption may be more appropriate, given
the usual recidivism after weight loss, i.e., those who drop out
have a tendency to return to their baseline weight (20).
RESULTS
In the primary study, the patients were randomly assigned to
either a 16-wk intensive dietary weight loss intervention with
a formula LED only (800–1000 kcal/d) for 8 wk and 8 wk of
gradual introduction of normal food intake aimed at weight
maintenance (reaching 1200 kcal/d including 2 formula LED
products/d) or a control group, as indicated in Figure 1 (9). Of
the 30 subjects randomly assigned to weight-loss intervention
(LED), 27 completed the study (3 dropped out because of lack
of motivation). Of the 30 subjects randomly assigned to the control
group, 4 dropped out because of lack of motivation, leaving 26
subjects who subsequently underwent the same 16-wk LED period
as those who were primarily assigned to the LED group. Loss of
motivation led to 2 more dropouts during that LED period. Thus,
51 patients (original intervention group, n = 27; original control
group, n = 24) were available to enter into the follow-up program,
and of these, 38 agreed to participate (20 from the LED group and
18 from the control group) in the 48-wk weight-maintenance
program described here, which was completed by 32 subjects
(Figure 1). Five dropped out because of loss of motivation, and one

LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF WEIGHT REDUCTION ON PSORIASIS

 dropped out because of a job change and relocation to another part
of the country.
As shown in Table 1, the patients were obese with a mean BMI
(in kg/m2) of w34. They had mild-to-moderate psoriasis, as
indicated by a median PASI score of w5. The median baseline
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein was w3 mg/L, indicating
a state of low-grade systemic inflammation.
Weight change and maintenance
As presented in Figure 2A and Table 2, during the LED period
of the study (weeks 0–16), weight, BMI, waist circumference, hip
circumference, and fat mass all decreased statistically signif-
icantly. During the 48-wk weight-maintenance period (weeks
16–64), there was a gradual regain of weight of 4.9 kg, and
the mean weight loss at week 64 was 210.1 kg (95% CI:
212.0, 28.1 kg) compared with baseline (Figure 2A). The
corresponding (conservative) sensitivity estimate from the
BOCF-adjusted model indicated that the weight loss at week
64 was 5.8 kg.
The PASI score had decreased by a mean of 2.3 (95% CI:
23.1, 21.5) by the end of the LED period (week 16) (Figure
2B and Table 2). As shown in Figure 2B, the PASI score
continued to decrease during the weight-maintenance period
from weeks 16 to 24, and from that point onward (weeks 24–
64), the severity of psoriasis decreased further [22.9 (95%
CI: 23.9, 21.9)], despite a simultaneous and substantial
mean regain in weight of 4.9 kg; based on the BOCF esti-
mates, the change in PASI after 64 wk corresponded to 1.7
PASI units.

 The DLQI remained largely unchanged relative to baseline
[21.9 (95% CI: 23.0, 20.9)] (Table 2). Changes in the meta-
bolic variables are presented in Table 2, illustrating a return to
baseline values for the cholesterol concentrations, whereas the
initial favorable effect of weight reduction on glycated hemo-
globin concentrations was maintained. The quantitative associ-
ation of effect size between weight loss and the psoriasis
outcomes (PASI and DLQI) is shown in Supplemental Table 1.
Weight reduction peaked approximately at week 16, which co-
incided with the greatest improvement in both PASI and DLQI.
To answer the question concerning whether the changes in
PASI and DLQI were associated with the observed weight loss on
the individual patient level rather than the group level, Spear-
man’s correlation analyses were calculated (Figure 3). As
depicted in Figure 3, there was no statistically significant
association for any of these.
Safety
We recorded only mild side effects, all of which occurred during
the LED period. One patient had sensations of hunger throughout
the study, 5 had mild headache during the first 2 wk, 20 were more
tired than usual at some point during the study, 3 were constipated,
14 felt lightheaded or dizzy from weeks 4–8, and 14 experienced
increased cold sensitivity. No serious adverse events were re-
corded during the 48-wk weight-maintenance period.
DISCUSSION
In this 48-wk extension study of obese patients with psoriasis
who underwent successful weight loss with a 16-wk LED,
changes in the severity of psoriasis (PASI and DLQI) were
maintained after 64 wk (9). In addition, marked improvements in
plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin amounts remained
unchanged after the weight maintenance period, whereas cho-
lesterol concentrations had returned to baseline values. The
participants maintained a significant mean weight loss from
baseline to week 64 of 210.1 kg (95% CI: 212.0, 28.1 kg),
corresponding to an average regain in weight of 4.9 kg from week
16 to week 64. From ancillary analyses, according to the Spearman’s
correlation, we were able to answer the clinically relevant question
of whether the observed improvement in disease activity (i.e.,
PASI and DLQI) was associated with the observed weight change
on the individual patient rather than the group level. The analysis
showed that the beneficial effect mediated by weight reduction
could not be explained by any obvious dose-response phenomena.
The association between psoriasis and adiposity has been
firmly established in epidemiologic studies (4–7). In theory,
obesity-derived proinflammatory mechanisms may worsen pso-
riasis in overweight patients (8, 21, 22). One might therefore
assume that weight reduction would improve skin condition in
obese individuals with psoriasis. Indeed, numerous case reports
of patients undergoing bariatric surgery have described a bene-
ficial effect of weight loss on psoriasis in overweight patients
(23–28). Also, Gisondi et al. (29) showed an increased response
to cyclosporine after weight loss in obese patients with psoriasis,
and in 2013 we published the results of a randomized LED
weight-loss trial with PASI as the primary endpoint (9); this
provided the patients for the current extension study, which was
designed to follow maintenance of weight loss. Our randomized
study showed a trend in favor of a clinically important reduction
in the severity of psoriasis measured by PASI and DLQI and also
that certain components of the cardiovascular disease risk profile
of obese patients with psoriasis could be significantly improved
after weight loss (9, 10). To our knowledge, there have been no
studies on weight reduction in overweight patients with psoriasis
with the severity of psoriasis as primary endpoint―and no such
studies with extended follow-up periods.
Although weight loss can usually be achieved through dietary
restriction, it appears to be common knowledge that people who
manage to lose weight will regain the weight they have lost in the
long term (11–13). In 2001, Anderson et al. (30) conducted
a meta-analysis including 29 studies to explore the efficacy of
long-term weight-loss maintenance. The authors found that in-
dividuals who had completed very-low-energy diet programs or
had lost $20 kg in weight maintained a significantly greater
weight loss at 5 y (mean weight-loss maintenance 30%) than
after a slightly hypo-energetic balanced diet or weight loss of
,10 kg (mean weight-loss maintenance 18%). Furthermore,
a recent review pointed out that there is no significant difference
between very-low-energy diets and low-energy diets in terms of
weight loss after long-term follow-up (31). However, one may
speculate that long-term maintenance of weight loss may be
more difficult for obese patients with psoriasis than for healthy
individuals. Patients with psoriasis may be more likely to fail
at weight-loss maintenance because not only are they burdened
by excess body weight, they are also under stress from the
dermatologic treatment, the skin disease itself, and possibly
concomitant comorbidity. Frequent dietary support meetings
and encouragement may therefore be even more important to
these patients to sustain the lifestyle changes in physical activity
and food intake needed for successful weight maintenance.

 Interestingly, recent research has shown that clinicians recognize
that lifestyle intervention is beneficial in psoriasis, but they lack
the skills to implement them (32, 33).
The present study has some limitations that should be considered
when interpreting the results. First, this was not a prospective
observational follow-up study in its strictest sense, because we first
subjected the original control group to the 8 + 8-wk LED period
before these subjects entered the weight-maintenance program,
whereas the original intervention group entered the latter program
directly. However, there was no interaction between weight-loss

maintenance was unaffected by study group allocation. Second, the
main investigator was not blinded regarding treatment allocation,
thus introducing the risk of observer bias. Third, 18 patients
(32.1%) declined to participate, thus introducing selection bias
with the risk of overestimating weight-loss maintenance. Last, the
patients had only mild-to-moderate psoriasis or were in stable anti-
psoriatic treatment during the whole treatment period. It is possible
that weight maintenance may be more challenging to individuals
with more severe psoriasis.
In conclusion, obese patients with psoriasis can achieve a
significant short-term weight loss with an LED program, which
can be largely maintained by most of the patients at 1 y. The
initial beneficial effects of weight reduction on the severity of
psoriasis and on amounts of plasma glucose and glycated he-
moglobin were maintained at 1 y, despite some regain of weight.
Interestingly, our findings are in accord with the results of
a randomized study by Li et al. (34) in which the effect of a 6-y
lifestyle intervention on diabetes incidence persisted for 2 de-
cades. Our results suggest that weight-reduction therapy should
be part of a multimodal management approach in obese patients
with psoriasis.
