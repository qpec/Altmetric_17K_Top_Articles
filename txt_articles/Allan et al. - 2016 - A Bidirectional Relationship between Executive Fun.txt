Physically active lifestyles and other health-enhancing behaviors play an important role
in preserving executive function into old age. Conversely, emerging research suggests
that executive functions facilitate participation in a broad range of healthy behaviors
including physical activity and reduced fatty food, tobacco, and alcohol consumption.
They do this by supporting the volition, planning, performance monitoring, and inhibition
necessary to enact intentions and override urges to engage in health damaging behavior.
Here, we focus firstly on evidence suggesting that health-enhancing behaviors can
induce improvements in executive function. We then switch our focus to findings linking
executive function to the consistent performance of health-promoting behaviors and
the avoidance of health risk behaviors. We suggest that executive function, health
behavior, and disease processes are interdependent. In particular, we argue that a
positive feedback loop may exist whereby health behavior-induced changes in executive
function foster subsequent health-enhancing behaviors, which in turn help sustain
efficient executive functions and good health. We conclude by outlining the implications
of this reciprocal relationship for intervention strategies, the design of research studies,
and the study of healthy aging.

INTRODUCTION
Physical activity has been described as “the best buy in medicine” (Loprinzi, 2015). Having an
active lifestyle not only reduces the risk of chronic conditions (Warburton et al., 2006), it also helps
preserve cognitive function (Sofi et al., 2011) and in particular, higher level “executive” function
(EF) into old age (Colcombe and Kramer, 2003), and by doing so may enhance subsequent activity
levels and foster a range of other health protective behaviors, producing long-run health benefits
(Loprinzi, 2015). In the same way, engagement in other health behaviors could yield similarly
reciprocal cognitive and behavioral benefits and reduce the incidence of chronic disease.
In this review we propose that a set of self-reinforcing positive feedback loops link health-
protective behaviors and EF. First, we provide an overview of research linking physical activity
and other health-enhancing behaviors to increases in EF. Second, we examine emerging evidence
pointing to EF as a key driver of the successful adoption and maintenance of physically active
lifestyles and health promoting behavior. Third, we propose an integrated reciprocal account
whereby EF and health behavior are linked through a feedback loop that could confer substantial

health benefits over time. Finally, we outline implications for
intervention strategies and study design.
In the context of cognitive function, higher-level EFs are of
critical importance as they provide the self-regulatory resources
needed to effectively plan and execute goal-directed behaviors
(Hofmann et al., 2012b). Specifically, the EFs are the higher-
order cognitive processes involved in the planning, initiation,
sequencing and monitoring of complex goal directed behavior
(Royall et al., 2002; Lezak et al., 2004) and can be thought
of collectively as the processes which enable top-down control
of behavior, thoughts, and emotion. While the concept is
notoriously difficult to define, there is broad agreement that
the term covers three distinct but overlapping processes: mental
flexibility, working memory, and inhibition (Miyake et al., 2000;
Miyake and Friedman, 2012).
KEY CONCEPT 1 | What is Executive Function?
EF is an umbrella term for the related but distinct processes involved in the
effortful control of goal directed behavior. Largely mediated by the prefrontal
cortex, EF has been summarized as “..... the co-ordinated operation of various
processes to accomplish a particular goal in a flexible manner” (Funahashi,
2001) and encompasses three main factors:
• mental flexibility/set shifting (strategically shifting attention between goals and
flexibly adapting thinking to suit the situation),
• monitoring and updating working memory (evaluating and updating goal
relevant information held in mind), and
• inhibition of prepotent responses (suppressing inappropriate, dominant, or
habitual responses when necessary).
Over the lifespan, the combined influence of these three facets
of EF allows health promoting goals to be pursued despite the
presence of distraction, tempting situational cues, and visceral
desires (Hall and Marteau, 2014). EF typically declines in old
age, potentially compounding age related declines in health as EF
plays an important role in carrying out tasks including chronic
illness management (Tomlin and Sinclair, 2016) and in allowing
health-enhancing behaviors to be enacted and health-damaging
behaviors to be resisted (Hall et al., 2008a; Williams and Thayer,
2009). Perhaps as a result, those with better EF tend to avoid
chronic illness and live longer even following the diagnosis of
a chronic illness (Duff et al., 2009; Hall et al., 2009, 2010).
Fully understanding the cognitive factors associated with positive
health behaviors and with healthy aging in general is vitally
important in the context of our rapidly aging population. By
2050, the World Health Organization anticipates that 1.5 billion
people will be aged 65 or over (World Health Organisation, 2011)
so ensuring that health is preserved into old age is a key goal for
health scientists.
In

outcomes,
EFs
are
themselves influenced by health-related behaviors and the
resulting disease processes in several ways. For example EF is less
efficient in individuals who exercise less than others (Colcombe
and Kramer, 2003), who are obese (Debette et al., 2011) or who
show evidence of systemic inflammation (Komulainen et al.,
2007; Trollor et al., 2012). We suggest that positive feedback
loops exist whereby EF sustains health protective behaviors
which in turn protect cognitive function and physical health
into old age (McMinn et al., 2013). In our previously published
paper (Daly et al., 2015), the catalyst for this review, we provided
a demonstration of this idea in the area of physical activity,
showing not only that higher levels of EF lead to increased future
levels of physical activity, but also that higher levels of physical
activity contribute to future improvements in EF.
This original paper was written in the context of (a) a
substantial evidence base linking physical activity level to
improvements in executive functioning, and (b) suggestions from
the literature that the opposite may also be the case i.e., that
efficient EF may facilitate future engagement in physical activity.
Our study was designed to test this by modeling the directionality
of the physical activity—EF relationship.
Using data collected from 4555 older adults over 6 years (4
study waves) of the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA),
we ran three separate sets of analyses. Firstly, we examined
the cross-sectional association between physical activity and
executive functioning for individuals across the four study waves
using multilevel modeling adjusting for age, sex, education,
wealth, and long-standing illness. Next we examined how
changes in physical activity related to simultaneous changes in
executive functioning by conducting a fixed effects analysis to
test whether within-person variation in physical activity was
associated with within-person variation in executive functioning.
By examining within-person variation in this way, any effects
of non-observed time-invariant confounders (i.e., factors such
as genetics, early adversity etc.) are essentially ruled out as they
would not be expected to vary within people over time. Finally,
we used longitudinal multilevel modeling to test whether physical
activity at one point in time could be used to predict changes
in EF and whether the efficiency of EF could predict subsequent
engagement in physical activity.
These analyses revealed that physical activity and EF
were closely interlinked and that the association between the
two remained after controlling for demographic and health
characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrated that dynamic
within-person changes in EF corresponded with parallel changes
in physical activity, largely ruling out the possibility that
non-observed, time-invariant confounders had produced the
association. Critically, we found evidence that the relationship
between physical activity and EF is bidirectional. Those with poor
EF showed subsequent decreases in their rates of participation in
physical activity and older adults who engaged in sports and other
activities involving physical exertion tended to retain high levels
of EF over time.
In the present review we describe in more detail the evidence
supporting the existence of a bidirectional, reciprocal link
between physical activity and EF and expand this idea to
incorporate other health protective behaviors.
BEING PHYSICALLY ACTIVE: POSITIVE
EFFECTS ON COGNITIVE FUNCTION
With a rapidly aging population it becomes increasingly
important to identify behaviors that people can engage in that
may slow cognitive decline, or even improve cognitive abilities
over time (Singh-Manoux et al., 2012). There is a large body of
evidence demonstrating the beneficial effect of physical activity

Executive Function and Health Behavior
on EF. Colcombe and Kramer’s highly influential (2003) meta-
analysis of 18 randomized intervention studies found a larger
beneficial effect on cognitive task performance for older adults
who received exercise interventions [0.478 (SE = 0.029, n = 101,
p < 0.01)] compared with those in control groups [0.164 (SE =
0.028, n = 96, p < 0.05)] (Colcombe and Kramer, 2003). When
compared to other aspects of cognitive function, exercise had
the greatest beneficial effect on higher level executive processes
[g = 0.68 (SE = 0.052, n = 37, p < 0.05)]. It is important to
note that the meta-analysis conducted by Colcombe and Kramer
included only exercise interventions. Exercise is a sub-type of
physical activity that has the distinct features of being planned
and structured, with the goal of improving fitness (Hill et al.,
2015). Exercise is typically associated with a higher intensity
of physical activity than daily incidental activities, and may
therefore confer greater cognitive benefits. In a subsequent meta-
analysis including more recent studies but limiting inclusion
to randomized controlled trials (n = 19), Smith et al. (2010)
reported a beneficial but more modest effect of exercise on EF
compared with the analysis of Colcombe and Kramer [g = 0.123
(95% CI:0.021 to 0.225), p = 0.018].
KEY CONCEPT 2 | Physical activity
Physical activity is defined as “any bodily movement produced by skeletal
muscle that results in energy expenditure” (Caspersen et al., 1985), and
encompasses a broad range of activities from every day “incidental” activity
such as active commuting or dog walking, to more structured, planned,
purposive activities like team sports, or fitness classes.
More recently, reviews have sought to better understand this
relationship in different age groups and for specific facets
of EF. Guiney and Machado (2013) found that in older
adults, intervention studies indicate that regular aerobic exercise
can improve task switching, selective attention, inhibition of
prepotent responses, and working memory span. Although they
concluded that there is a paucity of studies in young adults
and children, the limited available evidence supports a beneficial
effect of physical activity on task switching, selective attention,
inhibitory control, and working memory updating in young
adults, and working memory capacity, selective attention and
inhibitory control, in children. Kelly et al. (2014) conducted
a meta-analysis investigating the effect of different modes of
activity on a range of EF components. Resistance training
was found to have beneficial effects on measures of reasoning,
while Tai Chi improved measures of attention and processing
speed.
Collectively these findings provide a convincing body of
evidence to support the beneficial effects of physical activity on
EF. A broad set of animal and human studies has also shed
light on the neurobiological pathways through which increased
activity levels improve cognitive function.
FROM ACTIVITY TO BETTER COGNITIVE
FUNCTION: POTENTIAL MECHANISMS
A detailed review of the possible neurobiological processes
driving the association between activity and cognitive function
is beyond the scope of this review, and is available elsewhere
(Voss et al., 2013b). However, we provide an overview of the
mechanisms and mechanism measurements in Figure 1. The
flow of this figure represents the direction of benefit from
physical activity to improved cognitive abilities, while also
highlighting that investigations begin with animal-based studies
which serve to inform subsequent studies in humans. The
proposed mechanisms by which physical activity may improve
cognitive function fall broadly into three categories: (1) increased
levels of neurotrophins, (2) neurogenesis and changes in brain
structure, and (3) angiogenesis.
Neurotrophins are a class of growth factor consisting of
proteins that bring about the survival, development, and function
of neurons. Maintenance or increases in these neurotrophins
are thought to confer neuroprotective benefits. One of the most
abundant neurotrophins is brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF). A number of animal studies have shown exercise-
dependent changes in BDNF in the brain and upregulation
of central BDNF expression in response to activity (Neeper
et al., 1995, 1996; Liu et al., 2009; Hopkins et al., 2011; Marlatt
et al., 2012; Hong et al., 2015). In humans, physical activity has
been shown to increase circulating levels of BDNF—a proxy
for central expression (Knaepen et al., 2010; Zoladz and Pilc,
2010; Kim et al., 2014; Leckie et al., 2014). Neurotrophins such
as BDNF may promote cognitive benefits in several different
ways, including by neural survival (Baydyuk and Xu, 2014)
and improved synaptic plasticity (Leal et al., 2014), and also
through the stimulation of neurogenesis (i.e., the formation of
new neurons) and related changes in brain structure (Binder and
Scharfman, 2004).
Neurogenesis is considered to be positive, and whilst
neurogenesis continues throughout life it generally declines
with age. In animals, physical activity brings about considerable
growth of new neurons in both young and old brains (van
Praag et al., 1999a,b; van Praag et al., 2005; Inoue et al.,
2015; Sung, 2015; Nokia et al., 2016). In humans it is not
possible to study neurogenesis at the cellular level using non-
invasive techniques. However, imaging techniques allow for the
investigation of the effect of physical activity on brain structure
and integrity via changes in gray and white matter. Studies
using such imaging techniques have observed physical activity-
associated increases in hippocampal volume (Erickson et al.,
2011; Niemann et al., 2014; Thomas et al., 2015), gray matter
volume in the prefrontal, frontal, and lateral temporal cortices
(Colcombe et al., 2006; Flöel et al., 2010; Ruscheweyh et al., 2011;
Köbe et al., 2015), and in frontal and temporal white matter
integrity (Voss et al., 2013a; Tian et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2015b).
While this evidence is suggestive of physical activity-induced
neurogenesis, we recognize that the imaging techniques used for
such in vivo human studies rely on correlations to indirectly
quantify neurogenesis, and it is likely that much of the observed
growth may be due to angiogenesis, synaptogenesis, changes in
myelin, and other neural growth processes in addition to the birth
of new neurons.
Finally, physical activity may influence cognitive function via
angiogenesis in the brain, i.e., the formation of blood vessels
from existing vasculature. Brain angiogenesis is thought to be

stimulated by increased blood flow to the brain during exercise,
thus facilitating increased growth and functioning of many of
the brain structures and processes responsible for cognition.
Brain endothelial cell development (Lopez-Lopez et al., 2004)
and angiogenesis (Kleim et al., 2002; Swain et al., 2003; Gao
et al., 2014) are promoted in response to physical activity. The
physiological mechanisms responsible for increased angiogenesis
include elevated phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide
synthase, raised levels of bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells,
and subsequent endothelial or mechanical mechanisms leading
to neovascularization and correction of endothelial dysfunction
(Huber-Abel et al., 2012; Schmidt et al., 2013).
In addition to these three proposed mechanisms of physical
activity-induced improvements in EF, there is also a body of
in vitro and ex-vivo evidence to support a beneficial effect of
physical activity on reduced inflammatory markers (Ertek and
Cicero, 2012). Given that increased levels of inflammation are
associated with reduced EF performance (Trollor et al., 2012),
the inflammation-reducing effect of physical activity may be an
additional mechanism by which physical activity benefits the EFs.
Regardless of the exact set of pathways which leads exercise
to have a beneficial effect on cognitive health, it is apparent
that engaging in physical activity brings positive cognitive
consequences, particularly to the EFs. Physical activity, however,
is part of a broader set of health behaviors capable of producing
marked changes in executive functioning.
COGNITIVE EFFECTS OF DIET, SMOKING,
AND DRUG USE
Several large well-conducted studies have demonstrated that
the positive influence of health behavior on the EFs extends
beyond physical activity. For example, Valls-Pedret et al. (2015)
randomized 446 participants (mean age, 70 years) over a 6 year
period to follow different diets. Those allocated to eat a
Mediterranean diet (high in fruit, vegetables, and fish) with the
additional supplement of olive oil had significantly better EF post
intervention than controls, as measured by the trail making test (a
measure of flexible switching of attention). The cognitive benefits
of this type of diet were also observed in a longitudinal study
of 527 older Australian adults. Adherence to a Mediterranean-
style diet was associated with reduced decline in EF scores at
36 months, measured using the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function
System, whereas Western diet adherence (high in red meat,
refined grains, dairy, sugar) was associated with greater cognitive
decline at 36 months (Gardener et al., 2015). Similarly, greater
monounsaturated fat (i.e., the “good” fat found in large quantities
in the Mediterranean diet) intake has been associated with
reduced cognitive decline after 3 years in a cohort of 842 women
(Naqvi et al., 2011). Such effects appear to be robust over long
time periods: Zhu et al. (2015a) conducted a 25-year longitudinal
study of 2435 men and woman, assessing their diet quality at
baseline and EF at years 5 and 25. They found that a higher

 Allan et al.
Executive Function and Health Behavior
quality diet (measured as high consumption of healthy foods
and low consumption of unhealthy foods) was associated with
better EF scores at year 5 and year 25 (as measured by the
Stroop test). The mechanism by which healthy diets, and in
particular the Mediterranean diet, positively influence cognitive
health likely stems from the high levels of antioxidants and anti-
inflammatory agents present in the foods that comprise these
diets. These agents are thought to mitigate oxidative processes
in the brain, thereby protecting against neurodegeneration,
whilst simultaneously promoting neurogenesis and bolstering
neurotrophic factors (Huhn et al., 2015).
In contrast to the cognitive-enhancing effects of a healthy
diet, smoking and substance use appear to have negative effects
on cognition. Smoking is reliably related to a decline in general
cognitive function (Ott et al., 2004; Almeida et al., 2011; Corley
et al., 2012; Mons et al., 2013). When the impact of smoking
on the EFs in particular is considered, the evidence is more
limited but in the direction anticipated. For example, in 127
healthy older adults, Razani et al. (2004) reported that heavy
smokers performed more poorly on tests of EF than moderate
smokers and light/never smokers, suggesting a possible dose-
response relationship between smoking and EF. Similarly, Sabia
et al. (2012) performed a longitudinal analysis of 5099 men and
2137 women and found a greater rate of decline in executive
functioning for current male smokers compared with male never
smokers [mean difference in 10-year decline = −0.11 (95% CI:
−0.17; −0.05)]. Interestingly, they also observed that recent ex-
smokers had greater cognitive decline [−0.08 (−0.14; −0.02)]
than long-term ex-smokers (who had a similar rate of cognitive
decline as never smokers) suggesting that the detrimental effect
of smoking may be reversible. The damaging effect of smoking
on the EFs may be explained in part by the loss of gray matter
volume seen in smokers in the prefrontal cortex and the anterior
cingulate cortex, areas critically involved in higher level cognitive
processing (Almeida et al., 2011; Fritz et al., 2014).
Drug and alcohol use have also been linked with changes in
executive functioning. In addition to the acute detrimental effects
of alcohol on EF (Montgomery et al., 2011; Marinkovic et al.,
2012), chronic alcohol consumption causes increased levels of
executive dysfunction (Joyce and Robbins, 1991; Moselhy et al.,
2001; Brokate et al., 2003), which are maintained even once
individuals are detoxified (Kopera et al., 2012). Cannabis use has
also been linked to both short-term temporary impairment to
attentional and information processing abilities, and longer-term
permanent consequences in relation to impaired decision making
and increased propensity to engage in risk taking behaviors
(Crean et al., 2011). Similarly, cocaine use is associated with
impaired inhibition (Kaufman et al., 2003; Hester and Garavan,
2004), and heroin users demonstrate increased impulsivity and
poor planning abilities (Pau et al., 2000; Baldacchino et al.,
2015), all deficits indicative of impaired EF. This effect may
well be cumulative as polysubstance users (i.e., individuals
regularly taking more than one type of drug) exhibit greater EF
impairment across multiple domains than others (Verdejo et al.,
2004; Fernández-Serrano et al., 2010).
It is important to note that the causal nature of the proposed
associations between drug use and cognitive impairment in
humans requires further research as most studies to date have not
adjusted for potential confounding factors that could predispose
people to both drug use and cognitive decline (e.g., family
environment, personality traits, genetic factors) (Daly, 2013;
Jackson et al., 2016). However, a range of studies have pointed
to mechanistic processes that may produce such impairments.
For instance, alcohol-related cognitive decline has been linked to
neuronal damage and decreased neurogenesis (Nixon and Crews,
2002; Tateno and Saito, 2008) and cannabis-related cognitive
impairment has been associated with reduced hippocampal
volume (Yücel et al., 2008) or dysfunctional brain activation in
the left cerebellum and the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex (Bolla
et al., 2005). Cocaine use has been associated with reduced gray
matter concentration (Franklin et al., 2002; Matochik et al., 2003)
and decreased regional cerebral blood flow (Ernst et al., 2000)
caused by constriction of coronary and cerebral vessels.
In this section we have shown how certain health behaviors
(namely physical activity, diet, and drug use) can both positively
and negatively impact executive functioning. Understanding the
impact that these different health behaviors have on executive
functioning is important in itself, however, improved EF is not
necessarily the endpoint. In all likelihood, changes in EF strength
or efficiency will lead to associated changes in the ability to engage
in planned health-related behaviors in future, that is, EF may be
both a consequence of and a predictor of further engagement
in healthy behaviors. In the following section we look more
closely at the role of the executive functions for initiating and
maintaining health-related behaviors.
EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AS A
DETERMINANT OF HEALTHY BEHAVIOR
In addition to benefiting from engagement in healthy behaviors
such as physical activity and healthy diet, EF is also likely
to be necessary for the initiation and maintenance of such
behaviors. Healthy behaviors typically involve short-term costs in
the pursuit of longer-term benefits (Chapman, 2005). Important
outcomes such as weight loss, fitness and health are all
achieved by effortfully and consistently changing behavior in
the present, e.g., by effortfully eating healthy foods, by not
smoking, by drinking less alcohol, by going for a walk, and so
on. Consequently, it is logical that good EF—the capacity to
effortfully and strategically control behavior in pursuit of future
goals—should improve the chances that people will be able to
initiate and maintain health-relevant behaviors in order to obtain
health outcomes.
Theoretical models of EF suggest that EF will be heavily
involved in any situation requiring (1) planning and decision-
making, (2) error monitoring and correction, (3) sequencing of
actions, (4) complex actions, (5) inhibition of habitual responses
or resistance to attractive stimuli, or (6) novel actions (Norman
and Shallice, 1986). With this in mind, it is clear why EF
is likely to be involved in the enactment of health protective
behaviors. Taking the example of physical activity: activities must
be planned, decisions must be made about when and where to
be active, failures of activity intentions (e.g., failures to cycle

5

 Allan et al.
Executive Function and Health Behavior
to work, periods of sedentary behavior) must be detected and
compensated for to maintain progress toward the goal, actions
must be sequenced (e.g., alarm clock set earlier, appropriate
clothing put on, change of clothes packed for work, etc),
temptation from enjoyable but sedentary activities (e.g., watching
tv) must be resisted, and solutions to novel problems (e.g., how
to be active if weather precludes the planned activity) must be
generated.
This intuitive role of EF in the initiation and maintenance
of effortful health behaviors has been formalized in Hall and
Fong’s Temporal Self-Regulation Theory (TST; Hall and Fong,
2007, 2013, 2015). TST proposes that an individual’s ability
to engage in health behaviors that have short-term costs and
longer-term benefits (like dieting or going to the gym) will be
directly related to their natural executive control ability, and
in particular to their ability to inhibit prepotent responses.
Specifically, people with strong EF will be more likely to turn
their healthy intentions into action, as they will be more able to
resist temptation/suppress previous habits/inhibit responses to
unhelpful cues in the environment. Such individuals may also
be more likely to avoid temptation in the first place (Hofmann
et al., 2012a), again improving the chances that intentions will
be successfully enacted. When such ideas are empirically tested,
individual differences in EF do indeed seem to moderate the
strength of association between intentions and health behaviors
(Hall et al., 2008b). Current dieters who have strong response
inhibition are more likely to successfully resist temptation and
to lose weight than those with similar diet goals but weak
response inhibition (Hofmann et al., 2014). Smokers who show
increased activation in brain regions consistently associated with
response inhibition and conflict detection (right inferior frontal
gyrus, pre supplementary motor area, and basal ganglia) during
a response inhibition task are less likely to smoke in response
to cravings than others (Berkman et al., 2011). Individuals
scoring highly on a test of prepotent response inhibition (the
“Go/No-Go” task) show far closer correspondence between how
much physical activity they intend to take and how much they
actually take than those scoring poorly (Hall et al., 2008b). The
proportion of variance in physical activity behavior explained by
the combination of intentions and EF in the latter study was 59%,
almost double the amount typically explained by intentions alone
(Sheeran, 2002).
KEY CONCEPT 3 | Temporal Self-Regulation Theory (TST)
TST proposes three proximal determinants of behavior: intention, prepotency
(i.e., “the likelihood of performance of a given behavior as a function of habit,
cues to action, or internal drive states”), and executive function (Hall and Fong,
2007). These proximal determinants are further influenced by the context in
which they are required to be used—different situations will require prepotency
and the executive functions to be engaged to varying degrees. Situations where
there are short term costs and only long term benefits are hypothesized to
require more executive control resources to enact. Additionally, intentions are
determined by underlying beliefs and values that have been shaped by personal
history and external factors.
In line with TST, research evidence from many different
areas and disciplines indicates that EF is predictably related
to the enactment and maintenance of a wide range of health
behaviors which would be expected to require effortful self-
control. Individuals with strong EF (relative to those with weak
EF) have been shown to be more likely to stick to their stated
dietary intentions (Allan et al., 2011), more likely to enact
physical activity intentions (Hall et al., 2008a,b), more likely to
regularly attend exercise classes (McAuley et al., 2011), more
likely to successfully quit smoking (Brega et al., 2008; Nestor et al.,
2011), less likely to drink to excess or develop problems with
alcohol (Fernie et al., 2013), less likely to consume fatty foods
(Hall, 2012), less likely to give in to dietary temptation (Allan
et al., 2010), and more likely to correctly adhere to medication
regimes (Stilley et al., 2010, Panos et al., 2014).
Evidence that is particularly indicative of a causal role for
EF in determining future health behavior comes from cohort
and experimental studies of young adults and adolescents. For
example, when young, alcohol-naive adolescents are followed up
over a 2-year period, the strength of their executive functioning at
baseline significantly predicts when they begin drinking alcohol
and whether or not they engage in binge drinking (Peeters et al.,
2015). In line with expectations, those with weak EF engage
in alcohol consumption sooner than peers with stronger EF
suggesting that EF may be required to resist the temptation
to engage. Similarly, when adolescents are followed up over a
6-month period, EF prospectively predicts increases in alcohol
consumption, but the reverse is not true: alcohol consumption
does not prospectively predict decreases in EF (Fernie et al.,
2013). This is important, as while it is well-established in older
participants that alcohol consumption can lead to cognitive
deficits and impairments in EF over time, these results indicate
that in adolescence, alcohol consumption, and EF may be
associated because weak EF leads prospectively to higher levels
of drinking.
Further evidence suggesting a causal relationship between
EF strength and health behavior comes from experimental
studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a
technique where the activity in particular areas of cortex
can be reduced using electromagnetic pulses. When TMS is
directed at the brain region primarily associated with executive
functioning (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or DLPFC)
to temporarily knock EF “offline,” performance on EF tests
decreases and a corresponding reduction in dietary self-control
is observed. Specifically, both self-reported snack food cravings
and objectively measured snack food consumption are shown to
increase in the period immediately following DLPFC stimulation
(Lowe et al., 2014). This is in line with fMRI studies of cravings
which demonstrate that left DLPFC activation is increased when
self-control is exerted (Hare et al., 2009) and is directly associated
with the cognitive down-regulation of experienced cravings for
both unhealthy foods and cigarettes (Kober et al., 2010).
A wide-range of neuroimaging studies have also linked
structural differences in prefrontal regions including cortical
thickness, white matter integrity, and gray matter volume to
performance on EF tasks (Albinet et al., 2012). These linkages are
of particular interest given that age-related structural changes in
frontal regions may underpin later life changes in EF which could
have implications for health behavior. Indeed, the prefrontal
regions that support EF have been shown to be particularly

Executive Function and Health Behavior
vulnerable to adverse age-related structural changes in a range
of gray and white matter properties (Voineskos et al., 2012).
Such changes have been proposed to disrupt the connectivity
and integrity of functional networks producing a corresponding
decline in cognitive functioning (Marstaller et al., 2015). We
anticipate that such neurobiologically mediated changes in the
efficiency of the EFs may contribute to difficulties in initiating
and maintaining healthy patterns of behavior.
THE CASE FOR RECIPROCITY
As there is a rapidly accumulating body of evidence supporting
both the idea that EF is required to sustain patterns of health-
promoting behavior, and that engaging in health behavior
improves EF, it is highly likely that the observed relationship
is reciprocal. In our own work, we find evidence that when
older adults have both their cognitive functioning and physical
activity behavior repeatedly assessed over a 6 year period,
higher levels of physical activity predict stronger EF from one
time point to the next, and stronger EF predicts increases in
physical activity form one time point to the next (Daly et al.,
2015). Similarly, improvements in EF arising during a physical
activity intervention have been shown to predict subsequent
exercise adherence 1 year later (Best et al., 2014). It seems
that physical activity and EF are synergistic—they improve one
another.
As well as being self-reinforcing, the relationship between
physical activity and EF may produce additional benefits by
fostering improvements in other health enhancing behaviors.
This cross-fertilization could occur because the physiological
effects of sustained patterns of physical activity lead to
improvements in EF which facilitate better planning, initiation,
monitoring, and control of other goal-directed health behaviors
(Loprinzi et al., 2013, 2015). Whilst we use the example of
physical activity, this process could be set in motion by any
health behavior that produces changes in the efficiency of the
operation of the executive system. Thus even in the absence of
intervention there could be cumulative effects whereby health
behaviors sustain both EF and each other over time, enhancing
healthy functioning, and longevity.
This cyclical process, outlined in Figure 2, goes some way
toward explaining why EF efficiency is related to key health
outcomes such as weight gain over time (Guxens et al., 2009), 10-
year survival (Duff et al., 2009), and rates of chronic illness (Hall
et al., 2010). Individuals with stronger EF will be better equipped,
and therefore more likely than others to successfully engage in
the types of behavior associated with healthy weight, reduced
disease risk and progression, and mortality. By virtue of engaging
in these behaviors, their EF will improve, further improving the
chance that they will continue to engage in healthy behaviors
over time. The existence of such a reciprocal relationship is
encouraging from the perspective of intervention development
as it suggests that interventions which promote either health
promoting behaviors or more efficient EF may have the capacity
to produce both cognitive and physical health benefits over
time.
IMPLICATIONS FOR INTERVENTIONS AND
THE STUDY OF AGING
If health behaviors and EF are indeed reciprocally linked by a
positive feedback loop, the opportunities for, and potential gains
of, interventions may be increased markedly. Health behavior
change interventions aimed at improving diet, increasing activity
levels, reducing smoking, or alcohol consumption would have
the potential to produce not only direct benefits for physical and
cognitive health, but also to incrementally increase the future
likelihood that individuals are capable of maintaining these
beneficial behaviors over time.
To give a concrete example: an intervention designed to
increase physical activity gives participants a pedometer to
wear (e.g., Talbot et al., 2003). Through increased awareness
of goal progress and motivation arising from self-monitoring
of activity levels, participants manage to increase their daily
physical activity levels. A reciprocal relationship between health
behavior and EF would suggest that as this new physical activity
behavior is enacted, beneficial effects on EF will accrue over
time. As EF improves, logically so will the participant’s ability
to effortfully sustain their new activity behavior, to resist the
temptation of inactivity and to deal flexibly with challenges
to goal attainment. Positive outcomes in one domain would
be expected to beget positive outcomes in the other, thereby
progressively strengthening the link between physical activity and
EF over time.
Similarly, improvements in EF accrued as a result of
cognitive interventions designed to improve EF (e.g., through
cognitive training or mindfulness meditation: Ball et al., 2002;
Willis et al., 2006) could enable participants to successfully
achieve and maintain changes to health relevant behaviors.
Regardless of whether an intervention begins with health
behavior or cognitive function, the resulting benefits are likely to
encompass both domains and to become increasingly apparent
over time (assuming the target behavior is maintained). It
is already established that interventions designed to improve
inhibitory control through cognitive training produce a small but
consistently beneficial reduction in health risk behaviors (Allom
et al., 2016). Future research needs to assess the ongoing effects of
such benefits.
In
particular,
experimental
evidence
suggests
that
a
growing set of intervention strategies (e.g., yoga, martial
arts, computerized training, meditation) may effectively promote
the EFs when they are particularly amenable to change through
experience and practice between the ages of 4 and 12 years
(Anderson, 2002; Diamond and Lee, 2011; Hsu et al., 2014).
Furthermore, quasi-experimental evidence suggests that broader
strategies such as increasing the amount of time adolescents
spend in formal education may also impact beneficially on
cognitive functioning and the EFs specifically (Banks and
Mazzonna, 2012; Lager et al., 2016). By producing improvements
in the EF during key developmental periods such interventions
may help set in motion the proposed cyclical relationships
between executive functioning and health behaviors.
It is possible that more efficient EF could directly shape the
formation of patterns of health behavior in adolescence leading

to long-term consequences for cognitive function. For example,
adolescents with a greater inhibitory capacity have been shown
to be less likely to start smoking, avoiding what tends to be
a lifelong habit with notable adverse consequences for the EFs
(Almeida et al., 2011; Mons et al., 2013; Daly et al., in press).
It is also possible that EF could indirectly influence health
behavior through promoting greater educational attainment
which is known to contribute to healthier lifestyles throughout
life (Arendt, 2005; St Clair-Thompson and Gathercole, 2006; Bull
et al., 2008).
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE
DIRECTIONS
The cyclical model of EF and health outlined in Figure 2
shows that health behavior elicits physiological responses

and

Numerous

age.
The
potential
neurobiological
mechanisms underlying these protective effects have also been
explicated, particularly in the case of physical activity where
animal studies have shed light on the impact of activity on
neurotrophin levels, synaptic plasticity, and the growth and
development of nervous tissue and blood vessels (see Voss et al.,
2013b).
It is only recently that research has begun to uncover the
role of EFs in shaping complex health behaviors. Such behaviors
require planning, sequencing of actions, ongoing monitoring,
and adjustment following error detection, and the inhibition
of impulsive responses to situational cues, visceral desires and

environmental distractions (Mullen and Hall, 2015). When EFs
are weak, automatic responses have been shown to predominate
and health-enhancing intentions to fail (Allan et al., 2010, 2011).
Similarly, individuals with low levels of trait self-control may
experience more failures of health-enhancing intentions because
they are less likely to actively avoid temptation (Hofmann et al.,
2012a). Ultimately, the cumulative effect of lower levels of EF
is theorized to be a pervasive inability to execute goal-directed
health behaviors resulting in physiological dysfunction and poor
health. We propose that this triggers the cycle once again,
adversely affecting EF and leading to a self-reinforcing dynamic
relationship between EFs and health behaviors over time.
Future research would benefit from further testing of the less
well-established pathways in the model outlined in Figure 2. For
example, observational studies could be used to test whether
a positive feedback loop exists whereby health-enhancing
behaviors optimize EF and whether this contributes to the
successful maintenance of a healthy lifestyle over time. A range of
large scale studies have collected multi-wave data on EF and key
health behaviors allowing the suggested mechanistic pathways of
the model to be mapped using representative population samples
(e.g., Steptoe et al., 2013; Sonnega et al., 2014). These studies often
gauge a broad set of biological markers and indicators of disease,
allowing the downstream physiological effects of high levels of EF
to be charted.
In addition to observational studies, intervention studies
that are effective in increasing cognitive control and enhancing
facets of EF (e.g., Jaeggi et al., 2008; Diamond and Lee,
2011; Anguera et al., 2013) could be used to identify the
influence of EF on health behavior. As such, a virtuous cycle
could be identified whereby EF-enhancing interventions may
reduce the size of the gap between “good” intentions and
health behavior (Allan et al., 2011). By including measures
of both health behaviors and intentions to perform those
behaviors, EF-enhancing intervention studies could provide a
more comprehensive account of the potential positive effects
of such interventions. Furthermore, the cyclical model also
suggests that intervention studies that are successful in producing
sustained improvements in target behaviors such as physical
activity or diet (e.g., Astrup et al., 2000; Hunt et al., 2014) could
improve engagement in other non-targeted health behaviors by
increasing efficient executive control. Incorporating measures
of EF and a range of other non-target health behaviors into
interventions targeting a specific health behavior would allow this
possibility to be tested.
Given the current situation where the age-related decline in
EF impairs the ability of older people to live independently,
evidence generated from such studies would help establish
the nature of the reciprocal relationship between EF and
health behavior and lay the groundwork for an integrated
approach to the development of empowering interventions that
simultaneously promote cognitive enhancement and healthy
aging.
