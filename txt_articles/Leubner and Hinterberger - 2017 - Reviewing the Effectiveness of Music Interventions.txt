Depression is a very common mood disorder, resulting in a loss of social function,
reduced quality of life and increased mortality. Music interventions have been shown
to be a potential alternative for depression therapy but the number of up-to-date
research literature is quite limited. We present a review of original research trials which
utilize music or music therapy as intervention to treat participants with depressive
symptoms. Our goal was to differentiate the impact of certain therapeutic uses of
music used in the various experiments. Randomized controlled study designs were
preferred but also longitudinal studies were chosen to be included. 28 studies with a
total number of 1,810 participants met our inclusion criteria and were finally selected.
We distinguished between passive listening to music (record from a CD or live music)
(79%), and active singing, playing, or improvising with instruments (46%). Within certain
boundaries of variance an analysis of similar studies was attempted. Critical parameters
were for example length of trial, number of sessions, participants’ age, kind of music,
active or passive participation and single- or group setting. In 26 studies, a statistically
significant reduction in depression levels was found over time in the experimental (music
intervention) group compared to a control (n = 25) or comparison group (n = 2). In
particular, elderly participants showed impressive improvements when they listened to
music or participated in music therapy projects. Researchers used group settings more
often than individual sessions and our results indicated a slightly better outcome for
those cases. Additional questionnaires about participants confidence, self-esteem or
motivation, confirmed further improvements after music treatment. Consequently, the
present review offers an extensive set of comparable data, observations about the range
of treatment options these papers addressed, and thus might represent a valuable aid
for future projects for the use of music-based interventions to improve symptoms of
depression.

Effectiveness of Music Interventions
INTRODUCTION
“If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often
think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms
of music.”
−Einstein, 1929.
Depression is one of the most serious and frequent mental
disorders
worldwide.
International
studies
predict
that
approximately 322 million (WHO, 2017) of the world’s
population suffer from a clinical depression. This disorder
can occur from infancy to old age, with women being affected
more often than men (WHO, 2017). Thus, depression is one
of the most common chronic diseases. Depressive suffering is
associated with psychological, physical, emotional, and social
impairments. This can influence the whole human being in a
fundamental way. Without clinical treatment, it has the tendency
to recur or to take a chronic course that can lead to loneliness
(Alpass and Neville, 2003) and an increasing social isolation (Teo,
2012). Depression can have many causes that range from genetic,
over psychological factors (negative self-concept, pessimism,
anxiety and compulsive states, etc.) to psychological trauma. In
addition, substance abuse (Neighbors et al., 1992) or chronic
diseases (Moussavi et al., 2007) can also trigger depression.
The colloquial use of the term “depressed” has nothing to do
with the depression in the clinical sense. The ICD-10 (WHO,
1992) and the DSM-V (APA, 2013) provide a classification
based on symptoms, considering the patient’s history and its
severity, duration, course and frequency. Within the last two
decades, research on the use of music medicine or music therapy
to treat depression, showed a growing popularity and several
publications have appeared that documented this movement
(e.g., Lee, 2000; Loewy, 2004; Esfandiari and Mansouri, 2014;
Verrusio et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2016; Fancourt et al., 2016).
However, most researchers used a very specific experimental
setup (Hillecke et al., 2005) and thus, for example, focused only
on one music genre (i.e., classical, modern; instrumental, vocal),
used a predefined experimental setup (group or individual)
(e.g., Kim et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2016), or specified precisely
the age range (i.e., adolescents, elderly) of participants (e.g.,
Koelsch et al., 2010; Verrusio et al., 2014). A recent meta-analysis
(Hole et al., 2015) reviewed 72 randomized controlled trials
and concluded that music was a notable aid for reducing
postoperative symptoms of anxiety and pain.
Dementia patients showed significant cognitive and emotional
benefits when they sang, or listened to familiar songs (Särkämö
et al., 2008, 2014). Beneficial effects were also described for
CNMP (Chronic Non-Malignant Pain) patients with depression
(Siedliecki and Good, 2006)1. Cardiology is an area where music
interventions are commonly used for intervention purposes.
Various explanations were postulated and the broad range of
effects on the cardiovascular system was investigated (Trappe,
1Participants in the two music groups (standard or patterning music) showed an
increased belief in their personal power as well as a reduction in pain, depression
and disability, compared to the relevant control group. The two experimental
groups listened to 1 h of music each day for 7 days in a row.
2010; Hanser, 2014). Music as a therapeutic approach was
evaluated (Gold et al., 2004), and found to have positive effects
before heart surgery (Twiss et al., 2006), used to increase
relaxation during angiography (Bally et al., 2003), or decrease
anxiety (Do˘
gan and Senturan, 2012; Yinger and Gooding, 2015).
A systematic review (Jespersen et al., 2015) concluded that
music improved subjective sleep quality in adults with insomnia,
verbal memory in children (Chan et al., 1998; Ho et al., 2003),
and episodic long-term memory (Eschrich et al., 2008). Music
conveyed a certain mood or atmosphere (Husain et al., 2002),
allowed composers to trigger emotions (Bodner et al., 2007;
Droit-Volet et al., 2013), based on the cultural background
(Balkwill and Thompson, 1999), or ethnic group (Werner et al.,
2009) someone belonged to. In contrast, the emotional state itself
plays a role (Al’tman et al., 2004) on how music is interpreted
(Al’tman et al., 2000), and durations are evaluated (Schäfer et al.,
2013). Subjective impressions embedded in a composition caused
physiological body reactions (Grewe et al., 2007; Jäncke, 2008)
and even strengthened the immune system (McCraty et al.,
1996; Bittman et al., 2001). The pace of (background) music
(Oakes, 2003), has also been used as an essential element of many
marketing concepts (North and Hargreaves, 1999), to create a
relaxed atmosphere. An in-depth, detailed illustration described
the wide variety of conscious, as well as subconscious influences
music can have (Panksepp and Bernatzky, 2002), and endorsed
future research on this subject.
Distinction between the Terms “Music
Therapy [MT]” and “Music Medicine [MM]”
Most of us know what kind of music or song “can cheer us
up.” To treat someone else is something completely different
though. Therefore, evidence-based procedures were created for a
more pragmatic approach. It is important to differentiate between
music therapy and the therapeutic use of music. Music used
for patient treatment can be divided into two major categories,
namely [MT] and [MM], although the distinction is not always
that clear.
Music Therapy [MT]
Term used primarily for a setting, where sessions are provided
by a board-certified music therapist. Music therapy [MT]
(Maratos et al., 2008; Bradt et al., 2015) stands for the “...clinical
and evidence-based use of music interventions to accomplish
individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship by a
credentialed professional who has completed an approved music
therapy program” (AMTA)2. Many different fields of practice,
mostly in the health care system, show an increasing amount
of interest in [MT]. Mandatory is a systematic constructed
therapy process that was created by a board-certified music
therapist and requires an individual-specific music selection that
is developed uniquely for and together with the patient in one
or more sessions. Therapy settings are not limited to listening,
but may also include playing, composing, or interacting with
music. Presentations can be pre-recorded or live. In other cases

(basic) instruments are built together. The process to create these
tailor-made selections requires specific knowledge on how to
select, then construct and combine the most suitable stimuli or
hardware. It must also be noted that music therapy is offered as a
profession-qualifying course of study.
Music Medicine [MM] (i.e., Functional Music, Music in
Medicine)
Carried out independently by professionals, who are not
qualified music therapists, like relaxation therapists, physicians
or (natural) scientists. A previous consultation, or collaboration,
with a certified music therapist can be helpful (Register, 2002).
In recent years, significant progress has been made in both the
research and clinical application of music as a form of treatment.
It has valuable therapeutic properties, suitable for the treatment
of several diseases. The term “music medicine” is used as a term
for the therapeutic use of music in medicine (Bradt et al., 2015,
2016), to be able to differentiate it from “music therapy.” [MM]
stands for a medical, physiological and physical evaluation of the
use of music. If someone listens to his or her favorite music, this
is sometimes also considered as a form of music medicine. [MM]
deliberately differs from music therapy as part of psychiatric
care or psychotherapy. It is important to stress out that the
term “Music Therapy [MT]” should not be used for any kind
of treatment involving music, although there is without doubt a
relationship between [MT] and [MM]. What all of them have in
common is the focus on a scientifically, artistically or clinically
based approach to music.
“Seamless Transitions” between Music Therapy [MT]
and Music Medicine [MM]
Activity used for treatment is ambiguous or not clearly labeled
as “Music Therapy” or “Music Medicine.” It should not be
forgotten that the definition of “Music Therapy” is not always
clearly distinguishable from “Music Medicine.” One possible
scenario would be a physician (i.e., “non-professional”), who is
not officially certified by the AMTA (or comparable institutions),
but still acts according to the mandatory rules. In addition,
depending on one’s home country, uniform standards or
eligibility requirements might be substantially different. We think
that every effort should be recognized and therefore postulate one
definition that can describe the main principle of [MT], [MM],
and everything in between, in one sentence: “Implementation
of acoustic stimuli (“music”) as a medium for the purpose of
improving symptoms in a defined group of participants (patients)
suffering from depression.”
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Literature Search
Search strategy and selection process was performed according
to the recommended guidelines of the Cochrane Centre on
systematic literature search (Higgins and Green, 2008). Our
approach (Figure 2) was according to their scientific relevance,
supplemented by the analysis of relevant journals, conferences
and workshops of recent years. We obtained 60,795 articles
from various search engines as initial result. Retrieved data was
collected and processed on an existing personal computer with
the latest Windows operating system.
Search, Collection, Selection, and Review Strategies
We used a combination of words defining three search-
categories (Music-, Treatment-, and Depression associated)
as
well
as
several
words
(e.g.,
Sound,
Unhappy,
and
Treatment) assigned to each category as described in the
collection process.below. If synonyms of those keywords
were identified, they were added as well. Theme-categories3
were created next, then related keywords identified and
added into a table. “Boolean Operators4” were used as logical
connectives to broaden and/or narrow our search results
within many databases (mostly search engines as described
below).
This way the systematic variation of keyword-based queries
and search terms could be performed with much more efficiency.
To find the most relevant literature on the subject, keywords
were entered into various scientific search engines, namely
PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar. After the collection
process, several different steps were used to reduce the number
of retrieved results. Selection out of the collected material
included to narrow down search results to a limited period
of time. We decided to choose a period between 1990 and
2016 (i.e., not exceeding 26 years), because within these years
several very interesting works of research were published, but
often not mentioned explicitly, discussed in detail, or the
main target of a comparative review. After several papers
were excluded, a systematic key phrases search was conducted
once more to retrieve results, limited to original research
articles5. We also removed search results that quoted book
chapters, as well as reports from international congresses and
conferences. Research papers that remained were distinguished
from duplicates (or miss-matches not dismissed yet). Based
on our predefined criteria for in- and ex-clusion, relevant
publications were then selected for an intensified review process.
Our plan was to apply the following inclusion criteria: Original
research article, published at time of selection, music and/or
instruments were used intentionally to improve the emotional
status of participants (i.e., intended or officially confirmed as
music therapy). The following exclusion criteria were used:
No original research, article was not published (e.g., project
phase, in review), unverified data or literature was used,
participants did neither receive nor interact with music. Not
relevant for in- or exclusion was the kind of questionnaire
used to measure depression, additional diagnostic measures
for pathologies other than depression, spatial and temporal
implementation of treatment, demographics (i.e., number, age,

After the initial number of results, the remaining articles
were manually checked for completeness and accuracy of
information. Our final selection of articles included 28 research
papers.
General Information — (Figure 1)
Evaluating the Methodological Quality of Our
Meta-Review
During the review process, we used a very strict self-monitoring
procedure to ensure that the quality of scientific research was
met to the best of our knowledge and stood in accordance
with the standards of good scientific practice. Every effort
has been made to provide the accuracy of contents as well
as completeness of data published within our meta-review.
Inspired by another author’s meta-review (Kamioka et al.,
2014), we evaluated our work by the AMSTAR checklist
(Shea et al., 2007)6 and found no reasons for objection
regarding our selection of reviews. AMSTAR (acronym for
“Assessment of Multiple SysTemAtic Reviews”), a questionnaire
for assessing systemic reviews, is based on a rating scale with

in the AMSTAR-Checklist (Shea et al., 2007) are: (I) Was an “a priori” design

studies provided? (VII) Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed
and documented? (VIII) Was the scientific quality of the included studies used
appropriately in formulating conclusions? (IX) Were the methods used to combine
the findings of studies appropriate? (X) Was the likelihood of publication bias
assessed? (XI) Was any conflict of interest included?

FIGURE 2 | Overview of our Collection, Selection, and Review Process (idea, concept and creation of this Figure by Leubner). Initially, the total number of retrieved
results was 118,000 as far as google-scholar was concerned. Analysis was complicated by the disproportionately high number of results from google-scholar.
Therefore, we decided to narrow down this initial search query to a period from 1990 up to 2016, and reduced the results from google-scholar to 60,000 this way.
Compared to the other two search engines, this process was done two steps ahead. At google-scholar we excluded patents as well as citations in the initial window
for our search results. Unfortunately search options are very limited, and though we retrieved at first this overwhelming number of 118,000 results!. Some keywords
(e.g., anxiety, pain, fear, violence) were deliberately excluded right from the beginning. This was done right at the start of our selection/search process, to prevent a
systematic distortion of retrieved results.

Effect Size
We investigated a wide variety of scholarly papers within our
review. There were many different approaches and several

procedures. As far as intervention approaches and procedures
were concerned, we found (very) similar trends in several papers.
To ensure that those different tendencies were not only based
on our pure assumption as well as biased interpretation, we also
calculated the effect-size correlation by using the mean scores as
well as standard deviations for each of the treatment and control
groups, if this setup was used by the respective researcher. Most
trials showed a small difference in between the experimental and
control group at baseline, what almost always turned into a large
effect size regarding post-measurement.
Depression Score Improvement (DSI) — Approach to
Compare Questionnaires
As mentioned above, we selected 28 scholarly articles that used
different questionnaires to measure symptoms of depression
for experimental and control groups. According to common
statistical standards we used a formula to evaluate and compare
the relative standing of each mean to every other mean. To
avoid confusion, we decided to refer to it as “Depression Score
Improvement (DSI).” Mathematically speaking it stands for the
mean difference between the pre-test and post-test results (i.e.,
score changes) in percent. (DSIInd) stands for an individual and
(DSI{Gr) for a group setting. Please refer to the Supplementary
Materials (Table: “Complete Display of Statistical Data”)7 for
additional information.
RESULTS
The results will review the works in terms of demographics,
treatment implementation, and diagnostic measures.
Literature Search Results — (Figure 2)
Collection Process – Results
A large list of keywords, based on several questions we had,
was created initially. They were combined into search-terms
and finally put into search-categories as category-dependent
keywords. In addition, we discussed several parameters and
agreed on three categories (associated to music, treatment, and
depression). By querying scientific databases, using the above-
mentioned category-dependent keywords as input criteria, we
retrieved a very large number of results. We then searched for a
combination of the following words and/or phrases (e.g., “music
AND therapy AND depression”; “acoustic AND intervention
AND unhappy”), narrowed down the retrieved results according
to a combination of several keywords (e.g., “music therapy”;
“acoustic intervention”), and sorted this data according to
relevance.
Selection Process – Results
In step two we applied the above-mentioned approach and
narrowed down our search query to a limited period of time,
then systematically searched for key phrases, and excluded
duplicates as well as previously overlooked miss-matches. Our
inclusion criteria can be summarized as follows: Original research

article, already published at time of selection, music and/or
instruments were used intentionally to improve the emotional
status of participants. Our exclusion criteria were: No original
research, article was not published (e.g., project phase, in review),
unverified data or literature was used, participants did neither
receive nor interact with music.
Review Process – Results
Based on our predefined criteria for inclusion and exclusion,
relevant publications were then selected and used for our
intensified review process. After reducing the initial number of
results, we obtained the remaining articles, conducted a hand-
search in selected scientific journals, and manually checked for
completeness as well as accuracy of the contained information.
The final selection of articles, according to our selection criteria,
included 28 papers.
Demographics8
To begin with, the number of participants as well as age and
gender related basic demographics were analyzed.
Participants – Results
Our final selection of 28 studies included 1,810 participants, with
group sizes between five and 236 persons (nav = 64.64; SD =
56.13). For experimental groups, we counted 954 individuals
(nmin
= 5; nmax
= 116; nav
= 34.07; SD = 27.78), and
856 (nmin = 10; nmax = 120; nav = 30.57; SD = 29.10) for
the control respectively. Although three authors (Ashida, 2000;
Guétin et al., 2009b; Schwantes and Mckinney, 2010) did not
use a control sample, those articles were nevertheless considered
for calculating accurate and up-to-date data. Depending on
each review, sample groups differed profoundly in number of
participants. The smallest one had five participants (Schwantes
and Mckinney, 2010), followed by three authors (Hendricks et al.,
1999; Ashida, 2000; Guétin et al., 2009b) who used between 10
and 20 individuals in their clinical trials. Medium sized groups
of up to 100 participants were found in six articles (Gupta and
Gupta, 2005; Castillo-Pérez et al., 2010; Erkkilä et al., 2011; Wang
et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2013). Large groups with more than 100
(Koelsch et al., 2010; Silverman, 2011), or 200 (Chen et al., 2016)
participants were the exception, and 236 participants (Chang
et al., 2008) presented the upper end in our selection.
Age Groups – Results
Within our selected articles, the youngest participant was 14
(Hendricks et al., 1999), and the oldest 95 years of age (Guétin
et al., 2009a). We then separated relevant groups, according to
their age, into three categories, namely “young,” “medium,” and
“elderly.”
Young
Participants were defined as “young,” if their mean age was
below or equal to 30 years (≤30). Young individuals did show
minimal better (i.e., higher) depression score improvements
(DSI) (mean difference between the pre-test and post-test results

was calculated in percent), if they attended group (mean DSIGr =
53.83%)9, rather than individual (DSIInd
= 40.47%) music
intervention sessions. These results may be due to the beneficial
consequences of social interactions within groups, and thus
confirm previous study results (Garber et al., 2009; Tartakovsky,
2015).
Medium
We used the term “medium” for groups of participants, whose
mean ages ranged between 31 (>30) and 59 years (<60).
Medium-aged participants presented much better results (i.e.,
higher depression score improvements), if they attended a group
(mean DSIGr
= 48.37%), rather than an individual (mean
DSIInd = 24.79%) intervention setting. However, it should be
stressed that our findings only show a positive trend and thus
should not be evidence.
Elderly
The third and final group was defined by us as “elderly” and
included participants with a mean age of 60 years or above (≥60).
Noticeable results were found for the age group we defined as
elderly, as participants showed slightly better (i.e., higher) score
improvements (mean DSIInd = 48.96%), if they attended an
individual setting. Considering the music selection that had been
used for elderly participants, a strong tendency toward classical
compositions was found (e.g., Chan et al., 2010; Han et al.,
2011). Because a relevant number of participants came from
Asian countries (e.g., China, Korea), elderly people from those
research articles received, in addition to classical music, quite
often Asian oriented compositions as well. Despite our extensive
investigations, the influence this combination had on results,
remained uncertain. Positive tendencies within those groups
might be due to “traditional” and/or “culture related” factors. It is,
however, also conceivable that combining Western classical with
traditional Asian music is notably suited to produce better results.
Concerning this matter, future research on western depression
patients treated with a combination of classical Western, and
traditional Asian music might be a promising concept to be
further explored.
Gender – Results
As far as gender was concerned, we subdivided each sample
group in its female and male participants. Women and men
were found in 20 study designs. This was the most frequently
used constellation. Within this selection, we did not find any
significant differences, and so no further analysis was done.
Only women took part in two studies (Chang et al., 2008;
Esfandiari and Mansouri, 2014)10. Interestingly the same stimuli
setup was used in both cases. It consisted of instrumental
music without vocals, stored on a digital record, and was
presented via loudspeakers from a CD (Chang et al., 2008)
or MP3 player (Esfandiari and Mansouri, 2014). Only men

were seen in four research papers (Gupta and Gupta, 2005;
Schwantes and Mckinney, 2010; Albornoz, 2011; Chen et al.,
2016). A significant improvement of depression scores was
reported for every experimental group, and once (Albornoz,
2011) for a corresponding control setting (received only standard
and no alternative treatment). Three articles (Schwantes and
Mckinney, 2010; Albornoz, 2011; Chen et al., 2016) shared several
similarities, as percussion instruments (e.g., drums, tambourines)
were part of each genre selection, all participants received
music interventions in a group setting, and stimuli were actively
produced within a live performance. In addition, the BDI
questionnaire has also been used in three cases (Gupta and
Gupta, 2005; Albornoz, 2011; Chen et al., 2016), and thus we
were able to perform a search for similarities or tendencies. The
average duration for one music intervention was 80 (SD = 45)
min and the total number of sessions was 17 (SD = 5) in average.
Two publications (Hsu and Lai, 2004; Wang et al., 2011) did
not offer any information about gender related distribution of
participants.
Music Therapy [MT] vs. Music Medicine
[MM] — Study Results
Music-Therapy [MT]
Within our selection of 28 articles, six explicitly mentioned a
certified music therapist (Hanser and Thompson, 1994; Choi
et al., 2008; Schwantes and Mckinney, 2010; Erkkilä et al.,
2011; Han et al., 2011; Silverman, 2011)11. For five articles
with available data, a combined average depression score
improvement (DSI) of 40.87% (SD = 7.70%) was calculated for
the experimental groups. As far as the relevant control groups
were concerned, only twice depression scores decreased at all
(Choi et al., 2008; Erkkilä et al., 2011; Table 1).
Regarding the kind of music provided by a board-certified
music therapist, we found some similarities that stood out and
appeared more frequently, when compared to music medicine
interventions. Percussion music (mainly drumming) was used
by four researchers (Choi et al., 2008; Schwantes and Mckinney,
2010; Erkkilä et al., 2011; Han et al., 2011). One author
(Choi et al., 2008) used music based on instruments that
were selected according to participant’s preferences. Included
were, for example, egg shakes, base-, ocean-, and paddle-
drums. Participants actively played and passively listened to
instruments or sounds, complemented by singing together.
Another researcher (Erkkilä et al., 2011) preferred the African
Djembe12 drum as well as a selection of several percussion
sounds created digitally by an external MIDI (Musical Instrument
Digital Interface) synthesizer. Percussion-oriented improvisation
that included rhythmic drumming and vocal patterns was
another approach one scholar (Han et al., 2011) used for
his stimuli selection. Congas, Cabassas, Ago-Gos, and Claves
was the percussion-based selection (in addition a guitar and a
Piano was also available) in the fourth music-therapy article
11One [MT] music-therapy article (Silverman, 2011) was not used for comparison
and calculations because the relevant data was unavailable.
12Djembe is based on the expression “anke djé, anke bé” which roughly translates
as “everyone should come together in peace and harmony.”

Effectiveness of Music Interventions
(Schwantes and Mckinney, 2010). Twice, music without the use
of percussion instruments or drums in general, was selected
for the intervention. Once (Hanser and Thompson, 1994)
relaxing, slow and rhythmic harp-samples, played from a
cassette-player, were used. In addition, each of the participants
was invited to bring some samples of her or his favored
music titles. The second one (Silverman, 2011) decided to
play a “12-bar Blues” (i.e., “blues changes”)13 progression
as an introduction, followed by a Blues songwriting session.
The last-mentioned music-therapy project was the only article
out of six, where participants within their respective music
intervention group did not present a significant reduction of
depression. A very interesting “fund” was that none of the
music-therapy articles neither concentrated their main music
selection on classical, nor on Jazz music. When we looked for
other distinctive features it turned out that stimuli were actively
produced within a live performance in five articles. There was
only one exception (Hanser and Thompson, 1994), where a
passive presentation of recorded stimuli was preferred by the
scholar.
Music-Medicine [MM]
The remaining 22 research articles did not explicitly mention
a certified music therapist. In those cases, some variant of
music medicine was used for intervention. Often the expression
music therapy was used, although a more detailed description
or specific information was neither published nor available upon
our request. With one exception (Castillo-Pérez et al., 2010), we
could calculate the (DSI)9 for 25 articles that used some variant
of music-medicine [MM].
When we investigated the kind of music that was used, a
broader selection of genres was found. Percussion based tracks
and drumming appeared in five scholarly papers (Ashida, 2000;
Albornoz, 2011; Lu et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2016; Fancourt
et al., 2016). Researchers that used drums reported a significant
depression score improvement for every experimental group
and we calculated an average of 53.71% for those five articles.
Regarding the kind of genre used in our selection of music-
medicine articles, a wider range of genres was found. One of the
biggest differences was that only music-medicine articles used,
in addition to percussion stimuli, also classical and Jazz music
for their intervention. Please note that for reasons of confusion,
we do not mention the Seamless Transitions between Music
Therapy [MT] and Music Medicine [MM] from the “Materials
and Methods Section.”
Music Genres (Selection of Music Titles) –
Results
Regarding the kind of music used in our selection of research
articles, a wide range of genres was found. Mainly three styles,
1312-bar Blues: Traditional Blues pattern that is 12 measures long. This chord
progression is also used for many other music genres and quite popular in
pop-music.
classical14 (9x), percussion15 (9x), and Jazz (5x) music were
used more frequently for music intervention. The evaluation
took place when specific compositions showed significantly
greater improvements in depression compared to other research
attempts. Utilizing our comprehensive data analysis, music titles
were categorized according to genre or style (e.g., classical
music, Jazz), narrowed down (e.g., Jazz), sorted by magnitude
of depression score improvements (DSI)9, and finally examined
for distinctive features (like setting, duration, speakers, live
version, recorded). Similarities that stood out and appeared more
frequently among one selected music genre were compared with
the 28 scholarly articles we selected for our meta-review.
Classical Music – Results
In nine articles, classical music (Classical or Baroque period)22
was used. Several well-known composers such as W.A. Mozart
(Castillo-Pérez et al., 2010), L. v. Beethoven (Chang et al., 2008;
Chan et al., 2009) and J. S. Bach (Castillo-Pérez et al., 2010;
Koelsch et al., 2010) have been among the selected samples. If
classical music was used as intervention, our calculations revealed
that four studies out of eight16 were among those with depression
score improvements (DSI)31 that were above the average17 of
39.98% (SD = 12). When we looked for similarities between
these, three of the four studies (Harmat et al., 2008; Chan
et al., 2009; Guétin et al., 2009a) used individual sessions, rather
than a group setting (Koelsch et al., 2010). For all four articles
mentioned above, we calculated an average of 11 (SD = 10) for
the total number of sessions that included classical music. The
remaining five articles on the other hand, presenting results not
as good as the aforementioned, showed an average of 30 (SD
= 21) music interventions. One plausible hypothesis might be
“saturation effect” caused by too many interventions in total.
Too little variety within the selection of music titles has probably
played an important role as well. A general tendency that less
intervention sessions in total would lead to better results for every
case where classical compositions were included could not be
confirmed for our selection.
Percussion (Drumming-based) Music – Results
Percussion music (mainly drumming) was used by nine18
researchers, and among those, two ways of integration were
14Ambiguity of the term “classical” music: In our review, this term refers to
“Western Art Music” and thus includes, but is not limited to the “Classical”
music period. Most of the time we used this term for music from the Baroque
(1600–1750), Classical (1750–1820), and Romantic (1804–1910) period.
15Within percussion groups various types of drums presented the instrument of
choice most of the time.
16Eight out of nine articles because in on case (Castillo-Pérez et al., 2010) scores
were missing. The remaining were: Hsu and Lai, 2004; Chang et al., 2008; Harmat
et al., 2008; Chan et al., 2009, 2010; Guétin et al., 2009a; Koelsch et al., 2010;
Verrusio et al., 2014.
17Average: Arithmetic mean of all score-changes in [%] for a defined selection (e.g.,
classical music). Example: We calculated the score-change in [%] for each of the
eight experimental groups that received classical music as intervention. In this case
the arithmetic mean (DSIClas) was 39.98% (i.e., average). Then every individual
score can be compared to this average. If it was above, we called it “above average”.

Effectiveness of Music Interventions
found. On the one hand, rhythmic percussion compositions were
included as part of the music title selection used for intervention.
On the other hand, and this was the case in nine articles,
various forms of drums had been offered to those who joined
the experimental groups, allowing them to “produce their own”
music. Sometimes participants were accompanied by a music
therapist (e.g., Albornoz, 2011) or professional artist (Fancourt
et al., 2016), who gave instructions on how to use and play these
instruments. When we looked for trends or distinctive features
percussion music (in particular drumming) had, it turned out
that, except one article (Erkkilä et al., 2011), all were carried out
within a group, rather than an individual setting. A further search
for additional similarities, leading to better outcome scores, did
not deliver any new findings as far as improvement of depression
was concerned. Participants in altogether 7 out of 9 percussion
groups were medium aged, two authors (Ashida, 2000; Han
et al., 2011) described elderly participants, whereas none of the
percussion groups included young participants.
A wide and even distribution of reduced depression scores
across all outcome levels became apparent, when participants
received percussion (or drumming) interventions. We calculated
an average depression score improvement (DSI) of 47.80%
(SD = 14). Above-average results regarding depression score
improvement (DSI), were achieved in four experiments that had
an average percussion session duration of 63 (SD = 19) min.
In comparison, we calculated for the remaining five articles an
average of 93 (SD = 26) min. Although a difference of 30 min
showed a clear tendency, it was not enough of a difference to draw
any definitive conclusions.
Jazz Music – Results
Finally, five19 researchers used primarily Jazz20 as music genre
for their intervention. Featured performers (artists) were Vernon
Duke (“April in Paris”) (Chan et al., 2009), M. Greger (“Up
to Date”), and Louis Armstrong (“St. Louis Blues”) (Koelsch
et al., 2010). Unfortunately, available data was quite limited,
mainly since most authors did not disclose relevant information
and a detailed description was rarely seen. Some interesting
points were also found for research articles that used Jazz as a
treatment option. All five of them were among those with good
outcome scores, as far as depression reduction was concerned.
Test scores ranged between a significance level of p < 0.01
(Guétin et al., 2009a; Verrusio et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2016)
and sometimes even better than p < 0.001 (e.g., Koelsch et al.,
2010; Fancourt et al., 2016). Depression score improvement (DSI)
had an average of 43.41% (SD = 6). However, there was no
clear trend leading toward Jazz as a more effective intervention
option, when compared to other music genres. This was assumed
because the two studies that showed the best21 reduction in
depression [Chan et al., 2010 (DSI = 48.78%); Koelsch et al.,
2010 (DSI = 4 6.58%)] used both classical music in addition to
19Jazz: Chan et al., 2009, 2010; Guétin et al., 2009a; Koelsch et al., 2010; Verrusio
et al., 2014.
20In most cases there was no further categorization between different musical
sub-genres of Jazz.
21Greatest: Best in terms of depression score improvement (DSI) (i.e., pre-post
score reduction in percent) with Jazz as intervention.
Jazz as an intervention. Experimental groups received two types
of intervention (i.e., classical music and Jazz) which eventually
blurred outcome scores or prevented more accurate results. Since
it was not possible to differentiate to what extent either classical
music or Jazz was responsible for the positive trend in reducing
symptoms of depression, further research in this field is needed.
Additional Music Genres – Results
Numerous other music styles were used in the experiments,
ranging from Indian ragas22 played on a flute (Gupta and
Gupta, 2005; Deshmukh et al., 2009), nature sound compositions
(Ashida, 2000; Chang et al., 2008), meditative (Chan et al.,
2010), or slow rhythm music (Chan et al., 2012), to lullabies
(Chang et al., 2008), pop or rock (Kim et al., 2006; Erkkilä et al.,
2011), Irish folk, Salsa, and Reggae (Koelsch et al., 2010), only
to name a few. As far as we were concerned all those genres
mentioned above would present interesting approaches for future
research. Due to a relatively small number and simultaneously
wide-ranging variety, more thorough investigations are needed,
though. These should be examined independently. As far
as the above-mentioned music genres, other than classical,
percussion, or Jazz were concerned, no indication for a preferable
combination was observed.
Experimental vs. Control Groups – Results
Non-significant Results for Experimental Groups
(p > 0.05)
In two (Deshmukh et al., 2009; Silverman, 2011) out of 28 studies
within our selection of research papers, no significant reduction
in depression scores was reported, after participants participated
in music interventions. Within those two cases all relevant
statistical observations differed without any obvious similarities
indicating reasons for non-significant results. Although the
results did not meet statistical significance for symptom
improvement, both authors explicitly pointed out that positive
changes in the severity of depression became obvious for the
respective experimental groups. We declared one article (Guétin
et al., 2009b) as significant, although it was marked as non-
significant in our complete table. This was due to the overall
results of this specific research paper, with significant [HADS-
D] test scores for weeks 5, 10, and 15. Only week 20 did not
follow this positive trend of improvement. It is also important to
mention that after music treatment every one of the additional
tests [HADS-A for Anxiety; Face(-Scale) to measure mood]
showed significant improvements for the experimental group.
Alternative Treatment for Corresponding Control
Groups
Control groups, who received an alternative (i.e., non-music)
intervention, were found in nine research articles (e.g., Guétin
et al., 2009a; Castillo-Pérez et al., 2010)23. We investigated
whether there were particularly noticeable differences in outcome
scores, when relevant control groups, who received an alternative
22Raga: Classification system for music that originated during the eleventh century
in Asia (mainly India).
23Setting was always: Experimental group received music as intervention, and the

Effectiveness of Music Interventions
treatment, were compared to those who received no additional
intervention at all (or only the usual treatment)24. As far as these
nine articles were concerned, a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in
depression scores was found in every experimental but only one
control setting (Hendricks et al., 1999). In this case, an entirely
different result became apparent, when control participants
received a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy [CBT] and a significant
reduction (p < 0.05) in depression scores was measured
compared to the respective baseline score, although music still
lead to better results. Another scholar (Chan et al., 2012)25,
instructed participants in the control group to take a resting
period, while simultaneously the experimental attendees joined
their music intervention session. This alternative approach did
not reduce the [GDS-15] depression score, but even increased
it. Interestingly, the same author previously published (Chan
et al., 2009) a significant (p = 0.007) increase (i.e., worsening
of depression) for the relevant control setting. To be complete,
a resting period was also conducted in another case (Hsu and
Lai, 2004), but results showed also no significant reduction
in depression scores. Other attempts to provide an alternative
intervention for the control group have been monomorphic tones
(Koelsch et al., 2010) that corresponded to the experimental
music samples (in pitch-, BPM-, and duration), verbal treatment
sessions (Silverman, 2011), antidepressant drugs (Verrusio et al.,
2014)26, reading sessions (Guétin et al., 2009a) or a “conductive-
behavioral” psychotherapy (Castillo-Pérez et al., 2010).
Significant Results for Control Groups (p < 0.05):
Significant reduction of depression (p < 0.05) in corresponding
control (“non-music treatment”) groups was reported twice
(Hendricks et al., 1999; Albornoz, 2011) within our selection of
scholarly articles. In one instance (Albornoz, 2011) the relevant
participants received only standard care, but in the other case
(Hendricks et al., 1999) an already above mentioned alternative
treatment (i.e., “Cognitive-Behavioral Activities”) was reported.
Spatial and Temporal Implementation of
Treatment
Individual vs. Group Intervention – Results
As postulated by previous literature (Wheeler et al., 2003;
Maratos et al., 2008), we differentiated mainly two scenarios
based on the number of participants who attended music
intervention sessions and referred to them as “group” or
“individual.” Group sessions can awaken participants’ social
interactions and individual sessions often provides motivation
(Wheeler et al., 2003). Here, a “group” scenario was specified,
if two or more persons (n ≥ 2) were treated simultaneously,
whereas “individual” determined experimental settings where
only one single person received music interventions individually
24For example, if elderly people lived in a retirement home, a standard daily routine
or common everyday activities were seen as usual or regular treatment. If, on the
other hand, a resting period (e.g., Chan et al., 2012) was carried out simultaneously,
this was interpreted as an (“non-music”) alternative.
25In all three of his articles within our selection (Chan et al., 2009, 2010, 2012)
participants were instructed to rest.
26Pharmacotherapy treatment included SSRI (Paroxetine 20mg/die), NaSSA
(Mirtazapine 30 mg/die), and Benzodiazepine (Alprazolam).
(n = 1). Among our article selection we could find a well-
balanced distribution of 15 trials with participants who received
music interventions in a group, while 13 researchers used an
individual setting. First, the impact of individual compared
to group treatment was evaluated. Here an almost equivalent
outcome (for the significance-level of results) across all 13
individual, compared to 15 group settings was found, without any
advantage to one over the other. Non-significant improvements
were seen once for a group (Silverman, 2011) and once27 for an
individual (Deshmukh et al., 2009) intervention.
Single-Session Duration – Results
The question whether groups showed different (i.e., more or
less) improvements, if the duration of one single session was
altered, we decided to use the intervention length as a key metric
(Figure 3). Except for two instances (Hendricks et al., 1999;
Wang et al., 2011), 26 research papers reported the duration one
single treatment had. Among those 20 min (Guétin et al., 2009a)
was the shortest, and 120 min (Albornoz, 2011; Han et al., 2011)
the longest duration for one session. The average for all 26 articles
was 55 min, 70 min for 1328 group settings, and 40 min as far as
the 13 individual intervention setups were concerned.
Entire Research (=) Intervention Program Duration –
Results
Continuing our review process, some interesting diversity
was found for the scheduled (i.e., total) treatment duration
(Figure 3). It ranged from 1 day in two cases (Koelsch et al., 2010;
Silverman, 2011) up to 20 (Guétin et al., 2009b), or even 24 weeks
(Verrusio et al., 2014). Out of 26 trials an average duration of
7 weeks was found. In two cases, the data was missing (Wang
et al., 2011; Esfandiari and Mansouri, 2014). The scheduled
(i.e., total) treatment duration was determined by a variety of
factors. Our investigation, whether there was any relationship
between the entire duration of experimental projects and relevant
outcome scores, delivered the following results. For an individual
(Ind) therapy setting, we isolated eight29 research papers with
above average30 results in depression score improvement (DSIInd
> 36.50%). We then calculated for the entire project an
average duration of almost 7 weeks. For the remaining five31
articles that also used an individual approach, but had below
average depression score improvements, an average duration
of 6 weeks was found. A different picture became apparent
when we selected those four32 articles that presented better
than average (DSIGr > 49.09%) results in depression score
improvement, after participants received music intervention in
a group (Gr). Percussion music (mainly drumming) was used
27As already described above, the other individual setting (Guétin Soua, et al.,
2009) with pre-post results of p > 0.05 was still counted as significant.
28Information regarding the duration for one group session was unavailable in two
articles (Hendricks et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2011).

by three researchers (Ashida, 2000; Lu et al., 2013; Chen et al.,
2016). In comparison, the fourth author (Hendricks et al., 1999)
used a selection of relaxing music for treatment. For this setup, a
combined duration of six (SD = 4) weeks was calculated for the
entire project length. On the other hand, a mean close to 10 (SD
= 7) weeks was found for the remaining 733 group intervention
projects that were less successful (i.e., below average), as far
as depression score reduction was concerned. Based on these
results, we concluded that the length for the entire music
intervention procedure might be a crucial element for successful
results, and seems to be associated with the intervention type.
These findings were not enough to draw further conclusions for
every project though, but as far as our selection was concerned,
a slightly longer intervention duration of 7 weeks led to better
results if participants were treated individually. In comparison,
for a group setting our calculations revealed a different picture,
when we calculated the average entire duration for all relevant
research projects. Here it was 6 weeks that produced the most
beneficial results within groups. Drums were used for three out
of the four projects that presented above average results. Once
(Ashida, 2000) a small African drum was used for “drumming
activity” at the start of every session. Each time a different
participant was asked to perform with this instrument, although
nobody in the experimental group was neither a professional
drummer nor a musician. African drums were also used by
another researcher (Chen et al., 2016). In addition, equipment
also included one stereo, one electronic piano, two guitars, one
set of hand glockenspiel, and other percussion instruments such
as cymbals, tambourines, and xylophones. Finally, percussion
instruments used in the third study (Lu et al., 2013) included
hand bells, snare drums, a castanet, a tambourine, some claves,
a triangle and wood blocks.
Total Number of Sessions – Results
Continuing the analysis, we evaluated the total number of music
intervention sessions. Apparently, this metric was dependent
on the duration as well as frequency (“session frequency”)
each intervention had. With one exception (Wang et al., 2011),
where relevant data was missing, the number of sessions varied
considerably. Only a single treatment session was used by three
authors (Chan et al., 2010; Koelsch et al., 2010; Silverman, 2011),
whereas 56 sessions (Castillo-Pérez et al., 2010) marked the
opposite end of the scale. For 27 articles with available data,
a combined average of 15 sessions was found. As far as the
total number of sessions in an individual type of setting was
concerned, above average results had a combined number of 13
(SD = 5) sessions, whereas the remaining six research works had
18 (SD = 8) interventions. The best results in a group setting
showed an average of 17 sessions (SD = 15) and they were
found in 7 scholarly publications. In comparison, we calculated
14 sessions in total for the remaining 7 articles.
Session Frequency (i.e., Sessions per Week) – Results
As described previously (Wheeler et al., 2003), the number
of sessions can produce different results. Researchers, within

our selection of 28 articles, used various approaches for their
experiment, as far as the “session frequency” (i.e., number of
sessions within a defined duration) was concerned. Pre-defined
intervals ranged from once a week up to one time a day. Once
(Choi et al., 2008), the article did mention the total number
of sessions (n = 15) with a “frequency” of one to two times
a week and a total intervention duration of 12 weeks. To be
able to present an appropriate comparison of statistical data,
a mean of 1.25 sessions per week was calculated. Besides two
cases (Wang et al., 2011; Esfandiari and Mansouri, 2014) where
no information was provided, the combined average session
frequency for the remaining 26 articles was 2.89 (SD = 2.50)
interventions per week. Usually sessions were held once a week.

improvement. Groups (Figure 3) showed better (i.e., above
average) improvements in depression, if each session had an
average duration of 60 min, and the mean length of treatment
was 4–8 weeks.
In comparison, the two variables, session length and
trial duration, had different effects for individual treatment
approaches (Figure 3). Above average results were found for
sessions lasting 30 min combined with a treatment duration
between 4 and 8 weeks.
Diagnostic Measures – Results of Selected
Questionnaires
We discovered some distinctive features as well as certain
similarities in our selection of 28 articles. They might be a
guidance for future research projects and as such are presented
in more detail in the subsections below.
Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]
There are three versions of the BDI. The original [BDI] (Beck
et al., 1961), followed by its first [BDI-I/-1A] (Beck et al., 1988)
and second [BDI-II] revision (Beck et al., 1996). Beck used a
novel approach to develop his inventory by writing down the
verbal symptom description of his patients with depression and
later sorted his notes according to intensity or severity.
Beck Depression Inventory [BDI] – Results
The BDI34 (Beck et al., 1961, 1996) was the most widely used
screening tool in our scholarly selection. It was used in eight
trials, but we only selected 735 studies for evaluating pre-post BDI
scores. Once (Harmat et al., 2008), results were only provided
for the experimental group, although an experimental control
setting was described by the author. Twice (Harmat et al., 2008;
Esfandiari and Mansouri, 2014) two experimental groups and

35BDI-scores were measured only once (Silverman, 2011), either at the end
(experimental group), or at the beginning (control group) and thus was excluded
for this calculation.

one control group were reported. In one case (Esfandiari and
Mansouri, 2014) two different music genres were used (“Light
Pop & Heavy Rock”), and in another incident (Harmat et al.,
2008) the second experimental group listened to an audiobook
(“Music & Audiobook”). BDI baseline scores, that indicated
a minimal36 to mild37 depression, were found in two articles
(Gupta and Gupta, 2005; Harmat et al., 2008). Both authors
reported for their experimental group a significant improvement
of (BDI) depression scores. We calculated an overall average
reduction of 2.72 (SD = 0.03). Moderate38 signs of depression,
with BDI baseline scores that ranged from 18.66 (Albornoz, 2011)
to 24.72 (Chen et al., 2016), were found twice. Music intervention
improved BDI scores significantly, with an overall average
reduction of 10.65 (SD = 3.63) for both articles mentioned
above. For the respective control groups one author (Chen
et al., 2016) reported non-significant pre-post changes, whereas
the other researcher (Albornoz, 2011) described a significant39
reduction in the standard treatment group as well. The remaining
three scholarly papers (Hendricks et al., 1999; Choi et al., 2008;
Esfandiari and Mansouri, 2014) described participants with a
severe40 depression, as confirmed by the initial (baseline) BDI
results. One article (Esfandiari and Mansouri, 2014), of the
three mentioned above, used one control and two experimental
groups, who were treated with either “light” or “heavy” music.
To be able to compare this work with the other studies one
single baseline (31.75), post treatment (12.50), and pre-post
difference score of 19.25 (SD = 2.47)41 was calculated (according
to common statistical standards) for both experimental settings.
Interestingly, the corresponding control sample showed a three-
point increased BDI score (p > 0.05) and no decrease at any
time. Continuing with the remaining articles, even bigger initial
baseline BDI scores of 39.00 (SD = n/a) (Hendricks et al.,
1999) and 49.30 (SD = 3.10) (Choi et al., 2008) were found.
In addition, both authors reported a significant pre-post BDI
score reduction42 for their experimental groups. Based on the
published data it became evident that BDI scores improved
significantly in each of the cases and this time an overall average
reduction of 26.90 (SD = 9.59) was calculated. Once (Hendricks
et al., 1999) a significantly reduced BDI pre-post score was also
reported for the control setting, where participants received a
cognitive-behavioral activities program as an alternative (non-
music) intervention.
We compared all research projects that used the BDI
questionnaire (Table 2). Higher baseline scores almost always led
36Minimal depression: BDI-I (= BDI-1A) score (=) 00–09; BDI-II score (=)
00–13.
37Mild depression: BDI-I (= BDI-1A) score (=) 10–18; BDI-II score (=) 14–19.
38Moderate depression: BDI-I (= BDI-1A) score (=) 19–29; BDI-II score (=)
20–28.
39Albornoz (2011) found in both groups a significant reduction for BDI scores
albeit to a significantly greater extent in the experimental (−8.08; p < 0.01) than in
the control (−2.25; p < 0.05) setting.
40Severe depression: BDI-I (=BDI-1A) score (=) 30–63; BDI-II score (=) 29–63.
41Pre-post difference: experimental (1) “light” music (=) 17.50; experimental (2)
“heavy” music (=) 21.00 (both p < 0.05 within groups) (Esfandiari and Mansouri,
2014).

Effectiveness of Music Interventions
to comparatively bigger score reductions in those experimental
groups, who received music intervention. Except for two
articles (Hendricks et al., 1999; Albornoz, 2011), no significant
improvements were found for control samples. For one of
the above-mentioned exceptions (Hendricks et al., 1999) an
alternative treatment (“Cognitive-Behavioral” activities) was
provided, which might be a plausible explanation why those
relatively young participants (all 14 or 15 years old) showed
such reductions in BDI values. Nevertheless, it is also important
to mention that the relevant experimental group improved to
a greater extent (BDIPRE − BDIPOST = 37.66) after treatment.
As far as the other case (Albornoz, 2011) was concerned, no
alternatives (i.e., other than basic or usual care) were offered, and
thus no explanation had been established as to how the results
could be explained.
Geriatric Depression scale [GDS-15/-30]
The original Geriatric Depression Scale [GDS-30] (Yesavage et al.,
1983) includes 30 questions (Hanser and Thompson, 1994; Chan
et al., 2009; Guétin et al., 2009a) and its shorter equivalent [GDS-
15] (Yesavage and Sheikh, 1986) contains 15 items (Chan et al.,
2010, 2012; Verrusio et al., 2014).
Geriatric Depression Scale [GDS-15/-30] – Results
A more precise analysis of results was also done for the Geriatric
Depression Scale (GDS-15/-30) scores. As already suggested by
its name, all 223 participants were elderly. Because both GDS
versions are based on the same questionnaire, we combined
scores of the long (i.e., GDS-30) with the short (i.e., GDS-
15) test version and found a total of 223 participants in six
articles (e.g., Chan et al., 2009; Verrusio et al., 2014). A possible
bias could be prevented because tests were evenly distributed
in number, and with respect to higher GDS-30 as well as
lower GDS-15 scores, calculations were adapted accordingly.
Taking a closer look at the GDS-15/-30 results (Table 3),
some similarities could be found for the most successful (all
p ≤ 0.01) four research articles (Chan et al., 2009, 2010;
Guétin et al., 2009a; Verrusio et al., 2014). All of them used
and mainly focused on classical compositions as far as their
music title selection was concerned. The average reduction in
depression as measured by the GDS-15/-30 depression scores
was 43% (−42.62%; SD = 6.24%). In comparison, every one of
the remaining four research projects (Hanser and Thompson,
1994; Ashida, 2000; Han et al., 2011; Chan et al., 2012) also
presented significant results, albeit not as good as the above-
mentioned (all p ≤ 0.05). Interestingly, as far as music genres
were concerned, the focus of these less successful projects was
rhythmic drumming in two cases (Ashida, 2000; Han et al., 2011).
For the remaining two (Hanser and Thompson, 1994; Chan et al.,
2012) primarily relaxing, slow paced titles43 were selected as
intervention.
43One author (Chan et al., 2012) limited his selection to slow music (60–80
beats per minute). The other researcher (Hanser and Thompson, 1994) also used
some “energetic” or “empowering” titles, but mainly concentrated on relaxing
compositions.

Other Diagnostic Measures for
Depression44 – Results45
Several times, additional questionnaires were used to measure
changes in the severity of depression.
Researchers performed those surveys (Table 4) in addition
to their “main” depression questionnaire. Please refer to

Anxiety is known to be one of the most common depression
comorbidities, Sartorius et al., 1996; Bradt et al., 2013; Tiller,
2013). Eight46 researchers concentrated their investigation
entirely on depression, and thus only performed questionnaires
related to this pathology. In comparison, most of the remaining
studies measured additional pathologies, with some of them
known to be often associated comorbidities with depressive
symptoms. However, because these topics were not the focus of
this review, we won’t discuss them here in detail. A much more
detailed representation is available in the Supplementary Table.

DISCUSSION, CONCLUSION AND
FURTHER THOUGHTS
Depression often reduces participation in social activities. It also
has an impact on reliability or stamina at daily work and may
even result in a greater susceptibility to diseases. Music can be
considered an emerging treatment option for mood disorders
that has not yet been explored to its full potential. To the best
of our knowledge, there were only very few meta-analyses, or
systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials available that
generated the amount of statistical data, which we presented here.
Certain
individual-specific
attributes
of
music
are
recognizable, when the medium of music is decomposed
(Durkin, 2014)47 into its components. Numerous researchers
reported the beneficial effects of music, such as strengthening
awareness and sensitiveness for positive emotions (Croom,
2012), or improvement of psychiatric symptoms (Nizamie and
Tikka, 2014). Group drumming, for example, helped soldiers
to deal with their traumatic experiences, while they were in the
process of recovery (Bensimon et al., 2008). However, we have
concentrated our focus of interest on patients diagnosed with

clinical depression, one of the most serious and frequent mental
disorders worldwide.
In this review we examined whether, and to what extent,
music intervention could significantly affect the emotional
state of people living with depression. Our primary objective
was to accurately identify, select, and analyze up-to-date
research literature, which utilized music as intervention to
treat participants with depressive symptoms. After a multi-stage
review process, a total of 1.810 participants in 28 scholarly papers
met our inclusion criteria and were finally selected for further
investigations about the effectiveness music had to treat their
depression. Both, quantitative as well as qualitative empirical
approaches were performed to interpret the data obtained
from those original research papers. To consider the different
methods researchers used, we presented a detailed illustration of
approaches and evaluated them during our investigation process.
Interventions included, for example, various instrumental or
vocal versions of classical compositions, Jazz, world music, and
meditative songs to name just a few genres. Classical music
(Classical or Baroque period) for treatment was used in nine
articles. Notable composers were W.A. Mozart, L. v. Beethoven
and J. S. Bach. Jazz was used five times for intervention. Vernon
Duke (Title: “April in Paris”), M. Greger (Title: “Up to Date”),
or Louis Armstrong (Title: “St. Louis Blues”) are some of the
featured artists. The third major genre researchers used for
their experimental groups was percussion and drumming-based
music.
Significant criteria were complete trial duration, amount of
intervention sessions, age distribution within participants, and
individual or group setting. We compared passive listening to
recorded music (e.g., CD), with active experiencing of live music
(e.g., singing, improvising with instruments). Furthermore, the
analysis of similar studies has enhanced and complemented
our work. Previous studies indicated positive effects of music
on emotions and anxiety, what we tried to confirm in more
detail. The length of an entire music treatment procedure was
suspected to be an important element for reducing symptoms
of depression. A longer treatment duration of 7 weeks for an
individual, compared to nearly 6 weeks in a group setting led to
better (i.e., above average) outcomes. Although a difference was
discovered, 1 week was not enough to draw further conclusions
for each and every project. As far as intervals between sessions
were concerned, we found no differences between those research
articles that were among the best, compared to the remaining
experimental designs. Consequently no trend was becoming
apparent, favoring one over the others. We further investigated
if there was any association between an individual or a group
setting, if the length of a single session and trial duration
were compared with regard to symptom improvement. Groups
showed better improvements in depression, if each session had
an average duration of 60 min, and a treatment between 4 and
8 weeks long. In comparison, the two variables, session length
and trial duration, had different effects for individual treatment
approaches. Above average results were found for sessions lasting
30 min combined with a treatment duration between 4 and
8 weeks. Furthermore, results were compared according to
age groups (“young,” “medium,” and “elderly”). Overall, elderly

people benefitted in particular from this kind of non-invasive
treatment. During, but mainly after completion of music-driven
interventions, positive effects became apparent. Those included
primarily social aspects of life (e.g., an increased motivation
to participate in life again), as well as concerned participants’
psychological status (e.g., a strengthened self-confidence, an
improved resilience to withstand stress).

self-esteem)48, associated with depression, were also discussed
briefly, and showed promising outcomes after intervention
as well. Particularly anxiety (Sartorius et al., 1996; Tiller,
2013) is known to be a common burden, many patients with
mood disorders are additionally affected with. Interpreted as
manifestation of fear, anxiety is a basic feeling in situations that
are regarded as threatening. Triggers can be expected threats such
as physical integrity, self-esteem or self-image. Unfortunately,
researchers merely distinguished between “anxiety disorder” (i.e.,
mildly exceeded anxiety) and the physiological reaction. Also,
the question should be raised if the response to music differs
if patients are suffering from both, depression and anxiety.
Sleep quality in combination with symptoms of depression
(Mayers and Baldwin, 2006) raised the question, whether sleep
disturbances lead to depression or, vice versa, depression was
responsible for a reduced quantity of sleep instead. Most studies
used questionnaires that were based on self-assessment. However,
it is unclear whether this approach is sufficiently valid and
reliable enough to diagnose changes regarding to symptom
improvement. Future approaches should not solely rely on
questionnaires, but rather add measurements of physiological
body reactions (e.g., skin conductance, heart and respiratory rate,
or AEP’s via an EEG) for more objectivity.
The way auditory stimuli were presented, also raised some
additional questions. We found that for individual intervention
most of the times headphones were used. For a group
setting speakers were the number one choice instead. For
elderly participants, a different sensitivity for music perception
was a concern, when music was presented directly through
headphones. Headphones add at least some isolation from
background noises (i.e., able to reduce noise disturbances and
surround-soundings). Another concern was that most of the time
a certified hearing test was not used. Although, a tendency toward
a reduction in the ability to hear higher frequencies is quite
common with an increased age, there might still be substantial
differences between participants.

participants
within
their
respective
music
intervention group, did not present a significant reduction of
depression. Those two had almost nothing in common49 and
were not investigated further.
Control groups, who received an alternative (“non-music”)
intervention, were found in nine research articles. Significant
reduction of depression in corresponding control (“non-music
intervention”) groups was reported by two authors (Hendricks
et al., 1999; Albornoz, 2011). In one instance (Albornoz, 2011) the
relevant participants received only standard care, but in the other
case (Hendricks et al., 1999) an alternative treatment (Cognitive-
Behavioral activities) was reported. Medical conceptions are in
a constant state of change. To achieve improvements in areas
of disease prevention and treatment, psychology is increasingly
associated with clinical medicine and general practitioners.
Under the guidance of an experienced music therapist, the

patient receives a multimodal and very structured treatment
approach. That is the reason why we can find specialists for
music therapy in fields other than psychosomatics or psychiatry
today. Examples are internal medicine departments and almost
all rehabilitation centers. The acoustic and musical environment
literally opens a portal to our unconscious mind. Music therapy
often comes into play when other forms of treatment are not
effective enough or fail completely.
Music connects us to the time when we only had preverbal
communication skills (Hwang and Hughes, 2000; Graham,
2004; i.e., communication before a fully functioning language
is developed; e.g., infants or children with autism spectrum
disorder), without being dependent on language. Although
board-certified music therapy is undeniable the most regulated,
developed and professional variant, this should not hinder health
professionals and researchers from other areas in the execution
of their own projects using music-based interventions. The
only thing they should be very precise about, is the way they
define their work. Within our selection of articles the expression
music therapy was used sometimes, although a more detailed
description or specific information was neither published nor
available upon our request. In those cases, the term “music
therapy” should not be used, but instead music medicine or some
of the alternatives mentioned in this manuscript (e.g., therapy
with music, music for treatment). This way many obstacles as
well as misunderstandings can be prevented in the first place, but
high-quality research is still produced. Also, it is very important
that researchers contemplate and report the details of the music
intervention that they use. For example, they should report
whether the music is researcher-selected or participant-selected,
the specific tracks they used, the delivery method (speakers,
headphones), and any other relevant details.
Encouraged by the promising potential of music as an
intervention (Kemper and Danhauer, 2005), we pursued our
ambitious goal to contribute knowledge that provides help for
the affected individuals, both the patients themselves as well
as their nearest relatives. Furthermore, we wanted to provide
detailed information about each randomized controlled study,
and therefore made all our data available, so others may
benefit for their potential upcoming research project. The overall
outcome of our analysis, with all significant effects considered,
produced highly convincing results that music is a potential
treatment option, to improve depression symptoms and quality
of life across many age groups. We hope that our results provide
some support for future concepts.
