Objective: For married couples, when one spouse participates in weight loss treatment, the untreated
spouse can also experience weight loss. This study examined this ripple effect in a nationally available
weight management program.
Methods: One hundred thirty dyads were randomized to Weight Watchers (WW; n 5 65) or to a self-
guided control group (SG; n 5 65) and assessed at 0, 3, and 6 months. Inclusion criteria were age � 25
years, BMI 27 to 40 kg/m2 (� 25 kg/m2 for untreated spouses), and no weight loss contraindications. WW
participants received 6 months of free access to in-person meetings and online tools. SG participants
received a weight loss handout. Spouses did not receive treatment.
Results: Untreated spouses lost weight at 3 months (WW 5 21.5 6 2.9 kg; SG 5 21.1 6 3.3 kg) and 6
months (WW 5 22.2 6 4.2 kg; SG 5 21.9 6 3.6 kg), but weight losses did not differ by condition. Overall,
32.0% of untreated spouses lost � 3% of initial body weight by 6 months. Baseline weight was signifi-
cantly correlated within couples (r 5 0.26; P < 0.01) as were weight loss trajectories (r 5 0.52; P < 0.001).
Conclusions: Evidence of a ripple effect was found in untreated spouses in both formal and self-guided
weight management approaches. These data suggest that weight loss can spread within couples, and
that widely available lifestyle programs have weight loss effects beyond the treated individual.

Introduction
Weight within couples is highly interdependent (1,2). Spouses often
enter marriage at a similar weight status (3-5) and mirror each
other’s weight trajectories over time (2,6). In a landmark study
establishing the spread of obesity in social networks such as friend-
ships and marriages, Christakis and Fowler found that when one
spouse develops obesity, the likelihood of the other spouse develop-
ing obesity increases by 37% (1). There is also converging evidence
that weight loss can spread within couples, a phenomenon referred
to as a ripple effect (7-10). Evidence for a ripple effect has emerged
from both observational studies, such as the English Longitudinal
Study of Aging (8), and treatment studies that have assessed active
weight loss participants and their untreated spouses (7,11,12). Ripple
effects have been reported in gold standard lifestyle intervention
studies (7,11), including the Look AHEAD trial, in which untreated
spouses of participants in the intensive lifestyle intervention lost
significantly more weight than untreated spouses of participants in
the control group (7). Reports from the bariatric surgery literature
have also supported a ripple effect, indicating that in the first year
following surgery, untreated spouses lose weight (13,14). For exam-
ple, Aarts and colleagues found that more than 65% of spouses of
bariatric surgery patients lost weight in the first year following sur-
gery, although the magnitude of that weight loss tended to be small
(median loss of 1.3 kg) (13).
While intriguing, the ripple effect literature is limited in that most
studies have assessed untreated spouses’ weight via reports by either
the spouse or the weight loss participant (12,13,15), introducing
potential reporting error. Many studies, particularly in the bariatric
surgery literature, have also used nonrandomized designs with no con-
trol groups (13,15,16). Moreover, it is not known whether ripple
effects are produced outside of the highly structured clinical settings

 that have been studied to date, such as in nationally available pro-
grams or self-guided attempts. This study fills these gaps by using a
prospective randomized controlled trial design to examine the impact
of individuals’ participation in a popular, nationally available,
evidence-based
program,
Weight
Watchers
(WW)
(17-21),
on
untreated spouses and comparing their objectively measured weight
loss with that of the untreated spouses of individuals assigned to a
self-guided control group (SG). Understanding if ripple effects occur
in this real-world setting will provide a more complete picture of the
true reach of lifestyle-based weight loss on untreated family members.
Methods
Cohabitating dyads (heterosexual or same-sex) were recruited through
direct mailings and community and online postings in the Greater Hart-
ford, Connecticut, area. One member of the couple (i.e., the treated par-
ticipant) had to be interested in participating in a weight loss program;
the other member of the couple (i.e., the untreated spouse) had to be will-
ing to attend assessments only. Dyads were often married (93.1%), but
marriage was not an inclusion criterion. For brevity, the term spouse is
used to signify the other person in the couple regardless of marital status.
Each member of the couple was screened by phone for eligibility.
Inclusion criteria were (1) 25 to 70 years old and (2) BMI (kg/m2)
between 27.0 and 40.0 in treated participants or � 25 in untreated
spouses. Additional exclusion criteria for treated participants were the
following: (1) current enrollment in a weight loss program, dieting, or
taking medications that might affect weight; (2) participation in a
weight loss program in the past year; (3) lost � 5% of their body
weight in the past 6 months; (4) planning to or had undergone weight
loss surgery; (5) had any orthopedic limitations or contraindications to
physical activity; (6) were pregnant, lactating, or less than 6 months
postpartum or were planning to become pregnant in the next year; (7)
reported uncontrolled hypertension, history of coronary heart disease,
stroke, or peripheral arterial disease; (8) reported chronic gastrointesti-
nal disease; (9) endorsed having hepatitis B or C, cirrhosis, or HIV;
(10) had a history of cancer within the past 5 years; or (11) reported a
significant psychiatric illness that might interfere with completion of
the study. Treated participants who had diabetes or other significant
medical conditions were required to obtain written consent from a
physician to participate in the study. Interested individuals (n 5 384)
were screened for eligibility (Figure 1). Of those, 130 dyads (33.9%)
were enrolled between January and March 2015. The study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of
Connecticut.
Randomization and treatment conditions
Dyads were randomized to either the WW or SG condition by using
a covariate adaptive randomization strategy (22) that took into

 account the treated participant’s sex and baseline BMI: 27.0 to 29.9
(overweight) versus 30.0 to 40.0 (obesity). In the WW condition,
treated participants received free access to Weight Watchers for a 6-
month period following randomization and had access to both in-
person meetings and digital tools, including self-monitoring of
intake, activity, and weight, and 24/7 online chat with WW staff.
Only the treated participants received free access; untreated spouses
did not. Objectively measured uptake of WW was high; 95.4% of
treated participants activated their WW membership online and
36.9% attended one or more in-person meeting (on average attended
12.17 6 9.07 sessions; range 1-31). In the SG condition, treated par-
ticipants received a four-page handout with basic information
regarding healthy eating, activity, and weight control strategies (e.g.,
low-calorie, low-fat diet, self-monitoring of intake activity and
weight) immediately following randomization; the handout was not
reviewed with participants, and no further weight loss guidance was
provided. After completing the study at the 6-month assessment,
treated participants in the SG condition were offered 6 months of
free access to Weight Watchers as described above.
Assessments
Treated participants and untreated spouses were assessed at baseline,
3 months, and 6 months. Weight was measured in kilograms to the
nearest 0.1 kg by using a calibrated standard digital scale (Tanita
BWB-800; Tanita, Tokyo, Japan) while participants were in light
clothing and no shoes. Standing height was measured by using a sta-
diometer to the nearest centimeter. All anthropometric measures
were taken in duplicate, and the mean was used in analysis. Basic
demographic information (e.g., age, sex, race) was assessed at base-
line only. Treated participants and untreated spouses each received
$25 for the baseline and 3-month assessment and $50 for the 6-
month assessment.
Statistical approach
The primary outcome was the weight change of the untreated
spouses at 6 months. Based on our prior work (11,23), we antici-
pated that we would need to assess 55 couples per group to have
0.80 power to detect the expected 2.3-kg (SD 5 4.3) between-group
difference in the weight loss of untreated spouses. We enrolled 130
couples (65 per group) to account for any dropout. Attrition was
minimal (two couples dropped out), and the 128 dyads with com-
plete data were retained for primary analyses. Sensitivity analyses
were conducted with intent-to-treat analyses, setting the weight loss
for the four individuals who dropped out at 0 kg, yielding identical
results (not presented). Data were analyzed by using SPSS Statistics
version 24 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York). Baseline group differ-
ences were examined by using v2 or independent t tests. To examine
the primary hypotheses (weight loss in untreated spouses), analyses
of covariance (ANCOVA) were used to examine kilogram weight
change at 3 and 6 months, controlling for baseline weight. ANCO-
VAs were then used to examine potential differences across sex and
initial weight status (i.e., overweight vs. obesity). We also catego-
rized individuals by using a 3% weight loss as the cutoff for suc-
cessful weight loss based on obesity management guidelines (24);
group differences were examined with v2 tests.
As a secondary analysis, to take advantage of the dyadic nature of
the data and to examine not only weight change in untreated
spouses, but also the relationship between weight change in treated
participants and untreated spouses (i.e., a true “ripple” effect), longi-
tudinal dyadic models were specified (25). The outcome of interest
in these models was not weight change; rather, it was the correlation
for predicted trajectories, or patterns, of change within dyads (i.e., if
one participant lost weight, did his or her partner tend to lose weight
as well?). Differences in weight change across categories (i.e., inter-
vention, sex, initial weight status) discovered during the primary
analyses were included in these models. Longitudinal dyadic models
were estimated, predicting changes in weight (kilogram), by using
the MIXED command in SPSS. Absolute weight was specified as
the outcome variable rather than weight loss, given that each partici-
pant began the trial at zero weight loss. This eliminates variance in
the intercept, thereby eliminating the ability to explore covariance
between beginning weight status and predicted change trajectories
between partners and participants (26). The restricted maximum
likelihood estimation was used when reporting model results. Fur-
thermore, mixed models are flexible in regard to missing data and
include all participants with data at any time point in the analysis.
Thus, these results represent all 130 couples.
Results
Baseline characteristics by treatment condition are reported in Table 1.
The majority of untreated spouses were male (68.5%), were Caucasian
(96.2%), and had obesity (66.2%), with a mean age of 53.96 10.5 years

 and an average baseline BMI of 33.0 6 5.5. Untreated spouses in WW
weighed more than in SG (P 5 0.03), but there was no difference
between groups in BMI. There were no other differences in baseline
values by group for untreated spouses. Untreated spouses were demo-
graphically similar to treated participants with the exception that more
untreated spouses were male and had overweight (vs. obesity). In
treated participants (68.5% female), the mean age was 53.46 10.5
years, average baseline BMI was 33.96 3.7, and 83.7% had obesity at
study entry. There were no differences in baseline characteristics by
group for treated participants. Four (3.1%) couples were in same-sex
relationships. Two couples were lost to follow-up at 6 months, resulting
in a 97% completion rate in WW and 100% completion rate in SG at 3
and 6 months.
Weight loss in untreated spouses
Untreated spouses lost weight at 3 months (M 5 21.30 kg; F(1,126)
5 22.61; P < 0.001) and 6 months (M 5 22.02 kg; F(1,126) 5 33.52;
P < 0.001), but there was no effect of treatment condition on untreated
spouses’ weight loss at either time point (Ps > 0.59). Detailed results,
means, and standard deviations (SD), for both untreated spouses and
for treated participants, can be found in Table 2.
Weight loss in untreated spouses did not differ by sex at 3 months

or
6
months
(F(1,124) 5 0.82;
P 5 0.37), and there was no interaction between treatment condition
and sex predicting weight change at either time point (Ps > 0.18).
Untreated spouses’ weight loss also did not differ by initial weight
status (i.e., overweight vs. obesity) at 3 months (F(1,124) 5 0.11;
P 5 0.74) or at 6 months (F(1,124) 5 0.55; P 5 0.46). The associa-
tion between initial weight status and weight change also did not
differ by condition (Ps > 0.56).
Almost a third (32%) of untreated spouses met the 3% cutoff for
significant weight loss at 6 months, and there were no differences
by treatment condition (X2(1) 5 0.20; P 5 0.66).
Weight loss in treated participants
In contrast, treated participants in the WW condition lost more
weight at 3 months than those in SG (23.35 kg vs. 21.97 kg;
F(1,125) 5 4.96; P 5 0.03), but there was no difference by condition
at 6 months (P 5 0.18). Female treated participants lost marginally
more weight at 3 months (F(1,124) 5 3.87; P 5 0.05) as well as 6
months (F(1,124) 5 6.76; P 5 0.01) than male treated participants.
Finally, treated participants who had overweight lost more weight
than treated participants with obesity at 3 months (F(1,124) 5 6.25;
P 5 0.01) and at 6 months (F(1,124) 5 6.27; P 5 0.01). The associa-
tion of sex and BMI category on kilogram weight loss did not differ
across condition (Ps > 0.34).
Longitudinal dyadic models
Initial weight status (obesity vs. overweight), sex, and their interac-
tions with role (treated vs. untreated spouse) and time were included
in the dyadic growth model. All two- and three-way interactions
between role, condition, and time were also included to guard
against model misspecification. Sex, condition, and role were con-
trast coded to get the average effect of time on weight change across
all participants.
There was significant overall weight change, with treated partici-
pants predicted to lose, overall, 1.72 kg across each 3-month period
(B 5 21.73 [22.11 to 21.50]; t(164.82) 5 8.95; P < 0.001). Of pri-
mary interest in this analysis, errors were significantly correlated
between couple members (r 5 0.31; P < 0.001). This indicates that
significant interdependence remained within couples once predictors
in the model had already been accounted for (i.e., time, sex, role,
condition, initial weight status, and their interactions). Thus, if one
member of a couple lost more (or less) than predicted at any given
time point, the other member of the couple also lost more (or less)
than predicted. Random intercepts (i.e., baseline weights) were sig-
nificantly correlated within couples (r 5 0.26; P < 0.01). Couples
also
had

trajectories
(r 5 0.52;
P < 0.001), such that if one couple member had a steeper (or more

steeper (or more shallow) weight loss trajectory. No other correla-
tions were significant.

This trial is the first to examine whether individuals’ participation in
a nationally available weight management program has a ripple

 effect on untreated spouses. Current guidelines (24) recommend a
3% weight loss to achieve measurable health benefits; across both
conditions, this criterion was achieved by 32% of untreated spouses.
To fully capture the clinical and cost-effectiveness of weight man-
agement programs, our results suggest that the focus of assessment
should be broadened to include untreated spouses who share obesity
risk and can also benefit from interventions without any additional
costs.
Unexpectedly, weight losses did not differ between untreated
spouses of WW and SG participants, suggesting that ripple effects
occur in both more and less structured approaches. When compar-
ing our findings to the broader ripple effect literature, the mean
weight losses we observed in untreated spouses in both the WW
and SG conditions were consistent with the 2% to 3% weight
losses observed in untreated spouses of individuals undergoing
bariatric surgery or participating in lifestyle-based programs at aca-
demic medical centers (7,9-11,13). Given these similarities in rip-
ple effects across a wide variety of intervention methods (surgery,
clinic-based lifestyle, commercial program, self-guided), it may be
that some form of treated participation by spouses is needed to
achieve consistent weight losses greater than 2% to 3%. Such par-
ticipation will, however, be associated with increased costs. Inno-
vative approaches that involve spouses in treatment to varying
degrees in an attempt to find the most cost-effective way of deliv-
ering weight loss interventions within couples would be informa-
tive in this regard.
Through dyadic growth curve modeling, we were able to take a
more nuanced look at the ripple effects and identified trends that
may inform future intervention efforts. Specifically, this approach
allowed us to parse variability in trajectories of weight loss over
time, including how couple members’ trajectories related to each
other and whether other factors (i.e., the individual’s or his or her
spouse’s starting weight) related to weight loss trajectories. We
found that across both treatment conditions, spouses’ weights were
similar at study entry and also changed in similar ways over time.
In addition, even after accounting for this similarity in change
within couples, interdependence remained. In other words, there
were additional factors that led to similar successes in weight loss
within couples. This highlights the utility of studying weight loss at
the level of the couple rather than focusing on the individual.
The strengths of our study include the randomized design, objec-
tive measurement of weight in both participants and untreated
spouses, and the use of dyadic growth curve models. Study limita-
tions include the lack of diversity in the sample in terms of race
and ethnicity as well as sexual orientation. Additional research is
needed to examine whether a ripple effect is detected in families
with more diverse demographic characteristics. Further examination
over a longer follow-up period is also needed to determine the
mechanism of the ripple effect, variations in the magnitude of the
ripple effect over time, and whether the likelihood of a ripple
effect is dependent, in part, on relationship characteristics (e.g.,
marital satisfaction, cohesiveness) or other family level variables
(e.g., types of foods in the home). Whether these ripple effects
occur passively or through a more active effort on the part of
untreated family members (e.g., self-initiating dietary changes,
engaging in a structured weight management program on their
own) is also worth considering (8).
This study adds to the growing literature, suggesting that weight and
weight change within married couples is highly interdependent.
Exploring ways to actively involve spouses in treatment to more
effectively harness household and social dynamics to promote clini-
cally significant weight loss could improve the reach and cost-
effectiveness of weight management programs.O
