Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy and in particular monoclonal antibodies blocking the inhibitory programed cell death 1
pathway (PD-1/PD-L1) have made a significant impact on the treatment of cancer patients in recent years.
However, despite the remarkable clinical efficacy of these agents in a number of malignancies, it has become clear
that they are not sufficiently active for many patients. Initial evidence, for example with combined inhibition of
PD-1 and CTLA-4 in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), has highlighted the potential to further
enhance the clinical benefits of monotherapies by combining agents with synergistic mechanisms of action. In
order to address the current progress and consider challenges associated with these novel approaches, the Society
for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) convened a Combination Immunotherapy Task Force. This Task Force was
charged with identifying and prioritizing the most promising prospects for combinatorial approaches as well as
addressing the challenges associated with developing these strategies. As a result of the extensive clinical benefit
and tolerable side effects demonstrated with agents inhibiting the PD-1 pathway, an overview of current evidence
to support its promising potential for use as a backbone in combination strategies is presented. In addition, key
issues in the development of these strategies including preclinical modeling, patient safety and toxicity
considerations, clinical trial design, and endpoints are also discussed. Overall, the goal of this manuscript is to
provide a summary of the current status and potential challenges associated with the development and clinical
implementation of these strategies.

Background
The strategy of using monoclonal antibodies against
inhibitory receptors on immune cells, termed immune-
checkpoint blockade, for the treatment of cancer has
triggered substantial enthusiasm among clinicians, scien-
tists, and patients [1]. The efficacy of this approach was
first proven in patients with advanced melanoma based
on the improved overall survival (OS) of patients treated
with the anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein
4 (CTLA-4) directed monoclonal antibody ipilimumab
[2, 3]. The impressive anti-tumor activity of PD-1/PD-L1
blockade not only in melanoma and renal cell cancer,
but also in tumors previously not considered immune-
responsive, particularly NSCLC reported initially in
2012, provided proof of concept for the efficacy of
immunotherapy as a more broadly applicable tool for
the treatment of cancer [4, 5]. Since then, PD-1/PD-L1
inhibition
has
demonstrated
remarkable
anti-tumor
activity, including durable responses for several years, in
a broad spectrum of solid and hematological malignan-
cies, leading to regulatory approval of an increasing list
of agents in a growing number of cancers. Nevertheless,
the clinical efficacy of PD-1 pathway inhibition as mono-
therapy has been limited to subsets of patients in most
tumor types studied to date, with response rates of 20%
or less in many cancers including common types such as
breast, colon, and prostate cancer. While predictive
biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression on tumor and
immune cells [6], mutational/neoantigen load [7–9], and
inflammatory gene signatures [10, 11] may allow enrich-
ment of patient populations that are responsive to this
therapy, combination therapies will likely be required to
enhance and broaden the anti-tumor activity of immune
checkpoint inhibition.

 Agent prioritization
Backbone of combination therapies
The established anti-tumor activity of PD-1/PD-L1 in-
hibition as monotherapy in a wide spectrum of cancers
coupled with its favorable toxicity profile provides a
strong rationale for its use as a backbone for combina-
torial strategies. Despite the vastly accelerated pace of
preclinical and clinical investigation of other cancer im-
munotherapy agents in recent years, this combination of
broad single agent activity and tolerability seen with PD-
1 pathway inhibition is so far unparalleled; there are no
other compounds on the horizon that could take the
place of PD-1 pathway inhibition for this purpose.
Partnering agents with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 backbone
Guiding principles
There is emerging evidence that immune checkpoint
blockade is effective primarily in tumors that are already
recognized by the immune system, as manifest by a pre-
existent CD8+ T cell infiltrate. Broadly speaking, the lack
of a spontaneous tumor directed immune response may
be because of the “invisibility” of the tumor to the im-
mune system due to tumor antigens that are not suffi-
ciently distinct from self-antigens; alternatively, tumor
cell intrinsic oncogenic pathways may actively subvert
an antitumor immune response as was shown for the β-
catenin pathway [12]. Approaches that have the potential
to convert a “non-T cell inflamed” tumor into a T cell
inflamed tumor such as novel vaccines, oncolytic virus
approaches, stimulation of co-stimulatory molecules,
targeted therapy (such as BRAF/MEK inhibition in
BRAF mutant melanoma, ALK inhibition in ALK–rear-
ranged NSCLC), radiation/chemotherapy, and adoptive
cell therapy (T cells, CARs) should be prioritized – par-
ticularly for tumor types that have shown little re-
sponse to single agent anti-PD-1/PD-L therapy and for
individual patients, ideally biomarker-selected, who
have lower predicted response to the PD-1/PD-L1
backbone. Strategies that primarily address additional
immunosuppressive mechanisms in the tumor micro-
environment, such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxgenase (IDO)-
inhibition, TGF-β blockade, regulatory T cell (Treg) deple-
tion, and angiogenesis inhibition may be particularly
effective to enhance or rescue tumor responses achieved
with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy.
Vaccines
Anti-PD-1 monotherapy may be limited by the size of
the pool and specificity of pre-existent tumor directed T
cells generated by physiological interaction of the evolv-
ing tumor and the host immune system. Particularly for
tumors with low mutational burden, it is conceivable
that insufficient numbers of T cell clones are spontan-
eously primed by tumor antigens, and therefore, a
critical threshold of T cells is not reached to trigger an
immune infiltrate. An effective vaccine may provide the
necessary stimulation to broaden the repertoire of T cells
engaged in the anti-tumor response. The accumulating
evidence for tumor neoantigens as critical target anti-
gens for tumor rejection coupled with the striking
correlation
of
anti-CTLA-4
and
anti-PD-1
induced
tumor responses with the mutational/neoantigen load in
NSCLC, melanoma, and microsatellite instability (MSI)
high tumors make a strong case for vaccination targeting
neoantigens [7–9, 13, 14]. The most effective vaccination
strategies will aim to co-administer neoantigens, or other
potential antigens that can be targets for T cell recognition
(e.g., tissue differentiation or cancer stem cell associated
antigens), with strong immune-adjuvants such as TLR
agonists,
possibly
taking advantage
of new
delivery
systems such as novel material engineered scaffolds.
Oncolytic viruses
The oncolytic virus talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC)
has shown systemic anti-tumor activity in advanced
melanoma, leading to its regulatory approval in the
United States, European Union, and Australia for the
treatment of melanoma [15]. Similar to vaccination,
oncolytic virus therapy has the potential to induce
priming of T cells, leading to T cell mediated cytolysis of
directly injected as well as distant tumor metastases. In
phase I trials, the combination of T-VEC with ipilimu-
mab as well as with pembrolizumab has shown higher
objective tumor responses compared to ipilimumab and
pembrolizumab monotherapy [16, 17]. Larger trials
testing both combinations are ongoing.
Agonistic co-stimulatory antibodies
Costimulatory molecules such as CD137 (4-1BB), CD134
(OX40), glucocorticoid-induced TNFR (GITR; CD357),
and CD40 are expressed by activated T cells, activated
natural killer (NK) cells, natural killer T (NKT) cells,
Tregs, and other immune cells [18]. Stimulation of these
molecules can lead to increased effector functions (cyto-
kine production and cytolytic activity), restrained suppres-
sive activity of Tregs, enhanced cytokine secretion by NK
cells, and enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotox-
icity. Preclinical single agent anti-tumor activity including
durable complete responses has been shown in murine
tumor models as well as in early clinical trials [19, 20].
Combined activation of CD137 and inhibition of PD-1
was synergistic in an ovarian cancer model and is cur-
rently undergoing clinical testing [21, 22]. The inhibition
of the immunologic checkpoint PD-1 and stimulation of
costimulatory molecules are complementary strategies to
enhance immune responses and therefore provide a
strong rationale for use in combination.

 Adoptive T cell therapy, CAR-T cell therapy
Adoptively transferred T cells generated from tumor
TILs, T cells bearing engineered, tumor specific T cell
receptors, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells
all have shown remarkable anti-tumor activity in select
solid and hematological malignancies [23–25]. CAR T
cells and T cells with engineered tumor specific TCRs
may have the ability to induce an inflamed tumor micro-
environment and therefore to be promising partnering
strategies with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.
CTLA-4 blockade/other checkpoint inhibitors
The combination of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition with block-
ade of the non-redundant and complementary check-
point CTLA-4 is backed by strong pre-clinical evidence
and has proven very effective in advanced melanoma
patients in phase I-III trials, as manifest by rapid, dur-
able responses in a high proportion of patients [26–28].
This remarkable success provides the rationale for
ongoing clinical investigation of combined PD-1/PD-L1
and CTLA-4 inhibition in many different tumor types
and the exploration of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition in com-
bination with inhibition of other immune checkpoints
such as Tim-3 and Lag-3.
Targeted therapy
Oncogenic pathway inhibition such as BRAF and MEK
inhibition in melanoma has shown many effects on
tumor and immune cells, including increased expression
of melanoma differentiation antigens and HLA on mel-
anoma cells, paradoxical activation of the MAPK path-
way in T lymphocytes, induction of PD-L1 expression,
and inhibition of suppressive cytokines such as IL-10
and VEGF [29]. Melanoma antigen expression in human
tumor samples was decreased at the time of tumor pro-
gression and restored with subsequent combined MEK/
BRAF inhibition [30]. Furthermore, increased CD8+ T
cell tumor infiltration was observed in early tumor sam-
ples in patients treated with BRAF inhibition. This pre-
clinical evidence supports the investigation of PD-1/PD-
L1 inhibition with BRAF/MEK inhibition and potentially
with other oncogenic pathway inhibitors. The restor-
ation of other abnormal oncogenic signals in cancer
cells, such as in the Wnt-β-catenin, AKT-PI3K-mTOR,
and
epidermal
growth
factor
(EGF)/EGF
receptor
(EGFR) signaling pathways, may also be promising strat-
egies for combination immunotherapy approaches.
Angiogenesis-inhibition
By facilitating both the growth of cancer cells and immune
suppression, tumor angiogenesis is an important link
between a tumor and the immune response directed
against that tumor. VEGF modulates anti-tumor immun-
ity on multiple levels including promotion and expansion
of inhibitory immune cell subsets (Tregs and MDSC),
inhibition of dendritic cell (DC) maturation, suppression
of T cell responses, and immune cell trafficking across
tumor endothelia [31–33]. Combination treatment of
advanced melanoma patients with ipilimumab and bevaci-
zumab led to intense infiltration of the tumor vasculature
with CD8+ T cells and CD163+ dendritic macrophages,
increased E-selectin expression (indicating endothelial
activation), and higher numbers of circulating memory
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (CCR7+/−CD45RO+) in the
peripheral blood [34]. The clinical benefit appeared prom-
ising compared to historical data with ipilimumab alone.
Consequently, targeting angiogenesis may be an effective
strategy to increase the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition.
Several clinical trials investigating this combination are
ongoing in multiple tumors types, including melanoma,
renal cell cancer, and NSCLC [33].
Radiation therapy
Radiotherapy promotes the release or expression of
tumor antigens in addition to immune adjuvant-like
effects, leading to stimulation of immune responses. In
animal models, this “in situ tumor vaccination”, while
rarely effective as monotherapy, has shown synergy with
various immunotherapy approaches including CTLA-4
blockade [35–37]. More recently, combined radiation
and CTLA-4 blockade showed potential synergy in
advanced melanoma patients [38]. Consistent with an
effective vaccination, radiation when given with CTLA-4
blockade, induced diversification of the T cell receptor
repertoire of TILs and shaped the repertoire of expanded
T cell clones [39]. Resistance to radiation and CTLA-4
blockade was found to be mediated by upregulation of
PD-L1, leading to T cell exhaustion. Taken together, the
findings provide a rationale for combined PD-1 inhibition
and radiotherapy.
Inhibition of IDO
IDO catalyzes the cleavage of L-tryptophan, resulting in
the production of kynurenine. Depletion of tryptophan
and accumulation of kynurenine metabolites led to
increased numbers and function of Tregs and blocked
the proliferation of effector T cells [40, 41]. IDO is
expressed constitutively by tumor cells or by host im-
mune cells such as macrophages and DCs in the tumor
or lymph nodes [42, 43], but can also be induced by
inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ during a tumor
directed immune response, potentially mitigating the
effectiveness of immunotherapy [44]. IDO has been im-
plicated in promoting T cell resistance to anti-CTLA-4
Ab blockade in murine melanoma models. Combined
inhibition of IDO and immune checkpoint blockade
(CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1) has shown T cell dependent
synergy in melanoma and breast cancer mouse models.
Ott et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:16 
Page 3 of 15
 Based on this pre-clinical evidence, several IDO inhibi-
tors are currently in clinical investigation as monother-
apies and in combination with CTLA-4 and PD-1
inhibition. Promising response rates in NSCLC and
melanoma with pembrolizumab plus the IDO inhibitor
epacadostat were recently reported, leading to explor-
ation of this combination in a phase III trial in melan-
oma
(NCT02752074)
and
a
recently
announced
expansion of this phase III program into NSCLC, renal,
bladder, and head and neck cancers [45].
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy-induced cancer cell death can promote
tumor antigen presentation potentially leading to prim-
ing of tumor specific T cells in addition to its capacity to
directly stimulate immune effectors and inhibit immune
suppressive factors [46]. Therefore, chemotherapy has
the potential to convert a non-inflamed tumor into an
inflamed one and may thus lead to synergy with PD-1/
PD-L1 inhibition particularly in non-inflamed, chemo-
therapy sensitive tumors.
Cytokines
Cytokines
such
as
granulocyte
macrophage
colony-
stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interferon-α can pro-
mote DC function, leading to increased T cell priming and
enhancing the activity of tumor directed T cells [47, 48].
The potential for additional clinical activity with CTLA-4
blockade has been shown with both GM-CSF and
interferon-α in patients with advanced melanoma [49, 50].
Inhibition of immune suppressive cytokines such as TGF-
β and IL-10 using neutralizing antibodies also has poten-
tial synergistic activity with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Other
immune-potentiating cytokines that have shown activity
against cancer include interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12, IL-15, IL-
18, and IL-21. In a small phase I/II trial of high-dose IL-2
and escalating doses of ipilimumab in 36 patients with
metastatic melanoma, a slightly higher response rate com-
pared to historic monotherapy data (22%) was reported
[51]. Of note, on further follow-up combination treatment
was associated with an unanticipated 17% complete
response rate. These data support further clinical studies
that of combine cytokines and PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, and
several such trials are currently underway.
Pre-clinical murine models for testing of
combination tumor immunotherapy
In contrast to cytotoxic and targeted therapy agents that
directly kill tumor cells, tumor immunotherapy mediates
tumor regression indirectly through activation of innate
and adaptive host immune responses or by reversing
tumor-mediated immune suppression. This implies that
therapeutic responses may follow a more prolonged
kinetic course and also may be associated with immune-
related adverse events (irAEs), which are mediated by
activated immune effector cells in various host tissues.
Based on the unique mechanisms of tumor rejection and
toxicity, murine models used for testing of tumor im-
munotherapy must incorporate interactions between
established tumors, the host tumor microenvironment,
and the immune system to fully evaluate the therapeutic
and toxicity profiles of potential immunotherapy agents
administered alone or in combination. Murine models
are ideal for cancer research because tumors generally
establish quickly, genetic manipulation of the host and
tumors is relatively simple, and mice are easy to main-
tain, monitor, and assess. The characteristic features of
the more commonly used murine tumor models are
described in Table 1.
The standard murine model utilizes a transplantable
tumor system in which cultured cell lines derived from
murine tumors of various origins can be injected, typic-
ally into the subcutaneous region of a mouse. These
tumor cells must be derived in the same genetic back-
ground of the mouse and allows for rapid growth, simple
growth assessment, and peripheral blood can be col-
lected or mice can be euthanized at various times for
toxicity analysis. These models are particularly useful for
rapid studies of potential immunotherapy drug combina-
tions and allow for inclusion of appropriate treatment
controls. The model, however, has numerous limitations,
including the lack of appropriate tumor microenviron-
ment, potential problems with limited host immune
system interactions since tumors often grow quickly,
and local injection may induce inflammation that can
influence tumor growth or drug response. Further, if the
tumor cells harbor foreign transgenes, these may serve
as xenoantigens and inadvertently promote tumor rejec-
tion. In some cases, murine tumor-associated antigens
have been identified and these can be used to monitor
immune responses and determine if tolerance can be
broken
during
combination
immunotherapy.
While
transplantable tumors are usually established in the
subcutaneous location of the flanks, it is possible to
inject the cells orthotopically, or in natural locations in
which the tumor arises, to replicate the normal local
environment. The potential importance of orthotopic
models has been confirmed in at least one study in
which the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy was
less prominent when the cells were implanted into the
kidney compared to subcutaneous tumors [52].
In order to better mimic human tumors, spontaneous
tumor models have been developed in which tumors
arise in the histologic tissue of origin, and these offer the
benefit of more accurately reflecting patterns of tumor
growth and treatment response kinetics. Such models
may also be more appropriate for development and
detection of irAEs. A major drawback to these models is
Ott et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:16 
Page 4 of 15
 that they generally require carcinogen induction or genetic
manipulation, which may limit their clinical relevance.
Examples of carcinogen-induced spontaneous tumors
include methylcholanthrene (MCA)-induced fibrosarco-
mas and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)/12-O-
tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced skin pap-
illomas [52, 53]. While these are more physiologically rele-
vant, they often take longer for cancers to develop and
may be associated with considerable heterogeneity requir-
ing many more animals to obtain the required number of
tumors and determine therapeutic activity. Further, estab-
lishing the timing of treatment may be particularly chal-
lenging since neoplastic transformation may occur over
variable time periods with these models.
Genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) utilize
forced oncogene expression or knockout of known tumor
suppressor genes, usually in a tissue-specific and/or tem-
porally controlled manner [53, 54]. There are now several
well-established, genetically mediated spontaneous tumor
models in use. These include several breast cancer models
in which selected oncogenic transgenes are driven by pro-
moters that drive transgene expression in the mouse
mammary epithelium [55]. The transgenes include Her-2/
neu (ErbB2), polyoma middle T antigen (PyMT), simian
virus 40 (SV40) T antigen, Ha-Ras, Wnt-1, TGF-α, and c-
Myc. Oncogene expression in the MMTV-Neu and
MMTV-PyMT mice is driven by the mouse mammary
tumor virus promoter, and these mice develop multifocal
mammary tumors and can exhibit metastatic disease in
the lungs and lymph nodes, which typically occur after the
first pregnancy. In contrast, the SV40 transgenic mice
develop invasive tumors without the need for hormonal
manipulation. In some cases, tumors require two genetic
defects to promote tumor development.
There have been over 60 spontaneous murine models
of melanoma reported to date [56, 57]. This includes a
model in which the RET oncogene is fused to the
metallothionein-I (MT) promoter-enhancer in a mixed
murine strain background (C57BL/6xBALB/c), which
produced systemic skin melanosis and spontaneous
benign melanocytic tumors [58]. By backcrossing the
mice over 10 times into C57BL/6 mice, a line in which
melanocytic lesions progressed to invasive melanoma
after several months was developed, and tumors eventu-
ally metastasize to lymph nodes and visceral organs.
Bosenberg has developed an especially useful model in
which melanoma is driven by both BRAF mutation and
PTEN loss. These mice, characterized as BrafCATyr-
creERT2Ptenfl/fl, develop melanoma after exposure to 4-
hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT), which induces de novo mel-
anoma initiation [56]. A murine model of autochthonous
lung tumors has been reported using adenoviral vectors

 encoding Cre recombinase, KRAS, and p53 in the pulmon-
ary epithelia [59]. In general, the carcinogen-induced
models are considered highly immunogenic with emer-
gence of numerous neoantigens that can be recognized by
the immune system. In contrast, models driven by germ-
line mutations are typically not very immunogenic [60, 61].
Although it may seem counterintuitive, a number of
immunodeficient murine models have been used to
conduct mechanistic studies of immunotherapy. Today,
there are numerous such models with selective as well
as more global deficiencies in immune cells or immuno-
logic function. These models can, thus, be classified as
those with severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCID)
and
those
with
selective
immunodeficiencies.
The
simplest immune deficient mouse was termed the nude
(nu) mouse, in which thymic development is thwarted
and results in deficient T cell maturation [62]. Nude
mice were originally derived from mice with defects in
the Forkhead box protein N1 (FOXN1) gene [63]. These
mice typically live 6–12 months, accept xenografts and
allow reasonable time for tumor treatment experiments.
Nude females may be unable to nurse their young due
to defects in mammary gland milk production and have
largely been supplanted by SCID models.
A commonly used SCID model is based on knocking
out the V(D)J recombination activation gene (RAG-1).
RAG-1−/− mice lack mature B and T cells, and these
mice generally will not reject transplanted tumors [64].
The potential with these mice is that subpopulations of
lymphocytes can be adoptively transferred, and the
therapeutic impact of various treatment regimens can be
assessed with and without specific lymphocyte popula-
tions. Because of this capability, these models have pro-
vided valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying
antitumor immunity [65–67]. Another SCID model uses
mice with mutations in the Prkdc gene, which encodes a
protein that resolves DNA strand breaks during V(D)J
recombination and results in the absence of functional B
and T cells [68, 69]. These Prkdcscid (also known as non-
obese diabetic or NODscid) mice do have a normal
hematopoietic microenvironment, can accept both allo-
geneic and xenogeneic grafts, allow adoptive transfer
experiments, and rarely develop mature lymphocytes. A
particularly immunodeficient SCID model is the NSG
mouse
(NODscidgamma;
NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid
Il2rgtm1Wjl/
SzJ), a strain of inbred mice in which the Prkdc gene
and IL-2 receptor gamma gene, which is critical for IL-
2-mediated signaling, are knocked out [70]. NSG mice
lack both innate and adaptive immunity with loss of B
cell, T cell, and NK cell function as well as reducedma-
crophage
and antigen-presenting cell function [71].
These mice are highly permissive for xenogeneic tumor
engraftment and have been instrumental in studies of
tumor immunotherapy and other human diseases. A
variety of murine strains in which single molecular path-
ways are disrupted have also been generated and can be
used for selective mechanistic studies.
The selection of immunodeficient murine strains for
experimental studies depends on several features. The
strain background is important as this may influence the
H2 haplotype, tumor cell engraftment potential, and
disease susceptibility. The NOD mice, for example, are
prone to diabetes and lack innate immunity. The func-
tional consequences of the genetic defects also need to
be considered in strain selection. Some mice exhibit
“leakiness”, in which the mice may start to generate
functional immune cells as they age. The emergence of
mature B and T cells has been reported in Prkdcscid mice
when they are older, especially if they are housed in
non-specific pathogen-free conditions. Leakiness may
also be more common in certain genetic backgrounds,
such as C57BL/6 J and BALB/cByJ mice. The lifespan of
individual mouse strains is also an important consider-
ation as some immunodeficient mice die at a young age,
with some becoming susceptible to thymic lymphomas,
and this may limit their potential for long-term experi-
ments. Some strains may also have difficulty breeding, as
occurs with female nude mice, and this can limit useful-
ness. Some strains are highly sensitive to radiation (e.g.,
Prkdcscid mice) and this can limit irradiation prior to en-
graftment or prevent studies of combination approached
that utilize radiation therapy. Some mice also require
pathogen-free environments, and husbandry capabilities
may limit the choice of model. Finally, the impact of
genetic mutations and how these influence cell function
should be considered. For example, mutations in per-
forin can decrease NK cell activity whereas defects in
the IL-2 receptor gamma chain can completely eliminate
NK cell function.
The improved engraftment of human tumor cells in
some of the SCID mouse models has allowed the gener-
ation of so-called humanized mouse models. These
models further utilize the transfer of hematopoietic stem
cells or, more recently autologous peripheral blood, to
reconstitute the normal human immune system [72].
While several models have been proposed with consider-
able progress in replicating human immune-tumor com-
ponents, there is still debate about how closely the
humanized mice mimic the human host. Investigators
are exploring the number of cells transferred, the route
of transfer, the timing and age of transfer, and irradiation
sources to optimize immune engraftment. Whether
these mice truly organize a relevant tumor microenvir-
onment remains unclear, but there is some evidence that
mild graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) can develop,
suggesting these models may be helpful for evaluating
immune system activation and emergence of irAEs [72].
Other strategies in development include engineering

 expression of various cytokines into the mice to allow
for more efficient immune function. Further refinements
may be necessary before these mice can be endorsed as a
significant improvement over other models. The gener-
ation of humanized mice is also complicated by the need
for access to human tumor tissue and hematopoietic cells,
institutional review board (IRB) approval, and often a need
for rapid execution of cell transfer and frequently high
cost to conduct experiments.
Many of the murine models have been helpful for
evaluating therapeutic activity of monotherapy and

agents,
but
few
have
faithfully replicated the toxicity profiles observed in
humans [73–76]. It is possible, however, that the
manifestations of irAEs may be present but challen-
ging to detect in the murine models and may depend
on the length of tumor establishment, background
strain of the mouse used, or subtle impact of genetic
changes in some models. Despite these limitations,
there has been some progress in which autoimmune
side effects have been observed. This includes the
appearance of vitiligo in C57BL/6 mice bearing melanoma
tumors and treated with a variety of immunotherapy strat-
egies or the induction of hypophysitis in SJL/J mice treated
with multiple treatments of CTLA-4 blockade [73, 74]. A
strategy to better evaluate toxicity may be to use murine
models in which the particular mouse strain is more
susceptible to development of autoimmune symptoms
(e.g., NOD, SJL/J, etc.). Another approach may be to add
additional immune regulation to the model. For example,
eradication of CD4 + FoxP3+ Tregs has been reported in
the DEREG mouse model where mice have been engi-
neered to express a diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor-
enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion protein driven
by the FoxP3 gene locus [75]. These mice permit condi-
tional depletion of Tregs using injections of diphtheria
toxin and some experiments have shown that DEREG mice
may be more susceptible to autoimmune-related side
effects with immunotherapy treatment [76].
The availability of numerous murine models that allow
establishment of human tumors and immune system
components provides an important resource for more
rapidly testing rational combinations of immunotherapy
agents. The large number of models further promotes
more relevant systems to assess both therapeutic re-
sponse and propensity for irAEs. While all models have
limitations (see Table 1), the range of models allows
selection of systems that most closely resemble the
particular cancer, immunologic targets, and genetic fac-
tors that most closely mirror the human host and permit
more rapid development of novel combination treatment
strategies for clinical trials.
There has been considerable controversy regarding
limitations, both real and perceived, in the utility of
preclinical tumor models as tools to inform the clinical
development of new oncology agents. While some limi-
tations are certainly clear, in other instances, concerns
may be driven by mouse models being used inappropri-
ately or unrealistically, as opposed to intrinsic flaws in
the models themselves. For several reasons, preclinical
models may be particularly useful for cancer immuno-
therapy and in the development of new combination
immunotherapy regimens [77]. Optimizing the dose,
schedule, and configuration of immunotherapeutic com-
binations may be complex, yet as discussed above, is
critical to additively or synergistically engage immuno-
regulatory mechanisms and maximize the risk-benefit
profile of a given regimen. This may necessitate the
comparison of a range of distinct schedules and configu-
rations for combinations to maximize both their phar-
macodynamic activity and their antitumor efficacy with
acceptable tolerability. While the need for additional
clinical optimization of dose and schedule is often inevit-
able, the assessment of new regimens in rigorous pre-
clinical models may help to substantially focus the scope
and cost of these efforts, and also may enable the inter-
rogation of candidate clinical biomarkers to monitor the
biologic
activity
of
these
combinations.
Preclinical
models may also enable more thorough understanding
of the interaction between tumor and the host immune
system in vivo, and may be utilized to enable rational,
hypothesis-driven
identification
of
mechanism-based
combinations for clinical testing. In tandem with more
rigorous early clinical development of combination regi-
mens, preclinical models may play an important role in
identifying and optimizing the safety, clinical activity,
and overall risk-benefit profile of immunotherapeutic
combinations.
Safety and toxicology
Combination therapy: proof-of-concept and lessons
learned in patient safety
The pronounced clinical activity of checkpoint inhibitors
including antibodies directed against CTLA-4 [2], PD-1
[4, 78] and PD-L1 [5, 79] has transformed the care of
several cancers including melanoma, renal cell carcin-
oma, NSCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer,
Hodgkin lymphoma, and others. In turn, numerous pre-
clinical studies have now demonstrated the synergistic
potential of immunotherapeutic combinations [80–89].
However, it has also shown that substantive incremental
toxicity can result from immunotherapeutic combina-
tions, depending on both the patient population and the
dose and schedule that is utilized [90–93]. In initial
studies in patients with metastatic melanoma, marked
enhancement of clinical activity was observed in patients
treated with the combination of ipilimumab and nivolu-
mab [90, 94] as reflected by the objective response rate
Ott et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:16 
Page 7 of 15
 (ORR), the kinetics and depth of tumor regression, and
landmark rates of OS compared to historical experience
with either ipilimumab or nivolumab alone. In subse-
quent randomized trials, the combination of ipilimumab
and nivolumab has demonstrated superior progression-
free survival (PFS) compared to ipilimumab alone in
patients with melanoma [27, 28], and this combination
has now been approved by the FDA for treatment-naive
patients with melanoma. The initial phase I study of
ipilimumab/nivolumab demonstrated grade 3/4 drug-
related adverse events (AEs) in 53% of patients across
the range of doses tested, while rates of grade 3/4 AEs in
the subsequent randomized phase III were 55% in
patients treated with the combination versus 27.3% or
16.3% among patients treated with either ipilimumab or
nivolumab alone, respectively [27, 90]. Notably, although
standard doses of ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) could be com-
bined safely with doses of nivolumab up to 1 mg/kg, and
standard doses of nivolumab (3 mg/kg) could be com-
bined safely with doses of ipilimumab up to 1 mg/kg,
combined administration of standard doses of both ipili-
mumab (3 mg/kg) and nivolumab (3 mg/kg) was poorly
tolerated and exceeded the maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) for the combination [90]. Nonetheless, despite
the increase in the incidence of grade 3/4 AEs in pa-
tients treated with the combination of ipilimumab and
nivolumab compared to either single agent alone, it is
important to note that observed events were generally
qualitatively similar for patients treated with combin-
ation therapy and the individual single agents. Further,
the institution of algorithm-based supportive care has
also been very effective in management of patients
treated with checkpoint inhibitors and no treatment-
related deaths were attributed to the combination of
ipilimumab/nivolumab in the phase III study [27].
Collectively, these observations highlight the importance
of flexible approaches to optimization of the dose and
schedule
of
immunotherapeutic
combinations.
This
requires rigorous clinical testing of various schedules for
immunotherapeutic combination early in clinical devel-
opment, and may require acceptance of the use of non-
standard doses or schedules of individual agents to
maximize the overall risk-benefit profile of a given com-
bination. The importance of this consideration was
further highlighted by a phase I study combining ipili-
mumab and the Raf inhibitor, vemurafenib, in patients
with melanoma [95]. In this study, the initial cohort of
patients was treated with standard doses of both ipilimu-
mab (3 mg/kg) and vemurafenib (960 mg orally twice
daily) administered concurrently, with plans for dose de-
escalation in the event of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)
on this initial dose level. Substantial increases in toxicity,
in particular hepatotoxicity, were observed in patients
treated at this dose/schedule. Hepatotoxicity was also
observed despite a reduction in the dose of vemurafenib
(720 mg orally twice daily) in combination with the
standard 3 mg/kg dose of ipilimumab. As a result, this
trial was terminated very early, and there has been lim-
ited subsequent development of this combination. A
recent follow-on study evaluated the combination of
vemurafenib and ipilimumab using a sequential schedule
of administration [96]. This regimen demonstrated a
substantially improved safety profile, with marked reduc-
tion in hepatotoxicity compared to the prior study that
administered ipilimumab and vemurafenib concurrently.
These studies clearly highlight the clinical development
challenges and risks in combining immuno-oncology
agents at standard doses and schedules. Attempts to
combine standard doses of these two highly active
agents in patients with melanoma resulted in substantial
incremental toxicity without improvements in clinical
benefit, and further support the notion that when im-
munotherapy agents are used in combination or with
conventional antineoplastic agents, it is reasonable to
anticipate that compromises from standard dosing and
schedules are likely to be required to unlock the thera-
peutic potential of combination regimens with accept-
able risk-benefit. The potential for additional safety
concerns might suggest that dose escalation, run-in, or
sequential schemas should be considered in early phase
clinical development of combination regimens.
Further, active combination regimens may have very
distinct safety profiles in different patient populations, as
illustrated by the experience using ipilimumab + nivolu-
mab in patients with metastatic NSCLC [91]. Although
this combination demonstrated potent antitumor activity
and acceptable tolerability in patients with melanoma
treated with ipilimumab/nivolumab at doses as high as
ipilimumab (1 mg/kg) plus nivolumab (3 mg/kg) or ipili-
mumab (3 mg/kg) plus nivolumab (1 mg/kg) [90], the
tolerability of this combination appeared to be quite
distinct in patients with NSCLC. These same dosing
regimens for ipilimumab and nivolumab were poorly
tolerated in initial studies in patients with NSCLC
despite elimination of the use of ipilimumab beyond in-
duction, with 22/46 (48%) experiencing grade 3/4 AEs,
16 patients with treatment discontinuation due to AEs,
and 3 drug-related deaths [91]. In addition, the overall
ORR of 22% in this study was arguably no better than
the 18% ORR achieved in phase I testing of nivolumab
alone [4]. Additionally, a pilot study in 20 patients with
glioblastoma demonstrated similar themes [92]. Here,
patients were randomly assigned to treatment with
either nivolumab monotherapy (3 mg/kg) every 2 weeks
or
an
induction
regimen
consisting
of
ipilimumab
(3 mg/kg) plus nivolumab (1 mg/kg) every 3 weeks,
followed by nivolumab (3 mg/kg) monotherapy every
2 weeks. Drug-related grade 3/4 AEs were observed in
Ott et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:16 
Page 8 of 15
 8/10 (80%) patients treated with the combination of
ipilimumab and nivolumab, while drug-related AEs were
all grade 1 or 2 in patients treated with nivolumab alone.
Treatment-related discontinuations occurred in 5/10
(50%) patients treated with the combination compared
to none in patients treated with nivolumab alone. Land-
mark 6-month OS rates were essentially the same in the
combination (80%, 8/10 patients) and the nivolumab
monotherapy (70%, 7/10 patients) arms.
Subsequent studies of ipilimumab and nivolumab in
patients with NSCLC have now explored alternative
combination regimens with lower dose intensity, with
demonstration of both improved safety and enhanced
clinical activity [97]. In this study, four distinct regimens
were tested in patients with NSCLC, including Arm A:
ipilimumab (1 mg/kg) plus nivolumab (1 mg/kg) admin-
istered every three weeks, Arm B: ipilimumab (1 mg/kg)
every 6 weeks plus nivolumab (1 mg/kg) every 2 weeks,
Arm C: ipilimumab (1 mg/kg) every 12 weeks plus nivo-
lumab (3 mg/kg) every 2 weeks, and Arm D: ipilimumab
(1 mg/kg) every 6 weeks plus nivolumab (3 mg/kg) every
2 weeks. All four of the arms were clinically active, with
highly favorable ORR achieved for patients treated on
Arm C (39%) and Arm D (31%) compared to the histor-
ical experience with either nivolumab or ipilimumab
alone. The ORR for patients treated on Arm A and Arm
B were 13% and 25%, respectively. Notably, not only
were these alternative regimens highly active, but they
were far better tolerated than the ipilimumab/nivolu-
mab regimens established in patients with melanoma.
The rate of grade 3/4 drug-related AEs ranged from
28 to 35% across the arms, with treatment-related
discontinuations in less than 10% of patients, and no
treatment-related deaths.
This collective experience with the ipilimumab/nivolu-
mab combination highlights both the opportunity for
patients using properly designed combination immuno-
therapy regimens, as well as the clinical development
risks in not approaching the development of these regi-
mens with both considerable flexibility and a rigorous
approach to optimization of dose, schedule, and config-
uration of the respective agents. These studies demon-
strate
that
regimented
use
of
standard
doses
and
schedules of agents based on monotherapy experience
may lead to prohibitive toxicity and erroneous conclu-
sions regarding the therapeutic potential and overall
risk-benefit profile of immunotherapeutic combinations.
In contrast, flexible investigation of non-standard doses
and schedules early in the clinical development of com-
binations,
may
enable
definition
of
regimens
with
additive or synergistic clinical activity with far more
favorable safety profiles than when the same combina-
tions are administered using the approved monotherapy
doses and schedules of the respective agents. In addition,
it appears clear that the optimal dose and schedule for a
given combination may differ across distinct indications
given differences in disease biology and/or co-morbidities
in distinct patient populations.
Safety considerations in early clinical testing
Immunotherapeutic combinations may present unique
challenges that must be considered with respect to the
assessment and management of patient safety. In gen-
eral, immunotherapy agents demonstrate unique safety
profiles that may differ considerably from the majority
of conventional oncology drugs. For example, treatment
with checkpoint inhibitors, including monoclonal anti-
bodies that target CTLA-4, PD-1, or PD-L1 have been
associated with a variety of autoimmune-like inflamma-
tory phenomena that appear to be driven by disruption
of self-tolerance to various normal tissues including
thyroid, pituitary, liver, lung, colon, eye, and skin among
others [98, 99]. Increased awareness of these events,
recognition of the necessity of early diagnosis and inter-
vention with immune-suppression, as well as the develop-
ment of algorithm-based guidelines for the management
of these irAEs has played a key role in enabling broad use
of these agents in multiple tumor types with an acceptable
safety
profile.
Other
immunotherapeutic
approaches
including CAR T cells and CD3-based bispecific agents
have been associated with systemic cytokine release syn-
drome (CRS) including fever, constitutional symptoms,
and in severe instances, hemodynamic compromise
[24, 100, 101]. Substantive improvement in the man-
agement of CRS has been afforded by meticulous support-
ive care, with early and aggressive immunosuppression as
indicated, including the use of neutralizing anti-TNF and/
or anti-IL-6 anti-cytokine antibodies. CAR T cell adminis-
tration has also been associated with distinct, focal neuro-
logic toxicity of uncertain etiology [102]. The experience
derived from the management of AEs in patients treated
with checkpoint inhibitors, cytokines, and CAR T cells has
provided considerable insight that will enable future devel-
opment
of
immunotherapy
combinations.
Common
themes that have emerged from this experience highlight
the importance of meticulous monitoring, early recogni-
tion and intervention with appropriate immune suppres-
sion, close collaboration between pharmaceutical sponsors
and investigators in optimizing approaches for supportive
care, and where appropriate, the implementation of
algorithm-based supportive care regimens.
Clinical trial design considerations
Historically, clinical development of many oncology
combinations has proceeded using traditional develop-
ment paradigms, where individual molecules undergo
rigorous clinical testing as monotherapy, and often,
combination
trials
have
been
deferred
until
clear
Ott et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:16 
Page 9 of 15
 monotherapy proof-of-concept has been established. As
such, single agent phase I and phase II trials with each
agent were typically executed, and only then, would
phase I/II trials be triggered to investigate specific com-
binations. In many instances, failure to demonstrate
substantive monotherapy activity led to cessation of
further clinical development. This approach has been
well-established using small molecules, but may be less
well-suited for some immunotherapy agents, where
clinical development efforts can be terminated prema-
turely based on unrealistic expectations for monotherapy
activity
using
conventional
criteria.
More
recently,
driven by increasing recognition of the potential of
immunotherapeutic combinations, as well as the reality
that some agents may yield only modest clinical activity
as monotherapy yet be highly active in the context of a
therapeutic combination, innovative trial designs have
been deployed increasingly to test these agents [103, 104].
These include run-in trial designs, zig-zag designs with or
without de-escalation, and bifurcated designs among
others. Run-in trial designs offer the prospect, where
appropriate, for staged, sequential combination of an
investigational agent with another standard-of-care drug,
within the same patient after an initial monotherapy run-
in window. At the study level, run-in trial designs may
offer the prospect for getting an initial characterization of
monotherapy safety before each patient is exposed to the
combination, and conceptually, may enable more rapid
identification of the MTD for a regimen depending on the
extent of dose escalation. This approach may be most
appropriate when there is particularly well-substantiated
data suggesting that the safety profile of a given combin-
ation is anticipated to be highly favorable, and the respect-
ive agents clearly have non-overlapping safety profiles.
Such studies can be executed with or without the option
for de-escalation, but are likely used most appropriately
when deployed with the flexibility for dose de-escalation
of either agent. So-called “zig-zag” escalation trials afford
the flexibility to explore various dose combinations of the
respective agents by alternating the increases in dosing of
each agent during dose escalation. This design may be
particularly useful when the key driver of the clinical activ-
ity and/or safety of a given combination is less clear or
when there is an anticipation that a given combination
may have a narrower therapeutic window. Bifurcated
designs also have been used recently for the investigation
of some immunotherapeutic combinations. These are
particularly well-suited for the testing of combinations
where it is anticipated that an investigational agent will
have a modest safety profile and limited potential for
monotherapy clinical activity, yet there is clear rationale
that this agent may synergize when administered in
combination with another drug. In this approach, mono-
therapy dose escalation is executed through several dose
levels with the novel agent. Presuming acceptable safety,
the trial may then “bifurcate” down two distinct paths for
subsequent escalation. On one arm, continued monother-
apy escalation of the novel agent is pursued as appropriate
until the MTD, maximum biologically-effective dose
(MBED), or maximum administered dose (MAD) is
defined. In parallel, escalation of the combination is
pursued on a second arm, typically by combining a dose
of the novel agent that is 1–2 dose levels below the highest
monotherapy dose that already has been shown to be safe,
in combination with another agent. Escalation can then
proceed using either a fixed dose of the second agent or
can proceed using a “zig-zag” approach guided by features
of the specific combination. This approach allows for
more rapid triggering of combination testing in clinical
development, but may not be appropriate for some
combinations. Further, a bifurcated-design trial should
typically be structured so that the dose of the novel agent
being tested in the combination arm does not exceed the
dose that has been deemed safe in the monotherapy arm
of the study.
We are entering an exciting era for combination im-
munotherapy that offers the prospect to build upon the
powerful proof-of-principle established by the clinical
experience
with
combination
checkpoint
blockade.
Several key considerations may play an important role in
enabling future progress with this approach. These
include: a) rigorous assessment of the optimal dose,
sequence, and schedule of agents in both preclinical
models and the clinical setting; b) flexible approaches to
decision-making in the selection of dose and schedule,
and application of this decision-making across multiple
indications; c) recognition that some agents may have
limited monotherapy clinical activity, yet have high po-
tential for clinical activity in the setting of an immuno-
therapy combination; d) careful attention to supportive
care, including education of both patients and all mem-
bers of the health-care team regarding the importance of
early recognition and intervention for the management
of irAEs; and e) the use of properly designed trials that
enable efficient testing of the safety and clinical activity
of combination immunotherapy regimens.
Endpoints
Safety
Novel combinations present the possibility of enhanced
efficacy compared with monotherapies, yet also the real
risk of additional or even novel toxicities. The above
sections addressed the issues to consider in terms of trial
design to incorporate appropriate observation periods
and dosing levels needed to accommodate these issues.
When considering combination therapies, management
algorithms for each agent to be combined should be
readily available. The lessons learned from the clinical
Ott et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:16 
Page 10 of 15
 development of ipilimumab + nivolumab have included a
demonstration of no new toxicities with the combination
compared with monotherapies, while more patients
experienced multiple irAEs. The prior development of
mechanistic management algorithms for both combina-
torial partners allowed for the investigation of this
combination
in
a
global
phase
III
trial
with
no
treatment-related deaths in the combination group
[27]. The investigations of ipilimumab with vemurafe-
nib and ipilimumab with dacarbazine were also important
sources of lessons regarding safety profile expectations. In
both instances, hepatic enzyme elevation was more com-
mon than expected. Both of the non-immunologic part-
ners were previously known to have low hepatic AE rates.
Yet, when combined with the CTLA-4 blocking antibody,
this toxicity was considerably more common [3, 95]. This
should be kept in mind when considering cross-modality
combinations.
Efficacy
Early in the development of ipilimumab, it became ap-
parent that conventional radiographic response criteria
were not capturing the full spectrum of biologic activity
of the agent. Some patients were demonstrating atypical
response with clear disease progression before significant
response occurred and mixed responses with regression
of index lesions despite the appearance of new areas of
disease. Using modified World Health Organization
(mWHO) or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) assessment, either pattern is consid-
ered progressive disease. The underlying mechanism
could be either transient enlargement due to lympho-
cytic infiltration or truly a delay in response due to the
need
for
multiple
epitopes
to
be
recognized
and
responded to. With careful analysis, it was estimated
that 15–25% of melanoma patients treated with ipilimu-
mab who initially were classified as having disease pro-
gression, eventually had response or long-term disease
stabilization and demonstrated long-term survival. This
pattern has also been reported with the oncolytic virus,
T-VEC, in patients with melanoma [20]. These observa-
tions led to the development of a proposed set of new
response criteria, the immune-related response criteria
(irRC) [105, 106]. While the irRC are still considered
non-validated and exploratory, it is also clear that a
subset of patients treated with other immunotherapies
(PD-1 pathway blocking agents) manifest similarly atyp-
ical response kinetics, albeit less frequently [107]. Given
the clinical imperative for rapid drug development, the
use of OS is becoming less practical as a sole primary
endpoint. Therefore, combination studies have employed
PFS and OS as co-primary endpoints as a means to
capture early signals of high activity while also maintain-
ing the importance of OS as the true measure of durabil-
ity that is expected from immunotherapy. In the phase
III study of T-VEC a primary clinical endpoint of dur-
able response rate (DRR) was used, which incorporated
both response rate (based on mWHO criteria) and time
(duration ≥ 6 months).
Registration pathway
The registration pathway for combination therapies can
be considered in a variety of ways. The ipilimumab regis-
tration study (MDX-010-20) followed a ‘contribution of
components’ model for testing ipilimumab, gp100 pep-
tides or the combination. The study hypothesized that the
combination would be superior to either monotherapy. In
the end, the two ipilimumab-containing groups had simi-
lar OS. The presence of all three groups allowed for the
ipilimumab monotherapy group to be evaluated for OS vs
gp100 alone, therefore allowing for the possibility of
demonstrating activity for multiple groups. This type of
trial design is a clean route to prospectively assess combi-
nations in the context of monotherapies but does lead to
large studies. Other considerations in registration pathway
designs include weighing the value of concurrent versus
Table 2 Critical issues in combination immunotherapy drug development
• Combination regimens should be based on scientific evidence of underlying tumor cell and immune system biology whenever possible. There is
evidence that combinations within drug classes (e.g., T cell checkpoint inhibitors) and across classes may be clinically beneficial.
• Murine models have limitations but may be useful for early proof-of-principle for specific combination strategies and can be useful for
understanding the biology and mechanisms of action for certain combinations. These models have generally not been useful for
toxicity assessment.
• While combination therapy may be anticipated to improved therapeutic effectiveness, the approach may also increase the potential for
adverse events. This possibility should be carefully considered in developing clinical study designs for combination immunotherapy.
• Innovative clinical study designs may be useful for early phase combination immunotherapy development. These may include dose escalation,
dose de-escalation, zig-zag, run-in and sequential administration designs. A better understanding of the adverse event profile, as may be
obtained from small monotherapy phase I studies, is helpful in optimizing the design of combination trials.
• The unique mechanism of action for immunotherapy agents suggests that new clinical endpoints may be needed for early phase drug
development. The use of progressionfree survival may be misleading given the delayed kinetics of response that can occur with some
agents and regimens. New endpoints, such as immune-related response criteria or durable response rate, may be better for predicting
clinical benefit in late stage studies.
• Early and frequent discussion with regulatory agencies should be considered for combination immunotherapy regimens.
• Other issues, such as intellectual property, conflict of interest, quality of life, patientreported outcomes, and the financial costs vs. overall
health benefits as defined in the value proposition of combination immunotherapy, will be important issues for further discussion.

 sequential schedules. Another niche for combination drug
development is the ‘add-in’ design where a new agent is
added at the time of progression on the ‘foundational’
agent. Given that all patients treated with the combination
will have progressive disease when beginning combination
therapy, a modest degree of clinical activity with the
additional agent could represent a rapid route to registra-
tion. One other consideration in designing combination
registration pathways is that combination immunotherapy
may have a different degree of tolerability in patients with
different malignancies. Therefore, flexibility in dose levels
and frequency needs to be considered when evaluating
combinations across different disease types. Early and
more frequent dialogue with regulatory agencies may also
be helpful in designing and conducting combination
immunotherapy clinical trials.
Conclusions
The number of cancer patients who benefit from im-
munotherapy has increased due to a better understand-
ing of the immune response to cancer along with recent
advances in biomarker development. The goal of com-
bination approaches is to expand the spectrum of
patients who respond to cancer immunotherapy (more
responding patients in tumors that are sensitive to
monotherapy and the identification of new sensitive
tumor types that do not respond to monotherapy alone)
and to improve the quality of clinical responses (i.e., ex-
tension of response duration, PFS, and OS) beyond what
can be achieved with monotherapy alone. With research
to further elucidate the mechanisms of action behind
these agents as well as increased understanding of the
resistant counter defense employed by tumors, the
development of rational combination approaches is now
extending even beyond doublets. Novel triplet regimens
of synergistic combinations of immunotherapy agents as
well as immunotherapy with conventional or targeted
therapies are being investigated in a variety of disease
settings.
There
is
tremendous
potential
for
these
approaches to extend the clinical success of immuno-
therapies. However, the added benefit of each additional
drug must be properly evaluated against the added toxic-
ities as well as economic impact of the cost of these
strategies (the “value proposition”). Previous experience
also demonstrates that combination approaches should
not be developed solely on the standard dosing and
regimens of single agents. Instead, there is a need to
investigate the dose and schedule of combination im-
munotherapies thoroughly and with added flexibility to
optimize the dose, schedule, and configuration of each
agent. Moreover, the optimal dose and schedule for a
given combination may differ across disease indications.
Although pre-clinical animal models have limitations,
they can be useful for assessing the therapeutic potential
of specific combination regimens, interrogating the
mechanism of action, and providing insight into the
underlying biology of various therapeutic strategies. Pro-
gress in combination immunotherapy will also depend
on thorough clinical testing, with proper clinical trial
design and endpoints. The SITC Combination Therapies
Taskforce has summarized the critical issues currently
facing the clinical development of combination immuno-
therapy (Table 2). These issues should help focus further
development and promote discussion among academic,
industry, and regulatory partners to more fully realize
the potential of combination immunotherapy for the
treatment of cancer.
