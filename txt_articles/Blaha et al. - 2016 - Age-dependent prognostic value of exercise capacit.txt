ABSTRACT
Objective Given the aging population and prevalence
of sedentary behaviour in the USA, we investigated the
impact of differences in exercise capacity associated with
age on long-term outcomes. We derived fitness-
associated ‘biologic age’ as a tool to encourage positive
lifestyle changes.
Methods This retrospective cohort study included
57 085 patients without established coronary artery
disease or heart failure (median age 53 years, 49%
women, 29% black) who underwent clinically-referred
treadmill stress testing at the Henry Ford Health System
from 1991 to 2009. Patients were followed for 10.4±5
and 5.4±4 years for all-cause mortality and myocardial
infarction (MI), respectively. We calculated hazard ratios
associated with exercise capacity by age deciles using
Cox regression models, adjusting for demographic and
haemodynamic data, medical history, and medication
use. Fitness-associated ‘biologic age’ was derived as the
chronologic age with equivalent mortality or MI risk.
Results There were 6356 deaths and 1646 MIs during
follow-up. Exercise capacity declined with increasing age.
Higher exercise capacity was strongly associated with
greater survival, with per-MET HR ranging from 0.82
(95% CI 0.78 to 0.86) in patients under 40 years of
age, to 0.88 (95% CI 0.87 to 0.90) in those over
70 years of age. Biologic age varied markedly—up to
three decades—within each age decile, and was a
stronger predictor of mortality (C-statistic 0.81 vs 0.77)
and MI (C-statistic 0.72 vs 0.68) than chronologic age.
Conclusions Higher exercise capacity remained a
powerful predictor of survival despite lower average
exercise capacity at older ages, reinforcing its importance
in patients of all ages. Fitness-associated biologic age
was a stronger predictor of survival than chronologic
age, and may be a useful clinical tool for facilitating
patient discussions regarding the impact of exercise
capacity on long-term risk.
INTRODUCTION
Exercise capacity is a strong and independent pre-
dictor of morbidity and mortality in many diverse
patient populations,1–6 and is a stronger prognostic
indicator than many traditional and non-traditional
risk factors.6–8 Achieving and maintaining higher
exercise capacity remains an important consider-
ation in patients of all ages,7 9 10 despite reports of
age-related declines in exercise capacity and its
prognostic value.11–13 Even though the importance
of maintaining exercise capacity is well-known, the
prevalence of sedentary behaviour in the USA sug-
gests that new methods of encouraging positive life-
style
changes
are
needed,
and
would
have
important public health ramifications given the
aging population.14
‘Biologic ages’ have previously been derived uti-
lising other prognostic indicators such as forced
expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1),15 coronary
artery calcium (CAC),16–19 and serum cholesterol.20
Notably, utilising biologic age may enable more
accurate
risk
stratification
than
chronologic
age,17–19 21 and may improve patient understanding
and compliance with important lifestyle changes
including smoking cessation.15 20 However, deriv-
ation of fitness-associated biologic age has not been
performed, despite exercise capacity being one of
the strongest prognostic predictors of survival,6–9
and having the clinical potential to counsel against
sedentary behaviour that remains a vital target for
the prevention of heart disease and mortality.22
This study describes the interaction between age
and exercise capacity on risk for all-cause mortality
and myocardial infarction (MI) in a multi-ethnic
cohort of patients clinically referred for exercise
testing. W
e hypothesised that exercise capacity will
remain an important predictor of survival. In add-
ition, we sought to calculate the ‘fitness-associated
biologic age’ to potentially enhance risk stratifica-
tion and promote physical activity.
METHODS
Study design
This study is based on data from the Henry Ford
ExercIse T
esting Project (The FIT Project), a retro-
spective cohort study aimed at investigating the
long-term implications of exercise capacity on car-
diovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality.23
The FIT Project is unique in its combined use of:
(1) directly measured exercise data; (2) retrospect-
ive collection of medical history and medication
treatment data taken at the time of the stress test;
(3) retrospective supplementation of supporting
clinical data using the electronic medical record
(EMR) and administrative databases; and (4) epide-
miologic follow-up for all-cause mortality and
select non-fatal outcomes via linkage with a death
registry and medical claims files, respectively.
The FIT Project cohort represents a registry of
69 885
consecutive
patients

 Michigan, between 1991 and 2009.23 These medical centres are
part of a large, vertically-integrated organisation that provides
healthcare and offers a managed care insurance plan. Treadmill,
medical history, and medication data were collected by exercise
physiologists and nurses, and entered at the time of testing into
a common clinical reporting tool that directly populated the
EMR. Supporting clinical data and follow-up for cardiovascular
outcomes were derived from the EMR and administrative data-
bases shared across Henry Ford Health System. Data from The
FIT Project was gathered retrospectively, de-identified in the
dataset, and approved by the Henry Ford Health System
Institutional Review Board.
Study population
W
e considered patients from The FIT Project cohort who did
not have a baseline history of established coronary artery disease
(CAD) or heart failure (n=58 818). Patients were further
excluded if any covariates of interest were missing (n=1733),
leaving a study population of 57 085 individuals. Patients were
categorised according to age into five age groups: <40, 40–49.9,
50–59.9, 60–69.9, and ≥70 years of age.
Exercise testing
All patients underwent routine, clinically-referred, symptom-
limited treadmill stress testing following the standard Bruce
protocol.24 For individuals with repeat stress testing, only the
results from the first test were considered in the registry. Patients
<18 years old at the time of stress testing and patients tested
using non-Bruce protocol tests were not included in the registry.
In accordance with clinical guidelines,25 treadmill testing was
terminated at the discretion of the supervising clinician for
reasons that included significant arrhythmias, abnormal haemo-
dynamic responses, diagnostic ST-segment changes, exercise-
limiting symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath, or
if the patient was unwilling or unable to continue. Resting heart
rate and blood pressure were taken before stress testing by clin-
ical personnel. Exercise capacity, expressed as estimated meta-
bolic equivalents of task (MET), was calculated by the treadmill
controller
system
(Q-Stress,
Quinton
Instruments,
Bothell,
W
ashington, USA) using peak speed and grade—rather than dur-
ation—based on equations reported by the American College of
Sports Medicine, and was further categorised into four groups
for select analyses: <6, 6–9, 10–11, and ≥12 METS.
Medical history and medication use
A medical history including age, gender, race, indication for
testing, risk factor burden, active medication use, and past
medical history was obtained by trained nurses and/or exercise
physiologists immediately before the stress test. Race was
defined exclusively by self-report. Obesity was defined by self-
report and/or assessment by the clinician historian. Current
smoking was defined as self-reported active smoking at the time
of testing. Family history of CAD was defined as compatible
history in a first degree relative. Indication for stress testing was
extracted from the stress test requisition provided by the refer-
ring physician, and subsequently categorised into common indi-
cations (chest pain, shortness of breath, preoperative evaluation,
etc).
Information on medication use and past medical history was
supplemented by a retrospective search of the EMR, administra-
tive databases, and/or pharmacy claims files from enrollees in
the integrated health plan. A database-verified diagnosis was
considered present when the appropriate International Statistical
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 9th
revision (ICD-9) code was present on ≥3 separate encounters
within the health system. Diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia,
and hypertension were defined as a self-reported prior diagno-
sis, a database-verified diagnosis, and/or use of medications for
each medical condition.
Follow-up and event adjudication
Mortality was ascertained in April 2013, after federal law
changes in 2011 limited reporting of certain deaths by state agen-
cies.26 An algorithmic search of the Social Security Death Index
(SSDI) Death Master File (DMF) was completed using social
security number, first name, last name, and date of birth data.
MIs were ascertained in May 2010 through linkage with
administrative
claims
files
from
services
delivered
by
the
affiliated group practice and/or reimbursed by the health plan.
Linkage was performed using the appropriate ICD-9 and
Current Procedural T
erminology (CPT) codes for MI. To limit
bias associated with loss to follow-up, patients were censored
for MI outcomes at their last contact with the integrated Henry
Ford Health System group practice when ongoing coverage with
the health plan could no longer be confirmed.
Statistical analysis
Baseline age groups were compared using χ2 testing or analysis
of variances techniques as appropriate. W
e constructed separate
best-fit equations for men and women comparing exercise cap-
acity to age. Fractional polynomial equations were tested, but
did not improve model fit over a linear model derived with
interaction terms between age, gender, and a single optimum
inflection point at age 55. Parsimonious linear equations are pre-
sented due to their simplicity for clinical practice.
Unadjusted cumulative incidence of mortality and MIs was
derived from Kaplan-Meier estimates, with point estimates cal-
culated at median follow-up times of 10.4 and 5.4 years for
mortality and MI, respectively. Cox regression models were uti-
lised to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) associated with METS
by categories, and as a continuous variable. Models were add-
itionally adjusted for age (as a continuous variable, to limit
residual confounding), gender, race, resting heart rate, resting
systolic and diastolic blood pressures, history of hypertension,
dyslipidaemia, obesity, smoking, diabetes mellitus, family history
of CAD, presence of medications used to treat chronic obstruct-
ive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension or hyperlipid-
aemia, and indication for stress testing.
W
e derived fitness-associated biologic age analogously to pre-
viously published methodology calculating ‘arterial age’ from
CAC.16 Briefly, within each gender and age group, independent
linear parametric survival models satisfying the proportional
hazards assumption were generated separately for chronologic
age and METS achieved. Fitness-associated biologic age for each
MET value was then calculated by equating the two hazards,
corresponding to the chronologic age in which equivalent risk
was observed. Biologic age was determined over the 5th–95th
centile range of METS values within each age group to prevent
over-extrapolation. This procedure was performed separately
for both mortality and MI.
To formally compare the predictive value of chronologic
versus biologic age, Cox proportional hazard models were per-
formed separately for both chronologic and biologic age as uni-
variate variables, and as part of the Framingham Risk Score
(FRS). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic
(ROC) curves for each outcome were compared using standard
techniques. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata
(V
.13.1, 2014; StataCorp, College Station, T
exas, USA).

 RESULTS
Baseline characteristics
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics and stress test results
for the study population (n=57 085), which included 27 714
(49%) women and 16 375 (29%) blacks. Mean age of the study
sample at baseline was 53±13 years. Across increasingly older
age groups, our population had a progressively higher propor-
tion of women, whites, and patients with a history of diabetes,
hyperlipidaemia, and hypertension. Older patients also tended
to have higher resting systolic blood pressure, have a family
history of CAD, and were more likely referred for stress testing
due to shortness of breath and preoperative assessment. Younger
patients were more likely to be referred for stress testing due to
chest pain. Tobacco use and obesity were most common in the
50–59.9 year age group (p<0.001 for all covariates).
The study cohort achieved a mean exercise capacity of 9.2
±3 METS,
declining
progressively
from
11.1±3 METS
in
patients under 40 years old to 6.3±2 METS in patients over
70 years old (p<0.001). Figure 1 shows the predicted MET
achieved by age and gender. A steeper decline in exercise cap-
acity was observed beginning most prominently during the sixth
decade of life in both men and women. Distribution of MET
levels is shown in online supplementary eTable 1.
Risk for mortality and MIs
Patients were followed for a mean of 10.4±5 and 5.4±4 years
for all-cause mortality and incident MI, respectively. There were
6356 deaths and 1646 MIs during follow-up. Table 2 shows the
unadjusted cumulative incidence of mortality and MI at median
follow-up. The largest absolute differences in mortality rate
were observed in the older age groups.
Figure 2 shows the adjusted HRs for mortality and MI asso-
ciated with exercise capacity by age group. Online supplemen-
tary eTable 2 shows the per-MET HRs with stratification by
gender. Higher METS achieved were associated with lower mor-
tality and MI risk in both men and women of all age groups.
Notably, older age consistently and progressively attenuated the
association
between
exercise
capacity
and
mortality
(Ptrend<0.01), but not the association between exercise capacity
and MI (Ptrend=0.35). The association between exercise capacity
and
mortality
was
strongest
in

age
groups
(Ptrend<0.01).

 biologic age for both mortality and MI, independent of gender
and age group. Biologic ages varied widely within each age
group, with the smallest range (18 years) observed in men over
70 years and the largest range (38 years) in women under
40 years of age. A 45-year-old woman who achieved 5 vs 13
METS had an equivalent mortality risk of a 60- vs a 27-year-old
woman, respectively.
Notably in univariate models, biologic age had significantly
stronger predictive accuracy compared to chronologic age for
mortality
(C-statistic:
0.81
vs
0.77,
p<0.001)
and
MI
(C-statistic: 0.72 vs 0.68, p<0.001). When biologic age was
substituted for chronologic age in FRS models, similar findings
for mortality (C-statistic: 0.72 vs 0.70, p<0.001) and MI
(C-statistic: 0.71 vs 0.69, p<0.001) were observed.
Sensitivity analyses
Sensitivity analyses were performed, excluding those who (1)
died within 1 year of their stress test (n=276), (2) underwent
stress testing for preoperative cardiac evaluations (n=1096), and
(3) failed to achieve 85% of their age-predicted maximal heart
rate (n=11 053). W
e further adjusted for (4) the decade in
which each stress test took place to account for improvements
in management of chronic diseases over time, (5) body mass
index (BMI) in patients for whom BMI data were collected
(n=36 323), and (6) baseline β-blocker therapy to account for
potential influences on exercise capacity.27 Overall, there were
no clinically significant changes to our main results, though mild
but statistically significant attenuations were noted in patients on
β-blocker therapy (see online supplementary eTable 4). Online
supplementary eTable 5 shows the BMI sensitivity analyses.
DISCUSSION
Our study has important public health implications for antici-
pating prognosis in an aging and sedentary population. Higher
exercise capacity was associated with lower risk for mortality
and MI in patients of all ages, with stronger associations
between exercise capacity and mortality observed in younger
patients. Fitness-associated biologic age was a stronger predictor
of mortality and MI than chronologic age in our cohort. This
information may enhance patient understanding of their fitness-
mediated risk, and encourage physical activity and other positive
lifestyle changes.
Risk for mortality and MI
Despite lower exercise capacity observed with older age, exer-
cise capacity remained inversely associated with risk for mortal-
ity and MI in all patients independent of age. The relative
association of exercise capacity with mortality diminished with
older age (Pinteraction<0.001), likely reflecting the greater mortal-
ity burden from competing causes in older patients. The
per-MET mortality risk reductions in our study—ranging from
18% in the youngest patients to 12% in the oldest patients—
were similar to observations in other more limited popula-
tions,9 12 and notably were greater than those reported through
non-exercise-based models.13 W
e observed per-MET MI risk
reductions of approximately 12% in our cohort without signifi-
cant effect modification of MI risk from age, though this latter
finding may be secondary to insufficient power in our cohort.
Overall, exercise capacity remained among the strongest pre-
dictors of both overall and MI-free survival in all patients,
reinforcing its continued importance in clinical practice as a
modifiable risk factor.6–8 Patients often ask “How much fitness
is enough?”. Our data suggest that a reasonable initial goal is to

given the observed dose–response relationship between exercise
capacity and survival, patients should ultimately be encouraged
to be as fit as is practical for their lifestyle and genetics.

tions is often guided by risk factor-based algorithms such as the
FRS and the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD)
Risk Estimator.28 29 However, there is substantial heterogeneity
in outcomes within chronologic age groups that is not appre-
ciated by these algorithms, which place considerable emphasis
on chronologic age as a marker of disease burden such that all
older men are classified as ‘high-risk’ regardless of functional
status. The resulting inability to identify ‘healthy agers’ among
the elderly, and ‘unhealthy youth’, could result in over- and
under-treatment in these populations, respectively,18 19 21 which
highlights the clinical need for more accurate risk stratification.
Deriving biologic age from exercise capacity—analogous to
‘arterial age’ derived from CAC scores—has not been previously
described in detail despite its potential clinical utility.16 17 In
our study, fitness-associated biologic age demonstrated greater
discrimination for mortality and MI than chronologic age in
univariate analyses and when substituted in established risk
stratification models such as the FRS. Assessment for biologic
age may therefore help identify those who would likely benefit

Patients often underestimate the role that fitness plays in
determining survival, which may account for variations of up to
three decades in our cohort. Utilising biologic age provides an
intuitive understanding of fitness-mediated risk and may prompt
greater compliance with important lifestyle changes (eg, “you
are 45 years old, but your current level of fitness puts you at the
same risk for death as a 60-year-old”). In marked contrast,
proper interpretation of exercise capacity is non-intuitive due to
the lack of clinical consensus on exercise capacity cutoffs, and
the need for considering gender differences and age-related
declines.13
The clinical impact of fitness-associated biologic age has not
been studied; however, strategies utilising biologic age derived
from other prognosticators have been reported to improve
patient understanding and compliance with lifestyle modifica-
tions including smoking cessation.15 20 Given the prognostic
importance of exercise capacity as a modifiable risk factor and
the non-intuitive interpretation of exercise capacity,6–9 13 deter-
mining fitness-associated biologic age may facilitate patient dis-
cussions on their fitness-mediated risk, with
the goal
of
promoting physical activity in a sedentary population.
Limitations
W
e examined a referral population that is likely enriched in
comorbidities compared to healthier cohorts. Our results also
may be less generalisable to those at the extremes of age. W
e
lacked data on longitudinal changes in exercise capacity, pre-
venting further assessment for changes in biologic age over
time. Key factors that may determine survival such as frailty,
substance misuse, diet, physical activity, depression, poor renal
function, and other comorbidities may not have been fully
accounted for. Cohort effects from changes in secular trends
involving smoking, diet, and medical management may have
been present but did not significantly alter our findings in sensi-
tivity analyses. Medical history was derived partly through self-
report and presumed indications for medications, which may
have been prescribed for other conditions. Sensitivity analyses
were conducted to control for confounders from misclassifica-
tions in medical history with no significant changes to our
results.
Like all cohort studies, a causal relationship between exercise
capacity and our outcomes cannot be concluded despite our
supportive results. Geographic, selection, or survivorship biases
may be present from our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Exercise
capacity is determined partly by genetics, which may affect

 individual responses to exercise training.30 Furthermore, our
results are derived from an initial stress test that may not reflect
the patients’ true exercise capacity due to symptomatic com-
plaints; however, this approach is representative of what is seen
in clinical practice, and therefore is of clinical relevance.
Lastly, our results do not address whether exercise capacity
should
be
routinely
measured
for
risk
stratification.
Furthermore, additional calibration for biologic age estimates in
a primary care setting would be required to generalise our
results to a non-referral population. With all tests, the benefits,
costs, and risks must be weighed; however, full consideration
and discussion of these trade-offs are beyond the scope of this
study. Rather, we propose an accessible tool that has the poten-
tial to enhance a patient’s understanding of their exercise cap-
acity as measured during exercise testing, which is commonly
performed in routine clinical practice.
Key messages
What is already known on this subject?
Exercise capacity is a more central determinant of long-term
survival than many traditional cardiovascular risk factors. In
other fields of medicine, the concept of ‘biologic age’ derived
from other prognosticators has been shown to improve patient
compliance with important lifestyle changes; however, similar
derivations of biologic age from exercise capacity have not been
performed.
What might this study add?
We show that exercise capacity remains an important
consideration in patients of all ages. We further derive biologic
age from exercise capacity, and show that it is a stronger
predictor of long-term survival than chronologic age, even when
substituted in established risk stratification models such as the
Framingham Risk Score.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
With the derivation of biologic age, a patient’s level of exercise
capacity may now be intuitively communicated to a patient with
the goal of encouraging positive lifestyle changes, for example,
“You are 45 years old, but your current level of fitness puts you
at the same risk for death and heart attacks as the average
person who is 60 years old”.
