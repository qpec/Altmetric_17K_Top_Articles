 Introduction
Plant associated microbes may present risks of infectious illness 
 
for human end consumers. However, many plant-associated 
microbes may provide benefits for plant cultivation in terms of 
growth stimulation, insect or microbial resistance, or may simply 
 
be neutral passengers1–3. The microbiome of Cannabis leaves 
and flowers includes bacteria and fungi residing on the exterior 
 
surface of these tissues (epiphytes) as well as those residing 
within the plant tissues (endophytes). While epiphytic microbes 
may originate from many sources like aerosols, dusts and liquids, 
or via human contact, endophytes typically gain entry from the 
 
rhizosphere via root junctions, and subsequent translocation 
through the xylem4,5. Considering this and the known impact 
that the soil and root microbiome has on plant growth and 
development6,7, all sources of microbial inputs, including below 
ground compartments should be considered important for optimal 
Cannabis growth and consumer safety8.
Studies on the natural Cannabis microbiome have identified 
 
several species of culturable endophytic fungi, including Penicillium 
citrinum, Penicillium copticola (a member of the citrinum section9) 
and several Aspergillus species10,11. Similar studies looking at 
culturable bacterial endophytes identified nearly a dozen isolates 
from the Bacillus clade and two mycobacteria1. Of those Bacillus 
species, B. subtilis, B. lichenoformis and B. pumilis have been 
isolated as endophytes and have been shown to be beneficial 
to growth in other plant species12–14. Finally, a recent investiga-
tion of the fungal microbiome in a number of dispensary-derived 
Cannabis samples identified numerous species including some 
toxigenic Penicillia and Aspergilli15. While there have not been any 
reported cases of Cannabis-related mycotoxin poisoning resulting 
from Penicillium infections, there have been numerous reported 
cases of serious or fatal pulmonary Aspergillosis associated with 
marijuana smoking in immunocompromised patients16–18. A 
multistate outbreak of Salmonellosis has also been reported19,20. 
Denver’s Department of Environmental Health has also issued 
warnings related to Cannabis extracts and Clostridium botulinum21.
State Cannabis markets rely on a patchwork of testing regula-
tions to protect patients and consumers. In terms of microbial 
testing, these vary widely from state to state. States such as Maine, 
Michigan, and Arizona currently do not impose testing regula-
tions, while several states such as Connecticut, Massachusetts and 
New Mexico have adopted regulations based on the United States 
Pharmacopeia (USP) and American Herbal Pharmacopeia (AHP) 
recommended guidelines22. Specifically, the AHP recommends 
appropriate methods for testing microbial loads be adopted from 
the FDA Bacteriological Analytical Manual (http://www.fda.gov/
Food/FoodScienceResearch/LaboratoryMethods/ucm2006949.
htm). State regulators frequently use AHP guidelines to set limits 
of 105 CFU/g for Total Aerobic Bacteria (TAC), 104 CFU/g for 
Total Yeast and Mold (TYM), 103 CFU/g for Total Coliform and 
Enterobacteriaceae and < 1 CFU/g for pathogenic E. coli and 
Salmonella species. The AHP states, “It is important to note that 
microbial and fungal values do not typically represent pass or fail 
criteria and recommended limits may require adjustment over time.” 
New York and Hawaii specify some additional genera for test-
ing such as Aspergillus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, 
Mucor, and Penicillium. A few States require that testing labora-
tories follow the procedures outlined in the USP for microbio-
logical examination of non-sterile products. Others allow testing 
laboratories to choose from a wide variety of technologies designed 
for the food testing industry. However, there is no peer-reviewed 
research supporting the effectiveness and validity of any of these 
protocols for Cannabis microbial testing. Furthermore, no studies 
to date have examined the impact of beneficial endophytes on the 
Cannabis microbiome and on microbial testing results.
Here we present a next generation sequencing survey of DNA 
 
sampled directly from cured cannabis flowers before and after 
 
culturing using 3M Rapid Yeast and Mold PetrifilmTM, the 
Biomérieux Tempo® Total Yeast and Mold platform, and qPCR 
analysis using Medicinal Genomics ITS2-based TYM and 
16S-based TAC assays. Sequencing and analysis of the fungal 
 
ribosomal operon internal transcribed spacer23,24 (ITS2) and the 
bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene V3 and V4 hypervariable 
 
regions25 (16S) allowed us to identify bacterial and fungal genera 
and species present in each case. The results highlight some 
 
organisms of concern and demonstrate that major fungal and 
 
bacterial compositional changes occur during culture-based TYM 
testing. 
Methods
Samples, culture-based assays and DNA purification
Cannabis samples were derived from seven recently-established 
indoor growth facilities in Massachusetts, Maine and Rhode Island. 
Samples were prepared and placed into culture on 3M PetrifilmTM 
Rapid Yeast and Mold Count Plates (40–72 h) and Biomérieux 
TEMPO® YM cards (70–76 h) at 25 ± 1.0°C, according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. All samples but two were also ana-
lyzed using Biomérieux TEMPO® AC cards to enumerate aerobic 
bacterial counts. For qPCR, Cannabis samples (250 ± 30 mg) were 
placed in Whirl-Pak® bags and massaged in 3.55 ml Trypticase Soy 
Broth (TSB; American Bioanalytical) for 1 minute. DNA was then 
extracted using SenSATIVAx reagents (Medicinal Genomics part 
#420001), as described previously15 and eluted with 50 μL ddH20. 
DNA was similarly extracted after growth on the two culture based 
platforms as described above. Colonies grown on 3M plates were 
scraped off into 285 μL of ddH2O, and 190 μL of those samples, 
or samples grown in TEMPO cartridges (liquid culture), were 
extracted using SenSATIVAx as above. Fungal species stocks from 
the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were reconstituted 
and incubated at the appropriate temperature, as recommended 
by ATCC product documentation. Cultures of ATCC strains 
were then grown in 5ml TSB for 5 days at room temperature and 
checked visually for turbidity. Serial dilutions were plated on 3M 
PetrifilmTM Rapid Yeast and Mold Count Plates, incubated at room 
temperature, and counted after 3–5 days. Colonies were scraped 
off the plates and DNA was then extracted as described above.
The cannabis samples used for this study were collected within 
the regulatory framework for the individual State Medical 
 
Marijuana programs by ProVerde Laboratories; an accredited ISO/
IEC 17025:2005 cannabis safety testing laboratory. The purified 
DNA, which is not a schedule I substance, was tested to verify that 
the hydrophilic DNA purification does not contain hydrophobic

 cannabinoids and is therefore in accordance with the Hemp Asso-
ciates vs DEA regarding hemp fiber shipment within the United 
States. Since all activities that involved handling of material 
containing cannabinoids was within the individual state require-
ments, no federal (FDA or DEA) registration or permission was 
required.
Total yeast and mold and total aerobic bacteria qPCR 
assays
DNA samples extracted directly from Cannabis samples, or after 
growth on the two culture-based platforms, were subjected to 
qPCR analysis. Quantitative PCR was performed using a commer-
cially available TYM assay (TYM-PathogINDICAtor, Medicinal 
Genomics, Woburn MA), or TAC assay (TAC-PathogINDICAtor, 
 
Medicinal Genomics, Woburn, MA) in a Bio-Rad CFX 96 Touch 
qPCR instrument, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Primers used for PCR and sequencing
PCR was performed using 5μL of DNA (3ng/μL) 12.5μL 2X 
LongAmp (NEB) with 1.25 μL of each 10 μM MGC-ITS3F and 
MGC-ITS3R primer or MGC-TAC_F and MGC-TAC_R primer 
(MGC-ITS3F: 
TACACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGCATC-
GATGAAGAACGCAGC), (MGC-ITS3R: AGGATAACAATT-
TCACACAGGATTTGAGCTCTTGCCGCTTCA), (MGC-TAC_F: 
TACACGACGTTGTAAAACGATCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGT) 
and (MGC-TAC_R: AGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGGGAC-
TACCAGGGTATCTAATCCTGTT) with 10μL ddH20 for a 
 
25 μL total reaction. An initial 95°C 5-minute denaturation step 
was performed followed by 25 cycles of 95°C for 15s and 65°C for 
 
90s. Samples were purified with 75 μL SenSATIVAx, washed 
twice with 100 μL 70% EtOH and bench dried for 5 minutes at 
room temperature. Samples were eluted in 25 μL ddH20.
Library preparation using Nextera
The 16S amplicon targeted by the MGC primers (spanning the V3 
and V4 hypervariable regions) is approximately 460 bp in size, and 
ITS2 amplicons from different fungal species are known to vary 
in size from ~0.5–1 kilobases. To enable representative coverage 
across the entire amplicon for sequencing and analysis of each 
sample, we enzymatically fragmented the amplicons to ~300 bp 
average size. Fragmentation was accomplished and DNA librar-
ies were constructed using the commercially available Nextera 
Library Prep Kit (Illumina). 6ng of purified PCR product, 
 
5 μL of TD buffer, 0.1 μL of TD enzyme and 3.9 μL ddH20 was 
combined for a total of 10 μL. The reaction was incubated at 
55°C for 30 minutes followed by a 10°C hold. The reaction plate 
was immediately removed from the thermal cycler and puri-
fied with 15 μL of Agencourt Ampure XP (Beckman Coulter), 
washed twice with 200 μL 70% EtOH and bench dried for 
10 minutes at room temperature. Samples were eluted in 25μL 
10mM Tris-HCl.
Library PCR and Illumina sequencing
17.5 μL of 2X Q5 polymerase (NEB) was added to 10μL of puri-
fied DNA with 2.5 μL of i7 Nextera index primer, 2.5 μL L of i5 
Nextera index primer, 0.5 μL of ILMN1 primer (50 μM), 0.5 μL 
of ILMN2 primer (50 μM), 1 μL 5-methyl-dCTP (10 μM) and 
0.5 μL H2O. After an initial 72°C for 3 minutes and 98°C for 30 s, 
the library was amplified for 12 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 63°C 
for 30 s, 72°C for 1 minute and a 10°C hold. Use of methylated 
nucleotides for PCR decontamination is described previously26,27. 
PCR samples were purified by mixing 52.5 μL of Agencourt 
Ampure XP into the PCR reaction. The samples were placed on 
a magnet for 15 minutes until the beads cleared and the superna-
tant could be removed. Beads were washed twice with 200 μL of 
70% EtOH. Beads were left for 10 minute to air dry and then 
eluted in 25 μL of 10 mM Tris-HCl. 5 μL of each PCR product 
was pooled and quantified with a Qubit (Thermo) for proper dilu-
tion onto MiSeq version 2 chemistry according to the manufactur-
ers’ instructions. 2×150 bp reads were selected to obtain maximal 
ITS2 sequence information. 
Analysis
2×150 bp reads were de-multiplexed with Illumina software 
bcl2fastq v2.17.1.14. Sequences were classified at the Family, 
Genus and Species level by discriminative k-mer analysis using 
CLARK-S28 with the NCBI/RefSeq bacterial database and tax-
onomy, or UNITE29 fungal database and taxonomy. Cannabis 
chloroplast and mitochondrial sequences were included in the 
bacterial and fungal databases since they amplify with the 16S 
rRNA primers used, and the Nextera fragmentation process used 
in our lib prep may incorporate high copy number sequences 
even without amplification. Cannabis mitochondrial sequences 
generally comprised a large fraction of the classified reads (up to 
97%) in DNA derived from plant material. The Cannabis reads 
were subtracted out to enable enumeration of the bacterial species 
down to 1% of classified non-Cannabis reads.
Sequences were alternatively classified by BLAST analysis of 
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) generated by clustering at the 
≥ 97% sequence similarity level using USEARCH830. Each set of 
paired-end reads were merged using fastq_merge pairs31. We used 
cutadapt to trim primer and adaptor regions from both ends (http://
cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html). 
Sequences 
were 
quality trimmed to have a maximum expected number of errors per 
100 bases of less than 0.1 (Q30). OTUs with membership of at least 
200 sequences were included in downstream analyses, and BLAST 
hits with less than 97% query coverage and 97% identity were 
discarded. Analyses of the USEARCH OTUs were performed in 
R (https://www.r-project.org). Each library was normalized by the 
total number of OTUs found. OTUs were associated with microbes 
based on the name and description provided by NCBI. R2 values 
were calculated by adjusted linear regression in R or by embedded 
formulas in Excel. In order to mitigate the large effect of noise in 
samples with low OTU counts, specificity analysis was done after 
pooling the un-normalized data.

Summary results from the different testing platforms evaluated 
in this study for 15 samples with complete data are presented in 
Table 1. The samples were evaluated with Medicinal Genomics’ 
PathogINDICAtor ITS2-based TYM-qPCR and 16S-based TAC-
qPCR assays directly from extracted plant material (Before), and 
from recovered medium after culture on the Biomérieux Tempo 
instrument using YM sample cards (After BMX). Samples were

 Tempo YM and AC cards, or on 3M Rapid Total Yeast and Mold 
Count Plates (3M TYM). Results in bold type and shaded boxes 
indicate failed tests following the limits set for Massachusetts 
medicinal Cannabis.
Overall, the BMX TYM platform failed the highest number at 67% 
(10/15); the 3M TYM platform failed 60% (9/15), and the qPCR 
TYM failed 20% (3/15). The failure rates for the BMX AC and 
qPCR TAC assays were 13% (2/15) and 7% (1/15), respectively. 
An additional set of TYM qPCR tests were performed after growth 
on the BMX platform, resulting in 12/15 failures and confirming 
the presence of live, culturable fungi in 80% of the samples. The 
3M TYM and BMX YM systems performed similarly in terms 
of pass/fail, with only one discrepancy, which had a value close 
to the failure threshold. The TYM-qPCR assay passed seven 
 
samples that failed on at least one of the two culture-based 
 
platforms. One of those (sample 4) had an elevated quantitation 
 
cycle (Cq) value approaching the failure threshold; the rest 
 
(samples 11–16) gave high Cq values, indicating very low fungal 
DNA levels (Table 1).
Metagenomic sequencing and analysis results
The sequencing data generated for this project are available at the 
NCBI short read archive; see Dataset 1 (Table I) for accession 
numbers and URLs. A summary of the CLARK-S classification 
results for each of the 15 samples, directly from plant material 
(before), or after culture on the 3M or BMX platforms, is provided 
in Dataset 1 (Table II: CLARK-S output for bacterial species

 sequencing procedure utilizes two PCR steps instead of the single 
PCR step used in qPCR (and does not utilize an internal probe for 
signal generation). Sample quantities are normalized prior to the 
Nextera reaction to ensure consistent shearing. These procedures 
are optimized to yield 1 million reads or more per sample for high 
sensitivity, but the read numbers are not proportional to microbial 
counts in the starting samples. Instead, the classified read counts 
and percentages simply indicate the genera or species present at 
detectable levels and their approximate proportions (with the caveat 
that the target amplicons from some species may amplify with 
lower efficiency owing to primer mismatches or extremes of G+C 
content). The qPCR Cq measured directly from extracted plant 
material provides the best inter-sample comparative metric. BLAST 
results from clustered OTUs were used to confirm prevalent spe-
cies assignments on a case-by-case basis, but the results are not 
presented here owing to the very large number of OTUs generated 
by the USEARCH software (>12,000 across the full sample set).
Sequencing reproducibility: 14 frozen samples were amplified 
 
with ITS2 primers and sequenced 30–60 days apart; 13 of the com-
parative R square values for classified fungal species were greater 
than 0.999 and the remaining one was 0.966. Similarly, 20 frozen 
samples were amplified with 16S primers and sequenced 30–60 days 
apart; 18 of the comparative R square values for classified bacterial 
species were greater than 0.999 and the remaining two averaged 
was 0.998. These data imply highly reproducible genomic sur-
veys of the amplified DNA present. No Template Controls (NTC) 
were also tested, producing very high Cq readings (>35) and very 
few classified reads (251 with TAC primers and 61 with TYM 
primers) controlling for the possibility of labware contamination 
 
contributing to the observed signals.
Specificity: To verify the specificity of the analysis for accurate 
discrimination between bacterial and fungal genera, we ran 
CLARK-S against the bacterial and fungal databases separately 
at the genus level using either 16S or ITS2 reads. There were 
13,913,520 16S reads classified as bacterial, 2,293 16S reads clas-
sified as fungal, 6,220,745 ITS2 reads classified as fungal, and 
241,351 ITS2 reads classified as bacterial (Dataset 1, Tables V 
and IX–XI; Table IX: genus level CLARK-S read counts for 16S 
reads against the fungal database, Table X: genus level CLARK-S 
 
read counts for ITS2 reads against the bacterial database, Table XI: 
 
genus level CLARK-S read counts for 16S reads against the 
bacterial database). From this we calculate the specificity (true 
neg/(false pos + true neg) of 16S analysis as 0.963 [=ITS2 reads 
classified as fungal/(ITS2 reads classified as fungal+ITS2 reads 
classified as bacterial)] and that of the ITS2 analysis as 0.9997 
[=16S reads classified as bacterial/(16S reads classified as 
bacterial+16S reads classified as fungal)].
Pairs of samples from three of the seven growers were highly sim-
ilar in their combined bacterial and fungal species prevalence as 
indicated by high correlation coefficients (CC): CC=0.92 for 
samples 1 and 2, CC=0.94 for samples 11 and 12, and CC=0.97 for 
samples 6 and 14. There was also moderate correlation between 
samples 6, 14 and 9, a third sample from the same grower: CC=0.66 
for samples 6 and 9, CC=0.64 for samples 9 and 14. These 
samples represent different strains from the same grow and likely 
share similar soil environments. 
Bacterial growth on culture-based TYM platforms
Six samples (numbers 11–16) failed in the BMX TYM test, but 
passed the MGC qPCR TYM test with low signals (Cq >40). Five 
of those (numbers 11, 12, 14–16) had elevated qPCR TAC signals, 
suggesting that the growth of bacteria could be contributing to 
colony counts and failures in the culture-based TYM tests. 
Sequencing results for each of those samples, before and after 
culture in BMX medium, confirm the presence of actively grow-
ing bacteria, and reveals the bacterial genera that are primarily 
responsible for the TAC-qPCR signals: Bacillus and Clostridium 
in sample 11 (~73% of classified reads, collectively), and Bacillus, 
Clostridium and Ralstonia in samples 14–16 (78–83% of classi-
fied reads, collectively in the each of the three samples). A different 
set of genera were observed after culture on 3M media: Ralstonia 
and Leifsonia in sample 11 (86% of classified reads, collectively), 
and Xanthomonas, Ralstonia and Streptococcus in samples 14–16 
(61–75%, collectively in each sample).
All of the samples underwent a change in species composition after 
growth on the BMX or 3M yeast and mold platforms. Three of the 
15 samples (numbers 5, 15 and 16) produced a similar distribu-
tion of species on the BMX and 3M platforms, with correlation 
coefficients (CC) of 0.41–0.82. The results from the remaining 
80% of the samples, however, were strikingly different on the two 
platforms (CC: -0.03-0.21). Representative results from two of 
those samples, numbers 2 and 14, are shown in Figure 1.
Significant levels of Bacillus coagulans and Clostridium botuli-
num (a toxigenic pathogen) were observed together in two thirds of 
the samples (numbers 6–9 and 11–16) after incubation in the 
hermetically sealed cards of the BMX TYM platform. These 
organisms were detected before growth at very low levels (0.5% 
or less), indicating the presence of viable cells or spores in the 
samples. They were not detected at significant levels after growth 
on the 3M platform.
Other potentially pathogenic bacterial species that were detected at 
proportions of >1% of classified bacterial reads on plant material 
before growth include: Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter 
pitti, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Coxiella burnetii, Escherichia 
coli, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Ralsto-
nia pickettii, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Steno-
trophomonas maltophilia, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Some of 
these species, and others, were observed to grow differentially on 
the BMX and 3M platforms. Species that grew well on 3M but not 
BMX included S. maltophilia and Leifsonia xyli; those that grew 
well on BMX but not 3M included C. botulinum, B. coagulans, 
Pseudomonas fluorescens and C. tetani. Factors that may contribute 
to this are the presence of chloramphenicol (Cm) and possible low 
oxygen levels in the BMX platform. S. maltophilia is Cm sensitive 
and P. fluorescens is Cm resistant. C. botulinum and C. tetani are 
obligate anaerobes and B. coagulans is a facultative anaerobe.

and 14, before and after culturing on 3M and BMX media. The results represent all species observed down to 1% of classified reads. Large 
shifts in species prevalence are seen after growth on the two culture-based platforms.
Differential growth of toxigenic and beneficial fungi
The concordance between the two culture based platforms was 
much higher overall for fungi than for bacteria. The distribution of 
fungal species observed after growth on the BMX and 3M platforms 
was highly similar for nine of the 15 samples (cc 0.98-1.0), and low 
to moderate for another three samples (cc: -0.02-0.49). The remain-
ing three samples did not include any fungi that could be classified 
at the species level. The following toxigenic fungi were detected 
levels at >1% of classified reads in at least one sample: Aspergillus 
fumigatus, Aspergillus ostianus, Aspergillus sydowii, Penicillium 
citrinum, Penicillium commune, and Penicillium steckii. 
We expected that all fungal species would grow effectively on the 
3M and BMX TYM platforms, but there were some notable excep-
tions. First, we observed that although Aspergillus species were 
present in 15 plant samples (average proportion: 25% of classified 
reads), they were only detected at low levels in three samples after 
culturing on either 3M or BMX media (average proportion: 1.1% or 
0.4% of classified reads, respectively). Representative results from 
two such samples are shown in Figure 2. Second, Penicillium was 
the most prevalent genus observed before and after growth on both 
platforms, with the most prevalent species classifications being 
P. citrinum and P. olsonii. However, although Penicillium species 
Page 7 of 20
F1000Research 2016, 5:2471 Last updated: 17 MAY 2019
 were present at significant levels in sample 16 (76% of classified 
reads; Figure 2C), they did not grow well on either platform in 
this sample (2.7–5.6% of classified reads). Instead, substan-
tial growth of Trichoderma species, primarily T. hamatum, was 
observed (80–90% of classified reads). T. hamatum is one of several 
Trichoderma species that have been shown to inhibit the growth 
of Penicillium and other toxigenic fungi33,34. Apparent competi-
tive growth inhibition of Penicillium species was also observed in 
sample 4 where there was substantial growth of Fusarium species 
(23–72% of classified reads; Figure 2A), and in samples 1, 2 and 
7 where there was substantial growth of Saccharomyces species 
(57–82% of classified reads).
While the qPCR and sequencing assays are capable of detecting 
free DNA, all of the samples tested in this study appear to contain 
live spores or microbes. Even in the one sample (number 6) where 
the TYM-qPCR Cq did not decrease after growth in BMX media, 
the proportions of fungal species changed and TAC qPCR demon-
strated growing bacteria with a 10 Cq decrease (from over 40 to 
30.4) after culture.
Comparative growth of Aspergillus species and other fungi 
on 3M media
To further evaluate the ability of Aspergillus species to grow on 3M 
Rapid TYM Petri-Films, we plated 10 fungal monocultures from 
ATCC stocks and measured the concordance between qPCR Cq 
and 3M CFU (Figure 3). The Aspergillus species CFU counts are 
approximately three orders of magnitude lower than expected based 
on Cq estimates that were developed and optimized by plating 
cultured cells of other species. Excluding the two Aspergillus 
species, the correlation between CFU/g and Cq is 0.71. The one 
other outlier in these data is Candida glabralta. The correlation 
between CFU per gram of plant material and Cq is 0.99 across the 
remaining eight different fungal species.

 Discussion
The samples selected for this study were derived from seven newly 
established indoor Cannabis growth facilities located in a humid 
coastal environment (Eastern Massachusetts, Maine and Rhode 
Island). They were enriched for samples that failed on either or 
both the 3M and BMX platforms, which are commonly used to test 
for bacteria, yeast and mold in the industry. Quantitative PCR was 
evaluated as a third approach to hopefully resolve discrepancies. 
The high failure rate observed in this study should not be taken 
as representative of industry-wide averages, which have been 
reported elsewhere15,35. The sample set provided an opportunity to 
investigate the diversity of species that grow in different culture-
based platforms as well as to characterize the microorganisms 
that were responsible for the sample failures.
Metagenomic sequencing data were collected on 15 samples, 
directly from plant material and after culture on both the 3M and 
BMX platforms. The sequencing results demonstrate substantial 
shifts in presence and abundance of bacterial and fungal species 
after growth on the two platforms. Thus both of the culture-based 
platforms are detecting and enumerating only a subset of the spe-
cies present, and the final composition of microbes after growth is 
markedly different from the starting sample. Most concerning is 
the frequent identification of bacterial species in systems designed 
for the exclusive quantification of yeast and mold, as quantified by 
elevated TAC Cq values after culture in the BMX TYM medium. 
These observations call into question the specificity claims of these 
culture-based testing platforms. The presence of bacterial colonies 
on TYM growth plates or cards may falsely increase the rejection 
rate of Cannabis samples for fungal contamination, and induce 
growers to increase the use of fungicides unnecessarily.
Classified reads corresponding to many pathogenic and/or toxi-
genic bacteria and fungi were detected on plant material, including 
the following at proportions of over 5%: Acinetobacter baumannii, 
Acinetobacter pittii, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Ralstonia pickettii, Salmonella enterica, 
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Penicillium citrinum, Aspergillus 
ostianus, Penicillium steckii and Aspergillus sydowii. While the 
 
proportions of classified reads corresponding to these organ-
isms were generally low, there were several striking exceptions: 
 
>10–35% R. picketti in 9/15 samples, 97% S. maltophilia in one 
sample, 41% E. coli in one sample, 16–35% A. baumanii in two 
samples, 10–85% P. olsonii in five samples, 10–72% P. citrinum 
in 13 samples, and 21% A. ostianus in one sample. The CLARK-S 
 
classification software has been reported to have very high sensi-
tivity and precision for sequence assignments28,36,37. Nevertheless, 
further work is required to confirm these species assignments and 
to check for the presence of toxins that may be produced by these 
microbes. The observations certainly call into question the wisdom 
of species-agnostic microbial quantitation for a product like 
 
medicinal Cannabis, which is used by many seriously ill or immu-
nocompromised patients.
Cross-platform comparisons demonstrate that certain bacteria 
 
and fungi grow well on 3M plates, but not on BMX, or vice 
versa. There are certainly differences in terms of the media. For 
 
example, BMX medium includes chloramphenicol to suppress 
bacterial growth, and uses sealed growth chambers that may limit 
 
oxygen availability. The observation of anaerobic Clostridium 
species such as C. botulinum in proportions up to 35% of bacte-
rial reads at the genus level on the BMX platform along with 
 
B. coagulans, a facultative anaerobe, suggests that the sealed BMX

flavus: ATCC 16870. Aspergillus demonstrates log scales lower growth at RT than most other yeast. “Expected” is the inferred CFU count from 
the Cq measurement using the formula CFU/g = 10[(42.185 – Cq Value)/3.6916].

 YM cards generate anaerobic conditions. B. coagulans is rhizo-
bacterium that has been reported to promote growth in Solanum 
seedlings in concert with mycorrhizal fungi38.
Clostridium botulinum was only detected at very low levels before 
growth on BMX medium, and was not detected on 3M plates. Pre-
vious white papers have suggested C. botulinum is not a threat in 
Cannabis due to its anaerobic nature (http://cannabissafetyinstitute.
org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Microbiological-Safety-Testing-
of-Cannabis.pdf). However, C. botulinum should not be considered 
an irrelevant threat in Cannabis because it is known to vascular-
ize as an endophyte in plants and produce pasteurization resist-
ant spores39. Additionally, proximity between cultivation and 
processing may lead to contamination of finished products such as 
emulsified oils or concentrated extracts containing water. Media 
such as these provide anaerobic conditions and nutrients suffi-
cient for C. botulinum and other anaerobes to thrive. This is most 
threatening to indoor cultivation facilities which also process, store, 
and package finished products on site, often in sub-optimal storage 
conditions. The fact that the organism was observed to proliferate 
in the BMX system suggests that its presence, even at low levels, 
could be a potential concern in emulsified Cannabis oil formula-
tions or edible products that are stored in closed containers.
Of greater potential concern than the bacterial growth is the failure 
of both culture-based TYM platforms to support efficient growth 
and detection of Aspergillus species, which were present in pro-
portions of 18–58% of classified ITS2 reads at the genus level in 
10/15 samples. Initially, it was suspected that the significant TYM 
qPCR and read counts might derive from dead cells, perhaps as 
a result of growers attempting to sterilize the plant material. 
Quantitative PCR data using active cultures grown in TSB, 
 
however, indicates that CFU counts from two Aspergillus species 
inoculated onto 3M TYM petri film were ~1000× lower than 
expected based on qPCR Cq values that accurately predict CFUs 
in other species (Figure 3). Elevated Cq values due to ribosomal 
DNA copy number amplification does not seem a likely explana-
tion because the estimated copy numbers of several Aspergillus 
species are similar to those of other fungi40,41. While the presence 
of spores with a slow germination rate42 could explain the results 
on plant material, it does not explain the qPCR result using active 
cultures. Another factor could be the obligate hyphal growth nature 
of Aspergillus species43, wherein each colony forming unit may 
contain hundreds of interconnected hyphal cells.
These findings are surprising, and therefore a third culture-based 
system, manufactured by Biolumix, was tested for its ability to 
detect A. fumigatus after 48 hours of growth at 26°C following 
inoculation from a saturated TSB culture. The result was nega-
tive. The failure of three different culture-based platforms to detect 
Aspergillus species suggests the need for caution in the use of such 
platforms. Validation data for the detection of Aspergillus on 3M 
rapid TYM Petri-film presented in 3M’s marketing material44 is 
for culture at 25°C, whereas the instructions for use specify 
culture at room temperature (~4°C below 25°C). McClenny45 
recommends longer times and higher temperatures to accurately 
detect Aspergilli with culture based methods. The 3M films used 
in this study were incubated at 25 ± 1.0°C for 72 hours and still 
showed low efficacy detecting Aspergilli.
Aspergillus is arguably the most significant fungal threat in 
Cannabis cultivation. Aspergillosis has been reported in numer-
ous immunocompromised patients and, to date accounts for the 
only clinical reports of fatalities associated with an infectious 
organism linked to Cannabis consumption16–18,46–48. Vonberg et al. 
demonstrated a 57% fatality rate for Aspergillosis in hospital- 
bound immunocompromised patients, while also demonstrating 
airborne infectability at or below 1 CFU/cubic meter49. Growers 
 
may pasteurize Cannabis samples to avoid failing culture-based 
microbial testing, but Aspergillus spores are pasteurization 
 
resistant50, as are the toxins they produce51, so pasteurization does 
not eliminate the potential risk from these organisms.
Another interesting observation is the apparent growth inhibition 
of Penicillium species (P. citrinum, P. brevicompactum, P. olsonii 
and P. quercetorum) in several samples with high proportions of 
Trichoderma, Fusarium, Rhodotorula or Saccharomyces reads after 
culture (samples 1,2,4,7 and 16). Other classified species that failed 
to grow in some of those samples include Furcaspora eucalypti and 
Tilletiopsis pallescens. Organic growth practices often utilize ben-
eficial bacterial or fungal endophytes52 to promote crop growth and 
to enable lower chemical fungicide use. For example, Trichoderma 
species are known to synthesize β-1,3 gluconases and a chitinase 
which work synergistically to break down the cell walls of other 
fungi53,54. The State of Nevada has issued guidelines for allow-
able pesticides for use in Cannabis cultivation that include various 
Trichoderma and Bacillus species55. However, in most states, 
the use of such beneficial microbes may be precluded by the 
 
requirement for stringent yeast and mold testing that does not 
 
discriminate between beneficial and harmful microorganisms. 
 
More specific nucleic acid based testing techniques can resolve 
 
this. The FDA is moving in this direction for food safety testing 
with the GenomeTrakr Network56.
Finally, as observed in a previous study on the Cannabis fungal 
microbiome in a different sample set15, P. citrinum is highly preva-
lent in the samples tested here. This species has been isolated as a 
growth promoting endophyte in Cannabis and several other plant 
species10,11,57–59. P. citrinum produces the nephrotoxin citrinin, 
although it is not clear whether the presence of citrinin in Cannabis 
flowers or extracts represents an actual health threat. However, the 
high prevalence of P. citrinum in Cannabis samples suggests that it 
is an area worthy of further investigation. 
These data have several limitations. Quantitative inter-sample com-
parisons cannot be performed with the sequencing data at present 
due to the lack of internal controls to help calibrate any pooling 
or sampling issues throughout the workflow. The qPCR data can 
be used to estimate inter-sample bacterial or fungal burden but 
these data do not always resolve to the genus or species level. Intra- 
sample comparisons can nonetheless provide information on 
the relative proportions of bacterial or fungal species. Sam-
pling from BMX cards was straightforward, since it uses a liquid 
culture medium, but 3M sampling was subject to bias in scraping 
off colonies from culture plates. Additionally, the use of Nextera 
shearing and primer amplification may introduce some biases due 
to transposon integration preferences. The fragmentation approach 
is necessary to avoid ITS2 amplicon size bias in Illumina MiSeq 
clustering60,61.

 Conclusions
Culture based techniques used to measure the microbial burden 
 
and establish safety of Cannabis have several shortcomings. States 
adopt and implement regulations at different tolerance thresholds 
for bacteria and fungi without specifically detailing standard-
ized methods or coordinating inter-laboratory ring testing. Yeast 
and mold counts from the culture-based platforms tested here are 
confounded by the growth of bacteria - even when antibiotics like 
chloramphenicol are included. The microbiome in the plant mate-
rial tested changes radically after culturing, such that the microbes 
and counts that are finally observed bear little or no resemblance 
to those of the starting sample. This represents a classic observer 
effect, where the act of measuring the microbial composition 
using these culture-based methods fundamentally changes that 
 
composition - which is a well-studied phenomenon known as 
the “great plate-count anomaly”62. This is a serious issue, which 
 
clearly has implications beyond Cannabis safety testing. The 3M 
and BMX platforms tested here are also used widely in the food 
testing industry.
Perhaps the most concerning observation is that one of the most 
regulated of fungal pathogens, Aspergillus - the only microbe to 
ever be associated with clinical harm concerning cannabis - grows 
poorly, and is therefore severely under-reported by current culture-
based platforms. The differential growth of other toxigenic fungi, 
depending on the companion species present, further influences 
the results. Bacterial pathogens are not uncommon, and beneficial 
bacteria are also capable of influencing the growth or inhibition of 
other flora.
We have demonstrated that molecular testing is capable of 
accurately quantifying and identifying a wide spectrum of 
microorganisms present on Cannabis samples, while avoiding 
false positives due to the presence of bacteria for fungal testing. 
Molecular testing is rapid and is capable of distinguishing between 
harmful and beneficial microbes – permitting the use of the latter 
in organic cultivation practices to eliminate the need for reliance 
on chemical fungicides.

This article represents an area of research that needs more attention. My only concerns are minor, and
are regarding the figures in the article. The figures do not have any error bars/indication of replicability. It
would be great if there were more reproducibility indicated within the figures, as this article will be highly
read and potentially utilized in a growing industry.

1.  
We would like to extend our sincere gratitude for the opportunity to provide an open peer review for the
work of McKernan and colleagues on the Cannabis microbiome and uses of metagenomics to shed light
on the microbial complement of the Cannabis phyllosphere. As strong proponents of open science, we
engage to provide an objective assessment of the work presented here and to make suggestions aimed
at improving the clarity and readability of the present work.
The microbiome (the collection of microbial genomes present on an organism or in an environment) has
emerged as an additional dimension (in addition to genomic, epigenomic, metabolomic and phenotypic
data…) from which one can harness cryptic information that may contribute to a particular biological
phenomenon. Novel technical advances have enabled a metagenomic approach in which one can isolate
and enumerate bacterial and fungal genus/species from environmental samples. In their paper, McKernan
compare the performance of traditional culture based techniques with commercial qPCR kits in
et al. 
terms of accuracy and ability to detect different types of microbes, with an emphasis on prokaryotic
organisms, which was so far underrepresented in previous published work (including a recent F1000
research paper by the same lead author).
We support the authors’ work and understand that as pioneers in the Cannabis microbiome space, they
are currently laying the foundation on which further development of assays will likely rely strongly. As
such, much of our comments relate to improving the transparency of their results. We pose several
questions/comments, which the author may choose to incorporate into updated versions of this paper.
Overall, the paper is very well written and we do not have any editorial suggestions, except for the spelling
of Biomerieux, which in one instance requires the accent aigu: “é”. Below, please find minor comments,
which we would like to authors to consider:
We are in agreement with review 1 (Ethan Russo) that the abstract could be improved if word limit
permits. We particularly think that the concluding statement could incorporate a stronger statement
about the application of their approach in the Cannabis industry.
 
A short statement on why the comparison between culture-based platforms and DNA-based
detection is relevant (e.g. in “Background”) would be of general interest to the readership.
 
Introduction
We found the introduction to lack a common thread and rather abruptly “jumps” between the
primary objectives of the paper: methodological comparison between different microorganism
detection techniques, microbe-microbe interactions and health implications: e.g. in paragraph 1 the
authors focus on microbiome-ecological considerations. Then again in paragraph 3, they bring up
plant-microbe/microbe-microbe interaction although the rest of this paragraph is focus on
methodologies.
 
The statement 
 does not make much
”…no studies have examined the impact of beneficials…”
sense there. Perhaps the considerations about 
 could be saved for the discussion.
Trichoderma
 
Some brief background on the two culture platforms (3M, BMX) would help frame the need for
other novel technologies in microbial detection.  
 
Methods
As a general comment to all sections from hereon, it would be helpful to have the same
sub-headings (as much as possible) logically flow from methods to results and into the discussion
points:
e.g.  
DNA-extraction from plants

DNA-extraction from plants
Platform culturing
qPCR
Metagenomic / sequencing
 
(Currently, the last paragraph of the Introduction gives an overview of the methods, the first technique that
is mentioned is NGS, then qPCR; in the Methods and Results it is first qPCR and then NGS…)
 
The above-mentioned will help disentangle some of the concepts introduced here, and send a clearer
message to the readership: why and when to use qPCR/metagenomics instead of conventional
approaches.
If there is sufficient evidence that the novel approach outperforms the old is another question that seems
rather elusive in the current paper.
It would be valuable to share some information about their standard curve and how they derived
their Cq values of 21 and 26 cycles for TYM and TAC assays respectively. This brings up the point
that a more convincing comparison of culture based and qPCR assays need to be provided in
order for the readership to assess if/when one should be used over another.
 
It would be useful to share the name of the R package used to undertake the USEARCH OTUs
analyses.
 
The authors should consider perhaps using other multivariate statistics than bivariate correlation
coefficients. Another angle to tackle this is to implement diversity analyses on the microbial
community data using either Shannon’s diversity index or some other metric such as alpha- and
beta- diversity in each sample. While sample size is likely limiting, are there other similarities
between samples for common origins? Or grown in similar conditions?
 
Please expand on what you mean by “specificity analysis” and how this was undertaken.
 
Results
The title of the first section is misleading: “qPCR and colony counts before and after”; i.e. there is
no colony count before (refer to above comment about unifying sub-heading in paper sections).
 
Table 1 could be presented in a clearer way: Table description and content (the column headers)
are redundant; too much text in the table description; instead of sample nr., give some info in the
sample identification (e.g. origin); visually separate TYM and TAC.
 
The presentation of the results (using excel bar plots), while understandable, is not that efficient at
presenting the data at hand. Without overstepping, we suggest looking at multivariate plots that
would be more suited to drive their points home.
 
Discussion
It seems counterintuitive that qPCR, being more sensitive than plating approach, would fail the
lowest number of samples out of all approaches: Is the BMX positive bias toward 
 a
C. botulinum
false positive or is the lack of 
 detection by qPCR a false negative?
C. botulinum
 
In that vein, it would be helpful to describe your strategy to assess false positives, i.e. how many
negative controls were implemented? Any negative control with botulism?
 
Failure thresholds are subjective in nature, please expand on how the Cq threshold is superior,

F1000Research 2016, 5:2471 Last updated: 17 MAY 2019
  
Failure thresholds are subjective in nature, please expand on how the Cq threshold is superior,
what microbial load (e.g. ng of DNA) do each of the two Cq thresholds correspond to?
 
We found that while a large and varied bacterial assemblage was identified here, it would be
important to note that modern Cannabis such as the 15 samples presented here have likely gone
through several genetic and microbiotic bottlenecks. A recent paper on the Agave microbiome
 demonstrates the paucity of the microbiome in domesticated/farmed plants compared to wild
relatives, likely due to the pervasive effects of monoculture. While the Cannabis domestication
process is convoluted and masked by prohibition, it is likely that the same pattern is observed in
Cannabis. Characterizing the genetic profiles of Cannabis, along with the microbiome of wild
Cannabis accessions will likely yield enhanced inference in terms of the underlying mechanisms
related to plant growth and disease tolerance.
 
A larger part of the discussion should be dedicated to the community composition shift before and
after culturing. Especially some considerations about the biological relevance of this shift: i.e. are
the pathogens that grow on the plate relevant for human health/plant growth considerations? Or
the other way round: are the pathogens detected before culturing relevant for human health/plant
growth issues? It would be good to more explicitly separate what the authors think are artifacts
caused by different methodologies (community shifts) with biologically relevant phenomena.
 
If the authors found polymorphisms in OTUs, they may want to suggest the application of the
Cannabis microbiome to provide higher resolution to clustering exercises in highly related or
poly-hybridized Cannabis accessions. This may also be used to trace the origin of particular
dispensary samples to a cultivator or methodology of plant growth as using hydroponics, soil,
aquaponics, etc. will likely influence the Cannabis rhizospheres and phyllospheres. 
 
While the authors discuss the presence of 
 and 
 spp. in emulsified oils,
C. botulinum
Aspergillum
perhaps addressing the use of extraction technologies such as butane, propane, Nitrogen, CO ,
Rosin tech and its putative impact on the presence of unwanted microorganisms may be a topic of
general interest. In Canada until recently, only Cannabis flowers were prescribed as medicinal
Cannabis. This study highlights some drawbacks of using this type of Cannabis for medical
purposes, particularly when used in immune-compromised individuals, and indirectly supports the
use of Cannabis extracts that can be dosed effectively with minimal risks of exposure to
toxicogenic microbes.
 
 
We sincerely hope that the authors will find our review useful and we remain available for further
discussion through the F1000 research platform.
 
Kind regards,
Philippe Henry and Lukas Wille

The purpose of this study was to investigate the composition of microorganisms found on cannabis
samples and compare the ability of different culture based testing platforms with a qPCR method.
Although the study provides some valuable data into some of the short comings of culture based methods
it has some experimental design weaknesses that make it difficult to draw strong conclusions from this
data set. 
Introduction:
Since the purpose of the study is to discuss the difference between a qPCR based microbial testing
platform with culture based methods the introduction should focus more on discussing this in other
industries. For example it's becoming well known that only a small percentage of organisms that exist in
nature are easily cultured on the most common forms of media used. Rapid advances in sequencing are
allowing metagenomic analysis of soil and plant microbiomes which also demonstrates the limitations of
culturing methods. Issues like specificity between qPCR and culture based methods should be
highlighted. 
Methods: 
Plant material - Nowhere in the methods section is any information provided about the cannabis plant
material. Was it cannabis flowers? Were they dried? Was the sample homogenized in anyway? 
Information about all the samples used in this study should be summarized in a table or in a section within
the methods part of the manuscript. 
Results: 
Table 1- This table highlights one of the main criticisms I have with this study. There are no
replicates. These results seem to be based off a single analysis of each sample. Therefore we
can't conclude anything about the reproducibility of the qPCR platform compared to the other
platforms.
 
It is also interesting to note that most of the culture based methods detected levels of fungi that
would be considered failures while most of the qPCR samples detected only low levels of fungal
DNA. 
 
It is difficult to follow from reading through the text of the manuscript which samples were analyzed
by metagenomic sequencing. Every sample analyzed by metagenomic sequencing and a
summary of their results, in terms of what species were detected and their approximate amounts,
should be summarized somewhere in the manuscript for ease of reference and completeness of

summary of their results, in terms of what species were detected and their approximate amounts,
should be summarized somewhere in the manuscript for ease of reference and completeness of
data presentation. Why those samples were chosen should be discussed. 
 
Throughout the results section numbers of samples are discussed but we don't know if those are
the same samples or which samples shown in Table 1.
For example page 7 paragraph 2:
"First, we observed that although 
 species were present in 15 plant samples (average
Aspergillus
proportion: 25% of classified reads), they were only detected at low levels in three samples after
culturing on either 3M or BMX media (average proportion: 1.1% or 0.4% of classified reads,
respectively).".
Which 15 plant samples? This kind of vague reference to samples needs to be corrected and be
made more clear. 
Page 6, sequence reproducibility:
"14 samples".
Which samples? 
Page 6, paragraph 4:
"Pairs of samples from three of the seven growers....".
Which detected fungi were commonly found and correlated? 
Page 7, Figure 1:
Why just discuss 2 and 14? Why not 7-13 or 15-16? 
To summarize I would like to see more error bars (or +-) from replicates and more complete summaries of
data and samples information. 
 No competing interests were disclosed.

I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that
it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined
above.

This is a very interesting, well written and designed account comparing the accuracy and utility of genetic
microbial testing as compared to standard microbiological culture techniques. All aspects of study design,
methods and conclusions are well explained and defended, and should easily allow replication if

methods and conclusions are well explained and defended, and should easily allow replication if
comparable techniques are applied.
I would suggest expansion of the study's implications in the abstract if the word count will permit this.
In 2005, Vancouver Coastal Health in British Columbia reported transmission of meningococcal cases by
sharing of joints, and perhaps this pathogen deserves scrutiny given its ubiquity in young adults very likely
to be engaging in social cannabis usage.
The legal analysis permitting cross-border transmission of DNA from cannabis material has important
implications for greater adoption of similar analytical techniques, which certainly seems warranted given
the advantages in accuracy in distinguishing beneficial, commensal and symbiotic microbiota from
pathogens, and the speed of this approach to the issue.
