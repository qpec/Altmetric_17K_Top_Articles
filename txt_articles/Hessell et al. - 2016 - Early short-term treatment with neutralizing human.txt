Abstract
Prevention of mother to child transmission (MTCT) of HIV remains a major objective where 
antenatal care is not readily accessible. We tested anti-HIV-1 human neutralizing monoclonal 
antibodies (NmAb) as post-exposure therapy in an infant macaque model for intrapartum MTCT. 
One-month-old rhesus macaques were inoculated orally with SHIVSF162P3. On days 1, 4, 7, and 
10 after virus exposure, we injected animals subcutaneously with NmAbs and quantified systemic 
distribution of NmAbs in multiple tissues within 24 h following administration. Replicating virus 
was found in multiple tissues by day 1 in animals without treatment. All NmAb-treated macaques 
were free of virus in blood and tissues at 6 months post-exposure. We detected no anti-SHIV T 
cell responses in blood or tissues at necropsy, and no virus emerged following CD8+ T cell 
depletion. These results suggest early passive immunotherapy can eliminate early viral foci and 
thereby prevent the establishment of viral reservoirs.

 Recent advances in the discovery of human HIV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies 
(NmAbs) with high potency and breadth of coverage have rekindled an interest in their use 
as pre-exposure prophylaxis as well as therapeutic agents, including in the setting of mother-
to-child transmission (MTCT), where the time of exposure is known1,2. A combination of 
measures, including antiretroviral treatment (ART) of the mother and the infant, Caesarean 
section, and formula feeding, have diminished the rate of MTCT from 35% to less than 3%3. 
Despite this reduction, HIV infects approximately 200,000 children yearly, primarily where 
ART is not available4. Treatment of babies with ART during both the early peripartum and 
breastfeeding timeframes is recommended5, but risks remain, including toxicities associated 
with long-term use and the development of drug resistant viral variants6. Therefore, 
discovering less toxic methods to limit transmission to newborns would be advantageous2.
In mucosal HIV and SIV transmission, the virus establishes a small founder population of 
infected cells once it has traversed the vaginal mucosal barrier7. This localized infection 
undergoes rapid expansion and spreads to local draining lymph nodes (LN), before 
disseminating systemically by 1 week post exposure8,9. Similarly in NHP models of oral 
SIV exposure, the oral and esophageal mucosa and tonsils are sites of early viral infection 
within 1 day post-exposure, with rapid systemic dissemination via the regional lymphatics 
occurring within 1 week post-exposure10,11. Because IgG from the circulation contributes 
significantly to the immunoglobulin pool in tissue and genital tract secretions, passively 
transferred neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) may exhibit their protective effect by interaction 
with the virus at the mucosal level12, thus preventing systemic spread. In adult nonhuman 
primate (NHP) models of mucosal SHIV transmission, there is abundant evidence for 
protective prophylactic efficacy with passively transferred human NmAbs13–18. In vitro, 
NmAbs have been shown to block HIV infection of dendritic cells and subsequent 
transmission to T cells19. Direct vaginal application of NAbs prior to challenge is protective 
in macaques20, and in HIV exposed but uninfected humans mucosal IgA can block 
transcytosis in vitro12. Vaccine-induced protection from vaginal challenge correlated with 
levels of gp41-specific cervicovaginal IgA and IgG with antiviral and transcytosis blocking 
activities21. However, tissue localization and kinetics of passively transferred antibodies are 
still not well-defined13,22.
There is evidence for impact of NmAbs on the plasma virus in established infections in NHP 
models23–25 and in humans25,26. In NHP models, post-exposure prophylaxis using cocktails 
of first generation human NmAbs b12, 2G12, 2F5 and 4E10 partially prevented oral SHIV 
infection in newborns24. A single dose combining the newer, more potent NmAbs 
VRC07-523 and PGT121 delivered 10 days after intravenous SHIV infection suppressed 
acute viremia and limited seeding of viral reservoirs in adult macaques 27. We have shown 
that neutralizing polyclonal IgG purified from SIV- or SHIV-infected macaques and given 
subcutaneously (s.c.) can effectively control viremia and accelerate B cell responses, 
resulting in reduced pathogenesis in SIV-infected adults28 and in SHIV-infected newborn 
macaques29,30. We hypothesized that a cocktail of two potent and broadly cross-reactive 
NmAbs, VRC07-523 and PGT121, would slow the initial virus expansion and reduce the 
chance of rapid escape in newborn macaques exposed to pathogenic SHIV. We show that 
combined doses as low as 10 mg/kg beginning at 24 h post-exposure can intercept

 replicating viral foci established by day one and prevent orally administered virus from 
establishing permanent viral reservoirs.
RESULTS
Titration and biodistribution of s.c. antibodies in macaques
We initially conducted studies: (1) to define the protective dose and kinetics of the CD4 
binding site-directed NmAb VRC01 to block oral SHIVSF162P3 infection in newborn 
macaques after s.c injection, and (2) to determine the kinetics of passively transferred IgG in 
naive and infected macaques. First, we administered VRC01 to a total of seven male and 
female one-month-old macaques at 20 mg/kg (n = 2) or 5 mg/kg (n = 5) 24 h before SHIV 
exposure. We measured Envelope-specific binding and neutralizing Ab kinetics in vivo. The 
time to maximal concentration in the plasma was 24 h, independent of dose, and the serum 
(plasma) half-life of VRC01 was 3.9 – 4.2 days (Supplementary Fig. 1). Neither of the two 
20 mg/kg dose animals and only one of five 5 mg/kg macaques became infected. In this 
macaque, the magnitude and kinetics of plasma virus, termed plasma virus load (PVL), were 
indistinguishable from that of control animals treated with IgG purified from naive 
macaques30 (Supplementary Fig. 1). These data are consistent with results from VRC01 
passive protection studies in juvenile and adult macaques18 and guided the therapeutic range 
for infant macaques.
Next, in a separate study designed to determine if the kinetics of passively transferred IgG is 
altered in the presence of viral antigen, we assessed the distribution of purified SIVIG 
(polyclonal Ig from SIV-infected macaques) in four male and female macaques, comparing 
SIVIG kinetics in SIV-infected macaques to naive macaques. SIVIG was rapidly distributed 
in plasma and tissues of infected and naive animals. (Supplementary Fig. 2). We used in situ 
hybridation to localize SIV in tissue samples collected at 24 h and at 2 weeks after 
SIVsmE660 oral challenge. SIV was undetectable in 24 h tissue samples, but was detectable 
by 2 weeks in tissues both adjacent to and distant from the site of challenge (Supplementary 
Fig. 3). Thus, IgG delivered s.c. is rapidly and widely distributed and is unimpeded by viral 
antigen.
NmAb cocktail immunotherapy in the presence of SHIV
We next assessed the effectiveness of HIV-1 NmAbs as post-exposure prophylaxis in one-
month-old newborns inoculated orally with SHIVSF162P3. For in vivo therapy, we tested a 
cocktail of VRC07-523 and PGT121, two potent NmAbs that target different regions of the 
HIV-1 Envelope and that have been shown to be additive in vitro31. VRC07-523 is an 
engineered clonal relative of VRC01 with increased neutralization of most HIV strains and 
improved in vivo protection capabilities32. Therefore we used VRC07 in lieu of VRC01 for 
these therapeutic studies. PGT121 interacts with variable regions and glycans of HIV-1 
gp12033,34 and protected adult macaques from mucosal challenge at very low plasma 
titers35. Cocktails of PGT121 and VRC07-523 were prepared at total doses of 10 mg/kg (5 
mg/kg each) and 40 mg/kg (20 mg/kg each) and delivered s.c.

 We inoculated twenty one-month-old rhesus macaques orally with SHIVSF162P3 on day 0 
and followed them for up to 28 weeks to assess virological, immunological, and disease 
outcomes with or without NmAb treatment starting on day 1. Pairs of animals were killed at 
days 1, 2, or 14 post-exposure to monitor the development of SHIV SF162P3 infection in 
blood and tissues of treated and untreated macaques (Table 1, Groups 1–4). We delivered 
NmAbs on days 1, 4, 7, and 10 after SHIV exposure (Fig. 1a and Table 1, Groups 4–6). 
SHIVSF162P3 infection by the oral route in one-month-old macaques results in reproducible, 
sustained PVL at >107 copies/ml plasma and ~104 copies per μg DNA for at least 24 weeks 
in all animals30. To conserve animals, historical controls were used as a comparison group 
for the 24-week follow-up (Table 1, Group 7).
We evaluated the kinetics of the individual NmAbs and the cocktail in plasma from all 
twelve treated infants that were on study for at least 2 weeks (Table 1, Groups 4, 5, and 6). 
Peak NmAb cocktail concentrations in plasma occurred by 24 h post s.c. injection in all 
animals at both NmAb doses. In the four animals that received 10 mg/kg, the average 
cocktail concentration during the first 2 weeks was 44 μg/ml, and in the eight animals that 
received 40 mg/kg, it was 113 μg/ml (Fig. 1b). Using reagents designed to specifically detect 
each NmAb independently, we found that PGT121 concentrations in the plasma were 
consistently higher at both doses than those of VRC07-523. Multiple dosing prevented 
calculation of in vivo half-lives of each NmAb, but PGT121 was detectable in plasma for 2 
weeks longer than VRC07-523 in several macaques. PGT121, administered at 5 mg/kg, was 
maintained for >20 weeks in the plasma from a single macaque, 33537 (Fig. 1b, bottom 
left). An unusually slow decay from plasma of passively infused PGT121 has been recently 
reported where plasma concentrations of 5–20 μg/ml were still present after 10 weeks 27.
We assessed SHIVSF162P3 neutralization activity in the plasma of all infant macaques and 
found it decayed by 6–7 weeks in all animals except 33537, where declining neutralization 
of SHIVSF162P3 was detected at titers of 102–103 before becoming undetectable at week 20 
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Calculation of the average plasma IC50 concentration of the NmAb 
cocktail during the first 2 weeks after SHIV exposure was 0.0134 and 0.0120 μg/mL in the 
10 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg groups, respectively, which is close to the IC50 (0.0128 μg/mL) 
obtained from purified NmAbs against SHIVSF162P3 in TZM-bl cells (Supplementary Fig. 
4).
To measure transudation of NmAb into tissues and to assess neutralization potency within 
tissues and organs during the first 2 weeks, we extracted specimens from six macaques at 
different necropsy timepoints. Analysis of the antibody extracted from two macaques 
(Group 4) that were sacrificed at 14 days after four doses of NmAbs showed that NmAbs 
were systemically distributed at concentrations from 48 to 700 ng/ml of tissue lysate 
(Supplementary Table 1). Two macaques (Group 2a) exposed to SHIVSF162P3, treated once 
with a NmAb cocktail dose of 10 mg/kg one day later, and sacrificed on day 2 had NmAbs 
in tissue lysates in concentrations up to 791 ng/ml.. Two macaques (Group 2b) treated once 
with 10 mg/kg without SHIV exposure had NmAbs in tissues at levels similar to macaques 
34263 and 34290 that were pre-exposed to SHIV. We assessed the neutralizing activity 
against SHIVSF162P3 in tissue homogenates from ~100 mg of necropsy samples from the 
animals sacrificed at 1, 2, and 14 days post-exposure (Groups 2 and 4). The 50%

 neutralization titers (ID50) against SHIVSF162P3 of tissue lysates averaged ~1:50 in the tested 
samples at 1 day after s.c. NmAb injections, increased to an average of ~1:100 by day 2, and 
were similar at day 14, with good agreement among titers of animals sacrificed at the same 
timepoints (Table 2). However, NmAb titers in the colon and reproductive tract from animal 
34290 were about three to five times higher than animal 34263, necropsied at the same time 
point. Tissue-associated IC50 concentrations of the NmAb cocktail in samples tested ranged 
from 0.5 ng/ml to 10.0 ng/ml, near the IC50 of the NmAb cocktail (Supplementary Fig. 4). 
We conclude that the presence of SHIV during the first day after oral exposure did not affect 
NmAb distribution or levels in vivo and that the NmAb cocktail was rapidly distributed to 
tissues.
SHIVSF162P3 dissemination with and without NmAb therapy
To determine the kinetics of SHIVSF162P3 in blood and tissues early in infection with and 
without post-exposure NmAb cocktail therapy, we measured virus in blood from macaques 
killed on days 1, 2, and 14 after oral SHIVSF162P3 exposure (Table 1, Groups 1–4). The two-
week timepoint was anticipated to be nearest to time of peak PVL. Plasma viremia in 
animals necropsied at day 14 without NmAbs was detected by day 4, increased rapidly, and 
peaked between 1–5 × 108 copies/ml of plasma (Fig. 2a,), consistent with the VRC01 study 
(Supplementary Fig. 1) and prior studies29,30. In stark contrast, no virus was detected in 
plasma or peripherial blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from NmAb-treated animals 
sacrificed at day 14 (Fig. 2a, b).
We collected multiple tissues at necropsy (Fig. 2c), and in samples collected within 2 days 
of SHIV SF162P3 exposure, we measured low levels of SHIV SF162P3 DNA in mucosa and 
LN, proximal and distal to the oral exposure site (Fig. 2d, e). In comparison, virus was 
widespread at day 14 in untreated animals (Fig. 2f) and peaked at >3,000 copies/μg of DNA 
throughout the LN and gut, consistent with levels of DNA in the tissues of adult and six-
month-old M. nemestrina with high levels of plasma viremia36. As seen in the blood, 
following NmAb treatment on days 1, 4, 7, and 10 at 40 mg/kg, virus was undetectable in 
any tissues at day 14 (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Table 2). To determine whether the viral 
DNA-positive tissues contained replicating SHIV, we measured viral RNA in several tissue 
samples taken from these same macaques sacrificed on 1, 2, or 14 days after virus exposure. 
Viral DNA and RNA levels, tested as blinded samples from these tissues, show that 
productive SHIV infection has begun in multiple tissues by day 1, increasing significantly by 
day 14 (Table 2). However, in two macaques treated with 10 mg/kg on day 1 (Group 2a, 
sacrificed on day 2) there was no viral RNA detected in the samples tested. Importantly, 
NmAbs were co-localized in these virus-positive tissues, suggesting the potential for 
antibody effects as early as 1 day post-treatment. Moreover, the results suggest that virus 
present early after exposure can be intercepted and cleared by NmAb present in the same 
tissues (Table 2).
Prevention of productive infection, viral rebound, and pathogenesis
To evaluate the effect of early short-term NmAb therapy on viral control, we monitored 
SHIV in blood, LN, and tissues in animals followed for 24–28 weeks. PVL in controls 
routinely peaked at 2 weeks post infection and persisted at levels that ranged from 106–108

 copies/ml. In newborns treated with 10 mg/kg (Fig. 3a) or 40 mg/kg (Fig. 3c), there was no 
plasma viremia detected in any of the samples collected over the course of the study. A 
single time point in the 40 mg/kg group was positive for only one of two replicates, and 
additional material to retest this sample was not available. Longitudinal cell-associated viral 
loads (CAVL) in PBMC DNA were negative for each of the >300 samples tested from the 10 
animals in Groups 5 and 6 (Fig. 3b, d). In short, all of the NmAb-treated infants had 
undetectable PVL or CAVL in blood.
We also measured the levels of SHIV SF162P3 DNA in >300 homogenized tissue samples 
obtained at 24–28 weeks post-exposure (w.p.i) and in inguinal LNs collected at week 12 
from all ten macaques using ultrasensitive QPCR37. Tissue samples from all SHIV-exposed 
infants that received the two-week course of NmAb cocktail were tested as coded samples 
and were negative for virus in both dosage groups (Supplementary Table 2). As discussed 
above, only very low levels of virus were detected in tissue specimens of Group 2a animals 
34263 and 34290, sacrificed at 2 days post-exposure (d.p.i.) after a single NmAb dose (Fig. 
2e). As was seen in the blood, virus was widespread in tissues at 14 d.p.i. in Group 3 control 
animals that did not receive NmAbs (Fig. 2f). As early as 1 d.p.i., tissue-associated virus in 
mucosal tissue adjacent to exposure site, draining LN and gut tissue was evident in Group 1 
untreated controls (Fig. 2d; Supplementary Table 2). When compared, NmAb-treated 
(Group 2a) versus non-treated (Group 1) groups that were sacrificed on 2 d.p.i and 1 d.p.i., 
respectively, Group 2a macaques had significantly lower amounts of tissue-associated virus 
detected (P = 0.0061; Fig. 4). The discovery of traces of virus detected 2 d.p.i (Fig. 2e) and 
none at 14 d.p.i. (Fig. 2g) implies that NmAbs intercepted, neutralized and disrupted SHIV 
in these animals and in all ten NmAb-treated infants that were followed for 6 months. 
Consistent with these data, pathology results also showed the absence of organ or tissue 
pathology (Supplementary Fig. 5).
No evidence for T cell immunity or viral rebound
To evaluate T cell immunity in the SHIV-exposed macaques, we used intracellular cytokine 
staining (ICS) to measure Gag and Vif responses in the PBMC, spleen and mesenteric LN 
for the ten macaques studied for 6 months. No anti-SHIV T cell responses were detected in 
PBMCs at week 20 or in necropsy tissue samples (Supplementary Fig. 6). To determine 
whether there were any reservoirs controlled by CD8+ T cell-mediated suppression, we 
depleted CD8+ cells in the four animals in the 10 mg/kg group to undetectable levels and 
monitored for viremia for 4 weeks (Supplementary Fig. 6). There was no evidence of plasma 
virus rebound in these animals during the CD8+ depletion phase (Fig. 3a, b), further 
supporting the concept that early passive NmAb therapy with the cocktail of VRC07-523 
and PGT121 disrupted establishment of virus reservoirs preventing exposure to antigen and 
the development of cellular immunity.
DISCUSSION
Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) with ART is effective in limiting transmission in the 
setting of MTCT as well as in healthy adults38. One of the major goals in treating HIV-1 
infection is to discover methods that can clear the established viral reservoir39. To date, only

 a single case of a “functional cure” has been documented following bone marrow 
transplantation40. Vaccine-induced persistent T cell responses cannot prevent infection but 
can reduce established SIV reservoirs to undetectable levels in about half of vaccinated 
macaques41. NHP studies with ART suggest that treatment as early as 3 days post-infection 
is too late to prevent establishment of the reservoir, as virus rebounded upon drug 
cessation42. These data are consistent with the case of the “Mississippi baby”, where ART 
therapy begun within 30 hours of birth did not prevent HIV infection43,44. Thus, the time for 
intervention is extremely limited, and ART alone may not be effective at eliminating a 
founder infection.
Viral RNA has been detected as early as 1 day in macaques following vaginal exposure to 
SIV45, but there is a common view that HIV and SIV may have a short ‘eclipse phase’ of 
limited, localized viral replication lasting a number of days, wherein the spread of the 
founder infection is dependent upon target cell availability in order to spread to lymphatic 
tissues 45. Our data show that, at least in this model system of oral SHIV exposure in 
newborn macaques, virus replication is detected in lymphatic tissues by 24 hours and is not 
locally restricted. In this study, we found evidence of immediate impact of a single dose of 
passively transferred NmAbs on seeding of virus, with a significant difference in early 
tissue-associated viral RNA and DNA in treated versus non-treated infants. Early post-
exposure short-term administration of powerful NmAbs effectively cleared the virus in vivo 
by 14 days and prevented rebound after decay of the passive NmAbs. We present three lines 
of evidence that the ten macaques studied for >24 weeks were clear of virus. First, all of the 
macaques failed to develop adaptive immune responses. Second, we showed that over 300 
coded tissue samples from these macaques were virus negative by an ultrasensitive PCR 
methodology based on SIV gag. Third, we depleted the CD8+ T cells in the four lower-dose 
macaques (Group 6), and observed no viral rebound.
These experiments show that NmAbs delivered s.c. are swiftly distributed to blood and 
tissues and that they maintain neutralizing activity at distal sites. They further indicate that 
NmAbs are effective at clearing viral foci in blood and tissues during the earliest stages of 
HIV penetration of tissues, a different mechanism from that of ART. We hypothesize that 
Fc-mediated functions are required for killing infected cells that express gp160 on their 
surface46. If so, then NmAbs present during an extended period of time after exposure would 
have the capability to neutralize virus emanating from infected cells that were established 
within the first few hours following an exposure event. In this setting, post-exposure therapy 
using a NmAb cocktail administered 24 h after SHIV exposure and continuing for 2 weeks 
resulted in maintenance of high concentrations in vivo for at least 2 weeks. The importance 
of repeated dosing is not known, but in the case of breastfeeding mothers, there is continued 
opportunity for transmission of HIV-1. It will be important to understand if repeated NmAb 
dosing in babies could expand the protective window.
Several relevant questions remain unanswered for treatment of HIV-infected newborns and 
children born to HIV-positive mothers, including practical and cultural issues of treating 
breastfeeding mothers and babies, as well as a determination of optimal antibody cocktail 
formulations. Any future use of human NmAbs in the clinic will likely require several 
antibodies or engineered antibodies with multiple specificities in order to avoid the potential

 for escape. Because ART has a short half-life and requires strict adherence to the drug 
regimen to be effective, supplementation with passive NmAbs with relatively long half-lives 
may widen the therapeutic window. Identifying human NmAbs that can impact infection in a 
macaque model for MTCT can provide proof-of-principle of the value of using antibodies to 
augment ART. In fact, safety trials of HIV-exposed newborns with the NmAb VRC01 have 
begun in the US and South Africa (http://impaactnetwork.org/studies/P1112.asp.), following 
a safety trial in adults47. Our findings begin to define the window of opportunity for 
effective treatment after intrapartum exposure. If these results can be applied to clinical 
settings, there is optimism that early passive immunotherapy may provide protection from 
viral infection, even in the absence of ART.
ONLINE METHODS
Animal models and humane care guidelines
The Oregon Health & Science University West Campus Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee approved all macaque studies. Studies were performed at the Oregon National 
Primate Research Center in Beaverton, Oregon, U.S.A. (ONPRC). The ONPRC is accredited 
by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International 
and adheres to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the United States 
Public Health Service Policy on the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The 
initial study with SIVIG utilized four M. mulatta (male and female) of varying ages that 
were obtained from the breeding colony. For the studies in one-month-old macaques, 27 
seven day-old M. mulatta (rhesus macaques, male and female) were obtained from the 
breeding colony and raised for 3 weeks in the ABSL-2 infant nursery. Time of birth 
determined animal allocation, so that animals were randomly assigned to the study groups as 
they accrued. Protection studies with VRC01 (n = 7 infants) were pilot studies and were not 
designed for statistical analyses (all or none effects of virus acquisition). Group sizes of six 
had been previously shown to allow statistically distinguishable measurements in plasma 
and cell associated virus loads at 6 months as the primary study outcome for antibody 
treatment. Serial sacrifice studies included groups of two animals each and viral 
quantification analyses of ~30 tissue samples per animal. Infants were excluded if sire or 
dam could not be confirmed to be absent of Mamu B*08 and B*17 MHC Class I alleles. At 
1 month of age, after adaptation to formula feeding, animals were transferred to ABSL-2+ 
containment for study procedures. Infants were paired with another macaque of the same 
age for nursery care and containment housing. In all studies, infants were monitored for 
clinical signs of disease. Clinical evaluation included measurement of peripheral LN size 
and body weight, as well as evaluation of appetite, attitude and stool quality. All animals 
were euthanized under IACUC guidelines and consistent with the recommendations of the 
American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Guidelines for Euthanasia.
IgG and NmAb preparations
Normal IgG was purified from 1 L of pooled plasma from SRV and SIV negative adult 
rhesus macaques as previously described30. VRC01, VRC07-523 and PGT121 were 
expressed as IgG1 antibodies by transient transfection of Expi293F™ cells (ThermoFisher 
Scientific Inc.), and purified over protein A columns.32,49 The VH and VL regions of

 PGT121 were synthesized based on the published sequence33. Purified polyclonal anti-
SIVsmE660 IgG (SIVIG) was pooled from two SIVsmE660 infected animals from a prior 
experiment28. All antibody preparations were delivered s.c. at multiple sites around the 
dorsal cervical and thoracic regions of the animals in the doses described in the text.
Virus inoculations
Titrated stocks of SHIVSF162P3 (passage 3) virus50 were obtained through the AIDS 
Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, National Institute of Allergy 
and Infectious Diseases, US National Institutes of Health (catalog number 6526; contributors 
J. Harouse, C. Cheng-Mayer and R. Pal) for each study. Infant macaques were administered 
a 50% animal infectious dose (AID50) (~7 × 108 viral RNA copies) of a macaque cell-grown 
stock of SHIVSF162P3, divided into two 1 ml oral doses given ~15 min apart. AID50 was 
determined in a titration experiment described previously.36
Virus detection in plasma, PBMC, and tissue homogenates
Nucleic acid from plasma and cell culture supernatant or PBMC was purified using a 
Maxwell 16 instrument (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, 
using the LEV Viral Nucleic Acid Kit and the LEV Whole Blood Nucleic Acid Kit, 
respectively. SHIV viral loads in plasma and cell culture supernatant were determined by 
quantitative RT-PCR using the methods developed by Piatak et. al.51, except for a slightly 
modified master mix to increase sample input per reaction. SHIV viral loads in PBMC DNA 
were determined by quantitative PCR using Fast Advanced Mastermix on an Applied 
Biosystems QuantStudio 6 Flex instrument (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Reactions 
were performed with 2 μg nucleic acid input for 45 cycles using the FAST cycling protocol 
(95°C for 1 s, 60°C for 20 s) in a 30 μl reaction volume. Virus copy numbers were estimated 
by comparison to a linearized pBSII-SIVgag (gift from Michael Piatak, NCI) standard curve 
and calculated per cell equivalent using the input nucleic acid mass and by assuming a DNA 
content of 6.5 μg per million cells. Primers and probe used for plasma and PBMC assays 
were those described by Piatak et. al.: SGAG21 forward 
(GTCTGCGTCATPTGGTGCATTC), SGAG22 reverse 
(CACTAGKTGTCTCTGCACTATPTGTTTTG), and pSGAG23 (5'-(FAM)-
CTTCPTCAGTKTGTTTCACTTTCTCTTCTGCG-(BHQ1)-3').
For viral RNA and DNA reservoir detection in tissues, a recently developed ultrasensitive 
nested quantitative PCR and RT-PCR approach37 targeting a highly conserved region in SIV 
and SHIV gag was employed. Primers used for DNA pre-amplification were SIVnestF01 
(GATTTGGATTAGCAG AAAGCCTGTTG) and SIVnestR01 
(GTTGGTCTACTTGTTTTTGGCATAGTTTC). The reverse transcription step in the RNA 
assay used the SIVnestR01 primer instead of random hexamers, in order to facilitate priming 
of specific target sequences. Primers used for quantitative PCR were SGAG21 forward, 
SGAG22 reverse, and pSGAG23 as described above. PCR reaction conditions for both 
rounds were as described with minor modifications 52. Briefly, samples were heated at 95°C 
for 5 min, and then put on ice. Each sample was assayed in 12 replicates (5 μg each), with 
two of the reactions including a spike of 10 or 20 copies of DNA or RNA, respectively, 
containing the SIVgag target sequence in order to assess PCR reaction efficiency. None of

 the tested RNA and DNA samples showed significant amplification inhibition, which was 
defined as a 5 cycle amplification delay compared to the amplification kinetics of reactions 
containing solely 10 copies of standard. First round amplification involved 12 cycles (95°C 
for 30 s and 60°C for 1 min) in 50 μl reactions. Then, 5 μl of each pre-amplified replicate 
was assayed by quantitative PCR using Fast Advanced Mastermix in a 30 μl reaction volume 
in the QuantStudio 6 Flex instrument. Reactions were performed for 45 cycles using the 
FAST cycling protocol. Virus copy numbers were derived from the frequency of positive 
replicates using the Poisson distribution and calculated as copies per μg of DNA. Plasma and 
tissue samples tested for virus were blinded to staff members performing the RNA and DNA 
assays.
Antibody detection in tissues and secretions
Tissue samples were sectioned and transferred into Radio-Immunoprecipitation Assay 
(RIPA) buffer with protease inhibitor cocktail. Tissue disruption was accomplished with 
zirconia/silica beads (1.0 mm, Biospec Products) in a Beadbeater (Biospec Products) device 
with 2 cycles of 2-min intervals with brief incubations on ice between each cycle. 
Supernatants were aspirated and centrifuged for 5 min to pellet residual debris. Mucosal 
secretions were collected on Weck-cel spears and extracted as previously described.53 
Secretions were stored at −80° C until assayed. Homogenates and secretions containing 
transudated antibody were used in ELISA and neutralization assays as described below.
CD8+ T cell depletion and staining
Four animals were given the CD8α-depleting antibody M-T807R1 (US NIH, Nonhuman 
Primate Reagent Resource). Peripheral blood was monitored for the presence of CD8+ T 
cells for four weeks. 1 × 105 PBMC were stained with CD3 AlexaFluor 700, CD8 Pacific 
Blue (BD Biosciences), and CD4 PE-Cy7 (Biolegend).
Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS)
CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were measured from blood and tissues by flow cytometric 
ICS, as previously described.54 Briefly, 1 × 106 mononuclear cells were incubated with Gag 
or Vif open-reading frame pools and the co-stimulatory molecules CD28 and CD49d (BD 
Biosciences) for 1 hour, followed by addition of Brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich) for an 
additional 8 h. Co-stimulation without antigen served as a background control, while 
incubation with Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (Toxin Technology) served as the positive 
control. The cells were then labeled with CD4 PE-Cy7 (Biolegend) and CD8 PerCP-Cy5.5 
(BD Biosciences) and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. After permeabilization, the cells 
were stained with CD3 Pacific Blue, IFN-γ APC, TNF-α FITC (BD Biosciences, all), and 
CD69 PE-Texas Red (Beckman Coulter). The cells were fixed and flow cytometric analysis 
was performed on an LSR-II instrument (BD Biosciences). Analysis was done using FlowJo 
software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). In some cases, cells were CD25-depleted prior to setting 
up the ICS experiment to remove T regulatory cells (Miltenyi Biotec).

 In-situ hybridization (ISH)
In the SIVIG transudation experiments, measurement of in-situ hybridization for SIV 
antigen was performed on tissues collected from the two animals that underwent oral SIV 
challenge. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were assayed for SIV viral RNA 
expression by ISH as previously described.55 Briefly, following deparaffinization, the 
sections were hybridized overnight at 45°C with either a sense or an antisense SIVmac239 
digoxigenin-UTP-labeled riboprobe. The hybridized sections were blocked with 3% normal 
sheep and horse serum in 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.4, and then incubated with sheep anti-
digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and nitroblue 
tetrazolium-5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (BCIP; Vector Labs). ISH-
stained tissues from submandibular LN, tonsil and the ileum were visualized and 
photographed with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope.
ELISAs
Enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect total IgG and SIV 
gp130-specific antibodies in the SIVIG transudation experiments. Briefly, half-well EIA 
plates (Costar) were coated with either a goat anti-rhesus IgG (H+L)-unlabeled (Southern 
Biotech) (for total IgG ELISA) or recombinant SIVsmE660 gp130 purified as described28 (for 
gp130 ELISA) at 2 μg/ml in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer and incubated overnight. Plates 
were washed three times (0.1% triton X-100 in 1× PBS) and blocked with 1% normal goat 
serum/5% non-fat dried milk in PBS for 1 h at RT. SIVIG standards and homogenates were 
diluted in 1% triton X-100/2% bovine serum albumin/5% fetal bovine serum in PBS. After 
washing, a 1:4,000 dilution of goat anti-rhesus IgG (H+L)-HRP (Southern Biotech) was 
added and incubated for 1 h at RT followed by TMB substrate (Southern Biotech). Plates 
were read on a SpectraMax 190 at absorbance at 650 nm. Data were reported as the slope of 
absorbance over time. Concentrations of SIVIG in tissue disruption supernatants were 
calculated by comparing the average slope numbers to the SIVIG standard curve. ELISA 
was used to assess for the presence of gp140-specific antibodies as previously described54 in 
plasma and tissue homogenates. Plasma NmAb levels were quantified using plates coated 
with either RSC3 (VRC07-523) or ST0A9 (PGT121).56 Briefly, Nunc MaxiSorp (Thermo 
Fisher) plates were coated overnight with 200 ng/well of RSC3 in PBS, washed with PBST 
five times, and blocked with TBST with 5% milk and 2% BSA for 1 h at RT. Serial dilutions 
of all samples were plated in duplicate. Each NmAb (for standard curves) and positive and 
negative controls were included on each plate. Plasma was incubated for 1 h at RT, followed 
by a PBST wash. Bound NmAbs were probed with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat 
anti-human IgG (1:5,000 dilution; Jackson Laboratories) for 30 min at RT. The plate was 
washed and TMB (Pierce) substrate was added. Once color was developed stopping buffer 
was added and the optical density at 450 nm was read. GraphPad Prism and Microsoft Office 
software was used to calculate NmAb concentrations.
TZM-bl neutralization assay
Plasma samples from each animal were tested at all available time-points for neutralizing 
activity using the 96-well TZM-bl neutralization assay described previously57.

 Statistics
The data in Figure 4 shows SIV DNA copies measured in 17 anatomical sites in 2 paired 
groups of 4 control animals. A two-stage sequential approach (1) calculated the averages of 
SIV DNA copies of two biological replicates for each site in each group, and (2) applied a 
Wilcoxon signed rank test to account for the matched pair nature of anatomical sites.

measurements of SIV viral RNA in blood using a quantitative reverse-transcription PCR 
(QRT-PCR) assay and in (b) PBMC by quantitative PCR (QPCR). CD8+ T cell depletion 
study timeline is shown in red. Data shown in gray indicate mean plasma virus (+/− SD) 
from eight historical controls from an earlier study18,30.
