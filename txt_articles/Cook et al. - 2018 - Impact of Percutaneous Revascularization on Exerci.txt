ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Recently, the therapeutic benefits of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have been challenged in
patients with stable coronary artery disease (SCD).
OBJECTIVES The authors examined the impact of PCI on exercise responses in the coronary circulation, the microcir-
culation, and systemic hemodynamics in patients with SCD.
METHODS A total of 21 patients (mean age 60.3 � 8.4 years) with SCD and single-vessel coronary stenosis underwent
cardiac catheterization. Pre-PCI, patients exercised on a supine ergometer until rate-limiting angina or exhaustion.
Simultaneous trans-stenotic coronary pressure-flow measurements were made throughout exercise. Post-PCI, this pro-
cess was repeated. Physiological parameters, rate-limiting symptoms, and exercise performance were compared between
pre-PCI and post-PCI exercise cycles.
RESULTS PCI reduced ischemia as documented by fractional flow reserve value (pre-PCI 0.59 � 0.18 to post-PCI 0.91 �
0.07), instantaneous wave-free ratio value (pre-PCI 0.61 � 0.27 to post-PCI 0.96 � 0.05) and coronary flow reserve
value (pre-PCI 1.7 � 0.7 to post-PCI 3.1 � 1.0; p < 0.001 for all). PCI increased peak-exercise average peak coronary flow
velocity (p < 0.0001), coronary perfusion pressure (distal coronary pressure; p < 0.0001), systolic blood pressure
(p ¼ 0.01), accelerating wave energy (p < 0.001), and myocardial workload (rate-pressure product; p < 0.01). These
changes observed immediately following PCI resulted from the abolition of stenosis resistance (p < 0.0001). PCI was
also associated with an immediate improvement in exercise time (þ67 s; 95% confidence interval: 31 to 102 s;
p < 0.0001) and a reduction in rate-limiting angina symptoms (81% reduction in rate-limiting angina symptoms
post-PCI; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS In patients with SCD and severe single-vessel stenosis, objective physiological responses to exercise
immediately normalize following PCI. This is seen in the coronary circulation, the microcirculation, and systemic
hemodynamics. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2018;72:970–83) © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier on behalf of the

n patients with stable coronary artery disease
(SCD), the primary treatment goal of percuta-
neous coronary intervention (PCI) is the relief
of angina and improvement in functional capacity.
However, the first double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial of PCI for stable angina, the ORBITA trial (Objec-
tive Randomised Blinded Investigation With Optimal
Medical Therapy of Angioplasty in Stable Angina) (1),
found a far smaller effect on exercise tolerance and
symptoms than found in unblinded research (2–4)
and in everyday clinical practice. This finding has
refocused attention on the need to comprehensively
define the therapeutic mechanisms of PCI in SCD.
Cardiac catheter laboratory protocols have recently
been described that enable invasive measurements of
coronary and systemic hemodynamics to be per-
formed during supine exercise. Application of these
protocols have yielded important mechanistic insight
into a variety of anginal conditions. These include the
physiological mechanisms underlying the warm-up
angina phenomenon (5), the mechanisms of angina
in severe aortic stenosis (6), and the alleviation of
angina on exertion by sublingual nitroglycerin (7).
In this study, we exercised patients on the coronary
catheter laboratory table during cardiac catheteri-
zation, immediately before and after PCI. Our hypo-
thesis was that in patients with stable angina and
hemodynamically
significant
single-vessel
disease,
PCI would immediately improve objectively docu-
mented exercise responses in the coronary circulation,
the microcirculation, and systemic hemodynamics.
METHODS
STUDY
POPULATION. Patients
with
exertional
angina and single-vessel coronary artery disease were
recruited from elective PCI waiting lists at both the
Hammersmith Hospital and the Essex Cardiothoracic
Centre. Inclusion criteria were left ventricular ejec-
tion fraction >50% and hemodynamic significance of
the target vessel (defined as either fractional flow
reserve [FFR] #0.80 or instantaneous wave-free ratio
[iFR] #0.89). All patients were on maximally toler-
ated antianginal medical therapy. Exclusion crite-
ria were hemodynamically significant multivessel
disease, left main stem or ostial stenosis,
moderate/severe valvular disease, chrono-
tropic incompetence with pacemaker, severe
airways disease, or physical inability to ex-
ercise. Patients continued all usual medica-
tions and were loaded with dual antiplatelet
agents as per routine practice of the recruit-
ing center. All subjects gave written informed
consent
in
accordance
with
the
protocol
approved by the regional ethics committee
(16/LO/1928).
CATHETERIZATION PROTOCOL. The patient
was positioned on the catheterization labo-
ratory table and secured to a pre-mounted
supine cycle ergometer (Lode Angio, Lode,
Groningen, the Netherlands). The ergometer
was connected to a laptop computer with
software (Lode Export Manager 10, V 10.5.1,
Lode) to initiate the exercise protocol and
acquire performance data. The target vessel
was intubated with a standard 6-F guide cath-
eter from the right radial artery. Intra-arterial
unfractionated heparin (70 to 100 U/kg) and
intracoronary
nitroglycerin
(300
mg)
were
given before coronary angiography and phys-
iological measurements.
The optimal working view was determined, and a
standard coronary guidewire was advanced distally to
secure the target vessel. A dual pressure and velocity
sensor 0.014-inch intracoronary wire (Combowire XT,
Volcano Corporation, San Diego, California) was then
advanced to the tip of the guiding catheter, and the
pressure signals normalized. The Combowire tip-
mounted sensor was advanced distal to the stenosis
by a minimum of 15 mm, and its position recorded
cineographically. Therefore, 2 wires were positioned
in the target vessel for all study measurements. An
optimal Doppler velocity trace was obtained by rota-
tional manipulation of the Combowire. Continuous
pressure-flow measurements were performed under
resting conditions, during a 2-min intravenous infu-
sion of adenosine and during an incremental exercise
protocol. The order of adenosine and exercise was
randomly assigned. A return to baseline hemody-
namic conditions was mandated between each stage
of the experimental protocol.

 Before removal from the patient, the Combowire
was returned to the catheter tip to assess for pressure
drift. Angioplasty was then performed according to
standard clinical practice. Stent optimization was
performed at the operator’s discretion. Following an-
gioplasty, the Combowire was reintroduced, advanced
to the guiding catheter tip, and then renormalized
as before. The Combowire was advanced to the
same intracoronary position as previous, with cross-
reference to the cine-acquired roadmap image for
confirmation. All aforementioned stages of the pre-
PCI study protocol were then repeated, including the
incremental exercise protocol.
EXERCISE PROTOCOL. An incremental exercise pro-
tocol starting at 40 W and increasing by 20 W every
minute was used for all patients. The guiding catheter
was disengaged from the coronary ostium for the
duration of exercise to prevent vessel trauma and to
permit central aortic pressure waveform recording
without damping. Exercise was continued until the
development of rate-limiting angina symptoms or
physical exhaustion. Systemic serum lactate levels
were measured from arterial blood drawn from the
guiding catheter immediately before and at peak ex-
ercise in order to quantify the rise in serum lactate
during exercise.
DATA
ANALYSIS. The electrocardiogram, pressure
waveforms, and coronary flow velocity signals were
directly extracted from the digital archive of the de-
vice console (ComboMap, V 1.9, Volcano Corporation)
for offline analysis. Wave-intensity analysis (WIA)
was performed according to methodology as previ-
ously described (8). Exercise data were exported from
the ergometer software package using a dedicated
export manager (Lode Export Manager 10, V 10.5.1,

PULSE
WAVE
ANALYSIS
OF
CENTRAL
AORTIC
PRESSURE. Central arterial pressure waveforms were
obtained from the fluid-filled guiding catheter in
the aortic root. A custom-made software package
(PyCharm CE, V 2017.2.4) was used to analyze a
minimum of 5 consecutive ensemble-averaged car-
diac cycles through electrocardiogram gating. Semi-
automatic identification of the upstroke and peak of
the arterial tracing and the trough of the dichrotic
notch permitted calculation of the tension-time index
(TTI) (relating to myocardial oxygen demand [9]),
diastolic
time
index
(DTI)
(relating
to
coronary
perfusion [10]), diastolic time fraction (DTF), and
pulse pressure (PP). The rate-pressure product (RPP)
is a surrogate marker of myocardial oxygen con-
sumption and myocardial workload (11), and was
calculated as the product of central systolic blood
pressure and heart rate.
STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS. Tests of normality were
first performed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Contin-
uous variables were expressed as mean � SD (unless
otherwise
specified).
Categorical
variables
were
expressed as numbers and percentages. Continuous
variables
were
compared
with
paired
Student’s
t-tests. Categorical variables were compared with chi-
square tests. Repeated measures analysis of variance
was used to evaluate trends across the stages of ex-
ercise pre- and post-PCI. If significant, differences in
separate exercise stages were evaluated with paired t-
tests. Applicable tests were 2 tailed, and p < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. All analyses were
performed using R version 3.2.1 (R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
RESULTS
STUDY POPULATION. Twenty-one patients (19 male;
age 60.3 � 8.4 years) completed the study protocol. A
total of 46 patients were consented to the study but
were
unable
to
complete
the
protocol
for
the
following reasons: could not validly exercise (n ¼ 5),
became ineligible after coronary angiogram and/or
physiological assessment (n ¼ 11), could not perform
post-PCI exercise (n ¼ 2), or technical difficulties
prevented data acquisition (n ¼ 7). A full breakdown
of the reasons for noncompletion of the full study
protocol is listed in Table 1.
The baseline characteristics of the study popula-
tion are summarized in Table 2. The majority of
patients were in Canadian Cardiovascular Society
(CCS) class 2 or 3 at enrollment. The mean number of
prescribed antianginal medications per patient was
1.4 � 0.7.
STENOSIS AND PROCEDURAL CHARACTERISTICS.
Stenosis characteristics are shown in Table 3 and in
Figure 1. The stenoses were angiographically and
physiologically severe. Mean stenosis diameter by
quantitative coronary angiography was 75.7 � 10.3%.
FFR averaged 0.59 � 0.18, iFR 0.61 � 0.27, coronary
flow reserve (CFR) 1.7 � 0.7, and hyperemic stenosis
resistance (HSR) 2.3 � 2.3.
All stenoses were focal and were predominantly
proximal (62% [13 of 21]), most frequently in the left
anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) (52% [11 of
21]). All PCIs were performed successfully with drug-
eluting stents. The mean number of stents implanted
per patient was 1.0 � 0.2, the mean length of stent
was 23 � 8.3 mm, and the mean diameter of stent was
3.3 � 0.4 mm. Post-dilatation was performed in 18 of
21 stents (86%). Post-PCI, FFR rose to 0.91 � 0.07, iFR
to 0.96 � 0.05, and CFR to 3.1 � 1.0, and hyperemic
stenosis resistance fell to 0.2 � 0.2 (p < 0.0001 for all).
SYMPTOM AND EXERCISE RESPONSES. Before PCI,
95% of patients stopped exercising because of chest
pain or breathlessness (Figure 2). By contrast, after
PCI, only 10% did so, with the remainder stopping
because of physical exhaustion without chest pain or
breathlessness. Before PCI, baseline serum lactate
was 1.0 � 0.41 mmol/l, and this increased to 2.4 �
1.1 mmol/l at peak exercise (þ240%). After PCI,
baseline serum lactate was 1.3 � 0.51 mmol/l, and this
increased to 4.1 � 1.8 mmol/l at peak exercise (þ315%;
p < 0.001 for the difference in increment of serum
lactate during exercise). Exercise time increased by
67 s (95% confidence interval: 31 to 102 s; p < 0.001)
(Figure 3) after PCI. Full exercise performance data
are shown in Table 4.
SYSTEMIC HEMODYNAMIC RESPONSES. Before PCI,
blood pressure initially rose progressively with exer-
cise but then fell at peak exercise when symptoms
developed (peak exercise 7.7 mm Hg below the pre-
ceding time point; p ¼ 0.01) (Figure 4). After PCI,
blood pressure rose initially again; however, at peak
exercise,
blood
pressure
plateaued
and
did
not
decline. Corresponding to peak exercise in the pre-
PCI state, at the equivalent exercise time point in
the post-PCI state, blood pressure was significantly
higher (delta 14.0 mm Hg; p ¼ 0.01). Because patients
could exercise for longer following PCI, an extra time
point at an even higher workload was recorded, and
again this was significantly higher than peak exercise
during the pre-PCI state (delta 12.0 mm Hg; p ¼ 0.02).
The same pattern was seen for RPP.

 Analysis of central arterial pressure waveforms
during exercise are summarized in Figure 5. PP
increased with exercise (p < 0.001) both before and
after PCI. Because both heart rate and systolic blood
pressure increased together, TTI did not increase
significantly during exercise (p ¼ 0.51). In line with
the overall increase in heart rate (and thus shortening
of diastole), DTI and DTF both decreased significantly
with exercise (p < 0.0001). Changes in PP, TTI, DTI,
and DTF during exercise were similar both before and
after PCI (p > 0.05 for all). Full systemic hemody-
namic responses are shown in Table 5.
CORONARY AND MICROCIRCULATORY HEMODYNAMIC
RESPONSES. Coronary circulation and microvascular
responses to exercise are summarized in Figure 6.
Resting
coronary
flow
velocity
was
similar
both
before and after PCI (p ¼ 0.19). Flow significantly
increased during both pre- and post-PCI exertions
(p ¼ 0.03) but displayed markedly different patterns
of rise (p < 0.01). Before PCI, coronary flow velocity
increased minimally with exercise and plateaued
early. Conversely, after PCI, coronary flow velocity
increased in a near-linear fashion with exercise and
was significantly higher for all time-matched stages of
exercise (p < 0.0001). At peak exercise, coronary flow
velocity was 65% higher after PCI than before (18.2 �
7.7 cm/s vs. 30.1 � 8.6 cm/s; p < 0.00001).
Distal coronary pressure, trans-stenotic pressure
gradient, trans-stenotic pressure ratio (Pd/Pa) and
stenosis resistance were all markedly improved at all
stages of exercise following PCI (p < 0.0001 for all)
(Table 5). The
reduction in global microvascular
resistance during exercise was similar both before

 and after PCI (p ¼ 0.60) (Online Figure 1). However,
diastolic microvascular resistance (DMR), the portion
of the cardiac cycle where myocardial compressive
forces are at their lowest (12), was significantly lower
at rest before PCI (p ¼ 0.04) (Figure 6). Furthermore,
the pattern of decline in DMR was different (p ¼ 0.01)
before versus after PCI. Before PCI, DMR reached its
minimum value earlier during exercise than in the
post-PCI state. Full coronary and microcirculatory
hemodynamic responses are shown in Table 5.
Eighteen of the 21 paired datasets were suitable for
WIA. The 2 waves that accelerate flow are the back-
ward
expansion
wave
(BEW)
and
the
forward
compression wave (FCW) (8). Exercise WIA data are
summarized in Online Figure 2. The absolute values
of BEW intensity and FCW intensity at rest and at
peak exercise are displayed in Figure 7. At rest, net
wave intensity of the flow accelerating waves was
similar both pre- and post-PCI (p ¼ 0.42). However, at
peak-exercise post-PCI, net wave intensity of the flow
accelerating waves was significantly higher than at
peak exercise pre-PCI (p ¼ 0.01).
The contribution to flow acceleration by backward
expansion
and
forward
compression
waves
was
different at rest and at peak exercise before versus
after PCI. In comparison between the pre- and post-
PCI resting states, BEW intensity was significantly
lower (p ¼ 0.04), and FCW intensity was significantly
higher
(p
¼ 0.03)
following
PCI.
In
comparison
between the pre- and post-PCI peak-exercise states,
BEW intensity was similar (p ¼ 0.32), and FCW
intensity was significantly higher (p ¼ 0.02) following
PCI.
DISCUSSION
This study shows that coronary flow and pressure
cannot rise to meet the demands of physical exercise
when there is a significant coronary stenosis. PCI
immediately normalizes the ability of coronary flow
and
pressure
to
rise
to
match
this
myocardial
demand.
Second, PCI improves coronary, microvascular,
and systemic hemodynamic responses to exercise. By
abolishing
stenosis
resistance
with
instantaneous
effect, PCI restores the coronary vessel to its primary
role as a conduit and the capacity of the microcircu-
lation to progressively vasodilate during exercise.
Third, in patients with stable angina and physio-
logically significant single-vessel disease unblinded
to the fact that they have received PCI, PCI immedi-
ately improves exercise capacity and reduces rate-
limiting angina symptoms (Central Illustration).
Last, in contrast to the traditional advice that pa-
tients should only resume exercise in a delayed and
graduated fashion following PCI, this study demon-
strates the safety of performing maximal physical
exercise immediately after coronary stenting.
PCI AND CHANGES IN THE CORONARY CIRCULATION
RESPONSE TO EXERCISE. Because oxygen extraction is
near maximal even at rest (13), the principal way
myocardial oxygen demand on exercise can be met is

 through an increase in coronary blood flow (14). We
found that coronary flow increased in very different
ways before versus after PCI. Before PCI, coronary
flow plateaued early during exercise. This can be
explained by both mechanical limitation to flow from
the stenosis, manifesting as high stenosis resistance,
and premature maximal dilatation of the microcircu-
latory vascular bed.
Immediately after PCI, flow increased almost line-
arly with exercise and was significantly higher at all
stages of exertion by comparison with the corre-
sponding pre-PCI measurements. This was due to a
large fall in stenosis resistance and a corresponding
increase in microcirculatory resistance at rest. These
physiological adaptations following PCI restored the
coronary vessel to its primary role as a conduit (15)
and also restored the capacity of the downstream
microcirculatory
bed
to
progressively
vasodilate
during exercise.
Exercise
coronary
pressures,
too,
showed
a
different pattern after PCI than before. Distal coro-
nary pressure is effectively the pressure perfusing the
coronary bed (14). Before PCI, distal coronary pres-
sure was low at rest, rose slightly during early exer-
cise,
but
actually
fell
again
at
peak-exercise,
culminating in hypoperfusion of the coronary bed.
The fall in distal coronary pressure before PCI may
have been the result of the concomitant fall in aortic
driving pressure that was also observed. After PCI,
distal coronary pressure started higher, rose slightly,
and then was maintained. This is consistent with
normalization of the coronary perfusion response to
exercise.
PCI
AND
CHANGES
IN
THE
MICROCIRCULATORY
RESPONSE
TO
EXERCISE. In
health,
the
large
increase in coronary flow necessary during physical
exercise is achieved predominantly by a large fall in
microvascular resistance (16). When there is a hemo-
dynamically significant coronary stenosis, lowering
distal coronary pressure, this process of vasodilata-
tion is enacted even at rest. This homeostatic mech-
anism, termed coronary autoregulation (17,18), allows
perfusion to be adequate at rest despite a large ste-
nosis resistance in the resting state. During exercise,
however, because this microcirculatory vasodilata-
tion has already been exhausted to maintain resting
coronary flow, there is little remaining capacity to
vasodilate to accommodate the necessary increase in
flow.
PCI eliminates the stenosis resistance and thereby
eliminates the need for microcirculatory vasodilator
capacity to be consumed at rest. As shown in Figure 6,
the resting diastolic microcirculatory resistance is
higher than before PCI. It decreases progressively

 with exercise, and by peak exercise, it has fallen to
the same level as pre-PCI peak exercise. This suggests
that the microcirculation is not inherently affected by
PCI, but that PCI restores the conduit function of the
epicardial artery so that the microcirculatory vaso-
dilatory capacity can be reserved for use during
exercise.
Whether the stimulus to increase coronary flow is
pharmacological
vasodilatation
or
the
increased
myocardial demand from physical exercise, if part of
the
microcirculatory
vasodilatory
capacity
has
already been used to maintain resting coronary flow,
then less vasodilator capacity remains to further in-
crease flow. This mechanism also explains the low
CFR observed in our patients before PCI that was
subsequently restored to normal following stenting.
EFFECT
OF
PCI
ON
SYSTEMIC
HEMODYNAMIC
RESPONSES TO EXERCISE. During physical exercise,
heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and ventricular
contractility normally increase (14). In our patients
before PCI, at peak exercise there was a reversal of
this pattern with a fall in blood pressure and heart
rate, and therefore in the RPP. This may be a sys-
temic manifestation of an inability of myocardial
perfusion to increase adequately in the territory
subtended by the stenosed artery. In support of this
interpretation, after PCI, at the identical level of
exercise, the blood pressure and RPP were signifi-
cantly higher.
Pulse wave analysis of aortic pressure waveforms
during exercise did not reveal any significant differ-
ences before versus after PCI. This is in contrast with
the findings of previous catheter laboratory exercise
studies investigating the warm-up angina phenome-
non (5) and the physiological effect of sublingual
nitroglycerin
in
patients
with
stable
angina
(7).
Within those studies, in the absence of PCI, signifi-
cant lowering of afterload, the tension time index,
and the Buckberg index was observed on repeat

 exercise. Such findings indicate that with a stenosis
remaining in situ, the primary adaptive measures to
reduce
ischemia
during
repeat
exercise
are
the
enhancement of subendocardial perfusion and the
down-regulation of myocardial oxygen demand (5).
Conversely, in the present study, where PCI was
performed, restoration of normal coronary blood flow
during exercise was the overwhelming therapeutic
hemodynamic
alteration.
Accordingly,
within
our
study, transmural redistribution of perfusion was not
observed on repeat exercise; and an increase rather
than
decrease
in
myocardial
workload
was
demonstrated.
PCI
AND
CHANGES
IN
CORONARY-CARDIAC
INTERACTION
DURING
EXERCISE. Coronary
WIA
permits additional insights into coronary blood flow
dynamics during exercise by accounting for the in-
fluence of extravascular forces on flow (19). The 2
waves that accelerate flow are the backward expan-
sion wave that occurs in diastole, and the forward
compression wave that occurs in systole (8). It has
previously
been
reported
that
these
2
waves
contribute over 90% of the energy accelerating coro-
nary blood flow (8).
Pre-PCI in the resting state, the BEW was the major
contributor
to
total
accelerating
wave
energy.
Although speculative, this finding may be explained
by the same coronary autoregulatory process that
resulted in a lower diastolic myocardial resistance at
rest. When resistance is low, diastolic suction forces
are high and the BEW is increased. Conversely, post-
PCI in the resting state, the FCW contributed more
to total accelerating wave energy at rest. This may be
the result of both a higher DMR at rest (and thus
lessened
diastolic
suction)
coupled
with
more
effective
transmission
of
left
ventricular
systolic
accelerating
forces
into
the
coronary
circulation
following PCI.
At peak exercise, total accelerating wave energy
was higher following PCI than before. The absolute
magnitude of BEW energy was similar at peak ex-
ercise both before and after PCI. Again, although
speculative, this finding may be attributed to the
similar minimal diastolic microvascular resistance
values (and thus, similar maximal degree of micro-
vascular suction) that were observed. The absolute
magnitude of FCW energy was higher at peak ex-
ercise after versus before PCI. This is suggestive
that the increase in peak exercise total accelerating
wave energy post-PCI may be the result of more
effective
transmission
of
ventricular
originating
systolic forces into the coronary circulation during
exercise.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS. These data demonstrate
that PCI immediately normalizes the physiological
response to exercise in coronary, microcirculatory,
and systemic circulations. These beneficial adapta-
tions were associated with a large improvement in
patient symptoms and exercise tolerance; however,
the patient was unblinded to the fact they had
received
PCI.
Although
this
is
analogous
with
everyday
clinical
practice
(i.e.,
every
patient
is
aware they have received a stent), the results of the
recently reported ORBITA trial clearly indicate that
there is also a placebo effect associated with un-
dergoing PCI.
As clinicians, we should feel confident about the
biological plausibility of PCI as an effective therapy
for the relief of angina; however, we should also be
aware
that
patients
also
gain
some
functional
improvement from placebo. Therefore, we should
take
the
opportunity
of
the
PCI
procedure
to
emphasize to the patient how effective the PCI has
been, both anatomically and physiologically. Such

 steps are already commonly performed by some
operators
(for
example,
by
showing
the
patient
the
pre-
and
post-PCI
angiogram
images
as
a
demonstration of the anatomic success of the pro-
cedure). We speculate that in addition to enhancing
overall patient education, simple steps such as these
would maximize the overall therapeutic benefit of
PCI in stable angina.
STUDY
LIMITATIONS. This
study
addressed
only
single-vessel disease and only cases with sufficiently
focal lesions that there was good expectation of full
resolution by stenting. Accordingly, this represents a
highly selected group of patients. General clinical
practice covers a much wider variety of disease
anatomy. It is not known how multivessel disease or
multivessel PCI might fair in such a study. The
advantage of discrete single-vessel disease is that the
anatomy and physiology have a good chance of being
normalized by the PCI.
Our study only enrolled patients who would be
able to exercise on a supine bicycle. This meant that
more
frail
individuals
were
not
eligible.
It
also
meant that if the operator needed to carry out
femoral access, the patient could not conduct the
protocol. Furthermore, owing to the potential for
(unmeasured) myocardial stunning or hibernation
immediately post-PCI, the improvement in func-
tional capacity demonstrated in our study may be an
underestimation
of
the
longer-term
therapeutic
effect.
This multicenter study was designed to detect
physiological changes as continuous variables and
not count events as binary digits. By collecting more
items of information per patient, the number of
patients needed to answer a question is smaller in
this type of study than in event-counting studies.
However, owing to the relatively small number of
patients, we may be statistically underpowered to
address additional questions such as whether the
improvement in functional capacity was significantly
greater in LAD versus non-LAD territories (Online
Figure 3).
All our patients received intracoronary nitroglyc-
erin before diagnostic angiography and all physio-
logical
measurements.
Intracoronary
nitroglycerin
was necessary to stabilize epicardial tone during
physiological assessment and also to ensure accurate
vessel sizing in preparation for PCI. We do not know
what the results would have been if they had not had
this.
We did not measure reproducibility of supine ex-
ercise in our patients. This was in order to minimize
the burden on patients participating in the study, as
well as the significant time burden imposed on busy
clinical catheter laboratory lists. Our reason to believe
that the supine exercise test might have satisfactory
reproducibility is that before this study began, we ran
a pilot study of paired supine exercise tests 30 min
apart with healthy controls who were blinded to time
during exercise. This pilot phase suggested satisfac-
tory
reproducibility,
with
mean
difference
of
just �6.9 s and a standard deviation of difference of
32 s (Online Figure 4).
Consistent with real-world clinical practice, this
study did not blind patients to the presence of PCI.
Accordingly, blinding of exercise testing to time
(i.e., pre-PCI versus post-PCI) was absent. There-
fore, we must bear in mind that any subjectively
reported
reduction
in
symptoms
and
objectively
observed increase in exercise capacity is mediated
by a combination of the physical and psychological
effects of PCI, the latter of which may be particu-
larly prone to bias. The reason that we did not
blind patients in this study is that the blinding
protocol in ORBITA (which was enrolling concur-
rently)
necessitated
sedation
for
allocation
concealment, and this would have impaired exer-
cise performance.
Lastly, this study did not include a control group of
patients (i.e., those who exercised twice, but without
intervening PCI). A study of this kind has previously
been
performed
by
Lockie
et
al.
(5)
in
their
investigation of the warm-up angina phenomenon.
Accordingly, the hemodynamic and functional im-
provements observed post-PCI in the present study
may also be inclusive of an unmeasured warm-up
effect.
CONCLUSIONS
Examining solely objective physiological measures
during physical exercise, PCI for single-vessel SCD
shows clear evidence of meeting all that could be
demanded of a therapy for ischemia. There is imme-
diate normalization of the pattern of exercise-induced
changes; in coronary pressure, flow, resistance, and
wave intensity; in systemic blood pressure, heart rate,
and RPP; and in the microcirculatory vasodilator
reserve to physical exercise.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: In
patients with stable single-vessel coronary disease, PCI
reduces ischemia and restores a normal hemodynamic
response to exercise.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Future controlled
experimental studies should assess the impact of percu-
taneous revascularization on exercise hemodynamics in
patients with other patterns of ischemic heart disease.
