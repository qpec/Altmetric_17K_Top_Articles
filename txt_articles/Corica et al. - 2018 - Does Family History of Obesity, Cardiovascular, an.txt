Objectives: The objectives were to evaluate (1) the metabolic profile and cardiometa-
bolic risk in overweight/obese children at first assessment, stratifying patients accord-
ing to severity of overweight and age; and (2) to investigate the relationship between 
family history (FH) for obesity and cardiometabolic diseases and severity of childhood 
obesity.
Methods: In this cross-sectional, retrospective, observational study, 260 children (139 
female), aged between 2.4 and 17.2 years, with overweight and obesity were recruited. 
Data regarding FH for obesity and cardiometabolic diseases were collected. Each 
patient underwent clinical and auxological examination and fasting blood sampling for 
metabolic profile. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), 
triglyceride-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, and atherogenic index of 
plasma were calculated. To evaluate the severity of obesity, children were divided into 
two groups for BMI standard deviation (SD) ≤2.5 and BMI SD >2.5. Moreover, study 
population was analyzed, dividing it into three groups based on the chronological age 
of patient (<8, 8–11, >11 years).
results: BMI SD was negatively correlated with chronological age (p < 0.005) and 
significantly higher in the group of children <8 years. BMI SD was positively associated 
with FH for obesity. Patients with more severe obesity (BMI SD >2.5) were younger 
(p < 0.005), mostly prepubertal, presented a significantly higher HOMA-IR (p = 0.04), 
and had a significantly higher prevalence of FH for arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, and coronary heart disease than the other group.
conclusion: (1) Family history of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases are important 
risk factors for precocious obesity onset in childhood and are related to the severity of 
obesity. (2) Metabolic profile, especially HOMA-IR, is altered even among the youngest 
obese children at first evaluation. (3) Stratification of obesity severity, using BMI SD, is 
effective to estimate the cardiometabolic risk of patients.

Precocious Onset of ChO and IR

Childhood obesity (ChO) is one of the major public health issues 
worldwide and is known to be associated with an increased risk 
of severe long-term complications in adulthood (1–3). Obese 
children have a greater risk of developing arterial hypertension 
(AH), dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resist-
ance (IR) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and precocious 
atherosclerosis (4–6). Long-term prediction of cardiometabolic 
risk is strictly conditioned by the severity of obesity (7).
BMI has been correlated with total body fat and cardiovas-
cular risk factors (8); therefore, it would appear useful to evalu-
ate the degree of obesity in the clinical setting. Furthermore, 
several metabolic and inflammatory factors are involved in 
the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and metabolic risk in 
obese children. IR is an important link between obesity and 
associated cardiovascular and metabolic risk (9). Triglyceride-
to-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL 
ratio) (10) and the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) (11) may 
be associated to cardiovascular risk in ChO; however, only few 
papers have evaluated these parameters in children.
Aims of our cross-sectional, retrospective, observational study 
were (1) to evaluate, at first assessment, metabolic profile and car-
diometabolic risk in overweight/obese children, stratifying them 
according to the severity of overweight and age; (2) to investigate 
the relationship between family history (FH) for obesity and 
cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and severity of ChO.
MaTerials anD MeThODs
subjects
Two hundred and sixty overweight and obese children and ado-
lescents (139 female), aged between 2.4 and 17.2 years, referred 
by their family pediatrician, were admitted to the Pediatric 
Endocrinology Outpatient Clinic at the University of Messina, 
from January 2010 to December 2013. Analysis of data was carried 
out retrospectively and completely anonymously. Retrospective 
analysis of data was notified to the Ethics Committee.
The inclusion criteria for the present study were chronological 
age between 2 and 18 years, BMI SD >2 from 2 to 5 years (12), 
and BMI SD >1 over 5 years of age corrected for sex (13), born 
as healthy full-term infant adequate for gestational age, blood 
pressure within normal range corrected for age. Exclusion cri-
teria were genetic and endocrinological causes of obesity, born 
as preterm or postterm, diagnosis of chronic diseases, chronic 
therapies, and smoking.
Methods
Detailed history from the parents and from clinical records and 
family pediatrician data was obtained. Data on FH for obesity, 
AH, T2DM, dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease (CHD) in par-
ents, siblings, and grandparents were also collected. The following 
measurements were obtained with standard methods: height, 
weight, and BMI. Body weight was determined to the nearest 
0.1 kg on accurate and properly calibrated standard beam scales, 
in minimal underclothes and no shoes. Height was measured to 
the nearest 0.1 cm on standardized, wall-mounted height boards, 
according to standardized procedures. The children stood with 
the head aligned in the Frankfort plane, barefoot, with feet placed 
together and flat on the ground, heels, buttocks, and scapulae 
against the vertical backboard, arms loose and relaxed with the 
palms facing medially. BMI was calculated using the equation: 
body weight (kg)/height (m)2. We considered BMI >2.5 SD 
(>99th percentile corrected for age and sex) to define severe obe-
sity (14). The subjects underwent a detailed physical examination 
and pubertal evaluation, assessed by five Tanner stages of breast 
development in girls and testicular volume in boys (15), per-
formed by pediatric endocrinologists. A fasting blood sampling 
for plasma triglycerides, HDL, low-density lipoproteins (LDL), 
total cholesterol, glucose, and insulin was performed at least 8 h 
after the last meal. These parameters were analyzed with stand-
ard techniques: triglycerides were measured enzymatically, the 
HDL-cholesterol fraction was obtained after precipitation using a 
phosphotungistic reagent, glucose was measured using a glucose 
oxidase method; serum insulin was determined by a chemilu-
minescence immunoassay. We considered abnormal levels of tri-
glycerides, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL as defined by the National 
Cholesterol Education Panel (14): total cholesterol >170 mg/dl, 
LDL >130 mg/dl, HDL <40 mg/dl, triglycerides >110 mg/dl. 
We considered abnormal fasting glucose >100 mg/dl and fasting 
insulin >15 μUI/ml. IR was measured through homeostasis model 
assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). This index was 
calculated using the equation: fasting insulin (μU/ml) × fasting 
glucose (mg/dl)/405 (16). AIP was calculated using the equation: 
[LOG (triglycerides/HDL cholesterol)] (17). We considered the 
following cutoffs to define the three indices of cardiometabolic 
risk as abnormal: HOMA-IR >2.5 (16), AIP >0.11 (17), and TG/
HDL ratio >1.25 (18). This study was carried out in accordance 
with the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki.
statistical analysis
Numerical data are expressed as mean and standard deviation 
(SD) and categorical variables as numbers and percentages. Most 
of the examined variables were normally distributed as verified 
by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test; consequently, the parametric 
approach was used. In order to compare the two groups (BMI 
SD ≤2.5 vs BMI SD >2.5) with reference to categorical variables, 
the chi-squared test was applied; with reference to numerical 
parameters, Student’s t-test was estimated. Some univariate linear 
regression models were estimated to assess the possible depend-
ence of BMI SD on some potential explicative variables, such as 
chronological age, sex, FH for obesity, T2DM, AH, dyslipidemia, 
CHD, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, HOMA-IR, AIP, or TG/HDL 
ratio. A stepwise multivariate regression model was estimated to 
identify the most significant predictors of BMI SD. To evaluate 
the distribution of BMI SD, according to familial risk categories, 
Student’s t-test was estimated. Some univariate logistic regres-
sion models were estimated to verify the possible dependence 
of dichotomous variables, such as HOMA-IR (<2.5 and ≥2.5), 
AIP (<0.11 and ≥0.11), and TG/HDL ratio (<1.25 and ≥1.25), 
on some potential explicative variables such as age, sex, FH for 
obesity, T2DM, AH, dyslipidemia, CHD, total cholesterol, LDL, 
HDL, and HOMA-IR, AIP, or TG/HDL ratio, respectively. For

each parameter, a stepwise multivariate logistic regression model 
was estimated to identify the most significant predictors.
Furthermore, the whole population was stratified into three 
groups based on age of patients, and numerically balanced: group 
1 (<8 years), group 2 (8–11 years), and group 3 (>11 years). 
Differences among these strata were evaluated by ANOVA (for 
numerical parameters) and chi-squared test (for categorical vari-
ables). For only variables that significantly differ in comparison 
among three groups, the pairwise comparisons were performed, 
using Student’s t-test (for numerical parameters) and chi-squared 
test (for categorical variables); in this context, we applied the 
Bonferroni correction to control the multiplicity effect.
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 for 
Window package. P < 0.050 two-sided was considered to be 
statistically significant.
resUlTs
The mean age of study participants was 9.2 ± 2.9 years. One hun-
dred and thirty-nine subjects (53.4%) were female. One hundred 
and sixty-one subjects (61.9%) were prepubertal. FH for obesity, 
T2DM, AH, dyslipidemia, CHD in parents, siblings, and grand-
parents was positive in 196 subjects (75.4%). The mean values of 
BMI and BMI SD were 29.7 ± 4.6 and 2.6 ± 0.5 SD, respectively.
laboratory Parameters
Total cholesterol >170 mg/dl was seen in 105 patients (40.4%), 
 
and in 29 subjects (11.2%), it was >200 mg/dl. LDL was >130 mg/dl 
in 30 subjects (11.5%); triglycerides were >110 mg/dl in 37 children 
(14.2%). HDL was <40 mg/dl in 40 children (15.3%). The mean 
value of TG/HDL ratio was 1.7 ± 0.84. TG/HDL ratio was >1.25 in 
166 subjects (63.8%). The mean value of AIP was −0.18 ± 0.2; AIP 
was >0.11 only in 14 patients (5.4%). Twenty-nine patients had 
fasting blood glucose >100 mg/dl; those subjects underwent an 
oral glucose tolerance test that excluded diabetes and confirmed a 
condition of impaired glucose tolerance. Fasting insulin was >15 
μUI/ml in 88 children (33.8%). None of the patients received a 
diagnosis of metabolic syndrome according to Weiss et al. criteria 
(19). The mean value of HOMA-IR was 3 ± 2.1. Considering 
children divided for HOMA-IR <2.5 or ≥2.5, HOMA-IR ≥2.5 was 
positively correlated with age of patients (p < 0.05), triglycerides 
(p < 0.05), AIP (p < 0.05), and TG/HDL ratio (p = 0.02).
evaluation according to bMi sD
BMI SD was negatively correlated with age of patients (p < 0.005). 
A negative association between BMI SD and age of patient was 
confirmed by univariate linear regression analysis (p < 0.005) and 
by stepwise multivariate regression analysis (p < 0.005). Moreover, 
a positive association between BMI SD and FH for obesity was 
demonstrated by univariate linear regression analysis (p = 0.002) 
and by stepwise multivariate regression analysis (p = 0.007).
Furthermore, the evaluation of BMI SD distribution accord-
ing to familial risk categories confirmed a significantly higher 
BMI SD among children with a positive FH for obesity and for 
dyslipidemia (Table 1).
To evaluate FH, clinical characteristics, and metabolic pro-
file according to the severity of obesity, children were divided 
into two groups with BMI SD ranging from >2 to ≤2.5 (group 
A, median 2.3) and from >2.5 to 5.2 (group B, median 2.7), 
respectively. Detailed results concerning the two groups are 
presented in Table 2. Patients of group B were significantly 
younger than of group A, and most of them were prepubertal. 
Furthermore, children of group B had a significantly higher 
positive FH for T2DM, AH, and CHD and a significantly 
higher mean value of fasting insulin and HOMA-IR compared 
to those of group A. Other parameters did not present signifi-
cant differences between groups (Table 2). Univariate logistic 
regression analysis showed a negative association between 
BMI SD >2.5 and age of patients (p < 0.005), and a positive 
association among BMI SD >2.5 and FH for AH (p = 0.02), 
FH for T2DM (p = 0.003), and HOMA-IR (p = 0.046). These 
associations were confirmed by stepwise multivariate logistic 
regression analysis (Table 3).

evaluation according to age subgroups
To verify the precocious incidence of obesity and metabolic 
complications related to obesity, we divided our population into 
three groups, numerically balanced, according to age of patients: 
group 1 (<8 years; 86 subjects), group 2 (8–11 years; 102 sub-
jects), group 3 (>11 years; 72 subjects). In Table 4, the results 
obtained from group comparisons for both categorical variables 
and numerical parameters are reported. The pairwise compari-
sons demonstrated significant differences in BMI SD and BMI 
SD >2.5, and in fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-IR ≥2.5, 
reported in Table 5.
DiscUssiOn
In our observational, cross-sectional, retrospective study, we 
analyzed a large cohort of children with simple overweight and 
obesity, included in a wide range of ages, brought to our outpa-
tient clinic for first evaluation.
The main findings of this study are the more severe obesity in 
younger children and the relationship between FH for obesity, 
cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases and the severity of obesity. 
Our findings suggest that the problem of ChO is not only related 
to an increase in the number of diagnoses among children but 
also concerns an earlier insurgence of obesity.
Furthermore, we suggest that FH for obesity, AH, T2DM, dys-
lipidemia, and CHD should be considered risk factors for early onset 
and a major severity of obesity in children. The findings that FH for 
obesity significantly increases the risk of ChO have been consist-
ently reported in other studies (20–24). This association is likely the 
result of a combination of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms and 
environmental factors, such as shared family lifestyle characteristics.
Our results support the role of FH for obesity, suggesting also 
the involvement of FH for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases 
in determining ChO.
In this context, family pediatricians, aware of familiar risk 
factors for early onset of ChO, play a primary role in identifying 
children’s overweight in a precocious phase, to start prevention 
programs. Moreover, although prevention remains the first target 
in ChO management, pediatricians should focus on the early 
identification of obesity-associated complications, which may 
already occur precociously in children.
Early onset of severe obesity increases the risk of long-term 
obesity, cardiovascular, and metabolic complications (1, 2, 7, 25).

Precocious Onset of ChO and IR

Overweight and obesity from childhood to adulthood have 
been related to an increased risk of T2DM, AH, dyslipidemia, 
and carotid-artery atherosclerosis. However, it has been 
reported that in subjects who were overweight or obese in 
childhood, but had normal weight in adulthood, cardiovascu-
lar risk in adulthood is comparable to the general population 
(4). Therefore, an early, multidisciplinary approach (pediatric, 
endocrinological, nutritional) in overweight and obese children 
is necessary to reduce the development of cardiovascular and 
metabolic complications. IR, previously considered a problem 
in adulthood, becomes a serious issue also in children. In a 
cohort of preschool children, Aristizabal et al. reported IR as 
the most frequent metabolic alteration, supporting the use of 
BMI to identify children with IR (26). Also in our population, 
BMI was an efficacious screening method, easy for routine use, 
to identify children at risk of early obesity complications. IR 
represents an important link between obesity and associated 
cardiovascular risk (9) and has been indicated as one of the 
first mechanisms involved in the development of endothelial 
dysfunction in obese youths (5). Giannini et al. showed that 
early changes in glucose metabolism, detected in obese pre-
pubertal children, could be one of the factors leading to the 
increase of intima media thickness (5). Moreover, IR has been 
related to the metabolic syndrome incidence in childhood. 
Weiss et al. demonstrated the association between the severity 
of obesity and the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome, and the 
negative effect of obesity worsening on each component of the 
metabolic syndrome (19). In our cohort, HOMA-IR was abnor-
mal in 51.9% of participants, significantly higher among those 
with the most severe obesity, despite them being younger and 
 
mainly prepubertal.
Furthermore, it is suggested that IR influences the link between 
obesity and dyslipidemia. Vukovic et al. demonstrated that 
HOMA-IR was strictly related to lipid profile in their pediatric 
population (27). Giannini et al. reported a correlation between 
IR and TG/HDL ratio (5). In our cohort, we demonstrated a cor-
relation between HOMA-IR and lipid profile, in particular with 
triglycerides, AIP, and TG/HDL ratio. Recently, the importance 
of TG/HDL ratio as a marker of cardiovascular risk and inflam-
matory status in children has been demonstrated (10). TG/HDL 
ratio was frequently abnormal among our patients, even if a 
significant difference according to the severity of obesity has not 
been demonstrated. TG/HDL ratio is an easily calculated marker, 
useful in monitoring obese children at risk of metabolic compli-
cations. AIP, considered a new marker of atherogenicity, has been 
shown to significantly correlate with cardiovascular disease and 
metabolic syndrome in adulthood (28); however, it has been little 
studied in children. Vrablik et al. demonstrated the correlation of 
AIP with BMI and HOMA-IR in children (11). Conversely, we 
did not confirm these data in our patients, among whom only in 
few cases was AIP abnormal.
Some limitations of this study need to be acknowledged. In 
particular, socioeconomic factors have not been considered. 
Waist circumference was not systematically evaluated during 
the assessment; therefore, we were not able to estimate the 
incidence of metabolic syndrome in comparison with other 
pediatric diagnostic criteria (29), other than Weiss et al. criteria 
(19). In addition, our cohort of patients comes from southern 
Italy, which may limit the generalization of results; on the other 
hand, our population represents a sample with homogeneous 
features.
To summarize, we suggest the importance of adopting pre-
vention programs to contrast ChO development and, when ChO 
is already diagnosed, start an early multidisciplinary medical 
approach in these children, who, even if so young, may already 
show the first signs of metabolic disorders, possible preluding 
cardiovascular and metabolic disease development in young 
adulthood.
We conclude that (1) an FH for obesity, AH, T2DM, or CHD 
is an important risk factor for precocious obesity onset in child-
hood and influences the severity of obesity; (2) metabolic profile, 
especially HOMA-IR, is altered even among the youngest obese 
children at first evaluation; (3) stratification of the severity of 
obesity, using BMI SD, is effective to estimate the cardiometabolic 
risk of patients and to program a specific and multidisciplinary 
follow-up for each patient.
