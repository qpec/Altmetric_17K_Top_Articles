A fundamental mystery for dengue and other infectious pathogens is how observed
patterns of cases relate to actual chains of individual transmission events. These pathways
are intimately tied to the mechanisms by which strains interact and compete across spatial
scales. Phylogeographic methods have been used to characterize pathogen dispersal at
global and regional scales but have yielded few insights into the local spatiotemporal
structure of endemic transmission. Using geolocated genotype (800 cases) and serotype
(17,291 cases) data, we show that in Bangkok, Thailand, 60% of dengue cases living
<200 meters apart come from the same transmission chain, as opposed to 3% of cases
separated by 1 to 5 kilometers. At distances <200 meters from a case (encompassing an
average of 1300 people in Bangkok), the effective number of chains is 1.7. This number
rises by a factor of 7 for each 10-fold increase in the population of the “enclosed” region.
This trend is observed regardless of whether population density or area increases, though
increases in density over 7000 people per square kilometer do not lead to additional
chains. Within Thailand these chains quickly mix, and by the next dengue season viral
lineages are no longer highly spatially structured within the country. In contrast, viral flow
to neighboring countries is limited. These findings are consistent with local, density-
dependent transmission and implicate densely populated communities as key sources of
viral diversity, with home location the focal point of transmission. These findings have
important implications for targeted vector control and active surveillance.
M
icroscale transmission dynamics and the
resulting competitive interactions between
strains drive the distribution of infectious
diseases in populations. In the past, phylo-
geographic methods have been used to
characterize pathogen dispersal at both regional
and global scales, but these methods have pro-
vided few insights into the local spatiotemporal
structure of endemic transmission (1–6). Den-
gue virus is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus
grouped into four serotypes (DENV1 to DENV4).
Dengue viruses infect more than 300 million
people annually, cause more than 20,000 deaths,
and have circulated in Southeast Asia for decades
(7, 8). Dengue’s main vector, Aedes aegypti, has a
limited flight range and often remains within the
same household for long periods (9). Dispersal is
driven by the complex interplay of the abundance
of both vectors and humans, their movement,
and population immunity (10–12). The spatial
scale of dispersal of dengue viruses may dictate
the success of local control efforts. The introduc-
tion of novel variants immunity to populations has
been a prime determinant of burden for both
dengue and other viruses (13–16); thus, it is crit-
ical to understand the processes that dictate viral
dispersal. The mystery of how dispersal proceeds
requires linking patterns of disease incidence
to actual pathways of transmission. Pathways
of transmission are, in part, characterized by the
number of independent transmission chains cir-
culating in an area. For example, the number
of introduced versus locally acquired malaria
cases has been used as a metric of endemicity (17).
Characterizing these pathways is a particu-
lar challenge in the study of endemic patho-
gens, for which overlapping transmission chains
result in many unrelated cases appearing in the
same communities at the same time, complicat-
ing efforts to understand how a pathogen is prop-
agated and maintained. Surveillance systems
typically capture a small fraction of infections
(12, 18, 19): It has been estimated that only 12%
of symptomatic dengue infections are captured
in Thailand, and up to three-quarters of infec-
tions are asymptomatic (19, 20). In such settings,
phylogenetic approaches can reveal information
about the number of circulating chains and the
relationship between chains at different spatio-
temporal scales and may allow us to investigate
key unanswered questions in the epidemiology
of endemic pathogens.
We sequenced the viruses of 640 geolocated
dengue infections that occurred from 1994 to
2010 in Bangkok and five other locations through-
out Thailand (Fig. 1, A and B, figs. S1 to S4,
tables S1 to S3) and then combined these with
160 GenBank sequences from elsewhere in South-
east Asia. In addition, we geolocated 17,291 hos-
pitalized cases of dengue where the infecting
serotype was known. Cases from Bangkok came
from a children’s hospital; patients had a median
age of 8 years [interquartile range (IQR): 5 to
11 years]. The cases from outside Bangkok came
from tertiary care hospitals; patients had a me-
dian age of 10 years (IQR: 7 to 13 years). Ap-
proximately half of the patients were female in
both settings (table S4). We developed two sep-
arate methods to estimate the number of circu-
lating transmission chains (i.e., cases separated
by a low number of intervening transmission
events) at different spatial scales using sequence
data and serotype data. Here we evaluate the ef-
fect of individual characteristics (such as age and
sex) on the probability of observing cases from
the same chain around the residence of a case
(21). In addition, we demonstrate how local pop-
ulation density plays a critical role in dictating
the number of locally circulating chains and,
using microsimulation models, recreate the ob-
served patterns. Finally, we describe dengue’s
spread across spatial scales (neighborhood, city,
national, and regional), both within a season and
across seasons (we consider two cases to come
from the same season if symptom onset for one
case occurred within 6 months of the other).
To determine the evolutionary time between
each pair of viruses, we built serotype-specific
time-resolved Bayesian phylogenetic trees (Fig.
1, C to F). We used a combination of bootstrap-
ping observations and sampling trees from the
posterior to capture sampling and tree uncer-
tainty. Within Bangkok, we find a strong linear
relationship between the evolutionary time be-
tween viruses and the spatial distance separating
the homes of the cases from which they were iso-
lated for up to 1.5 years (<27 transmission events)
of evolutionary separation (Fig. 1G). The median
spatial distance between pairs of cases separated
by <6 months (<9 transmission events) was 670 m
[95% confidence interval (CI): 560 to 1250 m].

 Lineages appear to persist in the local vicinity
of a case for up to 6 months. Homotypic (i.e.,
caused by the same serotype) cases with symp-
tom onset occurring within the same season and
living within 200 m of each other have an 82%
chance of having a most recent common ances-
tor (MRCA) in the prior 6 months (versus 46%
in the prior 3 months and 7% in the prior 6 to
24 months) (fig. S5). Cases separated by more
than 2 km have a 1% chance of having a MRCA
in the prior 6 months (versus 0.4% in the prior
3 months and 6% in the prior 6 to 24 months).
We therefore consider pairs of cases with symp-
tom onset within the same season to be from
the same transmission chain if their MRCA
was within 6 months of the case with the ear-
lier onset.
We find that 60% (95% CI: 33 to 73%) of case
pairs separated by <200 m in Bangkok were
from the same transmission chain, regardless
of serotype. This decreases to 19% (95% CI: 11
to 26%) for those <1 km apart (Fig. 2A). These
results are robust to broader definitions of what
constitutes a transmission chain (i.e., using differ-
ent MRCA cutoffs) (fig. S6). The rapid, distance-
associated decrease in the probability of being
part of the same chain provides evidence for
focal transmission—that is, sequential transmis-
sions typically occur between households in the
same neighborhood (22–24). This is consistent with
empirical measurements of human movement
having shown that people spend most of their
time within a few kilometers of their homes and
the limited flight range of the vector (9, 25–27).

 Although some infection events certainly occur
far from a person’s home, the tight relationship
between genetic and spatial distances suggests
that the majority of infection events occur near
the home. This is further supported by a signif-
icant relation with age, with the youngest, and
presumably least mobile, individuals (those aged
<5 years) having a 30% greater probability than
older children (>10 years old) of being from the
same chain as cases <500 m from their home
(95% CI: 16 to 41%) (Fig. 2D). Compared with
males, females were also slightly more likely to
share a transmission chain with those nearby
(Fig. 2E). The apparent focal nature of trans-
mission elucidates the mechanism by which in-
creased susceptibility to severe disease after future
infection with heterotypic serotypes might cluster
spatially (23). If vaccination functions like a sin-
gle dengue infection, the spatial scale of likely
“priming” infections could tell us where indi-
viduals who would benefit from vaccination are
most likely to be located (though operationaliz-
ing such a strategy may be impractical) (28).
To extend our methods to settings where se-
quence data are unavailable, we developed an
approach using only serotype data to indepen-
dently estimate the probability of pairs of cases
being from the same transmission chain. We
calculate the probability of cases being from the
same chain as the excess probability of two cases
occurring within some distance of each other
during the same season being homotypic com-
pared with the probability of two unrelated cases
being homotypic (Fig. 2, A and B). Cases within a
season are assumed to be unrelated if they are
separated by >10 km, the distance over which
the probability of being homotypic remains con-
stant (Fig. 2C and fig. S7). The results of the
serotype-based analysis were nearly identical
to those of the sequence-based analysis (Fig. 2,
A and B).
We define the reciprocal of the probability
that a pair of cases are from the same chain
within a particular spatial distance as the effec-
tive number of transmission chains circulating
within that distance. The effective number of
chains represents a theoretical measure of the
size of the pool of chains that any pair of cases
within a given distance of each other are drawing
from. For a sufficiently large population, this is
a lower limit on the true number of chains within
a particular distance of a case (21). In Bangkok, a
mean of 1300 people live within 200 m of a case,
and we find that, on average, 1.7 chains (95% CI:
1.4 to 3.0 chains) circulate in this population
within a season. There is a linear relation be-
tween the logarithm of population size and the
logarithm of the effective number of chains (Fig.
3A), with some deviation at small population
sizes. In all of Bangkok, we estimate that 160
chains (95% CI: 120 to 230 chains) circulate
within a season. Although a similar linear relation
exists between the logarithm of population size
and the logarithm of the effective number of
chains, we find that provinces outside of Bangkok
host fewer chains during a season. A subset of
Bangkok with population size equal to an out-
lying province will host 5.6-fold more chains
(Fig. 3A). This suggests that we will see an in-
crease in the number of chains as rural com-
munities become more connected.
There is substantial heterogeneity in the pop-
ulation density across Bangkok (fig. S8). We
hypothesized that the number of chains within
any location depends solely on the size of the local
population, such that for areas of equal size, in-
creasing population density results in additional
chains. This hypothesis appears to hold up to a
point. In Bangkok, at densities less than 7000
people per square kilometer, the number of chains
circulating in a population of a given size is the
same regardless of the size of the area in which
they live (Fig. 3, B and C). However, at population
densities above 7000 individuals per square kilo-
meter, the number of chains ceases to increase
with population size. This is consistent with mi-
crosimulation models of disease transmission
that include local density-dependent transmis-
sion (i.e., increased transmissibility in denser
areas) but not simulations with spatially ran-
dom or local density-independent transmission
(Fig. 3D and fig. S9). On the basis of results from
our simple modeling framework, we postulate
that ecological interactions between virus strains
in denser areas may limit the number of circu-
lating strains. This could occur through com-
petition for hosts mediated by immunity from
previous infections or other mechanisms (e.g.,
vector avoidance after infection). In our density-
dependent simulations, previously infected indi-
viduals were 10 times more likely to become
reexposed in densely populated areas versus else-
where (fig. S10). Competition between strains
mediated through attempts to infect the same
host or from strain-specific immunity from previ-
ous infections suggests that evolutionary pres-
sures are likely to be strongest in these areas.
High levels of asymptomatic disease and spatial
heterogeneity in health care–seeking behavior
indicate that we will only ever observe a small
proportion of infections and that the proportion
we observe may differ geographically (29). We
use this modeling framework to demonstrate
that our findings are robust to underreporting and
spatially-biased sampling (fig. S11). Further, we
show that simulations cease to have spatial clus-
tering, which is consistent with our observa-
tions when a relatively small proportion (>10%)
of infections occur away from home (fig. S12),
strengthening the case for highly focal dengue
transmission in and around homes.
To better understand the broader geospatial
dynamics of dengue, we compare the relative risk
of infecting strains sharing a MRCA at specific
time intervals for increasing spatial scales, from
within Bangkok to across Southeast Asia. By only
considering virus pairs isolated within a short
time (<6 months) of each other in specific loca-
tions, we minimize the impact of spatial and
temporal sampling biases that can affect phylo-
geographic analyses (figs. S13 and S14) (30).
Bangkok viruses isolated from individuals living
<500 m apart were 99 times (95% CI: 41 to 293)
more likely to share a MRCA within 6 months
of the earlier case compared with two Bangkok
viruses isolated from cases >10 km apart (distal
Bangkok viruses) (Fig. 4A). The probability of
having a recent MRCA drops sharply as the spa-
tial distance between Bangkok viruses increases.
Viral diversity is reduced outside the capital, with
virus pairs sharing an outlying province being

 19 times (95% CI: 2 to 73) more likely to have a
recent MRCA than distal Bangkok viruses. Virus
pairs with one case located in Bangkok and the
other in another province are 0.3 times as likely
to have a recent MRCA compared with Bangkok
distal viruses (95% CI: 0.1 to 1.4). However, after
just a single season (i.e., MRCA between 6 to
24 months) these ratios approach one, which
suggests that viral lineages are well mixed across
Thailand, both within Bangkok and between
provinces (Fig. 4B). The flow of virus across
Thailand’s borders appears to be much more
limited. Our data set contains no virus pairs with
a MRCA within 6 months of the earlier case when
one virus comes from Thailand and another
from elsewhere in Southeast Asia (i.e., Vietnam,
Cambodia, Malaysia, Myanmar, or Singapore). Even
the probability of having a MRCA 2 to 5 years ear-
lier for Bangkok–Southeast Asia pairs is only 0.11
times that for distal Bangkok viruses (95% CI: 0.02
to 0.4). Overall, virus pairs were as likely to be
from across countries (Bangkok–Southeast Asia
pairs) as from distal parts of Bangkok only when
separated by more than 8 years of evolutionary
time (fig. S15) (findings are similar when using
viruses from throughout Thailand; see fig. S16).
These findings provide strong evidence that
Thailand has endemic transmission that has
limited connection to the rest of Southeast Asia.
Thai borders may not be sufficiently porous to
facilitate easy viral movement. In addition, sick
individuals may be less likely to travel interna-
tionally. Recent work has demonstrated high
correlation in dengue incidence throughout the
Southeast Asian region, with peaks during ex-
treme climate years (31). Our findings support
that ecological and environmental similarity, rath-
er than viral flow, determines this synchrony.
By linking the distribution of case occurrence
to the biological and ecological processes (trans-
mission chains and competition) from which the
cases arise, our work moves beyond previous
findings that showed spatial clustering in dengue
cases (23, 24, 32, 33). We also draw connections
between small-scale patterns and larger trends in
dengue dispersal across the region. Further, we
illustrate two independent, robust methods for
revealing the spatial structure of transmission
for endemic disease. Our finding that viral di-
versity increases with host population density
supports a role for large urban settings as sources
of a diverse set of viruses that could be dispersed
elsewhere. The saturation of diversity at high
host densities suggests that these dense areas
may also be regions of intense competition be-
tween viruses, possibly contributing disproportion-
ately to viral evolutionary pressures. For pathogen
systems with multiple strains, our approach to
estimating the number of circulating transmis-
sion chains within a community may provide a
key surveillance tool for detecting changes in
diversity accompanying expansion of particular
types, characterizing differences in fitness be-
tween lineages, or identifying populations that
act as sources of viruses to other populations.
Insights into microscale structure of endemic
transmission are important for building policy-
relevant models of pathogen spread to appro-
priately target interventions. Our results illustrate
that the structure of transmission is consistent
with only certain assumptions about dengue trans-
mission and provide empirical evidence of the
importance of home location in dengue risk, sup-
porting a role for targeted vector control around
the residences of detected cases.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
We would like to recognize funding from National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (grants R01 AI102939-01A1
and R01AI114703-01); the National Science NSF (grant
BCS-1202983); and the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance
and Response System (GEIS), a Division of the Armed
Forces Health Surveillance Center. The funding bodies did not
participate in the design of the study; the collection, analysis,
and interpretation of the data; or the writing of the manuscript.
This study was approved by the ethical review boards of Queen
Sirikit National Institute of Child Health, Walter Reed Army
Institute of Research, and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of
Public Health. Dates of illness and infecting serotype data
were obtained from the results of standard confirmatory testing for
dengue and therefore did not require informed consent. Ethical
approval was obtained for identifying the location of case homes.
Because this is considered personally identifiable information,
individuals interested in gaining access to this data should contact
H.S. to organize obtaining ethical clearance. R Code for the analyses is
available on GitHub (github.com/hsalje/DengueTransmissionChains).
GenBank accession numbers for the newly sequenced viruses
are KY586306 to KY586946. Alignments and phylogenetic
trees are available on TreeBase (purl.org/phylo/treebase/phylows/
study/TB2:S20486). Disclaimer: Material has been reviewed by the
Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. There is no objection
to its presentation and/or publication. The opinions or
