SUMMARY
Anxiety helps us anticipate and assess potential
danger in ambiguous situations [1–3]; however, the
anxiety disorders are the most prevalent class of
psychiatric illness [4–6]. Emotional states are shared
between humans and other animals [7], as observed
by behavioral manifestations [8], physiological re-
sponses [9], and gene conservation [10]. Anxiety
research makes wide use of three rodent behavioral
assays—elevated plus maze, open field, and light/
dark box—that present a choice between sheltered
and exposed regions [11]. Exposure avoidance in
anxiety-related defense behaviors was confirmed to
be a correlate of rodent anxiety by treatment with
known anxiety-altering agents [12–14] and is now
used to characterize anxiety systems. Modeling anx-
iety with a small neurogenetic animal would further
aid the elucidation of its neuronal and molecular ba-
ses. Drosophila neurogenetics research has eluci-
dated the mechanisms of fundamental behaviors
and implicated genes that are often orthologous
across species. In an enclosed arena, flies stay close
to the walls during spontaneous locomotion [15, 16],
a behavior proposed to be related to anxiety [17]. We
tested this hypothesis with manipulations of the
GABA receptor, serotonin signaling, and stress. The
effects of these interventions were strikingly concor-
dant with rodent anxiety, verifying that these behav-
iors report on an anxiety-like state. Application of this
method was able to identify several new fly anxiety
genes. The presence of conserved neurogenetic
pathways in the insect brain identifies Drosophila
as an attractive genetic model for the study of anxiety
and anxiety-related disorders, complementing exist-
ing rodent systems.
RESULTS
Flies Follow the Walls of an Enclosed Chamber
Flies in enclosed chambers spent a large proportion of time near
the walls (Figures 1 and S1) [18, 19]. While flies were able to crawl
on all surfaces—floor, walls, and ceiling (Figure 1A)—cumulative
locomotion traces were strikingly similar to rodent thigmotaxis
data from open fields (Figure 1B) [14]. Flies on all surfaces
were close to the wall, often 3–4 mm away from the center of a
5-mm chamber (Figure S1C). This behavioral feature, but not
locomotion itself, was persistent (Figures S1D–S1F). We termed
this behavior ‘‘wall following’’ (WAFO).
Diazepam Reduces Fly Wall Following
Benzodiazepines reduce anxiety by modulating GABAA recep-
tors [20], and their binding site is evolutionarily conserved [21].
Diazepam reduces anxiety in three important rodent defense
behavior assays: the open field (OF), the elevated plus maze
(EPM), and the light/dark box [11]. In flies, diazepam had a
pronounced effect on fly WAFO at three doses (Figure 1C).
Raw behavioral metrics may have an indirect relationship
to internal state and are not comparable across diverse
experimental systems, for example, between different assays
in distinct species. To contextualize the diazepam result, we
calculated a standardized effect size (Hedges’ g) from the
diazepam-induced WAFO change (Figure 1C, lower panel)
and compared it with a meta-analytic rodent anxiety diazepam
effect size calculated from 382 published rodent experiments
(http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/020701). Diazepam effect sizes in
both systems were comparable (Figure 1D).
Altering d5-HT1B Function Has WAFO Effects that Are
Concordant with Mouse Anxiety
Genetic experiments in mouse previously demonstrated that
deleting and overexpressing the gene for the mammalian
5-HT1A receptor (m5-HT1A) produced moderate effects on
rodent anxiety (http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/020701). Drosophila
has two serotonin class 1 receptor genes with similarity to
m5-HT1A: d5-HT1A and d5-HT1B. The function of these
genes was knocked down in adult flies with lines expressing
RNAi under the control of a warm-induced pan-neuronal
driver, nSyb-Gal4, tub-Gal80ts [22, 23]. Alterations of d5-
HT1A
expression
with
two
RNAi
lines
and
one
cDNA
responder produced only minor changes in WAFO (Figure 2A).
However, the use of RNAi and overexpression to alter levels of
d5-HT1B produced pronounced effects on WAFO (Figure 2B).
These d5-HT1B effect sizes were of a comparable magnitude
to the mouse anxiety effects from m5-HT1A lesions (Figure 2D)
(http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/020701). Control experiments with
warm treatment of control flies had trivial WAFO effects

 (Figures 2A and 2B). We conclude that manipulating d5-HT1B
function influences fly WAFO in ways that parallel the ef-
fects that altering m5-HT1A expression has on mouse defense
behaviors.
Concordant SERT Effects on Fly WAFO and Mouse
Anxiety
Deletion of mSert produces an increase in mouse anxiety (http://
dx.doi.org/10.1101/020701). In flies, reducing dSerT mRNA
levels with either of two RNAi alleles increased WAFO (Figure 2C).
Flies expressing transgenic dSerT at 123 elevated levels (Fig-
ure S2P) had lowered WAFO (g = �0.53; Figure 2E), echoing
the low anxiety observed in mice expressing elevated mSert
(http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/020701). Control, warm-treated flies
underwent no WAFO change (Figure 2C).
Concordant Stress Effects on Fly WAFO and Mouse
Anxiety
Environmental stress drives anxiety [24]. Subjecting flies to heat
shock stress elicited a large WAFO increase (Figure 3A), concor-
dant with the effect of acute pain on rodent anxiety (Figure S3D)
([25];
http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/020701).

WAFO in heat-stressed flies, much as it
did for flies at 25�C (Figures S2Q and
S2R). Physically restraining flies pro-
duced a WAFO increase that was concor-
dant with the anxiogenic effect of restraint
in rodents (Figure S2E) (http://dx.doi.org/
10.1101/020701). Ten
days of
social
isolation stress increased fly WAFO (Fig-
ure S2F), an outcome that is concordant
with isolation’s effect on rodent anxiety
(http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/020701).
The
corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor
1 (CRHR1) is associated with mammalian
stress, and knockout mice have lower
anxiety; the fly homolog is the diuretic
hormone 44 receptor 1 (DH44-R1) [26, 27]. Reducing Dh44-R1
expression (Figure S2O) reduced WAFO (Figure S2K), consistent
with mouse data (http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/020701). Interest-
ingly, Dh44-R1 mRNA levels were dramatically altered by all
three stressors (Figure S4D).
Anxiotropic Manipulations Influence Drosophila Light/
Dark Choice
A second fly shelter/exposure assay with anxiety concordance
would verify that exposure avoidance correlates with fly anxiety.
The rodent light/dark choice assay examines light avoidance
[12]. We used a simple chamber (Figure S3A) to measure
changes in fly light/dark choice in response to anxiety manipula-
tions. Of nine interventions, six (diazepam, d5-HT1B loss of func-
tion, dSerT overexpression, heat, restraint, and social isolation)
had substantial statistical effects that were concordant with ro-
dent anxiety data (Figure S3H). The other three were also direc-
tionally concordant but had modest, non-statistically significant
effects on light/dark choice (d5-HT1B overexpression, dSerT
knockdown, and Dh44-R1 knockdown). These data largely verify
the hypothesis that exposure avoidance measures a fly anxiety
state.

 Effects in Drosophila WAFO and Light/Dark Choice Are
Predictive of Rodent Anxiety Effects
Fly and rodent effect sizes for all interventions were subjected
to cross-species linear regression. The regression models
indicated that fly DWAFO data are largely predictive of rodent
anxiety changes (R2
adj = 0.77 95% confidence interval [95 CI
0.47, 0.75]), as are the fly Dlight/dark choice outcomes
(R2
adj = 0.81 [95 CI 0.58, 0.82]; Figures 3A and 3D). These
results are compatible with the hypothesis that fly WAFO and
fly light/dark choice, like rodent anxiety assays, test an anxi-
ety-related brain state.
Fly Defense Behaviors Are Distinct from Motor Activity
Motor activity and anxiety behavior are related phenotypes.
Tranquilizers like diazepam also have sedative effects, and
such overlap might also apply to neurogenetic systems. If
WAFO and/or light/dark choice changes were purely a result of
speed changes, this would erode confidence in their specificity
to anxiety. However, this was not the case. Walking speed was
altered in ways that were dissociated from WAFO (Figures
S1F, S2A–S2C, and S2H–S2K). Individual flies’ WAFO metrics
were poorly correlated with ‘‘raw’’ walking speed (WAFO-
locomotion R2
adj = 0.18 [95 CI 0.17, 0.19], p = 1.0 3 10�91,
n = 2,046), as were their light/dark preferences (shade prefer-
ence-locomotion R2
adj = 0.05 [95 CI 0.04, 0.06], p = 1.0 3
10�13, n = 1,138). Additional regression analyses of fly walking
speed changes (Dspeed) indicated that these could explain
less than four-tenths of WAFO change variance (DWAFO; Fig-
ure 3C) and only a tenth of Dlight/dark variance (Figure 3F).
Cross-species analyses indicated that fly speed changes were
weakly predictive of rodent anxiety: only a fifth (WAFO; Figure 3B)
and 6% (light/dark; Figure 3E) of variance was explained. Thus,
while locomotor changes contribute to DWAFO and Dlight/dark
choice, they are not the main driver.
Identification of 5-HT2B, tsr, tmod, CCKLR-17D1, and
CCKLR-17D3 as Fly Anxiety Factors
Wall following assays were used to identify fly anxiety gene can-
didates. Systematic review found that serotonin class 2 recep-
tor knockouts have not been tested for their mouse anxiety
role (http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/020701). Functional alterations
of the two fly class 2 receptor genes, d5-HT2A and d5-HT2B,
found that only the latter had consistent, substantial effects on
WAFO (Figure 4B). Fly orthologs of candidate anxiety genes
found at quantitative trait loci (QTLs) identified from a mouse ge-
netic experiment were screened [28]. Of 17 genes, four showed
WAFO alterations: twinstar (tsr), two Cholecystokinin-like recep-
tor genes (CCKLR-17D3 and CCKLR-17D1), and tropomodulin
(tmod) (Figure 4), which are homologs of mouse cofilin 1 (Cfl1),
cholecystokinin
B
receptor
(Cckbr),
and
Tropomodulin-2
(Tmod2), respectively. Control tests of 17 randomly selected or-
thologs found none produced WAFO effects (Figure 4D). Inter-
estingly, two mouse orthologs of the four fly anxiety candidate
genes are known to anxiety research. Cofilin-1 is a mouse anxi-
ety gene with a knockout having a concordant outcome to the fly
WAFO result [28]. Mouse Cckbr codes for cholecystokinin recep-
tor, and its deletion has an effect concordant with knockdown
effects of fly WAFO [29].

decrease (g = �0.82, p = 7.4 3 10�5, n = 53, 54).

nificant WAFO change.

g2 = 0.48, p = 0.2 3 10�2, n = 60, 40), and over-
expression decreased WAFO (dSerTSceryUAS$cPa
g = �0.53, p = 1.8 3 10�3, n = 73, 75). Warm-
treated controls for d5-HT1A, d5-HT1B, and

statistically significant changes.

 DISCUSSION
The results verify the hypothesis that exposure avoidance behav-
iors of Drosophila share underlying neurogenetic pathways with
mammalian anxiety. A GABA-modulating drug, serotonin recep-
tor and transporter alterations, a stress peptide receptor, and
environmental stressors produced effects that were concordant
with comparable manipulations in mammalian anxiety-related
behaviors. A regression comparison of fly behavior data and
rodent anxiety data indicated that the two are similar. The high
coefficients of determination observed in the interspecies com-
parisons are remarkable in that they would not be expected to
account for sources of variance that include sampling error,
within- and between-lab heterogeneity, publication bias, >600
million years of evolutionary divergence, or the difference be-
tween semi-acute knockdowns and lifelong knockouts.
A candidate survey newly implicated d5-HT2B, tsr, tmod,
CCKLR-17D3, and CCKLR-17D1 in fly anxiety. The anxiolytic ef-
fect of tsr supports the hypothesis that actin microfilament stabil-
ity is connected to anxiety [28], consistent with ideas that actin
polymerization influences anxiety via aversive memory formation
and stability [30] and/or related processes [31]. Similarly, that
CCK-like receptor knockdowns reduce fly anxiety supports the
hypothesis that CCK receptors are involved in anxiety and fear
[32, 33], with a role proposed specifically for the mammalian
cholecystokinin B receptor (CCKBR) [29]. In flies, the putative
ligand for the CCKLR receptors is DROSULFAKININ (DSK);
intriguingly, CCKLR-17D1 and dsk mutants have deficits in a
larval stress-induced escape behavior [34]. The implication of
CCK-like receptors in fly defense behaviors suggests that this
is an anxiety-related signaling system, like GABA, serotonin,
and Dh44-R1/CRHR1. Most of the orthologous gene knock-
downs produced no WAFO effect, suggesting that the QTL hits
include false positives and that WAFO genes are relatively rare.
Anxiety research has struggled to find new therapeutics [11].
Bringing the neurogenetic tools and larger sample sizes of
Drosophila to bear on anxiety promises to complement rodent
model analysis of anxiety and anxiety disorders.
