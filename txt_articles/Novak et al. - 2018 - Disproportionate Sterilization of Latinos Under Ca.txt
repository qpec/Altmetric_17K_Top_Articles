Abstract
Objectives—To compare population-based sterilization rates between Latinas/os and non-
Latinas/os sterilized under California’s eugenics law.
Methods—We used data from 17 362 forms recommending institutionalized patients for 
sterilization between 1920 and 1945. We abstracted patient gender, age, and institution of 
residence into a data set. We extracted data on institution populations from US Census microdata 
from 1920, 1930, and 1940 and interpolated between census years. We used Spanish surnames to 
identify Latinas/os in the absence of data on race/ethnicity. We used Poisson regression with a 
random effect for each patient’s institution of residence to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) 
and compare sterilization rates between Latinas/os and non-Latinas/os, stratifying on gender and 
adjusting for differences in age and year of sterilization.

 Results—Latino men were more likely to be sterilized than were non-Latino men (IRR = 1.23; 
95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15, 1.31), and Latina women experienced an even more 
disproportionate risk of sterilization relative to non-Latinas (IRR = 1.59; 95% CI = 1.48, 1.70).
Conclusions—Eugenic sterilization laws were disproportionately applied to Latina/o patients, 
particularly Latina women and girls. Understanding historical injustices in public health can 
inform contemporary public health practice. (Am J Public Health. Published online ahead of print 
March 22, 2018: e1–e3. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2018.304369)
The legacy of US eugenic sterilization laws, which 32 states used to prevent the 
reproduction of individuals deemed “unfit,” continues to surface in discussions of 
contemporary public health issues, including reproductive autonomy,1 medical mistrust,2 
and prenatal genomic testing. Although public health professionals are periodically 
reminded of this history,3 few studies document the scale and demographics of the 
population sterilized by state actors. Of particular concern is the disproportionate 
sterilization of people of color, which has been noted in historical literature but rarely 
quantified.4 Disproportionate sterilization of racialized minorities is an important historical 
backdrop for ongoing conversations about reproductive health equity1 and implicit bias5 and 
structural racism6 in health care.
We used data from the California state eugenics program, the United States’ most active 
sterilization program,7 to examine dynamics of sterilization for Californians of Latin 
American descent (today described as Latinas/os) relative to Californians of other origins. 
Although the historical context that resulted in disproportionate sterilization of Latinas/os, 
particularly those of Mexican origin, during this period has been articulated,8 the total scope 
of anti-Latina/o bias in sterilization is unknown.
California passed the nation’s third eugenic sterilization law in 1909 and performed one 
third, or 20 000, of all documented compulsory sterilizations conducted under state eugenics 
laws.3 California’s eugenic sterilization law authorized medical superintendents in state 
homes and hospitals to sterilize patients classified as “feebleminded” or having conditions 
thought “likely to be transmitted to descendants.”9 Sterilizations declined after the law was 
revised in the early 1950s.
Although eugenic sterilization programs did not designate specific racial/ethnic groups for 
sterilization, existing racial taxonomies that constructed Whites as superior, along with class 
hierarchies and prejudices against people with disabilities, shaped who would be deemed fit 
and unfit in California’s eugenics program.8 Biases against Mexicans and Mexican 
Americans were especially prominent: institutional authorities described Mexicans and their 
descendants as “immigrants of an undesirable type” and speculated that they were at a 
“lower racial level than is found among American Whites.”10
To better understand the racialized implementation of California eugenics, we evaluated 
whether institution residents of Latina/o origin were disproportionately sterilized. The term 
“Latina/o” was not in use during this period, but we use it to refer to immigrant or US-born 
individuals of Latin American heritage, primarily Mexican origin, who were cast as racially 
inferior and unfit during the period examined.

 METHODS
We used data from more than 20 000 sterilization recommendation forms from the 
California Department of Mental Health (now the Department of State Hospitals). We 
digitized records and abstracted them into a data set, which is described in detail elsewhere.
7,11 Sterilization recommendations are not proof of sterilization, but the recommendation 
process was the primary mechanism through which compulsory sterilizations were 
authorized in institutions.
We restricted our analysis to individuals recommended for sterilization between 1920 and 
1945 (n = 17 852) because denominator US Census data are not available after 1940. We 
used data on each patient’s institution, year of sterilization recommendation, age, and 
gender. We used the 1980 US Census list of Spanish surnames to identify patients of Latin 
American heritage as a racialized group because racial/ethnic origin was not systematically 
recorded on sterilization recommendations. We excluded individuals missing data on 
institution, gender, or age (n = 490), leaving 17 362 records in the analytic sample.
We created population denominators using US Census microdata from 1920, 1930, and 1940 
(https://www.ipums.org/doi/D010.V6.0.shtml) and restricted analyses to patients living in 
California state institutions in each census year: n = 11 110 (1920), 15 566 (1930), and 27 
257 (1940). We linearly interpolated data between census years to create annual 
denominators for sterilization rates. We created interpolation slopes at the institution level 
using counts according to gender, age, and Spanish surname. We extended counts from 1940 
forward to 1945. For institutions that opened during the study period, we extended counts 
from the following census back to the year each institution opened.
We used the number of sterilization recommendations and interpolated the number of 
institution residents stratified by institution, gender, Spanish surname, age group, and year. 
For descriptive analyses, we visually examined temporal trends in sterilization by Spanish 
surname and gender using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing curves of population-
based sterilization rates. To evaluate Spanish surname differences in sterilization, we used 
Poisson regression of the number of sterilizations, with Spanish surname as the independent 
variable, using census denominators as the offset, and including a random effect for 
institution to account for differences in sterilization practices between institutions. Because 
the medical procedures and rationales motivating sterilization differed for women and men, 
we estimated all models stratified by gender. We adjusted for age and period to account for 
differences in the age structure of the Spanish surname and non–Spanish surname 
populations and for temporal differences in population composition. We conducted statistical 
analysis with Stata version 14 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).
RESULTS
In total, 17 362 individuals were recommended for sterilization in California state homes 
and hospitals between 1920 and 1945 (Table A, available as a supplement to the online 
version of this article at http://www.ajph.org). Locally estimated scatterplot smoothing plots 
of sterilization rates (Figure 1) indicated that Latinas/os were at the highest risk of

 sterilization for the entire period. From 1920 to about 1926, men had higher sterilization 
rates than did women. After 1926, women were sterilized at higher rates than were males.
Using gender-stratified Poisson regression, we found that Latino men were at 23% greater 
risk of sterilization than were non-Latino men, accounting for age and period of sterilization 
(incidence rate ratios [IRR] = 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15, 1.31; Table B, 
available as a supplement to the online version of this article at http://www.ajph.org). Anti-
Latina/o bias in sterilization was greater among women, with Latinas at 59% greater risk of 
sterilization than non-Latinas (IRR = 1.59; 95% CI = 1.48, 1.70).
DISCUSSION
We drew on a new, rich source of microdata to quantify the disproportionate sterilization of 
Latinas/os, most of whom were of Mexican origin, in California’s eugenics program. We 
found higher rates of sterilization for Latinas/os (especially Latinas) than non-Latinas/os.
Eugenic thinking inscribed “scientific” legitimacy to racial stereotypes of Latinas/os as 
inferior and unfit to reproduce. In California, eugenics programs were linked to efforts to 
reduce immigration, particularly from Mexico, during a time when growing anti-Mexican 
sentiment manifested in school segregation and racial housing covenants.12 Mexican 
American women and adolescents were particularly stereotyped as “hyper-fertile,” 
inadequate mothers, criminally inclined, and more prone to feeblemindedness.8
Our finding of disproportionate sterilization of Latinas/os in California aligns with an 
empirical study of racial inequities in sterilization in North Carolina,4 but our individual-
level data allowed us to consider gender and age.
Limitations
Spanish surname is an imperfect criterion for identifying Latina/o individuals but has high 
sensitivity and specificity for identifying individuals of Latin American or Spanish descent, 
particularly in mid–20th-century California. In 1950, the first census year for which the 
Census Bureau compared Spanish surname criteria with national origin data, 88% of 
Spanish surname individuals in California were of Mexican descent (www2.census.gov/
prod2/decennial/documents/41601756v4p3ch07.pdf).
Another limitation of the analysis is that it is not possible to confirm which individuals 
recommended for sterilization were ultimately sterilized.
Conclusions
Understanding public health’s role in systemic abuses, such as eugenic sterilization, can 
contextualize the growing literature documenting racial discrimination and implicit racial 
bias in health care.5 Disproportionate coercive sterilization of Latinas/os in California did 
not end with the decline of the state’s eugenics program but continued at other sites, 
including hospitals and prisons. Our research provides insight into the historical construction 
of racial stereotypes and how they worked to justify compulsory sterilization in a specific
