 problems in childhood; however, not all results have been consistent. We previously reported a 
positive association between prenatal BPA exposure and symptoms of anxiety/depression reported 
by the mother at child age 7–9 years in boys, but not girls.
Objectives—Here, in the same birth cohort, we investigated the association of prenatal BPA 
exposure with symptoms of depression and anxiety self-reported by the 10–12 year olds, 
hypothesizing that we would observe sex-specific differences in anxiety and depressive symptoms.
Methods—African-American and Dominican women living in Northern Manhattan and their 
children were followed from mother’s pregnancy through children’s age 10–12 years. BPA was 
quantified in maternal urine collected during the third trimester of pregnancy and in child urine 
collected at ages 3 and 5 years. Children were evaluated using the Revised Children’s Manifest 
Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) and Children’s Depression Rating Scale (CDRS). We compared the 
children in the highest tertile of BPA concentration to those in the lower two tertiles. Associations 
between behavior and prenatal (maternal) BPA concentration or postnatal (child) BPA 
concentration were assessed in regression models stratified by sex.
Results—Significant positive associations between prenatal BPA and symptoms of depression 
and anxiety were observed among boys. Postnatal BPA exposure was not significantly associated 
with outcomes. There was substantial co-occurrence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in this 
sample.
Conclusion—These results provide evidence that prenatal BPA exposure is associated with more 
symptoms of anxiety and depression in boys but not in girls at age 10–12 years.

Introduction
Because of their increasing prevalence, early onset, and impact on the child, family, and 
community, mental and behavioral disorders in children are a growing public health concern 
(Perou et al. 2013). An estimated 17 percent of US adolescents aged 13–18 experience an 
emotional, mental, or behavioral disorder, including anxiety and depression (Merikangas et 
al. 2010). These mental and behavioral disorders in persons <24 years of age impose an 
annual cost in the United States of $247 billion or $2,380 per person (Perou et al. 2013; 
Eisenberg and Neighbors 2007). Their etiology is complex, including familial, genetic and 
environmental factors (Reinherz et al. 2000; Fendrich et al. 1990; López et al. 1999; 
Merikangas et al. 1999).
Bisphenol A (BPA) is a ubiquitous endocrine disrupting chemical commonly used to 
manufacture polymers found in food and drink containers, certain dental sealants 
(Maserejian et al. 2012), thermal receipt paper (Vandenberg et al. 2007), medical devices 
and sales receipts (Biedermann et al. 2010; Geens et al. 2011). According to a national 
survey, 93% of persons 6 years or older who were sampled had detectable levels of BPA in 
their urine; higher BPA urinary concentrations were seen among women and low-income 
individuals (Nelson et al. 2012; Calafat et al. 2008).

 Experimental studies in laboratory animals have reported associations between BPA 
exposure and sex-specific changes in brain structure, function, alterations in DNA 
methylation of the genome, and behavioral problems (including anxiety-like behavior, 
inhibition of spatial skills, problems in spatial learning, and aggressiveness) (Wolstenholme 
et al. 2011; Patisaul et al. 2006; Rubin et al. 2006; Patisaul et al. 2007; Cox et al. 2010; 
Nakagami et al. 2009; Palanza et al. 2008; Kundakovic et al. 2013; Peluso et al. 2014). In 
mice, prenatal BPA induced lasting changes in DNA methylation in the transcriptionally 
relevant region of the gene encoding BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor), which plays 
an important role in fetal brain development; these changes were consistent with BDNF 
changes in the cord blood of children exposed to BPA in utero (Kundakovic et al. 2015). 
Similarly, the various adverse effects observed in these studies may be occurring in a sex-
specific, dose-dependent manner via changes in DNA methylation and gene expression in 
estrogen signaling pathways and estrogen receptors (Kundakovic et al. 2013; Naciff et al. 
2002; Vandenberg et al. 2009; Wetherill et al. 2007).
Epidemiologic studies have reported sex-specific differences in child behavior associated 
with increased prenatal BPA/maternal urinary concentrations (Perera et al. 2012; Harley et 
al. 2013; Braun et al. 2011a; Braun et al. 2009; Evans et al. 2014; Roen et al. 2015). 
However, the associations and sex-specific relationships observed in epidemiological studies 
have not always been consistent (Perera et al. 2012; Harley et al. 2013; Braun et al. 2011a; 
Braun et al. 2009)(see details in Discussion).
Using assessment instruments with reporting by the child, rather than by the parent, to elicit 
information on symptoms of anxiety and depression, we hypothesized that we would 
continue to observe sex-specific associations between prenatal BPA urinary concentrations 
and symptoms of both anxiety and depression at 10–12 years of age. Further, we 
hypothesized that we would observe extensive comorbidity of anxiety and depression in this 
inner city cohort, as has been reported in many other studies (Cummings et al. 2014).
Methods
Sample selection
A complete description of the NYC cohort and study design appears elsewhere (Perera et al. 
2003; Perera et al. 2006). Briefly, participants included mothers and children participating in 
the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health (CCCEH) prospective cohort 
study. Between 1998 and 2006, 727 pregnant women residing in Washington Heights, 
Harlem and the South Bronx were recruited in prenatal clinics to participate in the study. 
Only women ages 18–35 years, non-smokers, non-users of other tobacco products and/or 
illicit drugs, those generally in good health (free of known diabetes, hypertension and HIV), 
and those who initiated prenatal care by 20 weeks of pregnancy were included in the study. 
In-person postnatal questionnaires were given when the child was 6 months and annually 
thereafter, with developmental questionnaires administered every 1–2 years. Informed 
consent was provided for children by the mothers until age 7 after which age the children 
gave their assent to participate. The Institutional Review Boards of the Columbia University 
Medical Center and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) approved this 
study.

 Chemical measures
Collection of spot urine samples during the third trimester of pregnancy began in 1999 
(Hoepner et al. 2013), the year after initial recruitment and data collection began. 348 
mothers provided urine samples during pregnancy for measurement of BPA and mono-n-
butyl phthalate (MnBP), as a major phthalate metabolite. Not all participants had BPA 
measures because of limitations in amount of urine available and limited funding for these 
analyses. A subset of the 348 children was followed through ages 10–12, when data from the 
Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) and Children’s Depression Rating 
Scale-Revised (CDRS) were obtained on 239 and 231 children, respectively (Figure 1). 
Urine samples were collected at ages 3 and/or 5 years during the same visit when 
questionnaires were administered. 218 of the 241 children included in this analysis had data 
on postnatal BPA concentrations: age 5 urinary BPA measures were used for 181 children 
and age 3 year measures were used for 37 children who were missing the 5 year sample.
After collection, the samples were sent to the CCCEH laboratory, inventoried, stored at 
−80°C, and subsequently shipped to the CDC for analysis. Total (free plus conjugated) 
urinary concentrations of BPA and MnBP were measured separately using online solid-
phase extraction coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography–isotope dilution–
tandem mass spectrometry as described previously (Ye et al. 2005; Kato et al. 2005), with 
appropriate quality control samples in each run. The limits of detection (LOD) were 0.4 
μg/L (BPA) and 0.4–1.1 μg/L (MnBP). Concentrations below the LOD were given a value of 
LOD/2 for statistical analysis. To adjust for urinary dilution, BPA and phthalate metabolite 
values were adjusted for specific gravity (SG) obtained using a handheld refractometer 
(Urine-Specific-Gravity-Refractometer-PAL-10-S-P14643C0; TAGO USA, Inc., Bellevue, 
WA). We used the formula: Chemicalc = BPA or MnBP × [(mean SG − 1)/(individual SG 
− 1)] where Chemicalc is the SG-corrected chemical concentration (μg/L), BPA or MnBP is 
the measured chemical concentration (μg/L), SG is the specific gravity of the urine sample, 
and mean SG is the mean SG in the study population calculated separately for maternal, 
child age 3 and child age 5 samples (Hauser et al. 2004).
Behavioral outcomes
When children reached ages 10–12 years, they completed a semi-structured interview using 
the CDRS administered by a trained researcher, according to the standard method of 
administration.
The CDRS is the most widely used scale for assessing severity of depression in children. 
The CDRS assesses the severity of depressive symptoms on a 17-item scale. The scale 
encompasses cognitive, somatic, affective, and psychomotor symptoms. Items are rated for 
severity on a 7-point scale (1 to 7) for 14 items and on a 5-point scale (1 to 5) for three 
items. A total score for each measure is generated based on the child’s answers to questions 
related to the different categories (such as school work, capacity to have fun, social 
withdrawal) that assess symptom severity (Mayes et al. 2010; Poznanski et al. 1979). The 
psychometric properties of the scale are strong for the child age group (ages 6–12 years) 
(Poznanski and Mokros 1996). The internal consistency (Cronbach’s α) in children is good 
(α = 0.85) (Mayes et al., 2010). Test-retest reliability is good (Wisniewski et al. 1987).

 Convergent validity with a global assessment of depression by two child psychiatrists has 
also been shown (0.92) (Poznanski and Mokros 1996). For the CDRS, a raw score of ≥40 is 
indicative of depression, whereas a score ≤28 is often used to define minimal or no 
symptoms (Mayes et al. 2010).
The Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale was self-administered at age 10–12 years. 
This self-report instrument was designed to measure anxiety for children and adolescents 
older than 6 years (Reynolds and Richmond 1985). It consists of 37 questions answered as 
yes/no. The Total Anxiety score and the Anxiety subscale scores are determined by the 
number of “yes” responses to the anxiety items (Reynolds and Richmond 1985). The lie 
score is used to determine if the child was making a valid attempt to respond (Lee et al. 
1988). Psychometric properties (reliability and validity) of the RCMAS have been well 
characterized. Reliability estimates for internal consistency (Cronbach’s α) are good (0.79 
for males, 0.85 for females, and 0.82 for the total sample of males and females) (Reynolds et 
al. 1980). There is substantive research confirming the validity of the RCMAS as a measure 
of chronic manifest anxiety in children, dating back to the original article reporting the 
development of the RCMAS (Reynolds and Richmond 1978). A meta-analytic review 
showed that it discriminates well between youth with anxiety disorders and youth without 
disorders (Seligman et al. 2004); and a previous study shows good discriminant validity 
between boys with anxiety and normal controls (Perrin and Last 1992). For RCMAS Total 
Anxiety, a raw score of > 18 is indicative of clinically significant anxiety (Stallard et al. 
2001). However, severity ratings for anxiety and depression are not able to effectively 
distinguish youth with anxiety disorders and major depression because of the high rate of 
comorbidity between the two disorders in youth. Moreover, dimensional ratings of symptom 
severity are not intended to be diagnostic of anxiety vs. depression, but simply to measure 
the severity of the respective symptoms (Seligman et al. 2004).
Statistical analysis
Because of the uncertainty in the measurement of the BPA level in a single spot urine as an 
indicator of chronic exposure, prenatal and postnatal BPA concentrations were divided into 
tertiles. Although several samples are preferable to properly characterize BPA exposure 
(Quiros-Alcala et al. 2013; Meeker et al. 2013; Braun et al. 2012), a single spot urine sample 
can adequately classify individuals in terms of exposure groups by tertiles (Mahalingaiah et 
al. 2008), despite low intra-class correlations for concentrations from multiple samples 
(Braun et al. 2011b) and high daily variance (Ye et al. 2011). For these reasons, as in our 
prior analyses (Perera et al. 2012; Roen et al. 2015), we compared the upper to the two lower 
tertiles based on the distribution of predicted scores, which did not strongly support an 
alternative U-shaped curve (Figure 2). To be consistent, postnatal BPA concentration, which 
was included as an independent variable in a supplemental analysis, was treated in the same 
manner as prenatal BPA in the analyses of CDRS and RCMAS scores.
On the RCMAS, the Total Anxiety Score is expressed as a raw score and a T-score (M=50, 
sd=10); the subscales are expressed as raw scores and scaled scores (M=10, sd=3). Both raw 
scores and T-scores are generated on the CDRS. We analyzed the raw scores as continuous 
variables in order to assess associations across the full range of outcomes in this non-clinical

 population. The CDRS and RCMAS raw scores were normally distributed; we therefore 
used linear regression to analyze the relationship between scores and BPA urinary 
concentrations. Analyses were performed stratifying on sex and then combining sexes to 
assess BPA exposure x sex interaction.
As in our prior reports (Perera et al. 2012; Roen et al. 2015), we adjusted for potential 
confounding variables that are known or suspected risk factors based on the literature and 
our previous results. These included ethnicity, gestational age of the child (based on medical 
record data), mother’s intelligence (measured by the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence 3rd 
Edition, TONI-3 (Brown et al. 1997)), maternal education (completion of high school prior 
to birth of this child vs. no completion), maternal demoralization (measured by the 
Psychiatric Epidemiology Research Instrument–Demoralization (PERI-D) scale) 
(Dohrenwend et al. 1978), child age (in months) at testing, quality of the child’s home 
environment at 3 years of age (measured by the HOME (Home Observation for 
Measurement of the Environment) Inventory (Bradley 1994), prenatal exposure to 
environmental tobacco smoke (ETS, yes/no), and SG-adjusted MnBP in maternal urine 
collected during the third trimester of pregnancy (Adibi et al. 2008). In contrast to MnBP, 
exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) monitored in air during pregnancy was 
not correlated with BPA (Pearson Correlation Coefficient r=0.012, p=0.86) and was not 
included in the models. We used an established multiple imputation method (Rubin 1987) to 
provide missing values for the small percentage of the children who lacked particular 
information, as shown in the table below. In no case were data lacking for more than 6.2% of 
participants.
To determine if postnatal BPA was a potential confounder, we compared the adjusted and 
unadjusted associations in the subset having both BPA measures (n=210) and found that 
results were materially unchanged. Parallel analyses with postnatal BPA urinary 
concentrations as the predictor variable were also conducted. To evaluate the potential for 
selection bias due to loss to follow-up, we conducted sensitivity analyses using inverse 
probability weighting (IPW).
We examined the BPA x sex interaction on the CDRS and RCMAS scores using linear 
regression, including the main effects of BPA and sex, and an interaction term defined as 
significant by having a regression coefficient that differed from 0 with a p-value < 0.05. A 
negative interaction term indicates that the observed effect of BPA on depression or anxiety 
is smaller in girls compared to that in boys. All regression coefficient estimates and p-values 
were generated using SAS (version 9.3 SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Although our analyses 
involved multiple tests, we did not perform Bonferroni adjustment, in order to reduce the 
possibility of making a type II error (Rothman 1990). Rather, our focus was on the sex-
specific patterns of the observed relationships and their consistency with those seen in our 
cohort children at an earlier age (Perera et al. 2012; Roen et al. 2015). We note that there 
were no material differences in results before and after conducting imputation.
We examined the extent to which CDRS and RCMAS total scores were correlated with each 
other (Pearson Correlation). To determine the degree to which prenatal BPA was associated 
with symptoms of anxiety independent of depression, in separate analyses, we: 1) ran the

 model for RCMAS adjusting for CDRS total score and 2) treating the residuals obtained 
from regression of RCMAS on CDRS as the outcome variable.
Results
The 241 children included in this analysis did not differ in demographic or exposure 
characteristics from all others in the parent study (N=471) who were not included, except for 
having an earlier age at assessment on CDRS and RCMAS and a higher average HOME 
inventory score (p<0.05). (Table 1) The same was true when we compared the subset 
analyzed (N=241) with the group having prenatal BPA measures but missing outcome or 
postnatal BPA or MnBP data (N=107). Age at assessment was included in the model.
The present study sample in the analysis of RCMAS included 239 children (114 boys and 
125 girls). The analysis of CDRS included 231 children (109 boys and 122 girls). A total of 
235/241 (97.51%) prenatal samples had detectable BPA concentrations and 215/218 
(98.6 %) postnatal samples (at age 3 or 5 years) had detectable BPA concentrations. The 
ranges and percentile distribution of prenatal BPA urinary concentrations are shown in Table 
2. A wide range of prenatal and postnatal BPA concentrations was observed within our 
cohort with higher geometric mean concentrations observed during childhood.
Supplemental Tables 3 and 4 provide the mean scores for CDRS and RCMAS by tertile of 
BPA exposure, for boys and girls, respectively. As shown in Figure 3 and summarized in 
Supplemental Table 5, boys in the highest prenatal BPA concentration tertile experienced 
higher CDRS Total Scores (more symptoms of depression) compared to those in the lower 
two tertiles (β=2.83, p=0.05). No significant association was detected in girls. As noted 
above, a raw score of ≥40 is indicative of depression, whereas a score ≤28 is often used to 
define minimal or no symptoms (Mayes et al., 2010). The mean raw CDRS score for the 
boys in the highest BPA tertile in our study was 29.5. 5/38 (13.2%) of the boys in the highest 
BPA tertile scored ≥40, compared to 1/33 (3.0%) in the lowest tertile and 1/38 (2.6%) in the 
middle tertile.
We observed significant positive associations between prenatal BPA concentration and the 
RCMAS Total Score (β=2.47, p=0.04) and the social concern subscale (β=0.83, p=0.025) in 
boys (Figure 3 and Supplemental Table 5). No significant associations were seen in girls 
(Supplemental Table 5). 5/39 (12.8%) of boys in the highest BPA tertile scored >18, 
compared to 2/34 (5.9%) in the lowest tertile and 3/41 (7.3%) in the middle tertile.
Results for both sexes combined are shown in Supplemental Table 5 along with the 
interaction terms. The positive significant associations seen overall (all children) were driven 
mainly by the effects in boys. The interaction terms (BPA x sex) were not significant: for the 
CDRS Total Score (β=−2.61, p=0.194); for the RCMAS Total Score or the subscale scores 
(βs between −0.79 and −2.66).
After accounting for potential selection bias based on the inverse probability weighting 
method, we found that the associations between prenatal BPA concentration and CDRS and 
RCMAS scores in boys were not materially changed (Supplemental Table 6). Additionally, 
because it may not be appropriate to use age 3 measures of BPA for 37 children who lacked

 the 5 year measure, we conducted a sensitivity analysis that did not show material 
differences in results when those 37 children were included vs. excluded.
The CDRS and RCMAS Total scores were significantly correlated (Pearson Correlation, 
r=0.554, p<0.0001). Adjustment of RCMAS for CDRS in the model with prenatal BPA 
resulted in loss of significance, although the directions of association remained the same 
(Supplemental Table 7). Treating the residuals obtained from regression of RCMAS on 
CDRS as the outcome variable, the associations with prenatal BPA were nonsignificant for 
both sexes (data not shown).
The associations between postnatal BPA and RCMAS or CDRS outcomes were generally 
not significant in either boys or girls, except for the interaction term (BPA x sex) for 
RCMAS subscale oversensitivity (β=1.67, p=0.04) (see Supplemental Table 8). However, as 
in our earlier reports (Perera et al. 2012; Roen et al. 2015), the directions of the associations 
were opposite to those seen with prenatal BPA.
Discussion
The aim of this study in a non-clinical population was to assess the associations between 
BPA exposure and continuous measures of depression and anxiety. We observed significant 
positive associations between prenatal BPA urinary concentrations and self-reported 
symptoms of anxiety and depression among 10–12 year old boys in our NYC cohort of 
Dominican and African-American children; in contrast no significant associations were seen 
among girls. The associations with postnatal BPA were generally inverse but none were 
significant. This suggests that the critical window of susceptibility is the period of fetal 
development. These findings, with respect to prenatal exposure, are consistent with results in 
the same cohort using the maternal report on the CBCL at child ages 7–9 years that showed 
positive associations between maternal urinary BPA concentrations and internalizing and 
externalizing composite scores and specific syndrome scales including anxiety/depression in 
boys (Perera et al. 2012; Roen et al. 2015). They are also consistent with our previous 
finding that maternal urinary BPA concentrations were generally inversely associated with 
scores among girls 7–9 years of age (Perera et al. 2012; Roen et al. 2015). In a primarily 
Hispanic cohort in Salinas Valley, California, Harley et al. also reported positive associations 
between prenatal BPA urinary concentrations and internalizing problems, including 
symptoms of anxiety and depression as well as increased aggressive behavior in boys at 7 
years of age using the Behavioral Assessment Scale for Children (BASC-2). In girls, these 
authors observed inverse associations between prenatal BPA and many symptoms, although 
none were significant (Harley et al. 2013). In a multi-center cohort in four US cities, Evans 
et al. observed increased behavior problems in school age boys, but not girls, related to 
prenatal BPA when restricting to children of mothers with detectable urinary prenatal BPA 
(Evans et al., 2014). In contrast, in a largely white cohort in Cincinnati, Ohio, Braun et al. 
reported that prenatal BPA urinary concentrations were linked to a decrease in hyperactivity 
in boys and increases in anxiety, depression, hyperactivity and externalizing symptoms in 
girls at ages 2–3 years using the BASC (Braun et al. 2011a; Braun et al. 2009).

 The discrepancy among studies may be due to differences in timing of exposure 
measurement, instruments used in outcome assessment, statistical treatment of exposure 
variables, and populations studied. Ethnic differences in co-exposures, genetic factors, and 
social stressors experienced by the mothers and children in the respective cohorts and 
differences in age at which the children were tested may also contribute.
The observed extensive co-occurrence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in this sample is 
consistent with other studies (Cummings et al. 2014).
In this study, higher levels of prenatal exposure to BPA are associated with higher more 
reported symptoms of depression and anxiety in boys. A higher percentage of the boys in the 
higher prenatal exposure group scored in the clinically significant range than among boys 
with lower prenatal exposure; however, a definitive clinical diagnosis requires additional 
assessment, which is being conducted in the cohort at a later follow-up. We note that the 
level of symptoms are largely in the typical range and not indicative of major mental health 
problems.
Regarding possible mechanisms by which BPA could exert endocrine disrupting effects on 
symptom expression, a recent experimental study suggests that prenatal BPA exposure alters 
expression of genes encoding the estrogen receptors, ER-α, ER-β and estrogen-related 
receptor-γ, with corresponding changes in mRNA levels of DNA methyltransferases 
DNMT1 and DNMT3A and methylation of the ER-α gene in the cortex and hypothalamus 
of male and female mice, respectively. As noted earlier, another study showed that prenatal 
BPA exposure induced lasting DNA methylation changes in the BDNF gene (Kundakovic et 
al. 2015, 2014). Additional studies have shown that rodents exposed to BPA prenatally had 
increased levels of anxiety (Cox et al. 2010; Patisaul and Bateman 2008; Ryan and 
Vandenbergh 2006; Tian et al. 2010; Yu et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2014; Luo et al. 2014), 
although the sex-specificity of these associations was not always consistent between studies 
(Ishido et al. 2004; Ishido et al. 2007; Masuo et al. 2004; Xu et al. 2007). Sex-specific 
effects on spatial learning and memory outcomes have also been linked to developmental 
BPA exposure (Ryan and Vandenbergh 2006; Xu et al. 2007). Taken together, these studies 
suggest that epigenetic mechanisms may underlie some of the effects of BPA on behavior.
Our findings on the effect of prenatal BPA exposure in boys are consistent with prior 
epidemiologic data suggesting a greater vulnerability of the male brain during prenatal 
development (Perera et al. 2012; Harley et al. 2013). A number of studies assessing 
outcomes, such as behavior problems and reduced IQ, have reported evidence that boys may 
be more affected than girls by prenatal exposure to BPA (Harley et al. 2013), lead 
(Jedrychowski et al. 2009), and chlorpyrifos (Horton et al. 2012). However, the sex-
dependent effect of these chemicals likely depends on the nature and timing of exposure. 
The finding that results differ between boys and girls is plausible given the endocrine-
disrupting characteristic of BPA.
The present study has a number of strengths including the prospective cohort design and the 
large number of variables collected from medical records, questionnaires and biological 
samples collected across the span of our study, allowing us to control for multiple potential

 confounders at different time points, and the fact that symptoms are now self-reported by the 
child rather than reported by the parent.
The limited sample size and the assessment of prenatal BPA exposure based on a single 
measurement collected prenatally are limitations. Because BPA has a short half-life and 
exposures are likely episodic in nature, the single spot urine sample collected may not 
adequately describe a participant’s chronic exposure. Recent work shows that repeated 
urinary specimens are ideal to better characterize BPA exposure (Cox et al. 2016). However, 
as noted, the urinary concentration from a single urine sample has moderate sensitivity in 
estimating an individual’s BPA tertile categorization (Mahalingaiah et al. 2008), mitigating 
exposure misclassification. Furthermore, given the potential for noise in these 
measurements, we would expect the result to be biased towards the null. We adjusted for a 
number of known factors that may confound the association between BPA exposure and 
behavioral outcomes; however, it is possible that residual confounding remains. Although 
generalizability is reduced by the ethnicity of our cohort (African-American and 
Dominican), these ethnic groups comprise a large and growing fraction of the US population 
of women of reproductive age. There is the possibility of selection bias in any such study; 
however, analysis using IPW did not show evidence of a biased sample.
Conclusion
The etiology of behavioral problems in children is complex and multi-factorial; however, 
these results suggest that prenatal BPA exposure may contribute to sex-specific effects on 
anxiety and depressive symptoms in our inner city population. They add to other reports 
raising concern about the pervasiveness of this chemical and its potential effects on children 
from early-life exposures. Other studies have linked anxiety and depression with adverse 
learning outcomes and poor school performance (Bub et al. 2007; Grimm et al. 2010), both 
of which adversely impact future economic and emotional well-being. Other research also 
indicates that the rate of symptom expression is only beginning to increase at ages 9–12 
years and that elevated symptoms at these ages may be harbingers of subsequent more 
serious clinical disorders related to anxiety and depression that will manifest in adolescence 
and young adulthood (Merikangas et al. 2010; Simonoff et al. 1997; Costello et al. 2006; 
Paus et al. 2008; Patton and Viner 2007). We continue to follow the children to assess the 
relation between prenatal BPA exposure and clinical disorders in adolescence in our cohort.
