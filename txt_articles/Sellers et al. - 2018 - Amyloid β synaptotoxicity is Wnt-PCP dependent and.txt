Abstract
Introduction: Synapse loss is the structural correlate of the cognitive decline indicative of dementia.
In the brains of Alzheimer’s disease sufferers, amyloid b (Ab) peptides aggregate to form senile pla-
ques but as soluble peptides are toxic to synapses. We previously demonstrated that Ab induces
Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1), which in turn activates the Wnt–planar cell polarity (Wnt-PCP) pathway to drive
tau pathology and neuronal death.
Methods: We compared the effects of Ab and of Dkk1 on synapse morphology and memory impair-
ment while inhibiting or silencing key elements of the Wnt-PCP pathway.
Results: We demonstrate that Ab synaptotoxicity is also Dkk1 and Wnt-PCP dependent, mediated
by the arm of Wnt-PCP regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics via Daam1, RhoA and ROCK, and
can be blocked by the drug fasudil.
Discussion: Our data add to the importance of aberrant Wnt signaling in Alzheimer’s disease neuro-
pathology and indicate that fasudil could be repurposed as a treatment for the disease.

1. Introduction
Amyloid b (Ab) has long been associated with Alz-
heimer’s disease (AD) through a propensity to form insoluble
deposits, senile plaques, a hallmark of the AD brain. Over-
whelming genetic and experimental evidence indicates that
Ab and its parent molecule, the Ab precursor protein
(APP), are key players in the neuropathogenic processes
driving AD. Ab readily self-associates to form a range of

 soluble oligomers and insoluble fibers, and the current
consensus view holds that it is the small soluble oligomeric
forms of Ab rather than the plaques themselves that are the
neurotoxic species [1–3]. We have previously found that
Ab-driven increases in tau phosphorylation (a second
hallmark of the disease) and neuronal death are dependent
on activation of a branch of Wingless/Wnt signaling known
as
the
Wnt–planar
cell
polarity
(Wnt-PCP)
pathway,
specifically the arm of Wnt-PCP acting through Jun N-termi-
nal kinase (JNK) and its target, c-Jun, to regulate gene tran-
scription [4] (please see glossary for definitions of these and
other terms that occur below). We have shown that Ab acti-
vates Wnt-PCP through the ability of Ab to induce
Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1). Dkk1 then blocks the binding interaction
between LRP6 and frizzled, preventing canonical Wnt-b-cat-
enin activity and concomitantly activating Wnt-PCP signaling
[5,6]. Furthermore, our data indicate that Dkk1 and Wnt-PCP
not only shape the transcriptomic profile of the AD brain but
also the activity of pathways within the brain most closely
associated with the AD process [4,7]. The top four most
significant of these pathways are the adherens junction, Wnt
signaling, TGF-b signaling, and long-term potentiation, all
of which are intimately involved in synaptic plasticity [8–10].
Ab synaptotoxicity is thought to be a very early event in the
disease process, central to disease etiology and possibly the
driver of many of the other neurotoxic properties attributed to
Ab [2,11,12]. Indeed, the degree of cognitive impairment in
AD correlates more closely with synapse number than with
amyloid load or extent of tau pathology [2,13,14]. However,
although widely studied, the underlying mechanisms of Ab
synaptotoxicity have yet to be fully determined [2,15].
In addition to influencing transcription via JNK/c-Jun, the
Wnt-PCP pathway also regulates cytoskeletal dynamics
through RhoA and ROCK, two key regulators of synapse
formation [16,17], both shown to be responsive to Ab [18].
Given the synaptic effects of Ab have been reported to be
Dkk1 dependent [19] and as Dkk1 activates Wnt-PCP [4],
we investigated the possibility that Ab may exert its synap-
totoxicity by activating the Wnt-PCP-RhoA/ROCK pathway
via Dkk1 induction. We present evidence that this is indeed
the case. Furthermore, we demonstrated the therapeutic po-
tential of the ROCK inhibitor drug fasudil as a strategy to
ameliorate both the synaptic and cognitive effects of Ab.
2. Methods
2.1. Dkk1 measures
Rat Dkk1 mRNA expression was performed by quantitative
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein
levels determined using a DuoSet ELISA kit (DY1906; R&D
Systems), both as previously described [4].
2.2. Neuronal culture and transfections
Primary cortical neuronal cultures were prepared from
Sprague-Dawley rat E18 embryos, as described previously
[20]. Cells were seeded onto coverslips coated with poly-D-
lysine 10 mg/mL (Sigma) at a density of 3 ! 105/well
equating to 857/mm2. Cells were cultured in feeding media:
neurobasal medium (21103049) supplemented with 2%
B27 (17504044), 0.5 mM glutamine (25030024), and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (15070063) (all reagents from Life
technologies, UK). After 4 days in vitro (d.i.v.), 200 mM of
D,L-amino-phosphonovalerate (D,L-APV, ab120004; Abcam)
was added to media to maintain neuronal health over long-
term culture and to reduce cell death due to excitotoxicity
[20]. Fifty percent media changes were performed twice
weekly until desired time in culture was reached (23 d.i.v.).
Cells were then transfected with an expression construct en-
coding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) driven by
the synapsin 1 promoter using Lipofectamine 2000 resulting
in 5%–10% transfection efficacy after 48 hours [20,21]. The
exogenous expression of eGFP is to allow the imaging of
neuritic processes including dendritic spines, in those cells
taking up the construct without the need for further labeling.
2.3. Pharmacological treatments of neuronal cultures
All pharmacological treatments were performed in artifi-
cial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF): 125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM
KCl, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 11 mM glucose,
5 mM HEPES, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.25 mM MgCl2, and
0.2 mM APV. Neuronal cultures were pretreated with inhibi-
tor compounds for 30 minutes before application of Dkk1 re-
combinant protein, Ab1–42 oligomers, or fibrillar Ab25–35. All
compounds were dissolved in water or DMSO at a concentra-
tion of 10 or 1 mM, serially diluted to a 10! working concen-
tration in aCSF, and applied directly to neuronal cultures.
Final concentration of solvent was ,0.01%, as also used in
vehicle control. Treatments were allowed to proceed for indi-
cated times before being fixed for immunocytochemistry.
2.4. Immunocytochemistry
Neurons were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
and then fixed in either 4% formaldehyde/4% sucrose in PBS
for 10 minutes at room temperature followed by incubation
in methanol prechilled to 220�C for 10 minutes at 4�C or in
methanol (220�C) only for 20 minutes at 4�C. Fixed neu-
rons were then permeabilized and blocked simultaneously
(2% Non-Immune Goat Serum; Sigma, and 0.2% Triton
X-100) before incubation in primary antibodies overnight
and subsequent incubation with secondary antibodies the
next day [20]. In the green/purple color scheme, colocaliza-
tion is indicated by white overlap.
2.5. Antibodies used
Green fluorescent protein, chicken polyclonal (ab13972;
Abcam); PSD-95, mouse monoclonal (clone K28/43,
73-028; NeuroMab); PSD-95, rabbit polyclonal (2507;
Cell Signaling Technology); Bassoon, mouse monoclonal
(ab82958; Abcam); GluA1, rabbit polyclonal (ABN241;
Millipore) are the antibodies used in this study.

 2.6. Spine morphology and immunofluorescence
Images were acquired with the Leica SP-5 confocal mi-
croscope using a 63! oil-immersion objective (numerical
aperture 5 1.4; Leica) as z-series. Two-dimensional
maximum projection reconstructions of images were gener-
ated, and morphometric analysis (spine number, area and
breadth) was performed using MetaMorph software (Univer-
sal Imaging Corporation, West Chester, PA, USA) [20].
Morphometric analysis was performed on spines from at
least two dendrites (secondary or tertiary branches), totaling
100 mm in length, per neuron. For each condition, 9–12 neu-
rons from at least three separate experiments (each per-
formed in duplicate) were used. Experiments were carried
out blind to condition. Linear density and total gray value
of each synaptic protein cluster were measured automati-
cally using MetaMorph [20]. Cultures undergoing direct
comparison were stained simultaneously and imaged with
the same acquisition parameters.
2.7. Pharmacodynamics
Fasudil and hydroxyfasudil were administered separately
at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg, by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, to
young adult male CD1 mice. Animals were sacrificed 20 mi-
nutes after dosing, and terminal plasma and brain samples
were taken. Proteins were extracted using acetonitrile precip-
itation, and fasudil/hydroxyfasudil levels were measured by
ultra high performance liquid chromatography - time of flight
(UHPLC-TOF) mass spectrometry using electrospray ioni-
zation. CNS availability of fasudil was measured using an
in situ rat-brain perfusion technique, as described previously
[22]. Briefly, CNS circulation is isolated from the periphery
through cannulation of the carotid arteries and ligation of ju-
gular veins. Blood is replaced with plasma substitute contain-
ing fasudil and a vascular marker (e.g., sucrose) for up to
30 minutes. Whole brain homogenates are put through
dextran centrifugation to remove brain capillaries, which
may bind/trap drug. Fasudil and its metabolite (hydroxyfasu-
dil) are measured by high-performance liquid chromatog-
raphy in postcapillary brain parenchyma and in CSF
sampled from the cisterna magna (25–50 mL sample
collected by glass pipette before termination of perfusion).
2.8. Behavioral testing
2.8.1. Animals
Female Lister-hooded rats (weighing w215 6 20 g at the
start of experimentation; Charles River, UK) were housed in
groups of five in individually ventilated two-story home ca-
ges, in a 12-hour light cycle (illuminated 07:00 to
19:00 hours) with controlled temperature (21 6 2�C) and
humidity (55 6 5%). Water and food (Special Diet Services,
UK) were given ad libitum. All experiments were under-
taken during the illuminated period and conducted in accor-
dance with UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) 1986 Act
and the University of Manchester ethical guidelines.
2.8.2. Ab1–42 oligomer preparation
Biotin-Ab1–42 (ANA24640) was purchased from AnaS-
pec, USA, disaggregated in hexafluoroisopropanol for
1 hour, aliquoted, and hexafluoroisopropanol was removed
by evaporation under N2; and the monomeric peptide was
solubilized in DMSO at 1 mM, diluted to 100 mM in
Ham’s F12, and allowed to oligomerize at room temperature
for 16 hours.
2.8.3. Surgical procedure
Rats were anesthetized using 4% isoflurane in O2 in an in-
duction chamber, mounted in a stereotaxic frame, and anes-
thesia was maintained with 2%–3% isoflurane. Then, 10 mL
of 100 mM Ab1–42 oligomers (AbO) was injected into the left
lateral ventricle using Bregman coordinates—H-0.8; Tr-1.5;
V-4.5,
at
a
flow
rate
of
2.5
mL/min
(total
administered 5 10 mmol). Surgery date was defined as day
0. Rats were treated with i.p. injections of vehicle or fasudil
at 10 mg/kg twice daily from day 1 to day 6. The novel object
recognition (NOR) test was performed on day 7, as previ-
ously described [23]. In brief, rats were placed in a 52- !
52- ! 51-cm polyvinyl chloride arena for 3 minutes with
two identical objects. Animals were taken out of the box
for an intertrial interval of 1 minute then placed back in
the same box for further 3 minutes with an identical copy
of the previous object and a novel object. Both sessions
were digitally recorded, and the time spent in exploring
each object was scored. The discrimination index was calcu-
lated as (novel 2 familiar)/(novel 1 familiar).
2.9. Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad or
SPSS. Differences in quantitative immunofluorescence, den-
dritic spine number, and morphology were identified by Stu-
dent’s unpaired t-tests. For comparisons between multiple
conditions, the main effects and simple effects were probed
by 1- or 2-way analyses of variance with Tukey’s correction
for multiple comparisons.
density and morphology assessed. Both treatments resulted in a significant reduction in dendritic spine linear density, quantified in (D), scale bar 5 5 mM. Den-
dritic spine linear density/10 mm: control, 5.8 6 0.41; AbO, 3.7 6 0.34; Dkk1, 3.5 6 0.31; P ,.001 for all treatments. (E and F) Similar cultures were treated
overnight with Dkk1-siRNA duplex, or a scrambled version as control, each linked to the Pen-1 peptide. Next day, cells were treated with 2 mM AbO for 4 hours,
fixed, and fluorescently labeled with phalloidin-488, imaged (E), and F-actin–labeled puncta quantified (F), scale bar 5 50 mM. In all the aforementioned, sig-
nificance was determined by ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc t-test. Error bars indicate standard error of the mean. Abbreviations: AbO, amyloid b (1–42) olig-

 3. Results
3.1. Ab drives Dkk1 production
Ab drives Dkk1 expression [4,19,24], and Dkk1 protein
levels are raised in the brains of Ab/APP-based mouse
models of AD pathology [25]. We extend these observations
by showing that increases in both Dkk1 mRNA and protein
are readily detectable in cultured rodent neurons following
treatment with the active portion of Ab, Ab25–35, and by sol-
uble AbO within 2–3 hours and within 4 hours by AbO at
nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 1A and 1B).
3.2. Synaptic effects of Ab and Dkk1 are similar
To compare the synaptic effects of Ab and Dkk1 pro-
tein, rat cortical neurons (24 d.i.v.) were transfected
with eGFP and 48 hours later treated with either
2 mM AbO for 4 hours or with 400 ng/mL recombinant
Dkk1 proteins for 3 hours. An additional 1 hour was given
for Ab treatments to allow time for endogenous Dkk1
expression, thereby rendering the two treatments more
comparable. AbO and Dkk1 had potent, significant, and
very similar effects on dendritic spine linear density
(Fig. 1C and 1D). After exposure to either AbO or
Dkk1, a small number of immature filopodia-like den-
dritic spines appear to be spared indicating that Ab-driven
spine loss is selectively targeting dendritic spines with es-
tablished postsynaptic densities, an observation we are
now investigating in more detail.
3.3. Ab synaptotoxicity is Dkk1 dependent
Antibody neutralization of Dkk1 blocks Ab-induced syn-
apse loss [19]. To extend this, we knocked down Dkk1 expres-
sion in primary cortical neuronal cultures using a previously
validated penetrating peptide-coupled siRNA duplex target-
ing rat Dkk1 with a scrambled form as control [4]. Assessing
synapse number by phalloidin-488 labeling of F-actin puncta
in the presence of the control siRNA, 2 mM AbO caused a sub-
stantial and significant reduction in synapse number for more
than 4 hours. This was significantly blocked in neurons treated
with the Dkk1-siRNA (Fig. 1E and 1F), confirming that Dkk1
is required for Ab synaptotoxicity to occur.
3.4. Dkk1 synaptotoxicity is Daam1 dependent
Activation of the Wnt-PCP/RhoA/ROCK pathway re-
quires an interaction between disheveled and Daam1 or
Daam2 (Fig. 2A). The only known role of Daam1 and
Daam2 is as elements of the Wnt-PCP pathway [26–28].
To determine if Dkk1-driven synapse loss is truly Wnt-
PCP dependent, we individually knocked down either
DAAM1 or DAAM2 in rat primary cortical cultures using
penetrating siRNA duplexes before Dkk1 treatment. West-
ern blotting of treated cultures demonstrates that only
Daam1 is expressed at detectable levels in these cells, in
agreement with previous reports that Daam1 is the predom-
inant isoform in neurons [29], and that DAAM1-siRNA
treatment potently reduced Daam1 protein expression after
48 hours (Fig. 2B). Given the lack of detectable Daam2
expression, we used a DAAM2 siRNA as an appropriate
control. Cortical neuronal cultures (24 d.i.v.) were then
treated for 3 hours with recombinant Dkk1 protein
(400 ng/mL) or vehicle (PBS) after DAAM1 or DAAM2
silencing. Cells were then fixed, and synapse number was as-
sessed by counting phalloidin-labeled F-actin puncta.
Silencing of DAAM1 or DAAM2 did not affect synapse
homeostasis, as puncta counts were equivalent to untreated
controls. However, Dkk1-driven synapse retraction, as
demonstrated by a substantial reduction in puncta, was
only observed after silencing DAAM2 and was ameliorated
by siRNA knockdown of DAAM1 (Fig. 2C and 2D). These
data indicate that Dkk1-mediated synapse loss occurs
through the activation of the Wnt-PCP pathway in a
Daam1-dependent manner and demonstrates that this mech-
anism is pivotal for synapse loss but not synapse mainte-
nance, as silencing DAAM1 alone had no deleterious
effect on synapse stability.
3.5. Ab-driven, Dkk1-dependent spine loss is mediated by
RhoA/ROCK
Downstream of Daam1 Wnt-PCP regulates actin cyto-
skeletal dynamics through RhoA and ROCK [30,31]. We
therefore investigated whether pharmacological inhibition
of the RhoA/ROCK pathway would inhibit both AbO- and
Dkk1-driven spine losses. Cortical cultures were transfected
with eGFP at 23 d.i.v. and 48 hours later pretreated with the
well-characterized ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, or with
vehicle for 30 minutes, and then with 2 mM AbO for 4 hours
or with 400 ng/mL Dkk1 recombinant protein for 3 hours.
Assessment of dendritic spine linear density showed that
Y-27632 blocked both AbO- and Dkk1-induced spine losses
with similar potency, while Y-27632 alone had no effect on
spine number (Fig. 3A and 3B). Together with the aforemen-
tioned (Fig. 1c–1g and Fig. 2c and 2d), these data provide
strong evidence that Ab synaptotoxicity is dependent on
Dkk1-driven
activation
of
a
Wnt-PCP-Daam1-RhoA/
ROCK pathway.
3.6. Dkk1 drives GluA1 and PSD-95 relocation
Acute Ab exposure causes a reduction in synaptic trans-
mission through the internalization of AMPA (a-amino-3-
hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
acid)
receptors
[32,33], while Dkk1 has been suggested to cause a
removal of PSD-95 from synapses [19]. However, whether
acute exposure to Dkk1 drives the removal of PSD-95
away from dendritic spines and the internalization of
AMPA receptors is not known. To investigate this and deter-
mine whether effects on PSD-95 and GluA1-containing
AMPA receptors could also be blocked by ROCK inhibition,
26-d.i.v. eGFP-expressing cortical neurons were pretreated

s & Dementia 14 (2018) 306–317
310
 with Y-27632 or vehicle and subsequently by Dkk1 for
3 hours. After fixation and immune-labeling for PSD-95
and GluA1, confocal imaging revealed that Dkk1 treatment
causes a significant reduction in the total number of PSD-
95–positive puncta with significantly fewer PSD-95–posi-
tive spines while concurrently increasing PSD-95–immuno-
reactive puncta within dendrites. These effects were blocked
by Y-27632 (Fig. 3C and 3D). Dkk1 did not affect the total
level of GluA1 puncta but did similarly reduce the number
of GluA1-positive spines and increase GluA1 immunolabel-
ing within the dendritic shaft, which was again blocked by
Y-27632 (Fig. 3C and 3E). Dkk1 induces the removal of
PSD-95 and GluA1 proteins from synapses and promotes
their trafficking into dendrites, similar to that observed
with Ab. This also confirms that Dkk1-induced dendritic
spine loss is concomitant with a loss of synapses via a
RhoA/ROCK-dependent mechanism.
3.7. Ab- and Dkk1-induced spine withdrawals are blocked
by fasudil
To confirm the effects of Y-27632 (a hexane carboxamide)
are via ROCK, we selected a second structurally dissimilar
ROCK inhibitor, fasudil (an isoquinoline). Fasudil is one of
the only two ROCK inhibitors approved for clinical use
[34]. eGFP-expressing cortical cultures were pretreated
with 5 mM fasudil or vehicle for 30 minutes and subsequently
with either 2 mM AbO or 400 ng/mL Dkk1 recombinant pro-
tein, fixed and imaged by confocal microscopy. AbO and
Dkk1 both significantly reduced spine number, and the effects

with DAAM1 or DAAM2 Pen-1–coupled siRNA duplexes for 48 hours, harvested, and analyzed by Western blotting for Daam1 and Daam2. Daam1 was detect-
able in untreated cells, whereas Daam2 was not. Daam1-si potently reduced Daam1 protein expression levels. (C and D) Cultures were treated overnight with
DAAM1- or DAAM2-siRNA duplexes. Next day, cells were treated with 400 ng/mL recombinant Dkk1 protein for 3 hours, fixed, and fluorescently labeled with

 of each were again blocked by fasudil (Fig. 4A and 4B), while
fasudil treatment alone, like Y-27632, had little effect on
spine density. These data support our contention that the syn-
aptic effects of both Ab and Dkk1 are dependent on the Wnt-
PCP-RhoA/ROCK pathway and substantiate the synaptopro-
tective properties only very recently attributed to fasudil [35].
Fig. 3. Ab and Dkk1 synaptic effects are ROCK dependent. (A and B) Rat primary cortical neurons were transfected with eGFP at 24 d.i.v. and 48 hours later
treated with Y-27632 or vehicle, and 15 minutes later with 2 mM AbO for 4 hours or 400 ng/mL Dkk1 for 3 hours, fixed, and imaged by confocal microscopy
for the examination of spine morphology. AbO and Dkk1 caused a significant reduction in dendritic spine linear density. Y2763 alone had no significant effect
on spine density, but in combination with AbO and Dkk1, it blocked the effect of both (scale bar 5 5 mM). (C, D, and E) Rat primary 26-d.i.v. neurons expressing
eGFP were treated with Y-27632 and Dkk1, all as mentioned previously (3A). (D) Concurrent with a loss of spine density, Dkk1 caused a significant reduction in
total PSD-95 puncta (Total PSD-95 density/10 mm: control, 5.5 6 0.34; control 1 Y-27632, 6.2 6 0.55; Dkk1, 4.3 6 0.39; Dkk1 1 Y-27632, 6.6 6 0.43). Inter-
estingly, the number of spines containing PSD-95 was also reduced, with a concurrent increase in the density of dendritic PSD-95, following treatment with Dkk1.
This effect was blocked by Y-27632 (% spines containing PSD-95: control, 79.8 6 2.4; control 1 Y-27632, 78.2 6 2.7; Dkk1, 59.1 6 3.7; Dkk1 1 Y-27632,

 3.8. Fasudil rescues Ab-driven cognitive deficits
Fasudil has clinical approval and protects against Ab
synaptotoxicity, which make it a promising candidate for
repositioning for AD. To further assess its usefulness for
this purpose, we examined its ability to protect against
AbO-induced cognitive impairment in vivo using a novel
acute rat model [36]. Despite the predicted low CNS pene-
trance of fasudil [37], both fasudil [38] and its active
metabolite hydroxyfasudil [39] appear to be centrally
active after peripheral administration. Given the paucity
of data concerning brain availability of either compound
and to inform on dosing for in vivo experimentation, we
evaluated brain penetrance of fasudil and hydroxyfasudil.
Each was administered at a range of doses by i.p. injection
to CD1 mice, and levels of each were measured in brain
and plasma by mass spectrometry. Plasma levels of fasudil
were below detection threshold at this time point because
of it being rapidly metabolized into hydroxyfasudil. How-
ever, these data demonstrate that fasudil and hydroxyfasu-
dil are both brain penetrant (Fig. 4C) and that fasudil that
enters the CNS persists there for some considerable time.
Data obtained by the rat in situ brain perfusion technique
also demonstrate that fasudil is brain penetrant with a
plasma-brain ratio of 8.5% at a 10-mg/kg dose (Fig. 4C).
This ratio is better than that of a number of compounds
widely used to treat CNS disorders such as clozapine
(1.1%), haloperidol (1.1%), and diazepam (3.6%) and is
similar to that of donepezil, 12.6% [40], one of the few
drugs currently licensed for AD.
Based on these data, 40 adult female rats of 250–300 g
body weight were administered fasudil (10 mg/kg) or
vehicle (saline), intraperitoneally twice daily for 7 days.
Fig. 4. Fasudil is CNS penetrant and blocks Ab synaptotoxicity and cognitive impairment. (A and B) Rat primary cortical neuronal cultures were transfected
with eGFP at 26 d.i.v. and 48 hours later pretreated with 5 mM fasudil or vehicle for 15 minutes and subsequently treated with AbO or Dkk1 and imaged as
mentioned in Fig. 3A, scale bar 5 5 mM. AbO and Dkk1 caused a significant reduction in dendritic spine linear density, which fasudil fully and significantly
blocked, as shown in (B) (dendritic spine linear density/10 mm: control, 5.8 6 0.41; fasudil, 5.2 6 0.64; AbO, 3.7 6 0.34; AbO 1 fasudil, 6.2 6 0.38; Dkk1,
3.5 6 0.20; Dkk1 1 fasudil, 5.4 6 0.27). (B) Significance determined by ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc t-test. In (B), error bars indicate standard error of the
mean. (C) Male CD1 mice were administered fasudil or hydroxyfasudil at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg, ip, and brain and plasma were collected 20 minutes after
injection. Fasudil and hydroxyfasudil were detected and measured by mass spectrometry. Plasma levels of fasudil were below the threshold of detection at
all doses, and its data points were omitted from the graph. (D and E) 40 young adult female rats were administered 10 mg/kg fasudil, or vehicle, ip, twice daily
for 7 days, and given either a single dose of AbO or vehicle, unilaterally, icv, on day 1. On day 7, all animals were presented with an NOR task, schematized in

controls (E) Error bars in (E) indicate standard deviation. Abbreviations: AbO, amyloid b (1–42) oligomers; Dkk1, Dickkopf-1; NOR, novel object recognition;

 Following the initial i.p. injection, all animals underwent
surgery on day 1 to receive a single intracranial injection
into the left lateral ventricle of either 10 nmol AbO or
vehicle in a volume of 10 mL (at 2.5 mL/min) resulting in
four groups (n 5 10/group). On day 7, all 40 animals were
presented with an NOR task, as previously described [41].
In rats receiving vehicle, the single dose of AbO produced
a marked and highly significant impairment in the NOR
task performance compared with controls. Fasudil alone
had no effect on the NOR task performance but completely
rescued performance deficits due to AbO (Fig. 4C). These
data confirm that peripherally administered fasudil can
block AbO-driven cognitive impairment. Given the support-
ing evidence we presented previously, we propose that fasu-
dil
is
able
to
protect
against
Ab-induced
cognitive
impairment through its ability to antagonize an Ab-activated
Dkk1-Wnt-PCP-Daam1-RhoA/ROCK-dependent pathway
that drives dendritic spine withdrawal and synapse loss.
4. Discussion
Opposing roles for the canonical and noncanonical Wnt-
signaling pathways in synapse homeostasis have been previ-
ously recognized, with canonical Wnt-promoting synapse
formation and stabilization [42] and noncanonical Wnt-
promoting synapse disassembly/pruning [43,44]. Under
normal physiological conditions, both pathways likely act
in a highly regulated and coordinated manner to achieve
appropriate
levels
of
synaptic
plasticity
and
normal
cognitive functioning. Abnormal levels of Ab result in
cognitive impairment and memory deficits by disrupting
these processes.
Our data demonstrate that Ab-driven synapse withdrawal
involves the Dkk1-dependent activation of the Wnt-PCP-
RhoA/ROCK pathway. We show that at nanomolar levels,
oligomeric forms of Ab1–42 regarded to be the most synapto-
toxic form of Ab [45,46], rapidly upregulate neuronal Dkk1
expression leading to dendritic spine retraction and altered
localization of the postsynaptic proteins, PSD-95, and
GluA1, and that these effects are dependent on Daam1 and
ROCK.
It has been postulated that Dkk1 alters synapse stability
predominantly through antagonism of the canonical Wnt-
b-catenin pathway [19], which doubtlessly contributes to
the process given the recognized role of canonical Wnt in
synapse
formation
and
stability
[42,47].
Our
data
significantly advance on this idea, demonstrating that
Dkk1-mediated synapse loss involves the simultaneous and
necessary activation of the Wnt-PCP-RhoA/ROCK pathway.
This is in line with previous reports specifically pointing to a
role of Wnt-PCP in synapse disassembly through the core
PCP component Vangl2 [43,44]. Taking this further, Ab
induction of Dkk1 likely exerts two simultaneous effects
both detrimental to synaptic connectivity, a reduction in
synaptic adherens junction stability due to a reduction in
b-catenin
levels
by
antagonizing
the
canonical
Wnt
pathway and concomitantly allowing activation of Wnt-
PCP that acts on cytoskeletal dynamics to directly drive syn-
apse withdrawal.
We previously reported that Ab, through Dkk1, aber-
rantly activates the JNK/c-Jun arm of Wnt-PCP, which
then drives the expression of genes required for Ab-induced
neuronal death and increases in tau phosphorylation in vitro
and in vivo [4]. Furthermore, we also presented evidence that
the signaling pathways most associated with disease in the
AD brain are shaped, if not driven, by Dkk1-Wnt-PCP
activity [4]. We then now argue that the Ab-driven Dkk1-de-
pendent activation of Wnt-PCP underpins multiple of the
key neuropathological characteristics of AD including,
possibly the most fundamental of all, the loss of synaptic
Fig. 5. Schematic of Ab-driven Wnt-PCP pathway activation. Ab drives a rapid increase in Dkk1 expression. Concomitant with antagonism of canonical Wnt-
b-catenin–signaling Dkk1 then drives the activation of the Wnt-PCP pathway by antagonizing the LRP6-Fzd interaction. We have previously shown that activity
in the JNK/c-Jun arm of Wnt-PCP induces the expression of several identified genes required for Ab-driven increases in tau phosphorylation and neuronal death
to occur. Here, we demonstrate that activity of the Daam1/RhoA/ROCK arm is necessary for Ab-driven synaptotoxicity and that this can be blocked by ROCK
inhibitors Y-27632 or fasudil. Abbreviations: Ab, amyloid b; c-Abl1, c-Abl oncogene 1, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (ABL1); DAAM1, disheveled associated

 connectivity. This concept is depicted schematically in Fig. 5
in which we also indicate the dual effects of Ab induction of
Dkk1, it not only inhibiting the canonical Wnt pathway but
concomitantly
permitting
activation
of
the
Wnt-PCP
pathway.
Although we hold that a dysregulation of Wnt signaling is
likely to be central to AD pathology, work from other
groups, strongly supported by genetic evidence, also clearly
indicates an involvement of other systems and pathways.
The main players that have emerged are immunity/inflam-
mation and endocytosis/autophagy. In addition, the major
tau kinase GSK3 also remains a key player in the disease,
and although it occupies a central position in Wnt signaling,
it is significant in many alternative pathways, particularly in
insulin and p53 signaling that have both been strongly impli-
cated in AD.
Given the above, the fact that the familial AD gene APP
(the parent molecule of Ab) has itself recently been shown
to be a component of the Wnt-PCP co-receptor complex
surely underpins the importance of this pathway in the dis-
ease process [48]. It also indicates that a better understand-
ing of the both the physiological and the pathological roles
of both Ab and APP in this pathway will shed further light
on the mechanism and improve our ability to therapeuti-
cally intervene in a effective manner to slow it down or
even prevent it.
Here, not only do we shed new light on these mechanisms
but also we identify fasudil, a drug that has been approved
for clinical use in Japan and China since 1994 for
cerebrovascular vasospasm, as a strong candidate for reposi-
tioning/repurposing for AD. We assessed the pharmacody-
namics of fasudil and its active metabolite hydroxyfasudil,
showing both have good brain penetrance. Owing to legal
infringements within the pharmaceutical industry, fasudil
has not received the Food and Drug Administration or
European approval. However, in China, it has been used in
a small clinical trial in AD patients in combination with a
second vasodilator, nimodipine. In this study, fasudil was
found to improve cognitive function compared with nimodi-
pine alone [49].
A recent report has shown that ROCK inhibitor, Y-
27632, can reverse Dkk1-induced synapse loss in vivo
[47]. Thus, that fasudil is well tolerated in humans [50]
the data we present here concerning its ability to protect
against Ab synaptotoxicity, to have good brain availability,
and to protect against Ab-induced cognitive impairment,
warrants serious assessment of its utility as a much needed
treatment for AD.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
1. Systematic review: Several decades of medical
research strongly indicate that synapse loss is an
early and key event in Alzheimer’s disease and that
this is driven by soluble oligomeric forms of the
amyloid b (Ab) peptide. However, the molecular
mechanisms underlying Ab synaptotoxicity are not
clear, nor has any medication been identified that
can halt this.
2. Interpretation: We present strong evidence that Ab-
driven synapse loss is dependent on a branch of Wnt
signaling known as the planar cell polarity pathway.
In elucidating this mechanism, we found that syn-
apses, and cognition in rats, are protected from
the effects of Ab by a drug in clinical use, fasudil.
3. Future directions: These findings will allow a yet
more detailed understanding of the mechanisms
controlling the synaptic effects of Ab to be deter-
mined. Importantly, they indicate that fasudil,
which is safe in humans and readily enters the brain,
is
a
very
promising
candidate
treatment
for
Alzheimer’s disease.
