Abstract
Background
Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) is associated with early child health; its longer-term benefits
for child development remain inconclusive. We examine the associations between EBF,
HIV exposure, and other maternal/child factors and the cognitive and emotional-behavioural
development of children aged 7–11 y.
Methods and Findings
The Vertical Transmission Study (VTS) supported EBF in HIV-positive and HIV-negative
women; between 2012 and 2014, HIV-negative VTS children (332 HIV exposed, 574 HIV
unexposed) were assessed in terms of cognition (Kaufman Assessment Battery for Chil-
dren Second Edition [KABC-II]), executive function (Developmental Neuropsychological
Assessment Second Edition [NEPSY-II]), and emotional-behavioural functioning (parent-
reported Child Behaviour Checklist, [CBCL]). We developed population means by combin-
ing the VTS sample with 629 same-aged HIV-negative children from the local demographic
platform. For each outcome, we split the VTS sample into scores above or at/below each
population mean and modelled each outcome using logistic regression analyses, overall

Funding: The Africa Centre for Health and
Population Studies, University of KwaZulu-Natal,
South Africa, is supported by a core grant from the
Wellcome Trust (050524). The original Vertical
Transmission Study was funded separately
 and stratified by child sex. There was no demonstrated effect of EBF on overall cognitive
functioning. EBF was associated with fewer conduct disorders overall (adjusted odds ratio
[aOR] 0.44 [95% CI 0.3–0.7], p � 0.01), and there was weak evidence of better cognition in
boys who had been exclusively breastfed for 2–5 mo versus �1 mo (Learning subscale
aOR 2.07 [95% CI 1.0–4.3], p = 0.05). Other factors associated with better child cognition
were higher maternal cognitive ability (aOR 1.43 [95% CI 1.1–1.9], p = 0.02, Sequential;
aOR 1.74 [95% CI 1.3–2.4], p < 0.001, Planning subscales) and crèche attendance (aOR
1.96 [95% CI 1.1–3.5], p = 0.02, Sequential subscale). Factors positively associated with
executive function were home stimulation (aOR 1.36 [95% CI 1.0–1.8], p = 0.04, Auditory
Attention; aOR 1.35 [95% CI 1.0–1.8], p = 0.05, Response Set) and crèche (aOR 1.74 [95%
CI 1.0–3.0], p = 0.05, Animal Sorting). Maternal mental health problems and parenting
stress were associated with increased emotional-behavioural problems on the total CBCL
(aOR 2.44 [95% CI 1.3–4.6], p = 0.01; aOR 7.04 [95% CI 4.2–11.9], p < 0.001, respectively).
Maternal HIV status was not associated with any outcomes in the overall cohort. Limitations
include the nonrandomised study design and lack of maternal mental health assessment at
the child’s birth.
Conclusions
EBF was associated with fewer than average conduct disorders and weakly associated
with improved cognitive development in boys. Efforts to improve stimulation at home,
reduce maternal stress, and enable crèche attendance are likely to improve executive func-
tion and emotional-behavioural development of children.
Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• The benefits of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) in early life are well established and include
optimal nutrition and protection from infectious diseases.
• The longer-term benefits of EBF on child development and behaviour are less clear, and
studies in low-income settings have shown conflicting results depending on the design
of the study and whether other factors known to influence development, such as HIV
exposure, have been taken into account.
• There is a dearth of evidence examining the development of HIV-uninfected children
born to HIV-infected mothers and whether these children are disadvantaged compared
to those born to HIV-uninfected mothers.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• This study was established in 2012 to investigate the development (cognitive and emotion-
behaviour) of 1,536 HIV-negative children, born to HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected

 mothers, in rural South Africa, taking into account a range of current and early life factors
known to be associated with child development.
• Duration of EBF was associated with a reduction in conduct disorders in girls and boys,
but there was no association with cognitive development in the overall sample, when
allowing for other factors. Maternal intelligence quotient (IQ) was strongly associated
with children’s later cognitive development.
• Children born to HIV-infected mothers performed as well as the children born to HIV-
uninfected mothers.
What Do the Findings Mean?
• Promoting, protecting, and supporting EBF may result in fewer conduct disorders, in
addition to the established benefits of improved nutrition and reduced morbidity and
mortality.
• Reducing conduct disorders is important because they may lead to aggressive or disrup-
tive behaviours and are associated with an increase in later criminal behaviour and poor
long-term mental health and academic achievement.
Introduction
There is strong evidence that exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for 6 mo, as recommended by the
World Health Organization (WHO) [1], optimises infant nutrition and substantially decreases
mortality and morbidity from infectious diseases [2,3]. The relationship between EBF and cog-
nitive development is less clear [4,5], although studies in high-income settings [6–8], a rando-
mised trial from Belarus [9], and a recent study from Brazil [10] have shown positive
associations. A large systematic review showed conflicting results depending on the study
design and rigour, as well as the number of factors adjusted for [4]. The few studies from
resource-limited settings were almost twice as likely to find no association. This suggests that
confounding variables, including socioeconomic status and maternal cognitive ability, affect
the choice to breastfeed and the positive effects found. Measuring the duration of EBF accu-
rately is challenging because of factors related to definition, timing, and duration of recall
[11,12], and many of the studies were limited by poor documentation of breastfeeding patterns
[13,14]. Further limitations included small sample sizes [15,16] and predominantly Caucasian
populations, with only one small study from Africa [16], which found no association with cog-
nitive development but some advantages for child behaviour in breastfed infants. There was no
evidence from HIV-prevalent areas where the long-term effect of EBF on child development
remains unquantified.
Studies exploring the link between EBF and later development have focused on core cogni-
tive development, sometimes termed the intelligence quotient (IQ). However, higher-order
cognitive function, termed executive function, is critical for later development, particularly the
ability to function in society [17]. Executive function coordinates and controls information
processing, which is important for a child’s ability to manage emotions and behaviour, to fol-
low rules, to concentrate, and to form friendships. Thus, executive function influences

 educational and social success [18]. Executive function is susceptible to environmental influ-
ences and therefore an important intervention target [19]. In addition, few breastfeeding stud-
ies have examined emotional-behavioural development, an important outcome affected by
early life factors, which predicts later educational achievement.
The Vertical Transmission Study (VTS) (2001–2006) supported HIV-positive and HIV-
negative women to practice EBF in a rural area of South Africa before antiretroviral treatment
became available [20], providing the first evidence that EBF reduced the risk of postnatal HIV
transmission [21] and was associated with significant benefits for children’s health and growth
until up to 2 y of age [22,23] (Registration: NCT01948557, National Institute of Health, Clini-
calTrials.gov). Here we investigate the association between EBF, HIV exposure, and other early
and current life factors and later cognitive development, executive function, and emotional-
behavioural development in VTS children now aged 7 to 11 y. We accounted for maternal cog-
nitive function, home stimulation, crèche attendance, and maternal/caregiver stress and mental
health and hypothesized that EBF would result in improved longer-term development in chil-
dren, despite exposure to HIV and poverty.
Methods
Ethics permission for this study was granted by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee
(BREC), University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (BF184/12). Women were contacted by
telephone or a home visit to ask if they would be interested in this study. Those who agreed
were then visited by a field worker who explained, and provided written details of, the study
and obtained written informed consent from the mother and primary caregiver (if this was not
the child’s mother).
The VTS, a nonrandomised, prospective, intervention cohort study, was implemented
between 2001 and 2006 from the Africa Centre for Population Health, which also hosts a
Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) platform [24]. This lay-counsellor, home-based inter-
vention was designed to support mothers to practice EBF for the first 180 d of life [25]. Between
2012 and 2014, we re-enrolled HIV-negative children (aged 7–11 y) born to HIV-positive
(“exposed”) and HIV-negative (“unexposed”) mothers from the VTS cohort; HIV-infected
children were not re-enrolled because they have different developmental trajectories [26].
To establish a comparative population mean for the developmental outcomes (in the
absence of appropriate normative data for validated cognitive assessments), we assessed 630
(485 unexposed; 145 exposed) same-aged HIV-negative children from the DSS, not included in
the VTS, and combined these with the VTS sample. Mothers in the DSS group were exposed to
the same antenatal care at local clinics, including messages regarding HIV and infant feeding,
but not to the home-based intervention to support EBF. We aimed to rerecruit all available
1,289 VTS children meeting the inclusion criteria, of whom 935 (75%) were enrolled and 906
(70%) fully assessed. To establish a robust population mean, we used the population platform
of the Africa Centre for Population Health surveillance to identify all 1,226 resident children
who were matched for age and HIV exposure to the VTS children but had not been exposed to
the VTS intervention. Of these, 844 children met eligibility criteria, 657 (77%) enrolled, and
630 (75%) completed assessments.
This analysis includes the developmental outcomes of the VTS children, for all of whom we
have accurate data on infant feeding and HIV exposure; their outcomes are related to the popu-
lation means. Children were enrolled if both the mother and child were alive, the child was a
resident in the research area, the mother and child’s current HIV status was known, and, for
the DSS children, if the HIV status during pregnancy was known, the mother received

 antenatal services in the study community, and the maternal-held child Road-to-Health Card
was available.
Outcome Measures
Child cognition.
To assess the cognitive development, we used the full Kaufman Assess-
ment Battery for Children (KABC-II) [27]. This has four subscales, each with subtests, which
measure audio and visual memory and memory span (“Sequential Processing”); spatial and
visual perception, reasoning, and maths ability (“Simultaneous Processing”); focused and selec-
tive attention and the ability to store auditory and visual stimuli simultaneously (“Learning
Ability”); and decision-making ability (“Planning”). There is an additional subtest to assess rea-
soning and language development (“Riddles”). After discussion with experts, including the
authors of the KABC-II, to be more culturally appropriate, we substituted a subtest in the
Learning Ability subscale (“Atlantis”/ “Atlantis delayed” replaced “Rebus”/ “Rebus delayed”).
The KABC-II has been used in low-middle-income countries and validated in Africa [28]
(Cronbach’s α = 0.75).
Child executive function.
Three subtests from the executive function domain of NEP-
SY-II [29] were used: Animal Sorting (inhibition, planning, and cognitive flexibility), Auditory
Attention (vigilance and selective/ sustained auditory attention), and Response Set (inhibition
of previously learned stimuli).
All subtest raw scores for both NEPSY-II and KABC-II were transformed to scaled scores,
according to the child’s age, using standardised tables published by the test developers.
Child emotional and behavioural functioning.
We used the parent-reported Child
Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) [30], which has been validated across multiple cultural settings
[31]. This includes 120-items in two subscales—“Internalising disorders” and “Externalising
disorders”—and a composite Total score. A high score indicates more problems. Scores were
normed using multicultural Rating-to-Score norming software to produce normed t-tests for
the Total score, the two subscales, and the six Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) disor-
ders: affective, anxious, somatic, attention deficit hyperactivity, oppositional, and conduct dis-
orders (Cronbach’s α = 0.94).
Maternal Mental Health Measures
All psychometric measures had been previously used in the population; clinical algorithms for
depression and anxiety were used.
• Depression and anxiety: measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression
(PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scales [32,33], identifying
depressive or anxiety symptoms with symptom frequency and severity.
• Alcohol: the WHO Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-6) assessed alcohol
use and severity [34].
• Parenting stress: measured using the Parenting Stress Index Short Form (PSI-36), a 36-item
scale measuring stress related to the parental role, the parent–child relationship, and the
degree to which the parent finds the child difficult [35].
The home environment was assessed using a locally adapted version of the Home Observa-
tion for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) inventory [36]. Maternal cognitive ability
was assessed using the Standard Raven’s Progressive Matrix [37].

 Data Collection
Data were collected over three visits between September 2012 and September 2014. Study con-
sent was obtained at Visit 1, current socioeconomic and health data and mothers’ mental
health and cognitive ability at Visit 2, and children’s cognition and executive function at Visit
3. When the mother was not the primary caregiver, mental health assessments were completed
by the child’s primary caregiver. Assessments were conducted by graduate-level research assis-
tants with 3–5 y of child developmental assessment experience. The median number of days
between Visit 2 and Visit 3 was 18 d.
Statistical Analyses
Analyses were based on data extracted on 30 October 2014 and conducted using STATA ver-
sion 13. For each outcome, we calculated a population mean from all VTS and DSS children
and then created a binary indicator by splitting the VTS group into those scoring above or at/
below the mean. For the HOME assessment and Raven’s score, we created a low/high indicator
consisting of equal-size groups by splitting the VTS sample based on their median. In the VTS,
daily feeding data were collected at weekly intervals. We defined EBF as the total number of
days in the first 6 mo that the child received only breastmilk and then divided this number by
30, into months, irrespective of whether the days were sequential. We previously reported [25]
that approximately 40% of VTS women interrupted EBF at some point in the first 6 mo, mostly
by giving water or formula milk, of whom approximately 60% returned to EBF within 2 d. We
considered that the total number of days of EBF in the first 6 mo was more likely to have an
impact on child development than whether the days were sequential or not, and we did not
wish to exclude children who had received breastmilk for nearly all 180 d except for 1 or 2 d
when they received breastmilk and other fluids. Based on the existing literature and theoretical
and conceptual reasoning, we identified relevant factors, including child, maternal, early life,
socioeconomic, and household factors related to child development; we did not apply any step-
wise regression techniques. For selection of the most relevant socioeconomic variable, we used
principal components analysis to identify the top variables that explained the overall variance.
We modelled each of the outcomes using complete case logistic regression analyses, accounting
for intramother correlation (for twins). We included child sex, child age, birth order, and
maternal age; early life factors including birthweight, maternal HIV status during pregnancy,
months of EBF, urban/rural residence, ownership of a fridge (wealth indicator), maternal edu-
cation, and whether the mother was the main income provider at the time of the child’s birth;
and other factors including maternal current HIV status, cognitive ability, mental health and
parenting stress, crèche exposure, current indicators of perception of household wealth, and
HOME assessment score. Sex differences in cognitive development exist at the primary school
age [38], and we also estimated sex-stratified logistic regression models, using the same
outcomes.
We explored several approaches to modelling the developmental data, including continuous
outcomes (see S1 Table) and upper versus lower quintiles, as well as other methods of catego-
rising the EBF data, including cumulative, sequential, days of EBF, and ever/never EBF, but the
results were not substantially different.
Results
The Sample
By end of the VTS follow-up in September 2006, when children were aged 2 y, 1,289 HIV-nega-
tive children were alive, of whom 941 were eligible for re-enrolment and 906 were assessed

 (Fig 1). Compared to HIV-unexposed children, exposed children were more likely to have a
mother who was older and the main income provider, less likely to have been exclusively
breastfed until 6 mo of age and to have attended crèche, and more likely to have a primary care-
giver with a current mental health disorder (Table 1). Compared to children included in the
current analysis, the 383 VTS children excluded were more likely to have a younger HIV-unin-
fected mother with more years of education at the time of pregnancy and were less likely to
have a low birthweight (Table 1).

 Cognitive Outcomes
None of the cognitive development measurements were significantly associated with EBF or
maternal HIV status in adjusted analyses (Table 2). In multivariable analyses, the only variable
significantly positively associated with performance on all cognitive subscales was maternal
cognitive ability (measured using the Standard Raven’s Progressive Matrix) (Table 2). Boys
were approximately 30% less likely than girls to score above the mean in the Sequential Pro-
cessing subscale, which tests audio and visual memory and memory span (adjusted odds ratio
[aOR] 0.71 [95% CI 0.5–0.9], p = 0.03), whilst children who had attended crèche were almost
twice as likely to score above the mean (aOR 1.96 [95% CI 1.1–3.5], p = 0.02). Children who
were older at assessment performed worse on Riddles (aOR 0.40 [95% CI 0.2–1.0], p = 0.05).

Footnotes apply to Tables 1–9. Bold numbers indicate a p-value < 0.05
a “Birth” indicates that the variable relates to when the child was born as opposed to the time of follow-up at 7–11 y; “Current” indicates that the variable
relates to the time of follow-up in this study when the child was aged between 7–11 y.
b Low birthweight was defined as <2.5 kg.
c Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for this analysis was defined as the number of days when the child only received breastmilk and no other fluids or solids;
the total number of days was divided by 30 to categorise the number of months of EBF.
d Crèche is a noncompulsory, nongovernmental preschool; children start primary school in South Africa at the age of 7 y.
e A provisional depression diagnosis determined by the PHQ-9 diagnostic algorithm required at least one Criteria A (mood and loss of interest) and 2–4
Criteria B (weight, sleep, agitation/retardation, fatigue, guilt, concentration, and suicidality) for more than half the days. A provisional anxiety diagnosis
required meeting Criteria A (anxiety) and �3 Criteria B (worry, restlessness, fatigue, concentration, irritability, and sleep) for more than half the days.
f Child age and birth order are not shown for the excluded children, some of whom died or were lost to follow-up. Other variables omitted for the excluded
children are factors measured since the VTS cohort, including current perception of wealth, attendance at crèche, caregiver mental health, and parenting
stress.

 Executive Function
None of the executive function measures were significantly associated with EBF duration,
maternal HIV, or child sex (Table 3). Compared to children whose mothers were aged less
than 20 y, those with mothers aged 20–29 y at their birth were almost twice as likely to score
above the mean on the Animal Sorting subtest (aOR 1.82 [95% CI 1.2–2.8], p = 0.01), as were
children whose mother was the main income provider during their infancy (aOR 1.81 [95% CI
1.0–3.1], p = 0.03) and those who had attended crèche (aOR 1.74 [95% CI 1.0–3.0], p = 0.05).
For the Auditory Attention subtest, compared to children aged 8 y, those aged 9 and 10 y were
over three (aOR 3.38 [95% CI 1.6–7.3], p = 0.01) and four times (aOR 4.56 [95% CI 2.1–9.9],
p < 0.001) more likely to perform above average, respectively. Children with better stimulation
at home (i.e., a HOME score above the median) were more likely to perform above the mean in
the Auditory Attention (aOR 1.36 [95% CI 1.0–1.8], p = 0.04) and Response Set subtests (aOR
1.35 [95% CI 1.0–1.8], p = 0.05).
Emotional and Behavioural Problems
Being born in an urban environment and having a primary caregiver with high parenting stress
were associated with more emotional and behavioural problems (higher scores on the Internal-
ising and Externalising subscales and the Total score) (urban Total score: aOR 1.62 [95% CI
1.2–2.2], p = 0.01; parenting stress Total score: aOR 7.04 [95% CI 4.2–11.9], p < 0.001). Chil-
dren whose caregiver had a current mental health disorder were more likely to score above the
mean for Internalising (aOR 1.92 [95% CI 1.1–3.4], p = 0.03) and Total scores (aOR 2.44 [95%
CI 1.3–4.6], p = 0.01) (Table 4). Boys were more likely to score above the mean for Internalising
(aOR 1.53 [95% CI 1.1–2.0], p = 0.01), whilst children who attended a crèche were approxi-
mately twice as likely to score above the mean in Externalising (aOR 2.15 [95% CI 1.2–3.9],
p = 0.01) and Total scores (aOR 1.96 [95% CI 1.0–3.8], p = 0.05). EBF and the mother’s antena-
tal or current HIV status were not significantly associated with Externalising, Internalising, or
Total CBCL score.
Exploring the six DSM disorders (Table 5), EBF was significantly associated with lower
scores (fewer problems) for conduct disorders. Those who were exclusively breastfed for 6 mo
compared to 1 mo or less were approximately half as likely to score above the mean for conduct
disorders (aOR 0.44 [95% CI 0.3–0.7], p < 0.01). Caregiver mental health and stress were asso-
ciated with increases in all six disorders. Urban residence was associated with increases in
somatic, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and oppositional problems. Boys
were less likely to be anxious (aOR 0.64 [95% CI 0.5–0.9], p < 0.01) but more likely to have
somatic (aOR 1.34 [95% CI 1.0–1.8], p = 0.05) or oppositional (aOR 1.52 [95% CI 1.1–2.2],
p = 0.02) disorders.
Outcomes Stratified by Sex (Tables 6–9)
Contrary to the finding in the overall cohort, boys, but not girls, who were exclusively breastfed
for more than 1 mo were twice as likely as those who were exclusively breastfed for a very short
period to score above the mean for Learning Ability (aOR 2.07 [95% CI 1.0–4.3], p = 0.05) and
half as likely to score above the mean for Externalising problems (aOR 0.48 [95% CI 0.2–1.0],
p = 0.05) (Tables 7 and 9). However, girls who were exclusively breastfed for less than 1 mo
were more likely to score above average on Auditory Attention compared to those who were
exclusively breastfed longer. The finding of an association between maternal cognitive ability
and improved performance on all four cognitive subscales in the overall cohort held for boys
but not for girls. Boys whose mother’s cognitive ability was above the median score (Standard
Raven’s Progressive Matrix) were twice as likely to score above average for the cognitive

 subscales (e.g., Planning subscale aOR 2.79 [95% CI 1.8–4.4], p � 0.001). Maternal HIV status
was not significantly associated with cognitive development, executive function, or emotional-
behavioural problems overall. However, boys whose mothers became infected with HIV after
pregnancy were more likely to score below the mean on the Planning Ability subscale than
those whose mothers remained HIV negative (aOR 0.55 [95% CI 0.3–1.0], p = 0.05). Boys born
to HIV-positive mothers, compared to those born to HIV-negative mothers, were more likely
to score above average for reasoning and language ability (Riddles subtest) (aOR 1.92 [95% CI
1.1–3.3], p = 0.02). For girls, being born to an HIV-positive mother was associated with scoring
below the mean for Planning Ability (aOR 0.53 [95% CI 0.3–0.9], p = 0.01) and below the
mean (fewer problems) for Externalising (aOR 0.56 [95% CI 0.2–0.9], p = 0.03) and Total (aOR
0.56 [95% CI 0.3–1.0], p = 0.03) CBCL scores.
Girls, but not boys, with a normal birthweight were significantly more likely to score above
the mean for Learning Ability (aOR 2.40 [95% CI 1.2–5.0], p = 0.02) and Planning Ability
(aOR 2.04 [95% CI 1.1–3.9], p = 0.03) and below the mean (fewer problems) for Total CBCL
score (aOR 0.42 [95% CI 0.2–0.9], p = 0.02). Boys of a birth order of five or more were less
likely than firstborns to score above average on Animal Sorting (inhibition, planning, and cog-
nitive flexibility) (aOR 0.40 [95% CI 0.2–1.0], p = 0.04); girls of a birth order of five or more
were significantly more likely to have a lower Externalising CBCL score (aOR 0.38 [95% CI
0.2–0.9], p = 0.03).

When the association was significant, the OR and aOR are in bold (because of rounding the confidence intervals sometimes overlap with 1.0). ORs are
based on bivariate logistic regression of the outcome on the covariate. AORs are based on multivariate logistic regression on the outcomes including all
covariates. Animal Sorting: measures inhibition, planning, cognitive flexibility. Auditory Attention: measures vigilance, selective/ sustained auditory
attention. Response Set: measures inhibition of previously learned stimuli. MC-HOME: Middle Childhood HOME

 In this stratified analysis, the associations between maternal education and cognitive out-
comes and HOME scores and executive function held for girls but not for boys. Likewise,
girls were approximately three times more likely to score above the median for higher emo-
tional-behavioural problems if their mothers had a mental health problem (Total CBCL aOR
3.28 [95% CI 1.4–8.0], p = 0.01) or high parenting stress (Total CBCL 4.63 [2.1–10.1],
p < 0.001).
In the full model, interactions between sex and EBF were significant for Conduct (p = 0.02)
and CBCL Internalising (p = 0.02) outcomes and marginally significant for Learning (p = 0.07)
and Auditory Attention (p = 0.08).
In summary, while duration of EBF was not associated with child cognitive development or
executive function in the overall sample (including girls and boys), it was associated with fewer
conduct disorders, and, when stratified by sex, there was weak evidence of improved cognitive
development in boys.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study examining EBF, HIV-exposure, and child cognition,
executive function, and emotional-behavioural outcomes at primary school age in Africa.
Our finding that duration of EBF was associated with fewer conduct disorders has signifi-
cant implications. Conduct disorders lead to aggressive or disruptive behaviours that interfere

When the association was significant, the OR and aOR are in bold (because of rounding, the confidence intervals sometimes overlap with 1.0). ORs are
based on bivariate logistic regression of the outcome on the covariate. AORs are based on multivariate logistic regression on the outcomes including all
covariates
The CBCL includes 120-items in two subscales: “Internalising disorders” and “Externalising disorders,” and a composite Total score. A high score
indicates more problems. MC-HOME: Middle Childhood HOME

 with learning and peer relationships, in turn leading to low self-esteem and further behavioural
problems [39]. Conduct disorders in childhood are associated with an increase in violent crimi-
nal behaviour and poor long-term mental health and academic achievement in later life [40].
While to our knowledge there have been no formal analyses of the economic costs of conduct
disorders in low-middle-income countries, the evidence from carefully conducted studies in
high-income countries is that the costs are enormous [41]. For example, a report from the
United Kingdom stated that the total cost of crime attributable to people who had a conduct
disorder in childhood was estimated to be £60 billion per annum [42]. Given these costs to
individuals, families, and society, it is highly relevant that this study has shown EBF to be asso-
ciated with reduced likelihood of conduct disorders at this critical stage of development. Fur-
ther, for boys, a longer EBF duration was weakly associated with a doubling of the odds of
better cognitive development on the Learning subscale, which assesses ability for maintaining
focused attention while coding and storing complex auditory and visual stimuli simultaneously
and generating strategies to learn efficiently. Identifying potential strategies to improve the life
chances of boys is important, and, in our context, EBF appears to be associated with a longer-
term advantage for boys. There is increasing evidence that some groups of children are more

When the association was significant, the OR and aOR are in bold (because of rounding, the confidence intervals sometimes overlap with 1.0). AORs are based on multivariate
logistic regression on the outcomes including all covariates. Sequential Processing: measures audio and visual memory and memory span. Simultaneous Processing: measures
spatial and visual perception, reasoning, and maths ability. Learning Ability: measures focused and selective attention and ability to store auditory and visual stimuli simultaneously.
Planning: measures decision-making ability. Riddles: measures reasoning and language development. Animal Sorting: measures inhibition, planning, and cognitive flexibility.
Auditory Attention: measures vigilance and selective/sustained auditory attention. Response Set: measures inhibition of previously learned stimuli. MC-HOME: Middle Childhood

 susceptible to the effects of negative rearing and, importantly, that they may benefit more from
the effects of positive rearing and interventions. This is known as the “differential susceptibility
hypothesis” [42]. Boys may be more susceptible in a number of domains of development to the
effects of negative rearing—for example, in language development [43,44]—and therefore, in
line with our findings, may benefit more from early EBF.
The finding that EBF did not have an effect on children’s cognitive development overall is
in accord with studies from other resource-limited settings that also found no association [4],
including studies in India (n = 514, aged 9–10 y), China (n = 442, aged 3 y), Malaysia
(n = 1,394, aged 9 y), Chile (n = 784, aged 5.5 y), and the Philippines (n = 1,984, aged 8.5 and
11.5 y), although these studies did not stratify by sex.
An important strength of this study is the investigation of a wide range of key determinants
of child development. In our cohort, maternal cognitive ability was strongly positively associ-
ated with children’s performance across all cognitive subscales, but not with executive function,
although higher maternal cognitive ability was associated with improved performance on the
Planning subscale, which assesses ability to focus attention, make decisions, and apply working
memory, abilities considered to reflect executive function [27]. Interestingly, while having
attended a crèche was associated with improvement in children’s cognitive development
(sequential scores that depend on practice, on which boys scored particularly low) at the pri-
mary school age, it was independently associated with poorer behaviour, with similar associa-
tions found for children born in urban and rural settings. This apparent paradox in relation to
crèche exposure is consistent with data from high-income countries [45].
Executive function is a high-order cognitive function that coordinates and controls informa-
tion processing [18]. It is critical in enabling a child to successfully integrate into environments

 such as school [46]. We found a positive association between executive function and better
stimulation at home, older maternal age, and a mother who was the main income provider at
the time of the child’s birth. These findings are in accord with evidence suggesting that execu-
tive function is susceptible to environmental factors [47]. Executive function is increasingly
thought of as the core ingredients (creativity, flexibility, self-control, and discipline) that will
determine a child’s success in life. There is evidence that executive function is negatively
affected by stress, emotions, poor physical fitness, and childhood obesity [39]. Encouragingly, a
growing body of evidence suggests that simple, low-cost interventions such as noncomputer-
ized games, aerobics, martial arts, and mindfulness may support improvements in executive
function [19].
Our finding that poor maternal mental health and high parenting stress, measured at the
time of the child assessments, were associated with increased emotional-behavioural problems
in children was unsurprising but useful to quantify in an African setting. The link between
parental mental health and child behaviour outcomes is well-established, with children of
depressed, anxious, or highly stressed mothers known to be at increased risk of psychological
and behavioural problems [48,49].
There is a dearth of evidence examining the developmental trajectories of HIV-exposed
children, in particular longitudinal studies including HIV-unexposed controls. A recent sys-
tematic review [26] examining HIV exposure and child development found only 11 studies
(1,591 children aged 0–18 y) and showed that HIV-exposed children are disadvantaged com-
pared to their HIV-unexposed peers, in particular in emotional-behavioural and, to a lesser
extent, cognitive development. However, results are not consistent across research settings or
age groups, with most of the current evidence being based on small samples with wide

 heterogeneity in outcome measures [26]. Our results, based on a large sample of children
including HIV-unexposed controls suggest that, overall, HIV-exposed children performed as
well as HIV-unexposed children in the domains examined and that the findings of other small
studies may be overstated.
Limitations include the nonrandomised study design of the original intervention, the lack of
maternal mental health measurement at the child’s birth, and no assessment of cognition or
emotional/behavioural problems at earlier time points in the children’s lives. Infections of the
developing brain and childhood malnutrition also affect later cognitive ability but were not
included in the analyses. In addition, caution must be taken in interpreting the sex-stratified
models, as examining subgroup effects increases uncertainty and is more likely to produce
larger effect estimates. Further, because of the complexities in measuring cognitive and execu-
tive function and the need to model each of the outcomes separately, multiple tests were used,
and there may be some false positive significant results. However, our results are in line with
findings from other studies.
Strengths include a large cohort of HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed children, population
normal values, adjustment for a wide range of confounders including current maternal IQ, and
a battery of culturally appropriate developmental assessments including executive function and
behavioural outcomes. A unique strength in this study is the accurate documentation of daily
EBF data. Both HIV-positive and HIV-negative women had high rates of EBF, with few breast
health problems, likely due to the quality of lay breastfeeding counselling [25,50]. Given that all
women received intensive support, it is possible that this may have limited our ability to detect
differences between EBF and non-EBF children.
In conclusion, while EBF was not significantly associated with cognitive development at the
primary-school age, there was an association between EBF and a reduction in conduct disor-
ders and, for boys, weak evidence of positive associations both in aspects of cognitive develop-
ment and behavioural problems more generally. Given the number of adverse factors in these
families’ environments, including poverty and high HIV prevalence, the fact that these benefits
were evident into the crucial early school years is important. Child outcomes were associated
with a range of other key factors. While core cognitive development was principally associated
with maternal cognitive abilities, executive function was associated with a number of modifi-
able environmental factors including home stimulation and crèche attendance. Child’s emo-
tional development was largely associated with caregiver mental health. These findings
highlight a number of avenues for potential interventions.
