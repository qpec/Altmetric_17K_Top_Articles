SUMMARY
CNS injury often severs axons. Scar tissue that forms
locally at the lesion site is thought to block axonal
regeneration, resulting in permanent functional defi-
cits. We report that inhibiting the generation of prog-
eny by a subclass of pericytes led to decreased
fibrosis and extracellular matrix deposition after spi-
nal cord injury in mice. Regeneration of raphespinal
and corticospinal tract axons was enhanced and
sensorimotor function recovery improved following
spinal cord injury in animals with attenuated peri-
cyte-derived scarring. Using optogenetic stimula-
tion, we demonstrate that regenerated corticospinal
tract axons integrated into the local spinal cord
circuitry below the lesion site. The number of re-
generated axons correlated with improved sensori-
motor function recovery. In conclusion, attenuation
of pericyte-derived fibrosis represents a promising
therapeutic approach to facilitate recovery following
CNS injury.
INTRODUCTION
Major obstacles blocking axonal regeneration after injury include
scar formation, a long-lasting inflammatory response, proteogly-
cans, and myelin debris (Cregg et al., 2014; Silver et al., 2014; Yiu
and He, 2006). Reactive astrocytes making up the glial scar have
long been considered one of the main barriers for axonal re-
growth (Cafferty et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2015; Yiu and He, 2006),
although this is still debated (Anderson et al., 2016; Hara et al.,
2017; Silver, 2016). Less attention has been given to the fibrotic,
or stromal, compartment of the scar.
Fibrotic scar tissue formation by a subset of perivascular cells,
termed type A pericytes, is required for regaining tissue integrity,
but creates a scar core of fibroblast-like cells and dense extra-
cellular matrix (Go
¨ ritz et al., 2011). Previous attempts to remove
or modify specific extracellular matrix molecules have shown po-
tential to improve axonal regeneration (Brazda and Mu
¨ ller, 2009;
Fitch and Silver, 2008). However, there are many different extra-
cellular matrix proteins deposited in the fibrotic scar, and they
often have complex, context-dependent functions and cannot
easily be categorized as axon growth promoting or inhibiting
(Condic and Lemons, 2002). The large number of inhibitory
cues present in the scar makes molecule-specific targeting stra-
tegies impractical.
The identification of type A pericytes as the origin of fibroblast-
like cells found in fibrotic scar tissue in the injured spinal cord
(Go
¨ ritz et al., 2011) enabled us in the current study to selectively
reduce pericyte-derived scarring to assess its influence on
axonal regeneration and functional recovery. We report that
significantly more descending axons grow through the lesion
site in the injured spinal cord when pericyte-derived fibrosis is
moderately reduced, regenerating axons synaptically integrate
below the lesion and functional recovery is improved. This iden-
tifies type A pericytes as a target for the development of thera-
pies to promote axonal regeneration after CNS injury.
RESULTS
Inhibiting the Generation of Progeny by Type A Pericytes
Efficiently Reduces Extracellular Matrix Deposition and
Alters Scar Composition in the Injured Spinal Cord
We used Glast-CreERT2 transgenic mice carrying a ROSA26-
YFP reporter allele to genetically label type A pericytes and their
progeny forming the fibrotic scar following spinal cord injury
(Go
¨ ritz et al., 2011). As previously established, following injury,
inhibition of type A pericyte proliferation through cell-specific
deletion of floxed KRas in mice with HRas and NRas null alleles
by tamoxifen-induced genetic recombination with CreERT2 (we
refer to these mice as Glast-Rasless) reduces fibrotic scar tissue
formation (Figures 1A and S1A–S1L) in a recombination-depen-
dent manner (Go
¨ ritz et al., 2011).
Two weeks after dorsal hemisection injuries, we found that
3/12 tamoxifen-injected Glast-Rasless mice showed highly effi-
cient recombination levels, leading to complete block of fibrotic
scar formation and failure to close the injury site. We refer to mice
with this phenotype as Tam-tissue defect (Tam-def). The re-
maining 9/12 tamoxifen-injected Glast-Rasless mice displayed
intermediate levels of recombination. We refer to mice with this

 phenotype as Tam. Tam animals had re-established tissue integ-
rity but presented reduced fibrotic scar density in comparison
with control mice of identical genotype injected with vehicle
(hereafter referred to as vehicle animals). Vehicle animals pre-
sented dense PDGFRb+ fibrotic scar cores (Figures 1B–1D and
S1M–S1R).
We next characterized the gene expression associated with
type A pericyte-derived scarring, by RNA sequencing. Using
the Glast-Rasless line (Figure 1A), we compared whole lesion
segments from vehicle- and tamoxifen-treated animals 2 weeks
after spinal cord dorsal hemisection. We identified 1,099 genes
that were differentially expressed (false discovery rate [FDR]-
adjusted p < 0.05, fold change > ± 1.5) (Figure S2A; Tables
S1 and S2). In line with the reduction of fibrotic scar tissue,
gene ontology analyses revealed gene expression differences
in categories such as extracellular matrix organization, collagen
fibril organization, cell-matrix and cell-substrate adhesion,
angiogenesis, and wound healing (Figures 1E, S2B, and S2C).
Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed a
notable similarity to hepatic fibrosis/stellate cell activation (Me-
deracke et al., 2013) (Figure 1F). We found a large number of
fibrosis-associated genes, encoding for an array of extracellular
matrix molecules and collagen-processing enzymes, displaying
reduced levels of expression in Tam animals when compared
to vehicle animals. Strikingly, the expression of fibrosis-associ-
ated genes in Tam animals clustered with the expression profile
of uninjured animals, rather than vehicle animals, establishing
that type A pericytes are required for the generation of fibrotic

 tissue and that reducing their generation of progeny blocks a
broad range of injury-induced gene expression changes (Fig-
ure 1G). Examples of differentially expressed genes were vali-
dated by real-time qPCR and at the protein level (Figures
S2D–S2J and S2L–S2P). Vehicle animals displayed increased
expression of fibrillar collagens type I and III, basal lamina-
associated collagen type IV, collagen type VI, and fibronectin
at the injury site compared to Tam animals (Figures S2F–S2J
and S2L–S2P).
Reduction of a specific cellular component of the scar can in-
fluence the contribution of other scar-forming cells (Anderson
et al., 2016; Faulkner et al., 2004; Hara et al., 2017; Herrmann
et al., 2008; Sabelstro
¨ m et al., 2013; Silver, 2016). Moreover,
astrocytes and fibrotic cells interact to form a sharp lesion
border (Bundesen et al., 2003). To assess the influence of
reduced pericyte-derived scarring on other cell types, we
analyzed changes in astrogliosis, inflammation, and oligoden-
drocyte
precursor
cell
(OPC)
numbers
in
Glast-Rasless
mice 2 and 4 weeks after a dorsal hemisection (Figures S3A–
S3R). The general inflammatory response, assessed as area
covered by CD68+ macrophages/microglia, was not signifi-
cantly changed between vehicle and Tam animals at 2 weeks
post injury (wpi), while Tam-def animals showed an increased
inflammatory response. During scar maturation/condensation
at
4
wpi,
Tam
animals

inflammation
compared to vehicle animals (Figures S3A–S3F and S3M).
No changes were observed in the number of OPCs (non-
vascular-associated NG2+/PDGFRa+ cells) (Assinck et al.,
2017) flanking the lesion or in spared but reactive neural tissue
across all three groups at 2 and 4 wpi (Figures S3N and S3O).
Although no difference in general astrogliosis and glial scar
state was detected at 2 wpi across groups, the glial process
network immediately flanking the lesion core tended to present
a less complex arrangement in Tam animals (Figures S2K, S2Q,
S3P, and S3Q). At 4 wpi, differences among groups became
more apparent with Tam animals exhibiting reduced general
astrogliosis, decreased dense wall-like configuration of glial
processes at the glial-fibrotic lesion border, and diminished
astrocyte reactivity within the parenchyma when compared to
vehicle animals (Figures S3G–S3L, S3P, and S3R).
Attenuation of Pericyte-Derived Scarring Leads to
Decreased Axonal Die Back
A spinal cord dorsal hemisection interrupts bilaterally descend-
ing motor pathways, including the serotonergic raphespinal tract
(RST) and the corticospinal tract (CST) (Tuszynski and Steward,
2012). BDA-traced CST axons contacted glial and non-neural
scar-forming cells 2 weeks following a dorsal hemisection (Fig-
ures 2A–2C and S3S–S3V). Because the injured spinal cord tis-
sue rapidly is flanked by reactive astrocytes and OPCs, the glial
scar represents the first barrier to regenerating axons (Fitch and
Silver, 2008; Hackett and Lee, 2016). In line with these observa-
tions, we found that 46.9% ± 4.7% and 22.5% ± 4.2% of BDA+
CST axon tips make contact with GFAP+- reactive astrocytes
and OPCs (Figures 2C, S3U, and S3V), respectively. Additionally,
16.1% ± 3.2% of the BDA+ axon tips contacted CD68+ cells,
most likely reflecting axons undergoing macrophage-mediated
axonal dieback (Busch et al., 2009) (Figures 2C and S3T). Inter-
estingly, 6.6% ± 3.1% of BDA-traced axon tips were able to
penetrate the glial scar and the glial-fibrotic interface and
contacted YFP+ type A pericyte-derived stromal cells (Figures
2A–2C and S3S).
To investigate the influence of reduced type A pericyte-
derived scarring on axonal regeneration, we quantified BDA-
traced CST axons in Glast-Rasless mice after a dorsal hemisec-
tion. BDA+ CST axons in vehicle animals showed extensive
retraction bulb formation and axonal dieback at 2 and 4 wpi. In
comparison to the vehicle group, Tam animals displayed fewer
dystrophic end bulbs, and on average, BDA+ CST axons were
found closer to the rostral lesion margin. In contrast to the Tam
group, Tam-def animals showed no significant difference in
CST retraction bulb formation and axonal dieback compared
to vehicle animals at 2 or 4 wpi (Figures 2D–2M). No CST axon
regeneration into or beyond the lesion site was detected in
vehicle or Tam animals at 2 wpi (Figures 2N and 2O). At 4 wpi,
we observed BDA+ CST axons reaching the vicinity of the lesion
core in Tam animals, with axons growing into and beyond the
scar in some instances. Vehicle animals showed no CST axon
regeneration into or beyond the scar at 4 wpi (Figures 2P
and 2Q). We noticed that while in vehicle and Tam-def animals,
CST axons stopped proximal to the glial-fibrotic lesion border,
regrowing CST axons aligned with astrocyte processes and
extended into the margin and core of the lesion in Tam animals
at 4 wpi (Figures S3W–S3Z).
Reducing Pericyte-Derived Scarring Enables
Corticospinal and Raphespinal Tract Axon Regeneration
We next assessed CST axon regeneration in Glast-Rasless mice
18 weeks after a dorsal hemisection (Figures 3A–3W). Tamox-
ifen-induced genetic recombination with CreER is infrequently
complete, as previously established (Go
¨ ritz et al., 2011). The
recombination efficiency in Glast-Rasless mice negatively corre-
lated with fibrotic scar tissue generation and positively corre-
lated with failure to close the injury site and the appearance of
a tissue defect (Figures 3L–3N). Vehicle and Tam-def animals
showed little or no CST axon regeneration into or beyond the
lesion site. In contrast, 10.5% ± 2.1% of the traced CST axons
(relative to traced CST axons found 3 mm proximal to the lesion
in the same animals) extended into the lesion site in Tam animals
(Figures 3A–3K, 3O, and 3P). This corresponded on average to
10.6 ± 2.6 traced CST axons reaching the lesion core per 10
sagittal sections. In 4 of the 10 Tam animals, CST fibers reached
the scar core but did not grow beyond the lesion, while in the re-
maining 6 animals, CST axons extended caudally, reaching up to
4 mm beyond the lesion (Figures 3D–3F, 3H, and 3O–3R). Re-
generated axons grew around, under, and through the lesion
(Figures S4A and S4B). None of the analyzed animals had BDA
labeled axons within the main dorsal CST caudal to the lesion
(Figures S4C, S4E, S4H, and S4J), establishing that fibers found
distal to the injury were not a result of sparing. Terminals of
traced axons 4 mm caudal to the lesion site were found preferen-
tially in the dorsal and intermediate gray matter and displayed
synaptic markers (Figures 3R–3W, S4D, S4F, S4G, S4I, S4K,
and S4L).
We then quantified RST axon density at 2, 4, and 18 wpi by
immunohistochemistry for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the

 same vehicle and Tam animals used for CST analysis. The
number of RST axons innervating the ventral horn 4 mm
caudal to a dorsal hemisection increased over time, and the
Tam group showed a significantly higher density of RST
axons compared to vehicle animals at 18 wpi (Figure 4). The
observed increase in RST axon density caudal to the lesion
in Tam animals can be a result of true regeneration of
transected RST axons and/or sprouting of nearby RST axon
terminals that have been spared by the injury (Tuszynski and
Steward, 2012).

 Optogenetic Analysis of CST Axon Signal Transmission
In the sensorimotor cortex, only layer V corticospinal neurons
project directly to the spinal cord. CST axon terminals mainly
target laminae III–VII and X, thus providing major excitatory input
to dorsal horn neurons, (inter)segmental interneurons and pre-
motor circuits in the mouse. To assess whether regenerated
axons integrate into the local circuitry, we employed an optoge-
netic strategy (Jayaprakash et al., 2016; Jin et al., 2015),
combining light-induced stimulation of regenerating CST axons
with single-unit extracellular recordings in intermediate gray
matter regions caudal to a dorsal hemisection.
To trace CST axons, adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing
channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) fused to GFP (AAV9-CAG-ChR2-
GFP) or only GFP (AAV9-CAG-GFP) was injected into layer V of
the sensorimotor cortex in adult mice. ChR2-GFP and GFP label-
ing, respectively, could be detected throughout the neurospinal
axis, with no labeling in dorsal root ganglia or peripheral nerve
branches (Figures 5A–5E and S5).
For validation of the optogenetic strategy, we first performed
recordings of layer V sensorimotor cortex neurons in response
to photoactivation in anesthetized animals transduced with
ChR2-GFP. In isoflurane anesthetized animals, most cortical
units appeared silent before photoactivation. Application of
blue light at the cortical surface over sensorimotor cortex
(473 nm, 10 Hz or 20 Hz, 3-ms pulse length) resulted in
robust and time-locked spiking of layer V sensorimotor cortex
pyramidal neurons (Figures S6A–S6G). We thereafter assessed
cortico-spinal communication upon optogenetic orthodromic/
antidromic activation of the CST in anesthetized animals. Unilat-
eral photoactivation (473 nm, 10 Hz, 10-ms pulse length) of
ChR2-expressing neurons in the sensorimotor cortex evoked or-
thodromic spiking in the contralateral cervical spinal cord (Fig-
ures S6H–S6M). The latencies to spike (�10–20 ms) reflect
the anatomical distance between the photostimulation and
recording sites. Evoked action potentials in spinal neurons may
be a direct result of CST input and/or upstream relay networks
because the sensorimotor cortex also sends indirect projec-
tions, via motor centers in the brainstem, to the spinal cord.
Conversely, unilateral photostimulation (473 nm, 10 Hz, 10-ms
pulse length) of CST axon terminals in the cervical spinal cord eli-
cited antidromic action potentials in CST neuronal cell bodies in
the contralateral sensorimotor cortex (Figures S6N–S6S). Anti-
dromic spikes had mean latencies of �10–15 ms, approximately
matching the observed mean orthodromic spike latencies.
Photoactivation (spinal and sensorimotor cortex, respectively)
in animals transduced with AAV9-CAG-GFP did not result in
light-evoked activity (Figures S6H–S6J and S6N–S6P).
Regenerated CST Axons Functionally Integrate into the
Spinal Circuitry Caudal to the Lesion
To validate that photostimulation of ChR2-expressing CST axon
terminals drives spiking of spinal neurons, we performed local

 and restricted photoactivation in the spinal cord of anesthetized
animals transduced with ChR2-GFP. Photoactivation (473 nm,
10 Hz or 20 Hz, 3 ms pulse length) targeted to the intact (non-
lesioned) cervical spinal cord rostral to a dorsal hemisection in
Glast-Rasless animals 18 wpi evoked postsynaptic responses
in spinal neurons (Figures 5F–5P). Recruitment of silent spinal
units (Figures 5I–5L) as well as increased firing were observed
(Figures 5M–5P).
We next assessed the functionality of regenerated CST axon
terminals caudal to the injury 18 wpi. Blue light (473 nm, 10 Hz
or 20 Hz, 3 ms pulse length) was delivered 0.5–3 mm caudal to
the injury site and single unit activity recorded at the same
position (Figure 6). Activation of ChR2-GFP-expressing CST
terminals caudal to the lesion site elicited clear spinal postsyn-
aptic responses from the intermediate gray matter, establish-
ing that regenerated CST axons form functional synapses
with local spinal neurons in Tam animals (Figures 6H–6N).
The short light-driven latencies to spike suggest monosynaptic
activation of local spinal neurons by regenerated CST axons
(Figure 6N). Photoactivation caudal to the injury in vehicle
animals had no effect on postsynaptic responses (Figures
6A–6G). Taken together, the optogenetic experiments provide
causal evidence for functional integration of regenerated
CST axons in the spinal circuitry caudal to a dorsal hemisec-
tion in animals with reduced pericyte-derived scarring (Tam
animals).

 Attenuated Pericyte-Derived Scarring Improves
Sensorimotor Recovery
CST fibers mediate fine motor coordination, while serotonergic
fibers modulate the activity of spinal motor systems (Tuszynski
and Steward, 2012). Skilled locomotion, sensorimotor integra-
tion and limb placement can be evaluated using the horizontal
ladder-walking test (Metz and Whishaw, 2002). When traversing

a

compared to vehicle animals, from week

(Figure

Similarly,
the

measured by automated gait analyses
(Hamers et al., 2001; Neumann et al.,
2009) stably improved in the Tam group
from week 6 following injury onward,
when compared to vehicle animals (Fig-

axons found in the lesion core negatively
correlated with the extent of fibrotic scar-
ring and hindlimb error rate (Figures S7A

the
significance
of
improved axonal regeneration for the re-
covery of sensorimotor function we devel-
oped an optogenetic-based task in awake, freely moving animals
(Figure 7C). Mice were bilaterally transduced with AAV9-CAG-
ChR2-GFP or control AAV9-CAG-GFP virus in layer V of the
sensorimotor cortex and bilaterally implanted with fiber optics
0.2 mm above the sites of virus injection. Sensorimotor cortex
layer V output neurons project to reach spinal cord targets but
also provide major excitatory input to the red nucleus and reticular

 formation, which project descending axons in the spinal cord.
Unilateral optogenetic activation of the sensorimotor cortex
(20 Hz, 5 ms pulse length) triggered vigorous limb movement
(Cheng et al., 2014) in awake, freely moving uninjured animals
transduced with AAV9-CAG-ChR2-GFP but failed to generate a
similar behavioral output in uninjured AAV9-CAG-GFP trans-
duced control animals (Figure 7D; Movie S1). Eighteen weeks
following a dorsal hemisection, we observed an almost complete
loss of light-evoked hind paw strokes in vehicle animals. How-
ever, Tam animals showed modest but significant increase in
light-driven hind paw strokes compared to the vehicle group (Fig-
ure 7D; Movie S2). Post hoc analysis of the animals revealed that
10% ± 2% of the ChR2-GFP-expressing CST axons (relative to
the total CST axon density found 4 mm proximal to the injury
site) could be found 0.5 mm caudal to the lesion in dorsal and in-
termediate gray matter regions in Tam animals, confirming the
findings from the earlier experiment (Figure 3). No ChR2-GFP-ex-
pressing axons could be found caudal to the lesion in animals with
dense fibrotic scar (vehicle animals) (Figures S7C–S7F). We
also assessed serotonergic axon density in the two groups of

 animals subjected to the functional experiments. The Tam ani-
mals showed increased density of 5-HT+ RST axons innervating
the ventral horn 4 mm caudal to the lesion, compared to vehicle
animals (Figures S7G–S7R). CST and RST axon densities
0.5 mm and 4 mm caudal to the lesion, respectively, correlated
with light-driven hind paw strokes (Figures 7E–7H). Animals with
improved motor performance presented the highest number of
regenerated fibers caudal to the lesion, suggesting that the regen-
erated fibers may, at least in part, account for the observed
behavioral improvement, most likely via indirect relay-circuits (Filli
and Schwab, 2015; Hou, 2014).
DISCUSSION
Scar formation by astrocytes (Anderson et al., 2016; Faulkner
et al., 2004; Herrmann et al., 2008; Sabelstro
¨ m et al., 2013; Sil-
ver, 2016) and type A pericytes (Go
¨ ritz et al., 2011) is crucial
for sealing off the injured tissue and regaining tissue integrity af-
ter CNS lesions. At the same time, scar tissue is considered a
major block for axonal regeneration. Most attention has been
focused on astrocytes forming the glial component of the scar,
and reactive astrocytes have long been thought to inhibit axonal
regeneration (Cafferty et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2015; Yiu and He,
2006), although this notion has recently been questioned (Ander-
son et al., 2016; Silver, 2016). Pericytes give rise to fibroblast-like
cells that constitute the fibrotic compartment of the scar and are
required for the generation of fibrosis and extracellular matrix
deposition. We demonstrate that pericyte-derived scarring rep-
resents a major barrier for axonal regrowth and that moderate
inhibition of this process preserves intact wound healing and
dampens inflammation and reactive astrogliosis while enabling
axonal regrowth and improved functional recovery.
Using lineage tracing, we previously identified a small pericyte
subset as the origin of scar-forming fibroblast-like cells following
spinal cord injury (Go
¨ ritz et al., 2011). Similarly, pericytes have
also been implicated in dermal scarring and kidney fibrosis as
the source of ECM-producing (myo)fibroblasts (Lin et al., 2008;
Sundberg et al., 1996). However, a recent fate mapping study
(Guimaraes-Camboa et al., 2017) targeting Tbx18-expressing
pericytes and smooth muscle cells showed little proliferation
and no contribution of this lineage to scar-forming cells in
response to cortical stab wounds. There are two important
points that may explain the discrepancy between the aforemen-
tioned studies. First, type A pericytes and Tbx18-expressing
mural cells might represent non-overlapping populations. Our
previous study established functional heterogeneity among peri-
cytes, with scar formation being restricted to a small subset ac-
counting for 10% of all pericytes (Go
¨ ritz et al., 2011). Second, in
contrast to spinal cord injuries, cortical stab lesions do not give
rise to extensive fibrotic tissue, indicated by the absence of a
substantial increase in Col1a1-GFP expressing cells post-injury
(Guimaraes-Camboa et al., 2017).
Scar tissue is composed of different cell types with distinct
cellular origin (Barnabe
´ -Heider et al., 2010; Go
¨ ritz et al., 2011;
Meletis et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2015a) and reduction of a
specific cellular scar component will influence the contribution
of other scar-forming cells. Prevention, deletion or attenuation
of astrocyte scarring leads to increased neurotoxic inflamma-
tion and expansion of fibrotic scarring, compromising axon
regeneration and worsening functional recovery (Anderson
et al., 2016; Faulkner et al., 2004; Herrmann et al., 2008; Sabel-
stro
¨ m et al., 2013; Silver, 2016). Conversely, the decreased
reactive astrogliosis and inflammation associated with reduced
pericyte-derived scarring we describe here may contribute to
the beneficial effect on axonal regeneration and functional
recovery.
That fibrosis inhibits axonal regeneration is consistent with
indirect observations in previous studies. For example, when
promoting inherent neuronal regenerative capacity by experi-
mentally reducing PTEN, CST axon regrowth is observed along
glial bridges and in fibrotic tissue-free regions (Zukor et al.,
2013). Moreover, microtubule stabilization was shown to reduce
scarring and impact axon regeneration of serotonergic and
growth-competent sensory neurons after spinal cord injury (Hel-
lal et al., 2011; Ruschel et al., 2015). However, these studies did
not distinguish between the effects of reduced scarring and
axonal stabilization and targeted various cell types and cellular
mechanisms. Using a cell-type-specific targeting strategy, we
show that a moderate reduction of pericyte-derived scar tissue
facilitates CST and RST axon regeneration and functional
recovery.
CST axons, which show the greatest resistance to regenera-
tion, mediate voluntary fine motor movement, a function that is
much desired in spinal cord injury patients (Liu et al., 2011; Wel-
niarz et al., 2017). As in most studies focusing on CST regenera-
tion, we have used a dorsal hemisection model to ensure
transection of CST projections. This lesion model spares main
descending brainstem motor systems such as the vestibulospi-
nal and reticulospinal tracts. Although not being directly respon-
sible for most aspects of gross locomotor hind limb recovery, the
CST/5-HT regenerated fibers could ultimately contribute via
(inter)segmental, propriospinal, and other indirect relay-circuits
to the observed improvement in functional recovery in Tam ani-
mals (Filli and Schwab, 2015; Flynn et al., 2017; Hou, 2014; Ueno
et al., 2012).
While being more clinically relevant, severe injury models such
as contusion lesions (commonly combined with BMS scoring to
follow functional recovery), are not the preferred injury models to
study CST regeneration, as not all the CST axons are destroyed
by the lesion, making it difficult to distinguish between bona fide
regeneration and sprouting of spared axons. Dense fibrotic scar-
ring is seen following both dorsal hemisection and contusion
injury (Zhu et al., 2015b) in rodents. Humans also form a fibrous
extracellular matrix rich non-neural lesion core following trau-
matic spinal cord injury (Buss et al., 2007; Norenberg et al.,
2004), suggesting that attenuation of pericyte-derived scarring
may be explored as a therapeutic target to facilitate regeneration
following CNS injury.

 EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Animals
Glast-CreERT2 (Slezak et al., 2007) and Rasless (Drosten et al., 2010) mice were crossed to the R26R-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)
Cre-reporter line (obtained from the Jackson Laboratory, B6.129X1-Gt(Rosa)26Sortm1(EYFP)Cos/J, JAX: 006148, (Srinivas et al., 2001))
to generate Glast-Rasless-YFP mice. All Rasless mice used were homozygous for HRas and NRas null alleles and homozygous for
floxed KRas alleles. For some experiments Glast-CreERT2 mice were crossed to the R26R-YFP Cre-reporter line only to generate
Glast-YFP mice. All animals were on a C57BL/6J background and R 8 weeks old at the onset of experiments and both male and
female mice were used. Animals were housed in group in standardized cages with a 12:12 h light:dark cycle with unrestricted access
to food and water. All experimental procedures were carried out in accordance to the Swedish and European Union guidelines and
approved by the institutional ethical committee (Stockholms Norra Djurfo
¨rso
¨ksetiska Na
¨mnd).
METHOD DETAILS
Genetic labeling of transgenic mice
Recombination in Glast-Rasless-YFP animals was induced by a daily intra-peritoneal injection of 2 mg of tamoxifen (Sigma, 20 mg/ml
in 1:9 ethanol:corn oil) for 5 consecutive days. Vehicle animals (matched mice with the same genotype) received the same number of
injections of the solvent (1:9 ethanol:corn oil) without tamoxifen. Animals were randomly assigned to receive either vehicle alone or
tamoxifen. Glast-YFP animals were recombined with tamoxifen using the same protocol aforementioned.
Spinal cord injury
Injuries were performed after a 7 days clearing period starting after the last tamoxifen injection. Tamoxifen and its active metabolite
4-hydroxytamoxifen have a half-life of 6–12 h in the mouse (Robinson et al., 1991). Analysis of CreERT2 distribution in the adult mouse
spinal cord 6 days after the last tamoxifen administration has demonstrated that there is no CreERT2 in the nucleus of cells at this time,
directly demonstrating that tamoxifen has been cleared at this time point (Meletis et al., 2008). Therefore, the chosen 7 days wash out
period ensures that no tamoxifen is left at the time of injury or after, which could affect the response to injury. Moreover, it guarantees
that all recombination occurs prior to the insult, so in case other cells than type A pericytes start expressing the Glast-CreERT2 trans-
gene in response to the injury, it will not result in recombination.
Dorsal funiculus incision SCI model
Glast-CreERT2 x R26R-YFP (Glast-YFP; n = 4-5) and Glast-CreERT2 x R26R-YFP x Rasless (Glast-Rasless-YFP, tamoxifen injected;
n = 4) mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane until unconscious followed by 2% isoflurane during surgery. Analgesia (Temgesic/
Buprenorphine, Schering-Plough, 0.1 mg/kg body weight and Rimadyl/Carprofen, Pfizer, 5 mg/kg body weight; subcutaneous injec-
tion) was administered for postoperative pain relief and a uniform layer of Viscotears eye gel (2 mg/g, Novartis) was applied onto the
eye ball to prevent drying. A laminectomy was performed at the mid-thoracic level to expose the dorsal portion of the spinal cord and
the dorsal funiculus (located between the dorsal horns and the midline) and adjacent gray matter were cut transversely to a depth of
0.8mm. This incision was extended rostrally with microsurgical scissors to span one segment (adapted from (Meletis et al., 2008)). All
animals received local anesthesia (Xylocaine/Lidocaine, AstraZeneca, 10 mg/ml, 2 drops on the spinal cord surface) 2-3 min prior to
the lesion. For recovery from surgery animals were placed on a heating pad and only returned to their home cage once they were
fully awake.
Following SCI, EdU was given twice by intraperitoneal injections (12 mg/ml, 100 mL per injection) at 6 hr interval, followed by EdU
administration in the drinking water for up to 5 days (0.2 mg/ml and 1% sucrose, exchanged every 2-3 days and kept in dark) to label
dividing cells. A group of Glast-YFP (n = 3) and Glast-Rasless-YFP (n = 4) mice underwent the same EdU regimen but received no
injury.
Dorsal hemisection SCI model and CST tracing
Glast-YFP (n = 6, 2 wpi) and Glast-Rasless-YFP (n = 54; Vehicle: 2 wpi: n = 10, 4 wpi: n = 5, 18 wpi: n = 8, Tamoxifen: 2 wpi: n = 12,
4 wpi: n = 7, 18 wpi: n = 12) mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane until unconscious followed by 2% isoflurane during surgery.
A laminectomy was performed at T1-T2 levels to expose the dorsal portion of the spinal cord. To minimize meningeal fibroblast in-
vasion into the lesion core the dura mater was carefully cleared off from the exposed area. A bilateral dorsal hemisection lesion of the
spinal cord was performed at T1 with a pair of microscissors to a depth of 0.8 mm to sever the CST. For recovery from surgery animals
were placed on a heating pad and only returned to their home cage once they were fully awake. Surgeries were conducted in a
blinded fashion. Two weeks before the termination of the experiments, mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane until unconscious
followed by 2% isoflurane during surgery and received bilateral cortical injections of 10% biotin dextran amine (BDA, 10000 MW, Life
Technologies) to anterogradely label the CST. Briefly, animals were head-fixed in a stereotaxic frame and burr holes were drilled over
the sensorimotor cortex. Four microinjections (0.4 mL per injection) of BDA were targeted to layer V in the sensorimotor cortex (two
injections / hemisphere; from bregma, AP ± 0.5 mm, LM 1 mm, DV 0.55 mm and AP ± 0.5 mm, LM �1 mm, DV 0.55 mm) at a rate of
0.1 ml/min using a 10 mL NanoFil syringe with a 36 g beveled needle tip (World Precision Instruments) and a microinjector
(UltraMicroPump III and Micro4 microsyringe pump controller, World Precision Instruments). After injection, the needle was kept
in place for an additional 5 min to allow virus diffusion and prevent backflow of the virus to the surface, and then slowly withdrawn.

 For recovery from surgery animals were placed on a heating pad and only returned to their home cage once they were fully awake. For
animals sacrificed 2 weeks after dorsal hemisection lesion, BDA was injected on the day before the SCI surgery. For experiments
terminated 4 and 18 weeks after dorsal hemisection lesion, mice were injected with BDA two and sixteen weeks after the SCI surgery,
respectively.
For all surgeries, analgesia (Temgesic/Buprenorphine, Schering-Plough, 0.1 mg/kg body weight and Rimadyl/Carprofen, Pfizer,
5 mg/kg body weight; subcutaneous injection) was administered for postoperative pain relief and a uniform layer of Viscotears
eye gel (2 mg/g, Novartis) was applied onto the eye ball to prevent drying.
All animals received local anesthesia (Xylocaine/Lidocaine, AstraZeneca; 10 mg/ml, 2 drops on the spinal cord surface) 2-3 min
prior to spinal lesions or craniotomies.
In vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics
Uninjured Glast-Rasless-YFP animals (n = 8) and Glast-Rasless-YFP animals subjected to SCI injury 12-14 weeks earlier (n = 3 in-
jected with vehicle, n = 5 injected with tamoxifen) were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane until unconscious followed by 2% isoflurane
during surgery. Animals were placed in a stereotaxic frame and burr holes were drilled to expose the brain. Four microinjections
(0.4 mL per injection) of an AAV expressing ChR2-GFP or GFP (AAV9-CAG-ChR2-GFP, titer 3x1012 virus molecules/mL; AAV9-
CAG-GFP, titer 2x1012 virus molecules/mL, University of North Carolina Viral Vector Core) were targeted to layer V in the sensori-
motor cortex (two injections / hemisphere; from bregma, AP 0.5 mm, LM 1 mm, DV 0.55 mm and AP �0.5 mm, LM 1 mm, DV
0.55 mm) at a rate of 0.1 ml/min using a 10 mL NanoFil syringe with a 36 g beveled needle tip (World Precision Instruments) and a
microinjector (UltraMicroPump III and Micro4 microsyringe pump controller, World Precision Instruments). After injection, the needle
was kept in place for an additional 5 min to allow virus diffusion and prevent backflow of the virus to the surface, and then slowly
withdrawn. For recovery from surgery animals were placed on a heating pad and only returned to their home cage once they
were fully awake. For all surgeries, analgesia (Temgesic/Buprenorphine, Schering-Plough, 0.1 mg/kg body weight and Rimadyl/Car-
profen, Pfizer, 5 mg/kg body weight; subcutaneous injection) was administered for postoperative pain relief and Viscotears eye gel
(2 mg/g, Novartis) was applied onto the eye ball to prevent drying.
All animals received local anesthesia (Xylocaine/Lidocaine, AstraZeneca; 10 mg/ml, 2 drops on the spinal cord surface) 2-3 min
prior to craniotomies.
Four to six weeks after viral injections (i.e., 18 weeks post SCI for injured animals) in vivo single unit extracellular recordings from the
sensorimotor cortex and spinal cord were performed in conjunction with optogenetics under anesthesia (1% isoflurane in O2). An-
imals were placed in a stereotaxic frame, the head was immobilized with ear bars and the cortical region previously injected with virus
exposed. Viscotears eye gel (2mg/g; Novartis) was applied onto the eye ball to prevent drying. For uninjured animals the cervical spi-
nal cord was exposed and stabilized with spinal cord clamps (Narishige, Japan). For injured animals the spinal cord segments
encompassing the injury site plus 2-3 segments above and 2-3 segments below the injury were exposed and stabilized as aforemen-
tioned. The body temperature was maintained at 37�C using a feedback-controlled heating pad (Harvard Apparatus #507221F).
For the recordings, 32-channel silicon probes (4 shanks with 2 tetrodes, designed for extracellular somatic recordings, model num-
ber: A4x2-tet-5mm-150-200-312-A32, NeuroNexus Technologies) and a Digital Lynx 4SX acquisition system with Cheetah data
acquisition software (Neuralynx) were used. A multimode optical fiber (200 mm, 0.22 NA, Thorlabs), held in place with a stereotaxic
apparatus and positioned at the surface of the target area, was used for light delivery (447 or 473 nm). A patch cable (Doric Lenses)
was connected from the optical fiber to a blue or violet blue laser (Cobolt MLD 473 nm, Cobolt or CNI/OEM diode laser 447 nm,
Changchun New Industries Optoelectronics Technology, respectively) controlled by custom software written in LabView (National
Instruments).
The electrode was stereotaxically lowered into the sensorimotor cortex or intermediate gray matter of the spinal cord. Baseline
activity recordings of each unit were conducted for 30 s before light-evoked activity was measured. Both uninjured and injured an-
imals were used for cortical soma recordings, orthodromic and antidromic activation of CST neurons. For cortical soma recordings,
the silicone probe was lowered into layer V of the sensorimotor cortex previously injected with the virus and the ipsilateral brain sur-
face was exposed to pulses of blue light (5 mW, 3-5 ms pulses, 10-40 Hz). For orthodromic activation of CST neurons, the brain sur-
face over the sensorimotor cortex previously injected with the virus was photostimulated (10 mW, 10 ms pulse length, 10 Hz) and the
electrode targeted to the contralateral spinal cord intermediate gray matter (i.e., cervical spinal cord for uninjured animals and 2-3
segments rostral to the injury site for lesioned animals). For antidromic activation of CST neurons, light (10 mW, 10 ms pulse length,
10 Hz) was delivered to one side of the spinal cord surface to activate CST axon terminals (i.e., cervical spinal cord for uninjured an-
imals and 2-3 segments rostral to the injury site for lesioned animals) while recording action potentials in layer V neuronal cell bodies
in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex previously injected with the virus.
To assess whether local photostimulation of ChR2-GFP+ CST axons terminals in the non-injured cervical portion of the spinal cord
is able to generate post synaptic activity in neighboring local spinal neurons, we illuminated the spinal cord surface 2-3 segments
rostral to the lesion area with pulsed blue light (5 mW, 3 ms pulses, 10 Hz or 20 Hz) and positioned the electrode in the ipsilateral
intermediate spinal gray matter underneath the illuminated area. In order to investigate functional synaptic connectivity by regener-
ated ChR2-GFP+ CST axons in injured GLAST-Rasless-YFP mice blue light photostimulation (5 mW, 3 ms pulses, 10 Hz or 20 Hz) was
delivered to the spinal cord surface 0.5-3 mm caudal to the injury site. Postsynaptic responses were recorded by targeting the
electrode to the ipsilateral intermediate gray matter underneath the illuminated area.

 Unit signals were amplified (x10,000), bandpass filtered (600-6,000 Hz), and sampled at 32 kHz. Single units were manually sorted
and identified based on various spike waveform features using MClust spike sorting toolbox for MATLAB (A.D. Redish). Only well-
isolated single units (isolation distance > 15, L-ratio < 0.2, and the spikes < 0.01% at ISI < 2 ms) were used in the data analysis
(Schmitzer-Torbert et al., 2005). To examine the effects of optogenetic stimulation on cells modulated by CST fibers, we constructed
spike raster plots and peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) for each neuron.
After the recordings, the animals were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital and transcardially perfused
with cold PBS followed by 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Animals presenting tissue defects/holes (Tam-def) were not used for recordings.
Post hoc analyses confirmed that spinal cord injured animals used for recordings did not present CST spared fibers caudal to the
injury.
Behavioral testing combined with optogenetics
For behavioral experiments in conjunction with optogenetic manipulations Glast-Rasless-YFP animals subjected to SCI 12-14 weeks
earlier (n = 7 injected with vehicle, n = 7 injected with tamoxifen) received two microinjections of an AAV expressing ChR2-GFP
(AAV9-CAG-ChR2-GFP) targeted to layer V in the sensorimotor cortex (one injection / hemisphere, 0.5 mL per injection; from bregma,
AP 0 mm, ML 1 mm, DV 0.55 mm) at a rate of 0.1 ml/min using a 10 mL NanoFil syringe with a 36 g beveled needle tip (World Precision
Instruments) and a microinjector (UltraMicroPump III and Micro4 microsyringe pump controller, World Precision Instruments). After
injection, the needle was kept in place for an additional 5 min to allow virus diffusion and prevent backflow of the virus to the surface,
and then slowly withdrawn. Uninjured Glast-Rasless-YFP control animals were injected with AAV9-CAG-GFP (n = 6) or AAV9-CAG-
ChR2-GFP (n = 4).
Concurrent with viral injections fiber optic implants (made in house (Sparta et al., 2011); 200 mm multimode fiber optic, 0.22 NA,
Thorlabs; 230 mm ferrules, Precision Fiber Products) were placed 0.2 mm above the sites of viral injection and permanently secured
onto the skull with two anchor screws and light-cured dental adhesive cement (Tetric EvoFlow, Ivoclar Vivadent Corporate). The blue
light from the laser penetrates approximately 0.5 mm from the tip of the fiber optic and stimulates the apical dendrites and soma of
cortical layer V ChR2-expressing neurons (Arenkiel et al., 2007; Gibson et al., 2014).
Four to six weeks after viral injections (i.e., 18 weeks post SCI for injured animals) the animals were connected to a 200 mW 447 nm
violet blue laser system (CNI/OEM diode laser 447 nm, Changchun New Industries Optoelectronics Technology) with a fiber optic
rotary joint patch cable (Thor Labs), placed in the center of a transparent plexiglas box (20 3 20 3 20 cm) and allowed to freely
explore the box for 5-10 min. All animals underwent 3 trials of photostimulation per hemisphere in which light was on for 10 s/trial
(2.5 mW, 5 ms pulses, 20 Hz). Animals were videotaped during the task with a Sony Camcorder and analyses done offline at low
speed by an observer blinded to the experimental animal groups. The number of light-induced paw strokes was counted for each
hind limb (contralateral and ipsilateral triggered-movement) and plotted as number of light-induced hind paw strokes / 30 s. Animals
presenting spared CST fibers and tissue defects/holes (Tam-def) were not included in the analyses.
Optogenetic stimulation triggered limb motor output (paw strokes) in animals injected with AAV9-CAG-ChR2-GFP, but not in an-
imals injected with the control virus AAV9-CAG-EGFP (Movies S1 and S2).
Immunohistochemistry and microscopy
Animals were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with cold PBS followed
by 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Brains, and spinal cords and in some cases dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and peripheral nerves (sciatic
and brachial nerves) were dissected out and post fixed in formaldehyde overnight at 4�C. A Leica M165 C stereomicroscope equip-
ped with a Leica IC80 HD camera was used to photograph the dissected spinal cords. Spinal cords, DRGs and peripheral nerves
were then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose and coronal (20 mm) or sagittal (18 mm) cryosections were collected on alternating slides.
Coronal and sagittal brain sections (30 mm) were obtained by vibratome tissue sectioning.
Sections were incubated with blocking solution (10% normal donkey serum in PBS, with 0.3% Triton X-100) for 1 hr at room tem-
perature, then incubated at 4�C or room temperature in a humidified chamber overnight with primary antibodies diluted in 10%
normal donkey serum. For antibodies raised in mouse, the M.O.M. kit (Vector Labs) was used following the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. The following primary antibodies were used: CD31 (1:100, rat, BD Biosciences), CD68 (1:200, rat, AbD Serotec), Collagen I
(1:200, rabbit, Abcam), Collagen III (1:100, rabbit, Abcam), Collagen IV (1:200, rabbit, AbD Serotec; 1:50, goat, Southern Biotech),

 Cruz), mu crystallin (1:100, mouse, Abcam), CaMKIIa (1:100, mouse, Cell Signaling Technology). The NeuN antibody from Millipore
(clone A60) was directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 in house using a Monoclonal Antibody Labeling kit following the manufac-
turer’s description (Life Technologies).
After washing, antibody staining was revealed using species-specific fluorophore-conjugated (1:500, DyLight 405, Alexa Fluor 488,
Cy3, Alexa Fluor 594, Alexa Fluor 647 from Jackson Immunoresearch) or biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500, Jackson
Immunoresearch). Biotinylated secondary antibodies were revealed with fluorophore-conjugated streptavidin (1:500, Cy3, Alexa
Fluor 594 and Alexa Fluor 647 from Jackson Immunoresearch). To visualize traced BDA+ CST axons sections were incubated
with Cy3-conjugated streptavidin (1:500, Jackson Immunoresearch). EdU was detected with the Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 imag-
ing kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Control sections were stained with secondary antibody alone.
Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (4’6’-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (1 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich). Slides were mounted with Vectashield
Mounting Medium (Vector Labs).
Images were acquired with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 upright epifluorescent microscope, Leica TCS SP8X or a Zeiss LSM510 META
confocal microscope. Image processing and assembly were performed with ImageJ/Fiji (version 2.0.-rc-43/1.51 g), Adobe Photo-
shop CC 2015.1.2 and Illustrator CC 2015.1.2 for Mac.
Immunoblotting
Two weeks after a bilateral dorsal hemisection Glast-Rasless-YFP mice (n = 6, vehicle; n = 6, tamoxifen) were euthanized by intra-
peritoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS to remove blood contaminants. Injured
sites were quickly dissected out and pooled for protein extraction (2 injury sites were pooled as one biological replicate, n = 3). Tissue
was homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM sodium
fluoride, 1% Triton X-100 plus protease- and phosphatase-inhibiting cocktail [Roche]), sonicated and the supernatant was collected
after centrifugation at 10,000 g for 30 min at 4�C. Uninjured spinal cord tissue from Glast-Rasless-YFP mice (n = 6) was used as a
control and processed in the same way.
Proteins (50 mg) were separated on Novex NuPAGE 4%–12% Bis-Tris Gels (Invitrogen) and then transferred to nitrocellulose mem-
branes (Trans Blot Turbo Transfer Pack Nitrocellulose, BioRad). Membranes were blocked for 1h with 5% skimmed milk (wt/vol) and
probed with primary antibodies followed by incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-
bodies (1:20000, Jackson Immunoresearch). Western blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate
mixture (ECL Prime, Amersham). The following primary antibodies were used: GFP (1:2000, goat, Abcam), PDGFRb (1:4000, rabbit,
Cell Signaling Technology), Periostin (1:10000, rabbit, Abcam), S100A4 (1:1000, rabbit, Abcam), HSP47 (1:200, rabbit, Acris), P4HB
(1:10000, rabbit, Abnova) and GAPDH (1:40000, mouse, Millipore).
Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR
Two weeks after a bilateral dorsal hemisection Glast-Rasless-YFP mice (n = 7-10, vehicle; n = 11-12, tamoxifen) were euthanized by
intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS to remove blood contaminants.
Injured and uninjured segments were quickly dissected out and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Total RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA micro kit (QIAGEN). The RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed to
cDNA using the SuperScript III First Strand kit (Invitrogen). cDNA (0.1 mg) from each sample was then amplified with TaqMan Univer-
sal PCR master mix II (Applied Biosystems) and TaqMan probe-based gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems). The following
TaqMan gene expression assays were used: PDGFRB (Assay ID: Mm00435546), COL1A1 (Assay ID: Mm00801666), COL1A2 (Assay
ID: Mm00483888), COL3A1 (Assay ID: Mm01254476), COL6A5 (Assay ID: Mm01231908), ACTA1 (Assay ID: Mm00808218), ELN
(Assay ID: Mm00514670), FN1 (Assay ID: Mm01256744), TNN (Assay ID: Mm00625680), ASPN (Assay ID: Mm00445945),
POSTN (Assay ID: Mm00450111), CD209A (Assay ID: Mm00460067), CD248 (Assay ID: Mm00547485), CCL21A (Assay ID:
Mm03646971), MMP3 (Assay ID: Mm00440295), MMP13 (Assay ID: Mm00439491), CPZ (Assay ID: Mm00462216), FAP (Assay
ID: Mm01329177), S100A4 (Assay ID: Mm00803372), LOX (Assay ID: Mm00495386), P4HB (Assay ID: Mm01243188) and HPRT
(Assay ID: Mm01545399, housekeeping gene).
QRT-PCR was conducted with the ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Relative expression was calculated using
the 2-DCt method. The fold change in mRNA levels between uninjured and injured conditions was calculated using DDCt.
Quantitative analysis
All analyses and measurements were conducted in a blind fashion.
The scar core occupancy by stromal cells was determined based on PDGFRb expression. Five alternate sagittal sections per an-
imals spanning the lesion center and spaced 130 mm apart were immunostained for PDGFRb, GFAP and DAPI. The lesion site was
photographed using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 epifluorescent microscope and the scar core (GFAP negative area within the GFAP-defined
borders) was manually outlined. Measurements were carried out using the ImageJ/Fiji software (version 2.0.-rc-43/1.51 g for Mac).
The area occupied by PDGFRb signal (scar occupancy) was thresholded and presented as a percentage of the total lesion core area.
The same photographs were used to determine the volume of tissue defects. Tissue defects (areas devoid of cells bordered by GFAP)
were manually outlined and determined using the ImageJ/Fiji software. Volume estimations were calculated using the formula:
V = SA x T, in which V = volume, A = area associated with tissue defect, T = distance between each sampled region.

 To determine the recombination efficiency, the total number of recombined (YFP-expressing) pericytes (type A pericytes) was
counted on three 20 mm coronal cervical sections 600 mm rostral to the injury per animal. To calculate the relative recombination ef-
ficiency, values were normalized to the animal showing the highest number of recombined pericytes per section.
Proliferation of recombined (YFP-positive) and non-recombined (YFP-negative) pericytes (PDGFRb-positive cells) was assessed in
both intact spinal cords and 5 days after a dorsal funiculus incision SCI at mid-thoracic level. EdU, PDGFRb and YFP expressing cells
in uninjured segments and within the lesion core were counted in 4-5 coronal sections in 4-5 animals per group and expressed as
number of cells per area or as a percentage.
The number of PDGFRb-positive pericytes in direct contact with the podocalyxin-positive endothelium (ON vessel) or detached
from the blood vessel (OFF vessel) within the lesion core and in uninjured spinal cord segments was quantified in 4-5 coronal sections
in 4-5 animals per group and expressed as a percentage of total PDGFRb-positive cells.
To determine the proportion of AAV9-CAG-ChR2-GFP infected cells that are CaMKIIa-positive excitatory pyramidal neurons in
layer V of the sensorimotor cortex, the total number of GFP+/NeuN+ and CaMKIIa+ cells was counted across 5 coronal sections
per animal (n = 3). The result was expressed as the percentage of ChR2-GFP neurons that are CaMKIIa-positive or CaMKIIa-negative
over the total number of ChR2-GFP infected neurons.
To quantify regenerated CST fibers growing up to and past the lesion site in Glast-Rasless-YFP mice 18 weeks after dorsal hemi-
section, every third section of all the sagittal sections from each mouse (�30 sections in total spaced �50 mm apart) was processed to
visualize BDA+ CST axons. The sum of axons crossing perpendicular lines at 3, 1 and 0.5 mm rostral to the lesion and 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and
3 mm caudal to the lesion was recorded in all sections from each animal (Cafferty et al., 2010). Data were normalized to the number of
CST axons at 3 mm rostral to the lesion and presented as percentage of CST regeneration. For correlation analyses, the average raw
number of axons per 10 sagittal sections ± SEM. was plotted. Animals with spared CST fibers were excluded.
The density of BDA+ CST fibers 4 mm rostral and 4 mm caudal the lesion was measured using the ImageJ/Fiji software. Labeled
fibers within the dorsal (laminae I-V), intermediate (laminae VI, VII and X) and ventral (laminae VIII and IX) spinal cord gray matter were
selected by thresholding and the skeletonize function (Arganda-Carreras et al., 2010) was used to measure the average fiber length in
3 sections per mouse. Data were normalized to the density of CST axons at 4 mm rostral to the lesion and presented as percentage of
CST regeneration. Animals presenting spared CST fibers and tissue defects/holes (Tam-def) were excluded from the analyses.
To assess the proportion of BDA-traced CST axon tips contacting glial and non-neural scar-forming cells 2 weeks after dorsal hem-
isection, 4-6 sagittal sections per animal were used for each cell type analyses. Glast-YFP mice were used to visualize type A peri-
cyte-derived cells. To label immune cells and reactive astrocytes sections were immunostained for CD68 and GFAP, respectively.
NG2 and PDGFRa are commonly used to label OPCs but these markers are also expressed by vessel associated pericytes (Assinck
et al., 2017; Go
¨ ritz et al., 2011; He et al., 2016) and, after injury, NG2 expression is additionally found in macrophages (Jones et al.,
2002) and PDGFRa in stromal fibroblasts. For this reason, only PDGFRa/NG2 double positive cells non-associated with blood ves-
sels (immunolabeled for podocalyxin) and localized outside the lesion core were categorized as OPCs (Assinck et al., 2017). The num-
ber of CST axon tips contacting each scar-forming cell type was expressed as a percentage of total CST axons.
To assess for differences in inflammation, astrogliosis and OPC numbers in Glast-Rasless-YFP animals 2 and 4 weeks after a dor-
sal hemisection, 4-6 sagittal sections per animal were immunostained for CD68, GFAP and NG2/PDGFRa. The area occupied by
CD68-positive cells within 500 mm either side of the lesion center was thresholded and measured using ImageJ/Fiji software (version
2.0.-rc-43/1.51 g for Mac). Similarly, the area covered by GFAP-positive signal (astrogliosis) within 500 mm rostral and caudal to
the lesion center was thresholded and presented as a percentage of the total area. The number of OPCs (non-vascular associated
NG2/PDGFRa double positive cells) was counted within 100 mm rostral and caudal to the glial-fibrotic lesion border (scar-forming
OPCs) and in a 100 mm wide strip of spared but reactive neural tissue 500 mm away from either side of the lesion core. The results
were expressed as number of OPCs per area.
Scoring of the glial scar state in Glast-Rasless-YFP animals 2 and 4 weeks after dorsal hemisection was based on a semiquanti-
tative method developed by Hsu et al. (2006, 2008) for analyses of transverse sections and adapted to sagittal sections by Hellal et al.
(2011). The complexity level of the glial network (from no astrocytic hypertrophy – score 0, to hypertrophied astrocytes with formation
of glial limitans bordering the lesion core – score 3) was evaluated over 1 mm long spinal cord segments covering the rostral side of
the lesion. For analyses, each segment was partitioned into 200 mm wide strips starting from the lesion border and extending rostrally.
Four to six sagittal sections, spanning the medial, medial-lateral and lateral portions of the spinal cord, were immunostained for GFAP
and scored per animal. Scores representing the complexity and/or extent of astrogliosis in each strip of injured spinal cord were aver-
aged across sections and animals and presented as mean glial scar score.
The percentage of BDA+ CST axons presenting retraction bulbs and fiber retraction analyses 2 and 4 weeks after dorsal hemisec-
tion were quantified in sagittal sections from the medial portion of the spinal cord containing the main dCST (4-5 sections per animal).
To determine the average distance of axons to the lesion margin, the gap between all BDA+ CST axonal tips and the proximal edge of
the lesion (interface of glial and fibrotic scars) was measured using the ImageJ/Fiji software. Animals presenting CST spared fibers
caudal to the injury were excluded from the analyses.
In Glast-Rasless-YFP animals injected with AAV9-CAG-ChR2-GFP, the density of GFP+ CST fibers found 4 mm rostral to lesion
and 0.5 mm caudal to the injury site 18 weeks after dorsal hemisection was analyzed in a similar manner. Labeled fibers within
the spinal cord gray matter were selected by thresholding and the skeletonize function was used to measure the average fiber length
in 3 sections per mouse. Data were normalized to the density of CST axons at 4 mm rostral to the lesion and presented as percentage

 of CST regeneration. To determine the density of GFP+ CST fibers in uninjured Glast-Rasless-YFP animals injected with AAV9-CAG-
GFP or AAV9-CAG-ChR2-GFP, matched segments of the spinal cord were used for quantifications. Labeled fibers within the spinal
cord gray matter were selected by thresholding and the skeletonize function was used to measure the average fiber length in 3 sec-
tions per mouse. The density of CST fibers found at high thoracic level (corresponds roughly to the same spinal cord segment as
0.5 mm caudal to the injury) is approximately 70%–85% of the CST density at low cervical level (matches the same spinal cord
segment as 4 mm rostral to the lesion), indicating that the thoracic spinal cord is less innervated by CST fibers than the cervical spinal
cord. This is in agreement with the rostro-caudal decrease in size of the CST (Bareyre et al., 2005). Animals presenting spared CST
fibers and tissue defects/holes (Tam-def) were excluded from the analyses.
The density of 5HT-immunoreactive raphespinal fibers within the spinal cord ventral horn in injured Glast-Rasless-YFP animals 2, 4
and 18 weeks after dorsal hemisection (4 mm caudal to the lesion) was determined using the ImageJ/Fiji software. To quantify the
density of 5-HT+ fibers in uninjured Glast-Rasless-YFP animals, matched segments of the spinal cord were used for measurements.
Labeled fibers were selected by thresholding and the skeletonize function was used to measure the average fiber length in 5 sections
per animal. Results are presented as average length of 5-HT axons in the ventral horn per area.
Camera lucida reconstructions
Camera lucida reconstructions of CST axonal growth were generated by thresholding BDA+ CST axons from 10 sagittal sections in
ImageJ and then superimposing the traces into a single image using Adobe Illustrator. Reconstruction images of sagittal sections
representing 3 regions of the spinal cord were color coded and collapsed to render a final projection of CST axonal growth through
the lesion site. The black illustrates CST axon growth through the medial zone (mostly dorsal and ventral column white matter and
central canal), blue represents for the medial-lateral zone (mostly dorsal and ventral gray matter) and the red for the lateral zone
(mostly white mater).

Sensorimotor impairment due to spinal cord lesions is reflected by errors when a mouse crosses a horizontal ladder. Skilled
locomotion, sensorimotor integration and limb placement can be evaluated using the horizontal ladder-walking test (Metz and
Whishaw, 2002).
The horizontal ladder-walking test apparatus consisted of clear Plexiglas side walls (1 m in length) and unevenly spaced metal
rungs (to prevent habituation) elevated approximately 15 cm from the ground.
Glast-Rasless-YFP mice (n = 8 vehicle; n = 12 tamoxifen) were pre-trained on the horizontal ladder for one week prior to injury and
then assessed on the day before the surgery to provide baseline data. After bilateral dorsal hemisection SCI, animals were weekly
tested for up to 9 weeks and then every second week until 15 weeks after injury. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and
recorded using a digital camera for offline analyses. The average number of hind limb misplacements while the mice walked through
the 1 m long horizontal ladder was manually scored by an observer blinded to the treatment. A complete miss, slip, or replacement of
the paw during placement was considered as an error. The average number of errors per trial was normalized to the average
total number of steps per trial and the results presented as a percentage of error. Animals presenting spared CST fibers and tissue
defects/holes (Tam-def) were excluded from the analyses.
Catwalk automated gait analysis
The Catwalk XT video-based analysis system (Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, the Netherlands) was used to assess
gait and locomotion in voluntarily walking mice. When the animals traverse the Catwalk glass runaway, their footprints are captured
and allow subsequent calculation of multiple parameters related to print dimensions and the time and distance relationships between
footprints. CatWalk XT gait analysis has been validated in multiple neurological disorders and lesion models including SCI (Hamers
et al., 2001; Neumann et al., 2009).
During one week preceding surgery, Glast-Rasless-YFP mice (n = 8 vehicle; n = 12 tamoxifen) were daily trained on the Catwalk
runaway to make consecutive uninterrupted runs and then assessed on the day before the surgery to provide baseline data. After
bilateral dorsal hemisection SCI, animals were weekly tested for up to 9 weeks and then every second week until 15 weeks after
injury. Recorded footprints were analyzed with CatWalk software version 9.1 by an observer blinded to the treatment. Three runs
per animal and time point with a minimum of four step cycles each were analyzed per animal. The regularity index (% index) is pre-
sented as an overall measure of the degree of inter-limb coordination during gait, as measured by the number of normal step
sequence patterns (NSSP), multiplied by the number of paws and divided by the number of paw placements; RI = 100% 3
(NSSP 3 4) / number of paw placements. Animals presenting spared CST fibers and tissue defects (Tam-def) were excluded
from the analyses.
RNA-seq: Isolation, sequencing and analysis
Two weeks after bilateral dorsal hemisection, spinal cords of Glast-Rasless-YFP mice (Vehicle, n = 4; Tamoxifen, n = 4) were
dissected out and injured segments (parenchymal segments spanning 1 mm from each side of the lesion) were rapidly snap frozen
in liquid nitrogen. Uninjured Glast-Rasless-YFP mice with identical genotype received vehicle and were used as controls (n = 4).

 RNA extraction and quality control
The tissue was disrupted and homogenized in Buffer RLT (QIAGEN) and using FastPrep Cell Disrupter (Thermo Electron). The tissue
was placed in the FastPrep tubes together with 350 ml RLT buffer and run for 4 s at setting 6, followed by centrifugation at 4�C for 5 min
at 12 000 rpm. The water phase were carefully collected and transferred to the AllPrep spin column (QIAGEN) and centrifuged for 30 s
at 10 000 rpm. The elute were transferred to a new tube (Eppendorf) and the protocol for AllPrep DNA/RNA/protein for tissue samples
were resumed from step 6 according to manufacture’s instructions for RNA extraction (QIAGEN). The concentration of the extracted
RNA was determined using Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit (Life Technologies) and quality of the total RNA was determined using the RNA
6000 Nano chip on the 2100 Bioanalyzer automated electrophoresis system (Agilent Technologies).
Library preparation and sequencing
Total RNA was used for library preparation of each sample, which was subsequently bar-coded and prepared according to manu-
facturer’s instructions (Illumina). The libraries were clustered on a cBot cluster-generation system using an Illumina HiSeq paired-end
cluster-generation kit and sequenced as paired-end, 2x100 bp on the Illumina HiSeq 2000. All lanes were spiked with 1% phiX control
library. The sequencing run was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and generated a total of 487 million read
pairs with a median of 17 million read pairs per sample.
Sequence read alignment and analysis
All sequences were aligned to the mouse genome reference mm9 with TopHat (Trapnell et al., 2009) version 1.3.3 and duplicates
were removed using Picard Tools (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard) version 1.29. Fragments per kilobase of exon per million
mapped fragments (FPKM) values for features were calculated by Cufflinks (Trapnell et al., 2010) version 1.3.0 and the raw read
counts were generated using HTSeq (Anders et al., 2015) version 0.5.1. The R/Bioconductor package DESeq (Anders and Huber,
2010) was used to call differential gene expression on counts generated by HTSeq. To identify transcripts that were differentially ex-
pressed between vehicle and tamoxifen groups, we defined a criteria of a 1.5-fold and greater difference plus a significant (p < 0.05)
false discovery rate (FDR).
Pathway analysis was carried out using the QIAGEN’s Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, QIAGEN Redwood City, https://www.
qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis). The top ten canonical pathways differentially enriched (fold
change > 1.5, p < 0.05) in lesions from vehicle versus tamoxifen animals 2 weeks after injury are presented.
Gene ontology analysis was performed using The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID (Huang
et al., 2009a, 2009b) bioinformatics tools. The top ten gene ontology terms (biological process, molecular function and cellular
component) significantly enriched in injury sites from vehicle versus tamoxifen animals 2 weeks after injury are presented (fold
change > 1.5, p < 0.05).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Sample sizes were determined based on previous experience. No statistical methods have been used to predetermine sample size.
Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). For some graphs individual data points are plotted. Sample sizes (n)
of animals, number of biological repeats of experiments and statistical methods used are indicated in the corresponding figure leg-
ends. All datasets were tested for Gaussian distribution using the Shapiro–Wilk test. In some instances sample groups were too small
to test for Gaussian distribution (< 8 samples) and parametric tests were preferred because nonparametric tests lack suitable power
to detect differences in small sample groups. p values were calculated using two-tailed unpaired or paired Student’s t test, Mann-
Whitney U-test and one way- or two-way ANOVA. Repeated-measures were applied when appropriate. Post hoc correction tests
were employed following significance with an ANOVA and described in the legend of the respective figure. For correlation analyses,
Pearson correlation coefficients (Pearson r) and p values are reported.
Differences were considered statistically significant at p values below 0.05. All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version
6.0g software for Mac.

 Figure S1. Genetic Strategy to Modulate the Generation of Type A Pericyte Progeny, Related to Figure 1
(A–D) Cross sections of the spinal cord of Glast-YFP (A, B) and Glast-Rasless-YFP (C, D) mice showing recombined (YFP+) type A pericytes (PDGFRb+) tightly
associated with the vasculature (podocalyxin+) under uninjured conditions (A, C) and type A pericyte-derived cells in the injured spinal cord 5 days after a dorsal
funiculus incision (B, D). White arrowheads point at type A pericyte-derived cells that detached from the blood vessel wall.
(E–H) Cross sections of uninjured (E, G) and injured spinal cord 5 dpi (F, H) showing proliferation (EdU incorporation) of recombined pericytes and progeny in
Glast-YFP (E, F) and Glast-Rasless-YFP (G, H) mice. White and yellow arrowheads in E, G depict cells single positive for EdU and YFP, respectively. White
arrowheads in F, H show YFP+ cells that incorporated EdU.
(I) Density of recombined (Rec.) and non-recombined (Non rec.) PDGFRb-expressing stromal cells in the uninjured and injured spinal cord 5 dpi of Glast-YFP and
Glast-Rasless-YFP mice. Following injury, the number of recombined pericyte-derived stromal cells per area is greatly reduced in Glast-Rasless-YFP mice
compared to Glast-YFP control mice.
(J) Proportion of PDGFRb-expressing cells associated with (ON vessel) or detached from (OFF vessel) the blood vessel wall in the uninjured and injured spinal
cord 5 dpi of Glast-Rasless-YFP and control Glast-YFP mice. Under homeostatic conditions all pericytes are associated with the vasculature in both Glast-YFP
and Glast-Rasless-YFP animals. Upon injury, the percentage of PDGFRb+ cells located in distance to the blood vessel wall is greatly reduced in Glast-Rasless-
YFP mice paralleled by a higher percentage of cells remaining associated with the vessel compared to control Glast-YFP animals.
(K) Density of proliferating and non-proliferating PDGFRb-expressing cells in the uninjured and injured spinal cord 5 dpi of Glast-Rasless-YFP and Glast-YFP
control animals. In the uninjured spinal cord, PDGFRb+ pericytes did not incorporate EdU in neither Glast-Rasless-YFP nor Glast-YFP mice. Injury-induced
proliferation of PDGFRb+ stromal cells is greatly decreased in Glast-Rasless-YFP mice compared to control Glast-YFP animals. The density of non-proliferating
stromal cells is not significantly altered.
(L) Percentage of proliferating and non-proliferating recombined PDGFRb-expressing cells in the uninjured and injured spinal cord 5 dpi of Glast-Rasless-YFP
and Glast-YFP control animals. Under homeostatic conditions virtually no recombined cells incorporate EdU in Glast-Rasless-YFP or Glast-YFP mice. The
proliferation of recombined PDGFRb+ cells induced by the injury is dramatically decreased in Glast-Rasless-YFP animals compared to control Glast-YFP mice.
This gives a relative increase in the proportion of non-proliferative recombined cells.
(M–R) Low power photographs and sagittal view of the spinal cord of Glast-Rasless-YFP mice showing dense (vehicle; M, P), reduced (intermediate recom-
bination penetrance, Tam; N, Q) or low/no (full recombination penetrance, Tam-def; O, R) PDGFRb+ fibrotic scarring at the injury site 2 weeks after a dorsal
hemisection. Dashed circles mark the injured area and border a tissue defect (*) in R. Images in P, Q are the same as in Figures 1B and 1C, respectively.
