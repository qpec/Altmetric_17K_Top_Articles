Geographic Accessibility Of Food
Outlets Not Associated With Body
Mass Index Change Among
Veterans, 2009–14
ABSTRACT In recent years, various levels of government in the United
States have adopted or discussed subsidies, tax breaks, zoning laws, and
other public policies that promote geographic access to healthy food.
However, there is little evidence from large-scale longitudinal or
quasi-experimental research to suggest that the local mix of food outlets
actually affects body mass index (BMI). We used a longitudinal design to
examine whether the proximity of food outlets, by type, was associated
with BMI changes between 2009 and 2014 among 1.7 million veterans in
382 metropolitan areas. We found no evidence that either absolute or
relative geographic accessibility of supermarkets, fast-food restaurants, or
mass merchandisers was associated with changes in an individual’s BMI
over time. While policies that alter only geographic access to food outlets
may promote equitable access to healthy food and improve nutrition, our
findings suggest they will do little to combat obesity in adults.
T
o promote geographic access to
healthy food and help combat obe-
sity, various levels of government
in the United States have adopted
subsidies, tax breaks, zoning laws,
and other public policy instruments, or are con-
sidering such actions.1,2 For example, healthy
food financing initiatives offer subsidies and
tax breaks to open new stores or renovate exist-
ing stores in underserved areas.1,3 Most subsidy
programs target supermarkets because they
offer the widest selection of healthy food and
beverage items.4–7 Other governmental bodies
are taking a different direction and trying to
reduce access to unhealthy food, using fast-food
restaurant moratoriums and zoning policies that
restrict or ban new fast-food restaurants in
so-called overserved neighborhoods.8–10 In addi-
tion, local zoning laws and ordinances, includ-
ing restrictions on store size, design guidelines,
and formula business regulations,11,12 restrict
the entry of the supercenters and other mass
merchandisers—that is, Walmart, Target, and
other large stores that sell a large variety of food
and other merchandise—that are a primary
source of food for American households.13,14
Access to different types of food outlets varies
across neighborhoods.15–18 Several studies have
found that people with better geographic access
to supermarkets tend to have lower body mass
index (BMI) and lower rates of obesity, and
that people with better access to fast-food restau-
rants tend to have higher BMI and higher rates
of obesity.19–23 Evidence on associations between
mass-merchandiser accessibility and BMI is
scarce.24–26 Research has also found associations
between the relative balance of healthier to less
healthy food outlets and BMI.27–30 However,
almost all studies to date of the absolute and
relative accessibility of food outlets used cross-
sectional designs.19–21 Results of cross-sectional
studies may reflect unmeasured differences in
preferences across people who chose to live near
food outlets, rather than the causal effect of the

 food outlets themselves.31
A few quasi-experimental studies have exam-
ined policies encouraging supermarket develop-
ment and those placing moratoriums on fast-
food restaurant entry and found little support
for the idea that policies that support or restrict
food outlets affect BMI.8,32–34 However, these
studies were conducted on a small scale and
examined the connection between food-outlet
access and BMI in small geographic areas.
Small-scale studies may lack generalizability
and have limited statistical power to detect
health changes. Well-designed longitudinal re-
search that supports causal inference and can
examine the effects of many supermarket, fast-
food restaurant, and mass-merchandiser open-
ings or closings across a wide geographic area
can strengthen the evidence base and inform
discussions on whether public policies that ad-
dress the food environment are likely to be effec-
tive in achieving healthier BMI.
This article reports results from the Weight
and Veterans’ Environments Study (WAVES)—
to our knowledge, the largest national study of
the connection between residential environ-
ments and BMI ever conducted in the United
States.35 The project is at the forefront of “big
data” research, linking electronic health records
from veterans nationwide with public and pro-
prietary environmental data. It provides the sta-
tistical power needed to detect small effects of
the environment on clinical measures of BMI.
The data enable research designs that exploit
temporal and spatial changes in environmental
conditions over a seven-year period and help
avoid bias from a broad set of factors un-
controlled for in earlier research.
The analysis in this article focuses on super-
markets, fast-food restaurants, and mass mer-
chandisers. The premise of the policy debate
is that people gain or lose weight because of
their geographic access to these food outlets.
Often the debate is focused on high-poverty
neighborhoods, where obesity is an important
health concern, access to supermarkets may be
limited, and fast-food restaurants may be con-
centrated.15,16,36,37 Our analysis tested the null
hypothesis that geographic accessibility of food
outlets does not have an important effect on
BMI. To shed light on the socioeconomic gradi-
ent, we also examined whether the association
between food outlet access and BMI differs by
neighborhood poverty level. Rejecting the null
hypothesis statistically and finding clinically
meaningful associations between food outlet
access and BMI would provide evidence in favor
of the policy view that geographic access to food
outlets matters.
Study Data And Methods
Design WAVES is a retrospective longitudinal
cohort study of US veterans who received health
care services from the Department of Veteran
Affairs (VA) in the period 2009–14.35 We linked
the first six years of individual-level data from
the VA Corporate Data Warehouse, a repository
of clinical and administrative data from electron-
ic health records and other sources, to secondary
data on food outlet locations to study the effects
of person-level changes in the food environment
generated by food outlet openings or closings
in a person’s neighborhood and individual
migration—that is, a person’s moving to a new
address, which might change the number and
types of food outlets in his or her neighborhood.
Sample The analytical sample consisted of
1.7 million people ages 20–64 who collectively
resided in 382 metropolitan areas. We excluded
people without at least one VA health care en-
counter in the two years prior to our baseline
year, with a long-term nursing home stay at base-
line, without at least one geocoded home ad-
dress, and without at least one valid height
and weight measurement. For each person in
the sample, the analytical data set contains
one record for each year in which VA records
included a valid geocoded address and at least
one weight measurement.
Measures
▸ BODY MASS INDEX: We calculated each per-
son’s BMI in each year using height and weight
measurements taken during patient encounters.
When multiple height measures were available
for a person, we used the modal value of the
person’s height across the study period. When
multiple weights were available for a person
within a calendar year, we used the average
weight during the second half of the calendar
year. This helped ensure that the weight mea-
sures were taken after the corresponding geo-
graphic measures.
▸ GEOGRAPHIC ACCESSIBILITY OF FOOD OUT-
LETS: We constructed annual measures of the
geographic accessibility of chain supermarkets,
nonchain supermarkets, supercenters and other
mass merchandisers, chain fast-food restau-
rants, and nonchain fast-food restaurants for
each person and year. Specifically, we measured
the number of outlets within one mile and
the number of those within three miles of the
person’s residence. We defined relative accessi-
bility of supermarkets—or the accessibility of
supermarkets compared to that of fast-food
restaurants—as the number of supermarkets ex-
pressed as a percentage of the number of both
supermarkets and fast-food restaurants. In the
analysis, food outlet accessibility was defined
using a set of dummy variables, and the reference

 category typically consisted of people who lived
near no such outlets.
▸ COVARIATES: Individual time-invariant var-
iables were age at baseline and race/ethnicity.
Individual time-varying covariates were marital
status and ten chronic health conditions. Area
covariates were time-varying measures of census
division,
county-level
urbanicity,38,39
census-
tract demographic characteristics (poverty rate,
median household income, and population den-
sity), and geographic accessibility of grocery
stores, convenience stores, parks, and fitness
facilities.
Data Analysis We estimated cross-sectional
models with year fixed effects and longitudinal
models that incorporated both year and person
fixed effects. The models with person fixed ef-
fects adjusted for a broad class of potential con-
founding factors thatcouldhaveunderminedthe
internal validity of cross-sectional regressions.
In particular, cross-sectional models might be
biased because of residential self-selection. In
other words, cross-sectional associations be-
tween food-outlet accessibility and BMI might
reflect preferences or other unmeasured charac-
teristics associated with both where a person
lived and his or her BMI. The models that includ-
ed person fixed effects avoided biases from any
unmeasured confounders that were time-invari-
ant by focusing on within-person changes in
food-outlet accessibility. Both the cross-section-
al and fixed-effects models accounted for secular
trends using period fixed effects.
In the full analytic sample, models that includ-
ed person fixed effects exploited two different
sources of within-person change in food-outlet
accessibility: changes from individual migration
that occurred when a person moved to a new
address with a net change in the number of spe-
cific food outlets, and changes that occurred
when food outlets opened or closed in a neigh-
borhood.
The distinction may be important because res-
idential self-selection bias could still be a prob-
lem among people who changed addresses. For
example, people may decide to move to a neigh-
borhood where supermarkets are more accessi-
ble because a negative health event had made it
harder for them to travel or because of a change
in their lifestyle preferences. In such cases, even
the fixed-effects model could be biased, because
unmeasured changes in health status or prefer-
ences could affect both BMI and food outlet ac-
cessibility. To explore these concerns, we esti-
mated separate fixed-effects models for people
who did not change addresses. These models
were based exclusively on variation that came
from the opening or closing of food outlets.
Associations for people who did not move
(referred to here as “nonmigrants”) were less
liable to residential self-selection bias because
individuals have very little control over the entry
or exit of food outlets. That is, any individual-
level changes in health status or preferences that
occur are unlikely to cause or be correlated with
the outlets’ opening or closing. The nonmigrant
fixed-effects models strengthened our infer-
ences about the causal effects of food outlets
on BMI.
We fitted two specifications of each model. The
first set of models was based on food outlets
within one mile of the person’s residence. The
second setwas based on thosewithinthreemiles.
To examine whether associations differed by ar-
ea economic characteristics, we added terms for
interactions between the food outlet variables
and census-tract poverty level. Poverty was cate-
gorized using nationwide census-tract tertiles.
All models accounted for clustering of individu-
als within counties at baseline. Because men con-
stituted almost 90 percent of the sample, we
estimated separate models for men and women.
Limitations There were limitations associated
with the data and methods used in our study.
First, we were unable to incorporate measures
that captured individual socioeconomic status.
Therefore, while we controlled for multiple cen-
sus-tract socioeconomic characteristics, residual
confounding related to changes in individuals’
socioeconomic status is possible.
Second, our use of modal height measurement
across the study period to calculate BMI does not
capture the height loss that may occur with ag-
ing. Given that our study included only people
younger than sixty-five at baseline—with mean
ages of fifty-two and forty-three for men and
women, respectively (Exhibit 1)—and that the
study follow-up time was not morethan six years,
we think that undetected measurable height loss
was likely to be infrequent and was unlikely to
generate bias in the effects of food-outlet acces-
sibility on BMI.
Third, commercial sources of data about retail
food outlets are liable to error. We carefully
cleaned and processed the data to maximize its
quality.40
Fourth, this study included measures of only
the geographic accessibility of food outlets. We
did not consider other dimensions of access or
food availability, prices, quality, or marketing
inside these outlets, which could affect purchas-
ing and ultimately BMI.
Fifth, like most previous studies, ours focused
on the accessibility of food outlets relative to
where people live, rather than where they spend
time—which might more accurately capture
their exposure to the outlets.41

SOURCE Authors’ analysis of data on participants for 2009–14 from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse, urbanicity data for 2006 and 2013 (see Note 39 in text) from the
National Center for Health Statistics; demographic data on census tracts for 2005–14 from the Census Bureau, food store data for 2008–13 from InfoUSA, and fast-food
restaurant data for 2008–13 from Dun and Bradstreet. NOTE BMI is body mass index. aDid not move to a new address during the study period. bFor food outlets for which
less than 50 percent of the sample had an outlet within 1 mile (chain supermarkets, nonchain supermarkets, and mass merchandisers), we used a binary variable (0, or 1 or
more). cFor food outlets for which at least 10 percent of the sample had no outlet within one mile (chain fast-food restaurants and nonchain fast-food restaurants), we
used a four-category variable (0 and the tertiles of the nonzero distribution of values). dA five-category variable was used for relative accessibility of supermarkets to fast-
food restaurants (the number of supermarkets as a percentage of the number of both supermarkets and fast-food restaurants) within one mile: no supermarket or fast-
food restaurant; low (no supermarket but at least one fast-food restaurant); and the tertiles of the remaining nonzero distribution (low to middle: 0.4–9.1 percent; middle
to high: 9.1–16.7 percent; and high: 16.8–100 percent).

 segment of the US population, but the 1.7 million
VA patients in our study are not a representative
sample of the US adult population. For example,
our study population has disproportionately
more African Americans and people with lower
incomes, both groups at higher risk for obesity.35
And men in the VA population are older and
demographically different from the women in
it, which means that our findings for men and
women are not directly comparable. While our
study’s internal validity may be high, and VA
patients live in diverse neighborhoods nation-
wide that are broadly representative of the envi-
ronments in which the bulk of the US population
resides, the study’s external validity is unknown.
That is, it is unclear whether the effects of geo-
graphic access to food outlets observed in the VA
population are comparable to the effects in the
general population.
Finally, our study generally estimated average
effects of geographic access to food outlets.While
we examined the heterogeneity of effects by
neighborhood poverty level, we could not rule
out the possibility that effects are heterogeneous
across other groups of people (for example, the
subset of people without a car).

Study Results
Exhibit 1 shows selected characteristics of the
sample in the baseline year (the first year in
which a person met the criteria for inclusion)
and of where members of the sample lived (for
more characteristics, see Appendix Exhibit B).42
We found no evidence that area poverty level
altered
the
relationship
between
BMI
and
food-outlet accessibility in either cross-sectional
or longitudinal models (not shown).
To avoid inappropriate comparisons between
men and women, regression results are pre-
sented below first for men and then for women
(for complete regression results, see Appendix
Exhibits C and D).42 Exhibit 2 shows results from
cross-sectional and longitudinal regressions of
BMI on measures of the geographic accessibility
of chain and nonchain supermarkets, mass mer-
chandisers, and chain and nonchain fast-food
restaurants within one mile and three miles of
the residence of members of the sample.
Men
▸ CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS TO FOOD
OUTLETS: In the cross-sectional model, neither
chain nor nonchain supermarket access within
one mile was associated with BMI among men
(Exhibit 2). However, access to one or more
mass merchandisers within one mile was associ-
ated with a 0.123-unit higher BMI compared to
those with no mass merchandisers within one
mile. Living within one mile of a greater number
of chainfast-foodrestaurantswas alsoassociated
with higher BMI (Exhibit 1). However, living
within one mile of 3–6 nonchain fast-food res-
taurants was associated with a 0.062-unit lower
BMI, and having 7 or more such restaurants
within a mile was associated with a 0.206-unit
lower BMI, again compared to those with no
nonchain fast-food restaurants within a mile.
Having four or more nonchain supermarkets
within three miles was associated with a 0.080-
unit lower BMI compared to those with no such
supermarkets within three miles. Associations
between BMI and mass-merchandiser accessibil-
ity within three miles were generally stronger
than those between BMI and accessibility within
one mile, with coefficients as large as 0.283.
Chain fast-food restaurant accessibility was not
associated with BMI, while the associations be-
tween BMI and nonchain fast-food restaurant
accessibility remained negative when we consid-
ered accessibility within three miles.
▸
LONGITUDINAL
ASSOCIATIONS
TO
FOOD
OUTLETS: In the longitudinal model, associa-
tions for the full sample of men between BMI
and access to food outlets were weak, and the
relatively few statistically significant associa-
tions were not clinically meaningful using dis-
tances of either one mile or three miles (Exhib-
it 2). The strongest association with BMI was
having three or more mass merchandisers within
three miles. Even there, the coefficient of 0.026
was still very small in a clinical sense. To put the
effect in context, a 0.026-unit increase in BMI
amounts to gaining 0.18 pounds for a man who is
5 feet 10 inches tall. Among nonmigrant men,
the longitudinal associations were generally
nonsignificant and weaker than among the full
sample.
▸ ASSOCIATIONS TO RELATIVE ACCESSIBILITY
OF SUPERMARKETS: Exhibit 3 shows associa-
tions between BMI and the relative accessibility
of supermarkets to fast-food restaurants, hold-
ing constant the accessibility of other outlet
types. In general, this relative accessibility was
not significantly associated with BMI cross-
sectionally or longitudinally for either the full
sample of men or nonmigrant men alone.
Women
▸ CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS TO FOOD
OUTLETS: Among women in the study, cross-
sectional associations with BMI were not signifi-
cant for accessibility of chain supermarkets,
nonchain supermarkets, or mass merchandisers
within one mile (Exhibit 2). Having chain fast-
food restaurants within one mile was associated
with higher BMI—for example, increases of
0.139 units for 3–6 restaurants and 0.168 units

 for 7 or more, compared to those with no chain
fast-food restaurants within one mile. However,
living within one mile of 3–6 nonchain fast-food
restaurants was associated with a 0.130-unit low-
er BMI, and when the number of restaurants
increased to 7 or more, BMI was 0.426 units
lower, compared to those with no such restau-
rants within one mile.
In the cross-sectional model for food outlets
within three miles, chain supermarket accessi-
bility was not associated with BMI among wom-
en. Accessibility of nonchain supermarkets was
associated with a 0.073-unit higher BMI for one
such outlet and a 0.104-unit higher BMI for two
or three, compared to those with no such super-
markets within three miles. BMI tended to in-
crease along with the number of mass merchan-
disers within three miles, with coefficients as
high as 0.338 for three or more of these outlets.
Chain fast-food restaurant accessibility was not
associated with BMI, but BMI decreased signifi-
cantly at higher levels of nonchain fast-food res-

LONGITUDINAL
ASSOCIATIONS
TO
FOOD
OUTLETS: There was little evidence from the lon-
gitudinal models that BMI was associated with
accessibility of any of the types of food outlets
within either one or three miles for the full sam-
ple of women or nonmigrant women.
▸ ASSOCIATIONS TO RELATIVE ACCESSIBILITY
OF SUPERMARKETS: In the cross-sectional mod-
el, relative accessibility of supermarkets to fast-
food restaurants within one mile was not associ-
ated with BMI for women (Exhibit 3). Within
three miles, women with middle to high and
high relative accessibility of supermarkets had
BMI 0.100 units and 0.140 units higher, respec-
tively, compared to women with low relative ac-
cessibility. However, these relative accessibility
effects disappeared in the longitudinal models in
both the full sample of women and the non-
migrant women.
Discussion
We found that multiple policy-relevant aspects of
the food environment were associated with BMI
in cross-sectional comparisons using clinical da-
ta on 1.7 million veterans nationwide. Specifical-
ly, people living in areas with high accessibility
of chain fast-food restaurants within one mile
and of mass merchandisers within three miles
(and within one mile for men only) tended to
have higher BMI, while men living in areas with
high accessibility of nonchain supermarkets
within three miles tended to have lower BMI.
However, in longitudinal analyses that ad-
dressed important limitations of cross-sectional
research (particularly residential self-selection
bias), we found almost no evidence that absolute
or relative geographic accessibility of supermar-
kets, fast-food restaurants, or mass merchandis-
ers affected BMI. Moreover, the significant
cross-sectional associations in unexpected direc-
tions disappeared in the longitudinal analyses.
Regarding the effects of neighborhood pover-
ty, we found no support for the idea that food-
outlet access matters most to people living in
high-poverty neighborhoods. Specifically, there
was no evidence that area poverty level altered
the relationship between food-outlet accessibili-
ty and BMI.
Our study adds to a still small but growing
number of longitudinal studies that have gener-
ally found that food outlets have either no effect
on BMI oreffects that aresmall in magnitude and
not clinically meaningful.43–49 Our findings sug-
gest that cross-sectional results should be inter-
preted with caution and that it is unlikely that
additional cross-sectional research will provide
needed insights into whether geographic acces-
sibility of supermarkets, fast-food restaurants,
or mass merchandisers is a promising target
for policy interventions to promote healthier
BMI. One important area where additional lon-
gitudinal research would be useful is in popula-
tions with low socioeconomic status. For exam-
ple, a longitudinal analysis of the Panel Study of
Income Dynamics showed that each additional
supermarket per 10,000 people per ten square
miles was associated with a 0.130-unit lower BMI
longitudinally among poor women but was not

 associated with BMI among nonpoor women or
among poor or nonpoor men.49 Longitudinal as-
sociations between fast-food restaurant accessi-
bility and BMI were not clinically meaningful
in either poor or nonpoor women or men in that
study.
Overall, our findings suggest that public poli-
cies to alter the residential geographic accessi-
bility of supermarkets, fast-food restaurants, or
mass merchandisers alone are unlikely to be ef-
fective in promoting healthier BMI in adults.
However, our study did not address the possibil-
ity that policy-induced changes in food-outlet
accessibility could have beneficial effects on
BMI in children or could lead to other positive
changes, such as improved nutrition, increased
neighborhood economic activity, job creation,
and improvements in individual income.
Our findings are consistent with the possibili-
ty that, to reduce the risk of obesity, changes in
food access may need to be accompanied by fiscal
policies that alter the relative prices of healthy
and unhealthy foods and beverages. Beyond sup-
porting new food outlets and limiting others,
policies addressing the availability, prices, and
marketing of food products within food outlets
may be useful.33,50 For example, strengthening
the requirements to stock healthy food items
in outlets participating in federal programs such
as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Pro-
gram could serve to transform the product mix
in food stores that currently favor unhealthy
products.7,51–53
The strength of our study comes from the use
of a large, nationwide, longitudinal, geocoded
sample of health care records. That data set made
it possible to construct person-specific measures
of the food environment and provided the kind
of sample size required to reliably measure even
small associations between BMI and the geo-
graphic accessibility of a variety of food outlets.
In addition, the structure of the data allowed us
to take advantage of changes in people’s expo-
sure to different food outlets that arose through
processes of neighborhood change and individ-
ual migration. Variation in food environments
from neighborhood change seems to be a useful
way of avoiding many of the sources of potential
bias in the current literature. Because our study
included people living across the country, it was
feasible to study the differential effects of the
food environment on people living in higher-
poverty neighborhoods. Unlike many survey-
based studies, our study allowed us to study
BMI using clinical measurements rather than
less accurate self-reports. And because our sam-
ple consisted of veterans using VA health care,
our study implicitly controlled for health insur-
ance status and access to health care services that
might confound associations in other samples.
Conclusion
Public policy may have an important role to play
in achieving populationwide reductions in BMI.
But the policies currently under discussion,
based on assumptions of a causal link between
food outlet access and BMI, lack support from
rigorous empirical analysis. Strategies like the
healthy food financing initiatives are designed
to alter geographic access to supermarkets, fast-
food restaurants, and mass merchandisers. It is
possible that such policies will promote equity in
access to healthy foods and reduce the saturation
of unhealthy food sources in economically and
socially disadvantaged neighborhoods. But our
findings suggest that such policies alone are un-
likely to lead to healthier BMI over time among
adults. ▪
