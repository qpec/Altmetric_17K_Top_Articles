BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on dialysis 
were excluded from clinical trials of direct oral anticoagulants for atrial 
fibrillation (AF). Recent data have raised concerns regarding the safety of 
dabigatran and rivaroxaban, but apixaban has not been evaluated despite 
current labeling supporting its use in this population. The goal of this study 
was to determine patterns of apixaban use and its associated outcomes in 
dialysis-dependent patients with ESKD and AF.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of Medicare 
beneficiaries included in the United States Renal Data System (October 2010 to 
December 2015). Eligible patients were those with ESKD and AF undergoing 
dialysis who initiated treatment with an oral anticoagulant. Because of the small 
number of dabigatran and rivaroxaban users, outcomes were only assessed in 
patients treated with apixaban or warfarin. Apixaban and warfarin patients were 
matched (1:3) based on prognostic score. Differences between groups in survival 
free of stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, 
intracranial bleeding, and death were assessed using Kaplan‒Meier analyses. 
Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were derived from Cox regression analyses.
RESULTS: The study population consisted of 25 
523 patients (45.7% women; 
68.2±11.9 years of age), including 2351 patients on apixaban and 23 
172 
patients on warfarin. An annual increase in apixaban prescriptions was 
observed after its marketing approval at the end of 2012, such that 26.6% 
of new anticoagulant prescriptions in 2015 were for apixaban. In matched 
cohorts, there was no difference in the risks of stroke/systemic embolism 
between apixaban and warfarin (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.69–1.12; P=0.29), but 
apixaban was associated with a significantly lower risk of major bleeding (HR, 
0.72; 95% CI, 0.59–0.87; P<0.001). In sensitivity analyses,  standard-dose 
apixaban (5 mg twice a day; n=1034) was associated with significantly lower 
risks of stroke/systemic embolism and death as compared with either reduced-
dose apixaban (2.5 mg twice a day; n=1317; HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37–0.98; 
P=0.04 for stroke/systemic embolism; HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.45–0.92; P=0.01 
for death) or warfarin (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42–0.97; P=0.04 for stroke/
systemic embolism; HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46–0.85; P=0.003 for death).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with ESKD and AF on dialysis, apixaban 
use may be associated with a lower risk of major bleeding compared with 
warfarin, with a standard 5 mg twice a day dose also associated with 
reductions in thromboembolic and mortality risk.

E
nd-stage kidney disease (ESKD) increases throm-
boembolic risk among patients with atrial fibrilla-
tion (AF),1 and AF has been associated with poor 
outcomes in ESKD.2,3 However, the prevention of AF-
related morbidity in the dialysis-dependent ESKD pop-
ulation is challenging. Use of warfarin in patients on 
dialysis may be associated with higher rates of bleeding 
compared with other populations, and some observa-
tional studies have even questioned its overall effective-
ness in preventing strokes in patients with AF on dialy-
sis.4,5 Thus, uncertainty remains regarding the optimal 
utilization of anticoagulation for stroke prophylaxis in 
patients with ESKD and AF.
The direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) have changed 
the landscape of stroke prevention in AF in the general 
population, and these drugs have been widely adopted 
in recent years.6,7 However, DOACs have varying de-
grees of renal clearance, and their safety and effec-
tiveness in ESKD are uncertain. The pivotal trials that 
were the basis of the US Food and Drug Administration 
approval of DOACs in the United States did not enroll 
patients with ESKD.8–11 Therefore, use of DOACs for 
AF in patients with ESKD on dialysis is not endorsed by 
US or European professional guidelines, and warfarin 
remains the recommended agent for those considered 
suitable for anticoagulation.12–14 Early data suggest, 
however, that off-label use of dabigatran and rivar-
oxaban in patients on dialysis is occurring in routine 
clinical practice and may be associated with adverse 
outcomes.15 No data regarding the utilization of apixa-
ban and its associated clinical outcomes exist to date. 
However, based on pharmacokinetic data, the US Food 
and Drug Administration approved an updated label-
ing recommending standard-dose apixaban in patients 
on hemodialysis.
Accordingly, goals of the present study were to (1) 
characterize contemporary use of apixaban in patients 
with AF and ESKD undergoing dialysis in the United 
States, and (2) determine its associations with measures 
of clinical safety and effectiveness in this population as 
compared with warfarin.
METHODS
The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be 
made available to other researchers for purposes of repro-
ducing the results or replicating the procedure. This study 
was performed under the US Renal Data System (USRDS) 
Coordinating Center contract with the National Institutes of 
Health/National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney 
Diseases; research being performed as part of the contract 
has been approved by the University of Michigan Institutional 
Review Board. Because data for the USRDS components are 
collected by federal mandate, there are no individual patient 
consent requirements.
Data Source and Study Population
The study population was derived from the USRDS, a national 
system that collects, analyzes, and distributes information about 
chronic kidney disease, including ESKD, in the United States. 
Among patients with ESKD included in the USRDS, we used 
Medicare Part D prescription information to identify patients 
who were prescribed dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or 
warfarin between October 2010 (coinciding with the initial 
approval of dabigatran) and December 2015. We restricted 
the population to patients with (1) continuous Medicare Parts 
A, B, and D enrollment, and (2) Medicare as primary insurer 
in the 12 months before the first anticoagulant prescription. 
Furthermore, we identified eligible patients with an inpatient 
or outpatient International Classification of Diseases, Ninth or 
Tenth Revisions  diagnosis code for AF or atrial flutter16 (collec-
tively referred to as AF in this study) during the same period, 
excluding patients with mitral stenosis or heart valve replace-
ment/repair procedure before the anticoagulant prescription 
in accordance with the 2014 American College of Cardiology/
American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society definition 
of valvular AF.12 Although the DOACs are emerging as safe 
and effective in patients with repaired or bioprosthetic heart 
valves,17 we excluded these patients because data supporting 
their use in this population arose in or after 2015. Thus, these 
patients may have been more likely to receive warfarin rather 
than DOACs during the period of this study.
We only included patients with AF diagnosis within 1 year 
before the anticoagulant prescription and excluded patients 
with an anticoagulant prescription 1 year to 30 days before 
their first AF diagnosis to exclude anticoagulation prescriptions 
for indications other than AF. For example, patients with a 
remote diagnosis claim for AF that was isolated and nonrecur-
rent (such as a perioperative AF episode) may have been pre-
scribed anticoagulation subsequently for another indication. 
The requirement for temporal proximity of the AF diagnosis 
and the anticoagulation start also increases the specificity of 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• The outcomes of apixaban use in patients on dialy-
sis are unknown.
• In this retrospective, prognostic score‒matched 
analysis of Medicare beneficiaries with end-stage 
kidney disease on dialysis and atrial fibrillation, 
apixaban was associated with lower rates of 
major bleeding compared with warfarin, whereas 
there was no difference in stroke or systemic 
embolism.
• Patients on standard-dose apixaban (5 mg) had 
lower rates of stroke and death compared with 
those on reduced dose apixaban (2.5 mg).
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Apixaban may be associated with superior safety 
and comparable effectiveness outcomes as warfa-
rin in patients with AF on dialysis.
• These findings require confirmation in randomized 
trials.

the diagnosis claims-based approach for definition of the AF 
cohort. Finally, we restricted the eligible population to patients 
who were on dialysis (intermittent hemodialysis or peritoneal 
dialysis) at the time of the anticoagulation prescription (see 
Table I and Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement for 
further details on the cohort-selection process).
Because we identified a small number of patients with 
dabigatran (n=260) and rivaroxaban (n=328) prescriptions 
and because the outcomes with the use of these medications 
in patients on dialysis have been previously addressed,15 we 
restricted our analyses to comparisons of apixaban and war-
farin only.
Baseline Variables
Using the CMS-2728 ESKD Medical Evidence form, we docu-
mented characteristics of ESKD care, such as number of years 
on dialysis, duration of pre-ESKD nephrology care, and type of 
medical coverage (private versus nonprivate). Comorbidities 
were ascertained based on International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revisions diagnosis codes from 
Medicare Parts A and B claims (1 inpatient or 2 outpatient 
claims within 1 year before the anticoagulation prescription), 
and the use of 16 classes of concomitant medications was 
documented by using Part D prescription information. Baseline 
medications were considered as concomitant if a patient had 
residual supply (based on fill date and available number of 
refills) at the time of the initial anticoagulation prescription. 
It is important to note that aspirin is not captured accurately 
in prescriptions claims because many patients obtain aspirin 
over the counter; therefore, use of aspirin was unavailable.
Follow-Up and Outcome Definitions
The date of the initial anticoagulation prescription was con-
sidered time 0 for this analysis. To maximize capture of new 
apixaban prescriptions, patients who were originally pre-
scribed warfarin and then switched to apixaban were only 
included in the apixaban group with time 0 the date of the 
first apixaban prescription. Patients were followed until study 
end (December 31, 2015) or until death or censoring. Patients 
were censored at follow-up for the following reasons: expira-
tion of anticoagulation prescription or >30-day gap between 
prescription refills (accounting for total days and number of 
refills supplied); discontinuation of dialysis because of kidney 
function recovery or kidney transplantation (unless a patient 
died within 21 days of dialysis discontinuation, in which case 
it was considered a death rather than censored event); switch 
from apixaban to warfarin or to a different DOAC; lapse of 
Medicare Part A, B, or D enrollment or lapse of Medicare as 
primary payer status; and incidence of a heart valve diagnosis 
or procedure code any time after time 0.
We assessed the following incident outcomes after time 0 
using inpatient claims in the primary or secondary diagnosis 
position: ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (SE), which-
ever occurred first; major bleeding; gastrointestinal (GI) bleed-
ing; intracranial bleeding; and death. Bleeding was considered 
major when it was associated with a critical site code (such 
as intracranial), need for blood product transfusion based on 
a procedure code during the same admission, or death.18,19 
Further details on diagnosis codes and outcomes definitions 
are provided in Table I in the online-only Data Supplement.
Statistical Analysis
We report the overall number of eligible patients with AF on 
dialysis prescribed anticoagulants, and we present trends of 
new apixaban prescriptions per year relative to dabigatran, 
rivaroxaban, and warfarin over the study period. Categorical 
variables are reported as frequencies and percentages, 
whereas continuous variables are reported as means and 
standard deviations.
To account for differences in patient characteristics that may 
affect the decision to prescribe apixaban rather than warfarin, 
we constructed matched cohorts for apixaban and warfarin. 
Matching was based on the prognostic score,20 the outcome-
based analog of the propensity score. For each patient, a score 
is computed that reflects outcome risk as a function of the 
adjustment covariates (and independent of treatment status). 
We used prognostic score matching given its straightforward 
implementation in regression modeling.21,22 For a given out-
come, the prognostic score was obtained from a regression 
model that included all available baseline variables (Table 1) 
and was fit to patients in the warfarin group (ie, control 
group cohort). Each patient on apixaban was then matched 
to 3 patients on warfarin using nearest neighborhood caliper 
matching with a caliper equal to 0.1 of the standard devia-
tion of the prognostic score. Survival free of an event in the 
matched apixaban and warfarin groups was represented with 
Kaplan‒Meier curves and compared with log-rank testing, 
treating death as a competing outcome. For each outcome, 
we calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs from univari-
able Cox regression analyses for the association between the 
prescribed anticoagulant and the time to event in the matched 
apixaban and warfarin cohorts. Anticoagulant group was the 
only predictor variable in these analyses. All outcome analyses 
were on treatment as patients were censored if they switched 
from apixaban to warfarin or another DOAC.
The main analysis was performed in prognostic score‒
matched cohorts. In a secondary analysis, the comparison 
between apixaban and warfarin for the outcomes of interest 
was also performed with multivariable Cox regression analysis 
in the overall (unmatched) apixaban and warfarin cohorts. All 
baseline variables listed in Table 1 were included as covari-
ates in that multivariable model. In addition, because some 
patients in the apixaban group may have been originally 
prescribed warfarin and then switched to apixaban, we per-
formed a sensitivity analysis that excluded these patients from 
the apixaban group.
Analyses were performed in R Statistical Software ver-
sion 3.4.1 (Foundation for Statistical Computing) and Stata 
version 14.1 (StataCorp). P<0.05 was considered statistically 
significant.
Subgroup and Dose-Specific Analyses
We performed prespecified subgroup analyses for the com-
parisons of apixaban versus warfarin defined by the following 
variables: age (≥75 or <75 years), sex, diabetes mellitus, his-
tory of cerebrovascular accident, history of major bleeding, 
obesity, dialysis modality, and possible interacting medica-
tions.23 In an exploratory and prespecified sensitivity analysis, 
we investigated the comparative associations of the standard 
(5 mg) apixaban dose and the reduced (2.5 mg) dose. Similarly 
to the main analysis, each dose-specific apixaban cohort was

matched separately to a warfarin cohort (apixaban:warfarin 
1:3) using a prognostic score for each outcome.
In the subgroup and dose-specific analyses, associa-
tion estimates were obtained from univariable Cox regres-
sion analyses, with anticoagulant drug exposure as the only 
predictor variable. The association estimates between each 
subgroup and between the apixaban 5 mg versus warfarin 
and apixaban 2.5 mg versus warfarin analyses for each out-
come were compared using interaction testing based on the 
Cochran’s Q heterogeneity statistic. Because of the multiple 
tested comparisons, a P value of <0.05 (rather than the more 
common P<0.10 for this test) was considered statistically sig-
nificant (ie, indicating that the associations of apixaban as 
compared with warfarin are different in the examined treat-
ment groups). Further, we also performed a direct comparison 
of the 2 doses restricted to the patients on apixaban by fitting 
a multivariable Cox regression model, including the apixaban 
dose as a predictor variable along with age, sex, prior cere-
brovascular accident, and prior major bleeding as covariates.

ORIGINAL RESEARCH 
ARTICLE
of the cohort selection process is shown in Figure I in 
the online-only Data Supplement. In 2013, shortly af-
ter the approval of apixaban for patients with AF in 
the United States, there was a significant increase in 
the number of new DOAC prescriptions per year, pre-
dominantly apixaban, with a corresponding decline in 
warfarin use (Figure 1). As a result, 26.6% of new an-
ticoagulation prescriptions in 2015 were for apixaban. 
Overall, 2939 patients (11.3% of anticoagulated pa-
tients) received a DOAC, with apixaban being the most 
commonly prescribed DOAC, followed by rivaroxaban 
and dabigatran. Further analysis and reporting of re-
sults in this study focuses on the 25 523 patients who 
were prescribed apixaban (n=2351, 9.2%) or warfarin 
(n=23 172, 90.8%).
The mean age of the study population was 
68.2±11.9 years, and 13 
852 (54.3%) patients were 
male (Table 1). A minority of patients underwent peri-
toneal dialysis (n=1377; 5.4%), whereas the rest were 
on hemodialysis. A total of 8461 (33.2%) patients had 
a prior cerebrovascular accident, and 2536 (9.9%) pa-
tients had prior major bleeding. The mean CHA2DS2-
VASc score was 5.2±1.8.
Outcomes
Table II in the online-only Data Supplement shows the 
baseline characteristics of the apixaban and warfarin 
cohorts after matching was performed based on prog-
nostic scores specific to each outcome, whereas the 
distributions of the prognostic scores before and after 
cohort matching are shown in Figure II in the online-
only Data Supplement. In addition, Tables III and IV in 
the online-only Data Supplement demonstrate that the 
baseline characteristics and event rates of the warfarin 
group in the study years 2010 to 2012 were not dif-
ferent from those in the period 2013 to 2015 (ie, the 
period coinciding with the start and uptake of apixaban 
prescriptions).
In the matched cohorts of apixaban (n=2351) and 
warfarin (n=7053), the rates of censoring because of 
expiration of the prescription or >30-day gap between 
prescriptions were high in both the apixaban and war-
farin groups (62.4% and 72.5%, respectively). The ma-
jority of these censorings occurred in the first 12 months 
after the prescription (60.9% and 66.4%, respectively), 
whereas another 5.6% and 8.9% of patients in the 
apixaban and warfarin groups, respectively, died in the 
first 12 months. The average time on apixaban was 105 
days, and the average time on warfarin was 157 days 
before death or censoring.
The event rates for stroke/SE were 12.4 and 11.8 
per 100 patient-years for the apixaban and warfarin 
groups, respectively, with no difference in survival 
free of stroke/SE between groups (log-rank P=0.29; 
Figure 2). In Cox regression analyses treating death as 
a competing risk, the HR (95% CI) for apixaban ver-
sus warfarin was 0.88 (0.69–1.12; P=0.29) for stroke/
SE (Table 2). The event rates for major bleeding were 
19.7 and 22.9 per 100 patient-years for the apixaban 
and warfarin groups, respectively (HR, 0.72 favoring 
apixaban; 95% CI, 0.59–0.87; P<0.001). In addition, 
there was a nonsignificant trend toward less GI bleed-
ing in the apixaban group (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.72–
1.02; P=0.09). No significant difference between 
the 2 groups was detected for intracranial bleeding 
(3.1 and 3.5 per 100 patient-years for apixaban and 
warfarin, respectively) with imprecise association es-
timate (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.49–1.26; P=0.32). Fi-
nally, apixaban was associated with a nonsignificant 
trend toward reduced mortality risk (HR, 0.85; 95% 
CI, 0.71–1.01; P=0.06). Similar results were produced 
when an analysis was performed with multivariable 
Cox regression modeling in the overall (unmatched)

Apixaban Dosing
In the apixaban group, 1034 (44%) patients were pre-
scribed the standard dose (5 mg twice a day), and 1317 
(56%) patients were prescribed the reduced dose (2.5 
mg twice a day). Characteristics of patients prescribed 
the standard and reduced apixaban doses are shown in 
Table VIII in the online-only Data Supplement.
The number of events and event rates for each out-
come in the matched cohorts of the dose-specific apix-
aban analyses are shown in Table IX in the online-only 
Data Supplement. In matched cohorts of apixaban 5 mg 
twice a day and warfarin, apixaban was associated with 
statistically significantly lower risks of incident stroke/SE 
(HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42–0.97; P=0.04), major bleed-
ing (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53–0.95; P=0.02), and death 
(HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46–0.85; P=0.003). In matched 
cohorts of apixaban 2.5 mg twice a day and warfa-
rin, apixaban was associated with a lower risk of ma-
jor bleeding (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56–0.91; P=0.007), 
but there were no differences for stroke/SE (HR, 1.11; 
95% CI, 0.82–1.50; P=0.49) or death (HR, 1.07; 95% 
CI, 0.87–1.33; P=0.52). Neither standard nor reduced 
apixaban doses were associated with significant differ-
ences for GI or intracranial bleeding as compared with 
warfarin (Figure 3). Differences of association estimates 
in the dose-specific analyses of apixaban versus warfa-
rin were statistically significant for stroke/SE and death, 
indicating greater benefit for these outcomes with the 
standard as compared with the reduced apixaban dose 
(P-for-interaction=0.035 for stroke/SE and 0.005 for 
death). There was no difference between the 2 doses 
for major bleeding (P-for-interaction=0.99), GI bleeding 
(P-for-interaction=0.32), or intracranial bleeding (P-for-
interaction=0.14).
In multivariable Cox regression analyses restricted 
to patients receiving apixaban and including dose as a 
predictor variable, the standard dose of apixaban was 
associated with lower risks of stroke/SE (HR, 0.61; 95% 
CI, 0.37–0.98; P=0.04) and death (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 
0.45–0.92; P=0.01) compared with the reduced dose. 
There were no differences for major bleeding, GI bleed-
ing, or intracranial bleeding between doses (Table X in 
the online-only Data Supplement).
DISCUSSION
In this observational study of >25 
000 patients with AF 
on dialysis from the nationwide USRDS, we found that 
DOACs were increasingly utilized despite a paucity of 
evidence on their safety and effectiveness in this popu-
lation. This increase was largely driven by a sharp rise 
in prescriptions for apixaban since its approval in late

2012. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time in 
an ESKD population that apixaban use (unlike other DO-
ACs) was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding 
compared with warfarin, although the absolute rates 
of bleeding were high in both groups. Apixaban 5 mg 
twice a day, but not the 2.5 mg twice a day dose, was 
also associated with lower risks of thromboembolism 
and death compared with warfarin, whereas there was 
no difference in the lowering of major bleeding risk 
between the 2 doses. Discontinuation rates were high, 
and about two-thirds of patients in each group were 
no longer taking the anticoagulant 12 months after the 
initial prescription.
For decades, warfarin has been the mainstay of 
thromboembolic stroke prevention in patients with 
AF on dialysis considered eligible for anticoagulation. 
However, patients on dialysis are at increased risk of 
treatment-related bleeding likely because of underly-
ing platelet dysfunction, and warfarin may not confer 
a thromboembolic risk reduction of the same magni-
tude as in patients without ESKD.4,5 The DOACs were 
shown to have a more favorable bleeding risk profile 
compared with warfarin in clinical trials and real-world 
analyses in patients without ESKD, so there is reason to 
anticipate that these benefits may extend to those with 
ESKD.8–10,24,25 However, they have varying degrees of re-
nal clearance, and there are no data from randomized 
trials regarding their outcomes in patients with ESKD. 
Nevertheless, a study utilizing the Fresenius Medical 
Care North America ESKD database reported that some 
patients on dialysis received off-label dabigatran or ri-
varoxaban shortly after their marketing approval in the 
United States, and their use in this population was as-
sociated with poor outcomes.15
In contrast to dabigatran and rivaroxaban, apixaban 
is less dependent on renal elimination (≈27%) and is 
labeled for use in ESKD. In the seminal ARISTOTLE trial 
(Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thrombo-
embolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation), apixaban was as-
sociated with lower risks of stroke, bleeding, and death 
compared with warfarin. However, patients with ESKD 
were excluded from ARISTOTLE.10 The only evidence to 
guide the use of apixaban in ESKD stems from a phar-
macokinetic study where 8 patients on hemodialysis 
and 8 normal subjects were administered apixaban 5 
mg resulting in comparable maximum blood concentra-
tions and antifactor Xa activity. This study was too small 
to assess safety or effectiveness outcomes.26 Based on 
pharmacokinetic data alone, the US Food and Drug Ad-
ministration approved an updated dosing recommen-
dation for apixaban 5 mg twice daily in patients with 
ESKD on hemodialysis. The 2014 American College of 
Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm 
Society AF guidelines do not make a recommendation 
for or against apixaban in patients with ESKD,12 whereas 
the respective European guidelines recommend against 
DOACs in this setting.13,14 Despite the paucity of data 
and guideline recommendations, we observed a steep 
rise in apixaban prescriptions shortly after its approval, 
such that it accounted for ≈25% of new anticoagula-
tion prescriptions for patients with ESKD in 2015.
This study is the first investigation of the potential 
safety and effectiveness of apixaban in patients with 
ESKD on dialysis. In our main analysis comprising any 
apixaban dose, apixaban users had an ≈30% reduced 
risk of major bleeding compared with a matched cohort 
of warfarin-treated patients. The benefit associated 
with apixaban use in reducing major bleeding events 
is consistent with the findings of the ARISTOTLE trial 
of  patients with AF without ESKD, in terms of both 
the direction and magnitude of effect (HR, 0.69; 95% 
CI, 0.60–0.80, for apixaban versus warfarin in ARISTO-
TLE).10 Further, a secondary analysis of ARISTOTLE dem-
onstrated that, although bleeding rates were higher

among patients with kidney dysfunction, the relative 
risk reduction of major bleeding with apixaban versus 
warfarin was greater among the patients in the lowest 
estimated glomerular filtration rate category (≤50 mL/
min, non-ESKD).27 Thus, the comparative safety of apix-
aban may be more pronounced in patients with more 
advanced kidney dysfunction. Apixaban appears to be 
safer across the spectrum of kidney function categories, 
possibly owing to its predominantly nonrenal elimina-
tion. The results of the current analysis are in contradis-
tinction to the bleeding-related morbidity and mortality 
attributed to dabigatran and rivaroxaban in a previous 
analysis of patients on hemodialysis,15 suggesting that 
the increased bleeding risk in ESKD is not a drug class 
effect for all DOACs.
In secondary dose-specific analyses, the standard 
apixaban 5 mg dose was associated with a significant 
risk reduction of thromboembolism as compared with 
warfarin. In contrast, the reduced apixaban 2.5 mg 
dose was not associated with a lower risk of thrombo-
embolism as compared with warfarin. The finding of 
lower thromboembolic risk with the standard apixaban 
dose has been a consistent finding in the ARISTOTLE 
trial10 and real-world practice settings.25 In accordance 
with pharmacokinetic data, these findings suggest that 
ESKD alone is not a sufficient indication for dose re-
duction of apixaban.26 It is interesting to note that the 
standard apixaban dose was associated with a lower 
mortality risk compared with warfarin. Lower mortality 
with the standard apixaban dose compared with war-
farin has been reported in ARISTOTLE (where 95.3% of 
patients received the standard dose) and in an observa-
tional study,28 whereas another observational study did 
not show mortality difference with that dose.29 In con-
trast, reduced-dose apixaban has been associated with 
higher mortality compared with warfarin.30 It is possible 
that the survival benefit with standard-dose apixaban 
over warfarin in our study reflects the lower thrombo-
embolic and bleeding risks with that dose. However, 
because of the observational nature of this analysis, 
residual confounding from selective prescribing of the 
reduced dose in patients with higher perceived bleed-
ing risk cannot be ruled out, and the absence of an 
observed difference in the bleeding rates between the 
low-dose and standard-dose apixaban groups may be 
suggestive of such selective prescribing. The indications 
for dose reduction of apixaban in patients undergoing 
dialysis require further research.
Despite the favorable outcomes with apixaban as 
compared with warfarin, there is uncertainty regarding 
the net benefit of anticoagulation for stroke prevention 
in patients with AF on dialysis. Older observational data 
suggested that warfarin may be ineffective in reduc-
ing strokes in patients on hemodialysis and may even 
increase mortality,31 although recent studies have ques-
tioned this observation.32 Our analysis did not include 
a group of patients not receiving any anticoagulants, 
and it was not designed to address the question of an-
ticoagulation versus no anticoagulation. Such a retro-
spective comparison of ontreatment versus untreated 
groups carries significant risks of confounding that sta-
tistical adjustments or cohort matching may not elimi-
nate completely. However, it should also be noted that 
bleeding rates were high even in the apixaban group. In 
particular, the intracranial bleeding rate of 3.1 per 100 
patient-years is strikingly high in comparison with the 
rate of 0.33 per 100 patient-years in ARISTOTLE. Fur-
ther, censoring because of expiration of anticoagula-
tion prescription or >30-day gap between prescriptions 
was frequent even in the apixaban group, resulting in 
overall short periods of treatment. It is important to 
note that the short follow-up periods until censoring or 
death in our cohort are consistent with the only other 
study examining the use of DOACs (dabigatran and 
rivaroxaban) in patients on dialysis where the average 
times on dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and warfarin were 
168 days, 106 days, and 175 days, respectively.15 This 
finding may reflect the poor tolerability of any type of 
anticoagulation in this population, which can also man-
ifest as nuisance bleeding rather than major bleeding. 
Minor bleeding was not captured in this analysis, but it 
was recently reported to be as high as 20% in a gen-
eral anticoagulated population.33 Minor bleeding may 
be even more common and problematic in patients on 
dialysis who require vascular access for dialysis several 
times weekly. Poor adherence may have also led to high 
rates of censoring because of >30-day gaps in prescrip-
tions. The real-world adherence to anticoagulants is 
generally poor even with DOACs.34,35 These issues 
further highlight the complexities of decision making 
and net benefit assessment regarding anticoagulation 
in patients with AF on dialysis. Future clinical trials are 
therefore needed to assess whether focusing on stroke 
reduction using apixaban or warfarin is worth the el-
evated risks of bleeding in this specific setting.
Other limitations of this analysis merit consideration. 
First, we did not have information on body weight at 
the time of apixaban prescription to determine the 
extent of inappropriate dose reduction of apixaban, 
which may have contributed to the lack of thrombo-
embolic reduction benefit compared with warfarin in 
that subgroup.19 Second, because of the claims-based 
nature of our data, we could not determine the rates 
of adherence in the apixaban group or the time in 
therapeutic range in the warfarin group. In addition, 
we could not determine which nonoral anticoagulants 
were administered during dialysis or whether apixaban 
was routinely discontinued temporarily before a dialy-
sis session. Finally, this analysis included only a small 
number of patients on peritoneal dialysis. Outcomes of 
warfarin therapy may be superior in peritoneal dialysis 
compared with hemodialysis.36

In conclusion, apixaban is increasingly utilized among 
patients with ESKD on dialysis and AF in the United 
States and now accounts for more than a quarter of 
new anticoagulant prescriptions in this population. 
Apixaban may be associated with superior safety and 
effectiveness outcomes in this population as compared 
with warfarin. Although both standard- and reduced-
dose apixaban  were associated with lower major 
bleeding risks compared with warfarin, only the stan-
dard 5 mg dose was associated with reduced throm-
boembolic events and mortality. These findings require 
further investigation and confirmation in randomized 
controlled trials.
