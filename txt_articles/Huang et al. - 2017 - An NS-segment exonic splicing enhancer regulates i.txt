Influenza virus utilizes host splicing machinery to process viral mRNAs expressed from both
M and NS segments. Through genetic analysis and functional characterization, we here show
that the NS segment of H7N9 virus contains a unique G540A substitution, located within
a previously undefined exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) motif present in the NEP mRNA of
influenza A viruses. G540A supports virus replication in mammalian cells while retaining
replication ability in avian cells. Host splicing regulator, SF2, interacts with this ESE to regulate
splicing of NEP/NS1 mRNA and G540A substitution affects SF2–ESE interaction. The
NS1 protein directly interacts with SF2 in the nucleus and modulates splicing of NS mRNAs
during virus replication. We demonstrate that splicing of NEP/NS1 mRNA is regulated through
a cis NEP-ESE motif and suggest a unique NEP-ESE may contribute to provide H7N9 virus with
the ability to both circulate efficiently in avian hosts and replicate in mammalian cells.

 I
nfluenza virus utilizes viral polymerase for transcription and
replication of the viral genome in the nucleus of infected cells,
but remains dependent on host splicing machinery for splicing
of viral messenger RNAs1–4. A recent study using various
genome-wide screening approaches confirms the critical role of
host splicing machinery in influenza virus replication5. Among
the eight negative sense RNA segments of the influenza virus
genome,
both
M
and
NS
express
unspliced
and
spliced
transcripts, which differ in their viral functions. Expression of
spliced M and NS mRNAs is highly regulated4. It is of interest
how regulation of transcript splicing may affect virus replication
efficiency and host adaptation.
The NS segment of influenza virus expresses two viral proteins,
non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and nuclear export protein
(NEP,
also known
as NS2),
from
unspliced
and
spliced
NS mRNAs, respectively6–8. NS1 is one of the earliest proteins
expressed in virus infection and has important functions in
inhibition of host antiviral gene expression and in virus
replication9–14. NEP, which is essential for virus replication, is
expressed from the spliced form of NS mRNA at a later point
during virus infection6,8,15. However, it is largely unknown how
NS1/NEP expression is regulated during virus replication.
Splicing of mRNA is considered to be one of the most complex
processes in cells and is performed by the spliceosome complex
and splicing regulators16. Through interaction with various
cis elements such as intronic splicing enhancer, exonic splicing
enhancer (ESE), exonic splicing silencer or intronic splicing
silencer, splicing regulators direct the splicing of pre-mRNAs.
Although the splicing sites in influenza virus M and NS mRNAs
are well known, the cis elements that are recognized by splicing
regulators in NS mRNAs are less clearly defined. The splicing
regulator SF2/ASF is reported to recognize an ESE in the
30-splicing site region of M2 mRNA to regulate the M1/M2
splicing process1. During influenza virus infection, NS1 protein
functions to alter mRNA processing, to facilitate virus evasion of
host antiviral immunity13. Reports suggest that NS1 protein may
be involved in regulation of the spliced form of NS mRNA, NEP,
but other studies argue against
a role for NS1 in this
process10,17,18. The NS1 and NEP proteins play different roles
during virus infection and regulation of splicing of mRNA to
favour either NS1 or NEP could significantly affect virus
replication efficiency. Indeed, it is suggested that inefficient
splicing of NS mRNAs of the pandemic A/Brevig Mission/1918/1
(H1N1) virus resulted in higher levels of the NS1 protein,
contributing to its pathogenic properties19. NEP is required for
coordination of viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) nuclear export in
the later stage of infection and it is suggested that virus adapts to
utilize a poor 50-splice site to allow slow expression of NEP early
in virus infection20. These studies indicate that regulation of the
NS splicing process plays a key role in virus replication.
In the past two decades, sporadic human infections with
multiple different subtypes of avian influenza viruses have
occurred.
The
rapid
establishment
of
avian
H7N9
virus
endemicity in chickens, accompanied by continuous emergence
of H7N9 human cases since 2013 (ref. 21), suggests that this virus
possesses an unusual fitness for both circulation and human
infection.
There
is
strong
interest
in
understanding
the
mechanism underpinning the ability of this virus to cause
human infections and identification of residues that support
replication in mammalian cells is important for surveillance of
circulating strains. Previous studies revealed that the 2013 H7N9
virus is a reassortant generated with haemagglutinin and
neuraminidase genes from viruses present in wild birds, with
internal genes derived from avian H9N2 viruses circulating
in domestic poultry22. Host adaptation of H9N2 virus has
been extensively studied; H9N2 viruses are believed to serve as
a critical backbone for the emergence of novel subtype viruses in
poultry that can cause infection in humans22–24. Although most
studies have focused on how molecular markers associated with
receptor binding specificity and polymerase PB2 protein activity
enable H7N9 virus infection in humans25–28, little is known
about the general fitness of other internal genes of 2013 H7N9
and their contribution to virus replication.
The here performed analysis of the 2013 H7N9 virus genome
revealed a distinct E172K substitution in the NS1 protein,
corresponding to nucleotide G540A. Further analysis showed that
this substitution is inherited from H9N2 virus. Notably, the
NS G540A genotype emerged in early 2000, becoming the
dominant genotype among H9N2 viruses from 2012 onwards.
We identified the G540A substitution as being located in an
uncharacterized NEP ESE motif that is recognized and bound by
the splicing regulator SF2. Acquired NS G540A substitution
altered the ratio of NEP/NS1 mRNA in virus infections and
enhanced H7N9 virus replication in mammalian cells and mice.
It seems that splicing of NS mRNAs can be regulated by the
NEP ESE and that mutation within this ESE may alter virus
replication efficiency.
Results
The 2013 H7N9 virus contains a unique NS-G540A substitution.
To investigate adaptations in the H7N9 virus genome, we
compared available sequences and found a unique substitution,
G540A, in the NS segment of H7N9 virus (Fig. 1a). G540A caused
an E172K amino acid change in the NS1 protein, but not in NEP.
As H7N9 virus acquired internal genes from avian H9N2 virus,
we surveyed H9N2 NS sequences in the public database and
discovered that G540A, as well as an adjacent nucleotide muta-
tion, U539C, emerged in early 2000; since 2009–2011, U539C/
G540A became increasingly prevalent, being the predominant
variant from 2012 onwards (Supplementary Fig. 1). These sub-
stitutions are rare among other influenza virus subtypes. It is
natural to assume that the internal genes derived from this
dominant strain of H9N2 virus strain have provided the optimal
fitness required for continuous circulation of H7N9 in the field.
One recent report that analysed H9N2 evolution in China found a
distinct genotype, G57, which donated internal genes for the
formation of the H7N9 strain29. Consistent with this report,
phylogenetic analysis showed that all H9N2 G57 genotype viruses
have the NS G540A substitution and form a distinct group
(Supplementary Fig. 2a). To characterize the effect of NS G540A
(NS1 E172K) on virus replication, we first tested one pair of
H7N9 viruses constructed from the backbone of the 2013 H7N9
virus strain28. The mutant virus contained an NS A540G (K172E)
mutation, reversed from the prevailing NS genotype at this
position, with a view to disrupting any function specifically
associated with G540A. Growth kinetics analysis showed that
A540G mutation caused attenuation of H7N9 virus replication in
A549 human lung cancer cells, but not in DF-1 chicken
fibroblasts (Fig. 1b). As the H7N9 virus acquired internal
genes from H9N2, we similarly constructed two additional pairs
of wild type (WT) and A540G mutant viruses; one set with
a complete H9N2 virus genome (H9N2), the other with internal
genes from H7N9 virus and surface genes derived from H9N2
(rH9N2)30. Consistent with that observed with the H7N9
backbone,
introduction
of
the
A540G
substitution
caused
attenuation of both rH9N2 and H9N2 virus replication in A549
cells, but not in DF-1 cells (Fig. 1b). To further demonstrate the
general effect of gaining G540A substitution on virus replication
in mammalian cells, we tested growth kinetics using recombinant
virus containing either the NS segment from a H7N9 (540A),
H9N2 (540G) or mutated H9N2-NS (540A) virus with the rest of

were rescued by the reverse genetics (RG) technique. The three pairs of H7N9, rH9N2 and H9N2 viruses only differ by the nucleotide substitution in NS, as
indicated in a. The reassortant H9N2 and H9N2-NS-A540G (rH9N2) viruses contain haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface genes
from the A/HongKong/308/2014 (H9N2) strain, with the six internal genes being the same as those of the H7N9-WT and H7N9-NS-A540G viruses,
respectively. A549 cells or DF-1 cells were infected with these RG viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. Supernatants were harvested at the

 the segments from the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) backbone. The results
showed that naturally acquired (H7N9) or artificially introduced
(H9N2-E172K) G540A substitution in the NS segment signifi-
cantly enhances virus replication in A549 cells (Supplementary
Fig. 2b). As sequence surveillance found another substitution,
C539U, which emerged alongside G540A in H9N2 viruses since
2000 and is present in all H7N9 viruses (Supplementary Fig. 1a),
we also tested a mutant H7N9 virus containing a C539U back
mutation in the NS segment, both alone and in combination with
A540G, and found that back mutation at position 539 did not
affect virus replication in A549 cells (Supplementary Fig. 2c). The
following experiments are therefore focused on characterizing the
biological significance of the G540A mutation. The data suggest
that G540A substitution in the NS segment provides H7N9 and
H9N2 viruses with enhanced ability to replicate in mammalian
cells, without reducing fitness in avian cells.

 Identification of an ESE site in exon 2 of NEP mRNA. As the
G540A substitution caused an amino acid change, E172K, in
the NS1 protein but was a silent mutation in the NEP (Fig. 1a), we
examined whether this alteration may alter NS1 function.
The
NS1
protein
is
known
to
interact
with
the
viral
polymerase complex and regulate viral RNP polymerase activity
through interaction with host negative regulators31,32. We found
that co-expression of increasing amounts of NS1 containing
either 172E (540G) or 172K (540A) has no significantly
different
effect
on
RNP
polymerase
activity
(Fig.
2a).
The
NS1
protein
also
inhibits
expression
of
interferon
(IFN)-b. However, we found that 172E-NS1 and 172K-NS1
both inhibit IFN-b reporter activity induced by Sendai virus
infection similarly (Fig. 2b). We further tested IFN-b expression
in
virus-infected
cells
and
found
no
apparent
difference
between cells infected with rH9N2 virus containing either
172E-NS1 or 172K-NS1 (Fig. 2c). These results suggest that the
biological impact of G540A substitution in the NS segment
may not lie in the amino acid change at position 172 of the
NS1 protein.
As position 540 is located within exon 2 of NEP and close to
the splice acceptor site, we reasoned that this substitution may
affect NEP mRNA splicing. Using ESEfinder to screen the
sequence33, we identified a potential exonic enhancer site (ESE),
which spans nucleotides 535–541 of the NS segment. Notably,
WT H7N9 NS (540A) has a score of 2.64, whereas the A540G
mutant showed a much higher score of 5.22, indicating that the
mutant is more efficiently spliced (Fig. 1a). To verify that
the G540A substitution affects ESE function in NEP mRNA
splicing regulation, we compared NEP/NS1 mRNA ratios in
WT and A540G mutant virus-infected cells using primer sets to
specifically amplify NEP and NS1 mRNAs (Fig. 2d). As expected
from the higher ESE score, A540G increased the proportion of
the spliced form of NS mRNA, NEP mRNA, in infected cells,
starting from 6 h post infection (Fig. 2e). To exclude the effect of
other viral proteins on regulation of NS mRNA splicing,
transfection experiments with WT and mutated NS segments
were performed and the result showed that A540G back mutation
significantly increases the NEP/NS1 mRNA ratio in HEK293T
cells (Supplementary Fig. 3a). RNA stability testing showed
no differences between WT and A540G mutant mRNAs
(Supplementary Fig. 3b). Notably, the effect of A540G back
mutation on NEP/NS1 mRNA ratios is not apparent in avian
DF-1 cells infected with rH9N2 virus (Supplementary Fig. 3c).
Avian cells (DF1) express very low levels of SF2 compared with
mammalian cells (Supplementary Fig. 3d,e) and it is therefore
possible that avian cells are less sensitive to splicing changes
caused by A540G substitution in the NS RNA. To verify the
contention that the effect of G540A is due to the nucleotide
substitution, rather than the change of amino acid at position 172,
stop codons were introduced at different positions within the NS1
open reading frame to interrupt protein translation from the
plasmid. There are several in-frame methionine residues within
the NS1 open reading frame; NS-45-stop would only make
truncated NS1 with the first 26 amino acids from the amino
terminal, whereas NS-456-stop and NS-501-stop would abort
translation of NS1 before residue 172 (Fig. 2f). Using these
plasmids in a transfection experiment, we further examined NEP/
NS1 mRNA ratios. Consistent with the virus infection result,
comparison of splicing ratios for NS mRNAs transcribed from
transfected NS plasmids encoding WT or truncated NS1 proteins
showed that A540G substitution increased the splicing ratio of NS
mRNAs (Fig. 2g). To confirm that the NEP-ESE motif identified
here is functional in other settings, we conducted a mini-gene
assay in which the NEP-ESE motif was inserted into the SMN
mini gene to replace the original ESE motif in exon 7 (Fig. 2h)34.
The NEP-ESE motif was able to function, as indicated by exon 7
inclusion in SMN1 mini gene mRNA splicing, and furthermore
the A540G substitution also enhances the efficiency of exon-7
inclusion
(Fig.
2h).
Taken
together,
these
results
clearly
characterize a new ESE located in the 535–541 region of exon 2 of
NEP pre-mRNA and demonstrate that an A to G substitution at
position 540 significantly affects the ability of this ESE to splice
NEP mRNA.
G540A substitution modulates NEP expression. To further
investigate the effect of this newly identified ESE on regulation
of NEP mRNA expression, we examined levels of NS1 and
NEP protein during virus infection. Using a pair of rH9N2
viruses, which contain either 540A-NS (WT) or 540G-NS seg-
ments, expression of viral proteins was examined over the course
of infection. Although no significant difference in NP protein
level was observed between WT virus and the A540G mutant,
NEP and NS1 protein levels were significantly affected in the early
hours of A540G mutant virus infection, up until 12 h post
infection, with NS1 being downregulated and NEP upregulated
(Fig. 3a,b). Interestingly, M1 protein expression was also affected
by NS-A540G mutation, presumably due to the altered level
of NS1 as reported in other studies, including one in which
Figure 2 | A540G enhances NS splicing ratio. (a) HEK293T cells were transfected with RNP complexes (PB2, PB1, PA and NP) and vector, different
amounts of H7N9-NS1-WT or H7N9-NS1-A540G (K172E) mutant NS1 plasmids, together with firefly (pYH-Luci for RNP activity) and Renilla (control)
luciferase reporters, for 16 h. (b) HEK293T cells were transfected with vector, different amounts of H7N9-NS1-WT or H7N9-NS1-A540G (K172E) NS1,

after cultured overnight. (c) IFN-b mRNA induction in A549 cells mock infected or infected with rH9N2-WT or rH9N2-NS-A540G viruses (multiplicity

is dysfunctional. The SF2-ESE motif score (ESEfinder) is shown under the sequence. If the ESE is functional, exon 7 would be included during alternative
splicing (full length, FL). Otherwise, it would be excluded ( � 7), leading to a shorter spliced product. RNAs from HEK293T cells transfected with pSMN
plasmids containing the indicated ESE motifs were analysed. The ratio of FL to � 7 mRNA from the SMN gene was estimated by RT–qPCR. Error bars

significance of the comparison between WT and A540G groups.

 NS1 protein was found to promote M1 to M2 splicing in
nuclear speckles9,35. To further confirm the notion that the
NEP ESE modulates NEP and NS1 expression during virus
infection, we examined levels of viral mRNAs in A549 cells
infected with either WT or A540G-NS rH9N2 virus. Consistent
with the western blot result, quantitative reverse-transcription–
PCR (RT–qPCR) showed that in comparison with WT virus-
infected cells, unspliced NS mRNA (NS1) is decreased in A540G
mutant infections, whereas spliced NS mRNA (NEP) is increased
(Fig. 3c,d). Similarly, unspliced M1 mRNA levels are down-
regulated when NS1 expression is decreased in A540G mutant
virus infected cells (Fig. 3e). In contrast, mutation of this ESE did
not affect NP mRNA levels during the early hours of virus
infection (Fig. 3f). These results further demonstrate that the
NEP ESE is associated with splicing of NS mRNAs, and that
the G540A substitution in this ESE affects the ratio of NS1 to
NEP mRNAs, leading to more NEP protein being expressed in
the early hours of infection.
SF2 binds NEP exon 2 ESE site. A motif search using ESEfinder
indicates that the NEP ESE site is similar to the consensus
SF2/ASF-binding sites33. Reports indicate that human splicing
factor SF2/ASF specifically recognizes the pre-mRNA 50-splice
site36–38. To test whether the NEP ESE site is recognized by SF2,
we conducted an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
using RNA probes derived from different regions of NS mRNA
(Fig. 4a). We showed that full-length FLAG-tagged SF2 in nuclear
extract (NE) prepared from plasmid transfected HEK293T cells is
able to bind to a probe derived from nucleotides 529–548,
which cover the NEP-ESE site; the specificity of the shifted
complex is further verified by binding of anti-FLAG, but not
the IgG antibody control, to tagged SF2 (Fig. 4b). SF2 is an
RNA-binding protein composed of an N-terminal RNA recog-
nition motif and a carboxy-terminal RS domain, which is rich in
arginine/serine
repeats
and
interacts
with
other
splicing
regulators. To test the direct binding of SF2 to NS mRNA, we
constructed a FLAG-tagged-SF2 del-RS mutant, which only

del-RS, using both the acceptor site and NEP-ESE (529–548)

different levels of NEP mRNA splicing efficiency, we tested
whether SF2 has different binding affinity for the 540A and 540G
variants. EMSA showed that SF2 has higher affinity for the NEP

 A540G mutant than WT (540A) in both direct and competition
binding assays (Fig. 4d,e). These binding experiments clearly
demonstrated that the NEP-ESE site (nucleotides 529–548) is
recognized by the SF2 splicing regulator, and that A540G
substitution increases SF2 binding in in vitro assays. To exclude
the possible influence of other cellular proteins present in the
NEs prepared from SF2-transfected cells, we confirmed that anti-
body purified SF2 is able to bind to the NEP-ESE site, and that
A540G mutant appears to have higher affinity for SF2 (Fig. 4f).
To confirm whether this SF2-binding ESE is common among
other influenza viruses, a panel of representative strains of
different influenza A virus subtypes was screened, with all found
to contain an ESE in exon 2 of NEP that could be bound by
SF2 (Supplementary Fig. 4a).
We further tested whether SF2 can bind to NS mRNA in cells.
RNA (IP) and quantitative RT–PCR assays showed that,
compared with precipitation with control antibodies, NS mRNA,
but not control cellular RNA (U87), can be enriched more than
80-fold by precipitation of SF2 in HEK293T cells where
FLAG-tagged SF2 and the H7N9-NS segment are co-expressed
(Fig. 4g). We then used anti-SF2 antibody to precipitate
endogenous SF2/ASF and confirmed that NS mRNA, but not
control cellular or viral RNA (PB1), is efficiently co-precipitated
from H9N2 infected A549 cells (Fig. 4h). Direct interaction
between
SF2
and
NS
mRNA
was
further
confirmed
by
examining co-localization in the nucleus of A549 cells infected
with rH9N2 virus (Supplementary Fig. 4b). The EMSA and
RNA IP/RT–qPCR assays clearly demonstrate that the NEP-ESE
site is directly bound by the splicing regulator SF2, and that
A/G substitution at position 540 of the NS segment alters
SF2-binding affinity for this ESE site, leading to different splicing
efficiency.
NS1 protein interacts with SF2 in the nucleus. SF2 is involved
in the regulation of splicing of mRNAs transcribed from the
M segment1. NS1 inhibits host antiviral responses through
multiple mechanisms, including suppression of the host mRNA
splicing process, and previous studies, including our own, have
also shown that viral NS1 protein contributes to the regulation of
M2 mRNA splicing9,18. However, it is less clear how NS1/NEP
mRNA splicing is regulated. We wished to examine whether
the NS1 protein interacts with SF2, as a part of the splicing
process, during influenza virus infection. Using V5-tagged
NS1 derived from H7N9 virus and FLAG-tagged SF2 plasmids
in a co-expression assay, and rH9N2-infected A549 cells, we

 showed that SF2 and NS1 are co-precipitated from cell lysates
(Fig. 5a,b). Consistent with the above result showing that SF2 uses
the RNA recognition motif domain to bind to the NEP-ESE site, we
demonstrated that the interaction between NS1 and SF2 is
independent of the RS domain of SF2 (Fig. 5c). Further
characterization of the interaction between NS1 and SF2 found
that the RNA-binding domain (RBD) of the NS1 protein is required
for interaction with SF2, and that mutations at positions 38 and 41
abolish this interaction (Fig. 5d). Although positions 38 and 41 are
both important for NS1 RNA binding40, our result showed that
only R38A/K41A double mutations abolished interaction between
NS1 and SF2 (Supplementary Fig. 5a), suggesting double mutations
at positions 38 and 41 may alter the conformation of the NS1 RBD,
affecting interaction with SF2. It is noted that the F162S/V163R
mutant, which reduces SF2 RNA binding ability, did not affect SF2
interaction with NS1 (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). To further exclude
the possibility that RNA mediates the interaction between SF2 and
NS1, RNAs were removed by treatment with RNase A and SF2 was
still seen to interact with NS1 (Fig. 5e). In contrast, the RNA-
dependent interaction between the NS1 protein and RNA Helicase
A is abolished with RNase A treatment41. To verify that the intera-
ction between SF2 and the NS1 protein is direct, and does not
involve other cellular proteins, purified SF2 and NS1 proteins were
used to confirm SF2–NS1 direct interaction in a glutathione S-
transferase (GST) pull-down assay (Fig. 5f). Finally, bimole-

(Supplementary Fig. 5c,d). These results clearly demonstrate
a direct interaction between SF2 and the NS1 protein during
influenza virus replication.
NS1 modulates expression of NEP through interaction with SF2.
The NS1 protein regulates the host splicing process by interacting
with nuclear small RNA to prevent the formation of spliceosome
complexes and blocks nucleocytoplasmic transport of host
mRNAs to intervene with expression of genes required for
host antiviral functions17,42,43. NS1 was shown to modulate the
splicing of M2 mRNA in virus replication9,18,44. However, the
question of whether NS1 is also involved in regulating splicing
of NS mRNA into NEP remains unresolved. As the NEP exon
2 ESE motif is bound by SF2 and NS1 protein interacts with SF2,
we attempted to re-visit the question of whether NS1 is involved
in the process that produces spliced NEP mRNA during virus
replication. To this end, we constructed an NS-null replicon
system to estimate NS mRNA splicing without expressing either
NS1 or NEP protein. In this system, NS vRNA is first generated
by a polI-driven plasmid and then NS mRNA is transcribed
from vRNA by viral polymerase (Fig. 6a). The effect of NS1 is
examined by inclusion of plasmids expressing different versions
of NS1, driven by the regular pol II promoter. Using this NS-null
replicon system, we found that expression of the NS1 protein
reduces the NEP/NS1 ratio in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6b).
Further analysis revealed that while both the RBD and effector
domain decrease the NEP/NS1 mRNA ratio, full-length NS1 is
required for maximum inhibitory activity (Fig. 6c). A previous
study demonstrated that a 148A/152A/153A NS1 mutant facili-
tated export of NS1 to the cytoplasm and prevented its nuclear
accumulation (Supplementary Fig. 6)45. We found this mutant to
be significantly attenuated in its ability to inhibit NEP mRNA
splicing (Fig. 6d), suggesting the inhibitory action of NS1 occurs
in the nucleus. Consistent with the SF2 interaction result,
we found that the NS1 mutant, which is unable to interact with
SF2 (R38A/K41A), is also attenuated in its ability to inhibit
NEP mRNA splicing even though it is localized in the nucleus
(Fig. 6e and Supplementary Fig. 6), implying that the role of
NS1 in regulation of NEP splicing is mediated by SF2. It is
possible that SF2 mediates NS1 inhibition of the NEP mRNA
splicing process. To test this possibility, we knocked down SF2 in
HEK293T cells and tested the effect of NS1 on the NEP/NS1
mRNA ratio. Using a NS-null replicon system, we found that
restoring NS1 expression has a less inhibitory effect on splicing of
NEP mRNA in cells where SF2 is efficiently knocked down,
as seen by a significantly increased ratio of NEP/NS1 mRNA
(Supplementary Fig. 6b). Taken together, these results suggest
that expression of NS1 has an inhibitory effect on splicing
of NEP mRNA and that this process, at least partly, involves
interaction with SF2 in the nucleus.
G540A substitution enhances virus virulence in mice. An
A540G mutation within the identified NEP-ESE site affects H7N9
virus replication in mammalian cells, but not in those of avian
origin (Fig. 1b). To characterize the effect of WT and A540G
mutant viruses in vivo, we compared the pathogenic properties of
H7N9 viruses containing either 540 A-NS (WT) or 540G-NS
(mutant) in a mouse model. BALB/c mice were infected with
different doses of H7N9 virus and observed for mortality and
morbidity. Although all infected mice survived the low inoculum
dose (4.75 � 103 plaque-forming units) of either strain of H7N9
virus (Fig. 7b), substitution of A540G significantly attenuated
virus pathogenicity, as shown by the body weight curve (Fig. 7a).
At higher infectious doses (4.75 � 104 and 4.75 � 105 plaque-
forming units), both strains caused severe body weight loss in
mice, but the A540G-NS mutant was still less pathogenic than
the WT virus. Estimation of MLD50 clearly demonstrated that
WT virus is three times more pathogenic in mice. However, there
was no significant difference between the WT and A540G groups
when virus titres in lung tissues collected 3 days after infection
were measured, implying that 540A may associate with virulence
properties
other
than
virus
replication
ability
in
vivo
(Supplementary Fig. 7). We then analysed mRNA levels of
cytokines in the lungs of these mice, but found no significant
difference between WT and A540G virus-infected mice. As cell
culture experiments showed that A540G substitution has a more
significant effect on virus protein expression during the early
stage of virus infection (Fig. 3a), it is possible that day 3 post
infection may be too late to detect any differences in virus
replication in vivo. These results confirm that position 540 within
the NEP ESE in the NS segment is associated with virus patho-
genicity in mammalian cells in vivo, but the mechanism under-
lying the enhanced virulence of genotype A540-NS H7N9 virus
needs to be further investigated.
Discussion
Cross-species transmission of influenza virus is normally blocked
by host restriction factors, which limit virus infection and
replication in new hosts. Although influenza virus transcribes and
replicates the viral genome using the viral polymerase complex, it
relies on host splicing machinery for processing of viral mRNAs.
In addition to adaptive mutations of viral functions such as the
polymerase complex, regulation of M and NS expression through
modulation of mRNA splicing is implicated in influenza virus
replication efficiency19,20,46. This study identified an ESE located
in exon 2 of NEP in the NS segment of the H7N9 virus, and
found it to be common and relatively conserved among other
influenza A virus subtypes. Notably, a unique G540A substitution
within this ESE was found in H7N9 and also in the H9N2
virus, which provided internal genes to the H7N9 virus. G540A

 enhances virus replication in mammalian cells, while retaining
replication ability in avian cells. Furthermore, the NEP-ESE
interacts with splicing regulator SF2 and viral NS1 protein
interacts with SF2 to modulate NEP/NS1 mRNA splicing in the
nucleus during virus infection. It seems likely to be that an
adaptive mutation creating an optimal NEP-ESE may contribute
to the ability of the H7N9 virus to replicate in humans, while
retaining fitness for circulation in poultry.
The M2 and NEP proteins are expressed from the M and
NS segments, respectively, through a splicing process after
transcription. The splicing of influenza virus mRNAs relies on
host machinery and is highly regulated. Regulation of M2 mRNA
is mediated by binding of the splicing regulator, SF2, to the
splicing enhancer located in exon 2 of M2 mRNA1. It has
been suggested that the viral polymerase complex is involved
in regulation of M2 mRNA splicing regulation through intera-
ction with the splice site in exon 2 and other studies have also
argued that viral polymerases have a role in this process44,47,48.
Evidence from our own and other studies have suggested
a mechanism involving NS1 in the regulation of splicing of

Figure 6 | Effect of NS1 on NS mRNA splicing. (a) Schematic illustration of NS-null replicon system and detection of specific NS mRNAs. (Left panel)
Construction of the pHI NS-null plasmid, which contains multiple stop codons (red squares). NS vRNA mimics were generated from pHI NS-null plasmid by
pol-I and incorporated into RNP complexes. NS vRNA mimics were further transcribed into NS-null spliced and unspliced mRNAs by the viral polymerase
complex and host machinery. Owing to the presence of stop codons, neither unspliced or spliced NS-null mRNAs could be translated into complete NS1 or
NEP proteins, respectively. (Right panel) Specific primers (arrowheads) for detection of NS-null mRNA and its spliced form, but not mRNA expressed from
the pCX-NS1 plasmid, in RT–qPCR assay. The primer sets only detect NS-null mRNA and not NS1 mRNA expressed from the pCX-NS1 plasmid, as the
reverse primer (red) is base pair matched to the introduced stop codons and not WT sequences. Meanwhile, the antisense primer for spliced NS-null
mRNA anneals to the coding region of NEP that is not present in NS1 mRNA. Validation of NS1 or NEP protein expression when pHI-H7N9-NS or
pHI-H7N9-NS-null are co-transfected together with the RNP polymerase complex, is shown by IB using antibodies against NS1, NEP or a-tubulin
(insert, left panel). (b) HEK293T cells were transfected with pHI-NS-null and RNP, together with increasing amounts of V5-NS1 (0.5, 5 and 50 ng).
(c–e) HEK293T cells were transfected with pHI-NS-null and RNP, together with either vector (control) or WT, RBD or effector domain (ED) versions of
V5-NS1 (c), WTor 148/152/153A mutant of V5-NS1 (d), or WTor R38A/K41AV5-NS1 (e). Total RNA from transfected cells in b,c,d and e was isolated and
the splicing ratio of NS-null mRNA was measured by RT–qPCR. Levels of the various versions of NS1 and tubulin (control) were analysed by IB with
antibodies against V5 and tubulin, respectively. Error bars represent mean±s.d. (n ¼ 3). Statistical significance was analysed by Student’s t-test: *Po0.05,
**Po0.01 and ****Po0.0001.

 M mRNAs, as the M2/M1 mRNA ratio is altered in viruses
lacking the NS1 protein9,44,49. However, it is less clear how
expression of the spliced form of NS mRNA is regulated to
influence NEP expression. Besides its defined role in mediating
nuclear export of the viral RNP complex, a role for NEP in
regulating the switch from transcription to replication during
virus replication is being investigated50–52. It is suggested that
NEP is regulated to remain at low levels to avoid negative effects
on viral transcription during the early phase of infection20.
Studies on PB2 host adaption also found that a mammalian
PB2 adapts better than avian PB2 for promoting RNP polymerase
activity in the presence of NEP in mammalian cells28,51. It
seems that the level and timing of NEP expression significantly
affects virus replication efficiency. However, questions about
NS1 protein involvement in the regulation of its own mRNA
splicing process remain unanswered due to contradictory reports
from
studies
using
different
experimental
systems10,17,18.
The results presented here appear to support the hypothesis
that NS1 is involved in regulating splicing of NEP mRNA
through interaction with SF2. NS1 is one of the earliest proteins
expressed during virus replication and may be the key regulator
in determining virus replication efficiency, through modulation
of the NS and M splicing processes. As expression of NEP and
NS1 is mutually exclusive, relative levels of NEP/NS1 could affect
virus replication efficiency and virulence properties. Higher levels
of NS1 in the nucleus in the early stages of virus infection may
further modulate viral protein expression and inhibit host
antiviral
gene
expression,
thereby
promoting
replication.
Coordinated timing of the expression of these viral functions
may synergistically support higher viral replication efficiency
(Fig. 8). However, a mechanism detailing how an optimized
balance of NEP/NS1 is achieved and adjusted over the course of
influenza virus infection, to ensure high efficiency of virus
replication remains to be elucidated. It is possible that more
than one mechanism may be involved in regulation of splicing
of NS mRNAs, as another study reported that influenza
virus polymerases are able to recruit the host protein complex,
RED-SMU1, to regulate splicing of NS mRNAs2.

 unusual53,54. This study provides a possible mechanism to explain
the molecular properties, which allow H7N9 virus to infect
humans while retaining the ability to circulate in avian species.
Current NS-540A genotype H9N2 and H7N9 viruses replicate
better in mammalian cells than mutant versions with a back
mutation to A540G, but retain their ability to replicate in avian
cells. The primed condition of NS-540A for enhanced replication
ability in mammalian hosts may facilitate viral acquisition of
other adaptive mutations, such as PB2 627K, during virus
infection. It is possible that mutations in other gene segments
may also have contributed to the emergence and predominance
of the NS-G540A H9N2 virus, which provided the internal
genes for the H7N9 virus55, and it is suggested that antigenic
variations may also have facilitated the emergence of an H9N2
variant in China29. It is notable that human infections with
H10N8 confirmed in China were caused only by H10N8 viruses,
which contain NS-G540A; no human cases involving H10N8
virus without this mutation were found24,56. Human infections
with H5N6 virus occurred in China since 2014, with 11/16 (69%)
of isolates characterized from human cases contain NS-G540A57.
The mechanism underlying how this mutation in the here
characterized NEP-ESE supports virus replication in mammalian
cells should be further evaluated and future surveillance should
also monitor for adaptive substitutions, which affect splicing of
viral mRNAs.
Methods
Viruses and reverse genetics. All the influenza A viruses used in this study were
rescued by reverse genetics technique58. For H7N9-WT virus, all eight segments
were derived from the strain A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013. For reassortant
rH9N2-WT or rH9N2-NS-A540G viruses, HA and NA surface genes were
derived from A/HongKong/308/2014 (H9N2), whereas internal genes were
identical to H7N9-WT or H7N9-NS-A540G. A pair of H9N2 viruses containing
WT or NS-A540G were made with the genome from the strain A/HongKong/308/
2014. Viral genotypes were confirmed by sequencing viral genomes.
Plasmid construction. Expression plasmids pCX-V5-H7N9-NS1 and pcDNA-
FLAG-SF2 were constructed by ligation independent cloning using exonuclease
III as previously described28. SMN mini gene was amplified as described34, cloned

Figure 8 | Working model for the regulation of NS mRNA splicing. NEP mRNA is a spliced form of NS1 mRNA. The ESE, a cis-acting element located in
the second exon, positively regulates the alternative splicing of NS1 mRNA. SF2/ASF binds to the newly identified ESE site and facilitates the splicing
process. NS1 protein shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and suppresses the splicing of NS1 mRNA through binding to SF2. NS1 has multiple
functions for suppression of host antiviral activities in the nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas NEP is involved in vRNP export to the cytoplasm for virion
assembly and packaging, and may also be involved in directing the switch from viral genome transcription to replication. As the production of NEP and
NS1 mRNA is mutually exclusive, regulation of splicing of NS mRNA has an impact on viral replication efficiency.

 into pcDNA3.1 vector and designated pSMN. The vector pHI was derived from
pHW2000 plasmid by deleting the pol-II promoter and used for cloning NS-null
plasmids. To generate mutant plasmids, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out
with PfuTurbo DNA polymerase.
Growth kinetics of viruses in cells. Confluent human A549 (American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC), CCL-185) or chicken DF-1 (ATCC, CRL-12203) cells
were infected with indicated viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01. The viral
inoculums were discarded after 1 h of virus adsorption. Cells were then washed
with PBS and cultured in minimal essential media containing 1 mg ml � 1 of
TPCK-treated trypsin. Culture supernatants were harvested at indicated time
points and viral titers were measured by plaque assay.
Transient transfection and SMN mini genes assay. HEK293T (ATCC,
CRL-3216) cells were used for transfection assay using TransLT-1 reagent
(Mirus Bio) according to the user manual. Mini-gene expression plasmid pSMN-1,
dysfunctional mutant pSMN-2, pSMN-H7N9-WT containing the putative ESE of
H7N9 or pSMN-H7N9-A540G was transiently transfected into HEK293T cells
for 24 h. Total cellular RNAs were extracted and reversely transcribed into
complementary DNA. PCR using Hot Start Taq (Takara) was performed to amplify
cDNA. PCR products were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis.
Dual luciferase reporter assay. To measure the RNP activity, HEK293T cells
were co-transfected with RNP expression plasmids composed of PB2, PB1, PA and
NP, together with increasing doses of NS1 expression plasmids, pYH-Luci reporter,
a kind gift from Professor Robert Webster St Jude Children Research Hospital),
and Renilla reporter (Promega) and activity estimated 20 h post transfection. To
determine the suppression of IFN-b, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with
increasing doses of NS1 expression plasmids, IFN-b reporter and Renilla reporter.
At 8 h post transfection, cells were infected or mock infected with Sendai virus,
a kind gift from Professor Dong-Yan Jin (the University of Hong Kong), overnight
before being lysed. Luciferase and Renilla luciferase activity were measured
according to the manufacturer’s manual. The activity of luciferase was normalized
to that of Renilla.
Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR. Total cellular RNAs were isolated
using RNAiso reagent (Takara). Elimination of DNA and reverse transcription
(RT) of RNA were performed using a PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit with genomic
DNA Eraser (Takara), in accordance with the manufacturer’s manual. Oligo-dT
primer was used in RT reaction for detection of mRNAs, whereas uni-12-specific
primer was used for vRNAs. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) mixtures were prepared
according to the user manual of SYBR Premix Ex Taq reagent (Takara) and
reactions were run in a LightCycler 480 instrument II (Roche). For relative
quantification, the DCt (threshold cycle) method was used to analyse splicing ratios
and the DDCt method was adopted for gene expression analysis, where a-tubulin
or Rpl32 mRNA expression levels were used for normalization. Primers for qPCR
are listed in Supplementary Table 1.
Pathogenicity study in mice. Six- to 8-week-old female BALB/c mice were
intranasally inoculated with the indicated doses of H7N9-WT or H7N9-NS-A540G
diluted in PBS. Weight and survival were recorded daily for 2 weeks. Mice that lost
Z20% of initial weight were killed. The protocols for animal experiments were
approved by the CULATR (3653-15). MLD50 was calculated by the method
described by Reed and Muench59.
Immunoprecipitation and western blotting. For RNA IP, HEK293T cells were
co-transfected with pcDNA-FLAG-SF2 and pHW2000-H7N9-NS for 48 h, whereas
A549 cells were infected with rH9N2-WT at an multiplicity of infection of 5 for
16 h. Cell lysates were incubated with antibodies (1 mg per reaction in 200 ml of lysis
buffer) against FLAG tag (Sigma, F1804), endogenous SF2/ASF (Santa Cruz,
sc-33652) or control IgG antibodies ( Santa Cruz, sc-2025) at 4 �C overnight and
precipitated with Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at room temperature for
15 min. After five washes with Tris lysis buffer, RNAs were isolated and analysed by
RT–qPCR. For co-IP, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with pcDNA-FLAG-SF2
(or truncated/mutated forms) and pCX-V5-H7N9-NS1 (or truncated/mutated
forms), or V5 vector for 48 h, whereas A549 cells were infected as described above.
Cell lysates were incubated with antibody–bead complexes at room temperature for
30 min. Protein–antibody–bead complexes were washed five times with Tris lysis
buffer, boiled at 95 �C for 10 min and analysed by western blotting. For co-IP with
RNase treatment, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with pCX-V5-H7N9-NS1 and
pcDNA-FLAG-SF2 or HA-RHA for 48 h. Cell lysates were incubated with
antibody–bead complexes and washed three times, as described above.
Protein–antibody–bead complexes were then treated or mock-treated with
RNase A (ThermoFisher Scientific, 12091039, 1:1,000) at 37 �C for 50 min.
Complexes were washed three more times, boiled at 95 �C for 10 min and analysed
by western blotting. Endogenous SF2 protein was detected using rabbit polyclonal
antibody (Abcam ab38017, 1:1,000). Uncropped western blottings are provided in
Supplementary Fig. 8.
GST pull-down assay. BL21 (DE) competent cells harboring pGEX6P-SF2,
pGEX6P-1 or pET32a-dualHis-H7N9-NS1 were amplified and induced by treat-
ment with 0.1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactoside for 4 h at 30 �C. GST-tagged-SF2
and His-tagged NS1 proteins were purified with Glutathione Sepharose beads
(Promega) and Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen), respectively. The purity of recombinant
proteins was determined by SDS–PAGE. Five micrograms of recombinant
NS1 protein was mixed with GST–SF2–bead or GST–bead (control) complexes
at 4 �C overnight. Protein–bead complexes were washed four times with Tris lysis
buffer and analysed by western blotting.
RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay. HEK293T cells were transfected with
pcDNA-FLAG-SF2 or pcDNA-FLAG-SF2DRS. Cells were harvested after 24 h,
washed by PBS and lysed with sucrose buffer containing NP-40. Nuclear fraction
was spun down and washed by sucrose buffer without NP40. Nucleus pellets
were resuspended in low-salt buffer, incubated with equal volume of high salt
buffer for 30 min on ice and NEs were prepared by spun at 14,000 g for 15 min
(detail protocol can be found in http://www.celldeath.de/apometh/emsa.html). To
set up the binding reaction, 10 nM of RNA probes (Integrated DNA Technologies)
labelled with IRDye-800 (Li-Cor Bioscience) were incubated with increasing doses
of NE in 20 ml of buffered mixture (30 mM Tris-HCl, 24 mM KCl, 800 mM MgCl2,
0.008% NP40, 3.3 mM dithiothreitol, 0.25% Tween 20, 4% glycerol, 2 mg yeast
transfer RNA, pH 8.0). For the competition assay, increasing doses of competitors
were added into the mixture. For super-shift assay, 0.5 mg of antibody against
FLAG tag (Sigma, F1804)) was included. After incubation for 30 min at room
temperature in the dark, mixtures were separated by 5% non-denaturing gel
(0.5 � TBE). To purify SF2 protein, FLAG-tagged-SF2 was overexpressed in
HEK293T cells and immunoprecipitated using antibody-bead complexes specific
for the FLAG tag in high-salt RIPA buffer, then eluted with 3 � Flag peptide.
Gels were directly scanned by the Odyssey imaging system (Li-Cor Bioscience).
RNA oligonucleotides used in RNA EMSA are listed in Supplementary
Experimental Procedures.
Fluorescence assays. For Immunofluorescence (IF), HEK293T cells were fixed
at 24 h post transfection, whereas A594 cells were fixed at 6 h post infection
using fixation buffer (11% formalin in PBS) at room temperature for 10 min.
Permeabilized slides were incubated with primary antibodies (SF2: (Santa Cruz,
sc-33652, dilution 1:25; NS1 a kind gift provided by Dr Yee-Joo Tan of National
University of Singapore, dilution 1:200) against proteins of interest diluted in
blocking buffer at 37 �C for 1 h. After three washes in buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in
PBS), Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Abcam) diluted in wash buffer
were added evenly onto slides. For sequential immunofluorescence (IF) plus
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay, after staining with secondary
antibodies, slides were washed in PBS and incubated in FISH wash buffer
(10% Formamide, 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium citrate pH 7.0) for 5 min at room
temperature. RNA probes (Biosearch Technologies) for NS1 mRNA detection
dissolved in hybridization buffer (10% Dextran sulphate, 10% formamide, 300 mM
NaCl, 30 mM sodium citrate pH 7.0) were distributed on slides and incubated
at 37 �C for 5 h. Slides for IF or FISH were mounted using mounting buffer
with DAPI (VECTASHIELD). IF images were captured by LSM 700 confocal
microscope ( � 63 oil-immersion lens) and those of FISH were acquired by wide
field microscope ( � 60 oil-immersion lens). NS1-NG/SF2-CG and NG/CG
plasmids for the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) imaging
assay were constructed as previously reported60. Green fluorescent protein
signals emitted by BiFC were observed using a LSM 780 confocal microscope
( � 40 oil-immersion lens).
RNA interference knockdown. Oligos (SiRNA-1, -2, -3: HSS109654, HSS109655,
HSS109656 and scrambled negative control: 12935300) were purchased from
ThermoFisher Scientific. HEK293T cells were reverse transfected with each SiRNA
using RNAiMAX (ThermoFisher Scientific) in accordance with the user manual for
24 h before use in subsequent experiments.
Statistical analysis. Student’s t-test and two-way analysis of variance with the
Bonferroni post test were performed using Graphpad Prism 7 software.
Biosafety measures. Experiments using H7N9 viruses or derivatives were
conducted in BSL-3 facilities at the University of Hong Kong, following the
Standard Protocols of the BSL-3 core facility of the University of Hong Kong,
and government and institutional guidelines. Personnel that conducted these
experiments were trained and evaluated according to the requirements of
University of Hong Kong BSL-3 core facility. The animal studies were carried out
in the BSL-3 facility of the University of Hong Kong, with approval from the
Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Training and Research of the University
of Hong Kong (CULATR: 3653-15). The CULATR follows Hong Kong legislation
