for Symptomatic Vitreous Floaters
A Randomized Clinical Trial
Chirag P. Shah, MD, MPH; Jeffrey S. Heier, MD
IMPORTANCE Vitreous floaters are common and can worsen visual quality. YAG vitreolysis is
an untested treatment for floaters.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate YAG laser vitreolysis vs sham vitreolysis for symptomatic Weiss ring
floaters from posterior vitreous detachment.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This single-center, masked, sham-controlled
randomized clinical trial was performed from March 25, 2015, to August 3, 2016, in 52 eyes of
52 patients (36 cases and 16 controls) treated at a private ophthalmology practice.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to YAG laser vitreolysis or sham YAG
(control).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary 6-month outcomes were subjective change
measured from 0% to 100% using a 10-point visual disturbance score, a 5-level qualitative
scale, and National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire 25 (NEI VFQ-25).
Secondary outcomes included objective change assessed by masked grading of color fundus
photography and Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study best-corrected visual acuity.
RESULTS Fifty-two patients (52 eyes; 17 men and 35 women; 51 white and 1 Asian) with
symptomatic Weiss rings were enrolled in the study (mean [SD] age, 61.4 [8.0] years for the
YAG laser group and 61.1 [6.6] years for the sham group). The YAG laser group reported
greater symptomatic improvement (54%) than controls (9%) (difference, 45%; 95% CI,
25%-64%; P < .001). In the YAG laser group, the 10-point visual disturbance score improved
by 3.2 vs 0.1 in the sham group (difference, −3.0; 95% CI, −4.3 to −1.7; P < .001). A total of 19
patients (53%) in the YAG laser group reported significantly or completely improved
symptoms vs 0 individuals in the sham group (difference, 53%; 95% CI, 36%-69%, P < .001).
Compared with sham, NEI VFQ-25 revealed improved general vision (difference, 16.3; 95% CI,
0.9-31.7; P = .04), peripheral vision (difference, 11.6; 95% CI, 0.8-22.4; P = .04), role
difficulties (difference, 17.3; 95% CI, 8.0-26.6; P < .001), and dependency (difference, 5.6;
95% CI, 0.5-10.8; P = .03) among the YAG laser group. Best-corrected visual acuity changed
by −0.2 letters in the YAG laser group and by −0.6 letters in sham group (difference, 0.4; 95%
CI, −6.5 to 5.3; P = .94). No differences in adverse events between groups were identified.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE YAG laser vitreolysis subjectively improved Weiss ring–related
symptoms and objectively improved Weiss ring appearance. Greater confidence in these
outcomes may result from larger confirmatory studies of longer duration.

 F
loaters become more prevalent with age because of de-
generative vitreous changes that occur throughout life.
In youth, hyaluronan keeps collagen fibrils separated in
the vitreous cavity and thus maintains transparency of the
vitreous. However, with time, hyaluronan dissociates from
collagen,causingcross-linkingandaggregationofcollagenwith
fibrous structures that scatter light—a process known as
vitreous liquefaction.1-3
Clinically, a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) is often
marked by a degree of fibroglial tissue known as a Weiss ring
that is free floating over the optic nerve. A PVD allows the
vitreous body to move when the head or eye moves, and thus,
the Weiss ring and vitreous opacities cast shadows onto the
retina that are perceived as floaters.
A PVD is present in approximately 65% of patients reach-
ing the age of 65 years.4,5 Although most patients grow accus-
tomed to the visual disturbance associated with Weiss rings
and other floaters, many find them bothersome.6 Floaters can
reduce contrast sensitivity and quality of life.7,8
Three management options exist for symptomatic float-
ers: patient education and observation, pars plana vitrec-
tomy with a 1-incision Intrector (in which a 1-incision, limited
core vitrectomy is performed while visualizing through an in-
direct ophthalmoscope; Insight Instruments) or a standard
3-port vitrector, and YAG vitreolysis.
Existing literature assessing the effect of YAG laser on the
properties of rabbit vitreous has suggested that pathologic dis-
ruption may occur with laser application in the middle or pos-
terior vitreous.9 There are limited published studies on the ef-
fect of YAG vitreolysis for treating symptomatic floaters in
humans. Small, uncontrolled cases series6,10,11 assessing YAG
vitreolyisis report some symptomatic success and suggest a
goodsafetyprofile.Noprospective,sham-controlledtrialshave
been performed, to our knowledge. This is particularly impor-
tant because of the subjective nature of floater-related visual
disturbance and the potential of placebo effect confounding
the efficacy of treatment. Research by Karickhoff12 showed the
most robust outcomes when treating Weiss rings. Therefore,
the current study evaluated YAG vitreolysis in patients with
symptomatic Weiss rings.
Methods
Participants
This single-center, masked, sham-controlled randomized
clinical trial included 52 patients (35 women and 17 men) at
Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston, Boston, Massachusetts,
from March 25, 2015, through August 3, 2016. All were
patients of the practice with a primary symptom of sympto-
matic floaters. No patients were billed for participation in
the study. Of the 52 participants, 36 were randomly assigned
to unilateral treatment with YAG laser vitreolysis, and 16
were assigned to sham YAG vitreolysis (control). All were fol-
lowed up for 6 months. In all cases, one eye (the eye with the
most patient-determined floater-related symptoms) was
treated, and the other eye was observed. Patients were
assigned to YAG and sham groups in a 2:1 ratio to maximize
the number of treated patients and obtain more robust effi-
cacy and safety data for YAG vitreolysis (Figure 1). All
patients provided written informed consent before partici-
pating in the study, and all data were deidentified. The study
was conducted in adherence to the tenets of the Declaration
of Helsinki, and the methods and execution were consistent
with the International Conference on Harmonisation guide-
lines for Good Clinical Practice. Study approval was obtained
from the Sterling Institutional Review Board, Atlanta, Geor-
gia. The trial protocol can be found in the Supplement 1.
A priori sample calculations assumed a modest improve-
ment in symptoms of 30% in the YAG group compared with
10% in the sham group, yielding a sample of 75 patients with
an SD of 25%, α of .05, and power of 0.9. A planned interim
analysis on January 20, 2016, showed a statistically signifi-
cant difference among the 13 patients who had completed
the study. Thus, the decision was made to schedule no fur-
ther screening visits beyond those already scheduled, result-
ing in 52 enrolled patients.
Inclusion criteria were as follows: symptomatic Weiss ring
floater secondary to PVD; floater symptom duration of at least
6 months; PVD documented on clinical examination, optical
coherence tomography, and B-scan (all performed by the same
examiner [one of us, C.P.S.]; if complete PVD was not visible
for all 3 modalities, the patient was excluded); a self-rated

 visual disturbance of at least 4 on a 0- to 10-point scale, with
0 indicating no symptoms and 10 indicating debilitating symp-
toms;symptomaticWeissring(PVD)locatedatleast3mmfrom
theretinaand5mmfromtheposteriorlenscapsuleofthecrys-
talline lens, as measured on B-scan (patients with pseudopha-
kia had no minimum required distance from the intraocular
lens) to maximize safety; ability to undergo YAG laser proce-
dure; and acceptance of associated risks.
Exclusion criteria were Snellen best-corrected visual
acuity (BCVA) worse than 20/50 in the nonstudy eye; history
of retinal tear, retinal detachment, uveitis, diabetic retinopa-
thy, macular edema, retinal vein occlusion, or aphakia in the
study eye; and history of glaucoma or high intraocular pres-
sure, defined as a history of glaucoma surgery or currently
taking 2 or more topical glaucoma medications in the
study eye.
All patients were followed up for 6 months, with clinical
examinations performed at postoperative week 1, month 1,
month 3, and month 6. The primary outcomes measured at 6
months included subjective percentage of improvement (from
0% to 100%),6 10-point visual disturbance score as described
by Singh,13 5-level qualitative scale described by Delaney et al,6
and the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Question-
naire 25 (NEI VFQ-25). Of these, the NEI VFQ-25 was the only
validated self-reporting method. Secondary outcomes in-
cluded objective change based on masked grading of color
wide-angle fundus photography,6 Early Treatment Diabetic
Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) BCVA, and adverse events.
Preoperative Evaluation and Randomization
Before treatment, all patients completed a nonvalidated base-
line questionnaire, which asked the following6: (1) How long
have you had symptomatic floaters? (2) Do you have sympto-
matic floaters in the right, left, or both eyes? (3) Which eye is
more symptomatic: right or left or both equally sympto-
matic? (4) How many floaters do you have in the more symp-
tomatic eye (or the study eye if both eyes were equally af-
fected)? (5) What activity is most inconvenienced by floater
presence? (6) Rate your visual disturbance by floaters on a
0- to 10-point scale, with 0 indicating no symptoms and
10 indicating debilitating symptoms.
Patient age, sex, and lens status were recorded. The
ETDRS BCVA was determined preoperatively along with a
B-scan. Spectralis optical coherence tomography and infra-
red photography (Heidelberg Engineering), color photogra-
phy (Optos plc), and slitlamp and indirect ophthalmoscope
examination with scleral depression were conducted at
baseline. Status of preexisting macular pathologic findings
was not recorded. The same study coordinator administered
the NEI VFQ-25 at baseline (and again at month 6) for all
patients.
Surgical Procedure
One of us (C.P.S.) performed all the surgical procedures. YAG
vitreolysis was performed using the Ultra Q Reflex laser
(Ellex Medical). A maximum energy per pulse of 7 mJ was
used, as described by Tsai et al.11 The energy was initially set
at 3 mJ and titrated to an appropriate level at which the sur-
geon observed plasma formation with the creation of gas
bubbles. After intraocular pressure was measured, the pupil
of the study eye was dilated with phenylephrine, 2.5%, and
tropicamide, 1%. Proparacaine was given, and an Ocular
Karickhoff 21 mm Vitreous Lens with goniosol was applied
before YAG laser administration. The number of laser shots
given per patient was at the discretion of the treating physi-
cian, but in all cases, laser application ceased after vaporiza-
tion of the Weiss ring and all other visually significant float-
ers. Patients received only 1 laser treatment session to
prevent unmasking of controls.
Participants in the sham group underwent similar treat-
ment; they were fitted with a sham lens that had a lens filter
glued to the surface to prevent YAG energy from passing
through the lens. The YAG laser energy was at its lowest set-
ting of 0.3 mJ. Patients were not asked to which group they
believed they were randomized.
Postoperative Assessment
Notopicaltherapywasgivenpostoperatively.Intraocularpres-
sure was measured at 30 minutes postoperatively. At postop-
erative week 1, month 1, and month 3, all patients underwent
repeatedassessmentwithnon-BCVAslitlampandindirectoph-
thalmoscopy with scleral depression of study eye and appla-
nation tonometry. At postoperative month 6, all patients com-
pleted the NEI VFQ-25 and a questionnaire to assess their
floater symptoms with the following questions: (1) Rate your
visual disturbance by floaters on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 in-
dicating no symptoms and 10 indicating debilitating symp-
toms; (2) Quantify your postoperative improvement as a per-
centage; and (3) How would you describe your floaters today
compared with right before the laser procedure ([a] floaters are
worse, [b] floaters are the same, [c] some improvement but still
floaters of moderate inconvenience, [d] significant improve-
ment with floaters only of slight inconvenience, or [e] com-
plete resolution of floaters)?
The ETDRS BCVA, color photography, optical coherence
tomography, infrared photography, and slitlamp and indirect
ophthalmoscopy with scleral depression of the study eye and
applanation tonometry were performed again at postopera-
tive month 6. One of us (J.S.H.) graded the masked wide-
angle photographs for the presence of floaters by using the
same 5-level qualitative scale used by patients to self-report
their postoperative symptoms compared with baseline. One
of us (J.S.H.) used the following percentages to quantify the
level of improvement: worse, less than 0%; same, 0%; partial
success, 30% to 50%; significant success, 50% to 70%; and
complete success, 100%.6
Statistical Analysis
Continuous outcome variables were compared between
treatment groups with a 2-sample t test and within treat-
ment groups using a paired t test (Excel, Microsoft
Corporation). The 5-level qualitative scale was analyzed as
the proportion reporting significant or complete resolution
using a 2-sample test of proportion (Stata version 12.1,
StataCorp). P < .05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

 Results
Fifty-two patients (52 eyes; 17 men and 35 women; 51 white
and 1 Asian) with symptomatic Weiss rings were enrolled; all
were followed up for 6 months. The mean (SD) age of partici-
pants was 61.4 (8.0) years in the YAG group and 61.1 (6.6) years
in the sham group (age range, 34-77 years; median age, 62
years). The 36 eyes treated with YAG laser vitreolysis (69%
phakic) received a mean of 218 laser shots with a mean power
of1316mJ.Meandurationofsymptomaticfloaterswas6.7years

5.0 years (range, 0.5-30.0 years; median, 3 years) in the sham
group.
Improvement
The YAG group reported significantly greater improvement in
self-reported floater-related visual disturbance (54%) com-
pared with sham controls (9%) (difference, 45%; 95% CI, 25%-
64%; P < .001) (eFigure in Supplement 2). There was no ap-
preciable learning curve effect with YAG vitreolysis; the first
10 patients reported similar improvements as the last 10
patients (54% vs 55%; P = .93).
Visual Disturbance Score on a 10-Point Scale
The YAG group had greater improvement in the visual distur-
bance score (improvement, 3.2) than did the sham group (im-
provement, 0.13) (difference, −3.0; 95% CI, −4.3 to −1.7;
P < .001) (Table 1).
Symptoms on a 5-Level Qualitative Scale
Figure 2 shows that 19 of 36 patients (53%) in the YAG group
reported their symptoms as significantly or completely bet-
ter after treatment vs 0 in the sham group (difference, 53%;
95% CI, 36%-69%; P < .001).
NEI VFQ-25 Scores
Table 2 shows that the YAG group reported significantly bet-
ter general vision (69.4 vs 53.1; difference, 16.3; 95% CI, 0.9-
31.7; P = .04) and peripheral vision (94.4 vs 82.8; difference,
11.6; 95% CI, 0.8-22.4; P = .04) and fewer role difficulties (93.1
vs 75.8; difference, 17.3; 95% CI, 8.0-26.6; P < .001) and de-
pendency on others (98.8 vs 93.2; difference, 5.6; 95% CI, 0.4-
10.8; P = .03) than did sham controls at 6 months.
Objective Change in Masked Grader Photographs
Figure 2 shows that 34 of 36 patients (94%) in the YAG group
had significantly improved or completely resolved floaters
compared with 0 in the sham group (difference, 94%; 95% CI,
87%-102%; P < .001). This objective 95% improvement was
significantly greater than the subjective patient-reported im-
provement of 53% (P < .001).
ETDRS BCVA
Table 3 lists the visual acuity at baseline and 6 months for the
YAG and sham groups. There was no change in ETDRS BCVA
regardlessoftreatmentgroup.IntheYAGgroup,thevisualacu-
ity letter score was 81.7 (approximately 20/25) at baseline and
81.6 (approximately 20/25) at 6 months (P = .84). In the sham
group, the visual acuity letter score was 81.9 (approximately
20/25) at baseline and 81.4 (approximately 20/25) at 6 months
(P = .71). The BCVA changed by −0.2 letters in the YAG group
and by −0.6 in the sham group (difference, 0.4; 95% CI, −6.5
to 5.3; P = .94).
Adverse Events
Noretinaltears,retinaldetachments,elevatedintraocularpres-
sure, or other significant adverse events occurred in the YAG
group by postoperative month 6. One posterior chamber in-
traocular lens was pitted peripherally with the YAG laser when

degeneration occurred in a patient in the sham group.
Discussion
The current study revealed moderate improvement in floater
symptoms with a single laser session by postoperative month
6.Everysubjectiveoutcomemeasureinthisstudywasaligned,
supporting the efficacy of YAG vitreolysis. Patients typically
believed that their floaters were 54% improved after a single
treatment, with 53% of patients reporting significant or com-
plete resolution of symptoms at postoperative month 6. Sev-
eral measures of quality of life also improved compared with
those in the sham laser group, including general vision and in-
dependence. The YAG group reported numerous improve-
ments 6 months after treatment, including in near and dis-
tance activities and mental health.
These findings appear to show better efficacy than those
reported in an analysis of 39 patients treated for PVD-related
floaters by Delaney et al.6 They used a maximum pulse en-
ergyof1.2mJwithameanpowerof310.4mJpersession.There
were no complications after a mean of 1.62 treatment ses-
sions and 26.6 months of follow-up. Only 38% of patients re-
ported moderate or significant benefit from the treatment, de-
fined as an improvement of at least 30% from baseline.6 The
difference between the present study and the study by
Delaney et al6 may relate to the mechanism by which YAG vit-
reolysis removes floaters. YAG works by vaporizing floaters
caused by plasma formation, which may not be appreciated
at the low power levels used by Delaney et al.6 At lower power
levels, the vitreous is fractionated but not vaporized.
In the present study, patients in the sham group reported
a 9% improvement in symptoms at 6 months (range, 0%-
60%; median, 0%), and 5 of the 16 patients (31%) in the sham
group reported between 20% and 60% improvement in their
floater symptoms. This finding suggests a small placebo ef-
fectwithYAGvitreolysisorpossiblyrelatestotheeffectoftime.
This study observed noticeable discrepancies between the
masked grading of photographs by one of us (J.S.H.) and pa-
tients’subjective responses. There are several possible expla-
nations, including that the treating surgeon did not appropri-
ately manage patient expectations; patients particularly
disturbed by vitreous floaters may have high visual demands
and thus have unrealistic visual expectations after YAG vitre-
olysis; and YAG vitreolysis may reduce the appearance of a
Weiss ring on color photography, but patients remain both-
ered by other vitreous opacities not revealed by photogra-
phy. To illustrate, of 8 patients who reported 0% improve-
ment after YAG vitreolysis, one of us (J.S.H.) reported 100%

 improvement in 4 and 50% to 70% improvement in 3. Objec-
tively identified worsening of floaters occurred in 1 case. This
patient had a progressive floater duet (a Weiss ring plus fluffy
anterior, inferior floaters) and was the only patient who un-
derwent vitrectomy (no patients in the sham group under-
went vitrectomy at a later date). The 7 other patients de-
scribed small residual postoperative floaters. Although
comparative photographs showed that their Weiss ring had
improved after YAG treatment, these patients believed that the
presence of residual floaters was just as bothersome as the
original Weiss ring.
No adverse events judged to be of clinical relevance oc-
curredafterYAGlaservitreolysisinthissmallprospectivestudy,
which was underpowered to identify less common potential
complications. However, with use of the rule of 3, there is 95%
confidence that there is no greater than a 1 in 12 (8.3%) risk of
a serious adverse event after YAG vitreolysis.
Limitations
The current study has several limitations, including its small
samplesizeandshortfollow-upperiod.Largerstudieswiththe
same design are needed to corroborate the reported findings.
Longer follow-up is required to determine the long-term
stability of results and the degree of adverse events associ-
ated with the procedure. The current study focused on com-
paring YAG vitreolysis with sham but not with vitrectomy. Al-
though such a comparison fell beyond the scope of this study,
afuturestudycomparingsmall-gaugevitrectomywithYAGvit-
reolysis would help illuminate the benefits and risks of each
procedure. Similarly, although observation alongside patient
education is the most common management approach for
floaters, the current study did not include an observation arm
to prevent unmasking patients in each treatment arm.
The current study also allowed just 1 treatment session per
patient to prevent unmasking. However, this strategy may not
reflect real-world treatment, in which patients may be treated
with additional YAG vitreolysis sessions for persistent float-
ers after initial treatment. Furthermore, results from this study
cannot be generalized to all patients with symptomatic float-
ers because only those with Weiss rings arising from PVD were
treated.
Conclusions
For patients presenting with visual disturbance secondary to
a clinically confirmed Weiss ring, the current study suggests
thatYAGvitreolysisimprovesshort-termvisualoutcomes,both
subjectively and objectively, without adverse events judged
to be clinically relevant.
