Abstract
Objective—To determine whether preschool-aged children with earlier bedtimes have a lower 
risk for adolescent obesity and whether this risk reduction is modified by maternal sensitivity.
Study design—Data from 977 of 1364 participants in the Study of Early Child Care and Youth 
Development were analyzed. Healthy singleton-births at 10 U.S. sites in 1991 were eligible for 
enrollment. In 1995-1996, mothers reported their preschool-aged (mean=4.7 years) child's typical 
weekday bedtime, and mother-child interaction was observed to assess maternal sensitivity. At a 
mean age of 15 years height and weight were measured and adolescent obesity defined as a sex-
specific body-mass-index-for-age ≥95th percentile of the U.S. reference.
Results—One-quarter of preschool-aged children had early bedtimes (8PM or earlier), half had 
bedtimes after 8PM but by 9PM, and one-quarter had late bedtimes (after 9PM). Children's 
bedtimes were similar regardless of maternal sensitivity (P=0.2). The prevalence of adolescent 
obesity was 10%, 16%, and 23%, respectively, across early to late bedtime groups. The 
multivariable-adjusted relative risk (95% confidence interval) for adolescent obesity was 0.48 
(0.29, 0.82) for preschoolers with early bedtimes compared with preschoolers with late bedtimes. 
This risk was not modified by maternal sensitivity (P=0.99).
Conclusions—Preschool-aged children with early weekday bedtimes were half as likely as 
children with late bedtimes to be obese as adolescents. Bedtimes are a modifiable routine that may 
help to prevent obesity.

Sleep; parenting; longitudinal study; prospective; epidemiology; maternal sensitivity
The need to begin obesity prevention early, before children are overweight, is well-
established,1 and healthcare providers play an important role.2 Poor sleep, especially short 
sleep duration, is one risk factor associated with increased risk for obesity.3-5 Numerous 
prospective studies have documented an association in children between short nighttime 
sleep duration and obesity.6-10 Bedtimes have a greater impact on children's sleep duration 
than do wake times,11,12 and are also the likely behavioral target of clinicians and parents. In 
a prospective study of adolescents, later bedtimes predicted increases in body mass index 
(BMI) in adulthood that were not explained by sleep duration.13 Later bedtimes for younger 
children (aged 3 to 8 years at baseline) were associated with higher BMI and risk for 
overweight 5 years later.11 Using data from a cohort with a longer follow-up period, we 
sought to extend the evidence for an association between young children's bedtimes and later 
obesity.
Although the routine of early bedtimes for young children may reduce the risk of later 
obesity, the emotional climate in which parents establish and maintain this routine may 
affect its impact.14 The combined effect of earlier bedtimes and maternal sensitivity has not 
been investigated. Our objectives are to determine: 1) whether preschool-aged children with 
earlier bedtimes have a lower risk of obesity in adolescence, and 2) whether this risk 
reduction is modified by the level of maternal sensitivity.
Methods
The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development 
Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD) was a prospective cohort 
study designed to examine the impact of non-maternal-care on children's developmental 
outcomes.15 Families were recruited from 24 hospitals in 9 U.S. states at their child's birth in 
1991.15 Inclusion criteria were maternal age ≥18 years, English fluency, no plans for 
adoption, singleton and term (≥37 weeks' gestation) birth, and post-birth hospitalization ≤6 
days.15 Each of 10 participating universities secured institutional review board approval for 
all SECCYD protocols. Mothers provided written consent. Our analyses include 977 
children (72% of 1364 enrolled) who had height and weight information available during 
adolescence.
Height and weight were measured, without shoes and wearing only light clothing, in a 
laboratory setting using a standardized protocol; height was measured to the nearest 1/8 inch 
using a wall mounted stadiometer or measuring stick, and weight was measured to the 
nearest 4 ounces using a balance scale.16 We calculated BMI (kg/m2) and defined adolescent 
obesity as a sex-specific BMI-for-age ≥95th percentile of the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) growth reference.17 Height and weight data were extracted 
from the 15-year assessment whenever possible, but for those missing anthropometric data at 
15 years, we used height and weight measured at the oldest age between 12.0 and 15.9

 years. Almost ⅔ of youth (62%) were measured at age 15.0–15.9 years, but 29% were 
14.0–14.9 years, and 9% were 12.0–13.9 years.
During the phone follow-up to the 54-month home-visit, mothers were asked, “What time 
does your child go to bed on most weekday evenings?” The response was open-ended, but 
reported bedtimes were primarily on the whole, half, or quarter hour. We examined the 
distribution and created bedtime categories based on natural break-points and to facilitate 
application of our findings. The most frequently reported bedtimes were 8:00 p.m. (n=171), 
8:30PM (n=194), and 9PM (n=235), but reported bedtimes ranged from 6:45 p.m. to 1:30 
a.m.. Only 52 children had bedtimes before 8PM (≤7:00=13; 7:30=36; 7:45=3), but 220 had 
bedtimes after 9PM (9:15= 8; 9:30=109; between 9:31 and 10PM=62; >10PM=41). We 
defined a late bedtime as after 9PM and an early bedtime as at or before 8PM. We conducted 
sensitivity analyses to understand the impact of our bedtime categorization on our results; in 
these analyses we divided each bedtime category into an earlier and later segment (e.g., the 
early bedtime category was split into ‘before 8PM’ and ‘at 8PM’). These sensitivity analyses 
did not yield meaningful differences and are not presented.
Maternal sensitivity was coded from a standardized, videotaped, 15-20 minute, play-session 
conducted in a child development laboratory during the 54-month assessment. Without the 
child present, mothers were shown the contents of three boxes: 1) an Etch A Sketch® maze, 
2) wooden blocks for building towers, and 3) six animal puppets. Mothers were asked to 
play with their child using the contents of each box in the following order: first have their 
child attempt the maze, then build as many towers as he/she could, and finally play with the 
puppets. Researchers explained that the maze and tower-building activities could be difficult 
for some children, but that mothers should let their child try each activity on his/her own as 
much as possible before helping as needed.18 Videotapes were coded at a central location by 
trained coders who were blind to other information about the family. Coders met regularly 
with an investigator who ensured that consistent rating-standards were maintained.18 
Maternal sensitivity was computed as the sum of three 7-point ratings of observed maternal 
behavior toward the child: supportive presence, respect for autonomy, and hostility [reverse 
coded].18 Maternal sensitivity scores were skewed toward high values; we defined low 
maternal sensitivity as the lowest quartile (scores ≤15), consistent with previous reports.14
Mothers reported their own educational attainment, as well as their child's sex and racial-
ethnic group at study enrollment. Children's birth weights were recorded from birth 
certificates. Mothers reported household size and income when the child was preschool-
aged, and we calculated the household income-to-poverty ratio. When the children were 15-
years-old, mothers self-reported their own current height and weight, which we used to 
assess maternal obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2).
Statistical analyses
We restricted our analyses to participants with information available on our outcome 
variable—adolescent obesity. In the resulting sample (n=977), there were missing data on 
four analytic variables: income-to-poverty ratio (n=65, 7%), bedtime (n=78, 8%), maternal 
sensitivity (n=82, 8%) and maternal obesity (n=89, 9%). These missing data were multiply 
imputed using fully conditional specification.19 Logistic regression and ordinal logistic

 regression were employed to impute, respectively, the binary and ordinal variables. 
Imputation models included all analytic variables as well additional variables chosen for 
their association with the outcome or predictors. Ten imputations were performed, and all 
analyses involving imputed variables were aggregated using multiple imputation combining 
rules to account for imputation uncertainty.20 We also performed a complete-case-analysis 
(n=810), and our conclusions were robust to this sensitivity test.
We used chi-square tests to assess how children in the analytic sample (n=977) differed from 
children who were excluded because they lacked information on adolescent BMI (n=387). 
Associations between adolescent obesity, late bedtime, and sociodemographic characteristics 
were assessed using logistic regression. We used log-binomial regression and Poisson 
regression with robust variance21 to estimate the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence-
intervals (CI) for adolescent obesity associated with bedtime at preschool-age. Bedtime was 
modeled as a categorical variable with the latest bedtime category as the reference group. 
We examined the interaction between maternal sensitivity (low or adequate) and bedtime 
category to assess whether maternal sensitivity modified the relationship between preschool 
bedtime and risk for adolescent obesity. Using this model with adjustment for adolescent 
age, sex, racial/ethnic group, birth weight, maternal education, and maternal obesity, we 
estimated the covariate-adjusted prevalence of adolescent obesity in each of the six bedtime 
by maternal sensitivity groups. There was no evidence of an interaction between bedtime 
and maternal sensitivity, and thus, for parsimony, we present the RR (95% CIs) for 
adolescent obesity omitting this interaction term. Analyses were conducted using SAS 9.3 
(Cary, NC).
Results
Children excluded from the analytic sample were more likely to be male and have less-
educated mothers, but did not significantly differ in birth weight, race/ethnicity, or 
household income-to-poverty ratio (results not shown). Table I provides the characteristics 
of the analytic sample. Sixteen percent (n=161) of the sample was obese in adolescence 
[mean (SD) age=14.9 (0.6) years].
When children were preschool-aged [mean (SD) age=4.7 (0.09) years], approximately 25% 
had a bedtime of 8PM or earlier, 50% had bedtimes after 8PM but by 9PM (ie, 8:01 – 
9:00PM), and 25% had a bedtime after 9PM (Table II). Children's bedtimes were similar 
regardless of maternal sensitivity (P=0.2) (Table II). Late bedtimes were not significantly 
associated with children's sex, birth weight, or maternal obesity. However, children who 
were of non-white race/ethnicity, born to less educated mothers, or living in lower-income 
households were significantly more likely to have a late bedtime at preschool-age (Table I). 
Adolescent obesity was related to all of the participant characteristics examined (Table I).
Earlier bedtimes at preschool-age were associated with lower risk for adolescent obesity. 
The unadjusted prevalence of adolescent obesity across early to late preschool bedtime 
categories was 10%, 16%, and 23%, respectively (Table III). With adjustment for adolescent 
age, sex, racial/ethnic group, birth weight, maternal education, maternal obesity, and 
maternal sensitivity, preschool-aged children with bedtimes at or before 8PM had an RRadj

 (95% CI) for adolescent obesity of 0.48 (0.29, 0.82) compared with preschool-aged children 
with bedtimes after 9PM. Bedtimes after 8PM but by 9PM were associated with an RRadj 
(95% CI) of 0.73 (0.51, 1.06) (Table III). A logistic model predicting adolescent obesity 
with all sociodemographic covariates did not yield a significant interaction between bedtime 
and maternal sensitivity at preschool-age (P=0.99). The predicted prevalence of adolescent 
obesity was lowest for early bedtimes and highest for later bedtimes, irrespective of maternal 
sensitivity (Figure).
Discussion
Many well-designed prospective studies have established that short sleep duration in young 
children is associated with risk for obesity,3,7-10 but no studies have investigated the 
combined impact of maternal sensitivity and children's bedtimes on obesity.
The study that is most directly comparable with ours is an analysis of bedtime, wake time, 
and sleep duration for approximately 2000 children aged 3-12 years in the 1997 Child 
Development Supplement of the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics.11 In that study, more 
hours asleep, earlier bedtimes, and later wake times were associated with lower mean BMI 
and lower likelihood of overweight (BMI-for-age ≥85th percentile) assessed 5 years later.11 
Bedtime was more strongly linked to subsequent BMI for younger (3-7.9 years) compared 
with older (8-12.9 years) children. This is consistent with our finding in SECCYD that 
preschool-aged children (∼4.5 years) with earlier bedtimes were less likely to be obese as 
adolescents. The follow-up period in our study is twice as long as that in prior studies 
focused on the relationship between children's bedtimes and risk for obesity.
A number of prospective studies have examined the impact of childhood sleep duration on 
adolescent or adult obesity outcomes.3,5,6 Of these, the Dunedin study of has the longest 
follow-up period.6 In the Dunedin study, each additional hour of sleep when children were 
5-11 years-old, predicted a mean BMI approximately 1-unit lower at age 32 years and 
approximately a 30% reduction in the risk of obesity (BMI ≥30).6 In relation to risk for 
obesity, more is known about sleep duration than other aspects of sleep, such as bedtimes, 
but evidence from a prospective study of youth followed from adolescence to early 
adulthood suggests late bedtimes may be associated with weight gain independent of sleep 
duration.13
Earlier bedtimes, like other household routines,22,23 predict multiple better outcomes for 
children, aside from healthy weight. Regular and earlier bedtimes were associated with 
fewer parent- and teacher-reported behavioral difficulties in a large study of 3-7 year-old 
children in the UK.24 Similarly, a prospective cohort of infants born in Japan in 2001 found 
that irregular and late bedtimes at age 2 predicted difficulties at age 8 with behavior in the 
domains of attention and aggression.25 Inconsistent and late bedtimes may also contribute to 
sleep problems;26 an international survey of >10,000 mothers of young children (0-5 years) 
reported that regular bedtime routines were associated with reduced sleep latency, fewer 
nighttime awakenings, and greater sleep duration.27

 It is common for preschool-aged children to have a regular bedtime and bedtime routine, but 
this may be less true for families of lower socioeconomic position.28-30 Consistent with this 
literature, we found that late bedtimes were more common for children living in poorer, less-
educated, and minority racial-ethnic families. Bedtime is merely one of many interrelated 
facets of the family environment and parenting practices experienced by children. In the 
context of poverty, poor health, or adverse life events, families may struggle to maintain a 
consistent bedtime routine.31 Our results were robust to adjustment for maternal education 
and minority race/ethnicity, but variability in socioeconomic position was not as great in 
SECCYD as in the population of US children overall.
Our results should be interpreted in the context of the following limitations: First, 
observational studies like ours cannot establish causality, and it is possible that underlying 
biological mechanisms drive both a child's obesity risk and sleep requirements. However, 
randomized intervention studies have included recommendations about bedtime as part of 
multifaceted approaches to childhood obesity prevention.32 Results from such studies are 
promising and support a causal relationship between late bedtime and obesity, but follow-up 
has been short-term. Second, children in our study were born in 1991. We cannot be certain 
that associations would generalize to children born more recently. Third, measurement in our 
study was imperfect. Bedtime was recorded from mothers' phone-interview response to a 
single question about their child's typical weekday bedtime. It is unclear how mothers would 
respond for children with inconsistent bedtimes. Further, we do not know children's sleep 
duration, the quality of their sleep, or whether they have a different bedtime on weekends, 
and these aspects of sleep may also be important.33 Fourth, our results were robust to 
adjustment for multiple additional variables, but confounding due to unmeasured or poorly-
measured variables cannot be excluded. Finally, we used multiple imputation to increase the 
size of our analytic sample. Compared with a complete-case analysis, multiple imputation 
may reduce bias but it also increases variance.
For young children, parents create the routines that allow children to obtain sufficient sleep 
to meet their physiologic needs. However, in establishing young children's bedtimes, like 
other household routines, parents must often make compromises as they face competing 
time demands. For example, some parents' work schedules do not allow them to arrive home 
early enough in the evening to spend time with their child and also maintain an early 
bedtime. This may push children's bedtimes later. At the same time, early bedtimes are 
required for adequate nighttime sleep if children must wake to accommodate their parents' 
work or siblings' school start times. Given the plausible mechanisms linking earlier bedtimes 
and healthy body weight, along with benefits to children's social and emotional functioning, 
pediatricians should encourage parents to establish a routine of early bedtimes for young 
children and support parents in their efforts to overcome the barriers they face in 
implementing this routine.

Data (n=977) from the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD). Children were born in 1991. Percentages may not total to 100% due to rounding and are calculated from multiply 
imputed data.
Data were missing for household income-to-poverty ratio (n=65); bedtime at preschool-age (n=78); maternal sensitivity at preschool-aged (n=82); maternal obesity (n=89).
aP values from logistic regression models (accounting for imputation variance).
bSex-specific BMI-for-age ≥95th percentile of the CDC growth reference from height and weight measured at a mean (SD) age of 14.9 (0.6) years.
cMaternal BMI based on maternal self-report of height and weight when youth was 15 years of age.

Data (n=977) from the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD). Children were born in 1991.
aInformation missing for 78 children for bedtime and 82 children for maternal sensitivity at preschool-age; a total of 96 children were missing 
bedtime and/or maternal sensitivity at preschool-age. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding and are calculated from multiply imputed 
data.
bMaternal sensitivity from observed and coded supportive presence, respect for autonomy, and hostility [reversed] during mother-child interaction 
in the laboratory when child was preschool-aged (mean=56 months). Lowest quartile (score≤15)=low sensitivity; upper three quartiles=adequate 
sensitivity.
cThis middle category includes children whose bedtime was at 9PM.
P value = 0.17 from 2 df F-test in logistic regression model (accounting for imputation variance) predicting maternal sensitivity from bedtime.

Data (n=977) from the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD). Children were born in 1991. Multiple imputation used for 
missing data in 8% of cases.
aSex-specific BMI-for-age ≥95th percentile of the CDC growth reference. Prevalence is unadjusted for covariates.
bModel adjusted for adolescent age. Model fit using log-binomial regression (SAS Proc Genmod, binary distribution, log link).
cModel adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, birth weight, maternal education, maternal sensitivity at preschool-age, and maternal obesity. Model fit 
using Poisson regression with robust variance (SAS Proc Genmod, Poisson distribution, log link).
dThis middle category includes children whose bedtime was at 9PM. The age-adjusted RR (95% CI) for adolescent obesity of having an early 
bedtime (at or before 8PM) compared to a bedtime of after 8PM but by 9PM was 0.62 (0.42 0.97); the fully-adjusted RR (95% CI) was 0.64 (0.40, 
1.04).
