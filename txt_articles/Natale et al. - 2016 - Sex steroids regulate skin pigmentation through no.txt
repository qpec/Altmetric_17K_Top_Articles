Abstract The association between pregnancy and altered cutaneous pigmentation has been
documented for over two millennia, suggesting that sex hormones play a role in regulating
epidermal melanocyte (MC) homeostasis. Here we show that physiologic estrogen (17b-estradiol)
and progesterone reciprocally regulate melanin synthesis. This is intriguing given that we also show
that normal primary human MCs lack classical estrogen or progesterone receptors (ER or PR).
Utilizing both genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we establish that sex steroid effects on
human pigment synthesis are mediated by the membrane-bound, steroid hormone receptors G
protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), and progestin and adipoQ receptor 7 (PAQR7). Activity
of these receptors was activated or inhibited by synthetic estrogen or progesterone analogs that
do not bind to ER or PR. As safe and effective treatment options for skin pigmentation disorders
are limited, these specific GPER and PAQR7 ligands may represent a novel class of therapeutics.

Introduction
Cutaneous pigmentary changes have been long recognized as common side effects of pregnancy.
The British physician Daniel Turner, in his 1714 De Morbis Cutaneis (Turner, 1726), references Hip-
pocrates (460–370 B.C.E.), “There is a spot on the face. . .more peculiar, according to our great mas-
ter Hippoc., to Big Belly’d women, and recon’d as one of the Signs of Conception.” Modern
physicians recognize this common pregnancy-associated hyperpigmentation as melasma (Sheth and
Pandya, 2011; Nicolaidou and Katsambas, 2014). Hippocrates also thought that the pigment was
predictive of the sex of the fetus: Quae utero gerentes, maculum in facie veluti ex solis adustione
habent, eae faemellas plerumque gestant. Translated to English: pregnant women who have a mark
on the face as though stained by the sun, quite often give birth to girls. While Turner noted this
association with fetal sex to be ’fallible’, Hippocrates was remarkably astute in linking the pigment
increases to the tanning response to DNA-damaging solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation. While early
physicians attributed the pigment changes to “Retention of the menstrual Flux” (Turner and Cuta-
neis, 1726), the molecular mechanisms through which pregnancy-associated hormonal changes
modulate skin color have remained elusive for over 2,000 years.
Melanocytes in the basal epidermis control skin pigmentation through synthesis of melanin, a
complex process thought to be primarily regulated by alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone
(aMSH) (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B). The aMSH peptide is secreted centrally by the
anterior pituitary gland, and locally by keratinocytes in response to UV damage (Cui et al., 2007).
aMSH binding to the melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR),

 activates adenylate cyclase, and increases cAMP. This secondary messenger activates a cascade of
downstream transcriptional events leading to expression of genes required for melanin synthesis
(Rodrı
´guez and Setaluri, 2014). Exogenous broadly-acting adenylate cyclase activators such as
plant-derived forskolin, also stimulate melanin production (D’Orazio et al., 2006), but the degree to
which other endogenous molecules, other than aMSH regulate melanin synthesis in tissue is unclear.
However, the observation that melasma frequently occurs in non-pregnant women using oral con-
traceptive
pills,
which
contain
only
steroid
hormone
analogs
(Sheth
and
Pandya,
2011;
Resnik, 1967a), suggests that humans may maintain aMSH-independent pigment control mecha-
nisms. Identifying these pathways, and strategies to specifically access them pharmacologically to
modulate skin pigmentation, may have substantial therapeutic utility.
Results
Estrogen and progesterone reciprocally regulate melanin synthesis
To examine whether sex steroids influence melanin synthesis, we treated primary human melanocytes
with estrogen (17b-estradiol). This resulted in a dose-dependent melanin increase (Figure 1—figure
supplement 1C). After 4 days of exposure to 25 nM estrogen, a medically-relevant concentration
observed during pregnancy (Abbassi-Ghanavati et al., 2009), melanin was markedly increased (208%
+/- 27%) in three individual isolates of primary human melanocytes (Figure 1A). The magnitude of this
change was similar to that observed with aMSH (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D), and is consistent
with prior in vitro studies implicating estrogen in melanin synthesis (McLeod et al., 1994;
Ranson et al., 1988). Hormonal oral contraceptives, most of which incorporate ethinyl estradiol, are
associated with melasma (Resnik, 1967b). Ethinyl estradiol also increased melanin to levels similar to
those observed with native estrogen. To examine the effects of estrogen on melanocyte homeostasis
in the context of intact human epidermis, architecturally-faithful three-dimensional organotypic skin
was established utilizing normal primary epidermal keratinocytes and melanocytes in native human
stroma (Ridky et al., 2010; Monteleon et al., 2015; Duperret et al., 2014; McNeal et al., 2015).
After one week, estrogen-treated skin displayed a threefold increase in melanin content (Figure 1B),
without changes in melanocyte number or density (Figure 1C).
Estrogen effects in other tissue types are often counter-balanced by progesterone (Ismail et al.,
2015), which also increases during pregnancy. To determine whether this reciprocal relationship is
active in melanocytes, we treated cells with physiologic levels of progesterone, which resulted in a
dose-dependent decrease in melanin production (Figure 1—figure supplement 1F). At 500 nM, a
concentration observed in third trimester pregnancy (Abbassi-Ghanavati et al., 2009), progesterone
eLife digest Factors controlling pigment production in skin are complex and poorly understood.
Cells called melanocytes produce a pigment called melanin, which makes the skin darker. It has
been known for a long time that skin color often changes during pregnancy, which suggests that sex
hormones may be involved. However, the specific hormones and signaling mechanisms responsible
for the changes have remained largely undefined.
Estrogen and progesterone are two of the main female sex hormones. Natale et al. now show
that estrogen increases pigment production in human melanocytes, and progesterone decreases it.
For hormones to signal to cells, they must bind to and activate particular receptor proteins.
Further investigation by Natale et al. revealed that estrogen and progesterone regulate pigment
production by binding to receptors that belong to a family called G protein-coupled receptors.
These receptors can signal rapidly once activated by sex hormones, and may serve as therapeutic
targets for treating pigmentation disorders.
Skin diseases that cause inflammation often also cause changes in skin color. Natale et al. noticed
several other G protein-coupled receptors that are likely to control pigmentation through similar
mechanisms. Future analyses of the roles that these other receptors perform in melanocytes may
therefore reveal how inflammation-based pigmentation changes occur.

 decreased melanin production by half (58% +/- 11.4%), both in culture (Figure 1D) and in skin tissue
(Figure 1E), without altering melanocyte cell number (Figure 1F). Most of our primary melanocytes
were derived from newborn male foreskin. To determine whether female cells also responded simi-
larly, we treated female iPS-derived melanocytes with estrogen and progesterone and noted
responses similar to those observed with the male cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 1G). To
determine whether melanocytes isolated from body sites other than foreskin also responded simi-
larly to sex hormones, we treated melanocytes from adult facial skin with estrogen and progesterone
and again observed responses that were similar to those observed with the foreskin melanocytes
(Figure 1—figure supplement 1H).
Consistent with other groups who have noted that steroid hormones have variable effects on
melanocyte proliferation in culture (Im et al., 2002), we observed modest changes in proliferation
when isolated primary cells were treated with estrogen or progesterone in vitro. Estrogen treated
melanocytes tended to proliferate slightly slower, while progesterone treated cells tended to prolif-
erate slightly faster (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B). The effects varied with the basal level of
melanin production. Melanocytes from dark skin were more sensitive to progesterone than estrogen,
while melanocytes from light skin were more sensitive to estrogen. These proliferation changes are
likely an in vitro artifact, as adult interfollicular epidermal melanocytes are relatively nonproliferative
in vivo, and we did not note any changes in melanocyte numbers in sex steroid-treated 3-D organo-
typic tissues. Consistent with this lack of melanocyte proliferation in interfollicular epidermis, another
group thoroughly examined 280 tissue sections from normal human skin from 18 donors, and identi-
fied only 2 proliferative interfollicular melanocytes (Jimbow et al., 1975).
Primary human melanocytes do not express nuclear estrogen or
progesterone receptors (ER/PR), and respond to sex steroids via
altered cAMP signaling
To determine the mechanisms mediating estrogen and progesterone pigment effects, we examined
components of the canonical pigment production pathway, and observed a cAMP increase upon
estrogen treatment (Figure 2A), suggesting that estrogen accesses the canonical pigment produc-
tion pathway downstream of MC1R. Consistent with this, pCREB and MITF proteins were similarly
induced (Figure 2B). In contrast, progesterone reciprocally decreased melanin, cAMP, pCREB and
MITF (Figures 2C–D).
These data indicate that estrogen, progesterone, and aMSH converge on adenylate cyclase to
reciprocally modulate melanin synthesis, and suggest that individual steroid effects may counter-bal-
ance each other. Consistent with this, the estrogen effects were significantly attenuated in the pres-
ence
of
progesterone
(Figure
2E).
This
likely
helps
explain
why
pregnancy-associated
hyperpigmentation is characteristically limited to specific areas where melanocyte or UV radiation
exposure is highest including the face, genital, and areolar regions (Szabo, 1954; Staricco and Pin-
kus, 1957). It is also possible that in the complex hormonal milieu of pregnancy, additional factors
beyond the sex steroid activated pathways described here also contribute to skin color modulation.
As steroid hormones are not predicted to signal through MC1R, whose natural ligand is the pep-
tide aMSH, we sought to identify the specific receptors mediating the estrogen and progesterone
pigment effects. We did not detect classical estrogen (ER) or progesterone (PR) receptors in melano-
cytes using qRT-PCR, although transcripts were observed in breast cells (Figure 2—figure supple-
ment 1A). Previous RNAseq studies in human melanocytes, conducted for unrelated experimental
questions (Flockhart et al., 2012), also failed to detect ER or PR transcripts (Figure 2—figure sup-
plement 1B). Consistent with this, ER or PR protein was not observed in MC via western blotting,
although both receptors were readily apparent in breast cells (Figure 2F).
Sex steroid signaling in melanocytes is dependent on the nonclassical
membrane bound G-protein coupled sex hormone receptors GPER and
PAQR7
Considering MC1R is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), we hypothesized that alternative
GPCRs mediate sex steroid pigment effects. To identify possible candidates, we analyzed whole
transcriptome melanocyte RNAseq data. Of 412 known or predicted 7-pass human GPCRs
(Alexander et al., 2013), 61 distinct GPCRs were expressed in MCs, including the membrane-

 bound, G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (Filardo et al., 2002) (GPER) (Figure 2—source
data 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). Given that prior work in breast cancer cell lines
and fish oocytes determined that estrogen binding to GPER modulates cAMP (Filardo et al.,
2002; Thomas et al., 2005; Cabas et al., 2013; Majumder et al., 2015; Pang and Thomas,
2010), and that cAMP signaling stimulates melanin synthesis, we thought it possible that GPER
may be the physiologically relevant human melanocyte estrogen receptor. The melanocyte RNA-
seq studies also demonstrated that an analogous, noncanonical G protein-coupled progesterone
receptor, progestin and adipoQ receptor 7 (PAQR7) (Zhu et al., 2003; Tang et al., 2005), was
also expressed (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). We next used qRT-PCR to verify that GPER
and PAQR7 are both expressed in primary human MC (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). Nota-
bly, GPER and PAQR7 expression was markedly lower in other skin cells including keratinocytes
and fibroblasts (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D).
To establish the necessity of GPER and PAQR7 in mediating sex hormone effects in MCs, we first
depleted GPER using either of two independent shRNA hairpins, which completely eliminated the
melanocyte pigmentation response to estrogen (Figure 2G and Figure 2—figure supplement 1E–
F). Analogous shRNA-mediated PAQR7 depletion ablated the pigmentary response to progesterone
(Figure 2H and Figure 2—figure supplement 1F). To verify these results, we next used a comple-
mentary genetic approach based on CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene disruption of GPER or PAQR7,
which also completely blocked the pigmentary response to estrogen and progesterone, respectively
(Figure 2—figure supplement 1G–H). Consistent with our model in which these receptors access
melanin synthesis at the level of adenylate cyclase, PAQR7 was found to bind progesterone and reg-
ulate the final stages of sea trout oocyte meiosis through cAMP reduction (Zhu et al., 2003;
Tokumoto et al., 2012). In that fish system, PAQR7 signals through G protein complexes containing
the inhibitory G subunit (Gi), which represses adenylate cyclase. To examine whether this signaling
mechanism is functional in melanocytes, we treated melanocytes with progesterone in the presence
of pertussis toxin (PTX), an exotoxin that specifically inactivates Gi subunits via ADP-ribosylation.
With PTX treatment alone, we observed a small increase in melanin production. This likely reflects
inhibition of Gi released from basal PAQR7 activity, as well Gi subunits from other GPCRs that collec-
tively contribute to the basal level of cAMP signaling observed in culture. Importantly, PTX blocked
progesterone effects, establishing that progesterone signals through Gi subunits (Figure 2—figure
supplement 2A).
Specific activation of GPER or PAQR7 is sufficient to alter pigment
production in human skin tissue
To complement these genetic studies establishing that GPER and PAQR7 are the melanocyte
sex steroid receptors, we utilized a pharmacologic approach employing synthetic steroid analogs
with specific agonist or antagonist activity on ER, PR, GPER, or PAQR7. Tamoxifen, an ER antag-
onist, is associated with melasma in breast cancer patients (Kim and Yoon, 2009). The mecha-
nistic basis for the pigment change was previously unknown. However, tamoxifen is a GPER
agonist (Thomas et al., 2005; Li et al., 2010), and increased melanin to levels comparable to
those observed with estrogen (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). To determine whether GPER
signaling
was

to
increase
melanin,
we
utilized
the
specific
GPER
agonist
G-1
(Bologa et al., 2006), an estrogen analog developed for mechanistic studies in other systems
that does not bind ER. G-1 drove a dose-dependent increase in melanin production through
pCREB and MITF that was GPER dependent (Figure 3A–C and Figure 3—figure supplement
2A–D). Further establishing that GPER is the melanocyte estrogen receptor, G-1 and estrogen
effects were blocked by either of two specific GPER antagonists, G-15 and G-36 (Figure 3—fig-
ure supplement 2E), which do not have inhibitory activity against ER (Dennis et al., 2009;
2011). To establish that PAQR7 signaling is sufficient to decrease melanin production, we used
a specific PAQR7 agonist Org OD-02 (CH2P4), which does not bind PR (Kelder et al., 2010).
CH2P4 caused a dose-dependent decrease in melanin production through pCREB and MITF that
was PAQR7 dependent (Figure 3D–F and Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–D).

 observed a gradual increase pigmentation compared to vehicle-treated controls over 3 weeks
(Figure 4A). Melanin content was increased 1.6-fold, a cosmetically significant change, and was con-
sistent with the magnitude of change seen in vitro (Figure 4B–C). Clinically apparent skin darkening
on mice increased over 2–3 weeks while pigment changes in culture were more rapid. It is likely that
the synthetic GPCR ligands are metabolized and/or distributed differently in vivo then in in vitro cul-
ture, such that the effective local concentration of steroid in the in vivo setting is relatively transient.
Optimization of an ideal topical formulation and dosing schedule will require additional study in the
context of a human clinical trial.
Discussion
Safe and effective approaches for modulating skin melanocyte function for therapeutic benefit are
lacking, largely because the factors normally regulating melanocyte homeostasis are complex and
incompletely deciphered. Defining these mechanisms is important however, as myriad genetic and
acquired conditions including common afflictions such as acne, eczema, vitiligo, ultraviolet (UV) radi-
ation exposure, traumatic injury, and pregnancy are associated with alterations in skin pigmentation
that can be extensive and long-lasting (James et al., 2011). Another population that could poten-
tially benefit from modulating skin pigment are people with naturally light skin, especially those with
red hair, who have a markedly decreased ability to synthesize UV-protective brown eumelanin as a
result of inactivating mutations in MC1R (Valverde et al., 1995). This large population is especially
susceptible to photodamage, sunburns, and has an increased lifetime risk of keratinocyte and mela-
nocyte-derived skin cancers (Han et al., 2006). There is currently no available therapeutic that pro-
motes protective eumelanin pigment production. However, the specific activation of GPER
alternatively activates cAMP signaling, bypassing MC1R, to stimulate melanin synthesis, and could
therefore be especially useful in this sun-vulnerable population. Selective GPER activation in skin
could potentially be a safe alternative to intentional UV radiation exposure (via natural sunlight or
tanning beds) for individuals seeking what they perceive as an aesthetically desirable tan. The only
method currently available to increase skin melanin is UV exposure. While effective at darkening
skin, the requisite DNA damage promotes premature aging, wrinkles, and skin cancer.
Commonly utilized approaches for decreasing skin melanin are also often unsafe, and involve
application of toxic mercury or arsenic compounds, especially common in India, China, Japan, and
Korea, but also encountered in the U.S., and recently highlighted in a report from the California
Department of Public Health (Report #14–046, 2014), or hydroquinone, a tyrosinase inhibitor, which
has been banned in Europe because of concerns regarding its possible association with cancer
(McGregor, 2007). Our findings describe small molecule sex steroid analogs, without these toxic-
ities, that modulate pigment production (Figure 4D).
Therapeutic use of GPER or PAQR7 agonists/antagonists could potentially have effects on cells
other than epidermal melanocytes. While topical delivery of such agents would likely avoid off target
effects in distant tissues, there exits the theoretical possibility of off-target effects within the skin.
However, we did not note any significant abnormalities in the epidermis from our in vitro or in vivo
skin tissues treated with the sex steroids.
GPER and PAQR7 have been identified only relatively recently, but are expressed in several tis-
sues, and may mediate at least some of the estrogen and progesterone effects that cannot be attrib-
uted to the classical nuclear hormone receptors. GPER has been identified in the reproductive,
nervous, cardiovascular, renal, pancreas, and immune systems (Prossnitz and Barton, 2011). In
immune cells, GPER expression on T cells has been shown to play a role in 17b-estradiol-induced
thymic atrophy and autoimmune encephalomyelitis. PAQR7 is expressed in the reproductive and
nervous systems (Tokumoto et al., 2016), and in murine macrophages (Lu et al., 2015) and in
human T cells (Dosiou et al., 2008), although the functional role of PAQR7 in those tissues remains
relatively unclear. Given that the increased systemic estrogen and progesterone associated with
pregnancy does not typically result in skin cancer or significant pathology in other tissues, we think it
likely that the specific GPER and PAQR7 agonists will be well-tolerated. Nonetheless, formal toxicity
studies and careful evaluation of human skin treated in clinical trials will be important.
The finding that PAQR7 works through inhibitory Gi subunits is especially interesting, as it is the
first example of a melanocyte cellular signaling cascade that actively represses melanin synthesis at
the level of G-protein signaling, as opposed to classically defined pigment control mechanisms that

 modulate the strength of the stimulatory MC1R signal. In many animal systems, the Agouti protein
decreases pigment production via physically binding to MC1R and inhibiting aMSH stimulation
(Ollmann et al., 1998), rather than through an actively suppressive mechanism.
Our finding that normal primary melanocytes lack nuclear ER or PR contradicts a prior report
(Im et al., 2002). This group performed immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR to support the claim
that nuclear estrogen receptors are expressed in melanocytes, but in our view, the data presented in
that work is not especially convincing, and there is no evidence in that work that nuclear hormone
signaling drives changes in melanin synthesis. Another group demonstrated that melanocyte protein
extracts have the ability to bind radioactive estrogen, but that work did not identify the specific pro-
tein(s) responsible for the binding activity (Jee et al., 1994). We do not exclude the possibility that
in some tissue settings, including neoplastic lesions and possibly hair follicles, melanocytes express
nuclear ER/PR. Still, as there is no known direct signaling pathway linking nuclear sex hormone
receptors to the melanin synthesis machinery, it is most likely that the major effects of estrogen and
progesterone on pigment production are mediated through the Gs and Gi coupled GPCRs identified
in our current work.
We have shown that signaling through GPCRs other than MC1R directly affects melanin produc-
tion. While surveying all the 7-pass transmembrane proteins expressed in melanocytes, we noted
expression of several additional receptors that may also influence melanin production. These include
histamine (Yoshida et al., 2000; Lassalle et al., 2003) and leukotriene receptors, which in other con-
texts are known to signal through Gs and Gi subunits (Mondillo et al., 2005; Arcemisbe
´he
`re et al.,
2010). Future functional analysis of these and other GPCRs in melanocytes may elucidate the mecha-
nisms responsible for the pigmentation changes that frequently accompany many skin diseases asso-
ciated with inflammation. These studies may identify additional ’drugable’ and therapeutically useful
receptors in melanocytes, and will help advance an understanding of how cumulative GPCR signaling
is integrated to regulate melanin production in human skin.
Materials and methods
Melanocyte culture
Primary melanocytes were extracted from fresh discarded human foreskin and surgical specimens as
described previously described with some modifications detailed as follows. After overnight incuba-
tion in Dispase, the epidermis was separated from the dermis and treated with trypsin for 10 min.
Cells were pelleted and plated on selective MC Medium 254 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with Human
Melanocyte Growth Supplement, and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Lightly pigmented primary
melanocytes were utilized for experiments assaying estrogen and GPER agonist effects, and heavily
pigmented primary melanocytes were utilized for experiments assaying progesterone and PAQR7
agonist effects in melanin production. Female iPS-derived human melanocytes were a gift from
Meenhard Herlyn (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, USA). Progesterone (P8783), 17b-Estradiol
(E8875), and aMSH (M4135) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). G-1 (10008933), G-
15 (14673) and G-36 (14397) were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). CH2P4 (2085)
was purchased from Axon Medchem (Groningen, Netherlands). Pertussis toxin was purchased from
R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN). These compounds were diluted to working stock solutions in
Medium 254.
Melanin assay
2 x 105 melanocytes were seeded uniformly on 6-well tissue culture plates. Cells were treated with
vehicle controls, sex steroids, hormone derivatives, or pertussis toxin for 4 days. Cells were then
trypsinized, counted, and spun at 300 g for 5 min. The resulting cell pellet was solubilized in 120 mL
of 1M NaOH, and boiled for 5 min. The optical density of the resulting solution was read at 450 nm
using an EMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The absorbance was normal-
ized to the number of cells in each sample, and relative amounts of melanin were set based on vehi-
cle treated controls. For tissue melanin assays, tissue was weighed prior to boiling in 1M NaOH for
20 min. Samples were spun down to eliminate insoluble materials, and then the optical density of
the sample was measured as previously described and normalized to the weight of tissue.

 Preparation of 3-D organotypic skin cultures
Organotypic skin grafts containing MCs were established using modifications to previously detailed
methods (Ridky et al., 2010; Chudnovsky et al., 2005). The Keratinocyte Growth Media (KGM)
used for keratinocyte-only skin grafts was replaced with modified Melanocyte Xenograft Seeding
Media (MXSM). MXSM is a 1:1 mixture of KGM, lacking cholera toxin, and Keratinocyte Media 50/50
(Gibco) containing 2% FBS, 1.2 mM calcium chloride, 100 nM Et-3 (endothelin 3), 10 ng/mL rhSCF
(recombinant human stem cell factor), and 4.5 ng/mL r-basic FGF (recombinant basic fibroblast
growth factor). 1.5 x 105 melanocytes and 5.0 x 105 keratinocytes were suspended in 80 mL MXSM,
seeded onto the dermis, and incubated at 37˚C for 8 days at the air-liquid interface.
Topical G-1 treatment
2% (w/v) G-1 was prepared in DMSO, 20 mL of this solution was applied daily to the right ear, with
vehicle only applied to the left ear, of 4-week-old C57BL/6 mice. These studies were preformed
without inclusion/exclusion criteria, randomization, or blinding. Based on a twofold anticipated
effect, we preformed this experiment with 3 biological replicates. All procedures were performed in
accordance with IACUC-approved protocols at the University of Pennsylvania.
Western blot analyses and antibodies
Adherent cells were treated with 1 mM doses of E2 and P4 overnight, washed once with DPBS, and
lysed with 1% NP-40 buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, and 1% NP-40) con-
taining 1X protease inhibitors (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)) and 1X phosphatase inhibitors (Roche).
Lysates were quantified (Bradford assay), normalized, reduced, denatured (95˚C) and resolved by
SDS gel electrophoresis on 4–15% Tris/Glycine gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Resolved protein was
transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA) using a Semi-Dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad),
blocked in 5% BSA in TBS-T and probed with primary antibodies recognizing MITF (Cell Signaling
Technology, #12590, 1:1000, Danvers, MA), p-CREB (Cell Signaling Technology, #9198, 1:1000),
CREB (Cell Signaling Technology, #9104, 1:1000), and b-Actin (Cell Signaling Technology, #3700,
1:4000). After incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody, proteins were detected using
either Luminata Crescendo Western HRP Substrate (Millipore) or ECL Western Blotting Analysis Sys-
tem (GE Healthcare, Bensalem, PA).
cAMP ELISA
cAMP ELISA was performed on primary human melanocytes using the Cyclic AMP XP Assay Kit (Cell
Signaling Technology, #4339) following manufacturer instructions.
Melanin staining
Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue was sectioned at 5 mM and collected on superfrost plus
slides (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA), and subjected to Fontana-Masson stain for melanin (Masson, 1928).
Briefly, sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and incubated in the following solutions: 2.5%
aqueous silver nitrate for 10 min, 0.1% aqueous gold chloride for 15 min, and 5% aqueous sodium
thiosulfate for 5 min. Distilled deionized water was used for rinsing and incubations were done at
room temperature except for silver nitrate at 60˚C. Slides were counterstained with 0.1% nuclear
fast red Kernechtrot for 5 min, dehydrated, cleared, and coverslipped using MM24 mounting media
(Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). All staining reagents were from Polyscientific R and D Corporation (Bay
Shore, NY).
Immunohistochemistry
Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) human skin tissue sections from organotypic tissue was
stained for MITF protein expression using a primary antibody to MITF (Leica Biosystems, NCL-L-
MITF, 1:15). Staining was performed following the manufacturer protocol for high temperature anti-
gen unmasking technique for immunohistochemical demonstration on paraffin sections.
Quantification of melanin staining
Tissue sections from organotypic culture were stained using methods described above. Quantifica-
tion was performed according to Billings et al. (2015). Briefly, 20X photomicrograph images of

 representative tissue sections were taken using the Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Tiff files of the
images were saved and transferred to Adobe Photoshop where pixels corresponding to Fontana-
Masson staining and epidermal counter stain were selected using the color selection tool. Images
corresponding to the single specific color were then analyzed using FIJI (Image J) to determine the
number of pixels in each sample. The numbers of pixels representing Fontana-Masson staining were
normalized to the total amount epidermal counter staining. Final ratios Fontana-Masson staining in
the epidermis were set relative to amount of staining in vehicle treated controls.
Quantitative RT/PCR
mRNA was extracted from melanocytes according to the RNeasy Mini Kit protocol (Qiagen, Venlo,
Netherlands), and reverse transcribed to cDNA using the High Capacity RNA-to cDNA kit (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Quantitative PCR of the resulting cDNA was carried out using Power
SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and gene-specific primers, in triplicate, on a ViiA 7
Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies). The following primers were used for detection; B-Actin

ethan- 1-one was prepared by the method of Baudelle et al. (1998) 6-bromopiperonal (1.110 g,
4.85 mmol) and 4-aminoacetophenone (656 mg, 4.85 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile
(16.2 mL, 0.3M) and allowed to stir at 25˚C under argon. After approximately 1.5 hr, trifluoroacetic
acid (350 mL, 4.61 mmol) was added and the reaction was allowed to stir at 25˚C for 45 min. Freshly
prepared cyclopentadiene (1.63 mL, 19.4 mmol) was added dropwise to the reaction mixture. After
2 hr at 25˚C the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was purified by silica
gel chromatography using 30% EtOAc in hexanes as eluent to provide racemic 1-(4-(6-bromobenzo
[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-3a,4,5,9b-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinolin-8-yl)ethan-1-one (1.05 g, 53%). The
G-1 was >95% pure as determined by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis. 1H and 13C
NMR were identical to the data reported by Burai et al. (2010).
