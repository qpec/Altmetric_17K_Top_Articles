 Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Zoledronic acid, a third-generation aminobisphosphonate, reduces the 
incidence of skeletal-related events and pain in patients with bone metastases. The optimal dosing 
interval for zoledronic acid is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE—To determine whether zoledronic acid administered every 12 weeks is noninferior 
to zoledronic acid administered every 4 weeks.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS—Randomized, open-label clinical trial conducted at 269 
academic and community sites in the United States. Patients (n = 1822) with metastatic breast 
cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, or multiple myeloma who had at least 1 site of bone 
involvement were enrolled between May 2009 and April 2012; follow-up concluded in April 2014.
INTERVENTIONS;—Patients were randomized to receive zoledronic acid administered 
intravenously every 4 weeks (n = 911) vs every 12 weeks (n = 911) for 2 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES;—The primary end point was the proportion of patients 
having at least 1 skeletal-related event (defined as clinical fracture, spinal cord compression, 
radiation to bone, or surgery involving bone) within 2 years after randomization and a between-
group absolute difference of 7%as the noninferiority margin. Secondary end points included the 
proportion of patients with at least 1 skeletal-related event by disease type, pain as assessed by the 
Brief Pain Inventory (range, 0–10; higher scores indicate worse pain), Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group performance status (range, 0–4; higher scores indicate worse disability), 
incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw, kidney dysfunction, skeletal morbidity rate (mean number of 
skeletal-related events per year), and, in a subset of 553 patients, suppression of bone turnover 
(assessed by C-terminal telopeptide levels).
RESULTS—Among 1822 patients who were randomized (median age, 65 years; 980 [53.8%] 
women; 855 with breast cancer, 689 with prostate cancer, and 278 with multiplemyeloma), 795 
completed the study at 2 years. A total of 260 patients (29.5%) in the zoledronic acid every 4-week 
dosing group and 253 patients (28.6%) in the every 12-week dosing group experienced at least 1 
skeletal-related event within 2 years of randomization (risk difference of −0.3%[1-sided 95%CI, 
−4% to ∞]; P < .001 for noninferiority). The proportions of skeletal-related events did not differ 
significantly between the every 4-week dosing group vs the every 12-week dosing group for 
patients with breast cancer, prostate cancer, or multiple myeloma. Pain scores, performance status 
scores, incidence of jaw osteonecrosis, and kidney dysfunction did not differ significantly between 
the treatment groups. Skeletal morbidity rates were numerically identical in both groups, but bone 
turnover was greater (C-terminal telopeptide levels were higher) among patients who received 
zoledronic acid every 12 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Among patients with bone metastases due to breast 
cancer, prostate cancer, or multiplemyeloma, the use of zoledronic acid every 12 weeks compared 
with the standard dosing interval of every 4 weeks did not result in an increased risk of skeletal 
events over 2 years. This longer interval may be an acceptable treatment option.

 the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma and bone metastases from solid tumors. 
Zoledronic acid administered intravenously every 3 to 4 weeks reduces pain and the 
incidence of skeletal-related events, including clinical fracture, spinal cord compression, 
radiation to bone, and surgery to bone by 25% to 40%.1–3
Bisphosphonates are generally well tolerated, but are associated with toxic effects, including 
osteonecrosis of the jaw, nephrotoxicity, and hypocalcemia. The incidence of osteonecrosis 
of the jaw increases with cumulative drug exposure from 1.5%for patients treated for 
4months to 12months to 7.7%for patients treated for 37 months to 48 months.4 
Bisphosphonates are nephrotoxic, manifesting as elevated serum creatinine levels. 
Hypocalcemia is rarely clinically symptomatic.5
The optimal dosing interval for zoledronic acid has not been determined. The standard 
dosing interval of every 4 weeks was derived empirically rather than from comparative 
studies or compelling pharmacodynamic data. Several studies have addressed the dosing 
interval. In the ZOOM6 and OPTIMIZE-27 trials, patients with breast cancer and skeletal 
metastases were pretreated with zoledronic acid every 4 weeks for9months 
to15monthsandthen randomized to receive zoledronic acid every4weeks or every 12weeks 
for 12months. Neither study showed significant differences in efficacy or toxicity for the 2 
dosing regimens.
The hypothesis of this study was that zoledronic acid administered every 12weeks for 2 
years would be noninferior to zoledronic acid administered at the standard interval of every 
4weeks for 2 years among patients with metastatic breast cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, 
or multiplemyeloma.
Methods
The human protection committee at each participating institution approved the trial protocol 
(CALGB 70604 [Alliance]) and the patient consent form (Supplement 1). Written informed 
consent was obtained from each study participant. Separate written consent was obtained for 
the companion study assessing suppression of bone turnover (CALGB150804 [Alliance]). 
No stipends were given to patients for participating in the study.
Patient Eligibility
Patients were required to have histologically proven breast cancer, prostate cancer, or 
multiple myeloma with at least 1 site of bone involvement as documented by plain 
radiograph, computed tomographic scan, positron emission tomographic scan, combination 
computed tomographic and positron emission tomographic scan, magnetic resonance 
imaging, bone scan, or skeletal survey. Indeterminate lesions were confirmed using a second 
imaging method.
Other eligibility requirements included age of 18 years or older, Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status8 score of 0 to 2, calculated creatinine 
clearance of 30mL/minor greater using the Cockroft and Gault formula,9

Key Points
•
Question Is zoledronic acid administered every 12 weeks for 2 years 
noninferior to zoledronic acid administered at the standard dosing interval of 
every 4 weeks for 2 years?
•
Findings In this randomized, open-label, noninferiority clinical trial of 1822 
patients with metastatic breast cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, or 
multiplemyeloma, 795 completed the study, among whom 29.5%of patients 
receiving zoledronic acid every 4 weeks and 28.6%of patients receiving 
zoledronic acid every 12 weeks experienced at least 1 skeletal-related event 
within 2 years of randomization, meeting criteria for noninferiority.
•
Meaning Among patients with bone metastases due to breast cancer, prostate 
cancer, or multiplemyeloma, the use of zoledronic acid every 12 weeks 
compared with every 4 weeks did not result in an increased risk of skeletal 
events over 2 years.
Patients were ineligible if they had brain metastases or had received prior intravenous 
bisphosphonates (prior use of oral bisphosphonates was allowed if discontinued prior to 
randomization), denosumab, or bone-targeting radiopharmaceuticals. Women who were 
pregnant or nursing were excluded. Prior radiation to bone was permitted if completed by 
the time of randomization and at least 1 site of bone involvement had not been irradiated.
Trial Design and Treatment
This was a noninferiority trial with patient stratification by cancer type, baseline serum 
creatinine level, prior skeletal-related events, and prior use of oral bisphosphonates. The 
CALGB registrar assigned patients to receive zoledronic acid every4weeks or every 
12weeks for 2 years at a 1:1 ratio using a stratified permuted block randomization scheme10 
that was performed on a central computer. Allocations were concealed until patients were 
registered and enrolled. Commercially available zoledronic acid was intravenously 
administered for a duration of 15 minutes or longer. Each zoledronic acid dose was adjusted 
for calculated creatinine clearance using actual body weight. Patients were instructed to take 
approximately500mg of elemental calcium and 400 IU to 800 IU of vitamin D per day. 
Adverse events and toxic effects were graded using version 3.0 of the Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events.11 Protocol treatment was discontinued in patients with grade 3 
or 4 hypersensitivity, creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min, or development of 
osteonecrosis of the jaw.
Patients who agreed to participate in the C-terminal telopeptide companion study were 
accrued sequentially as they enrolled in the primary study. At baseline and at 12-week 
intervals for 2 years, 10 mL of peripheral venous blood was collected from each participant. 
Serum was separated and refrigerated immediately. Serum samples were submitted to a 
central repository where they were stored at −70°C until analysis. C-terminal telopeptide

 levels were assayed using the Serum Crosslaps enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit 
(Immunodiagnostics Systems Holding PLC).
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the proportion of patients having at least 1 skeletal-related event 
within 2 years after randomization. The end point for skeletal-related events was defined as 
clinical fracture, spinal cord compression, radiation to bone, and surgery involving bone. 
Clinical fractures were defined as those identified during the evaluation of symptomatic 
patients and confirmed by written report of radiographic testing. Fractures identified 
incidentally or involving the hands, feet, face, or skull were not included. Spinal cord 
compression, manifesting as neurological impairment, back pain, or both, required 
radiographic confirmation. Radiation to bone was defined as radiation to palliate a painful 
bone lesion, radiation to treat or prevent fractures, radiation to treat or prevent spinal cord 
compression, or the use of bone-targeted radio pharmaceuticals. Surgery involving bone was 
defined as surgical procedures to prevent imminent fractures or to treat pathological 
fractures or spinal cord compression.
Prespecified secondary end points included (1) the proportion of patients having at least 1 
skeletal-related event within 2 years after randomization for the subgroups of patients with 
breast cancer, prostate cancer, and multiple myeloma; (2) pain as assessed by the Brief Pain 
Inventory (scores ranged from 0 [no pain] to 10 [pain as bad as you can imagine])12; (3) 
ECOG performance status (scores ranged from 0 [fully active] to 4 [completely disabled]); 
and (4) incidences of osteonecrosis of the jaw and kidney dysfunction using version 3.0 of 
the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events criteria (and defined as grade 1, 
serum creatinine levels greater than the upper limit of normal to 1.5 times the upper limit of 
normal; grade 2, serum creatinine levels >1.5–3.0 times the upper limit of normal; grade 3, 
serum creatinine levels >3.0–6.0 times the upper limit of normal; grade 4, serum creatinine 
levels >6 times the upper limit of normal). The skeletal morbidity rate was assessed and 
defined as the mean number of skeletal-related events per year. Suppression of the bone 
turnover marker C-terminal telopeptide was measured in a subset of patients. Additional 
prespecified secondary outcomes from the companion pharmacogenetic and cost-
effectiveness studies will be reported elsewhere.
End points were not modified during the course of the study and outcome assessments were 
not blinded. Skeletal related event forms detailing if and when a clinical fracture, spinal cord 
compression, radiation to bone, or surgery involving bone had occurred were collected every 
4 weeks for all patients. Imaging reports documenting skeletal-related events, Brief Pain 
Inventory scores, ECOG performance status scores, serum creatinine levels, calculated 
creatinine clearance, and adverse event data were also collected at 4-week intervals for all 
patients. The zoledronic acid dose was obtained following administration of each treatment. 
Trial participants were queried about dental problems, visits, and procedures they had within 
the past 1 month to 12 months; the information was recorded in a monthly case report form. 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw was documented by reports from patients’ dentists.

 Statistical Methods
Noninferiority Margin—Based on published rates of skeletal-related events among 
patients treated with zoledronic acid, the noninferiority margin was prespecified at a 7% 
absolute difference. Specifically, 4 previous studies1,2,13,14 comparing zoledronic acid with 
placebo reported absolute differences (in favor of zoledronic acid) ranging from 5.7% to 
37.0% for the percentages of skeletal-related events. All observed differences of 9% or 
greater were significant at the .05 level, whereas differences below 6% were not. Statistical 
significance does not inherently indicate clinical importance. However, based on these study 
results and the experience of the clinicians who developed the protocol, there was a 
consensus that 7% was a reasonable and clinically meaningful noninferiority margin.
Sample Size Determination—The target accrual was 1538 patients in the original study 
protocol, which was selected under an assumption that approximately 20% of patients would 
drop out, resulting in 1230 evaluable patients. However, after more than 20% of patients 
were noted during an interim analysis to have dropped out, the assumed dropout rate was 
increased to 30%, and thus the target accrual was increased from 1538 to 1758 patients to 
yield 1230 evaluable patients. With 1230 patients remaining after an anticipated 30% 
dropout rate, the power to reject a null hypothesis of inferiority using a 1-sided test at a .05 
significance level was estimated to be 82% under the alternative hypothesis that the rates for 
skeletal-related events were equal in the 2 treatment groups. The null hypothesis was that 
zoledronic acid administered every 12 weeks was inferior to zoledronic acid administered 
every 4 weeks. Therefore, a 1-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel15 P ≤ .05 was required to 
demonstrate noninferiority for the primary analysis.
Analytic Plan
Prespecified Analyses of the Primary Outcome—To determine whether zoledronic 
acid administered every 12 weeks was noninferior to zoledronic acid administered every 4 
weeks, a stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used to compare the proportion of 
patients with at least 1 skeletal-related event at 2 years between the 2 treatment groups. 
Stratification factors were cancer type (breast, prostate, or multiple myeloma), baseline 
serum creatinine level (≤1.4 mg/dL or >1.4 mg/dL), prior skeletal-related events (yes or no), 
and prior use of oral bisphosphonates (yes or no). Following the intent-to-treat (ITT) 
principle, all randomized patients were included in this analysis. Per the study protocol, the 
analyses were performed by assuming that among patients with less than 2 years of follow-
up, those without at least 1 skeletal-related event at the time of dropout had (ITT analysis) or 
did not have (sensitivity analysis) at least 1 skeletal-related event.
The 2-year rates for skeletal-related events were also compared across treatment groups 
using a logistic regression model and a binary (logit link) mixed-effects model that included 
a random, study site–specific intercept to account for potential clustering within site. Both 
models included main effects for disease type, prior use of oral bisphosphonates, prior 
skeletal related events, and baseline serum creatinine level.
Prespecified Analyses of Secondary Outcomes—To assess disease-specific 
treatment differences, the stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was reimplemented 
Himelstein et al.

 within each of the 3 disease groups. Changes over time from baseline in the Brief Pain 
Inventory composite score were compared using a linear mixed-effects model16 adjusted for 
disease type, baseline creatinine level, prior skeletal-related events, prior use of oral 
bisphosphonates, age, sex, body surface area, and race. The ECOG performance status score 
was compared using a linear mixed-effects model adjusted for disease type, baseline 
creatinine level, prior skeletal related events, prior use of oral bisphosphonates, age, sex, 
body surface area, race, and baseline ECOG performance status score.
Both the Brief Pain Inventory and the ECOG performance status models included a time × 
treatment interaction term and a random patient-specific time slope. The incidences of 
osteonecrosis of the jaw and kidney dysfunction were compared between the 2 treatment 
groups using the Cochran- Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by cancer type, baseline serum 
creatinine level, prior skeletal-related events, and prior use of oral bisphosphonates. The 
skeletal morbidity rate was defined as the mean number of skeletal-related events per year 
and was estimated for each treatment group. The median observed skeletal morbidity rate 
and the interquartile range (IQR) were determined for each group.
To help reduce the risk of false-positive findings, a 2-sided significance level of .001 was 
used for all secondary outcome analyses. All secondary analyses were performed to assess 
differences between groups rather than noninferiority.
Post Hoc and Exploratory Analyses—To determine whether the incidence curves for 
skeletal related events were equal, a Wald test with a 2-sided alternative was used. A Wald 
95%CI was calculated for the hazard ratio specific for skeletal-related events. A Kruskal-
Wallis test was used to compare the distribution of skeletal-related events by disease type.
To compare incidence trajectories for skeletal-related events, the cumulative incidences for 
skeletal-related events were estimated over 2 years for both treatment groups using response 
data as observed (patients were censored at the time of dropout and assumed not to have had 
at least 1 skeletal related event unless 1 event was observed during the study). This was 
performed using a Cox proportional hazards model, in which death was treated as a 
competing risk. This model included treatment group, age, body surface area, disease type, 
performance status, prior skeletal-related events, prior use of oral bisphosphonates, baseline 
serum creatinine level, and race as predictors.
Because a higher dropout rate might bias results toward noninferiority, an additional 
sensitivity analysis (commonly referred to as a tipping point analysis) was performed.17,18 
Specifically, the assumption was made that 29.5%(the observed rate for skeletal-related 
events in the every 4-week dosing group, which would also be the expected rate among 
dropouts in the 4-week group) of dropouts in both treatment groups who did not experience 
at least 1 skeletal-related event would have experienced at least 1 skeletal-related event if 
they had remained in the study until 2 years after randomization. The groups were compared 
by a noninferiority test and the P value for noninferiority was calculated.
The assumed rate for skeletal-related events was then slowly increased among dropouts in 
the every 12-week dosing group (while holding the rate for skeletal-related events in the

 every 4-week dosing group fixed at 29.5%), each time rerunning the Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel test and noting the P value until the significant (at the .05 level) noninferiority 
result was no longer significant (ie, until the null hypothesis that the every 12-week dosing 
group was inferior to the every 4-week dosing group at the .05 significance level was no 
longer able to be rejected). This was performed using a stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
testandanunadjusted2-sample test of proportions.
In addition to the evaluation of kidney dysfunction using version 3.0 of the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events criteria, an additional analysis of kidney 
dysfunction was performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by cancer 
type, baseline serum creatinine level, prior skeletal- related events, and prior use of oral 
bisphosphonates. For this analysis, kidney dysfunction was defined (as in previous 
reports1,2,5,13,14) as an increase in serum creatinine level of 0.5mg/dL or greater if the 
baseline level was 1.4mg/dL or less, or an increase in serum creatinine level of 1mg/dL or 
greater if the baseline level was greater than 1.4mg/dL.
For patients in the companion C-terminal telopeptide study, a linear mixed-effects model 
was used to compare C-terminal telopeptide levels over time between the 2 treatment 
groups. Variables included in this model were treatment, linear time, quadratic time 
(time^2), and a linear time × treatment interaction term. In addition, this model allowed for 
random, patient-specific intercepts and linear time slopes.
The distribution of the cumulative dose of zoledronic acid was compared across the 2 study 
groups using a Kruskal- Wallis test. Treatment delays were compared using the χ2 test. The 
incidence of hypocalcemia was compared between the 2 treatment groups using the 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by cancer type, baseline serum creatinine level, 
prior skeletal-related events, and prior use of oral bisphosphonates.
Interim Analyses—Five interim analyses were performed at 6-month intervals from 
November 2012 until November 2014. A 1-sided Fisher exact test at significance levels of P 
= .15, P = .15, P = .20, P = .20, and P = .25 for the first through fifth interim analyses, 
respectively, was conducted for futility, and a Cochran- Mantel-Haenszel test was performed 
for noninferiority. Significance levels for the interim noninferiority tests were determined 
based on the Haybittle-Peto method, and thus for each interim noninferiority test, the 
significance level was set at .001. In addition, because of differential dropout early in the 
trial (which eventually became more balanced), time-to-event analyses (Kaplan-Meier) for 
the last 3 interim analyses also were conducted to compare the 2 treatment groups (log-rank 
test).
The Alliance Statistics and Data Center conducted data collection and statistical analyses. 
Data quality was ensured by review of the data by the Alliance Statistics and Data Center 
and by the study chairperson following Alliance policies. The Alliance data and safety 
monitoring board reviewed the results of each interim analysis at each of its semiannual 
meetings, including the primary and secondary end points. All analyses were based on the 
study database, which was frozen on December 8, 2014. Statistical analyses were performed

Results
Baseline Patient Characteristics
Between May 2009 and April 2012, 1822 patients were enrolled in the study with 911 
randomized to receive zoledronic acid every 4 weeks and 911 randomized to receive 
zoledronic acid every 12 weeks (equal sample size being a result of permuted block 
randomization); follow-up concluded in April 2014. The baseline characteristics of the 
patients by treatment group appear in Table 1. Among 1822 patients who were randomized 
(median age, 65 years; 980 [53.8%] women; 855 with breast cancer,689with prostate cancer, 
and 278 with multiple myeloma), 795 completed the study at 2 years. A total of 553 patients 
were enrolled in the companion C-terminal telopeptide study. These patients were similar to 
the entire trial population by baseline characteristics (eTable 1 in Supplement 2). Because of 
administrative stopping point errors, enrollments for the primary and C-terminal telopeptide 
studies exceeded target accruals by 64 and 357 patients, respectively. All available samples 
were assayed.
Primary Outcomes
All 1822 patients were included in the ITT and sensitivity analyses (Figure 1). The most 
common reasons for dropping out of the trial in both groups were withdrawal or refusal, 
disease progression, and death; however, neither disease progression nor death were 
specified in the protocol as reasons to stop participation in the study. The median length of 
patient follow-up was 425 days (1.2 years).
A complete breakdown of the observed outcome data for skeletal-related events by study 
group, disease type, and dropout status appears in Table 2. Two hundred sixty patients 
(29.5%) who received zoledronic acid every 4 weeks and 253 patients (28.6%)who received 
zoledronic acid every 12weeks experienced at least 1 skeletal-related event within 2 years of 
study randomization. The type of skeletal-related event was due to radiation to bone in 185 
patients in the zoledronic acid every 4-week dosing group and in 163 patients in the 
zoledronic acid every 12-week dosing group; clinical fractures, 62 and 79 patients, 
respectively; spinal cord compression, 23 and 30 patients; and surgery involving bone, 22 
and 42 patients (eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
The stratified ITT Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test to compare these proportions under the 
assumption that dropouts (those individuals who did not complete 2 years of treatment) 
experienced at least 1 skeletal-related event indicated that zoledronic acid administered 
every 12 weeks was noninferior with regard to skeletal-related events (risk difference, −0.3% 
[1-sided 95% CI, −4% to ∞]; P < .001 for noninferiority). The prespecified sensitivity 
analysis, using the assumption that dropouts without at least 1 skeletal-related event at the 
time of dropout did not have at least 1 skeletal-related event, also demonstrated 
noninferiority (risk difference, 1.0% [1-sided 95% CI, −3% to ∞]; Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel P < .001) (Table 2).

week group was −4%to ∞. The lower bound of this interval was greater than the 
noninferiority margin of −7%, indicating that zoledronic acid administered every 12weeks 
was noninferior to zoledronic acid administered every 4 weeks.
The 2-year rate analyses for skeletal-related events from logistic regression and binary 
mixed-effects models were nearly identical, and were consistent with the primary analyses 
(no significant difference was found between the zoledronic acid 12-week dosing group and 
the 4-week dosing group). Specifically, under the assumption that dropouts experienced at 
least 1 skeletal-related event, the logistic regression model odds ratio (OR) for zoledronic 
acid administered every 12weeks vs every 4weeks was 1.02 (95%CI, 0.84–1.24; P = .85 for 
superiority) and the mixed-model OR was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.83–1.25; P = .88 for superiority). 
Using the assumption that dropouts without at least 1 skeletal-related event at the time of 
dropout did not have at least 1 skeletal-related event, the OR for both 
modelswas0.96(95%CI,0.78–1.17; superiority P = .68for zoledronic acid 12-week dosing 
group vs 4-week dosing group).
Secondary Outcomes
The probability of experiencing at least 1 skeletal-related event within 2 years of 
randomization was not significantly different between the zoledronic acid 4-week group and 
the 12-week group for patients with breast cancer (between-group difference, −0.02 
[99.9%CI, −0.13 to 0.09]; P = .50), prostate cancer (between-group difference,0.02 
[99.9%CI, −0.10to0.14]; P = .59), or multiplemyeloma (between-group difference,0.06 
[99.9%CI, −0.12 to 0.24]; P = .14) (Table 2). Prespecified sensitivity analyses performed 
within each disease group under the assumption that dropouts without at least 1 skeletal 
related event did not have at least 1 skeletal-related event showed no significant differences 
between the 2 zoledronic acid treatment groups (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel P = .58 for 
breast cancer, P = .58 for prostate cancer, and P = .35 for multiplemyeloma).
No significant differences between the zoledronic acid every 4-week group and the every 12-
week group were seen in the mean pain scores at any individual time point (Cochran- 
Mantel-Haenszel P > .001at all time points for mean worst pain within the past 24 hours, 
mean least pain within the past 24 hours, mean average pain, mean current pain, composite 
pain [mean of the 4 pain items: worst, least, average, and current], mean relief from pain 
with treatments or medications, and mean interference score). In addition, trajectories of the 
mean pain scores were not found to differ significantly between the 2 groups (time × 
treatment interaction P = .96 for mean worst pain within the past24hours;P = .
38formeanleast pain within the past 24 hours; P = .75 for mean average pain; P = .82 for 
mean current pain; P = .88 for mean composite pain; P = .59 for mean relief from pain with 
treatments or medications; and P = .68 for mean interference score). No significant 
differences in ECOG performance status over time were seen (P = .64 for time × treatment 
interaction) or at each time point (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel P > .001for all26time points) 
(eFigures 1–8 in Supplement 2).

 Osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred in 18 patients (2.0%) in the zoledronic acid every 4-week 
group and 9 patients (1.0%) in the every 12-week group (2-sided Cochran-Mantel- Haenszel 
P = .08). Kidney dysfunction, defined as grade 3 or 4 increased creatinine levels, occurred in 
10 patients (1.2%) receiving zoledronic acid every 4 weeks and 4 patients (0.5%) receiving 
zoledronic acid every 12 weeks (2-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel P = .10). The mean 
number of skeletal-related events per year (skeletal morbidity rate) was 0.4 (median, 0 [IQR, 
0–0.5]) for the zoledronic acid every 4-week group and 0.4 (median, 0 [IQR, 0–0.5]) for the 
zoledronic acid every 12-week group.
Among the 9 covariates included in these analytic models (disease type, baseline creatinine 
level, prior skeletal related events, prior use of oral bisphosphonates, age, sex, body surface 
area, race, and baseline ECOG performance status), only baseline ECOG performance status 
had any missing data for 48 patients (2.6%).
Post Hoc and Exploratory Analyses
The cumulative incidence of skeletal-related events for both treatment groups appears in 
Figure 2. A total of 56 randomized patients were excluded because they dropped out 
immediately, and thus did not have any evaluations for skeletal related events (so their time 
to at least 1 skeletal-related event was missing). These curves were similar and were not 
found to differ significantly, suggesting that throughout the course of the study, skeletal-
related events occurred at a similar rate in both groups (hazard ratio for skeletal-related 
events, 0.96 [Wald 95% CI, 0.81–1.15];Wald P = .67 for zoledronic acid every 12-week 
group vs every 4-week group).
In the additional sensitivity (tipping point) analyses, the necessary increase in the rate of the 
skeletal-related events among dropouts (relative to the assumed rate of 29.5%in the 
zoledronic acid every 4-week dosing group) in the zoledronic acid every 12-week dosing 
group was found to be 10.2%vs9.2% for the every 4-week group. These results suggested 
that the rate of skeletal-related events among dropouts in the every 12-week dosing group 
would have to be approximately 31%to 35% higher (depending on which test was used) than 
that among dropouts in the every 4-week dosing group for the significant noninferiority 
result to become nonsignificant.
Of the patients receiving zoledronic acid every 4 weeks, 174 (19.9%) experienced a 
significant creatinine level increase of 0.5mg/dL or greater with a baseline creatinine level of 
1.4mg/dL or less and an increase of 1mg/dL or greater with a baseline creatinine level of 
greater than 1.4 mg/dL. For patients receiving zoledronic acid every 12weeks, 137 
(15.5%)had a significant creatinine level increase of 0.5mg/dL or greater with a baseline 
creatinine level of 1.4mg/dL or less and an increase of 1mg/dL or greater with a baseline 
creatinine level of greater than 1.4 mg/dL (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel P = .02) (Table 3).
For the analysis of C-terminal telopeptide (the bone turnover marker), 2530 samples were 
tested from553 patients, 284 (51%)in the zoledronic acid every 4-week group and 269 (49%) 
in the every 12-week group. The mean C-terminal telopeptide levels (with 95% CI) are 
displayed graphically over time for each treatment group in Figure 3. This Figure is meant to 
be descriptive, and involves no statistical test; however, observed C-terminal telopeptide

 levels were higher at each time point among patients receiving zoledronic acid every 
12weeks. Similar results were seen in the longitudinal C-terminal telopeptide model, which 
found C-terminal telopeptide levels to be significantly lower in the zoledronic acid every4-
week group than in the every 12-week group (P = .05). In addition, the linear time × 
treatment interaction in this model was not significant (P = .14), suggesting that the C-
terminal telopeptide trajectories for the 2 treatment groups were parallel with the zoledronic 
acid every 4-week group always lower than the every 12-week group.
Patients randomized to the zoledronic acid every 4-week group received a mean cumulative 
dose 2.5 times that of patients in the every 12-week group (mean [SD], 54.7 mg [33.6 mg] 
vs 21.6mg [12.4mg]; Kruskal-Wallis P < .001). Treatment delays were found to be more 
common among patients taking zoledronic acid every 4 weeks (62% vs 37% for the every 
12-week group; 2-sided χ2 P < .001).
Any grade of hypocalcemia was reported in 329 patients (38%) in the zoledronic acid every 
4-week group and in 298 patients (35%) in the every 12-week group (2-sided χ2 P = .25). 
Grade4hypocalcemia (<6mg/dL) occurred in8patients (0.9%) in the zoledronic acid every 4-
week group and in 5 patients (0.6%) in the every 12-week group (2-sided χ2 P = .61).
Interim Analyses
In each of the interim analyses, the Fisher exact P values (for futility) were above the futility 
significance level (ie, the criteria for stopping the trial early for futility were not met), and 
the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel noninferiority P values were above the early stopping 
threshold of .001 (ie, the criteria for stopping the trial early for noninferiority were not met). 
In the last 3 interim analyses, the log-rank P-values were .42 or higher (ie, not meeting the 
early stopping threshold); thus, it could not be concluded that the hazard ratio for skeletal-
related events was different from1.
Discussion
In this randomized clinical trial involving patients with bone metastases due to breast cancer, 
prostate cancer, or multiple myeloma, zoledronic acid administered every 12 weeks was 
noninferior to zoledronic acid administered every 4weeks for reducing the occurrence of 
skeletal events. The proportion of patients experiencing at least 1 skeletal-related event 
within 2 years of randomization was not significantly different for the zoledronic acid every 
12-week dose group compared with the every 4-week dose group within each disease type.
The rates of skeletal-related events (29.5% for the zoledronic acid every 4-week dosing 
group and 28.6% for the every 12-week dosing group) observed in this study were fairly 
consistent with previously reported rates of skeletal-related events, which ranged between 
29.8% and 38.5%1,2,13,14; however, the duration of treatment with zoledronic acid was less 
than 2 years in these previous studies, ranging from 9 months to 15 months. Although some 
previous studies were too short to allow for calculation of median time to first skeletal 
related event,1,2,14 the 2-year treatment duration of this study allowed estimation of the 
median times to first skeletal related event or death (treated as a competing risk), which were

 15.7 months in the zoledronic acid every 4-week dosing group and 16.8 months in the every 
12-week dosing group (Figure 2).
Adherence to the treatment schedule was better among patients who received zoledronic 
acid every 12 weeks (63% had no treatment delays) compared with patients who received 
zoledronic acid every 4 weeks (38% had no treatment delays) (eTable 3 in Supplement 2). 
Bone turnover as measured by changes in C-terminal telopeptide levels was suppressed to a 
lesser degree when zoledronic acid was administered every 12 weeks, although this 
difference most likely was not clinically significant because incidence of skeletal-related 
events for the 12-week group was noninferior to that in the 4-week group, and the secondary 
end points between the 2 treatment groups were not statistically significantly different.
Despite receiving a lower cumulative dose of zoledronic acid, patients treated every 12 
weeks had similar rates of toxic effects compared with those treated every 4 weeks, although 
osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred in 2.0% of patients in the 4-week group vs 1.0% in the 12-
week group (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel P = .08). The incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw 
was lower than the incidence reported in earlier studies of zoledronic acid (7.7%),4 possibly 
reflecting the shorter duration of treatment in this study (24 months vs 37–48 months), 
greater awareness of this complication among oncologists and dentists, and the practice of 
sending patients for dental treatment and clearance prior to initiating bisphosphonate 
therapy. The occurrence of kidney dysfunction as measured by an increase in creatinine 
levels over baseline was higher in the zoledronic acid every 4-week group (19.9%) than the 
occurrence reported in other studies of zoledronic acid (11%–17%),1,2,5,13,14 perhaps 
because zoledronic acid doses were administered even if creatinine levels had not decreased 
to levels within 10% of baseline.
This study had several strengths. First, in addition to enrolling patients with metastatic breast 
cancer, patients with metastatic prostate cancer and with multiple myeloma were also 
included, broadening the applicability of the results to these populations. Second, 
randomization started with the first dose of zoledronic acid without the wash-in period of 
monthly zoledronic acid used in prior dosing-interval studies. Third, more than 800 patients 
with metastatic breast cancer were enrolled in this study, which is more than twice the 
number of patients enrolled in previous dosing-interval trials. Fourth, this was a cooperative 
group trial involving 269 academic and community centers, whereas the prior dosing-
interval studies were each supported and funded by industry.
This study also has several limitations. First, the percentage of patients who did not 
complete 2 years of treatment was higher than the expected 30%, in part because of patient 
withdrawal. Even though 40% of patients dropped out without experiencing at least 1 
skeletal-related event, the findings from the ITT analysis and the sensitivity analyses were 
consistent: zoledronic acid administered every 12 weeks was noninferior to zoledronic acid 
administered every 4 weeks. Second, the study was open-label, which could potentially bias 
reporting of skeletal-related events and toxic effects and could affect patient and physician 
decision making regarding continued study participation if the patient experienced a 
skeletal-related event. Sham infusions administered during the off months in the zoledronic 
acid every 12-week dosing group would have addressed these issues, but there was concern 
Himelstein et al.

 that accrual would be hindered if sham infusions were included, and funding was not 
available for placebo infusions or central review. Third, the noninferiority design as opposed 
to a superiority design could be considered a limitation; however, noninferiority trials are 
well accepted and this design was ideally suited to test the trial hypothesis. Fourth, the study 
did not address survival or the risks and benefits of administering zoledronic acid for more 
than 2 years.
Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody, was approved by the US Food and Drug 
Administration for treatment of bone metastases from solid tumors (but not multiple 
myeloma) in November 2010,19 about 1 ½ years after our study opened. In a study 
examining the use of this drug for the prevention of skeletal-related events in 2862 patients 
with breast cancer, prostate cancer, other solid tumors, or multiple myeloma, Lipton et al20 
reported the median time to first skeletal related event was 27.7 months for denosumab 
administered every 4 weeks vs 19.5 months for zoledronic acid administered every 4 weeks 
and 934 first skeletal-related events. An expert opinion panel sponsored by the American 
Society of Clinical Oncology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Center Network, 
based on a review of the available evidence, did not recommend denosumab over zoledronic 
acid.21 A study comparing denosumab administered every 4 weeks vs every 12 weeks in 
patients with metastatic breast cancer and metastatic prostate cancer is currently under way 
in Switzerland with an expected completion date of 2022.22
Conclusions
Among patients with bone metastases due to breast cancer, prostate cancer, or multiple 
myeloma, the use of zoledronic acid every 12 weeks compared with the standard dosing 
interval of every 4 weeks did not result in an increased risk of skeletal events over 2 years. 
This longer interval may be an acceptable treatment option.
