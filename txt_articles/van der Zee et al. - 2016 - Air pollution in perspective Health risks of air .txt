Background: Although the health effects of long term exposure to air pollution are well established, it is
difficult to effectively communicate the health risks of this (largely invisible) risk factor to the public and
policy makers. The purpose of this study is to develop a method that expresses the health effects of air
pollution in an equivalent number of daily passively smoked cigarettes.
Methods: Defined changes in PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and Black Carbon (BC) concentration were
expressed into number of passively smoked cigarettes, based on equivalent health risks for four outcome
measures: Low Birth Weight (o2500 g at term), decreased lung function (FEV1), cardiovascular mor-
tality and lung cancer. To describe the strength of the relationship with ETS and air pollutants, we
summarized the epidemiological literature using published or new meta-analyses.
Results: Realistic increments of 10 mg/m3 in PM2.5 and NO2 concentration and a 1 mg/m3 increment in BC
concentration correspond to on average (standard error in parentheses) 5.5 (1.6), 2.5 (0.6) and 4.0 (1.2)
passively smoked cigarettes per day across the four health endpoints, respectively. The uncertainty re-
flects differences in equivalence between the health endpoints and uncertainty in the concentration
response functions. The health risk of living along a major freeway in Amsterdam is, compared to a
counterfactual situation with ‘clean’ air, equivalent to 10 daily passively smoked cigarettes..
Conclusions: We developed a method that expresses the health risks of air pollution and the health
benefits of better air quality in a simple, appealing manner. The method can be used both at the national/
regional and the local level. Evaluation of the usefulness of the method as a communication tool is
needed.

1. Introduction
Numerous studies have documented the adverse health effects of
air pollution, even at levels well below the EU limit values (HEI,
2010; WHO, 2013; Beelen et al., 2015). In order to meet the European
Union limit values, national and local authorities have to take action
and attempt to reduce the emissions from mobile, domestic, agri-
cultural and industrial sources. Because health effects of air pollution
also occur below air quality limits, improvement of population
health is an argument for further air pollution reduction policies. At
the local level, policy measures are being implemented like con-
gestion charges, low emission zones, increased parking rates. Policy
makers need to “sell” the (often) expensive and restrictive measures
to the public and create enough political support to implement them.
Insight in the health impact of local air quality enhances acceptance
and adoption of preventive measures (Briggs and Stern, 2007). This
requires effective communication with the public about the health
risks of local air pollution and the health benefits of improved air
quality. However, it is difficult for local policy makers and health
professionals to effectively communicate about the health risk of air
pollution (Slovic, 1999; Weber, 2006; Bickerstaff and Walker, 2001).
One way to express health risks of local sources is by means of
a risk quotient (relative risk or odds ratio) but this does not ne-
cessarily reflect perception of risks in a population, since percep-
tion is only partly based on scientific information (Slovic, 1999;
Weber, 2006, Stewart et al., 2010). Alternatively, excess mortality

 risks resulting from exposure to local air pollution can be trans-
lated into years of life lost (Brunekreef et al., 2007) or risk-ad-
vancement period (Brenner et al., 1993), where years of life lost
(YLL) are extrapolated into ‘real age’. In a recent study, Geelen et al.
(2013) reported that ‘real age’ of an individual increased with up to
36 days near the highway in the Moerdijk area in the Netherlands,
compared to the background concentration. The impact of the
implementation of a low emission zone in Rome was expressed as
the gain in life expectancy: 921 years per 100.000 inhabitants, on
average 3.4 days per person (Cesaroni et al., 2012). Modeled
benefits of the London congestion charging zone was 183 years of
life per 100.000 (0.7 days per person) inhabitants in the charging
zone wards (Tonne et al., 2008). The effectiveness of commu-
nicating risk advancement periods, or years of life lost or gained
due to air pollution to the public and policy is generally not
evaluated. Yet, effective communication is important for the above
mentioned reasons.
In a previous Dutch study, the impact of local traffic on Black
Carbon (BC) concentration was translated into YLL based on the
relation between BC exposure and life expectancy described by
Janssen et al. (2011) and presented graphically at building-level for
all major roads in the densely populated provinces North- and
South-Holland (van der Sluis et al., 2012). The usefulness of this
information for local policy makers and governors was evaluated
in interviews. They were insufficiently able to interpret the effect
on YLL and were unanimous in their wish for a simple, appealing
comparison of the health risks of local air pollution with other,
well-known risk factors. Risk factors that were mentioned were:
passive or active smoking; obesity; unhealthy diet; traffic acci-
dents (van der Sluis et al., 2012). Recently, Kelly and Fussell (2015)
stressed that in order to increase public awareness, communica-
tion about the health risks of air pollution should be blatant and
put in the context of other public health risks such as passive
smoking. The principle of risk comparison for better communica-
tion of risk to the public was used earlier, for example in the Global
Burden of Disease project, where the risks of a large number of
risk factors including outdoor air pollution and passive smoking
have been compared globally and for various regions of the world
(Lim et al., 2012; Forouzanfar et al., 2015).
Pope et al. (2009) and Smith and Peel (2010) used the inhaled
dose of PM2.5 from active smoking, household air pollution (in-
door biomass and coal burning), passive smoking and outdoor air
pollution to compare deaths due to cardiovascular disease. Due to
the non-linear shape of the exposure-response relationship, much
larger health benefits may occur at the lower end of the dose
spectrum (Smith and Peel, 2010). The inhaled dose of PM2.5 is
more than 300 fold higher for the average smoker than for the
average passive smoker (Pope et al., 2009; Öberg et al., 2010).
Inhaled PM2.5 doses for outdoor air pollution and passive smoking
are comparable. As a consequence, the health effects of outdoor air
pollution can more meaningfully be compared with those of pas-
sive smoking than of active smoking.
The aim of this study is to express the health effects of air
pollution in equivalent amounts of passive smoking. We compared
health risks of air pollution with passive smoking because both
risk factors are comparable with respect to the exposure route
(inhalation); have similar health effects both resulting from a
complex mixture of particles and gases; and exposure to both air
pollution and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is largely
involuntary.
A simple tool is developed based on the relative risks describ-
ing the association between exposure to ETS and three key air
pollutants:
particulate
matter
with
aerodynamic
diameters
o2.5 mm (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and Black Carbon (BC)
and four health outcomes (Low Birth Weight, lung function de-
crements in children, cardiovascular mortality and lung cancer).
We illustrate the method by expressing the health effects of
living near a freeway, the health gain of a local traffic measure and
the health effects of the emissions of a steel factory into equivalent
amounts of exposure to ETS.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Selection of health outcomes
First, we searched the air pollution epidemiology literature for
health outcomes with the most secure evidence of an association
with PM2.5, NO2 and Black Carbon (BC). PM2.5 is the preferred air
pollution indicator for health impact assessment at the national or
regional level. NO2 and BC are the preferred air pollution in-
dicators
for
health
impact
assessment
at
the
local
level,
in situations where traffic is the primary source of air pollution.
We made use of published (systematic) reviews, supplemented
with more recent key studies.
Second, we searched the passive smoking epidemiology lit-
erature to select health outcomes with the most secure evidence
of an association with ETS exposure. We made use of WHO and
Surgeon General Reports and published (systematic) reviews.
Next, we selected health outcomes with the most secure evi-
dence of an association for both the relation with ETS exposure
and air pollution. We further aimed at including health outcomes
reflecting adult and childhood health responses to evaluate dif-
ferences in the ratio of air pollution and ETS health effects. We
finally included four health outcomes:
1. Low Birth Weight (LBW) defined as a birth weight less than
2500 g after 37 weeks of gestation.
2. Lung function (FEV1) in school aged children.
3. Lung cancer.
4. Cardiovascular mortality.
2.2. Exposure-response functions for the relation between ETS ex-
posure and health outcomes
Continuous data on ETS exposure (number of cigarettes) is
rarely available in epidemiological studies. Some epidemiological
studies have a more quantified assessment of ETS exposure, often
classified into “low or moderate ETS exposure” or “moderate to
high exposure”. However, the cut-off points for the different ex-
posure categories differ between studies. Therefore, meta-analyses
such as the WHO's Global Burden of disease related to ETS (Öberg
et al., 2010) provide estimates based on dichotomous exposure
classification (presence / absence of ETS in the home or at work).
Table 1 provides an overview of the risk estimates for ETS ex-
posure for the selected health outcomes.
2.3. Assessment of ETS exposure
The risk estimates in Table 1 are based on dichotomous ex-
posure classification. However, an estimate of the average daily
residential exposure to ETS is essential to express air pollution
health effects in an equivalent amount of cigarettes smoked. Based
on estimates from the WHO for smokers in the US and North-West
Europe, we assume an average of 14 daily cigarettes (Öberg et al.,
2010).
The average daily residential exposure was estimated following
a (modified) approach by Nazaroff and Singer (2004). This is based
on the assumption that the average smoker consumes half of their
daily cigarettes indoors at home, which follows from an expecta-
tion that habitual smokers will consume cigarettes at a roughly
uniform rate throughout the hours that they are awake. People in
S.C. van der Zee et al. / Environmental Research 148 (2016) 475–483

 developed countries spend approximately 65% of their time in-
doors at home (Leech et al., 2002; Brasche and Bischof, 2005)
which, allowing for 8 h sleep per night, implies that about half of
the daily awake hours are spent indoors at home.
Therefore, the daily average indoor cigarette exposure is esti-
mated as:

=

7 passively smoked cigarettes/day
This estimate is used to represent ETS exposure in relation to
risk of cardiovascular mortality, lung cancer and Low Birth Weight
for infants of non-smoking mothers.
Children who are exposed to parental smoking can have one or
two smoking parents. Information about the number of smoking
parents in the household is scarce. Based on a large national sur-
vey in England it was estimated that among parents who smoked
in two parent households, 35% lived with an adult who also
smoked (Belvin et al., 2015). In a smaller survey in the Netherlands
32% of children exposed to parental smoking reported that both
parents smoke (Schuck et al., 2013). We assume that 32% of chil-
dren, exposed to parental smoking have two smoking parents.
Consequently, the average indoor cigarette exposure for chil-
dren exposed to parental ETS in relation to lung function decre-
ments (FEV1) is estimated as:
=

×
=

1.32
9 passively smoked cigarettes/day
where 1.32 represents the average number of smoking parents for
children exposed to parental smoking.
Furthermore, the assumption is that the relation between the
number of passively smoked cigarettes smoked and health out-
comes is linear.
2.4. Concentration response functions for the relation between air
pollution and health outcomes
Concentration response functions (CRFs) describing the strength
of the association between a defined change in air pollution con-
centration and health outcomes were derived from recent reviews. If
recent key studies were published but meta-analyses were lacking,
new meta-analyses were performed for the present study (described
in the Supplemental material). Faustini et al. (2014) provides Re-
lative Risks (RRs) for the association between NO2 and PM2.5 and
cardiovascular mortality. For BC the association with cardio-re-
spiratory mortality is established in meta-analyses (Smith et al.,
2009). Since cardiovascular deaths are the large majority of cardio-
respiratory deaths, we used the Relative Risks reported for cardio-
respiratory mortality for cardiovascular mortality.
Table 2 presents an overview of the risk estimates and the as-
sociated 95% confidence intervals for the four health outcomes.
2.5. Comparison of health risks
2.5.1. Comparison of risk estimates
The comparison is based upon the risk estimates reported in
Tables 1 and 2. First, for each combination of component and
health outcome the regression coefficient (βairpol) per 1 mg/m3 was
calculated. For the dichotomous health outcomes, this was calcu-
lated from the RR and the corresponding change in concentra-
tions:

Endpoints with more precisely established health effects are
weighed more. The uncertainty in the estimation of the weighted
average passive cigarette-equivalence was calculated as the in-
verse of the square root of the sum of the weights (DerSimonian
and Laird, 1986). If more than one pollutant is evaluated, the
pooled uncertainty was calculated in the same way.
2.6. Relevant pollutant(s) to be evaluated?
Depending on the situation and the source of air pollution,
PM2.5, BC and/or NO2 may be the most relevant air pollutants to
evaluate. For instance, a local traffic measure generally has a large
impact on NO2 and BC concentration but less impact on the PM2.5
concentration. In contrast, a steel factory affects local PM mass
concentrations much more than NO2 and/or Black Carbon con-
centrations. In each situation, the most affected pollutant(s) is the
most relevant pollutant to evaluate.
2.7. Sensitivity analyses
The estimated passive cigarette-equivalency highly depends on
the assumed number of daily passively smoked cigarettes indoors
at home. To illustrate the impact of the assumed number of daily
that a smokers smokes indoors at home on the passive cigarette-
equivalency, we performed sensitivity analyses with three alter-
native scenarios:
1. Assuming that smokers do not consume half of their daily ci-
garette consumption indoors at home, as suggested by Nazaroff
and Singer (2004) but only 25%.
2. Assuming a daily average of 18 smoked cigarettes, taking into
account that people tend to underestimate their cigarette con-
sumption in questionnaires, and based on tobacco sales rates in
the Netherlands (Nazaroff and Singer, 2004; Matt et al., 2004;
Forey et al., 2014).
3. Assuming that children are exposed to equal amounts of indoor
smoked cigarettes as adults.
3. Results
Table 3 expresses the health risks of exposure to PM2.5, NO2 and
BC into equivalent numbers of passively smoked cigarettes, including
its uncertainty. The estimates are presented for an increment of
10 mg/m3 in NO2 and PM2.5 concentration and 1 mg/m3 in BC con-
centration. These increments are commonly used to express relative
risks of these air pollutants. The meaning of these contrasts depends
on the setting to which the method is applied. Realistic examples will
be shown below.
Table 3 shows that the passive cigarette-equivalent estimates
per pollutant for the 4 different health outcomes vary within a
factor two to three for NO2 and PM2.5 and more for BC. Most es-
timates per pollutant agree reasonably when the uncertainty is
taken into account. The comparison between the three pollutants
depends on the selected increments and is more meaningfully
looked at in the examples below. The variability in passive cigar-
ette-equivalents is likely due to a combination of the wide range of
studies providing relative risks for different pollutants and differ-
ent health outcomes.
Exposure to air pollution is equivalent to a relative large
number of passive cigarette-equivalents in relation to lung func-
tion decrements, and a relatively small number of passive cigar-
ette-equivalents in relation to lung cancer. The uncertainty is re-
flecting the number of studies and consistency between studies,

 and is largest for lung function decrements. The weighted mean
estimates are somewhat lower than the arithmetic mean esti-
mates, since smaller estimates of passive cigarette-equivalents
tend to have smaller standard errors and consequently, contribute
more to the weight. The aim of this tool is to enable local policy
makers and health professionals to effectively communicate about
the health risk of air pollution. Therefore only arithmetic mean
estimates are presented in the examples below, which are more
easy-to-understand to the public than weighted mean estimates.
This is supported by the idea that the full uncertainty is broader
than the statistical uncertainty expressed in the standard error.
The Excel sheet used for the calculations is available in the
online supplement. The results of the comparison will be illu-
strated with three examples.
Example 1. Living along the A10-ring freeway in Amsterdam.
One of the roadside stations of the Amsterdam Air Quality
Monitoring Network is located directly along the A10-West free-
way with a traffic intensity of 146,000 vehicles per day. Six story
high apartment buildings are located just behind the measure-
ment station and at the other side of the road, creating a situation
resembling a street canyon.
We assumed that the exposure of the people living in the
apartment buildings is equal to the annual mean concentrations
measured, which is probably a slight overestimation. Since the
freeway traffic has the largest impact on NO2 and BC concentra-
tion, the health impact of those two pollutants are evaluated. In
2014, annual average NO2 and BC concentrations of 51.5 mg/m3 and
2.6 mg/m3 were measured at this station, respectively. Those ex-
posure levels are compared to a hypothetical counterfactual si-
tuation with annual mean NO2 and BC of 10 mg/m3 and 0.2 mg/m3
respectively. Those levels are broadly representative of air quality
in non-urban areas in Northern Scandinavia, the cleanest part of
Europe. The difference in concentration is 41.5 and 2.4 mg/m3 for
NO2 and BC, respectively (Table 4).
The arithmetic mean estimate of passive cigarette-equivalents
per exposure metric are 10.6 (2.4) for NO2 and 9.6 (2.8) for Black
Carbon, with an overall-average of 10.1 (1.8) passive cigarette-
equivalents.
Example 2. Evaluation of a local traffic measure in a busy street in
The Hague.
Different routing of traffic in the Hague resulted in a 50% de-
crease in traffic intensity in a busy inner city road, which was
17,000 vehicles per day before the intervention (Boogaard et al.,
2013). Air quality measurements, performed before (2008) and
after (2010) implementation of the measure, revealed that this
resulted in a decline of the traffic contribution of 1.4 mg/m3 and
11.7 mg/m3 for BC, and NO2, respectively (Boogaard et al., 2013).The
health benefits of those reductions in concentration, expressed in
cigarette-equivalents, are presented in Table 5.
The arithmetic mean estimate of passive cigarette-equivalents per
exposure metric was 3.0 (0.7) for NO2 and 5.6 (1.6) for BC. Overall,
different routing of traffic and the resulting decline of 50% in traffic
intensity resulted in improved air quality, comparable to avoiding
residential exposure to ETS from 4.3 (0.9) cigarettes per day.
Example 3. Evaluation of the emissions from a steel factory.
In the Netherlands, a large steel factory contributes to parti-
culate air pollution in the surrounding areas. Based on modeled
emission of primary particles in the year 2000, it was estimated
that the steel factory contributes 7.9 mg/m3 to the annual mean
PM10 concentration in the highest exposed communities (Ameling
et al., 2014). Since PM mass concentrations are most affected by
the steel factory's emissions, PM mass is the most relevant metric
to evaluate in this example. Assuming a PM2.5/PM10 ratio of 0.66
(Cyrys et al., 2003), this corresponds to a PM2.5 concentration of
5.2 mg/m3. Table 6 presents the results.
Table 6 demonstrates that the health effects of the emissions
from a steel factory are equivalent to residential exposure to ETS
from 2.9 (0.9) cigarettes per day.

 3.1. Sensitivity analyses
Table 7 presents the results of the sensitivity analyses pre-
sented in the method section.
Fewer passively smoked cigarettes in the home result in a
higher regression coefficient per passively smoked cigarette and
thus in a lower estimate of passive cigarette equivalents associated
with a defined change in air pollution. The number of passively
smoked cigarettes is linear related to the passive cigarette-equiv-
alency, which is illustrated in Table 7. Assuming that 25% instead
of 50% of the daily cigarette consumption is smoked indoors at
home (scenario 1) reduces the passive cigarette-equivalency with
a factor 2. Table 7 illustrates that in all scenarios, the health effect
of ‘living near the freeway’ (Example 1) is slightly higher than the
health risk of ‘living with a smoker’, regardless of the assumed
number of indoor smoked cigarettes. The health benefits of ‘a 50%
decline in traffic intensity’ (Example 2) are in all scenarios roughly
equivalent to the health benefits of ‘living with a smoker who
decides to smoke only half of the amount he smoked before’. The
health effects of the emissions from a steel factory's emissions are
roughly one-third of the health effects of living with a smoker.
4. Discussion
We developed a method to express the health risks of long
term exposure to ambient air pollution in equivalent numbers of
passively smoked cigarettes in the home, based on relative risks
obtained in epidemiological studies for four health outcomes re-
flecting childhood and adult health responses.
The equivalent number of passively smoked cigarettes (“passive
cigarette-equivalents”) varied within a factor three between health
outcomes suggesting that an average passive cigarette-equivalent
per pollutant is a useful metric. The health risk of living directly
near the freeway in Amsterdam compared to a counterfactual
clean situation is equivalent to daily residential ETS exposure from
10.1 cigarettes (95% CI: 6.5–13.7), more than the number of ci-
garettes smoked indoors at home by an average Western smoker.
A local traffic measure, resulting in a 50% decline in traffic in-
tensity in a busy inner city street in the Hague, is equivalent to the
benefits of avoiding ETS from 4.3 daily smoked cigarettes in the
home (95% CI: 2.5–6.1).
This method provides a tool that enables policy-makers and
health professionals to express the health risks of air pollution and
the health benefits of better air quality related to e.g. air quality
policies in a simple, appealing manner. The method can be used
both at the national/regional and at the local level, depending on
the pollutant that most adequately reflects exposure. This is often
PM2.5 at a larger scale and NO2 or BC at the local scale.
The comparison between air pollution and ETS exposure was
based on comparison of four health outcomes: Low Birth Weight,
lung function decrements, cardiovascular mortality and lung can-
cer. Obviously, ETS exposure and air pollution have been linked to
an increased risk of a wide range of other health outcomes (Kelly
and Fussell, 2015; Öberg et al. 2010), that have not been in-
corporated in this study. We selected only health outcomes for
which the relation with both ETS and all three pollution indicators
(PM2.5, NO2 and BC) could be quantified in meta-analyses.
The aim of our study was not to quantify the total burden of dis-
ease due to air pollution or ETS exposure (Lim et al., 2012), but to put
the health risks of air pollution in perspective. It should also be noted
that for both air pollution and ETS exposure, around 90% of deaths are
due to cardiovascular mortality and lung cancer (WHO, 2014; Wells,
1999), two health outcomes that were incorporated in our tool.
A strength of our study is that different health outcomes were
included, with different mechanistic pathways. Although different
estimates were obtained per pollutant-outcome combination,
which is inevitable given the inherent uncertainties of the method,
most estimates had overlapping confidence intervals and varied
within acceptable ranges. Summarizing the estimate for each
pollutant over the health outcomes reduced the uncertainty,
which is further decreased if more than one pollutant is included.
In air pollution epidemiology, one of the most intensively stu-
died health outcomes is ‘all cause mortality' (WHO, 2013; Janssen
et al., 2011) which forms the basis of the calculation of Years of Life
Lost (YLL) and Risk Advancement Periods (RAP). However, to our
knowledge no meta-analyses are available describing the CRF be-
tween ETS exposure and all cause mortality. Therefore we in-
corporated cardiovascular mortality, which is responsible for 80%
of total deaths due to air pollution (WHO, 2014).
4.1. Choice of passive smoking for comparison
We used passive smoking to put air pollution health risks in
perspective, based upon the assumption that this risk factor is
easier to understand by the public and policy makers. Passive
smoking is more visible than fine particle pollution and not only
associated with physiological health effects but also with annoy-
ance. Regulating actions against smoking in public places have
resulted in increased awareness of the health risk of ETS exposure
and decreased acceptance for those that are involuntarily exposed
to tobacco smell (Lu et al., 2011; Sivri et al., 2013). Both annoyance
and (physiological) health risks contribute to lower acceptance,
the relative contribution of the two is uncertain.
The prevalence of daily tobacco smoking has declined in de-
veloped countries in recent decades (Ng et al., 2014; Islami et al.,
2014), but our method is – by definition – based on comparison
with those that remain smoking indoors at home. However, we
did not find much evidence in the literature for a decreasing trend
in the exposure to ETS at home in households with passive
smoking. It has also been hypothesized that smoking bans in
public places resulted in more passive smoking at home. A Spanish
study reported a significant reduction of 15% in self reported ETS
exposure in the home among adult non-smokers comparing be-
fore (2004) and after (2012) smoke-free legislation (Sureda et al.,
2014). Data from the NHANES study in the US, however, demon-
strated a significant increase in serum cotinine levels for children
with exposure to ETS at home between 1999 and 2012, whereas
serum cotinine levels among nonsmoker adolescents with ex-
posure to ETS at home did not change over time (Jain, 2016).
4.2. Uncertainties
This method has a number of uncertainties. One of the most
important sources of uncertainty in the effect estimates is related
to the choice of the risk estimates. If available, we used relative
risks proposed by published systematic reviews which can be as-
sumed to provide the most appropriate, yet imperfect, effect es-
timates. If those were not available, we performed additional
meta-analyses based on the available published reports, providing
risk estimate to the best of our knowledge.
Another important source of uncertainty is the assumption of
the daily amount of cigarettes that a smoker smokes indoors at
home. Our calculations were based on the assumption that the
average number of smoked cigarettes was 14 per day for a smoker
in Western Europe/USA (Öberg et al. 2010). No literature was
available quantifying the number of cigarettes smoked indoors at
home, so this was based on assumptions about the smokers time
spent at home and smoking habits, as proposed by Nazaroff and
Singer (2004). This resulted in the assumption of 7 daily smoked
cigarettes in the home for exposure of an adult and 9 for a child.
We realize this assumption is subject to error and might not
S.C. van der Zee et al. / Environmental Research 148 (2016) 475–483
480
 adequately reflect the average number of passively smoked ci-
garettes indoors at home that children and adults are exposed to.
We note however that we used this assumption to calculate the
effect of ETS per cigarette in previous epidemiological studies that
represented residential ETS exposure as present/absent. Hence,
the key issue is whether the selected numbers represented these
studies well. Our method is based on comparison of health risks
expressed per passively smoked cigarette and therefore, it is not
sensitive to recent changes in smoking rates. However, when ex-
pressed in terms of “living with a smoker”, the equivalent health
effect attributed to air pollution increases with a decreasing
number of cigarettes smoked indoors at home by a smoker.
To account for the uncertainty in the estimation of the daily
amount of residentially smoked cigarettes we performed sensi-
tivity analyses, evaluating different assumptions about the number
of cigarettes that smokers smoke indoors at home. This illustrated
that the cigarette equivalency of air pollution was linear related to
the assumed number of smoked cigarettes. If the number of pas-
sively smoked cigarettes is assumed to be higher, the passive ci-
garette equivalents attributed to ambient air pollution is higher as
well – and vice versa. The sensitivity analyses also demonstrated
that, regardless the assumption of the amount smoked, the health
effect of ‘living near the freeway’ is slightly higher than the health
risk of ‘living with a smoker’.
Another limitation of our study is that despite our efforts to se-
lect comparable outcomes, there were differences between the
epidemiological studies of ETS and air pollution. In air pollution
epidemiology, concentration response functions are available for
cardiovascular mortality but fewer studies have evaluated IHD
mortality. In ETS epidemiology exposure response functions are only
available specifically for IHD. Since IHD is causally related to death in
relation to ETS exposure and IHD is a leading cause of mortality
among cardiovascular mortality, we assumed that the exposure-re-
sponse functions for cardiovascular mortality hold for IHD. To test
this hypothesis, we calculated the combined risk estimate for PM2.5
and IHD mortality from a review that provided risk estimates for
PM2.5 and IHD mortality in a number of individual studies (Burnett
et al., 2014). The combined effect for a 10 mg/m3 increase in PM2.5
concentration and IHD mortality was 1.18 (1.05–1.33) (presented in
the Supplemental Material), which is very similar to the combined
effect estimate of 1.20 (1.09–1.31) for the same increase in PM2.5
concentration and cardiovascular mortality we used in our method.
We did not use the IHD estimates as these are only available for
PM2.5 and not for NO2 and BC.
Furthermore, the health effect estimates for ETS in adults apply
to the population that does not actively smoke, whereas in the air
pollution literature the entire population is included. There is no
solid evidence that allows quantitative assessment of air pollution
effects in non-smoking subjects only, but there is evidence that
both smokers and non-smokers are affected by air pollution (Pope
et al., 2004; Dabass et al., 2016).
Another source of uncertainty is related to exposure error.
Personal exposure to both air pollution and ETS is determined by
activity patterns, such as time spent at home, school, work or
elsewhere. The use of outdoor concentrations to assess exposure
to air pollution leads to exposure misclassification. However, the
concentration response functions that quantify the strength of the
association between pollutant concentration and health outcomes
are derived from epidemiological studies that generally are also
based on outdoor concentrations. They are subject to the same
degree of exposure misclassification and thus, it is justified to rely
on outdoor concentrations to estimate the health effects for our
comparison.
Pope et al. (2009, 2011) have evaluated exposure-response
functions for PM2.5, passive and active smoking in relation to
cardiovascular mortality and lung cancer. Similar to our study, IHD
mortality was investigated in relation to ETS exposure and CVD
mortality in relation to PM2.5 exposure. However, Pope and col-
leagues used ETS exposure to derive estimates of PM2.5 exposure,
in order to derive the shape of the PM2.5 exposure response
function. For instance, estimated average PM2.5 exposure was
30 mg/m3 for living with a spouse who smokes, based on limited
data from studies that sampled PM2.5 concentrations from ETS
exposure in various setting over time (Spengler et al., 1985;
Dockery and Spengler, 1981; Jenkins et al., 1996; Leaderer and
Hammond, 1991). An alternative approach would be to express
(changes in) PM2.5 concentration in terms of equivalent changes
in concentration, caused directly by residential ETS exposure.
However, the studies that sampled PM2.5 are decades old, and the
strength of our method is that we compare health risks instead of
various health outcomes and various pollutants.
We selected three examples with sizable contrast in air pollu-
tion exposure to illustrate the method. The impact of many local
policy measures on air quality is generally more modest, since the
concentrations are mainly determined at the national and Eur-
opean level.
Consequently, the associated gain in passive cigarette-equiva-
lents is generally small.
We have developed a method to express health risks of air
pollution in an equivalent number of passively smoked cigarettes,
assuming that this is easier to communicate to the public and
policy makers. Future research is needed to evaluate the useful-
ness of this tool for local policy makers and the public in the
setting of practical environmental health problems.
5. Conclusions
We have developed a method to express the health effects of
air pollution into equivalent amounts of passive smoking, based on
the currently available epidemiologic evidence. The proposed
method expresses the health risks of air pollution and the health
benefits of better air quality in a simple, appealing manner. The
method can be used both at the national/regional level and at the
local level, in situations where traffic is the major source of air
pollution.
