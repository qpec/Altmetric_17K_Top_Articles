Abstract
Objective—To examine, in a population-based cohort of three-year-old children, the association 
between self-regulation and exposure to the household routines of regular bedtime, regular 
mealtime, and limits on watching television/video; and to determine whether self-regulation and 
these routines predict the risk of obesity at age 11.
Methods—Analyses included 10 955 children in the nationally-representative UK Millennium 
Cohort Study. When children were age 3, parents reported whether children had a regular bedtime 
and mealtime and the amount of television/video watched. Emotional and cognitive self-regulation 
at age 3 were assessed by parent-report with the Child Social Behaviour Questionnaire. Children’s 
height and weight were measured at age 11 and obesity was defined using the International 
Obesity Task Force (IOTF) criteria.
Results—At age 3, 41% of children always had a regular bedtime, 47% always had a regular 
mealtime, and 23% were limited to ≤1 hour television/video daily. At age 11, 6.2% of children 
were obese. All three household routines were significantly associated with better emotional self-
regulation, but not better cognitive self-regulation. In a multi-variable logistic regression model

 including emotional and cognitive self-regulation, all routines, and controlling for 
sociodemographic covariates, a 1 unit difference in emotional self-regulation at age 3 was 
associated with an OR (95% CI) for obesity of 1.38 (1.11, 1.71) at age 11, and inconsistent 
bedtimes with an OR (95% CI) for obesity of 1.87 (1.39, 2.51) at age 11. There was no evidence 
that emotional self-regulation mediated the relationship between regular bedtimes and later 
obesity. Cognitive self-regulation was not associated with later obesity.
Conclusions—Three-year-old children who had regular bedtimes, mealtimes, and limits on their 
television/video time had better emotional self-regulation. Lack of a regular bedtime and poorer 
emotional self-regulation at age 3 were independent predictors of obesity at age 11.

INTRODUCTION
Young children benefit from having household routines around sleep and meals and limits 
on television/video time.1–3 These routines have been linked to a reduced risk of childhood 
obesity4–9 and better self-regulation.1, 10 At the same time, poor self-regulation in early 
childhood has been associated with increased risk for overweight and obesity in late 
childhood,11–13 and adulthood.14 However, no prospective studies have examined how both 
household routines and self-regulation in early childhood predict later obesity.
Self-regulation is a complex, multi-dimensional construct, that encompasses both emotional 
and cognitive processes that modulate arousal and attention, thereby enabling goal-directed 
behavior.15, 16 Although overlapping and interrelated in young children, emotional and 
cognitive self-regulation have different developmental trajectories.16 The neurobiology of 
emotion and appetite are both centered in the subcortical limbic structures of the brain,17, 18 
while the more cognitive processes of self-regulation are based in the prefrontal cortex, 
which matures much later in development.19, 20 Obesity researchers have recently begun 
differentiating between emotional and cognitive self-regulation,21–23 and childhood obesity 
prevention strategies that target supporting the development of self-regulation may need to 
account for the relative immaturity of cognitive self-regulation processes in young children. 
To our knowledge the relationship of both emotional and cognitive aspects of self-regulation 
to the development of obesity has not been examined prospectively in a population-based 
cohort.
Through longitudinal analyses of the UK Millennium Cohort Study (MCS), we investigate 
whether emotional and cognitive self-regulation are related to household routines in early 
childhood and how both self-regulation and routines predict later obesity. We hypothesize 
that 3-year-old children with household routines will have better self-regulation at age 3 and 
lower risk for obesity at age 11, and that poor self-regulation will explain part of the 
relationship between the lack of household routines and obesity.

 METHODS
The Millennium Cohort Study (MCS)
The MCS is a prospective, longitudinal study of a representative sample of children born 
into 19 244 families in the United Kingdom (UK) between September 2000 and January 
2002. All children born during this time frame who were alive and living in the UK at 9 
months of age were eligible for the study. However, the sample was selected from the Child 
Benefit register maintained by the Department of Social Security, and although almost all 
children receive the Child Benefit, a small number of children of recent immigrants and non-
national temporary residents (e.g., foreign students) are ineligible.24 A clustered, stratified 
design was used with oversampling to ensure representation of children living in areas of 
high poverty or with large ethnic minority populations in England. Details of the design and 
procedures have been published elsewhere.25 The first study visit occurred when children 
were 9-months-old with follow-up visits at ages 3, 5, 7, and 11 years. All visits were 
conducted in the home by trained, computer-assisted interviewers.25 The MCS was reviewed 
and approved by appropriate research ethics committees at each cycle of data collection, and 
parents provided written informed consent for all components of MCS. At the age 11 
follow-up (MCS 5), children also provided informed consent.25 De-identified data files were 
downloaded from the UK data archive in October 2015.26, 27
Household routines at age 3
Information about household routines at age 3 was reported by primary caregivers (>98% 
biological mothers) during the computer-assisted personal interview. Specifically, parents 
were asked, “Does [child’s name] go to bed at regular times?” and “Does [child’s name] 
have meals at regular times?” with response options of “Never or almost never”, 
“Sometimes”, “Usually”, or “Always”.28 Those with responses of “always” were coded as 
having a regular bedtime and/or mealtime routine. Responses of “sometimes” or “almost 
never or never” were indicative of inconsistent bedtime or mealtime routines. Children’s 
typical daily television/video time was assessed with the question, “Typically, how many 
hours a day does [child’s name] watch television or videos? Would you say Not at all, Up to 
1 hour, More than 1 hour–less than 3 hours, or More than 3 hours”. Those with responses of 
“not at all” or “up to 1 hour” were coded as having the routine of limited television/video 
viewing.
Child self-regulation at age 3
During the self-completion module of the parent-interview at age 3, parents completed 10 
items from the Child Social Behaviour Questionnaire,29, 30 which was adapted from the 
Adaptive Social Behavior Inventory.31 The parent was directed to think about their child’s 
behaviour during the past 6 months and to choose whether each statement was: Not true (1), 
Somewhat true (2), Certainly true (3), or Can’t say (4). Responses of “Can’t say” were 
treated as missing in our analyses. The scale labeled “emotional dysregulation” contains five 
items related to emotional self-regulation (e.g., “is easily frustrated”). The scale labeled 
“independence and self-regulation” contains five items related to cognitive self-regulation 
(e.g., “persists in the face of difficult tasks”). Emotional self-regulation and cognitive self-
regulation scores were calculated as the average response to the items completed within each

 scale; a score was not calculated if more than 2 items were missing. Cronbach’s coefficient 
alpha was used to assess internal consistency reliability.32 All items of the cognitive self-
regulation scale were worded such that a higher score indicates that the child had better self-
regulation. Cronbach’s alpha was 0.57 for this scale. Four of the 5 items of the emotional 
self-regulation scale are worded such that a higher score indicates that the child has more 
challenges regulating emotion; a fifth item was reverse coded. Cronbach’s coefficient alpha 
for the 5 items in the scale was 0.63, but the reverse coded item was only weakly correlated 
with the others (Cronbach’s alpha was 0.70 for the 4-items) and thus we elected to use the 
average score across these 4 items as our measure of emotional self-regulation. However, our 
findings were not meaningfully different using the 5-item score (results not shown), and the 
correlation of scores using 4 items or 5 items was very high (r=0.96). Wording and response 
distributions for the Child Social Behaviour Questionnaire are provided in the Appendix.
Obesity at age 11
Children’s height and weight, without shoes and wearing light clothing, were measured by 
trained interviewers using standardized protocols. Standing height was measured with heels 
together and head in the Frankfurt plane using a Leicester stadiometer and recorded to the 
nearest millimeter. Weight was measured using a Tanita BF-522W scale.33 Body mass index 
(BMI) was calculated as kg/m2. The revised IOTF age- and sex-specific LMS values were 
used to determine BMI z-scores;34 LMS values are provided at 6 month intervals and we 
used linear interpolation to estimate LMS values to whole months for each sex.34 The 
distribution of BMI z-scores was examined and children with BMI z-scores below −5 (n=4) 
or above 5 (n=0) were set to missing. Obesity at age 11 (MCS 5) was defined as a BMI z-
score at or above the centile passing through BMI=30 at age 18 years.34
Covariates
Covariates were used in regression models to control for potential confounding and in 
stratified analyses to describe differences in prevalence of obesity and household routines by 
population sociodemographic characteristics. Children’s age at each sweep was calculated 
based on their birth month and year, the date of the main parent-interview at MCS 2 and the 
date of child measurement at MCS 5. Birth weight in grams was reported by the main parent 
respondent at enrollment. Household income and household size (including the number of 
siblings the child had) were reported by parents at MCS 2; MCS used interval regression to 
impute missing income data and calculated quintiles of OECD equivalized household 
income which are included in the deposited data.25 Parental age at the time of the child’s 
birth was determined for the ‘main’ parent respondent; this was the child’s natural mother 
for >98% of children, the natural father for approximately 1% of children, and another 
primary caregiver (e.g., adoptive mother) in fewer than 50 cases. The child’s parent-reported 
main ethnicity was classified as ‘White’, ‘Mixed’, ‘Indian’, ‘Pakistani and Bangladeshi’, 
‘Black or Black British’, or ‘Other ethnic group’ using the 6-category census 
classification.29 The highest academic and vocational qualifications achieved by either 
parent at MCS 2 was used to define parental education; classifications were made according 
to the National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) framework.29 The country (England, 
Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland) in which the child resided at 9 months was also used as a 
covariate.

 Statistical Analyses
The MCS is designed to allow inference to the population of children born September 2001-
January 2002 and living in the UK when 9 months old. All analyses utilize survey weights 
that adjust for unequal probabilities of selection and survey non-response; variance estimates 
are adjusted for stratification and clustering of the sample design.25 Analyses were 
conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Statistical tests are 2-sided 
and the alpha level was 0.05.
Our analysis included all singleton births (n=18 982) whose parent was interviewed at MCS 
2 (n=15 382), and who had BMI at age 11 (n=11 592). A further 597 children (5%) were 
excluded for having missing information on self-regulation. The final analytic sample 
included data from 10 995 children and their families. We used design-corrected median 
tests35 and Rao-Scott design-corrected chi-square tests to compare sociodemographic 
characteristics of children in the analytic sample to those who participated in MCS 2 but 
were excluded from our analyses due to missing information (n=4 387). Rao-Scott design-
corrected chi-square tests were used to compare the prevalence of the three household 
routines (regular bedtime, regular mealtime, and <1 hour per day television/video viewing) 
and obesity across levels of each sociodemographic characteristic.
To examine the relationship between routines and self-regulation at age 3 years, we 
determined the unadjusted mean (95% CI) emotional and cognitive self-regulation score at 
each level of a given routine. Using linear regression models to adjust for country, child age, 
sex, birth weight, ethnicity, parent age, education, and household income, we then estimated 
the adjusted mean difference in self-regulation score comparing the lowest to the highest 
level of each routine. We also determined the percentage (95% CI) of children who were in 
the lowest quartile of each self-regulation score across levels of routines and used covariate 
adjusted logistic regression analyses to estimate the odds ratio of being in the lowest self-
regulation quartile among those in the lowest level of each routine compared to those in the 
highest.
Logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship of routines and self-
regulation at age 3 to obesity at age 11. Unadjusted (univariate) models were conducted first. 
Each routine was modeled separately as a categorical variable with the reference category as 
“always” for regular bedtime and regular mealtime, and “up to 1 hour/per day” for TV/video 
viewing. Next, a model with all three routines was used to determine the independent 
association of each with obesity. Then, to determine if self-regulation explained the 
association between routines and obesity, emotional and cognitive self-regulation scores 
were added to the model as continuous variables. Finally, this model was adjusted for 
covariates.
RESULTS
Sociodemographic characteristics of the analytic sample are presented in Table 1. Children 
who participated in MCS 2 but were excluded from the analytic sample were more likely to 
be from ethnic-minority and households with less socioeconomic advantage (Table 1). More 
than 2 out of 5 children (41.4%) always had a regular bedtime at age 3, almost half (46.6%)

 always had regular mealtimes, and fewer than 1 in 4 children (23.1%, 95% CI: 21.7–24.5) 
had daily television/video viewing of 1 hour or less (Table 2).
At age 11 years, 6.2% of children were obese (Table 3). Differences in obesity prevalence by 
country and ethnicity were apparent, and obesity was more common at lower levels of 
parental education and household income. Children who at age 3 had one sibling were less 
likely to be obese compared to children with none or many siblings. However, similar 
percentages of boys and girls were obese and obesity was not related to parental age (Table 
3). Distribution of household routines by sociodemographic characteristics are shown in 
Table 3. Boys and girls did not differ in their exposure to any of the routines. Always having 
regular mealtimes was more common in Northern Ireland, but regular bedtimes and limited 
television/video viewing did not differ by country. With the exception that limited television/
video viewing was unrelated to ethnicity, all other sociodemographic characteristics were 
related to the prevalence of always having a regular bedtime, always having a regular 
mealtime, and limited TV/video. A social gradient was evident for regular bedtime and 
limited TV/video viewing with these routines more common in families with higher income 
and more education (Table 3).
The mean (standard error of measurement, SEM) of the emotional self-regulation score was 
2.0 (0.009) and the median (inter-quartile range, IQR) was 1.9 (1.5 – 2.3); the mean (SEM) 
and median (IQR) for the cognitive self-regulation score was, respectively, 2.5 (0.005) and 
2.4 (2.1 – 2.8). The correlation between self-regulation scores was r= −0.05. All 3 routines 
were associated with significantly better emotional self-regulation, but only regular 
mealtimes were associated with significantly better cognitive self-regulation (Table 4).
To understand the combined influence of routines and self-regulation on risk for obesity we 
conducted a series of logistic regression analyses (Table 5). In unadjusted (univariate) 
models, children with inconsistent bedtimes at age 3 were more likely [OR (95% CI) = 2.18 
(1.70–2.79)] than children who always had a regular bedtime to be obese at age 11, and 
compared to children limited to an hour per day of TV/video viewing, those with the highest 
viewing times (>3 hours/day) had an OR (95% CI) for obesity of 1.39 (1.03, 1.88). Regular 
mealtimes were not associated with obesity at age 11 in univariate analyses. Poorer 
emotional self-regulation predicted obesity at age 11 (OR for 1 unit difference was 1.50, P<.
001 in univariate analyses), but cognitive self-regulation was not related to obesity at age 11 
(OR = 0.87, P=.30). To investigate the extent to which any association between household 
routines at age 3 and obesity at age 11 was mediated by self-regulation, we compared a 
model containing all three routines (Table 5, model B) to one that also included emotional 
and cognitive self-regulation scores (model C). In the presence of a strong mediator the 
association between routines and obesity would be attenuated, but we found that the 
parameter estimates were not greatly changed. Poorer emotional self-regulation and 
inconsistent bedtimes were independently associated with higher odds for obesity. This 
remained true with further adjustment for covariates; in the fully-adjusted analysis (model 
D), inconsistent bedtimes and poorer emotional self-regulation (1-unit difference) were, 
respectively, associated with an OR (95% CI) for obesity of 1.87 (1.39, 2.51) and 1.38 (1.11, 
1.71). There was no evidence that television/video viewing or cognitive self-regulation

 predicted obesity. However, in contrast to our hypotheses, not always having a regular 
mealtime at age 3 was associated with lower odds for obesity at age 11 (Table 5, model D).
DISCUSSION
In this large nationally representative study of children born in the UK, we found that the 
household routines of having regular bedtimes and mealtimes and limits on television/video 
viewing were associated with better emotional self-regulation in 3-year-old children. Poorer 
emotional self-regulation predicted an increased risk for obesity at age 11, but this was not 
the case for cognitive self-regulation. The lack of a regular bedtime and poorer emotional 
self-regulation at age 3 were independent predictors of obesity at age 11, and self-regulation 
did not appear to account for the association between the bedtime routine and obesity. Also 
in contrast to our hypotheses, children with inconsistent mealtimes at age 3 were less likely 
to be obese at age 11, and television/video viewing was not related to obesity after 
accounting for other routines.
This is the first prospective analysis of the relationship between household routines and self-
regulation in young children and how these factors work together to predict obesity. The 
large, representative sample of UK children born close to the new millennium increases the 
generalizability of our findings. Our objective in this analysis was to understand how three 
household routines that are frequently recommended for families with young children,2 and 
which much prior research has suggested are associated with lower prevalence of obesity,4–8 
are themselves related to young children’s self-regulation. This analysis adds to the literature 
by demonstrating a prospective association between emotional self-regulation in early 
childhood and obesity in later childhood in a large recent population-based sample.
A number of studies of self-regulation and risk for weight gain or obesity in children have 
been conducted.11–14, 36, 37 In the US Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development 
(SECCYD) in which ~1200 children born in 1991 were studied through adolescence, 
preschool-aged children with poorer self-regulation in the domains of observed inhibitory 
control and delay of gratification had greater weight gain and risk for overweight.11, 12 
Graziano and colleagues13, 36 studied emotion regulation, inhibitory control, and sustained 
attention in two-year-old children in relation to weight status later in childhood; poorer 
emotion regulation was associated with greater weight gain between age 2 and 5.5 years and 
predicted overweight at 5.5 years.36 Further, overweight 10-year-old children had lower 
levels of overall self-regulation at age 2 than their healthy weight peers.13 Greater ability to 
delay gratification in early childhood has also been linked to lower BMI in adulthood.14
The contribution of self-regulation to many positive outcomes other than healthy weight has 
been well-established by early childhood educators and developmental scientists,38, 39 but 
there is not consensus about how to label or characterize aspects of self-regulation.40 It is 
also uncertain whether self-regulation in eating differs from self-regulation in non-eating 
behaviors. Miller and colleagues22 investigated behavioral and emotional self-regulation in 
food and non-food related contexts among 133 toddlers from low-income families and 
examined cross-sectional associations with children’s weight. They found that toddlers who 
displayed better emotional regulation in both food and non-food tasks had lower risks for

 overweight/obesity, but better behavioral regulation was associated with lower risk of 
obesity for only the food task.22 In early childhood, it is difficult to disentangle the relative 
contributions of emotional and cognitive self-regulation and their joint contribution to 
observed behavioral self-regulation. Interventions in young children designed to improve 
self-regulation by focusing on cognitive strategies may be limited by the relative 
neurobiological immaturity of cognitive versus emotional systems. This may also explain 
why we found stronger associations between emotional self-regulation at age 3 and later 
obesity.
Of the three household routines we examined, having a regular bedtime was most strongly 
associated with risk for obesity. This finding adds to a large literature on the importance of 
adequate sleep for childhood obesity prevention.41–43 Children who have a regular bedtime 
routine also have earlier bedtimes, sleep more, fall asleep faster, have fewer nighttime 
awakenings, and are less likely to have behavior problems.44 We found a stepwise 
relationship between regularity of bedtime and risk for obesity; compared to ‘always’ having 
a regular bedtime, even children who ‘usually’ had a regular bedtime had a statistically 
significantly elevated risk for obesity and the risk for obesity was even higher in children 
with inconsistent bedtimes.
Limiting young children’s television and video viewing is recommended for numerous 
reasons that include and go beyond obesity prevention.8, 45 Our results are consistent with 
high levels (3 or more hours daily compared to 1 or fewer hours) of television/video viewing 
in young children predicting higher odds of obesity, but this finding did not persist after 
controlling for the other routines. Nevertheless, measurement of television and video 
viewing was imprecise and did not include time spent using computers. Children in MCS 
were not exposed to smart phones or tablet computers in early childhood.
Our result of lower risk for obesity associated with not ‘always’ having regular mealtimes at 
age 3 was unexpected. In fully adjusted models, obesity risk was lower for children who 
usually had regular mealtimes as well as for children with inconsistent mealtimes. It is 
important to note that almost half (47%) of children always had regular mealtimes, slightly 
fewer (44%) usually had regular mealtimes, and fewer than 1 in 10 had inconsistent 
mealtimes. In post-hoc analyses we explored how mealtime regularity was related to 
bedtime regularity and whether this could explain our results. For example, if the percentage 
of children who ‘always’ had regular bedtimes was lower among children who had 
inconsistent mealtimes compared to children who always had regular mealtimes then 
adjusting for bedtime might explain why inconsistent mealtimes reduced risk for obesity. 
However, this was not what we observed in the data; children who always had regular 
mealtimes were more likely to always have regular bedtimes.
This research should be interpreted in the context of the following limitations: first, as with 
any observational study, causality cannot be inferred. Second, the MCS is a large, 
population-based study designed to be representative of children born early in the new 
millennium and living in the UK as infants, and findings may not be generalizable to earlier 
or later born cohorts or children in other countries. Third, household routines and child self-
regulation at age 3 were measured imprecisely and by parent-report; thus our analyses are

 impacted by measurement error and may be biased by social desirability.46 Fourth, the 
measure of children’s self-regulation, the Child Social Behaviour Questionnaire, had only 
modest internal reliability in this sample. This was particularly true for the cognitive self-
regulation scale and that could explain the lack of association with obesity. In addition, there 
are only three response options on the Child Social Behaviour Questionnaire and the 
distribution of responses, particularly to the cognitive self-regulation items was highly 
skewed. The items on cognitive self-regulation focus on independence, persistence, and task 
changing; whether these items assess a unitary construct in 3-year-old children is uncertain. 
Fifth, children’s height and weight were measured and obesity categorized based on the 
IOTF sex-specific BMI centile associated with an adult BMI of 30. The sensitivity and 
specificity of the IOTF obesity definition for identifying high levels of adiposity in children 
has been evaluated,47 and although the specificity is high, the sensitivity is moderate.47 
Thus, most children classified as obese by the IOTF definition have high levels of adiposity, 
but other children with high levels of body fat may not be defined as obese. Sixth, although 
we controlled for potentially confounding child and family characteristics, these were 
measured imprecisely, and other confounding factors could be important; thus bias due to 
confounding cannot be eliminated.
Our finding that emotional self-regulation and household routines at age 3 are associated and 
that these are independent predictors of obesity at age 11 is consistent with a conceptual 
framework in which children’s emotion regulation develops within a family context that 
includes routines. Another important aspect of this family context includes socioeconomic 
circumstances. We found, as have others,4, 48 that parental education and household income 
were strong predictors of whether preschool-aged children had routines around bedtime, 
mealtime, and limits on screen time. Parenting is more challenging when resources are 
limited; in addition to fewer routines and less structure, children living in poverty are more 
likely to experience the types of parental interactions that can undermine attachment security 
(i.e., harsh, inconsistent, mistimed, frightening).49 The capacity of a child to regulate his/her 
emotions and behavior, particularly in the context of stress, is supported by having a secure 
pattern of attachment with a parent or caregiver.50, 51 Both insecure attachment and poor-
quality parent-child interactions have been linked to obesity risk in prospective studies of US 
children.52–54 How all these, and other, aspects of the early childhood family environment 
come together to influence children’s weight status is an area of active inquiry.5, 7, 21–23 
Consistent with other research,41, 44 our study provides additional evidence of the benefit of 
supporting parents in establishing and maintaining a regular bedtime routine for their young 
children. More research is needed on how and whether the timing and regularity of 
children’s mealtimes impacts obesity risk. Inconsistent mealtimes could, for example, be 
associated with a confounding factor such as greater family participation in physical activity, 
or always having regular mealtimes could be associated with eating meals later in the 
evening.55 Alternatively, genetic effects on appetite and enjoyment of food could be 
correlated with weight status and influence the relative importance families place on 
mealtime routines. Much is not understood about how the development of emotional and 
cognitive self-regulation intersects with metabolic, behavioral, and social pathways to 
obesity among children. Such research is needed to inform development of any public health 
strategies targeting early childhood obesity prevention.

aChild Social Behaviour Questionnaire. Emotional and cognitive self-regulation scores range from 1 to 3. Higher emotion self-regulation scores indicate a child who has more difficulties regulating 
emotion. Higher cognitive self-regulation scores indicate a child who is more persistent and shows more independence in planning and changing tasks.
bMean (95% CI) self-regulation score at each level of routine, unadjusted for covariates.
cPercentage, unadjusted for covariates, in least self-regulated quartile: defined as scores ≥2.5 for emotional self-regulation; ≤2.2 for cognitive self-regulation.

aBMI from measured height and weight at MCS5 – age 11; obesity defined based on IOTF guidelines.
bChild Social Behaviour Questionnaire. Subscale scores range from 1 to 3. Higher emotional self-regulation scores indicate a child who has more difficulties regulating emotion. Higher cognitive self-
regulation scores indicate a child who is more persistent and shows more independence in planning and changing tasks. Odds ratio for a 1 unit difference in score.
cCovariates adjusted are country, child age, number of siblings, sex, ethnicity, birth weight, parent age, education, household income.
dP value for emotional self-regulation was P<.001 in univariate model, P=.002 in model adjusted for routines, and P=.003 in fully adjusted model; for cognitive self-regulation these P values were, 
respectively, .30, .43, and .72.
eNot applicable for continuous measure. The prevalence (95% CI) of obesity at age 11 by quartiles of emotional self-regulation score (most well-regulated to least well-regulated) was 4.9% (3.7, 6.0); 4.8% 
(3.9, 5.8); 7.1% (6.0, 8.2); and 7.8% (6.4, 9.1); by quartiles of cognitive self-regulation score (most well-regulated to least well-regulated) the prevalence (95% CI) of obesity was 6.3% (5.1, 7.4); 5.5% (4.5, 
6.4); 6.1% (4.8, 7.4); and 6.6% (5.7, 7.6).
