rade between Canada and the United States has been 
transformed over the past 3 decades.1–4 Amid consider-
able controversy, the Canada–United States Free Trade 
Agreement (CUSFTA) came into force in 1989, followed by the 
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994 (Box 1).1 
Although CUSFTA removed most tariffs on goods and services, 
some restrictions remained, including those on high-fructose 
corn syrup (HFCS).2,5 However, the remaining tariffs were 
removed progressively once NAFTA was signed.6–9
Public health commentators have long expressed concern 
that NAFTA, as with other free trade agreements (FTAs), could 
pose a threat to health.10–12 Yet, empirical research on the conse-
quences of NAFTA for the health of Canadians is limited, with 
most previous studies focused on its economic and political 
impacts.4,13 One prominent concern centres on lower prices cre-
ated by trade liberalization, including lower tariffs, which lead to 
increased imports of energy-dense products that lack nutritional 
benefits: so-called “empty calories.”14,15 Lower prices encourage 
manufacturers to use these products in cheap processed food, 
with consequences for obesity and the health effects that flow 
from it.11
Although these concerns have been voiced repeatedly, con-
crete evidence has been limited thus far.16,17 Most previous stud-
ies of FTAs and diets are single-country case studies and pre-
clude conclusions about causality.18,19 Difficulties in estimating 
the impact of FTAs are compounded by their complexity, as FTAs 
include changes to both tariff and nontariff barriers applicable to 
both trade and investment.20 The existing literature has been 
unable to untangle this complexity.19 Many studies are sensitive 
to sample selection, and very little attention has been paid to

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Critics of free trade 
agreements have argued that they 
threaten public health, as they elimi-
nate barriers to trade in potentially 
harmful products, such as sugar. Here 
we analyze the North American Free 
Trade Agreement (NAFTA), testing the 
hypothesis that lowering tariffs on food 
and beverage syrups that contain high-
fructose corn syrup (HFCS) increased its 
use in foods consumed in Canada.
METHODS: We used supply data from 
the Food and Agriculture Organization 
 
of the United Nations to assess changes 
in supply of caloric sweeteners includ-
ing HFCS after NAFTA. We estimate the 
impact of NAFTA on supply of HFCS in 
Canada using an innovative, quasi-
experimental methodology — synthetic 
control methods — that creates a con-
trol group with which to compare Cana-
da’s outcomes. Additional robustness 
tests were performed for sample, con-
trol groups and model specification.
RESULTS: Tariff reductions in NAFTA coin-
cided with a 41.6 (95% confidence inter-
val 25.1 to 58.2) kilocalorie per capita 
daily increase in the supply of caloric 
sweeteners including HFCS. This change 
was not observed in the control groups, 
including Australia and the United King-
dom, as well as a composite control of 16 
countries. Results were robust to placebo 
tests and additional sensitivity analyses.
INTERPRETATION: NAFTA was strongly 
associated with a marked rise in HFCS 
supply and likely consumption in Canada. 
Our study provides evidence that even 
a seemingly modest change to product 
tariffs in free trade agreements can sub-
stantially alter population-wide dietary 
behaviour and exposure to risk factors.

specific potentially harmful foods, such as HFCS, which is linked 
to dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome 
(Box 1).8,9,19,51–54 Here we take advantage of an exceptional natural 
experiment in which tariffs on HFCS were withdrawn, within an 
existing system of free trade in goods, to study the effect of with-
drawal of tariffs on HFCS products on consumption of the same 
in Canada. 
Methods
We use an innovative methodology of time-series analysis with a 
“synthetic control” that estimates the supply in Canada against a 
control group, including specific countries and a weighted combi-
nation of comparison control nations. This better simulates experi-
mental conditions to assess the null hypothesis of no effect, or 
what would have happened to the supply of food and beverage syr-
ups that include HFCS in the absence of a change to import tariffs.
Study setting
NAFTA included a schedule that set out subtle but potentially 
important changes to tariffs on Canadian imports of caloric HFCS 
syrups used in food and beverage production between 1994 and 
1998, as shown in Appendix 1 (Appendix 1, available at www.
cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.161152/-/DC1). A long-
standing dispute over subsidies to US cane and beet sugar farm-
ers had prevented tariffs on all food and beverage syrups from 
being removed in CUSFTA.2,5 The concerns were mainly with 
respect to cane and beet sugars, but syrups from cane and beet 
sugars and HFCS were combined in 1 tariff category. However, 
NAFTA’s tariff schedule separated them into 2 categories, so tar-
iffs on food and beverage syrups containing HFCS were gradually 
removed between 1994 and 1998, but remained in place for cane 
and beet syrups.21–23
Data sources and measures
To evaluate the effect of the tariff reductions arising from NAFTA, 
we use annual food supply data from the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations Statistics Office (FAOSTAT).24 
FAOSTAT data comprise the only available data source for esti-
mating changes in food consumption on a comparative, cross-
national basis during the study period. The FAOSTAT database 
details total food supply for human consumption in kilocalories 
(kcal) per capita per day. Annual supply figures are the sum of 
imports and domestic production, less exports, estimated wast-
age and stocks from the previous period. Table 1 summarizes the 
definitions of variables and the data sources used in our analysis. 
Governments report food supply data to the United Nations 
based on harmonized classification and measurement guide-
lines. Supply of HFCS is captured in FAOSTAT’s measure of total 
caloric sweeteners, which also captures additional syrups with 
unchanged tariffs: pure fructose and maltose, maple sugar and

US exports of HFCS using data from the United States Department

Fixed effects and synthetic control models
To estimate the effect of NAFTA, we are interested in comparing 
levels of supply in Canada with its control. We first estimate 
cross-national fixed-effects regression models with country-
specific intercepts; i.e., dummy variables for each country that 
capture unobserved, time-invariant country characteristics that 
could affect caloric sweetener supply. We compare Canada with 
2 other high-income countries that approximate this control, as 
they had parallel trends in supply before NAFTA: Australia and 
the United Kingdom (Appendix 2, available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.161152/-/DC1).
Because fixed-effects regression models can yield biased 
effect estimates, we then estimate the control for Canada using 
the “synthetic control” method.29,30 This approach overcomes 
certain limitations associated with the widely used Difference-in-
Differences approach.31 It estimates supply in Canada’s control 
from a weighted combination of comparison countries that were 
similar (as identified using variables that predict supply), but 
were not exposed to US FTAs. Weights are assigned according to 
each country’s similarity with Canada pre-NAFTA and each vari-
able’s predictive power (see Appendix 3 [available at www.cmaj.
ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.161152/-/DC1] for a full 
description of this method).32,33 Following previous studies of 
dietary change and consumption, the predictors are GDP per 
capita and inflation, as well as vegetable, vegetable oil, fruit, 
meat, cereal, animal fat and total food consumption.34–36 We also 
include 1-year lagged values of the outcome variable to capture 
unobserved factors that affect supply.37
The pool of comparison countries is restricted to countries 
that enable us to distinguish the effect of NAFTA from other 
important macroeconomic and trade policy changes. Similar to 
Canada, the 16 comparison countries were members of the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD), and made similar global trade policy commitments as 
members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the Gen-
eral Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (the WTO’s precursor). How-
ever, unlike Canada, the “control group” countries did not enter 
a US FTA during the study period: Australia, Austria, Denmark, 
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, 
New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.

as comparison units and their weights from this analysis. The

in the donor pool. Four-fifths of Canada’s control is constructed 
using predictor observations in Spain, Germany and New Zea-
land, and the remaining fifth is based on the remaining 13 coun-
tries (Appendix 5, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.161152/-/DC1). Our sample covers the years 
1985–2000. Additional analyses confirmed that our results are 
not qualitatively affected by our choice of study period (Appen-
dix 6, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.161152/-/DC1). Analyses were done in STATA version 13.1.
Methods for checking robustness
We carried out additional analyses to test whether our findings are 
sensitive to our sample specification and differences in trade 
instruments between North America and Europe. This included an 
“in-space” placebo used to estimate p values by comparing the 
effect estimated for Canada with a placebo effect obtained by iter-
atively reassigning NAFTA to countries that did not actually imple-
ment it, and then calculating placebo effects for each country. 
Ethics approval
No ethics approval was required for the study, as we used pub-
licly available, pre-anonymized  data.
Results
Figure 1 shows that in Canada, the daily per capita supply of 
caloric sweeteners including HFCS rose from 21.2 kcal (95% con-
fidence interval [CI] 10.26 to 32.19) in the pre-NAFTA period to 
62.9 kcal (95% CI 50.43 to 75.29) post-NAFTA. This represents a 
41.6 kcal (95% CI 25.06 to 58.21) increase after tariffs were 
removed on food and beverage syrups containing HFCS. The rise 
in caloric sweeteners persisted for each year that tariffs were 
reduced, stopping after the final reduction in 1998. Cross-
national fixed-effects models also identify an increase in supply 
of caloric sweeteners after Canada acceded to NAFTA, compared 
with Australia and the UK (NAFTA estimate: 34.39 kcal, 95% CI 
30.02 to 38.76; see Appendix 7, available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.161152/-/DC1).
The rise in supply of caloric sweeteners including HFCS coin-
cided with an interruption in the long-term decline in total sugar 
and sweetener supply in Canada. Before NAFTA, total sugar sup-
ply was declining, mirroring cane and beet sugars. From 1994, 
trends in total sugars and cane and beet sugars diverged (Appen-
dix 8, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.161152/-/DC1). Supply of cane and beet sugars in Canada 
was on average 20.6 kcal/capita daily (95% CI 5.63 to –46.81) 
lower than before NAFTA, but supply of all sugars and sweeten-
ers was, on average, 21.05 kcal/capita daily (95% CI 0.95 to 41.15) 
higher. Caloric sweeteners including HFCS accounted for an 
increasing proportion of total sugar and sweeteners, rising from 
4.8% (95% CI 2.44 to 7.13) before NAFTA to 13.5% (95% CI 10.80 
to 16.11) after NAFTA.
Appendix 9 (available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.161152/-/DC1) also shows that net Canadian 
imports of beverage syrups doubled in the period after NAFTA 
(1994–2000), rising from 7132.4 metric tons in 1993 to 16 062.0 
tons in 2000 and claiming a growing share of total beverage 
syrup imports.
Synthetic control results
Table 2 shows that the characteristics of Canada and the syn-
thetic control before NAFTA were very similar in terms of predic-
tors of caloric sweetener supply.
Figure 1 shows that the trend in supply of sweetener syrups 
was very similar in Canada and its control before NAFTA but, 
after NAFTA accession, the 2 diverge: supply accelerates in Can-
ada, but in the control, estimated supply remains similar to that 
pre-NAFTA. On average, supply of caloric sweeteners was 43.7 
kcal/capita daily higher in Canada compared with the control in 
the post-NAFTA period.
Robustness checks
Figure 2 and Appendix 10 (available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/
suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.161152/-/DC1) plot the results from the 
in-space placebo analysis of model robustness and show that the 
difference in supply before and after NAFTA far exceeds the dif-
ference in any other country.
We examined whether our choice of comparison countries 
could explain our results, by iteratively excluding each country 
from the sample, and by estimating our results including only 
OECD countries that were not European Economic Area mem-
bers. The results were consistent with our main analysis, which 
suggests that our findings are not attributable to our choice of 
comparison countries and differences in trade instruments 
(Appendices 11–12, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.161152/-/DC1). Further tests analyzed the 
potential influence on our results of predictor imbalance, serial 
correlation, a pre-intervention dip, changes in exports of other 
caloric sweeteners, changes to investment and unobserved fac-
tors that occurred when NAFTA was implemented (Appendix 12). 
The results did not qualitatively affect our results.

Interpretation
We show that tariff reductions on HFCS-containing food and syr-
ups in NAFTA were associated with a 41.6 (95% CI 25.06 to 58.21) 
kcal/capita daily increase in the supply in Canada of caloric 
sweeteners including HFCS. These findings were robust to addi-
tional sensitivity analyses, and are consistent with previous stud-
ies which find that countries enacting trade deals with the US 
experience changes in their food environments.18,38
Our study advances existing research in 3 important ways. 
First, we isolate a specific mechanism through which FTAs can 
affect diets: import tariffs. We have shown that a small and 
potentially inconspicuous change to tariffs can precipitate a sub-
stantial change to peoples’ diets, including increased consump-
tion of HFCS. The population-wide consequences for public 
health are potentially enormous. This rise in HFCS consumption 
was correlated with a large rise in obesity rates, from 5.6% in 
1985 to 14.8% in 1998.39 Rates of obesity among Canadians now 
rank among the highest of advanced industrialized nations that, 
unlike Canada, do not have trade agreements with the United 
States.40 The period after NAFTA also corresponded with rises in 
the prevalence of diabetes from 3.3% to 5.6%, from 1998/99 to 
2008/09.41 Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that 
US trade relations may have been an underlying population-level 
factor contributing to Canada’s comparatively high rates of obe-
sity, diabetes and noncommunicable diseases, through 
increased population-level exposure to added sugars.
Second, our analysis provides more robust evidence that 
these associations are causal. We have used rigorous quasi-
experimental methods to overcome potential confounding that 
is not addressed in the majority of previous research. Third, we 
identified that the rise in HFCS supply coincided with a decline in 
cane and beet sugar supply and a pause in the long-term decline 
in total sugar and sweetener supply. This suggests that total 
sugar and sweetener supply was higher in Canada after NAFTA 
than it might have been without NAFTA. This also suggests that 
trade agreements that apply greater tariff reductions on poten-
tially hazardous food items may catalyze a “hazardous substitu-
tion effect,” in which populations replace less hazardous food 
items with more hazardous commodities that are subject to 
lower tariffs.
Our results have important implications for health policy. 
Trade agreements such as NAFTA are widely used macroeco-
nomic policy instruments.42 NAFTA has been held up as a blue-
print for future FTAs, including a potential new deal between the 
US and UK following its decision to leave the European Union, 
and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership 
between the US and the European Union, currently under negoti-
ation.43,44 However, our analysis of the effects of NAFTA raises 
concern that new trade deals could harm population health

should lower tariffs lead to increased supply and potential con-
sumption of unhealthy food items, particularly those containing 
HFCS. FTAs may well yield benefits, via higher incomes and 
improved food security, but may also lead to numerous harms.45 
Potential harms may be counteracted partially by targeted pub-
lic health policies. Yet, our analysis shows that small and seem-
ingly modest changes to tariffs can lead to a substantial rise in 
the supply of commodities like HFCS.
Limitations
Our analysis has several limitations. First, our study analyzes 
changes in 1 specific product category in a developed country. 
This limits the generalizability of our findings, but enables us to 
parse the specific policies and mechanisms linking FTAs to chang-
ing diets. Second, data limitations preclude the possibility of fully 
testing how US exports responded to tariffs and the impact of 
changing HFCS consumption on health outcomes. These effects 
are debated, although there are concerns that the corn and soft-
drink industries may distort evidence of the harms from HFCS.46 
Fourth, supply may be an imperfect measure of consumption 
because of difficulties in estimating wastage and home produc-
tion. Supply levels are nevertheless a widely used proxy for con-
sumption and are especially appropriate in market equilibrium 
when supply and demand are equal.47–50 Fifth, causal inferences 
from our quasi-experimental study are limited, as with any statis-
tical analysis with observational data. Finally, it is possible that 1 
or more important events took place in Canada at the same time 
as NAFTA and accounted for our findings. We attempted to 
address this possibility using additional placebo studies and sen-
sitivity analyses that did not qualitatively affect our results.
Conclusion
These limitations notwithstanding, we find evidence that lower 
tariffs following NAFTA were associated with increased supply 
and likely consumption of caloric sweeteners in Canada includ-
ing potentially hazardous HFCS. This has important implications 
elsewhere. This should be taken into account by countries nego-
tiating future trade agreements.
