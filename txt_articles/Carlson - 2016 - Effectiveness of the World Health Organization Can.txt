Abstract: Inadequate cancer pain relief has been documented extensively across historical 
records. In response, in 1986, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed guidelines for 
cancer pain treatment. The purpose of this paper is to disseminate the results of a comprehensive, 
integrative review of studies that evaluate the effectiveness of the WHO guidelines. Studies were 
included if they: 1) identified patients treated with the guidelines, 2) evaluated self-reported pain, 
3) identified instruments used, 4) provided data documenting pain relief, and 5) were written 
in English. Studies were coded for duration of treatment, definition of pain relief, instruments 
used, findings related to pain intensity or relief, and whether measures were used other than 
the WHO analgesic ladder. Twenty-five studies published since 1987 met the inclusion criteria. 
Evidence indicates 20%–100% of patients with cancer pain can be provided pain relief with the 
use of the WHO guidelines – while considering their status of treatment or end-of-life care. Due 
to multiple limitations in included studies, analysis was limited to descriptions. Future research 
to examine the effectiveness of the WHO guidelines needs to consider recommendations to 
facilitate study comparisons by standardizing outcome measures. Recent studies have reported 
that patients with cancer experience pain at moderate or greater levels. The WHO guidelines 
reflect the knowledge and effectual methods to relieve most cancer pain, but the guidelines are 
not being adequately employed. Part of the explanation for the lack of adoption of the WHO 
guidelines is that they may be considered outdated by many because they are not specific to the 
pharmacological and interventional options used in contemporary pain management practices. 
The conundrum of updating the WHO guidelines is to encompass the latest pharmacological 
and interventional innovations while maintaining its original simplicity.

Introduction
Cancer is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with ∼14 million 
new cases and 8 million cancer-related deaths in 2012.1 Furthermore, the International 
Agency for Research on Cancer estimates the number of new cases to rise by ∼75% over 
the next two decades. More than 50% of people diagnosed with cancer will experience 
physical pain and of those people, more than one-third will experience moderate-to-
severe pain levels.2,3 The estimated increase in the incidence and prevalence of cancer 
supports the prediction of an increase in the number of people with pain caused by 
the disease and its treatment.
Historically, the continued prevalence and extreme intensity of cancer pain expe-
rienced by patients have been documented via numerous international epidemiologic 
studies. More than 40 years ago, Marks and Sachar4 found that 75% of patients

 experienced cancer pain in spite of analgesics ordered by 
health care providers. Inadequate cancer pain relief was 
reconfirmed in later studies.5–8 After recognition of an inter-
national problem, the World Health Organization (WHO) 
responded by the wide distribution of the WHO Cancer 
Pain Relief guidelines in 1986,9 herein, referred to as the 
WHO guidelines, and subsequently updated the guidelines 
a decade later.10 The main element of the WHO guidelines 
established medical management of cancer pain with a 
three-step ladder (Figure 1). The purpose of the ladder was 
to make pain relief available readily to patients with cancer 
with advanced disease by using effective and inexpensive 
drugs administered regularly, orally, and on an individual 
basis while also focusing on safety.11 In addition, the WHO 
guidelines were to facilitate and legitimize the use of “strong” 
opioids (ie, morphine and its derivatives) in regions of the 
world where the use of these medications was unacceptable 
or illegal.11,12
Despite multiple translations and broad distribution of the 
WHO Cancer Pain Relief guidelines, inadequate pain relief 
still exists.13–16 The effectiveness of these guidelines needs 
to be evaluated to determine the underlying reason for the 
continuation of inadequate pain management despite medi-
cal advances in the past 28 years. The purpose of this paper 
is to disseminate the results of a comprehensive, integra-
tive review of studies that evaluate the effectiveness of the 
WHO guidelines. A key consideration in the evaluation of 
these studies is to differentiate between those individuals for 
whom the guidelines are effective and those for whom they 
are not. This distinction will aid in focusing future research 
and guideline considerations.
Two previous reviews of the effectiveness of the WHO 
guidelines were found in the literature.17,18 Jadad and 
Browman17 identified eight studies for review in 1995 and 
Ferreira et al18 identified 17 studies in 2006. Many of the 
same studies were included in both reviews. There were no 
randomized clinical trials in the reviews that could provide 
unbiased estimates of the proportion of patients for whom the 
WHO guidelines would be efficacious. Indirect measures of 
effectiveness of pain treatment, however, ranged from 45% 
to 100% within the two reviews. Multiple limitations were 
identified across the reviews, including small sample sizes, 
variable or short follow-up periods, and high exclusion or 
dropout rates. Jadad and Browman17 also concluded that 
there was a lack of homogeneous criteria across studies to 
assess pain and treatment outcomes to compare effectiveness 
of the WHO guidelines efficiently and accurately. Ferreira 
et al18 discussed that complete relief of pain is rarely achieved 
in patients with cancer experiencing cancer pain, but pain 
intensity or duration can be reduced while using the WHO 
guidelines. Effectiveness of the WHO guidelines was recog-
nized, but the extent and predictability of the effectiveness 
across studies were being questioned.17
This current paper expands what has previously been 
reviewed evaluating the WHO guidelines. In addition to 
critiquing previously published work for effectiveness of the 
guidelines, this review encompasses other pain measurement 
scales. This review categorizes adequate treatment effec-
tiveness as the pain intensity being 1) less than  
moderate; 
2) a visual analog scale (VAS), numerical rating scale (NRS), 
and verbal rating scale (VRS) score #3 on a 0–10 scale (or 30 
on a 0–100 point scale); or 3) a decrease in the pain intensity 
on the VAS, NRS, or VRS by 70% or more; a decrease in the 
Integrated Pain Score (IPS) by 70% or more; or an increase 
in pain relief by 70% or more. The present paper includes 
studies that were not evaluated by the previous reviews and 
includes studies that were published in the past decade. The 
present study included searching more resources than data-
bases and a manual search of reference lists.
Search methods
This review includes health professional literature published 
within a 28-year period between 1987 and May 2015. The 
timeline reflects the period that began immediately following 
release of the first guidelines from the WHO in 1986.
Four methods were used to identify studies for review. 
A comprehensive computer search was conducted using

indices of individual periodicals were searched using titles 
and abstracts that were established sources to publish reports 
of the evaluation of the WHO guidelines. These included 
Pain, Journal of Pain and Symptom Management, Cancer 
Nursing, Pain Management Nursing, and Oncology Nurs-
ing Forum. The Internet was searched using multiple search 
engines such as Google and Google Scholar, Yahoo, Bing, 
Webcrawler, and Ask.com. Multiple pain-related web pages 
were searched for abstracts and text related to the evaluation 
of WHO guidelines including, but not limited to, the WHO, 
International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), 
American Pain Society (APS), American Society of Pain 
Management Nurses (ASPMN), and the Pain and Policy 
Studies Group (PPSG). Finally, a comprehensive review of 
citations within included research studies were also searched 
for identification of further studies.
Research studies of any methodological design were 
included in this review if they: 1) specifically identified treat-
ment of adult patients with cancer with the WHO guidelines, 
2) evaluated patients’ self-reported cancer pain, 3) provided 
information on the instruments used to measure cancer pain 
relief, 4) provided data documenting changes in pain intensity 
via the VAS, NRS, VRS, or IPS after treatment or provided 
data documenting the proportion of patients experiencing 
adequate pain control/relief after treatment, and 5) were writ-
ten in English. Each eligible study available was reviewed and 
coded for the following information: author(s), publication 
year, title, source, study design, aims, sample population and 
size, dates of data collection, country of data collection, dura-
tion of treatment, definition of adequate pain relief, instru-
ments used to measure pain, methodology, findings related 
to pain intensity or relief, and whether additional measures 
for pain control were used other than the WHO analgesic 
ladder. The samples of the studies were evaluated for size, 
randomization, and reasons for termination/exclusion from 
the study. The quality of the data was evaluated accord-
ing to the aim(s) of the study, whether data were collected 
prospectively or retrospectively from the medical record, and 
the length of the study follow-up periods. The methodology 
was evaluated by the description of the target population 
and setting, demographic data of the sample reported, and 
presence of a control group.
Cooper’s guide for integrated literature reviews was 
used.19 Quality appraisal was not completed for this review 
because of a lack of randomized control studies. However, 
the methodology, bias, and threats to internal and external 
validity are summarized in the results section. Every study 
that met the inclusion criteria was included in the analysis.
Results
Forty-eight research studies were identified for review. Several 
studies shared the same population samples. According to 
Petitti,20 failure to exclude studies analyzing the same sample 
may cause bias in the magnitude of findings. Therefore, only 
studies using the most inclusive sample were included. For 
example, there were six studies using the same patient sample 
in Germany;21–26 only the latest and most inclusive study is 
included in the review.26 In order to ensure accuracy, commu-
nication with authors was completed. For example, according 
to Mercandante, the samples of patients were not the same 
in studies published in 199227 and 1999.28 Ten studies were 
removed from review due to overlap of population samples.
Several other studies were excluded as they evaluated the 
intensity/strength of the analgesic treatment of the patients’ 
reported pain using the pain management index (PMI) devel-
oped by Cleeland et al.29 While the PMI is based on the WHO 
recommendations for cancer pain relief, the studies using the 
PMI did not specify whether or not the treatment administered 
to the patients was based on the WHO guidelines. Without the 
use of the inclusion criteria language, the relationship to the 
WHO guidelines was not clear. Thus, 13 additional studies 
were not included. From the original 48 studies identified, 
25 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria.
In reviewing the 25 included studies, all of the studies 
used convenience samples, while only four of the convenience 
samples were randomized. The four studies that used random-
ized samples were for the purposes of evaluating the necessity 
of Step 2 of the WHO analgesic ladder30–32 (Figure 1) or the 
use of mild opiates.33 Nineteen of the studies were prospec-
tive studies, including six quasiexperimental studies in which 
four used comparison groups. Only two studies had a control 
group32,34 and one study was double-blind.35 Because of the 
lack of control groups throughout all but two of the 25 studies, 
meta-analysis was not performed. Therefore, content analysis 
of methods and findings is described narratively. Table 1

countries and 
261 patients with 
cancer pain in 
6 collaborating 
centers for 
implementation of 
WHO guidelines 
during 1984–1987.
Prospective, 
descriptive
To obtain background data on 
the current practice of pain 
management in selected centers; 
to determine the feasibility 
of using the WHO guidelines 
in selected clinics; to test the 
compliance with the WHO 
guidelines approach; to test 
the effectiveness of the WHO 
guidelines in individual patients 
based on pain reduction with 
minimal side effects.
Patients with cancer pain from 
centers without extensive 
exposure to WHO guidelines 
were compared to centers 
knowledgeable about the 
guidelines. Investigators were 
to complete a form requesting 
various data including patient 
self-assessment form for pain 
at first visit and a different form 
at each follow-up visits at the 
end of the first 2 weeks then at 
4-week intervals. If any change 
in therapy, patient was evaluated 
again in 2 weeks followed by 
4-week intervals until death. 
Mean duration of treatment was 
61 days for patients from non-
WHO centers and 34 for WHO 
centers.

Adequate pain relief was defined 
as “none” or “slight” pain.
Percentage of controlled pain (none or 
slight) was significant between groups 
after 1 month of treatment: 
•  
Control group had 49% of patients 
reporting controlled pain.
•  
WHO group had 76% controlled pain
No report of linear analog pain relief 
score as it was not understood and

 chronologically summarizes the individual research studies 
that measure the effectiveness of the WHO guidelines.
Findings from the longitudinal studies were classified 
into five categories: 1) the percentage of patient responses 
that demonstrated a reduction in the IPS, 2) the percentage 
of patient responses for whom the reduction in the VAS or 
NRS was stated or could be calculated, 3) the percentage 
 
of patient responses that were within the categories created 
from scores on the VAS or NRS that was considered as 
controlled pain or adequate pain relief, 4) the percentage of 
patient responses on the VRS of pain relief or the VRS of 
pain intensity that were considered as adequate pain relief, 
and 5) others that did not classify findings into the previous 
four categories.
Two studies used the IPS.36,37 The IPS was designed to take 
into account both pain intensity and duration when assessing 
patients’ pain. It is calculated by multiplying the hours of 
pain duration per day by the pain intensity using a 10-point 
VAS, NRS, or points assigned to a VRS. Thus, scoring of 
the IPS has a range of 0–240 possible points. In the first few 
days of treatment with the WHO guidelines, Wenk et al36 
found patients experienced a 70% reduction in the IPS,36 
while  
Ventafridda et al34 found patients experienced a 57% 
 
reduction.34 Progressive treatment led to an 81%–69% reduc-
tion in pain scores, respectively. Overall, the reduction in the 
IPS after initiation of treatment ranged from 57% to 81%.
Several of the studies reviewed used patient responses on 
either a VAS or NRS where the percentage of the pain reduc-
tion in the scores after initiation of treatment was stated or 
could be calculated.28,32,33,38–45 An analysis of the study results 
at one interval of measurement (∼3–7 days after treatment 
was initiated) demonstrated a 20%–71% reduction in the VAS 
or NRS from the baseline pain assessment. Upon the final 
interval of measurement, there was a 43%–81% reduction 
in the VAS or NRS from the baseline pain assessment. The 
interval length varied among studies but was .7 days after 
initiation of treatment.
Other studies reported the percentage of the categories 
considered as adequate pain relief or satisfactory pain intensity 
by dividing the patients’ responses for the VAS, NRS, or VRS 
into categories. For example, the pain intensity measured by a 
VAS (0–10 point) might be divided into cate 
gories of “none” 
(0 points), “mild” (1–3 points), “ 
moderate” (4–6 points), 
and “severe” (7–10 points), where “none” or “mild” pain 
might be considered as adequate pain relief. Likewise, on a 
four point VRS, the categories of “none” or “mild” might be 
considered as adequate pain relief. Results from these studies 
were reported according to the percentage of patients in each 
category. Mercadante et al27 used a VAS and reported that 81% 
of the patients without incidental pain had “no pain” or “mild 
pain” at the time of their death, but only 50% of the patients 
who experienced incidental pain had “no pain” or “mild pain” 
at the time of their death.  
Ventafridda et al34 using a VRS 
reported that 76% in their sample reported “none” or “slight” 
pain after 1 month of treatment. Zech et al,26 in a validation 
study of the WHO guidelines using a VRS, reported that 
72% of the patients had “no pain” or “mild pain” at the time 
of their death. Tsui et al44 reported that 88% of their patients 
were discharged with a VAS of #3 (0–10 scale), indicating 
that the patients experienced “no” pain or “mild” pain. Bhat-
nagar et al46 reported that 87% and 90% of patients had good 
pain relief (VAS ,3) at 1 month and 6 months, respectively. 
Of the studies that reported the percentage of the categories 
considered as adequate pain relief or satisfactory pain inten-
sity by dividing the patients’ responses for the VAS, NRS, or 
VRS into categories, 50%–90% of the patients experienced 
adequate pain relief.
Similar to other studies that categorized the degree 
of pain intensity, Takeda47 categorized the degree of pain 
reduction of patients’ responses on the VAS into three levels: 
complete relief (no pain), acceptable relief (.90% relief of 
pain or reduction of the scores), and partial relief (decrease 
in severity of pain, but a reduction of ,90%). At the end 
of an unknown duration of treatment, 97% of the sample 
reported complete (86%) or acceptable (11%) relief from 
pain. Inclusion of the percentage of the categories considered 
as adequate pain relief determined by Takeda47 into the range 
compiled from the other studies that reported the percentage 
of the categories considered as adequate pain relief (“none” 
or “mild” pain) indicates that 50%–97% of the patients 
experienced adequate pain relief.
Unlike studies that reported the percentage of VAS reduc-
tion of pain, Minotti et al35 and Keskinbora et al31 reported 
patients’ mean scores of pain intensity using the VAS after 
treatment only. These studies did not report pain levels 
before the introduction of the WHO guidelines. One of the 
inclusion criteria for the studies, however, was that patients’ 
scores of pain using the VAS (0–100 points) were .40 or the 
 
NRS .4 (0–10 points). After 7 days of treatment, Minotti 
et al35 reported that the mean of the patients’ scores using 
the VAS was ,40. Keskinbora et al31 demonstrated graphi-
cally that the patients treated with an adjuvant in addition 
to an opioid experienced a mean pain of ,4 on days 4 and 
13 after initiation of treatment with the WHO guidelines. 
The reduction in pain was statistically significant between 
patients who received an opioid and an adjuvant and those

 patients who received an opioid only for their cancer pain. 
The percentage of reduction in pain intensity was not pro-
vided and could not be calculated from information provided 
within the two studies.
Siguan et al48 used a pain reduction scale (PRS) to survey 
the patients with cancer pain. With this scale, the respondents 
had the option of indicating whether they had 0%, 25%, 
50%, 75%, or 100% pain relief. At the end of an unreported 
duration of treatment, 86% of respondents stated that they 
had at least a 75% pain reduction and 96% had at least a 
50% pain reduction. Similarly, Vielvoye-Kerkmeer et al49 
had respondents rate the effectiveness of their treatment as 
“poor”, “moderate”, “good”, or “excellent”. In their study, 
69%–71% of patients rated their pain relief as “good” or 
“excellent”.
Zech et al,26 Meuser et al,41 and Maltoni et al30 used other 
methods of evaluating effectiveness of treatment with the 
WHO guidelines. In addition to reporting the patients’ mean 
pain scores of the VAS or NSR at baseline and after treatment, 
the first two studies also categorized pain relief according 
to the number of days the patient experienced severe pain. 
Thus, if the patient reported their average pain to be severe, 
very severe, or maximal on ,10% of days, treatment effec-
tiveness was defined as “good”; on 10%–30% of days as 
“satisfactory”; and on .30% of days as “inadequate”. With 
these categories, Meuser et al41 found 86% of the patients and 
Zech et al26 found 88% of the patients experienced “good” 
or “satisfactory” pain relief effectiveness. A third study by 
Maltoni et al30 described the percentage of days with worst 
pain that was $5 on the NRS (0–10 points). Maltoni et al30 
reported that on 9%–29% of the days, patients experienced 
moderate-to-severe pain. Using the criteria from Zech et al26 
and Meuser et al,41 100% of the patients in the study by 
Maltoni et al30 experienced “satisfactory” or “good” treat-
ment effectiveness with the WHO guidelines. The range of 
the pain relief effectiveness of the three studies ranged from 
86% to 100%.
In the reviewed studies, the overall effectiveness of the 
WHO Cancer Pain Relief guidelines was found to range from 
20% to 100%. The effectiveness identified in the majority 
of the studies was .50%. The broad range of effectiveness 
is dependent upon many measurement factors, including the 
intensity of the pain, the pain instrument used, the duration of 
treatment, and the outcome variable of pain relief/control.
Discussion
The overall literature rating is suggestive of a relationship 
between the WHO guidelines and pain relief. Evidence 
from research indicates 20%–100% of patients with cancer 
pain – considering their status of treatment or end-of-life 
care – can be provided adequate pain relief with application 
of the WHO guidelines, with a majority of studies  
identifying 
relief .50%.
Various means of reporting outcomes were used. A reduc-
tion of 57%–81% was reported using patient responses with 
the IPS after treatment with the WHO guidelines. The NRS 
and VAS were reportedly reduced in the range of 20%–81% 
after treatment across levels of severity of pain. Studies that 
placed patients’ responses into categories that described 
the pain intensity experienced reported that 50%–90% of 
the patients experienced “none” or “mild” pain after treat-
ment with the WHO guidelines. Other studies reported that 
the mean intensity experienced by patients was ,4 or 40 
(depending on whether scale was based upon 0–10 points 
or 0–100 points), indicating full effectiveness of the WHO 
guidelines. Other studies reported that 69%–86% of the 
patient responses indicated that patients experienced at least 
75% pain relief or felt that their pain control was “good” or 
“excellent” after treatment. Effectiveness of the WHO guide-
lines was reported between 86% and 100% for patients who 
were experiencing “severe”, “very severe”, or “ 
maximal” 
pain on 0%–30% of the treatment days. This review demon-
strated that pain could be reduced or eliminated in a great 
majority of the patients when they receive treatment based 
on the WHO guidelines.
No other guidelines have had the profound effect on 
cancer pain as the WHO guidelines.12,50,51 Because only 
one study met inclusion criteria after 2008, it is questioned 
whether this finding indicates recognition of the WHO 
guidelines, and hence a decreased need for publications 
of their effectiveness or the acceptance of the treatment of 
cancer pain with opioids.32 The timeframe correlates with 
the publication of the European Association for Palliative 
Care guidelines52,53 and the American Pain Society guidelines 
for cancer pain treatment.54,55 These agency guidelines have 
recognized the worldwide problem of cancer pain, com-
bined with the increasing availability of different opioids, 
opioid preparations, and interventional procedures during 
the last 20 years. These agencies have tried to update the 
international guidelines on the management of cancer pain 
while focusing on the role of opioids. The WHO guidelines, 
though not as specific in direction, encompass a clear and 
simple approach that has an educational value and is easily 
remembered and disseminated. Regardless of the age of the 
WHO guidelines, they still are the cornerstone for cancer pain 
treatment worldwide. Unfortunately, many practitioners are

 not using the WHO guidelines and some do not know what 
the WHO guidelines entail.56,57 The clear message resonating 
from the effectiveness of the WHO guidelines is that they 
are an effective and cost-effective means to provide cancer 
pain relief.
Limitations
In the reviewed studies, it was not always specified whether 
the WHO analgesic ladder or the entire WHO guidelines 
were being investigated. The language regarding the usage 
of the ladder or the full guideline was often not stated. Five 
studies treated patients with the ladder only or eliminated 
the study participants who underwent additional treatment 
that might affect pain perception. Eleven of the reviewed 
studies included patients who were also being treated with 
antineoplastic treatment, intrathecal analgesics, neurolytic 
procedures, or surgical procedures, while others did not 
specify if the patients underwent additional treatment. As the 
WHO guidelines endorse the use of other treatment modali-
ties than the analgesic ladder if needed, the guidelines should 
be investigated in its entirety. Some experts suggest that the 
WHO analgesic ladder has a fourth and/or fifth step that 
may include a step for interventional procedures, including 
nerve blocks, neurolytic blocks, spinal stimulators, and epi-
durals11,12,58 or a step for opioid switching that includes both 
pain and side effects as criteria for switching analgesics.59 It 
can be argued that having the interventional nerve blocks at 
a later step implies they should be used last. Evidence exists 
that the nerve blocks may be more effective if considered 
earlier.60,61 Thus, like adjuvant analgesics, they may need 
to be considered at any step and so may need to be placed 
alongside the ladder rather than a separate step.
Summarization of the studies proved to be challenging 
due to different methods of measuring pain, variations in 
defining the acceptable levels of treatment effectiveness, 
and missing data. Multiple instruments with different scales 
and values described pain intensity. Pain intensity was rated 
according to IPS, VAS, NRS, VRS, and PRS. Particularly, the 
use of the IPS made it very difficult to compare pain treat-
ment effectiveness between studies since a score of 20 may 
indicate a range of severe pain for 2 hours or mild pain for 20 
hours. Since duration and intensity were a combined score, 
this type of scoring made it unfeasible to compare the pain 
treatment effectiveness with other studies and to determine 
whether adequate treatment effectiveness was achieved. 
Similarly, reporting pain relief according to the number of 
days the patient experienced severe or very severe pain made 
comparisons unrealistic. Even the same type of scale may 
have had multiple interval labeling systems associated with 
them. For instance, the VRS may have had four or six points. 
The variability in the methods of measuring pain or pain 
treatment effectiveness made comparisons difficult.
Moreover, the studies reviewed categorized the results 
according to various operational definitions of adequate or 
inadequate pain treatment effectiveness. This review catego-
rizes adequate treatment effectiveness as the pain intensity as 
being 1) less than moderate, 2) a VRS or NRS as #3 (or 30 
on a 0–100 point scale), or 3) a decrease in the pain intensity/
increase of pain relief by 70% or more. In addition, some 
data were not reported in the reviewed studies, which may 
have made comparisons easier. A more accurate comparison 
could have been made if data from all instruments had been 
discussed.
Many studies had high exclusion and/or attrition rates. 
For instance, in Ventafridda et al,34 64% and 31% of the 
cases in the two groups investigated in the study had to be 
excluded from the study due to incomplete data collection, 
incomplete recording of patient assessment, or inappropriate 
timeliness in the follow-up. Incomplete data collection also 
was problematic in other studies.36,42 Given the population 
studied, some reasons for attrition were death,27,34,36,38,41,48,49 
ineffective analgesia,35 intolerable side effects,35,48,49 as well as 
lost to follow-up,26,28,33,34,36,41,48 pain absence or resolution,33,41 
low patient compliance,28,41 change of therapy,35 patient being 
treated by another practitioner or facility,28,41,48 discharged,36 
financial constraints,48 physician error,48 and patient receiving 
other treatments.35,41
Although it can be concluded that management of cancer 
pain as recommended by WHO is effective for a majority of 
patients, the research designs of the studies in the literature 
review were retrospective, descriptive, and/or quasiex-
perimental rather than randomized controlled trials (RCT). 
A relationship between these two factors is consistent with 
the knowledge generated in prior pain relief investigations, as 
it is a combination of pain management knowledge acquired 
through multiple sources that is being tested with the WHO 
guidelines. Although the relationship between WHO guide-
lines and pain relief is plausible and likely, the predictive 
quality of experimental designs with RCT is missing, and the 
subsequent ability to predict the effectiveness of the WHO 
guidelines through evidence-based certainty is lacking.11
Additional methodological limitations other than design 
are noted. Because of the population, most studies of oncol-
ogy patients employ convenience samples, and thus, find-
ings are not generalizable. For example, it is possible for 
patients with cancer who are hospitalized to more likely be

                               1 / 1
 experiencing severe pain than those who are not hospitalized. 
Similarly, some studies included patients with severe pain 
only.27,30,31,49 Achieving adequate pain relief may be more 
difficult in more severe cases. Therefore, the studies measur-
ing the effectiveness of the WHO guidelines in reducing the 
intensity of cancer pain in hospitalized patients or patients 
who are only experiencing severe pain cannot be generalized 
to all patients with cancer.
Many of the samples were drawn from one institution 
in one country. Sampling populations from one institution 
and generalizing the findings globally are inappropriate as 
several other factors such as availability of different opioids 
may affect the adequacy of pain relief. Furthermore, many 
studies included only patients treated by cancer specialists; 
patients treated by practitioners without oncology training 
may be more likely to experience inadequate pain relief. The 
convenience samples in these studies may produce different 
findings than a randomized sample from a large, international 
cancer pain patient population.
In the reviewed studies, the sample sizes of persons with 
cancer pain vary, but many samples are small. The results 
from this limited sample size, especially with convenience 
sampling, may differ from the population. As with drawing 
from one-institution samples, the small samples may allow 
some variables to affect the results, such as the practitio-
ner, local practices and beliefs, and economic or social 
influences. With small sample sizes, a few patients who 
improved dramatically while receiving care utilizing the 
WHO guidelines may alter the mean improvement of the 
group even if other patients perceived little or no benefit 
with treatment. Small sample sizes, especially combined 
with convenience sampling, render widespread generaliza-
tions inappropriate.
Other methodological problems with measuring cancer 
pain can be revealed in this review. In longitudinal studies 
of cancer pain, maturation occurs over time as the disease 
progresses. It may be difficult to demonstrate an effect of 
an intervention to decrease incidence and intensity of pain 
as the pain changes with disease remission or progression. 
In addition, longitudinal data collection intervals varied 
greatly. The length of time between data point assessments 
 
following implementation of the WHO guidelines and the 
length of follow-up varied between having only one addi-
tional assessment at 1 week after treatment to recording data 
until death, which may entail follow-up for several months. 
 
Testing effects may also be prominent, as many studies did not 
identify the ability of those who collected the data. Overall, 
the multiple methodological problems identified potentially 
lead to less accuracy in the individual study results and makes 
comparisons between studies difficult.
In reviewing the literature, several of the studies 
 
operationally defined adequate pain relief as experiencing 
moderate pain or less pain. Although complete relief is the 
goal of cancer pain management; sometimes, it is not pos-
sible. An acceptable level of pain should be below moderate 
pain. With moderate or greater pain, there are often marked 
negative changes in physical or emotional functioning that 
interferes with the patient’s quality of life.15,62,63 Therefore, 
the delineation of adequate pain relief should be within the 
mild or no pain categories.
In order to measure pain and compare results more 
consistently, a well-established, international pain measure-
ment instrument needs to be used. Difficulty is encountered 
when comparing various pain intensity measurements as it is 
unknown whether methods of measuring pain and reporting 
pain relief affect the results of studies. For example, a dif-
ference between an individual’s responses on VRS may not 
correlate with responses on a pain relief scale. Future studies 
are needed to correlate these measures.
Additional research also is needed to compare methods 
of reporting pain relief between those reported from pain 
intensity scales to pain relief scales. Likewise, it is under-
standable that not only the intensity but also the duration of 
pain needs to be measured, but placing these two concepts 
in one index, such as done in the IPS, may cause misinter-
pretation of the effects of the pain experience on the patient. 
Perhaps, reporting the intensity and duration in addition to 
the IPS might be more informative.
The number of points on a VRS and the terms used on 
the scale need to be standardized so that findings between 
studies can be compared. The standardized VRS should then 
be correlated with the NRS so the findings with the two dif-
ferent types of scales can be compared more consistently. 
Finally, in order to have more accurate results and be able to 
compare studies, the patient rather than medical personnel or 
family should complete the pain measurement instruments. 
Standardization in pain management instrumentation and in 
its completion would allow more consistent measurement, 
reporting, and comparison between future studies.
New studies using experimental designs with randomized 
control groups would support the strength of the relationship 
between the WHO guidelines and cancer pain relief. Accord-
ing to Oxman et al,64 WHO recommendations are usually 
not based on systematic reviews of the literature but rely 
heavily on experts in a particular specialty such as cancer 
pain management. Since the release of the WHO guidelines,

 a lack of rigor in studies, especially in methodological design, 
contributes to limitation in generalizability of the published 
results.11 Debates regarding the effectiveness of the WHO 
guidelines remain due to the lack of RCTs. Although RCTs 
demonstrating a relationship between the WHO guidelines 
and cancer pain relief are conspicuously absent, there were 
no evidence-based alternatives supported by RCTs found in 
the literature that were superior to the WHO guidelines.
The first debate about the effectiveness of the guidelines 
revolves around the utility of Step 2 of the WHO ladder.11,65 
Proof of the effectiveness of weak opioids is lacking, espe-
cially since a limitation of using weak opioids is that there 
is a ceiling effect.11 A ceiling effect occurs when an increase 
in dose does not produce a decrease in pain. In an attempt to 
avoid using weak opioids, Nunes et al32 found that a higher 
incidence of adverse effects occurred when the second step 
of the ladder was omitted and patients were administered 
morphine initially. Thus, Step 2 may still be warranted, and 
future research is needed to explore its value.
A second debate of Step 2 includes the role of nonsteroi-
dal anti-inflammatory drugs.11 These medications may affect 
the gastrointestinal tract, platelets, and kidneys, resulting in 
negative side effects and possible toxicity. A third debate of 
Step 2 is the lack of criteria for switching from morphine to 
another opioid, including equianalgesic dosing and the choice 
of the subsequent opioid to be used.11,66 A fourth debate is 
that there are multiple new medications and new formula-
tions of older drugs that need to be investigated that considers 
their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties in 
patients experiencing cancer pain. Finally, adverse effects of 
these opioids need to be documented within the RCTs that 
explore them.
Suggesting rigorous RCTs challenges researchers, includ-
ing the WHO, to optimize and improve the guidelines or 
develop alternatives to ensure the highest possible proportion 
of patients with cancer pain experience pain relief. None-
theless, the implementation of RCT in studies of cancer pain 
management is not likely due to ethical and logistic reasons. 
First, to obtain accessibility to patients with cancer pain, con-
venience samples are often used. Second, the ability to control 
for extraneous variables in studies among international health 
care practices makes coordination of standards difficult for 
group comparisons. Third, a humane responsibility exists to 
provide optimal pain relief to all patients, and this renders 
a control group as being potentially ethically irresponsible. 
Fourth, given the publication of the WHO guidelines, it is 
unlikely that the treatment of a potential control group would 
not be influenced by the broad dissemination of the guidelines 
that has already occurred. Finally, experts in cancer pain 
management believe that the effort and expense of experi-
mental studies with control groups is unwarranted.67,68 This is 
based on the strength of the fundamental knowledge under-
lying the guidelines and the acceptance of these principles. 
Suggesting experimental designs with control groups is an 
ideal rather than a practical prospect in the actual environment 
of cancer pain management. RCTs are needed, however, when 
the effect and differences are smaller such as when comparing 
various drugs or routes.67 Comparison groups, gleaned from 
those treated in various environments, for example, where 
certain medications are not readily available, would allow for 
comparison of groups of patients with cancer. Also, data from 
those treated in the past decade or earlier could be compared 
to those treated currently.
Cluster randomization is a possible alternative to over-
come some of the challenges in getting RCTs regarding 
 
cancer pain relief. A cluster randomized controlled trial 
(CRT) is a type of RCT where groups of subjects and not 
individuals are randomized. The units of randomization 
are varied and can be clinics or hospitals, among others. 
Advantages include the ability to compare drugs head-to-
head within the same class rather than with placebos.69 CRT 
may relieve issues related to recruitment and self-selection 
and randomization of patients, thus allowing data collection 
and availability of results more quickly.69 The disadvantages 
to CRTs are the multitude of design choices and stratifica-
tion of the groups.70 The need for informed consent may be 
averted if the drug studied is the preferred drug in the cluster 
formulary, and so, ethical requirements for CRTs may need 
to be analyzed and modified.69
Several recent studies indicate inadequate cancer pain 
relief still exists, but these studies also fail to indicate if the 
WHO guidelines were being implemented during treatment.15 
A review of studies by Deandrea et al,71 that used the PMI, 
demonstrated that ∼43% of patients with cancer pain are 
undertreated. The PMI compares the intensity/strength of the 
analgesic treatment according to the WHO Analgesic Ladder 
with the patients’ reported pain. All studies demonstrated a 
negative PMI, indicating that the cancer pain is undertreated 
a majority of the time. Deandrea et al71 identified factors 
associated with a negative PMI that included publication 
before 2001; studies conducted in Europe or Asia; studies 
conducted in countries whose national income per capita was 
$40,000 per year or less; and patients being cared for in a 
general setting rather than a cancer-specific setting. Patients 
being treated by oncology subspecialists, however, have also 
been inadequately medicated for pain according to the WHO

 guidelines.15,45 Therefore, the use of the WHO guidelines in 
oncology specialty areas and by the oncologists themselves 
cannot be assumed. In future studies, the use of the WHO 
guidelines to treat patients with cancer with pain should be 
clearly stated, consistently applied, and then evaluated with 
the PMI. The results of the review by Deandrea et al71 suggest 
that the question might be how the WHO Analgesic Ladder 
is put into practice rather than its effectiveness.
Other methodological considerations would be to increase 
the sample size, follow a longitudinal design, use multiple 
institutions/agencies, and use more institution/agencies from 
within the USA, all of which are lacking. The sample size 
for future studies evaluating the effectiveness of the WHO 
guidelines needs to be increased. Five studies in this review 
had a sample size of ,50 subjects, and 13 additional studies 
had ,100 subjects. Weekly, longitudinal studies until study 
withdrawal would provide additional data to evaluation the 
effectiveness of the WHO guidelines in continued relief of 
cancer pain upon progression of the disease. Other cancer 
care centers need to be surveyed, especially in understudied 
countries. In the studies reviewed, for example, only part of 
one sample came from the USA. These considerations would 
increase the generalizability and reliability of the findings 
from future studies.
Conclusion
The studies evaluating the effectiveness of the WHO guide-
lines provide valuable information on the course of cancer pain 
and its treatment. From these findings, it can be concluded 
that the WHO guidelines are useful in promoting cancer pain 
relief. Evidence from research indicates at least 20%–100% 
of patients with cancer pain can be provided adequate 
pain relief across the span of their illness, from treatment- 
to-demise, with the application of WHO guidelines. Recent 
studies have reported that patients experiencing cancer pain 
at moderate or greater levels.2,3 While comparing the results 
of the recent studies describing the incidence and intensity 
of cancer pain, it can be assumed that the WHO guidelines 
have not been as widely adopted as would be expected since 
their initial release in 1986. The WHO guidelines reflect the 
knowledge and effectual  
methods to relieve most cancer 
pain, but the guidelines are not being adequately employed. 
Part of the explanation for the lack of adoption of the WHO 
guidelines is that they may be considered outdated by many 
because they are not specific to the pharmacological and 
interventional options used in contemporary pain management 
practices. The greatest attribute of the WHO guidelines is its 
simplicity, whereas, a thorough cancer pain guideline results 
in a complex document that might not be as useful and easy to 
disseminate. The conundrum of updating the WHO guidelines 
is to encompass the latest pharmacologic and interventional 
innovations while maintaining its original simplicity.
At the same time, the patients who have not had their can-
cer pain adequately relieved, even when the WHO guidelines 
have been employed, need further consideration in future 
research. The WHO guidelines have been successful in mak-
ing pain relief knowledge more globally available, but from 
a moral and ethical standpoint, these guidelines need to be 
promoted and examined until adequate pain relief is reported 
in all possible patients with cancer pain.
