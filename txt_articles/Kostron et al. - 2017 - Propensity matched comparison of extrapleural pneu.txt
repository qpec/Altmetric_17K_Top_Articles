Abstract
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this retrospective study was to assess perioperative outcomes, overall survival and freedom from recurrence
after induction chemotherapy followed by extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) or pleurectomy/decortication (P/D) in patients with meso-
thelioma in a propensity score matched analysis.
METHODS: Between September 1999 and August 2015, 167 patients received multimodality treatment (platinum-based chemotherapy
followed by EPP [n = 141] or P/D [n = 26]). We performed 2:1 propensity score matching for gender, laterality, epithelioid histological sub-
type and International Mesothelioma Interest Group (iMig) stage (52 EPP and 26 P/D).
RESULTS: Postoperative major morbidity (48% vs 58%, P = 0.5) was similar in both groups; however, the complication profile and severity
were different and favoured P/D; the 90-day mortality (8% vs 0%, P = 0.3) rate was lower in P/D although not statistically significant.
Prolonged air leak (>
_10 days) occurred in 15 patients (58%) undergoing P/D. The intensive care unit stay was significantly longer after EPP
(P = 0.001). Freedom from recurrence was similar for both groups (EPP: median 15 months, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10–21; P/D: 13
months, 95% CI: 11–17) (P = 0.2). Overall survival was significantly longer for patients undergoing P/D (median 32 months, 95% CI: 29–35)
compared to EPP (23 months, 95% CI: 21–25) (P = 0.031), but in the P/D group many cases were censored (73%) and the follow-up time
was relatively short.
CONCLUSIONS: P/D and EPP seem to have similar rates of major morbidity, although the profile of complications is different and more
severe after EPP. Freedom from recurrence is comparable in both groups whereas improved overall survival needs to be confirmed in a
large patient group with longer follow-up.

INTRODUCTION
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive neo-
plasm of
the
pleura that has
a poor
prognosis without
treatment [1].
Multimodality treatment led to improved overall survival (OS)
in mesothelioma patients in past decades [2–5]. However, the
exact role and type of surgery remain controversial. Two major
types of operations have evolved: extrapleural pneumonectomy
(EPP) and pleurectomy/decortication (P/D). EPP is the most rad-
ical operation, resecting en bloc both pleural layers, lung, peri-
cardium and diaphragm. P/D is a lung-sparing resection of the
pleura and, in selected cases, resection of the pericardium and/
or the diaphragm (referred to as extended P/D) [6].
However, the precise role and preferred type of surgery cannot be
determined conclusively from the current literature because no
randomized clinical trials are available. The International Mesothelioma
Interest Group (iMig) group recently concluded that ‘based on the cur-
rent literature and the IASLC (International Association for the Study of
Lung Cancer) report, surgery by either P/D or EPP, with the goal of
obtaining a macroscopic complete resection (MCR), should be per-
formed in the multimodality treatment of MPM’ [7].
The objective of this retrospective study was to assess perio-
perative outcomes, OS and freedom from recurrence (FFR) after
induction chemotherapy followed by EPP or pleurectomy/decor-
tication (P/D) in patients with mesothelioma in a propensity
score matched analysis.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between September 1999 and August 2015, 432 patients were
treated at our hospital (Fig. 1) and 167 patients with the histopa-
thological diagnosis of MPM underwent multimodality treatment
consisting of platinum-based induction chemotherapy followed
by MCR. Final analysis was performed after propensity score
matching in a 2:1 ratio (EPP: n = 52 and P/D: n = 26). Median
follow-up time calculated from the first cycle of chemotherapy
was 21 months (range 3–121).
Local ethics committee approval was given for retrospective
analysis of the mesothelioma data base (StV 29-2009, EK-ZH
2012-0094).
Multimodality treatment concept
The decision about treatment modalities, including type of sur-
gery, was made by an interdisciplinary tumour board of sur-
geons, oncologists and radiologists. During the observation
period, different neo- and adjuvant protocols were applied; neo-
adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin/pemetrexed was imple-
mented as a standard treatment since the publication of results
indicating superior survival rates with this regimen [8] (platinum/
gemcitabine: EPP, n = 20 [38%]; P/D, n = 1 [4%]; platinum/peme-
trexed: EPP, n = 32 [62%]; P/D, n = 24 [92%]). At the time, adjuvant
radiotherapy was applied after EPP only in the context of our
Swiss multicentre randomized phase III SAKK trial [9]; 29 of 52
patients (56%) undergoing EPP received adjuvant radiotherapy
(of these, 6 patients were part of the SAKK 17/04 trial).
Operative technique
EPP and P/D were performed using standard procedures, and
MCR was achieved in all cases. The operation and the EPP proce-
dure were performed as described previously [10]. The P/D was
done via a lateral thoracotomy in the sixth intercostal space; the
parietal pleura was mobilized as a whole towards the hilum; and
the visceral pleura was then removed from all lobes including the
inter-lobar fissures. For extended P/D, the pericardium and/or
the diaphragm were resected depending on extent of tumour
infiltration, assessed by intraoperative frozen sections and by the
surgeon (two experienced surgeons). Reconstruction was per-
formed using a porcine pericardial patch (Supple Peri-GuardV
R
Pericardium with Apex ProcessingV
R, Synovis Surgical Innovations,
St. Paul, MN, USA) and Gore Tex patch (DualmeshV
R Biomaterial,
W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc., Flagstaff, AZ, USA) or Mersilene net
(Ethicon Mersilene, Polyester, Johnson & Johnson Intl, New
Brunswick, NJ, USA), respectively. Chest wall resection was per-
formed if tumour infiltration was confirmed by frozen section
(EPP: n = 3; P/D: n = 1) and reconstruction was done using a Gore
Tex Patch if necessary. After EPP and P/D, all patients were rou-
tinely transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of
advanced postoperative treatment requirements. One patient
who had P/D was monitored postoperatively in the intermediate
care unit. The criteria for release from the ICU to the ward
included extubation, cardiopulmonary stability and lack of rele-
vant complications.
Statistical analysis
After propensity score matching for gender, laterality, epithelioid
histological subtype, and iMig stage in a 2:1 ratio (EPP: n = 52;
P/D: n = 26), perioperative mortality rates (30- and 90-day), post-
operative morbidity rates, duration of ICU stay, and duration of
hospitalization were determined. Postoperative morbidity was
divided into major and minor morbidities; for definitions see
Tables 1 and 2.
The Fisher exact test was used for categorical variables and the
Mann–Whitney U-test, for continuous variables. Numbers are
shown as median and range if not otherwise stated. Median OS
and median FFR were assessed by Kaplan–Meier curves, and the
difference between the two treatment groups was analysed by
log rank-test. OS was calculated as the time between application
of the first cycle of chemotherapy and death or last follow-up.
FFR was calculated as the time between application of the first
cycle of chemotherapy and tumour progression. A P-value less
than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

 score matching was performed on a logit scale with a calliper of
0.2 using the package Matching in R (R Development Core
Team).
RESULTS
The EPP and P/D groups were matched using a 2:1 propensity
score-based matching process. A total of 52 patients from
the EPP and 26 patients from the P/D group (15 extended
P/D, 11 P/D) were available for analysis. Patient’s characteristics
did not differ significantly; however, patients undergoing EPP
were
significantly
younger
than
patients
undergoing
P/D
(Table 3).
Patients undergoing EPP or P/D had comparable major post-
operative morbidities (48% vs 58%, Fisher exact test P = 0.5) (see
Table 1). Major morbidities for the EPP group were empyema
(30%), bronchopleural fistula (BPF) (23%), chylothorax (10%) and
patch failure (2%) whereas prolonged air leak (>
_10 days)
accounted for most major morbidities in the P/D group and was
present in 15 patients (58%) (Table 1). Median time until chest
tube removal in patients with prolonged air leak was 22 days
(range: 10–34). Empyema developed in 1 patient after P/D (4%),
presenting with a concomitant prolonged air leak (25 days).

 Empyema after EPP was associated primarily with BPF (12
patients) but also presented without BPF (4 patients). Late
empyema after EPP (>30 days) was observed more often than
early empyema (12 vs 4 patients). Reoperation was performed
more often after EPP (44% vs 27%, P = 0.2; see Table 4).
Indications for reoperation included empyema, BPF, chylothorax,
patch failure and haemothorax in patients who had EPP whereas
the sole indication for reoperation in patients after P/D was
empyema. All patients with empyema underwent accelerated
empyema treatment [11] with repetitive debridement and place-
ment of a muscle or omental flap; open-window thoracostomy
was avoided in all cases. A pulmonary embolism that occurred
46 days after discharge from the hospital was the cause of death
of 1 patient treated with EPP. Pneumonia was observed in
1 patient after P/D, and acute respiratory distress syndrome
was observed in 1 patient from each group. The postoperative
ICU stay was significantly longer for patients who had EPP (3
days [1–21] vs 2 days [0–19], P = 0.001; see Table 4). For minor
morbidities, see Table 2.
The 30-day mortality rate was similar in both groups (2% vs
0%,
P = 1.0)
(Table
1)
whereas
the
90-day
mortality
rate
tended to be higher in patients who had EPP (8% vs 0%,
P = 0.3). Causes of death up to 90 days postsurgery included
septic multiorgan failure (EPP, Day 63), pulmonary embolism
(EPP, Day 46), cardiogenic shock (EPP, Day 20) and tumour
progression (EPP, Day 85).
Long-term oncological outcomes
FFR was comparable for both groups, although lower in the EPP
group (EPP: median 15 months; 95% CI: 10–21 months; P/D:
median 13 months; 95% CI: 11–17 months) (P = 0.3). OS seemed
to be longer for patients undergoing P/D compared to those
having EPP (P/D: median 32 months; 95% CI: 29–35 months vs
EPP: median 23 months; 95% CI: 21–25 months; P = 0.03).
However, 19 patients (73%) were censored (Fig. 2).
DISCUSSION
Although rates of morbidity were similar between the EPP and
P/D groups in this propensity score matched analysis, severity and
profile of complications were different. Moreover, long-term
oncological outcome was difficult to interpret because many
patients were censored, previous data were confirmed [12], and
FFR may be shorter after P/D whereas OS seems to be comparable
with both techniques. In the absence of randomized data, we
applied this study concept using a propensity score-based match-
ing for iMig stage as well as for other known prognostic fac-
tors (gender, histological subtype [1] and
laterality of the
disease [13]).
The long-lasting debate on the role of each of the two techni-
ques cannot be answered definitely from the current literature,

 because the available data are significantly heterogeneous and
inconsistent [12–14]. The different treatment algorithms used and
the different experience levels of the centres involved as well as
the inconsistency of nomenclature and definitions are the main
problems; the latter has been addressed recently, and uniform
definitions have been suggested for P/D [6]. Furthermore, the
heterogeneity of the disease itself, especially the unpredictable
biological behaviour, cannot be considered in these studies. In
the largest meta-analysis, which included 24 studies with 1512
patients after P/D and 1391 patients after EPP, just over half of
the studies (53%) favoured EPP in terms of oncological outcomes
whereas 47% favoured P/D [12]. A different meta-analysis includ-
ing 7 more congruent studies with 632 and 513 patients for EPP
and P/D, respectively, concluded that P/D seems to have similar,
if not superior, long-term survival rates [15]. Data on postopera-
tive morbidity and short-term mortality, however, favour P/D,
showing more postoperative complications and significantly
higher 30-day mortality rates after EPP [12, 15]. Nonetheless, the
data on mortality and morbidity remain extremely heterogene-
ous due to differences in the patient cohorts and in definitions of
morbidity.
According to our results, both procedures appear to have simi-
lar rates of major morbidity: the rates of 48% and 58% for EPP
and P/D in experienced centres are comparable to published
data ranging from 10% to 82.6% and 5.9% to 55%, respectively
[14]. Each operation has its specific set of possible and frequent
complications that derive from the actual principles of each
operation and are therefore not directly comparable, whereas
after EPP, complications can quickly become life threatening.
Whereas BPF exists only after EPP, prolonged air leak can only
occur after P/D; empyema derived from BPF in most cases, but
also occurred without BPF in 4 patients undergoing EPP and in 1
patient having undergone P/D, which, in this case, might be trig-
gered by a prolonged air leak with ascending infection via the
chest drains. Our rate of empyema after EPP, which is higher
than that reported in the literature, may be improved by prophy-
lactic coverage of the bronchial stump with viable tissue.
Reoperations were performed more frequently after EPP for indi-
cations such as empyema, BPF, chylothorax, patch failure and
severe haemorrhage whereas reoperation for the closure of a
prolonged air leak was never necessary. A prolonged air-leak,
however, was present more frequently in our series (58%) than in
series from previously published studies, ranging from 13.5% to
33.3% [16–18]. This large discrepancy may derive from heteroge-
neous definitions and even more so from a not yet standardized
procedure with different extents of decortication or the fact that
some groups do not count prolonged air-leak as a major mor-
bidity. Our own experience shows that rigorous decortication
that includes the whole surface of the lung as well as the inter-
lobar fissures, even if no macroscopic tumour is observed, is
important, because fresh-frozen sections taken during the opera-
tion confirmed the presence of tumour in these parts of the
pleura.
Our
results
concerning
perioperative
deaths
compare
extremely favourably with those in the published literature; we
observed a 2% 30-day mortality rate after EPP and zero 30-day
deaths after P/D compared with data from a systematic review
reporting 3.2%–12.5% and 0%–9.8% 30-day mortality rates
for EPP and P/D, respectively [14]. However, 90-day mortality
data have been shown to be a better estimate for the risk of a
thoracic operation [19]; recent data from the UK show a 13.5%
90-day mortality rate for EPP and 9.2% mortality rate for P/D
[18]. Our results were strikingly low, with 8.0% and 0.0% 90-day
mortality rates for EPP and P/D, respectively, even though they
were not significantly higher after EPP. The low 90-day mortality
rate on the one hand and the high rate of empyema in the EPP
group on the other hand may partially be explained by the good
outcomes of our accelerated empyema treatment concept; in
other words, patients who might have died of empyema in other
centres may survive in our centre because of this treatment
option [11].
Long-term survival seemed to be better after P/D in our study:
FFR after P/D (13 months, 95% CI: 10–16) was similar to FFR after
EPP (15 months, 95% CI: 10–21); OS, however, tended to be lon-
ger in patients having undergone P/D (32 months 95% CI: 29–35)
compared to patients having undergone EPP (23 months, 95% CI:
21–25). As described previously, the paradoxical behaviour of
better OS despite earlier local recurrence may be multifactorial
and may derive from a lower operative mortality rate for P/D but
especially also from a better tolerability of disease progression

 needing further treatment when both lungs are in place; this
argument is, however, purely hypothetical. Moreover, these
results have to be viewed critically because of the small sample
size and the many censored cases in the P/D group.
A quality of life assessment is not available for all patients
included in this study; therefore no definitive statements about
the effect of each procedure on quality of life can be made.
However, it has previously been suggested that quality of life
may be less affected by P/D than by EPP [17, 20, 21]. We agree
that a prolonged air leak might have a lesser impact on quality of
life than empyema, BPF and the need for reoperation.
The role of surgery as part of the multimodality concept has
been debated heavily since the results of the MARS trial were
published [22]. However, the underpowered design and the high-
postoperative mortality rates made these results questionable
[23]. We could not address the role of surgery itself in this study,
because no un-operated group from our database could be
matched for iMig stage. However, with a median OS of 22 and
32 months for EPP and P/D, respectively, both techniques seem
to be at least as good as chemotherapy only with a median OS of
19.5 months published in the MARS trial [22].
We are aware of several limitations of this study. First, the pro-
tocol of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen changed over
time, which might have an impact on survival. More patients
undergoing EPP received platinum/gemcitabine compared to
platinum/pemetrexed in the P/D group. Because it has been sug-
gested that adding pemetrexed to platinum-based chemotherapy
regimens increases median survival as well as response rates [8],
patients who had P/D may have had a survival benefit. However,
our data show no difference in long-term survival of patients
receiving platinum/pemetrexed compared to those receiving
platinum/gemcitabine (21 months [95% CI: 15–26] with cisplatin/
gemcitabine versus 18 months [95% CI: 12–24] with cisplatin/
pemetrexed [P = 0.8]) [24]. In the present study, none of the
patients undergoing P/D had radiotherapy for technical reasons
while 56% of patients who had EPP received additional radiation
therapy, some as part of the SAKK 17/04 study, which did not
show a benefit for prophylactic hemithoracic radiotherapy [9].
The fact that the direct effects of these different treatment
modalities on overall survival cannot possibly be evaluated prop-
erly limits the impact of our results concerning long-term onco-
logical outcomes.
Second, the retrospective design might have added some
selection bias that we could eliminate to a certain extent by pro-
pensity score matching. Older age has previously been described
as a prognostic factor but could not be included in our propen-
sity matching process. However, postoperative mortality and
long-term outcomes were worse in patients undergoing EPP,
which represented the younger group.
Third, the limited numbers and many censored patients in the
P/D group may affect the significance of our long-term oncologi-
cal outcomes. Moreover, because all of the P/Ds have been per-
formed in recent years and with less frequency, there might have
been a general learning curve effect for the management of MPM
patients in general and a learning curve for the P/D procedure in
favour of EPP. However, the treatment algorithms have not
changed substantially at our centre over the last several decades.
Larger studies are needed to further elucidate the best surgical
treatment and to determine the right indications for each proce-
dure. To optimal decision making, it is crucial to involve an inter-
disciplinary
tumour
board
with
experienced
mesothelioma
surgeons at a dedicated, high-volume mesothelioma centre and
to tailor an individual treatment plan for each patient. We further
believe that an algorithm has to be established within the guide-
lines to decide on the type of treatment. The Multimodality
Prognostic Score, an algorithm suggested by our group, has
shown good risk stratification for survival after EPP, taking into
account tumour volume, histological subtype, preoperative c-
reactive protein levels and tumour response according to RECIST
criteria [24]. In the future, these tools will be further refined to
better prepare the clinician to choose a treatment strategy on
the basis of individual risks and potential benefits for each
patient.
Both surgical techniques appear to be feasible after induction
chemotherapy and may lead to improved long-term survival
compared to chemotherapy alone in carefully selected patients.
Although the rates of severe complications and 90-day deaths
are higher (but not significantly) after EPP, the overall morbidity
rates seem to be equal in the present data set. Each procedure is
characterized by its own specific set and severity of complica-
tions and represents different challenges for perioperative man-
agement. There is a tendency to preserve EPP for selected cases
only as long as P/D can achieve an MCR and the remaining lung
will be of relevant size and quality. Each procedure will have spe-
cific indications that need to be further refined in future trials.
