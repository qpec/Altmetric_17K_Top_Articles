Abstract
Clinical guidelines recommend early discharge of patients with low-risk pulmonary embolism
(LRPE). This study measured the overall impact of early discharge of LRPE patients on clinical
outcomes and costs in the Veterans Health Administration population. Adult patients with �1
inpatient diagnosis for pulmonary embolism (PE) (index date) between 10/2011-06/2015, contin-
uous enrollment for �12 months pre- and 3 months post-index date were included. PE risk strati-
fication was performed using the simplified Pulmonary Embolism Stratification Index. Propensity
score matching (PSM) was used to compare 90-day adverse PE events (APEs) [recurrent
venous thromboembolism, major bleed and death], hospital-acquired complications (HACs),
healthcare utilization, and costs among short (�2 days) versus long length of stay (LOS). Net
clinical benefit was defined as 1 minus the combined rate of APE and HAC. Among 6,746 PE
patients, 95.4% were men, 22.0% were African American, and 1,918 had LRPE. Among LRPE
patients, only 688 had a short LOS. After 1:1 PSM, there were no differences in APE, but short
LOS had fewer HAC (1.5% vs 13.3%, 95% CI: 3.77–19.94) and bacterial pneumonias (5.9% vs
11.7%, 95% CI: 1.24–3.23), resulting in better net clinical benefit (86.9% vs 78.3%, 95% CI:
0.84–0.96). Among long LOS patients, HACs (52) exceeded APEs (14 recurrent DVT, 5 bleeds).
Short LOS incurred lower inpatient ($2,164 vs $5,100, 95% CI: $646.8-$5225.0) and total costs
($9,056 vs $12,544, 95% CI: $636.6-$6337.7). LRPE patients with short LOS had better net clin-
ical outcomes at lower costs than matched LRPE patients with long LOS.
Introduction
Background
Pulmonary embolism (PE) is responsible for at least 100,000–200,000 deaths in the United
States each year, and is the third major cause of cardiovascular death after myocardial

 infarction and cerebrovascular accidents [1]. The annual incidence rate of PE is 1.0 per 1,000
persons, rising exponentially with age [2]. Based on autopsy data results, incidence of this dis-
ease is highest among individuals aged between 70–80 years. If untreated, acute PE is associ-
ated with a death rate as high as 30%, whereas the death rate of diagnosed and treated PE is 8%
[3].
Importance
PE is generally diagnosed in patients by performing a Computed Tomography Angiography
(CTA), and the majority of US patients are admitted for risk stratification and initiation of
anticoagulation therapy [4]. Several risk-stratification algorithms have been developed, includ-
ing the Geneva score, the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) score, the simplified
PESI (sPESI) score, the Spanish score, the Davies criteria, the Home management exclusion
criteria, and the Hestia criteria [5,6].
PE is associated with a substantial burden of health care utilization and associated costs.
The annual cost per patient for an initial episode of PE ranges from $13,000 –$31,300, and
with recurrent episodes, the annual cost per patient is $11,014 –$14,722 [7]. Since patients
with low-risk PE (LRPE) can be identified using the validated risk stratification tools, an
opportunity exists to select a population of patients that can be safely treated without a tradi-
tional hospital admission [7]. It has been estimated that up to 50% of PE patients can be treated
safely in an outpatient setting [8]. American and European professional organizations have
guidelines that support such an approach. The updated 2016 ACCP guidelines suggest that
LRPE patients with adequate home circumstances can be treated at home or with an abbrevi-
ated hospital stay [8]. The European Society of Cardiology advocates for the risk stratification
of PE patients and the consideration of an outpatient management option for LRPE patients
[9,10]. While treatment of LRPE patients in outpatient settings is widely practiced in European
countries, physicians in the US have not widely adopted an outpatient or observation manage-
ment strategy. Some factors identified as barriers to outpatient management of LRPE patients
include physician resistance, medication security, difficulty in risk stratification, and lack of a
uniform approach to risk stratification [11].
Goals of this investigation
Given the numerous studies supporting the benefit of early discharge among LRPE patients,
the purpose of our study was to examine whether short length of stay (LOS) is associated with
improved clinical and economic outcomes in a real-world setting.
Methods
Study design and setting
This was a longitudinal, retrospective cohort study assessing the Veterans Health Administra-
tion (VHA) population from October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2015. The VHA is the
largest integrated health care system in the United States, providing care at 1,245 health care
facilities, including 170 VA medical centers and 1,065 outpatient clinics, serving more than 9
million enrolled veterans across the country [12]. Since this study does not involve the collec-
tion, use or transmittal of individual identifiable data, Institutional Review Board approval to
conduct this study was not required.
Electronic health data collected within the VHA national Medical SAS1 Dataset and Deci-
sion Support System were evaluated, using the medical, pharmacy, laboratory, and VHA
health plan enrollment information [13,14]. These data include hospital and outpatient

 diagnoses (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-
9-CM]) and procedure codes (ICD-9 procedure and Current Procedural Terminology codes),
[15] laboratory results, and dispensed medication records. Death date was determined using
the VA Vital Status file, which ascertains mortality using the Social Security Death Master File,
Medicare Vital Status Files, and VA Beneficiary Identification and Records Locator Subsystem.
The VHA Vital Status File is updated quarterly, and the three most recent quarterly updates
are maintained [16].
Selection of participants.
Patients were included in the study if they were �18 years of
age, had �1 inpatient diagnosis for PE (ICD-9-CM codes: 415.1, 415.11, 415.19), had a pre-
scription claim for an anticoagulant (unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin
[LMWH], warfarin, or novel oral anticoagulants [NOACs]) during the hospital stay and were
continuously enrolled in a health plan with medical and pharmacy benefits for at least 12
months prior to the index hospitalization discharge, including the hospital stay (baseline
period) until 3 months post-index date or death (follow-up period), whichever came first. The
first PE diagnosis date was designated as the initial diagnosis date, and the discharge date was
designated as the index date. Patients who were administered subcutaneous heparin during
the hospital stay were not included, since many patients are given subcutaneous heparin as a
prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and PE. Also, patients with a PE claim or any anticoagu-
lant claim prior to the initial diagnosis date were excluded.
Eligible PE patients were stratified using the sPESI criteria into low-risk PE (LRPE) and
high-risk PE (HRPE). The sPESI is a simplified version of the PESI in which selected variables
of the original score are included (age, history of cancer, history of chronic cardiopulmonary
disease, pulse, systemic blood pressure, and oxygen saturation levels). Patients scoring 0 points
were considered at low risk. LRPE patients were further stratified, based on their LOS, into
short LOS (�2 days) and long LOS (>2 days) cohorts.
Methods and measurements.
Patient demographics, including age, gender, race, and
body mass index (BMI), during the baseline period were assessed. In addition, clinical charac-
teristics, including Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score, individual comorbidities (hospi-
talized DVT [ICD-9-CM codes 451.1, 453], left ventricular [LV] dysfunction [ICD-9-CM code
429.9], cardiac dysrhythmia [ICD-9-CM codes 427.0–427.9]) and administration of various
diagnostic tests were recorded. Also, patients with various clinical markers including troponin
I/T and natriuretic peptide testing results during the index hospitalization were assessed.
Outcomes.
The percentage of patients with HACs and surgical procedures (thrombolysis,
placement of inferior vena cava filter) during index hospitalization were evaluated. HACs were
identified using the ICD-9-CM codes (S3 Table). APEs (recurrent venous thromboembolism
[VTE], major bleeding, death), diagnostic tests (CTA, echocardiogram, lung ventilation/perfu-
sion [VQ] scan, venous Doppler ultrasound) were also evaluated. Recurrent VTE was defined
as having a hospitalization claim for DVT or PE between 8 and 90 days after the index date.
Major bleeding was defined using a previously validated algorithm developed by Cunningham
et al. [17]. The algorithm employed a systematic approach to identify major bleeding events
using ICD-9-CM/CPT diagnosis and procedure codes (S2 Table). We defined the net clinical
benefit as 1 minus the combined rate of APE events and HACs. The percentage of patients
with any (ie, not disease-specific) inpatient hospitalization, outpatient stay, or pharmacy visit,
as well as the mean number of visits per patient and the associated health care costs during the
90-day follow-up period, were reported.
Analysis.
Descriptive statistics were provided for all study variables, including baseline
demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcome variables among short LOS and long LOS
LRPE cohorts, and statistical tests of significance (chi-square for categorical variables, t-test for
continuous variables) were conducted to assess differences between the cohorts. Logistic

 regression was used to identify the predictors of hospital LOS (short vs long LOS) among LRPE
patients. Patient characteristics such as gender, race, BMI, CCI score, baseline comorbidities, clini-
cal markers, and diagnostic tests were included as independent variables in the model. Hospital
LOS was the dependent variable. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pre-
sented. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to compare the clinical and economic out-
comes among short vs long LOS LRPE cohorts. Each short LOS patient was matched to a long
LOS patient within 0.01 units of the propensity score. The propensity score was calculated via a
logistic regression model. The adequacy of the matching procedure was assessed by standardized
difference; a difference of <10% is considered well balanced. Costs were compared between the
PSM-matched cohorts with a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution and log link to
account for the expected non-normality of cost data. All analyses were conducted using SAS sta-
tistical software (SAS 9.3, Copyright 2012, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA.)
Results
Characteristics of study subjects
After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 6,746 PE patients were included in the
study. Among these patients, 1,918 (28.4%) met the definition of being LRPE patients. Among
the LRPE patients, 688 (35.9%) had a short LOS and 1,230 (64.1%) had a long LOS (Fig 1).
Before matching, LRPE patients with a long LOS were older (60.7 vs 58.4 years, 95% CI:
1.28–3.37) and a higher percentage were men (94.6 vs 91.3, 95% CI: 1.01–1.06) as compared to
LRPE patients with a short LOS. Long LOS patients had higher CCI scores (1.1 vs 0.8, 95% CI:
0.16–0.42) and a higher proportion of patients with individual baseline comorbidities, includ-
ing moderate or severe renal disease (20.3% vs 14.2%, 95% CI: 1.04–1.96), diabetes (29.3% vs
22.5%, 95% CI: 1.10–1.53), and cardiac dysrhythmia (16.4% vs 10.0%, 95% CI: 1.27–2.12) as
compared to short LOS patients. Also, the long LOS cohort had a higher proportion of patients
with troponin I testing (38.1% vs. 30.1%, 95% CI: 1.11–1.45) and elevated troponin I >0.04 ng/
ml (46.5% vs 23.7%, 95% CI: 1.11–1.45) or troponin T >0.03 ng/ml (73.7% vs 28.6%, 95% CI:
1.08–6.16) during index hospitalization as compared to the short LOS cohort (Table 1).
After 1:1 PSM, a total of 784 (40.8%) patients were included in the long LOS (n = 392) and
short LOS (n = 392) LRPE cohorts. The cohorts were well-balanced based on baseline demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics with standardized differences of < 10%.
PSM-adjusted adverse PE events, HACs, surgical procedures, and
diagnostic tests
There were no differences in the follow-up adverse PE events, including recurrent VTE, major
bleeding, and death between the short LOS and long LOS LRPE cohorts. However, LRPE
patients with a short LOS had fewer HACs (1.5% vs 13.3%, 95% CI: 3.77–19.94), including hos-
pital-acquired pneumonia (0.0% vs 8.4%) during index hospitalization. Additionally, the short
LOS cohort had a lower proportion of patients with bacterial pneumonia (5.9% vs 11.7%, 95%
CI: 1.24–3.23) than the long LOS cohort. Net clinical benefit was higher for short LOS patients.
(86.9% vs 78.3%, 95% CI: 0.84–0.96). Among long LOS, the number of HACs (52) exceeded
adverse PE events (14 recurrent DVT, 5 bleeds, 10 deaths) (Table 2). LRPE patients with a long
LOS had a higher number of surgeries for placement of the inferior vena cava filter than the
short LOS patients (4.8% vs 0.8%, 95% CI: 1.89–21.23) during index hospitalization. During
the 90-day follow-up period, the long LOS cohort, as compared to the short LOS cohort, had a
lower proportion of patients with a VQ scan (1.8% vs 4.3%, 95% CI: 0.17–0.98) and a Venous
Doppler Ultrasound (20.4% vs 29.6%, 95% CI: 0.54–0.88).

 PSM-adjusted follow-up health care resource utilization and costs. The long LOS
cohort, as compared to the short LOS cohort, had a higher number of pharmacy visits per
patient (12.2 vs 9.4, 95% CI: 1.34–4.18) and incurred higher inpatient ($5,100 vs $2,164, 95%
CI: $646.80-$5225.00), total medical ($11,135 vs $7,843, 95% CI: $796.40-$5787.70) and total
costs ($12,544 vs $9,056, 95% CI: $636.60-$6337.70; Fig 2).
Predictors of hospital LOS among LRPE patients.
Patients with CTA (OR: 4.8, 95% CI:
3.8–6.0), VQ scan (OR: 3.8, 95% CI: 1.9–7.7), and venous Doppler ultrasound (OR: 1.4, 95%
CI: 1.1–1.9) in the baseline period had increased probability of a short LOS among LRPE
patients, and patients with assays for clinical markers troponin I (OR: 0.7, 95% CI: 0.5–0.9)
and natriuretic peptide testing (OR: 0.7, 95% CI: 0.6–0.9) during index hospitalization had
decreased probability of a short LOS. The odds of a short LOS decreased among LRPE patients
with LV dysfunction (OR: 0.2, 95% CI: 0.1–0.6), hospitalized DVT (OR: 0.7, 95% CI: 0.6–0.9),
and peptic ulcer disease (OR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1–1.0).
Limitations
The findings from our study should be viewed in the context of some study limitations. First,
the study relied on retrospective claims data. While claims data are extremely valuable for the

 out criteria rather than the actual disease. To ensure exclusion of any rule-out PE diagnosis,
PE patients were required to have an anticoagulant claim during their hospital stay. The pres-
ence of a claim for a filled prescription does not indicate the medication was consumed or
taken as prescribed. Also, prescriptions filled over-the-counter or provided as samples by the
physician are not observed in claims data. Thus, the true number of medications prescribed
may not be accurately recorded. Third, certain clinical and disease-specific parameters are not
readily available in claims data that could have effect on study outcomes.
Patients in the long LOS cohort may have had non-coded reasons explaining their longer
stay. For example, those with unstable social situations may have been kept longer while
attempting to arrange more stable outpatient management strategies. Further, longer LOS
patients may have been perceived to suffer greater fragility by their physicians, which may
explain their older age. Finally, it should be noted that troponin results are not included in the
majority of PE risk stratification scores. Thus, higher troponin levels found in the longer LOS
cohort may have prompted additional evaluation that required a longer inpatient time or may
have prompted a longer admission as some studies suggest higher risk with elevated biomark-
ers. Interestingly, our study does not confirm worse outcomes in patients with elevated
biomarkers.
Finally, it should also be noted that PSM adjustment cannot resolve problems due to imbal-
ances in unmeasured factors. It is possible that there were unobserved variables that the PSM
does not correct for in risk-adjusted tables. The current study also represented only US data
from a specific subpopulation (VHA veterans), who were mostly elderly men. Therefore, the
general applicability of our findings to young male patients or females requires further study.
Discussion
PE is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [18]. The key to
effective treatment lies in the appropriate risk stratification–low-risk patients can benefit from
abbreviated hospital stays or outpatient therapy, which can reduce the economic burden of the

 disease [19]. In our study, we found that in a real-world clinical setting, LRPE patients with a
short LOS have better clinical outcomes at lower costs than those with a long LOS. Impor-
tantly, LRPE patients with longer LOS suffered markedly higher rates of hospital acquired
conditions. Our comparison between long and short LOS patients is unique and allows the
quantification of the impact of hospital exposure in putatively comparable populations.
In a study conducted by Dentali et al., 26.1% of PE patients were classified as low-risk,
while 30.7% were classified as low-risk by Jimenez et al., per the sPESI criteria [20,21]. Our
results were consistent with these studies, since 28.4% of PE patients were stratified as low-
risk. Results of our study showed that CTA was the most common diagnostic test used among
the 2 cohorts, which is consistent with previous studies [22,23]. Surprisingly, the short LOS
cohort included a higher proportion of patients with a CTA test than the long LOS cohort.
This may have been due to the possibility that health care providers were confronted with diag-
nostic uncertainty and thus performed more tests to confirm the diagnosis.
In our analysis, patients with a longer LOS also had higher mean troponin levels. Some PE
risk stratification tools include troponin, levels but the data is inconclusive on the risk associ-
ated with elevations therefore we included patients with elevations in the LRPE cohort. This is
in contradistinction to a study conducted by Kang et al., in high-risk patients who had elevated
levels of cardiac biomarkers including troponin T/I [24]. Additionally, in a meta-analysis pub-
lished by Becattini and colleagues on the relation between troponins and mortality and mor-
bidity in acute PE, they confirmed that the increase of troponins I and/or T was associated
with higher medical complications and mortality even in the subgroup of low-risk and hemo-
dynamically stable patients but not higher PE related adverse events [25]. This evidence sup-
ports the findings of our study as we observed elevated clinical markers in the LRPE patients
with a longer LOS, but suggests this marker may be less relevant than clinical risks. Given the
nature of the study methodology, we cannot discern whether or not patients with elevated tro-
ponin had a longer LOS because clinicians were executing additional diagnostics in this sub-
population. Despite differences in study design/settings and study population, our finding of
increased HACs among long LOS patients is consistent with a number of previous studies
[26,27,28]. However, it is difficult to determine whether a longer LOS is caused by medical
complications or that a longer LOS caused the complications, as pointed out in earlier studies
[26,27]. This challenge is also present in our study and should be kept in mind when interpret-
ing the findings. The results of a meta-analysis conducted by Zondang et al. showed that PE
patients who were treated at home or those discharged early had similar pooled incidences of
recurrent VTE and major bleeding as those patients who were treated in the hospital. The
study also observed that PE-related mortality did not occur in either the patients treated at
home or discharged early [29]. The results of our study agree with the above study, as we
observed no differences in the follow-up clinical outcomes including recurrent VTE, major
bleeding, and death between the short LOS and long LOS LRPE patients.
Our study showed that long LOS patients had more inpatient and pharmacy visits and
higher health care costs. Previous studies showed that increased hospital LOS is an important
driver of costs among PE patients and suggested that implementation of outpatient treatment
strategies or early discharge would substantially reduce health care costs [22,30, 31]. Studies
have suggested that the home treatment of PE has cost savings in the range of $500–$2,500 per
patient [7,32]. Additionally, Coleman et al. observed lower costs of hospital treatment among
low-risk PE patients discharged within 2 or 3 days than those who stayed longer in the hospital
[8].
Recently-published practice guidelines that recommend outpatient care for carefully selected
patients with non-massive PE fail to specify how these low-risk patients can be identified accurately
[32]. Previous studies observed that PE patients with a shorter LOS had higher post-discharge

 mortality, implying that the physicians may inappropriately select those patients at a higher risk for
complications for early discharge [30,33]. Hence, outpatient and early discharge should only be
considered in low-risk PE patients [29]. sPESI criteria used for risk stratification in our study is the
most extensively-validated clinical prognostic criteria [9,21]. The results of a cohort study con-
ducted by Donadini et al. showed that LOS was only associated with national early warning score
(NEWS), a non-specific PE validated score, where NEWS �5 was considered a negative predictor
for shorter LOS [34]. Additionally, previous studies assessing the patient and hospital factors in
hospitalized patients showed that the presence of a DVT, higher rates of individual comorbidities,
and a higher risk score were more likely to have a longer LOS among PE patients [30,32]. Our
study results are in agreement with these studies, since patients with hospitalized DVT, peptic
ulcer disease, and clinical markers troponin I and B natriuretic peptide were negative predictors
for a shorter LOS. However, more research is necessary to evaluate the association between LOS
and diagnostic tests. There is a need to conduct further studies assessing HACs and the associated
health care utilization and costs among LRPE patients. Further research will help to provide effi-
cient treatment and thus improve outcomes and reduce health care costs among PE patients.
In summary, the results of this study showed that LRPE patients with a short LOS had better
clinical outcomes at lower costs than those with a long LOS. Therefore, risk stratification of PE
patients is of utmost importance, and reducing the LOS among LRPE patients may substan-
tially reduce the disease’s clinical and economic burden.
