Abstract
Background: In mammography, breast compression is applied to reduce the thickness of the breast. While it is widely
accepted that firm breast compression is needed to ensure acceptable image quality, guidelines remain vague about
how much compression should be applied during mammogram acquisition. A quantitative parameter indicating the
desirable amount of compression is not available. Consequently, little is known about the relationship between the
amount of breast compression and breast cancer detectability. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of
breast compression pressure in mammography on breast cancer screening outcomes.
Methods: We used digital image analysis methods to determine breast volume, percent dense volume, and pressure
from 132,776 examinations of 57,179 women participating in the Dutch population-based biennial breast cancer
screening program. Pressure was estimated by dividing the compression force by the area of the contact surface
between breast and compression paddle. The data was subdivided into quintiles of pressure and the number of
screen-detected cancers, interval cancers, false positives, and true negatives were determined for each group.
Generalized estimating equations were used to account for correlation between examinations of the same woman and
for the effect of breast density and volume when estimating sensitivity, specificity, and other performance measures.
Sensitivity was computed using interval cancers occurring between two screening rounds and using interval cancers
within 12 months after screening. Pair-wise testing for significant differences was performed.
Results: Percent dense volume increased with increasing pressure, while breast volume decreased. Sensitivity in
quintiles with increasing pressure was 82.0%, 77.1%, 79.8%, 71.1%, and 70.8%. Sensitivity based on interval cancers
within 12 months was significantly lower in the highest pressure quintile compared to the third (84.3% vs 93.9%,
p = 0.034). Specificity was lower in the lowest pressure quintile (98.0%) compared to the second, third, and fourth group
(98.5%, p < 0.005). Specificity of the fifth quintile was 98.4%.
Conclusion: Results suggest that if too much pressure is applied during mammography this may reduce sensitivity. In
contrast, if pressure is low this may decrease specificity.

 Background
In mammography, breast compression is applied to re-
duce the thickness of the breast. This results in improved
image quality because tissue superposition and x-ray scat-
ter are reduced, while it limits the required dose [1–4]. In
addition, with a compression paddle the breast can be
kept in a fixed position, which reduces the risk of motion
artefacts and image blurring.
Mammography devices measure and display compres-
sion force during the imaging procedure. However, there
are no quantitative guidelines regarding the compression
force a radiographer should apply for acquisition of an
adequate mammogram. In practice, compression force
in mammography varies widely among radiographers,
screening centers, and countries [5–10]. A disadvantage
of compression is that many women complain about dis-
comfort and pain which might influence their participa-
tion in screening [11–13]. A reduction in compression
force has therefore been suggested to encourage screen-
ing attendance [14].
Although mammography systems display the compres-
sion force applied by the compression paddle to the
breast, it is the pressure, which is defined as the com-
pression force divided by the contact area between
breast and compression paddle, that determines how
much the tissue is compressed. It is therefore likely that
the pain experienced by women undergoing mammog-
raphy is more related to pressure than to force. The
same force applied to a small or a large breast leads to
different pressures. Pressure depends on the force and
the contact area between the breast and the paddle,
which depends on the breast size and the deformation
and shape changes of the breast during compression. In
case of a large contact area, the force is distributed over
a larger area, leading to a lower pressure (force per unit
area) compared to a small area. In a study by de Groot
et al. [15] the force-standardized compression protocol
was replaced by a pressure-standardized protocol using
a recently developed paddle [16]. It was found that pain
was reduced with pressure standardization, while aver-
age glandular dose remained unchanged.
While it is widely accepted that firm breast compres-
sion is needed to ensure acceptable image quality, guide-
lines remain vague about how much compression should
be applied. For example, the European guideline states
that "the breast should be properly compressed, but no
more than is necessary to achieve a good image quality"
[17]. A quantitative parameter indicating the amount of
compression is not presented. Consequently, little is
known about the relationship between the amount of
breast compression and breast cancer detectability. Fur-
thermore, it has been reported that too much compres-
sion, as applied during spot compression, can lead to
dissolving of suspicious densities in some cases [18–20].
Therefore, this retrospective study aims to investigate if
the level of breast compression can impact screening
performance, using pressure to characterize the level of
compression.
Methods
Screening data
In this retrospective study, mammograms that were ac-
quired in the Dutch breast cancer screening program are
used. In this population-based program, women between
50 and 75 years of age are invited for a screening exam-
ination every 2 years. A consecutive series of mammo-
grams acquired in one screening unit were collected.
Raw mammograms acquired in this unit were archived
between 2003–2012, except for a 4-month period in
2009 due to a technical issue. The images of the 135,640
available examinations were acquired on Lorad Selenia
systems (Hologic, Inc., Danbury, CT, USA). The majority
of the images were acquired with a flexible paddle. Can-
cer status information was obtained from the screening
registration system and the Netherlands Cancer Registry.
Written informed consent was not required for this
study as women automatically consent to the use of their
anonymized data for scientific purposes by participating
in screening unless they object. Data of participants who
objected to the use of their data were removed. A waiver
to use the anonymized mammograms for research was
obtained from the research ethics committee of the Rad-
boud University Medical Center.
In
this
screening
program,
medio-lateral
oblique
(MLO) and cranio-caudal (CC) view images were always
acquired at the first screening. However, during the
study period, screening guidelines recommended that
during subsequent rounds CC images be acquired in
case of severe density, post-surgical changes, and if the
technician suspected that this would be helpful in the
clarification of an unclear structure. Therefore, CC view
images are available only in about 60% of the examina-
tions. There are systematic differences between MLO
and CC views in force and pressure. Therefore, to ex-
clude these differences and to prevent a bias towards ab-
normal and dense breasts we used only MLO view
images in this study.
Screen-detected cancers or true positives (TPs) are de-
fined as the cancers diagnosed after a recall of a woman
for additional diagnostic tests. Interval cancers or false
negative (FN) examinations are defined as cancers that
were diagnosed within 24 months after a screening
examination that did not lead to a recall (negative
screening mammogram) and before attending the next
scheduled screening examination. False positive (FP) ex-
aminations are exams of women recalled for additional
tests in which no breast cancer was diagnosed, and true
negatives (TNs) are examinations that did not lead to a

 recall and after which no breast cancer was diagnosed
within 24 months before the attendance to another
screening round.
Image analysis
Compression pressure was determined retrospectively
using a research version of the software Volpara (v1.5.0,
Volpara Health Technologies, Wellington, New Zea-
land). The algorithm determines the contact area be-
tween the breast and the compression paddle by image
analysis as described in [21]. The contact area measured
with Volpara has been validated against manual segmen-
tations from video images and a correlation of R = 0.978
(confidence interval (CI) 0.972–0.982) was found [22].
Pressure is computed by taking the compression force
measurement from the imaging device, which is stored
in the image header, and dividing it by the estimated
contact area. Volpara software was also used to deter-
mine breast volume and dense tissue volume, which
were used to compute percent dense volume. For the
TN examinations and bilateral findings, the values ob-
tained for the left and right MLO views were averaged.
For all other examinations the values for the side with
the finding or cancer was used.
Data analysis
The relationships between breast volume and force and
pressure were investigated using heatmaps. The pressure
measurements were used to divide the dataset into quin-
tiles of increasing pressure. Within the five groups the
following performance measures were determined: recall
rate (number of true positive and false positive findings
per 1000 women screened), false positive rate (number
of false positive findings per 1000 women screened),
screen-detected breast cancer rate (number of screen-
detected breast cancers per 1000 women examined),
specificity (number of true negative findings divided by
the number of exams without cancer diagnosis; TN/(TN
+ FP)), and positive predictive value (number of screen-
detected cancers divided by the number of recalls; TP/
(TP + FP)) as performed in a previous publication [23].
Additionally, the interval cancer rate (number of interval
cancers per 1000 examinations), the program sensitivity
(number of screen-detected cancers divided by the sum
of screen-detected cancers and interval cancers diag-
nosed before the next screening round), and 12-month
sensitivity (program sensitivity using only the interval
cancers diagnosed within 12 months after examination)
were determined. The 12-month sensitivity may be used
to translate results to the context of an annual screening
program.
Many women in the dataset had more than one
screening examination. To account for correlation be-
tween examinations of the same woman, we used
generalized estimating equations (GEE) using the ‘inde-
pendence’ correlation structure. As it is known that the
sensitivity of mammography is lower in women with
higher breast density [24–26], breast volume and per-
cent dense volume were included in the models to adjust
for their potentially confounding effect. Breast volume
and percent dense volume were transformed using the
natural logarithm to obtain data which approximated
normal distributions. Pair-wise testing was applied to as-
sess differences between the groups on the sensitivity
and specificity measurements. Correction for multiple
testing was applied using the Tukey method and a p
value below 0.05 was considered significant. GEE was
used for each performance measure separately.
For each pressure group, the distribution of the differ-
ent cancer types and their detection at screening or as
interval cancers, using the non-corrected data, was also
investigated. For this, the following categories were used:
ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), invasive ductal carcin-
oma (IDC), invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), ‘other’
, and
unknown.
Statistical analysis was performed using R version 3.3.1.
Results
In total 135,640 examinations were available. Excluding
examinations with unknown screening outcome (n = 72),
examinations without a percent dense volume, contact
area or force measurement available (n = 2,673), and
interval cancers diagnosed more than 24 months after
the examination (n = 119), a total of 132,776 examina-
tions of 57,179 women were included in the analysis.
The mean age at the time of the examination was
59.2 years, and 39,449 women contributed two or more
examinations to the dataset while 17,730 women con-
tributed one examination (not necessarily their first
screening mammogram).
To stratify the examinations into five groups of equal
size, thresholds on the pressure estimates were applied
at 7.7 kPa, 9.3 kPa, 10.8 kPa, and 13.0 kPa. When a pres-
sure measurement equals the threshold, the lower class
is assigned to the examination. The mean breast vol-
umes, percent dense volumes, forces, and pressures of
the five groups are listed in Table 1. As expected, it can
be seen that increasing compression pressure correlated
with decreasing breast volume and increasing breast
density and force.
Heatmaps showing the variations in force and pressure
with breast volume are shown in Fig. 1 illustrating the
difference between force and pressure. To indicate the
pressure groups, horizontal lines were added to the pres-
sure distribution according to the thresholds applied to
form the quintiles. It is observed that breasts of the same
size are imaged using a wide range of forces. At the
same time a trend is indicating that larger breasts are

Page 3 of 8
 imaged with higher forces, so some adjustment to the in-
dividual breast takes place. The pressure distribution
shows, however, that the very large breasts are imaged
with a low pressure and therefore most of these cases are
in the first pressure category. Additionally, it is ob-
served that the first pressure group contains the en-
tire
range
of
breast
sizes,
while
extremely
high
compression is mainly a problem for small breasts.
This is due to medium and high forces, as shown in
the left heatmap, being distributed over a small con-
tact area, leading to high pressure.
Table 2 gives an overview of the screening outcomes
for the complete cohort stratified by the five compres-
sion pressure groups. Screening performance measures
are displayed in Table 3. Results suggest that, at high
compression pressure, sensitivity is reduced (82.7%,
77.4%, 79.7%, 70.0%, and 68.2% for the five groups,
respectively).
Results from the GEE models are shown in Table 4,
confirming the decrease in sensitivity at high pressure
observed in the unadjusted data. The sensitivity of the
five pressure groups is 82.0%, 77.1%, 79.8%, 71.1%, and
70.8%, respectively, while the 12-month sensitivity is
90.1%, 92.0%, 93.9%, 87.2%, and 84.3%, respectively.
There is a statistically significant difference in the 12-
month sensitivity between the third and the fifth group
(p = 0.034). Even though this is the only significant dif-
ference between groups on the sensitivity measurements,
a considerable difference can be observed between the
first three pressure groups and the last two pressure
groups. Results also show a trend that women with
mammograms in the lowest pressure group are recalled
more often. This leads to a higher false positive rate, and
lower specificity and positive predictive value. The speci-
ficity was found to be significantly lower in the first
group (98.0%) compared to the second (p < 0.001), third
(p < 0.001), and fourth (p = 0.002) group which all have a
specificity of 98.5%. The 12-month sensitivity and the
specificity are displayed in Fig. 2 with and without cor-
rection for confounders.
The investigation of the distribution of DCIS, IDC,
ILC, and the remaining other types of cancers for the
different pressure categories shows that only a few
DCIS cases are found among the interval cancers.
The proportion of lobular and other types of cancers
is relatively high for the interval cancers in the high-
est pressure group compared to the other pressure
groups and the proportion of lobular and other types
of cancers for the screen-detected cancers (data not
shown). Because of the low number of cancers in
each subgroup, statistical analysis of subgroup differ-
ences was not performed.

 Discussion
Given the reasons for using mechanical breast compres-
sion during mammographic imaging (reduction of tissue
superposition, scatter, dose, and possibility of motion
among other image quality-related benefits), it was ex-
pected that screening outcomes would be negatively im-
pacted if the compression pressure applied was too low,
as found in our results. As could have been foreseen, ap-
plying insufficient compression lowers the specificity of
mammography, perhaps due to a lack of minimization of
tissue
superposition.
In this
context, it
should be
highlighted that the overall compression force, and
therefore pressure, is rather high in the Netherlands com-
pared to other countries [5, 6, 8]. Hence, the loss of per-
formance due to insufficient compression may be a more
common issue in general than that found in this study.
The finding demonstrates that an adequate level of com-
pression is necessary to obtain good image quality and
achieve a low recall rate, and stresses the need for tech-
niques to apply compression at the right level. Although
one should be careful with extending our conclusions to
other populations, since screening policies vary from
country to country (e.g., recall rates are higher in the US
than in Europe), we note that our study sample is repre-
sentative for breast cancer screening in Europe where low
recall rates, as in our study, are common [27].
Although some reports were published about reduced
visibility of a subset of tumors in spot compression
[18–20], which typically are made with stronger com-
pression, it was not a priori expected that high com-
pression levels in screening mammography would have
a large negative impact on screening outcomes. How-
ever, it seems that applying a higher than needed com-
pression actually has a stronger negative effect on
lesion visibility than applying insufficient compression,
even when correcting for the confounding effects of breast
density and volume, resulting in a lower sensitivity. Even
though the difference in sensitivity did not reach statistical
significance when corrected for confounding factors, ex-
cept for the 12-month sensitivity between group 3 and
group 5, the reduction was considerably larger than that
suffered due to applying low compression.
It is not straightforward to identify the underlying
cause for reduced sensitivity at high compression levels.
This reduction in sensitivity could be due to either ma-
lignancies not being seen or being seen but mischarac-
terized, or due to both types of errors. Reduced visibility
of certain tumors under high compression might be due
to their composition. It can be reasoned that softer tu-
mors may become less conspicuous with high compres-
sion because the cancer tissue may spread out and lose
contrast. Another reason could be that lesion types that
are detected because of architectural changes of the
breast parenchyma are less conspicuous under lower and
higher pressure. This is supported by the distribution of
ILC over the five groups. However, it is hard to say with

 the given data whether a specific type of cancer is more
often missed because of too low or too high pressure. The
different cancer types should be kept in mind when inves-
tigating the relationship between pressure and screening
performance in future studies, with other, perhaps larger,
datasets. In terms of mischaracterization, vascularization
might play a role. Since invasive cancers are often highly
vascularized, strong compression may lead to a reduction
in blood flow [28, 29], leading to both a decrease in con-
trast and a reduction in the perceived suspiciousness of
the finding, causing misinterpretation of its probability of
malignancy [30].
The force and the pressure distributions were dis-
played in relation to the breast volume. The first pres-
sure group contains the entire range of breast volumes.
For women with small breasts, the low pressure is
caused by a low force. For larger breasts, the contact
area is larger so that even a medium or high force leads
to a low pressure. An extremely high pressure is only
observed for small breasts and is caused by too much
force. Therefore, a compression recommendation based
on force cannot solve the over-compression of small
breasts and the under-compression of large breasts, as
the force measure is independent of the individual breast

 characteristics. On the other hand, a pressure-guided
compression could prevent extreme compressions of
small breasts and too low compressions of larger breasts,
as the pressure measurement depends on the breast size,
shape, and stiffness.
The relationship between compression pressure and
screening performance measures was also investigated in
the recent study of Moshina et al. [31] with data from
the Norwegian breast cancer screening program. About
260,000
examinations
were
categorized
into
low,
medium, and high pressure groups, and the performance
measures were calculated using GEE including a correc-
tion for fibroglandular tissue volume and age. Also in
the Norwegian data, a decrease in sensitivity was ob-
served with increasing pressure which supports the main
finding of our study. However, their finding that low
compression pressure is associated with more favorable
performance measures was not confirmed in our study.
We observed a lower specificity for examinations in the
lowest pressure group. It should, however, be noted that
the results of both studies are not directly comparable.
Different confounding factors were considered in the
Norwegian study (fibroglandular tissue volume and age)
than in this study (percent dense volume and breast vol-
ume), in combination with different groupings (tertiles
vs quintiles).
In this study, we computed the pressure to the entire
breast as a single value, based on the overall force and
contact area. Because we used MLO views, the pectoral
muscle is also included in the contact area. Therefore,
the computed pressure might not accurately reflect the
pressure on the breast tissue in regions where most le-
sions are located. Since Dustler et al. [32] found that the
resulting pressure distribution during breast compres-
sion is not uniform, and that in some cases the pressure
is highest in the pectoral muscle, this is a limitation of
our study. On the other hand, without knowing the
mechanism that might lead to reduced sensitivity at high
pressure, the issue of pressure measurements remains
open. For instance, if the lesions were missed due to a
reduced blood flow into the breast, perhaps the pressure
at the posterior border of the breast might be an import-
ant factor.
Another limitation of this study is that CC views, and
the per-view lesion sensitivity and specificity, were not
included due to the fact that CC views were not ac-
quired in a substantial portion of the screening examina-
tions at the time of data acquisition. In essence, this
means that the presented results are based on the pres-
sure applied for the acquisition of the MLO view only,
while the screening outcomes are calculated based on
the whole examination, which in the majority of exami-
nations also included CC views. To investigate the effect
of compression in CC view images on the screening
performance, a dataset for which both views are available
should be used. Finally, although this is a dataset span-
ning many years and therefore includes examinations in
which various radiographers performed the acquisitions
and various radiologists interpreted them, it is still a
single-site study with all images acquired with a single
mammographic system model. It is not expected, how-
ever, that compressions performed with other systems
should have an impact on breast compression pressure
and its relationship to screening outcomes.
Our retrospective analysis is performed with mammo-
grams acquired in screening practice. Although the re-
sults and conclusions are based on a large sample of
cases, evidence for our findings would become stronger
if mammograms of individual women could be obtained
who were repeatedly imaged with different compres-
sions. Since such evidence is currently lacking, we feel
that it would not be appropriate to recommend an opti-
mal pressure range based on this study alone. Further
studies are needed to confirm our findings, ideally in-
cluding a study with repeated imaging at different prede-
fined pressures, to investigate lesion visibility as function
of pressure.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study shows a relation between the
applied pressure and the performance of screening
mammography even when taking into account con-
founding effects. The recall rate, false positive rate, and
specificity were affected negatively in the compression
category with the lowest pressure, while the sensitivity
was reduced in the categories with high pressure. Since
this is the first time this has been reported, more re-
search to confirm potential effects of pressure on screen-
ing performance measures is necessary because more
attention to a meaningful standardization of compres-
sion levels might improve mammography in the future.
