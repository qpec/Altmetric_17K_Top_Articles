With Trisomy 13 and 18
Katherine E. Nelson, MD; Laura C. Rosella, PhD; Sanjay Mahant, MD; Astrid Guttmann, MDCM
IMPORTANCE Trisomy 13 and 18 are genetic diagnoses with characteristic physical features,
organ anomalies, and neurodevelopmental disability. Most children with these disorders
die shortly after birth, although limited data suggest some children survive longer. Surgeries
are controversial, and little evidence is available about outcomes.
OBJECTIVE To describe survival and utilization of any type of surgery among children with
trisomy 13 and 18 born over a 21-year period in Ontario, Canada.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study used linked health
administrative databases to identify children born in Ontario between April 1, 1991,
and March 31, 2012, with a diagnosis code for trisomy 13 or 18 on a hospital record in the first
year of life. Survival was calculated from birth and death dates; children living on March 31,
2013, were censored at their last clinical encounter.
EXPOSURES All procedures classified as occurring in an operating room through March 31,
2013, were categorized as major, intermediate, or minor surgeries.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Survival and surgical procedure utilization.
RESULTS The cohorts included 174 children with trisomy 13 (mean [SD] birth weight,
2.5 [0.7] kg; 98 [56.3%] female); and 254 children with trisomy 18 (mean birth weight,
1.8 [0.7] kg; 157 [61.8%] female), with follow-up times of 0 to more than 7000 days. Median
(interquartile range [IQR]) survival times were 12.5 (2-195) days for trisomy 13 and 9 (2-92)
days for trisomy 18. One-year survival for trisomy 13 was 19.8% (95% CI, 14.2%-26.1%) and
12.6% (95% CI, 8.9%-17.1%) for trisomy 18. Ten-year survival for trisomy 13 was 12.9% (95%
CI, 8.4%-18.5%) and 9.8% (95% CI, 6.4%-14.0%) for trisomy 18. Survival did not change over
the study period. Forty-one children (23.6%) with trisomy 13 and 35 children (13.8%) with
trisomy 18 underwent surgeries, ranging from myringotomy to complex cardiac repair.
Median age at first surgery for trisomy 13 was 92 (IQR, 30.5-384.5) days and for trisomy 18,
it was 205.5 (IQR, 20.0-518.0) days. Kaplan-Meier curves showed 1-year survival after first
surgery of 70.7% (95% CI, 54.3%-82.2%; n = 23) for trisomy 13 and 68.6% (95% CI,
50.5%-81.2%; n = 29) for trisomy 18.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among children born with trisomy 13 or 18 in Ontario, early
mortality was the most common outcome, but 10% to 13% survived for 10 years. Among
children who underwent surgical interventions, 1-year survival was high.

T
risomy 13 and 18 are genetic diagnoses associated with
characteristicphysicalfeaturesandorgananomalies,of-
ten including cardiac malformations and neurologic
impairments1 that occur in approximately 8 to 15 per 100 000
live births.2 Approximately 50% of infants with trisomy 13 and
18 die during the first weeks of life.3 Survival during the first
year of life is described in 12 population-based studies (sample
size range, 19-8750 participants),3,4 but survival beyond 1 year
is infrequently analyzed. Case series and parent surveys have
identified longer-term survivors.5,6 The rarity of the diagno-
ses and low 1-year survival rates have meant that longer-term
survivors are uncommon in population-based studies,3 al-
though a large study conducted in 2016 found higher 5-year
survivalthanpreviouslydescribed.7Clinically,longer-termsur-
vivorswithtrisomy18aredescribedassociallyinteractivewith
significant motor and cognitive delays (eg, verbalizing a few
words); children with trisomy 13 also have severe neurologic
impairment.8 Knowledge about the quality of life of children
with trisomy 13 and 18 is limited.9 Several studies have high-
lighted the need for better description of longer-term
survivors.3,10
Lack of information about longer-term survival compli-
cates clinical decision making. Common anomalies that may
require intervention include cardiac septal defects in both tri-
somy 13 and 18 and cleft palate in trisomy 13.1 Common sur-
geries in this population include feeding-related (eg, Nissen
fundoplication), cardiac, and orthopedic interventions.11 How-
ever, surgical interventions for children with trisomy 13 and
18 are controversial.8,10,12 Some clinicians argue that interven-
tions, especially cardiac procedures, are futile,12,13 in part be-
cause of extrapolation of early mortality statistics. More data
about survival in general and after interventions are impor-
tant to guide decision making. This study describes survival
and surgical procedures over a 22-year period among chil-
dren with trisomy 13 and 18 in Ontario, Canada’
s largest prov-
ince, with a population of approximately 13 million.
Methods
Study Data
Children were followed-up over time in multiple health
administrative and demographic data sources in the single-
payer health care system in Ontario. These data sets were
linked by encoded identifiers and analyzed at the Institute
for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES). The Registered Per-
sons Database was used for demographic and vital statistics
for Ontario residents eligible for health care; the Discharge
Abstract Database for hospitalizations; Same Day Surgery
records for outpatient procedures; census data for neighbor-
hood income quintile; Ontario Health Insurance Plan billing
for the most recent clinical encounter; and the Ontario Vital
Statistics Death File for death data. All databases use
encoded health card numbers as identifiers, except the vital
statistics database, which requires probabilistic linkage
(96.2% linkage rate). Ontario legislation governing ICES
allows use of health administrative data without individual
consent for health system research, provided strict privacy
guidelines are met. Institutional policy requires suppression
of cell sizes under 6 to ensure nonidentification. Research
ethics approval was obtained from the Hospital for Sick Chil-
dren and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, and adminis-
trative approval from the University of Toronto.
The cohorts were constructed using diagnostic codes from
hospital records. All children born in Ontario between April 1,
1991, and March 31, 2012, who had a diagnostic code (Inter-
national Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision or Tenth Re-
vision [ICD-9 or ICD-10]) for trisomy 13 (ICD-9, 758.1 or ICD-
10, Q91.4-Q91.7) or for trisomy 18 (ICD-9, 758.2 or ICD-10,
Q91.0-Q91.3) on a hospital record in the first year of life were
included. To ensure accurate calculation of incidence, chil-
dren were excluded if they were not Ontario residents at birth
or, among children missing birth records, if they were not hos-
pitalized in the first 7 days of life. Children with irreconcil-
able data errors, including no valid identifier for linkage, un-
certain genetic diagnosis (equal diagnosis codes for trisomy 13
and 18 or a diagnosis code for trisomy 21), and birth dates oc-
curring after death dates were also excluded. Data are re-
ported by fiscal year (April 1 to March 31).
Survival
Survival was calculated using death dates from the Ontario
Vital Statistics Death File (available through 2012) and the
Registered Persons Database. At study end (March 31, 2013),
children without death data were censored from the date of
their most recent clinical encounter. To meet privacy
requirements, survival curves were truncated when 6 chil-
dren remained.
Surgeries
Hospital records were evaluated for procedure codes through
March 31, 2013. Procedures were classified into organ system
categories according to coding system chapter (eg, codes start-
ing with 47 in the Canadian Classification of Procedures were
labeled cardiac). Surgeries, defined as procedures likely per-
formed in an operating room, were identified using a scheme
published by the US Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project.14
A published table of projected lengths of stay was used to as-
sess anticipated surgical invasiveness.15 Same-day surgeries
were classified as minor, surgeries with 1-day projected lengths
ofstayasintermediate,andallothersasmajor.Projectedlength
Key Points
Question What are the survival and utilization of surgery among
children with trisomy 13 and 18 in Ontario between 1991 and 2013?
Findings In this population-based retrospective cohort study of
174 children with trisomy 13 and 254 children with trisomy 18, early
mortality was common, but 10% to 13% survived for 10 years.
Among children who underwent surgery, 1-year survival was 69%
to 71%.
Meaning Long-term survival is more common than previously
thought, and the potential for surgical benefit should be
investigated.

of stay was also used to create a hierarchy of surgeries within
each organ system (eAppendix in the Supplement).
To avoid double-counting complex surgeries with mul-
tipleprocedurecodes,childrenwithmultipleproceduresinthe
same organ system on the same date were assessed. Using the
hierarchy in eAppendix (in the Supplement), the primary sur-
gery by organ system and date was included in the analysis.
Three pediatrician authors (K.E.N., S.M., A.G.) reviewed sur-
gery categorization and application of the hierarchy to mul-
tiple procedure codes. Details are available from the authors.
Covariates
Birth weight and postal code were obtained from the birth
record. Census-based markers of rurality and socioeconomic
status were derived from postal codes. The Rurality Index of
Ontario, which assesses population density and health care
access, defined rural or urban residence.16 Individuals were
assigned the income quintile of their census dissemination
area (400-700 people). ICD-10 trisomy codes, in use after
2002, identified children with mosaicism (Q91.1 or Q91.5) or
translocation (Q91.2 or Q91.6). Children without ICD-10 codes
identifying cytogenetic status (ie, children born before 2002
and children with general trisomy ICD-10 codes) were classi-
fied as not specified. Congenital anomalies were defined by
diagnostic codes contained in chapter 14 of ICD-9 (Congenital
Anomalies) or chapter XVII of ICD-10 (Congenital Malforma-
tions, Deformations, and Chromosomal Anomalies), exclud-
ing genetic diagnoses. Ontario birth rates were acquired from
Statistics Canada.17
Analyses
Comparisons of demographic characteristics of children with
trisomy 13 and 18 with those of the general Ontario newborn
population were made using χ2 tests. Clinical characteristics
ofchildrensurviving7daysto1yearwerecomparedwiththose
surviving more than 1 year using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for
birth weight and χ2 tests for sex, cytogenetic status, income
quintile, rurality, and type and number of organ systems af-
fected by congenital anomalies. Kaplan-Meier survival curves
were created for children with trisomy 13 and 18 and for sur-
vival after first surgery for those undergoing surgeries. To test
if survival statistics were inflated by inappropriate inclusion
of children in the cohorts, a sensitivity analysis evaluated a
more stringent case definition, which required that children
with more than 1 hospitalization have more than 1 discharge
diagnosis code of trisomy 13 or 18. Survival among the full co-
hort was compared with survival of those meeting the stricter
definition with a log-rank test. Conditional survival, which is
the likelihood of surviving to the next time point among chil-
dren alive at the previous time point, was calculated. Birth
prevalence was graphed over time using loess curves, which
are unrestricted nonparametric curves. Trends in birth preva-
lence were modeled using negative binomial regression, and
rates were generated using Ontario live births as an offset. The
association of birth year with survival time was tested with a
Cox proportional hazards model, using year as an indepen-
dent predictor. The Cox models did not contain time-
dependent covariates. The proportional hazards assumption
was tested graphically and statistically and was satisfied in all
models.Toinvestigatepotentialbiasfromcomparingolderand
newer cohorts, a sensitivity analysis using the Cox models
tested short-term survival (maximum 2 years) to ensure more
homogeneouspopulations.Negativebinomialregressionmod-
els were used to assess change in frequency of surgeries over
time and were adjusted for age categories to account for chang-
ing age distributions. These models included data from all sur-
geries, including surgeries performed on the same child at dif-
ferent times. Median age at procedure and postoperative
survival were calculated for the most common surgeries. To
maximize information while meeting privacy requirements,
median age and postoperative survival were assessed based
on the following criteria: (1) procedures (ie, 1 child undergo-
ing 2 surgeries would contribute separate data for each pro-
cedure); and (2) individual children. R version 3.1.2 was used
tocomparecohortdemographicswiththegeneralOntarionew-
born population and to evaluate birth prevalence over time;
all other analyses were performed using SAS version 6.1. Test-
ing was 2-sided, and P values less than .05 were considered
significant.
Results
Demographics and Prevalence
In Ontario, 174 children with trisomy 13 and 254 children with
trisomy 18 were liveborn between 1991 and 2012 (eFigure 1 in
the Supplement). Compared with the general Ontario new-
born population, infants with trisomy 13 (mean [SD] birth
weight, 2.5 kg [0.7]; 98 [56.3%] female); and infants with tri-
somy 18 [mean [SD] birth weight 1.8 kg [0.7]; 157 [61.8%] fe-
male)hadlowerbirthweights,andinfantswithtrisomy18were
more likely to be female (Table 1). eTable 1 in the Supplement
shows the most common congenital anomaly diagnoses by or-
gan system. The incidence of trisomy 13 and 18 was stable over
time with mean birth rates for trisomy 13 of 6.0 (95% CI, 5.2-
7.0) and for trisomy 18 of 8.8 (95% CI, 7.7-9.9) per 100 000 live
births (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
Survival
Children with trisomy 13 and 18 were observed from 0 to
more than 7000 days. At the end of follow-up, 24 children
with trisomy 13 and 23 children with trisomy 18 were alive; 7
children with either trisomy (1.6%) left the province before
the end of the study. The primary analysis had no missing
data. Survival did not change over time. Hazard ratios for
birth year were 1.00 (95% CI, 0.97-1.03) for trisomy 13 and
1.00 (95% CI, 0.98-1.03) for trisomy 18. This finding was
unchanged when maximum survival was limited to 2 years.
Median survival time for children with trisomy 13 was 12.5
(IQR, 2-195) days and for trisomy 18 it was 9 (IQR, 2-92) days
(Figure 1). Children meeting the stricter case definition had a
shorter median survival time of 7.5 (IQR, 1-94) days for tri-
somy 13 and 6 (IQR, 1-74) days for trisomy 18, but their overall
survival was not statistically different by log-rank test
(P = .14 for trisomy 13; P = .24 for trisomy 18). Early deaths
were common, but fewer deaths occurred after 3 months in

trisomy 13 and after 6 months in trisomy 18 (eFigure 3 in the
Supplement). One-year survival was 19.8% (95% CI, 14.2%-
26.1%) for children with trisomy 13, and 12.6% (95% CI, 8.9%-
17.1%) for children with trisomy 18. At 10 years, 12.9% (95%
CI, 8.4%-18.5% [n = 13]) of the trisomy 13 cohort was alive,
and 9.8% (95% CI, 6.4%-14.0% [n = 16]) of the trisomy 18
cohort was alive (Figure 1). For 51 infants with trisomy 13 who
were alive at 30 days, 1-year survival was 46.6% (95% CI,
33.3%-60.1%) and for 63 infants with trisomy 18 who were
alive at 30 days, 1-year survival was 36.1% (95% CI, 24.7%-
48.3%). Among 44 infants with trisomy 13 who were alive at
6 months, 50.5% (95% CI, 35.4%-65.6%) were alive at 10
years and among 40 infants with trisomy 18 who were alive
at 6 months, 60.0% (95% CI, 43.7%-75.2%) were alive at 10
years (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Nearly 80% of the
cohorts had cause of death on their death certificates listed
as trisomy 13 or 18, an associated anomaly (eg, ventricular
septal defect), or multiple congenital anomalies, with most of
the remainder listed as acute infections or general diagnoses
(eg, perinatal conditions). eTable 3 in the Supplement shows
the characteristics of children surviving 7 days to 1 year com-
pared with those surviving more than 1 year, and few factors
were associated with longer-term survival. Among children
with trisomy 13, only mosaic- or translocation-type trisomy
was associated with longer survival. For children with tri-
somy 18, male gender, higher birth weight, and mosaic- or
translocation-type trisomy were associated with longer sur-
vival. Longer-term survivors with trisomy 18 also had more
neurologic diagnoses and more admissions in the first year of
life. Having cardiac or neurologic diagnoses or having con-
genital anomalies in more organ systems was not associated
with shorter survival for either trisomy 13 or 18.
Surgical Procedures
Forty-one children (23.6%) with trisomy 13 underwent 135 sur-
gical procedures (34 were major and 61 were intermediate).
Thirty-five children (13.8%) with trisomy 18 underwent 92 sur-
geries(27weremajorand34wereintermediate).Ear,nose,and
throatprocedureswerethemostcommonamongchildrenwith
trisomy 13, accounting for 43 procedures among 17 children.
Procedures to implant medical devices were the most fre-
quent for children with trisomy 18 (20 children underwent 26
of these procedures). Among children undergoing surgery, 16
children (39.0%) with trisomy 13 had 1 lifetime procedure and
15 children (42.8%) with trisomy 18 had 1 lifetime procedure;
15children(36.6%)withtrisomy13and7children(20.0%)with
trisomy 18 had 4 or more lifetime procedures. The median age
at first surgery was 92 days (IQR, 30.5-384.5) for children with
trisomy 13 and 205.5 days (IQR, 20.0-518.0) for children with
trisomy 18. Of children undergoing surgery, 8 (19.5%) with tri-
somy 13 were younger than 14 days old at time of first surgery
as were 6 (17.1%) with trisomy 18.. Tables 2 and 3 display out-
comes associated with surgeries by organ system, and eTable
4 in the Supplement lists the specific surgeries. Most surger-
ies occurred at a median age of older than 6 months except
medical device placement in children with trisomy 13 and first
cardiac or gastrointestinal/genitourinary procedure in tri-
somy 18. Median survival after first surgery was more than 1
year in all organ system categories except ophthalmic surger-
ies in trisomy 13 and cardiac surgeries in trisomy 18. Figure 2
is a Kaplan-Meier curve showing survival after the first sur-
gery. Of children with trisomy 13, 87.8% (95% CI, 73.1%-
94.7% [n = 36) survived 30 days and 70.7% (95% CI, 54.3%-
82.2% [n = 29]) survived 1 year after their first procedure. For
trisomy 18, 82.9% (95% CI, 65.8%-91.9% [n = 30]) survived 30
days and 68.6% (95% CI, 50.5%-81.2% [n = 23]) survived 1 year
after their first surgery. After adjustment for age, the inter-
vention rates increased by 4% per fiscal year for both trisomy
13 and 18; these changes were not statistically significant over
time (P = .11 for both, eTable 5 in the Supplement).

studies did not evaluate survival beyond 1 year.22-25 Four stud-
ies (2 studies for trisomy 18 only3,26 and 2 studies for both7,27)
identified individuals living beyond 5 years. The most recent
study reported 5-year survival of 9.7% for children with tri-
somy 13 and 12.9% among children with trisomy 18.7 In this
study, cardiac and neurological diagnoses were not associ-
ated with shorter survival, and children with shorter survival
didnothaveanomaliesinmoreorgansystems.Onepriorstudy
also found no association between cardiac defects and
survival.3
More than 20% of children with trisomy 13 and more than
10% of children with trisomy 18 in this study underwent 1 or
more interventions, ranging from minor procedures (eg, myr-
ingotomy) to major cardiac repairs (eg, hemi-Fontan). One-
year survival after first surgery was approximately 70%. Given
the debate about surgery in these populations,13,28,29 this sur-
vival likely reflects both careful patient selection and proce-
duralbenefit.Onepriorpopulation-basedstudyreported2sur-
geries among 30 children with trisomy 13 and none for 67

ies have reported 1-year survival of 17% to 100%.30,31 No stud-
ieshaveexploredhowquality-of-lifefactorsintodecisionmak-
ing around procedural benefit.32
One factor likely contributing to higher survival and
intervention rates found in this study was the use of health
administrative data. Ontario’
s single-payer health care sys-
tem captures all surgical procedures and deaths, and children
leaving the province were censored after their last clinical
encounter. In contrast, most population-based studies use
birth defect registries, which rely on case notification by hos-
pital or laboratory personnel. Most registry-based studies use
posthoc linkage to death registries to calculate survival,
which creates challenges when children do not have verified
dates of death at end of follow-up. Although some research-
ers used ancillary data to confirm vital status, other studies
either excluded children without death dates or assumed
children were alive at study end. eTable 6 (in the Supple-
ment) describes study approaches to missing data. Differing
strategies can substantially affect survival statistics. Two
recent studies used data from the same registry over similar
time periods (1985-2003 and 1985-2007). One study22
reported 1-year survival of 13.8% for trisomy 13 and of 1.6%
for trisomy 18; the other study33 reported 1-year survival of
3.3% for trisomy 13 and of 6.0% for trisomy 18. Additionally,
many registry-based studies did not have access to medical
records, including surgeries.3,4,23,24,27,34,35

Administrative data sources have limitations, especially
related to cohort creation. Unlike registry-based studies with
laboratory-confirmed diagnoses, this study defined the
population with diagnostic codes listed on hospital discharge
records. Study population underascertainment could arise
from several causes. Infants could die before diagnosis, but
this would be uncommon because most trisomy 13 and 18
diagnoses are established prenatally.22 When liveborn infants
die soon after birth, including in the delivery room, both a
hospital discharge record and a death certificate are required.
Diagnostic data and cause of death are ascertained by the
same physician so the hospital record should include the pre-
sumptive diagnosis. This study’
s reliance on hospital records
would miss home births resulting in out-of-hospital deaths;
however, that scenario would be rare for 2 reasons. In
Ontario, home deliveries by midwives are not currently used
for palliative care or for infants with abnormal prenatal diag-
noses. Also, clinical policy specifies that infants born at home
with previously undiagnosed congenital anomalies are to be
transferred to a hospital. The use of administrative data also
means that the study cohort might include children without
a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of trisomy 13 or 18, or chil-
dren whose records were mistakenly coded. However, sensi-
tivity analyses showed no difference in survival with a
stricter case definition. Additionally, the prevalence reported
for trisomy 13 and 18 (6.0 and 8.8 per 100 000 live births) was
on the lower end of previously described ranges of 4-13.6 for
trisomy 1322,36 and 8.5-90 for trisomy 18.22,37 If the cohort
contained a large proportion of misclassified children, the
birth prevalence would likely be inflated. Also, frequencies of
diagnoses for specific congenital anomalies were similar to
those in other studies.38 A general validity analysis of diag-
nostic codes in this study’
s data source demonstrated a posi-
tive predictive value of 0.82 (IQR, 0.74-0.89).39
The most important study limitation is the lack of
quality-of-life measures to add important context to the sur-
vival data; this study alone is insufficient to support decision

making for children with trisomy 13 and 18. The limited lit-
erature on quality of life in these populations has relied on
parental report. One study of families belonging to online
support groups found that “almost all parents reported a
positive view of family life and the quality of life of their
child,
” and “described surviving children as happy.
”40 Infor-
mation about neurocognitive developmental outcomes is
sparse, with a few small studies describing a spectrum of
disability.5,9 In addition to this study’
s data about survival
duration, measurement of quality of life in the context of
major surgeries will be important to help families and clini-
cians balance the risks and benefits of interventions.
This study has several other limitations. First, identifica-
tion of children with mosaic or translocation-type trisomy 13
and 18 was incomplete. The ICD-9 codes used before 2002 did
not specify cytogenetic diagnosis. As in other studies in which
cytogenetic status could not be verified,3,7,23,33,35 children with
mosaic- and translocation-type trisomy were included in this
study’
s primary analysis. This decision likely increased rates
of longer-term survival compared with studies including only
children with full trisomy 13 or 18. Second, 7 children (1.6%)
lefttheprovincebeforetheendoffollow-upandtheymayhave
had subsequent uncaptured surgical procedures. Third, data
onprenataldiagnoses,terminations,andmiscarriageswereun-
available, so this study reports liveborn prevalence rather than
true prevalence. Fourth, to meet privacy requirements, pro-
cedures were grouped by organ system and may include data
on multiple surgeries from the same child, even though these
groupings are not homogeneous, and individual rates would
be more clinically relevant. Also the number and heteroge-
neity of the procedures limits the analysis of surgical timing
and postoperative survival trends. Further, this study cannot
determine if interventions caused longer survival. However,
because of the rarity of these diagnoses and variability in their
presentation, it is challenging to generate definitive evidence
aboutinterventionefficacy.Inparticular,therandomizedclini-
cal trial necessary to test for a causal relationship between sur-
gery and survival would be neither ethical nor feasible so the
information available from administrative data, while incom-
plete,isuseful.Thisstudydidnotassessforcomorbiditiesother
than congenital anomalies because of the risk of time con-
founding the association between comorbidities and sur-
vival. For example, the increased number of neurologic con-
genital anomaly diagnoses among longer-term survivors with
trisomy 18 likely reflects an increased probability of undergo-
ing neuroimaging over time. Additionally, the study data do
not include details on important demographic and clinical fac-
tors or family treatment goals.
Conclusions
Among children born with trisomy 13 or 18 in Ontario, early
mortality was the most common outcome, but 10% to 13% sur-
vived for 10 years. Among children who underwent surgical
interventions, 1-year survival was high.
