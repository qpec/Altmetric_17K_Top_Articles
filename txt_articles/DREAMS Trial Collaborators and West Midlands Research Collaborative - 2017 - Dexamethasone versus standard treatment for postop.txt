Dexamethasone versus standard treatment for postoperative 
nausea and vomiting in gastrointestinal surgery: randomised 
controlled trial (DREAMS Trial)
DREAMS Trial Collaborators and West Midlands Research Collaborative
ABSTRACT
ObjeCtives
To determine whether preoperative dexamethasone 
reduces postoperative vomiting in patients 
undergoing elective bowel surgery and whether it is 
associated with other measurable benefits during 
recovery from surgery, including quicker return to oral 
diet and reduced length of stay.
Design
Pragmatic two arm parallel group randomised trial with 
blinded postoperative care and outcome assessment.
setting
45 UK hospitals.
PartiCiPants
1350 patients aged 18 or over undergoing elective open 
or laparoscopic bowel surgery for malignant or benign 
pathology.
interventiOns
Addition of a single dose of 8 mg intravenous 
dexamethasone at induction of anaesthesia compared 
with standard care.
Main OutCOMe Measures
Primary outcome: reported vomiting within 24 hours 
reported by patient or clinician. Secondary outcomes: 
vomiting with 72 and 120 hours reported by patient or 
clinician; use of antiemetics and postoperative nausea 
and vomiting at 24, 72, and 120 hours rated by patient; 
fatigue and quality of life at 120 hours or discharge and 
at 30 days; time to return to fluid and food intake; 
length of hospital stay; adverse events.
results
1350 participants were recruited and randomly allocated 
to additional dexamethasone (n=674) or standard care 
(n=676) at induction of anaesthesia. Vomiting within 24 
hours of surgery occurred in 172 (25.5%) participants in 
the dexamethasone arm and 223 (33.0%) allocated 
standard care (number needed to treat (NNT) 13, 95% 
confidence interval 5 to 22; P=0.003). Additional 
postoperative antiemetics were given (on demand) to 
265 (39.3%) participants allocated dexamethasone and 
351 (51.9%) allocated standard care (NNT 8, 5 to 11; 
P<0.001). Reduction in on demand antiemetics remained 
up to 72 hours. There was no increase in complications.
COnClusiOns
Addition of a single dose of 8 mg intravenous 
dexamethasone at induction of anaesthesia 
significantly reduces both the incidence of 
postoperative nausea and vomiting at 24 hours and 
the need for rescue antiemetics for up to 72 hours in 
patients undergoing large and small bowel surgery, 
with no increase in adverse events.

Introduction
Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are the most 
common complications after surgery, affecting more 
than 30% of patients,1 
2  and are reported by patients to 
be two of the five most undesirable outcomes.3  Evidence 
has been conflicting regarding type of surgery and risk 
of PONV, but a systematic review has shown that laparo-
scopic surgery and increasing duration of surgery are 
independent predictors of higher risk.4  There are many 
published studies reporting increased risk after urologi-
cal or biliary tract surgery, but there is a relative paucity 
of data regarding small or large bowel surgery. A recent 
study has shown that even after introduction of an 
enhanced recovery protocol, nearly 35% of patients 
undergoing colonic resection required antiemetics on 
demand in the postoperative period,5  and so PONV 
remains a common adverse event even within a selected 
optimised population.5  PONV is related to anaesthetic 
use in many operations, but in bowel surgery, the bowel 
handling, resection, and associated intra-abdominal 
contamination promote an ileus of variable duration 
and has a major effect on PONV. PONV contributes to 
both delayed recovery and delayed discharge, and its 
prevention is of particular importance after gastrointes-
tinal surgery because these patients often have poor 
preoperative nutrition, as highlighted by a UK nutrition 
survey in which 40% of patients with gastrointestinal 
disease were deemed at high risk of malnutrition on 
admission to hospital, significantly higher than the 
baseline for all hospital admissions.6
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are the most common complications 
after surgery, affecting more than 30% of patients. In patients undergoing bowel 
surgery PONV often contributes to delayed recovery and is especially important 
because these patients might also have impaired preoperative nutrition
Dexamethasone has been shown to have a substantial benefit in the prevention of 
PONV in patient undergoing low and intermediate risk surgery but has not been 
evaluated in those undergoing bowel surgery
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
In patients undergoing bowel surgery, a single dose of 8 mg intravenous dexamethasone 
at induction of anaesthesia (in addition to standard care) had no significant increase in 
adverse events and reduced episodes of vomiting and patient rated clinically important 
postoperative nausea and vomiting for 24 hours after surgery
Patients receiving of a prophylactic single dose of 8 mg of intravenous dexamethasone 
before surgery also required fewer postoperative antiemetics for up to 72 hours

2
Dexamethasone is a potent corticosteroid that has 
been reported to influence patient and clinician based 
outcome measures of recovery.7 8  It has been carefully 
assessed in the prevention of PONV in low and inter-
mediate risk surgery and shown to have a substantial 
benefit. In a trial of over 4000 patients that assessed 
64 different combinations of anaesthetic measures, 
dexamethasone effectively reduced PONV.9  Only 11% 
of patients, however, underwent abdominal proce-
dures, of whom only a small fraction underwent bowel 
surgery.9 The study found that multiple interventions 
(use of more than one antiemetic) should be reserved 
for high risk patients. As outlined above, patients 
 
undergoing large or small bowel surgery have not his-
torically been thought to be at high risk.
Dexamethasone is one of several drugs recom-
mended for patients at moderate and high risk of PONV 
in the consensus guidelines from the Society for Ambu-
latory Anesthesia10  and is commonly advocated in pro-
tocols for enhanced recovery after gastrointestinal 
surgery (ERAS).11-13  Its value in bowel surgery, however, 
is unproved and its use is far from universal. Two single 
centre trials, totalling 100 patients undergoing bowel 
surgery, reported no benefit of dexamethasone on 
PONV.14 15 Before designing this trial, we surveyed six 
major colorectal units in the West Midlands region and 
found that only 25% of colorectal patients were receiv-
ing dexamethasone on induction of anaesthesia.
Prolonged use of steroids such as dexamethasone 
can have dangerous side effects, including an increased 
risk of wound infection and anastomotic leak, which 
adversely affect recovery from gastrointestinal surgery. 
A single dose, however, does not seem to be associated 
with this increased risk. Though a systematic review of 
single dose methylprednisolone in patients undergoing 
cardiac, general, or trauma surgery showed no signifi-
cant increase in these adverse events,16 concerns among 
the surgical community might still be limiting its use 
during surgery of the large and small intestine.
The mechanism of action of dexamethasone is poorly 
understood, but it seems to be most effective when it is 
administered before the start of surgery, when it can 
also reduce surgery induced inflammation.17  A 
meta-analysis of patients undergoing thyroidectomy 
found that dexamethasone at 8-10 mg had the greatest 
effect in reducing PONV.18
The DREAMS trial examined whether preoperative 
dexamethasone reduces postoperative vomiting in 
patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal surgery. 
Reduction of PONV in this group of patients could improve 
the surgical experience and also fast track recovery and 
decrease postoperative complications. In assessing 
whether multi-modal use of antiemetics in this cohort 
improves outcomes, we designed a pragmatic trial that 
would incorporate the use of one standard antiemetic with 
or without the addition of a single dose of 8 mg intrave-
nous dexamethasone, a drug with proved antiemetic 
properties (in other groups of patients) but that has a dif-
ferent mechanism of action to the other commonly used 
antiemetics. If beneficial, dexamethasone could be a valu-
able addition for patients undergoing intestinal surgery.
Methods
study design and eligibility
DREAMS is a pragmatic blinded multicentre randomised 
controlled trial of 1350 participants comparing the effects 
of a single dose of 8 mg intravenous dexamethasone 
against standard care on patient recovery after small and 
large bowel surgery. Though the anaesthetist knew the 
treatment allocation, patients and clinical staff involved in 
postoperative care and data collection were blinded to it. 
The trial included an internal pilot study of 150 participants 
to assess recruitment rates, the randomisation process, 
patient pathway, and data collection tools (outcomes from 
participants in the pilot phase are included in this main 
trial analysis and have not been analysed previously).
Eligible patients were adults (aged 18 and over) with 
ability to consent who were undergoing elective open 
or laparoscopic bowel surgery for malignant or benign 
pathology. Patients were approached at the first outpa-
tient clinic, at the preoperative assessment clinic, or on 
admission for surgery. Once eligibility had been con-
firmed, patients gave informed consent either at the 
preoperative visit or on admission. Patients who were 
pregnant or who had gastrointestinal obstruction, dia-
betes, glaucoma, or active gastric ulceration confirmed 
by endoscopy were ineligible (all patients had blood 
glucose concentrations checked to exclude undiag-
nosed hyperglycaemia). Those with a known adverse 
reaction to dexamethasone or who were taking any sys-
temic steroids (excluding steroid inhalers, supposito-
ries, pessaries, eye drops, one-off local injections to a 
joint, or topical preparations) were excluded from the 
trial. Patients previously taking regular oral or intrave-
nous steroids had to have stopped taking these drugs at 
least three months before trial entry to be eligible.
interventions
All patients underwent general anaesthesia and received a 
routine antiemetic (other than dexamethasone) preopera-
tively as standard care determined by the anaesthetist. The 
key specified standard of care was that a single dose of an 
antiemetic would be given before the start of surgery. The 
anaesthetic team were directed to obtain the treatment 
allocation from the trials unit after induction of anaesthe-
sia and administration of their choice of antiemetic, thus 
ensuring allocations were concealed until standard care 
had been delivered. Those patients allocated to dexameth-
asone received 8 mg intravenous dexamethasone before 
the start of surgery; those allocated to control received 
nothing in addition to standard care. All antiemetics were 
administered before knife to skin and no further antiemet-
ics were administered during the operation.
Postoperative antiemetics were administered at the 
request of the patient. The treating anaesthetists were not 
involved in postoperative care other than in exceptional cir-
cumstances for medical emergencies in the acute postoper-
ative period. Dexamethasone was not prescribed within the 
first 24 hours postoperatively for participants in either arm.

a web based central randomisation service at the Uni-
versity of Birmingham clinical trials unit, with tele-
phone backup. The system used a computerised 
minimisation procedure to reduce the risk of chance 
imbalances in important stratification variables of sex, 
smoking status (yes, no), type of surgery (open, laparo-
scopic), intended postoperative analgesia (patient con-
trolled analgesia (PCA), epidural), American Society of 
Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), and 
whether participants were within the enhanced recov-
ery after surgery (ERAS) pathway (yes, no). The record 
of administration of dexamethasone was coded only 
on the trial specific intraoperative form by the anaes-
thetist, and not in the routine anaesthetic record 
within the medical notes, to ensure staff involved in 
postoperative care remained blinded to the treatment 
allocation. Each form was placed in a sealed envelope 
and sent to the trials unit. We aimed to minimise the 
impact of the anaesthetist being aware of the alloca-
tion by timing of randomisation to be after administra-
tion of the standard antiemetic, ensuring that no 
paperwork existed in the patient notes and that anaes-
thetists were clearly informed that they should not 
reveal the allocation to patients or clinical staff. The 
same anaesthetist would only exceptionally be 
involved in postoperative care, and the possibility that 
they would introduce a bias in postoperative anti-
emetic administration was judged minimal.
Outcome measures
The primary outcome measure was any vomiting within 
24 hours postoperatively, defined as episodes of expul-
sion of gastric content.19 To ensure that no episodes of 
vomiting were excluded from the analysis, patients who 
had vomiting episodes reported by either themselves or 
by staff were deemed to have experienced vomiting.
Secondary outcome measures included the number 
of episodes of vomiting postoperatively (with an inter-
val of five minutes defining separate episodes), the use 
of postoperative antiemetics, severity of postoperative 
nausea and vomiting (measured with the PONV inten-
sity scale20 ), fatigue (measured with the FACIT-F (func-
tional assessment of chronic illness-fatigue) 
questionnaire21 ), time to toleration of oral diet, length 
of hospital stay, and health related quality of life (mea-
sured with EQ-5D-3L22 
23). Nausea, vomiting, and the use 
of antiemetics were measured during the 0-24 hour, 
25-72 hour, and 73-120 hour postoperative periods; 
fatigue and health related quality of life measures were 
recorded on discharge. Outcomes are reported at all 
time points when they were measured. Participants 
were seen 30 days postoperatively and assessments 
made of wound and chest infections and other compli-
cations; attempts were made by telephone to contact 
participants who did not attend.
statistical analysis
The sample size was chosen to detect a 24% propor-
tional reduction in the number of participants 
 
experiencing vomiting in the first 24 hours after surgery 
(corresponding to a reduction from 37% to 28% based 
on a large factorial trial9). The initial sample size of 950 
patients provided 80% power to detect this difference 
(at a two tailed significance level of 0.05, allowing for 
10% loss to follow-up). The independent data monitor-
ing committee met three times and reviewed interim 
analyses at time points when 365, 700, and 1170 partici-
pants had been recruited. Because of faster than 
expected recruitment, at their second meeting the 
 
committee advised increasing power to 90%, raising 
the final target sample size to 1320. At the same time, 
the committee also clarified that the primary outcome 
should include episodes of vomiting reported by both 
patients and clinicians recorded in patient notes to 
ensure that all episodes were captured. To investigate 
the impact of their decision, we also report (as a sensi-
tivity analysis) the effect of treatment separately for 
vomiting episodes documented by clinicians and 
reported by patients.
Participants were analysed according to their alloca-
tion regardless of the treatment received. We calculated 
proportions of participants in each group experiencing 
vomiting, nausea, receiving on demand antiemetics, 
and returning to oral diet in each group and described 
treatment effects with risk ratios and numbers needed 
to treat for the 0-24, 25-72, and 73-120 hour postoperative 
periods. The number of on demand antiemetics given 
postoperatively, PONV, fatigue, and quality of life 
scores were summarised with means and standard 
deviations. All treatment effects are presented with 95% 
confidence intervals. For comparisons of dexametha-
sone versus no dexamethasone, we used t tests for con-
tinuous variables, χ2 tests for categorical variables, and 
χ2 tests for trend for ordinal variables. In the primary 
analysis we assumed that patients who had been dis-
charged or had missing data were no longer experienc-
ing vomiting or using additional antiemetics and 
explored the impact of this assumption in a sensitivity 
analysis. We assessed the consistency of the primary 
treatment effect across the stratification variables using 
Cochran’s test for heterogeneity for categorical vari-
ables and the Mantel-Haenszel tests of association for 
ordinal variables. Analysis of nausea and vomiting 
scores, fatigue, and quality of life reported by patients 
was restricted to those for whom data were available, 
and analyses of change from baseline were undertaken 
as a sensitivity analysis when possible. We analysed 
data on length of stay using log rank methods. All 
reported P values are two tailed, and P<0.05 was con-
sidered significant. All analyses were performed with 
SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute) or Stata V13.0 (StataCorp).
Patient involvement
The trial was discussed and presented to patient advo-
cates (at Independent Cancer Patients’ Voice), and the 
conduct of the trial was overseen by a patient advocate 
on the management team (Lindy Berkman), with spe-
cific input to the patient information sheet, consent, 
primary endpoint, and patient follow-up of the trial. A 
summary of the findings of the trial has been provided 
to the recruiting centres for dissemination to the trial 
participants.

Results
Patients’ characteristics
From July 2011 to January 2014, we recruited 1350 partic-
ipants from 45 UK sites; 674 were randomly allocated to 
receive 8 mg intravenous dexamethasone at induction 
and 676 to standard induction without dexamethasone 
(fig 1). An additional 1544 participants were screened 
for inclusion but did not meet the criteria (728 (47
.2%) 
were ineligible, 393 declined to participate (25.4%), 
study staff were not available to recruit 285 (18.5%), and 
reasons were unknown for 138 (8.9%)), and seven gave 
consent but not randomised. Five participants did not 
receive dexamethasone as allocated, and 10 partici-
pants from the control arm received dexamethasone.
Patient demographics (table 1 ) and anaesthetic 
agents, type/duration of surgery, and planned postop-
erative analgesia (table 2) were similarly distributed 
across treatment groups. Most participants underwent 
major bowel surgery (mean duration 226 mins), and 
1321 (97
.9%) had a bowel resection and/or stoma forma-
tion/closure. A high proportion (856, 63%) underwent a 
laparoscopic or laparoscopic assisted procedure. Stan-
dard preoperative antiemetics were given to 1298 (96%) 
participants before randomisation.
Contrary to the protocol, 55 (8%) participants in the 
dexamethasone arm and 134 (20%) in the standard care 
arm received more than one routine antiemetic preoper-
atively. The types of antiemetics used were comparable 
between the two arms (table 2).
One participant was found to be ineligible on day 1 of 
the study and withdrawn from follow-up. Follow-up 
data were available on 1344 (99.6%) for assessments at 
24 hours (primary outcome) and on 1327 (98.3%) at 72 
hours, and 1115 (82.6%) at 120 hours (secondary out-
comes). Figure 1 shows the number of patients who 
returned patient reported outcome assessments. Con-
tact was made with 1311 patients at 30 days to assess 
postoperative complications.
Postoperative vomiting
Overall, 395 (29.3%) participants experienced the pri-
mary outcome of postoperative vomiting within 24 hours 
of surgery. Significantly fewer did so in the dexametha-
sone arm (n=172, 25.5%) than in the standard care arm 
(n=223, 33.2%) (risk ratio 0.77
, 95% confidence interval 
0.65 to 0.92; P=0.003) (fig 2). This means that 13 (95% 
confidence interval 5 to 22) patients would need to be 
given dexamethasone preoperatively to avoid one patient 
experiencing vomiting in the first 24 hours. Of the 
patients experiencing the primary outcome, 251 (63.5%) 
had vomiting episodes noted by both clinicians and 
patients, 119 (30.1%) by patients only, and 25 (6.3%) by 
clinicians only. The treatment effect was of similar mag-
nitude in episodes recorded by clinicians (0.77
, 0.62 to 
0.95; P=0.02) or by patients (0.75. 0.63 to 0.89; P=0.001).
Differences between episodes of vomiting were not 
significant in the period 25-72 hour after surgery 
(227 (33.7%) in the dexamethasone arm v 254 (37
.6%) in 
the control arm; risk ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 
0.78 to 1.03; P=0.14) and disappeared by 73-120 hours 
(152 (22.6%) v 150 (22.2%); 1.02, 0.83 to 1.24; P=0.87). 
Findings were similar when we excluded patients who 
had been discharged at the second and third time 
points and those with missing data. There was no evi-
dence that the reduction in vomiting within 24 hours

with dexamethasone differed in planned subgroup 
analyses according to type of surgery (P=0.91), whether 
the patient was assigned to an enhanced recovery path-
way (P=0.51), smoking (P=0.68), ASA grade (P=0.79), 
postoperative pain relief (P=0.39), or sex (P=0.78) (fig 3).
On demand postoperative antiemetics
Postoperative antiemetics were used less by participants 
allocated dexamethasone for up to three days after sur-
gery (fig 2 ). In the first 24 hours after surgery, they were 
given to 265 (39.3%) participants allocated dexametha-
sone and 351 (51.9%) participants allocated standard 
care (risk ratio 0.76, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.85; 
P<0.001), such that giving eight (5 to 11) patients dexa-
methasone intraoperatively avoided one additional 
patient requiring antiemetics (for symptoms) in the first 
24 hours. From 25 to 72 hours, antiemetics were given to 
353 (52.4%) in the dexamethasone group and 425 (62.9%) 
on standard care (0.83, 0.76 to 0.91; P<0.001), with a 
number needed to treat of 9 (5 to 14). The mean number 
of doses and the number of antiemetics given were also 
lower across both these time periods in the dexametha-
sone group (table 2). Rates of use were similar in both 
groups from 73 to 120 hours, antiemetics being given to 
276 (40.9%) participants allocated dexamethasone and 
285 (42.2%) allocated standard care (0.97
, 0.86 to 1.10; 
P=0.65). Findings were similar when we excluded

discharged at the second and 
third time points and those with missing data.
Patient reported outcomes for POnv
The PONV intensity scale classifies patients as experienc-
ing clinically important PONV based on their self rated 
frequency of vomiting and the intensity, pattern, and 
duration of nausea (patients who vomit three or more 
times, or patients who rate their nausea as intense, con-
stant, and long lasting on the scoring system). Differences 
were seen at 24 hours after surgery (table 3 ): 54 (8.6%) 
participants had clinically important PONV in the dexa-
methasone arm compared with 79 (12.7%) on standard 
care (risk ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 0.94; 
P=0.02). This means that 25 (95% confidence interval 14 to 
143) patients would need to be given dexamethasone pre-
operatively to avoid one patient experiencing self rated 
clinically important PONV in the first 24 hours. No differ-
ences were observed at 72 hours (1.06, 0.82 to 1.38; P=0.64) 
or 120 hours (1.00, 0.74 to 1.35; P=0.99). Differences were 
driven by differences in frequency of vomiting and nausea 
rather than difference in severity according to the VAS 
scoring (table 3 and fig A in appendix).
Patient recovery from surgery, quality of life, 
and fatigue
Nearly all patients had started fluids by 24 hours 
(1298/1350, 96.1%; table 3). Of those who had started 
fluids at 24 hours, significantly more of the patients in 
the dexamethasone arm had also started eating com-
pared with those who received standard care (419/673 
(62.3%) v 357/672 (53.1%); risk ratio 1.17 (95% confidence 
interval 1.07 to 1.29); P<0.001). By 72 hours the return to 
diet was similar in both groups.
There were no differences in the EQ-5D index score or 
visual analogue scale at 120 hours and 30 days (table 4) 
and no difference in fatigue as measured by the FACIT-F 
score. Length of stay was similar, with a median of six days 
in both arms (interquartile range 4-9 in the dexametha-
sone arm, 4-10 in the control arm), and a log rank analysis 
also showed no difference (hazard ratio 1.02, 95% confi-
dence interval 0.90 to 1.14; P=0.79) (fig B in appendix).
adverse events
Thirty participants died; 13 (1.9%) in the dexametha-
sone arm and 17 (2.5%) in the control arm (risk ratio 
0.77
, 95% confidence interval 0.38 to 1.57; P=0.47). Eight 
deaths in each group occurred within 30 days postoper-
atively. There were no significant differences in the tar-
geted adverse events between study arms: there were 
147 reported infection episodes among 136 patients 
within 30 days: 69 (10.2%) patients in the dexametha-
sone arm and 67 (9.9%) patients in the control arm (1.03, 
0.75 to 1.42; P=0.84). This included 84 patients with 
superficial wound infections (43 (6.4%) dexamethasone 
v 41 (6.1%) control; 1.05, 0.70 to 1.59; P=0.81), 19 patients 
with urinary tract infections (11 (1.6%) v 8 (1.2%); 1.38, 
0.56 to 3.41; P=0.48), and 22 patients with respiratory 
infections (7 (1.0%) v 15 (2.2%); 0.47, 0.19 to 1.14; 
P=0.09). There were 32 patients with anastomotic leaks 
within 30 days (11 (1.6%) dexamethasone v 21 (3.1%) 
control; 0.53, 0.26 to 1.08; P=0.08) and three patients 
with intra-abdominal abscesses (2 (0.3%) dexametha-
sone v 1 (0.1%) control; 2.01, 0.18 to 22.1; P=0.62). No 
patient in either arm developed new onset diabetes. No 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions were 
reported, and no serious adverse reactions were judged

Overview
In this multicentre pragmatic, blinded, randomised con-
trolled trial testing the use of intravenous dexametha-
sone for prophylaxis of PONV in patients undergoing 
small and large bowel surgery, we have shown, for the 
first time, that a single 8 mg dose of intravenous dexa-
methasone at induction significantly reduces the inci-
dence of PONV, reduces the need for rescue antiemetics, 
and increases the speed of return to diet after surgery. 
Furthermore, we showed dexamethasone to be safe in 
these patients, with no increase in adverse events. This 
strongly supports the use of dexamethasone as an induc-
tion antiemetic for patients undergoing bowel surgery.
Guidelines on the management of PONV in gastroin-
testinal surgery focus on a system for scoring severity to 
stratify patients for antiemetic use and have not been 
widely implemented into clinical practice.10 24 This 
could be because previous studies have restricted the 
mode of anaesthesia and opioid use. DREAMS is the 
first pragmatic trial of dexamethasone in bowel surgery, 
providing evidence for its use across various anaes-
thetic protocols and surgical procedures.
A systematic review of 22 large studies identifying pre-
dictors of PONV found that female sex, history of PONV, 
non-smokers, younger age, volatile anaesthetics, dura-
tion of anaesthesia, and postoperative opioid use were 
the strongest factors associated with PONV.4 These fac-
tors were equally balanced between both arms of this 
trial, and we saw no evidence of differences in the rela-
tive reduction of vomiting according to these predictors. 
While maintenance with propofol is known to reduce 
PONV, only 93 patients (7%) in the trial received it.
The mechanism of action of dexamethasone is likely 
to be multifactorial,25  encompassing central neurologi-
cal effects26  as well as anti-inflammatory benefits. A 
trial measuring cytokine levels in peritoneal drain fluid 
after colorectal surgery found significantly reduced lev-
els of IL-6, a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine

produced by T cells and macrophages in patients given 
dexamethasone.15  Our trial shows that the benefit from 
dexamethasone in terms of not requiring on demand 
antiemetics lasts beyond 48 hours, suggesting that the 
mechanism is unlikely to be simply anti-inflammatory. 
Murphy and colleagues found better global quality of 
recovery (QoR-40) scores in patients given dexametha-
sone compared with placebo (P<0.001) they when 
assessed recovery after discharge,27 supporting the late 
effect reported in our study.
strengths and limitations
We undertook this trial using an efficient and pragmatic 
approach to deliver a large study to quickly obtain 
 
clinically informative findings. The study was devel-
oped through the West Midlands Trainee Research Col-
laborative, providing effective teams of surgeons and 
anaesthetists in each recruiting centre. This structure 
combined with the avoidance of a placebo had a posi-
tive effect on recruitment to the study, which was com-
pleted six months ahead of schedule. These features 
could provide a template for future efficient trials.
There are, however, some limitations to this pragmatic 
trial. The efficient design precluded the use of a placebo, 
which would have totally ensured patient care was not 
altered by knowledge of the treatment allocation. Instead 
we designed the trial such that the individuals delivering 
postoperative patient care were blinded to the treatment 
allocation. The only individuals aware of the allocation 
were the anaesthetists, who were requested to abide by 
the study protocol. Anaesthetists administered antiemet-
ics over and above that required by the protocol in 189 
(14%) participants, however, most commonly in those 
allocated to standard care. This could reflect the fact that 
the patients recruited to this trial were undergoing major 
surgery undertaken by multidisciplinary teams of clini-
cians, when decisions to change practice during proce-
dures are common.  
Notably, any bias introduced by the 
increased use of antiemetics in the standard care arm 
would have tended to reduce the observed differences 
between the groups. While we cannot completely 
exclude the possibility that the lack of blinding of anaes-
thetics could influence postoperative prescribing, this is 
highly unlikely to have occurred as it the exception that 
patients in the study would have been managed postop-
eratively on hospital wards by the same anaesthetist.
Detailed analyses of patient reported outcomes 
beyond 24 hours are restricted to those who remained 
in hospital (fig 1) and so will tend to reflect those with 
slower operative recovery. There was no noted differ-
ence, however, in length of stay between the study 
arms, so this is unlikely to have affected the  
comparison

between study groups, and our sensitivity analyses, 
which investigated the impact of assuming no vomiting 
or antiemetic use after discharge, did not change our 
findings. We based our primary analysis on combined 
episodes of vomiting reported by patients or clinicians 
on the advice of the data monitoring committee to 
ensure we captured all relevant episodes. We under-
took sensitivity analyses restricted to either patient or 
clinician reports, and the magnitude and significance 
of the difference at 24 hours remained in all analyses 
(risk ratio 0.75 (95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.89; 
P=0.001) for patient reports; 0.77 (0.62 to 0.95; P=0.02) 
for clinician reports). At 72 hours the difference in vom-
iting was stronger and significant for clinician reported 
episodes (0.83 (0.70 to 0.98; P=0.03) than for patient 
reported episodes (0.93 (0.79 to 1.10; P=0.39).
The optimal dose of dexamethasone required to 
enhance postoperative recovery has not been estab-
lished. Smaller doses (2.5-5 mg) have been reported to 
be effective,28 
29  although a dose of 8 mg has previously 
been reported as optimal in the prevention of PONV.30-32 
In the absence of significant side effects, a recom-
mended dose of 8 mg would seem safe for these 
patients. More detailed dietary records could show the 
nutritional impacts of perioperative interventions and 
could add value to future studies investigating gastroin-
testinal function after surgery.
We have shown that dexamethasone is safe in patients 
without diabetes at high risk of septic complications 
such as anastomotic leak and wound infection, and this 
is consistent with findings from studies of less contami-
nated procedures.16 
26 
32 
33  In their systematic review Wal-
dron and colleagues found that patients receiving 
dexamethasone had small but significant increases in 
blood glucose 24 hours after operation.33  Studies have 
shown that a significantly higher blood glucose is seen 
in patients with impaired blood glucose preopera-
tively.34 
35  We excluded this high risk group from our trial 
in keeping with current consensus guidelines.10
At present, guidelines on the management and pre-
vention of PONV are perhaps overly complex10 
36 and so 
not widely adopted. Our trial of patients undergoing 
small and large bowel surgery provides a simple solu-
tion for a reduction in PONV. We have shown that addi-
tion of a single intravenous 8 mg dose of dexamethasone 
significantly reduces PONV at 24 hours, is safe to use, 
and should be incorporated into routine clinical prac-
tice for patients without diabetes undergoing elective 
small and large bowel surgery.
This trial was supported both in development and delivery by the 
Birmingham Surgical Trials Consortium and the Royal College of 
Surgeons and Rosetrees Clinical Research Initiative. Local support for 
the pilot phase was also provided by the Birmingham ECMC.
