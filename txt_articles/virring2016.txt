SUMMARY
Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous
psychiatric disorder with three different presentations and high levels of
psychiatric comorbidity. Serious sleep complaints are also common, but
the role of the presentations and comorbidity in sleep is under-
investigated in ADHD. Consequently, the goal of the study was to
investigate sleep problems in medicine-naive school-aged children
(mean age = 9.6 years) with ADHD compared to controls using objective
methods and to examine the role of comorbidity and presentations.
Ambulatory polysomnography results suggested that children with ADHD
(n = 76)
had
significantly
more
sleep
disturbances
than
controls
(n = 25), including a larger percentage of rapid eye movement (REM)
sleep and more sleep cycles, as well as lower mean sleep efficiency,
mean non-REM (NREM) sleep stage 1 and mean NREM sleep stage 3.
No significant between-group differences were found on the multiple
sleep latency test. Stratifying for comorbidity in the ADHD group did not
reveal major differences between groups, but mean sleep latency was
significantly longer in children with ADHD and no comorbidity compared
to controls (36.1 min; SD = 30.1 versus 22.6 min; SD = 15.2). No
differences were found between ADHD presentations. Our results
support the presence of night-time sleep disturbances in children with
ADHD. Poor sleep does not appear to be attributable to comorbidity
alone, nor do sleep disturbances differ within ADHD presentations.
INTRODUCTION
Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a 24-h
condition with symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity–
impulsivity during the day, troubles winding down in the
evening and problematic sleep during the night, resulting in
serious impairment for the child and the family (Calhoun
et al., 2011). The relationship between ADHD and sleep has
been the subject of many investigations, but to date no final
conclusion has been reached (Owens et al., 2013). The
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th
edition (DSM-5) identifies three different presentations of
ADHD
(inattentive,
hyperactive/impulsive
or
combined)
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013), and psychiatric
comorbidity is present in up to two-thirds of children (Larson,
2011; Spencer, 2006; Yoshimasu et al., 2012) Consequently,
ADHD is a heterogeneous disorder, and the presentations
and comorbidities are important features to take into account
both clinically and in research when examining children with
the disorder.
The majority of studies on sleep in ADHD have used
parent reports to measure sleep problems in their offspring
(Yoon et al., 2012). Questionnaire studies find quite con-
sistently that up to 70% of all children with ADHD have
sleep problems (Sung et al., 2008). Few studies using
questionnaire data have investigated the influence of ADHD
presentation or psychiatric comorbidity on sleep in ADHD.
The few studies that exist conclude that the presence of

Sleep disturbances in ADHD
 comorbid psychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum
disorders or internalizing disorders seem to influence sleep,
whereas the different ADHD presentations do not appear to
differ with respect to sleep disturbance (Chiang et al., 2010;
Hansen et al., 2014; LeBourgeois et al., 2004; Mayes et al.,
2009; Virring et al., 2014; Wagner et al., 2004; Willoughby
et al., 2008).
Objective
sleep
measures,
such
as
actigraphy,
polysomnography (PSG) and multiple sleep latency test.
(MSLT) (Cortese et al., 2009, Prihodova et al. 2010 and
Wiebe et al. 2013), have also been applied to examine sleep
in ADHD, albeit with less conclusive findings than in
questionnaire studies. Furthermore, objective studies of
sleep disorders relative to ADHD presentations are scarce
(Lecendreux et al., 2000; Ramos Platon et al., 1990; Silvestri
et al., 2009; Speth et al., 2014) and objective studies de-
voted to ADHD comorbidities and sleep are, to our knowl-
edge, extremely scarce (Stephens et al., 2013).
Because psychiatric comorbidity is highly prevalent in
ADHD, and the few subjective investigations made imply
that psychiatric comorbidity in ADHD has an impact on
sleep, objective sleep investigations are needed to clarify
the
role
of
comorbidity
in
ADHD
sleep
disturbances.
Furthermore, the ADHD presentations are used widely
clinically and scientifically when characterizing the individual
affected. Examining comorbidity and ADHD presentations
will, hopefully, help to clarify these aspects and whether
they should be addressed when treating sleep disturbances
in ADHD.
In the present study, we hypothesized that children with
ADHD would differ from typically developing children with
respect to sleep measured objectively through PSG and
MSLT. We also expected that children with ADHD and
psychiatric comorbidity would have poorer sleep architecture
than children with ADHD and no psychiatric comorbidity.
Finally, we did not expect to find differences between ADHD
presentations, as many symptoms overlap in the diagnostic
criteria of the three presentations.
METHODS
Participants
For 2 years, all children referred consecutively to a public
child and adolescent psychiatric hospital in Denmark were
invited to participate in the study. Inclusion criteria were age
6–13 years, a diagnosis of ADHD, an IQ above 70 as
measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children,
3rd edition (Wechsler, 1991) and no history of treatment with
psychotrophic medication or melatonin. The control group
was a convenience sample consisting of typically developing
children recruited through colleagues and social networks.
Control children were matched with the included children with
ADHD based on age and gender. Exclusion criteria in the
control group were an ADHD diagnosis based on parent
information or previous treatment with any type of psy-
chotrophic medication.
Procedure
The enrolment procedure entailed several steps. First,
families of clinic-referred children received a letter containing
written information about the study, as well as a response
letter in which parents could indicate whether they wanted
verbal information. Secondly, parents who returned the
response letter received detailed verbal information. Thirdly,
parents who agreed to participate together with their children
gave verbal as well as written consent.
All
questionnaires
were
administered
before
parents
received a diagnosis, essentially making parents ‘blind’ to
their child’s clinical diagnosis.
Assessment
ADHD diagnoses were based on the Development and Well-
Being Assessment (DAWBA). The DAWBA is a standardized
assessment for DSM-IV psychiatric diagnoses and integrates
information from parents (structured interview) and teachers
(questionnaire). The parent interview was administered by
telephone, whereas the teacher questionnaire was adminis-
tered via mail to the child’s primary teacher. A child and
adolescent psychiatrist assessed the DAWBA, and any
uncertainty about diagnoses was discussed with a second
child
and
adolescent
psychiatrist
until
consensus
was
achieved. Parents of the control group completed the
Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman, 2001;
Goodman et al., 2000), which is a brief behavioural screen-
ing questionnaire that covers emotional symptoms, conduct
problems, hyperactivity/inattention symptoms, peer relation-
ship problems and prosocial behaviour.
All children included in the study underwent the same
sleep assessment procedure. Prior to the investigation,
parents completed a 1-week sleep diary and the Children’s
Sleep
Habits
questionnaire
(CSHQ)
for
sleep-problem
assessment. On the CSHQ, parents rate the occurrence of
33 sleep habits or sleep problems in the most recent typical
week. The questionnaire provides a total score (33–99
points) and eight subscale scores for children aged 4–
12 years
(Owens
et al.,
2000).
A
1-night
ambulatory
polysomnography was performed with TrackIT
TM in accor-
dance with a standard American Academy of Sleep Medicine
manual (Grigg-Damberger et al., 2007; Iber et al., 2007),
using the following electroencephalographic montage: F4–
M1, C4–M1, O2–M1; F3–M2, C3–M2, O1–M2; and bilateral
electro-oculography (EOG) placed 1 cm superior to the right
outer canthus and 1 cm inferior to the left outer canthus.
Submental and electroencephalography (ECG) electrodes,
thoracic and abdominal belts and electrodes on both legs
were all placed according to the manual. Parent and child
were instructed to place the oximeter on the index finger and

 fit the nasal airflow and snoring cannula with plasters before
going to sleep. The montage was performed in the afternoon
at the clinic, and the recording started immediately. The child
carried the TrackIT
TM in a small backpack. The parents were
instructed to keep the child’s habitual bedtime and to register
lights off and on, awakenings during the night and in the
morning and whether the child seemed rested.
The following day, participants came to the sleep labora-
tory at 07:45 hours, and a multiple sleep latency test was
performed (Littner et al., 2005). The naps took place at 08:00,
10:00, 12:00 and 14:00 hours. If REM occurred in one of the
four-first naps, a fifth nap was included. After calibration, a
20-min recording started. If the child fell asleep during the
examination, he or she was given a 15-min nap. The parents
waited outside while the children napped. If a child was
anxious, a parent was allowed to stay in the room with the
child during the nap.
Sleep was scored according to the American Academy of
Sleep Medicine criteria for children (Grigg-Damberger et al.,
2007; Iber et al., 2007). All recordings were performed at the
same location, and the same experienced sleep technologist
scored the PSG and the MSLT manually.
Data handling
Based on the results from the DAWBA, children with ADHD
were grouped according to thepresence of ADHD presentation
and comorbidity. According to DSM-5 (American Psychiatric
Association, 2013) the three ADHD presentations are mutually
exclusive, whereas a child can have a number of comorbid
psychiatric disorders. In the present study, 14% of the children
fulfilled the criteria for more than one comorbid condition in
addition to their ADHD diagnosis. In these cases the comorbid
psychiatric diagnoses were grouped into four categories
(according to the DSM-5), and each category ranked according
to severity and overall impact on daily life. The categories
(ranked from first to last) were as follows: autism spectrum
disorder, internalizing disorders (depression, anxiety, obses-
sive compulsive disorder), externalizing disorders (conduct
disorder, oppositional defiant disorder) and tic disorders (tics,
Tourette syndrome). A child with comorbidity was included in
the most severe comorbid category (i.e. if the child had autism
and tics, the child would be included in the autism category).
Five groups emerged: ADHD with no comorbidity (n = 34),
ADHD with autism (n = 6), ADHD with internalizing comorbid-
ity (n = 9), ADHD with externalizing comorbidity (n = 20) and
ADHD with tic disorder (n = 7).
Analyses were conducted using the statistical software
program
STATA version 13 (StataCorp, 2013). Data were
plotted for normal distribution, and regression analysis was
carried out. Raw scores are presented in the Table 1 and
Supplementary information. Analyses were carried out with
an adjustment for age and gender, and an alpha level was set
at 0.05 in all statistical analyses. Given the exploratory nature
of the study, no adjustment for multiple testing was made.
The Danish Regional Ethics Committee (reference num-
ber: 2010-41-5472) and the Danish Data Protection Agency
approved the study.

 children with ADHD after the verbal information was deliv-
ered. Seven PSG/MSLT assessments were incomplete (two
due to technical failures and five due to the child’s refusal to
cooperate during the investigation). In total, 76 complete
investigations were made in the ADHD group (Fig. 1).
ADHD versus control group
Mean age in the children with ADHD (9.6 � 1.8) did not differ
from controls (9.4 � 1.5). In eligible but not included patients
the mean age and gender distribution did not differ from the
included patients. There was a predominance of boys in the
included
patient
group
as
well
as
the
control
group
(ADHD = 74% boys; control = 68%). Mean body mass index
(BMI) was higher among patients than controls (17.9 � 2.7
versus 16.3 � 2.1 kg/m², P < 0.05).
The children in the present sample with ADHD differed
significantly from the control group on subjective sleep
measures from the CSHQ both on the total sleep disturbance
score and on the subscale scores, except for sleep-
disordered breathing. No difference was found between the
three presentations and the number of children in the
comorbid subgroups was too low to make firm conclusions
(data in Supplementary information).
The measures from the 1-week sleep dairy completed by
the parents showed that children with ADHD had significantly
longer registered sleep latencies during the week; the
latencies were 31 � 2 min in the ADHD group compared to
22 � 2 min in the control group (P < 0.05). The two groups
did not differ with respect to registered awakenings during the
night (0.4 � 2 versus 0.1 � 2).
Several statistically significant differences between chil-
dren with ADHD and controls were observed on the PSG: the
children with ADHD had a higher number of sleep cycles and
more REM sleep but less total sleep time, NREM 1 sleep and
NREM 3 sleep compared to the control group. On the
remaining
PSG
measures,
no
differences
were
found
between patients and controls. Despite shorter latencies on
all naps on the MSLT, the differences between patients and
controls were not statistically significant (data in Supplemen-
tary information) (Table 1).
Comorbid subgroups
In the present sample, 55% of children with ADHD had
psychiatric comorbidity. When the ADHD group was strat-
ified according to comorbidity, very few statistical differ-
ences emerged when comparing the various comorbid
groups to the group of children with no comorbidity. Children
with ADHD and tic disorders were more awake and had
lower sleep efficiency than children with ADHD and no
comorbidity. Furthermore, the group with ADHD and exter-
nalizing disorders were more awake and had a higher
percentage of NREM 3 sleep, although it was still lower
than in the control group. Children with ADHD and an
internalizing disorder were also more awake than the
children with ADHD alone. Sleep latency on the PSG
indicated large variability among groups (data in Supple-
mentary information).
In the group of children with ADHD without comorbidity the
sleep latency was significantly longer compared to the control
group. No statistically significant between-group differences
emerged on any of the MSLT variables, including sleep
latency and number of REM periods.
The group sizes should to be taken into account when
interpreting the results.
ADHD presentations
In the ADHD group, the inattentive presentation had a
significantly lower percentage of NREM 3 sleep compared to
the combined presentation. This result was no longer
statistically significant when presentations without comorbid-
ity were examined. Despite earlier sleep onset time in the
inattentive and the hyperactive/impulsive presentations with-
out comorbidity, presentations were not significantly different
on the remaining sleep measures.
On the MSLT, no significant differences were found in
either mean sleep latency or number of REM periods

the results (data in Supplementary information).
DISCUSSION
The associations between sleep disturbances, psychiatric
comorbidity and presentations were investigated in 76
medicine-naive children referred to a child psychiatric hospi-
tal for ADHD problems. Sleep disturbances were measured
using questionnaires as well as PSG and MSLT. To our
knowledge,
this
is
the
largest
controlled
investigation
addressing both PSG and the MSLT in children with ADHD
with and without psychiatric comorbidity. A number of
findings emerged. First, results from questionnaire-based
measures and a 1-week parent diary suggested that sleep
problems are highly prevalent among children with ADHD
and that it takes longer for children with ADHD than control
children to fall asleep, which parallels what is reported
generally in questionnaire studies of sleep in ADHD (Cortese
et al., 2009; Virring et al., 2014; Yoon et al., 2012). When
sleep was measured through objective sleep measures, a
higher numbers of sleep cycles, less total sleep time, less
NREM 1 and NREM 3 sleep and more REM sleep were found
in ADHD compared to controls. This supports results from the
sleep diary and questionnaire studies and some studies that
report changes in sleep stages in ADHD similar to those
found in our study (Cortese et al., 2009; Hvolby, 2015; Yoon
et al., 2012) Secondly, the sleep latency in children with
ADHD measured through PSG was not significantly longer
than in typically developing children, but when children with
comorbidity were excluded from the analyses a significant
difference emerged between children with ADHD and con-
trols. The sleep latency on the PSG is supported by the
results from the sleep dairies completed daily by the parents
1 week prior to the study. The longer latencies in both the
PSG and sleep dairies support the questionnaire-reported
sleep onset problems in ADHD (Hvolby et al., 2008; Van Der
Heijden et al., 2006; Virring et al., 2014; Yoon et al., 2012).
This result could indicate a lower homeostatic pressure in the
group of children with only ADHD. However, scrutiny of the
data suggests that children with ADHD and internalizing
disorders are the only ones with short latencies, and that the
other comorbid groups have long latencies, indicating that
problems initiating sleep are present both with and without
comorbidity.
In this study, results from most of the PSG measures in the
children with comorbidity in addition to an ADHD diagnosis
were not significantly different from those found in the
children with ADHD and no comorbidity. This finding is
different from what we found in our questionnaire-based
study (Virring et al., 2014). The difference may be attributable
to smaller sample sizes in the present study compared to the
previous study, and the findings should be interpreted with
caution. An important result was that the group of children
with ADHD and no comorbidity still differed significantly from
control children with regard to the same sleep measures on
PSG.
Contrary to our hypothesis, no statistically significant
differences were found on the MSLT measures between
children with ADHD and controls, and stratifying into comor-
bid groups or ADHD presentations did not change this result.
However, all latencies and the mean latency in the group of
children with ADHD were shorter than in the control group,
which corresponds well with previous findings (Golan et al.,
2004; Lecendreux et al., 2000; Palm et al., 1992), suggesting
that children with ADHD are sleepier during the day despite a
symptomatology characterized by a higher level of hyperac-
tivity, impulsivity and inattention.
No differences on PSG and MSLT were found between the
ADHD presentations. We speculate whether or not the fact
that ADHD presentations have symptom overlap could
explain this (i.e. it is possible to have up to five hyperac-
tive–impulsive symptoms and still be characterized as having
a predominantly inattentive presentation, and children with
the inattentive and the combined presentations both have
six+ inattentive symptoms), and presentations appear to be
unstable over time (Willcutt, 2012). We interpret this as
support of the fact that sleep disturbances could be part of
the ADHD pathology. Whether sleep disturbances constitute
a distinct comorbid disorder or are part of the ADHD
pathology with a dysregulated sleep wake regulation, possi-
bly resulting in compensative hyperactive behaviour, remains
unclear. Another possibility is that ADHD presents a hyper-
arousal state—such as insomnia—with sleep problems,
despite relative normal objective macro sleep stages (Rie-
mann et al., 2010). Also, it is possible that the high rate of
parent-reported sleep problems in children with ADHD with
additional psychiatric comorbidity reflects the overall burden
of problems with which the families are struggling, so that the
perception of problems (including sleep problems) is higher
for these families compared to families where there is no
additional comorbidity.
Given the small number of children included within the
various comorbid groups in this study, our results should be
interpreted with caution. Large-scale studies combining
different measures need to be applied in order to examine
disturbed physiological mechanisms behind sleep problems
reported in ADHD.
We found no significant increase in the occurrence of sleep
apnea or periodic leg movements among ADHD patients.
Previous studies have suggested that sleep deprivation due
to a primary sleep disorder such as sleep apnea or
narcolepsy subtypes may be over-represented in children
with ADHD (Cortese et al., 2008; Walters et al., 2008).
Although ADHD-like symptoms may be observed in children
with a primary sleep disorder, the current study does not
support that sleep apnea or narcolepsy plays a major role in
ADHD.
Many factors, both physiologically and psychologically,
play a crucial role with regard to sleep and ADHD. The multi-

337
 factorial aspects make both areas interesting, but also
challenging to investigate. As sleep problems are highly
prevalent in, but not restricted to, ADHD and as the process
of sleep and sleep regulation probably involves a large part
of, if not the whole, brain it seems that the more psychiatric
difficulties a child has the more likely it is that sleep problems
will be reported. We speculate whether the degree of
impairment in a child with ADHD and co-occurring diagnoses
should be characterized as a continuum: the more impaired
the child, the more abnormally developed the brain may be,
which may result in more disabilities per se, including sleep.
With regard to ADHD and the relation to sleep, the theory of a
dysregulation of sleep–wake mechanisms is intriguing, and
we recommend that more sophisticated measures of sleep
and neurotransmitters combined with electrophysiological
measures, imaging and molecular biological methods are
applied to detect this possible dysregulation during daytime.
Strengths and limitations
We investigated the largest group of medicine-naive children
with ADHD who were referred to a single study centre, using
both PSG and MSLT. The psychiatric diagnoses were made
using a standardized rigorous diagnostic interview. The large
number of children allowed us to stratify into subgroups (ADHD
presentations and comorbidity). The use of manually scored
ambulatory recordings in the child’s home reflects naturalistic
sleep as closely as possible, and could reflect habitual sleep in
a well-known and safe environment, such as sleep measured
by actigraphy. The control group was screened for ADHD and
psychiatric comorbidity through validated questionnaires and
sleep-assessed using the same procedures as the children
with ADHD. The fact that we investigated all children prior to
any form of treatment might have resulted in the inclusion of
children with inappropriate, albeit potentially correctable (e.g.
through sleep hygiene), sleep patterns. However, we wished
to depict sleep in the children before any intervention had taken
place. As seen on the PSG (Table 1), sleep onset is earlier in
children with ADHD than controls, which contradicts the above
potential limitation of inappropriate sleep habits or later
bedtimes. The children with ADHD appear to have shorter
total sleep time than controls. We do not know whether pets,
siblings, co-sleeping or other issues could have interrupted the
sleep during the night, as this cannot be monitored during
ambulatory PSG. Another possible limitation when applying
ambulatory PSG recordings is the possible presence of
parasomnias, the presence of which could not be examined
as video was not applied. Relatively small subgroups were
examined in order to examine diagnostic comorbidity cate-
gories and ADHD presentations, some possibly too small to
make definitive conclusions but, as mentioned earlier, the
study should be considered as exploratory. Another potential
limitation is our ranking of psychiatric comorbidity when more
than one comorbid diagnosis was present. However, this
reflects the hierarchical system from the International Classi-
fication of Diseases (ICD-10), with autism as the most heavy
comorbid disorder (World Health Organization, 1992). Any
choice of ranking can be considered a potential limitation. In
our case however, only 11 patients had more than one
comorbid disorder.
CONCLUSION
Our results, which correspond well with previous questionnaire
and actigraphy studies, indicate that the overall sleep archi-
tecture is poorer in children with ADHD compared to controls.
Furthermore, we conclude that poorer sleep architecture is
present in children with ADHD both with and without psychiatric
comorbidity. Very little difference was present between the
comorbid groups and various ADHD presentations.
Despite our results, it remains unclear whether sleep
disturbances in ADHD should be seen as an aetiological
factor, a comorbid disorder or the result of an overlapping
neurodevelopmental disorder of the brain. As sleep is an
utmost
necessity
for
optimal
daily
functioning,
further
research in this field is mandatory to enhance developmental
potentials for the children and their families.
