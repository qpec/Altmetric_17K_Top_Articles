SUMMARY
Genetic conflict between viruses and their hosts
drives evolution and genetic innovation. Prokaryotes
evolved CRISPR-mediated adaptive immune sys-
tems for protection from viral infection, and viruses
have evolved diverse anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins
that subvert these immune systems. The adaptive
immune system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (type
I-F) relies on a 350 kDa CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided
surveillance complex (Csy complex) to bind foreign
DNA and recruit a trans-acting nuclease for target
degradation. Here, we report the cryo-electron mi-
croscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the Csy complex
bound to two different Acr proteins, AcrF1 and
AcrF2, at an average resolution of 3.4 A
˚ . The struc-
ture explains the molecular mechanism for immune
system suppression, and structure-guided muta-
tions show that the Acr proteins bind to residues
essential for crRNA-mediated detection of DNA.
Collectively, these data provide a snapshot of an
ongoing molecular arms race between viral suppres-
sors and the immune system they target.
INTRODUCTION
Viruses that infect bacteria (i.e., phages) are the most diverse
and abundant biological agents on the planet, and bacteria
have evolved sophisticated adaptive immune systems to protect
themselves from phage predation (Rodriguez-Valera et al., 2009;
Suttle, 2007; van der Oost et al., 2014). These immune systems
rely on CRISPR loci and a diverse cassette of CRISPR-associ-
ated (Cas) genes (Makarova et al., 2011; 2015). Immunity to
phages is acquired and passed on to progeny by integrating
short fragments of foreign DNA into the host CRISPR locus.
These loci are transcribed and processed into short CRISPR-
derived RNAs (crRNAs) that are incorporated into multi-subunit
crRNA-guided surveillance complexes that recognize, bind,
and degrade foreign nucleic acids.
According to the most recent phylogenetic classification,
CRISPR systems are divided into two classes, six types, and
19 subtypes (Makarova et al., 2015; Shmakov et al., 2015).
Collectively, these immune systems represent a diverse arsenal
of sequence-specific defense mechanisms that efficiently block
invasion by mobile genetic elements, including phages and plas-
mids. However, phages and plasmids have evolved a diverse
repertoire of anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins that subvert these im-
mune systems (Bondy-Denomy et al., 2013; 2015; Pawluk
et al., 2014; 2016). In general, Acr proteins are difficult to identify
using sequence-based bioinformatic techniques due to their low
sequence similarity. However, Pawluk et al. (2016) recently iden-
tified a conserved transcriptional regulator that serves as a ge-
netic landmark for identifying putative Acr proteins, and phyloge-
netic analyses indicate that the distribution of these proteins
mirrors the distribution of the CRISPR-Cas systems that they
inactivate.
To elucidate the mechanistic differences that give rise to
phylogenetic distinctions between each of the 19 different
CRISPR-mediated immune systems, and to understand the mo-
lecular interactions that enable different Acr proteins to specif-
ically subvert the type I-F immune system in P. aeruginosa, we
determined the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure
of the a 350 kDa crRNA-guided surveillance complex (i.e., Csy
complex) in association with two distinct anti-CRISPRs (Figures
1, S1, S2, Table S1, and Movie S1). The structure was
determined at an average resolution of 3.4 A
˚ , with the most

novo atomic modeling and providing a detailed structural under-
standing of the Acr-Csy interactions (Figures S1 and S2).
RESULTS
Structural Overview of the Csy Complex
The Csy complex is a crRNA-guided surveillance complex
composed of nine Cas proteins (one Cas6f, six Cas7fs, one
Cas5f, and one Cas8f protein) and a single 60-nt crRNA (Fig-
ure 1) (van Duijn et al., 2012; Wiedenheft et al., 2011). Overall,
the morphology of the complex is consistent with the seahorse
shape that has been described for other class 1 CRISPR-Cas
complexes, with subunits referred to as the head (Cas6), back-
bone (Cas7), and tail (Cas5 and Cas8) (Figures 1 and 2) (Jackson
and Wiedenheft, 2015; Zhang and Sontheimer, 2014). The
crRNA is an integral component of the complex, making direct
contact with all nine protein subunits (Figure 1). The crRNA per-
forms an important structural role in complex assembly by teth-
ering the protein subunits of the complex together and defining
the number of Cas7 subunits incorporated into the backbone
(Kuznedelov et al., 2016; Luo et al., 2016; Wiedenheft et al.,
2011). The complex is assembled such that a portion of the
crRNA (sometimes called the spacer) guides the complex to
complementary nucleic acids found in phage and plasmid ge-
nomes, and target binding recruits the Cas2/3 nuclease-heli-
case protein for degradation of the target. Phage-encoded
anti-CRISPR proteins AcrF1 and AcrF2 (Figures 1B–1D, red
and green, respectively) block crRNA-guided target recognition
by binding to either the Cas7f backbone (AcrF1), which blocks

 hybridization to a complementary target, or by inserting be-
tween the Cas8f and Cas7f subunits in the tail (AcrF2), which
prevents interactions with the target DNA duplex (Figure 1).
The Acr stoichiometries observed are consistent with our previ-
ous work showing AcrF1 bound predominantly to multimeric
Cas7f in a ratio of 2.6 ± 0.3 proteins per Csy complex, while
AcrF2 bound to Cas8f with a ratio of 0.8 ± 0.1 (Bondy-Denomy
et al., 2015).
The CRISPR loci in P. aeruginosa are composed of 28-nucle-
otide repeat sequences separated by 32-nucleotide phage- or
plasmid-derived spacer sequences. The repeat sequences are
partially palindromic, giving rise to a series of stable stem-loop
structures within the long precursor CRISPR transcripts. These
stem-loop structures are recognized by a CRISPR-specific
endoribonuclease, Cas6f (formerly Csy4), which cleaves the
CRISPR RNA at the 30 end of each stem-loop to produce a library
of 60-nt crRNAs required for assembly of the Csy surveillance
complex (Wiedenheft et al., 2011; Haurwitz et al., 2010). Cas6f
and the 30 hairpin of the crRNA are not well resolved in cryo-
EM density, suggesting that the linkage tethering Cas6f to the
rest of the complex is flexible (Figure S1J). However, a high-res-
olution crystal structure of the P. aeruginosa Cas6f protein bound
to the 30 hairpin of the crRNA was previously determined (Haur-
witz et al., 2010), and the EM density in this region was suffi-
ciently resolved to enable unambiguous rigid body fitting of the
atomic model into position at the head of the complex (Figure 1).
In addition, two copies of an NMR structure for AcrF1 were used
to facilitate model building (Maxwell et al., 2016). Models for
AcrF2 and all other Cas proteins were built de novo using the
EM density. The tail of the complex, consisting primarily of
Cas5f (formerly Csy2) and Cas8f (formerly Csy1) were not as
well resolved as the Cas7f backbone, so a focused classification
and refinement strategy using signal subtraction was employed
to improve the density in this region for de novo atomic model
building (see STAR Methods) (Figure S3).
Ordered Presentation of the crRNA Guide
Phylogenetic and structural studies suggest that multi-subunit
crRNA-guided surveillance complexes found in type I and type
III immune systems evolved from a common ancestor (Jackson
and Wiedenheft, 2015; Makarova et al., 2015; Rouillon et al.,
2013; Spilman et al., 2013). A unifying feature of these systems,
which are now collectively recognized as class 1 immune sys-
tems, is the helical assembly of a Cas7 family protein along
the crRNA (Figure 2A). Consistent with previously determined
Cas7 structures, the Cas7f protein from P. aeruginosa shares a
‘‘right-hand’’ morphology composed of fingers-, palm-, web-,
and thumb-shaped domains (Figure 2B). In P. aeruginosa, crRNA
binding by Cas7f is mediated by non-sequence specific contacts
between the sugar-phosphate backbone and residues on the
palm (R35, H275, Q277, K278, N281, R284) and web (R169,
Q248). The thumb of Cas7.1f is anticipated to be part of the flex-
ible tether that connects the Cas7f backbone to the Cas6 head,
but due to the flexibility of the head, the density for the thumb is
not well resolved. In contrast, thumbs of the remaining Cas7f
subunits (Cas7.2f-7.6f) are well ordered and fold over the top
of the crRNA and across the palm of the adjacent subunit (Fig-
ures 2A and 2B). Similar to what has been reported for the other
class 1 complexes, Cas7f oligomerization along the crRNA intro-
duces distortions in the sugar-phosphate backbone, resulting in
‘‘kinks’’ at regular 6-nucleotide intervals (Taylor et al., 2015;
Hayes et al., 2016; Hochstrasser et al., 2014; Jackson et al.,
2014a; van Erp et al., 2015). The thumb of each Cas7f subunit
folds over the top of each kink, burying one nucleobase at
positions �1, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 of the crRNA (Figures 2A–
2C). The five nucleotides between each kink are ordered in a
pseudo-A-form configuration, and the sugar-phosphate back-
bone of each helical segment superimposes on the backbone
of each of the other segments (e.g., nucleotides 1–5 superim-
pose on nucleotides 7–11, etc.) with an RMSD of less than
0.37 A
˚ for equivalently positioned phosphates.
Presentation of the crRNA guide in helical segments of 5 nucle-
otides is a conserved feature of class 1 surveillance complexes. In
fact, the sugar-phosphate backbones for helical segments of the
crRNA from Csy (type I-F), Cascade (type I-E), and Cmr (type III-B)
superimpose with an RMSD of < 1.0A
˚ (Figure 2C). While the struc-
ture of each helical segment is conserved among class 1 surveil-
lance complexes, torsion angles at each kink differ significantly
between these systems. Torsion angles are determined by spe-
cific interactions between the crRNA phosphate backbone and
the palm, web, and thumb domains of the subtype-specific
Cas7 proteins. The resulting differences in the torsion angles at
each kink correspond with large-scale structural differences in
the helical pitch of the Cas7 backbone (Figure 2D). The backbone
of the I-F Csy complex adopts a substantially tighter pitch (80 A
˚ )
compared to the I-E (127 A
˚ ) or III-B complexes (158 A
˚ ). The tighter
spiral of the Csy backbone results in the head and tail subunits be-
ing positioned in close proximity, creating a nearly closed ring-like
structure. The functional significance of these structural differ-
ences is currently not well understood, but we do know that
most anti-CRISPRs are subtype specific (Pawluk et al., 2014;
2016), and these preferences likely reflect structural features
that are unique to each of the different subtypes.
While the ‘‘right-hand’’ morphology used to describe Cas7
family proteins is conserved in Cas7f, the Cas7f fold is distinct
(Figure S4). Previously determined Cas7 structures contain
palm domains with the babbab topology of an RNA recognition
motif (RRM), where the two antiparallel a helices pack against
one face of a four-stranded antiparallel b sheet that has a specific
b2b3b1b4
arrangement
(Topuzlu
and
Lawrence,
2016).
In
contrast, the Cas7f palm domain is an antiparallel b sheet with
a notably different b3b2b4b1 arrangement, and a structural ho-
mology search performed using the Cas7f palm domain reveals
similarity to the PAD domain of eukaryotic polymerases, rather
than other Cas7 family proteins (Holm and Sander, 1993; Trincao
et al., 2001). Furthermore, previously determined Cas7 struc-
tures contain highly decorated RRMs with multiple insertions
that form the fingers and thumb domains, while the Cas7f palm
contains only one insertion, with the thumb and fingers domains
formed by N- and C-terminal extensions, respectively (Fig-
ure S4). In addition to the previously described domains, Cas7f
contains a 38-residue loop in the C-terminal extension, termed
the ‘‘extended web,’’ which packs against the thumb, creating
a prominent trough connecting the web and thumb domains.
Structurally equivalent loops exist in other type I Cas7 proteins,
although they are significantly smaller.

 Organization of the Tail
The tail of the Csy complex is composed of a stable Cas5f-Cas8f
heterodimer that recognizes a conserved S-shaped RNA struc-
ture, called the 50 handle, which is formed by the final 8 nucleo-
tides on the 50 end of the crRNA (Figures 1 and 3). The Cas5f
protein adopts a ‘‘left-handed fist’’ morphology consisting of a
canonical RRM (i.e., b2a2b3b1a1b4) that forms the palm domain
flanked by a four-stranded antiparallel beta sheet (b2b1b4b3)

that resembles fingers and a loop that
forms a thumb-like feature (Figure 3B).
Each of these anatomical features plays
a role in binding Cas8f, the 50 handle of
the crRNA, or both (Figures 3A–3D).
The Cas5f fingers ‘‘grip’’ a long b
hairpin on Cas8f (residues 175-191) that
extends through the Cas5f subunit. We
refer to this b hairpin as the Cas8f
harpoon (Figure 3B). The last two nucleo-
tides of the crRNA 50 handle (positions
�8C and �7U) are sandwiched between
the Cas8f harpoon and the first a helix
of the Cas5f RRM, while the next nucleo-
tide at position �6A is displaced and the
phosphate backbone is kinked by inter-
actions with lysine 176 (K176) on Cas8f
and asparagine 21 (N21) on Cas5f (Fig-
ures 3C–3E). This network of interactions
creates the first curve of the S-shaped 50
handle, which transitions into the next
curve consisting of four bases (positions
�5A, �4G, �3A, and �2A) that are ar-
ranged in a pseudo-A-form configuration
(Figures 2C and 2D). The phosphate
backbone of these four nucleotides is
stabilized by non-sequence-specific in-
teractions with Cas7.6f, while bases on
either end of the helical stack are stabi-
lized by interactions with Cas5f (i.e.,
R271 and N86).
The thumb of Cas5f is formed by a large insertion between
b2 and b3 of the RRM (residues 48–109). This thumb functions
similarly to the Cas7f thumbs by folding over the crRNA at
position �1A (Figure 3C). In the type I-E surveillance complex, in-
teractions between the Cas5 thumb and the fingers domain of
Cas7.6 coincide with a �180� rotation of the Cas7 fingers. This
rotation creates a ‘‘lysine-rich vise’’ between Cas7.5 and 7.6
that is critical for binding dsDNA (Jackson et al., 2014a; van
Cell 169, 47–57, March 23, 2017
51
 Erp et al., 2015). Notably, no comparable rotation is observed
in the sixth Cas7f subunit of the Csy complex (Cas7.6f), suggest-
ing that this complex uses an alternative mechanism for bind-
ing dsDNA.
With the exception of a recently described type I-F variant
(type I-Fv) (Gleditzsch et al., 2016), crRNA-guided surveillance
complexes contain a large tail protein called Cas8, but their
amino acid sequences are diverse, and Cas8f of P. aeruginosa
has a distinct fold. Unlike the Cas8 tail in Cascade, which
comprises a large globular domain and a C-terminal four-helix
bundle, Cas8f has an extended architecture with three discrete
domains—an N-terminal ‘‘hook’’ shaped domain (residues
1–166), a central domain (residues 167–264), and a C-terminal
helical bundle that occupies the belly of the Csy complex (resi-
dues 265–435) (Figure 3B). Although helical bundles have been
observed at the C-termini of Cas8 family members, the central
location of this helical bundle in P. aeruginosa is unique, contact-
ing Cas6, Cas7.2f, and Cas7.3f at the head and upper spiral of
the complex, as well as Cas5 at the tail. By contrast, the corre-
sponding helical bundle within the I-E system only contacts
Cas5, the crRNA, and the tail-proximal Cse2 ‘‘belly’’ protein.
The density for this region of the reconstruction was not as
well ordered as the rest of the structure, indicating structural
flexibility.

 AcrF1 Proteins Prevent DNA Hybridization
AcrF1 binds to the Cas7f backbone and prevents target binding,
but the mechanism and location of these interactions has not yet
been determined (Bondy-Denomy et al., 2015). The structure
presented here explains how two AcrF1 proteins (i.e., AcrF1.1
and 1.2) bind to one Csy complex through interactions with
four of the six Cas7f subunits (Figures 1 and 4). AcrF1 is a small
protein (78 residues) composed of a four-stranded antiparallel b
sheet flanked on one side by two a helices (b1b2b3b4a1a2) (Fig-
ures 1D and 4). The AcrF1 structure was previously determined
by NMR, and mutational studies identified three residues
(Y6, Y20, and E31) on one face of the b sheet that are critical
for AcrF1-mediated repression of type I-F immune response
(Maxwell et al., 2016). Here, we show that these three residues
interact with a single, conserved lysine (K85) on the Cas7f thumb
and that a lysine-to-alanine mutation at this position (K85A) re-
sults in a faster dissociation rate from the complex (kd1 = 3.1 3
10�4 s�1) as compared to the dissociation rate of AcrF1 from
the wild-type (WT) Csy complex (kd1 = 2.1 3 10�7 s�1) (Figures
4D and S5). In addition to interaction with the thumb, a series
of acidic residues on the C-terminal a helix (a2) of each AcrF1
are wedged between positive charges on the extended web do-
mains of adjacent Cas7f molecules (Figure 4C). We predicted
that these interactions might be important for AcrF1 binding.
To test this, we mutated lysine 254 and 257 to alanines (i.e.,
Cas7f K254A/K257A), which resulted in a disruption of AcrF1
binding to the Csy complex (Figures 4D and S5).
Access to the crRNA guide is crucial for target DNA hybridiza-
tion and subsequent degradation. However, the thumb of each
Cas7 protein folds over the crRNA at regular 6-nucleotide inter-
vals, and in Cascade (type I-E), the thumb prevents base pairing
at these positions (Jackson et al., 2014a; Mulepati et al., 2014). In
the structure of Cascade bound to a single-stranded DNA, the
target hybridizes to 5-nucleotide segments of the guide, while
the 6th nucleobase is displaced, and the phosphate backbone
of the target traverses over the thumb and into the next acces-
sible segment. The two AcrF1 proteins sit on top of the Cas7.6f
and Cas7.4f thumbs, respectively, and the binding sites superim-
pose with an RMSD of 0.1 A
˚ . The AcrF1 proteins block the transi-
tion of target DNA from segment 1 to 2, and segment 3 to 4,
respectively. Furthermore, the extended web of Cas7.6f and
Cas7.4f is �6 A
˚ and �4 A
˚ (respectively) closer to the crRNA-guide
than the web of the other subunits, suggesting that AcrF1 binding
may induce a conformational change that restricts access to the
guide RNA (Figure 4E), though a structure of Csy complex without
the anti-CRISPRs will be necessary to know that the AcrF1 pro-
tein is directly responsible for this observation.
Since efficient AcrF1 binding relies on interactions with a few
key residues on Cas7f (Figure 4D), we expected these residues
to be under strong selective pressures. However, using a combi-
nation of evolutionary models, we were unable to find evidence
for positive selection at these positions (Pond et al., 2005). This
suggests that K85, K254, and K257 in Cas7f are important for
Csy function, which restricts mutations at these positions. Based
on the location and charge of these residues, we hypothesized
that they would be involved in DNA binding. To test this hypoth-
esis, we recombinantly expressed and purified the WT Csy com-
plex and complexes containing a mutation in Cas7f at position 85
(K85A) or a double mutation at positions 254 and 257 (i.e., Cas7f
K254A and K257A). The mutants express and purify like WT,
suggesting that these mutations do not perturb assembly of
the complex (Figure S5). Next, we used the purified complexes
to perform electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to
determine if these mutations perturb DNA binding (Figures 4F
and S5). Wild-type Csy complex binds to a 72-base-pair dou-
ble-stranded DNA target containing a protospacer and PAM
with high affinity (KD = 1.1 nM), while the mutants result in a
severe binding defect (KD > 1000 nM), indicating that the lysine
residues targeted by AcrF1 are also critical for DNA binding.
AcrF2 Is a DNA Mimic
AcrF2 is a small acidic protein wedged between positively
charged residues in the N-terminal hook of Cas8 and the thumb
of Cas7.6f (Figures 5A and 5B). Structure homology searches
performed using DALI and VAST indicated that AcrF2 adopts
a unique fold (Holm and Sander, 1993; Gibrat et al., 1996). The
AcrF2 fold is composed of a pair of antiparallel a helices packed
on either side of an antiparallel b sheet (a1a2b1b2b3b4a3a4). Inter-
estingly, this is similar to the fold of AcrF1 (b1b2b3b4a3a4), with the
addition of two amino-terminal antiparallel helices, raising the
possibility that these two Acr proteins may have evolved from a
common ancestor. Acidic residues on AcrF2 (i.e., D30, E77,
D76, E94, and E91) are positioned in close proximity to numerous
lysines on either Cas7.6f (i.e., K79 and K77) or Cas8f (i.e., K247,
K28, and K31). While the density in this region is not sufficient
to confidently model the side-chain positions of these residues,
we noticed a pseudo-helical display of acidic residues on the sur-
face of AcrF2 mimics the negative charge distribution on the he-
lical backbone of a DNA duplex (Figure 5C) and that distribution of
positively charged residues on the N-terminal hook of Cas8f and
the thumb of Cas7f.6 form a ‘‘lysine-rich, vise-like’’ structure that
has been shown to be crucial for DNA binding by Cascade (van
Erp et al., 2015). While the lysine-rich vise in Cascade is
composed of positively charged secondary structures on the
finger domains of Cas7.5e and Cas7.6e, our structure suggests
that the Csy complex may have evolved a functionally analogous
DNA vise composed of structurally distinct features. To test the
functional role of the positively charged residues on the putative
lysine-rich vise, we made charge-swapped mutations on Cas7f
(Cas7f K77E and K79E) and Cas8f (Cas8f K247E, K28E, and
K31E). These mutants express and purify like WT Csy complex,
suggesting that they do not perturb assembly of the Csy complex
(Figures S5). However, mutations in either Cas7f or Cas8f result in
severe binding defects for AcrF2 and DNA targets (Figures 5D,
5E, and S5). Taken together, these results suggest that AcrF2 is
a double-stranded DNA mimic that blocks target recognition by
competing for a critical DNA binding site (i.e., lysine-rich vise)
and that the lysine-rich vise is structurally plastic but functionally
conserved between the I-E and I-F crRNA-guided surveillance
systems.
DISCUSSION
Antagonistic interactions between predators (e.g., viruses) and
their prey (e.g., bacteria) create dynamic selective pressures
that drive diversification and genetic innovation (Van Valen,
Cell 169, 47–57, March 23, 2017
53
 1973). The remarkable diversity of CRISPR-Cas systems (two
classes, six types, and 19 subtypes) is consistent with their
role in defense against rapidly evolving predators, and the dis-
covery of diverse anti-CRISPRs with distributions that mirror
these immune systems is beginning to explain the molecular
basis of genetic conflict at the CRISPR-anti-CRISPR interface
(Pawluk et al., 2016; Carter et al., 2017).
To determine the mechanistic differences that distinguish type
I-F systems from other CRISPR-mediated immune systems, and
to understand the molecular mechanisms of AcrF1- and AcrF2-
mediated suppression, we determined the cryo-EM structure of
the Csy surveillance complex bound to both AcrF1 and AcrF2.
The seahorse-shaped morphology of the complex is similar to
what has been observed in recent structures of other class 1 sur-
veillance complexes (i.e., type I and III); however, significant
structural differences in individual subunits manifest in higher-
order morphological distinctions (Figure 2). Like other class 1
surveillance complexes, the backbone of the Csy complex is
composed of an assembly of Cas7-family proteins interwoven
around the crRNA. While the theme of Cas7 oligomerization
along the crRNA is conserved, the Cas7f fold is distinct, and
Cas7f-induced kinks in the crRNA result in a tight helical pitch
that creates a nearly closed ring-like structure. The appearance
of a closed ring is accentuated by an elongated Cas8-family tail
protein that extends toward the Cas6f head, and the C-terminal
helical domain of Cas8f is wedged in the middle of the Cas7f ring
(Figure 1).
While the fold of Cas7f is distinct from previously determined
Cas7-family proteins, the familiar right-hand morphology is
largely maintained, with one prominent distinction: the web
domain in Cas7f extends along the thumb, creating a conspicu-
ous trough between the web and the thumb domains (Figure 4A,
4C, and 4E). We anticipate that this positively charged trough
functions as an electrostatic cradle for the target strand as it tra-
verses over each thumb from one complementary segment of
the crRNA-guide to the next. The structure explains how two
molecules of AcrF1 interact with conserved lysine residues that
line this trough and block target binding by obstructing contig-
uous access of the target to adjacent segments of the crRNA-
guide sequences (Figure 4). In addition, the web domains of
Cas7.4f and Cas7.6f are closer to the crRNA, suggesting that
AcrF1 binding may induce local conformational changes that
further restrict target access. However, detection of lysines
K85, K254, and K257 by AcrF1 suggests that natural variation
at these positions would prevent AcrF1 binding and that these
mutants would escape AcrF1-mediated suppression of the im-
mune system. To test this hypothesis, we mutated these lysines
and show that they inhibit AcrF1 binding, but these mutations
also result in severe DNA-binding defects. Together, these re-
sults suggest that AcrF1 has evolved to target specific features
of the Csy complex that are essential for DNA binding.
In addition to binding the crRNA, structures of Cascade (type
I-E) have shown that a subset of the Cas7e proteins also play a
critical role in binding DNA (Hayes et al., 2016; Hochstrasser

and K31) that project into the AcrF2 binding site were mutated to glutamic acids.

 et al., 2014; Jackson et al., 2014a; van Erp et al., 2015; Wieden-
heft et al., 2011). The fingers domain of Cas7.6e rotates 180�,
creating a lysine-rich vise that makes a non-sequence specific
interaction with double-stranded DNA, and mutations in Cas7e
proteins that eliminate the positive charge no longer bind DNA
(van Erp et al., 2015). We anticipated that this would be a
conserved feature of the Cas7 backbone in type I surveillance
systems; however, no such rotation is observed in the Cas7.6f
subunit of the Csy complex. Instead, the structure reveals an
analogous lysine-rich, vise-like feature created by lysines dis-
played on the thumb of Cas7.6f and the N-terminal hook-domain
on Cas8f. The importance of these lysines may have escaped our
attention if it weren’t for the negative charge and positioning of
AcrF2 directly in the vise. Interestingly, acidic residues on the sur-
faceof AcrF2 mimic thenegative charge distribution onthe helical
backbone of a DNA duplex (Figure 5C), suggesting that AcrF2 is a
double-stranded DNA mimic that competes with DNA for binding
to the lysine-rich vise. Indeed, mutations in the lysine-rich vise
that inhibit AcrF2 binding also prevent DNA binding by the Csy
complex, which may explain why type I systems rely on distinct
structural innovations to achieve similar functions.
Phylogenetic and structural studies have shown that Cas8
proteins are extremely diverse, which, in light of the results pre-
sented here, may be in part due to selective pressures from anti-
CRISPR proteins. However, all Cas8 proteins appear to be
involved in tail assembly through interactions with both Cas5
and the 50 end of the crRNA (Hayes et al., 2016; Hochstrasser
et al., 2016; Jackson et al., 2014a; Jackson and Wiedenheft,
2015; Mulepati et al., 2014; Osawa et al., 2015; Taylor et al.,
2015; Zhang and Sontheimer, 2014; Zhao et al., 2014). In
E. coli, the thumb on Cas5e creates a cylindrical pore that serves
as a docking module for a short helix on Cas8e (also called
Cse1). This helix is within a loop called loop 1 (L1) that inserts
into the Cas5e helix-binding pore and makes base-specific inter-
actions with nucleotides in the 50 handle (Hayes et al., 2016;
Jackson et al., 2014a; Mulepati et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2014).
While the structural details are different, similar themes are
observed in the Csy complex, wherein the thumb and finger do-
mains of Cas5f protein grip a b hairpin (residues 175–191, called
the harpoon) of Cas8f, which makes both specific (e.g., Q177 in-
teracts with adenosine at position �5) and non-sequence-spe-
cific interaction with nucleotides in the 50 handle. In addition to
the role of Cas8 in tail assembly, a recent structure of Cascade
(type I-E) bound to a partial duplexed DNA target explains how
the N-terminal globular domain of Cas8e recognizes the PAM
sequence and how PAM recognition is coupled to strand sepa-
ration via insertion of a b hairpin called the glutamine wedge
(Hayes et al., 2016). Initial duplex destabilization by the wedge
may be coupled to the C-terminal domain of Cas8e, which con-
tains a four-helix bundle that appears to function like a molecular
pry bar to maintain separation of the two strands. The displaced
strand in this structure traverses over the four-helix bundle,
whereupon it is presumably presented to the trans-acting Cas3
nuclease-helicase, though the remainder of the displaced strand
was not included in the DNA target used in this structural study.
Although Cas8f does not share significant sequence similarity
with Cas8e, Cas8f also contains a C-terminal four-helix bundle,
and the central position and orientation of this structure suggests
that it may also be involved in strand separation during double-
stranded DNA binding.
Another conserved feature of all type I systems is that after
DNA binding by the crRNA-guided surveillance complex, they
all recruit Cas3, a trans-acting nuclease-helicase (Jackson
et al., 2014b). In type I-F systems, the Cas3 nuclease-helicase
is fused to an N-terminal Cas2 protein that is involved in new
sequence integration, and an anti-CRISPR protein (i.e., AcrF3)
that binds to Cas2/3 prevents recruitment to the Csy complex
(Bondy-Denomy et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016a; 2016b). Using
Dali (Holm and Sander, 1993), a structure homology search pro-
gram, we identified structural similarity between AcrF3 and the
C-terminal four-helix bundle of Cas8f (Figure S4). Cas8 proteins
in other systems have been shown to be involved in Cas3 recruit-
ment (Hochstrasser et al., 2014; Huo et al., 2014; Xue et al.,
2016), and we speculate that AcrF3 may be a molecular mimic
of the domain on Cas8f that is involved in Cas2/3 recruitment.
Presumably, CRISPRs evolved in response to antagonistic in-
teractions with molecular parasites such as phages, and phages
evolved anti-CRISPRs to subvert these systems. Here, we pro-
vide structural and biochemical evidence showing that anti-
CRISPR proteins AcrF1 and AcrF2 evolved to target specific
structural features that are essential for immune system function,
which suggests these antagonists play a central role in driving
the diversification of CRISPR-Cas immune systems.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Microbes
Escherichia coli cells were cultured on LB medium.
METHOD DETAILS
Expression and purification
The cas genes and a synthetic CRISPR were co-expressed on separate vectors in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells as previously described
(Rollins et al., 2015; Wiedenheft et al., 2011). The expression vectors have been deposited at Addgene (see Key Resources Table). In
brief, expression was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl-b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) when the culture reached an optical den-
sity of 0.5 (OD600 nm). Cells were incubated overnight at 16�C, then pelleted by centrifugation (5000 x g for 15 min at 4�C) and re-sus-
pended in lysis buffer (50 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) pH 7.5, 300 mM potassium chloride, 5%

 glycerol, 1 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP), 1x protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific)). Cell pellets
were sonicated on ice for 3 3 2.5 min (1 s on, 3 s off), lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 22,000 x g for 30 min at 4�C. The Cas7f
subunit includes an N-terminal strep-II tag and the Csy complex self-assembles in vivo. The intact complex was affinity purified using
StrepTrap HP resin (GE), eluted with lysis buffer supplemented with 2.5 mM desthiobiotin, and then concentrated (Corning Spin-X
concentrators) at 4�C before further purification over a Superdex 200 size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM HEPES
pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP.
Gene 35 from phage JBD30 (AcrF1) and gene 30 from phage D3112 (AcrF2) were cloned in a p15TV-L vector with N-terminal His6
tags and overexpressed in E. coli BL21 DE3 cells as previously described (Bondy-Denomy et al., 2015). Briefly, E. coli BL21 DE3 cells
were grown to an OD600 nm of 0.5 and then induced with IPTG for 3 hr at 37�C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 g for
10 min and suspended in a lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.5x protease inhibitor cocktail
(Thermo Scientific). The cells were lysed by sonication as described above and the lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 g for 15 min to
remove cell debris. The supernatant was injected into a Ni-NTA column, washed in with 20 mL of the lysis buffer supplemented with
20 mM imidazole and eluted from the column using a using a linear gradient from 20 mM to 300 mM imidazole in the wash buffer.
Fractions were collected, and concentrated (Corning Spin-X concentrators) at 4�C before further purification over a Superdex 75
size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP.
10- and 30-fold molar excess of the purified Acr proteins F1 and F2 (respectively), were added simultaneously to purified Csy com-
plex. The mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min and free Acr proteins were separated from the Csy bound proteins using a Super-
dex 200 size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP.
ELECTRON MICROSCOPY
Electron microscopy sample preparation
For negative stain electron microscopy (EM), 3 ml of purified (0.05 mg/ml) Csy complex bound to AcrF1 and AcrF2 (Csy-Acr complex)
was applied to freshly plasma cleaned 400 mesh Cu-Rh maxtaform grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) that were coated with a thin
layer of amorphous carbon. After incubating for 1 min at room temperature, excess protein was wicked away with a filter paper (What-
man No. 1), the grids were then stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl formate solution, and blotted to dryness.
Initial cryo-EM screening of the purified Csy-Acr complex on C-flat grids with 2mm holes and 2mm spacing (Protochips) showed an
orientation bias in ice. To overcome this issue, a thin amorphous carbon film was floated onto the holey C-flat grids. After plasma-
cleaning these grids, 5 mL of 0.1% (w/v) poly-L-lysine hydrobromide (Polysciences) was deposited on the carbon surface for 90 s,
blotted to dryness, followed by three successive washes with 10 mL drops of water at a time, then blotted to dryness. 4 uL of
0.1 mg/mL purified Csy-Acr complex was then applied on the poly-lysine-treated grids. Excess sample was manually blotted with
filter paper for �3–5 s, and the sample was immediately vitrified by plunge freezing in liquid-ethane slurry at –179�C. The entire pro-
cedure was carried out at 4�C and 98% relative humidity.
Electron microscopy data acquisition
Negative-stain EM micrographs were collected using the Leginon automated data acquisition software on a Tecnai Spirit (FEI) trans-
mission electron microscope operating at 120 keV (Suloway et al., 2005). Images were collected at a nominal magnification of
52,000x on an F416 CMOS 4K x 4K-pixel camera (TVIPS) with a pixel size of 2.05 A
˚ /pixel at specimen level. A total of 97 nega-
tive-stain micrographs were collected with an electron dose of 20 e-/A
˚ 2 using a defocus range of 0.5 mm to 1.5 mm.
Cryo grids were loaded into a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope operating at 300 keV. Micrographs were acquired us-
ing the Leginon data collection software (Suloway et al., 2005) at a nominal magnification of 29,000X (1.026A
˚ /pixel at the specimen
level) using a total dose of �46 e-/A
˚ 2 and a nominal defocus range of 1.2 to 2.5 mm. A total of 2,261 micrographs were acquired using a
Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector, operated in electron counting mode. Each micrograph was acquired as a 30-frame dose-
fractionated movie during a 6 s exposure.
Electron microscopy data processing
The Appion image processing pipeline was used for processing of micrographs and initial 2D analyses of both negative stain and
cryo-EM data (Lander et al., 2009).
Negative stain data
CTFFind3 was used to determine the contrast transfer function (CTF) of each negatively stained micrograph, and particles were
selected from micrographs using a Difference of Gaussians (DoG)-based automated particle picker (Mindell and Grigorieff, 2003;
Voss et al., 2009). Phases for each micrograph were corrected using the EMAN software package (Ludtke et al., 1999), and
14,542 particles were extracted using a 160 3 160 pixel box. Individual particles were normalized by eliminating pixels with values
above or below 4.5 s of the mean pixel value using the normalization function in the XMIPP package (Sorzano et al., 2004) and the
particles were then binned by a factor of four to speed up computation. The extracted particle dataset was subjected to five rounds of
iterative multivariate statistical analysis (MSA) (Ogura et al., 2003), and multi-reference alignment (MRA) in Appion to remove any erro-
neously picked non-particle features and aggregates. This resulted in a final stack of 13,476 particles, which was used for 3D pro-
cessing using RELION (Scheres, 2012). A cylindrical disc having roughly the same dimensions as the Csy-Acr complex was used as
e3
Cell 169, 47–57.e1–e5, March 23, 2017
 starting volume for 3D processing. Multiple iterations of 3D classification and auto-refinement yielded a final 3D reconstruction (Fig-
ures S1A–S1C) with a resolution of �25 A
˚ (at 0.143 gold-standard Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC)).
Cryo-EM data
The individual frames of each cryo micrograph were translationally aligned to account for beam-induced motion and drift using the
GPU frame alignment program MotionCorr (Li et al., 2013), implemented in the Appion workflow. A frame offset of 7 and a B-factor of
1000 pixels was used for frame alignment. CTF parameters were estimated with CTFFind3 (Mindell and Grigorieff, 2003) (Figures
S1D–S1F), and images reporting a confidence value of less than 90% accuracy were discarded. Initially DoGPicker was used for
automated particle picking from 200 micrographs, and a stack of �50,000 particles was extracted using a box size of 320 pixels.
These particles were then subjected to reference-free alignment and classification using MSA/MRA after binning to a pixel size of
2.05 A
˚ /pixel. Selected 2D class averages were then used as templates for reference-based automated particle picking from all
the micrographs using the program FindEM (Roseman, 2004), and a new stack of 199,348 particles was extracted with a 320-pixel
box size. This stack was binned to a pixel size of 2.05 A
˚ /pixel and subjected to MSA/MRA 2D classification, as described before. After
discarding particles belonging 2D classes depicting non-particle features or aggregates, a stack of 145,874 particles was created.
Coordinates of these particles were imported into Relion1.4 (Scheres, 2014), and particles were re-extracted with a pixel size of
2.05 A
˚ /pixel and box size of 160 pixels. These particles were then subjected to 25 iterations of reference-free 2D classification within
Relion. After discarding particles belonging to 2D class averages lacking high-resolution structural features, a new stack of 68,548
particles was created (Figure S3). This particle stack was then subjected to 3D auto-refinement within RELION, using a 40 A
˚ low-pass
filtered negative stain reconstruction of the Csy-Acr complex as a starting volume. After this 3D refinement, the particle stack was
subjected to 3D classification, requesting 3 classes and without performing angular or translational searches, in order to sort out
structural heterogeneity. After 25 iterations of 3D classification, 57,647 particles belonging to the class that represented the complete
Csy-Acr complex and showed the highest levels of structural details, were re-centered and re-extracted from the micrographs with a
pixel size of 1.026 A
˚ /pixel and box size of 320 pixels. These particles were then subjected to further 3D refinement runs that resulted in
a reconstruction with an overall resolution of 3.9 A
˚ (by gold-standard FSC at 0.143). In order to improve the resolution of the recon-
struction, we performed the particle polishing procedure in RELION 1.4 to correct for individual particle movement and radiation
damage (Scheres, 2014). A new round of 3D refinement with the polished particle stack resulted in a 3.5 A
˚ (at an FSC of 0.143)
reconstruction.
Density corresponding the Cas6 head and Cas8 tail was poorly resolved in the 3D reconstruction, due to intrinsic flexibility. A soft-
edged binary mask was created by applying an 8-pixel extension and a 10-pixel cosine edge fall-off to the 3D reconstruction, with
density corresponding to the flexible head and tail portions removed. The polished particle stack after 3D refinement was subjected
to 3D classification without angular or translational search, with this binary mask applied. This eliminated particles that lacked high-
resolution structural information for the stable core region of the complex, leading to a new stack of 51,212 particles. This particle
stack was then subjected to 3D auto-refinement in RELION to generate the final 3D map of the Csy-Acr complex (Figure S3). The
overall resolution of this map estimated using a gold-standard FSC at a cutoff of 0.143 is 3.4 A
˚ , and a B-factor of �71 A
˚ 2 was applied
during RELION post-processing to generate a sharpened map that was used for atomic modeling. The local resolution estimation
was performed using the two half volumes generated during 3D auto-refinement, with the ‘blocres’ function in the Bsoft package
(Figure S1H) (Heymann and Belnap, 2007).
In order to improve the quality of the reconstructed map at the flexible tail region of the Csy-Acr complex, we used the signal-sub-
tracted focus classification and refinement technique in RELION (Figure S3) (Bai et al., 2015). A soft-edged binary mask for the tail
region was applied to the polished particle stack from the first 3D refinement to generate a signal-subtracted stack of particles for
focused analysis. Initiating a completely de novo 3D classification and auto-refinement run (starting with larger angular and transla-
tional search) using the signal-subtracted particle stack resulted in a 3D density of very poor quality. Instead, we replaced the original
stack file with the signal-subtracted stack in the final optimizer file of the 3D refinement and ‘‘continued’’ the refinement. This was
followed by a 3D classification run requesting 2 classes, without performing angular or translational search, and using a regularization
parameter value of 15. 33,553 signal-subtracted particles from the 3D class, containing the highest resolution structural information,
were then subjected to 3D auto-refinement by continuing with the last angular and translational search parameters from the 3D
refinement step using polished particles. This procedure produced a better quality final map at �4A
˚ resolution (gold-standard
FSC at 0.143), and was used for building atomic model for the tail region. Similar attempts for improving the quality of the EM density
map for the head region did not result in an improved map.
Atomic model building and refinement
De novo atomic models were built for six Cas7f, one Cas8f, one Cas5f, two AcrF2, and 40 nucleotides of the crRNA (without the
30-hairpin), by using a combination of the stable core map and the focused map for the tail region. COOT was used for model building
and visualization (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004). Two copies of the NMR structure of AcrF1 (PDB: 2LW5) were initially rigid-body fit into
the EM density map using UCSF Chimera (Goddard et al., 2007) and manually manipulated to fit the EM density using refinement
tools in COOT. These coarse models were then refined using real-space refinement in PHENIX v1.11 (Adams et al., 2010). After re-
laxing this initial, refined model using the Rosetta suite (DiMaio et al., 2015), 200 models were generated using Rosetta refinement
program. The resulting models were sorted based on Rosetta score, clash score, Ramachandran outliers, and MolProbity score.
The top scoring model was then re-refined using PHENIX real-space refinement, and regions with bad geometries were manually
Cell 169, 47–57.e1–e5, March 23, 2017
e4
 inspected using COOT. Restraints for secondary structure, Ramachandran, and non-crystallographic symmetry were used during
PHENIX real-space refinement runs. Several iterative rounds of refinement and inspection of the model were performed until a
consensus model of the complex was obtained. The crystal structure of Cas6 and crRNA 30-hairpin (PDB: 4AL5) was rigid-body
fit into a lower resolution, unsharpened map of the Csy-Acr complex, using UCSF Chimera (Figures S1 and S2). To limit over-inter-
pretation of the atomic model in regions of weak electron density, side chains lacking well-resolved features in the reconstruction
were truncated to the C-beta carbon. The docked Cas6 crystal structure was reduced to a C-alpha backbone for deposition. The
top 5 atomic models resulting from PHENIX real-space refinement were deposited together to the PDB databank (PDB: 5UZ9).
Mutagenesis
Mutants were made by site directed mutagenesis using quick change (Aglient) or Q5 method (NEB). Primers for mutagenesis are
listed in the Key Resources Table.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay
Oligonucleotides (Eurofins) listed in the Key Resources Table were 50 end labeled with 32P-ATP (PerkinElmer) using T4 polynucleotide
kinase (NEB). Labeled oligonucleotides were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by MicroSpin G-25 columns (GE
Healthcare). dsDNA was prepared by mixing labeled oligonucleotides with more than five-fold molar excess of the complementary
oligonucleotide in hybridization buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 75 mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, 10% glycerol and 0.01% bromophenol blue).
The mixture was incubated at 95�C for 5 min, and gradually cooled to 25�C in a thermocycler. Oligonucleotide duplexes were gel
purified, ethanol precipitated, and recovered in hybridization buffer. Increasing concentrations of WT or Csy mutants were incubated
with oligonucleotides in hybridization buffer plus 1 mM TCEP. Samples were incubated for 15 min at 37�C, loaded onto a 6% native
polyacrylamide gel and run for 3 hr at 150 V at 4�C. Gels were dried, exposed to phosphor storage screens, and scanned with a
Typhoon (GE Healthcare) phosphorimager. Bound and unbound DNA fractions were quantified using ImageQuant software (GE
Healthcare). After background subtraction, the fractions of bound oligonucleotides were plotted against total Csy concentration.
The data were fit by nonlinear regression analysis using the equation:
Fraction bound DNA =
�
M1 � ½Csy�total
���
KD + ½Csy�total
�
Where M1 is the amplitude of the binding curve. Equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) are the average of three independent ex-
periments and error bars represent standard deviations.

Experiments were conducted with a Biacore X100 SPR instrument (GE Healthcare). Purified Csy complex with 6his-tagged Cas7
subunits was immobilized on a Ni-NTA coated sensor chip. Purified AcrF1 was injected into the buffer flow in increasing concentra-
tions (30.9 nM, 92.6 nM, 278 nM, 833 nM, 2.5 uM). Experiments were conducted at 37�C, in 20 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 1mM TCEP,
0.005% Tween. Data were fit with a model describing a single ligand protein (Csy complex) bound by two analyte proteins (AcrF1).
Kinetic rate constants were extracted from this curve fit using Biacore evaluation software (GE). A similar method was used to mea-
sure interactions between Csy and AcrF2; however, immobilization of Csy complex on the Ni-NTA chip was perturbed by the addition
of AcrF2, so we covalently immobilized Csy complex by amine coupling to the surface of a carboxymethyldextran-modified (CM5)
sensor chip. Purified AcrF2 was injected into the buffer flow in increasing concentrations (12.1 nM, 40.5 nM, 135 nM, 450 nM, 1.5 uM),
and Csy complex-ACRF2 binding events were recorded in real time. Experiments were conducted at 37�C, in 20 mM Tris, 100 mM
NaCl, 1mM TCEP, 0.005% Tween. Data were fit with a model describing a bivalent analyte. Kinetic rate constants were extracted
from this curve fit using Biacore evaluation software (GE).

 Supplemental Figures
Figure S1. Electron Microscopy of Csy Complex Bound to Two Different Virally Encoded Anti-CRISPR Proteins, Related to Figure 1
(A) A negatively stained micrograph of the Csy-Acr complex showing monodisperse particles.
(B) Representative reference-free 2D class averages of negative stained particles.
(C) Negative stain reconstruction of the Csy-Acr complex at �25A
˚ resolution. This was used as initial reference volume for cryo-EM reconstruction.
(D) A representative cryo-EM micrograph of the Csy-Acr complexes in vitreous ice over thin carbon coated with polylysine.
(E) Fourier transform of the micrograph shown in (D), with Thon rings extending beyond 4A
˚ (white dotted line).
(F) 1D plot showing the correlation (green line) between the experimental and estimated contrast transfer function of the micrograph (blue and black lines,
respectively).
(G) Representative reference-free 2D class averages of particles extracted from cryo-EM micrographs, shows different orientations of the Csy-Acr complex in ice.
(H) Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) curves between the two independently reconstructed half maps (black curve, gold standard FSC curve), atomic model versus
summed map (blue curve), and model versus half map1 (red curve) and half map2 (yellow curve).
(I) Euler angle distribution of all particles that contributed to the final 3D reconstructed map of the Csy-Acr complex. The position of each blue sphere relative to the
3D density map (gray in the center) corresponds to its angular assignment, and the radius of the sphere is proportional to the number of particles in that
orientation.
(J) The final reconstructed map colored by local resolution estimation using Bsoft’s ‘‘blocres’’ function (Heymann and Belnap, 2007). The majority of the map is
close to �3A
˚ resolution, with peripheral regions in the flexible tail and head are not as well resolved.
 Figure S2. Atomic Models of Different Subunits of Csy-Acr Complex and Corresponding Cryo-EM Density, Related to Figure 1
EM density for each subunit is shown as a gray mesh.
(A) Density from one of the six Cas7f subunits, with the atomic model is shown in blue. To the right, a segment of this subunit containing helices, turns, and a b
strand is shown. Side chains of certain residues are labeled to illustrate that individual residues could be unambiguously built into the map.
(B) Cas5f subunit map and model (orange).
(C) Cas8f subunit map and model (purple).
(D) The crRNA map and model. Density corresponding to the 30-hairpin of the crRNA was poorly resolved and is not included.
(E) Density for the Cas6f ‘‘head’’ and the 30-hairpin was not sufficiently for model building, but a co-crystal structure of P. aeruginosa Cas6f bound to the 30-hairpin
(PDB: 4AL5, yellow) was rigid-body docked into the low-resolution density.
(F) AcrF1 model (red) and map.
(G) AcrF2 model (green) and map.
 Figure S3. Cryo-EM Data Processing Workflow for 3D Reconstruction and Focused Refinement, Related to Figure 1
(A) For initial refinement and 3D classification, data were binned to 2.05 A
˚ /pixel and particles extracted with a box size of 160 pixels. For all subsequent processing
steps, data were extracted at 1.026 A
˚ /pixel with a box size of 320 pixels. All the 3D classification steps were performed without angular or translational searches.
The stack of polished/dose-weighted particles (indicated with *) was used for focused 3D analysis to better resolve the ‘‘tail-region’’ of the complex (described in
STAR Methods). The 3D masks used for particle polishing and the final refinements are shown.
(B) Focused 3D analysis of the Csy-Acr complex ‘‘tail-region.’’ Ab-initio 3D refinement with the signal subtracted particle stack using the segmented tail density as
an initial model did not improve the resolution the tail. An improved map was obtained by performing 3D refinement using local angular and translational searches
(local 3D refinement).
(C) The final map for the tail after focused 3D refinement (shown on the right) had better resolved structural details than the corresponding region in the original 3D
refinement (left). A helix density from the Cas8f subunit in the tail has been magnified to exemplify the improvement in map quality using the focused refinement
approach.
 Figure S4. Cas7f Has a Distinct Fold, and the C-terminal Helical Bundle of Cas8f is Structurally Similar to AcrF3, Related to Figures 2, 3, and 5
(A) Cas7 family proteins presented in the ‘‘right-hand’’ orientation. In contrast to other Cas7 family proteins where the fingers and thumb domains are insertions in
an RRM (plam), the palm of Cas7f is not an RRM. The Cas7f palm contains only a one small insertion (orange), and the thumb and fingers domains are composed
of N- and C-terminal extensions (blue and red, respectively).
(B) Cartoon showing the topology of the Cas7f palm compared to the canonical Cas7 family RRM.
(C) The Cas8f structure was used to perform structural homology search using Dali (Holm and Sander, 1993). AcrF3 was identified as one of the top hits (z-score of
5.3). Superposition of AcrF3 (pink) structure on the C-terminal helix-bundle domain of Cas8f (violet). The RMSD for 114 equivalently positioned C-alpha atoms
is 4.1 A

 Figure S5. Mutations in the Csy Complex Perturb DNA Binding and Anti-CRISPR Binding Kinetics, Related to Figures 4 and 5
(A) Elution profile of the WT Csy complex and different mutants. The insert shows a Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel (top) and a denaturing polyacrylamide
gel of phenol:chloroform extracted crRNA isolated for the each of the Csy complexes (bottom).
(B) Binding isotherms based on electrophoretic mobility shift assays performed by adding increasing concentrations (0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 100, 1000,
10000 nM) of purified WT or mutant Csy complexes to a 72-nt double-stranded DNA that was 32P-labeled on the complementary strand. The fraction of DNA
bound was plotted as a function of increasing Csy concentration. Equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) were determined from an average of three independent
experiments and the error bars represent standard deviations.
(C) Representative gels for each of the six different Csy complexes.

 (D) Overlay of sensorgrams from surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments, used to determine kinetics of anti-CRISPR AcrF1 binding to WT Csy complex
(black) or Csy complex with mutations in Cas7f subunit (green and gray). Data were fit with a model describing binding for a heterogenous ligand (i.e., binding of
two analyte proteins to a single ligand protein) (red lines). Rate constants are reported in the table on the right.
(E) Overlay of sensorgrams from surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments, used to determine kinetics of anti-CRISPR AcrF2 binding to WT Csy complex
(black), or Csy complex with mutations in Cas7f (gray) or Cas8f subunits (violet and purple). Data were fit with a model describing binding of a bivalent analyte (i.e.,
one analyte protein binding spatially discrete areas on the same ligand protein). Rate constants are reported in the table on the right.
