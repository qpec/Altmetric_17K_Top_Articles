IMPORTANCE Low-income and minority mothers experience a disproportionate incidence of
depression and lack access to treatment services. Development of prevention strategies in
accessible community-based venues is a potentially important public health strategy.
OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy of a depression prevention strategy embedded in
Head Start.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical trial was performed from
February 15, 2011, through May 9, 2016, at 6 Head Start agencies serving families at or below
the federal poverty level. Participants included mothers with depressed mood, anhedonia, or
depression history but who were not in a current major depressive episode. Participants were
followed up for 12 months with masked outcome assessments. Final follow-up was
completed on May 9, 2016.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized to a problem-solving education (PSE)
intervention (n = 111) or usual Head Start services (n = 119).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were problem-solving skills and
depressive symptoms. To capture the chronicity and intensity of symptoms, the Quick
Inventory of Depressive Symptoms was administered bimonthly, and rates of clinically
significant symptom elevations were compared across groups. Secondarily, the presence of
a major depressive episode was assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV
Axis I Disorders.
RESULTS Among the 230 participants, 152 (66.1%) were Hispanic, with a mean (SD) age of
31.4 (7.3) years. An intention-to-treat analysis among 223 participants contributing follow-up
data found no differences in problem-solving skills across groups. The mean (SD) number of
depressive symptom elevations among the PSE participants was 0.84 (1.39) compared with
1.12 (1.47) among the usual service participants (adjusted incident rate ratio [aIRR], 0.60; 95%
CI, 0.41-0.90). In analyses stratified according to baseline depressive symptoms, PSE exerted
a preventive effect among those with lower-level baseline symptoms, with a mean (SD) of
0.39 (0.84) elevations among PSE participants compared with 0.88 (1.37) among usual
service participants (aIRR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.21-0.75). However, no difference was observed
among those with higher-level baseline symptoms (mean [SD] elevations, 2.06 [1.92] for PSE
and 2.00 [1.91] for usual service; aIRR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.67-1.80). Analysis of symptom scores
followed the same pattern, with an adjusted mean reduction of 1.33 (95% CI, 0.36-2.29)
among participants with lower-level baseline symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The PSE intervention is efficacious in preventing depressive
symptom episodes and performs optimally among those with initial low-level symptoms.
Additional effectiveness studies in Head Start are necessary to develop meaningful public
health programs.

aternal depression disproportionately affects low-
income and minority women and negatively affects
children.1 In 2009, the Institute of Medicine pub-
lished a report, Depression in Parents, Parenting, and Chil-
dren: Opportunities to Improve Identification, Treatment, and
Prevention,inwhichitcalledforinitiativestotakeplaceincom-
munity-based venues capable of providing services for adults
and children.2 One such venue in the United States is Head
Start, a federally funded early learning program that provides
services for approximately 1 million low-income families each
year.3DepressionaffectsalmosthalfofallHeadStartmothers.4
Because of disparities in access to mental health services
for low-income and minority populations,5,6 embedding ef-
fective mental illness prevention strategies in accessible com-
munity-based venues such as Head Start is a potentially im-
portant public health strategy. Our particular approach used
the paradigm of screening, brief intervention, and referral to
treatment,7 in which screening identified an at-risk popula-
tion, a brief intervention aimed to prevent the emergence or
worsening of depressive symptoms, and individuals with per-
sistent or escalating symptoms were referred to formal behav-
ioral health services.
Our brief intervention was problem-solving education
(PSE), a 6-session cognitive behavioral program. Although
problem solving has served as a component of other depres-
sionpreventionandtreatmentmodels,8-10ourstudy,tothebest
of our knowledge, is the first to embed a lay-delivered inter-
vention in a community-based agency charged with address-
ing the needs of low-income families. In the case manage-
ment infrastructure of Head Start, we randomized participants
to receive PSE or usual Head Start case management services.
During 12 months of follow-up, we measured problem-
solving skills and depressive symptoms as our primary inter-
vention outcomes.
Methods
Design
We conducted a parallel-group efficacy trial with 1:1 random-
ization. We worked within 6 Head Start centers in Boston, Mas-
sachusetts, serving families of children from birth to 5 years
of age at or below the federal poverty level. A copy of the study
protocol is found in the Supplement. We enrolled partici-
pantsfromFebruary15,2011,throughMay20,2015.HeadStart
caseworkers screened mothers for depression risk; research
staff assessed eligibility and obtained informed consent. The
institutional review board of Boston University Medical Cen-
ter approved this study. All participants provided written in-
formed consent.
Participants
We recruited mothers whose children were expected to re-
main in Head Start for at least 6 months, targeting those at in-
creasedriskfordepressionbutexcludingthoseinacurrentma-
jor depressive episode (MDE).11 At risk was defined as
experiencing depressed mood or anhedonia according to the
Patient Health Questionnaire–212 or a recent history of depres-
sion according to the Composite International Diagnostic
Interview.13 We determined the presence of an MDE using the
Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview.14 We ex-
cluded mothers with high levels of suicidal ideation accord-
ing to the suicide screen of the MacArthur Initiative on De-
pressionandPrimaryCare15andthosewithcognitivelimitation
according to the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool.16
We enrolled English- and Spanish-speaking mothers.
Randomization
We used stratified, blocked randomization to allocate partici-
pants to PSE or usual Head Start services according to com-
puter-generated lists. Randomization occurred indepen-
dently at each Head Start site in strata defined by depression
history and was balanced in randomly varying blocks of 2 and
4. Lists were concealed in opaque envelopes. Outcome asses-
sors, investigators, and Head Start personnel were masked to
allocation.
Study Arms
Usual Head Start services included regular family needs as-
sessments, home visitation, parenting groups, referrals to be-
havioral health services, and assistance with accessing com-
munity resources for food, job training, and housing. We
decided against a formal attention control group because we
wantedtocompareourinterventionwithreal-worldHeadStart
services and because such services already represent a high
level of interpersonal attention.
The PSE intervention included the following 3 compo-
nents: a series of 6 one-on-one workbook-based problem-
solving sessions (adapted from Hegel and Arean17), depres-
sive symptom monitoring, and linkage to formal mental health
services when necessary. Problem-solving sessions lasted 30
to 60 minutes and were conducted as home visits or in Head
Start centers for 6 to 8 weeks. Each session consisted of the
following 7 steps: defining a problem, goal setting, generat-
ing solutions, implementing decision-making guidelines,
evaluating solutions, implementing solutions, and evaluat-
ing outcomes. Motivational interviewing was used to pro-
mote intervention adherence.18
Key Points
Question Is a lay-delivered, problem-solving intervention
embedded in Head Start efficacious in preventing clinically
important depressive symptom episodes among at-risk,
low-income mothers?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 230 Head Start
mothers, those receiving problem-solving education experienced
a 60% incident rate of depressive symptom episodes compared
with those not receiving it. Among the subpopulation with low
symptom levels at baseline, those receiving problem-solving
education experienced a 39% incident rate.
Meaning The efficacy of problem-solving education
demonstrates the promise of embedding maternal depression
prevention programs in Head Start; additional effectiveness
studies are necessary to develop meaningful public health
programs.

 The PSE providers assessed depressive symptoms with
the Patient Health Questionnaire–919 at every other session.
Participants with moderate symptoms on 2 assessments or
severe symptoms on a single assessment were referred to
mental health services using motivational interviewing
techniques. A crisis management plan was implemented for
suicidal ideation.
Intervention Provider Training
We trained 15 lay intervention providers (not licensed mental
health clinicians). Training workshops lasted 1 day and were
followed by up to 5 training cases. Trainees were certified as
PSE providers after completing 2 cases in which they met fi-
delity criteria according to standardized criteria developed in
prior work.20 Trainees learned motivational interviewing in a
separate 2-day workshop. Participants were randomly as-
signed to linguistically matched providers.
Supervision and Fidelity Monitoring
Provider supervision consisted of weekly group meetings, fa-
cilitated by a master’
s-level social worker (Y.D.-L.). We audio-
taped1randomlyselectedsessionforeachparticipantandused
the same fidelity criteria as in provider training. Fidelity was
rated according to the proportion of core PSE components de-
livered appropriately on a scale ranging from poor (<60%) to
excellent (≥90%).
Baseline Data

age and number of children, race/ethnicity, educational level,

 includes subscales in positive and negative orientation, avoid-
ance, impulsivity, and rationality.23
We assessed depressive symptoms with the Quick Inven-
tory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS).24 We used the widely ac-
ceptedQIDSscorecutpointsof11orgreater,theclinicalthresh-
old for moderately severe symptoms,25 and 14 or greater, the
threshold that optimally balances sensitivity and specificity
for estimating MDE.26
Outcome Assessment
We followed up participants for 12 months, beginning data col-
lection 2 months after randomization. To determine use of
mental health services, we administered an adapted version
of the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Studies27 for bi-
monthly assessment of use of specialty services (eg, psychia-
trist, psychologist, therapist, or social worker) during the pre-
ceding 2 months. Follow-up was completed on May 9, 2016.
We assessed problem-solving skills at 6 and 12 months, ex-
amining results as change scores for the composite measure
and for the positive problem orientation and rational problem-
solving subscales. We assessed depressive symptoms bi-
monthly, operationalizing our primary outcome as eleva-
tions to the moderately severe threshold (QIDS score, ≥11). We
conducted sensitivity analyses using the QIDS threshold score
of at least 14. As an exploratory analysis, we assessed at 12
months of follow-up whether participants met criteria for MDE
at any point during the follow-up period or during the fol-
low-up period’
s final month. We had initially planned to use
the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for this
purpose13 but, after trial enrollment began, decided to use the
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders.28 We
made this change before assessing any participants for MDE.
Statistical Analysis
To compare use of mental health services across study
groups, we conducted χ2 analyses of utilization data aggre-
gated across the full follow-up period. To estimate interven-
tion effect on our primary outcome measures, we conducted
intention-to-treat analyses using a set of binary variables to
model the effects of the Head Start site.29 To assess problem-
solving skills, we used linear regression to compare change
scores between baseline and 6 months and between baseline
and 12 months. We used negative binomial regression to
compare rates of depressive symptom elevations during
follow-up, using an offset to standardize rates according to
the number of assessments completed. Consistent with prior
work,8,20 we adjusted all main effects models for baseline
QIDS score.
We conducted stratified analyses to determine whether a
differentialinterventioneffectoccurredamongmotherswhose
baseline QIDS scores were higher or lower than either of the 2
prespecified thresholds and formally assessed effect modifi-
cation by entering group-by-QIDS threshold interaction terms
into the models. In our primary analysis, we stratified accord-
ing to the QIDS threshold of 11 or greater; in our sensitivity
analysis, we stratified according to the threshold of 14 or
greater. For those with baseline scores below the threshold, we
used Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards re-
gression models to determine differences in time to symp-
tom elevation. In stratified models, we removed baseline QIDS
score as a covariate.
We analyzed mean QIDS scores over time using linear
models to examine time-averaged scores and group-by-time

 interaction effects. We used logistic regression to model the
incidence of MDE.
We explored provider effects by estimating regression
models to determine variation in participant outcomes across
PSE providers, controlling for Head Start site. We verified our
main results using multiple imputation techniques for miss-
ing data. We imputed data in 20 sequential data sets using in-
formation (maternal age, educational level, work, and single-
vs-dual parent status; number of children; depression and
anxiety scores; and trauma history) at earlier points to im-
pute data at later points. We conducted all analyses with SAS
software (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc). Unless otherwise in-
dicated, data are expressed as mean (SD).
Sample Size
We estimated our sample size to provide power to test a clini-
cally significant difference across intervention arms on the
composite problem-solving measure and rate of symptom el-
evations. We estimated that a sample size of 100 per group
would be able to detect a 1-point difference in mean compos-
ite problem-solving scores, and a Poisson regression analysis
would be able to detect a 33% reduction in the rate of symp-
tom elevations from 1.2 to 0.8 per 6 assessments. Our sample
size of 230 assumed 80% power, a 2-sided α value of .05, and
15% loss to follow-up.
Results
Enrollment
Head Start caseworkers screened 2208 mothers (Figure 1); 781
met depression risk criteria. Of these, 179 were ineligible be-
cause the child was expected to leave Head Start within 6
months. Of the remaining 602 mothers, 136 could not be con-
tacted and 129 refused participation. Staff met with the re-
maining 337 mothers for eligibility determination; of these, 73
met criteria for MDE, 1 had suicidal ideation, and 2 had cog-
nitivelimitations,leaving261eligibleparticipants.Nineofthese
declined consent, and 22 were randomly selected to partici-
pate in a separate study. We enrolled the remaining 230 moth-
ers (mean [SD] age, 31.4 [7.3] years).
Baseline Characteristics
Hispanicmothersconstitutedmostofoursample(152[66.1%]).
Seventy mothers (30.4%) had moderately severe depressive
symptoms at baseline. Thirty-three women (14.3%) were tak-
ing antidepressant medication; 97 (42.2%) had a history of
MDE. None of these baseline measures differed between study
groups (Table 1). Although baseline mean depressive symp-
tom scores were balanced between groups (8.11 [5.20] in PSE
vs 7.59 [4.38] in usual service groups), the PSE group had a
higher proportion of mothers at the QIDS threshold of 14 or
greater (23 [20.7%] vs 8 [6.7%]).
Intervention Delivery and Fidelity
The PSE group included 111 mothers. Across 15 PSE providers,
the mean caseload size was 7.4 (7.5) clients, with a range from
1 to 26. Of a possible 6 PSE sessions, the mean number com-
pleted was 4.64 (2.06); 65 participants (58.6%) completed a
full PSE course. Of 54 audiotaped PSE sessions (57 mothers de-
clined audiotaping), 28 met criteria for good model fidelity
(≥80% of PSE components delivered), 25 met criteria for ex-
cellent fidelity (≥90%), and 1 audiofile was damaged. Problem-
solving education providers referred 10 mothers to formal
mental health services and responded to possible mental
health crises for 13, none of which eventuated in an adverse
event. Thirty-seven of 105 PSE participants (35.2%) engaged
with specialty mental health services during follow-up com-
pared with 39 of 118 (33.1%) usual service participants
(P = .73).

 Problem Solving
Mean composite problem-solving scores in the PSE group
changedfrom13.04(2.83)atbaselineto13.55(2.68)at6months
and 14.12 (2.79) at 12 months. In the usual service group, they
changedfrom13.02(2.63)atbaselineto13.34(2.38)at6months
and 13.81 (2.78) at 12 months, amounting to no statistically sig-
nificant differences across groups (Table 2).
Depressive Symptoms
The QIDS scores were missing from 102 of 1380 possible fol-
low-up assessments (7.4%). In the full sample, the mean num-
ber of moderately severe symptom elevations in the PSE group
was 0.84 (1.39) compared with 1.12 (1.47) in the usual service
group; considering a possible 6 outcome assessments, rates
were 0.17 (0.28) and 0.28 (0.35), respectively. This difference
produced an adjusted incident rate ratio (aIRR) of 0.60 (95%
CI, 0.41-0.90) in favor of PSE.
Because we found a significant interaction between study
group and baseline QIDS score (group-by-QIDS interaction,
P = .03), we conducted stratified analyses to determine the dif-
ference in intervention effect among mothers above or below
the QIDS threshold of 11 or greater at baseline (Table 3). Among
those below the threshold, PSE exerted a preventive effect on
symptom elevations (aIRR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.21-0.75); how-
ever,amongthoseabovethethreshold,PSEhadnoeffect(aIRR,

0.09-1.71). However, because of an interaction (P = .08) be-
tween study group and baseline QIDS score, we conducted
stratified analyses to determine the difference in interven-
tion effect among mothers with and without moderately

a Sample sizes are provided for the strata defined by baseline QIDS score above
or below a threshold of 11 or greater. If we apply the threshold of 14 or greater,
the lower baseline symptom stratum has 83 PSE and 110 usual service
participants, and the higher baseline symptoms stratum has 22 PSE and 8
usual service participants. All models are adjusted for Head Start site.
bChange scores range from −5.2 to 6.2, with higher scores indicating more
positive change.
c Change scores range from −2.4 to 2.4, with higher scores indicating more
positive change.
dChange scores from −2.6 to 2.4, with higher scores indicating more positive
change.
e Among the subgroup below the threshold, the mean (SD) number of
moderately severe depressive symptom spikes in the PSE group was 0.39
(0.84) compared with 0.88 (1.37) in the usual service group; the mean (SD)
number of more severe spikes in the PSE group was 0.24 (0.73) compared
with 0.56 (1.15) in the usual service group.
f Among the subgroup above the threshold, the mean (SD) number of
moderately severe depressive symptom spikes in the PSE group was 2.06
(1.92) compared with 2.00 (1.91) in the usual service group; the mean (SD)
number of more severe spikes in the PSE group was 1.23 (1.48) compared with
1.25 (1.28) in the usual service group.
g When we model symptom spikes as elevations to the QIDS threshold of 14 or
greater, we also define our strata according to that threshold.

 severe symptoms at baseline (Figure 2B). Among those with
scores below the threshold, PSE produced a significant
reduction in time-averaged symptom scores (adjusted differ-
ence, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.36-2.29); however, among those with
scores above the threshold at baseline, PSE produced no sig-
nificant reduction (adjusted difference, −0.33; 95% CI, −2.10
to 1.44). In all models, the group-by-time interaction terms
were nonsignificant.
Twenty-five of 102 PSE participants (24.5%) met MDE cri-
teria during the full follow-up period compared with 32 of 110
usual service participants (29.1%), for an adjusted odds ratio
of0.70(95%CI,0.37-1.32).Duringthefinalmonthofthefollow-
up, 6 of 102 PSE participants (5.9%) met criteria for MDE com-
pared with 12 of 110 usual service participants (10.9%), for an
adjusted odds ratio of 0.43 (95% CI, 0.15-1.25).

Discussion
The PSE intervention substantially reduced the rate of symp-
tomatic person-time during a full calendar year, particularly
for those with low symptom burdens at baseline. Among this
subgroup, PSE also produced lower time-averaged depres-
sive symptom scores, following a pattern that suggested early
and sustained improvement in symptoms. These differences
in depressive symptoms have clear implications for partici-
pants’overall quality of life.30-32
Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of
problem-solvinginterventionsintreatingandpreventingadult
depression.8,33-35 Participants in these trials, however, have
rarely represented the US demographic groups with the poor-
est access to conventional treatment services. Few such pre-
vention programs, furthermore, have harnessed the infra-
structure of community-based organizations to serve as
intervention delivery systems. For young, low-income moth-
ers, embedding efficacious mental health programs into ac-
cessible, community-based structures is a potentially impor-
tant public health strategy with implications for both parents
and children.2
One notable finding in our study was the PSE interven-
tion’
s optimal performance among mothers with lower base-
line symptoms. This pattern of results is consistent with PSE’
s
design as a prevention intervention, and we offer 2 explana-
tions for this finding. First, as a stand-alone intervention, PSE
may not be intense enough to break through clinically signifi-
cant symptoms to produce its effect. Second, because PSE was
designed as a preventive model, we intentionally uncoupled
the problems that participants were asked to solve from feel-
ings of sadness, and we emphasized behavioral activation over
cognitive restructuring. In theory, this approach could have
worked better among a subpopulation without the intrinsic
deactivation associated with a higher depressive symptom
burden.
Limitations
Our study has limitations. Although PSE providers had edu-
cational levels and cultural backgrounds similar to those of
Head Start caseworkers, the providers were paid study per-
sonnel. Although such an efficacy design was necessary to en-
suresafetyandproofofprinciple,additionaleffectivenesstest-
ing is necessary. Second, whether our principal outcome
(elevationsindepressivesymptoms,measuredbimonthly)was
a metric equally robust as a diagnostic measure of MDE ad-
ministered at the end of the follow-up period is debatable. We
believed that the former represented a more granular analy-
sis of the intensity and chronicity of symptoms, which may
be the primary mechanisms by which maternal depression
affects children.36 We thus powered our trial on symptomatic

 person-time and considered MDE as an exploratory measure,
differences in which our trial was not powered to detect. Last,
although the positive results on depressive symptoms pro-
duced by a problem-solving intervention in the absence of dif-
ferences in problem-solving abilities may appear to be curi-
ous, such a finding is not new.8,37 These findings highlight the
need to conduct additional research into potential interven-
tion mechanisms.
Conclusions
Our study contributes to the literature on the role of problem
solving as a viable depression prevention strategy across di-
verse populations and settings. Additional effectiveness stud-
ies,specificallyintheHeadStartsetting,arenecessarytotrans-
late our results into meaningful public health programs.
