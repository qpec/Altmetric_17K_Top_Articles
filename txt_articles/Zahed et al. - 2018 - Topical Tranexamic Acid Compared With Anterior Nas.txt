Topical Tranexamic Acid Compared
With Anterior Nasal Packing for
Treatment of Epistaxis in Patients
Taking Antiplatelet Drugs:
Randomized Controlled Trial

ABSTRACT
Objective: We evaluated the efficacy of topical application of the injectable form of tranexamic acid (TXA)
compared with anterior nasal packing (ANP) for the treatment of epistaxis in patients taking antiplatelet drugs
(aspirin, clopidogrel, or both) who presented to the emergency department (ED).
Methods: A randomized, parallel-group clinical trial was conducted at two EDs. A total of 124 participants were
randomized to receive topical TXA (500 mg in 5 mL) or ANP, 62 patients per group. The primary outcome was
the proportion of patients in each group whose bleeding had stopped at 10 minutes. Secondary outcomes were
the rebleeding rate at 24 hours and 1 week, ED length of stay (LOS), and patient satisfaction.
Results: Within 10 minutes of treatment, bleeding was stopped in 73% of the patients in the TXA group,
compared with 29% in the ANP group (difference = 44%, 95% confidence interval, 26% to 57%; p < 0.001).
Additionally, rebleeding was reported in 5 and 10% of patients during the first 24 hours in the TXA and the ANP
groups, respectively. At 1 week, 5% of patients in the TXA group and 21% of patients in the ANP group had
experienced recurrent bleeding (p = 0.007). Patients in the TXA group reported higher satisfaction scores (median
[interquartile range {IQR}], 9 [8–9.25]) compared with the ANP group (median [IQR] = 4 [3–5]; p < 0.001).
Discharge from the ED in <2 hours was achieved in 97% of patients in the TXA group versus 13% in the ANP
group (p < 0.001). There were no adverse events reported in either group.
Conclusions: In our study population, epistaxis treatment with topical application of TXA resulted in faster
bleeding cessation, less rebleeding at 1 week, shorter ED LOS, and higher patient satisfaction compared with
ANP.

 E
pistaxis is a common complaint in the emergency
department (ED).1 About 60% of population
experience epistaxis at least once during their lifetime
and 6% require medical attention.2 The cause of
epistaxis is unknown in the majority of cases. Etio-
logic factors can be divided into local and systemic
causes.3 Of all systemic factors, the use of anticoagu-
lants and antiplatelet drugs appear to have a signifi-
cant
correlation
with
more
severe
and
recurrent
epistaxis.4
Antiplatelet medications, specifically aspirin and
clopidogrel, are widely prescribed for treatment or pre-
ventions of various forms of cardiovascular disease.3
While there is no significant difference in the risk of
epistaxis in patients taking aspirin or clopidogrel,5
epistaxis management is more difficult in patients
taking antiplatelet drugs.4
Anterior nasal packing (ANP), a frequently per-
formed procedure in the management of epistaxis, has
potential complications, including discomfort during
placing and removing the pack and rebleeding follow-
ing removal owing to mucosal injury and synechia for-
mation.6 As such, more optimal treatment strategies
are needed for the management of epistaxis, especially
for patients taking antiplatelet drugs.
The efficacy of topical application of the injectable
form of tranexamic acid (TXA) has been shown bene-
ficial for the treatment of idiopathic anterior epistaxis.7
Additionally, topical use of TXA during oral,8 pul-
monary,9 sinus,10,11 and adenoidectomy12 procedures
results in significantly less mucosal bleeding. In this
study, we compared the effect of topical TXA with
ANP for treatment of anterior epistaxis in patients
taking antiplatelet drugs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Setting
A randomized, parallel-group clinical trial study was
conducted at two EDs and designed to compare treat-
ment efficacy of topical use of the injectable form of
10% TXA (500 mg in 5 mL) with that of ANP for
treatment of epistaxis in patients taking antiplatelet
drugs (aspirin, clopidogrel, or both). To ensure a stan-
dardized approach to epistaxis management at the two
study sites, PGY2 and PGY3 emergency medicine resi-
dent physicians participated in a 2-hour workshop on
ANP and topical TXA administration. Patient recruit-
ment commenced in October 2015 and finished in
April 2016.
Population
Patients were enrolled in the EDs of the two large gen-
eral academic teaching hospitals of Tehran University
of Medical Sciences, one with 510 beds and 40,800
annual ED visits and the other with 540 beds and
43,200 annual ED visits. Both centers have residency
programs in multiple specialties. Home to 8.7 million
people, Tehran is Iran’s capital and most populous
city.13,14
Subjects were eligible for inclusion if they presented
to the ED with an acute, new or recurrent, ongoing
anterior epistaxis and were currently taking antiplatelet
drugs (aspirin, clopidogrel, or both). In the absence of
a universally accepted grading system for the severity
of epistaxis, save that for hereditary hemorrhagic
telangiectasia, we included patients with persistent
bleeding requiring further treatment after 20 minutes
of compression of both nostrils with the patient’s
thumb and index finger.15 We excluded those with
traumatic epistaxis, current anticoagulant drug use,
inherited bleeding disorders (including hemophilia),
inherited platelet disorders, international normalize
ratio > 1.5, shock, a visible bleeding vessel, a history
of renal disease, and lack of consent. Our institution’s
ethics review committee approved the study and it was
registered at IRCT.Ir (IRCT201509088872N9). Writ-
ten informed consent was obtained from all patients
prior to entry into the trial.
Study Protocol
Eligible patients were randomly allocated to either the
TXA group or the ANP group. Our research nurse
used IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 24
(IBM
Corp)
to
generate
the
random
allocation
sequence, which was stratified by center. Randomiza-
tion was done in blocks of two, four, and six. To
implement the random allocation process, the research
nurse randomized the consecutively numbered boxes
filled with medication and cotton pledgets in a loca-
tion removed from the ED and inaccessible to the ED
personnel. Each box was identical in size, shape, and
weight. The numbered boxes were held in the ED
pharmacy and delivered sequentially to resident physi-
cians treating patients with epistaxis who were enrolled
in the study. Due to differences in the numbers of
pledgets required for ANP compared with topical TXA
and in the consistency, color, and smell of the medica-
tions used for soaking and impregnating the pledgets,
our patients and physicians were not blinded. How-
ever, our analysts were not the same investigators who
262
Zahed et al. • TOPICAL TXA FOR EPISTAXIS TREATMENT IN ANTIPLATELET USERS
 performed the treatment procedures and they analyzed
the data set blinded to group assignment.
The TXA group received a 15-cm piece of cotton
pledget that had been soaked in the injectable form of
TXA (500 mg in 5 mL) and inserted into the affected
nostril. It was removed after the attending physician or
a chief resident examined the oropharynx and blood-
soaked pledgets to confirm that the bleeding had
stopped. The ANP group received a cotton pledget
that had been soaked in epinephrine (1:100,000) +
lidocaine (2%) inserted into the affected nostril and
left in place for 10 minutes. ANP was subsequently
performed with several cotton pledgets covered with
tetracycline ointment. The packs were left in situ for 3
days before removal. If the allocated treatment failed,
we considered ANP and cautery (if indicated) and cau-
tery alone for the TXA group and the ANP group,
respectively.
Measurements
Assessment for ongoing bleeding was performed at 5-
minute intervals and when the patient left the ED.
The timed assessments began at the completion of
packing with the ointment-impregnated pledgets in the
ANP group and following the insertion of the TXA
soaked pledget in the TXA group. Emergency medi-
cine resident physicians performed follow-up assess-
ments by telephone or in person to document any
rebleeding or adverse events at 24 hours and 1 week.
Our research nurse evaluated satisfaction rate on a
numerical rating scale at the time of ED discharge.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the proportion of patients
in each group whose bleeding had stopped at 10 min-
utes. Secondary outcomes were: 1) frequency of epis-
taxis
recurrence
at
24
hours
and
7
days
after
treatment, 2) ED length of stay (LOS), and 3) patient
satisfaction on a 0–10 numeric rating scale, with a
higher score indicating greater satisfaction.
Data Analysis
Our sample size calculation was based on the results of
a previous study of ANP for the treatment of epistaxis in
which approximately 30% of patients had bleeding ces-
sation in ≤10 min.7 We considered a minimum clini-
cally important difference of 25% (i.e., 55% bleeding
cessation at 10 minutes) necessary to make the topical
use of the injectable form of TXA preferable to ANP.
We calculated that a sample size of 57 per group would
give 80% power to detect this difference with an alpha
of 0.05. We increased the sample size by 10% in each
group to account for patients lost to follow-up, giving a
final sample size of 62 per group.
Statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS
Statistics for Windows, version 24 (IBM Corp). The
chi-square test was used to compare the primary and
secondary
efficacy
variables
between
two
groups.
Because of their skewed distribution Mann-Whitney
U-test was used for comparison of satisfaction rate and
median time to stop bleeding between two groups and
results are expressed as median and interquartile range
(IQR). The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the dif-
ferences in proportions were calculated using VassarS-
tats, an online calculator accessible at http://vassarsta
ts.net/prop2_ind.html. Baseline characteristic compar-
isons between the two groups were done using the
independent sample t-test and chi-square test for con-
tinuous and categorical variables, respectively. We con-
sidered two-sided p-values < 0.05 to be statistically
significant.
RESULTS
Characteristics of Study Subjects
A total of 384 patients were assessed for eligibility,
260 patients were excluded, and 124 subjects (69 men
and 55 women) were enrolled in this randomized clin-
ical trial (Figure 1). A total of 124 eligible patients
were randomized and included in the intention-to-treat
analysis: 62 in the TXA group and 62 in the ANP
group. The patients were followed for 7 days. Baseline
characteristics of each group are shown in Table 1.
Except for prior epistaxis history, which was signifi-
cantly higher in the TXA group, the baseline variables
were comparable between the two groups.
Main Results
The outcomes of each treatment are summarized in
Table 2. Bleeding stopped within 10 minutes in 45
(73%) of 62 patients in the TXA, compared with 18
(29%) of 62 patients in the ANP (percent difference =
44%; 95% CI = 26% to 57%; p < 0.001). The med-
ian time to bleeding cessation in the TXA group (10
minutes; IQR = 10–15 minutes) was significantly
lower than the ANP group (15 minutes; IQR = 10–
20 minutes; p < 0.001).
Rebleeding at 24 hours was documented in three
(5%) of 62 patients in the TXA group and six (10%)
of
62
patients
in
the
ANP
group
(p = 0.299).

 Rebleeding at 1 week was documented in three (5%) of
62 patients in the TXA group and 13 (21%) of 62
patients in the ANP group (percent difference = –16%;
95% CI = –28% to –4%; p = 0.007).
ED LOS was shorter for patients in the TXA
group, with 60 (97%) of 62 patients discharged within
2 hours compared with eight (13%) of 62 patients in
the ANP group (percent difference = 84%; 95% CI =
71% to 91%; p < 0.001). Patient satisfaction was sig-
nificantly greater in the TXA group (median = 9;
IQR =
8–9.25)
compared
with
the
ANP
group
(median = 4; IQR = 3–5; p < 0.001).
No serious adverse events were detected during the
study. There was no statistically significant difference
in the incidence of complications (nausea/vomiting
and treatment intolerance) between two groups.
DISCUSSION
The World Health Organization lists TXA as an
essential medication.16 It is an antifibrinolytic drug
and a synthetic derivative of the amino acid lysine that
reduces plasmin concentration by blocking the lysine-
binding sites of plasminogen, which in turn inhibits

 the binding of plasminogen to fibrin and then

the complement system may interfere with platelet
function18 and reduce platelet adhesion and aggrega-
tion.19
Multiple routes of TXA administration, including
oral, intravenous, and topically have been studied for
various types of bleeding, including epistaxis.7,8,20–22
In one study, patients with hereditary hemorrhagic
telangiectasia who took daily oral TXA had a signifi-
cant decrease in the duration of epistaxis each month
compared with those taking placebo.23 Topical TXA
has also demonstrated success in achieving hemostasis
and improving the surgical field in endoscopic sinus
surgery10 and has been shown to decrease postopera-
tive hemorrhage after adenoidectomy.12
Sindet-Pedersen24 showed that mouth rinse with 10
mL of a 5% aqueous TXA solution achieved very high
salivary drug levels and low plasma levels compared
with oral administration of 1 g of the drug. These data
suggest that topical administration of TXA can be ben-
eficial in arresting local hemorrhage without producing
significant systemic antifibrinolysis effects. Further-
more, the topical hemostatic effect of TXA has been
shown in the treatment of gingival bleeding in hemo-
philic patients20 and in pulmonary hemorrhage from
various etiologies.9
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
trial investigating the effects of TXA for treatment of
epistaxis in patients taking antiplatelet drugs. We
found the topical application of the injectable formu-
lation of TXA to be more effective than ANP with
tetracycline-impregnated
pledgets,
with
73%
of
patients in the former group achieving bleeding ces-
sation within 10 minutes compared with 29% in
the latter group.
Moreover, the rate of recurrent bleeding during the
first week after treatment among patients in the TXA
group was significantly lower than in the ANP group.
ED LOS was significantly decreased in the TXA
group. This is consistent with findings from a prior
study by our group that examined topical TXA treat-
ment of idiopathic epistaxis.7 As such, adoption of
this treatment strategy may improve patient flow
through the ED at centers where ANP is commonly
employed in the treatment of epistaxis.
Patient satisfaction was also greater in the TXA
group. Treatments that are more comfortable for
patients and simpler for physicians to perform are
more pleasant and more likely to be integrated into
clinical practice. This simplicity and convenience has
been demonstrated in our prior work7 and that of
Tibbelin et al.25 in a study of tranexamic gel for the
treatment of epistaxis.
Topical use of the injectable form of TXA seems
to provide a better treatment option for anterior
epistaxis compared with ANP in patients taking anti-
platelet drugs. The advantages of topical TXA treat-
ment demonstrated in our study population include
quicker hemostasis, shorter ED LOS, lower recur-
rence rate, and increased patient satisfaction. The
technique is also relatively simple and is easy to
teach and learn.
LIMITATIONS
This study has several limitations. One key limitation
is that patients with posterior epistaxis were not
included in this trial and so we cannot comment on
the
role
of
TXA
in
the
management
of
these
patients. Another limitation is that the physicians
and patients were not blinded to treatment allocation.
Moreover, we did not stratify treatment assignment
by the specific antiplatelet drug the patient was taking
and so we cannot make any conclusions about the
relative benefit of the study treatment on the basis of
either antiplatelet agent or a combination of the
agents. Also, in the absence of consensus on an epis-
taxis severity grading system, save that for patients
with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, we chose
to include those patients with persistent bleeding after
20 minutes of manual compression of both nostrils.
While we feel that this is reasonable, clinically rele-
vant population, it is possible that there was an
imbalance of epistaxis severity among the groups that
could have favored the TXA treatment. However, the
only imbalance documented among the treatment
groups was a higher proportion of patients with a
history of epistaxis in the TXA group compared with
the ANP group. Since a history of epistaxis may be a
marker for more severe epistaxis (as noted in the
Epistaxis Severity Score for Hereditary Hemorrhagic
Telangiectasia) it is possible our findings may actually
underestimate the beneficial effects of TXA compared
to ANP. Finally, although there are commercially
available nasal sponges, tampons, and balloon tam-
ponade devices that are designed for epistaxis treat-
ment, we did not compare them in this trial and so
cannot comment on their relative efficacy or tolerabil-
ity as compared with TXA.

 CONCLUSION
In our study population of patients taking antiplatelet
drugs who presented to the ED with epistaxis, those
randomized to topical application of tranexamic acid
demonstrated faster bleeding cessation, less rebleeding
at 1week, shorter ED length of stay, and higher
patient satisfaction than those treated with anterior
nasal packing.
