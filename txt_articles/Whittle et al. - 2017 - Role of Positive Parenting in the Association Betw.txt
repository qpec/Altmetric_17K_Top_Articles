IMPORTANCE The negative effects of socioeconomic disadvantage on lifelong functioning are
pronounced, with some evidence suggesting that these effects are mediated by changes in
brain development. To our knowledge, no research has investigated whether parenting might
buffer these negative effects.
OBJECTIVE To establish whether positive parenting behaviors moderate the effects of
socioeconomic disadvantage on brain development and adaptive functioning in adolescents.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this longitudinal study of adolescents from schools in
Melbourne, Australia, data were collected at 3 assessments between 2004 and 2012. Data
were analyzed between August 2016 and April 2017.
EXPOSURES Both family (parental income-to-needs, occupation, and education level) and
neighborhood measures of socioeconomic disadvantage were assessed. Positive maternal
parenting behaviors were observed during interactions in early adolescence.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Structural magnetic resonance imaging scans at 3 times
(early, middle, and late adolescence) from ages 11 to 20 years. Global and academic
functioning was assessed during late adolescence. We used linear mixed models to examine
the effect of family and neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage as well as the moderating
effect of positive parenting on adolescent brain development. We used mediation models to
examine whether brain developmental trajectories predicted functional outcomes during late
adolescence.
RESULTS Of the included 166 adolescents, 86 (51.8%) were male. We found that
neighborhood, but not family, socioeconomic disadvantage was associated with altered brain
development from early (mean [SD] age, 12.79 [0.425] years) to late (mean [SD] age, 19.08
[0.460] years) adolescence, predominantly in the temporal lobes (temporal cortex: random
field theory corrected; left amygdala: B, −0.237; P < .001; right amygdala: B, −0.209;
P = .008). Additionally, positive parenting moderated the effects of neighborhood
disadvantage on the development of dorsal frontal and lateral orbitofrontal cortices as well as
the effects of family disadvantage on the development of the amygdala (occupation: B, 0.382;
P = .004; income-to-needs: B, 27.741; P = .004), with some male-specific findings. The pattern
of dorsal frontal cortical development in males from disadvantaged neighborhoods exposed to
low maternal positivity predicted increased rates of school noncompletion (indirect effect,
−0.018; SE, 0.01; 95% CI, −0.053 to −0.001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our findings highlight the importance of neighborhood
disadvantage in influencing brain developmental trajectories. Further, to our knowledge, we
present the first evidence that positive maternal parenting might ameliorate the negative
effects of socioeconomic disadvantage on frontal lobe development (with implications for
functioning) during adolescence. Results have relevance for designing interventions for
children from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds.

 T
he effects of socioeconomic disadvantage on lifelong
functioning are pronounced, with negative effects
thought to begin in childhood or adolescence.1 A num-
ber of studies have sought to identify neurobiological factors
that may mediate these effects and have documented asso-
ciations between socioeconomic disadvantage (particularly
poverty)andbrainstructure,withwidespreadalterationsiden-
tified in the subcortex and frontal, parietal, and temporal
cortices.1
Numerous processes might affect the association be-
tween socioeconomic disadvantage and neurobiology. Socio-
economic disadvantage may affect parenting quality and, in
turn, child brain development.2 Alternatively, caregiving be-
haviors may serve to protect children from the effects of dis-
advantageous experiences.3 Little is known about the buffer-
ing effects of caregivers on neurobiology in adolescence, a
critical period of development that sets the stage for func-
tioning across the lifespan.4 Also, the effect of socioeconomic
disadvantage on structural brain development across adoles-
cence has received little attention (eAppendix in the Supple-
ment), and to our knowledge, no research has investigated
whether positive parenting buffers these effects. Given the
large numbers of children affected by socioeconomic
disadvantage,1 such investigations are crucial for identifying
modifiable targets for intervention.
The primary aim of this study was to investigate the po-
tential buffering role of positive parenting on the effects of so-
cioeconomic disadvantage on adolescent brain develop-
ment. Our previous work5 demonstrated that positive parental
behavior protects against psychopathology and promotes cog-
nitive function and optimal brain developmental trajecto-
ries. We hypothesized that positive parenting would moder-
ate the effects of socioeconomic disadvantage on brain
development and that these brain developmental trajecto-
ries would, in turn, be associated with aspects of adolescent
functioning relevant to trajectories of health and well-being.6
Despite evidence that family-level vs neighborhood-
level socioeconomic measures have different effects on neu-
robiology and other outcomes in adults,7 to our knowledge,
no previous studies in adolescents have investigated their dif-
ferential effects. A secondary aim of this study was to assess
the neurodevelopmental effects of family (parental income-
to-needs, occupation, and education level) and neighbor-
hood socioeconomic disadvantage. Finally, given evidence
that environmental factors may have sex-specific effects on
brain development,8 we investigated sex differences in all
analyses.
Methods
Participants and Recruitment
The sample was derived from a larger Australian longitudinal
cohort of 2453 adolescents.9 Briefly, 177 adolescents from the
general community in Melbourne, Australia, completed mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at 1 to 3 times (at aver-
age ages of 13, 17, and 19 years). At the baseline assessment,
adolescentsalsoparticipatedinmother-childinteractiontasks.
Based on visual inspection of processed MRI data, 9 partici-
pants were excluded owing to poor MRI image quality and par-
cellation. In addition, 2 participants with full-scale IQ scores
lower than 70 were excluded from analyses. Following exclu-
sions, 166 participants aged 11 to 20 years were available for
analysis. Of these, 73 participants (44.0%) had 3 scans, 55
(33.1%) had 2 scans, and 38 (22.9%) had 1 scan (Table). The re-
search was approved by the human research ethics commit-
tee at The University of Melbourne, and written informed con-
sent was obtained from each child and a parent/guardian.
Socioeconomic Disadvantage
Fourmeasuresofsocioeconomicdisadvantagewereused.First,
parental occupation status was assessed based on the Austra-
lian National University Four scale,10 which draws on na-
tional census data (compulsory for all Australian households)
and classifies occupations by skill level and occupation type.
Second, parental education level was also assessed using the
Australian National University Four scale. Note that for
2-parent families, the highest ranked occupation and educa-
tion level was used. Third, income-to-needs was measured
based on reported family income relative to the relevant Aus-
tralian poverty line for household size. Finally, we measured
neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage based on the
2006 Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas Index of Relative
Socioeconomic Disadvantage, a region-based socioeconomic
index that summarizes a range of information from national
census data about the economic and social conditions of
people and households within small geographical areas (ap-
proximately 250 homes). Percentiles were used for analyses,
and high-percentile scores indicate relatively greater neigh-
borhood disadvantage (eMethods 1 and eTable 1 in the
Supplement).
Family Interaction Assessment and Measures
Adolescents and mothers completed laboratory-based inter-
actions at the first assessment. Mother-adolescent dyads com-
pleted two 20-minute interaction tasks that were video re-
corded for subsequent coding. An event-planning interaction
was completed first, followed by a problem-solving interac-
tion (PSI). The Living in Family Environments coding system
wasusedtocodeverbalandnonverbalmaternalbehaviorfrom
Key Points
Question Does positive parenting buffer the effects of
neighborhood-level and family-level socioeconomic disadvantage
on adolescent brain development?
Findings In this longitudinal study of 166 adolescents, positive
parenting moderated the effect of socioeconomic disadvantage on
the development of the amygdala and prefrontal cortex.
Prefrontal cortex development was in turn associated with school
completion.
Meaning While socioeconomic disadvantage has established
negative mental health and other outcomes, the family
environment may serve to mitigate some of these effects via
effects on the developing brain.

 the video-recorded interactions. A positive behavior con-
struct was developed that included all behaviors with happy
or caring affect, as well as approving, validating, affection-
ate, or humorous comments made with neutral affect. Mea-
sures of frequency of maternal positive behavior during the
PSI and event-planning interaction were used separately in
analyses (eMethods 2 in the Supplement).
MRI Acquisition and Processing
Note that different scanners were used at the first (Signa Ho-
rizon LX Human; General Electric Company) vs second and
third (MAGNETOM Trio, A Tim System; Siemens) imaging
times. An interscanner reliability assessment showed no in-
terscanner bias (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Cortical
reconstruction was performed using the longitudinal stream
of FreeSurfer version 5.3.11 Cortical thickness values were
automatically quantified within FreeSurfer on a vertex-wise
basis. Subcortical volumes were estimated using an auto-
mated subcortical segmentation procedure (eMethods 3 in
the Supplement).
Outcome Measures
The Children’
s Global Assessment Scale12 was administered
via interview during late adolescence to assess current global
functioning (eMethods 4 in the Supplement). During late
adolescence, information was also collected pertaining to
academic functioning via interview, including 12th grade
completion and Australian Tertiary Admission Rank scores (a
percentile ranking of high school graduates’final assessment
performance).
Statistical Analysis
For cortical thickness, vertex-wise analyses were conducted
using SurfStat, a statistical toolbox for MATLAB (http://www
.math.mcgill.ca/keith/surfstat/). Linear mixed models were
used to assess associations between socioeconomic
disadvantage measures and cortical thickness development
with age. Mixed-effects models permit the use of all available
data in unbalanced data sets, thus improving the statistical
power to detect effects.13 For each vertex of the cortical
reconstruction, we fitted full analytic models to investigate the
interaction between socioeconomic disadvantage and age.
Subsequent analysis investigated whether there were sex
differences in the interactive effect of social disadvantage and
age on cortical thickness (eMethods 5 in the Supplement).
Although estimated full-scale IQ (assessed at baseline using a
short form of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children14)
was associated with indices of social disadvantage, it was not
included as a covariate in analyses owing to methodological
and theoretical issues with doing so.15 Cortical analyses were
correctedformultiplecomparisonsatawhole-brainlevelusing
a random field theory at 0.01 (to account for the 4 types of
disadvantage) and a cluster-forming vertex-wise threshold of
P < .001.
For subcortical volumes (left and right amygdala, hippo-
campus, caudate, putamen, pallidum, thalamus, and
nucleus accumbens), analyses were conducted in R version
3.3.1 (The R Foundation), and results were considered sig-
nificant at P < .01 (corrected for multiple comparisons [14
regions × 4 disadvantage variables] using a false discovery
rate).16 Similar linear mixed models as described for cortical

els used for each region.
Moderating Effect of Positive Maternal Behavior
For each vertex of the cortical reconstruction and each sub-
cortical region of interest, we fitted full analytic (linear-
mixed) models to investigate the interaction between socio-
economic disadvantage, positive maternal behavior, and age.
Separate models were run for positive behavior during the PSI
and event-planning interaction. Subsequent analysis investi-
gatedpossiblesexdifferences.Analyseswerecorrectedformul-
tiple comparisons.
All models were run with mean-centered variables. For all
models yielding significant results, models were rerun con-
trolling for the other socioeconomic disadvantage variables
(and their interactions with age, sex, and maternal positive be-
havior where relevant).
Outcomes
For any brain regions where development was predicted by so-
cioeconomic disadvantage or its interaction with positive par-
enting, mediation or moderated mediation analyses were used
to test whether brain development in turn predicted late ado-
lescent outcomes (Children’
s Global Assessment Scale score,
school completion, and Australian Tertiary Admission Rank
score). A bootstrapping method was used to test the signifi-
cance of indirect (mediation) effects. Five thousand resa-
mples were taken, and 95% CIs were used. Significant media-
tion is indicated if the CIs do not contain zero.
Results
Demographic characteristics are shown in the Table. Associa-
tions between demographic and other variables of interest are
shown in eTable 2 in the Supplement.

 neighborhood disadvantage and right amygdala develop-
ment (B, 0.455; SE, 0.154; P = .005). Follow-up analyses
showed that this effect (found for the whole sample) was sig-
nificant in males (B, −0.457; SE, 0.122; P < .001) but not fe-
males (P > .01) (Figure 2). Note that controlling for family
disadvantage (and its interaction with age and sex) did not
change results.
Moderating Effect of Positive Maternal Behavior
on Association Between Disadvantage and
Brain Development
Parental Education, Occupation, and Income-to-Needs
Positive maternal behavior during the PSI moderated the ef-
fect of parental occupation on development of the left amyg-
dala (B, 0.382; SE, 0.132; P = .004). In adolescents with par-
entswithrelativelylow-statusoccupations(B,−7.631;SE,3.738;
P = .04), higher (relative to lower) levels of positive maternal
behavior were associated with attenuated left amygdala
growth. In adolescents with parents with high-status occupa-
tions (B, 7.948; SE, 3.919; P = .05), higher (relative to lower)
levels of positive maternal behavior were associated with
accelerated left amygdala growth (Figure 3). Positive mater-
nal behavior during the PSI also moderated the effect of
parental income-to-needs on development of the right amyg-
dala in a sex-dependent manner (B, 27.741; SE, 9.544;
P = .004). Separate analyses by sex showed that the effect
was significant in males (B, −21.685; SE, 8.484; P = .01) but
not females (B, 6.208; SE, 4.920; P = .21). In boys with rela-
tively low income-to-needs, higher (relative to lower) levels of
positive maternal behavior were associated with relatively
increased amygdala volume longitudinally (Figure 3). Note
that controlling for neighborhood disadvantage (and its inter-
action with age and positive maternal behavior) did not
change results.
Neighborhood Disadvantage
There were significant sex differences in the association be-
tween maternal positive behavior during the PSI and its mod-
erating effect in attenuating the effect of neighborhood dis-
advantage on brain development. Specifically, this was
associated with development of thickness in the right lateral
orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) and dorsal frontal cortex, regions
forwhichwehavepreviouslyreportednormativethinninglon-
gitudinally (Figure 4).17 Similar effects were found for mater-
nal positive behavior during the event-planning interaction
(eFigure 6 in the Supplement). Note that controlling for fam-
ily disadvantage (and its interaction with age, sex, and posi-
tive maternal behavior) did not change results. There were no
effects for subcortical volumes.
After extracting average thickness from the right lOFC and
dorsal frontal clusters, follow-up analyses showed that ef-
fects were significant in males (lOFC: B, 0.001; SE, 0.0004;
P = .005;dorsalfrontal:B,0.001;SE,0.0004;P = .002)butnot
females (lOFC: B, −0.0005; SE, 0.0003; P = .08; dorsal fron-
tal: B, −0.0007; SE, 0.0004; P = .07). In males, for both lOFC
and dorsal frontal cortex, the effect of positive maternal be-
havior was more pronounced in those with higher levels of
neighborhood disadvantage (lOFC: B, −0.032; SE, 0.014;
P = .03; dorsal frontal: B, −0.046; SE, 0.012; P < .001) com-
pared with those with lower levels of neighborhood disadvan-
tage (lOFC: B, 0.013; SE, 0.012; P = .22; dorsal frontal: B, 0.028;
SE, 0.013; P = .03) (Figure 3). Specifically, positive maternal be-
havior was associated with greater relative thinning with age
in male adolescents within the context of higher neighbor-
hood disadvantage (such that trajectories more closely re-
sembled those with low levels of disadvantage).

 Predicting Late Adolescent Outcomes
A moderated mediation model run in males indicated that de-
velopment of the right dorsal frontal cortex significantly me-
diated the association between neighborhood disadvantage,
positive maternal behavior during the PSI, and school non-
completion (Figure 3C and Figure 4). Specifically, in adoles-
centmaleswithrelativelyhighsocialdisadvantageandlowposi-
tive maternal parenting, change in cortical thickness with age
was associated with school noncompletion (indirect effect for
low maternal positive behavior, −0.018; SE, 0.014; 95% CI,
−0.053 to −0.001). No other brain development trajectories as-
sociatedwithsocioeconomicdisadvantageoritsinteractionwith

Discussion
In this longitudinal study of adolescents aged 11 to 20 years,
wefoundthatneighborhoodbutnotfamilysocioeconomicdis-
advantage was associated with brain development, predomi-
nantly in the temporal lobes. Further, positive parenting mod-
eratedtheeffectsofsocioeconomicdisadvantageonadolescent
development of the amygdala and frontal cortex, particularly
in males. In the context of relatively high socioeconomic dis-
advantage, positive parenting predicted developmental tra-
jectories of the dorsal frontal and lateral orbitofrontal corti-
ces and amygdala that resembled those in adolescents with
lowerlevelsofsocioeconomicdisadvantage.Thepatternofdor-
sal frontal cortical development in adolescent males with high
social disadvantage and low maternal positivity, which was
characterized by reduced cortical thinning, in turn predicted
increased rates of school noncompletion.
Neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage was found to
have more prominent effects on brain cortical development
than did family indicators of disadvantage. This is consistent
withsomeresearchthathasfoundassociationsbetweenneigh-
borhood socioeconomic disadvantage and cognitive out-
comes independent of family indices of disadvantage.7
High neighborhood disadvantage was also associated with
relatively increased volume of the amygdala with age and in-
creased thickening of the temporal cortex with age, including
the middle and inferior temporal gyri and parahippocampal
and fusiform gyri. These temporal lobe findings are consis-
tent with previous reports linking socioeconomic disadvan-
tage and brain structure in children and adolescents19,20 (in-
cluding, to our knowledge, the only other study to date to
investigate the association between socioeconomic disadvan-
tage and cortical thickness development21) and with other re-
search showing early stress to affect temporal lobe structure.22
Wehavepreviouslyreported17normativethickeningofthetem-
poral cortex in this sample; while consistent with some
research,18 this finding is at odds with much research show-
ing normative temporal lobe thinning across adolescence.23-25
Given the current inconsistencies in the literature and the
fact that the development of these temporal regions was not
associated with late adolescent outcomes in our analyses, the

 functional significance of our findings are unclear. Neverthe-
less,giventheknownfunctionsofthesebrainregions,26,27find-
ings suggest that relatively high neighborhood disadvantage
may affect responsivity to stress/threat processing, memory,
and/or language. Indeed, localized findings within the tem-
poral lobe are consistent with reports linking socioeconomic
disadvantage to functions ascribed to these brain regions. So-
cioeconomicdisadvantagehasbeenassociatedwithpoorerlan-
guage development, believed to result from reduced environ-
mental exposure to language.28 Thus, our findings identify a
plausible neural mechanism that could partially explain the
enduring nature of the effects of socioeconomic disadvan-
tage on stress responsivity, language deficits, and other tem-
poral lobe–mediated functions.
While other research suggests that socioeconomic disad-
vantage may exert its effects on brain development via par-
enting behavior,2 we found that socioeconomic disadvantage
was not associated with our measure of positive parenting but
rather that positive maternal parenting had a moderating ef-
fectontheassociationbetweenfamilydisadvantageandamyg-
dala development and a buffering effect on the effect of neigh-
borhooddisadvantageoncorticaldevelopmentinmales.While
amygdala trajectories did not predict any of the functional out-
comesexaminedinthisstudy,priorworksuggeststhatthepat-
tern of amygdala development observed here in adolescents
with relatively high occupational disadvantage and low lev-
els of maternal positive behavior (ie, increased volume with
age) may be associated with emotion dysregulation.29 The pat-
tern was reversed in males in relation to income-to-needs.
Regarding our parenting findings, the frontal cortical re-
gions implicated continue to show maturational change dur-
ing adolescence (normative thinning across this age period
is a consistent finding both in our work17 and in other
samples23-25)andareimportantforemotionprocessingandex-
ecutive functioning.30 Much research supports a negative ef-
fect of socioeconomic disadvantage on executive functions31
and on emotion regulation processes.32 Our findings suggest
that positive parenting practices might protect male children
who have grown up in relatively socioeconomically disadvan-
taged neighborhoods from experiencing such environmen-
tally related neural changes. The results of mediation analy-
ses supported an interpretation of accelerated frontal cortical
thinningasbeingoneneuralmechanismbywhichpositivepar-
enting may buffer the effects of high neighborhood disadvan-
tage on poor functional outcomes (eg, school noncomple-
tion). Of note, we and others have found accelerated cortical
thinning during adolescence to be associated with more adap-
tive individual characteristics33 and have suggested that ac-
celerated cortical thinning may be due to dynamic synaptic re-
organization and/or continued intracortical myelination.17
It is unclear why some of our findings were male-
specific. One possibility is that the male frontal cortex may be
more susceptible to positive environmental influence during
adolescence owing to its relative immaturity compared with
females.17 Further, given evidence that deficits in frontal lobe–
mediated executive functions are associated with behavioral
problems, which is in turn associated with school dropout in
males,34 it is possible that our findings reflect a sociobiologi-
cal pathway specific to males.
Limitations
Our study had limitations, including single assessments of par-
enting and socioeconomic disadvantage measures, our inabil-
ity to assess effects earlier than adolescence, and the use of 2
MRI scanners.
Conclusions
Despite the limitations of this work, to our knowledge, this
study presents the first evidence that positive parenting prac-
tices might buffer the negative effects of socioeconomic dis-
advantage on brain development and specific aspects of adap-
tivefunctioningduringadolescence.Ourfindingsalsohighlight
the importance of disadvantage at the neighborhood level in
influencingbraindevelopmenttrajectories.Importantly,inthis
study, socioeconomic disadvantage was not associated with
our measures of positive parenting. As such, we have identi-
fied a type of parenting behavior that is not intrinsically tied
to disadvantage and thus represents a modifiable target for in-
tervention to scaffold optimal brain development within the
context of socioeconomic disadvantage.
