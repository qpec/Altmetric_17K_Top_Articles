 Background—Given the rapid increase in e-cigarette (EC) popularity and paucity of 
longitudinal health-related data associated with this, there is an urgent need to assess the potential 
risks of long-term EC use.
Objective—To compare exposure to nicotine, tobacco-related carcinogens and toxicants among 
cigarette-only smokers, and smokers and ex-smokers with long-term EC use or with use of 
nicotine replacement therapy (NRT; a product with known safety profile).
Design—Cross-sectional study.
Setting—United Kingdom.
Participants—Five groups were purposively recruited: (1) cigarette-only users, (2) ex-smokers 
with long-term (≥6 months) EC-only or (3) NRT-only use, and (4) long-term dual cigarette-EC or 
(5) dual cigarette-NRT users (N=36-37 per group, total N=181).
Measurements—Socio-demographic and smoking characteristics were assessed; participants 
provided urine and saliva samples, analysed for biomarkers of nicotine, tobacco-specific 
nitrosamines (TSNAs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
Results—After controlling for confounders, there were no clear group differences in salivary or 
urinary biomarkers of nicotine intake. EC-only and NRT-only users had significantly lower 
metabolite levels for TSNAs (including the carcinogenic metabolite 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-
pyridyl)-1-butanol, NNAL) and for VOCs (including metabolites of the toxicants acrolein, 
acrylamide, acrylonitrile, 1,3-butadiene, ethylene oxide) compared with cigarette-only, dual 
cigarette-EC or cigarette-NRT users. EC-only users had significantly lower NNAL levels than all 
other groups. Cigarette-only, dual cigarette-NRT and cigarette-EC users had largely similar levels 
of TSNA and VOC metabolites.
Limitations—Cross-sectional design with self-selected sample.
Conclusions—Ex-smokers with long-term EC-only or NRT-only use may achieve 
approximately similar nicotine intake to cigarette-only smokers but results were variable. Long-
term NRT-only and EC-only use, but not dual use with cigarettes, is associated with substantially 
reduced levels of measured carcinogens and toxicants relative to cigarette-only smoking.
Primary source of funding—Cancer Research UK (C27061/A16929).

Introduction
E-cigarettes (EC) are increasingly popular devices (1) that produce an aerosol by heating a 
solvent (e-liquid) usually containing nicotine through a battery-powered heating element. 
Unlike smoked tobacco, nicotine can therefore be delivered to the respiratory tract without 
combustion (2). Despite this possible advantage, health concerns about EC remain regarding 
potential cytotoxicity, delivery of carcinogens (3), including carbonyls (4, 5), tobacco-
specific N-nitrosamines (TSNAs, (6)) and heavy metals (4), effects on cardiovascular and

 respiratory function and inflammation (7) and nicotine delivery (8). Data on the effects of 
long-term EC use are needed to assess their risks and potential effectiveness accurately and 
to inform health professionals encountering EC users (9).
To date, most studies have looked at toxicant concentrations in EC liquids or aerosol (e.g. (4, 
6)) using cell-line or animal models (e.g. (7)). However, this may not provide accurate 
information as user characteristics, together with device characteristics and their interaction, 
determine actual body-level exposure, and thus potential health consequences (10). Three 
studies that have assessed body-level exposure found lower levels for carcinogens, including 
TSNAs, in recent ex-smokers using EC compared with a historic sample of smokers (11), 
and reductions in toxicants over a two- or four-week period in smokers switching to EC with 
or without concurrent smoking (12, 13). However, none of the studies involved long-term 
users, which is important given observed learning effects in EC use (14) (15), or included 
real-world control groups to reduce the risk of confounding when interpreting results of 
observational studies.
Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) users would be an appropriate control. Dual use with 
cigarettes of either EC or NRT is common, and there is some long-term use of both (16, 17). 
Both have been advocated as harm reduction products used to reduce risks associated with 
combustible tobacco use (18). However, unlike EC, the NRT safety profile is well 
established (e.g. (19)) and NRT effectiveness for smoking cessation through intial partial 
(20) or complete substitution (21) has been demonstrated. NRT is therefore recommended as 
a harm reduction strategy in several countries (22).
While longitudinal cohort studies and randomised controlled trials will provide the best data 
to answer questions concerning the safety and efficacy for smoking cessation of EC use, 
these designs are time- and resource-intensive. In the absence of long-term data, a more 
pragmatic approach is to compare smokers and ex-smokers as a function of EC use in real 
life settings. This study aimed to address the gap in the existing literature by measuring 
biomarker levels in long-term users of EC compared with an appropriate control, NRT users. 
Specifically, this study assessed whether long-term EC-only, NRT-only, dual cigarette-EC or 
dual cigarette-NRT use is associated with differences in metabolites of a) nicotine; b) 
TSNAs and c) volatile organic compounds (VOC) compared with cigarette-only smokers.
Methods
Study design and procedure
This cross-sectional study, carried out in January–June 2014 in London, UK sought to 
evaluate the range of toxicant levels measured in smokers and ex-smokers with or without 
concurrent long-term use of EC or NRT. The study methodology has been described 
elsewhere (23). Briefly, participants visited the laboratory for a single session, lasting 30 
minutes, after abstaining from eating, drinking or using cigarettes or nicotine products an 
hour before their visit to standardise assessment. At the laboratory, after providing written 
consent, participants completed a short questionnaire assessing socio-demographic, smoking 
and product use characteristics and provided breath, saliva and urine samples. Expired air 
was assessed for carbon monoxide (CO) with a breathalyser (Micro IV Smokerlyzer, 
Shahab et al.

 Bedfont Scientific, Kent, England). In addition, two saliva samples were collected with 
sterile dental rolls (Salivette®, Sarstedt Ltd, Leicester, England) which participants were 
asked to gently chew for about two minutes or until saturated. Urine was collected in a 
sealable, sterilised cup by participants on site and transferred by staff into cryovials. Urine 
and saliva samples were then kept frozen at -20°C until shipment in dry ice for analysis to 
laboratories at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) and the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC). All participants were reimbursed for time and travel (£25). 
The study was approved by the University College London Ethics Committee (Project ID 
0483/002).
Participants
Participants were purposively recruited in the greater London area using a variety of 
methods to increase sample diversity, including newspapers and online adverts, posters in 
pharmacies, and the use of marketing companies. Participants had to be ever smokers and 
were eligible to take part if they fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: current smokers 
had to smoke an average of five or more cigarettes per day for at least six months, and ex-
smokers had to have stopped using tobacco products (including cigarettes, waterpipe, cigars, 
smokeless products such as snus or chewing tobacco) for at least six months. Because this 
study sought to evaluate the impact of long-term use of non-combustible nicotine delivery 
devices (NRT and EC), smokers (i.e. dual cigarette-EC or cigarette-NRT users) and ex-
smokers (i.e. EC-only or NRT-only users) had to have been using these products at least 
weekly for six or more months (users of nicotine-free products, e.g. using e-liquid without 
nicotine, were excluded). In practice, however, participants used products daily as indicated 
by latency to last product use across groups (Cigarettes-only: 1.4h; Dual cigarette-NRT: 
4.3h; Dual cigarette-EC: 1.3h; NRT-only: 24h; EC-only: 5.4h). Product use was verified by 
asking participants to bring in the NRT or EC that they were currently using, and smoking 
status was verified with CO readings (10 ppm cut-off (24)). Participants who used both NRT 
and EC were excluded as were those below 18 years of age, pregnant or with a history of 
heart or lung disease or bleeding gums, illness, or an active infection within 24 hours of their 
scheduled appointment.
Measures
Biomarkers of exposure—Level of nicotine exposure was determined to assess 
effectiveness of nicotine-delivery products using two different methodologies. Saliva 
samples were analysed for nicotine, and its major metabolite cotinine, using established gas 
chromatography methodology (25, 26). Urine samples were analysed for main nicotine 
metabolites to derive total nicotine equivalents and for minor tobacco alkaloids using 
validated tandem mass spectrometry methodology (27, 28).
Levels of urinary TSNA and VOC metabolites were determined using liquid 
chromatography atmospheric pressure ionization tandem mass spectrometry (29) and ultra-
high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionisation and tandem 
mass spectrometry (30), respectively, to assess the potential risk of nicotine-delivery 
products. While a comprehensive battery of metabolites was assessed (see Table S1), we 
focus here on well-established metabolites of compounds that are known to contribute

 significantly to smoking-related toxicological and carcinogenic risks (31–39) (see Table 1). 
All analyses of urinary and salivary biomarkers were carried out by the CDC and RPCI, 
respectively.
Covariates—Socio-demographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity, education, marital 
status) were assessed in addition to self-reported recently resolved physical illness (chest 
infection, cold/flu, sore throat, fever), subjective well-being (happiness and satisfaction, both 
assessed with established single item measures (40)) and C-reactive protein (CRP) as a 
marker of inflammation (and thus potential health problems), measured in saliva and 
analysed with the ELISA method by Salimetrics Europe Ltd, UK (41). Smoking 
characteristics assessed included current and past daily cigarette consumption as a measure 
of dependence for smokers and ex-smokers, respectively, age at which participants had 
started smoking and the proportion of family or friends who smoke to gauge environmental 
tobacco smoke exposure.
Analysis
As this was a cross-sectional study, exposure biomarkers including metabolites of known 
tobacco-related carcinogens and toxicants were used as proxies for future disease risk. 
Previous research on the association of the carcinogenic metabolite 4-
(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) with lung cancer suggests that 
medium-large reductions in NNAL levels (Cohen’s f=0.25-0.40) would result in an 
appreciable reduction in risk (42) and could thus be considered clinically meaningful in 
magnitude and warrant further investigation (43). A priori power calculation showed that 
180 participants (36 per group) would provide 90% power to detect between-group 
differences of a medium effect size (Cohen’s f=0.3) in NNAL levels when comparing five 
groups, using analysis of variance (44). However, this calculation did not account for 
multiple outcomes being tested, and based on 35 biomarker outcomes reported here, power 
to detect such an effect size across all biomarkers would have been reduced to 54%. The 
sample size therefore only provided sufficient power (≥80%) to detect effects at the upper 
range of the estimate (Cohen’s f≥ 0.36) when accounting for multiple comparisons.
Analyses were conducted with SPSS Version 22.0. In initial analysis of group differences on 
covariates, one-way ANOVAs were used for continuous and chi-square analysis for 
categorical covariates, respectively. Prior to the main analysis, urinary metabolites were 
standardised algebraically to account for individual differences in urine concentration by 
dividing metabolite data by the ratio of observed to age-, sex-, and ethnicity-adjusted 
creatinine values and creatinine (measured by standard colorimetric method at RCPI) was 
also included as covariate in analysis (see Method 7 in 45). Due to non-normal distribution 
of data, generalised linear models with a log link and gamma distribution were used to 
assess group differences in outcome measures, adjusted for all covariates and latency to 
product use. B coefficients were exponentiated to obtain percent change in biomarker levels 
in all groups compared with cigarette-only smokers. For pre-specified tests of main effects 
of group, Type I errors were controlled using the false discovery rate (46) separately for 
socio-demographic comparisons (N=13) and biomarker comparisons (N=35). Where overall 
omnibus effects were considered significant, the Sidak correction was used in post-hoc

 analysis to determine between which (if any) groups differences persisted. Biomarker values 
below the limit of detection (LOD) were imputed using standard methodology (LOD divided 
by square root of 2 (47)), and biomarkers with 50% or more of values below the LOD were 
not analysed.

Results
Overall, participants were relatively young, mainly male, white, had at least a high school 
education, and about half were single (see Table 2). On average, participants had started 
smoking in their late teens, smoking nearly one pack a day, with a substantial proportion 
(16%-51%) of their family or friends smoking. Salivary CRP levels were within the range 
observed for healthy adults (0.05-64.3 μg/L) (48) and reported well-being levels comparable 
to that of representative population samples (40). There were some group differences: the 
proportion of females varied from 19.4% in EC-only users to 61.1% in dual cigarette-NRT 
users, fewer EC-only users were female; NRT-only users had started smoking the latest and 
EC-only users had the lowest proportion of family or friends who smoke. There was also 
considerable variation between groups in terms of ethnicity, marital status, cigarette 
consumption, recent illness and reported happiness levels (Table 2).
As previously reported, length of product use was broadly similar across group at around 17 
months, and mean daily NRT and EC use, measured by self-reported nicotine dose, was 
higher for NRT-only and EC-only users than for dual cigarette-NRT and cigarette-EC users 
(see (23) for details). In terms of the product type used, first generation ‘cig-a-likes’ with 
replaceable or disposable cartridges were most popular among dual cigarette-EC users 
(60.0%) and third/fourth generation advanced personal vaporisers most popular among EC-
only users (47.2 %), with refillable pen-style, second generation EC equally popular among

 dual cigarette-EC (31.4%) and EC-only (36.1%) users. For both dual cigarette-NRT and 
NRT-only users, gum (44.4% and 33.3%, respectively) and patches (both 33.3%) were the 
most popular products, and a similar proportion (27.8%) used more than one NRT product.
a) Nicotine levels
Nicotine intake from different products was roughly comparable (Figure 1), although there 
was some variation across groups (Table S1). In terms of urinary biomarkers, users of all 
products had levels of total nicotine equivalents at least as high as cigarette-only smokers in 
adjusted analysis (see Table 3). Findings in relation to salivary biomarkers varied. Dual 
cigarette-NRT users had relatively low nicotine and cotinine levels and EC-only users had 
relatively low nicotine levels, at around half that of cigarette-only users, with other groups 
obtaining levels slightly below or above those from cigarette-only users (Table 3). The minor 
tobacco alkaloids anabasine and anatabine which are specific to tobacco as opposed to 
nicotine exposure, clearly distinguished between smokers and ex-smokers, with significantly 
lower levels compared with cigarette-only, dual cigarette-NRT or cigarette-EC users (Table 
S1).
b) TSNA levels
There were clear differences in levels of the carcinogen metabolite NNAL (Figure 2). NRT-
only and EC-only users had markedly lower levels than cigarette-only, dual cigarette-NRT 
and cigarette-EC users (p<0.001), with EC-only users having significantly lower levels than 
all other groups, at less than 3% of cigarette-only smoker levels (Table 3). Compared with 
cigarette-only smokers, there were no large differences in NNAL levels for dual cigarette-
EC users but dual cigarette-NRT users had somewhat lower levels. Results followed a 
similar, albeit less pronounced, pattern for the other TSNAs measured (Table S1).
c) VOC levels
EC-only users had the lowest overall levels of the major urinary VOC metabolites, with 
acrylonitrile levels as low as 2.9% of cigarette-only smokers, and NRT-only users had the 
second lowest overall, with acrylonitrile levels as low as 10.5% of cigarette-only smokers 
(Table 3). By contrast, dual cigarette-NRT, cigarette-EC and cigarette-only users all had very 
similar VOC metabolite levels (Figure 2). Compared with all other groups, NRT-only and 
EC-only users at least halved the reference values of cigarette-only smokers (see Table 3), 
and had significantly lower levels of all major metabolites of selected toxicant and 
carcinogen VOCs (all p<0.001, Table S1).
Results were largely confirmed when looking at other VOC metabolites that were assessed, 
with EC-only users generally displaying the lowest levels, followed by NRT-only users and 
no detectable differences between dual cigarette-NRT, cigarette-EC and cigarette-only users 
(see Table S1). The only exceptions were metabolites of benzene (N-Acetyl-S-(phenyl)-L-
cysteine (PMA) and muconic acid (MU)), carbon disulphide (2-thioxothiazolidine-4-
carboxylic acid (TTCA)) and styrene (N-Acetyl-S-(1 and 2-phenyl-2-hydroxyethyl)-L-
cysteine (PHEMA) and phenylglyoxylic acid (PGA)). Dual cigarette-EC users had 
somewhat higher PMA, MU and PHEMA levels and dual cigarette-NRT and dual cigarette-
EC users had somewhat higher PGA levels than other groups (Table S1). There were no

 appreciable group differences in TTCA levels. However, these metabolites were either non-
specific to the parent VOC measured (MU, TTCA have dietary contributions, PGA is a 
metabolite of ethylbenzene and styrene exposure) or had low detection rates (PMA and 
PHEMA; see Table S2).
Discussion
This is, to our knowledge, the first direct comparison of nicotine, important carcinogen and 
toxicant metabolite levels in long-term users of EC or NRT. We find that ex- smokers who 
had switched to exclusive EC or NRT use obtained roughly similar levels of nicotine 
compared with cigarette-only smokers, but results were variable. Exclusive use of NRT, and 
in particular of EC, but not dual use with cigarettes, was associated with lower levels of 
known tobacco-related carcinogens and toxicants measured in this study compared with 
cigarette-only use.
The finding that NRT-only or EC-only use is associated with roughly similar nicotine intake 
to cigarette-only use supports the view that users seek a particular level of nicotine intake, 
irrespective of the delivery system (49), and adjust product use accordingly (50). The finding 
is consistent with more recent (51) but not older (8) studies on nicotine delivery from EC 
and may reflect the improved design of newer generations of EC products (52), highlighting 
the importance of focusing on experienced, long-term rather than naïve, short-term users. 
Similarly, efficient nicotine intake from exclusive NRT use has been observed in long-term 
(53) but not short and intermediate-term NRT users (54). The fact that intake was largely 
similar for both groups also suggests that better craving reductions observed in users of EC 
compared with NRT (23, 55) may be due to factors other than nicotine delivery, such as the 
greater behavioural similarity of EC use (as opposed to NRT use) with smoking. This is 
consistent with research on non-nicotine sensory factors that have been shown to influence 
tobacco withdrawal (56). However, it should be noted that this study was not powered to 
detect anything other than relatively large effects, so results are indeterminate regarding 
smaller differences in nicotine intake between these groups.
The lower carcinogen and toxicant levels associated with NRT-only and EC-only use in this 
study confirm the known low risk for long-term NRT product use (57). They also underscore 
the translation of greatly reduced concentrations of some carcinogens and toxicants from e-
liquids and aerosol (4, 6, 58) to body-level exposure, contrary to worries that long-term EC 
use would result in substantial harmful exposure (59). Given the involvement of these 
TSNAs and VOCs with cancer, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases (e.g. 42, 60), these 
results suggest that complete substitution may result in reducing disease risk and supports 
the assertion that EC use may to be less harmful than smoking (2, 61–63). In this study, 
there was no evidence that long-term EC-only use is associated with greater carcinogen or 
toxicant levels than NRT-only use; if anything, on some measures it was associated with 
lower levels. While this could be due to occasional cigarette smoking lapses by long-term 
NRT-only users, this is unlikely to have made a substantial contribution given very low 
levels of tobacco-specific (as opposed to nicotine-specific) biomarkers for acrylonitrile, 
anabasine and anatabine (64, 65) in this group. Alternatively, these differences may reflect 
typical low-level contamination in these products (e.g. with nitrosamines from tobacco-

 derived nicotine (66)), non-specificity of the metabolite for the toxicant (e.g. muconic acid 
for benzene (67)), or non-smoking related environmental sources of toxicant exposure (e.g. 
for styrene (68)). Contrary to findings from a recent short-term switching study (12), dual 
cigarette-NRT or cigarette-EC use was not associated with appreciable reductions in 
carcinogen and toxicant levels. This may be because participants in the current study may 
have been even heavier smokers prior to starting concurrent EC or NRT use, thus masking 
the benefit of potential partial substitution in our cross-sectional study, or because dual users 
used non-combustible products to bridge times of non-smoking and thus did not actually 
reduce their cigarettes consumption. Alternatively, it may reflect either differences in study 
design, e.g. different usage pattern in long-term as opposed to short-term users, or the 
relatively low power to detect smaller, yet meaningful, effects in this study. Further 
longitudinal research is needed to differentiate between these explanations.
The findings have several implications. While complete long-term switching to EC may 
produce a net benefit for the health outcomes of the smoking population, given the 
association with very low levels of dangerous constituents measured in this study similar in 
magnitude to NRT, it is only likely to be beneficial if complete cessation of cigarettes is 
achieved. Thus, dual users should be encouraged to cease using combustible products to 
reduce long-term health risks. Our results also indicate that machine-derived and actual 
body-level exposure to toxicants can be very different as shown, for instance, by greatly 
reduced aldehyde levels in EC users here compared with reportedly high levels in EC 
aerosol under certain laboratory conditions ((5) but see (69)). Lastly, it should be noted that 
while exclusive EC and NRT use was associated with marked reductions in carcinogen and 
toxicant levels compared with cigarette-only smokers, it did not eliminate exposure (and 
thus possible health risks) completely. Full cessation of all nicotine products remains the 
best option to avoid harm.
The study had several limitations. Even though participants were recruited using diverse 
methods, resulting in a sample broadly similar to the population of NRT/EC users (16, 70), 
and we controlled for important confounders, group differences may not generalise and 
reflect self-selection. The sample was too small to allow more sophisticated analyses to 
evaluate the association of different types of EC or NRT (and other characteristics such as 
EC flavourings) with intake, and we may not have picked up small but important differences 
in exposure levels. In particular, the lack of group differences in nicotine intake has to be 
interpreted cautiously given the low power to detect smaller effects and the variability across 
different urinary and salivary measures. Lastly, we did not assess indirect exposure and the 
analysis was limited by the number of biomarkers available and spot sampling, which can 
only provide a snapshot of exposure. However, given the lack of long-term data, we chose 
this pragmatic design to evaluate quickly potentially important associations of EC use with 
carcinogen and toxicant intake to inform further longitudinal work. Moreover, the relatively 
slow pharmacokinetics of the assessed metabolites (71) provides stable estimates of recent 
exposure and should militate against variations associated with different usage patterns of 
different products. Future work should attempt to sample a larger range of biomarkers over a 
longer period of time, including biomarkers of actual harm such as lung function measures, 
and evaluate the impact of potential interactions of user with device characteristics on 
delivery of toxicants to users and bystanders.

 In conclusion, exclusive long-term NRT or EC use among ex-smokers is associated with 
substantially reduced levels of select carcinogens and toxicants compared with cigarette 
smoking; however, concurrent use with cigarettes appears not to be. We found no evidence 
that EC-only compared with NRT-only use is associated with greater carcinogen and 
toxicant levels measured in this study. Nicotine delivery, though variable, is roughly
