BACKGROUND: To better inform clinical practice, this study was aimed at capturing patients’ motivations for enrolling in phase 1 trials
and at quantifying their expectations of the benefits, risks, and commitment associated with clinical trials and the impact of the initial
consultation on their expectations. METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective, quantitative study of newly referred adult
patients considering their first phase 1 oncology trial. Participants completed questionnaires before they were seen and an abbreviat-
ed follow-up version after their consultation. RESULTS: Questionnaires were completed by 396 (99%) and 301 (76%) before and after
the clinic, respectively. Participants ranked the possibility of tumor shrinkage (84%) as the most important motivation for considering
a phase 1 trial; this was followed by no alternative treatments (56%), their physician’s recommendation (44%), and the fact that the
research might benefit others (38%). When they were asked about the potential personal benefit, 43% predicted tumor shrinkage ini-
tially. After the consultation, this increased to 47%. Fourteen percent of patients expected a cure. When asked about risks, 71% of the
participants expected moderate side effects. When asked about expectations of time commitments, a majority of patients did not an-
ticipate weekly visits, although this was understood by 93% of patients after the consultation. Overall, patients were keen to consider
trials and when asked before and after the consultation 72% and 84% were willing to enroll in studies, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
This study reports that more than 80% of patients enroll in early-phase clinical oncology trials motivated by the potential of a clinical
benefit, with approximately half expecting tumor shrinkage and approximately a tenth anticipating a cure. The typical phase 1 response
rate is 4% to 20%, and this discrepancy exemplifies the challenges faced by patients and healthcare professionals during their interac-
tions for phase 1 studies. Cancer 2016;122:3501-8. V

INTRODUCTION
Phase 1 trials are designed to recommend the dose and schedule for a novel anticancer drug, with the toxicity as well as the
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile taken into account. These first-in-human studies often start at conserva-
tively low doses of the new drug and escalate the dose until a recommended phase 2 dose is established. Thus, patients in
phase 1 trials can receive subtherapeutic doses with little realistic chance of efficacy or an excessively high drug dose with a
risk of serious toxicity. Several studies over the past 20 years have quantified typical response rates of phase 1 trials as 4%
to 20% with a median overall survival of 6 months.1-3
First-in-human oncology drug trials are normally restricted to patients with advanced malignant disease refractory to
standard therapy because of the narrow therapeutic indices of anticancer drugs. This is a unique group of patients who
have usually received several lines of previous treatments, have a short life expectancy,4 and have few remaining conven-
tional treatment options. Entry into a phase 1 study requires the judgment of the relative likelihood of benefit versus

 toxicity and is essentially an individual patient’s deci-
sion.5,6 This encompasses a patient’s motivations, expect-
ations, and ability to comprehend the complexities of
clinical trial research.7,8 Ethically, healthcare professionals
must ensure that patients are well informed about the like-
lihood of risks and benefits, have a good understanding of
the trial, and know the alternatives to study participation
to aid the decision-making process.9-11
Research into patients’ perceptions has generally fo-
cused on participants who have already enrolled or who
are considering entry into early-phase clinical trials, that
is, after discussions have already taken place.8,12-15
Patients have demonstrated unrealistically high expecta-
tions of personal benefit or even a cure from these investi-
gational agents.15-17 Much of the research has attributed
these idealistic expectations to suboptimal patient-
physician communication and a patient-based culture of
needing to remain optimistic as treatment options
diminish.11,12,14,15,18
It is important to quantify how effective communi-
cation is with regard to these phase 1 discussions.11 This is
an iterative process over multiple appointments at which
trial-specific information sheets and consent forms are
discussed with patients and their families. However, com-
munication regarding the general concepts of phase 1
studies during the first outpatient visit is critical and influ-
ences whether patients proceed with the trial process. Cur-
rently, there is a paucity of quantitative research assessing
how patients’ preconceptions change before and after the
clinical consultation.15,19 Pre- and postconsultation ques-
tionnaires using a quantitative assessment of patient’s
expectations and perceptions would facilitate improved
communication by the clinical team. If specific groups
were found to have significantly different perceptions,
such information could be used to tailor discussions to
these groups.
To the best of our knowledge, no studies have previ-
ously assessed patients’ motivations and perceptions be-
fore they are seen by the clinical trial team in the setting of
phase 1 oncology studies. The aim of this study was to ex-
plore patients’ motivations for considering phase 1 trials
and to assess the different factors influencing their partici-
pation. This study also aimed to quantify patients’ expect-
ations before they were reviewed in clinic and whether
these changed immediately after the consultation. To
judge patient optimism, expectations on cure rates were
assessed only with the postconsultation questionnaire be-
cause this was felt to be too sensitive to be posed before
they met their oncologist.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Procedures and Measures
The Committee for Clinical Research of the Royal Mars-
den Hospital and the Institute of Cancer Research (CCR
no. 3745), along with the research ethics committee, ap-
proved the study and questionnaires.
This was a prospective, non-randomized, quantita-
tive study undertaken at the Phase 1 Drug Development
Unit of the Royal Marsden Hospital in Sutton, United
Kingdom. The study aims were 4-fold: 1) to capture
patients’ motivations for phase 1 clinical trials and assess
whether they were influenced by age, sex, education, or
cancer type; 2) to quantify baseline expectations of the
benefits, risks, and commitments associated with clinical
trials; 3) to assess how the consultation affected patients’
perceptions; and 4) to quantify the expectations of a can-
cer cure from these experimental trials.
Patient information sheets were sent with the appoint-
ment letter. After registration, patients wishing to partici-
pate signed the consent form. They completed a preclinic
questionnaire before they were reviewed by the clinical team
(Supporting Information 1 [see online supporting informa-
tion]). After the consultation, they completed their post-
clinic questionnaire (Supporting Information 2 [see online
supporting information]) in private.
Participants
Prospective patients who were attending the phase 1 trial
outpatient clinic for the first time were recruited. Eligible
patients were 18 years or older and were able to provide
informed written consent in English. The only exclusion
criterion was prior phase 1 trial participation. An a priori
sample size calculation was used. All new patients in the
clinic were invited to participate to prevent any selection
bias.
Questionnaires
A multidisciplinary team including medical oncologists,
nurses, clinical trial coordinators, and statisticians devised
the study questionnaires. These were refined after a small
pilot study and input from the Royal Marsden Patient Ad-
vocacy Group (Supporting Information 1 and 2 [see on-
line supporting information]).
The preconsultation questionnaire (Supporting In-
formation 1 [see online supporting information]) com-
prised 2 sections. Section 1 captured the baseline
demographics, referral route, and patient motivations for
phase 1 trials. Participants independently ranked motiva-
tion on a scale of 1 to 5 of how important 5 factors were to
their participation in the trial: 1) “shrink tumor,” 2) “no

 other treatment options available,” 3) “family wishes,” 4)
“research will benefit others,” and 5) their referring
“doctor recommended it.” Section 2 focused on expecta-
tions of the benefits, risks, and commitment associated
with phase 1 trials. The benefits included expectations of
a tumor response (shrinkage, no change, growth, or do
not know), and the risks included perceived side effects
(mild, moderate, or severe) and, if applicable, a compari-
son with chemotherapy (better, same, or worse). Other
factors included the commitment: the believed frequency
of hospital visits (weekly, monthly, or less than monthly)
and the willingness to participate in a phase 1 trial (yes,
no, or do not know).
The postconsultation questionnaire (Supporting In-
formation 2 [see online supporting information]) repeat-
ed section 2. In addition, a further sensitive question was
posed: “Do you expect your cancer will be cured on a
phase 1 trial?” All responses were anonymized, and data
were double-checked on entry into a database.
Statistical Considerations
All available data were used, and descriptive statistics were
used to summarize patient demographics, clinical charac-
teristics, and question responses. Cross-tabulations of the
before and after questionnaires used the Stuart-Maxwell
test statistic for marginal homogeneity. Univariate and
multivariate logistic regression analyses were undertaken
to explore whether age, sex, education level, and tumor
type
represented
independent
variables
influencing
patients’ perceptions of phase 1 clinical trials with respect
to benefits, risks, time commitment, and willingness to
participate. All patients with complete sets of data were in-
cluded in the multivariate models, which were adjusted
for the effects of all the variables without any prior selec-
tion. Analyses were conducted with Stata 13.1.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between September 2012 and March 2015, questionnaires
were given to 402 prospective adult patients at their first at-
tendance in the new patient phase 1 clinic of the Drug De-
velopment Unit. Ninety nine percent (n 5 396) gave
written consent to participate and completed the preclinic
questionnaire; 301 patients returned the postclinic ques-
tionnaire (76%). The mean age was 57.4 years (standard de-
viation, 12.9 years); there was a slight preponderance of
females (56.3%), and there was an even distribution of par-
ticipants leaving formal education before and after the age
of 17 years (46.2 vs 44.7%; Table 1). The commonest can-
cers were gastrointestinal, gynecological, and lung cancers,
with their respective cancer specialists being the major pri-
mary referrers for 87.1% of the patients (Table 1).

tant for entering a phase 1 trial are summarized in Table 2.

 that they could rank more than 1 question with the
same score. The most important motivation was shrink-
age of their tumor (83.5%), which was followed by no
alternative treatments (56.0%), their referring physi-
cian’s recommendation (44.2%), the benefit of research
to others (38.0%), and family wishes (24.4%).
Univariate
analyses
and
multivariate
analyses
(MVAs) were undertaken to determine the most impor-
tant reasons for entering a phase 1 trial according to age,
education, sex, and tumor type (Table 3 and Supporting
Information 3 [see online supporting information]). Gas-
trointestinal cancers, the largest group, were used as the
reference category in the cross-tumor comparisons. The
most statistically significant factors that affected patient
participation were related to age and education. Interest-
ingly, older patients (�59.5 years) were more dependent
on their referring physician’s recommendation (odds ratio
[OR] from MVA model, 1.98; 95% CI [confidence inter-
val], 1.19-3.30; P 5 .01) and the benefit of research (OR
from MVA model, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.15-3.18; P 5 .01).
Participants who left education before the age of 17 years
were more likely to deem tumor shrinkage (OR from
MVA model, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15-0.94; P 5 .04), a lack
of alternative treatments (OR from MVA model, 0.56;
95% CI, 0.32-0.98; P 5 .04), family wishes (OR from
MVA model, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.27-0.76; P < .001), and
the benefit of research (OR from MVA model, 0.51; 95%
CI, 0.31-0.83; P 5 .01) as the most important reasons for
considering an early-phase clinical trial. With the excep-
tion of “no other treatments available,” the cancer type

ORs greater than 1 indicate that older patients (�59.5 years), more educated patients (left formal education at an age � 17 years), females (vs males), and
patients with breast, gynecological, lung, or other tumors (vs gastrointestinal cancers) were more likely to rate high the listed reasons for considering an early-
phase clinical trial. NB, P values in bold are statistically significant (P < 0.05).

 was not significant in the remaining analyses. The re-
sponse “no other treatments available” was highly signifi-
cant
(P 5 .001),
and
this
meant
patients
with
gastrointestinal cancers were more likely to answer that
they were interested in phase 1 trials because there were
no alternatives. Within this subgroup (n 5 135), 83% of
the patients replied that this was the most important rea-
son; the OR within this group was 4.87 (95% CI, 3.11-
7.63; P < .001). There was a similar effect within the
“other” cancer group (n 5 71) with an OR of 5.45 (95%
CI, 2.87-10.37; P < .001).
Patients’ baseline expectations of the benefits,
risks, and commitment of phase 1 trials
The next analysis assessed what patients’ expectations
were of a phase 1 study before they were seen in the clinic
(Table 4).
Benefits. Among those patients with data (n 5 384), ap-
proximately 42.7% thought that their tumors would
shrink, whereas 51% stated that they did not know.
Risks. When the patients were asked to rate what kinds of
side effects there would be, the most common answer was
moderate (70.7%). When they were asked how these
would compare with chemotherapy, the commonest an-
swer was the same (60.9%) for those who had received
prior chemotherapy (n 5 286).
Commitment.
Approximately
half
of
the
patients
(49.7%) thought they would be seen weekly, with 45.0%
expecting once monthly visits. Notably, 71.5% of the
patients expected to enter a phase 1 study at this stage, and
27.9% marked “do not know” and were thus undecided
at this point.
Changes in patients’ perceptions after the clinic
consultation
The final analysis explored how patients’ understanding
of phase 1 trials changed after the detailed new patient
clinic discussion (Table 4).
Benefit. The expectation of tumor shrinkage increased in
the postclinic questionnaire to 46.8% from 42.7%.
Risks. The most frequent toxicity response was still
“moderate” (77.1% from 70.7%); however, this was not
significant (P 5 .16). There was a small but significant
change in the perception of how the treatment would

 compare with prior chemotherapy after the first consulta-
tion: 54.1% (vs 60.9%) thought it would be the same as
chemotherapy, and 32.8% (vs 24.9%) thought that it
would be better in comparison with the preclinic values
(P 5 .015).
Commitment. Perceptions about the number of hospital
visits changed significantly, with 93% (vs 49.7% at the
baseline) understanding that weekly visits were needed
(P < .001). Moreover, the percentage of patients wanting
to enter a phase 1 study increased to 84.3% from 71.5%,
and this was significant (P < .001).
Patients’ belief of a cancer cure
The final postconsultation question assessed patients’
expectations about their cancer being cured in a phase 1
trial (Table 4). Three hundred patients replied to this
question: 14.0% answered yes, 48.7% said no, and 37.3%
did not know. For those who believed that they might be
cured, the age distribution was similar; 33% and 67%
were male and female, respectively (P 5 .17); 57% and
43% left formal education at an age < 17 years and at an
age � 17 years, respectively (P 5 .89); and 88% and 22%
were referred by a cancer specialist and a nonspecialist, re-
spectively. None of these factors were statistically
significant.
DISCUSSION
The characteristics of the study participants reflect the
expected profile of patients attending the Drug Develop-
ment Unit for age and cancer type,4,20 with equal propor-
tions leaving education before and after the age of 17
years. As expected for our unit, a cancer specialist or a gen-
eral practitioner referred the majority of the patients.
The biggest motivators for our patients considering
early-stage clinical trials were the chance of tumor shrink-
age and the paucity of alternative treatments; these find-
ings were similar to those of a prior report.8 This
highlights the fact that patients view phase 1 studies as an
extension of previous conventional anticancer treat-
ment.17 Phase 1 candidates tend to have better physical
health and quality of life than those receiving best sup-
portive care, and this may reflect on the higher expecta-
tion of a therapeutic benefit, as seen previously.16 Their
referring physician’s recommendation was important to
half of participants, although older patients appeared to
place more emphasis on this. The wishes of family were
the least important factor in patients’ decisions to partici-
pate. Older patients and those who had left formal educa-
tion before the age of 17 years placed greater importance
on their family’s opinions. For the older group, this may
reflect more reliance on family for support and assistance
with
traveling
for
frequent
hospital
appointments.
Patients with gastrointestinal and “other” cancers were
more likely to reply that they were interested in phase 1
trials because no other treatments were available; this was
highly statistically significant. This could reflect that these
tumor types may have fewer standard lines of treatment
available in comparison with others such as breast and gy-
necological cancers.
Following from their motivations for considering
trials, several themes related to perceptions of benefit,
risks, and commitment were interesting. Patients had a
high expectation of benefit from a phase 1 trial, with 43%
believing that their tumor would shrink. This is more
than double the reported response rates1-3 and represents
a large discrepancy between expectations and what phase
1 trials offer. Although this is high for early clinical trials,
these patients had more realistic expectations than those
in a previous study in which 75% of patients expected a
personal clinical benefit greater than 50%.12 The im-
proved comprehension may reflect the current culture of
better patient education in comparison with the study
performed a decade ago. When considering risks, the
majority of patients predicted moderate side effects com-
parable to those of chemotherapy. With respect to com-
mitment, more than 70% of the patients expected to
participate in a study, in agreement with previously pub-
lished reports.17
When analyzing differences in perceptions after the
first consultation, we found some statistically significant
differences. Patient perceptions of benefits and risks
remained largely unchanged. There was a more realistic
perception of the time that patients would have to commit
after the consultation. This, however, did not deter
patients from considering a study, and paradoxically, a
larger percentage of patients wished to enter a study after
the consultation. Thus, our current first consultation in
the phase 1 unit does not significantly change expectations
but does clarify the understanding of the time commit-
ment involved. These results will be reviewed by our focus
groups to find ways to improve these discussions. It would
be interesting to repeat this study at a later time point to
assess how perceptions change after the receipt of treat-
ment within a study.
Given the late stage in their cancer journey, more
than half of the patients had not ruled out a cure; 14% be-
lieved that a cure was possible, and 37% were unsure.
This likely represents human hope and is similar to the
figures reported in 2 studies by Kass et al assessing phase 1

 candidates.15,17 It is tempting to interpret this as patient
misinterpretation of previous discussions with healthcare
professionals or a lack of information provided to patients
throughout their cancer journey and to conclude that as a
result we should inform our patients better.11 An alterna-
tive explanation is that this subset of patients, despite hav-
ing been exposed to this information, have chosen to
maintain unrealistic hope. The concept of therapeutic op-
timism has been reported before,8,14,17 and phase 1 physi-
cians have to walk a fine line between reiterating a
patient’s poor prognosis, which may be seen as patroniz-
ing, and not disregarding the importance of human
hope.10,11,14
Study limitations include the fact that only three-
quarters of the participants returned the postconsultation
questionnaire. We aimed to minimize unreturned ques-
tionnaires by asking for the postconsultation responses to
be completed in the clinic and thereby preventing loss or a
failure to return them. Therefore, the missing postconsul-
tation questionnaires (24%) likely represent patients who
were unsuitable for early-stage clinical trials because of an
inappropriate clinical condition such as a poor perfor-
mance status or deranged liver function. This cohort may
have been disappointed by the clinical discussion, and the
absence of their responses could have influenced the
results. Alternatively, a lack of responses from patients
who had decided against trial entry because of a lack of
perceived personal benefit may have biased the returned-
questionnaire group. A second drawback is that no vali-
dated questionnaires were used to measure relevant pa-
tient characteristics such as quality of life or anxiety and
depression scores. This would have been interesting to re-
cord, but when we were designing the study, we wanted a
brief questionnaire to gain a snapshot of patients’ percep-
tions and to maximize study participants’ uptake. This is
something that could be assessed in future studies. Lastly,
because the consultations were not recorded, our assump-
tion is that all information was shared with the patients at-
tending the new phase 1 clinic in an understandable way,
although recorded consultations in smaller studies have
shown omissions during such discussions.11 However,
without a content analysis of the consultations, we cannot
ensure that this was the case. Workshops to train and ap-
praise researchers consenting patients who are entering
phase 1 studies have been shown to improve communica-
tions skills.10
In conclusion, we found that more than 80% of
patients enrolling in early clinical oncology trials were
motivated by the prospect of a clinical benefit. Approxi-
mately half the patients anticipated tumor shrinkage, and
approximately a tenth still expected a cure. These rates
conflict with the typical phase 1 response rates of 4% to
20%, and this discrepancy demonstrates the challenges
facing patients and healthcare professionals during their
interactions in phase 1 studies.
