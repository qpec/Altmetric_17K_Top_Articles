Autism and epilepsy
A population-based nationwide cohort study
ABSTRACT
Objective: To investigate the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in individuals with epilepsy
and in their first-degree relatives to determine shared etiology.
Methods: Through the Swedish Patient Register, we identified 85,201 individuals with epilepsy,
as well as all their siblings (n 5 80,511) and offspring (n 5 98,534). Each individual with epilepsy
was compared with 5 controls, matched for age, sex, calendar period, and county, while siblings
and offspring were compared with siblings and offspring of controls. We excluded siblings and
offspring with epilepsy. Using Cox regression, we calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for future
diagnosis of ASD. Logistic regression was applied to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for prior diag-
nosis of ASD.
Results: During follow-up, 1,381 (1.6%) individuals with epilepsy and 700 (0.2%) controls
were diagnosed with ASD. Individuals with epilepsy were therefore at increased risk of future
ASD (HR 10.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 9.55–11.53), with the highest risk seen in
individuals diagnosed with epilepsy in childhood. Both siblings (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.43–
1.83) and offspring (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.46–1.84) of epilepsy patients were at increased risk
of ASD. The risk in the offspring was particularly high in mothers with epilepsy (HR 1.91; 95%
CI 1.63–2.23). Epilepsy was also associated with a prior diagnosis of ASD (OR 4.56, 95% CI
4.02–5.18).
Conclusions: Individuals with epilepsy are at increased risk of ASD, especially if epilepsy appears
in childhood. Further, ASD is more common in the siblings and offspring of individuals with epi-
lepsy, suggesting shared etiology. Neurology® 2016;87:192–197
GLOSSARY
ASD 5 autism spectrum disorder; CI 5 confidence interval; HR 5 hazard ratio; ICD 5 International Classification of Diseases;
OR 5 odds ratio.
According to the definition of the International League Against Epilepsy, “epilepsy is a disorder
of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the
neurobiologic, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition.”1 Epilepsy
frequently co-occurs with psychiatric disturbances, such as mood and anxiety disorders and
autism spectrum disorder (ASD).1
ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairment in social inter-
action and communication and restricted, repetitive, or stereotypic behavior, interests,
and activities.2
The strength and nature of the association between epilepsy and ASD have been scarce and
difficult to interpret. A US study of health care data, a British psychiatric morbidity survey, and
a prospective screening study all found that ASD as a comorbidity in patients with epilepsy had
a prevalence between 1.3% and 21% and an odds ratio (OR) between 6 and 22.3–5 Prevalence of
epilepsy in ASD has been studied in different large cohorts with results varying from 3.9% to
19.4%.6–9

 This study estimated the risk of ASD in indi-
viduals with epilepsy and their relatives in order
to explore common risk factors. We hypothe-
sized that individuals with epilepsy and their rel-
atives would be at increased risk of ASD.
METHODS We used the Swedish Patient Register10 to identify
all individuals with epilepsy, defined according to the Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases (ICD). Status epilepticus and
febrile convulsions were not included in our definition of epilepsy
(ICD-7: 353, except for 353.2; ICD-8: 345, except for 345.2;
ICD-9: 345, except for 345Q; ICD-10: G40). The Swedish
Patient Register includes inpatient diagnoses from parts of
Sweden since 1964 (nationwide since 1987) and hospital-based
outpatient care since 2001.10
We identified siblings, offspring, and parents of all patients
with epilepsy. For our analyses, we excluded all relatives and con-
trols with epilepsy. We analyzed relatives of patients with epilepsy
and relatives of patients with epilepsy but without ASD.
For each individual with epilepsy, we identified up to 5 con-
trols matched for age, sex, year of birth, and county of residence at
epilepsy diagnosis using the Swedish Total Population Register.11
For initial analyses, we excluded anyone with an ASD diagno-
sis prior to the diagnosis of epilepsy or corresponding date in
matched reference individuals (study entry). We estimated the
risk of ASD in the siblings and offspring of index individuals with
epilepsy and then the risk of ASD in the siblings and offspring of
index individuals with epilepsy but no ASD.
ASD was defined as having relevant ICD codes in the Swed-
ish National Patient Register since 1987 (when ICD-9 started in
Sweden): ICD-9: 299A, 299B, 299W, 299X; ICD-10: F84.0-
F84.5, F84.8, and F84.9.
Data on ASD were linked to epilepsy using the unique per-
sonal identity number11 assigned to all Swedish residents.
Follow-up started on the date of the epilepsy diagnosis (and
corresponding date in matched controls) and ended with ASD
diagnosis, death, or emigration, or on December 31, 2009,
whichever occurred first. For offspring, siblings, parents, and their
controls, the observation time started in 1987 or with their birth
and ended with a diagnosis of ASD, death, or emigration, or on
December 31, 2009.
In separate analyses we stratified for sex, age at first registered
diagnosis of epilepsy (0–19, 20–39, 40–59, and $60 years), and
calendar period (1986, 1987–1996, and 1997). Analyzing the
risk of ASD in the siblings and offspring of individuals with
epilepsy, we stratified for the same variables as in the separate
analyses but also for sex of the index person.
Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for
future ASD in individuals with epilepsy and in their first-degree
relatives. Our statistical model was internally stratified, i.e., an
individual with epilepsy was only compared with his or her age-
matched controls for ASD. The overall HR presented in this arti-
cle is a summary from risk estimates calculated for each stratum
(consisting of 1 index individual and up to 5 controls). To test
the proportional hazards assumptions, log-minus-log curves were
plotted.
In other separate analyses we also examined the association
between epilepsy and ASD when 2 diagnoses of both exposure
(epilepsy) and outcome measure (ASD) were required.
Using conditional logistic regression, we also examined the
risk of ASD prior to epilepsy.
Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software (ver-
sion 18; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Relative risks with 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs) that did not include 1.0 were regarded as
statistically significant.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The study was approved by the Regional Ethics
Committee, Stockholm, Sweden (protocol no. 2009/5:10),
which adjudicated that individual informed consent was
not required.12
RESULTS Initially, 86,916 individuals with epilepsy
and 434,580 matched controls were identified. After
exclusion of study participants with a prior diagnosis
of ASD, the final sample comprised 85,201 individu-
als with epilepsy and 425,760 controls (table 1).
The median follow-up between epilepsy (or study
entry in matched controls) and ASD diagnosis was
5.5 years (range 0–36.3 years) for individuals with
epilepsy and 6.1 years for controls (range 0–36.0
years). For individuals with epilepsy, the median
age at the first diagnosis of ASD was 13.6 years (range
0.6–73.6 years) and 17.5 years for controls (range
2.2–90.9 years).
During follow-up, 1,381 (1.6%) individuals with
epilepsy and 700 (0.2%) controls were diagnosed
with ASD (table 2). Thus, individuals with epilepsy
were at increased risk of future ASD (HR 10.49, 95%
CI 9.55–11.53). The risk of ASD was increased in
both male (HR 9.27, 95% CI 8.25–10.41) and
female patients with epilepsy (HR 13.10, 95% CI
11.15–15.39) (table 2). The difference in HRs
between male and female patients was statistically
significant (p value for interaction between epilepsy
and sex was ,0.001).
The risk of future ASD was especially high in individ-
uals diagnosed with epilepsy in childhood (aged ,20
years, table 2) (HR 11.39, 95% CI 10.26–12.64, p value
for interaction between epilepsy and age ,0.001).

 The risk of ASD was increased in all calendar pe-
riods, with the highest risk estimate among individu-
als diagnosed with epilepsy before 1986 (HR 15.76,
95% CI 11.75–21.14) (table e-1 on the Neurology®
Web site at Neurology.org).
Estimates tended to increase when the exposure
was restricted to $2 records of epilepsy and outcome
to $2 records of ASD (table e-1).
To examine the temporal relationship between epi-
lepsy and ASD, we studied the risk of ASD diagnosis
occurring before epilepsy. In this analysis, we also
found an increased occurrence of ASD prior to the epi-
lepsy diagnosis (OR 4.56, 95% CI 4.02–5.18).
The initial sample included 80,511 siblings and
98,534 offspring of individuals with epilepsy. When
we excluded relatives of epilepsy patients with ASD
and their controls and all relatives and controls with
a diagnosis of epilepsy, 77,895 siblings and 98,458
offspring remained. Initially, there were 104,121 pa-
rents of patients with epilepsy. Of these, 100,154
were parents of epilepsy patients without a diagnosis
of ASD.
ASD was more common in siblings of individuals
with epilepsy than in control siblings, with an excess
risk of some 50% (table 3). In siblings of individuals
with epilepsy (including those individuals with epi-
lepsy who had ASD), there was a 1.62-fold increased
risk of ASD (95% CI 1.43–1.83), decreasing to 1.34
when those siblings whose index individuals with epi-
lepsy also had an ASD diagnosis were excluded (95%
CI 1.16–1.55) (table 3).
The risk of ASD was similar in female and male
siblings (table e-2). No significant differences in
ASD risk were found based on the sex of the index
individual with epilepsy (table e-2).
Offspring of individuals with epilepsy, in compar-
ison with control offspring, were at increased risk of
ASD (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.46–1.84).
If the mother had epilepsy, the risk of ASD in the
offspring was slightly higher (HR 1.91, 95% CI
1.63–2.23) than if the father had epilepsy (HR
1.38, 95% CI 1.16–1.64) (table 3 and table e-3).
We analyzed the occurrence of ASD in parents of
individuals with epilepsy but restricted our data anal-
ysis to index individuals diagnosed with epilepsy from
1997 and onwards. We used this strategy since the
ASD diagnosis is only recorded since 1987 (start of
ICD-9 in Sweden). We found no increased risk of

 ASD in parents of individuals with epilepsy (HR
0.70, 95% CI 0.33–1.48), but ASD was very uncom-
mon in both index and control parents.
DISCUSSION This nationwide cohort study of more
than 85,000 individuals with epilepsy demonstrated
a 10-fold increased risk of future ASD, as well as an
increased future risk of ASD in first-degree relatives.
Of note, there was a bidirectional relationship
between epilepsy and ASD, i.e., individuals with
epilepsy were also at increased risk of having an
earlier ASD diagnosis (OR 4.56).
Our data on the risk of ASD in individuals with
epilepsy
are
consistent
with
earlier
studies,3–5
although previous risk estimates have varied substan-
tially. One American study based on hospital health
care data reported an OR of more than 22 for the
association between ASD and epilepsy.3 Two British
studies combined included 26 patients with both epi-
lepsy and ASD.4,5 Our risk estimates were based on
more than 1,300 patients with both epilepsy and
ASD. This large sample size yielded high statistical
power and narrower CIs (for instance, the 95% CI for
future ASD was between 9.55 and 11.53). The large
number of study participants also allowed for the
examination of specific strata.
We found a significantly higher risk of ASD in
women with epilepsy. ASD more often remains undi-
agnosed in female patients and we speculate that
a diagnosis of epilepsy increases the chances of undi-
agnosed ASD being detected. Other data suggest an
increased occurrence of epilepsy in female patients
with ASD compared with male patients with
ASD.6,9,13 This may be especially so in female patients
with comorbid intellectual disability.9 In the Amiet
et al.13 meta-analysis, the male:female ratio of autism
comorbidity with epilepsy was 2:1, whereas the male:
female ratio of autism without epilepsy was 3.5:1. We
had no information on intellectual disability.
The risk of future ASD was significantly increased
in childhood-onset epilepsy. Many types of childhood
epilepsy are part of broader neurodevelopmental dis-
orders that are known to be associated with neuropsy-
chiatric disorders such as ASD.14,15 Epilepsy with
onset later in life has etiologies (e.g., stroke and de-
mentias) different from childhood-onset epilepsy.
This might explain the lower relative risk of ASD in
older individuals with epilepsy.
Our study shows increased risks of ASD in both
the offspring and siblings of patients with epilepsy.
The risk of ASD in the offspring of female patients
with epilepsy was high (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.63–
2.23); in the offspring of male patients, the risk was
somewhat lower (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.16–1.64). The
high risk of ASD in the offspring of female patients
with epilepsy may be due to fetal exposure to
antiepileptic medication in utero. Studies have shown
that use of valproic acid during pregnancy is associ-
ated with increased risk of ASD in offspring.16,17
In contrast to our results, a Danish case-control
study reported that epilepsy was not more common
in parents of individuals with ASD than in control pa-
rents.18 In our study, parents of individuals with epi-
lepsy had no increased risk of ASD. However, the
absolute risk of ASD was low in the parental group
(independently of epilepsy in the index individual or
not), probably due to factors concerning general func-
tioning or the possibility to establish a family when an
individual has autism. A British study of 150 individ-
uals with autism found no increased risk of epilepsy,
but of a broader autism phenotype in their relatives,
suggesting that ASD of a genetic origin contributes to
an increased risk of epilepsy.19
Both epilepsy and ASD were identified through
diagnoses in the nationwide Swedish Patient Register,
a register that is almost complete for inpatient data
and that includes hospital-based outpatient data since
2001. Research suggests that the majority of individ-
uals with epilepsy are recorded in the Swedish Patient
Register,20,21 although epilepsy onset may precede
first entry into a hospital-based register. Incomplete
recording for ASD prior to ICD-9 and year 1987
(when the diagnosis was entered in Sweden) is
unlikely to have affected our relative risks since con-
trols were matched for calendar year. The validity of
the epilepsy diagnosis is fairly high and the positive
predictive value for epilepsy in the Swedish Inpatient
Register (main part of the Swedish Patient Register)
has been estimated at 79%.21 A study in Denmark (a
country with similar national register-based health
care to Sweden) found a positive predictive value
for epilepsy of 81% and for any seizure disorder of
89%.22 According to the Danish validation study of
the ICD codes for different specific epilepsies in
Health Care Registers, their predictive value is low
in the subgroups.22 The occurrence of the specific
epilepsy diagnosis varied in different studies of indi-
viduals with ASD and comorbid epilepsy, primarily
generalized between 14% and 24%, partial onset
between 30% and 44%, and the dominating group
had unspecified epilepsy (G40.9).6,9,23 We have there-
fore not analyzed the different epilepsy codes
separately.
Risk estimates increased somewhat when we
restricted our exposure to individuals with $2 records
of epilepsy and our outcome to $2 records of ASD.
A Swedish study recently found that 96% of all
ASD cases identified in the Swedish Patient Register
could
be
confirmed
through
patient
chart
examination.24
One limitation of our study is our lack of data
on medication. Exposure to certain antiepileptic

 medication may influence fetal development and
could potentially increase the risk of ASD in the off-
spring. Yet contradicting this latter hypothesis as
a main cause is evidence that the risk of ASD was sim-
ilar in the offspring and siblings of patients with
epilepsy.
The most likely explanation of our findings is
shared pathophysiologic, possibly genetic, mecha-
nisms, some influencing the balance between excita-
tion and inhibition.14,25 Tuberous sclerosis complex
and other rarer syndromes where ASD and epilepsy
both occur are examples where different etiologies
lead to both ASD and epilepsy. There are most likely
different factors influencing the core mechanisms
behind epilepsy and ASD (their core mechanisms
being close or similar), bringing the patient to a tip-
ping point where one or both disorders develop. It has
been suggested that the 2 diseases share risk factors or
heritability,14,26 which is consistent with our findings
of a bidirectional temporal relationship, reinforcing
the suggestion that seizures are not the cause of ASD.
It is not likely that the inability to adjust for intellec-
tual disability in our analyses regarding ASD in relatives
of individuals with epilepsy has changed our results sig-
nificantly as we analyzed the risk in relatives without
epilepsy of individuals without comorbid ASD.
Several other studies have reported bidirectional
relationships between psychiatric disease and epi-
lepsy.27,28 A systematic review and meta-analysis
found a 7.8-fold increased risk of psychosis in indi-
viduals with epilepsy.29 Additional to shared genetics,
patients with epilepsy and ASD have frequent con-
tacts with health care. Thus, we cannot rule out that
surveillance bias (also present in relatives) has contrib-
uted to the excess risks witnessed in our study.
Individuals with epilepsy are at increased risk of
ASD, particularly if epilepsy appears in childhood
or if the individuals are female. The high risk of
ASD should have unique implications for the health
care of patients with epilepsy. This group of patients
should be screened for ASD, and if ASD is suspected,
assessed for a diagnosis of the disorder. Our finding
that ASD is also more common in siblings and off-
spring of individuals with epilepsy suggests shared eti-
ology and an overlapping inheritance.
