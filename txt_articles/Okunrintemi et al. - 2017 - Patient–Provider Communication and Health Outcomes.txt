Background—Consumer-reported patient–provider communication (PPC) assessed by Consumer Assessment of Health 
Plans Survey in ambulatory settings is incorporated as a complementary value metric for patient-centered care of chronic 
conditions in pay-for-performance programs. In this study, we examine the relationship of PPC with select indicators of 
patient-centered care in a nationally representative US adult population with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease.
Methods and Results—The study population consisted of a nationally representative sample of 6810 individuals (aged 
≥18 years), representing 18.3 million adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (self-reported or 
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition diagnosis) reporting a usual source of care in the 2010 to 2013 
pooled Medical Expenditure Panel Survey cohort. Participants responded to questions from Consumer Assessment 
of Health Plans Survey that assessed PPC, and we developed a weighted PPC composite score using their responses, 
categorized as 1 (poor), 2 (average), and 3 (optimal). Outcomes of interest were (1) patient-reported outcomes: 12-item 
Short Form physical/mental health status, (2) quality of care measures: statin and ASA use, (3) healthcare resource 
utilization: emergency room visits and hospital stays, and (4) total annual and out-of-pocket healthcare expenditures. 
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients reporting poor versus optimal were over 2-fold more likely to report poor 
outcomes; 52% and 26% more likely to report that they are not on statin and aspirin, respectively, had a significantly 
greater utilization of health resources (odds ratio≥2 emergency room visit, 1.41 [95% confidence interval, 1.09–1.81]; 
odds ratio≥2 hospitalization, 1.36 [95% confidence interval, 1.04–1.79]), as well as an estimated $1243 ($127–$2359) 
higher annual healthcare expenditure.
Conclusions—This study reveals a strong relationship between PPC and patient-reported outcomes, utilization of evidence-
based 
therapies, 
healthcare 
resource 
utilization, 
and 
expenditures 
among 
those 
with 
established

 2  Okunrintemi et al  PPC and Outcomes Among Individuals With ASCVD 
A
therosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is one 
of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity and a 
leading contributor to healthcare expenditure in the United 
States.1,2 Despite improvement in outcomes, significant varia-
tion in the quality of healthcare processes among patients with 
ASCVD is well documented.1 Patient-centered care supported 
by effective communication between healthcare providers 
and consumers is one of the fundamental components of the 
robust strategy identified by the National Quality Strategy, 
paramount to the improvement of healthcare delivery and 
outcomes.3 In fact, consumer-reported patient–provider com-
munication (PPC) assessed by the Consumer Assessment of 
Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey in ambu-
latory settings is incorporated as a complementary value met-
ric for patient-centered care of chronic conditions in various 
pay-for-performance programs. In lieu of being a key com-
ponent of assessing physicians’ performance and health out-
comes, coupled with the mounting financial impact thereof, 
has in recent years sparked interest in exploring relationships 
between patient-reported experiences, such as PPC and a wide 
range of healthcare processes and outcomes.
Previous literature has suggested the effectiveness of the 
PPC as one of the key factors for certain elements of care pro-
cesses related to outcomes, such as adherence to prescribed 
medications among patients with ASCVD.3–8 However, to 
date, there is little information on its relationship with a wide 
range of healthcare outcomes of interest. In this study, we 
determine the association of PPC on patient-reported health 
status, measures of quality of care, healthcare resource utili-
zation, and spending for a nationally representative sample of 
adults with established ASCVD in the United States. These 
results could provide support for PPC as a target for future 
quality improvement interventions in optimizing patient-cen-
tered care among high-risk patient cohorts.
Methods
The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), a publicly avail-
able database sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and 
Quality, was used for this study. MEPS is a national survey of indi-
viduals and families, their medical providers and employers for medi-
cal conditions, healthcare resource utilization, and costs. The MEPS 
database contains deidentified information on sociodemographic 
characteristics, utilization of health services, patient-reported health-
care experiences and outcomes, insurance coverage, medical expen-
ditures, and sources of payment. Each year, the MEPS Household 
Component sample is drawn from respondents of the previous year’s 
National Health Interview Survey. It is a complex survey design with 
overlapping panels, where each panel is composed of randomly sam-
pled, noninstitutionalized US civilians. Participants are interviewed 
every 6 months over a period of 30 months, and their responses are 
reported annually to provide nationally representative estimates of 
sociodemographic characteristics, medical conditions, healthcare 
utilization, and costs.9 Interviews are conducted over the telephone, 
and further information is obtained from physicians, hospitals, and 
pharmacies to supply additional information on healthcare utilization 
and cost data. After data collection, AHRQ researchers assign per-
son weights and variance estimation stratum to reflect survey nonre-
sponse and population totals from the participants’ surveyed.10
To increase the sample size, we pooled 4 years of data from MEPS 
(2010–2013) and merged the full-year consolidated file, medical con-
ditions file, and prescribed medicines file using the unique person-
level identification numbers. We applied the assigned person-level 
weight accordingly to reflect the estimation of US population mean 
sample size from the sampled observation. Individuals included in 
our analysis were those with ASCVD (self-reported or ICD-9 diagno-
sis of coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, or cerebro-
vascular disease), ≥18 years of age at the time of survey, with a body 
mass index ≥18.5 kg/m2 (underweight individuals generally represent 
a sicker population), reporting a usual source of care, and with a final 
survey person weight >0 to be a representative of the national popu-
lation at the time of survey (Figure). Furthermore, individuals with 
missing or inapplicable responses to the communications-related 
questions (Table IA in the Data Supplement) from the CAHPS survey 
were excluded from the final sample size used in this study. Because 
MEPS is a deidentified publicly available data set, according to the 
US Department of Health and Human Services guidelines, institu-
tional review board approval was not required for this study.
Dependent Variables
MEPS contains information about utilization of health service such 
as inpatient hospitalizations and prescription drug use. It also con-
tains information on healthcare expenditure and patients’ self-rating 
of their overall health. We evaluated the influence of PPC on these 
indicators. All the questions used from the survey in this evaluation 
are listed in Table IA in the Data Supplement.
Patient-Reported Outcomes
To assess the physical and mental health status of participants, MEPS 
constructed physical and mental health summary scores using re-
sponses to the questions adopted from the 12-item Short Form ver-
sion 2 survey. The physical health component score and the mental 
health component score ranged from 0 (worst health status possible) 
to 100 (best health status possible). We divided each summary score 
into quartiles, with the lowest quartile reflecting poor physical/mental 
health score.
Quality of Care Indicators
We chose statins and aspirin as a quality of care indicator for this 
population because they are among the established management ther-
apies and processes of care among patients with ASCVD.10 During 
the data collection, respondents provided the names of prescribed 
medicine they obtained or purchased within the reference period, and 
a written consent was sought from these participants to obtain pay-
ment information, drug name, national drug code, date and dosage 
from the drug stores and pharmacies.10 AHRQ researchers conducted 
WHAT IS KNOWN
• PPC serves as a complementary value metric for 
patient-centered care in existing pay-for-perfor-
mance programs.
• Previous literature suggests that an optimal PPC 
is associated with more adherence to medication, 
lower healthcare expenditure, and higher consumer 
satisfaction
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
• This study provides association between an opti-
mal PPC and a wide spectrum of health outcomes, 
including patient-reported outcomes, quality of 
care processes, healthcare resource utilization, and 
expenditures high-risk patients with established 
ASCVD in a representative US population.
• These results should stimulate patient-centered 
research to further explore potential factors that will 
facilitate effective communication between patients 
and their healthcare providers and incorporation into 
the routine healthcare delivery process.

multiple imputations for individuals with missing data, by imputing 
the payment information for another person’s purchase of the same 
drug from the pharmacy data.10 Information on drug prescription is 
contained in the MEPS Prescribed Medicine Files. We coded 3-hy-
droxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors and lipid-
lowering combinations that contained a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl 
coenzyme A agent as statins. The response to the question from the 
MEPS data does the person take aspirin frequently? was used to as-
certain aspirin use.
Health Resource Utilization
The MEPS full-year consolidated file contains variables that repre-
sents the total count of all emergency room visits reported and the 
total number of hospital discharges for the survey year. We used the 
variable that represented the total number of discharges to reflect the 
total number of times a participant had an inpatient hospital stay. Any 
emergency room visit and hospitalization, as well as ≥2 emergency 
room visits and hospital discharges, were used as indicators of in-
creased health resource utilization. Overall, self-reported healthcare 
utilization is validated and verified by standardized medical record 
abstraction in a subsample of the respondents; studies have shown 
excellent overall agreement.11
Healthcare Expenditure
We used the information obtained from the MEPS full-year consoli-
dated file to evaluate the annual healthcare expenditure among the 
MEPS respondents with ASCVD. Expenditures refer to the sum of 
payments for health care which includes out-of-pocket payments 
and payments made by insurance companies and other sources.9 
Information on healthcare expenditure and the source of payment was 
collected for every participant for each medical event experienced 
during the year.9 Data for this variable included expenditures from all 
payer groups and out-of-pocket spending, including information from 
hospitalizations, prescribed medications, outpatient visits (hospital 
outpatient visits and office-based visits), emergency department vis-
its, and other expenditures (dental visits, vision aid, home health care, 
and other medical supplies). We estimated the mean and marginal per 
capita expenditures (the difference between a reference category and 
other categories, with respondents who always had a good PPC as 
the reference category) by using the margins–post and margins–dydx 
commands, respectively, after the twopm regression command.
Independent Variables
Patient–Provider Communication
At the midpoint of surveys each year, MEPS participants respond to 
questionnaires assessing PPC derived from the CAHPS survey. The 
responses to the following questions related to PPC was used as pri-
mary predictor variable in the study: (1) how often healthcare provid-
ers explained things in a way that was easy to understand? (2) how 
often providers showed respect for what you had to say? (3) how 
often providers spent enough time with you? (4) how often providers 
listened carefully to you? The responses were provided on 4-point 
Likert scale: 1-never, 2-sometimes, 3-usually, and 4-always. After 
CAHPS recommendations, never and sometimes were combined to 
give a single variable labeled never/sometimes. The responses were 
therefore recoded and labeled as 1-never/sometimes, 2-usually, and 
3-always. We added the responses to these 4 questions which yield-
ed a total score ranging from 4 to 12 and subsequently developed a 
Figure. Flow chart of study participant selection

weighted average response from 1 to 3 with 1-indicating poor PPC, 
2-indicating an average PPC, and 3-indicating optimal PPC). These 
4 questions from the CAHPS survey have been recommended by 
the CAHPS consortium as a measure of patient experience on how 
well they communicate with their healthcare providers, and these are 
also components of the ALERT model (Always, Listen Carefully, 
Explain Things Understandably, Respect What the Patient Has to Say, 
Time Management), designed to help physicians recall the CAHPS 
questions.12
Covariates
Sociodemographic information was also obtained from the MEPS 
full-year consolidated file. Some of the variables accounted for in our 
adjusted analyses included age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance cover-
age, level of income, region, cardiovascular modifiable risk factors, 
and comorbid conditions. Income level was based on family income 
level as proportion of federal poverty level (FPL): poor (<100 to 
<125% FPL), low income (125% to <200% FPL), middle income 
(200% to <400% FPL), and high income (≥400% of FPL). We de-
fined modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases by using the 
self-reported responses of participants to the questions in the MEPC-
HC survey. We included respondents with at least 1 of hypercholes-
terolemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, lack of physical exercise 
(defined as lack of moderate–vigorous physical activity, ≥30 min, ≥ 
5×  per week), smoking, or obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2, 
derived using self-reported weight and height by the individuals).13 
Comorbid disease burden was estimated using the Grouped Charlson 
comorbidity index, which has been described in detail elsewhere.14,15 
We accounted for these factors in our statistical analysis, to control 
any probable influence they may have on the association between 
PPC and the outcomes studied.
Statistical Analysis
We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) for 
all analysis conducted in this study. We applied person weight and 
variance estimations to ensure that our results are nationally repre-
sentative of the US civilian noninstitutionalized population. Using 
the different responses given by participants to the communications-
related questions from the CAHPS survey and the overall composite 
score (PPC) developed from these responses, the χ2 test was used 
to examine differences in outcomes of these persons with ASCVD. 
Because data on expenditure are usually right skewed (ie, most ex-
penditures are seen in just a fraction of the population), we used 
2-part models to study the healthcare expenditures. Two-part models 
are often used to model healthcare expenditures. They are the product 
of the mean expenditure and the probability that any given individ-
ual had any expenditures. Just as the name implies, this model has 2 
parts: the first part of the model consists of a probabilistic regression 
model (probit), which provides an estimate of the probability of zero 
versus positive expenditures. Relying on the probability of having a 
positive annual healthcare expenditure, a generalized linear model 
with gamma distribution and a logarithmic link function extrapolate 
the average expenditure per capita. The distribution of the general-
ized linear model is determined by using the modified park test. We 
conducted 2 models of regression analysis using each of the various 
outcomes of interest as a binary variable and the composite score for 
PPC as the primary predictor. Model 1 was a univariate regression 
analysis, and in model 2, we included adjustments for age, sex, race, 
region, level of income, health insurance, comorbidities, and modifi-
able risk factors of ASCVD. We used a 2-part model to analyze the 
difference in healthcare expenditure with respect to the PPC compos-
ite scores among the respondents. We used 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs), odds ratios (OR), and a 2-sided P value <0.05 to estimate the 
level of statistical significance.
Results
The total study sample consisted of 6810 participants ≥18 
years of age (65±14 years, 46% female), which translates to 
≈18 million US adults with ASCVD reporting access to usual 
source of care. Overall, 43%, 32%, and 25% of study partici-
pants reported efficient, intermediate, and poor PPC, respec-
tively. As shown in Table 1, lower PPC was significantly 
associated with younger age, ethnic minority race/ethnicity, 
and absence of health insurance coverage.
Patient-Reported Outcomes
According to the physical and mental health component score 
derived from the 12-item Short Form version 2, 58.9% of 
ASCVD patients who communicated efficiently with their 
healthcare providers and 74.3% of those who reported poor 
PPC had a poor physical health component score (P<0.01). 
About 26.4% of the participants who reported good PPC and 
48.3% of those reporting poor PPC had a poor mental health 
component score (P<0.01; Table 2). As shown in Table 3, 
both univariate and multivariate regression analyses reveal 
an inverse relationship between the effectiveness of PPC and 
the likelihood of reporting a poor physical and mental health 
among ASCVD patients. When compared with individuals 
reporting optimal PPC, those who reported an average PPC 
had a 44% higher likelihood of reporting a poor state of physi-
cal health (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.24–1.72). Furthermore, those 
with poor PPC were twice more likely to rate their state of 
physical health as poor (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.86–2.79). A 
similar trend is also seen with PPC and mental health score 
(Table 3). In addition, Figures I through IV in the Data Sup-
plement demonstrate comparable results across all individual 
PPC responses. Table IB in the Data Supplement shows the 
correlation across all PPC responses, the strongest being 
between the responses to the questions how often providers 
listened carefully to you? and how often providers showed 
respect for what you had to say? (R2=0.64).
Quality of Care Indicators
Overall, 58% and 64% of ASCVD patients reported utiliza-
tion of statins and aspirin, respectively. Poor PPC was inversely 
related to use of statins/aspirin among patients with ASCVD 
(Table 3). After adjustments for other covariates, compared with 
ASCVD patients reporting optimal PPC, those reporting poor 
PPC were at least 50% (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.26–1.83) more 
likely to report that they had not been prescribed or using statins. 
They were also less likely to report aspirin usage (Table 3).
Health Resource Utilization and Expenditures
In a similar fashion, patients reporting poor PPC were more 
likely to report higher rates of emergency department visits 
and hospitalization. As shown in Table 3, in the unadjusted 
model (model 1), ASCVD patients had a 46% (OR, 1.46; 95% 
CI, 1.15–1.84) higher chance of visiting the emergency room 
at least twice in the study year and a 42% (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 
1.08–1.87) higher likelihood of being hospitalized ≥2× if they 
reported a poor PPC relative to those with optimal commu-
nication with their providers. The effect was attenuated after 
adjustments for other covariates (model 2) to 41% (OR, 1.41; 
95% CI, 1.09–1.81) and 36% (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.04–1.79), 
respectively. Also, ASCVD participants reporting poor PPC 
tend to spend more on health care annually. Accounting for 
confounding variables, those with poor PPC spent an average 
of $1243 (95% CI, $127–$2359) more on health care annually.

Discussion
Using data representing over 18 million US civilian nonin-
stitutionalized adults with ASCVD, we were able to describe 
the relationship between PPC and a wide range of health 
outcomes. After the growing interest in patient engagement 
and how this affects the delivery of quality and affordable 
health care, as well as its influence on healthcare outcomes, 
mounting evidence suggests that patient engagement tends 
to be associated with better health outcomes and the use of 
less expensive but effective health interventions.4,5 Given the 
study population, this study which is to the best of knowledge 
the first of its kind suggests the likely effects of PPC on an 
array of health outcomes, including healthcare expenditure 
and resource utilization and the use of evidence-based thera-
pies, quality of care, and patient physical/mental health rating 
among ASCVD patients.
Some studies have suggested that the overall patient-cen-
tered care has a positive impact on a patient’s physical health, 
mental health, and overall health outcomes.8,16 This is consis-
tent with the results in our study because we demonstrated 
that effective communication between patients and providers 
was associated with an improved perception of physical and 
mental health among ASCVD patients. This may be as a result 
of mutual participation and control between patients and 
healthcare providers, as well as the provision of an enabling 
environment where the patients feel empowered, respected, 
and heard, hence influencing their health outcomes posi-
tively. However, the differences in health outcomes that could 
be attributed to PPC may be difficult to determine because 
there could be other underlying factors contributing to these 
observed differences.
With the growing amount of evidence suggesting an asso-
ciation between patient–provider relationship and adherence 
to medication, the results from this study further bolster this 
point by demonstrating an association between utilization 
of standard of care treatment regimens (statins and aspirin) 
among ASCVD patients and PPC. Beach et al17 also described 
similar findings in a cross-sectional study exploring patient–
provider relationship and its possible influence on medication 
adherence and health outcomes. These findings highlight the 
potential role PPC can impart on improving the quality of care 
and the health outcomes of patients. Efficient patient care is a 
holistic approach, and an improvement in the communication 
between patients and healthcare providers now seems to be 
very pertinent in the attainment of positive health outcomes.
Our results show an increased health resource utilization 
among patients who communicated poorly with their health-
care providers. Although this observation was attenuated when 
we considered the relationship between PPC and any emer-
gency visit or inpatient hospitalization (Table II in the Data 
Supplement), the association of poor PPC was significant with 
higher levels of resource utilizations (Table 3). There was also 
a higher annual healthcare expenditure among patients who 
report poor communication with their providers. Bertakis et 
al18 reported a similar result in a randomized trial of patients 
and physicians, examining the physician practice styles, the 
patient–provider interaction, and the associated health out-
comes. This revealed a significantly reduced number of annual 
specialist care visits and hospitalizations, fewer use of diag-
nostic and laboratory procedures, and a decrease in the total 
medical charges among patients with better interaction with 
their healthcare providers.18 The lower healthcare resource

utilization with optimal PPC was also reflected in terms of 
annual healthcare expenditures. Although we were unable 
to study the possible mechanisms that could be responsible 
for this association, it is suggested in literature that optimal 
PPC by enhancing better exchange of pertinent information, 
emphasizing shared decision making processes, and by miti-
gating uncertainties on patients underlying conditions may 
potentially lower unnecessary health resource utilization and 
ultimately healthcare expenditure.18 Our findings slightly dif-
fer from an earlier report by Fenton et al19 that suggested that 
although patient satisfaction was related with lower healthcare 
utilization, it was also associated with slightly higher annual 
healthcare expenditures. It is important to recognize that 
though PPC may correlate to provider satisfaction, they are 
likely distinct domains of patient-reported healthcare expe-
riences. Although patient satisfaction can be enhanced with 
better PPC, it also correlates with unrelated processes such as 
the extent to which the clinician fulfils the patients’ respects. 
Although patient satisfaction can be enhanced with better 
PPC, it also correlates to unrelated processes, including extent 
to which physicians fulfill patients’ requests.20 This could be 
one of the possible explanations for the higher healthcare 
costs mainly driven via pharmaceutical expenditures as noted 
in the study by Fenton et al.19
Although previous studies have shown a relationship 
between PPC and patient health outcomes, little explanation 
of the key factors responsible for this association was given 
probably because it is still largely poorly understood.16,21–25 
Heisler et al26 reported an association between an effec-
tive PPC and better self-management of diabetes mellitus 
among the geriatric population, likely related to improved 
patient’s understanding and subsequently motivation to fol-
low recommendations provided by their physicians. Pivotal 
studies in recent years have also highlighted an association 
between PPC and medication refill adherence and the effect 
of PPC and shared decision making on blood pressure con-
trol among diabetic patients.27,28 Despite the extensive body 
of literature geared toward promoting an effective patient–
provider interaction as a measure to improve overall medical 
care and outcomes,29–38 some unanswered questions surround-
ing the precise mechanism for this phenomenon still remain. 
Recently, Street et al25 attempted to provide some plausible 
explanations for this reported association via direct and indi-
rect pathways between PPC and health-reported outcomes. 
The more likely explanation is that an effective PPC could 
yield better patient understanding of their medication condi-
tion, trust and confidence in their healthcare providers, mutual 
agreement, and thus motivation, adherence to medication 
and commitment to treatment.25 These could lead to potential 
improvements in the health status of the patients and a better 
perception of their health, hence reduce the need for unneces-
sary investigations, downstream resource utilization, and ulti-
mately lowering healthcare expenditure.
This study findings need to be interpreted in the context 
of the following limitations. The data from MEPS were col-
lected from noninstitutionalized US adult population hence 
the results reported here only represent this population. 
The cross-sectional design of MEPS makes it impossible to 
establish a cause and effect relationship between PPC and 
health outcomes. It is also important to note that our sam-
ple population included participants with a self-reported 
diagnosis of ASCVD, hence there is a risk of underestima-
tion of the cohort size. Although self-reported measures of 
patient-reported experiences and outcomes have been shown 
to have a high internal validity, there is a chance of recall 
bias, and the veracity of all self-reported information cannot 
be confirmed. Although we accounted for factors that may 
impact PPC, including sociodemographic characteristics,

 7  Okunrintemi et al  PPC and Outcomes Among Individuals With ASCVD 
socioeconomic status, and comorbidities, we cannot rule out 
residual confounding secondary to other additional deter-
minants. Furthermore, as a measure of the quality of care 
among ASCVD patients, we were limited to self-reported 
use of statins and aspirin. We could not account for possible 
contraindications to the use of these medications among non-
users and because of paucity of information, in addition to 
other well-defined clinical performance and quality of care 
indicators that may impact the health-reported outcomes. It is 
also paramount to note that the use of the CAHPS survey as a 
measure of patient-reported experience of PPC is not devoid 
of limitations. The accuracy of its application and survey 
design may raise questions concerning the credibility of the 
feedbacks provided by the respondents. This is because the 
timeliness of the survey may affect the responses provided 
by the participants, and the possibility of recall bias can-
not be excluded.39 Conversely, some individuals may report 
their healthcare experience based on the perception of their 
health status rather than an objective evaluation of the inter-
action they had with their healthcare providers. However, the 
association between PPC and health outcomes among the 
studied population persisted even accounting for underlying 
CVD risk factors and burden of comorbid conditions. Finally, 
our study findings may not apply to about 8% of ASCVD 
patients who responded to the PPC-related questions but did 
not report a usual source of care. They were excluded from 
the analysis to limit recall bias related to the PPC questions. 
It is important to note that including these individuals in a 
subanalysis did not impact the overall results (Table III in the 
Data Supplement).
Conclusions
To summarize, this study explores the potential influences of 
PPC on a wide spectrum of health outcomes among a rep-
resentative adult population with established ASCVD in the 
United States. These findings further contribute to the grow-
ing body of evidence, suggesting that an effective interaction 
between patients and their healthcare providers is associated 
with better health outcomes and the use of more cost-effective 
health interventions. These results should stimulate patient-
centered research to further explore potential factors that will 
facilitate effective communication between patients and their 
healthcare providers and incorporation into the routine health-
care delivery process.
