In Brief
Rangan et al. show that cycles of a
fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) ameliorate
intestinal inflammation, promote
intestinal regeneration, and stimulate the
growth of protective gut microbial
populations in a mouse model displaying
symptoms and pathology associated
with IBD. They also show that a similar
FMD is safe, feasible, and effective in
reducing systemic inflammation and the
consequent high levels of immune cells in
humans.

SUMMARY
Dietary interventions are potentially effective thera-
pies for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). We
tested the effect of 4-day fasting-mimicking diet
(FMD) cycles on a chronic dextran sodium sulfate
(DSS)-induced murine model resulting in symptoms
and pathology associated with IBD. These FMD cy-
cles
reduced
intestinal
inflammation,
increased
stem cell number, stimulated protective gut micro-
biota, and reversed intestinal pathology caused by
DSS, whereas water-only fasting increased regener-
ative and reduced inflammatory markers without
reversing pathology. Transplants of Lactobacillus or
fecal microbiota from DSS- and FMD-treated mice
reversed DSS-induced colon shortening, reduced
inflammation, and increased colonic stem cells. In a
clinical trial, three FMD cycles reduced markers
associated with systemic inflammation. The effect
of FMD cycles on microbiota composition, immune
cell profile, intestinal stem cell levels and the reversal
of pathology associated with IBD in mice, and the
anti-inflammatory effects demonstrated in a clinical
trial show promise for FMD cycles to ameliorate
IBD-associated inflammation in humans.
INTRODUCTION
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn’s dis-
ease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is associated with acute
and chronic inflammation of the intestine. Risk factors include
genetic predisposition and factors that alter gut microbiota,
such as antibiotics (Manichanh et al., 2012). Although the effect
of nutrition on IBD remains poorly understood, diets that
cause pro-inflammatory changes in gut microbiota have consis-
tently been associated with IBD pathogenesis (Kaplan and Ng,
2017).
Periodic fasting (PF) and fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs) have
been effective in increasing healthy lifespan or as therapies in
mouse models for a variety of diseases (Choi et al., 2017; Lee
and Longo, 2016; Brandhorst et al., 2015). FMDs can reduce
cancer incidence and aging-associated immunosuppression/
immunosenescence, a process aided by hematopoietic stem-
cell-based regeneration (Brandhorst et al., 2015; Cheng et al.,
2014). Moreover, FMD cycles ameliorate or reverse disease pro-
gression in mouse models of multiple sclerosis (MS), and type I,
and type II diabetes (Choi et al., 2016; Cheng et al., 2017). Recent
studies also showed positive effects of a 24-hour fast on intesti-
nal stem cell function in young and aged mice by a fatty acid
oxidation pathway (Mihaylova et al., 2018).
Here, we report on the effect of cycles of a low-calorie
and low-protein FMD in the treatment of a mouse model for
IBD-related pathology and on its effects on inflammatory
markers in humans. Our results indicate that FMD cycles
cause a reduction in intestinal inflammation, increase intesti-
nal stem cells (ISCs), and promote the expansion of beneficial
gut microbiota, resulting in improvements in IBD-associated
phenotypes.
RESULTS
FMD Cycles Ameliorate IBD-Associated Phenotypes
The dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis model is
commonly used to study IBD in mice because DSS is a sulfated
polysaccharide especially toxic to the colonic epithelium (Du-
paul-Chicoine J. et al., 2010; Koblansky et al., 2016). The acute
DSS model is implemented over 1–2 weeks and is used to
achieve short-term alterations in the intestinal barrier, whereas
the chronic DSS mouse model is implemented over a period of
2–4 months to cause long-term effects on intestinal immunity
and damage, serving as an effective model for chronic colitis
(Wirtz et al., 2017). Because genetic factors for IBD are currently

 not well-established and only account for a portion of IBD, with
one study finding that only 12% of UC patients have a familial
history of IBD (Zhang and Li, 2014; Childers et al., 2014), the
chronic DSS mouse model is particularly appropriate to model
IBDs triggered by environmental factors (Schippers et al.,
2016; Hoffmann et al., 2017; Zou et al., 2016).
For our study, we used the chronic DSS mouse model (Chas-
saing et al., 2014) consisting of 5 days of 2% DSS in the drinking
water followed by 9 days of no treatment, which was repeated for
a total of 4 cycles (Figure 1A). We evaluated the effects of two,
4-day FMD cycles on symptoms and pathology associated
with the disease (Figure 1A), as well as body weight changes
and food and water intake during the first three DSS cycles (Fig-
ure S1A) and through the two FMD treatments and 4th DSS
cycle (Figure S1B). We monitored the following groups: an
age-matched, female control that did not receive DSS or FMD
(Naive), a disease group administered DSS for 4 cycles together
with a standard diet (DSS), and a disease group treated with 4
cycles of DSS in combination with FMD cycles given before
and after the 4th DSS treatment (DSS+FMD). During the FMD cy-
cles that flanked the 4th DSS cycle, the DSS+FMD group drank
less water because the composition of the FMD contained a sub-
stantial amount of water in days 2–4 of the FMD cycle, but during
the 4th DSS cycle, water intake of the DSS+FMD group was
increased compared to that of the DSS and Naive groups, espe-
cially on days 1, 3, and 4 of the 4th DSS cycle (day 1: DSS+FMD
versus Naive, p < 0.001; day 3: DSS+FMD versus Naive,
p < 0.01, and DSS+FMD versus DSS, p < 0.05; day 4: DSS+FMD
versus Naive, p < 0.01) (Figure S1B). Thus, the FMD did not nega-
tively affect water intake during the 4th DSS cycle.
Additionally, we studied a group that was treated with 4 cycles
of DSS in combination with 2 days of a water-only fast (DSS+WF)
before and after the 4th DSS treatment (DSS+WF) (Figure 1A).
The DSS+WF group was limited to 2 days per cycle to prevent
mice from losing more than 20% of their initial body weight.
The same standard is used for the FMDs. Body weight changes
and food and water intake were measured everyday through
the two water-only fasting treatments preceding and following
the 4th and last cycle of DSS treatment (Figure S1C). In the
4th DSS cycle, the water intake of the DSS+WF group was
increased, as was seen in the DSS+FMD group, when compared
to that of the DSS and Naive groups, especially on days 1, 2, and
4 of the 4th DSS cycle (day 1: DSS+WF versus Naive, p < 0.001;
day 2: DSS+WF versus Naive, p < 0.001, and DSS+WF versus
DSS, p < 0.05; day 4: DSS+WF versus Naive, p < 0.05)
(Figure S1C).
Starting on the last day of the 3rd DSS cycle, the disease activity
index (DAI) was measured every day for the Naive, DSS,
DSS+FMD, and DSS+WF groups. Because an FMD or water-
only fast cycle induces a temporary body weight loss, which is
not associated with reduced health (Brandhorst et al., 2015) (Fig-
ure 1C), our modified DAI scores only include changes in stool
consistency and blood in stools (Figures 1D and 1E), as deter-
mined by a Hemoccult test (Figure 1F). The DSS+FMD group
showed an overall decrease in disease activity when compared
to the DSS group starting on day 2 of the first FMD cycle, with
significant reductions at the end of the last DSS cycle and at the
beginning of the second FMD cycle (p < 0.05) (Figure 1B). The
DSS+WF group did not display any significant changes in DAI
when compared with the DSS group (Figure 1B), except on
day 19, which was the 2nd day of the 2nd water-only fast cycle
and when the DSS+WF group had a significantly elevated DAI
score compared to the DSS group (p < 0.001) (Figure 1B). The
DSS+WF group also had no significant changes in stool consis-
tency comparedtotheDSSgroup(Figure 1D) andwasassociated
with an increase in the presence of blood in stools on day 4 during
the 1st water-only fasting cycle (p < 0.05) (Figure 1E) andon day 19
during the 2nd water-only fasting cycle (p < 0.0001) (Figure 1E)
compared to the DSS group, suggesting that in mice, water-
only fasting increases gut permeability, at least temporarily.
We also assessed the effects of DSS and the FMD treatment
on the white blood cell profile. An increase in the percentage of
lymphocytes and decrease in those of granulocytes and neutro-
phils was observed in mice after 3 cycles of DSS treatment prior
to any dietary intervention (p < 0.001) (Figures S1D, S1E, and
S1G). After 4 DSS cycles, the lymphocyte count, which
continued to be elevated compared to that in untreated mice,
was reduced by the FMD treatment. The percentages of granu-
locytes and neutrophils were instead increased in the DSS+ FMD
group when compared to the DSS group (p < 0.05) (Figures S1H,
S1I, and S1K), but no differences were detected in the percent-
age of monocytes or erythrocytes at either time point (Figures
S1F, S1J, S1L, and S1M). When the DSS+WF group was
included, it had similar effects compared to the DSS+FMD
group. This group had significant reductions in lymphocyte
count (p < 0.0001) (Figure S1H) and increases in granulocyte
(p < 0.01) (Figure S1I), monocyte (p < 0.0001) (Figure S1J), and
neutrophil levels (p < 0.5) (Figure S1K), with no changes in eryth-
rocytes as noted before with the Naive, DSS, and DSS+FMD
groups (Figure S1M).

of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran in the serum. FMD

 cycles caused a return of the average FITC-dextran serum con-
centration to levels comparable to those observed in Naive
mice, although neither the DSS-dependent increase nor the
FMD-dependent decrease was significant (p = 0.06) (Figure S1N).
A reduction in colon length is a marker of intestinal damage af-
ter DSS treatment and a phenotypic feature used to assess IBD
severity (Rose et al., 2012). After 4 DSS cycles, colon length was
shortened to an average of 6.5 cm from an average of 7.6 cm
in the Naive group (p < 0.01) (Figures 1G and 1H). When mice
underwent 2 FMD cycles, colon length returned to normal
(p < 0.001) (Figures 1G and 1H). Mice treated with 4 DSS cycles
and
that underwent
two water-only
fast
cycles
did not
show improvements in colon length (p < 0.05) (Figure 1G). After

the

the

group displayed a significant increase in small intestine length
compared to that in the DSS group (p < 0.05) (Figures 1I and 1J).
Overall, these data suggest that FMD cycles reversed several
symptoms and pathology in a mouse model for IBD. In contrast,
water-only fasting does not promote reversal of IBD-related
pathology.
FMD Cycles Reduce Systemic and Intestinal
Inflammation
To investigate the effects of FMD cycles on systemic inflamma-
tion in the chronic DSS mouse model, we monitored changes in
splenocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).
Increased levels of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have
been associated with IBD in patients, while a study in DSS-
treated mice reported a modest increase in spleen CD4+
T cells (Funderburg et al., 2013; Freise et al., 2018). In our study,
DSS cycles did not cause an increase in CD4+ T cells, but rather,
we observed a significant reduction in the percentage of splenic
CD3+CD4+ T cells in the DSS+FMD group compared to both the
DSS and Naive groups (p < 0.0001) (Figure 2A). No differences in
splenic CD3+CD8+ T cells were observed among the three
groups (Figure S2E). Notably, the percentage of splenic
CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells that are central memory
T cells (TCM) was significantly higher in the DSS+FMD group
compared to that in the Naive group (p < 0.05) (Figures S2F
and S2G). In our study, the overall percentages of splenic
CD45+ leukocytes (p < 0.01; Figure 2B) and CD45+CD19+ B cells
(p < 0.05; Figure 2C) were reduced in the DSS+FMD group
compared to the Naive group. Although there were no changes
in the percentage of splenic macrophages and monocytes
among the three groups (Figures S2H and S2I), a significant
increase in the percentage of myeloid cells was observed in
the DSS+FMD group compared to the Naive group (p < 0.05)
(Figure S2J). The percentage of splenic neutrophils was also
significantly increased in both the DSS and the DSS+FMD
groups when compared to that in the Naive group (p < 0.05
and p < 0.01, respectively) (Figure S2K). We also did not observe
any changes in the percentage of CD3+CD4+ or CD3+CD8+
T cells, nor in the TCM sub-type (Figures S2L and S2M), but we
did detect a non-significant trend for a reduction in the overall
percentage of CD45+ leukocytes and CD45+CD19+ B cells in
the DSS+FMD group (Figures S2N and S2O).
We assessed the severity of colon inflammation at the end of
the study (Figure S2A). Although we did not observe a difference
between the DSS and DSS+FMD groups, the DSS+FMD group
showed a slight improvement compared to the DSS group (Naive
versus DSS, p < 0.0001; Naive versus DSS+FMD, p < 0.001; Fig-
ure S2B). Also, four cycles of DSS caused a decrease in crypt
number, which was reversed by 2 cycles of the FMD (p < 0.01;
Figure 2D). It has been suggested that intestinal inflammation
affects epithelium integrity and gut permeability (Landy et al.,
2016). The increase in crypt number in the DSS+FMD group
indicates that the elevated colonic inflammation score may be
evidence of regenerative inflammation and not damaging inflam-
mation (Eming et al., 2017).
Next, we investigated inflammatory markers in the intestinal
tissue. We noticed a major increase in CD4+ (Figure 2E) and
CD8+ cells (Figure 2G) in the small intestine villi of DSS-treated
mice (p < 0.0001; Figure 2F and 2H), which was reversed by 2
FMD cycles (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively; Figures 2F
and 2H). A characteristic of IBD is the accumulation of overactive
dendritic cells at inflammation sites, which induce the differenti-
ation of CD4+ and CD8+ effector lymphocytes that propagate at
inflammation sites in the intestinal mucosa (Larmonier et al.,
2015; Boschetti et al., 2016). In the colon, we analyzed
CD11b+ dendritic cells. These types of dendritic cells can drive
type
2
T-helper
lymphocyte
(TH2)
responses,
with
the
CD11b+CD103� sub-population mediating these responses in
the colon and the CD11b+CD103+ sub-population in the small in-
testine (Mayer et al., 2017). One study found increased numbers
of CD11b+ cells in the colonic lamina propria (LP) of mice predis-
posed to colitis (Ey et al., 2013). We found increased numbers of
CD11b+ cells in the colonic LP surrounding the base of crypts
(Figure 2I) in the DSS group (p < 0.001; Figure 2J), which was
lowered in the DSS+FMD group (p < 0.05; Figure 2J). The
DSS+WF group also displayed a significant reduction in
CD11b+ cells compared to the DSS group (p < 0.001; Figure 2J).
A similar pattern in the levels of CD4+and CD8+ cells was

 observed in the areas surrounding colonic crypts in the LP (Fig-
ures 2K and 2L). Regarding CD8+ cells, only the DSS+FMD
group showed a significant reduction when compared to the
DSS group (p < 0.5; Figure 2L).
Taken together, the increase in colonic crypt number and
reduction of CD4+, CD8+, and CD11b+ cells in the intestinal
epithelium support a role for FMD cycles in ameliorating intesti-
nal inflammation in a mouse model for IBD.
FMD Cycles Promote Regeneration in the Gut and Small
Intestine
Because gut regeneration could explain the reversal of the DSS-
induced intestinal shortening by FMD treatment, we studied the
effects of FMD cycles on markers of regeneration. We assessed
small intestine regeneration by quantifying bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU+) crypt cells (Figures 3A and 3B). The number of BrdU+
cells per small intestinal crypt was increased in the DSS+FMD
group when compared to the DSS and Naive groups (p <
0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively; Figure 3B). Previous studies
have highlighted the protective quality of caloric restriction on
ISC, indicated by the increase of Lgr5+ stem cells and Paneth
cells, the latter of which aids the self-renewing processes that
occur in intestinal crypts (Tinkum et al., 2015; Yilmaz et al.,
2012; Sato et al., 2011). Lgr5 is an established marker for crypt
base columnar (CBC) stem cells (Barker, 2014), whereas Sox9
is expressed in CBCs but also in enteroendocrine cells (Formeis-
ter et al., 2009). We stained for Lgr5 and Sox9 (Figures 3C–3E) in
the small intestine and observed a decrease in in the number of
Lgr5+ cells per crypt in DSS-treated mice (p < 0.001; Figure 3D),
which was reversed by the FMD treatments (p < 0.0001; Fig-
ure 3D). Notably, the number of Lgr5+ cells per crypt in the
DSS+FMD group reached a level higher than that in Naive
mice (p < 0.01; Figure 3D). Similarly, we detected a decrease
in Sox9+ cells in the upper-crypt spanning into the villus after 3
DSS cycles (p < 0.001; Figure 3E). Enteroendocrine cells can
stimulate ISC division after exposure to a high-nutrient diet and
may modulate ISC proliferation through the secretion of pep-
tides, such as glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) (Amcheslavsky
et al., 2014; Loudhaief and Gallet, 2016). FMD treatment
promoted enteroendocrine-cell-dependent ISC regeneration,
as determined by the expression of Sox9+ cells in the intestinal
villi (p < 0.0001; Figure 3E). In colonic crypts, DSS cycles also
decreased the level of BrdU+ cells (p < 0.05; Figure 3K), an effect
reversed in the DSS+FMD group (p < 0.0001; Figure 3K).
Colonic BrdU+ cells were also increased in the DSS+WF group
(p < 0.0001; Figure 3K). Similarly, DSS cycles decreased the
number of Lgr5+ cells in colonic crypts (p < 0.0001; Figure 3L);
an effect reversed in both the DSS+FMD and DSS+WF groups
(p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively; Figure 3L).
Elevated levels of cytokines are associated with pro-inflam-
matory responses but could have a role in gut regeneration (Neu-
rath, 2014; Karin and Clevers, 2016). We observed a significant
increase in the serum cytokine level of interleukin-17A (IL-17A)
in the DSS+FMD group when compared to the DSS group
(p < 0.05; Figure 3F) and detected a similar increase in IL-17A
in the colonic supernatant from the DSS+FMD group (p < 0.05;
Figure 3G). Like IL-17A, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa)
also acts to enhance intestinal healing under inflammation-
driven stress (Brockmann et al., 2017; Leppkes et al., 2014).
Serum TNFa levels were greatly elevated in the DSS+FMD group
when compared to both the DSS and Naive groups (p < 0.01 and
p < 0.001, respectively; Figure 3H). TNFa in the colonic superna-
tant was elevated in both the DSS and DSS+FMD groups when
compared to the Naive group, with no significant changes in co-
lon tissue homogenate (p < 0.05; Figure 3I; Figure S2D). The role
of interferon gamma (IFNg) as a pro- or anti-inflammatory cyto-
kine in the context of IBD is still a topic of debate (Conn, 2013).
In our assessment of IFNg in the serum and colonic supernatant
for all three groups, we did not detect any significant changes
(Figure S2C).
Overall, these results suggest that FMD cycles stimulate the
generation of cytokines that may enhance the regenerative
effects observed and increase the numbers of CBCs and
enteroendocrine cells in the intestinal crypt that support gastro-
intestinal regeneration and repair.
FMD Cycles Stimulate an Increase in Microbial
Populations Associated with T Cell Regulation and Gut
Regeneration
To elucidate the potential role of microbiota in the effects of FMD
cycles, we collected fecal stool samples from Naive mice or mice
treated with 4 cycles of DSS±FMD (samples were collected
9 days after the 4th DSS cycle and 2 days after the end of the
2nd FMD cycle) (Figure 4A). After 4 DSS cycles, the overall micro-
biome composition was significantly altered in the DSS group,
but the more pronounced changes occurred in the DSS+FMD
group when compared to the DSS group (Figure 4B). The relative
abundance of S24-7 was down by more than two-fold (64.6% to
27.5% ± 7.9%; Table 1) and that of Lactobacillaceae, a family that
regulates T cell activity and can reduce the severity of IBD symp-
toms in experimental models (Damaskos and Kolios, 2008), was
increased three-fold (15.5% to 45.2% ± 4.2%; Table 1) in the

 DSS+FMD compared toDSS group.Bifidobacteriaceae, a micro-
bial family that has been shown to ameliorate symptoms in DSS-
colitis models (Srutkova et al., 2015), was found to be uniquely
enriched in the DSS+FMD group (0.034% to 2.67% ± 3.56%;
Table 1). We also observed a significant increase in the relative
abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae (10.5% ± 5.71%; Table 1) in
the DSS+FMD group, although the role of this family in the
context of IBD is still not clear (Kaakoush, 2015). Of this family,
the genus Allobaculum was enriched in the DSS+FMD group
(data not shown). Allobaculum has been associated with protec-
tion from obesity and insulin resistance, with one study finding its
relative abundance to be increased alongside Bifidobacterium in
mice with a lean phenotype (Everard et al., 2014; Raza et al.,
2017). After the 2nd water-only fast and 2 days of re-feeding,
the DSS+WF group had a small increase in Lactobacillaceae
(25.8% ± 3.97%; Table 1; Figure 4B); however, Bifidobacteria-
ceae was undetectable (Table 1). Paraprevotellaceae was de-
tected only in the DSS+WF group (6.13% ± 0.148%; Table 1).
The Naive, DSS, DSS+FMD, and DSS+WF groups separated
according to group and time point (Table S6; Figure S7A,
p = 0.001; Figure S7D, p = 0.001; Figure S7E, p = 0.014).
We also compared the composition of the most abundant
families between the groups at different time points (Figure S3A;
Table S1). Two days after the 4th cycle of DSS and one day
before the 2nd FMD cycle, the DSS and DSS+FMD groups did
not display major changes in microbiota composition (Fig-
ure S3B; Table S2). When we compared the DSS+FMD group
one day before the 2nd FMD cycle versus on the last day of the
2nd FMD cycle, we observed a reduction in the relative abun-
dance of S24-7 and an increase in Erysipelotrichaceae, and a
significant decrease in Lactobacillaceae abundance (Figure S3C;
Table S3). Despite the temporary reduction at the end of the FMD
cycle, the Lactobacillaceae levels increased approximately
45-fold after 2 days of re-feeding with the normal diet after the
2nd FMD cycle (Figure S3E; Table 1; Table S3), indicating that
the major microbiota changes require both the FMD and several
days of re-feeding with a normal diet.
The abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae was approximately
4-fold lower between the mice on the last day of the 2nd water-
only fast and those on the last day of the 2nd FMD cycle (23%
to 6.16% ± 4.83%; Table S4; Figure S3Dd). A striking difference
between the microbiomes of these groups was also the pres-
ence of Paraprevotellaceae, which was more abundant than
Lactobacillaceae in the water-only fasting group compared
to the FMD group (12.9% ± 3.41% versus 5.77% ± 1.18%;
Table S4; Figure S3D). On the last day of the 2nd water-only fast-
ing and FMD cycles, samples separated at a significant p value in
the weighted ordination (p = 0.033; Table S6; Figure S7F). The
samples of the DSS and DSS+FMD groups, 2 days after the
4th DSS cycle and 1 day before the 2nd FMD cycle, did not sepa-
rate at a significant value (p = 0.579; Table S6; Figure S7B). When
two time points of the DSS+FMD group were compared, 1 day
before the 2nd FMD cycle and on the last day of the 2nd FMD
cycle, samples did not separate at a significant p value in the
weighted ordination (p = 0.265; Table S6; Figure S7c).
These results indicate that FMD cycles increase the abun-
dance of protective microbial families, such as Lactobacillaceae
and Bifidobacteriaceae, while also altering the abundance of
other microbial strains to restore a protective gut microbiome
in DSS-treated mice.

 Fecal Transplant from FMD-Treated Mice Promotes
Positive Changes in IBD-Associated Symptoms
To investigate whether the shift in the microbiome is responsible
for the effects of the FMD on IBD-associated pathology, we per-
formed a fecal transplant (Figure 5A) (Ellekilde et al., 2014).
Recipient mice were divided into three groups: a group that
received no DSS, but a 1:1 control gavage solution of sterile
PBS and glycerol during the gavage period (Naive FT), a group
that received three DSS cycles and a cecum-derived solution
from mice in the DSS group (DSS FT), and a group that received
three DSS cycles and a cecum-derived solution from mice in
the DSS+FMD group (DSS+FMD FT). Another group underwent
three DSS cycles and a gavage treatment of the Lactobacillus
strain,
Lactobacillus
rhamanosus
(LGG)
(DSS+LGG).
We
measured IBD DAI every day starting on the last day of the 3rd
DSS cycle (Figure 5B). The DSS+FMD FT group showed a
non-significant trend for a lower DAI score than that in the DSS
FT group, 2–3 days after the last day of gavage, whereas the
DSS+LGG group did not display a significant change in the over-
all and sub-DAI scores compared to the DSS FT group (Fig-
ure 5B; Figures S4A–S4C).
We observed a reduction in colon length in the DSS FT group
when compared to the Naive FT (Figure 5C; p < 0.0001, Figure 5D)
and a return to the normal colon length in the DSS+FMD FT and
DSS+LGG groups when compared to the DSS FT group (Fig-
ure 5C; p < 0.001, Figure 5D). The white blood cell composition
from whole blood at the end of the experiment did not show major
changes (Figures S5A, S5B, and S5D), except for an increase in
monocytes in the DSS+LGG group compared to the DSS FT and
DSS+FMD FT groups (Figure S5C; p < 0.05) and a decrease in
erythrocyte volume compared to the Naive FT, DSS FT, and
DSS+FMD FT groups (Figure S5E; p < 0.001). Splenic CD45+ leu-
kocytes and B cells in the DSS+FMD FT group were reduced
compared to the Naive FT group (p < 0.05; Figure 5E; Figure 5F).
Splenic neutrophils were increased in both the DSS FT and
DSS+FMD groups (p < 0.01; Figure S5F). Splenocyte CD4+
T cells were not affected, but we did see a reduction of CD8+
T cells in both recipient groups and an increase in the percentage
of the CD8+ T cells of the TCM subtype for both groups, (p < 0.01
and p < 0.05, respectively; Figures S5G and S5H).
IL-5 and IL-6 are significantly elevated in UC patients (Olsen
et al., 2011), and although we did not observe any changes in
serum levels of IL-5 and IL-6 (Figures S5I and S5J), the DSS FT
group displayed higher levels of both cytokines in colonic super-
natant when compared to those from Naive FT controls, which
were reduced in the colonic supernatant from the DSS+FMD FT
group (p < 0.001, p < 0.01, and p < 0.01, respectively; Figures
5G and 5H). IL-23 and IL-27 are cytokines thought to be activated
in CD, with IL-23 involved in TH17 differentiation (Sartor, 2006). CD
patients have been reported to have increased serum IL-27, but
this cytokine may have anti-inflammatory functions due to its
ability to trigger IL-10 production (Andrews et al., 2016). IL-23
and IL-27 were increased in the serum of the DSS+FMD FT group
(p < 0.05; Figures S5K and S5L), whereas IL-27 was reduced
in the colonic supernatant, which was evident in the DSS+FMD
FT group (p < 0.05; Figure 5I). There were no changes among
groups in the colonic supernatant levels of IL-23 (Figure S5M).
Additionally, we measured several cytokines associated with
CD or colitis in distal colon tissue homogenate from the FT
groups (Figure S5N). IFNg was elevated in the DSS+FMD FT
group compared to the Naive FT control (p < 0.05; Figure S5N),
as was IL-17A (p < 0.01; Figure S5N). The DSS+FMD FT groups
had higher levels of TNFa than the DSS FT group (p < 0.05; Fig-
ure S5N). Its consistent increase in the DSS+FMD FT group was
in agreement with what we found with the DSS+FMD group
(Figures 3F–3I). There were no changes in IL-13, but for IL-10,
an anti-inflammatory cytokine and immunoregulator of TH2
responses (Couper et al., 2008), we found that compared to
the Naive FT control, the DSS FT group displayed a lower level
in colonic tissue (p < 0.01; Figure S5N), whereas the DSS+FMD
FT caused a trend for a reversal of this effect (Figure S5N, Naive
FT versus DSS+FMD FT group; p < 0.05).

 We also evaluated the expression of specific regenerative and
inflammatory markers (Figures 2 and 3). BrdU+ analysis revealed
a significant increase in BrdU+ cells in colonic crypts in both
the DSS+FMD FT and DSS+LGG groups, when compared to
the DSS FT group. Figure 5J refers to the microscopy images,
and Figure 5K shows the quantification of BrdU (p < 0.0001
[DSS+FMD FT versus DSS FT] and p < 0.01 [DSS+LGG versus
DSS FT]). A similar increase was seen in colonic Lgr5+ cells in
the crypts of the DSS+FMD FT and DSS+LGG groups. Figure 5J
refers to the microscopy images, and Figure 5J shows the quan-
tification of Lgr5+ (p < 0.0001 [DSS+FMD FT versus DSS FT] and
p < 0.05 [DSS+LGG versus DSS FT]). In the LP cells surrounding
the base of colonic crypts, the DSS+LGG group displayed a
reduction in CD4+ and CD11b+ cells when compared to the
DSS FT group, whereas the DSS+FMD FT group showed a trend
toward a reduction in the levels of these cells (Figure 5L; p <
0.05; Figure 5M), but neither of the three groups showed
changes in CD8+ cells. Certain strains of Lactobacillus tend to
suppress TH2 responses, and because CD11b+ cells have
been observed to drive TH2 responses in the colon. It is plausible
from these results that Lactobacillus works to suppress TH2
responses in the colon by reducing CD11b+ levels (Mayer
et al., 2017).
We also investigated which microbial families were present af-
ter a fecal transplant (Figure S6A). Samples for the three groups
showed different profiles according to the treatment group
(Table S6; DSS+FMD versus DSS+FMD FT, p = 0.007, Fig-
ure S7G; DSS+FMD versus DSS+LGG, p = 0.009, Figure S7H).
Interestingly, microbiota form both the DSS+FMD FT and
DSS+LGG groups did not have as high of an abundance of
Lactobacillaceae as the DSS+FMD group (DSS+FMD versus
DSS+FMD FT, 45.3% ± 4.18% versus 12.2% ± 12.1%;
DSS+FMD versus DSS+LGG, 45.3% ± 4.8% versus 7.18% ±
3.95%; Table S5), although the DSS+FMD FT group displayed
an enrichment of the Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus
intestinalis strains (data not shown). Notably, both the DSS+FMD
FT and DSS+LGG groups showed an increase in the Verrucomi-
crobiaceae family compared to the DSS+FMD group (DSS+FMD
versus DSS+FMD FT, 3.64% ± 2.87% versus 10.5% ± 5.1%;
DSS+FMD versus DSS+LGG, 3.64% ± 2.87% versus 5.99% ±
4.79%; Table S5). Upon further analysis, both groups were found
to be enriched with the strain Akkermansia muciniphila, a mucin-
degrading bacterium that has been linked to reduced intestinal
inflammation and strengthening the epithelial gut barrier (Reuna-
nen et al., 2015). The Bacteroidaceae family was very abundant
in the DSS+FMD FT group when compared with the DSS+FMD
and DSS+LGG groups (17.7% ± 11%; Table S5), although the
Bacteroides acidifaciens strain was found to be enriched in
both the DSS+FMD and DSS+FMD FT groups (data not shown).
Although the bacterial family Rikenellaceae was not ranked in the
top 8 or 9 families among the DSS+FMD, DSS+FMD FT, and
DSS+LGG groups (Table S5), the strain Alistipes shahii, which
belongs to the Rikenellaceae family, was uniquely enriched in
the DSS+LGG group (data not shown) and is reported to modu-
late tumor growth in the gut (Belkaid and Hand, 2014).
These results indicate that FMD cycles cause shifts in gut
microbiota populations that, in turn, affect the immune cell pro-
file, cytokine levels, and regenerative activity in the colon.
FMD Cycles Reduce IBD-Associated Inflammation in
Humans and Mice, in Part, by Modulating White Blood
Cell Counts
C-reactive protein (CRP) is an established marker for inflamma-
tory diseases, including IBD, in human subjects (Vermeire et al.,
2006; Henriksen et al., 2008). We have previously shown that
3 FMD cycles reduce CRP levels in subjects with elevated
CRP at baseline (Wei et al., 2017). Here, we analyzed serum sam-
ples of mice that received 3 DSS cycles and observed a non-sig-
nificant trend for an increase in lymphocyte count (Figure 6D) and
a significant increase in lymphocyte percentage (Figure S1C) but
not in white blood cell (WBC) count (Figure 6C). Both at the end of
the first FMD cycle and two days after the 2nd FMD cycle post-
DSS
treatment,
lymphocyte
counts
were
reduced
when
compared to both Naive mice and mice that underwent 4 DSS
cycles on a standard diet (Figure 6D; Naive versus B p < 0.01;
A versus B, p < 0.001). A non-significant trend for a reduction
in WBCs was also observed after FMD treatments (Figure 6C).
We analyzed the levels of WBCs and lymphocytes, and the ef-
fect of 3 cycles of a 5-day FMD on them in human subjects with
elevated CRP (>1 mg/L) (Wei et al., 2017). In subjects with
elevated CRP, the WBC counts were increased compared to
those in subjects with CRP in the normal range (<1 mg/L). These
were reduced at the end of FMD cycle 1, as well as after 3 FMD
cycles (Figure 6A; p < 0.05). A reduction in lymphocytes was also
apparent at the end of FMD cycle 1 for the higher CRP group
(Figure 6B; p < 0.05), but after completing 3 FMD cycles, the lym-
phocytes of the higher CRP group had returned to levels not
different from those at baseline (Figure 6B).
These results suggest that FMD cycles can reduce systemic
inflammation and the associated increase in lymphocyte counts
or percentage in both mice and humans. A randomized clinical
trial on IBD patients is necessary to test the hypothesis that
FMD cycles reduce IBD pathology in humans.
DISCUSSION
Dietary
interventions
that
promote
coordinated
beneficial
changes in the hematopoietic and immune systems, and espe-
cially in the gut microbiota, have high potential to ameliorate
and possibly reverse CD, colitis, and other inflammatory and
autoimmune diseases. In this study, using the chronic DSS
model for IBD, we show that two cycles of a 4-day FMD followed
by a normal diet are sufficient to mitigate some, and reverse
other, IBD-associated pathologies or symptoms. In contrast,
water-only fasting only causes some of the effects of the FMD
cycles, indicating that certain nutrients in the FMD contribute
to the microbial and anti-inflammatory changes necessary to
maximize the effects of the fasting regimen. The lack of a signif-
icant change in the stool consistency and Hemoccult scores in
the water-only group could be explained by the complete lack
of nutrients. In fact, diets low or lacking carbohydrates and die-
tary fibers have been shown to significantly decrease colonic
cancer-protective fecal metabolites and exacerbate colitis, pro-
longing symptoms like bloody stools, with mitigation of symp-
toms seen after switching to a plant-based and semi-vegetarian
diet (Russell et al., 2011; Chiba et al., 2016). The FMD itself con-
tains prebiotic ingredients based on the same high-fiber

 ingredients used in the FMD human clinical trials (Wei et al.,
2017), such as oligofructoses, fructo-oligosacharides, and gal-
actomannan, derived from vegetables that can support the
growth of beneficial probiotic strains (Gibson et al., 2017; Marko-
wiak and �
Sli_
zewska, 2017).
Short, water-only fasting has been shown to prevent and help
treat intestinal inflammation in acute DSS models (a single,
5-day DSS treatment) (Sa
¨ vendahl et al., 1997; Okada et al.,
2017). Our study, using the chronic DSS model that more
closely reflects the symptoms and pathology associated with
IBD, indicates that fasting alone is not sufficient to reverse the
pathology associated with IBD, but it is its combination with
certain ingredients that is effective. Also, the FMD treatment
in the current study lasts 4 days and is repeated multiple times,
compared to the single, water-only fasting lasting between
36–48 hours in previous studies. Notably, Paraprevotellaceae,
associated with water-only fasting but not FMD treatment,
has been previously regarded as pro-inflammatory in the
context of IBD, with one study finding it to be especially en-
riched in mice with severe colitis (Roy et al., 2017). Another
study also found Paraprevotellaceae abundance increased
in rats with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as
IL-13, in colonic tissue (Shatzkes et al., 2017).
Our results also indicate that the growth and replacement of
damaged intestinal tissues occur strongly during the re-feeding
post-FMD, although our previous studies in multiple tis-

sues indicate that stem and other progen-
itor cells are activated already during
the FMD. This process may help explain
the increased expression of IL-17A in the
FMD group. In fact, the intestinal epithelium damage caused
by the IBD state is thought to trigger higher levels of FGF-2, a
propagator of ISC regeneration, which works with IL-17A to pro-
mote mucosal healing and intestinal epithelial cell proliferation
(Brockmann et al., 2017; Houchen et al., 1999). Also, in clinical
trials and studies with colitis mouse models, anti-IL-17A treat-
ments aggravate IBD-associated symptoms, suggesting that
IL-17A may play a role in reducing intestinal inflammation and
promote gut healing (Whibley and Gaffen, 2015). TNFa has
been previously reported to be chronically elevated in IBD pa-
tients, and TNFa inhibitors, such as infliximab and adalimumab,
have long been established as effective treatments for IBD
patients (Lichtenstein, 2013). One possible interpretation of the
effects of the FMD on increasing TNFa in our study is that
TNFa has both functions that are detrimental and those that
are beneficial. In fact, TNFa is well-established to promote cell
death but also promote wound healing and immune cross-talk
(Leppkes et al., 2014). In agreement with our previous studies,
we hypothesize that FMD cycles can first reduce the inflamma-
tion associated with IBD initiated by DSS treatment and, subse-
quently, promote regeneration during the re-feeding stage. Thus,
the intestinal inflammation leading to crypt hypertrophy with
enhanced epithelial proliferation observed in humans is consis-
tent with our findings and hypothesis that the FMD can turn
this disease-associated inflammatory state into a regenerative
process.

 It was originally proposed that DSS-induced inflammation
does not involve lymphocytes; however, later studies have sug-
gested that immunity may play a role in the pathogenesis of the
DSS-induced model. One study using Rag1-knockout (KO) mice
found that when DSS was administered, the immunodeficient
mice actually had a slower, more tolerable progression in dis-
ease symptoms than that of control mice, suggesting T and/or
B cells may contribute to pathology progression (Kim et al.,
2006). Another study also supports an increased inflammatory
and immune response in the DSS model (Morgan et al., 2013),
indicating that although the use of IL-10 KO and similar mice
can more strongly model autoimmune IBD, the DSS model
may better model environmentally induced IBD. Notably, the
DSS model also avoids the concern that if the FMD or other
treatments required elevated IL-10, their effects would not be
observed.
In summary, these results indicate that cycles of FMD and re-
feeding can ameliorate or reverse the symptoms and pathology
associated with IBD in a chronic DSS mouse model in part
through modulation of the gut microbiome. These FMD cycles
also reduce lymphocyte number and intestinal infiltration, in-
crease intestinal regeneration in DSS-treated mice, and lower
multiple markers of systemic inflammation in humans. These
promising results justify the testing of FMD cycles in randomized
clinical trials as a therapy for CD and colitis.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Mouse Models
All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Southern Cal-
ifornia (USC). All mice were maintained in a pathogen-free environment and housed in clear shoebox cages in groups of five animals
per cage with constant temperature and humidity and 12 hr/12 hr light/dark cycle. Prior to supplying the FMD diet, animals were
transferred into fresh cages to avoid feeding on residual chow and coprophagy. All animals had access to water at all times. Unless
otherwise on experimental diets, mice were fed ad libitum with regular chow (e.g., PicoLab Rodent Diet 20).
Chronic dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced mouse model
C57BL/6 mice (8-weeks-old, female) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and group-housed for 33 days. Before starting
DSS administration, mice were randomly-assigned into a Naive or DSS group. All mice were fed a ground standard rodent chow
(PicoLab Rodent Diet 20, LabDiet) and the DSS group received water with 2% w/w Dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS, Alfa Aesar)
mixed into autoclaved water as the only drinking source for 5 consecutive days, followed by 9 consecutive days of purified water.
This defined one DSS cycle. After 33 days, mice were randomly-assigned to experimental groups and single-housed for the
remainder of the experiment, encompassing part of the 3rd DSS cycle (9 consecutive days of purified water) and 4th DSS cycle.
Mice either underwent two, 2-day water-only fasting cycles, or two, 4-day cycles of FMD during this time frame. On the first day

 of each water-only fasting or FMD cycle, animals were transferred into fresh cages to avoid feeding on residual chow and
coprophagy. Mice were immediately refed with ground standard rodent chow (PicoLab Rodent Diet 20, LabDiet) after 2 days
(water-only fast) or 4 days (FMD) of the diet cycles. Individual body weights and food consumption was measured daily for the entire
duration of the study.
Fecal transplant and Lactobacillus transplant models
The fecal transplant was performed in mice based on previously published protocols (Seedorf et al., 2014; Ellekilde et al., 2014;
Kuethe et al., 2016; Shatzkes et al., 2017). Briefly, ceca contents were removed from naive and chronic DSS-induced mice (with
or without FMD treatment) and were aseptically flushed into a sterile 50% glycerol/PBS solution, in a 1:10 dilution. The mixed
ceca solutions were then aliquoted and frozen at �80�C until time of use. On each day of inoculation, the aliquots from the pooled
cecum solutions specific for each group were diluted again, 1:5, and administered at a volume of 150mL per mouse. The Lactobacillus
transplant in DSS-treated mice was performed based on previous protocols (Ciorba et al., 2012), in lieu of a fecal transplant. Briefly,
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) (ATCC 53103) was purchased from American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas,
Virginia, USA) and cultured according to manufacturer’s instructions, in Lactobacilli MRS broth (BD Diagnostics, 288130) at 37�C
for 48 hours. Petri dishes containing Lactobacilli MRS Agar (BD Diagnostics, 288210) were used to confirm the concentrations of
live bacteria by serial dilutions. These plates were sealed in a CO2 pouch system (BD Diagnostics, 260684) and placed in an incubator
at 37�C for 48 hours. Aliquots containing of 5x107 cfu/mouse/day were suspended in 50% PBS-glycerol solution and frozen at �80�C
in cryovials until day of gavage. C57BL/6 mice (8-weeks-old, female) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, group-housed
for 33 days, and were on a food and water schedule to initiate the DSS condition previously described in the above section. After
33 days, mice were single-housed for the remainder of the experiment and were only allowed to consume an irradiated sterile
diet (Pico-Vac Lab Rodent Diet, LabDiet) and autoclaved water. Mice were orally-gavaged 3 days after being single-housed, for
4 consecutive days to match the duration of an FMD cycle. Mice were divided into three groups: one receiving the pooled ceca
solution from donor mice that underwent four DSS cycles and no dietary intervention (DSS Fecal Transplant (FT)), the second
receiving the pooled ceca solution from donor mice that underwent four DSS cycles and two FMD cycles (DSS+FMD FT), and a group
receiving the Lactobacillus transplant (DSS+LGG). A Naive control group received no DSS, but a 1:1 control gavage solution of sterile
50% glycerol/PBS (Naive FT). Mice were euthanized one week after the last day of inoculation.
Human FMD trial
All participants provided written informed consent, and the University of Southern California (USC) Institutional Review Board
approved the protocol (approval #HS-12-00391). The design, dietary composition, and results of the human FMD trial have been re-
ported elsewhere (Wei et al., 2017). In brief, one-hundred participants (generally healthy adult volunteers and 18 to 70 years of age;
BMI, 18.5 and up) without a diagnosed medical condition in the previous 6 months were enrolled (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02158897).
All data was collected at the USC Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute; subjects were recruited from April 2013 to July 2015.
Participants were instructed to consume the FMD, which was provided in a box, for 5 continuous days, and to return to their normal
diet after completion until the next cycle that was initiated approximately 25 days later. Participants completed three cycles of this
5-day FMD. Participants completed baseline (A) and follow-up examinations at the end of the first FMD (before resuming normal diet
to measure the acute FMD effects; B) and after a washout period of 5 to 7 days of normal caloric intake after the third FMD cycle (C).
A complete blood count was performed at each time point by an overnight fasting blood draw through venipuncture at the USC
Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute. WBC and lymphocyte data was stratified post hoc for all subjects that successfully
completed 3 FMD cycles with C-reactive protein levels lower than 1 mg/L (normal risk group) versus subjects with > 1 mg/L CRP
(elevated risk group) at baseline.
Criteria for inclusion of human subjects
Generally healthy adult volunteers, subjects 18-70 years of age, body mass index, 18.5 and up, ability and willingness to provide
written informed consent, ability, and willingness to undergo multiple cycles of a 5-day dietary regimen, ability and willingness to pro-
vide blood samples via venipuncture.
Exclusion criteria
Any major medical condition or chronic diseases, mental illness, drug dependency, hormone replacement therapy (dehydroepian-
drosterone, estrogen, thyroid, and testosterone), pregnant or nursing female, special dietary requirements or food allergies, alcohol
dependency, and medications known to affect body weight.
Profile
Subjects in this study are at age 43.0 ± 11.2 years, with heights of 168.3 ± 9.8 cm, with body weights of 77.7 ± 16.8 kg at baseline
and 75.5 ± 16.4 kg at the end of FMD. The female:male distribution is as follows: low CRP (N = 36; 15:21) and high CRP with FMD
(N = 25; 16:9).

 METHOD DETAILS
Mouse fasting mimicking diet
The mouse version of the FMD is a 4-day regimen based on the human FMD (Wei et al., 2017; Brandhorst et al., 2015) and has been
previously detailed (Cheng et al., 2017). Briefly, a combination of flavored broth mixes, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), essential fatty
acids, vegetable powders (containing beet root, carrot root, collard leaf, kale leaf, nettle leaf, spinach leaf, tomato fruit, and mitake
mushroom), vitamins, and minerals were thoroughly mixed and bound together with heated hydrogel (ClearH20, Maine) on Day 1 of
the diet. From Days 2-4, a combination of flavored broth mixes, glycerol, and hydrogel was fed to mice. On the first day of FMD, mice
consumed z50% of their normal caloric intake (8.08 kJ/g; 0.56 kJ fat, 0.68 kJ carbohydrates, 0.11 kJ protein). From the second
through fourth days of FMD, mice consumed z10% of their normal caloric intake (1.10 kJ/g; 0.27 kJ carbohydrates). All mice
were supplied with fresh food during the morning hours (9am-11am), with most of the food consumed within the first few hours of
the light cycle. Control-fed animals normally consumed food within the dark hours.
Post-diet refeeding
After the end of each 2-day water-only fast and 4-day FMD cycle, mice were fed ad libitum with regular chow (PicoLab Rodent
Diet 20, LabDiet) to regain body weight before the next diet cycle.
DAI scoring
DAI is used to track the severity of the disease by scoring the extent of body weight loss, stool consistency, and blood in the stools
(Kim et al., 2012).The DAI for each animal was recorded once after every 5-day DSS administration period for the first two DSS cycles,
and then every day starting after the third DSS cycle. Scores were determined based on body weight loss, stool consistency, and
rectal bleeding as described previously (Sun et al., 2015). Body weight loss was scored as follows: score 0, no body weight loss;
score 1, body weight loss within 1%–5%; score 2, body weight loss within 5%–10%; score 3, body weight loss within 10%–20%;
score 4, greater than 20% body weight loss. Stool consistency was determined as follows: score 0, solid pellets; score 1, soft but
adherent in pellet shape; score 2, loose stool but with some solidity; score 3, loose stool with signs of liquid consistency; score 4,
diarrhea. Rectal bleeding was evaluated using a Hemoccult II SENSA Fecal Occult Blood Test Kit (Beckman Coulter) and following
the manufacturer’s protocol. Scoring was determined as follows: score 0, no sign of blood; score 1, Hemoccult positive; score 2,
Hemoccult positive with visual pellet bleeding; score 3, Hemoccult positive with visual pellet and rectal bleeding; score 4, Hemoccult
positive with gross visual pellet and rectal bleeding. The total sum from stool consistency and rectal bleeding was recorded as the
overall DAI score, since temporary body weight loss from the water-only fasting and/or FMD cycles could interfere with accurate
disease severity, as it reflects accurate reduction of caloric intake, and not reduced health (Brandhorst et al., 2015).
Colon inflammation score
H&E stained proximal colon sections were analyzed for severity of colonic inflammation 9 days after the 4th DSS cycle (DSS)
and 9 days after the 4th DSS cycle and 5 days after the last FMD cycle (DSS+FMD), as defined by the abundance of acute and in-
flammatory infiltrates such as lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, spanning the mucosa, muscularis mucosae, and submu-
cosa. A basal level of inflammation was scored at 0 (the Naive group was used as a control), a slight increase over the normal level of
inflammatory cells was scored as mild (1), a more obvious increase was scored as moderate (2), with a significantly higher increase
from basal inflammation scored as severe (3), all of which was tabulated into a numerical score.
BrdU Injection
BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared in heated and intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injected into mice 24 hours before euthanasia (1mg/100ul/
mouse). A second and final BrdU injection was given 4 hours before euthanasia (1mg/100ul/mouse). Mice were fasted for 4 hours
prior to second and final BrdU injection.
Immunohistochemistry analysis
On the 3rd day after the last FMD cycle was completed, mice were euthanized, and serum, spleen, small intestine, and big intestine
(ceca and colon) tissue was collected. Serum and spleens were kept on ice for FACS-processing and cytokine measurements. Big
intestines were straightened to measure colon length, and ceca contents were removed for the fecal transplant experiment. Small
and big intestinal tissue was then cut and either flash-frozen and stored at �80�C or fixed in 4% PFA and further processed in a su-
crose gradient, OCT-embedded, sectioned, and stained. The jejunum portion of the small intestine and the proximal colon of the big
intestine were used for all staining procedures described here, and the tissue preparation described has been adapted from previous
protocols (Van Landeghem et al., 2012; Ey et al., 2013). Intestinal tissue was fixed in 4% PFA overnight, rinsed in 1X PBS and
suspended in a 10% sucrose solution overnight. To complete the cryoprotection process, tissues were finally suspended in a
30% sucrose solution overnight. Tissues were then embedded in optical cutting temperature medium (OCT), flash-frozen on dry
ice, and stored at �80�C until ready for cryo-sectioning. Sections were transversally cut at 7mm and adhered to positively-charged
microscope slides. The exception to this procedure was for H&E staining: proximal colon sections were not fixed in 4% PFA and
were immediately kept in 1X PBS after cutting open longitudinally, rolled with a toothpick, mounted in cryomolds using OCT, and

 flash-frozen on dry ice. Sections were transversally cut at 4mm and adhered to positively-charged slides that were stained with the
Hematoxylin & Eosin Stain Kit (Vector Laboratories, H-3502) following the manufacturer’s protocol to visualize general changes in
epithelial and crypt morphology. To quantify colonic crypt number for each animal, representative images from each section (3-4)
of a slide were taken, and the distance in pixels was measured along the muscularis mucosae. The distance was converted
to mm, and the number of crypts counted over the measured distance was normalized to a number over 5000 mm. For immunoflu-
orescent staining of CD4, CD8, CD11b, Lgr5, Sox9, and BrdU, slides containing jejunum small intestine and proximal colon sections
were thawed at room temperature, rehydrated with PBS, blocked for non-specific staining in blocking buffer (1% Normal Donkey
Serum in PBS, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 30 min at room temperature, and stained with primary antibodies overnight at 4�C.
The next day, the sections were washed and stained with secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were pro-
tected from light, washed in PBS, stained with Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher) to stain for nuclei, and coverslipped with anti-fading
polyvinyl alcohol mounting medium with DABCO (Sigma-Aldrich). Images were captured at 20X using the EVOS FL Cell Imaging Sys-
tem (Thermo Fisher) and BZ-X710 All-in-One Fluorescence Microscope (Keyence) and analyzed with ImageJ (National Institute of
Health). The quantification of CD4, CD8 and Sox9 positive cells was limited to the villi region for small intestine sections, and the num-
ber of positive cells in 30-50 villi per animal were counted (at least 50 for Sox9). The quantification of Lgr5 was localized to the crypt
region for both the small intestine and colon samples, and the number of positive cells in 50 crypts per animal were counted. The
quantification of CD4, CD8, and Cd11b for colon sections was limited to the LP surrounding the base of colonic crypts. The area
surrounding 50 randomized crypts per animal were counted. The average number of positive cells per villi or crypt was then derived
from these calculations. For BrdU positive cell detection in the crypts of small intestine jejunum and proximal colon tissue, sections
were stained with BrdU In Situ Detection Kit (BD Biosciences, 550803) following the manufacturer’s 3,30-diaminobenzidine (DAB)-
based protocol. Images were observed with an Olympus BX50 microscope and Olympus DP73 camera and captured at 20X (colon)
or 40X (small intestine) magnification with cellSens Standard (Olympus Corp.) software. The number of positive BrdU cells in 50
crypts per animal was counted, starting from the base of the crypt to two-thirds of the way up from the base. The average number
of BrdU positive cells per crypt was then derived from these calculations. Primary antibodies used for small intestine and colon immu-
nofluorescent staining: mouse anti-CD4 (eBioscience, 14-0041-86), rat anti-CD8 (Abcam, ab22378), rabbit anti-Lgr5 (Abcam,
ab75732, 1:200), mouse anti-Sox9 (eBioscience, 14-9765-80). Secondary and secondary-conjugated primary antibodies used for
small intestine and colon immunofluorescent staining: Alexafluor 488 anti-mouse/human CD11b (BioLegend, 101219), donkey
anti-rabbit Alexafluor 594 (Thermo Fisher, A21207), donkey anti-mouse Alexafluor 488 (Thermo Fisher, A21202), and donkey anti-
rat Alexafluor 594 (ThermoFisher, A21209).
FACS Analysis
FACS analyses for different immune cell populations were conducted following standard protocols. Freshly-harvested splenocytes
and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stained with the immune cell markers listed below and analyzed with BD
FACS Diva on LSR II. Antibodies used for FACS analysis: CD3 Alexa700 (eBioscience), CD4 PE-Cy5 (eBioscience), CD8 Alexa488
(eBioscience), CD44 APC (eBioscience), CD62L PE-Cy7 (eBioscience), CD19 PE (eBioscience), CD11b Pe-eFluor 610 (eBioscience),
F4/80 PE-Cy5 (eBioscience), Ly-6G(ar-1) APC (eBioscience), CD45 APC-eFluor 780 (eBioscience).
Cytokines profiling
Prior to blood collection, mice were fasted for eight hours. Serum was stored at �80�C. Complete blood counts were executed with
the Hemavet 950 System (Drew Scientific) following the manufacturer’s protocol in order to evaluate whole-blood parameters. Prox-
imal colon pieces (approximately 2 cm from the bottom of cecum) were cut longitudinally and cultured individually in 6-well plates at
37�C in a cell culture room incubator in RPMI 1640 medium with 1% antibiotic. After 24 hours, the medium for each sample was
centrifuged at 800 g for 20 minutes, and the resulting supernatant was kept at �20�C until time of use. Distal colon tissue was
weighed and homogenized with the Bead Ruptor 12 (Omni International) according to standard protocols. After centrifugation
and purification, the resulting tissue homogenate was kept at �80�C until time of use. TNF-a, IFN-g, and IL-17A (R&D Systems)
were measured following the manufacturer’s protocol and using a spectrophotometer (SpectraMax M2, Molecular Devices). Serum,
colonic supernatant, and colonic tissue homogenate levels of IFN-g, IL-13, IL-23, IL-17A, IL-10, IL-27, IL-5, IL-6, and TNF-a for the
Naive FT, DSS FT, and DSS+FMD FT groups were measured on a custom ProcartaPlex Multiplex Panel (Thermo Fisher), with the
plate read by a BioRad Bio-Plex Suspension Array System (BioRad).
FITC Dextran Permeability
Increased gut permeability was evaluated by an increase in the serum concentration of fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated
dextran (FITC-Dextran). Based on previously published methods (Yan et al., 2011; Gupta and Nebreda, 2014; Michielan and
D’Inca
` , 2015), mice were fasted for four hours prior to oral gavage with 60mg/100 g of fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated dextran
(FITC-dextran, Sigma-Aldrich). At the time of euthanasia, four hours after the gavage, serum was collected through cardiac puncture
and shielded from light on ice. Samples were plated on a 96-well plate at a 1:2 dilution with PBS, with concentrations read using a
spectrophotometer (SpectraMax M2, Molecular Devices). Serum from mice that did not undergo FITC-dextran gavage was used to
create a standard curve.

16S rRNA gene sequencing using an Illumina MiSeq platform and a microbial profiling report summarizing the results was provided.
Human fasting-mimicking diet
The human version of the FMD in a proprietary formulation belonging to L-Nutra (http://www.l-nutra.com/prolon/). It is a plant-based
diet designed to attain fasting-like effects on the serum levels of IGF-1, IGFP1, glucose and ketone bodies while providing both mac-
ronutrients and micronutrients to minimize the burden of fasting (Brandhorst et al., 2015). Day 1 of the FMD supplies �4600 kJ (11%
protein, 46% fat, 43% carbohydrate), whereas days �5 provide �3000 kJ (9% protein, 44% fat, 47% carbohydrate) per day. The
FMD is comprised of proprietary formulations of vegetable-based soups, energy bars, energy drinks, chip snacks, tea, and a sup-
plement containing minerals, vitamins, and essential fatty acids. All items to be consumed per day were individually boxed to allow
the subjects to choose when to eat while avoiding accidentally consuming components of the following day. A suggested meal plan
was provided that described when the study foods could be consumed (i.e., breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinner). The ingredients of
the diet have been detailed previously (Wei et al., 2017), and are outlined below:

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The software used for statistical analysis was GraphPad Prism v.7. The figure legends describe the statistical tests used, value of n for
each experimental group, and what n represents for each experiment. All statistical analyses were two-sided and p values < 0.05
were considered significant (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001). Differences between the means of two groups
were tested with Student’s t test comparison, and one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-test among multiple
groups. Unless otherwise specified in figure legends, all data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. All samples represent biological
replicates. No samples or animals were excluded from analysis, and sample size estimates were not used. Animals were randomly
assigned to experimental groups.
