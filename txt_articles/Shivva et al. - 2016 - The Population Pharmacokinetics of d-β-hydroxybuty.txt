Abstract. The administration of ketones to induce a mild ketosis is of interest for the alleviation of
symptoms associated with various neurological disorders. This study aimed to understand the
pharmacokinetics (PK) of D-β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and quantify the sources of variability following
a dose of (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (ketone monoester). Healthy volunteers (n = 37)
were given a single drink of the ketone monoester, following which, 833 blood BHB concentrations were
measured. Two formulations and five dose levels of ketone monoester were used. A nonlinear mixed
effect modelling approach was used to develop a population PK model. A one compartment disposition
model with negative feedback effect on endogenous BHB production provided the best description of the
data. Absorption was best described by two consecutive first-order inputs and elimination by dual
processes involving first-order (CL = 10.9 L/h) and capacity limited elimination (Vmax = 4520 mg/h).
Covariates identified were formulation (on relative oral bioavailable fraction and absorption rate
constant) and dose (on relative oral bioavailable fraction). Lean body weight (on first-order clearance)
and sex (on apparent volume of distribution) were also significant covariates. The PK of BHB is
complicated by complex absorption process, endogenous production and nonlinear elimination.
Formulation and dose appear to strongly influence the kinetic profile following ketone monoester
administration. Further work is needed to quantify mechanisms of absorption and elimination of ketones
for therapeutic use in the form of ketone monoester.

INTRODUCTION
There is increasing evidence of the therapeutic benefits
of artificially induced mild ketosis in various disorders (1).
Ketones are the endogenous products of fat metabolism and
constitute D-β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), acetoacetate (AcAc)
and acetone. Ketones are produced in the liver as an
evolutionary response to starvation and constitute a vital
energy source when dietary glucose is unavailable. Amongst
the ketones, BHB and AcAc are used as a source of energy
by the heart, brain and skeletal muscle (2,3). In healthy
individuals, blood concentrations of total ketones are gener-
ally less than 0.5 mmol/L (equivalent to 52.05 mg/L of BHB),
whereas after prolonged fasting (e.g. for a week) blood
ketone concentrations can be 5–7 mmol/L (equivalent to
520.5–728.7 mg/L of BHB) called starvation ketosis (4).
Blood ketone concentrations in diabetic patients with
ketoacidosis may exceed 25 mmol/L (5,6).
Induction of physiological ketosis, e.g. by administration
of ketones, to yield blood concentrations of ketones equiva-
lent to those in starvation ketosis, has been purported to have
therapeutic benefit in a number of clinical conditions, such as
epilepsy (7), neurodegenerative disorders (such as
Alzheimer’s (8) and Parkinson’s diseases (9)). Investigations
using preclinical animal models support potential of ketones
in improving conditions of insulin resistance in the brain, a
commonly associated factor with Alzheimer’s disease (9,10).
Induction of acute mild ketosis has been proposed for
improving physical performance and cognitive function (11).
Induction of mild ketosis can be achieved either by prolonged
fasting or by consumption of a diet high in fat and low in
carbohydrate. Diets may also elevate plasma concentrations
of triglycerides and cholesterol, which carries a risk of
complications, such as vascular disorders and diabetes (12).
A novel means of inducing ketosis is by administration of
the
ketone
monoester
((R)-3-hydroxybutyl
(R)-3-
hydroxybutyrate), which is broken down by esterases to form
BHB in vivo (13). The ketone monoester is expected to undergo
complete enzymatic hydrolysis following oral intake to release
BHB and butane-1,3-diol. The carboxylesterases involved are

 expressed throughout the gastrointestinal tract, liver and blood.
R-1,3-butanediol is further metabolised in the liver and blood to
produce BHB (14,15). BHB in the liver is metabolised to AcAc
and acetone (16). BHB and AcAc in blood circulation are taken
up by extra hepatic tissues and are used as energy source (17).
Several reports are available in the literature that describe
the kinetics of ketones in humans following intravenous infusion
(18–21). Most of these studies used tracer techniques involving
infusion of small amounts of labelled BHB and AcAc, which do
not alter normal physiological ketone concentrations. Recently,
a preliminary study in healthy adults established the pharmaco-
kinetics (PK), safety and tolerability following single and
multiple drinks of the ketone monoester that produced ketone
concentrations equivalent to starvation ketosis (13). In this
study, ketones were administered in the form of the ketone
monoester in a meal replacement drink in healthy adult
volunteers. This study consisted of a single drink (140, 357 and
714 mg/kg of the ketone monoester) and a repeat drink
administration (140, 357 and 714 mg/kg of the ketone monoester
three times a day for 5 days) with the ketone monoester. This
study reported plasma concentrations of BHB and AcAc. PK
evaluation in this study was performed using the single dose
administration data. Area under the plasma concentration-time
curve (AUCinf) for BHB were 1.09, 4 and 13 mM.h (113.5, 416.4
and 1353 mg.h/L) for 140, 357 and 714 mg/kg drink groups,
respectively. The authors found the increase in AUC and Cmax
was more than dose proportional suggesting nonlinearity in the
PK. Time for Cmax (Tmax) was in the range of 1.5 to 2.5 h, with
increased Tmax noted for high dose group. Clearance (CL/F)
was ranged from 4179 to 11946 mg/mM.h (40.14 to 114.7 L/h),
and the smaller dose had higher (~ 3 times) clearance. Due to
limitations associated with the non-compartmental approach, a
detailed understanding of the PK of ketones was not possible in
this study.
The ratio of BHB and AcAc in blood during normal
physiological ketone conditions is approximately unity
(BHB:AcAc = 1:1). This ratio may rise up to 4 to 6 during
excess blood ketone concentrations (such as under conditions
of starvation ketosis), by means of a physiological compen-
satory mechanism to prevent metabolic acidosis (22). Thus,
ketotic conditions (such as starvation ketosis) are associated
with excessively high blood concentrations of BHB compared
to AcAc and it is of great interest to explore and understand
the PK of BHB, under such conditions. The present study
aimed to describe and quantify the pharmacokinetics of BHB
from orally administered ketone monoester and to identify
and quantify sources of variability. The study objectives were
(1) to develop a population PK model, (2) to describe
absorption and elimination processes and to identify covari-
ates that account for PK variability and (3) to provide a basis
for the design of future studies on the catabolic disposition of
the ketone monoester.
METHODS
The study was conducted at the University of Oxford,
UK, as a part of ongoing investigations into the ketone
monoester. It was approved by the Oxfordshire Research
Ethics Committee and conducted in accordance with the
guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. All participating
subjects gave written informed consent.
Study Population
Healthy human volunteers (n = 37; 22 males and 15
females) consumed a single drink of the ketone monoester
(see Supplemental materials and methods online). Two drink
formulations were studied. Formulation 1 was a citrus-flavoured
sports drink that was prepared in four dose levels of ketone
monoester (192, 291, 395 and 573 mg/kg). Formulation 2 was a
chocolate milkshake meal replacement preparation and
consisted of one 500 mg/kg group (see Supplemental materials
and methods online for calorific composition of formulations).
All subjects received a single drink of the ketone monoester
following an overnight fast, and blood samples were collected
for analysis of BHB concentration. Dosing details and demo-
graphic details of the subjects are presented in Table I.
Covariates for assessing variability in PK were formulation,
dose, age, sex, weight (WT), lean body weight (LBW) and
height. In this study, LBW was calculated according to the
method of Janmahasatian et al. (23).
Samples and Assays
A rich sampling design was used in all dose groups.
Capillary blood samples were collected before and every
15 min after the drink until the blood concentrations had
returned to pre-drink concentrations of BHB (i.e. 0.1 to
0.2 mmol/L (10.41 to 20.82 mg/L)). For the 291, 395
(Formulation 1) and 500 mg/kg (Formulation 2) groups, the
blood sampling schedule was before and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1,
1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3, 3.25, 3.5, 3.75, 4, 4.25, 4.5,
4.75 and 5 h after the drink. Additional samples were
collected in the 573 mg/kg group (Formulation 1) at 5.25,
5.5, 5.75, 6, 6.25, 6.5, 6.75 and 7 h post-drink. For the 192 mg/
kg group (Formulation 1), the blood sampling schedule was
before and after the drink at 0.08, 0.17, 0.25, 0.33, 0.42, 0.5,
0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75 and 3 h. Samples were
collected from arterialised capillary droplet, either from a
finger or earlobe, and analysed for BHB using FreeStyle
Optium β ketone test strips (Abbott Diabetes Care, UK)
(24). PK observations in this study were limited to BHB, and
other analytes such as AcAc, acetone and precursors of
ketones were not investigated. The lower limit of quantifica-
tion (LLOQ) for BHB in this assay was 10.41 mg/L
(0.1 mmol/L, conversion factor 104.1). The assay is highly
selective for oxidation of BHB and has previously been
validated. The specificity, selectivity, accuracy and precision
of this analytical method have been reported (25,26).
Accuracy of the assay was ranged from 91.4 to 107%, and
precision (% CV) was ranged from 3.2 to 10.5%.
Population PK Modelling
The first-order conditional estimation with interaction
method in NONMEM® version 7.2 was used to model
the
data
(27).
Additive,
exponential
and
combined
(additive + exponential) error models were explored to
describe the residual unexplained variability as shown in

 where yij represents the observed jth concentration in the ith
individual, g is the functional form of the structural model
that predicts the data, Di is the dose administered to the ith
individual, tij represents the jth time point in the ith individual,
θi is the vector of parameter values for the ith individual, ε1;ij
represents the exponential random error and ε2;ij represents
the additive random error. The additive and exponential
errors were assumed to be identically, independently
multivariate, normally distributed with mean of zero and a
diagonal variance-covariance matrix (Σ).
Heterogeneity or between-subject variance in parameter
estimates was assumed to be distributed log normally and was
modelled as shown in Eq. 2:
θip ¼ βp:exp ηip

ð2Þ
θip represents the pth parameter value in ith individual, βp
is the population value for the pth parameter, ηip is the
random effect for pth parameter in the ith individual. Random
effects across the individuals in the population were assumed
to be identically, independently multivariate normally
distributed with means of zero and variance-covariance
matrix (Ω).
Model Development
One, two and three compartment models with extravas-
cular administration were assessed. All models were
parameterised in terms of clearances (CL) and volumes of
distribution (V). Zero-order, first-order absorption and mul-
tiple absorption sites models with and without lag time were
explored for the absorption process. To account for data
below limit of quantitation (BLQ), the M6 method (see
Stuart Beal’s methods to fit models to BLQ data) (28) was
considered. Of note, the M3 method was tried initially but
proved to be unstable (i.e. the model would reach a different
objective function value following small perturbations in the
initial parameter values). Finally, first-order and capacity
limited (Michaelis-Menten kinetics) elimination processes
were explored to describe the elimination of BHB. Basal
concentrations were modelled to account for endogenous
BHB. See B1 method proposed by Dansirikul et al. for
estimation of baseline response (29). Turnover models were
investigated to assess the effect of feedback inhibition on
production of endogenous BHB.
Covariate Analysis
Assessment of covariates in this study was based on a
predefined hierarchy. Covariates for assessment were chosen
based on biological plausibility. Due to (statistical) nonline-
arities inherent in PK models, the order of addition of
covariates can affect their apparent statistical significance;
hence, the order that they were considered is of importance.
The predefined hierarchy based on our a priori belief about
their likely contribution to the model was:
1. Formulation (on relative oral bioavailable fraction
(F), first-order absorption rate constant (ka) and lag
time for oral absorption (ALAG))

3. Important phenotypic covariates such as WT, LBW
(on CL, maximum rate of elimination by capacity
limited pathway (Vmax) and V)
4. Other plausible phenotypic covariates such as age and
sex (on CL, Vmax and V)
Movement between the levels in the hierarchies for
covariates was not allowed meaning a covariate considered at
a specific level was not reconsidered whilst testing other
covariates at lower levels. Within a hierarchy, standard
forward selection and backward elimination were considered
when there was more than one covariate (see Kumar et al. for
similar method used in selection of covariates for Venlafaxine
in overdose) (30).
Continuous covariates were assessed using nested covar-
iate models. All continuous covariates such as dose, LBW and
WT were centred either on their mean value (e.g. for Dose)
or on a nominal value (e.g. 70 kg for WT) in the study as
shown in Eq. 3 (for WT):

where βp is the population value for the pth parameter and
βcov represents the estimated exponent of covariate.
Continuous covariates were assessed by linear and power
relationships. Selection of the covariate was based on
predefined criteria discussed below.
Model Selection and Evaluation
The following criteria were used in selecting models:
i. Stability of the model (i.e. the model would reach the
same objective function value following small pertur-
bations in the initial parameter values).
ii. Significant decrease in the objective function value
(OBJV) i.e. 3.84 units (critical value from the chi-
squared distribution with p ≤ 0.05) for an additional
parameter for nested models based on the likelihood
ratio test (LRT).
iii. Parameter estimates are biologically plausible (e.g.
CL > 0 L/h).
iv. A decrease in the residual unexplained variability.
v. A decrease in the between-subject variance of a
parameter after addition of a covariate.
Amongst the above criteria, the first three were required
and the last two were considered desirable. Finally, models were
evaluated using a visual predictive check (VPC) (31). To
construct a VPC, 1000 datasets were simulated using the model
under evaluation and 10th (lower), 50th (median) and 90th
(higher) percentiles of model predictions were plotted with the
same percentiles of the original data. The percentiles of the
model predictions also include the 95% confidence intervals
around the model-predicted percentiles. For creating
prediction-corrected VPCs, median predictions in each bin were
used to normalise the observed and simulated concentrations in
that bin (32). All VPCs were created in R (ver 3.0.2; The R
project for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
RESULTS
Model Development
A one compartment disposition model was shown to
describe the data well and was preferred over the other
compartmental models that were considered. Residual vari-
ability was best described by a combined error model.
Endogenous basal concentrations were modelled as approx-
imately 68% of the total pre-drink samples were either equal
to or greater than LLOQ of the assay for BHB. Estimation of
the steady state basal value (BSL) in the model significantly
decreased the OBJV (25 units, p ≤ 0.05). BLQ data (blood
concentrations less than 10.41 mg/L (0.1 mmol/L)) were
modelled by the M6 method, where the first missing
concentration was replaced by half of BLQ (5.21 mg/L
(0.05 mmol/L)), and the remaining missing data omitted from
the dataset. Exploration of the diagnostic plots (see
Supplemental Fig. S1 online) revealed that formulation and
dose greatly influenced the exposure and both were found
to be statistically significant when included in the model
prior to finalisation of the structural model (see covariate
analysis below). Hence, a base model (structural model
without any covariates) does not exist in this study. To
study the influence on absorption, dose was included as
covariate on the extent of absorption (on the relative oral
bioavailable fraction ‘F’) and the rate of absorption via a
dose-dependent fraction being absorbed from second/slow
input site (fslow site).
Elimination of BHB was found to be nonlinear as
shown by an apparent convexity in the terminal phase in
the log concentration-time plots (see Supplemental Fig. S2
online), and inclusion of this process as a Michaelis-
Menten equation in the model resulted in a significant
drop in the OBJV (589 units, p ≤ 0.05). Finally, dual
elimination processes (first-order and Michaelis-Menten)
provided the best fit to the data (a further drop in OBJV
by 63 units, p ≤ 0.05). A negative feedback process on
endogenous ketogenesis was considered as a turnover
model and was expressed in the ordinary differential
equations (Eq. 4) shown later.
Diagnostic plots revealed that greater than 50% of the
individuals showed multiple peaks in the profiles (see
Supplemental Fig. S3 online). Subjects from higher dose
groups showed flattening of the concentration-time profiles
at around
the time
of maximum
concentration (see
Supplemental Fig. S2 and S3 online). In order to explore
the influence of possible absorption profiles in the model,
deterministic simulations were performed (see Supplemental
Fig. S4 online) in MATLAB® (ver R2012a; The MathWorks
Inc., MA, US). These simulated profiles were compared with
the empirical data. Dual first-order input (fast and slow
absorption sites) with linear dose effect on f slowsite showed
similar trends to the observations in the empirical data.
Inclusion of this absorption process significantly improved
the model fit (drop in OBJV by 58 units, p ≤ 0.05), which
was superior to parallel and sequential mixed order
absorption models. Inclusion of lag time on input from
slow absorption site further improved the model fit (drop
in OBJV by 8 units, p ≤ 0.05). The final model is shown as
a schematic in Fig. 1.

Population Pharmacokinetics of D-β-Hydroxybutyrate
 Covariate Analysis
Formulation on F (drop in OBJV by 19 units, p ≤ 0.05)
and dose on F and f slowsite (drop in OBJV by 61 units,
p ≤ 0.05) were included as covariates prior to the finalisation
of the structural model. Formulation was also found to have a
significant influence on the first-order absorption rate con-
stant from the fast input site (ka
fastsite), but not on the
absorption rate constant from the slow input site (ka slowsite)
or the lag time for absorption from slow input site
(ALAGslowsite). The effect of LBW on CL was modelled by
a power function, and adding this covariate resulted in a
61% drop in the between subject variance of CL (drop in
OBJV by 14 units p ≤ 0.05). The estimated exponent for
LBW on CL of 2.09 was significantly different from the
commonly accepted value of the allometric exponent
(0.75).
Neither
WT
nor
LBW
was
found
to
have
significant influence on Vmax or V. Sex was found to be
an influential covariate on V (21% drop in the between
subject variance and a 5-unit drop in OBJV (p ≤ 0.05),
and females had a lower volume of distribution (0.77
fractions of the volume of distribution in males).

where, A1 and A2 correspond to amounts in fast and
slow input sites, respectively, A3 corresponds to the
amount in the measured compartment (blood) from
exogenous administration, A4 corresponds to the amount
of BHB in blood related to endogenous ketone produc-
tion. Note that the ester is converted rapidly to BHB via
enzymatic reactions in the gut and the systemic circula-
tion. The blood BHB concentration is sum of exogenous
(C3) and endogenous (C4) BHB concentrations, Rin is the
rate of production (in mg/h) of endogenous BHB, INT is
the
intercept
and
SLP
is
the
slope
of
the
linear
prediction in the function that shows negative feedback
effect on endogenous production (drop in OBJV by 30
units, p ≤ 0.05). A negative feedback, Emax model was
also tested; however, an expit was used for this process
based on statistical criterion (smaller OBJV). The final
population PK model with covariates is shown in Fig. 1.
Although, biologically, the total drug (Ctotal = C3 + C4) is
the driving force for feedback inhibition, a simplifying
initial steady-state assumption was made in modelling the
data that the steady state-production rate and elimination
rate (product of the elimination rate constant and the
amount of BHB in endogenous compartment (A4)) were
equal.
When
we
make
this
assumption,
the
initial
condition for feedback/endogenous compartment in the
absence of exogenously administered ketone simplifies to
the ratio of Rin and kout. Therefore, the ODE for the
endogenous compartment then simplifies to (under no
feedback effect) as shown in Eq. 5:

Model estimated population parameters from the final
PK model are presented in Table II. The relative standard
error (% RSE) for all fixed effect parameters other than
slope and intercept of the linear function in the negative
feedback model and coefficient of dose on F were ≤ 50%.
The CV% for all random effects parameters, except the
random effects on BSL, was less than 50%.

 The goodness-of-fit plots for the final population PK
model are presented in Fig. 2. The plots indicate that the
model described the data well. Good agreement was seen
between observed versus population-predicted concentrations
and observed versus individual-predicted concentrations,
indicating a good fit with the data clustered around the line of
identity. No systematic trends suggesting model misspecification
were observed in residual plots and ε-shrinkage (33) was less
than 10%.
Figure 3 presents the prediction-corrected VPC for
the final model based on 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles
of the observed and predicted concentrations of BHB.
The lower and median percentiles of the model prediction
showed good agreement with the observed data. The
model
prediction
was
slightly
higher
at
the
upper
percentile compared to the observed data, although the
95% confidence interval around this prediction interval
includes the observed percentile. Overall, VPCs show that
the final population PK model was able to represent the
data well.
VPCs across the dose levels tested in the study are
presented in Fig. 4. Good agreement of the model prediction
was observed with the data across the lower-dose groups
(Fig. 4a to 4c) except the median prediction for the 291 mg/kg
dose group (Fig. 4b). In the case of higher-dose groups,
model prediction showed good agreement with the data at
lower and median percentiles. Though there was slight over
prediction at upper percentiles in higher-dose groups, the
model was able to capture the trend of double peaks (Fig. 4d
and 4e).

complex
absorption processes involving multiple absorption sites,
nonlinear and linear elimination and feedback mechanisms
affecting endogenous production.
Literature evidence related to the metabolism of the
ketone monoester after oral ingestion and information on
endogenous ketogenesis were collated and presented as a
schematic in Fig. 5. The ketone monoester is known to
undergo
enzymatic
hydrolysis
by
carboxylesterases
expressed throughout the gut wall, liver, blood and other
tissues (14). One of the resulting products of ester
breakdown, butane-1,3-diol, then undergoes sequential
stepwise oxidation by alcohol dehydrogenase and alde-
hyde dehydrogenase in the liver to produce BHB (34).
Conversion of BHB to other ketones in the liver and
further utilisation in the extra hepatic tissues is similar to
the endogenous pathway of ketogenesis (16) and ketolysis
(17). Circulating ketones are usually taken up either by
extra hepatic tissues to be utilised as an energy source or
excreted unchanged by the kidneys or as acetone in the
lungs. This schematic represents the likely complexity
associated with the PK of BHB. Although the mechanism
of ketone monoester breaks down in vivo is understood, it
was
not
possible
in
this
study
to
develop
a
more
mechanistic population model due to lack of data of
other ketone forms.
Multiple peaks in the profiles of some subjects (see
Supplemental Fig. S3 online) and an apparent flattening of
the concentration-time profiles in higher-dose groups (see
Supplemental Fig. S2 online) suggest the presence of a
multiple spacial and/or temporal aspects to absorption. The
shape of the concentration-time profiles of BHB was compa-
rable to γ-hydroxybutyate, a substrate of monocarboxylate

Population Pharmacokinetics of D-β-Hydroxybutyrate
 transport (MCT) proteins (35). Possible mechanisms could
include multiple absorption sites, the formation of tempo-
rary poorly soluble complexes, or enterohepatic circula-
tion (although, given the low molecular weight of BHB
(104.1 Da), this mechanism may be unlikely). The data in
this study were unable to delineate potential mechanisms.
A
major
portion
of
the
administered
monoester
is
expected to be absorbed as BHB by an active process
involving MCTs, which are expressed throughout the gut
wall (36). Expression of these transport proteins (MCT1
on the apical side, MCT4 and MCT5 on the basolateral
side) has been shown to vary, potentially increasing, along
the length of the colon (37). Substrate affinity and
capacity of these transporters vary widely, and it is
expected that saturation of these transporters at different
sites will occur at different times, depending on pH and
concentration of BHB at specific site (38,39). Variability in
expression of transport proteins across the length of the
gut supports the dual input sites for BHB in this model.
Further studies are required to understand the absorption
mechanisms of BHB.
Elimination of BHB appears to be complicated, and
modelling the processes suggested quantitatively that at
least two dominant mechanisms (first-order and capacity
limited elimination) contribute to its overall metabolism
and excretion. Literature reported processes for elimi-
nation of ketones include (1) irreversible conversion of
AcAc to acetone (via decarboxylation) in the blood and
the liver, to be excreted from the lungs, (2) renal
elimination
of
unchanged
BHB
and
AcAc,
which
escape tubular reabsorption in the kidneys (18) and (3)
uptake and consumption to produce energy (ATP) via
the citric acid cycle in peripheral tissues such as the
brain, skeletal muscle and heart (40). These known
mechanisms of consumption and elimination support
the quantitatively different mechanisms of elimination
that
were
observed
for
BHB
here.
Under
normal
conditions, when the concentrations of circulating blood
ketones are low (< 0.5 mmol/L (< 52.05 mg/L)), it is
expected that elimination would follow a first-order
process (concentrations being less than the empirical
km of 52.7 mg/L, found in this study), whereas under

around each percentile from the model predictions
 moderate ketotic conditions (> 0.5 mmol/L (> 52.05 mg/L)),
a mixed-order picture may become apparent. Tissue
uptake of ketones is mainly facilitated by MCT proteins.
This
uptake
is
saturable
in
some
tissues
when
the
circulating blood ketone concentrations are high (41).
The estimate of V in this study (population mean value,
12.5 L) was comparable to the literature-reported value
(10 L) following intravenous administration using tracer
compound (20). The maximum clearance (i.e. sum of first-
order
(CL)
and
maximum
rate
of
capacity
limited
elimination (Vmax/km)) observed in this study (96.7 L/h)
were comparable to literature-reported clearance of BHB
(112 L/h) that was estimated following intravenous ad-
ministration of the tracer compound (20,21).
One of the factors that adds to the complexity of the
PK of BHB is the endogenous production. The liver of a
healthy adult is capable of producing up to 185 g of
ketones (BHB + AcAc) per day during prolonged starva-
tion (6). Normal production of ketones following an
overnight fast in healthy adults is in the order of 30 to
60 g/day (22). Internal factors, such as pathophysiological
conditions, and external factors, such as diet and intensity
of physical work, influence the endogenous production.
This can lead to highly variable basal concentrations of
BHB across individuals. Endogenous input was included
in the model to account for endogenous basal concentra-
tions of BHB. Our estimate of the basal concentration for
BHB in this study, 7.23 mg/L (0.07 mmol/L), was close to
the literature reported value of 12.5 mg/L (0.12 mmol/L)
(22). It is known from the literature that endogenous
ketone
production
is
suppressed
during
the
post-
absorptive phase, is affected by glucagon:insulin system,
and by circulating blood ketones concentrations of > 3 to
5 mmol/L (6,42). Inclusion of negative feedback effects of
circulating BHB on endogenous input improved the fit of the
model. Occurrence of relatively large amounts of BLQ
data, corresponding to approximately 13% of the total
data,
in
the
terminal
phase
indicated
that
negative
feedback occurred in this study. Although mechanistically
plausible and statistically significant (as observed in this
study), the estimates of negative feedback effect (SLP and
INT) had relatively poor precision in this study, and
further studies are needed to confirm the quantitative
mechanisms of feedback on production. We emphasise
that the mechanism of feedback in this study needs to be
interpreted with caution and requires further work to
substantiate the process.
In the population PK model, it was observed that
formulation affected F and kafastsite and dose affected F
and f slowsite. The estimate of covariate effect of dose on
F had relatively poor precision (% RSE 144). This could
be due to small sample size in this study, and it needs to
be addressed in future studies with sufficiently large
population. In total, five dose levels (four with the
citrus-flavoured
drink
and
one
with
the
chocolate
milkshake meal replacement
preparation) were
used
(Table I). The citrus-flavoured sports water was a less
viscous preparation compared to the chocolate milkshake

 meal replacement preparation. The chocolate milkshake
was also larger in volume and contained fat, carbohy-
drate
and
proteins.
Differences
between
these
two
formulations resulted in greater than 50% difference in
exposure (estimate of F was 0.37 for chocolate milkshake
meal replacement preparation compared to the citrus-
flavoured drink). It was found that the fraction absorbed
from
the
slow
input
site
was
dose-dependent
and
increased with the dose administered. Other influential
covariates were LBW and sex. The effect of LBW on
first-order
clearance
was
not
unexpected
since
lean
tissues are considered to be a major source of metabo-
lism of BHB and hence LBW is a direct measure of
metabolic
potential.
The
high
value
for
the
power
coefficient (2.09) of LBW on first-order clearance should
be reconfirmed in future studies with a larger population
size. The mechanism for the influence of sex on V is
unclear, as a size difference between males and females
would be expected to be identified by LBW. This needs
to be tested in future studies to determine a mechanism
for this finding or to show that this finding is a statistical
artefact of the data.
CONCLUSION
The population PK model for BHB developed in this
study provided an acceptable description of the current data.
It was found that the PK of BHB is complicated, and more
work to determine and quantify mechanisms of absorption
and elimination are required in future studies. Overall, this
study forms an initial understanding of the mechanisms
related to PK disposition of BHB.
Fig. 5. Schematic representation of ketone monoester catabolism in vivo. Solid continuous arrows represent mass transfer/reaction/
production, dashed arrows represent feedback process (negative sign next to the dashed arrows represents inhibitory feedback process)
and wiggly arrows represent transduction process. Ketone monoester, upon oral ingestion is hydrolysed to butane-1,3-diol and BHB by
carboxylesterases expressed throughout the gastrointestinal tract, liver and in blood. Butane-1,3-diol is oxidised sequentially, to produce
3-hydroxybutanal and BHB in the liver and blood. BHB is further metabolised to produce other ketones, namely, AcAc and acetone
in the liver and blood. Endogenous ketones are produced in the form of AcAc in the liver from metabolism of fatty acids (breakdown
products of phospholipids and triglycerides in the adipose tissue). Ketones in the blood circulation are taken up by extra hepatic
tissues such as the brain, kidney, skeletal muscle and heart where they are used as energy source to produce ATP via citric acid cycle.
Excess ketones in the blood that are not taken by tissues are either exhaled from lungs in the form of acetone or excreted as BHB
and AcAc from the kidneys
