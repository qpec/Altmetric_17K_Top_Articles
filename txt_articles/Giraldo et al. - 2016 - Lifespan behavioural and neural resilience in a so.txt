Analyses of senescence in social species are important to understanding how
group living influences the evolution of ageing in society members. Social
insects exhibit remarkable lifespan polyphenisms and division of labour,
presenting excellent opportunities to test hypotheses concerning ageing and
behaviour. Senescence patterns in other taxa suggest that behavioural per-
formance in ageing workers would decrease in association with declining
brain functions. Using the ant Pheidole dentata as a model, we found that
120-day-old minor workers, having completed 86% of their laboratory lifespan,
showed no decrease in sensorimotor functions underscoring complex tasks
such as alloparenting and foraging. Collaterally, we found no age-associated
increases in apoptosis in functionally specialized brain compartments or
decreases in synaptic densities in the mushroom bodies, regions associa-
ted with integrative processing. Furthermore, brain titres of serotonin and
dopamine—neuromodulators that could negatively impact behaviour through
age-related declines—increased in old workers. Unimpaired task performance
appears to be based on the maintenance of brain functions supporting olfaction
and motor coordination independent of age. Our study is the first to compre-
hensively assess lifespan task performance and its neurobiological correlates
and identify constancy in behavioural performance and the absence of
significant age-related neural declines.
1. Introduction
Evolutionary theories of senescence predict behavioural declines in old age [1–3]
in association with physiological and genetic processes that deteriorate over the
lifespan [4,5]. Ageing nervous systems may functionally decline, leading to sen-
sory and motor deficits [6,7] due to neurodegeneration, manifest as apoptosis
(programmed cell death), which may increase with age [8], disease [9] or devel-
opment [10]. Few studies have examined the influence of sociality on ageing
and life history [11–13], and little is understood about cognitive decline and neu-
robiological changes accompanying senescence in social animals, apart from
humans [12,14–16]. Social insects have striking lifespan polyphenisms [17–20]:
queens often live more than a decade, whereas workers may live only several
months [21], indicating that the differentiation of reproductive and sterile castes
has had profound effects on senescence, which may be influenced by the social
organization of colony labour. The relationship of task performance to age-related
changes in the worker brain, however, is not well understood.
The ant Pheidole dentata has served as a model to explore the evolution and
ecology of social structure, as well as the neurobiological underpinnings of age-
related worker behaviour [22–27]. Minor workers expand their task repertoires
from eclosion to approximately three weeks of age [23] while their brains undergo
synaptic remodelling [28] and serotonergic systems that influence behavioural

 development and task performance mature [25,29–31]. How
do workers age behaviourally, and do age-related and brain-
based neuroanatomical and neurochemical changes occur
that could negatively impact lifespan task performance?
Using individuals of known age and robust and comprehen-
sive assays to quantify effectiveness of task performance in
minor workers, we tested the hypothesis that behavioural per-
formance declines across the P. dentata minor worker lifespan
in association with age-related patterns of apoptosis and cellu-
lar modifications in synaptic complexes considered significant
to sensory processing, integration and motor control, and thus
behavioural efficacy [32,33]. In addition, we quantified levels of
neuromodulators known to influence neural structure and sig-
nalling [34] that could alter circuit function in an age-dependent
manner to regulate task performance or alter other physio-
logical processes associated with ageing. We predicted that if
workers functionally senesce, nursing and foraging perform-
ance should decrease, and sensory and motor processes
regulating worker responsiveness to social signals and cues
that guide these tasks should covary with age-related neuro-
biological declines. We localized cell death in functionally
specialized brain compartments—the optic lobes (OL; vision),
antennal lobes (AL; olfaction), mushroom bodies (MB; inte-
gration, learning and memory), central complex (CC; motor
response and integration), suboesophageal zone (SEZ; control
of mouthparts) and the remainder of the central brain (RCB)
[35]—to quantify neural changes that could underscore senes-
cence and impact task performance. We hypothesized that
apoptosis in the brain would increase with age, and the density
of synaptic complexes of microglomeruli (MG) associated with
cognitive function [33,36] would decrease prior to or concurrent
with age-related declines in task performance. Finally, we pre-
dicted that brain biogenic amine titres, notably serotonin (5HT)
and dopamine (DA), would decrease as workers aged and com-
promise the functionality of systems under neuromodulatory
control, as well as neuroplasticity [37,38].
2. Material and methods
(a) Ant husbandry
Colonies of P. dentatawere collected in and around Alachua County,
Florida, and reared in Harris environmental chambers maintained
at 258C and 40–55% relative humidity and cultured as described
in Seid et al. [28]. Subcolonies with minors of known age were estab-
lished with 40–70 pupae within 72 h of eclosion, the queen, brood
and approximately 150 marked workers. Workers were sampled
from subcolonies derived from five to 15 parent colonies and
assigned haphazardly to assays; numbers of subcolonies are pro-
vided for each assay below. Details of subcolony establishment
and markingare provided inthe electronic supplementary material.
Minor workers of known ages (20–22, 45–47, 95–97 and 120–122
days) were selected for behavioural analyses that encompass the
breadth of the minor worker repertoire [22,23]. Workers reared in
our queenright subcolonies live up to 140 days; because few
workers survived to 120 days, sample sizes were smaller at this
age than for other worker ages due to the diminishing return on
attempting to acquire samples of very old workers.
(b) Behavioural assays
(i) Nursing effort
Nursing ability was assayed in a cylindrical chamber (34 mm
inner diameter) with a humidified plaster-like bottom (dental
stone) to prevent larvae from desiccating. Sides were coated
with Fluonw to prevent escape. Eight 2nd to 4th instar larvae
with dark guts were added to the chamber and evenly distribu-
ted along the circumference of a 20 mm circle. A cover bisected
by a 10 mm diameter tube was placed over the chamber, and a
single minor worker was introduced to the central tube using
featherweight forceps. After the worker acclimated for 5 min,
the lid was gently removed, allowing access to larvae. Responses
were recorded for 20 min using a Canon FS400 digital camcorder
placed above the assay chamber. The number and duration of
approaches and acts to larvae were scored manually using
JWatcher Video (www.jwatcher.ucla.edu) by an observer blind
to the age of the ant (N ¼ 13, 16, 17, 6 for 20-, 45-, 95- and
120-day-old ants, respectively, from 10 subcolonies). We quantified
the number of times a worker approached, carried, fed, piled or
otherwise provided care to larvae and recorded the duration of
feeding, carrying and unspecified brood-directed behaviour,
which could include licking or other manipulation of brood
items. Details are provided in the electronic supplementary
material. Two-way x2 was used for brood-care act frequencies,
and two-way ANOVA was used for durations to test for effects of
age, differences in frequencies and durations of behaviours and
interaction effects. Statistical analyses were performed in JMPw.
(ii) Pheromone trail-following ability
To determine if workers experienced age-related declines in sen-
sorimotor functions associated with the perception of trail
pheromone and trail-following ability, individual ants were pre-
sented with artificial pheromone trails at concentrations of 1, 0.1
or 0.01 poison glands per trail [25]. Minor workers did not follow
trails at 0.001 glands per trail. Details are provided in the elec-
tronic supplementary material. We video recorded each assay
of worker responsiveness to an artificial trail and subsequent
orientation using a Canon FS400 digital camcorder for 5 min
and used Ctrax [39] to quantify worker movement. Worker age
was masked with a random number so that analyses were con-
ducted blind. Trail following was assessed by tracking activity
within and outside a 1 cm diameter annulus digitally drawn
along the chemical trail to estimate the active space of the
pheromone. Annulus size was determined conservatively after
observing numerous occurrences of trail-following behaviour.
Using larger annuli did not significantly affect results (data not
shown). Of the twenty-three 95-day-old minors sampled, six were
raised in a subcolony lacking a queen. These ants were not signifi-
cantly different in any trail-following metrics than age-matched
workers from queenright subcoloniestested at the same pheromone
concentrations, and data were therefore pooled.
Trail-following metrics—mean deviation from the trail axis
(accuracy), duration and distance of following activity within
the annulus, and mean and maximum duration and distance of
individual following bouts—were used to quantify the inte-
gration of sensory and motor activity. Details are provided in
the electronic supplementary material. We tested 20- and 95-
day-old minors using pheromone concentrations of 1.0, 0.1 and
0.01 gland per trail (20-day: N ¼ 7, 10, 7; 95-day: N ¼ 7, 9, 7 for
1.0, 0.1 and 0.01 gland/trail trail-pheromone concentration
(TPC), respectively, sampled from seven subcolonies). Accuracy,
duration, distance, mean and maximum distance and duration of
individual following bouts were analysed using a two-way
ANOVA for age and pheromone concentration in JMP; to correct
for multiple tests, a false-discovery rate (FDR) correction was
applied [40].
(iii) Worker predatory behaviour
Ants were isolated for 2 min in a small Fluon-lined Petri dish. A live
fruit fly, tethered by its wings or abdomen end with fine watch-
makers forceps affixed to a small platform, was then introduced
rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org
Proc. R. Soc. B 283: 20152603
2
 into the arena. Only flies that responded to touch with movement
were used. Each ant was assigned a random number, and worker
response was video recorded for 2 min. Predatory response by
the worker was scored on a four-point scale: 1: no aggression, 2:
mandible flaring, 3: latent attack (delayed or not sustained for the
duration of the assay), 4: attack. Because this assay was scored pre-
liminarily in real time, it was not always possible to record
responses blind to the age of the ant, for instance, if only one age
was being tested on a day. However, videos that did not involve
immediate and consistent attack, which was unambiguous, were
reviewed at a later date by a blinded observer. Chi-square tests
were performed in JMP to examine the effect of age (N ¼ 59, 41,
34, 17 for each age group from 20 to 120 days from 15 subcolonies)
on predatory response.
(c) Age-related changes in neuroanatomy
(i) Measurement of apoptosis in the brain
Brains of minor workers aged 20–22 or 95–97 days were selected
for analysis by Tdt-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelling
(TUNEL). TUNEL identifies fragmented DNA characteristic of
apoptotic cell death [41] and serves as a primary method for
identification of apoptosis in a variety of tissues [42,43]. Negative
controls, brain tissue not treated with the active TUNEL enzyme,
terminal transferase, were generated according to manufacturer
instructions (Roche In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein,
Cat. no. 11 684 795 910). For positive controls, we adapted pro-
cedures developed for Drosophila to confirm assay function in
Pheidole brains. Workers of unknown age were selected for posi-
tive controls and were briefly cold immobilized and then
impaled in the head with a metal pin (0.1 mm diameter, Fine
Science Tools), between the mandibles and into the brain. Injured
ants were maintained in groups with food and water for 16–20 h
prior to dissection. TUNEL reactions were performed according
to manufacturer instructions, vibratome sectioned at 100 mm,
incubated with DAPI and mounted in 80% glycerol. Details are
provided in the electronic supplementary material. All control
brain sections were imaged on an Olympus FluoVieww 10i con-
focal microscope using a 10� objective. TUNEL-positive cells
were confirmed using a 60� objective and examination of
nuclear morphology. A set of controls and experimental brains
was processed at one time; all brains were discarded from any
set in which positive or negative controls failed for a total of
22 usable brains (N ¼ 12, 10 for 20 and 95 days from six subco-
lonies). Known-age ant brain sections were scanned in entirety
with a 60� objective using 2 mm optical sections.
Brains were assigned a random number and images were
analysed manually using FLUOVIEWw software (FV10-ASW v. 3.0
Viewer) by an observer blind to worker age. TUNEL-positive cells
were identified visually by their brightly fluorescent cell bodies.
In some instances, only a portion of the nucleus appeared
TUNEL-positive. Apoptosis was confirmed by observing nuclear
morphology: apoptotic nuclei often show enhanced DNA conden-
sation [44]. Cells identified as apoptotic were TUNEL-positive,
co-localized with a nucleus and exhibited atypical nuclear mor-
phology. Cells were counted and categorized according to the
nearest neuropil. Although we could not always be certain that
cell bodies projected to an adjacent neuropil region, our method
reasonably estimated brain compartment variation in cell death.
To compare the frequency of apoptosis between functional
brain regions that differ in volume and cell number, we
employed an unbiased stereological approach to estimate total
cell number. Volumes were measured directly on a subset of
brains by an experimenter blind to brain age, and means for
each age group calculated. Apoptosis was then scaled to total
cell number in each brain region. Cell number per region was
estimated using an optical disector [45] on one brain of each
age group and extrapolated for other brains. We were thus able
to calculate the proportion of apoptotic cells across age groups
and brain regions. Proportions of apoptotic cells (number of
apoptotic cells/estimated cell number) were calculated for each
brain region. Because the total number of cells per region is
large relative to the total number of apoptotic cells, small
errors in total cell estimation have negligible effects on results.
A mixed-effects ANOVA was run in SPSS to test for effects of
age, brain region and age � brain region interaction effects on
the log-transformed proportion of apoptotic cells with age as a
between-subjects factor and brain region as a within-subject
factor. Differences between brain regions were identified using
pairwise comparisons and Bonferroni corrections. Details are
provided in the electronic supplementary material.
(ii) Quantification of microglomeruli in the mushroom body lip
MG,
synaptic
complexes
characterized
by
a
synapsin-
immunoreactive presynaptic bouton surrounded by a halo of
phalloidin-labelled postsynaptic terminals, were immunohisto-
chemically labelled in 20- and 95-day-old minors (N ¼ 28, 18
from 14 subcolonies) following the protocols of Groh et al. [46].
Details are provided in the electronic supplementary material.
To quantify age-related changes in MG densities, the imaging
plane where the peduncle completely bisects the calyx and the
collar is maximally visible was selected because it could be
easily identified across samples. We thus minimized potential
spatial effects by selecting approximately the same location. All
images were taken using an Olympus FluoView 10i confocal
microscope with a 60� objective and analysed blind to brain
age in IMAGEJ [47]. Global adjustments were made to brightness
and
contrast
in
single-channel
images,
which
were
then
merged and pseudocoloured to count MG in two circles
(400 mm diameter each) drawn over the lip region. Details of
placement and counting criteria are provided in the electronic
supplementary material. Mean counts per calyx (lateral or
medial) and means of both calyces were analysed with a one-
way ANOVA. Counts were converted to MG per mm3 using
calyx neuropil measurements from Muscedere & Traniello [31].
(d) Quantification of biogenic amines
Biogenic amine titres of individual brains were measured using
high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical
detection as described in Muscedere et al. [25] by an experimenter
blind to worker age. Details are provided in the electronic sup-
plementary material. Volume measurements of the rind, the
outer region of the brain where cell bodies are located, in 20- and
95-day-old minors show no significant differences with age;
neuropil volumes would be expected to show similar patterns.
Therefore, it was not necessary to correct for brain size. Eleven of
98 minor workers sampled for our assessment of amine titres
across age and social role were from a colony lacking a queen.
Neither 5HT nor DA titres in these workers differed significantly
from titres of age-matched minors from queenright colonies;
data were therefore pooled. Amine titres are reported in pg/
brain for workers from 13 subcolonies (5HT: N ¼ 23, 31, 18, 14,
DA: N ¼ 23, 29, 17, 13 for each age group from 20 to 120 days).
Octopamine titres were not measured because levels of this mono-
amine are very low and do not change with age from eclosion to
20 days in P. dentata, a period during which 5HT and DA titres
both significantly increase [29]. Effects of age on amine titres
were tested with an ANOVA in JMP and significant differences
between groups determined with Tukey’s post hoc test.
(e) Power analysis
To be confident that negative results biologically reflected lack-
of-age effects, we performed retrospective power analyses
using
suggested
effect
sizes

Cohen
([48];

 [49–51]). Power, expressed as a proportion ranging from 0 to 1,
reflects the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis
[49] and therefore the ability to detect a statistically significant
result. Power greater than 0.8 is generally considered sufficient
to detect a specified effect size [48]. We used standardized
effect sizes to estimate the power of our analyses and hence
our ability to detect significance. For TUNEL analysis, we calcu-
lated power using a simulation method for an effect size of 0.5 as
well as 2.5, which we found between brain regions. A 2.5-fold
difference between ages was used as benchmark for detecting
apoptotic cells in association with negligible senescence [52]
and an effect size of approximately 2.5 was found for age-related
changes in MG density [53]. Our effect sizes of 0.3 and 0.5 are
thus conservative. All other tests had power of minimally 0.77
for an effect size of 0.5. We are thus confident that we could
detect effects of relevant size in all assays. All power analyses
were conducted in PASS14 (NCSS Statistical Software, Kaysville,
UT, USA).
3. Results
(a) Task performance
We measured the efficacy of tasks performed within and out-
side the nest that comprise the breadth of the P. dentata minor
worker repertoire at four ages: 20–22, 45–47, 95–97 and
120–122 days. Laboratory mortality of minors is 50% at
77 days and 25% at 117 days (Kaplan–Meier survival
estimate), with a maximum lifespan of 140 days.
(i) Nursing effort
Behavioural components of nursing involving sensory and
motor functions did not significantly vary with worker age
and the frequencies of behaviours were not significantly
different
from
each
other
(two-way
x2
test;
age:
x2
150 ¼ 7:53 � 10�6, p ¼ 1.00; behaviour: x2
200 ¼ 0:00011, p ¼
1.00; age � behaviour: x2
600 ¼ 2:54, p ¼ 1.00; 20, 45, 95 and
120 days: N ¼ 13, 16, 17, 6, figure 1a). Durations of unspeci-
fied brood-directed behaviour, feeding and carrying did not
change with age and workers spent significantly more time
providing unspecified brood-directed behaviour than feeding
(two-way ANOVA; age: F3,144¼ 0.398, p ¼ 0.755; behaviour:
F2,144¼ 6.542,
p ¼ 0.0019;
age � behaviour:
F6,144¼ 0.557,
p ¼ 0.764, N ¼ 13, 16, 17, 6; Tukey’s post hoc, figure 1b;
power ¼ 0.942 and 0.366, respectively, for 0.5 and 0.3
effect sizes).
(ii) Responsiveness to social signals regulating foraging and
other collective actions
We examined the impact of worker age on fundamental sen-
sorimotor functions (olfactory responsiveness, motor activity
and motion coordination) and thus the ability of workers to
participate in cooperative foraging by quantifying osmotropo-
tactic pheromone-trail following. Neither worker age nor TPC
significantly affected trail-following accuracy, without an inter-
action effect (two-way ANOVA, F1,41 ¼ 1.444; age: p ¼ 0.2104;
TPC: F2,41 ¼ 2.995, p ¼ 0.1895; age � TPC: F2,41 ¼ 0.903, p ¼
0.4809, all FDR corrected; 20-day N ¼ 7, 10, 7; 95-day N ¼ 7,
9, 7 for 1.0, 0.1 and 0.01 gland/trail TPC, respectively;
figure 1d). Duration within the active space of pheromone
was not significantly affected by age and there was no signifi-
cant effect of TPC or interaction effect (two-way ANOVA, age:
F1,41 ¼ 4.2404, p ¼ 0.1607; TPC: F2,41 ¼ 1.899, p ¼ 0.20; age �
TPC: F2,41 ¼ 0.4644, p ¼ 0.6318; all p-values are FDR corrected,
figure 1e). Mean and maximum durations of following did not
differ significantly with age or TPC and did not show signifi-
cant interaction effects (two-way ANOVA; age: F1,41 ¼ 0.0132,
TPC: F2,41 ¼ 1.388,
age � TPC: F2,41 ¼ 1.574,
all
p . 0.2).
Older workers followed trails for longer distances and
minors of both ages tended to follow trails for greater distances
at higher concentrations (two-way ANOVA, age: F1,41 ¼ 9.684,
p ¼ 0.0238; TPC: F2,41 ¼ 4.863, p ¼ 0.0889; age � TPC: F2,41 ¼
0.545, p ¼ 0.6318; all p-values FDR corrected, figure 1f;
power ¼ 0.768 and 0.366, respectively, for effect sizes of 0.5
and 0.3 for all trail-following metrics).
(iii) Age-related changes in predatory behaviour
Ageing minors showed no decline in responsiveness to prey
or predatory attack (x2
9 ¼ 7:25, p ¼ 0.61; 20, 45, 95 and 120
days: N ¼ 59, 41, 34, 17, figure 1c; power ¼ 0.977 and 0.728,
respectively, for effects sizes of 0.5 and 0.3).
(b) Age-related neurobiological changes
(i) Minor worker age and distribution of apoptosis in brain
compartments
Across all ages, minor workers had very few apoptotic cells in
all brain regions (figure 2a). The proportion of apoptotic cells
was highly variable and did not differ between 20- and
95-day-old workers. Apoptotic cell counts differed by brain
region (mixed-effects ANOVA, age: F1,78 ¼ 2.570, p ¼ 0.120;
brain region: F5,27.8 ¼ 5.403, p , 0.001; age x brain region:
F5 ¼ 1.974, p ¼ 0.1863; 20 days: N ¼ 11, 7, 9, 8, 9, 11; 95 days:
10, 10, 10, 9, 9, 7 for the MB, AL, OL, CC, RCB and SEZ, respect-
ively, figure 2b). The CC and OLs had a significantly lower
proportion of apoptotic cells than the RCB. For an effect size
of 0.5, power was 0.16 for age, 0.33 for brain region and 0.20
for interaction effect. Assuming an effect size of 2.5, as we
found between the CC and RCB and was the smaller of our
two significant differences, power was 0.79, 1.0 and 1.0 for
age, brain region and age � brain region.
(ii) Density of synaptic complexes
MG density did not significantly change with worker
age
(mean +s.e.,
20
days:
0.0891+0.00179,
95
days:
0.0859+0.00224 MG mm23 of calyx, N ¼ 28, 18; ANOVA,
F1,44 ¼ 1.211, p ¼ 0.28, figure 2c; power ¼ 0.9125 and 0.512
for effect sizes of 0.5 and 0.3, respectively).
(iii) Brain titres of dopamine and serotonin
Brain 5HT and DA levels significantly increased with age
(ANOVA, 5HT: F3,82 ¼ 10.443, p , 0.0001, N ¼ 23, 31, 18,
14; power ¼ 0.973 and 0.597 for 0.5 and 0.3 effect sizes; DA:
F3,78 ¼ 20.921, p , 0.0001, N ¼ 23, 29, 17, 13; figure 2d;
power ¼ 0.970 and 0.585 for effect sizes of 0.5 and 0.3). 5HT
was significantly higher in brains of 95- and 120-day-old
minors than 20- and 45-day-old minors. DA titre increased
beyond 45 days of age.
4. Discussion
With advancing age, P. dentata minor workers showed no appar-
ent deficits in the suite of behaviours we assayed, no increase in

 performance, and no decline in densities of synaptic structures
considered significant to cognitive ability. In aggregate, our be-
havioural and neurobiological results capture the pattern of
minor worker ageing through comprehensive assays of task per-
formance and suggest negligible senescence throughout at least
85% of the minor worker lifespan. Results of behavioural assays
were consistent with records of low levels of apoptosis through-
out the brain and particularly in the MBs, and ALs, and OLs of
ageing workers. The age-invariance of MG density suggests
olfactory processing abilities remain intact in old age. Extranidal
work involves individual and collective actions requiring orien-
tation and navigation, and the sampling of diverse sensory
environments. Responsiveness to light, which cues the per-
formance of outside-nest work, did not decline with age, and
old minors showed positive phototaxis, providing evidence
that light level discrimination does not senesce (electronic

 supplementary material, figure S1). Our results indicate that old
workers retain the range of sensory abilities necessary to be be-
haviourally pluripotent and switch tasks having different spatial
distributions. Neither the efficacy nor plasticity of task perform-
ance appeared to be compromised in ageing workers. Our
results suggest age-related losses in cell numbers in the brain
were extremely low and thus insignificant, and appear to have
no impact on behavioural functions. Therefore, processing
power underscoring social signal and cue perception and
response appears to be maintained in old workers. The CC
and OLs had lower levels of apoptosis than the RCB, suggesting
that brain regions critically important to information processing
and responsiveness to task stimuli may be particularly buffered
from decline. The CC is being increasingly implicated in
integrative functions as well as motor output [54], and mainten-
ance of the OL neuropil with increasing age could be
particularly important to extranidal task performance. Pheidole
dentata have relatively small eyes and OLs [31] which could con-
tribute to lower levels of redundancy in these circuits and hence
greater importance for their protection. High variability in the

 proportionofapoptoticcellsintheCClikelystemsfromthesmall
number of cells that comprise this region, causing a small absol-
ute change in the number of dying cells to more strongly
influence this proportion. Nevertheless, the CC showed signifi-
cantly lower levels of apoptosis than the RCB. Titres of 5HT—a
neuromodulator significant for olfactory social functions in
P. dentata [25]—and DA increased with age, rather than showing
senescence-associated declines [37,55]. DA can have neuro-
trophic functions, and 5HT and DA may interact to promote
circuit development and neuroplasticity [34] as well as modulate
sensory [56,57] and motor function [58,59], perhaps contributing
to the preservation of task performance in ageing workers. In
sum, we did not identify age-related deficits in behavioural abil-
ities or aminergic or cell deterioration, suggesting that P. dentata
minor workers do not exhibit senescence throughout much of
their lifespan and are able to continue to effectively contribute
to colony labour well into their final weeks of life.
Older P. dentata minors are more efficient at nursing [24]
and show a significantly increased response compared with
young minors (less than approx. 10–15 days of age) to
colony conditions that reflect greater brood-care needs [23].
Our results demonstrate that minor workers retain the olfac-
tory sensitivity required to assess brood welfare and nurture
growth and development, as well as provide motor control to
mouthparts to manipulate delicate eggs and immatures, thus
allowing them to remain effective alloparents late in life.
As in many ant species, olfaction is the predominant sen-
sory modality in P. dentata. Responsiveness to chemical cues
and pheromones can develop with maturity [60] and decline
with senescence [61]. However, results suggest that old
P. dentata minors do not decline in performing foraging or nur-
sing tasks that differ qualitatively in olfactory social cue and
signal arrays. Odorant inputs are transduced to trigger motor
output through the SEZ to control the mouthparts [62] and
thoracic ganglia to direct leg movements [63]. Our assessment
of predation showed no effect of worker age on sensory respon-
siveness to prey or the motor execution of attack. Minors of all
ages did not appear impaired in attack mechanics, including
biting behaviour, suggesting that mandibular muscle functions
and SEZ neuropil appear well maintained with age. Again,
contrary to senescence theory, we found improvements in
trail following and activity level (electronic supplementary
material, figure S1) in ageing minors, suggesting continued
development and/or experience-dependent enhancements
of behaviour into old age. Workers did not decrease in trail-
following accuracy; surprisingly, 95-day minors followed
trails for longer distances than younger individuals, perhaps
due to their higher activity level (electronic supplementary
material, figure S1), enhanced olfactory responsiveness to
trail pheromone, or both. Therefore, older minors not only
did not exhibit senescence, but in fact improved in certain func-
tions, suggesting selection for effective task performance
throughout the lifespan. This does not imply behavioural
specialization by older workers on outside-nest tasks; indeed,
P. dentata do not appear to exhibit strong age-related variation
in worksites [64]. Specialized workers may in fact not be more
efficient in task performance in at least some taxa (Temnothorax
albipennis; [65]). Pharmacological depletion of 5HT in P. dentata
decreases responsiveness to trail-pheromone, likely through
modulation of olfactory sensitivity [25]. Although declining
monoamine titres could cause olfactory and hence behavioural
deficits, 5HT and DA titres increased with age, potentially
enabling olfaction to remain intact.
Social insect workers have been hypothesized to experi-
ence programmed death at an age marginally greater than
their life expectancy in nature [66], implying that task per-
formance abilities either gradually diminish or abruptly
decline with age. Although worker longevity in the field is
not known in P. dentata, it is reasonably anticipated to be
shorter than the 140-day lifespan we recorded in the labora-
tory, given increased worker mortality associated with the
transition to extranidal tasks performed in more unpredict-
able environments [20,67,68]. Although we cannot exclude
the possibility that P. dentata minor workers decline rapidly
just before death, this appears to be unlikely because precipi-
tous senescence [69] is rare and associated with unusually
high investment in reproduction [70], which is absent in ster-
ile workers. The lack of functional senescence in P. dentata
minors contrasts with the rapid ageing exhibited by most
genetic gerontological models [71]. Studies on ageing honey-
bees
are
equivocal
regarding
functional
senescence
in
workers [12,14–16], which do not decline in responsiveness
to light and sucrose, olfactory associative learning or loco-
motion as they age [12]. However, chronological age is only
one factor influencing senescence in honeybees: overwinter-
ing bees, which can be more than six months old, maintain
tactile and olfactory learning but show deficits in olfactory
long-term memory in comparison to chronologically younger
foragers
[72].
Our
behavioural
metrics
encompassed
measures of sensorimotor function similar to those used in
studies of honeybees, as well as efficacy assessments of task
performance inside and outside the nest required to fully
evaluate worker capability in a species that retains a broad
task repertoire throughout the worker lifespan. Such differ-
ences in hymenopteran ageing phenotypes may be related
to the lack of temporal caste discretization in P. dentata
[23,73] and contrasting nesting and foraging ecology.
Eusociality has had profound consequences for the evol-
ution of behavioural development, immune function and
genetic regulation of ageing [17,18,19]. Social interactions
appear to mediate metabolic homeostasis and affect mortality
rates [74]. Division of labour could in part lead to selection for
the maintenance of individual functionality throughout the
sterile worker lifespan [20]. In ants, specialized morphologies
and task performance are key to social complexity; worker
polymorphism, task repertoire development and behavioural
specialization are underscored by brain neuropil growth and
investment patterns [31]. Complex task repertoires are generated
bya miniature brain that even at an extremelysmallsize does not
appear to compromise cognitive ability [75], suggesting that ant
brains mayoperatewith a level of metabolic efficiency that could
enable conserved energy to be distributed to provide molecu-
lar protection against neural and behavioural senescence.
The lack of functional senescence in P. dentata minor workers,
underscored by the maintenance of neuroanatomical and neuro-
chemical substrates that activate and support task performance,
suggests that the ant nervous system has evolved robust func-
tionality throughout the relatively short sterile worker lifespan.
This resilience may be associated with energy savings resulting
from the absence of reproductive costs of workers, reduced
neuron and neural circuit size, and lower requirements for
redundancy and information storage that could minimize
neurometabolic costs in individual worker brains [76–79].
Additionally, the benefits of living in a highly integrated homeo-
static social system capable of collective information processing
and emergent cognition may allocate cost reductions in brain
