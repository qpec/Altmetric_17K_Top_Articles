Purpose
Pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG 20) depletes essential amino acid levels in argininosuccinate
synthetase 1 (ASS1) –negative tumors by converting arginine to citrulline and ammonia. The main
aim of this study was to determine the recommended dose, safety, and tolerability of ADI-PEG 20,
cisplatin, and pemetrexed in patients with ASS1-deficient malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) or
non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Patients and Methods
Using a 3 + 3 + 3 dose-escalation study, nine chemotherapy-na¨
ıve patients (five MPM, four NSCLC)
received weekly ADI-PEG 20 doses of 18 mg/m2, 27 mg/m2, or 36 mg/m2, together with peme-
trexed 500 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 which were given every three weeks (maximum of six
cycles). Patients achieving stable disease or better could continue ADI-PEG 20 monotherapy until
disease progression or withdrawal. Adverse events were assessed by Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03, and pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity were also
evaluated. Tumor response was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
version 1.1 for NSCLC and by modified RECIST criteria for MPM.
Results
No dose-limiting toxicities were reported; nine of 38 reported adverse events (all grade 1 or 2) were
related to ADI-PEG 20. Circulating arginine concentrations declined rapidly, and citrulline levels
increased; both changes persisted at 18 weeks. Partial responses were observed in seven of nine
patients (78%), including three with either sarcomatoid or biphasic MPM.
Conclusion
Target engagement with depletion of arginine was maintained throughout treatment with no dose-limiting
toxicities. In this biomarker-selected group of patients with ASS1-deficient cancers, clinical activity was
observed in patients with poor-prognosis tumors. Therefore, we recommend a dose for future studies of
weekly ADI-PEG 20 36 mg/m2 plus three-weekly cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2.

INTRODUCTION
Standard-of-care first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy
for many patients with advanced malignant pleural
mesothelioma (MPM) and nonsquamous, non–
small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is cisplatin plus
pemetrexed. The overall prognosis for these patients
remains poor despite treatment, and the majority of
patients survive only 12 months.1,2 The develop-
ment of novel treatment approaches is therefore of
paramount importance for these patients.
Arginine is a semi-essential amino acid,
which in normal cells can be synthesized de novo
from citrulline combined with aspartate in the
presence of ATP in the urea cycle, in addition to
direct uptake of extracellular arginine. However,
it has been found that a number of tumor types
(eg, melanoma and prostate and ovarian can-
cers) have abnormalities in arginine synthesis
pathways so that tumor cells are not able to
synthesize arginine de novo and are dependent
on an exogenous supply for growth (termed
arginine auxotrophy).3 Arginine promotes

 tumor growth, and the observation that arginine-depleted feed is
associated with reduced xenograft tumor growth was made in
1930.4 More recently, arginine deprivation studies using selected
in vitro cancer cell lines have reported apoptosis of up to 80% of
cells.5
A key enzyme in the biosynthesis of arginine is arginino-
succinate synthetase 1 (ASS1), which combines citrulline with
asparate to form argininosuccinate. Intratumoral deficiency of
ASS1 has been detected in significant numbers of patients with
cancers including mesothelioma and NSCLC.6,7 Epigenetic
modification via aberrant methylation of the ASS1 pro-
moter is proposed as underlying this deficiency, especially in
mesothelioma.7,8 Importantly, low ASS1 expression is associated
with a more aggressive clinical phenotype and a worse clinical
outcome in several different cancer types.9-12 Moreover, it is
known that patients resistant to the antifolate pemetrexed have
high levels of thymidylate synthase and low levels of ASS1.11
Indeed, recent work indicates that low ASS1 promotes the di-
version of aspartate for pyrimidine synthesis and enhanced
tumor-cell proliferation.13 Thus, it is noteworthy that patients
selected on the basis of low ASS1 expression are likely to be
a cohort with worse prognosis and a poor response to currently
used chemotherapy regimens.
Arginine deiminase catalyzes the conversion of arginine to
citrulline, thereby depleting the former in ASS1-deficient tumor
cells. Because the addition of polyethylene glycol to arginine
deiminase increases bioavailability and decreases immunoge-
nicity, pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG 20) was de-
veloped for clinical use.14 ADI-PEG 20 was well tolerated in early
clinical trials as a single agent with promising biologic activity
including for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic
melanoma, and mesothelioma.15-20 More recently, we showed, we
believe for the first time, that single agent ADI-PEG 20 signifi-
cantly extended progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with
ASS1-deficient mesothelioma compared with best supportive
care alone (Arginine Deiminase And Mesothelioma [ADAM]
study).8
In preclinical studies, it was shown that the combination of
arginine deprivation (using ADI-PEG 20) and pemetrexed leads to
a potentiation of cytotoxicity in ASS1-negative tumor cells. We
noted suppression of de novo thymidine synthesis with decreased
levels of thymidylate synthase and inhibition of the salvage pathway
via reduced thymidine kinase.11 Indeed, several pharmacologic and
metabolic tracing studies support enhanced sensitivity to antifolate
agents in arginine auxotrophs exposed to arginine-depleting
agents.13,21 Furthermore, the addition of cisplatin to ADI-PEG
20 exerted, at the least, additive anticancer effects in both tissue
culture and xenograft models of melanoma, and this mechanism is
thought to be caused, at least in part, by the inhibition of DNA
repair enzymes.22
We undertook a phase 1 dose-escalation study of ADI-PEG
20 combined with pemetrexed and cisplatin (ADIPemCis) in
the first-line treatment of patients with nonsquamous NSCLC
or mesothelioma tumors that were ASS1 deficient. The main
aims of the study were to define the toxicity profile of the
combination, to recommend phase 2 doses for ADIPemCis,
and to investigate pharmacodynamic alterations in arginine
metabolism.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Design and Treatment
This was a multicenter, open-label, phase 1, dose-escalation trial
designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ADI-PEG 20 combined
with cisplatin and pemetrexed in patients with histologically proven ad-
vanced MPM and stage IIIB or IV nonsquamous NSCLC. A 3 + 3 + 3 phase
1 dose-escalation design was used to accommodate the predicted toxicity of
pemetrexed and cisplatin.1,23
Preplanned dose levels of weekly intramuscular ADI-PEG 20 were
18 mg/m2, 27 mg/m2, and 36 mg/m2, together with intravenous treatment
with cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. The
initial dose of ADI-PEG 20 was administered at least 48 hours before the
first dose of cytotoxic drugs. To ameliorate toxicity from pemetrexed,
patients received daily folic acid supplementation 400 mg and intramus-
cular hydroxycobalamin 1,000 mg every 9 weeks, both started at least 7 days
before the first dose.
At least three patients were investigated at each dose level for
a minimum of 21 days before escalation to the next cohort dose level. There
was no intrapatient dose escalation. Patients continued ADIPemCis
combination therapy for a maximum of six cycles (18 weeks). Patients with
clinical benefit (stable disease or better) were eligible to receive continued
single-agent ADI-PEG 20 treatment until disease progression.
The primary objectives of the trial were to evaluate the safety and
tolerability of the combination (ADIPemCis) treatment and to establish
a recommended phase 2 dose. Secondary objectives were to determine
progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) at 1 year, and the
pharmacodynamics of ADI-PEG 20 in combination with pemetrexed and
cisplatin.
The study was performed in accordance with good clinical practice
and the European Union Clinical Trials Directive, with approval from
Leeds East (Yorkshire and The Humber) ethical review board. All patients
provided written informed consent.
Eligibility
Patients were 18 years of age or older, with histologically proven
advanced MPM or stage IIIB or IV nonsquamous NSCLC. In addition,
tumors were ASS1 deficient by immunohistochemistry, which was defined
as a loss of ASS1 expression (0 or 1 plus immunohistochemistry staining)7
in . 50% of tumor cells. The 50% threshold was selected on the assumption
that this would enrich the fraction of tumor cells likely to respond to arginine
deprivation on the basis of multiple prior cell-line studies showing an
inverse correlation between ASS1 expression and sensitivity to arginine
depletion.3,24 Specifically, a statistically significant improvement in PFS for
patients with mesothelioma was observed in the ADAM study using the 50%
cutoff, with the hazard ratio decreasing further for tumors with . 75% ASS1
loss.8 Patients had evaluable disease by modified Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) for MPM and by RECIST 1.1 for
nonsquamous NSCLC. All patients were chemotherapy na¨
ıve. Additional
criteria included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
0 or 1, adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function, and a minimum
expected survival of 3 months. Exclusion criteria included anticancer
therapy within 4 weeks of entering the study, ongoing toxic manifestations of
previous treatments, symptomatic brain or spinal cord metastases, signif-
icant concomitant or uncontrolled intercurrent illness, recent major surgery,
therapeutic anticoagulation, participation in another interventional clinical
study, history of another primary cancer (unless treated curatively or un-
likely to affect patient outcome), allergy to platinum salts or pegylated or
Escherichia coli products, pregnancy, history of seizure disorder, and previous
therapy with ADI-PEG 20.

 performed on day 1 of every cycle and at other times as clinically indicated.
All treated patients were evaluated for safety by laboratory tests, physical
examination, and adverse event (AE) assessment at screening, and at every
3 weeks during therapy. All AEs were graded according to the National
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ver-
sion 4.03. AE monitoring continued for 30 days after the final treatment,
and monitoring of AEs related to ADI-PEG 20 was continued until sta-
bilization or resolution. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were assessed
during cycle one (21 days) as AEs that were possibly, probably, or definitely
related to study treatment, including grade 4 neutropenia (. 7 days
duration); febrile neutropenia; grade 4 anemia (requiring transfusion
therapy); grade 4 thrombocytopenia; or grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic
toxicity with the exception of grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that
resolved to a lower grade with supportive treatment within 7 days, grade 3
AST/ALT elevation without accompanying increase in bilirubin, alopecia,
electrolyte abnormalities, or other grade 3 or 4 asymptomatic laboratory
evaluations only deemed as DLTs if assessed clinically significant by the
investigator; and a delay in cycle 2 for . 3 weeks. Patients were evaluable
for DLTs if they had received at least 1 dose of ADI-PEG 20. Nonevaluable
patients (those not receiving at least 1 dose of ADI-PEG 20) were replaced.
Pharmacodynamic Evaluations
Blood samples were taken before each dose of ADI-PEG 20 to analyze
arginine and citrulline levels and for immunogenicity analyses, as de-
scribed previously.8
Efficacy Evaluations
Computed tomography scans were performed every 6 weeks during
ADIPemCis combination dosing and after every 8 weeks during ADI-PEG
20–only treatment. Tumor measurements were recorded and assessed
according to RECIST 1.1 or modified RECIST.
RESULTS
Nine eligible patients (four with NSCLC and five with MPM)
were treated. Three patients were treated in each of the planned
18 mg/m2, 27 mg/m2, and 36 mg/m2 ADI-PEG 20 cohorts. A
majority of patients managed to complete six cycles of combi-
nation treatment. The median number of weeks that the patients
received treatment was 23.5 (range, 13 to 47 weeks) for patients
with NSCLC and 31.0 (range, 30 to 47 weeks) for patients with
MPM. Patients’ characteristics and dispositions are summarized
in Table 1 and Figure 1.
Safety
Most adverse events were grade 1 (83% of total) or grade 2.
All AEs are summarized in Table 2. The most common toxic-
ities were fatigue, nausea, vomiting, oropharyngeal toxicity
(stomatitis, mucositis, and oral candidiasis), and rash. Hy-
persensitivity was observed in one patient and was attributed
to cisplatin; this patient was rechallenged successfully with ADI-
PEG 20. Febrile neutropenia was not observed; grade 3 neu-
tropenia was reported in one of nine patients (11%). There were
no DLTs or treatment-related deaths. Most AEs were attributed
to (and expected as a result of) pemetrexed and/or cisplatin
therapy; only nine of 38 (grade 1 or 2) reported AEs were related
to ADI-PEG 20. In this small number of patients, there was no
clear dose–response relationship between ADI-PEG 20 dose
level and toxicity.
Pharmacodynamics
Despite variability because of the small sample size, circulating
plasma arginine concentrations were depleted rapidly in all patients
and remained suppressed at approximately 30% of baseline levels
throughout the 18 weeks of triplet therapy. Correspondingly, plasma
levels of the ADI-PEG20 product citrulline increased rapidly and
remained elevated during the same dosing period (Fig 2). Anti–ADI-
PEG 20 antibody titers are illustrated in Figure 3. In summary, titers
of antidrug antibodies increased gradually, seemed to plateau at
week 8 to week 10, and remained below 1024 by week 18.
Response
All patients experienced a best response of stable disease or better.
Furthermore, seven of nine patients (78%) achieved a partial response,
which was seen at all dose levels investigated (ie, overall response rate
of 0.78; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.97). The median OSwas 55.7 weeks, and the
median PFS was 30.1 weeks. The median OS was 56.4 weeks (range,
30.7 to $ 105.1 weeks), and the median PFS was 30.7 weeks (range,
27.9 to 38.0 weeks) for patients with MPM, whereas for patients with
NSCLC, the median OS was 55.5 weeks (range, 25.7 to 56.7 weeks)
and the median PFS was 23.0 weeks (range, 12.7 to 41.0 weeks).
Individual patient data are summarized in Figure 4.
DISCUSSION
In this biomarker-directed study, we have presented data on the
first combination of the arginine-depleting agent (ADI-PEG 20)
with cisplatin and pemetrexed (ADIPemCis). Patients with ASS1-
deficient thoracic tumors were treated for up to six cycles, and

ADI-PEG 20, Cisplatin, and Pemetrexed for ASS1-Deficient Thoracic Cancers

 treatment was well tolerated overall. The most common adverse
effects were nausea and vomiting at a frequency comparable to that
seen in previous studies of cisplatin and pemetrexed. The addition
of ADI-PEG 20 prompted an increase in rash as the most common
adverse effect. One hypersensitivity reaction occurred during the
administration of cisplatin. This patient was subsequently rechal-
lenged successfully with ADI-PEG 20. All the toxicities that were
reported as being possibly or probably related to ADI-PEG 20 were
grade 1 or 2 in nature. No DLTs were reported.
Arginine suppression with the ADIPemCis triplet was more
prolonged than that which was observed previously with ADI-PEG
20 monotherapy. In the ADAM monotherapy study, arginine was
depleted to below 30% of baseline for 7 weeks, but by 9 weeks,
arginine concentrations had returned to pretreatment levels, with
a corresponding fall in citrulline concentrations.8 Arginine sup-
pression was also detected for the first 8 weeks only, before reaching
baseline levels by week 12, in a recent phase 1 combination study
of ADI-PEG20 combined with docetaxel in solid tumors.25 In
contrast, with the ADIPemCis regimen, arginine concentrations
remained depleted compared with baseline levels until the end of
treatment, and citrulline concentrations were persistently elevated.
Anti–ADI-PEG 20 antibodies increased gradually, then seemed
to reach a plateau at approximately 1023 by 8 to 10 weeks. In-
terestingly, this was in contrast to samples taken from patients
treated in the monotherapy and docetaxel combination study, in
which anti–ADI-PEG 20 antibodies increased rapidly and reached
1023 by 9 weeks, followed by a continued increase in titers (1025 to
1026) before reaching a plateau by 16 weeks. Prolonged arginine
depletion may be caused by the suppression of neutralizing
anti–ADI-PEG 20 antibodies by pemetrexed and cisplatin, espe-
cially cisplatin, and by the use of concomitant corticosteroids as
chemotherapy premedication.26
We report an interesting clinical activity signal in this small
patient cohort, with an overall RECIST response rate of 78%.
Previous studies reported response rates of 31% and 41% for
cisplatin and pemetrexed, respectively, administered to patients
with NSCLC and MPM.1,2 Importantly, two patients with biphasic
MPM and one with sarcomatoid MPM treated with ADIPemCis in
this study have achieved partial response. Sarcomatoid histology is
considered resistant to chemotherapy, and with the combination of
pemetrexed, cisplatin, and bevacizumab, there were no responses
reported among the five patients with sarcomatoid MPM.27 A
recent epidemiologic study reported a median OS of 13.3 versus
6.2 months for patients with epithelioid and nonepithelioid MPM,
respectively.28 Recently, Bueno et al reported that the prognosis of
patients with the non-epithelioid subtypes (sarcomatoid, biphasic-
sarcomatoid, biphasic-epithelioid) was worse than that of patients
with the pure epithelioid subtype of mesothelioma (P = .0001).
Interestingly, this outcome correlated with significant down-
regulation of the ASS1 gene in sarcomatoid compared with
epithelioid MPM.29 One of our patients with biphasic MPM
remains alive 26 months after presentation, with a debilitating

 corticosteroid-refractory anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody-
positive paraneoplastic arthritis of the hands, described previously
with several cancers but not with MPM.30 The arthritis resolved
within the first cycle of ADIPemCis and then fluctuated at a lower
intensity while the patient was receiving ADI-PEG20 monotherapy.
The median PFS and OS outcomes for the study overall are
within the range expected for platinum and pemetrexed doublets
but with less aggressive cancers. The clinical activity signal de-
scribed, in particular in patients with MPM, is being studied further
in an expansion cohort including 18F-fluorothymidine positron
emission tomography scanning and will be reported separately.31
Several other triplet combination phase I trials with ADI-PEG 20
are ongoing, including one examining the combination of ADI-PEG
20 with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in pancreatic cancer
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02101580) and another examining
ADI-PEG 20 with FOLFOX in the treatment of advanced GI ma-
lignancies, especially hepatocellular carcinoma (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier CT02102022). The key rationale is similar in that sig-
nificant proportions of these tumors are auxotrophic for arginine
and in that the disruption of arginine supply with ADI-PEG 20
suppresses, in particular, nucleotide metabolism.13,32,33 These trials
seek to emulate the success seen with asparaginase combination
therapy in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia many
years earlier, where a signal was observed with monotherapy but
a significant number of cures were not seen until it was combined
with multiple other agents.34 Importantly, the effects of combination

 chemotherapy are likely to be tumor cell type specific, as evidenced
by the differential modulation of enzymes involved in nucleotide
synthesis after treatment with ADI-PEG20 in mesothelioma com-
pared with melanoma.11,35 In the case of platinum agents, resistance
has been observed in ovarian cancer and NSCLC cell lines displaying
loss of ASS1, whereas ADI-PEG 20 has been shown to induce cisplatin
sensitivity in the latter.9,36 Further work will be needed to optimize
antimetabolite combinations on the basis of careful biomarker
analyses to identify the role of arginine deprivation in the clinic.24
In summary, our results are consistent with preclinical data
that support a synergistic interaction of platinum-based and
antifolate chemotherapy with concomitant arginine depletion
in patients selected for tumors deficient in ASS1. The triplet
regimen has achieved high response rates in this small trial, and

 was well tolerated in patients with MPM and NSCLC. With
limited treatments available for these patients, this triplet
combination warrants further study. The recommended phase 2
dose was weekly, intramuscular ADI-PEG 20 36 mg/m2 plus
three-weekly intravenous cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and pemetrexed
500 mg/m2. A randomized phase 2–3 trial for ASS1-deficient
patients with MPM has opened (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT02709512).
