Background: Expert guidelines recommend reducing or dis-
continuing long-term opioid therapy (LTOT) when risks out-
weigh benefits, but evidence on the effect of dose reduction on
patient outcomes has not been systematically reviewed.
Purpose: To synthesize studies of the effectiveness of strategies
to reduce or discontinue LTOT and patient outcomes after dose
reduction among adults prescribed LTOT for chronic pain.
Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the
Cochrane Library from inception through April 2017; reference
lists; and expert contacts.
Study Selection: Original research published in English that
addressed dose reduction or discontinuation of LTOT for
chronic pain.
Data Extraction: Two independent reviewers extracted data
and assessed study quality using the U.S. Preventive Services
Task Force quality rating criteria. All authors assessed evidence
quality using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assess-
ment, Development and Evaluation) system. Prespecified patient
outcomes were pain severity, function, quality of life, opioid with-
drawal symptoms, substance use, and adverse events.
Data Synthesis: Sixty-seven studies (11 randomized trials and
56 observational studies) examining 8 intervention categories,
including
interdisciplinary
pain
programs,
buprenorphine-
assisted dose reduction, and behavioral interventions, were
found. Study quality was good for 3 studies, fair for 13 studies,
and poor for 51 studies. Many studies reported dose reduction,
but rates of opioid discontinuation ranged widely across inter-
ventions and the overall quality of evidence was very low.
Among 40 studies examining patient outcomes after dose re-
duction (very low overall quality of evidence), improvement was
reported in pain severity (8 of 8 fair-quality studies), function (5 of
5 fair-quality studies), and quality of life (3 of 3 fair-quality
studies).
Limitation: Heterogeneous interventions and outcome mea-
sures; poor-quality studies with uncontrolled designs.
Conclusion: Very low quality evidence suggests that several
types of interventions may be effective to reduce or discontinue
LTOT and that pain, function, and quality of life may improve
with opioid dose reduction.

A
pproximately 10 million U.S. adults are prescribed
long-term opioid therapy (LTOT) for chronic pain
despite inadequate evidence of long-term benefit and
growing evidence of harms (1, 2). No published studies
have compared LTOT (>1 year) versus placebo, no opi-
oid, or nonopioid therapies (2). In recent decades, a
dramatic increase in the prescription of opioid medica-
tions has been accompanied by increases in opioid
overdose (3); more than 33 000 opioid overdose
deaths occurred in 2015 (4). Higher prescribed opioid
dose is associated with overdose risk (5–7) as well as
incidence of opioid use disorder, depression, fracture,
motor vehicle accident, and suicide (8–12). Dose re-
duction or discontinuation, or opioid tapering, may de-
crease these risks, and expert guidelines recommend
tapering when risks outweigh benefits (13, 14).
Opioid tapering can be challenging for both pa-
tients and clinicians. In routine practice, discontinuation
of LTOT is uncommon, ranging from 8% to 35% in prior
cohort studies (15, 16). In a survey of patients receiving
high-dose opioid medications for chronic pain, nearly
half reported wanting to cut down or stop, yet 80%
were receiving high-dose opioids 1 year later (17).
Among patients who had a nonfatal overdose while be-
ing prescribed LTOT, 91% continued use of opioid
medications after the overdose (18). There is little evi-
dence to guide clinicians in the process of opioid ta-
pering, especially in primary care settings, where most
opioid therapy is prescribed (19, 20). In addition, little
is known about the risks and benefits of opioid taper-
ing. Potential risks include withdrawal symptoms, in-
creased pain, and loss to follow-up (20). However,
some patients report improvements in function and
quality of life after tapering (21). The effects of opioid
tapering on patient outcomes have not been systemat-
ically reviewed.
To address these gaps, we systematically reviewed
the evidence on the effectiveness of strategies to re-
duce or discontinue LTOT prescribed for chronic pain

 and the effect of dose reduction or discontinuation of
LTOT on important patient outcomes.
METHODS
A multidisciplinary team of investigators with ex-
pertise in pain and opioid management developed 2
key questions to address the study objectives. These
key questions assessed 1) the effectiveness of strate-
gies to reduce or discontinue LTOT, and 2) the effect of
dose reduction or discontinuation of LTOT on prespeci-
fied patient outcomes of pain severity, pain-related
function, quality of life, opioid withdrawal symptoms,
substance use, or adverse events. We followed the
PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic re-
views and Meta-Analyses) guidelines (22), and the
protocol is registered in the PROSPERO database
(CRD42015020347).
Data Sources and Searches
We
searched
MEDLINE,
EMBASE,
PsycINFO,
CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library from inception
through 19 April 2017. We consulted with a research
librarian to design a search strategy based on our key
questions. We developed a MEDLINE search strategy,
which was also applied to other databases, using mul-
tiple subject headings (where available) and text words
for key concepts of “opioids”, “tapering”, and “pain”.
No language or year limits were applied. Within this
broader search, we identified potentially relevant sys-
tematic reviews and meta-analyses published since
2005. The full electronic search strategy for MEDLINE is
presented in Appendix Table 1 (available at Annals
.org). We examined reference lists from all included
studies and from relevant systematic reviews and pub-
lished expert guidelines. We also sought input from ex-
pert contacts. Records retrieved from each search strat-
egy were organized using the EndNote bibliographic
management application (Clarivate Analytics).
Study Selection
Two investigators (J.W.F. and H.R.D.) indepen-
dently reviewed abstracts identified by the search strat-
egy and, when necessary, the full text to determine in-
clusion. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. We
included studies that involved adults (aged ≥18 years)
who were prescribed LTOT for chronic pain (defined as
pain lasting >3 months) and that addressed at least 1
key question. Studies that did not report pain duration
were included if the average duration of opioid therapy
was more than 3 months. We did not require interven-
tions to involve explicit goals or mandatory conditions
of opioid dose reduction. Eligible study designs in-
cluded randomized trials, cohort studies, case–control
studies, and case series. We excluded case reports and
cross-sectional studies, as well as studies that did not
describe the clinical intervention or report patient-level
data. We also excluded studies that were not published
in English; involved nonhuman participants; addressed
only acute, surgical, postoperative, obstetric, or cancer
pain; involved only palliative or hospice care; evaluated
only illicit or nonmedical use of opioid medications;
or addressed only reduction of interventional pain
techniques.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
We developed an instrument for data extraction
based on prior systematic reviews conducted by the
investigators. Three investigators piloted the data ex-
traction instrument using a randomly chosen study,
and the results were returned to the pool for formal
review. These investigators discussed difficulties with
the extraction instrument and reached consensus on
minor modifications. Using the finalized instrument, 2
investigators independently extracted data on design,
patient sample, setting, interventions, measures, and
results from each study. When dose information was
not provided by the study, we used a standard algo-
rithm
for
calculating
morphine-equivalent
doses
(MEDs) of opioid medications (23).
Two reviewers independently assessed study qual-
ity (risk of bias in individual studies) using criteria de-
veloped by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
(USPSTF), which facilitate rating of study quality as
good, fair, or poor (Appendix Table 2, available at
Annals.org). The investigators were blinded to each
other's ratings, and discrepancies were resolved by
consensus or by a third reviewer, if necessary. We did
not exclude studies on the basis of quality.
Data Synthesis
We assessed the overall quality of the evidence
using a method developed by the GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations
Assessment,
Development
and
Evaluation) Working Group (24). GRADE provides ex-
plicit criteria that address study design, risk of bias, im-
precision, inconsistency, indirectness, and magnitude
of effect to rate the quality of evidence across studies.
This method rates the quality of the evidence from high
(very confident that the true effect lies close to that of
the estimate of effect) to very low (very little confidence
in the effect estimate) (Appendix Table 3, available at
Annals.org). All authors iteratively discussed GRADE as-
sessments to achieve consensus. We present system-
atic review results organized by key question. We did
not attempt meta-analyses because of heterogeneity
across studies and methodological limitations of the
studies.
Role of the Funding Source
The Veterans Health Administration's Substance
Use Disorder Quality Enhancement Research Initiative
funded the study through its Locally Initiated Projects
program (QLP 59-046). The funding sources had no
role in the design and conduct of the study; collection,
management, analysis, or interpretation of the data; or
preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript.
RESULTS
Database searches identified 3522 abstracts, from
which 74 studies met criteria for full-text review. Seven-
teen additional articles were identified from reference
lists and expert contacts. Of these 91 studies, 68 arti-
cles representing 67 studies met inclusion criteria

 participants receiving LTOT, the mean daily dose
ranged from 29 to 556 mg MED. Study interventions
had an objective of opioid discontinuation or dose re-
duction in 43 and 12 studies, respectively; 12 studies
reported on this outcome in secondary or exploratory
analyses.
All included studies assessed the effectiveness of
strategies to reduce or discontinue LTOT (key question
1). Study quality as assessed by the USPSTF criteria was
good for 3 studies, fair for 13 studies, and poor for 51
studies. The GRADE quality of evidence to address the
effectiveness of strategies to reduce or discontinue
LTOT was very low (Table 2; Appendix Table 4, avail-
able at Annals.org). In the remainder of this section, we
highlight results from good- and fair-quality studies.
Descriptions of all included studies are available in Ap-
pendix Table 5 (available at Annals.org).
Thirty-one studies (11 fair-quality and 20 poor-
quality) presented data from 19 distinct interdisciplin-
ary pain programs. These programs were described as
intensive multimodal treatment with an interdisciplinary
team, typically organized around a biopsychosocial
model of chronic pain. The 11 fair-quality studies in-
cluded 2 controlled and 9 uncontrolled observational
studies. Ten fair-quality studies described programs
that mandated discontinuation as a condition of enroll-
ment; in these programs, 87% of participants discontin-
ued opioid use at program completion (range, 74% to
100%).
Six studies (3 good-quality and 3 poor-quality) with
238 total participants assessed the effectiveness of be-
havioral interventions. The 3 good-quality studies were
small randomized controlled trials; 2 were described as
pilot trials, and none were powered to detect clinically
meaningful differences in opioid dose reduction. The
first good-quality trial compared a 4-month interactive
voice response intervention versus usual care among
patients with chronic pain (n = 51); a goal of opioid
dose reduction was optional. The intervention reduced
the mean opioid dose significantly at 4-month (P =
0.04) and 8-month (P = 0.004) follow-up compared with
usual care (mean dose change was not reported) (65).
The second good-quality trial compared an 8-week
group intervention based on mindfulness meditation
and cognitive behavioral therapy with usual care
among patients receiving LTOT (n = 35); the interven-
tion did not explicitly encourage dose reduction. The
mean change in the daily opioid dose from baseline to
26 weeks was �10.1 mg MED in the intervention group
compared with �0.2 mg MED in the control group (P =
0.8) (90). The third good-quality trial compared a 22-
week opioid taper support intervention (motivational
interviewing and pain self-management education de-
livered by a physician assistant) with usual care (n = 35);
opioid dose reduction was the primary outcome. The
intervention reduced the mean opioid dose by 43%
compared with 19% in the usual care group at 22
weeks (P = 0.07) (76). The remaining 6 intervention
types were described in 30 studies (2 fair-quality and
28 poor-quality).
We identified 40 studies that examined the effect
of dose reduction or discontinuation of LTOT on pa-
tient outcomes (key question 2) (Table 3). These studies
included 5 randomized controlled trials, 6 controlled
observational studies, and 29 uncontrolled observa-
tional studies. None of the 40 studies were rated as
good-quality. For each of the 6 prespecified patient
outcomes, the GRADE quality of evidence was very low
(Table 2 and Appendix Table 4).
Thirty-six studies (8 fair-quality and 28 poor-quality)
examined the effect of opioid dose reduction on pain
severity. The 8 fair-quality studies included 1 controlled
and 6 uncontrolled observational studies of interdisci-
plinary pain programs and 1 uncontrolled observa-
tional study of acupuncture; all 8 studies reported im-
proved pain after opioid dose reduction. The effect of
dose reduction on pain-related function was assessed
in 17 studies (5 fair-quality and 12 poor-quality). The 5
fair-quality studies were observational studies of inter-
disciplinary pain programs (1 controlled and 4 uncon-
trolled); all 5 studies reported improved function after
opioid dose reduction. The effect of dose reduction on
quality of life was assessed in 12 studies (3 fair-quality
and 9 poor-quality). The 3 fair-quality studies were un-
controlled observational studies of interdisciplinary
pain programs; all reported improved quality of life af-
ter opioid dose reduction. Opioid withdrawal symp-
toms were examined in 18 studies (3 fair-quality and 15
poor-quality); the reported incidence during opioid
dose reduction ranged widely. Four poor-quality stud-
ies examined new-onset substance use. Eleven poor-
quality studies assessed adverse events; 5 assessed
mortality outcomes, and 1 reported a single opioid-
related overdose death.
DISCUSSION
This systematic review identified 67 studies that
examined the effectiveness of strategies to reduce or
discontinue LTOT among adults with chronic pain, in-
cluding 3 small good-quality randomized trials, 1 fair-
quality randomized trial, and 12 fair-quality observa-
tional studies. Though many studies reported positive
dose reduction outcomes, the overall quality of the ev-
idence for effectiveness of all strategies to reduce or
discontinue LTOT was very low due to methodological
limitations across studies and an absence of adequately
powered randomized trials. We identified 40 studies
that assessed the effect of dose reduction or discontin-
uation of LTOT on important patient outcomes, 8 of
which were fair-quality observational studies. The fair-
quality studies reported improvement in pain severity
(8 of 8 studies), function (5 of 5 studies), and quality of
life (3 of 3 studies) after opioid dose reduction. How-
ever, the overall quality of the evidence was very low
for all 6 prespecified patient outcomes.
Common themes across intervention types can
provide insight into the program components that may

good-quality trials of behavioral interventions and the
11 fair-quality studies of interdisciplinary pain pro-
grams, patients received multimodal care that empha-
sized nonpharmacologic and self-management strate-

management of LTOT and chronic pain (13, 14, 93). In
addition to the content of these interventions, the
quantity of care provided is likely an important factor.
Multidisciplinary care and close follow-up (at least
weekly) were common attributes of evaluated pro-
grams in good- and fair-quality studies. Such team-

 based, intensive support would require additional re-
sources to implement in primary care settings, where
most opioid medications are prescribed (19). Given the
heterogeneity across interventions and the overall poor
quality of studies, data do not currently support assess-
ment of comparative effectiveness of the different mod-
els of care or opioid tapering protocols used in in-
cluded studies.
Although confidence is limited by the very low
quality of evidence overall, findings from this system-
atic review suggest that pain, function, and quality of
life may improve during and after opioid dose reduc-
tion. Several potential mechanisms may underlie this
finding. First, in addition to tapering opioids, most in-
terventions delivered concurrent nonopioid pain man-
agement approaches that may have provided more
benefit than LTOT. Second, opioid dose reduction may
alleviate adverse effects of LTOT that can negatively
affect function and quality of life, such as constipation,
fatigue, poor sleep, and depressed mood. Third, im-
provement after opioid dose reduction may result from
resolution of opioid-induced hyperalgesia, a paradoxi-
cal response in which patients receiving opioids be-
come more sensitive to painful stimuli (94). Finally,
given the observational nature of most studies, we can-
not exclude reverse causation (that is, patients success-
fully tapered opioids because pain severity decreased).
In the realm of opioid therapy, patient safety and pain
relief have often been framed as conflicting and mutu-
ally exclusive goals. Evidence about benefits of opioid
tapering for pain, function, and quality of life, if con-
firmed by future high-quality studies, holds the poten-

 tial to fundamentally alter the conversation about opi-
oid tapering.
Three prior systematic reviews identified 11 ran-
domized or controlled studies of interventions for dose
reduction among patients prescribed opioid medica-
tions for chronic pain (2, 95, 96). All 3 reviews deter-
mined that the strength of evidence was insufficient to
draw conclusions. Our review extends these prior re-
views by providing an updated and comprehensive as-
sessment of the literature, adding 2 recent good-
quality randomized controlled trials and 11 fair-quality
observational studies. Whereas prior reviews assessed
outcomes of opioid dose reduction, this is, to our
knowledge, the first study to systematically review pa-
tient outcomes after dose reduction or discontinuation
of LTOT for chronic pain.
The findings of this systematic review should be
interpreted in the context of its limitations. First, there
was substantial heterogeneity of measures of opioid
dose reduction and patient outcomes. Second, we cat-
egorized interventions into clinically relevant domains
according to the authors' descriptions of key compo-
nents. There was substantial heterogeneity within do-
mains and overlap across some. Third, most of the in-
cluded studies examined voluntary participation in a
clinical program or research intervention. The findings
may therefore not be generalizable to patients for
whom LTOT is reduced or discontinued involuntarily.
Fourth, publication bias may have limited the evidence
that was available for this review. Finally, new data may
have emerged since April 2017 in this rapidly evolving
area; 39 of the 67 studies included in this review were
published since 2010, and 18 were published since
2015.
This systematic review highlights challenges and
opportunities for future research (Table 4). First, mea-
surement and reporting of opioid dose reduction were
heterogeneous across studies, and consensus on what
constitutes meaningful dose reduction is needed, in-
cluding patients transitioning to buprenorphine. Sec-
ond, innovative strategies for recruitment and retention
will be required for future patient-level randomized tri-
als of opioid tapering because patients' apprehension
with regard to tapering may serve as a barrier to
participation (21). Such strategies might include ran-
domization of patients to active pain management in-
terventions with optional opioid dose reduction, ran-
domization to different protocols or tapering rates
among motivated patients, or randomization at the
level of the prescriber or facility. Given that loss to
follow-up was common in poor-quality studies in this
review, evidence on effective strategies to enhance pa-
tient engagement is also needed. Third, future research
should examine strategies that are likely to be feasible
in busy primary care settings and scalable across health
systems. Although 31 studies in this review examined
interdisciplinary pain programs, only 5 involved pri-
mary care settings. The effectiveness of less resource-
intensive team-based models (97, 98) or technology-
assisted
approaches
(99)
for
supporting
opioid
tapering warrants further study. Fourth, in the context
of ongoing health system and population-level efforts
to reduce opioid use and prevent opioid-related harms
(100–102), we identified no prospective studies of man-
datory, involuntary opioid dose reduction among oth-
erwise stable patients. Finally, this review found insuffi-
cient evidence on adverse events related to opioid
tapering, such as accidental overdose if patients re-
sume use of high-dose opioids or switch to illicit opioid
sources or onset of suicidality or other mental health
symptoms. Public health surveillance and large-scale
observational studies are needed to assess outcomes
of efforts to reduce opioid prescribing at the health
system and population levels, especially rare but im-
portant adverse events, such as overdose and suicide.
In conclusion, this systematic review identified mul-
tiple strategies to reduce or discontinue LTOT for
chronic pain and found very-low-quality evidence that
opioid dose reduction may improve pain, function, and
quality of life. In addition to discussing the goals and
risks of opioid therapy, clinicians should consider dis-
cussing the potential benefits of opioid tapering with
patients receiving LTOT. Informed by the multidisci-
plinary care models among good- and fair-quality stud-
ies, clinicians should consider referring patients to
multidisciplinary pain programs, when available, or de-
veloping team-based approaches to support opioid ta-
pering in outpatient practice. Finally, given inadequate
evidence on the risks of opioid tapering, caution and
close monitoring are warranted during and after taper-
ing; consideration of overdose prevention strategies,
such as naloxone, may be prudent (103). Together,
these strategies are well-aligned with the broader goal
of patient-centered, evidence-based, effective chronic
pain care (104).
Table 4. Implications for Clinicians and Next Steps for
Research
Implications for Clinicians
Next Steps for Research
Discuss with patients receiving
LTOT that pain severity,
function, and quality of life
may improve after opioid
tapering.
Researchers should seek consensus
on the reporting of opioid dose
reduction and definition of
clinically meaningful dose
reduction.
Consider referring patients to
a multidisciplinary,
multimodal pain program,
when available, to support
opioid dose reduction.
Innovative approaches to
recruitment and randomization
(such as trials with randomization
at the provider or facility level)
are needed to generate
high-quality evidence on
outcomes.
Consider team-based
strategies with close
follow-up to support
opioid tapering when
multidisciplinary programs
are inadequately accessible.
Future studies should examine
interventions that are feasible in
busy primary care settings and
scalable across multiple health
systems.
Given inadequate evidence on
the risks of opioid tapering,
caution and close
monitoring are warranted
during and after.
Public health surveillance and
large-scale observational studies
are needed to assess outcomes
of efforts to reduce opioid
prescribing at health system and
population levels.
LTOT = long-term opioid therapy.

 Appendix Table 2. USPSTF Quality Rating Criteria for
RCTs and Cohort Studies
Criteria
Initial assembly of comparable groups:
RCTs—adequate randomization, including concealment and whether
potential confounders were distributed equally among groups
Cohort studies—consideration of potential confounders with either
restriction or measurement for adjustment in the analysis;
consideration of inception cohorts
Maintenance of comparable groups (includes attrition, crossovers,
adherence, contamination)
Important differential loss to follow-up or overall high loss to follow-up
Measurements: equal, reliable, and valid (includes masking of outcome
assessment)
Clear definition of interventions
Important outcomes considered
Analysis: adjustment for potential confounders for cohort studies, or
intention-to-treat analysis for RCTs (i.e., analysis in which all
participants in a trial are analyzed according to the intervention to
which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they
completed the intervention)
Definition of ratings based on above criteria
Good
Meets all criteria: Comparable groups are assembled initially and
maintained throughout the study (follow-up at least 80%); reliable
and valid measurement instruments are used and applied equally to
the groups; interventions are spelled out clearly; important
outcomes are considered; and appropriate attention to confounders
in analysis.
Fair
Studies will be graded “fair” if any or all of the following problems
occur, without the important limitations noted in the “poor” category
below: Generally comparable groups are assembled initially but
some question remains whether some (although not major)
differences occurred in follow-up; measurement instruments are
acceptable (although not the best) and generally applied equally;
some but not all important outcomes are considered; and some but
not all potential confounders are accounted for.
Poor
Studies will be graded “poor” if any of the following major limitations
exists: Groups assembled initially are not close to being comparable
or maintained throughout the study; unreliable or invalid
measurement instruments are used or not applied at all equally
among groups (including not masking outcome assessment); and
key confounders are given little or no attention.
RCT = randomized controlled trial; USPSTF = U.S. Preventive Services
Task Force.
Appendix Table 3. GRADE Criteria for Assessing Quality
of Evidence*
Initial quality of a body of evidence
Randomized trial = high
Observational study = low
Any other evidence = very low
Decrease GRADE if
Serious (−1) or very serious (−2) risk of bias
Serious (−1) or very serious (−2) inconsistency
Serious (−1) or very serious (−2) indirectness
Serious (−1) or very serious (−2) imprecision
Likely (−1) or very likely (−2) publication bias
Increase GRADE if
Large (+1) or very large (+2) effect
Evidence of a dose response gradient (+1)
All plausible confounders would reduce a demonstrated effect (+1) or
would suggest a spurious effect if no effect was observed (+2)
Significance of the 4 levels of evidence
High = We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the
estimate of the effect
Moderate = We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true
effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a
possibility that it is substantially different
Low = Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect
may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect
Very low = We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true
effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect
GRADE = Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development
and Evaluation.
