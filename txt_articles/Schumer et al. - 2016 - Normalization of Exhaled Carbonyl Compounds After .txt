Background. Quantitative analysis of specific exhaled
carbonyl compounds (ECCs) has shown promise for the
detection of lung cancer. The purpose of this study is to
demonstrate the normalization of ECCs in patients after
lung cancer resection.
Methods. Patients from a single center gave consent
and were enrolled in the study from 2011 onward.
Breath analysis was performed on lung cancer patients
before and after surgical resection of their tumors.
One liter of breath from a single exhalation was
collected and evacuated over a silicon microchip.
Carbonyls were captured by oximation reaction and
analyzed by mass spectrometry. Concentrations of four
cancer-specific ECCs were measured and compared by
using
the
Wilcoxon
test.
A
given
cancer
marker
was considered elevated at 1.5 or more standard
deviations
greater
than
the
mean
of
the
control
population.
Results. There were 34 cancer patients with paired
samples and 187 control subjects. The median values af-
ter resection were significantly lower for all four ECCs
and were equivalent to the control patient values for
three of the four ECCs.
Conclusions. The analysis of ECCs demonstrates reduc-
tion to the level of control patients after surgical resection
for lung cancer. This technology has the potential to be a
useful tool to detect disease after lung cancer resection.
Continued follow-up will determine whether subsequent
elevation of ECCs is indicative of recurrent disease.

n 2015, it was estimated that 221,200 Americans would
be diagnosed with lung cancer. Lung cancer remains
the leading cause of cancer death in the United States and
represents 13% of all cancer diagnoses [1]. Despite im-
provements in surgical procedures, chemotherapy, and
radiation therapy, overall survival has remained poor,
with a 5-year survival of 18.0% [2]. Survival in other
common cancers, specifically breast, prostate, and colon,
have seen more drastic improvements, which can be
partly
attributed
to
earlier
detection,
as
effective
screening technology and modalities are developed [3, 4].
However, these screening techniques are not uniformly
effective and can result in overdiagnosis of benign find-
ings with risk of unnecessary morbidity [3, 5].
The National Lung Screening Trial, published in 2011,
found a 6.7% overall survival benefit for patients at high
risk of lung cancer, who underwent yearly screening
computed tomography (CT) scans [6]. Lung cancer mor-
tality was also reduced by 20%. The study was able to
detect a high proportion of early cancers (49% stage IA),
allowing for intervention with curable intent. The Na-
tional Lung Screening Trial provided a positive test in
24.2% of patients; however, 94% of these were falsely
positive [7]. These false positives have led to further
investigation with multiple modalities, including radio-
graphic and sometimes invasive testing, resulting in risk
of unnecessary major complications for potential benign
disease [8]. This method of screening will substantially
contribute to health care cost, with estimates in the range
of billions of dollars annually [9]. It may be further limited
by patient compliance, which is uncertain. These short-
comings provide an opportunity for improvements in
lung cancer detection and the development of alternative
strategies.
Similarly,
a
diagnostic
method
that
could
also
contribute to surveillance after resection would be ideal.
Even in early-stage lung cancer, recurrence occurs in 20%
of patients, and up to 7% experience a second primary
recurrence [10]. Currently, no universally agreed on sur-
veillance
guidelines
exist
for
interval
frequency
or
method type. Hanna and colleagues [11] found that CT
scan is overwhelmingly superior to chest x-ray (CXR) in

 the sensitivity of detecting recurrence (94% versus 21%),
but these results have not been reproduced in other
studies. Crabtree and colleagues [12] showed a shorter
time interval to detection of a successive malignancy
when using surveillance CT scan over CXR, but they also
showed no difference in detection of malignancy overall,
5-year survival, or rate of treatment for curative intent.
This has led to various guidelines, as published by the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network, the American
College of Chest Physicians, and the American Associa-
tion of Thoracic Surgeons, among others. These guide-
lines suggest some combination of history and physical
examination and imaging method, usually CT with the
option for substituting CXR, at different intervals for
different postoperative years [13].
The analysis of exhaled breath is a promising nonin-
vasive diagnostic tool for distinguishing benign from
malignant pulmonary disease [14]. This technology has
the potential to also provide a mechanism for surveillance
after resection of patients diagnosed with lung cancer.
This study examined the trends of exhaled carbonyl
compounds (ECCs) after resection of malignant nodules,
to see if the detected levels of ECCs would normalize to
background levels after resection.
Material and Methods
Collection of Breath Samples
The University of Louisville Institutional Review Board
approved the research protocol for collection of exhaled
breath samples. All study subjects signed informed con-
sent before providing breath samples. A single exhalation
of 1 L of breath was collected with a Tedlar bag (Sigma-
Aldrich, St Louis, MO) from each subject. Breath samples
were collected from 222 subjects. Lung cancer was path-
ologically confirmed in 31 patients. Benign disease was
confirmed pathologically in 4 patients. A breath sample
after resection was collected in a similar manner. Some
patients provided more than one postresection sample,
but all 31 patients provided at least one sample. The time
interval between collections was varied. The remaining
187 patients served as the control group that consisted of
healthy patients without known lung disease, which
included
nonsmokers,
active
smokers,
and
former
smokers.
Silicon Chip and Mass Spectrometry
As previously described, the silicon microchips consisted
of an array of micropillars fabricated from silicon wafers
[15]. A quaternary ammonium compound, 2-(amino-oxy)-
N, N, N trimethylethanammounium (ATM) iodide, was
used to coat the surfaces of the micropillars. Through
electrostatic and hydrogen bonds, the compound adsorbs
to the silicon dioxide surfaces of the micropillars. By
means of oximation reactions, the ATM selectivity traps
carbonyl compounds in exhaled breath with capture
efficiencies of 98% or greater.
The process of carbonyl compound capture from
exhaled breath has been previously described [16]. In
summary, exhaled breath collected in 1-L Tedlar bags
was drawn through the silicon microreactor chip with the
use of an applied vacuum. Next, ATM iodide adducts on
the microreactor chip were eluted with methanol from a
slightly pressurized small vial; recovery of ATM adducts
is 99%. The eluted solution was directly analyzed by
Fournier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spec-
trometry. A known amount of deuterated acetone that
had completely reacted with ATM (ATM-acetone-d6) was
added to the eluted solution as an internal reference. The
concentrations of all carbonyl compounds in the exhaled
breath
were
determined
by
comparison
of
relative
abundance with that of added ATM-acetone-d6.
The entire study population consists of analysis that
used two different microchips with different densities of
micropillars. Subanalysis of these groups did not reveal
any meaningful difference between the two microchips.
Data Analysis
Four
distinct
carbonyl
cancer
markers
(2-butanone,
3-hydroxy-2-butanone,
2-hydroxyacetaldehyde,
and
4-hydroxyhexanal) were used for this analysis; previous
studies have reported elevated levels of these markers in
cancer patients [14]. Control values were established in
the aforementioned 187 healthy patients. Some patients
that were included in the previously reported cancer data
set are included in this study after contributing post-
resection samples.
From previous studies, a positive carbonyl marker was
defined at 1.5 or more standard deviations greater than
the mean of the control population [14]. A positive breath
test was defined as one or more positive carbonyl marker,
with a given patient having between zero and four

 elevated carbonyl cancer markers. The concentrations of
these carbonyl markers were compared and represented
graphically for breath samples both before and after
resection in patients with pathologically confirmed can-
cer. Similarly, postresection samples were compared with
the established concentrations of the control population.
Statistical significance was determined with a nonpara-
metric statistical hypothesis test. Descriptive and uni-
variate analyses were performed with SPSS, version 22
(IBM, Armonk, NY).
Results
A total of 35 patients had samples before and after
resection; 31 had lung cancer and 4 had benign pulmo-
nary disease. The 31 lung cancer patients underwent
surgical resection and had at least one breath sample
before and after resection. Characteristics of the lung
cancer cohort are shown in Table 1.
The lung cancer patients were analyzed separately.
Median values before and after resection were com-
pared for the four ECCs. Median concentrations were
significantly lower for all cancer markers after resection
and are shown in Figure 1. Postresection values were then
compared with the control patients (n ¼ 187) and are
shown for comparison in Figure 1. No significant differ-
ences were found in the median concentrations of
2-butanone, 2-hydroxyacetaldehyde, or 4-hydroxyhexanol
between postresection and control concentrations. The
postresection
concentration
of
3-hydroxy-2-butanone
was, however, significantly higher than that of the con-
trol group. Figure 2 demonstrates the concentrations
before and after resection for lung cancer patients for
individual carbonyls that were elevated before resection.
Four patients with benign pulmonary disease under-
went pulmonary resection. Histologic examination was
positive for granulomatous disease in all patients. Three
patients had zero ECCs both before and after resection.
One patient had three elevated ECCs before resection
that normalized after resection.
Comment
Our group has previously demonstrated the ability of
analysis of ECCs to detect lung cancer [15], to distinguish
from benign pulmonary disease [16], and to potentially
serve as a screening examination with the use of
four
compounds,
2-butanone,
3-hydroxy-2-butanone,

 2-hydroxyacetaldehyde, and 4-hydroxyhexanal [14]. This
current study of 31 lung cancer patients treated surgically
demonstrates a significant decrease in the concentration
of four ECCs after pulmonary resection. In addition, three
of four ECCs normalized to the level of the control pop-
ulation after cancer resection, further confirming the
relation of these carbonyl markers to cancer.
Although screening high-risk patients for lung cancer
with low-dose CT scanning has been shown to reduce
both all-cause and lung cancer-specific mortality [6], post-
treatment surveillance guidelines for lung cancer are
variable and based on a low level of evidence. In addition,
it is unclear whether the use of CT scan for surveillance
even affects mortality from lung cancer [12]. The National
Comprehensive Cancer Network surveillance guidelines
recommend a chest CT scan every 6 to 12 months for 2
years, followed by annual chest CT scans. Not only are
these recommendations based on a low level of evidence
(2A), but the high frequency of CT scans is expensive
[17, 18], results in false positives that likely lead to un-
necessary testing and potential complications [19], and
exposes lung cancer patients to a high amount of radia-
tion. In addition, it has been found that patient compli-
ance with surveillance is highly variable, depending on
socioeconomic status, and may be related to the incon-
venience of frequent CT scans [20, 21]. Surveillance with
breath analysis has the potential to offer these patients a
less-expensive, more-convenient test that avoids radia-
tion exposure.
Although ECCs are clearly associated with malignancy,
the mechanism of their formation is still unknown. The
rapid normalization of three of the four compounds after
resection provides strong evidence that they are directly
produced by the tumor environment. Several hypotheses
exist about ECC production, including altered meta-
bolism by cytochrome p450 enzymes and production of
reactive oxygen species in the tumor microenvironment
that produce the carbonyl compounds by reactions
with fatty acids [22, 23]. The lack of consistent normali-
zation of 3-hydroxy-2-butanone after resection suggests
that this compound may be tied more closely to inflam-
mation associated with tumors rather than the tumors
themselves and, thus, may remain elevated longer after
resection. Further studies to identify the mechanisms
involved in the production of carbonyls, and their relation
to other cancers, will answer these questions.
The study has limitations. The number of patients in
the study population is small. A larger number of lung
cancer patients with multiple breath samples must be
recruited to validate the findings presented in the current
study. Furthermore, samples were collected at various
time lengths. A standardized collection method would
yield an increased number of samples and the ability to
possibly delineate changes in carbonyl composition over
time. Finally, this study population did not include any
patients with recurrent lung cancer. To truly determine
the role of breath analysis in surveillance of lung cancer,
recurrent lung cancer must be detected and compared

 with the ability of CT scanning to detect recurrent lung
cancer.
In conclusion, breath analysis of ECCs demonstrates
normalization in lung cancer patients after pulmonary
resection. Thus, breath analysis may be useful as a
potential tool after lung cancer treatment. Further studies
will reveal the ability of breath analysis to detect recur-
rent lung cancer and may determine the role of breath
analysis in lung cancer surveillance after resection.

DISCUSSION
DR DANIEL L. MILLER (Marietta, GA): That was an excellent
presentation. Was there any change in effect related to if the
patient was still smoking or not from the preoperative to the
postoperative time period?
DR SCHUMER: We did not look at that specifically, but, in pre-
vious studies, we have compared nonsmokers with smokers,
and we did not find a difference between those two groups in
three of the four compounds. And it was the same compound,
3-hydroxy-2-butanone, that did show a slight difference.
DR MILLER: And then in regard to normalization back to below,
what was that time period, 3 months, 6 months? When did that
occur?
DR SCHUMER: It was highly variable, and, again, we have a low
number of patients in the group, so it was very dependent. Some
would normalize shortly after resection, but in the patient
example that I showed, one of the compounds did not normalize
until 2 years after resection that had been elevated before
resection.
I think we would need to look at more patients to determine
what time frame that these compounds do normalize and
whether resection actually does affect increase in the compound
because there may be some sort of inflammatory component too.
DR MILLER: In the squamous cell patients, maybe it was from
the squamous dysplasia or something going on in the airway that
did not allow them to normalize. Thank you.
DR MATTHEW G. BLUM (Colorado Springs, CO): I had two
questions, and one of them was, do you have any mechanism for
why cancers or cancer-related tissue would be producing these
particular compounds?
1099

BREATH ANALYSIS NORMALIZATION
GENERAL THORACIC
 And the other is, did you look at levels of these compounds in
patients who underwent resection for benign disease to see if
that also shifted their levels down even though they started with
relatively normal levels?
DR SCHUMER: To answer your second question first, we have
four patients that have benign disease that did undergo resec-
tion. Three of the four patients had zero elevated markers before
resection. After resection, they remain not elevated.
There is one patient that did have three elevated markers
before resection, and this did go down to zero. But, again, we
would have to look at a lot more patients.
DR BLUM: How about the other question?
DR SCHUMER: Oh, to answer your second question.
DR BLUM: Did you have any mechanism there?
DR SCHUMER: Really, we do not have a good idea of the
mechanism behind the elevation of these compounds. There
have been some papers by other groups that suggest P450 may
be involved in metabolism, but we do not have a good expla-
nation at this point.
DR JOSEPH B. SHRAGER (Stanford, CA): One question would
be, is there a difference between adenocarcinoma and squamous
with these markers?
And then the other one is, how about aggressiveness of the
tumors? For example, do they correlate with SUVmax or size of
the tumor or that sort of thing?
You did not really show us here, sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value. Are those sorts of statistics available in a pre-
vious study?
DR SCHUMER: Previously, we have looked at a range of
sensitivity and specificity, based on the cutoff level that we use
and the number of markers that are elevated. If you use one
marker at 1.5 standard deviations, which is what we used for this
study, it is about a 94% sensitivity. And, of course, that will go
down as the number of markers that you choose goes up.
As far as the difference between adenocarcinoma and squa-
mous cell carcinoma, no, we have not looked at that specifically,
but we have seen across the board all histologies, including small
cell lung cancer, that carbonyls are elevated. But we have not
compared the specific histologies.
DR SHRAGER: The more aggressive tumors by SUVmax or that
sort of thing, do they make more of this stuff?
DR SCHUMER: So the answer is yes. In one of our previous
papers, we did look at PET scans compared with breath anal-
ysis, and so for patients with later-stage disease, they are more
likely to have elevated markers than patients with early-stage
disease.
DR DANIEL L. MILLER (Marietta, GA): Can I ask one more
question? What is the cost of the test?
DR SCHUMER: The cost is cheap. There are up-front costs
involved, so you have to have a mass spectrometer, for example.
DR MILLER: How much are those running on Amazon these
days?
DR SCHUMER: I do not have a good answer to that. But the test
itself is cheap. It is around $30.
DR MILLER: Thank you. Nice job.
