ABSTRACT
Objectives: Hypertension is well established as a
major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although
there is undeniable evidence to support the beneficial
effects of antihypertensive therapy on morbidity and
mortality, adequate blood pressure management still
remains suboptimal. Research into the treatment of
hypertension has produced a multitude of drug classes
with different efficacy profiles. These agents include
β-blockers, diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin
receptor blockers and calcium channel blockers. One
of the oldest groups of antihypertensives, the calcium
channel blockers are a heterogeneous group of
medications.
Methods: This review paper will focus on amlodipine,
a dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, which has
been widely used for 2 decades.
Results: Amlodipine has good efficacy and safety, in
addition to strong evidence from large randomised
controlled trials for cardiovascular event reduction.
Conclusions: Amlodipine should be considered a
first-line antihypertensive agent.
INTRODUCTION
Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were first
introduced over 35 years ago initially for cor-
onary heart disease (CHD), but they soon
gained wide recognition for their efficacy in
hypertension (HTN). The initial indication,
besides HTN, also included angina, periph-
eral vascular disease and some arrhythmic
conditions.1 Amlodipine has many unique
qualities that set it apart from other agents in
this class. The aim of this review is to
compare amlodipine with other antihyper-
tensive agents with particular focus on the
ability to improve cardiovascular (CV) health
and reduce adverse CV outcomes.
CLINICAL INDICATIONS,
PHARMACODYNAMICS AND
PHARMACOKINETICS
Amlodipine is a long-acting, lipophilic, third
generation
dihydropyridine
(DHP)
CCBs
that exerts its action through inhibition of
calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle
cells and myocardial cells, which results in
decreased
peripheral
vascular
resistance
(PVR). Amlodipine is indicated for the treat-
ment of high blood pressure (BP)/HTN and
angina. In addition, a number of randomised
trials have ascertained its utility in angina
pectoris.2 Amlodipine is usually dosed on a
once daily basis because of its long half-life,
which is favourable for patient compliance. A
starting
dose
of
5 mg
is
usually
recom-
mended with a maximum daily dose of
10 mg. In the elderly population and those
with hepatic failure, a starting dose of 2.5 mg
is recommended. Amlodipine has a gradual
onset of action and hence no significant
reflex neuroendocrine activation. Activating
reflex mechanisms, such as increased PVR
and elevated heart rate, can cause negative
effects on lipid and carbohydrate metabol-
ism. These notable adverse effects are com-
monly seen with other agents including the
first generation β-blockers (BBs; such as aten-
olol and metoprolol) and earlier generation
of DHPs. Amlodipine has a high bioavailabil-
ity, ranging from 60% to 80%; it undergoes
hepatic
metabolism
and
shows
some

 impaired elimination in the setting of liver cirrhosis but
no accumulation with renal failure. Amlodipine also has
a slow rate of elimination over 40–60 hours. If amlodi-
pine is discontinued, BP generally returns to baseline
over 1 week without any dangerous rebound elevations
in BP (unlike clonidine).3
SIDE EFFECT PROFILE
The most commonly reported adverse effect hindering
compliance with
amlodipine
is
peripheral
oedema.
However, this adverse effect can be minimised if the
agent is given at bedtime, and lower doses (2.5 or
5 mg/day) are used. Indeed, the bedtime administration
of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system was
associated with a 93% reduction in oedema compared
with morning dosing (1% vs 13%, p<0.001, respect-
ively).4 Other reported side effects include dizziness,
fatigue, headache, palpitations and nausea, although
these are generally not bothersome enough to cause dis-
continuation of the drug. Amlodipine is contraindicated
in breastfeeding women, cardiogenic shock and unstable
angina. Also, its vasodilatory effect can lead to decreased
cardiac output in the setting of aortic stenosis.
ROLE AS MONOTHERAPY IN HTN
Several HTN trials have investigated the efficacy of
amlodipine monotherapy versus other agents, including
diuretics, ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin recep-
tor blockers (ARBs). The outcomes of these trials suggest
that amlodipine has a neutral effect on several pre-
existing comorbid states, which will be discussed below.
The Comparison of Amlodipine versus Enalapril to
Limit Occurrence of Thrombosis (CAMELOT) trial,
enrolled 1991 patients with angiographically documen-
ted coronary artery disease (CAD) and randomised
them to amlodipine 10 mg, enalapril 20 mg, or placebo
and followed them over 24 months. Atherosclerotic pro-
gression was also assessed in a substudy of 274 patients
as well using intravascular ultrasound. Although the
baseline BP was low to begin with, 129/78, both groups
showed similar BP lowering, 4.8/2.5 and 4.9/2.4 for
amlodipine and enalapril, respectively. Amlodipine sig-
nificantly reduced non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI)
by 26% and stroke or transient ischaemic attack by 50%
(number needed to treat=16), whereas enalapril had no
significant benefit compared with placebo.5 Moreover,
there was a statistically significant reduction in hospital-
isation rate for angina (p=0.003) with amlodipine versus
enalapril. This study suggests that normotensive patients
treated with amlodipine show reduced rates of CV events
and hospitalisations compared with enalapril and evi-
dence of slowing of atherosclerotic progression.5
A Japanese study, although small, investigated the
effect of losartan and amlodipine on left ventricular
(LV) diastolic function in patients with mild-to-moderate
HTN. LV diastolic dysfunction has a direct correlation
with LV hypertrophy (LVH) and myocardial fibrosis.
Previous trials have established the beneficial role of
ACEIs on cardiac remodelling but other studies with
ARBs versus amlodipine showed a greater benefit in
the CCB class. Thus, the effect of losartan and amlodi-
pine on LV diastolic function and atherosclerosis in
Japanese patients with mild-to-moderate HTN ( J-ELAN)
trial was undertaken to compare the effects of an ARB
(losartan) versus a CCB (amlodipine) on LV diastolic
dysfunction. J-ELAN enrolled 57 patients with LVH and
mild-to-moderate HTN and randomised them to either
losartan or amlodipine.6 The doses of these drugs were
uptitrated over an 18-month period and then other
anti-HTN agents were added, to achieve goal BP control,
except those agents that affect LVH such as ACEIs,
ARBs, other CCBs or BBs. Both groups showed similar
reduction in BP but the losartan group had a greater
effect on carotid intimal–medial thickness.7 In addition,
there was no significant difference in terms of LV mass
in the two groups. These findings suggest that amlodi-
pine is non-inferior to ARBs with respect to its effects on
LV remodelling.6 7
The
ALLHAT
(Antihypertensive
Lipid-Lowering
Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) was one of
the largest BP trials performed to date, which enrolled
over 33 000 patients with HTN and one CHD risk factor.
The objective of this landmark trial was to determine
whether the incidence of CHD or other CV diseases
would be lower in those patients treated with a CCB, an
ACEI,
or
a
diuretic.
Patients
were
randomised
to
chlorthalidone, amlodipine, or lisinopril with a mean
follow-up
of
about
4.9 years.8
Primary
outcomes
included fatal CHD or non-fatal MI and secondary out-
comes included all-cause mortality. There was no signifi-
cant difference among the groups for the reduction in
the primary or secondary outcome of all-cause mortality.
It was determined that thiazide diuretics are superior in
preventing one or more forms of CV disease and also
since they are less expensive should be a first-line agent
in the treatment of HTN. However, other commentaries
suggested that this finding may be attributed to the fact
that thiazides are better at treating volume-dependent
HTN, such as the elderly and African-Americans who
comprised a large portion of the patient demographics
for this study.8–10 Although this may be the case, this
very large study showed that amlodipine was neither
superior nor inferior to thiazide diuretics or ACEIs in
managing
HTN
in
patients
with
other
comorbid
conditions.10
Studies have shown that nitric oxide (NO) production
is diminished in patients with HTN.11 12 A small study
carried out by Masayoshi and colleagues measured
exhaled NO in seven previously untreated participants
to assess whether amlodipine has an effect on NO.13
Their study found that NO production in the pulmonary
circulation was increased as evidenced by increased NO
measurements in exhaled air after 2 months of amlodi-
pine therapy. Another small study by Zhang and collea-
gues evaluated NO production in explanted hearts,

 which were harvested during transplant. Previous studies
suggest that NO release from endothelial cells is a kinin-
mediated mechanism. Kinins are usually degraded by
ACE. ACEIs facilitate the accumulation of these com-
pounds, which was the rational for enlisting ramiprilat
for
comparison.14
While
amlodipine
was
found
to
increase NO production in these failing hearts, it was
similar to the NO production noted with ramiprilat. The
authors postulated that this may be one of the mechan-
isms of amlodipine’s beneficial effects in heart failure
(HF), which is not a feature shared by other members
of the CCB class. Thus, the enhancement of NO pro-
duction may account for the beneficial effects of this
drug on the CV system.14 Additionally, amlodipine has
anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects giving it vaso-
protective effects
beyond
its
BP-lowering
benefits.15
Interestingly, these benefits were noted by the authors to
be caused by an increase in endothelial NO synthase
expression and inhibition of ACE. Thus, amlodipine
may even be beneficial for patients with high renin
HTN.15
The VALUE (Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term
Use Evaluation) trial was another large trial enrolling
over 15 000 patients with HTN who were previously
treated with anti-HTN therapy.16 This study looked at
the efficacy of amlodipine versus valsartan in attaining a
BP goal of <140/90. The doses were uptitrated to 10 mg
of amlodipine or 160 mg of valsartan. Two additional
steps were done that included adding hydrochlorothia-
zide (HCTZ) then another agent (excluding ACEIs,
ARBs or other CCBs). The outcomes showed that both
monotherapy groups had similar improvements in BP
with average BPs in the 130s/80s for both groups.
However, valsartan caused a significant increase (19%,
p=0.02) in total MI (fatal and nonfatal) in comparison
with amlodipine. Although some have criticised these
results due to the faster BP lowering of amlodipine early
on, the Kaplan-Meier MI curves indicated that as BP
became similar between the two groups (as the trial pro-
gressed), the curves continued to diverge; suggesting a
BP-independent beneficial effect on MI with amlodipine
versus valsartan. New-onset diabetes was reported in 580
(11.5%) patients on valsartan and in 718 (14.5%)
patients on amlodipine.16 17
The
Fosinopril
versus
Amlodipine
Cardiovascular
Events Randomized Trial (FACET) showed different
results on fasting glucose levels. The goal of the FACET
was to compare the effects of these two agents on lipid
and diabetes control in patients with HTN.18 Three
hundred and eighty patients were randomised to 20 mg
of fosinopril or 10 mg of amlodipine daily with a
follow-up period of 3.5 years. Results showed no differ-
ence on the lipid profiles or fasting glucose levels.
However, fosinopril was associated with a 38.5% relative
risk reduction (RRR) in the combined end point (fatal
or non-fatal stroke and fatal or non-fatal MI; RR=0.6151,
95% CI 0.3266 to 1.1587). These findings suggest that
while amlodipine may have similar effects on BP control,
fosinopril may have a greater benefit for the reduction
of
stroke/MI.
However,
this trial
enrolled
a
small
number of patients and the thus the CIs were wide and
the CV event reduction with fosinopril was not signifi-
cant compared with amlodipine. A larger trial is needed
to clarify these results.18
Another study by Mugellini and colleagues looked at
391 patients with metabolic syndrome who had at least
two episodes of atrial fibrillation (AF) in 6 months.19
These patients were randomised to telmisartan, ramipril
or amlodipine for 12 months and results showed that all
three groups similarly reduced both systolic and diastolic
BP
. In terms of the AF however, telmisartan showed the
greatest effect on reducing recurrence.19
ATHEROSCLEROSIS AND CAD
Calcium regulation has been implicated in the patho-
genesis of atherosclerotic plaque formation, which has
generated interest in the potential role for this CCB in
the prevention of atherosclerosis.20 Several mechanisms
have been proposed to account for amlodipine’s poten-
tial benefit in atherosclerosis. In vivo and in vitro studies
suggest that amlodipine inhibits oxidative damage to the
lipid bilayer of the cell membrane and this has been
attributed to its lipophilicity and chemical structure,
which prevents the formation of free radicals. This
process is prevented by the donation of protons by this
drug to lipid peroxide molecules. In atherogenesis,
the packing of phospholipid molecules becomes disar-
rayed and this causes swelling of the lipid bilayer, which
is an impetus for smooth muscle proliferation and ather-
oma development. Enhancement of NO production has
been proposed as a potential reason for amlodipine’s
antiatherosclerotic effect. Zhang and Hintze21 noted
increased NO production in canine coronary microvas-
culature, which was an unexpected feature of this CCB
and is not a quality that is shared by other members of
its class. Additionally, amlodipine has been shown to
upregulate the expression of interleukins, which may
also have antiproliferative effects, and to have favourable
effects on extracellular matrix remodelling.22 23
One of the pivotal trials assessing amlodipine’s role in
atherosclerosis
was
the
Prospective
Randomized
Evaluation
of
the
Vascular
Effects
of
Norvasc
(PREVENT) trial. PREVENT assessed the development
and
progression
of
atherosclerosis
in
patients with
known
CAD.
This
was
a
multicentre,
randomised,
placebo-controlled, double-blinded study, which looked
at
825
patients
with
angiographically
documented
CAD.20 Patients were followed over a 3-year period and
the primary end point was change in mean diameter
over 36 months in segments with a baseline of 30% sten-
osis. It has been suggested that acute coronary syndrome
does not usually result from more stable plaques but
rather
rupture
of
minimal
lesions.
PREVENT also
assessed the rate of progression of carotid atherosclerosis
which was assessed by CIMT. The data showed that there

 was no effect on the risk of all-cause mortality or major
CV events, and amlodipine did not alter the develop-
ment of or slow the progression of CAD lesions.
However, there was a statistically significant effect on the
progression of carotid artery atherosclerosis (p=0.007).24
Yet, the study had low statistical power for the detection
of a treatment difference in mortality and major morbid-
ity rates because of the relatively low event rates (ie,
<2%/year for MI). When major and other documented
vascular events/procedures were combined (increasing
the power to determine an effect), there were fewer
events in the amlodipine group. Additionally, amlodi-
pine did show reduced rates of unstable angina and cor-
onary revascularisation, which is comparable to data
seen with treatment with BB, nitrates and lipid-lowering
agents. Angiographic trials with nifedipine or nicardi-
pine
did
not
show
these
effects.
The
authors
of
PREVENT did report that when the event rates for
unstable angina and coronary revascularisation were
assessed closely, these curves diverged very early (in the
first year). Thus, while amlodipine may not have shown
a significant role in prevention of progression of early
coronary atherosclerotic lesions, it does have a beneficial
effect in reducing hospitalisation rates for angina and
coronary revascularisation.24 In the randomised trial
Coronary
Angioplasty
Amlodipine
Restenosis
Study
(CAPARES), patients had a reduced incidence of repeat
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty when
treated with amlodipine.25

management.
Although many of these trials show that amlodipine is
not superior to other agents in preventing CAD, it can
be safely used in patients with CAD for the management
of HTN.
ROLE IN RENOPROTECTION
In the ACCOMPLISH trial, HCTZ was inferior to amlo-
dipine for the prevention of end-stage renal disease.
Furthermore, in patients who were >65 years old at base-
line, there was a 70% RRR in patients progressing to dia-
lysis in the amlodipine group versus the HCTZ group
(p=0.053, for the difference).26 In the intention-to-treat
population, the amlodipine group had a 48% RRR for
chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, defined as
doubling of serum creatinine, estimated glomerular fil-
tration rate (eGFR) <15 mL/min, or dialysis compared
with the HCTZ group. Furthermore, patients with CKD,
defined as an eGFR of 45.1 mL/min at baseline, showed
a significantly greater decline in renal function with
HCTZ
versus
amlodipine
(−2.3
vs
−1.6 mL/min;
p=0.001).26 27
ROLE IN HF
Traditionally CCBs were discontinued for the treatment
of angina or HTN in patients with HF. Previous studies
with CCBs such as nifedipine, have shown unfavourable
effects due to reflex stimulation of the sympathetic
nervous system and negative inotropic effects, features
not seen with amlodipine.28–30 Thus, amlodipine may be
safe in patients with HF.31 The Prospective Randomized
Amlodipine Survival Evaluation (PRAISE) trial estab-
lished the safety of amlodipine for angina and HTN in
patients with advanced LV dysfunction (amlodipine).32
The PRAISE trial studied over 1100 patients with severe
ischaemic
and
non-ischaemic
New
York
Heart
Association class III and IV HF with an LV ejection frac-
tion (LVEF) of <30% despite being on digoxin, diuretics
or an ACEI. They were also allowed to be on a nitrate
but no other vasodilating therapy. They were rando-
mised to either amlodipine or placebo and followed for
33 months. There was no significant difference in the
primary end point (combined risk of all-cause mortality
and CV disease morbidity) with amlodipine treatment;
although amlodipine did show a 9% risk reduction of a
primary fatal or non-fatal event. There was a difference
however, in the non-ischaemic HF group, where amlodi-
pine showed a 46% reduction in mortality.32
The PRAISE trial showed that amlodipine did not
affect the natural history of HF or increase the risk of
death as other trials with CCBs have suggested.31 The
investigators pointed out that it was interesting that
amlodipine seemed to greatly benefit the non-ischaemic
group. The PRAISE II trial was then carried out to
further investigate the potential for amlodipine to reduce
mortality in the non-ischaemic group. This trial looked at
1652 patients with normal arteriograms but with the sys-
tolic HF and average LVEF was 21%. There was no signifi-
cant difference found between the amlodipine versus
placebo group in terms of all-cause or CV disease mortal-
ity or CV disease events. Taken together, PRAISE I and II
suggest that amlodipine can be safely used to treat angina
or HTN in patients with coexisting HF
.33 34
ROLE IN COMBINATION THERAPY FOR HTN
While thus far amlodipine has shown to be non-inferior
to many other anti-HTN therapies, the focus on HTN
treatment seems to be shifting more towards combin-
ation therapy. Less than 50% of patients with stage I or
II HTN are adequately controlled with monotherapy,
and thus initial treatment for HTN in the majority of
patients will require two agents. The classical approach
to treating HTN where one first-line agent is maximised
before another is added may be flawed since this is a
multifactorial disease often occurring with a number of
comorbidities. Many studies show that individuals with
more CV risk factors generally need more anti-HTN
agents to successfully manage their BP
. Combination
therapy using different mechanisms can lead to more
effective BP lowering. In addition, combination therap-
ies block counter-regulatory mechanisms that often limit
the
efficacy
of
monotherapy.
Furthermore,
using
multiple agents to lower doses may reduce side effects,
and thus improve patient compliance.

 The issue arises as to which fixed combinations
provide the most benefits. Thiazides in combination
with ACEIs or ARBs have synergistic BP-lowering activity,
whereas thiazides and BBs have deleterious effects on
the metabolic profile. CCBs are powerful vasodilators
but can result in renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system
(RAAS) activation, thus an ACEI or ARB counteracts this
mechanism and leads to enhanced antihypertensive
effect. Growing evidence from trial data also shows that
CCBs with ACEIs or ARBs may provide the best long-
term outcomes.
The ACCOMPLISH trial was a randomised, controlled
trial in which 11 506 patients with HTN with high risk
for adverse CV events were assigned amlodipine+benaze-
pril versus HCTZ+benazepril.35 The primary end point
was the composite of CV death or major adverse CV
events. The amlodipine+benazepril combination was
superior to the HCTZ+benazepril for lowering CV death
and adverse events (figure 1).35
The
Anglo-Scandinavian
Cardiac
Outcomes
Trial
(ASCOT) included a total of 19 257 patients with HTN
(baseline BP
, 164/95 mm Hg) and at least three other
cardiac risk factors.36 This trial, which was stopped
for benefit after 5.5 years, showed that the amlodipine
+perindopril versus atenolol+thiazide diuretic signifi-
cantly reduced all-cause mortality (RRR, 11%; p=0.0247;
figure 2). Additionally, amlodipine+perindopril reduced
CV mortality by 24% (p=0.001), coronary events by 13%
(p=0.007) and strokes by 23% (p=0.0003).37 At the
point where rates of CV death diverged (red arrow)
most of the patients (78%) were treated with the com-
bination of perindopril+amlodipine rather than amlodi-
pine monotherapy.36
The
Assessment
of
combination
Therapy
of
Amlodipine/Ramipril (ATAR) study was an 18-week ran-
domised
prospective
double-blinded
Brazilian
study
which compared the combination of amlodipine and
ramipril versus amlodipine monotherapy. The mean
changes in ambulatory BP measurements were statistic-
ally significant between the combination versus the
amlodipine
monotherapy
group,
18.7%
vs
7.6%,
p=0.011, respectively. In addition, the reported inci-
dence of peripheral oedema was lower in the combin-
ation group.38
The Candesartan and Diuretic versus Amlodipine in
hypertensive patients (CANDIA) trial evaluated cande-
sartan+HCTZ combination versus amlodipine monother-
apy.39 This multicentre, double-blinded, randomised
trial assessed patients with mild-to-moderate HTN not
adequately controlled with monotherapy. After 8 weeks
of therapy, there was no significant difference between
the
two
groups.
Systolic
BP
decreased
by
about
15 mm Hg; however, there was a higher discontinuation
rate with amlodipine versus the combination drug due
to peripheral oedema, 18% vs 6%, respectively. These
findings suggest that while both agents are effective in
lowering BP
, the candesartan+HCTZ combination was
better tolerated and hence may lead to better patient
compliance.39
The Combination of Olmesartan Medoxomil and
Amlodipine Besylate in Controlling High blood Pressure
(COACH) study was a study evaluating an ARB+amlodi-
pine combination versus placebo.40 The 1940 patients in
this 8-week treatment study showed achievement of BP
goals (<140/90) with the combination therapy and
again, a lower incidence of peripheral oedema.40 These
findings
were
echoed
in
the
Telmisartan
plus
Amlodipine Study in amlodipine 5 mg (TEAMSTA-5),
which tested another ARB+amlodipine combination.
The study showed that the combination of telmisartan
40/80 mg plus amlodipine 5 mg was superior to amlodi-
pine 10 mg monotherapy.41
CCBs are potent vasodilators and hence reduce BP
effectively but can result in RAAS activation. Therefore,
the rational for a CCB/RAAS inhibitor combination
drug would theoretically provide vasodilation while buf-
fering RAAS activation. Another combination with RAAS
blocker and HCTZ has been shown to be effective.
Triple therapy with valsartan+amlodipine+HCTZ was
compared with dual combination with valsartan+HCTZ,

 amlodipine+valsartan or amlodipine+HCTZ. This was a
randomised, double-blinded study in 2271 patients with
moderate-to-severe HTN. The goal was to attain a BP
goal of <140/90. The outcomes showed that this triple
therapy combination was superior to any of the dual
combination drugs at reducing sitting systolic and dia-
stolic BP (p<0.0001). The more pronounced findings
were in those with higher baseline BP and the results
were consistent over all ages, genders and ethnicities.
The adverse events reported were similar across all treat-
ment groups and included peripheral oedema as the
most common, along with headache and dizziness.42
CONCLUSION
Amlodipine is an excellent first-line choice among the
myriad options of antihypertensive agents. In the studies
discussed in this manuscript, amlodipine was highly
effective for the treatment of HTN and stable angina as
evidenced by the fewer hospitalisations for unstable
angina and revascularisation in randomised controlled
trials. Amlodipine has also shown robust reductions on
CV end points (especially stroke) but has not altered the
prognosis in HF. Its abilities to prevent activation of
counter-regulatory mechanisms, to slow the progression
of atherosclerosis, to confer antioxidant properties and
to enhance NO production are all unique actions. The
management of HTN is shifting more towards dual or
even triple combination therapy and requires a patient
profiling approach as the number of comorbid states
increases. Amlodipine is a superior option in the HTN
armamentarium, not only for controlling BP but also for
safely improving patient outcomes.
