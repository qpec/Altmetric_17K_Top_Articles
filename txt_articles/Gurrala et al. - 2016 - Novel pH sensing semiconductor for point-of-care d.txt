The timely detection of viremia in HIV-infected patients receiving antiviral treatment is key to ensuring 
effective therapy and preventing the emergence of drug resistance. In high HIV burden settings, the 
cost and complexity of diagnostics limit their availability. We have developed a novel complementary 
metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) chip based, pH-mediated, point-of-care HIV-1 viral load monitoring 
assay that simultaneously amplifies and detects HIV-1 RNA. A novel low-buffer HIV-1 pH-LAMP (loop-
mediated isothermal amplification) assay was optimised and incorporated into a pH sensitive CMOS 
chip. Screening of 991 clinical samples (164 on the chip) yielded a sensitivity of 95% (in vitro) and 88.8% 
(on-chip) at >1000 RNA copies/reaction across a broad spectrum of HIV-1 viral clades. Median time 
to detection was 20.8 minutes in samples with >1000 copies RNA. The sensitivity, specificity and 
reproducibility are close to that required to produce a point-of-care device which would be of benefit in 
resource poor regions, and could be performed on an USB stick or similar low power device.
Most of the 39 million individuals infected with HIV-1 live in sub-Saharan Africa in countries with limited infra-
structure for healthcare delivery1,2. Whilst the key to reducing HIV-1 mortality is access to combination antiret-
roviral therapy (cART), regular monitoring is required to ensure effective therapy and detect treatment failure as 
early as possible in order to minimize the emergence of drug resistant virus3.
In well-resourced settings, the cornerstone of monitoring requires regular HIV-1 viral load assays (viral RNA 
copies per ml of plasma), usually performed on a large laboratory platform device4. Access to such technology is 
limited in many countries with a high HIV-1 burden and, where available, patients may have to make challenging 
return journeys to their clinics to receive results. Alternatives to viral load testing, such as measuring CD4 count, 
have limitations5. The challenges that inaccessible, and often unaffordable, viral load technologies pose to the 
delivery of high quality care for HIV-1 patients are now well recognised and improving diagnostics is now a key 
part of global strategies to combat the infection6.
The pipeline for novel viral load detection technologies is becoming more dynamic. Several devices are now 
available that are close to market1,7–9, others are in development. Despite this, most of these devices require a desktop 
instrument and laboratory processing which, whilst it has the potential to reduce costs, is still likely to limit access.
Here we describe a novel approach to HIV-1 viral load detection based on a novel CMOS chip platform that is 
able to detect small changes in pH generated by on-chip reactions10. The chip has embedded heaters and thermal 
sensors that facilitate on-chip nucleic acid amplification, and the hydrogen ions produced during DNA polym-
erisation are detected and quantified via the on board ISFET (Ion Sensing Field Effect Transistors) pH detection 
sensors (Fig. 1). The method is capable of working on a USB compatible stick without the need for additional 
power supply, labelling or fluorescence detection and with the potential for operation without a desktop platform. 
We describe the design and evaluation of an isothermal, low buffer, pH RT-LAMP reaction and demonstration of 
its efficacy with the CMOS technology.

RNA standards were amplified in pH RT-LAMP tube reactions with varying concentrations of deoxynucleotides 
(dNTPs), betaine, MgSO4, and KCl. (Supplementary Fig. 1a–d). All reactions were carried out in triplicate with

an input of 1000 RNA copies at 60 °C for 30 minutes. From these experiments, concentrations of 1 mM dNTPs, 
0.4 mM betaine, 6 mM MgSO4 and 50 mM KCl were selected for use in subsequent pH RT-LAMP assays.
Validation of pH RT-LAMP assay on RNA standards. 
Sensitivity of the optimised pH RT-LAMP assay 
was determined by 10-fold serial dilution of cloned RNA. Results are shown in Fig. 2. The lowest detection limit of 
10 RNA copies were successfully verified in a series of quadruplicate RT-LAMP reactions performed on 3 separate 
occasions. These experiments demonstrated that the pH RT-LAMP reaction in a tube assay could detect 10 RNA 
copies within the stipulated time. The observation of occasional low-level signals from negative reactions defined 
the cut-off time for a positive reaction as < 
30 minutes.
Validation of pH RT-LAMP assay on HIV-1 RNA extracted from human plasma. 
HIV-1 RNA extracts 
from 991 plasma samples covering a wide range of clades and copy numbers were tested in the pH RT-LAMP tube 
assay in duplicate. Figure 3a shows the percentages of positive reactions plotted against template RNA copies per 
reaction. The detection rate for inputs >1000 copies/reaction was 95%, for inputs of 50 to 1000 copies, 88.7% and for 
inputs < 
50 copies/reaction 41.2%. Figure 3b shows the intra-assay variability for the duplicate samples.

pH change in RT-LAMP assay. 
The drop in the pH post-amplification observed in the positive reactions 
was measured in RT-LAMP assays on RNA standards and 19 RNA extracts from human plasma. Figure 4 shows 
the pH pre- and post-amplification, for positive reactions and no-template reaction controls [NTC] (water).
Validation of chip pH RT-LAMP assays on RNA from human plasma. 
HIV-1 RNA extracted from 
164 clinical plasma samples was analysed in the on-chip pH LAMP assay together with 18 NTCs. All reactions 
were performed at 60 °C for 50 minutes. A typical signal output from the detection chip is shown in Fig. 5. The 
proportions of positive reactions were 31/35 (88.8%) for inputs >1000 copies, 48/63 (76.1%) 50–1000 copies and 
14/66 (21.2%) < 
50 copies. Data are shown in Table 1.
Discussion
We describe proof-of concept for a novel method for point-of-care (POC) detection of HIV-1 viremia. We show 
that RT pH-LAMP is feasible in low buffer conditions, performs well across a wide range of clinical isolates and, 
through electronic detection of pH change, is able to distinguish positive from negative samples when run on 
a CMOS chip. The system as evaluated incorporates many of the requirements for an assay that can be used in 
field conditions with minimal laboratory infrastructure, including the lack of a need for refrigeration. The USB 
mounted device can potentially operate with any suitably configured hand-held computer device and has no other 
requirement for a mains power supply. In addition, the system needs no complex equipment requiring skilled 
calibration or maintenance and utilises a self-contained, disposable detection system which is potentially very 
cheap to manufacture by standard silicon-chip production methods. The underlying approach has been applied 
to Ion Torrent DNA sequencing technology11 and underpins a commercial DNA testing service12. However, this 
is the first report of pH mediated on-chip detection of RNA.
The development of HIV RT pH-LAMP was chosen over other amplification methods for three reasons; the 
isothermal nature of the reaction simplifies the technical challenges of thermal cycling on the chip (though such 
cycling is possible) and, more importantly, the use of LAMP generates higher concentrations of amplification 
products13 which, through greater changes in pH, improves the sensitivity and speed of the assay. Thirdly, LAMP 
is less perturbed by non-specific inhibitors than PCR14, allowing the potential for less stringent RNA preparation 
in a final integrated device, unlike PCR. LAMP has previously been used to detect HIV-1 RNA using alternative 
read-out platforms, such as turbidimetry and fluorimetry15. One advantage of the approach described here is the 
potential to multiplex different assays on one CMOS chip. After evaluating targets (and combinations of targets)

in the HIV-1 gag and pol genes, our method uses primer sequences targeted to the integrase gene in common 
with published LAMP methods and laboratory-based commercial PCR assays. In addition, we were able to meet 
the challenges or viral diversity and improve sensitivity across a wide range of clinical isolates through the use of 
redundant bases and inosine.
The data generated show that the RT pH-LAMP reaction, as designed, is capable of detecting low copy num-
bers (down to 10 RNA copies/reaction) of RNA transcripts cloned from the HIV-1 integrase gene. The time to 
generate a positive reaction was 30 minutes using fluorescent detection, extending to a maximum of 50 minutes 
when the reaction was performed on the pH-sensitive silicon chip with low copy number. The cases of false neg-
ative results at this detection limit were not biased to any particular HIV-1 clade (Supplementary Table 3a,b) and 
sequencing studies (not published) could not determine any LAMP primer mismatches that could explain the 
failure to amplify.
While laboratory based HIV-1 viral load detection systems in well-resourced clinical settings are able to 
detect an HIV-1 viral load of 50 copies/ml or lower, such sensitivity is not required for the monitoring of ART in 
resource-poor settings. Modelling demonstrates that thresholds of 1000 copies/ml or even 5000 copies/ml may 
be acceptable16 and more cost-effective and WHO recommendations suggest that detection of viral loads > 
1000 
copies/ml have sufficient sensitivity17. The detection rate of 95% for the LAMP reaction at > 
1000 copies/reaction 
using fluorescent detection is encouraging, but before the method can be considered suitable for field use, it will 
need to be integrated with an efficient RNA extraction method capable of achieving high yields of nucleic acid 
from peripheral blood. The optimisation data here shows that high sensitivity can be achieved if sufficient target 
RNA is in the assay. The sensitivity of the assay on the chip was slightly lower than that seen in vitro (88.8% and 
95% respectively) (Table 1) which is most likely a consequence of the low reaction volume (12 × 
 0.6 μ 
l/reaction) 
compared to the fluorescent output (1 × 
 25 μ 
l) and this may account for some reduction in the rate of detection. 
As well as maximising the quantity of viral nucleic acid that can be delivered to the chip, further optimisation of 
the size of the reaction chambers is planned which could potentially improve sensitivity further. A second gener-
ation chip that can hold more than 7.2 μ 
l/reaction is being tested for deployment and it is anticipated that it would 
match the performance of the fluorescence based RT-LAMP for HIV-1.
Whilst further development is required, including an evaluation of specificity across a wide range of clinical 
isolates before field evaluations, our HIV specific pH-LAMP assay coupled with novel CMOS chip technology 
shows great potential as a route to a point of care diagnostic suitable for use in clinical settings without access to 
a laboratory infrastructure, as is often the case in the developing world. The technology has the potential to be 
scalable for the detection of multiple pathogens simultaneously and this will be part of future programme of work.
Methods
Synthesis of RNA standards. 
Preliminary RT-LAMP assay development and optimisation was undertaken 
using cloned RNA transcripts of the complete HIV-1 integrase (IN) coding region. The IN coding region of the 8E5 
strain of HIV-1 (clade B) was amplified by nested PCR using primers 5′ 
-CTCACAGTATGCATTAGGAATYAT 
and 5′ 
-CCTTATGGCAGATTCTGAAAAACA in the first round and 5′ 
-GCACACAAAGGAATTGGAGGAAAT 
and 5′ 
-TAGTGGGATGTGTACTTCTGAACT in the second round. The PCR products were cloned into the 
pCR 2.1-TOPO Vector (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). DNA was extracted using a Plasmid Minikit (Qiagen, 
Manchester, UK) and the plasmid linearized by digestion with restriction enzyme Pst1 (New England Biolabs, 
Hitchin, UK). RNA transcripts were made using the MEGAScript T7 polymerase kit (Life Technologies) according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Post-transcription, the nucleic acid was DNAse digested (DNAse 1 amplifica-
tion grade, Life Technologies) for 30 minutes at 37 °C and RNA extracted with the QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen).

pH RT-LAMP. 
The pH RT-LAMP assay was initially developed and optimised on a real-time thermal cycler 
by including SYBR- Green dye in the reaction mix (referred to as the “tube assay”). Validation of the developed 
method was performed using both cloned RNA and RNA extracts from clinical samples on the real-time thermal 
cycler and the CMOS chip platform. To allow detection on the chip platform, a modified master-mix formulation 
that minimises buffering (pH-LAMP) was used, and the reactions included reverse transcriptase to allow ampli-
fication of the RNA target (pH RT-LAMP).
Primer sequences used throughout are given in Supplementary Table 1. The final optimised reaction 
master-mix contained 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM NH4Cl, 3% Siloxane (Invitrogen, USA), 1 mg/ml BSA, 0.4 M betaine 
(Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK), 1 mM dNTPs, 6 mM MgSO4, 0.2 mM NaOH, 0.4x SYBR Green [stock 10,000x] (Life 
Technologies), 0.2 μ 
M of each outer primer, F3 and R3, 1.6 μ 
M of each inner primer, FIP and RIP, 0.8 μ 
M of each 
loop primer, FLP and RPL, 24U BST polymerase (New England Biolabs), 2.25U AMV reverse transcriptase (Life 
Technologies) and 10 μ 
l template, with the final reaction volume adjusted to 25 μ 
l with H2O. The pH RT-LAMP 
reaction conditions comprised of a one-step reverse transcription and DNA amplification at 60 °C for 30 minutes, 
with a reading taken every minute. The assay was performed on a real-time thermal cycler (MX3000p, Stratagene, 
USA). The pH changes in tube reactions were measured with a Titan handheld micro pH probe (Sentron, Leek, 
Netherlands) before and after the reaction took place. The master-mix for chip pH RT-LAMP assay was identical 
to the tube reactions excluding SYBR-green. Five times the volume (125 μ 
l) of master-mix plus target was applied 
to the chip and the reaction was allowed to process for 50 minutes at 60 °C.
PCR analysis of LAMP amplicons. 
LAMP reactions generate a distinctive ladder pattern when ana-
lysed by agarose gel electrophoresis. To verify the specificity of the pH RT-LAMP assay, the amplified products 
were diluted 10-fold in water and run on a 2% agarose gel stained with SYBR-Safe dye (Life Technologies). The 
specificity of LAMP amplicons was verified by PCR amplification. Briefly, 2 μ 
l of the diluted RT- LAMP prod-
ucts were added to 10 μ 
l 2x Fast Cycling PCR master-mix (Qiagen) containing 1 μ 
l each of the forward primer, 
 
5′- 
CAATTTTAAAAGAAAAGGGGGGATT and the reverse primer, 5′ 
-TACTGCCCCTTCACCTTTCCA in a 
final 20 μ 
l reaction volume. The PCR reactions were carried out with an initial denaturation step of 95 °C for 
15 minutes followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 10 seconds and 60 °C for 60 seconds. PCR products were visualised 
by agarose gel electrophoresis.
Clinical samples. 
To validate the tube assay, HIV-1 RNA was extracted from 991 human plasma samples 
with detectable viral load assayed by a commercial assay (Versant v3.0, Bayer). The use of anonymised residual 
samples from routine HIV viral load testing for assay development was approved by the local research ethics 
committee of St Mary’s Hospital Paddington and the study used materials provided by the local Communicable 
Disease Research Tissue Bank (Ethics refs H15/SC/0089, 09/H0606/106). RNA from human plasma was extracted 
using the Viral RNA Minikit (Qiagen) in accordance with approved guidelines. The clade distribution of the sam-
ples, derived from protease-RT sequence data generated in routine resistance testing, is shown in Supplementary 
Table 2. For validation of the assay on the CMOS chip, RNA from 164 samples was extracted.
pH RT-LAMP on CMOS chip. 
The CMOS chip used consists of 4 smaller quad chips, each containing 3 
micro fluidic chambers that individually hold a reaction volume of 0.6 μ 
l, giving a total reaction volume on the 
chip of 7.2 μ 
l. The RT-LAMP mixture was pipetted through the opening at the top and was uniformly distributed 
to all chambers via the micro fluidic channels. The chip was inserted into the chip holder and reaction was pow-
ered via a standard USB port on a PC. Bespoke software on the PC converted the pH data received by the ISFETs 
to filtered digital information, which could be visualised real-time on the screen via graphic user interface in the 
form of a plot of the mV of signal produced and the time of reaction in seconds. A chip reaction is considered 
positive if ≥ 
1 chambers produces pH inflection within 50 minutes of run time.
