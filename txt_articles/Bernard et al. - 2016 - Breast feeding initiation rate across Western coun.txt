ABSTRACT
Background: Breast feeding initiation rates remain
below 80% in some Western countries. Many
individual-level determinants are known; however, less
is known regarding cultural and societal determinants,
such as religion, that could explain population-level
variations. We examined the correlations of the
proportions of Catholics and Protestants with the
breast feeding initiation rates across and within
Western countries.
Methods: Using publicly available data, we carried out
an ecological study comparing the proportions of
Catholics and Protestants with the rates of breast
feeding initiation. We correlated data at the country
level, and additionally explored within-country data in
five Western countries: France (Departments), Ireland
(counties), the UK (countries), Canada (provinces) and
the USA (states). Our analyses accounted for human
development index, gross domestic product and
population density.
Results: We observed a negative correlation (r=−0.30)
between the proportion of Catholics and the rate of
breast feeding initiation in Western countries. This
correlation was consistent when using within-country
data in France (r=−0.27), Ireland (r=−0.23), the UK
(r=−0.79) and Canada (r=−0.62). In the USA, the
positive correlation (r=0.26) between a state’s
proportion of Catholics and its breast feeding initiation
rate was confounded by race, education and
socioeconomic status (SES). After controlling for
education and SES, the state proportion of non-
Hispanic white Catholics was negatively correlated
(r=−0.29) with the rate of breast feeding initiation.
Conclusions: In this ecological study, we found
consistent negative correlations between Catholicism
and breast feeding initiation rates. Qualitative and
quantitative studies at the individual level are needed to
confirm and explain our findings. Our results suggest
that women living in a country or region where
Catholicism has historically dominated are less likely to
initiate breast feeding, and that breast feeding
promotion policies should be adapted to better fit
populations’ cultural and religious norms.
INTRODUCTION
The presence of mammary glands and the
female’s ability to lactate/breastfeed are key
features of all mammals, including humans.1 2
Yet breast feeding among modern humans is
strongly influenced by cultural values, beliefs
and customs, leading to variations in breast
feeding practices.3
Many studies reported benefits of breast
feeding (vs formula feeding) for the short-
term and long-term health of the offspring
and the mother.4 5 The WHO now recom-
mends exclusive breast feeding for 6 months
Key questions
What is already known about this topic?
▸ Despite the WHO’s recommendations promoting
breast feeding, wide variations in breast feeding
initiation rates are observed among Western
countries, with some reaching >95%, while
others remain <80%.
▸ Many individual-level determinants of breast
feeding are known, such as maternal age, edu-
cation and previous breast feeding experience.
▸ Less is known regarding cultural and societal
determinants, such as religion, which could
explain population-level differences between and
within countries.
What are the new findings?
▸ In Western countries, the proportion of Catholics
is negatively correlated with the rate of breast
feeding initiation.
▸ This negative correlation is also observed within
countries in France, Ireland, the UK and Canada,
and among non-Hispanic whites in the USA.
▸ Western countries with a higher proportion of
Protestants are closer to meeting the WHO’s
recommendations.
Recommendations for policy
▸ Our study suggests religion as a population-level
determinant
of
breast
feeding
initiation
in
Western countries; this knowledge could help
refine breast feeding promotion policies in coun-
tries and areas with larger Catholic populations.
▸ More research is needed to understand potential
underlying mechanisms relating breast feeding
practice to religious and cultural values and
customs.

 and continued partial breast feeding to 2 years.6 In most
countries, whether high income or low income, rates of
breast
feeding
initiation
exceed
90%,
although
its
recommended
exclusivity
and
duration
are
rarely
attained. In Western countries, where initiation rates
reached a low in the mid-20th century, considerable
public health efforts have been made to promote and
support
breast
feeding.
Countries
from
Northern
Europe have since increased initiation rates to as high as
95%.7 However, rates remain below 80% in several
European countries, especially in Southern Europe
(76%, 65% and 62%, respectively, in Spain, France and
Malta).7 This apparent north–south gradient in breast
feeding initiation rates has a few notable counterexam-
ples, including Ireland (46%), Northern Ireland (64%)
and Poland (71%).7 In Canada and in the USA, breast
feeding initiation rates were 87% and 75%, respectively,
in 2010.8 9 Canada has a strong west–east gradient, with
Quebec and the Atlantic provinces reporting the lowest
rates. The USA has a prominent northwest–southeast
gradient, with some south-eastern states reporting breast
feeding initiation rates below 30%; this state variation
remains even after accounting for key determinants such
as ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES).10
A number of determinants of breast feeding practices
have been identified and categorised into five groups:11
(1)
demographic
(age,
ethnicity,
education,
SES,
employment), (2) psychosocial (maternal confidence,
health belief, relative support), (3) healthcare factors
and biomedical constraints (promotion, training, indi-
vidual health), (4) community attributes (social net-
works and norms/standards, peer support groups) and
(5) public policy (eg, laws on maternity benefits). When
asked, mothers who choose not to breastfeed mention
individual-level determinants (lack of confidence, pain
and difficulties, lack of milk, return to work, embarrass-
ment to publicly breastfeed).12–15 This makes it difficult
to identify underlying determinants at the population
level that are likely to explain between-country varia-
tions. Yet, as outlined by Bourdieu,16 individual norms
and habits may be driven by sociocultural norms—‘the
habitus’—which can underlie individual choices.
From a socioanthropological standpoint, individual-
level and population-level determinants share systems of
customs, beliefs and values, including religious culture.
Religious culture may influence individual health prac-
tices, as highlighted by Durkheim and Weber in their
seminal work on suicide rates and self-esteem in Catholics
and Protestants.17 18 Based on their theoretical frame-
work, more recent studies have identified associations
between sociocultural traits and individual health percep-
tions and practices.19–21 Women’s choice to breastfeed
(or not) are therefore likely to be influenced by religious
culture or adherence to traditional or modern values. We
hypothesised that Catholicism and Protestantism may
influence breast feeding practice across and within coun-
tries, particularly in Western countries where these two
religious cultures are historically grounded.
By collating publicly available online data, we carried
out an ecological study to assess the association between
the proportions of Catholics and Protestants and rates of
breast
feeding
initiation.
Since
such
an
approach
requires sufficient statistical variability for both the inde-
pendent
and
dependent
variables,
we
focused
on
Western
countries.
We
also
studied
within-country
regional variations in five Western countries for which
we found data: France, Ireland, the UK, Canada and the
USA.
METHODS
Country data
Country-level
proportions
of
Roman
Catholics
and
Protestants were gathered from the Pew Research Centre
database22 and, when missing there, from the Central
Intelligence
Agency’s
World
Factbook
2013–2014.23
Breast feeding initiation rates were obtained from the
online databases of the WHO24 and, for its members,
from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development.25 The gross domestic product (GDP) per
capita
was
obtained
from
the
Central
Intelligence
Agency’s World Factbook 2013–2014,23 and the 2014
Human Development Index (HDI) from the 2015
Human Development Report of the United Nations
Development Programme.26
French department data
The proportions of Roman Catholics, Protestants and
‘no religion’ in French Departments were obtained from
data collected between 2003 and 2006 by the polling
company ‘Institut français d’opinion publique’ (Ifop,
French Institute of Public Opinion).27 This survey was
based on a cumulative, representative sample of 91 559
interviews; data were available for 94 of the 101 French
administrative Departments. Breast feeding initiation
rates by Department were obtained from the ‘Child
Health Certificate on the 8th Day’, a national survey
whose data are available on the website of the ‘Direction
de la recherche, des études, de l’évaluation et des statis-
tiques’ (Dress, French Direction of Research, Studies,
Evaluation and Statistics).28 Yearly data over the period
2006–2013 were collated and averaged to smooth varia-
tions and overcome sporadic missing data for a few
Departments. GDP (in 2005) and population density (in
2006) by Department were obtained from the ‘Institut
national de la statistique et des études économiques’
(Insee, National Institute of Statistics and Economic
Studies).
Irish county data
Religion
proportions
(Roman
Catholics,
Anglicans
(Church of Ireland) and ‘no religion’), population
density and GDP in Irish counties were collated from
the Irish Census 2011 available on the Central Statistics
Office website.29 Breast feeding initiation rates were
from the Perinatal Statistics Report 2011.30

 UK country data
Religion proportions (Roman Catholics, Anglicans and
‘no religion’) in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland were obtained from their respective 2001 cen-
suses.31–33 Data on breast feeding were obtained from
the United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund UK
website.34 Regional gross value added in 2014 was
obtained from data published by the Office for National
Statistics and population density was derived from the
2011 Census.
Canadian province data
Religion proportions (Roman Catholics, Protestants and
‘no religion’) and breast feeding data were collated on
the Statistics Canada website, from the 2011 National
Household
Survey
(religion)
and
the
2009–2010
Canadian Community Health Survey (breast feeding).13 35
GDP per capita in 2014 and population density in 2011
were also obtained from the Statistics Canada website.
US state data
Proportions of Roman Catholics, Evangelical Protestants,
Mainline Protestants and ‘no religion’ in US states were
obtained from the 2014 survey of the ‘Public Religion
Research Institute’, available on the ‘American Values
Atlas project’ website.36 That survey also includes ethnic-
specific religion data (ie, white Evangelical Protestants,
black
Protestants,
non-Hispanic
white
Catholics).
State-level data on ethnicity proportion (state percentage
of non-Hispanic whites, Hispanic whites and Blacks),
educational attainment (% of population with a high
school degree or less) and household income (% of
population with <$30 000/year) were also gathered on
this website. State-level data on breast feeding were from
the ‘2010 National Immunization Survey’ conducted by
the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention.9
Ethnic-specific breast feeding initiation rates by state
were
also
available
for
non-Hispanic
whites
(n=50
states), Hispanic whites (n=44) and blacks (n=26).
Statistical analyses
Frequency distributions for religion and breast feeding
initiation were visually inspected. Spearman’s unadjusted
and partial correlations were used to assess the relation-
ship between country-level proportions of Catholics and
Protestants and of breast feeding initiation. This analysis
was stratified by world subregion and adjusted for GDP
per capita and for HDI (separately, since GDP per capita
is accounted for in the HDI). The Western subregion
was defined as European countries plus Cyprus, Canada,
the USA, Australia and New Zealand.
Spearman (rank) correlation coefficients were used to
compare religion proportions with breast feeding initi-
ation rates using within-country data, namely French
Departments, Irish counties, UK countries, Canadian
provinces and US states. For UK data, we used the more
statistically
powerful
Pearson
correlation
coefficient
because of the small number of countries. Correlations
were adjusted for GDP per capita (to account for within-
country economic wealth differences) and population
density (to account for urbanisation, since populations
living in rural areas are usually older, less educated and
more traditional in religious practice). We also plotted
the
proportion
of
Catholics
(x-axis)
against
breast
feeding initiation rates (y-axis). For US states, the ana-
lysis was performed both overall and by ethnicity and
adjusted for state-level rates of low education and low
SES (both factors being strongly related to both religion
and breast feeding initiation).
Analyses
were
performed
using
SAS
V.9.4
(SAS
Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA).
RESULTS
The average proportions of Catholics and Protestants in
Western
(n=37),
Sub-Saharan
African
(n=37)
and
Central and Southern American (n=18) countries varied
between 19% and 68% (table 1). Although the Central
and South American subregion had the highest Catholic
proportion (68±14%), and the Sub-Saharan African sub-
region the highest Protestant proportion (32±26%), the
Western subregion had the widest variability for both
Christian religions. The Western subregion also had the
lowest breast feeding initiation rate and the largest vari-
ability (87±12%); rates in the other subregions were
around 95%.
In Western countries, the breast feeding initiation rate
was
negatively
correlated
with
the
proportion
of
Catholics (r=−0.30) and positively correlated with the
proportion of Protestants (r=0.31) (table 2). These
correlations were unchanged (r=−0.30) or enhanced
(r=−0.40) after controlling for GDP per capita and for
HDI, respectively.
The scatter plot of the negative relationship between
Catholic proportion and breast feeding initiation rate in
Western countries is shown in figure 1. This correlation
was not observed in non-Western countries; however, the

 breast feeding initiation rate in the most Christian
country in Asia, the Philippines (81% Catholic), was
lower than in the other Asian countries (87.7% vs 95.4%
on average). To a lesser extent, this was also observed
for Lebanon versus other North African and Middle
Eastern countries (29% vs 3% Catholics, on average):
89% versus 94% breast feeding initiation.
Based on within-country data, negative correlations
were observed between the proportion of Catholics and
the breast feeding initiation rate in French Departments
(n=94;
r=−0.31),
Irish
counties
(n=26;
r=−0.41),
Canadian provinces (n=13; r=−0.75) and UK countries
(n=4; r=−0.78) (figure 2). These correlations remained
strongly negative after controlling for GDP per capita
and population density (table 3). The direction and the
strength of the (adjusted) correlations between breast
feeding initiation rates and proportions of Protestants
were not consistent across the four countries. The pro-
portions of ‘no religion’ were positively correlated with
breast feeding initiation rates in Ireland (r=0.38), the
UK (r=0.93) and Canada (r=0.74), but weak and nega-
tive in France (r=−0.07).
In the US, state-level rates of breast feeding initiation
were
positively
correlated
(r=0.26)
with
state-level
proportions
of
Catholics
and
negatively
correlated
(r=−0.65) with state-level proportions of Protestants
(table 4). After accounting for state-level rates of low
education and low SES, the correlation with the propor-
tion of Catholics was highly attenuated (r=0.06), while
the correlation with the proportion of Protestants almost
halved (r=−0.37). The breast feeding initiation rate
among non-Hispanic white Americans was negatively
correlated with the proportion of white Catholics (r=
−0.29), while only weak correlations were observed with
the proportions of white Evangelical (r=−0.13) and
white Mainline (r=−0.07) Protestants. The negative cor-
relation between the proportion of Protestants and
breast feeding initiation rate among all ethnicities was
driven by the relationship between the state-level propor-
tion of black Protestants and state-level rates of breast
feeding initiation among blacks (r=−0.47). This correl-
ation was attenuated, however, after controlling for low
education and SES (r=−0.23). Finally, the state-level pro-
portion of ‘no religion’ was positively related to its breast
feeding initiation rate, even after controlling for low
education and SES (r=0.43).
DISCUSSION
Using an ecological study design, we observed a strong
negative correlation between the proportion of Catholics
and the rate of breast feeding initiation in Western coun-
tries. Countries in which the breast feeding initiation
rate was below 80% are historically Catholic (eg, France,
Poland and Ireland). This negative correlation was con-
sistent
when
using
within-country
data
in
France,
Ireland, the UK and Canada. In the USA, the positive
correlation between a state’s proportion of Catholics and
its breast feeding initiation rate was confounded by eth-
nicity, low education and low SES: after controlling, the
state proportion of non-Hispanic white Catholics was
negatively correlated with its rate of breast feeding
initiation.
To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first eco-
logical study to assess the association between the pro-
portions of Catholics and Protestants and breast feeding
initiation rates. Previously, one American multicentre
study of 4166 families living in urban areas found that
Conservative Protestants were more likely to breastfeed
(OR=1.60, 95% CI not given) than participants who
declared no religious affiliation, after controlling for
sociodemographic
variables,
including
ethnicity
and
education.37 Catholics were non-significantly less likely
to breastfeed compared to participants without religion
(OR=0.80, 95% CI not given). Our ecological design has
several strengths, including cost and convenience of
using publicly accessible secondary data covering 135
countries in five world subregions, which would be
infeasible using individual-level data. Moreover, in some
countries, individual data on religion, when available,
are highly sensitive and their collection is often forbid-
den by authorities. Finally, the ecological design is
appropriate for inferring relationships at the population

policies and sociocultural differences.
The parallel limitation of our study is the so-called
ecological fallacy, whereby associations observed at the
population level may not reflect relationships at the indi-
vidual level. To at least partly overcome this limitation,
we explored the association using within-country data in
France, Ireland, the UK, Canada and the USA; the
results of those analyses confirmed our findings. Our
analysis for the USA would have been even more inform-
ative if breast feeding data had been aggregated at the
county level, as we were able to find for religion data.
Finally,
testing
our
hypothesis
in
Germany
with
Länder-level data would have been an additional asset to
our study. Indeed, the Protestant religion originated in
Saxony in the 16th century, before spreading to neigh-
bouring
areas
with
a
previous
Catholic
tradition.
Unfortunately, we were unable to find data on religion
and breast feeding at the Länder level.
Another study limitation is the lack of time-series data.
Indeed, our data were cross-sectional snapshots taken in
a recent period, while breast feeding initiation rates in
Western countries have been increasing for several
decades.
Correlating
longitudinal
data
would
have
strengthened our ability to infer causality for the associa-
tions we observed. Nonetheless, we argue that religion
proportions and religious culture change too slowly to
have
significant
short-term
consequences
on
breast
feeding practice. In fact, adherence or practice of reli-
gion, as declared by individuals, are proxies for values
and beliefs reflected by religion. Individuals who declare
not adhering to any religion, or adhering to one religion
without practising it, tend to maintain (perhaps uncon-
sciously) the beliefs and values embedded through gen-
erations by their familial and national religious culture.38
Hence, it is unlikely that using religion data from the
mid-20th century would have changed our results. On
the other hand, using breast feeding data from the 1970s
or 1980s could have impacted our results; we found no
detailed data to compare that temporal change between
or within countries. A final limitation of our study is our
inability to account for small religious minorities and for
potential individual-level confounders such as maternal
age, marital status and employment.

 Our main finding is the negative correlation between
the proportion of Catholics and the breast feeding initi-
ation
rate
among
and
within
Western
countries.
Conversely, Protestantism was positively correlated with
breast feeding initiation rates in country-level analysis,
although
that
correlation
was
less
consistent
using
within-country data. It is unclear whether these opposite
relationships are the consequence of ‘communicating
vessels’ or whether each of these two religious affiliations
has an independent effect. Christian countries with
higher proportions of Catholics tend to have lower
breast feeding initiation rates, whereas rates in predom-
inantly Protestant and non-Christian countries are closer
to one another. However, results in African and Central
and Southern American countries, although mostly
Christian, were not in line with those from Western
countries.
Our explanation for these findings draws on both
history and theology. First, populations in low-income
countries never experienced a widespread shift from
breast feeding to formula feeding, in contrast to Western
populations at the end of the 19th century.3 39 Hence,
breast feeding remained the norm in low-income coun-
tries, because no affordable alternatives were available
for most of the population, even in areas under Western
colonial influence. Despite the colonial Christian influ-
ence, native populations also probably remained under
the broad influence of their traditional beliefs and
customs, especially animistic conceptions of the body
that value the fertility and the nurturing status of
women as symbols of strength, vitality and prosperity.40
In Europe, it has been reported that Catholic mothers
were less likely to breastfeed than Protestant mothers
during the 16th and 17th centuries.3 In France, wet
nurses were commonly hired to feed infants, especially
in
Catholic
families
from
the
middle
and
upper
classes.41 Non-breastfeeding mothers reported concerns
about health, pain and body self-image to explain their
choice, while sex and lactation were judged incompat-
ible by the Catholic Church, with predictable conse-
quences
on
breast
feeding
practice
in
Catholic
households.42
From the 19th century, the technological and indus-
trial revolution provided new infant feeding alternatives,

 although they first led to high mortality rates due to
poor hygienic conditions. At the end of the 19th
century,
sterile
infant
formula
and
running
water
became increasingly available and affordable for rural
and lower-class urban populations.3 Until the 1960s,
infant formula was considered as safe as breast milk and
a symbol of progress, improving women’s conditions
and, as a consequence, reducing breast feeding rates to
their lowest level in human history. Despite improve-
ments in the nutritional composition of infant formulas,
scientific studies began to report health benefits of
breast feeding43 and breast feeding support movements
emerged in the 1970s.3 Prior to this recent promotion
phase,
it
remains
unclear
whether
Catholics
and
Protestants started from the same low baseline. In the
1970s, breast feeding initiation rates were 36% in
France, 11–24% in Ireland, 26% in Canada, 24% in the
USA and around 35% in Sweden.12
44–47 Protestant
countries then experienced a faster increase, as illu-
strated by the current statistics.7 One plausible interpret-
ation is that Protestants, through individual behaviours
or public policies, may be more inclined to adopt scien-
tific recommendations and quicker to implement new
health promotion policies. As explained by Weber,17 the
Protestant ethic promotes pragmatism and utilitarianism
as ways to achieve modern progress and salvation. In
contrast, the Catholic ethic tends to be more sceptical
towards novelty and therefore may be less adaptable and
dynamic when faced with new scientific recommenda-
tions.40 These two distinct conceptions of modern pro-
gress could influence modern society by promoting
different values, which are then translated into different
lifestyles and behaviours.48 This could be mediated,
among others factors, by the societal acceptance of
breast feeding in public, which has been shown to be
associated with breast feeding practice in four European
countries.49
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, our ecological analysis suggests a new
population-level factor influencing breast feeding initi-
ation across and within Western countries: the propor-
tion
of
Catholics.
This
observation
may
help
policymakers and healthcare professionals target at-risk
populations and reinforce or adapt their breast feeding
promotional efforts according to sociocultural back-
ground. Individual-level studies are needed to confirm
or refute our findings. Qualitative studies are also neces-
sary to identify the sociocultural values and beliefs that
mediate the relationships between a historically Catholic
family
or
societal
background
and
breast
feeding
