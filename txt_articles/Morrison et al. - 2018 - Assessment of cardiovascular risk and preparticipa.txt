AbsTrACT
background Underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) 
is the primary cause of sudden cardiac death in masters 
athletes (>35 years). Preparticipation screening may detect 
cardiovascular disease; however, the optimal screening 
method is undefined in this population. The Physical 
Activity Readiness Questionnaire for Everyone (PAR-Q+) 
and the American Heart Association (AHA) Preparticipation 
Screening Questionnaire are often currently used; however, a 
more comprehensive risk assessment may be required. We 
sought to ascertain the cardiovascular risk and to assess the 
effectiveness of screening tools in masters athletes.
Methods  This cross-sectional study performed 
preparticipation screening on masters athletes, which 
included an ECG, the AHA 14-element recommendations 
and Framingham Risk Score (FRS). If the preparticipation 
screening was abnormal, further evaluations were performed. 
The effectiveness of the screening tools was determined by 
their positive predictive value (PPV).
results  798 athletes were included in the preparticipation 
screening analysis (62.7% male, 54.6±9.5 years, range 
35–81). The  metabolic equivalent task hours per week was 
80.8±44.0, and the average physical activity experience was 
35.1±14.8 years. Sixty-four per cent underwent additional 
evaluations. Cardiovascular disease was detected in 11.4%, 
with CAD (7.9%) being the most common diagnosis. High 
FRS (>20%) was seen in 8.5% of the study population. Ten 
athletes were diagnosed with significant CAD; 90% were 
asymptomatic. A high FRS was most indicative of underlying 
CAD (PPV 38.2%).
Conclusion Masters athletes are not immune to 
elevated cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular disease. 
Comprehensive preparticipation screening including an ECG 
and FRS can detect cardiovascular disease. An exercise 
stress test should be considered in those with risk factors, 
regardless of fitness level.
InTroduCTIon
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the 
primary cause of sudden cardiac death 
(SCD) in athletes over 35 years old, 1–3 
with symptoms preceding the event in only 
12%–36% of cases.1 4 Although regular 
physical activity reduces cardiovascular and 
all-cause mortality,5 6 athletes may possess 
cardiovascular risk factors7–10 or underlying 
cardiovascular disease (CVD),7 9–11 putting 
them at heightened risk for SCD during 
periods of vigorous-intensity activity.12 The 
risk of SCD transiently increases during vigor-
ous-intensity activity compared with mild or 
no physical activity, with the greatest risk in 
inactive men (74.1 relative risk) compared 
with those who exercise frequently (10.9 rela-
tive risk).13 Masters athletes (≥35 years old) 
are a growing population that require dedi-
cated attention to identify at-risk individuals 
in order to ensure their safe participation 
in competitive sports, which often demand 
sustained vigorous to maximal intensity effort.
What are the new findings?
 
► This is the first study to systematically analyse the 
effectiveness of European cardiovascular prepartici-
pation screening recommendations.
 
► We identified which screening tools had the high-
est likelihood of predicting coronary artery dis-
ease (CAD), where a high  Framingham Risk 
Score (FRS), significant q-waves, exertional dys-
pnoea and a family history of premature CAD exhib-
ited the highest positive predictive value (PPV).
 
► Preparticipation screening in masters athletes de-
tected 11.4% to have clinically significant cardio-
vascular disease (CVD) and 8.5% to have a high 
cardiovascular risk profile.
 
► The physical examination generated high false-pos-
itives and a low PPV for detecting valvular disease.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
 
► Masters athletes are not immune to elevated cardiac risk and 
should be evaluated for cardiovascular risk factors (including lipid 
profile), family history of CAD and concerning symptoms, and un-
dergo a resting ECG.
 
► Masters athletes, regardless of fitness level, with a family history 
of premature CAD, abnormal ECG and cardiovascular risk factors 
may benefit from undergoing a maximal  exercise stress test (EST).
 
► Masters athletes with a high FRS, and abnormal EST, ECG or phys-
ical exam (ie, diastolic murmur or systolic click), should undergo 
clinically indicated examinations to confirm or exclude CVD, as rec-
ommended by a sports cardiologist.
 
► In considering preparticipation screening of masters athletes, ef-
forts to decrease false-positives include refining the criteria for fol-
low-up and/or eliminating the physical examination, development of 
a masters athlete-specific ECG interpretation criteria, refinement of 
the questionnaire, and consideration of other screening modalities.
Preparticipation screening strategies have been 
proposed to mitigate the risk of sports-related SCD but 
have not been extensively evaluated in masters athletes. 
Self-administered surveys such as the Physical Activity 
Readiness Questionnaire for Everyone (PAR-Q+) and 
the American Heart Association (AHA)/American 
College of Sports Medicine Preparticipation Screening 
Questionnaire are often used, but not mandated.14 
Many organisations such as the European Association of 
Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation (EACPR), 
the AHA and the IOC have suggested more comprehen-
sive risk assessments for athletes who routinely engage 
in vigorous-intensity exercise.15–17 The percentage of 
masters athletes that undergo preparticipation screening 
is modest (24.6%–51.5%).18 Healthcare providers tend to 
refer athletes for preparticipation screening if they are 
older, or participating in long distance events, rather than 
considering their traditional cardiovascular risk factors 
(ie, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia, 
smoking history and family history).18 The Framingham 
Risk Score (FRS) is the risk calculator commonly used 
in Canada to evaluate one’s 10-year risk of having a 
cardiovascular event based on risk factors (age, sex, total 
cholesterol,  high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-choles-
terol, diabetes, smoking history, systolic blood pressure, 
whether or not medication is taken for blood pressure, 
and family history of CVD) and is not currently used in 
preparticipation screening of masters athletes.
Two studies have prospectively used preparticipa-
tion screening to detect CVD risk in masters athletes. 
Both studies used the EACPR recommendations16 and 
reported that the 12-lead ECG had the highest detection 
rate for CVD.7 10 There is no Canadian data examining 
cardiovascular risk and preparticipation screening in 
masters athletes. Moreover, there is considerable debate 
regarding the best approach. The purpose of this study 
was to evaluate the cardiovascular risk in masters athletes 
following 
current 
comprehensive 
preparticipation 
screening guidelines, and to assess the effectiveness of 
screening tools for detecting CVD in masters athletes. We 
hypothesised that 5% of masters athletes would fulfil the 
criteria for a diagnosis of CVD.
MeTHodology
study design
This cross-sectional screening study included participants 
throughout British Columbia, Canada (April 2015–
January 2016). Study participants were self-referred and 
recruited through television, radio, social media (Face-
book, Twitter), sporting teams, clubs and organisations. 
Male and female recreational and competitive athletes 
aged ≥35 years old from a variety of sports were included.
All participants engaged in moderate to vigorous inten-
sity physical activity, at least 3 days per week over the 
preceding 3 months. Individuals with previously known 
CAD, peripheral vascular disease, thoracic aortic aneu-
rysm, inherited arrhythmias, congenital heart disease, 
valvular disease (moderate or greater stenosis or regurgi-
tation), and those with missing documentation or those 
lost to follow-up were excluded from the analysis.
Athlete examination
All participants were screened following the EACPR algo-
rithm.16 The study had three stages: (1) initial screening 
test; (2) exercise stress test (EST); and (3) evaluation by 
a cardiologist and further examinations (figure 1). The 
results of the previous stages decided whether a partic-
ipant proceeds to the next stage. The first two stages 
were the screening methods where performances of 
the participants were to be assessed, and the third stage 
was the reference standard. All participants underwent 
stage 1, which included the initial preparticipation 
screen (ie, anthropometrics, resting blood pressure and 
heart rate, modified version of the AHA 14-element 
recommendations (medical and family history, physical 
examination),19 resting ECG, FRS (including fasting 
lipid and glucose profile), and a lifestyle, physical activity 
and psychosocial questionnaire). Background informa-
tion (age, sex, ethnicity, educational level, marital status, 
income range and occupation) was collected. All ECGs 
(Mortara Instrument, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) were inter-
preted by cardiologists with expertise in athlete ECG 
interpretation using the ‘Seattle Criteria’ (SI, BH).20 The 
physical examination was performed by cardiologists, 
cardiology fellows and internal medicine residents.
Participants with abnormal history, physical exam-
ination and ECG, intermediate FRS (10%–19%), high 
FRS (>20%), markedly raised cardiovascular risk factor 
(fasting blood sugar ≥7.0 mmol/L, >8 mmol/L total 
cholesterol), history of diabetes, >65 years, and/or 
other previously concerning conditions were considered 
abnormal (positive) and underwent an EST (stage 2) 
(online supplementary material table 1). The interme-
diate FRS was included due to the recommendations of 
the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for the 
Diagnosis and Treatment of Dyslipidemia for the Preven-
tion of Cardiovascular Disease in the Adult,21 and the age

criteria (≥65 years) was included as suggested by the AHA 
guidelines.17 
Participants were evaluated by a cardiologist (stage 3) if 
their EST was abnormal or if their initial evaluation iden-
tified a positive family history (inheritable heart disease 
and/or unexplained SCD in a first-degree or second-de-
gree relative <50 years), syncope, high FRS, abnormal 
ECG, abnormal physical examination and/or other 
previously concerning conditions (online supplementary 
material figure 1 ). The cardiologists (who have expertise 
in athlete evaluation) determined if subsequent exam-
inations were necessary based on their clinical discretion. 
The final decision to undergo further examination (coro-
nary artery calcium score, coronary CT angiography, 
cardiac catheterisation, echocardiogram, myocardial 
perfusion imaging (MIBI), cardiac myocardial resonance 
imaging, Holter monitoring, 24-hour ambulatory blood 
pressure monitor) was made collectively by the cardiolo-
gist and the patient (once the patient was fully informed 
of the risks and benefits of the test).
Physical activity exposure
The volume of physical activity was reported as meta-
bolic equivalent task hours per week (MET-hour/week). 
The type and intensity of the activities were matched to 
the corresponding METs using the Ainsworth compen-
dium of physical activities.22 Lifetime hours were based 
on a self-report of total years spent being physically active 
and were calculated as follows: average total hours of 
endurance, mixed and strength per week × 52 × training 
years (adapted from Brugger et al23) (online supplemen-
tary material table 2).
outcome measures
Clinically significant CVD (ie, CAD, bicuspid aortic 
valve, mitral valve prolapse, high premature ventric-
ular contraction (PVC) burden,24 aortic dilation,25 
atrial fibrillation (AF), other concerning arrhythmias 
(ie, second-degree type II atrioventricular (AV) block), 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right 
ventricular cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, 
coronary artery anomalies, inherited arrhythmias and 
myocarditis) was the primary outcome. Our secondary 
outcome was the positive predictive value (PPV) for 
each screening tool according to the type of CVD (CAD, 
valvular disease).
statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as mean and 
SD. Frequency tables were generated for all categor-
ical data and reported as number of participants (n) 
and percentage (%). The PPV was calculated using the 
following formula: 
 
PPV =
true test positives
(true test positives + false positives)

We compared the screening methods using a weighted 
generalised score statistic. Bonferroni correction was 
applied for multiple comparisons. Statistical analysis was 
performed using SPSS V.23.0 software or Excel V.15.33 
(Microsoft, Redmond, Washington). Those with missing 
data were not included in the sample size for the associ-
ated variable and the mean and percentage were adjusted 
accordingly.
resulTs
study population
A total of 885 masters athletes were screened. Ten 
per cent (n=87) were excluded from the analysis 
(previous CVD n=43; did not meet physical activity 
requirements n=7; missing documentation n=11; lost 
to follow-up n=26). Participants were predominately 
male (62.7%) and Caucasian (87.7%), with a mean age 
of 54.6±9.5 years (range 35–81) (table 1). Participants 
took part in 23 sports and were representative of sports 
commonly played by masters athletes living in British 
Columbia (online supplementary material figure 2). The 
most common primary sports (most athletes participated 
in more than one sport) were running (34.2%), cycling 
(19.1%), hockey (10.9%), triathlon (9.5%) and rowing 
(4.3%). Four hundred and seventy-seven (59.8%) partici-
pants had completed a minimum of half or full marathon 
(18.2±23.8, range 1–176). Participants spent 35.1±14.8 
years of their lives being active. Weekly time spent in 
moderate to vigorous physical activity was 7.6±4.3 hours 
and weekly training volume was 80.8±44.0 MET-hour/
week.
Cardiovascular risk
A small percentage were already on antihypertensive 
and lipid-lowering medication (7.7% and 2.3%, respec-
tively), 1.0% had known diabetes, 1.0% were current 
smokers and 24.9% were former smokers (quit ≥2 years 
ago) (table 1). At screening, 222 (27.8%) had dyslipi-
daemia (low-density lipoprotein ≥3.5 or total cholesterol 
to HDL-cholesterol ratio ≥5.0 or self-reported use of a 
lipid-modifying medication), 54 (6.7%) had HDL <1.0 
mmol/L, 182 (22.8%) were hypertensive (≥140 mm Hg 
systolic or ≥90 mm Hg diastolic or self-reported use of 
antihypertensive medication) and 105 (13.1%) had 
hyperglycaemia (fasting glucose >5.5 mmol/L). A total 
of 365 (45.7%) participants did not meet the recom-
mended daily servings of fruits and vegetables and 154 
(19.2%) were heavy drinkers (≥5 drinks on one occasion, 
at least once a month). Eleven per cent (n=88) reported 
a depressive mood and 27 (3.7%) met the criteria for 
depression.
Indications for follow-up and PPV for screening tests
The initial screen was abnormal in 513 participants 
(64.3%), subsequently leading to an EST (figure 1). A 
total of 350 (43.9%) participants met the criteria for a 
cardiologist evaluation, and 256 (32.1%) participants 
required further examinations which may have included

echocardiogram, stress echocardiogram, Holter moni-
toring, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, coronary 
artery calcium score, coronary CT angiography and/or 
MIBI. The primary indicators for follow-up were an inter-
mediate FRS (10%–19%) (n=196, 24.6%), >2/6 systolic 
murmur (n=92, 11.5%) and palpitations with exercise 
(n=86, 10.8%) (table 2). The most common abnormality 
that warranted further investigation on resting ECG 
was left axis deviation (n=36, 4.5%), but had a very low 
PPV (11.1%). Two hundred and ninety-seven (37.3%) 
participants had more than one indicator that warranted 
further investigations.
A high FRS (≥20%) was the single most statisti-
cally effective tool in predicting CAD (PPV=38.2%; 
p<0.00001) (table 2). Thirty-two (47.1%) individuals with 
a high FRS underwent coronary CT angiography, coro-
nary artery calcium score, MIBI and/or catheterisation, 
and 26 (81.2%) were diagnosed with CAD thereafter 
(figure 2). An additional seven individuals underwent 
further testing (echocardiogram, Holter monitoring) 
and three were diagnosed with other types of CVD (AF, 
bicuspid aortic valve, second-degree type II AV block). 
Twenty-nine (42.6%) did not undergo further testing, 
but 8 (27.6%) initiated medications, 8 (24.1%) were 
already on appropriate medications and 13 (44.8%) did 
not initiate medication (cardiologist’s discretion or the 
participant declined).
In the detection of CAD, significant q-waves on resting 
ECG exhibited a 33.3% PPV, exertional dyspnoea had 
a PPV of 23.1% and a family history of premature CAD 
had a PPV of 15.4% (table 2). The ECG was abnormal 
in 4 (66.7%) of 6 participants diagnosed with AF (the 
remaining two cases of AF were detected at the time of 
their EST). The physical examination had a very low 
PPV (7.4%) for detecting valvular disease. A 2/6 systolic 
murmur exhibited a PPV of 4.3%, while a systolic click 
demonstrated a higher PPV of 18.2%. The physical 
examination did not detect 5 (45.5%) of 11 of those 
with mitral valve prolapse. All individuals diagnosed with 
bicuspid aortic valve had an abnormal physical examina-
tion.
CVd diagnosis: clinical characteristics
A total of 91 (11.4%) were diagnosed with clinically 
significant CVD, with 19 athletes (2.4%) having multiple 
diagnoses (table 3). Those individuals diagnosed with 
CVD were predominately male (88%), with a mean 
age of 60±8 years (range 38–76). The most common 
diagnosis was CAD (n=63; 7.9%). Twenty-nine (3.6%) 
participants had non-obstructive CAD and 34 (4.3%) 
had obstructive CAD. Symptoms were reported in only 
27.0% of the participants diagnosed with CAD. Notably, 
the presence of angina to predict underlying disease 
was variable. None of the participants with obstructive 
CAD reported angina. Paradoxically, four participants 
with non-obstructive disease reported angina. Three 
(50%) athletes diagnosed with AF reported symptoms. 
Two individuals were identified with coronary artery 
anomalies; one was incidentally flagged by ECG and 
the other by a high FRS who subsequently had a coro-
nary CT angiography with an incidental coronary artery 
anomaly and moderate CAD. Two athletes displayed 
T-wave inversions suggestive of hypertrophic cardiomy-
opathy on ECG, but declined subsequent evaluations. 
Two-thirds (40/63) of the participants diagnosed with 
CAD had a positive EST.

dIsCussIon
This is the first study to ascertain the cardiovascular risk in 
masters athletes in Canada. CVD and high cardiovascular 
risk profiles (FRS ≥20%) were found in 11.4% and 8.5% 
of athletes, respectively. Most participants (73.0%) diag-
nosed with CAD were asymptomatic and were unaware 
of their elevated cardiovascular risk. Compared with the 
Canadian general population, participants had a lower 
prevalence of risk factors (figure 3).
The prevalence of CVD was higher in our study compared 
with previous prospective studies. Menafoglio et al10 studied 
785 highly active individuals (>6 hours of physical activity 
per week) using the EACPR protocol and detected 22 
individuals (2.8%) with significant CVD. One (0.1%) indi-
vidual had CAD compared with 63 (7.9%) present in this 
study and 9 (1.1%) had valvular disease, similar to this study 
(n=15, 1.9%). Using the EACPR guidelines and an echocar-
diogram, Aagaard et al7 reported significant CVD (ie, long 
QT syndrome, AF, third-degree AV block) in 5.9% of partic-
ipants, and none had CAD or valvular disease. The greater 
prevalence of CVD in our population compared with 
Menafoglio et al and Aagaard et al’s studies may be attributed 
to (1) higher mean age (54.6±9. vs 46.8±7.3 vs 51.5±5 years, 
respectively); (2) long-term activity habits (35.1±14.8 years

Figure 3 Prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors compared with the Canadian population. Data from the Canadian Health 
Measures Survey (CHMS) and Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) from a nationally representative sample of 
Canadians compared with the current population, aged >35. Data for those aged >35 were not available for all risk factors. 
The age and source for each risk factor were reported as follows: dyslipidaemia: aged 18–79, source: CHMS, 2012–2014; 
hypertension: aged 20–79, source: CHMS, 2012–2014; smoking (self-reported): aged 12–49, source: CHMS, 2012 and 2013; 
diabetes (diagnosed by a health professional): aged 12 and over, source: CCHS, 2015; inactivity: aged 12 and older, source: 
CCHS, 2014; obesity (directly measured): aged 18–79, source: CHMS, 2010; depression (major depressive episode in the last 
12 months): aged 15 and older, source: CCHS, 2012; heavy drinking: aged 12 or older, source: CCHS, 2014. Dyslipidaemia was 
defined as having a low-density lipoprotein >3.5, or total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio >5.0, or self-
reported use of a lipid-modifying medication. Hypertension was defined as >140 mm Hg systolic or >90 mm Hg diastolic, or 
self-reported use of antihypertensive medication. Hyperglycaemia was defined as having a fasting glucose >5.5 mmol/L. Heavy 
drinker was defined as >5 drinks on one occasion, at least once a month. Obesity was defined as body mass index >30 (http://

vs 20.0±14.5 years, and novice runners, respectively); (3) 
more participants undergoing EST due to an intermediate 
FRS (24.6% vs 0% vs 0%, respectively); and/or (4) a greater 
number of secondary investigations. Over half of our popu-
lation (63.3%) underwent EST compared with the 14.3% 
and 9.0% reported by Menafoglio et al and Aagaard et al, 
respectively. Aagaard et al included a more comprehensive 
onsite assessment by physicians (echocardiogram in all 
participants), which likely resulted in fewer participants 
proceeding to subsequent testing (ie, EST).
Current screening tools (AHA 14-element recommen-
dations, ECG interpretation criteria) are not specific 
for use in masters athletes and may need to be modi-
fied.19 20 For example, the presence of a 2/6 systolic 
murmur had low clinical significance (4.3% PPV) and 
should not warrant further testing. The presence of a 
mid-systolic click was associated with a slightly better PPV 
(18.2%) for detecting valvular disease. The ECG demon-
strated a low PPV for detecting CAD (11.1%), although 
q-waves (33.3%) and PVCs (27.3%) increased the PPV 
for CAD. Left axis deviation elicited the greatest number 
of follow-ups (n=36), but had a low PPV (11.2%). As 
such, the presence of isolated left axis deviation may 
not warrant further testing. The ECG also has an ability 
to detect asymptomatic electrical disease (ie, AF, long 
QT syndrome and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome). 
In the current study, the ECG detected three (50.0%) 
individuals with AF. Positive responses to the symp-
toms and family history of unexplained SCD elicited 
the greatest number of follow-ups, yet had a low detec-
tion rate for CAD (PPV 11.6% and 6.3%, respectively). 
Increasing the sensitivity of the questionnaire (ie, differ-
entiating cardiogenic symptoms from non-cardiogenic, 
and reviewing in conjunction with the ECG and family 
history) or a more comprehensive review by an onsite 
physician with appropriate training would reduce the 
number of participants having to undergo subsequent 
testing, and thereby reduce false-positives.
In the present study, a positive EST detected CAD in 
63.5%. This is consistent with the findings by Sofi et al,26 
whereby the majority of participants diagnosed with CVD 
demonstrated an abnormality on the EST. While previous 
reports suggest that ECG changes are masked in individ-
uals at low risk of CAD (ie, active, physically fit population) 
and in those who can achieve >10 METs,27 28 our study did 
not show this (table 3). However, 81.0% of those diag-
nosed with CAD had an intermediate or high FRS, which is 
known to increase the likelihood of a positive EST in men.29 
Although the FRS is widely used and is a good predictor 
of one’s 10-year CVD risk, it may underestimate cardio-
vascular risk in masters athletes.11 30 31 Masters athletes 
have been shown to have a higher prevalence of coronary 
plaques (44.3% vs 22.2%) when compared with sedentary 
men who were similar in age, sex and low FRS.11 However, a

distinction between the detection of CAD is different from 
myocardial infarction and death.
Using coronary CT angiography improves detection rates 
as shown by Braber et al,30 who identified CAD in 60 of 318 
(18.9%, 95% CI 14.9% to 23.5%) asymptomatic partic-
ipants, of whom 300 had a low cardiovascular risk and a 
normal sports medical examination. Although the implica-
tions of increased coronary plaques in masters athletes are 
unknown, research suggests that individuals with elevated 
cholesterol levels benefit from statin therapy, even in the 
setting of high fitness. Kokkinos et al32 reported a greater 
10-year survival rate when high fitness was combined with 
statin therapy (fully adjusted HR 0.30; 0.21-0.41) versus no 
statin therapy (HR 0.53; 0.44–0.65) when compared with 
less fit individuals taking statins.
limitations
A true prevalence of CVD cannot be reported because 
gold-standard cardiovascular examinations (ie, coronary 
artery calcium score, coronary CT angiography, echocar-
diogram) were not performed on all athletes. However, 
most athletes had an EST, which increased the likeli-
hood of detecting those at risk by triggering subsequent 
examinations. In this study, the reference standard was 
the evaluation by cardiologists, who determined which 
cardiac evaluations were clinically indicated. Although 
gold-standard imaging tests that have sensitivities 
approaching 100% would be ideal to ascertain the preva-
lence of CVD, we did not perform these examinations on 
all participants because of the following reasons: (1) the 
current evidence for incorporating cardiac imaging into 
preparticipation screening is insufficient10; (2) cost; (3) 
time commitment; (4) potential radiation exposure; (5) 
testing a population of generally healthy asymptomatic 
low-risk patients is not clinically indicated; and (6) the 
potential psychological and insurance risks.
Additionally, since the reference standard was only avail-
able for those participants who went through all stages, 
the sample PPV for each individual screening method 
computed based on this set of biased samples might not 
estimate the population PPV, but rather the PPV of those 
that screened positive. However, we were able to assess the 
value of the screening test when it was reported positive, 
which may be of benefit in screening studies.
The reported cardiovascular risk may be overestimated 
due to selection bias. Participants with symptoms, previ-
ously known risk factors and/or known family history of 
CVD may have been more inclined to enrol in the study. 
Conversely, athletes who had a low FRS did not undergo 
further evaluations but may in fact have CVD as the FRS 
underestimates risk in masters athletes.
Our population was predominately Caucasian, limiting 
the generalisability of our results to other populations. 
Inclusion of a control group in a large, multisport, 
multiethnic, longitudinal study will be instrumental in 
determining whether preparticipation screening among 
masters athletes reduces morbidity, mortality and health-
care costs.
ConClusIon
Despite their high fitness level, masters athletes can 
exhibit elevated cardiovascular risk and possess CVD. A 
high FRS (or elevated cardiac risk) was the best predictor 
of CAD in masters athletes and should be incorporated 
into the preparticipation screening algorithm. An ECG 
may be warranted to raise suspicion of and/or diagnose 
asymptomatic disease. Exercise stress testing may be indi-
cated in masters athletes who are symptomatic, have a 
family history of premature CAD and/or have an inter-
mediate or high FRS. The optimal method to screen 
masters athletes requires continued study to decrease the 
number of false-positive screens while having accessible 
and cost-effective screening tools to identify individuals 
potentially at risk.
