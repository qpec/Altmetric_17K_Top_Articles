Abstract
Dietary guidelines continue to recommend restricting intake of saturated fats. This 
recommendation follows largely from the observation that saturated fats can raise levels of total 
serum cholesterol (TC), thereby putatively increasing the risk of atherosclerotic coronary heart 
disease (CHD). However, TC is only modestly associated with CHD, and more important than the 
total level of cholesterol in the blood may be the number and size of low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) particles that contain it. As for saturated fats, these fats are a diverse class of compounds; 
different fats may have different effects on LDL and on broader CHD risk based on the specific 
saturated fatty acids (SFAs) they contain. Importantly, though, people eat foods, not isolated fatty 
acids. Some food sources of SFAs may pose no risk for CHD or possibly even be protective. Thus, 
advice to reduce saturated fat in the diet without regard to such nuance could actually increase 
people’s risk of CHD. When saturated fats are replaced with refined carbohydrates, and 
specifically with added sugars (like sucrose or high fructose corn syrup), the end result is not 
favorable for heart health. Such replacement leads to changes in LDL, high-density lipoprotein 
(HDL), and triglycerides that may increase the risk of CHD. Additionally, diets high in sugar may 
induce many other abnormalities associated with elevated CHD risk, including elevated levels of 
glucose, insulin, and uric acid, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin and leptin resistance, non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease, and altered platelet function. A diet high in added sugars has been 
found to cause a 3-fold increased risk of death due to cardiovascular disease. But sugars, like 
saturated fats, are a diverse class of compounds. The monosaccharide, fructose, and fructose-
containing sweeteners (e.g., sucrose) result in greater degrees of metabolic abnormalities than seen 
with glucose (either isolated as a monomer or in chains as starch) and may present greater risk for

 CHD. This paper reviews the evidence linking saturated fats and sugars to CHD, and concludes 
that the latter is more of a problem than the former. Dietary guidelines should shift focus away 
from reducing saturated fat, and from replacing saturated fat with carbohydrates, specifically when 
these carbohydrates are refined. To reduce the burden of CHD, guidelines should focus 
particularly on reducing intake of concentrated sugars, specifically the fructose-containing sugars 
like sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup in the form of ultra-processed foods and beverages.

Background and History
Atherosclerotic coronary heart disease (CHD) is responsible for one in every six deaths in 
the United States (U.S.).1 Almost 1 million myocardial infarctions ( MIs) occur each year,1 
and approximately 15% of patients die as a result of their event.1 CHD is also a leading 
cause of morbidity throughout the developed world, and a substantial driver of health-care 
related costs.2
In trying to limit the global burden of CHD, prevention is a key strategy. Historically, dietary 
approaches to CHD prevention focused on cholesterol.
The presence of cholesterol in atherosclerotic plaque was first reported in 1843.3 Subsequent 
studies in the early part of the 20th century showed that feeding rabbits cholesterol produced 
atherosclerosis.4–6 The fact that rabbits are naturally herbivores (never eating cholesterol in 
their usual diet) made the significance of these experiments questionable, and while dietary 
cholesterol intake may exert some effects on serum cholesterol and ultimately 
atherosclerotic plaques in humans, dietary cholesterol has increasingly become less of a 
concern for CHD. Other dietary culprits may be of greater concern.
During the 1950s, American scientist Ancel Keys developed a theory of dietary saturated fat 
as the principal promoter of elevated serum cholesterol and heart disease. Keys’ theory was 
embraced by the American Heart Association (AHA), who in 1961 officially recommended 
that Americans lower their intake of saturated fat.7 The theory was also embraced by the 
U.S. federal government as outlined in its 1977 Dietary Goals.8
A competing theory gained less traction than Keys’ but nonetheless had its proponents. 
Around the same time Key’s made his case against saturated fat, a British physiologist, John 
Yudkin, argued that sugar was actually more closely related to CHD incidence and 
mortality.9
In truth, both Yudkin and Keys could find support for their theories in observational studies, 
partly because people eat foods, not isolated food constituents. Dietary sources of saturated 
fat are also often dietary sources of sugar and people who eat lots sugar often also eat lots of 
saturated fat.

 Today, with more than a half-century of science since Yudkin and Keys developed their 
theories, there are now ample data to better assess the potential contributions of saturated fat 
and sugar to CHD. This paper will review the evidence to date, considering basic science, 
epidemiology, and clinical-trial data pertaining to CHD risk, CHD events, and CHD 
mortality.
Saturated fat and CHD risk factors
Although the magnitude of the effect likely varies by specific dietary intake and individual 
susceptibility,10,11 it is well-accepted that saturated fats can raise blood levels of total 
cholesterol (TC).12–14 Since the majority of blood cholesterol is packaged in low-density 
lipoproteins (LDL), elevations in TC reflect elevations in LDL.15 LDL is thought to raise the 
risk of CHD, and LDL is often referred to as “bad cholesterol.”
However, LDL is actually a heterogeneous group of particles, and the sum total of all LDL 
particles considered together is only modestly associated with cardiovascular (CV) risk.16, 17 
For instance, the Framingham Heart Study showed that in men over 50 and in women there 
was no association between elevated TC (which would mostly be packaged in LDL) and 
CHD.18
A consideration with LDL and CHD risk may be particle size and density. Small, dense LDL 
particles might behave differently than large buoyant ones. Small-dense LDL is more 
susceptible to oxidation and is pro-atherogenic,19, 20, 21 pro-thrombotic,22–25 and pro-
inflammatory.26 Conversely large buoyant LDL may be resistant to oxidation and may even 
be anti-atherogenic.27 Although the role in particle size in predicting CV events remains 
controversial, it may not be the total serum level of LDL that mattes as much as the relative 
proportion of small to large particles.
A high concentration of small-dense LDL and a low concentration of large buoyant LDL has 
been associated with greater CHD risk.28 In the Quebec Cardiovascular Study, there was a 3-
fold increase in CHD risk in individuals with small-dense LDL after adjustment for total 
LDL concentration, and other lipid fractions.29
Randomized trial data suggests that eating saturated fats can decrease small-dense LDL and 
increases large buoyant LDL.30 In other words, consumption of saturated fat may favorably 
shift LDL proportions to be protective against CHD—although not all literature supports the 
benign or protective nature of large buoyant LDL.31, 32
Regardless, just as LDL is not a single type of particle, saturated fat is not single kind of fat. 
Saturated fats are a heterogeneous group of compounds; their effects differ based on the 
specific fatty acids they contain. For example, while the saturated fatty acid (SFA), 
palmitate, seems to raise levels of LDL, the SFA, stearate, does not.33
The metabolic aspects of SFAs are complex and non-uniform but existing evidence suggests 
that certain SFAs may confer measurable benefits for lipid profiles and CHD risk. For 
instance, several SFAs enhance the metabolism of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(HDL).33 HDL is often referred to as —good cholesterol as this cholesterol-containing

 lipoprotein is associated with lower risk of CHD. In general the higher the HDL level, and 
lower the level of non-HDL cholesterol or the TC/HDL ratio, the better.34–37 In fact, the 
TC/HDL ratio is a better predictor of CHD risk than TC, LDL alone, or various other lipid 
makers (e.g., apolipoproteins A–I, A–II and B).38, 39
Notably, the SFAs stearate and laurate reduce the TC/HDLratio.12, 33 Thus, saturated fats 
that contain these SFAs specifically may act to reduce CHD risk.
Sugar and CHD risk factors
Reducing saturated fat or any other component from one’s diet almost inevitably means 
replacement with something else. When carbohydrates (particularly refined carbohydrates 
like sugar) replace saturated fats, the result can be unfavorable effects on lipid profiles: TC 
tends to increase,40, 41 HDL tends to fall12,42, 43 and triglycerides (TGs) —also associated 
with CHD44 — tend to rise.12,45, 46
Consuming moderate amounts in sugar has been shown to increase TC and TGs.47, 48 A diet 
high in sugar has been shown to increase TC, TGs, and LDL49 as well as the TC/HDL 
ratio.38, 39, 46 It has been estimated that to match the cholesterol increases seen within a 
typical range of sugar consumption, an individual would need to consume saturated fats at a 
level of about 40% of daily calories50 (well outside the typical range of intake, which the 
best available estimates might place at about 9 to 10 %).51
In addition to lipid derangements, consuming a diet high in sugar for just a few weeks has 
been found to cause numerous changes seen in CHD and other vascular disease.47, 52 Both 
human and animal studies show various metabolic risk for CHD with high sugar diets (e.g., 
impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, elevated uric acid level, and altered platelet 
function).47, 52–54 All of these abnormalities can be reversed when reverting to a diet low in 
sugar.54, 55
Among sugar-related adverse effects, hyperglycemia itself can lead to glycated LDL, which 
has been shown to activate platelets,22–25 and induce vascular inflammation.26 And 
hyperinsulinemia may increase CHD risk through a variety of mechanisms: stimulating 
smooth muscle cell proliferation,56–58 increasing lipogenesis,59 or inducing dyslipidemia,60 
inflammation, oxidative stress, and platelet adhesiveness.61–63
To be clear though, sugar, like saturated fat, is a heterogenous class of compounds. Among 
the sugars, the monosaccharide, fructose, and the disaccharide, sucrose (fructose + glucose), 
seem to be of greater concern than the glucose alone (as a monosaccharide or as a 
polysaccharide in starch). The fructose-containing sugars seem to cause greater derangement 
when it comes to elevated insulin levels,55, 64, 65 reduced insulin sensitivity,66–6869, 70 
increased fasting glucose concentrations,71,72 and increased glucose and insulin responses to 
a sucrose load.55, 64 Providing liquid fructose supplementation to a western-type diet in mice 
increases lipid burden and atherosclerosis despite identical calorie consumption.73
Fructose, as compared to glucose, increases oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL);74 
and the effects of oxLDL on vascular cells cause pathology commonly found in

 atherosclerosis and CAD, such as endothelial cell dysfunction/apoptosis, foam cell 
formation, abnormal vascular tone and blood flow, inflammation, increased cell adhesion 
molecule expression, pro-clotting, and increased intracellular oxidative stress.75 The level of 
oxLDL is significantly higher in patients with CAD, and the sensitivity of oxLDL for 
predicting CAD is substantially better than the Global Risk Assessment Score (GRAS), 
calculated using multiple risk factors including age, TC and HDL, blood pressure, diabetes, 
and smoking (sensitivity 76% for oxLDL vs just 20%, for GRAS). The specificity of oxLDL 
is 90%, thus, fructose’s noteworthy ability to increase oxLDL in humans undoubtedly 
increases the risk of CAD.
Additionally, fructose increases the levels of advanced glycation end products76, 77 — 
which, in turn, may lead to dysfunctional macrophages entering the arterial wall and 
contribute to atherosclerosis.78 Oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species forming in the heart 
and aorta, and lipid peroxidation may also play a role in fructose-induced adverse cardiac 
effects.79, 80 So might an increase in sympathetic nerve activity.81
Added fructose—generally in the forms of sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) in 
processed foods and beverages—also appears to be especially potent for producing diet-
induced leptin resistance.82 Leptin, —the satiety hormone , suppresses hunger and regulates 
energy balance, and thus is a key hormone in the maintenance of normal body weight. 
Leptin resistance may be a fundamental cause of obesity,82, 83 itself a risk factor for CHD.84
Excess fructose or fructose-containing sweeteners also markedly increases risk for non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) — the most common liver disease in the U.S.,85, 86 
and a strong independent risk factor for CHD (probably in part due to associated systemic 
inflammation).85 The association between CHD and NAFLD is stronger than the link 
between CHD and smoking, hypertension, male gender, diabetes, high cholesterol, or 
metabolic syndrome .85 Markedly reducing intake of added sugars, especially sucrose and 
HFCS, can lead to NAFLD regression and, presumably, reduction of associated CHD 
risk.87, 88
Consuming fructose or sucrose has been found to increase myocardial oxygen demand, 
cardiac sympathetic nerve activity, and platelet adhesiveness.47, 89, 90 Feeding sucrose to rats 
causes the development of atheroma, the degree to which depends on the amount of sucrose 
(but, notably, not fat) in the diet.91 Moreover, feeding sucrose to rats, as compared to starch, 
significantly increases the lipid content (total cholesterol, and the free and esterified 
fractions of cholesterol, and TG) of the aorta.91 Finally, sucrose leads to increases in 11-
hydroxycorticosteroids (for example corticosterone) in a proportion of human subjects, 
possibly also increasing CHD risk.92
Saturated fat and CHD events and mortality
Although some saturated fats may affect some lipid fractions in ways that could theoretically 
increase the risk of CHD, a large Swedish population study found no association between fat 
intake (of any type) and CHD.93 A review of cohort and case-control studies likewise did not 
demonstrate a clear role of saturated fats in CHD.94 Moreover, meta-analyses show that

 there is limited and inconclusive evidence for modification of total or saturated fat on 
CHD,95 or CV morbidity or mortality.96
In 1961, there were no randomized trial data to support the AHA dietary fat guidelines, 
which advised restricting saturated fat. There was also no trial data to support the 1977 U.S. 
Dietary Goals, or even the subsequent 1983 Dietary Fat Guidelines from the UK.97 In fact, 
an updated meta-analysis demonstrates that still, to this day, no randomized trial data exist to 
support any of these guidelines (over a quarter century later).98
Conversely, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials show no reduction in all-cause 
mortality or CV mortality with reduced saturated fat intake99 and no reduction in total CHD 
or risk factors like diabetes.100 Even in patients with established CHD, there does not seem 
to be any association between dietary intake of saturated fats and CHD events or 
mortality.101
Importantly though — as mentioned earlier — people do not eat isolated fatty acids; they eat 
foods that are mixes of various fatty acids and other food constituents. So for instance, while 
higher intakes of saturated fats from meat sources (particularly processed meats) may 
increase the risk for CHD, higher intakes of saturated fats from dairy sources may pose no 
increase in risk and may actually decrease risk.102, 103
As for the effects of reducing consumption of saturated fats, reducing consumption generally 
means increasing intake of some other dietary component. Replacing saturated fats with 
other fats like trans-fats100 or omega-6 polyunsaturated oils has been found to increase all-
cause mortality.104105, 106 Replacing saturated fats with whole grains may be beneficial for 
CHD,107 while replacing saturated fats with refined carbohydrates does not decrease risk,107 
and may increase risk of non-fatal MI,108, 109 particularly when the carbohydrates are 
concentrated sugars.110
Sugar and CHD events and mortality
A diet high in added sugars promotes insulin resistance 55, 64, 74, 111, 112 and diabetes,113–116 
and patients with diabetes have more coronary atherosclerosis than patients without 
diabetes,117, 118, 119 particularly severe narrowing of the left main coronary artery.120 
Diabetes increases the risk of death from MI121,122 and from CV disease more generally,123 
even after controlling for lipids, blood pressure, and other covariates.124
Regardless of diabetes status, degree of insulin resistance is associated with future CV 
events125, 126 and severity of MI.127 An elevated insulin response to sugar (an oral glucose 
load) has been found in patients with atherosclerosis of the peripheral, cerebral, and 
coronary arteries,128, 129 and insulin levels following a glucose challenge have been 
independently associated with MI occurrence130 and CHD mortality.130131132
Dietary sugar may induce asymptomatic hyperglycemia, which has been linked to CHD 
death.133,134 Moreover, a diet high in added sugars has been found to cause a 3-fold 
increased risk of death due to CV disease.135

 Historical Perspective
It is worth noting that saturated fat and sugar share many common dietary sources today, in 
an era of ultra-processed foods. But their co-occurrence in the diet is a relatively recent 
phenomenon over the course of human existence.
For most of the roughly 200,000 years that our species has roamed the planet, humans had 
been hunters and gatherers. Animal-derived foods would have likely contributed at least 
some calories to the diets of most people through the ages, and some of the fats in those 
foods would have been saturated. Most diets would have also consisted of considerable 
carbohydrates and, some people may have even had access to sugars (e.g., in the form of 
ripened fruit). But there would have been no refined carbohydrates or added sugars at all 
(except perhaps for rare and serendipitous finds of wild honey).
The situation would have slowly begun to change though around 10,000 years ago, first with 
the advent of agriculture and subsequently with the refining of grain and the isolation of 
sugar. While sugar would have been essentially absent from the diet of most humans 2,000 
years ago, by 1750 A.D., the average consumption of sugar per person in Britain may have 
been about 4 pounds per year.136 Sugar intake since then may have increased exponentially, 
with average consumption in 1850 being closer to 25 lbs. per year, and average consumption 
in 1950 being about 120 lbs. per year.137, 138,139 Today, the average intake of added sugars 
(including sucrose and high fructose corn syrup) remains very near to this level 
(demonstrating a greater than 25-fold increase in just over 250 years, or a period of time 
representing only about 0.1% of the total time our species has been eating).140
Sugars occurring naturally in whole foods like fruits and vegetables pose no problem for 
CHD. Indeed fruits and vegetables (which are likely similar to the plant foods our species 
has been eating for tens of thousands of years) are associated with lower risk for CHD,141 
and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.142 The sugars in these foods occur in reasonable 
doses and in the context of fiber, water, and other healthy constituents.
The problem is refined sugars. For instance, even minimally refined products like fruit juice 
might increase CHD risk,141 and ultra-processed products are of even greater concern. 
Products with added sugars now represent approximately 75% of all packaged foods and 
beverages in the U.S.143 Most commonly, these sugars are fructose-containing varieties (e.g., 
sucrose, HFCS, or straight fructose crystals), which may raise CHD risk even more than 
other sugars.
Ultra-processed foods also often tend to be sources of saturated fat (including those 
containing perhaps the most worrisome SFA, palmitate). While advice to avoid processed 
foods makes for a sound dietary recommendation, advice to avoid SFAs does not. Avoiding 
saturated fats, or rather the whole foods that contain them, might misdirect dietary behavior 
away from foods that may be harmless or even protective (e.g. the dairy foods human have 
been consuming for millennia) and towards foods that may be harmful (e.g., novel, low-fat, 
ultra-processed, modern products, with added sugars replacing saturated fats).

 Conclusion
Many lines of evidence implicate added sugars more than saturated fat as etiologic in CHD. 
We urge dietary guidelines to shift focus away from recommendations to reduce saturated fat 
and towards recommendations to avoid added sugars. Specifically, recommendations should 
support the eating of whole foods (e.g. foods from living botanical plants) and the avoidance 
of ultra-processed foods (i.e., foods from industrial processing plants).

 Summary Table
Dietary guidelines continue to recommend restricting intake of saturated fats. This recommendation is based 
largely on the observation that saturated fats can raise levels of TC, thereby putatively increasing the risk of 
CHD.
TC matters less for CHD than how cholesterol is packaged into transport particles. LDL is one class of 
transport particles, with different implications for CHD depending on particle size and density.
Small-dense LDL is more susceptible to oxidation and is pro-atherogenic,19, 20, 21 pro- thrombotic,22–25 and pro-
inflammatory.26 Conversely large buoyant LDL is resistant to oxidation and my even be anti-atherogenic.144
Eating saturated fat can decreases small-dense LDL and increases large buoyant LDL.30
But saturated fat is a diverse class of compounds, with different implications for lipid profiles and CHD risk 
depending on the type of fatty acids the fats contains. The SFA, palmitate, raises levels of LDL; the SFA, 
stearate, does not. Stearate and laurate reduce the TC/HDLratio.33
Importantly, people eat foods, not isolated fatty acids, and the mix of fatty acids and other food components 
matters. Some food sources of SFAs may increase the risk of CHD (e.g., processed meats) but other may have 
no effect or even decrease the risk (e.g. dairy foods).
Meta-analyses of randomized trials do not demonstrate a clear role for saturated fat in increasing all-cause 
mortality or CHD mortality.97, 99
Saturated fats have played some role in the human diet for the last 2.6 million years. Conversely, added sugars 
have only played a significant role in the last few hundred years. In the modern era of ultra-processed foods, 
dietary sources of saturated fats are also often dietary sources of sugar.
When sugar replace saturated fats, the result can be unfavorable effects on lipid profiles: TC tends to 
increase,40, 41 HDL tends to drop12,42, 43 and triglycerides tend to rise12,45, 46
High sugar diets are associated with impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, elevated uric acid level, and 
altered platelet function47, 52–54—abnormalities that can be reversed when reverting to a diet low in sugar.54, 55
Sugar-related hyperglycemia is associated with pro-inflammatory and prothrombotic glycated LDL, and sugar-
related hyperinsulinemia is associated with smooth muscle cell proliferation,56–58 lipogenesis,59 dyslipidemia,60 
inflammation, oxidative stress, and increased platelet adhesiveness.61–63
Some sugars may be more problematic than others with regard to CHD risk: fructose, and fructose-containing 
sweeteners (e.g. sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup) may present greater risk for CHD than glucose (alone or 
as starch).55, 64, 74 Fructose, as compared to glucose, increases oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL);74 
which likely leads to endothelial cell dysfunction/apoptosis, foam cell formation, abnormal vascular tone and 
blood flow, inflammation, increased cell adhesion molecule expression, pro-clotting, and increased intracellular 
oxidative stress.75 Additionally, fructose increases the levels of advanced glycation end products76, 77—which, 
may lead to dysfunctional macrophages entering the arterial wall and contribute to atherosclerosis.78 Oxidative 
stress, reactive oxygen species forming in the heart and aorta, and lipid peroxidation may also play a role in 
fructose-induced adverse cardiac effects.79, 80
Feeding sucrose to rats causes the development of atheroma, the degree to which depends on the amount of 
sucrose (not fat) in the diet.91 Humans that develop ischemic heart disease have been found to eat more sugar, 
not more fat.138
Sugar seems to act as both a predisposing factor for heart disease (e.g. through inflammatory, thrombotic, 
oxidative, and hormonal pathways), and a precipitating factor (e.g. through an increase in myocardial oxygen 
demand, cardiac sympathetic nerve activity, and platelet adhesiveness).47, 89, 90
Replacing saturated fats with sugars increases the risk of non-fatal MI 108, 109 A diet high in added sugars has 
been found to cause a 3-fold increased risk of death due to cardiovascular disease.135
Dietary guidelines should shift focus away from reducing saturated fat, and from replacing saturated fat with 
carbohydrates, especially when these carbohydrates are refined. To reduce the burden of CHD, guidelines 
should focus particularly on reducing intake of concentrated sugars, specifically the fructose-containing sugars 
added by industry like sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup.
