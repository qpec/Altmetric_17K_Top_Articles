ABSTRACT
Background: Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) poses a 
substantial burden to health care payers including employers, 
costing an estimated $29 billion–$48 billion yearly in the United 
States. Furthermore, variation of burden across increasing levels of 
resistance and the potential impact of TRD on employment status 
remain largely unexplored.
Objective: To evaluate health care resource utilization (HRU) and 
costs, work loss, indirect costs, and employment status change in 
TRD.
Methods: A claims-based algorithm identified adults with TRD 
from a US claims database of privately insured employees and 
dependents (January 2010–March 2015). TRD patients were 
matched 1:1 on demographics to patients with major depressive 
disorder (MDD) (non-TRD MDD) and without MDD (non-MDD), 
who were identified using ICD-9-CM codes. Costs, HRU, and 
employment status change were compared over 2 years following 
the first antidepressant (randomly imputed date for non-MDD), 
adjusting for baseline comorbidity index and costs.
Results: TRD patients (N = 6,411) had more HRU than either 
matched control cohort, translating into higher per patient per 
year (PPPY) health care costs: $6,709 and $9,917 more than non-
TRD MDD and non-MDD patients, respectively (P < .001 for both). 
TRD patients with work loss data (N = 1,908) had 35.8 work loss 
days PPPY (1.7 and 6.2 times the work loss rate in non-TRD MDD 
and non-MDD patients, respectively). Work loss–related costs in 
TRD patients were $1,811 higher than non-TRD MDD and $3,460 
higher than in non-MDD patients (P < .001). TRD patients had 
1.3–1.4 times the rate of employment status change versus control 
cohorts (all P < .05).
Conclusions: TRD, even compared to MDD, poses a significant 
direct and indirect cost burden to US employers and may be 
associated with higher rates of employment status change.

M
ajor depressive disorder (MDD) affects nearly 9% 
of the US population1–3 and carries an estimated 
burden of $210.5 billion in the United States.3–7 Nearly half 
of this impact is attributable to direct medical expenses, 
with the remainder borne in the workplace through 
absenteeism and presenteeism and in the labor market more 
generally through changes in the employment status and 
suicidality.5,8–12 As the second leading cause of disability 
worldwide, MDD also presents a serious burden for patients 
and their caregivers,13 translating, on average, into over 8 
hours per week of lost productivity14 and lower personal 
earnings and household income15 than for depression-free 
patients. Although effective treatments are associated with 
reduced symptoms, health care resource utilization (HRU), 
and costs, approximately half of MDD patients do not 
respond to their first antidepressant therapy, a significant 
proportion of whom do not benefit from multiple lines of 
therapy, thus progressing to treatment-resistant depression 
(TRD).16–22 While there is no universally accepted TRD 
definition, it is most frequently defined as MDD in patients 
who have not responded adequately to at least 2 different 
antidepressants of adequate dose and duration.19
TRD accounts for a large share of the MDD burden, 
estimated at $29 billion–48 billion annually in direct 
health care and indirect work loss–related costs in the 
United States.17 Cost-of-illness studies have shown that 
compared to patients with MDD, those with TRD have 2 
to 3 times greater direct and indirect HRU and costs.23–30 
Furthermore, costs within the TRD population most likely 
increase with the number of treatment failures.23,25,26,29,30
While there is a well-established relationship between 
TRD and increased depression severity, less is known about 
the burden of TRD on important life outcomes such as 
employment changes and absenteeism. For example, given 
that depression largely impacts working populations, the 
higher job-loss rate among TRD patients is of interest.17,31,32 
Thus, further research is needed to assess the incremental 
burden of TRD patients compared to MDD patients without 
TRD and to patients without MDD.
The study assessed the direct and indirect HRU and costs 
as well as employment status changes in patients with TRD 
compared to patients with and without MDD and assessed 
direct health care costs across increasing levels of treatment 
resistance (ie, using the number of lines of therapy as a 
proxy) among patients with TRD.

METHODS
Data Source
The study used health claims from the OptumHealth 
Care Solutions, Inc database (July 2009–March 2015), 
which includes data for over 19.1 million privately insured 
individuals covered by 84 self-insured Fortune 500 companies 
in the United States. The database contains information on 
medical claims (eg, payment; International Classification 
of Diseases, ninth revision [ICD-9] diagnoses; Current 
Procedural Terminology codes), prescription drug claims 
(eg, supply days, date of service, National Drug Codes), 
and eligibility (eg, age, gender, enrollment dates). Data for 
short- and long-term disability claims, salary data, and 
employment status (ie, active, terminated, or Consolidated 
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act [COBRA] status) were 
also available for a subset of patients. Data are deidentified 
and comply with the patient confidentiality requirements 
of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
Study Design and Cohorts
The study used a retrospective, longitudinal, matched 
cohort design consisting of 3 mutually exclusive cohorts: (1) 
TRD patients (TRD cohort), (2) MDD patients without TRD 
(non-TRD MDD cohort), and (3) patients without MDD 
(non-MDD cohort).
TRD and non-TRD MDD cohorts. To be included in the 
TRD and non-TRD MDD cohorts, patients were required to 
meet the following criteria: (a) have at least 1 diagnosis for 
MDD (ICD-9-CM: 296.2x, 296.3x), (b) have at least 1 claim 
for an antidepressant starting from January 2010 (defined 
as the index date) without antidepressant claims 6 months 
before, (c) have at least 1 diagnosis for depression (ICD-
9-CM: 296.2x, 296.3x, 300.4x, 311.x, 309.0x, or 309.1x) at 
least 6 months prior or after the index date, and (d) have 
claims for at least 1 antidepressant agent with an adequate 
dose and duration after the index date. Adequate dose was 
defined as the minimum starting dose recommended by the 
American Psychiatric Association treatment guidelines.33 
Adequate duration was defined as at least 6 weeks of 
continuous therapy with no gaps longer than 14 days.
MDD patients were considered to have TRD after 2 
antidepressant treatment courses (including augmentation 
therapy with anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, antipsychotic, 
lithium, psychostimulant, and thyroid hormone medications; 
see Supplementary eTables 1 and 2 at PSYCHIATRIST.COM 
for lists of antidepressant and augmentation medications, 
respectively) with adequate dose and duration failed to 
improve their depression. Failure of a treatment course was 
defined as a switch of antidepressant (no more than 180 days 
after the end of the previous treatment), the addition of an 
antidepressant, or the initiation of an augmentation therapy. 
The initiation of the third antidepressant or augmentation 
medication defined TRD.
MDD patients not defined as having TRD within 2 years 
of the index date were considered non-TRD MDD.
Non-MDD cohort. The non-MDD cohort consisted 
of a random sample of 500,000 patients without an MDD 
diagnosis at any time. The index date was randomly assigned 
during January 1, 2010–March 31, 2015.
All cohorts. All patients also had to meet the following 
criteria: no diagnosis for specific psychiatric comorbidities 
(ie, psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder/manic 
depression, dementia), no Medicare coverage, age of 18 to 64 
years at the index date, and at least 6 months of continuous 
eligibility pre- and post-index date.
Baseline and observation periods. Baseline characteristics 
were evaluated in the 6 months pre-index date (baseline 
period), while outcomes were evaluated from the index 
date up to the earliest of 2 years post-index date, the end 
of continuous eligibility, or the end of data availability 
(observation period).
Study Outcomes
Treatment patterns included antidepressant and mental 
health–related medication use and antidepressant therapy 
duration.
Direct HRU and costs consisted of all-cause, mental 
health–related, and depression-related components reported 
overall and by type (ie, inpatient, emergency department 
[ED], outpatient, and other [eg, medical ancillary services]). 
Direct health care costs among TRD patients were also 
measured from the start of TRD up to 2 years post-TRD and 
stratified by the number of lines of therapy with adequate 
dose and duration.
Indirect work loss–related HRU included the number of 
total work loss days, medical-related absenteeism days (ie, a 
full day for inpatient visits and a half day for ED, outpatient, 
and other visits), and disability days. Indirect work loss–
related costs included medical-related absenteeism costs 
(imputed from absenteeism days and wage) and disability 
costs among primary plan holders with work loss data.
Time to employment status change was defined as the 
time from the index date to employment termination or 
COBRA status and was censored at the end of eligibility or 
the end of data availability. COBRA enables individuals who 
meet certain requirements to continue receiving coverage 
after they would otherwise become ineligible (eg, due to 
termination or reduced hours) at the full expense to the 
employee for the plan premiums. Since both termination and 
COBRA status represent changes in employment status, a 
composite outcome of either termination or COBRA status 
Clinical Points
 
■ The burden of treatment-resistant depression is well 
documented, but its impact relative to depression alone 
and its impact on employment are relatively unknown.
 
■ Patients with treatment-resistant depression incur more 
health care costs and resource use than those without, 
and that burden increases with the level of resistance.
 
■ Treatment-resistant depression involves a significant 
indirect burden, including absenteeism and employment 
status change.

was also assessed. As exploratory outcomes, direct 
health care costs were assessed pre- and post-
COBRA in TRD and non-TRD MDD cohorts.
Statistical Analysis
To control for potential confounding, the 2 
control cohorts were matched 1:1 to the TRD 
cohort on the relationship to plan holder (ie, 
primary or dependent), work loss data availability, 
and a propensity score (modeled using logistic 
regression controlling for age, sex, year of the index 
date, region, and health care plan type).
Baseline characteristics were compared between 
cohorts using McNemar tests for categorical 
and Wilcoxon signed rank tests for continuous 
variables. HRU was compared using multivariate 
negative binomial or Poisson regression based on 
overdispersion tests and reported using incidence 
rate ratios. Costs (2015 US $) were expressed per 
patient per month (PPPM) or year (PPPY) using 
means, standard deviations (SDs), and medians 
and were compared using multivariate ordinary 
least squares regression (ie, cost differences). 
Multivariate models adjusted for baseline total 
health care costs and Quan-Charlson Comorbidity 
Index (Quan-CCI),34 with confidence intervals 
(CIs) and P values for cost outcomes obtained 
from a nonparametric bootstrap procedure (499 
replications). Employment status change was 
compared using univariate Cox proportional 
hazards regression (ie, hazard ratios [HRs]).
RESULTS
Among 39,479 treated MDD patients, 6,411 
(16%) patients met the criteria for TRD, with a 
median time to TRD of 9 months (Figure 1), while 
the remaining 33,068 (84%) comprised the non-
TRD MDD cohort (pre-matching). Of 500,000 
randomly selected non-MDD patients, 149,884 
(30%) met all inclusion/exclusion criteria and were 
used for matching.
Baseline Characteristics
TRD patients were mostly female (64%), 
with a mean age of 40.5 years (Table 1). Among 
the 6,411 TRD patients, 44% were primary plan 
holders (n = 2,800), 68% of whom (n = 1,908) had 
available work loss data. Prior to matching, TRD 
and non-TRD MDD patients were not significantly 
different in age, gender, or health care plan type. 
However, a higher proportion of TRD patients 
lived in the southern United States (33% vs 29%), 
and a lower proportion were primary plan holders 
(44% vs 47%; all P < .001) compared to non-TRD 
MDD patients. Compared to the unmatched non-
MDD cohort, TRD patients were younger (41 vs 
42 years), with a lower proportion being female (64% vs 50%) and 
primary plan holders (44% vs 51%; all P < .001).
After matching, both control cohorts were similar to the TRD cohort 
in demographics. TRD patients had a higher physical comorbidity 
burden than either matched control cohort (eg, TRD vs non-TRD 
MDD Quan-CCI: 0.3 vs 0.2), with higher proportions for hypertension 
(13%), hypothyroidism (6%), and chronic pulmonary disease (6%) 
compared to both control cohorts. TRD patients were more likely to 
use mental health–related medications compared to either matched 
control cohort (eg, TRD vs non-TRD MDD: 38% vs 26%) and received 
more unique mental health–related agents (eg, TRD vs non-TRD 
MDD, 0.6 vs 0.3). TRD patients also had higher PPPM baseline health 
care costs ($1,101) compared to non-TRD MDD ($828) or non-MDD 
matched controls ($380; all P < .001).
Treatment Patterns
During the observation period, 41% of TRD patients had ≥ 6 lines 
of antidepressant/augmentation therapy. All TRD and non-TRD

Economic Burden and Employment Status Change in TRD
MDD patients used an antidepressant during follow-up (per 
inclusion criteria), compared to 13% of non-MDD patients 
(Supplementary eTable 3). TRD patients used nearly twice 
as many unique antidepressant agents as non-TRD MDD 
patients (3.3 vs 1.7). The most commonly used antidepressant 
therapeutic classes were selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (eg, TRD: 87%), norepinephrine-dopamine 
reuptake inhibitors (eg, TRD: 53%), and serotonin-
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (eg, TRD: 49%). Most 
TRD patients received other psychiatric medications (91%), 
such as anxiolytics (69%), anticonvulsants (37%), and 
antipsychotics (31%); 42% were treated with psychotherapy. 
Fewer non-TRD MDD patients (58%) and non-MDD 
patients (15%) used other psychiatric medications compared 
to TRD patients (all P < .001).
Direct HRU and Costs
Results comparing HRU and direct costs between TRD 
and non-TRD MDD and non-MDD patients are shown in 
Figures 2 and 3A, respectively. TRD patients had more HRU 
than either control cohort (eg, 2.0 and 4.7 times the inpatient 
visit rate vs non-TRD MDD and non-MDD controls, 
respectively). Furthermore, TRD patients had higher PPPY 
direct health care costs: $6,709 more than non-TRD MDD 
controls and $9,917 more than non-MDD controls after 
adjustment (all P < .001). Higher direct costs among TRD 
patients were driven predominantly by higher inpatient and 
outpatient costs (details are shown in Supplementary eTables 
4 and 5, respectively).
In a sensitivity analysis, unadjusted cost differences were 
also compared: larger differences were consistently found 
with a similar magnitude. Unadjusted PPPY health care costs 
in TRD patients were $7,471 higher than in non-TRD MDD 
controls and $12,479 higher than in non-MDD controls. 
Similar findings were also observed when the analysis was 
restricted to primary plan holders (data not shown).
Among TRD patients (ie, patients with failure of at least 
2 antidepressant treatment courses), all-cause pharmacy and 
medical costs increased with the number of lines of therapy 
of adequate dose and duration (Figure 4). Specifically, as 
lines of therapy of adequate dose and duration increased 
from 2 to 6 or more, all-cause health care costs increased 
from $12,047 to $18,667 in TRD patients. Mental health–
related and depression-related costs also increased with the 
number of lines of therapy of adequate dose and duration 
(Supplementary eTable 6).
Indirect HRU and Costs
Results for indirect work loss–related HRU and costs 
are shown in Figures 2 and 3B, respectively, and were 
measured up to 2 years post-index. TRD employees had 35.8 
work loss days PPPY on average (25.8 disability and 10.0

medical-related absenteeism days; Supplementary eTables 
7 and 8), which after adjustment was 1.7 and 6.2 times the 
rate of work loss days in employees with and without MDD, 
respectively. Consequently, TRD employees had higher PPPY 
work loss–related costs: $1,811 more than non-TRD MDD 
employees and $3,460 more than non-MDD employees (all 
P < .001).
Employment Status Change and  
Pre- and Post-COBRA Costs
Among employees (ie, primary plan holders), there were 
212 TRD patients, 161 non-TRD MDD controls, and 141 
non-MDD controls for whom there was employment status 
change during follow-up. TRD employees were 1.6 times 
more likely than non-TRD MDD employees (HR [95% CI]: 
1.59 [1.06–2.39]; P = .023) and 2.3 times more likely than 
non-MDD employees (HR [95%, CI]: 2.29 [1.44–3.65]; 
P < .001) to switch to COBRA status during follow-up. 
There was no significant difference between cohorts for 
employment termination. The composite endpoint of 
termination or switch to COBRA was more likely among 
TRD than non-TRD MDD employees (HR [95% CI]: 1.28 
[1.04–1.57]; P = .019) and non-MDD employees (HR [95% 
CI]: 1.37 [1.11–1.69]; P = .004).
The average pre-COBRA follow-up time was 10 months for 
TRD and 8 months for non-TRD MDD employees, while the 
average post-COBRA follow-up time was 9 months for both 
cohorts. Pre-COBRA average direct PPPM health care costs 
were similar for TRD (mean ± SD [median]: $2,620 ± $3,880 
[$1,353]) and non-TRD MDD ($2,796 ± $5,558 [$579]) 
employees, while post-COBRA PPPM health care costs for 
TRD ($5,094 ± $14,163 [$1,051]) were twice those of non-
TRD MDD employees ($2,346 ± $5,301 [$264]).
DISCUSSION
The present study found a substantial economic burden 
of TRD relative to that incurred by non-TRD MDD patients 
and non-MDD patients, consistent with what has been 
shown in literature.5,8,16,17,23–28,30 Specifically, direct and 
indirect HRU and costs were double those of non-TRD 
MDD patients and quadruple those of non-MDD patients, 
consistent with prior work (2 times the direct and indirect 
costs of non-TRD MDD patients17,24,26–28; 4 to 5 times 
higher than non-MDD patients17,24,26), although there are 
some methodological differences across the literature (eg, 
criteria used to define TRD). For example, Ivanova et al27 
found that direct and indirect costs nearly doubled among 
patients with TRD versus MDD alone. Cost estimates in the 
present study did tend to be larger in magnitude compared 
to previous work (eg, Ivanova et al27 reported $11,392 in 
average annual direct costs [2007 US $] for TRD-likely

Economic Burden and Employment Status Change in TRD

After TRD, Stratified by the Number of Antidepressant/Augmentation Lines of Therapy With Adequate Dose 
and Durationb 
aThe TRD cohort was defined as MDD patients for whom 2 antidepressant treatment courses (including augmentation therapy with 
anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, antipsychotic, lithium, psychostimulant, and thyroid hormone medications; see Supplementary eTables 1 
and 2 at Psychiatrist.com for lists of antidepressant and augmentation medications, respectively) with adequate dose and duration 
failed to improve their depression. Failure of a treatment course was defined as a switch of antidepressant (no more than 180 days after 
the end of the previous treatment), the addition of an antidepressant, or the initiation of an augmentation therapy. The initiation of the 
third antidepressant or augmentation medication defined TRD. 
bAdequate dose was defined as the minimum starting dose recommended by the American Psychiatric Association treatment 
guidelines. Adequate duration was defined as at least 6 weeks of continuous therapy with no gaps longer than 14 days.

employees). The direct cost burden in the present study was 
high irrespective of whether it was evaluated among primary 
plan holders only or included their dependents. The burden 
also increased with increasing levels of treatment resistance, 
which is consistent with prior work using staging methods 
or number of regimen changes to define TRD.25,30 Further, 
the rate of TRD among MDD patients reported in this study 
(16%) is similar to that reported in other claims-based studies 
(12%–15%),24,27 although higher rates have been observed in 
studies using prospective data collection or staging methods 
for TRD (~28%–39%).20,25,28,31
Although TRD did not significantly impact employment 
termination alone, TRD was significantly associated with 
status changes that prompted an employee to purchase 
COBRA coverage (eg, transition to part-time employment or 
medical leave). While precise reasons for changes to COBRA 
status are unknown, TRD employees may be more prone 
to seek COBRA coverage to ensure continuation of care for 
their medical needs, despite potentially costly implications.
Switching to COBRA coverage may also suggest that the 
employee is seeking new full-time employment, though 
this is unlikely, given that job turnover among patients 
with depression has been shown to relate to lower hourly 
earnings, a 4 times higher rate of presenteeism (ie, work loss 
productivity), and loss of employment due to impaired job 
performance.35 Presenteeism in TRD has been previously 
estimated at 6.1 times of absenteeism costs, translating in 
the present study to $9,645 PPPY in total work loss–related 
costs (up from $4,576 PPPY without presenteeism) for TRD 
employees.3,35
As other comorbidities can also contribute to TRD 
burden,3 a sensitivity analysis without adjustment for 
Quan-CCI and baseline health care costs revealed a similar 
magnitude of burden albeit with larger differences. This 
suggests that TRD itself contributes substantially to the 
burden in this population, beyond the contribution of 
MDD or comorbidities alone, and is most likely estimated 
conservatively in our primary analysis.3 The differences 
in comorbidities contributing to the overall burden may 
indicate that successfully controlling TRD could potentially 
result in additional cost savings from non-mental health–
related conditions associated with depression3,27 and 
improvements in employment outcomes (eg, employment 
rate increase with better depression symptom control).35

Amos et al
The strength of the study comes from directly comparing 
TRD patients to patients with and without MDD, as well 
as assessing employees and employment status changes to 
illustrate an incremental TRD burden on a continuum (ie, 
from depression-free to likely most-severe forms of TRD 
with multiple lines of therapy). Employment changes and 
absenteeism assessments further illustrate the TRD burden 
in a working population most affected by the disorder.17,31,32 
Few studies to date have included these 2 comparison 
groups while assessing direct and indirect HRU and costs 
as well as employment status change in the same patients.
Limitations
TRD exists along a clinical continuum without a 
consensus definition, though the present study used the 
most common TRD definition. Diagnoses reported in 
claims (including disability claims) are for administrative 
purposes and were not validated; thus, they may be 
underreported as a function of social stigma. TRD was 
defined using pharmacy claims and excludes other clinical 
considerations (eg, persistence of symptoms). In addition, 
employment data lacked the full range of presenteeism 
outcomes. Health care and disability claims may also be 
subject to inaccuracies, although these are likely to affect all 
cohorts similarly. Finally, the results may not be generalizable 
to the population at large given specific study criteria among 
a privately insured US population.
CONCLUSIONS
The present study demonstrated that TRD carries 
a significant direct and indirect economic burden and 
adversely affects employment, with direct costs increasing 
substantially with levels of resistance. These results add to 
the cost-of-illness literature by demonstrating an unmet 
need and the importance of developing novel treatments 
beyond those currently available for patients suffering with 
MDD. If such therapies could help to address the crippling 
effects of TRD on patients’ personal and professional lives, 
while reducing the economic burden on health care payers, 
they would provide tremendous societal benefits. Further 
research is needed to increase our understanding of factors 
responsible for TRD and to improve quality of care for 
patients suffering from this disorder.

Notes: 
[1] Unadjusted cost differences were estimated using an ordinary least squares regression model and 95% CIs and p-values were estimated using a non-parametric bootstrap procedure (N=499). 
[2] Adjusted cost differences were estimated using an ordinary least squares regression model adjusted for baseline Quan-Charlson comorbidity index and total healthcare costs; 95% CIs and p-values were estimated using a 
non-parametric bootstrap procedure (N=499). 
[3] Psychiatric pharmacy costs include the following classes of agents (generic product identifier [GPI] prefix): anxiolytics (‘57’), antipsychotics/antimanics (‘59’), anticonvulsants (‘7299’, ‘721’, ‘726’), and other mood 
stabilizers (e.g., lithium). 
[4] Mental health-related costs were defined as all costs during a visit with any of the following ICD-9 CM diagnostic codes: 290.xx – 319.xx.

Notes: 
[1] The TRD cohort was defined as MDD patients for whom 2 antidepressant treatment courses (including augmentation therapy with anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, antipsychotic, lithium, psychostimulant, and thyroid hormone 
medications; see Supplementary eTables 1 and 2 at Psychiatrist.com for lists of antidepressant and augmentation medications, respectively) with adequate dose and duration failed to improve their depression. Failure of a 
treatment course was defined as a switch of antidepressant (no more than 180 days after the end of the previous treatment), the addition of an antidepressant, or the initiation of an augmentation therapy. The initiation of the 
third antidepressant or augmentation medication defined TRD. 
[2] Adequate dose was defined as the minimum starting dose recommended by the American Psychiatric Association treatment guidelines. Adequate duration was defined as at least 6 weeks of continuous therapy with no gaps 
longer than 14 days. 
[3] Psychiatric pharmacy costs include the following classes of agents: anxiolytics, antipsychotics/antimanics, anticonvulsants, and other mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium). 
[4] Mental health-related costs were defined as all costs during a visit with any of the following ICD-9 CM diagnostic codes: 290.xx – 319.xx. 
[5] Depression-related costs were defined as all costs during a visit with any of the following ICD-9 CM diagnostic codes: 296.2x, 296.3x, 300.4x, 309.0x, 309.1x, 311.xx.

CI = confidence interval; ED = emergency department; HRU = healthcare resource utilization; IRR = incidence rate ratio; PY = patient-years; TRD = treatment-resistant depression. 
* Significant at the 5% level 
Notes: 
 [1] IRRs, 95% CIs, and p-values were estimated using a generalized linear model (GLM) with a negative binomial or a Poisson distribution based on the results of the overdispersion test. 
[2] Adjusted IRRs were adjusted for baseline Quan-Charlson comorbidity index and total healthcare costs.  
[3] The number of medical-related absenteeism days was imputed based on length of stay for inpatient visits or a half day each for ED, outpatient, and other visits. 
[4] Mental health-related HRU were identified using the following ICD-9 CM diagnostic codes: 290.xx – 319.xx. 
[5] Depression-related HRU were identified using the following ICD-9 CM diagnostic codes: 296.2x, 296.3x, 300.4x, 309.0x, 309.1x, 311.xx. 
[6] Suicide-related HRU were identified using the following ICD-9 CM diagnostic codes: E95x, V62.84.
