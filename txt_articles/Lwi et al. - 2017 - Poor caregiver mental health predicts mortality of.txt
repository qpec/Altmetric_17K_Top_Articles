Dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases cause profound
declines in functioning; thus, many patients require caregivers for
assistance with daily living. Patients differ greatly in how long they
live after disease onset, with the nature and severity of the disease
playing an important role. Caregiving can also be extremely stress-
ful, and many caregivers experience declines in mental health. In
this study, we investigated the role that caregiver mental health
plays in patient mortality. In 176 patient–caregiver dyads, we found
that worse caregiver mental health predicted greater patient mor-
tality even when accounting for key risk factors in patients (i.e.,
diagnosis, age, sex, dementia severity, and patient mental health).
These findings highlight the importance of caring for caregivers as
well as patients when attempting to improve patients’ lives.

O
ver 35 million adults worldwide have been diagnosed with
dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases—disorders
that lead to progressive declines in cognitive, emotional, and
motor functioning (1). These declines cause many patients to rely
on family members for caregiving, with estimates indicating that
over 17 million Americans are providing unpaid care for an aging
adult (2). Neurodegenerative diseases are inevitably fatal; how-
ever, individuals differ greatly in how long they live after their
disease has been diagnosed. Research has underscored the im-
portant influence that patient factors (e.g., disease severity, age)
have on patient mortality (3), but less attention has been given to
the influence that caregivers have on patient mortality. Caregivers
fulfill patients’ essential needs, from helping them with activities of
daily living (e.g., eating) to administering health directives and
advocating for their care (4). This assistance is essential to patient
outcomes, but it also takes a toll on the caregivers themselves.
Many caregivers suffer from poor mental health (5), which may in
turn shape the care patients receive (6). Thus, although patient-
centered factors play an undeniably important role in patient
mortality, caregiver-centered factors are also crucial to examine.
Patient Factors That Predict Mortality
In patients with neurodegenerative disease, survival after receiving
a diagnosis can vary between 3 and 10 y, with average survival
being under 5 y (7). A number of patient characteristics have been
found to be associated with greater mortality, including male sex,
later age of onset, poor mental health, disease subtype, and disease
severity (8–10).
Caregiving as a Risk Factor for Poor Mental Health
Although some caregivers find caring for a patient with neurode-
generative disease to be rewarding and remain resilient to the stress
of caregiving (11, 12), others find the experience to be extremely
burdensome and develop significant physical and mental health
problems (13). For example, caregivers suffer from depression at four
times the rate of noncaregivers (14) and are almost three times as
likely to seek treatment for anxiety (15). Caregivers can become in-
creasingly socially isolated, and the subsequent decreases in social
support are closely linked to worsening caregiver mental health (16).
Do Declines in Caregiver Mental Health Predict Patient
Mortality?
Declines in caregiver mental health are a common outcome of
caregiving. These declines, in turn, represent a plausible risk
factor for patient mortality, given the crucial role that caregivers
play in patients’ lives. Caregiver mental health can influence
patient mortality in several ways. First, worse mental health in
caregivers can influence the quality of care they provide. For
example, depressed caregivers are more likely to engage in pa-
tient neglect and abuse (6, 17), behaviors that are known to
predict patient mortality (18). Second, caregiver mental health
problems can weaken the social bond between patients and
caregivers. For example, caregivers often report feeling lonely
and isolated in their relationships (19). Low-quality relationship
functioning has been linked to poorer physical health, impaired
immune functioning, and mortality in relationship partners (20,
21). Finally, worse mental health in caregivers may negatively
influence patients through emotion contagion or behavioral
mimicry. Given that caregivers experience relatively high levels
of stress (2, 22), and that stress-related expressions of negative
affect and physiological arousal (e.g., cortisol levels) tend to be
shared within relationship partners (23–26), it is possible that
caregivers’ subjective and physiological experience of stress may
be transmitted to the patients in their care. Given that height-
ened stress has been linked with poor health and mortality
(27–29), patients may in turn experience greater risks to their
own health.
Significance
In this study, we investigated the role that caregiver mental
health plays in patient mortality. In 176 patient–caregiver
dyads, we found that worse caregiver mental health predicted
greater patient mortality even when accounting for key risk
factors in patients (i.e., diagnosis, age, sex, dementia severity,
and patient mental health). Thus, although providing the best
possible care for the large and growing number of individuals
with neurodegenerative disease is an important public health
priority, our findings suggest that these efforts should also
consider caregiver mental health as an important intervention
target. These findings represent research at the intersection of
psychology, neuroscience, and medical science, and highlight
the importance of caring for caregivers as well as patients
when attempting to improve patients’ lives.

COGNITIVE SCIENCES
 Present Study
The existing literature has established a number of patient fac-
tors that influence patient mortality, but relatively few studies
have examined how caregiver factors influence patient mortality
(30). Furthermore, no studies to our knowledge have examined
whether caregiver mental health uniquely predicts patient mor-
tality after accounting for relevant patient risk factors. The
present study addressed this crucial gap in a sample of 176
caregivers and patients with a wide range of neurodegenerative
diseases. We examined whether caregiver mental health pre-
dicted patient mortality above and beyond well-established patient
risk factors (i.e., diagnosis, age, sex, dementia severity, patient
mental health) and other caregiver characteristics that could
influence mortality (e.g., caregiver physical health).
Methods
Participants. All study participants were recruited between 2007 and 2012 from
the University of California (UC) San Francisco Memory and Aging Center
(MAC), where they received diagnoses and clinical care. Patients were referred
to the MAC by a number of sources including self-referrals, clinician referrals,
and referrals through Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers. Given the MAC’s
expertise in neurodegenerative disease and ongoing research programs, re-
ferrals typically include less common neurodegenerative diseases subtypes
(e.g., frontotemporal dementia). Thus, although patient recruitment was con-
secutive (resulting in a random sample), the distribution of diseases in our
sample was somewhat different than that seen in typical memory clinics (Table 1).
At the MAC, patients were introduced to the dementia research project and,
if interested, could opt into the study and be contacted by recruiters to schedule
their research visits. Participants underwent standard neurological and psy-
chological testing, assessment of cognitive and behavioral symptoms, and
structural brain scans (MRI). This information was used to provide a diagnosis
based on current criteria (see below). Participants diagnosed with a neuro-
degenerative disease who had a reliable informant were then consecutively
recruited and given the option to opt into a separate laboratory session at the
UC Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (BPL) that was focused on assessing
patients’ and caregivers’ social and emotional functioning (31). Prospective
participants in the BPL assessment were informed that their participation was
voluntary, their decision would have no effect on their medical treatment, and
they could opt out from this aspect of the research at any time. Participants
received no payment for the BPL session beyond reimbursement for
lunch, transportation, and incidental expenses. Approximately 37% of MAC
participants agreed to complete the laboratory visit at the BPL.
During the 5 y of this study, 176 patients and their familial caregivers were
assessed at both the MAC and the BPL. Unless patients chose to opt out, patients
were then followed at the MAC until death and, for those who consented, au-
topsy. In this sample, (i) 48 patients met diagnostic criteria for behavioral-variant
frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) (32), (ii) 20 for nonfluent variant primary
progressive aphasia (nfvPPA), (iii) 31 for semantic variant primary progressive
aphasia (svPPA) (33), (iv) 41 for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (34), (v) 19 for cortico-
basal syndrome (CBS) (35), and (vi) 17 for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)
(36). Within the present sample, 85% of caregivers (n = 149) were spouses of the
patient, whereas 8% were adult children (n = 14) and 7% were siblings (n = 13).
Procedure. During their comprehensive evaluations at the MAC, patient mental
health and dementia severity were assessed by qualified clinicians. Before their
BPL session, caregivers completed a questionnaire packet at home that contained
a consent form (approved by the UC Berkeley Committee for the Protection of
Human Subjects) and questionnaires measuring caregiver mental and physical
health. About a week later, participants came to the BPL for the assessment of
emotional functioning. Upon arrival, participants were informed that they would
be participating in a study of emotion and that their physiological, behavioral,
and self-reported responses would be recorded and videotaped. After com-
pleting another consent form (approved by the UC Berkeley Committee for the
Protection of Human Subjects), patients and caregivers participated in the lab-
oratory session. There were no follow-up sessions conducted at Berkeley; thus,
the questionnaire packet completed before the laboratory session was the only
time caregiver mental and physical health were assessed. Study materials and
associated protocols are available upon request from the corresponding author.
Measures.
Patient mortality. Patients typically completed annual follow-up appointments
at the MAC to monitor their disease severity and receive updated treatment
plans. If patients were unable to return in person, updates were provided
over the telephone. When we learned that a patient had died, the date of
death was acquired. Mortality data were not available for caregivers. Be-
tween the beginning of the study (January 2007) and the cutoff date used for
the present analyses (May 1, 2016), 98 deaths occurred (55.7%). For patients
who died, survival time was computed as the number of days between the
date that patients participated in the BPL assessment and the date of death.
For patients who were still alive, censor time was computed as the number of
days between the date of the BPL assessment and the cutoff date (37).
Patient dementia severity. Patients’ dementia severity was assessed using the
Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (38), a clinician-rated scale designed
to examine impairment across six domains: memory, orientation, judgment,
community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. Each domain was rated
on a 5-point scale: 0 = no impairment, 0.5 = questionable impairment, 1 = mild
impairment, 2 = moderate impairment, and 3 = severe impairment. Each domain
score was then summed to obtain Sum of Boxes scores. Scores range from 0 to 18,
with higher scores indicating greater impairment.
Patient mental health symptoms. Trained clinicians conducted semistructured
interviews with caregivers using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (39) to
assess patients’ behavioral and emotional symptoms. The NPI is designed to
examine 12 domains: delusions, hallucinations, depression, anxiety, agitation/
aggression, euphoria, disinhibition, irritability/lability, apathy, aberrant motor
activity, sleep disturbances, and eating disorders. For each domain, frequency
(1 = occasionally, less than once per week, to 4 = very frequently, once or more
per day or continuously) and severity (1 = mild, to 3 = severe) were rated, and
the total score for that domain was computed by multiplying frequency by
severity. An overall score was computed by summing scores across the 12 do-
mains. This overall score could range from 0 to 144, with higher scores indicating
greater behavioral and emotional impairments.
Caregiver mental health symptoms. Familial caregivers of patients with neuro-
degenerative disease completed two measures of their own mental health
symptoms, the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Survey (SF-36) (40), and the
Symptom Checklist-90 Revised (SCL-90R) (41). The SF-36 is a 36-item self-report
measure designed to assess eight domains: physical functioning, role limitations
due to physical health, energy/fatigue, pain, general health problems, role lim-
itations due to emotional problems, emotional well-being, and social function-
ing. Scores for each of these domains range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).
According to convention, summed scores from each of the eight domains were z
scored and then weighted to create a composite measure of mental health such
that mental health subscales were weighted more heavily (42). Composite scores
were then multiplied by −1 so that higher scores indicated worse caregiver
mental health symptoms. The SCL-90R is a 90-item questionnaire designed to
assess symptoms of mental health in nine domains: depression, anxiety,
hostility, somatization, obsessive-compulsivity, interpersonal sensitivity,
phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism. Each item was rated on
a 5-point scale of distress (0 = not at all, to 4 = extremely) The SCL-90R
Global Severity Index score is the mean score of all items, with higher
scores indicating greater overall psychological distress.
Caregiver physical illness symptoms. Caregiver physical illness was assessed using
the SF-36, described above. According to convention, summed scores from
each of the eight domains measured by the SF-36 (see above) were z scored
and weighted to create a composite measure of physical health (such that
physical health subscales were weighted more heavily).
Results
Data Analytic Approach. Cox proportional hazard models were used
to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and survival curves for patient
mortality. Analyses proceeded in three steps. First, we tested
whether patient variables (i.e., diagnosis, sex, age, dementia sever-
ity, patient mental health) predicted patient mortality (model 1).
Because diagnosis was a multilevel categorical variable, all di-
agnoses were dummy-coded (0 = absent; 1 = present): bvFTD,
nfvPPA, svPPA, AD, and CBS. PSP was set as the reference group
because patients with neurodegenerative diseases that affect
movement and autonomic nervous centers (e.g., PSP), generally do
not live as long as those with diseases that impact higher-order
abilities such as cognition and emotion (e.g., AD and bvFTD)
(43). All other variables were entered as continuous variables.
Second, we tested whether caregiver mental health symptoms pre-
dicted patient mortality (model 2). To examine the robustness of
these findings, we replicated these analyses using the two measures
of caregiver mental health symptoms: the SF-36 (40) and the SCL-
90R (41). Third, we tested whether caregiver mental health symp-
toms uniquely predicted patient mortality by including patient

 variables (i.e., diagnosis, sex, age, dementia severity, mental
health) and caregiver variables (i.e., mental and physical health
symptoms) as simultaneous predictors of patient mortality
(model 3). See Supporting Information for more information
about all measures.
Patient Variables and Patient Mortality. As depicted in Table 2
(model 1), when testing whether patient variables (i.e., diagnosis,
sex, age, dementia severity, mental health) predicted patients’
mortality, two diagnosis subtypes predicted lower patient mor-
tality relative to the reference group (i.e., patients with PSP): AD
(HR = 0.35, 95% CI [0.167, 0.722], P = 0.005) and svPPA (HR =
0.14, 95% CI [0.054, 0.356], P < 0.001). Patient mental health
symptoms predicted greater patient mortality (HR = 1.01, 95%
CI [1.000, 1.019], P = 0.047). Patient sex, age, and dementia
severity were not significant predictors of patient mortality
(values of P > 0.504).
Caregiver Mental Health Symptoms and Patient Mortality. As
depicted in Table 2 (model 2), worse caregiver mental health (as
measured by elevated SF-36 symptom scores) was associated
with greater patient mortality (HR = 1.47, 95% CI [1.225, 1.763],
P < 0.001). To examine the robustness of these findings, we rep-
licated these analyses with the second measure of caregiver mental
health symptoms (SCL-90R). Results again indicated that worse
caregiver mental health was associated with greater patient mor-
tality (HR = 1.87, 95% CI [1.215, 2.871], P = 0.004).
Unique Association Between Caregiver Mental Health Symptoms and
Patient Mortality. To examine the extent to which caregiver
mental health uniquely predicted patient mortality, we included
all patient variables (i.e., diagnosis, sex, age, dementia severity,
patient mental health) as well as caregiver mental and physical
health symptoms as simultaneous predictors in our model. As
depicted in Table 2 (model 3), results revealed that caregiver

PSYCHOLOGICAL AND
COGNITIVE SCIENCES
 mental health symptoms (measured with the SF-36) remained a
significant predictor of patient mortality (HR = 1.49, 95% CI
[1.210, 1.822], P < 0.001). This HR indicates that patient mor-
tality was 1.49 times higher for each SD increase in caregiver
mental health symptoms (see Fig. 1 for survival curves). This
result also replicated when caregiver mental health was mea-
sured with the SCL-90R (HR = 1.60, 95% CI [1.011, 2.542], P =
0.045). These findings indicate that worse caregiver mental
health is a unique predictor of patient mortality even when
accounting for patient variables and caregiver physical health.
Discussion
The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases is alarmingly high
and is expected to increase with the growing aging population
(44). Paralleling this rise in the number of patients is an increase
in the number of caregivers who will be needed to provide critical
assistance to patients across a broad range of areas. The present
study aimed to understand the role that caregiver and patient
factors play in patient mortality.
As expected, a number of aspects of patients’ disease (i.e.,
diagnosis and mental health) predicted greater patient mortality.
Results also revealed that low levels of caregiver mental health
uniquely predicted greater patient mortality even when account-
ing for a number of risk factors in patients (i.e., diagnosis, sex,
age, dementia severity, mental health) and other caregiver fac-
tors (i.e., caregiver physical health).
This finding raises the question of how poor caregiver mental
health impacts patient mortality. Prior research has shown that
lower caregiver mental health is associated with lower quality of
care (6), which could in turn contribute to patient mortality in a
number of ways (e.g., less awareness of patient health changes,
poorer medication compliance, missing medical appointments).
Lower caregiver mental health could also weaken the quality
of the caregiver–patient relationship: damaged social bonds
between relationship partners are known to predict worse health
outcomes, even extending to risk for mortality (21). Finally,
lower caregiver mental health could impact patient mental
health through contagion of emotions (especially negative
emotions such as anger, fear, and sadness) or behavioral mimicry
given that close others tend to share and reciprocate emotional
experiences, expressions, and even physiological responses (23–26).
Providing the best possible care for the large and growing
number of individuals with neurodegenerative disease is an im-
portant public health priority. Our findings suggest that these
efforts should consider caregiver mental health as an important
intervention target: In addition to the obvious benefits for
caregivers, there could be benefits for patient longevity as well.
Fortunately, there are a number of pharmacological and psy-
chosocial interventions that are useful for treating depression,
anxiety, and other mental health problems (e.g., cognitive be-
havioral therapy) (45, 46) in caregivers. Close monitoring of the
mental health of caregivers of patients with neurodegenerative
disease could lead to early interventions that would have maxi-
mal benefits for caregivers and for the patients in their care.
Strengths and Limitations. The research has several notable
strengths. First, we examined a relatively large and well-powered
sample of patients with multiple forms of neurodegenerative dis-
ease. The diagnoses of neurodegenerative disease were established
using rigorous assessments that included neurological testing, neu-
ropsychological testing, and structural neuroimaging to maximize
diagnostic accuracy. This kind of sample provides greater confi-
dence in the results and their generalizability across different forms
of neurodegenerative disease, compared with prior investigations
with small sample sizes and just one or two forms of neurodegen-
erative disease. Second, we used gold-standard measurements of
both patient and caregiver variables to examine how both types of
factors impact patient mortality. Prior research has rarely exam-
ined caregiver factors in addition to patient factors when ex-
amining patient health or mortality. Finally, we used multiple
measures of caregiver mental health to ensure that the influ-
ence of caregiver mental health on patient mortality was robust.
The present study also has limitations that can be addressed
with future research. First, it was not designed to test the
mechanisms that link caregiver mental health with patient mortality.
As discussed above, several mechanisms are possible, and future
research that carefully assesses these mechanisms over time would
help establish their possible mediating role in patient mortality.
Although we have noted the causal role that caregiver mental health
may have upon patient mortality, the inverse may also be true. That
is, worse mental health in patients—which would likely hasten pa-
tient mortality—could promote worse caregiver mental health. The
present study helps to rule out this alternative directionality by ac-
counting for patient mental health, but this finding would be bol-
stered by future studies that assess patient health, caregiver health,
and possible mediating mechanisms at multiple assessment points
across time. Knowledge of these mechanisms would be extremely
useful in designing experimental tests of the influence of caregiver
mental health on patient mortality, and in planning clinical inter-
ventions to improve the lives of caregivers and patients.
Second, future research would benefit from considering pos-
sible moderators of the link between caregiver mental health and
patient mortality. For example, the nature of the caregiver’s
relationship to the patient (e.g., spouse, child, sibling), or the
availability of other family resources (e.g., social support), may
influence how caregivers respond to the stress of caregiving and
thus may influence the strength of the link between caregiver
mental health and patient mortality. In future studies it would
also be useful to examine other potential moderating influences
(e.g., ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and education) to de-
termine whether they increase or decrease patient vulnerability
to lower caregiver mental health.
Third, future research would benefit from a more compre-
hensive assessment of patients’ mental health to understand its
possible role in patient mortality. In the present study, we used a
well-validated (39) and widely used (47, 48) measure of patient

 mental health based on clinician ratings of caregiver reports;
however, examining patients’ own experiences—in addition to
informant ratings of mental health—may provide important
additional information on the role of patient mental health and
patient insight in patient mortality.
Fourth, the sample of patients included in the present study
was somewhat different from a sample that might be found in a
typical memory clinic. For example, our sample of patients with
AD was younger than average (mean age, 61.7 y) and more
balanced in the proportion of male to female patients (49%
males). This balance across genders is consistent with prior
research suggesting that gender differences in AD typically do
not emerge until participants are older than 85 y (49). Our
sample also included patients with less common neurodegen-
erative disease subtypes (e.g., svPPA, CBS), which helped us
determine whether our findings were consistent across di-
agnostic subtypes. For these reasons, it will be important for
future research to replicate the present results using samples
that more closely reflect the demographics observed in typical
memory clinics.
Finally, it is important to note that living longer does not
necessarily guarantee high quality of life. Although we did not
directly measure patients’ quality of life, we did assess their
mental health—a crucial ingredient in quality of life (50). In our
sample, better mental health in caregivers was associated with
better mental health in patients (r = 0.29, P < 0.001). However,
we do not know whether this association between caregiver
mental health and patient mental health remains stable over
time. If it does, then the period of longer life in patients that was
predicted by better caregiver mental health might be of good
quality. This important issue can best be studied using longitu-
dinal designs and more comprehensive assessments of patient
quality of life. If this finding proves durable, it would further
underscore the importance of determining whether interventions
that aim to improve caregiver mental health also improve both
the longevity and quality of life of patients with neurodegener-
ative disease. Tracking caregivers over time would also provide
the opportunity to examine how caregiver mortality influences
patient mortality.
Conclusion. Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people
worldwide, and the numbers are rapidly growing. Unfortunately,
cures have been elusive and current treatments are only mildly
effective, leading many patients to become highly reliant on their
caregivers. Caregiving for an individual with a neurodegenerative
disease is an extremely challenging experience. The burden and
stresses of caregiving create heightened risk for poor caregiver
mental health, which contributes to greater mortality among
patients. These findings thus highlight the importance of caring
for caregivers (in addition to patients) when attempting to im-
prove patients’ lives.
