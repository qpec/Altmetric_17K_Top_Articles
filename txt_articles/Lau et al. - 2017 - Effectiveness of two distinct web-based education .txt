Abstract
Background
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common cause of preventable harm in hospitalized
patients. While numerous successful interventions have been implemented to improve pre-
scription of VTE prophylaxis, a substantial proportion of doses of prescribed preventive
medications are not administered to hospitalized patients. The purpose of this trial was to
evaluate the effectiveness of nurse education on medication administration practice.
Methods
This was a double-blinded, cluster randomized trial in 21 medical or surgical floors of 933
nurses at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, an academic medical center, from April 1, 2014 –
March 31, 2015. Nurses were cluster-randomized by hospital floor to receive either a linear
static education (Static) module with voiceover or an interactive learner-centric dynamic
scenario-based education (Dynamic) module. The primary and secondary outcomes were

Data Availability Statement: Data are available
from the Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Data
Trust for researchers who meet the criteria for
access to confidential data. The dataset in question
contains protected health information, which by
nature of the study cannot be de-identified. For the
purpose of this study, identifiable information
included patient identifiers, nurse identifiers, dates
of hospitalization, dates/times of medication
administration, hospital location which are all
 non-administration of prescribed VTE prophylaxis medication and nurse-reported satisfac-
tion with education modules, respectively.
Results
Overall, non-administration improved significantly following education (12.4% vs. 11.1%,
conditional OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.80–0.95, p = 0.002) achieving our primary objective. The
reduction in non-administration was greater for those randomized to the Dynamic arm
(10.8% vs. 9.2%, conditional OR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.72–0.95) versus the Static arm (14.5% vs.
13.5%, conditional OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.81–1.03), although the difference between arms
was not statistically significant (p = 0.26). Satisfaction scores were significantly higher
(p<0.05) for all survey items for nurses in the Dynamic arm.
Conclusions
Education for nurses significantly improves medication administration practice. Dynamic
learner-centered education is more effective at engaging nurses. These findings suggest
that education should be tailored to the learner.

Introduction
Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprised of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmo-
nary embolism (PE), affects 350,000–600,000 individuals in the United States annually. More
than 100,000 people die each year in the United States as a result of PE–more than from breast
cancer, AIDS, and motor vehicle collisions combined.[1] Despite the availability of effective
prophylaxis against VTE,[2] numerous studies have shown that VTE prophylaxis is vastly
underutilized in hospitals[3,4] and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)
has listed strategies to improve VTE prevention on its top ten list for patient safety practices.
[5–8] Consequently, numerous interventions have been implemented to improve prescription
of VTE prophylaxis[8–11] with the implicit assumption that medications prescribed for hospi-
talized patients will always be administered. Few studies have focused on nurses, patients, and
the administration of prescribed VTE prophylaxis.[12,13]
Studies from multiple hospitals have shown that 10–12% of prescribed doses of pharmaco-
logic VTE prophylaxis are not administered to hospitalized patients and that the most fre-
quently documented reason for non-administration is patient refusal.[14,15] While patients
have the right to refuse any type of care, it is the responsibility of healthcare providers to edu-
cate patients so that they can make informed decisions. However, some nurses unilaterally
make clinical decisions regarding the appropriateness of prescribed pharmacological VTE pro-
phylaxis and/or allow patients to make uninformed decisions to refuse prophylaxis without
educating patients about the harms of VTE or benefits of VTE prophylaxis.[16]
Recent evidence has suggested that missing doses of prescribed pharmacologic VTE pro-
phylaxis is associated with the development of VTE in hospitalized patients.[17,18] As part of a
multifaceted approach to directly address missed doses of prophylaxis and decrease prevent-
able harm from VTE, we targeted nurses with education. We conducted a cluster randomized

 clinical trial of two web-based modules to educate nurses about the harms of VTE, benefits of

mary aim was to determine the effectiveness of nurse education to reduce non-administration
of prescribed doses of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized medical and surgical
patients. Our secondary aims were to assess the differential effect of different educational
approaches and nurse perceptions about educational strategies and dose refusal as well as
other reasons for non-administration of prescribed VTE prophylaxis medication.
Materials and methods
Trial design
This double-blinded, cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted at the Johns Hopkins
Hospital, an academic medical center in Baltimore, Maryland from April 1, 2014 –March 31,
2015. We included 21 adult inpatient floors comprised of internal medicine floors (n = 11) and
surgery floors (n = 10). The Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review Board approved the
study (IRB00043860), a waiver of consent was provided, and the trial was registered on Clini-
calTrials.gov (“Educating Nurses About Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Prevention”
NCT02301793).
Educational interventions
In partnership with the Johns Hopkins Central Nursing Education, we built two Web-based
educational modules about VTE prevention. One arm provided linear static education (Static)
using PowerPoint slides with voiceover to cover the concepts. The other arm provided in-
teractive learner-centric dynamic scenario-based education (Dynamic), where each scenario
resulted in either positive reinforcement or corrective feedback with an opportunity to apply
knowledge to a new scenario. Both education modules were computer-based containing the
same general concepts about VTE prevention practices, including harms associated with
VTE, incidence of VTE, and best-practices regarding communicating the importance of VTE
prophylaxis and how to administer VTE prophylaxis. Additionally, each module took approxi-
mately the same amount of time to complete, though no time limit was imposed after initiativ-
ing the education module.
Sample size
Based on an intervention to educate every hospitalized patient about the harms of VTE and
benefits of VTE prophylaxis, Piazza et al found a reduction in nonadministration from 10.1%
to 5.6% or a 45% reduction in nonadministration.[12] Assuming 45 to 50% relative reduction
in non-administration in the intervention group, the effect size in form of the odds ratio is
between 0.43 and 0.47. We will have at least 80% power to detect a 60% reduction in odds of
missed dose at 0.05 level of statistical significance.
Enrollment and randomization
Nurses were identified using our centralized education directory that associates nurses with
their designated departments and hospital floors. Beginning on July 23, 2014, nurses were
cluster randomized by floor to receive one of two education modules about VTE prevention.
Nurses were asked to complete their assigned education module by October 23, 2014. All
nurses associated with one of the 21 adult inpatient floors were eligible for enrollment in the
trial. Nurses who were not permanently associated with one of the 21 hospital floors (e.g. trav-
eling nurse, float nurse) were excluded from this study. Because of known differences between

 medical and surgical floors in VTE prophylaxis administration practice and culture,[14,16,19–
21] floors were stratified by department (i.e. medicine and surgery) for randomization. Within
strata, a coin toss (ERH) was used to randomize floors into either the Dynamic education arm
or the Static education arm. Based on the outcome of the coin toss, nurses were then remotely
assigned the online education module by an institutional nurse educator (DLS). The assigned
educational module then appeared in the nurse’s list of education assignments for completion
within the institutional Learning Management System. Nurses are required to complete clini-
cally relevant education regularly as part of ongoing professional practice and a waiver of con-
sent was provided by the IRB; therefore nurses were not aware of their participation in a trial
nor were they aware that two education modules existed. Additionally, the VTE prophylaxis
medication non-administration dataset provided to the biostatistical team (i.e. outcomes asses-
sors) for analysis was blinded by treatment arm and department.
Data collection
Patient demographic data were extracted from the Johns Hopkins Hospital administrative
database. Pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis medication administration data were extracted
directly from electronic medication administration record in our computerized provider
order entry system. Data were collected for one year and divided into three distinct time peri-
ods: April 1 –July 22, 2014 (Baseline); July 23, 2014 –October 23, 2014 (Education Interven-
tion); October 24, 2014 –March 31, 2015 (Post-Education). Immediately following completion
of the assigned education module, nurses were asked to complete a voluntary 5-question sur-
vey to assess the relevance of and satisfaction with the education module.
Statistical analysis
Our primary outcome was the proportion of prescribed pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis
doses not administered. Secondary outcomes included nurses satisfaction and the reason for
non-administration (i.e. patient refusal vs other). The hypothesis comparing the different edu-
cational arms was evaluated using an intention-to-treat approach (i.e. all nurses were included
regardless of training completion) accounting for clustering in the data and comparing rates of
VTE prophylaxis dose non-administration at baseline and during the Post-Education period.
Two per-protocol sensitivity analyses were performed. The first compared the Baseline vs.
Post-Education periods for those nurses who had received training. The second, which was
also limited to those nurses who completed training, allocated visits (including those during
the training period) to the Pre- vs. Post-Education periods based upon the training date for
each individual nurse.
Our biostatistician team (GY, JW, EAS) were blinded to the intervention arm assignment
and department strata. Patient visit-level demographic characteristics for the Baseline period
were described by arm. The changes in pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis administration prac-
tices between the Baseline and Post-Intervention periods were compared overall and between
the two education arms using generalized linear mixed-effects models with a logistic regression
model and random intercepts for floor and nurse to account for the intragroup correlation
within the same floor or within the same nurse. Due to the complexity of the multilevel struc-
ture of the data (i.e. multiple doses per patient across various hospitalizations, nurses and
floors), multiple outputation[22] was employed to reduce the levels of hierarchical structure to
the floor level and nurse level by randomly selecting one dosage per patient. By reiterating the
procedure 1000 times, we estimated the odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals
conditional on the floor and nurse. The reported p-values are also derived from this procedure.
A test of interaction was used to interpret the comparison of reported outcomes between the

 two intervention arms. Responses to the follow-up survey to assess nurse perception with the
education modules were analyzed using a two-sided Chi-squared test. All statistical tests were
conducted at 5% statistical significance. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version
14.1 MP (College Station, Texas 77845). The Stata.do file (S3 File) and the.log files (S4 File) are
included as Supporting Information.
Results
Among the 21 hospital floors included in this study, 11 floors (6 medicine and 5 surgery) were
randomized to the Dynamic arm and 10 floors (5 medicine and 5 surgery) were randomized
to the Static arm. Out of 977 nurses identified as being potentially eligible for inclusion using
our centralized education directory, 933 (95.5%) were determined to be actively employed by
The Johns Hopkins Hospital and associated with the study floors (Fig 1). By the end of the
education trial period, 396/445 (89.0%) nurses who were assigned had completed the Static
module and 405/488 (83.0%) nurses who were assigned had completed the Dynamic module.
During the entire study period, 214,478 doses of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis were pre-
scribed to patients on the 21 hospital floors. During the Baseline period, there were 2,722
patient visits in the Dynamic arm and 2,603 patient visits in the Static arm. The baseline
patient demographics are listed in Table 1. Before the trial began, non-administration ranged
by floor from 3.2% to 32.7%. After the trial was completed, non-administration by floor ranged
from from 3.7% to 35.2%.
VTE prophylaxis non-administration analyses
Overall, non-administration of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis improved significantly fol-
lowing the education in the trial (12.4% vs. 11.1%, conditional odds ratio [cOR]: 0.87, 95% CI:
0.80–0.95, p = 0.002, Table 2) achieving our primary objective. The magnitude of the reduction
in non-administration was slightly greater in the the Dynamic arm following education (10.8%

 vs. 9.2%, cOR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.72–0.95) compared with the Static arm (14.5% vs. 13.5%, cOR:
0.92, 95% CI: 0.81–1.03), although the difference between intervention arms was not statisti-
cally significant (p = 0.26). These findings were similar when limiting the analyses to nurses
who completed the education and comparing both before and after the trial period and before
and after the date when individual nurses completed their assigned training (Table 2).
There was no change in the proportion of prescribed doses that were documented as re-
fused by patients or family members overall (cOR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.81, 1.02, p = 0.113, Table 3)
in either the Dynamic arm (5.6% vs. 5.1%, cOR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.75–1.04) or the Static arm
(7.3% vs. 7.0%, cOR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.81–1.10). Overall, non-administration for other reasons
(i.e. patient off the floor, dose held for planned invasive procedure, etc.) was significantly
lower after the education trial (4.1% vs. 3.4%, cOR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.73–0.92, p<0.001). The
magnitude of the reduction in non-administration for other reasons was slightly greater in the
Dynamic arm (3.4% vs. 2.6%, cOR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60–0.88) compared with in the Static arm
(5.0% vs. 4.4%, cOR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.76–1.04, Table 3), although there was no statistically sig-
nificant difference between intervention arms (p = 0.151).
Nurse perceptions survey
Overall 580/801 (72.4%) of nurses, including 245/396 (61.9%) who completed the Static mod-
ule and 335/405 (82.7%) who completed the Dynamic module responded to the voluntary fol-
low-up survey. Scores were significantly higher in the Dynamic arm for all questions asked.
Compared with nurses who completed the Static module, significantly more nurses reported
that the Dynamic module was engaging (80.9% vs. 58.8%, p = 0.005), was enjoyable (78.1% vs.
67.8%, p = 0.005), helped to better communicate the importance of VTE to patients (88.8% vs.
82.0%, p = 0.020), provided the right level of information and resources (90.3% vs. 78.8%,
p<0.001), and directly applied to their clinical practice (94.0% vs. 89.0%, p = 0.028, Fig 2).
Discussion
Overall nurse education reduced the frequency of VTE prophylaxis non-administration. This
effect was driven by reductions in non-administration due to causes other than patient or

 significant greater reduction in non-administration, the magnitude of improvement was
slightly greater for the Dynamic module. These findings indicate that interactive, learner-cen-
tric education might be most appropriate to change practice and should be futher applied to
other domains of clinical education.
This is the first study to rigorously study the comparative effectiveness of different nurse
education approaches on clinical practices. A systematic review of interventions to improve
VTE prevention practices reported that education strategies alone are not sufficient to drive
and sustain change.[23] However, education is a necessary component of any successful inter-
vention and our findings help to identify a strategy to effectively engage nurses in clinically rel-
evant educational content on specific topics for delivery of high-quality care. Interventions to
improve prescription of appropriate VTE prophylaxis in hospitals have been wildly successful
at doing just that[24–28] and are promoted by AHRQ as one of the top ten most important
patient safety practices.[5–8] However, improving prescription is only one step in a multi-step
process to ensure defect-free VTE prevention; medication doses prescribed must be adminis-
tered.[18]
This is not the first study to attempt to improve administration of prescribed VTE prophy-
laxis among hospitalized patients. One study at a large academic medical center relied on a
clinical pharmacist engaging all patients prescribed pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis in an
individualized education session. The investigators found that non-administration improved
from 10.1% to 5.6%, though this intervention required one hour of a pharmacist’s time per
patient, which is not sustainable.[12] Another study implemented a three-step approach to
improve VTE prophylaxis administration that included a standardized nurses’ response to
patient refusal of VTE prophylaxis, integration of daily assessment of VTE prophylaxis into a
multidisciplinary rounds checklist, and frequent audit and feedback of unit performance. In
this study, non-administration of prescribed VTE prophylaxis decreased from 24.7% to 14.7%.
[13] While our study showed a more modest change in VTE prophylaxis medication non-
administration, the burden of implementation and completion was also markedly lower.
While education is an essential component for quality improvement interventions, education
alone is not enough to elcit and sustain change. Future quality improvement efforts should
include engaging education combined with more intensive, active interventions. Studies
focused on giving individual physicians feedback about their prescribing habits have shown

 marked improvement in practice.[29–32] It is reasonable to believe that providing nurses with
feedback about their administration practices would have a similar improvement on practice
habits. This is the first study to specifically identify individual nurse data for medication ad-
ministration, the first step towards being able to provide individualized feedback to nurses.
Additionally, because no signficiant difference in patient or family member refusal was ob-
served, it is possible that more intensive education should be provided to patients to ensure
that they are empowered to make informed decisions about their care.[33]
This study had several strengths. We chose a clearly defined clinically-relevant outcome
(i.e. dose non-administration) that was directly attributable to individual nurses before and
after completion of the assigned education module. The education modules were relatively
inexpensive and easily implemented using our hospital-wide learning management system.
The interventions were effectively deployed and all relevant data were captured, including a
high survey response rate from the nursing staff in both arms. Nurses, outcome assessors, and
biostatisticians were blinded to minimize bias. In the Dynamic arm there was a particularly
high response rate to the voluntary follow-up survey, suggesting that nurses desire more inter-
active and engaging education than what is provided by traditional linear static education
using PowerPoint slides with voiceover.
There were some limitations to this study. First, although randomized, baseline perfor-
mance was better among nurses in the Dynamic arm of the study compared with nurses in
the Static arm. Despite this difference at baseline, a slightly greater magnitude of effect was
observed among nurses who were assigned to the Dynamic arm although it was not statistically
significant. Second, this trial was conducted in a single center potentially limiting the gener-
alizability of our findings. Nonetheless, this is the first randomized study of which we are
aware that compares the effectiveness of differing educational approaches for bedside nurses
and illustrates important information about how nurses respond to education. Third, we did
not explore differences associated with education by specific clinical department (e.g. medical
vs. surgical nurses) in the current study as it was too small to detect such high order interac-
tions. It is possible that differences in response to education between medical and surgical
nurses may be due to the difference in perceived importance of VTE prophylaxis between
medical and surgical nurses;[16] however, we stratified floors by clinical department for ran-
domization to ensure similar representation. This would be worth consideration as part of
future dissemination.
Education for nurses significantly improves clinical practice. Our findings suggest that
education should be tailored to the learner rather than applied in a standardized manner.
Dynamic learner-centered education may be more effective at engaging nurses and, when con-
sidering the corpus of evidence including a slightly greater magnitude of reduction in non-
administration, may have the potential to be more effective for improving clinical practice.
The improvement in administration practice was driven by reductions in non-administration
due to causes other than patient or family refusal. Future studies will more accurately demon-
strate improved effectiveness of this educational strategy, and should explore differences in the
effect of education on different populations of learners, the sustainability of educational strate-
gies on practice, and refine the education approach to optimize practice improvement.
