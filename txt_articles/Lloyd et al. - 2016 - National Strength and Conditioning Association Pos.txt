ABSTRACT 
26 
There has recently been a growing interest in long-term athletic development for 
27 
youth. Due to their unique physical, psychological and social differences, children and 
28 
adolescents should engage in appropriately prescribed exercise programs that promote 
29 
physical development to prevent injury and enhance fitness behaviours that can be 
30 
retained later in life. Irrespective of whether a child is involved in organized sport or 
31 
engages in recreational physical activity, there remains a need to adopt a structured, 
32 
logical and evidence-based approach to the long-term development of athleticism. 
33 
This is of particular importance considering the alarmingly high number of youth who 
34 
fail to meet global physical activity recommendations and consequently present with 
35 
negative health profiles. However, appropriate exercise prescription is also crucial for 
36 
those young athletes that are physically underprepared and at risk of overuse injury 
37 
due to high volumes of competition and an absence of preparatory conditioning. 
38 
Whether the child accumulates insufficient or excessive amounts of exercise, or falls 
39 
somewhere between these opposing ends of the spectrum, it is generally accepted that 
40 
the young bodies of modern day youth are often ill-prepared to tolerate the rigors of 
41 
sports or physical activity. All youth should engage in regular physical activity and 
42 
thus should be viewed as ‘athletes’ and afforded the opportunity to enhance 
43 
athleticism in an individualized, holistic and child-centred manner. Due to the 
44 
emerging interest in long-term athletic development, an authorship team was tasked 
45 
on behalf of the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) to critically 
46 
synthesize existing literature and current practices within the field and to compose a 
47 
relevant position statement. This document was subsequently reviewed and formally 
48 
ratified by the NSCA Board of Directors. Figure 1 provides a list of the 10 pillars of 
49 
successful long-term athletic development, which summarize the key 
50 
  
3 
recommendations detailed within the consensus statement. With these pillars in place, 
51 
it is believed that the NSCA can (i) help foster a more unified and holistic approach to 
52 
youth physical development, (ii) promote the benefits of a lifetime of healthy physical 
53 
activity, and (iii) prevent and/or minimize injuries from sports participation for all 
54 
boys and girls.

OPERATIONAL TERMS 
78 
Throughout this manuscript, the following operational terms are defined as:  
79 
• Athleticism is the ability to repeatedly perform a range of movements with 
80 
precision and confidence in a variety of environments, which require 
81 
competent levels of motor skills, strength, power, speed, agility, balance, 
82 
coordination and endurance. 
83 
• The term long-term athletic development refers to the habitual development of 
84 
‘athleticism’ over time to improve health and fitness, enhance physical 
85 
performance, reduce the relative risk of injury, and develop the confidence and 
86 
competence of all youth.  
87 
• The terms youth and young athletes represent both children (up to the 
88 
approximate age of 11 years in girls and 13 years in boys) and adolescents 
89 
(typically including girls aged 12-18 years and boys aged 14-18 years). 
90 
• Growth is the most significant biological activity during the first two decades 
91 
of life and is defined as an increase in the size attained by specific parts of the 
92 
body, or the body as a whole. 
93 
• Maturation is defined as progress toward a mature state and varies in timing, 
94 
tempo and magnitude between different bodily systems. 
95 
• A qualified professional possesses (i) an appropriate understanding of 
96 
pediatric exercise science, exercise prescription, technique evaluation, and 
97 
testing methods, (ii) relevant coaching experience and a strong pedagogical 
98 
background, and (iii) a recognized strength and conditioning qualification, for 
99 
  
5 
example, the Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS®) 
100 
certification.

INTRODUCTION 
103 
In an address at the University of Pennsylvania in 1940, the 32nd President of the 
104 
United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered the adage “we cannot always build the 
105 
future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.” Conceptually, this 
106 
statement is a suitable philosophy for long-term athletic development. Ultimately, it is 
107 
impossible to truly determine whether a child will be involved in elite-level sport or 
108 
simply choose to engage in recreational physical activity later in life; however, it is 
109 
imperative that all children learn how and why various types of physical conditioning 
110 
are important to suitably prepare them for the physical and psychological demands of 
111 
a lifetime of sport and physical activity. While the development of athleticism has 
112 
traditionally been viewed as a goal for aspiring ‘young athletes’, it is crucial that 
113 
strength and conditioning coaches, personal trainers, teachers, parents and medical 
114 
professionals adopt a systematic approach to long-term athletic development for youth 
115 
of all ages, abilities and aspirations (143). 
116 
 
117 
1. Long-term athletic development pathways should accommodate for the highly 
118 
individualized and non-linear nature of the growth and development of youth.  
119 
It is commonly stated that “children are not miniature adults” and due to their 
120 
immature physiological and psychosocial state, they should be prescribed appropriate 
121 
training programs commensurate with their technical ability and stage of development 
122 
(145). Children’s anatomy and physiology differs from that of adolescents, which in 
123 
turn is different from the physiology of adults. Clear differences between children and 
124 
  
6 
adolescents/adults exist in muscle structure (133, 193), size (62, 139), activation 
125 
patterns (61, 62, 198, 259), and function (77, 262). These differences will typically 
126 
predispose children to reduced force-producing or force-attenuating capabilities, 
127 
which will have implications for absolute measures of physical performance and 
128 
relative risk of injury. Additionally, it is clear that children’s metabolic profile is more 
129 
conducive to oxidative metabolism (211) and recovery rates from high-intensity 
130 
exercise are shorter in youth in comparison to adults (212, 250). This suggests that 
131 
aerobic and anaerobic exercise thresholds will likely vary according to the stage of 
132 
development. Combined, these examples underlie the potential age- or maturity-
133 
related effects on differential physiology between youth and adults. Notwithstanding 
134 
other age-related and/or maturity-related differences in physiology (e.g. skeletal, 
135 
cardiovascular, respiratory or endocrine systems), practitioners must be cognizant of 
136 
the fact that these systems will develop during childhood and adolescence at different 
137 
rates and in a non-linear manner (157). This variance in physical development is most 
138 
notable when comparing a group of children of the same chronological age (23, 145, 
139 
154, 156), whereby individuals of the same chronological age can differ markedly 
140 
with respect to biological maturity (14, 145, 157). Biological maturation reflects the 
141 
process of progressing towards a mature state, and varies in timing and tempo, and 
142 
between different systems within the body (22). Significant inter-individual variance 
143 
exists for the extent (magnitude of change), timing (onset of change) and tempo (rate 
144 
of change) of biological maturation. In addition to these developmental incongruities 
145 
amongst youth, the manner in which they respond to, and recover from, training is 
146 
likely to differ between youth of the same age or maturation status (5, 15, 16, 147, 
147 
219). Indeed, a real challenge for sport and exercise scientists and practitioners 
148 
  
7 
working with youth is to determine whether changes in performance are mediated 
149 
from training-induced or growth-related adaptations.  
150 
 
151 
Effects of sport and physical activity on growth and development 
152 
Physically-active children will typically outperform those that are inactive in most 
153 
indices of physical performance (155). Being inactive is associated with a high 
154 
probability of being overweight or obese during the growing years (179, 253). 
155 
Therefore, physical activity, exercise and sport should be viewed as key preventative 
156 
treatments for unfavourable weight status and an important precursor for healthy 
157 
growth and development (75, 76, 183). There exists a positive relationship between 
158 
motor skill competence and physical activity across childhood (214). Therefore, it is 
159 
essential that all youth are encouraged to enhance athleticism from an early age by 
160 
engaging with multi-faceted training inclusive of a range of different training modes 
161 
(142). Previous misconceptions regarding the impact of physical training on growth 
162 
and development trajectories are not supported with literature, especially as data are 
163 
often correlational and cross-sectional in nature (22, 156). While fears previously 
164 
existed surrounding the effect of physical training on eventual growth of youth 
165 
(especially in sports such as gymnastics), evidence now indicates that well-supervised 
166 
physical training does not impair the development of secondary sex characteristics 
167 
(153), does not delay age at menarche (160) and does not restrict eventual growth 
168 
height (22, 152). Moreover, when rest and training are prescribed systematically, 
169 
moderate-to-high intensity exercise is needed to help bone mineral accrual during 
170 
childhood and adolescence (3, 13, 87, 88, 116, 118, 267), which is of great benefit for 
171 
long-term skeletal health.  
172 
 
173 
  
8 
Owing to the unique physiology of children, it is clear that practitioners working with 
174 
youth require a sound understanding of pediatric exercise science in order to i) 
175 
prescribe training programs that are commensurate with the needs and abilities of the 
176 
individual, ii) distinguish between training-induced and growth-related adaptations in 
177 
performance (either positive or negative), and iii) understand the manner in which 
178 
growth, maturation and training interact to optimize the training response and the 
179 
development of athleticism. 
180 
 
181 
2. Youth of all ages, abilities and aspirations should engage in long-term athletic 
182 
development programs that promote both physical fitness and psychosocial 
183 
wellbeing. 
184 
The development of physical fitness in youth is a complex process, which involves 
185 
the interaction of growth, maturation and training (5, 15, 16, 145, 219, 261). 
186 
Practitioners should appreciate the potential impact that other lifestyle factors will 
187 
have on physical fitness development and physical activity engagement, including 
188 
dietary behaviours (48, 52), educational stress (159), sleep patterns (95, 163), 
189 
psychosocial health (24) and unrealistic external pressures from significant others 
190 
such as parents or coaches (201, 251). Cumulatively, all these factors can impact the 
191 
engagement and enjoyment experienced by youth, adherence rates to training 
192 
programs, and consequently the magnitude and rate of development of physical 
193 
fitness. 
194 
 
195 
Despite many factors impacting the training process of youth, there is often varying 
196 
levels of understanding and a lack of coordinated planning amongst those personnel 
197 
who are responsible for the long-term welfare and well-being of children and 
198 
  
9 
adolescents. With these inconsistent approaches between key personnel in mind, from 
199 
a global perspective two primary corollaries are evident within the pediatric literature. 
200 
Firstly, the number of youth who are physically inactive, overweight or obese and 
201 
demonstrate poor standards of physical fitness, deficient levels of muscular strength 
202 
and inadequate motor skill competency follows an unfavourable trajectory (40, 44, 
203 
53-55, 105, 107, 175, 194, 195, 220, 257). Of note, the term exercise deficit disorder 
204 
(EDD) has been proposed to describe a condition characterized by reduced levels of 
205 
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity that negatively impact the health and well-
206 
being of youth (75, 76). Importantly, children and adolescents who present with 
207 
symptoms or behavioural patterns reflective of EDD should be prescribed exercise 
208 
interventions geared towards the development of fundamental movement skills, 
209 
foundational strength and general athleticism (76). The prevalence of substandard 
210 
athleticism in modern-day youth will likely increase the prevalence of overweight or 
211 
obese youth (114, 115), but also increase the relative risk of injury for inactive youth 
212 
who eventually engage with physical activity or sports (25). Secondly, a growing 
213 
concern for practitioners is the number of youth reporting with sport-related injuries 
214 
as a consequence of over exposure to high volumes of sport-specific 
215 
training/competition in the absence of adequate rest and recovery (120). 
216 
Consequently, there are an increased number of young athletes experiencing non-
217 
functional overreaching, overtraining, burnout and eventual drop out from sport (57, 
218 
162). Young athletes should be encouraged to participate in a variety of activities and 
219 
sports, avoid year-round training for a single sport, and should be carefully monitored 
220 
in a coordinated manner to prevent the risk of non-functional overreaching or 
221 
overtraining. 
222 
 
223 
  
10 
Due to the multifactorial nature of physical fitness development and the current trends 
224 
linked with both insufficient and excessive (specialized) amounts of physical activity, 
225 
a long-term and structured approach to the development of athleticism in youth is 
226 
warranted. Irrespective of the population (e.g. youth, adult, seniors), it is generally 
227 
accepted that a structured training program will produce superior results than 
228 
unstructured training or no training at all (206). Long-term and systematically 
229 
progressed approaches to developing athleticism in youth, delivered by qualified 
230 
professionals, will enable more effective control over training variables, a reduction in 
231 
the risk of overtraining and an enhanced overall adaptation in physiology and 
232 
performance. While a number of authors have previously discussed the role of long-
233 
term athletic development models in developing human performance or sporting 
234 
talent (9, 10, 49, 92, 142, 146), it is vital that practitioners acknowledge that the 
235 
constructs of long-term athletic development are appropriate for youth of all ages and 
236 
abilities (143). While a systematic approach to the development of athleticism is 
237 
required to prepare aspiring young athletes for the demands of sport (69), it is 
238 
imperative that all youth, including those that are inactive, underweight, overweight 
239 
or obese are afforded the same opportunity to engage in dynamic, integrated and 
240 
evidence-based training programs that promote the development of both health and 
241 
skill-related components of fitness (75, 143, 144, 180, 182).    
242 
 
243 
Performance versus participation pathways 
244 
Despite existing models for the long-term development of athleticism providing 
245 
structure and guidance for practitioners, it should be noted that any model should not 
246 
be viewed as a stringent blueprint that can be superimposed on any participant, within 
247 
any environment. Rather, practitioners must ensure that wherever possible, long-term 
248 
  
11 
training programs are tailored to the needs of the individual and within the confines of 
249 
the unique demands of the training environment. This is a pertinent factor owing to 
250 
the highly individualised interaction effects of growth and maturation on the training 
251 
response of youth. Regardless of the model that a child enters, it is imperative that 
252 
they are able to transition between developmental pathways (143). Adolescence offers 
253 
a time in which young athletes are more likely to drop out of competitive sport (85), 
254 
but some individuals will subsequently remain involved in sport or physical activity at 
255 
a recreational level. Similarly, an adolescent may be identified by a sporting 
256 
organization as a talented athlete who has previously only participated in recreational 
257 
physical activities. In either event, the adolescent should be supported from a holistic 
258 
perspective. Physically, they should be prescribed suitable training that prepares them 
259 
for the demands of their sport or physical activity while enabling them to achieve 
260 
recommended exposure to daily physical activity (264). They should also be provided 
261 
with relevant support that encourages the development of a positive sense of self-
262 
worth, self-confidence, motivation and enjoyment to foster a lifetime of engagement 
263 
in sport and physical activity. 
264 
 
265 
3. All youth should be encouraged to enhance physical fitness from early 
266 
childhood, with a primary focus on motor skill and muscular strength 
267 
development. 
268 
Whether a child is engaged with competitive sport or simply participates in 
269 
recreational physical activity, a common philosophy of long-term athletic 
270 
development models is that engagement in physical activity during early childhood is 
271 
vital (143). The developmental time frame of brain maturation is associated with a 
272 
heightened degree of neural plasticity during childhood (37, 38, 181, 215). This stage 
273 
  
12 
of development involves the process of pruning and an overall strengthening of the 
274 
synaptic pathways (148, 237, 238, 241) and provides an opportunity to take advantage 
275 
of the motor skill potential of children. Existing models of long-term athletic 
276 
development indicate that training foci during the initial stages of childhood should be 
277 
based on the acquisition of rudimentary and fundamental motor skills in addition to 
278 
the development of foundational strength (10, 39, 143, 146). While correct execution 
279 
of fundamental motor skills requires coordinated sequencing of multi-muscle, multi-
280 
joint, multi-planar movements, there will always be a requirement for complimentary 
281 
force production and force attenuation. Neuromuscular coordination and force 
282 
production are governed by neural activation and control, and thus it is optimal to 
283 
target the development of motor skills and muscular strength at a time when the 
284 
corticospinal tissue in children is highly ‘plastic’ (188). Practitioners should not view 
285 
coordination and muscular strength as separate entities, but rather synergistic 
286 
components of motor skill performance (39) and should therefore seek to develop 
287 
both qualities during early childhood. While youth should engage in multidimensional 
288 
strength and conditioning programs that use a range of training modes to develop both 
289 
health- and skill-related components of fitness, prioritizing neuromuscular training 
290 
that enhances both muscular strength and motor skill prowess, starting from early 
291 
childhood, is recommended for the long-term physical development of both children 
292 
and adolescents (70, 75, 142).  
293 
 
294 
For the long-term enhancement of athleticism, developing a proficient physical 
295 
“vocabulary” of fundamental motor skills during early childhood should serve as the 
296 
foundations on which more advanced and complex specific motor skills can be later 
297 
developed (134, 142, 188). Specifically, fundamental motor skills encompass the 
298 
  
13 
ability to perform locomotive, manipulative and stabilizing movements (149). 
299 
Complimenting motor skill training with muscular strength development during early 
300 
childhood is crucial as muscle strength is a key determinant of motor skill function 
301 
(70). Muscular strength is strongly associated with a multitude of physical qualities in 
302 
youth, for example speed and power (45). Additionally, enhancing muscular strength 
303 
using resistance training can improve physical performance (15, 108, 141), improve 
304 
markers of health in obese and overweight youth (18, 19, 229-231, 247), and help 
305 
reduce the risk of sports-related injury (172, 180, 190, 256). Thus, a primary aim of 
306 
long-term athletic development programs should be to develop resilient, strong and 
307 
technically proficient youth, who can robustly maintain motor skill competence 
308 
within the demands of any sporting or recreational activity. This philosophy is of 
309 
particular importance considering recent trends in the neuromuscular fitness of youth 
310 
(44, 175, 220). A meta-analytical review of 34 training studies showed that pre- and 
311 
early-pubertal youth achieved resistance training-induced gains in motor skills that 
312 
were approximately 50% greater than adolescents (15), thus highlighting the 
313 
increased trainability of motor skills in children. Aside from the development of 
314 
athleticism, preparatory conditioning inclusive of motor skill and muscular strength 
315 
development provides an appropriate strategy for reducing the relative risk of injury 
316 
for youth during sport and physical activity later in life (69, 80, 111, 112, 190). Motor 
317 
skill competence, and indeed the perception of motor skill competence, is an 
318 
important antecedent of physical activity during childhood (42, 83, 107, 135, 214, 
319 
242) and adulthood (140, 149). Cumulatively, early engagement in developmentally 
320 
appropriate training during childhood is warranted for the optimization of athleticism, 
321 
lifelong health and wellbeing, and the reduction of relative risk of injury. 
322 
 
323 
  
14 
Starting age 
324 
Although there is not a single chronological age at which it is deemed acceptable for 
325 
youth to formally start training, recent guidelines recommended that any child 
326 
engaging in a form of resistance training is emotionally mature enough to accept and 
327 
follow directions and possesses competent levels of balance and postural control 
328 
(approximately 6-7 years of age) (134, 141, 189). However, children should engage 
329 
with exploratory and deliberate play from early childhood (from birth up to the age of 
330 
5-6 years) inclusive of activities designed to develop fundamental motor skills (138) 
331 
and foundational levels of strength (e.g. gymnastics or similar bodyweight 
332 
management activities) (143). If children are ready to engage with organized sports, 
333 
they are ready to participate in developmentally appropriate strength and conditioning 
334 
as part of a long-term approach to developing athleticism (189).  
335 
 
336 
4. Long-term athletic development pathways should encourage an early sport 
337 
sampling approach for youth that promotes and enhances a broad range of 
338 
motor skills 
339 
Sampling refers to an approach that encourages youth to engage in a variety of sports 
340 
or activities and a number of positions within a given sport. Literature has stated that a 
341 
sampling approach does not restrict elite sporting development, but in fact, facilitates 
342 
longer sporting careers and increases the chance of sustained participation in physical 
343 
activity (50). Conversely, early specialization refers to the concept of a child 
344 
participating in year-round intensive training within a single sport or physical activity 
345 
at the exclusion of others (57, 265). Concerns exist regarding the adoption of an early 
346 
specialization approach in youth, largely due to the inherent associations with 
347 
increased risk of injury (36, 78, 79, 104, 119, 120, 187, 192, 235), the potential 
348 
  
15 
‘blunting’ of an individual’s motor skill portfolio (57, 144, 176, 186), a reduced 
349 
standard of performance later in life (28, 84, 96, 174, 268), an increased risk of 
350 
overtraining or dropout from sport or physical activity (4, 35, 151, 187), and the non-
351 
guarantee of achieving elite level performance (28, 101, 174). 
352 
 
353 
Effects of early specialization on physical performance 
354 
Irrespective of the potential risks associated with early sport specialization, both 
355 
children and adolescents are being encouraged to engage earlier with sports often due 
356 
to the lure of a higher standard of performance, for example securing national team 
357 
selection, college scholarships or professional contracts. The assumption that earlier 
358 
specialization will lead to enhanced sports performance has largely been driven by the 
359 
incorrect extrapolation of data examining the development of expert musicians and 
360 
the proposed “10,000 hour rule” (66). The rule denotes that an individual must 
361 
acquire 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to attain mastery in a given sport or 
362 
activity, which could also be viewed as dedicating specific practice to the same sport 
363 
or activity for three hours a day for 10 years. However, in a recent editorial it was 
364 
suggested that their seminal work on expert performers had been misinterpreted and 
365 
that expert performance had been achieved by some with just 5,000 hours of practice 
366 
(65), which is more reflective of the training volumes reported for actual sports 
367 
performers (174). Consequently, practitioners should not subscribe to the hypothetical 
368 
10,000 hour rule, but instead value the quality of practice rather than a specific 
369 
quantity of practice. 
370 
 
371 
The early specialization approach is particularly common when young children 
372 
display innate talent at a young age, leading to significant others (e.g. parents or 
373 
  
16 
coaches) seeking achievement by proxy distortion and going beyond normal ambition 
374 
for success (251). However, while it may be a common view that an accumulation of 
375 
greater volumes and intensities of sport specific practice at a young age will lead to 
376 
sporting success, existing data do not support this notion, with the number of 
377 
individuals transitioning from entry level to elite standard across a range of sports in a 
378 
linear fashion remaining small (101). For sports measured in centimetres, grams or 
379 
seconds (e.g. track and field, swimming or weightlifting), later specialization and 
380 
exposure to lower volumes of specific practice earlier in life are significant 
381 
determinants of elite performance in adulthood (174). Despite potential early 
382 
accomplishments, in general athletes who specialized at an earlier age experienced 
383 
less success as they became older (174). Furthermore, athletes who did achieve elite 
384 
sporting success were found to intensify their training towards the end of adolescence, 
385 
leading to greater volumes of training towards early adulthood. Similarly, adopting a 
386 
sampling approach and investing in multiple sports as opposed to specializing in a 
387 
single sport produced improved performances in gross motor coordination and 
388 
standing broad jump tests in 10-12 year old boys (84). In addition, the analysis of 
389 
retrospective data across a multitude of sports indicates that individuals who 
390 
participated in three sports or more between 11-15 years of age were more likely to 
391 
play national compared with club standard sport between 16-18 years (28). 
392 
 
393 
Effects of early specialization on injury risk 
394 
The risks of overuse injury appear to increase as a result of early specialization due to 
395 
the repetitive sub-maximal loading on the musculoskeletal system in the absence of 
396 
sufficient recovery time for subsequent adaptation (57, 239). For example, data 
397 
showed that from a sample of female youth athletes, those who had specialized at an 
398 
  
17 
earlier age had a 1.5-fold greater risk of knee-related injury (104). The authors also 
399 
reported that diagnoses including patellar tendinopathy and Osgood Schlatter Disease 
400 
exhibited a 4-fold increased relative risk in single sport specialized versus multiple 
401 
sport athletes (104). In a similar study, data on 1,190 individuals showed that after 
402 
accounting for age and time spent playing sport, sports-specialized training was a 
403 
significant independent risk factor for acute and serious overuse injury (120).  
404 
 
405 
The increased training volumes associated with early specialization are a pertinent 
406 
injury risk factor for youth (119). For example, high training volumes and competitive 
407 
workloads are strongly associated with an increased risk of overuse injury in 
408 
adolescent baseball pitchers (200). Additionally, high volumes of weekly running 
409 
mileage are significantly associated with increased risk of lower limb injury in 
410 
adolescent runners (248), while a high training volume was the most influential risk 
411 
factor for injury in a cohort of 2,721 high school athletes across a variety of sports 
412 
(216). Recently, Jayanthi et al. (120) revealed a heightened risk of injury when youth 
413 
participated in more hours of sports practice per week than their number of years in 
414 
age, or whereby the ratio of organized sports to free play time was in excess of 2:1. 
415 
Regardless of age, existing data support the notion that youth should not train in 
416 
excess of eight months per year in a single sport (120, 200), while the weekly training 
417 
volume of 16 hours marks a threshold above which the risk of injury increases (144, 
418 
187).  
419 
 
420 
Overexposure to a narrow range of specific movement patterns with insufficient rest 
421 
and recovery, and an ensuing blunted motor skill portfolio are common links to both 
422 
the reduced physical performance and higher risk of injury associated with early sport 
423 
  
18 
specialization. By exposing youth to different sports and activities and adopting a 
424 
movement variability approach to motor skill development within different 
425 
environments, they are less likely to chronically over stress specific regions of the 
426 
musculoskeletal system, therefore reducing their risk of overuse injury. Adopting a 
427 
movement variability philosophy will ensure that the point of force application will 
428 
constantly vary; thus promoting more global whole-body adaptation, facilitating 
429 
change in coordination, and reducing injury risk (12). With regards to physical 
430 
performance, developing a broad spectrum of fundamental motor skills will enable 
431 
more intricate and reactive global movements that are inherently witnessed in sports, 
432 
physical activity and free play to be developed (149). Qualified professionals should 
433 
focus on developing a wide breadth of movement skills as opposed to a depth of 
434 
mastery in a small range of skills to better enable the individual to produce effective 
435 
and efficient movements in a wide range of environments and to maximize their 
436 
overall athleticism. 
437 
 
438 
5. Health and wellbeing of the child should always be the central tenet of long-
439 
term athletic development programs. 
440 
Health can be defined as “a condition of wellbeing free of disease or infirmity and a 
441 
basic and universal human right” (227). Huppert et al. (117) defined wellbeing as a 
442 
positive and sustainable state that enabled an individual, group or nation to thrive and 
443 
flourish. Participation in sports has been acknowledged as a viable means to promote 
444 
wellbeing in youth (59, 63, 240); however the International Olympic Committee 
445 
stated that while youth should engage with sports, the process should be both 
446 
pleasurable and fulfilling in order to sustain participation and success at all levels (21, 
447 
177). Collectively, these philosophies should apply to all forms of physical activity 
448 
  
19 
for youth, inclusive of well-rounded strength and conditioning programs (69, 196). 
449 
Irrespective of whether a child is involved with competitive sports or recreational 
450 
physical activity, health and wellbeing should at all times be a key priority of any 
451 
long-term athletic training program.  
452 
 
453 
Psychosocial factors in health and wellbeing 
454 
Youth should be exposed to positive experiences through sport and physical activity 
455 
to maximize wellbeing. The primary reason that children initially engage with sport 
456 
and physical activity is for fun, enjoyment and to experience different activities (2). 
457 
Similarly a lack of fun and enjoyment is commonly the main cause of dropout from 
458 
sport (32, 51). To promote wellbeing in youth, practitioners should seek to develop (i) 
459 
a growth mind-set, (ii) self-determined motivation, (iii) perceived competence, (iv) 
460 
confidence and (v) resilience (196). Specifically, a growth mind-set will foster the 
461 
belief that effort, purposeful practice and guidance from qualified professionals will 
462 
lead to development and success; while self-determined motivation reflects a state of 
463 
mind that leads to a child participating in sport or physical activity for its interest, 
464 
enjoyment, inherent satisfaction and sense of challenge (221). Perceived competence 
465 
is an important attribute to develop in youth, as it is strongly associated with 
466 
participation in physical activity (140, 214), especially during adolescence where the 
467 
use of social comparison among youth and the role of peer support becomes more 
468 
influential (30, 222, 223). Confidence is strongly related to reduced anxiety, positive 
469 
emotions and successful performance (260), while resilience is defined as the ability 
470 
of an individual to retain stability or recover quickly under significant adverse 
471 
conditions (137). To enhance wellbeing, qualified professionals should integrate a 
472 
combination of strategies, including the use of mental skill training, process-oriented 
473 
  
20 
goals, clear and positive feedback, while maintaining a fun agenda to all sessions. 
474 
Similarly, qualified professionals should foster a training environment in which 
475 
developmentally appropriate activities are prescribed, encouragement is reinforced 
476 
and whereby task failure is viewed as a positive aspect of the learning process. 
477 
 
478 
Physical factors in health and wellbeing 
479 
Youth should engage with developmentally appropriate, well-rounded strength and 
480 
conditioning programs from an early age that prioritize a long-term view to the 
481 
development of athleticism. Therefore, chronic and sustainable adaptations should be 
482 
the ultimate goal of youth training provision as opposed to acute gains in 
483 
performance. Welfare is closely associated with the basic human rights of the child 
484 
and will aid in the promotion of wellbeing (197). Training should at all times respect 
485 
these rights and be commensurate with the technical competency, training history, and 
486 
stage of growth and development of the child (178). Under no circumstance should 
487 
physical exertion be forced that could be deemed abusive practice within a youth 
488 
training program (129). Examples may include exercise programs which could be 
489 
injurious activities that are not in any way beneficial, or prescription that could be 
490 
viewed as a form of punishment (129). Forced physical exertion, prescribed as a form 
491 
of physical punishment, can have severe physical consequences such as that which led 
492 
to a 12-year old boy being hospitalized with exertional rhabdomyolysis (41); a 
493 
situation that is unethical and entirely unacceptable. Training prescription should be 
494 
balanced with adequate rest to enable recovery and growth processes to occur and to 
495 
avoid the risks of accumulated fatigue and associated risks of overtraining (57, 162). 
496 
 
497 
  
21 
6. Youth should participate in physical conditioning that helps reduce the risk of 
498 
injury to ensure their on-going participation in long-term athletic 
499 
development programs. 
500 
While it is impossible to completely eliminate sport- and physical activity-related 
501 
injuries, developmentally appropriate training can reduce the relative risks of injury in 
502 
youth (21, 74, 109, 141, 190, 217, 236, 245, 256). More specifically, when youth 
503 
participate in well-rounded strength and conditioning programs, inclusive of 
504 
resistance training, motor skill and balance training, speed and agility training and 
505 
appropriate rest, the likelihood of experiencing an injury can be reduced by as much 
506 
as 50% (172, 256). The cause for the reduction in injury incidence, or injury risk 
507 
factors, is likely due to improved movement biomechanics, increased muscle strength 
508 
and enhanced functional abilities (74, 110, 158, 184). From a long-term athletic 
509 
development perspective, it is imperative that youth, and those that are responsible for 
510 
their developmental programming, realize the importance of following strength and 
511 
conditioning programs that suitably prepare them for the demands of sport and 
512 
physical activity. For example, early engagement in neuromuscular training is likely 
513 
to result in a reduced risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury later in life in female 
514 
athletes (190). The authors speculated that this finding was likely attributable to a 
515 
window of opportunity for developing sound motor skills and concomitant strength 
516 
levels prior to the onset of puberty which is known to be a developmental stage where 
517 
youth experience significant alterations in movement biomechanics (81, 113), force 
518 
attenuation capabilities (207) and lower limb strength ratios (208). It should also be 
519 
recognized that sports participation alone does not provide a sufficient stimulus to 
520 
develop high levels of athleticism in youth, as many sporting practices fail to provide 
521 
adequate exposure to recommended daily physical activity guidelines (100, 136), nor 
522 
  
22 
does it allow for individual needs to be addressed such as muscle imbalances or 
523 
reduced ranges of motion (144). 
524 
 
525 
‘Underuse’ as a risk factor for injury 
526 
While an abundance of data now exist that supports the inclusion of preparatory 
527 
conditioning for young athletes (21, 64, 123, 190, 246, 256), the long-term 
528 
development of athleticism must also be viewed as a valuable injury prevention tool 
529 
for non-athletic youth. Physical inactivity is a major risk factor for activity-related 
530 
injuries in children (25, 243) and global statistics indicate that levels of inactivity in 
531 
modern day youth remain worryingly high (191, 252, 254). Intuitively, much like 
532 
young athletes who are often ill prepared for the high volumes of sport-specific 
533 
practice and competitions, inactive youth are also unlikely to be suitably prepared for 
534 
the demands of competitive/recreational sports or even general physical activity. For 
535 
example, overweight and obese youth are twice as likely to suffer an injury during 
536 
sports or recreational physical activity in comparison to their normal weight peers 
537 
(165). Thus, ‘underuse’ is likely the most dangerous risk factor for a number of youth, 
538 
which highlights the critical importance of appropriately designed long-term athletic 
539 
development models. 
540 
 
541 
Influence of growth and maturation on injury risk 
542 
Current data indicate that the risk of injury, in particular to the lower limb, peaks 
543 
around the time of the adolescent growth spurt (33, 58, 113, 185, 258). During this 
544 
period of rapid development, there are disproportionate growth rates between 
545 
structural tissues, with bone growing earlier and at a faster rate than both muscle and 
546 
tendon, which lag behind (130). The growth differential between these tissues can 
547 
  
23 
lead to discomfort and reduced flexibility around joints (130); however, it is the 
548 
marked increase in growth rate during this stage of development which leads to 
549 
increases in body mass and height of centre of mass in the absence of corresponding 
550 
adaptations in strength and power, which can lead to excessive loading of the 
551 
musculoskeletal system during dynamic and reactive actions (111, 130, 185, 258). For 
552 
example, the rapid increases in both stature and body mass in female adolescents 
553 
places them at increased risk of knee injury due to the increased stature developing 
554 
without concomitant increases in hip and knee strength (185). The development of 
555 
muscular imbalances around the pubertal growth spurt is also a viable risk factor, with 
556 
longitudinal data in adolescent females showing that hamstring-to-quadriceps strength 
557 
ratios decrease from pre-pubertal to pubertal stages (208). This muscle imbalance is 
558 
of particular concern as when fatigued, both young and adult females utilize a less 
559 
favourable activation strategy (56, 128, 167, 202), reducing their ability to 
560 
appropriately dissipate aberrant knee loads indicative of an anterior cruciate ligament 
561 
injury mechanism (112, 132). Although mechanistic data are required for young 
562 
males, recently it has been suggested that the adolescent growth spurt is a 
563 
developmental time frame in which the risk of traumatic injury in pubertal males is 
564 
intensified (228, 258). Finally, bone mineralization typically lags behind linear bone 
565 
growth during the pubertal spurt, thus leading to increased bone porosity and 
566 
exposing the bone to a heightened risk of fracture (8). Consequently, irrespective of 
567 
participation in competitive sports or non-competitive recreational physical activity, 
568 
all youth should participate in long-term training programs to promote the level of 
569 
athleticism required to withstand the physical demands associated with their chosen 
570 
activity and to offset growth- and maturity-associated risk factors.     
571 
 
572 
  
24 
7. Long-term athletic development programs should provide all youth with a 
573 
range of training modes to enhance both health- and skill-related components 
574 
of fitness 
575 
Trainability of youth 
576 
Trainability refers to the responsiveness of youth to a given training stimulus at 
577 
various stages of development. As the field of pediatric exercise science continues to 
578 
evolve, practitioners will gain a greater understanding of how responsive youth are to 
579 
different modes of training. Our understanding of trainability typically emanates from 
580 
largely discrete, cross-sectional interventions, and these combined data indicate that 
581 
both children and adolescents can make significant and worthwhile changes in motor 
582 
skills (15, 67, 98), muscle strength and power (16, 68, 141), running speed (121, 219), 
583 
agility (122, 171) and endurance performance (5, 161, 168). Recent data indicates that 
584 
continual exposure to various training methods can benefit both children and 
585 
adolescents (125, 126, 224). Of the longer-term interventions, two years of strength 
586 
training have produced significant improvements in relative lower body strength 
587 
(125); faster change of direction speed (126); and 30 meter sprint speed (224). Despite 
588 
showing the many benefits of strength training on measures of physical performance 
589 
in youth, these studies did not account for the influence of maturation or sex on rate 
590 
and magnitude of change. Thus, the interaction of growth, maturation and training 
591 
during childhood and adolescence remains unclear and warrants further research. 
592 
 
593 
Whereas strong evidence indicates that worthwhile gains in physical performance are 
594 
achieved with strength and motor skill developmental models, limited evidence is 
595 
available relative to the mode of exercise that should be prioritized at specific stages 
596 
of development. Previous models of long-term athletic development have promoted 
597 
  
25 
the theory of ‘windows of opportunity’ that provide youth with specific time periods 
598 
in which to train specific components of fitness (10), and failure to train specifically 
599 
during these windows limiting performance capacity later in life (10). While this 
600 
theory attempted to bridge our understanding of growth, maturation and training, this 
601 
concept has since been challenged largely owing to a lack of supporting longitudinal 
602 
empirical data (82). Combined with existing pediatric training literature, it becomes 
603 
clear that both children and adolescents can make worthwhile improvements in all 
604 
components of fitness irrespective of their stage of development (69, 70, 142, 143), 
605 
and consequently long-term training programs should seek to develop athleticism 
606 
throughout the developmental period of childhood and adolescence.  
607 
 
608 
While both children and adolescents can make significant improvements in various 
609 
physical fitness qualities (e.g. strength, motor skills, speed and power), the most 
610 
efficacious training modes used to acquire these adaptations may complement the 
611 
physiological adaptations occurring as a result of growth and maturation, a process 
612 
recently termed ‘synergistic adaptation’ (69, 147). Specifically, a meta-analysis 
613 
examining the effects of different training methods on sprint speed development in 
614 
male youth showed that boys who were pre-peak height velocity made the greatest 
615 
improvements in sprinting following plyometric training, while boys who were post-
616 
peak height velocity responded more favorably to combined strength and plyometric 
617 
training (219). Similar findings were recently reported in a 6-week training 
618 
intervention that showed boys who were either pre- or post-peak height velocity were 
619 
all able to make significant improvements in jumping and sprinting following various 
620 
6-week resistance training programs (147). Plyometric training will promote similar 
621 
neural adaptations that are occurring naturally as a result of growth and maturation 
622 
  
26 
prior to puberty, while combined strength and plyometric training will likely stimulate 
623 
both neural and structural adaptations commonly seen after the pubertal growth spurt. 
624 
Longitudinal research is now required to substantiate these claims of synergistic 
625 
adaptation and to determine optimal training prescription for youth of different stages 
626 
of development. 
627 
 
628 
8. Practitioners should use relevant monitoring and assessment tools as part of a 
629 
long-term athletic development strategy 
630 
For the welfare and wellbeing of youth, long-term training prescription should be 
631 
complimented with appropriate monitoring and assessment tools. In the absence of 
632 
careful monitoring, youth may be at an increased risk of excessively demanding 
633 
training loads, insufficient opportunities for rest and regeneration, or contraindicating 
634 
training methods (144). It is suggested that the training of youth should be monitored 
635 
by qualified professionals to reduce the risks of excessive training (4, 57, 177) and 
636 
accumulated fatigue (106), which in severe cases can lead to non-functional 
637 
overreaching or overtraining (127, 144, 162, 210). Those personnel responsible for 
638 
the athletic development of youth should adopt a co-ordinated approach to the 
639 
monitoring process. Wherever possible, qualified professionals should also attempt to 
640 
educate the child and their parents and raise awareness of the risks and symptoms of 
641 
non-functional overreaching and related injuries or illnesses. The child and parents 
642 
should also understand the roles of basic self-reporting monitoring strategies (sleep 
643 
patterns, nutritional behaviour, physical activity exposure outside of the training 
644 
environment) and the potential impact of appropriate remedial strategies. 
645 
 
646 
  
27 
Qualified professionals will typically use monitoring and assessment tools to 
647 
determine training for effectiveness, to aid in program design, determining 
648 
mechanisms of adaptation, to instill motivation within the child or adolescent, or to 
649 
further knowledge and understanding about the physiological demands of a sport or 
650 
physical activity. However, various testing and assessment strategies are also used for 
651 
the purposes of talent identification (204). Although a goal of identifying future 
652 
potential talent is perhaps appealing, the process of identifying and subjectively 
653 
selecting talent from a very early age typically favours early maturing, while 
654 
excluding later maturing youth (31, 43, 91, 164, 225). Additionally, a comprehensive 
655 
talent identification process is often time-consuming, expensive and, crucially, the 
656 
success rates of identified children transferring through to elite level adult sport is 
657 
questionable (255). 
658 
 
659 
Although a wealth of monitoring and assessment tools are available for practitioners, 
660 
the number and sophistication of tools included within any long-term athletic 
661 
development program should be dependent upon the efficacy and relevance of the 
662 
tests, their associated measurement error, the availability of time, equipment and 
663 
facilities, and the degree of the practitioner’s expertise. Importantly, practitioners 
664 
should select tests that are accurate, reliable, and valid and provide meaningful data. 
665 
Similarly, at all times it is essential that practitioners adhere to the ethics of pediatric 
666 
testing, clearly explain all protocols to both children and parents, and collect both 
667 
parental consent and participant assent prior to any testing (244, 266).     
668 
 
669 
Monitoring growth and maturation 
670 
  
28 
Due to the influence of growth and maturation on measures of physical performance 
671 
(22, 261), relative risk of injury (81, 113, 258) and the propensity for early maturing 
672 
youth to be selected in sports teams as a result of the relative age effect (89, 93, 226), 
673 
it seems plausible that practitioners should attempt to monitor physical growth 
674 
throughout childhood and adolescence. Recent reviews have provided summaries of 
675 
existing methods for the identification, or at least estimation, of biological maturation 
676 
(145, 156). It is acknowledged that the invasive methods have their own strengths and 
677 
weaknesses, while non-invasive methods of estimating maturity require further 
678 
validation especially within different ethnicities (154, 156). Despite the need for 
679 
further research, it is recommended that where practitioners are working with youth 
680 
for a prolonged period of time, quarterly assessments of stature, limb length and body 
681 
mass are taken to allow the analysis of growth curves. This information can be 
682 
collected and provide practitioners with relevant information to help explain 
683 
fluctuations in performance and aid in the identification of youth who are 
684 
experiencing rapid growth, which may potentially place them “at-risk” of growth-
685 
related injury (145). 
686 
 
687 
Monitoring physical performance 
688 
There are a myriad of existing test protocols for assessing physical capacities, such as 
689 
muscle strength and power (72, 73, 86, 141, 173), running speed (170, 218), aerobic 
690 
capacity (6, 11, 263), or motor skill competency (46, 47, 60) and practitioners should 
691 
adopt those that are most viable for their particular environment. For example, it may 
692 
be feasible for practitioners within elite youth sports teams to assess kinetics and 
693 
kinematics using force plate diagnostics and motion capture systems (184), whereas a 
694 
primary school teacher may only be able to test a child’s performance on a standing 
695 
  
29 
broad jump (7) and collect some data on how subjectively difficult training sessions 
696 
were by using a child-modified version of the rating scale of perceived exertion (RPE) 
697 
(99). Both scenarios are likely to provide valuable information related to athletic 
698 
development and subsequent training prescription. Qualified professionals should 
699 
appreciate that when assessing physical capacities in youth, it is important to value 
700 
both the process of performance (i.e. how technically proficient an individual 
701 
performs a jumping movement) and the product of performance (i.e. how far do they 
702 
jump).  
703 
 
704 
Monitoring psychosocial wellbeing 
705 
While practitioners may instinctively focus on assessing and monitoring measures of 
706 
physical performance, for the holistic development of youth, it is imperative that 
707 
consideration also be given to psychosocial wellbeing (197). Various wellbeing 
708 
monitoring tools have been reported in the literature; a modified version of the Profile 
709 
of Mood States questionnaire has previously been shown to be a valid tool for 
710 
assessing mood in adolescents (249), the recovery-stress questionnaire has been used 
711 
to identify non-functional overreaching in youth (29), the acute recovery and stress 
712 
scale has been shown to be a sensitive and valid tool to monitor recovery stress 
713 
imbalances (131), while researchers recently showed how a simple wellbeing 
714 
questionnaire (166) was able to detect perceived wellbeing in a group of adolescents 
715 
(199). The wellbeing questionnaire consists of five key items (fatigue, sleep quality, 
716 
general muscle soreness, stress levels and mood) in which youth provide a score on a 
717 
rating scale of 1 (least positive response) to 5 (most positive response) in 0.5 
718 
increments (166, 199). While psychosocial wellbeing is multifactorial, it is suggested 
719 
that practitioners utilize some form of monitoring system to help identify youth that 
720 
  
30 
are potentially “at risk” of low wellbeing and to ensure that children and adolescents 
721 
remain motivated to participate in sports or physical activity. Where practitioners are 
722 
unable to directly monitor or record data, they should have an awareness of the 
723 
warning signs of reduced wellbeing. For example Matos et al. (162) identified the 
724 
most prevalent symptoms of overtraining in youth as: a loss of appetite, increased 
725 
frequency of injury, frequent tiredness, inability to cope with training loads, frequent 
726 
respiratory infections, heavy and stiff muscles and disrupted sleep patterns.   
727 
 
728 
9. Practitioners working with youth should systematically progress and 
729 
individualize training programs for successful long-term athletic development 
730 
When working within a long-term athletic development pathway, it is imperative 
731 
wherever possible, for qualified professionals to adopt a progressive, individualized 
732 
and integrated approach to the programming of strength and conditioning activities. 
733 
Regardless of whether a practitioner is working with an overweight prepubertal boy 
734 
who is re-engaging with physical activity, or a talented adolescent girl with eight 
735 
years of high quality training experience, there should be a clear goal commensurate 
736 
with the needs of the individual. While existing athletic development models provide 
737 
generic guidelines for qualified professionals to consider for the long-term 
738 
development of athleticism (142, 143), the process of designing, implementing and 
739 
refining youth training programs should be dictated by the needs of the individual, 
740 
their technical competency, and the needs of the relevant sports or activities. Also, 
741 
program design and delivery should accommodate for other influential factors such as 
742 
the time and facilities available for training, the pressures of academic work, and the 
743 
need for socializing with family and friends. 
744 
 
745 
  
31 
Challenges associated with programming for youth 
746 
Periodization represents the theoretical framework for developing a training program 
747 
(203) and involves planning sequential blocks of training to maximize the overall 
748 
training response. However, in the event of insufficient time allowance for rest and 
749 
recovery, fatigue will accumulate and potentially lead to non-functional over-reaching 
750 
or in extreme cases, overtraining or burnout (169). Fatigue management and the 
751 
prevention of overtraining are recognized as key determinants of successful 
752 
programming (206), and the long-term development of athleticism in youth is 
753 
predicated by balancing exposure to training with sufficient time for rest, recovery 
754 
and growth. Much like adults, failure to accommodate for periods of rest will 
755 
undoubtedly make children more susceptible to the negative consequences of 
756 
overtraining or overuse injury (36, 162). Planning for rest and recovery to enable 
757 
natural growth processes to occur is a key moderator that differentiates youth 
758 
programming from that of adults.  
759 
 
760 
The challenge of balancing training stimuli with recovery time becomes even more 
761 
difficult where youth are engaged with multiple sports or activities in successive 
762 
seasons (e.g. a fall, a winter and a summer sport), or play for multiple teams within a 
763 
single season (e.g. youth who play soccer at club, regional and national level). 
764 
Dismissing the need for adequate rest and recovery blocks will likely predispose 
765 
youth to decrements in physical and psychological function (36). Therefore, when 
766 
designing programs practitioners should prescribe rest and recovery periods as 
767 
mandatory blocks of the overall training plan, irrespective of pressures from sports 
768 
coaches or parents. In order to optimize physical development and minimize 
769 
accumulated fatigue, practitioners should also consider the scheduling of training 
770 
  
32 
versus competitions. For young children entering a long-term athletic development 
771 
pathway, researchers suggest that a large proportion of time should be devoted to 
772 
general preparatory training with a focus on development of fundamental movement 
773 
skills and foundational strength; then as the child becomes older, a greater amount of 
774 
time could then be devoted to their chosen sport or physical activity (103). 
775 
Practitioners should also be cognizant of the risks associated with prolonged 
776 
competitions and the amount of rest between, and leading up to, competition (187). 
777 
Intensive competitions lasting 6 hours or more with insufficient rest are a risk factor 
778 
for injury (27); while researchers also advocate that in the event of multiple 
779 
competitions taking place on the same day, youth should be allowed adequate and 
780 
pre-determined rest intervals between repeated bouts of activity (20). In the lead up to 
781 
a sporting event, it has also been suggested that youth should be afforded at least 48 
782 
hours of rest prior to a competition and encouraged to sleep for longer than 7 hours 
783 
per night (150) due to the negative effects of insufficient sleep on health, learning and 
784 
physical performance (21, 34, 90). 
785 
 
786 
Influence of growth and maturation on programming 
787 
Due to the fact that development in youth occurs in a non-linear fashion, practitioners 
788 
need to be flexible and responsive to inter-individual variations in the timing, tempo 
789 
and magnitude of physical maturation, differences in psychosocial maturation, and 
790 
differences in rates and styles of learning. For example, during the growth spurt a 
791 
child may experience temporary disruption in motor control and whole-body 
792 
coordination, commonly termed ‘adolescent awkwardness’ (205, 209). In such an 
793 
instance, practitioners may need to adjust the training program by prescribing 
794 
opportunities to modify existing motor patterns with reduced loadings (145). This 
795 
  
33 
scenario highlights the importance of qualified professionals working with youth to 
796 
not only possess a sound understanding of the training process and an ability to 
797 
observe and correct technique, but also an understanding of key pediatric exercise 
798 
science principles.  
799 
 
800 
10. Qualified professionals and sound pedagogical approaches are fundamental 
801 
to the success of long-term athletic development programs 
802 
While a clear understanding of pediatric exercise science and training principles are 
803 
fundamental to the long-term development of athleticism in youth, a strong grounding 
804 
in pedagogy and coaching skills is also a necessity in order for the practitioner to 
805 
effectively communicate and interact with youth of all ages and abilities (71, 142, 
806 
144). Practitioners should be able to call on a wide range of teaching strategies to 
807 
ensure that all youth are exposed to mentally engaging and physically challenging 
808 
training programs that foster a motivational climate and inspire holistic development 
809 
from both a physical and psychosocial perspective. The ability to promote a 
810 
motivational learning climate, in which all youth are able to participate in a variety of 
811 
developmentally appropriate activities, engage in personal reflection, experience 
812 
success and enhance competence (102), is an essential tool for practitioners in order to 
813 
maximize the development of athleticism. From a holistic perspective, practitioners 
814 
should seek to promote intrinsic motivation in youth as this will encourage a child or 
815 
adolescent to be interested in participating, improving and developing skills, while 
816 
also reducing the risk of youth being solely driven by external rewards, such as 
817 
trophies or scholarships. Cultivating an environment that promotes intrinsic 
818 
motivation and enjoyment while minimizing the negative effects of stress will result 
819 
  
34 
in the best outcome for youth who need to learn and understand that successful 
820 
performance emanates from effort, hard work and desire (26, 124, 232-234). 
821 
 
822 
Within the motivational climate, practitioners should demonstrate, explain, cue and 
823 
modify exercises in a developmentally appropriate manner. While in the initial stages 
824 
of developing athleticism a practitioner may need to provide guidance and feedback to 
825 
teach basic motor patterns, in most instances a combination of visual demonstration 
826 
with concise external cues should be prioritized to maximize the learning and 
827 
feedback processes (17, 94). Recent evidence shows the benefits of using external as 
828 
opposed to internal cues in the performance of rotational jumping techniques in young 
829 
gymnasts (1), with researchers suggesting that attentional focus is improved when 
830 
using externally oriented cueing. The effective management of children and 
831 
adolescents, either within a competitive sporting or recreational physical activity 
832 
environment, will also require clear and well prepared session structures (144), 
833 
effective use of instruction (97), behaviour management strategies (213), the use of 
834 
empowerment, varied use of projection and tone of voice, and a teaching style that 
835 
inspires youth to continually engage in a lifetime of physical activity. 
836 
 
837 
Summary 
838 
It is clear that the field of long-term athletic development has progressed over recent 
839 
years; however, owing to the current lack of longitudinal and well-controlled 
840 
empirical studies, further research is required. Specifically, a better understanding of 
841 
the training process in youth, the manner in which training interacts with growth and 
842 
maturation, and how long-term approaches to athletic development influence physical 
843 
performance, health and wellbeing and injury risk are key areas that require further 
844 
  
35 
study. This new research is also required to validate existing practices amongst 
845 
qualified professionals and to ensure that youth are provided with evidence-based 
846 
practice at all times. All youth should be afforded training programs commensurate 
847 
with their individual needs, which foster a fun and motivational training environment. 
848 
However, above all else, it is imperative that qualified professionals adhere to the 
849 
words of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and help to build our youth for a lifelong 
850 
future of healthy and enjoyable engagement with sports and physical activity.
