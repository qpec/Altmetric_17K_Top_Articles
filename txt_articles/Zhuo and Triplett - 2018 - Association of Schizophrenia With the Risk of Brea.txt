 Association of Schizophrenia With the Risk
of Breast Cancer Incidence
A Meta-analysis
Chuanjun Zhuo, MD, PhD; Patrick Todd Triplett, MD
IMPORTANCE Patients with schizophrenia are considered to have many risk factors for the
development of cancer. However, the incidence of breast cancer in women with
schizophrenia compared with the general population remains uncertain.
OBJECTIVE To perform an updated meta-analysis to evaluate the association between
schizophrenia and the risk of breast cancer.
DATA SOURCES A systematic search of the PubMed and EMBASE databases was conducted
using the search terms schizophrenia, schizophrenic, psychosis, combined with breast and
cancer, tumor, neoplasm, or carcinoma. The final literature search was performed on August
15, 2017.
STUDY SELECTION Cohort studies reporting the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for the risk
of breast cancer in women with schizophrenia compared with the general population.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The meta-analysis adhered to Meta-analysis of
Observational Studies in Epidemiology and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews
of Interventions. Data extraction was performed independently. A random-effects model was
used to pool the results, and a recently proposed prediction interval was calculated to
describe the heterogeneity.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The SIR for the risk of breast cancer in women with
schizophrenia compared with the general population or those without schizophrenia.
RESULTS Twelve cohorts including 125 760 women were included in this meta-analysis.
The results of the meta-analysis showed that schizophrenia was associated with a
significantly increased risk of breast cancer incidence in women (SIR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.14-1.50;
P < .001), with significant heterogeneity (P < .001; I2 = 89%). Substantial between-study
variance was also suggested by the wide prediction interval (0.81-2.10), which indicated
that it is possible that a future study will show a decreased breast cancer risk in women with
schizophrenia compared with the general population. The subgroup analysis results showed
that the association was not significantly affected by whether breast cancer cases were
excluded at baseline or the sample size of the included studies.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The incidence of breast cancer in women with schizophrenia
is higher than that of the general female population. However, significant heterogeneity
exists among the included studies. Women with schizophrenia deserve intensive prevention
and treatment of breast cancer.

 T
he status of physical health in patients with schizophre-
nia has become an important topic in health care man-
agement research.1 Because patients with schizophre-
nia may be prone to have an unhealthy lifestyle, they are
vulnerable to many chronic diseases, such as metabolic
disorders,2,3 diabetes,4,5 and cardiovascular diseases.6,7
However, the risk of cancer in patients with schizophrenia
remains uncertain.8 Although the health of patients with
schizophrenia is complicated by many risk factors for the de-
velopment of cancer, including smoking,9,10 alcohol and sub-
stance abuse,11 obesity,12,13 and lack of exercise,14,15 epidemio-
logic studies have shown inconsistent results. In a previous
meta-analysis of cohort studies,16 the overall risk of cancer was
not statistically significantly increased in patients with schizo-
phreniacomparedwiththegeneralpopulationwithoutschizo-
phrenia. The results of subsequent analyses have shown that
theassociationbetweenschizophreniaandcancerriskmaynot
be explained only by the risk factors related to an unhealthy
lifestyle; many other factors, including genetic mechanisms,
maybeinvolvedintheinteractionsbetweenschizophreniaand
cancer pathogenesis.17 Because schizophrenia has been asso-
ciated with lowered risks of many types of cancer, including
colorectal cancer, malignant melanoma, and prostate cancer,16
it has been hypothesized that the genetic factors involved in
the pathogenesis of schizophrenia may be protective against
cancer.18-20 However, the association between schizophrenia
and breast cancer remains uncertain. The results of subgroup
analyses from a previous meta-analysis have shown an asso-
ciation between schizophrenia and an increased risk of breast
cancer compared with the general female population.16 A sub-
sequent systematic review challenged these results by includ-
ing more recent studies, but the results were mixed.21 Many
published cohort studies were not included in the previous
meta-analysis,22-26 and the results of some previously in-
cluded cohort studies have been updated.27-29 Another
meta-analysis30usedaconventionalmethodthatevaluatesthe
heterogeneity among studies with the I2 statistic and com-
binestheresultswiththerandom-effectsmodel.However,this
method was challenged by recent findings that I2 may not be
an appropriate index of heterogeneity, and instead, a predic-
tion interval (PI) that describes the heterogeneity in a random-
effects meta-analysis should be reported to quantify the
heterogeneity.31 Therefore, we thought it important to per-
form an updated meta-analysis regarding the association be-
tween schizophrenia and the risk of breast cancer with the re-
porting of the PI. The results of this study may lead to better
preventionandearlytreatmentofbreastcancerinwomenwith

Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis was designed
and performed in accordance with the Meta-analysis
of Observational Studies in Epidemiology32 and the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
guidelines.33 The study was approved by Tianjin Medical
University.
Literature Search
We systematically searched the PubMed and EMBASE
databases with the terms schizophrenia, schizophrenic,
and psychosis, combined with breast and cancer, tumor,
neoplasm, or carcinoma. The search was limited to studies in
humans that were published in English. We also manually
screened the reference lists of original and review articles. The
final literature search was performed on August 15, 2017.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Studies that fulfilled the following criteria were included:
(1) published as full-length articles in English, (2) designed as
cohort studies (prospective or retrospective, regardless of the
samplesizeandfollow-upduration),(3)includedadultwomen
(age≥18years),(4)schizophreniaidentifiedasexposureatbase-
line, (5) the general population without a diagnosis of schizo-
phrenia was used as a control, (6) documented incidence of
breast cancer on follow-up, and (7) reported the adjusted stan-
dardized incidence ratios (SIRs), at least adjusted for age, and
their corresponding 95% CIs for breast cancer incidence in
women with schizophrenia compared with controls. The di-
agnosis of schizophrenia and the confirmation of breast can-
cer cases were consistent with the criteria applied in the origi-
nal articles. If studies with overlapping participants were
encountered, the reports with the larger sample size were in-
cluded in the present meta-analysis. Abstracts, letters to the
editor, reviews, and investigations with designs other than a
cohort study were excluded from the present analysis. Stud-
ies reporting breast cancer–related mortality rather than inci-
dence were also excluded because the mortality outcome may
be affected by many factors other than breast cancer inci-
dence, such as comorbidities and treatments.
Data Extraction and Quality Evaluation
We performed the literature search, data extraction, and qual-
ity assessment independently, according to the predefined in-
clusioncriteria.Discrepancieswereresolvedbyconsensus.The
following data regarding the characteristics of the studies were
extracted: name of first author, year of publication, country
where the study was conducted, sample size, source of the
Key Points
Question Are women with schizophrenia at a higher risk for
breast cancer?
Findings In this meta-analysis of 12 cohort studies that included
125 760 women and in which conventional methods of
meta-analysis had been used, schizophrenia in women was
associated with an increased breast cancer incidence compared
with the general population. However, substantial between-study
variance is present that is reflected by the wide prediction interval.
Meaning The results suggest that the incidence of breast cancer
in women with schizophrenia is higher than that of the general
female population; however, significant heterogeneity exists
among the included studies, and it is possible that a future study
will show a decreased breast cancer risk in women with
schizophrenia compared with the general population.

Statistical Analysis
Data of SIRs and the lower and upper limits of their 95% CIs
were extracted to calculate log SIRs and their corresponding
SEs. The logarithmically transformed SIRs and their corre-
sponding SEs were used to stabilize the variance and normal-
ize the distribution. The Cochran Q test and the I2 statistic were
used to evaluate the heterogeneity among the included co-
hort studies.30 A random-effects model was used for the meta-
analysis of the SIR data because this model is considered to
produce a more generalized result by considering heteroge-
neitybetweenstudies.33APIwascalculatedbasedonthemeth-
ods provided by Borenstein et al31 indicating the range of a true
SIRofafuturestudyin95%ofallpopulations.Sensitivityanaly-
ses by omitting 1 study at a time were performed to evaluate
the robustness of the results.35 Because a previous system-
aticreviewhasindicatedthatstudieswithmorethan100breast
cancer cases tend to show an evident association between
schizophrenia and the risk of breast cancer,21 we performed
stratified analyses according to whether the number of breast
cancer cases in the included studies was over 100. Subgroup
analysis was performed according to whether the cases of
breast cancer that occurred before the diagnosis of schizo-
phreniawereexcludedineachstudy.Potentialpublicationbias
was assessed by funnel plots with the Egger regression asym-
metrytest.36RevMan,version5.1(CochraneCollaboration)and
Stata software, version 12.0 (StataCorp) were used for the
statistical analyses.
Results
Literature Search Results
The literature searching process and study identification are
summarized in Figure 1. In brief, 832 records were identified
after initial database searching and exclusion of the duplicate
records. Further screening of titles and abstracts excluded 801
records, mainly because they were irrelevant to the aim of the
study. For the 31 records that underwent full-text review, 20
were excluded because 2 of them included patients with men-
tal diseases other than schizophrenia, 7 were reports of al-
ready included cohorts, 3 did not report the incidence of breast
cancer, 6 only reported data regarding breast cancer mortal-
ity, and the other 2 did not provide outcome data as SIRs.
Study Characteristics and Quality Evaluation
Overall,11database-derivedretrospectivecohortstudies8,22-26,37-41
were included. Because 1 study36 included data from 2 differ-
entcohorts,12cohortswereincludedinourmeta-analysis.The
baseline characteristics of the included cohorts are reported
in the eTable in the Supplement. There was a total of
125 760 women included in the studies. Overall, the studies
were published between 1992 and 2016 and included par-
ticipants from Europe,23,25,38-40 the United States,22,37 and
Asia.8,24,26,37,41 Five cohorts included hospitalized patients
with schizophrenia,23,26,38-40 while the others did not
specify the source of the patients. The number of women
with schizophrenia included in each study varied from 1388
to 46 447, and the number of the breast cancer cases ranged
from 42 to 1042. Six studies8,23-26,39 excluded the breast
cancer cases that occurred before the diagnosis of schizo-
phrenia; the other studies did not specify. The qualities of
the included studies were generally good, with Newcastle-
Ottawa Scale values between 6 and 8.
Schizophrenia and the Incidence of Breast Cancer
Themeta-analysisresultsofthe12cohortsshowedthatschizo-
phrenia was associated with a significantly increased risk of
breast cancer incidence in women (SIR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.14-
1.50; P < .001) (Figure 2), with significant heterogeneity
(P < .001; I2 = 89%). The existence of substantial between-
study variance is reflected by the wide PI (0.81-2.10). Accord-
ingly, it is possible that a future study will show a decreased
breastcancerriskinwomenwithschizophreniacomparedwith
the general population. The findings of sensitivity by omit-
ting 1 study at a time did not significantly change the results,
with the SIR varying between 1.29 and 1.38 (all P < .01).
Results of Subgroup Analyses
The results of subgroup analyses showed that the association
between schizophrenia and an increased breast cancer inci-
dence was significant in studies in which breast cancer oc-
curred before the diagnosis of schizophrenia were excluded

in studies with more than 100 breast cancer cases (SIR, 1.31;
95% CI, 1.18-1.46; P < .001; I2 = 84%) (Figure 4), but the asso-

or in studies with fewer than 100 breast cancer cases (SIR, 1.50;
95% CI, 0.78-2.87; P = .23; I2 = 93%) (Figure 4). However, the
differences between subgroups were not statistically signifi-
cant (P = .90 and P = .70 for subgroup interaction).
Publication Bias
The funnel plot for the association between schizophrenia and
breast cancer incidence was symmetric on visual inspection
(eFigure 1 in the Supplement). The Egger regression test also
did not indicate a potential publication bias (P = .64).
Discussion
In this study, by pooling the results of all available cohort stud-
ies with the conventional method of meta-analysis, we found

 that women with schizophrenia are at a higher risk for the in-
cidence of breast cancer compared with the general popula-
tion. These results were not significantly affected by whether
only breast cancer cases after the diagnosis of schizophrenia
were considered or the sample size of the studies. However,
substantial between-study variance is present, which is re-
flectedbythewidePI(0.81-2.10).Accordingly,itispossiblethat
a future study will show a decreased breast cancer risk in
women with schizophrenia compared with the general popu-
lation. Because breast cancer is the most common cancer in
women,affecting1in9womenduringtheirlifetime,42ourfind-
ings highlight that intensive prevention and treatment against
breast cancer are warranted for women with schizophrenia.
The results of this study have important clinical implica-
tions. First, we found that schizophrenia in women was asso-
ciated with an increased breast cancer incidence compared
with the general population, which is contrary to the previ-
ous hypothesis that schizophrenia may be protective against
cancer. These results, together with our recent meta-analysis
results showing no association with lung cancer risk but a re-
duced hepatic cancer risk in schizophrenia (data available on
request), indicated that the association between schizophre-
niaandcancerriskmaybecomplicatedanddependonthecan-
cer site. Second, because the current status of breast cancer
prevention and treatment options are less optimal in women
with schizophrenia,43 our results highlight that women with
schizophrenia deserve focused care for breast cancer screen-
ing and treatment. These gaps were also reflected by the re-
sults of a recent study showing that patients with schizophre-
nia are at a significantly increased risk of cancer mortality
compared with the general population or individuals with-
out schizophrenia,44 although the incidence of cancer in these
patients may not necessarily differ from that of the general
population. For the early prevention of breast cancer, an ini-
tial evaluation is needed to stratify the risk of breast cancer in
women with schizophrenia. Subsequently, antipsychotics that
may increase the prolactin level and produce a higher breast
cancer risk should be avoided in high-risk women. Regular
screening,includingimagingorbiomarkertests,shouldbeper-
formed.Ifanearlydiagnosisofbreastcancerismadeinwomen
withschizophrenia,collaborationswithoncologistsareneeded
for clinical psychiatrists to make an optimal treatment recom-
mendation. In addition, every effort should be made to im-
prove the patients’adherence during the prevention, treat-
ment, and follow-up.
An important strength of our study is that we calculated
the PI to describe the heterogeneity in a random-effects meta-
analysis. We found substantial between-study variance, which
is reflected by the wide PI (0.81-2.10). Accordingly, it is pos-
sible that a future study will show a decreased breast cancer
risk in women with schizophrenia compared with the general
population. Within the context of significant heterogeneity
amongthepreviouslypublishedcohortstudiesfocusingonthe
association between schizophrenia and breast cancer risk,
whether performing an epidemiologic study is sufficient to an-
swer the question is of concern. Instead, large database re-
search, such as deep neural network analysis centered on a
genetic or other biological association between schizophre-
nia and breast cancer risk, may be optimal. These studies are
warranted.
As for the potential mechanisms underlying the associa-
tion between an increased breast cancer risk in women with
schizophrenia, many factors may be involved (eFigure 2 in the
Supplement). First, many clinical conditions that are com-

 monly seen in patients with schizophrenia may also be risk fac-
tors for the development of breast cancer, such as obesity,
nulliparity, and breastfeeding.45 As breast cancer may be a hor-
mone-dependent cancer, a significant positive association be-
tween plasma prolactin levels and the risk of breast cancer, has
been observed46; in addition, increased prolactin levels have
been documented in women with schizophrenia, particu-
larly for those receiving certain antipsychotics.47 Finally,
schizophrenia and breast cancer may share some other patho-
physiologic factors during their development, including path-
ways involved in angiogenesis48 and cell cycle regulation.49
However, further experimental studies are needed to deter-
mine the exact mechanisms underlying the association be-
tween schizophrenia and breast cancer incidence.
Limitations
Ourstudyhassomelimitationsthatshouldbeconsideredwhen
interpreting the results. First, as inherent in other meta-
analyses of observational studies, we could not exclude the
possibility that some residual factors may confound the asso-
ciation between schizophrenia and breast cancer, such as di-
etaryfactorsandtheuseofantipsychotics.Asacommonshort-
coming of meta-analyses of observational studies, the results
of this study could not indicate a causative association be-
tween schizophrenia and breast cancer in women. In addi-
tion, significant heterogeneity remained in our meta-
analysis, and the source of the heterogeneity could not be fully
analyzed because we did not have access to individual pa-
tientdataoftheincludedcohorts.Also,wedidnotincludestud-
ies found in other databases, not written in English, or pub-
lished as a conference abstract. We acknowledge this as a
limitation.However,includingliteraturereportsfromPubMed,
EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library published only in English
should have covered the majority of the cases. Including con-
ference abstracts that did not undergo peer review may po-
tentially cause other bias. Finally, factors such as age at onset
of breast cancer, treatment, or cancer subtypes may substan-
tially affect the association between schizophrenia and breast
cancer incidence. These factors were generally not reported
in the original studies; therefore, they could not be analyzed
accordingly in the meta-analysis. Future studies are needed
to determine the association between schizophrenia and the
different pathologic subtypes of breast cancer as well as
whether the association may be affected by the woman’
s age
at breast cancer onset, antipsychotic medications used, and
the cancer subtype.
Conclusions
The results of this meta-analysis demonstrated that women
with schizophrenia are at a higher risk for the incidence of
breast cancer, compared with the general female population,
although substantial between-study variance is present. In-
tensive screening and treatment for breast cancer in women
with schizophrenia are clinically important.
