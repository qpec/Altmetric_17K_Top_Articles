IMPORTANCE Giving birth to a child with a major birth defect is a serious life event for a
woman, yet little is known about the long-term health consequences for the mother.
OBJECTIVE To assess whether birth of an infant born with a major congenital anomaly was
associated with higher maternal risk of mortality.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based cohort study (n = 455 250
women) used individual-level linked Danish registry data for mothers who gave birth to an
infant with a major congenital anomaly (41 508) between 1979 and 2010, with follow-up until
December 31, 2014. A comparison cohort (413 742) was constructed by randomly sampling,
for each mother with an affected infant, up to 10 mothers matched on maternal age, parity,
and year of infant’s birth.
EXPOSURE Live birth of an infant with a major congenital anomaly as defined by the
European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies classification system.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary
outcomes included cause-specific mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs) were adjusted for marital
status, immigration status, income quartile (since 1980), educational level (since 1981),
diabetes mellitus, modified Charlson comorbidity index score, hypertension, depression,
history of alcohol-related disease, previous spontaneous abortion, pregnancy complications,
smoking (since 1991), and body mass index (since 2004).
RESULTS Mothers in both groups were a mean (SD) age of 28.9 (5.1) years at delivery.
After a median (IQR) follow-up of 21 (12-28) years, there were 1275 deaths (1.60 per
1000 person-years) among 41 508 mothers of a child with a major congenital anomaly
vs 10 112 deaths (1.27 per 1000 person-years) among 413 742 mothers in the comparison
cohort, corresponding to an absolute mortality rate difference of 0.33 per 1000 person-years
(95% CI, 0.24-0.42), an unadjusted HR of 1.27 (95% CI, 1.20-1.35), and an adjusted HR
of 1.22 (95% CI, 1.15-1.29). Mothers with affected infants were more likely to die of
cardiovascular disease (rate difference, 0.05 per 1000 person-years [95% CI, 0.02-0.08];
adjusted HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.04-1.53]), respiratory disease (rate difference, 0.02 per 1000
person-years [95% CI, 0.00-0.04]; adjusted HR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.01-2.08]), and other natural
causes (rate difference, 0.11 per 1000 person-years [95% CI, 0.07-0.15]; adjusted HR, 1.50
[95% CI, 1.27-1.76]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In Denmark, having a child with a major congenital anomaly
was associated with a small but statistically significantly increased mortality risk in the mother
compared with women without an affected child. However, the clinical importance of this
association is uncertain.

M
ajor structural or genetic congenital anomalies affect
approximately 2% to 5% of all births in the United
States and Europe.1-3 Advances in medical care have
led to a continuing decrease in mortality rates for children born
with congenital anomalies and a corresponding increase in the
prevalence of children with complex chronic conditions.4
Mothers of children born with major congenital anoma-
lies face serious challenges such as high financial pressures,5
as well as the burden of providing care to a child with com-
plex needs within the home setting,6 which can impair a
mother’
s health. Caregiving mothers of children with severe
chronic illness have been found to have impaired ability to
suppress proinflammatory signals (eg, interleukin-6)7 and
greater cell aging associated with high oxidative stress, low
telomerase activity, and shorter telomere length.8 Parents
(mostly mothers) of children with both multiple9 and
specific10 chronic conditions report higher rates of chronic
conditions, activity limitations, and poorer physical and
mental health compared with parents of healthy children.
These health issues may be related to the direct effects of
caregiving demands and stress.10
This population-based cohort study assessed whether the
birth of an infant with a major congenital anomaly was sub-
sequently associated with increased risk of death of the in-
fant’
s mother. It was hypothesized that the mothers of these
infants would have an increased mortality rate compared with
a general population comparison cohort without exposure to
acongenitalanomaly.Thestudyalsoaimedtocomparethespe-
cific causes of death between the mothers of affected infants
and the comparison cohort.
Methods
Setting
This study was conducted in Denmark (population 5.6 mil-
lion), which provides its residents with universal access to
health care. The study received approval from the Danish Data
Protection Agency, which oversees the confidentiality of
individual-level information in Danish registries, and The Hos-
pital for Sick Children’
s Research Ethics Board. Informed con-
sent was not required for this registry-based study.
Data Linkage
The Danish Civil Registration System (CRS) assigns a unique
registration number to all Danish residents. The CRS pro-
vided demographic data and allowed complete individual-
level data linkage across data sources. CRS data on migration
and vital statistics are updated daily.11
Cohorts
We used the Medical Birth Registry to identify all women
who gave birth to a live singleton infant during January 1,
1979, to December 31, 2010. The study was restricted to
mothers who had a minimum of 2 years of health data before
giving birth and who survived and did not emigrate at least 1
year postdelivery. The criterion of 1-year survival was insti-
tuted to exclude mortality caused by pregnancy complica-
tions, and the minimum 2-year data period allowed us to
adjust for preexisting comorbidities. The Medical Birth
Registry contains information on all deliveries occurring in
Denmark, including the CRS registration numbers of parents
and newborns, date of birth, singleton vs multiple births, ges-
tational age, and various physical characteristics of the
newborn.12 Cohorts were followed for outcomes from 1 year
after the date of delivery until the first of death, emigration,
or study end (December 31, 2014).
Major Congenital Anomalies Cohort
Major congenital anomalies were identified through linkage
to the Danish National Patient Registry.13 The registry has
tracked all Danish hospitalization data since 1977 and all
outpatient and emergency department visits since 1995. It
contains admission and discharge data on all hospital con-
tacts, including up to 20 diagnoses classified according to the
International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision (ICD-8)
until 1993 and ICD-10 since 1994. Congenital anomalies were
defined with the European Surveillance of Congenital Anoma-
lies classification system.14 Major congenital anomalies diag-
nosed in outpatient encounters only or caused by hip dislo-
cationordysplasiaonlywereexcludedbecauseoflowaccuracy
of these diagnoses in Danish registry data.15 For mothers with
multiple births of infants with major congenital anomalies, the
firstbirthwasdesignatedastheindex.Becausechildhoodmul-
tiorgancomplexchronicdiseasehasbeenassociatedwithmore
severeconsequencescomparedwithdiseasesaffectingasingle
organ,16 major congenital anomalies were subdivided into
2 groups: major congenital anomalies affecting greater than 1
organ system (subgroup) in the European Surveillance of
Congenital Anomalies classification (eg, both congenital heart
disease and congenital renal anomaly), and single-organ ma-
jor congenital anomalies, such as isolated congenital heart dis-
ease. All diagnostic codes used in the study are available in the
eAppendix in the Supplement.
Comparison Cohort
For each mother in the major congenital anomaly group, we
randomly sampled up to 10 mothers in the CRS who deliv-
ered a child without a congenital anomaly, individually
Key Points
Question Do mothers who give birth to an infant with a major
congenital anomaly have an increased risk of mortality?
Findings In this Danish population-based cohort study of 455 250
women, mothers of infants born with a major congenital anomaly
had a significantly increased mortality risk compared with women
without an affected infant (absolute mortality rate difference, 0.33
per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio, 1.27). This elevated risk was
noted both during the first 10 years after the child’s birth, when
the mother was likely caring for a dependent child with substantial
health needs, and after longer follow-up, and no single cause of
death explained this association.
Meaning Having a child with a major congenital anomaly was
associated with a small but significantly increased risk of mortality
in the mother.

matched by maternal age, year of the infant’
s birth, and par-
ity (1, 2, or ≥3 children).
Primary and Secondary Outcomes
Our primary outcome was time to death of the mother. A sec-
ondary outcome was cause-specific mortality of the mother
based on the Danish Register of Causes of Death,17 which com-
piles information on causes of death from death certificates.
DatawereavailableinthisregistryuntilDecember31,2011,and
categorized according to the underlying cause of death listed
first on the death certificate. Cause of death was divided into
death from natural (“medical”) and unnatural (“nonmedi-
cal”) causes. Deaths from natural causes were subdivided into
those from cancer; cardiovascular disease (including myocar-
dial infarction and stroke); respiratory causes; endocrine, nu-
tritional, and metabolic causes; nervous system causes; and
other natural causes. Deaths from unnatural causes were di-
videdintothosefrommotorvehiclecrashes,suicide,andother
accidents or violence.
Covariates
Other variables used in the study included maternal age, mari-
tal status, and immigration status obtained from the CRS at the
child’
s birth. Income quartile (available starting in 1980) and
level of education (available starting in 1981) were obtained at
baseline from Statistics Denmark.18,19 Early cohort enrollees
(1979-1980)wereassignedincomeandeducationfromtheear-
liest available data. The Medical Birth Registry provided in-
formation on previous live births, stillbirths, and congenital
anomalies, as well as complications during the index preg-
nancy, including both placental complications (preeclamp-
sia, gestational hypertension, and placental abruption/
infarction) and nonplacental complications (intrauterine
hypoxia/birth asphyxia, uterine rupture, umbilical cord pro-
lapse, vasa previa, amniotic fluid embolism, and fetal hemor-
rhage). Maternal medical history was ascertained from the
DanishNationalPatientRegistryandsummarizedwithamodi-
fied Charlson comorbidity index score that excluded diabe-
tes and alcohol-related liver disease.20 Diabetes and alcohol
use have a strong confounding relation with both congenital
anomalies and poor maternal health21,22 and were therefore
included as separate covariates. Chronic hypertension and ma-
ternal depression were also included. Maternal smoking (data
availablestartingin1991)andbodymassindex(BMI;dataavail-
able starting in 2004) were left truncated and therefore used
only in secondary analyses.
Statistical Analysis
Time-to-event curves for mortality were plotted with the
Kaplan-Meier technique. We computed cumulative inci-
dence estimates and plotted the cumulative incidence curves
of cause-specific mortality, taking into account death by other
causes as competing risks. Competing causes of death were
censored for the calculation of cause-specific hazard ratios
(HRs). The log-rank test was used to test the statistical signifi-
canceofobserveddifferencesinsurvivorshipbetweenmothers
who had a child with a major congenital anomaly (exposed
group) to those in the comparison (referent) cohort.
We performed a survival analysis using time-to-event Cox
proportional hazards regression analyses to compare the risk
of each outcome between mothers in the exposed group with
those in the comparison cohort, using HRs with 95% CIs.
Multivariable Cox models were adjusted for covariates at base-
line that were thought to be potential confounders according
to biological plausibility, previous research, or clinical rel-
evance (eFigure in the Supplement). These covariates in-
cluded those related to baseline maternal demographics
(marital status and immigration status), socioeconomic sta-
tus (income quartile and educational level), previous mater-
nal health (diabetes mellitus, modified Charlson comorbidity
index score, chronic hypertension, history of alcohol-related
disease, and depression), previous spontaneous abortion, and
pregnancy complications. The proportional hazards assump-
tion was assessed graphically with –ln[–ln(survival)] vs ln
(analysis time), with no major violations observed.
Secondary analyses were planned and performed within
the subgroupings of major congenital anomalies into those af-
fecting 1 organ system or more (multiorgan) and those affect-
ing a single organ compared with their matched comparison
group, using the log-rank test. In the main analysis, stratified
subgroup analyses were performed for the full cohort, com-
paring the major congenital anomaly group with the same ref-
erent group according to duration of follow-up (0-10 years,
>10-20 years, and >20-35 years), the year of delivery (1979-
1993 [ICD-8], 1994-2004 [ICD-10 with smoking data], and
2004-2010 [ICD-10 with smoking and BMI data]), infant pre-
maturity (≤37 weeks and >37 weeks), and infant death in the
first year of life. A sensitivity analysis was also performed, ex-
cluding mothers whose infants had an anomaly caused by po-
tentially confounding exposures to teratogens or infections
(teratogenic syndromes with malformations, fetal alcohol syn-
drome, valproate syndrome, and maternal infections result-
ing in malformations).
Additional post hoc analyses were performed, account-
ing for other life events in the observation period. The first
set of analyses added to the main Cox model these time-
dependent covariates: marital status, income, maternal de-
pression, child death, and various combinations thereof.
The second set of analyses stratified the main model by the
number of child hospitalizations after the newborn hospital-
ization (0, 1-3, and ≥4), the death of the child from aged 1 year
to the end of the observation period, and whether the woman
in the exposed group had a subsequent pregnancy with a con-
genital anomaly compared with her own matches. An addi-
tional sensitivity analysis was conducted that used only
inpatient data to calculate the modified Charlson comorbid-
ity index score.
All analyses were conducted with SAS version 9.4. Test-
ing was 2-sided and P<.05 was considered significant.
Results
Among 1 924 497 eligible mothers during the study period,
42 731 (2.2%) gave birth to an infant with a major congenital
anomaly. Almost all of these, 41 508, were the mother’
s first

posed the exposed study cohort (Figure 1). Among infants with
a major congenital anomaly, 4102 (9.9%) had multiorgan con-
genital anomalies and 37 406 (90.1%) had single-organ con-
genital anomalies. The comparison cohort was composed of
413 742 mothers.
The 2 cohorts of mothers were a mean (SD) age of 28.9 (5.1)
years at delivery. No large differences were noted between the
2 groups in matching variables (year of birth, age at delivery,
or parity), demographics (marital status, immigration status,
education, and income), pregnancy history (history of spon-
taneous abortions and stillbirths), index pregnancy compli-
cations, and maternal medical history (Table 1). Among the in-
fants, low birth weight was more common in those with major
congenital anomalies (14.5%) than in the comparison cohort
(4.2%), as was prematurity (13.5% vs 4.5%), 5-minute Apgar
score less than 7 at 5 minutes (6.1% vs 1.8%), and child mor-
tality before the end of the observation period (3.1% vs 0.5%).
Main and Subgroup Analyses
After a median follow-up of 21 years (interquartile range, 12-28
years), 3.1% (1275) of mothers of infants born with major con-
genital anomalies died during the follow-up period (mortal-
ity rate, 1.60 per 1000 person-years [95% CI, 1.51-1.69]) at a
mean age of 49.2 years (SD, 9.6 years), whereas 2.4% (10 112)
of those in the comparison cohort died at a mean age of 49.5
years (SD, 9.4 years) (mortality rate, 1.27 per 1000 person-
years [95% CI, 1.24-1.29]). The corresponding absolute mor-
tality rate difference was 0.33 per 1000 person-years (95% CI,
0.24-0.42),theunadjustedHRwas1.27(95%CI,1.20-1.35),and
the adjusted HR was 1.22 (95% CI, 1.15-1.29) (Figure 2).
Analyses stratified by time after birth, by whether the in-
fant had single-organ or multiorgan congenital anomalies, by
prematurity, and by infant death are presented in Table 2.
The adjusted HR for mortality was 1.31 (95% CI, 1.08-1.59)
among mothers whose infants had multiorgan congenital
anomalies and 1.21 (95% CI, 1.14-1.29) for those whose infants

Cause of Death
Table 3 compares the groups by cause of mortality. After ad-
justing for covariates, mothers of infants born with major con-
genitalanomaliesweremorelikelytodiefromallnaturalcauses
(rate difference, 0.25 per 1000 person-years [95% CI, 0.16-
0.34]; adjusted HR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.12-1.30]). They were more
likely to die of cardiovascular diseases (rate difference, 0.05
per 1000 person-years [95% CI, 0.02-0.08]; adjusted HR, 1.26
[95% CI, 1.04-1.53]), including myocardial infarction (rate dif-
ference, 0.02 per 1000 person-years [95% CI, 0.01-0.04]; ad-
justed HR, 1.97 [95% CI, 1.28-3.02]), and were also more likely
to die of respiratory diseases (rate difference, 0.02 per 1000
person-years [95% CI, 0.00-0.04]; adjusted HR, 1.45 [95% CI,
1.01-2.08]) and other natural causes (rate difference, 0.11 per
1000 person-years [95% CI, 0.07-0.15]; adjusted HR, 1.50 [95%
CI, 1.27-1.76]). Cancer deaths were marginally increased (rate
difference, 0.06 per 1000 person-years [95% CI, 0.00-0.12];
adjusted HR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.00-1.22]). Mothers of infants born
with major congenital anomalies were no more likely to die
from unnatural (nonmedical) causes (rate difference, 0.03 per
1000person-years[95%CI,0.00-0.06];adjustedHR,1.12[95%
CI, 0.92-1.36]).
Additional Analyses
The first set of additional analyses, which considered marital
status, income, maternal depression, and child death as
time-dependent covariates individually or in combination, re-
sulted in mild attenuation of the estimate of the effect size
(eTable 1 in Supplement). In the second set of analyses, the ad-
justedHRsrangedfrom1.02(95%CI,0.89-1.17)amongchildren
with no subsequent hospitalizations to 1.71 (95% CI, 1.56-
1.88) among those with greater than or equal to 4 hospitaliza-
tions (eTable 2 in Supplement). Adjusted HRs were 0.76 (95%
CI, 0.49-1.18) for death of the child during the observation pe-
riod and 1.15 (95% CI, 0.79-1.68) among women who had a sub-
sequent child with a congenital anomaly. HR estimates did not
change with exclusion of outpatient Charlson comorbidity in-
dex score ascertainment.
Discussion
The birth of a child with major congenital anomalies was asso-
ciated with a small increased risk of death of mothers. This el-
evated risk was noted both during the first 10 years after the
child’
s birth, when the mother was likely caring for a depen-
dent child with substantial health needs, and after longer
follow-up. No single cause of death explained this association.
Previous population-level longitudinal studies reporting
increased mortality among caregiving mothers have focused
solely on bereaved parents.23-25 Caregiver health studies of
nonbereaved mothers caring for chronically ill children have
described small cohorts with poor self-reported health
outcomes9,10 or biomarkers of advanced cellular aging.8 High
rates of chronic stress are reported in these caregivers.26
Animal and human studies of allostatic load have linked
chronic stress exposure with health-damaging behaviors and
adverse physiologic changes that increase disease risk.27
Deaths from diseases that were most closely linked to chronic
stress exposure and to allostatic load, most notably cardio-
vascular diseases,28,29 were more prevalent among the moth-
ers of children with major congenital anomalies. Cancer-
related deaths were only slightly elevated in the exposed
group, which is consistent with previous studies that have
suggested a null or weak relation of chronic stress and
cancer.30,31 Furthermore, high risk was observed in mothers
who gave birth to infants with more severe anomalies (multi-
organ congenital anomalies), as well as those whose children
had 4 or more subsequent hospitalizations. Such children
likely pose greater caregiving challenges. The relatively mod-
est effect sizes in subgroups defined by infant risk factors (eg,
prematurity and infant death by 1 year) could be due to the
independent effect of these infant characteristics on mortal-
ity in mothers or a lack of precision in outcome estimates
because of small sample size.
An alternative explanation is that the association of off-
spring congenital anomalies and mortality risk of the mother

is due to other unmeasured factors, including unknown ge-
netic factors or behavioral factors such as poor diet, seden-
tarybehavior,smoking,oralcoholconsumptionthatmayaffect
risk of both major congenital anomalies32 and premature adult
mortality.33,34 Adjustments were made for as many relevant
measurable maternal factors as possible, but some (eg, smok-
ing, BMI) were available for only part of the study period and
others (eg, nutritional intake history, hereditary factors) were
unavailable.
Studies of mortality among persons caring for dependent
adults (mainly the elderly) have reported mixed findings.
One study found increased mortality among spouses who
reported caregiving strain,35 whereas others have reported
reduced mortality among informal family caregivers.36-38 The
latter reports may stem from the so-called healthy caregiver
effect, whereby healthy people are more likely to assume care-
giving roles or may obtain health benefits from caregiving
roles.39 Differences in the findings of studies of caregivers for
adults vs children may reflect differences in the age of care-
givers, the nature of the care, or the extent of choice in taking
on a caregiving role. There are differences as well in the domi-
nant role assumed by a single individual (the mother) in early
childhoodcaregivingsituationsinDenmarkandelsewhere,the
duration for which caregiving is necessary, or the lack of prepa-
ration for the role.

Anomalies from 1980-2012.2 Exposed mothers were matched
to a comparison group on parity, maternal age, and year of de-
livery, avoiding key sources of potential confounding. The
study also used many important covariates through rou-
tinely collected data, thereby avoiding potential measure-
ment bias. Although the outcome of death is relatively un-
common in women of childbearing age, the study population
waslargeenoughandtheoutcomeperiodwassufficientlylong
to provide stable estimates.
Several limitations must be considered when study find-
ings are interpreted. The study population benefited from uni-
versal free health care, with relatively generous family assis-
tance and extensive support for families of children with
chronic medical conditions.40 Findings may differ in other
countries. However, given that medical and social support
should be protective of poor maternal health outcomes, even
strongereffectsmightbeexpectedinothersettings.Studyfind-
ings cannot be generalized to other groups of children with
chronicconditionsthatarenotduetomajorcongenitalanoma-
lies. For cause of death, potential misclassification and incom-
plete data can lead to imprecise estimates.17 Some important
covariates were left truncated and so could not be used in the
full analysis (eg, smoking and BMI). Others required extrapo-
lation from data collected after the exposure for a small sub-
set of the cohort (eg, income and education were only avail-
able starting in 1980 and 1981, respectively). The results were
consistent on stratifying the analysis by the era in which the
child was born, although not significantly in 2004-2010. This
is likely due to the small sample size and short time to accrue
deaths, but also could be due to other factors such as control-
ling for BMI in this period. Some subgroup analyses had small
sample sizes and hence few outcome events (eg, prematurity
and infant death) and imprecise estimates of effect size.
Covariates in the main model were analyzed as fixed-in-time
variables in Cox modeling. This analysis could not account for
all potential confounders and mediators between a woman’
s
having a child with a major congenital anomaly and her risk
of dying later in life. Although additional analyses were con-
ducted to account for other life events in the observation pe-
riod, the potential dynamic effects of variables that may
mediate stress or other factors such as the various health tra-
jectoriesandcaregivingneedsofchildrenbornwithmajorcon-
genital anomalies were not considered. Danish registry data
also do not contain information on other potentially impor-
tant mediators such as the degree of caregiving provided by
individual mothers, or care provided by other individuals or
in settings outside the home.
Conclusions
In Denmark, having a child with a major congenital anomaly
was associated with a small but statistically significantly in-
creased mortality risk in the mother compared with women
without an affected child. However, the clinical importance of
this association is uncertain.
