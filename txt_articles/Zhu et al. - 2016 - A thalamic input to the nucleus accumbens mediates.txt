Abstract
Chronic opiate use induces opiate dependence, which is characterized by extremely unpleasant 
physical and emotional feelings after drug use is terminated. Both rewarding effects of drug and 
the desire to avoid withdrawal symptoms motivate continued drug use1-3, and the nucleus 
accumbens (NAc) is important for orchestrating both processes4,5. While multiple inputs to the 
NAc regulate reward6-9, little is known about the NAc circuitry underlying withdrawal. Here we 
identify the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) as a prominent input to the NAc 
mediating the expression of opiate withdrawal induced physical signs and aversive memory. 
Activity in the PVT to NAc pathway is necessary and sufficient to mediate behavioral aversion. 
Selectively silencing this pathway abolishes aversive symptoms in two different mouse models of 
opiate withdrawal. Chronic morphine exposure selectively potentiates excitatory transmission 
between the PVT and D2-receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs) via synaptic 
insertion of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors. Notably, in vivo optogenetic depotentiation restores 
normal transmission at PVT→D2-MSNs synapses and robustly suppresses morphine withdrawal 
symptoms. These results link morphine-evoked pathway- and cell type-specific plasticity in the 
PVT→NAc circuit to opiate dependence, and suggest that reprogramming this circuit holds 
promise for treating opiate addiction.
To systematically map brain regions that directly innervate the NAc, we stereotaxically 
injected a rabies virus in which the viral glycoprotein is replaced by red fluorescent protein 
mCherry (RV-mCherry) into the medial shell of the NAc10,11. Besides well-characterized 
inputs to the NAc, such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), ventral hippocampus (vHipp), and 
basolateral amygdala (BLA)8,10,12 (Extended Data Fig.1a), we also detected mCherry-
expressing neurons in the PVT (Fig.1a, Extended Data Fig.1b). This result was particularly 
interesting because although previous studies have suggested a potentially important role for 
the PVT in drug-seeking behavior, its underlying circuitry mechanism remains 
unknown13-15.
To characterize the PVT to NAc connection, we injected channelrodopin2-expressing adeno-
associated virus (AAV-ChR2) into the PVT, then prepared acute NAc slices containing

 ChR2-expressing terminals from the PVT16 (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Brief light stimulation 
(3-5 ms) elicited reliable firing of action potentials up to 20 Hz in ChR2-expressing PVT 
neurons (Extended Data Fig. 2b). The same stimulation also evoked robust α-amino-3-
hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated excitatory 
postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in MSNs, as it was blocked by bath application of a 
competitive AMPAR antagonist CNQX (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Light stimulation also 
evoked picrotoxin-sensitive inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) (Extended Data Fig. 
3b). Because the PVT contains few if any GABAergic neurons (Extended Data Fig. 3a), it is 
likely that these IPSCs were caused by feed-forward inhibition in a local NAc circuit. 
Consistent with this prediction, PVT activation-evoked IPSCs had a longer delay than that of 
the EPSCs and the IPSCs which were blocked by CNQX (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d).
Activation of inputs from the PFC, vHipp and BLA to the NAc is rewarding and drives self-
stimulation behavior8,9. To directly assess the behavioral consequences of PVT→NAc 
circuit activity, we optogenetically activated this pathway in freely moving mice and 
examined their motivational valence using a real-time place preference (RTPP) assay (Fig.
1b) (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 4). Strikingly, optogenetic activation of the PVT→NAc 
pathway reduced the time spent in the chamber paired with light stimulation (Fig. 1c). This 
indicates that, unlike other major inputs to the NAc, activation of the PVT→NAc pathway is 
aversive rather than rewarding. Avoidance of the light-paired chamber was dependent on 
local glutamatergic but not dopaminergic transmission in the NAc. Intra-NAc infusion of 
AMPAR antagonist NBQX abolished the avoidance behavior, while intra-NAc infusion of 
D1 receptor (D1R) antagonist SCH23390 or D2 receptor (D2R) antagonist Raclopride had 
no effect (Fig. 1d). These results demonstrate that the PVT→NAc pathway transmits 
negative valence, and reveal an input-specific mechanism driving motivated behavior in the 
NAc.
Since activation of the PVT→NAc pathway evoked an aversive response, this pathway could 
be instrumental for the negative symptoms of drug withdrawal. To test this, we selectively 
silenced the pathway in two different models of opiate withdrawal and examined 
withdrawal-induced physical signs and place aversion. We utilized optogenetic terminal 
silencing by injecting an archaerhodopsin-3 (ArchT)-expressing AAV into the PVT and 
bilaterally implanting fiber guide cannulae in the NAc17 (Extended Data Fig. 4). Two weeks 
after surgery, mice were treated with daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of morphine in 
their home cage with doses escalating from 10 to 50 mg Kg−1, to develop opiate 
dependence18 (Fig. 2a). Two hours after the final morphine treatment, we injected naloxone, 
μ-opioid receptor antagonist (5 mg kg−1, i.p.), and confined the mice to one side of a two-
compartment conditioned place aversion (CPA) training chamber3. This naloxone dose 
evoked strong negative somatic signs and robust avoidance to the withdrawal chamber in 
morphine-dependent mice, but not in drug-naïve mice (Extended Data Fig. 5). Moreover, 
injection of naloxone in chronic morphine-treated mice elicited robust expression of c-Fos, a 
marker for recent neuronal activity, in the PVTNAc projection neurons, which were labeled 
by injecting of retrograde tracer CTB-488 into the NAc (Fig. 2b,c; Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). 
Remarkably, constant bilateral optogenetic silencing of the PVT→NAc pathway during 
naloxone-precipitated withdrawal suppressed somatic signs of opiate dependence and 
learned place-aversion (measured 1 and 7 days after withdrawal) (Fig. 2d,e).

 Opiate withdrawal in humans often results from cessation or reduction of opiate use, rather 
than blockade of opioid receptors, and this process can also be modeled in mice2,19. 
Spontaneous opiate withdrawal also evoked expression of c-Fos in PVTNAc projection 
neurons (Extended Data Fig. 6c,b). To measure aversive motivational states during 
spontaneous opiate withdrawal, mice were confined for 45 minutes to one side of a CPA 
training chamber 16 hours after each morphine injection. After 4 conditioning trials, mice 
developed aversion to the withdrawal chamber. We employed inhibitory DREADD (designer 
receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs; AAV-hM4Di) to selectively silence the 
PVT→NAc pathway during each 45 min CPA training trial20,21 (Fig.2f, Methods). Local 
infusion of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO, 3 μM) into the NAc before each CPA training session 
reduced the CPA score in AAV-hM4Di but not AAV-eGFP transduced mice (Fig. 2g). 
PVT→NAc pathway silencing had no effect on morphine-induced locomotor activity, a 
measurement of acute psychoactive drug effects7 (Fig. 2h). Therefore, activity in the 
PVT→NAc circuit is required for the expression of physical and emotional negative states 
following opiate withdrawal. Importantly, PVT→NAc pathway is not only for opioid-
withdrawal induced aversion, mild footshock and i.p. injection of LiCl also evoked robust 
expression of c-Fos in PVTNAc projection neurons, and silencing the pathway during 
conditioning suppressed the ability of either of stimulus to evoke behavior aversion 
(Extended Data Fig. 7).
Chronic opiate use causes profound neuroadaptive changes in the NAc22,23. The NAc 
comprise two major subtypes of MSNs, defined by the expression of either D1 or D2 
dopamine receptors (D1- or D2-MSNs). D1- and D2-MSNs are proposed to play opposing 
roles in mediating behavioral motivation and reward learning24,25, and synaptic plasticity of 
these MSNs appears to be causally involved in behavioral adaptations to drug addiction and 
chronic pain states6,7,26. Since the PVT→NAc pathway transmits negative valence and 
mediates opiate withdrawal symptoms, we anticipated that chronic morphine exposure might 
cause plasticity of the PVT input selectively onto D2-MSNs.
To directly examine morphine-induced synaptic plasticity of the PVT input onto identified 
NAc MSNs, we prepared brain slices from transgenic animals expressing fluorescent 
proteins under the control of the D1R or D2R promoter, with PVT neurons infected with 
AAV-ChR2 (Fig. 3a). To reduce experimental variability between slices, we measured the 
ratio of light-evoked AMPAR-mediated EPSCs to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 
(NMDAR)-mediated EPSCs (AMPAR/NMDAR ratio) in the same MSN. Consistent with 
our hypothesis, the escalating morphine regimen increased this ratio in D2-MSNs but not in 
D1-MSNs (Fig. 3b,c; Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). In contrast, presynaptic release probability 
was not changed in either type of MSN, as measured by the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of 
light-evoked EPSCs in morphine-dependent mice (Extended Data Fig. 9). These results 
suggested that chronic morphine treatment caused a change in postsynaptic function. One 
plausible mechanism of drug-induced postsynaptic change is the insertion of GluA2-lacking 
calcium permeable AMPAR (CP-AMPAR) in the affected NAc synapses27. Compared to 
other AMPARs, CP-AMPARs have a larger conductance and show inward rectification at 
positive membrane potentials. In morphine-treated mice, we observed a significant increase 
in the rectification index selectively at PVT→D2-MSN synapses, but not at PVT→D1-MSN 
synapses (Fig. 3d,e). Interestingly, the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio at BLA→NAc synapses,

 which are part of a pathway that drives reward-seeking behavior, was not changed by the 
same morphine treatment (Extended Data Fig. 8 c-e). Collectively, these results indicate that 
the morphine regimen strengthened the PVT input selectively onto D2-MSNs via synaptic 
insertion of CP-AMPARs.
If morphine-induced potentiation of the PVT→D2-MSN synapse is essential for the 
expression of opiate withdrawal symptoms, then depotentiating this synapse in vivo to 
restore its normal transmission should relieve those symptoms. To test this prediction, we 
employed long-term depression (LTD)-based in vivo manipulation of the PVT→D2-MSN 
synapse by photostimulating ChR2-expressing PVT terminals in the NAc at 1 Hz for 15 
min6,7,28(Fig. 4a). We applied this in vivo optogenetic LTD induction protocol in chronic 
morphine-treated mice, then prepared NAc slices to record photocurrents on visually 
identified D1- and D2-MSNs. Indeed, this light treatment reduced the AMPAR/NMDAR 
ratio, and rectified the AMPAR current at PVT→D2-MSN synapses to a level comparable to 
baseline transmission, but did not change the PPR (Fig.4b-e; Extended Data Fig. 8 f,g and 
9). Treating morphine-dependent mice with this optogenetic LTD protocol 45 min before 
naloxone injection (Fig. 4f) reduced the immediate expression of withdrawal behavioral 
symptoms and the aversive memory of the withdrawal chamber (Fig. 4g,h). This 1Hz 
optogenetic stimulation had no effect on the plasticity at PVT→D1-MSN synapses (Fig. 4b-
e). Together, these results establish a causal link between plasticity at PVT→D2-MSN 
synapses and the negative somatic and motivational states that accompany opiate 
withdrawal.
Complementary to previous studies that highlight the contribution of the PFC, BLA, and 
vHipp inputs to the NAc in mediating drug reward and their plasticity onto D1-MSNs after 
chronic drug exposure, here we show that the PVT input transmits negative valence and its 
plasticity at PVT→D2-MSN synapses is necessary for the expression of aversive states 
associate with opiate withdrawal. We further demonstrated that optogenetic restoration of 
normal synaptic transmission at these synapses effectively relieves withdrawal symptoms. 
Our optogenetic LTD protocol may inspire the development of novel treatments for opiate 
addiction involving deep brain stimulation to induce plasticity at relevant synapses29.
Methods
Animals
Male adult (5-12 weeks) C57BL/6, Drd1a–tdTomato, Drd2–eGFP and Drd1a–tdTomato/
Drd2–eGFP double BAC transgenic mice were used for all experiments10. All procedures 
were in accordance with the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for the care 
and use of laboratory animals, and were approved by Stanford University's Administrative 
Panel on Laboratory Animal Care.
Surgery
Stereotaxic injections were performed on 5-8 weeks old mice under ketamine and xylazine 
(100 mg Kg−1 and 10 mg Kg−1, i.p.) anesthesia using a stereotaxic instrument 
(BenchMARK Digital, Lecia). A small volume of concentrated virus solution was injected

 into the PVT (200 nl AAV, bregma −1.4 mm; lateral 0.1 mm; ventral 3.0 mm, with a 4° 
angle toward the midline) or medial shell of the NAc (500 nl RV-mCherry, bregma 1.1 mm; 
lateral 0.8 mm; ventral 4.6 mm) with a pulled glass capillary at a slow rate (100 nl min−1) 
using a pressure microinjector (Micro 4 system, World Precision Instruments). The injection 
needle was withdrawn 5 min after the end of the injection. For mice involved in behavioral 
experiments, a fiber-optic cannula (plastic one) was placed at least 500 μm above the medial 
shell of the NAc, and cemented onto the skull using dental cement (Lang Dental 
Manufacturing). Following surgery, a dummy was inserted to keep the guide cannula from 
getting clogged. Mice were allowed at least 2 weeks to recover and to express the virus 
before behavioral training. Rabies virus-injected mice were used 5 days after injection. The 
injected AAV led to the expression of ChR2, ArchT or hM4Di in PVT neurons extending 
from Bregma −1.82 mm to −0.94 mm (Extended Data Fig. 4), which covered the area with 
the highest density of PVTNAc projection neurons and the highest density of neurons 
expressing c-Fos in response to naloxone-precipitated withdrawal (Extended Data Fig. 1b-e). 
AAVs used in this study were produced by the University of Pennsylvania vector core: 
AAV1.hSyn.eGFP.WPRE.bGH, 1.76 × 1013 genomic copies ml−1; 
AAV1.hSynp.hChR2(H134R)-eYFP.WPRE.hGH, 3.35 × 1013 genomic copies ml−1; 
AAV9.CAG.ArchT.GFP.WPRE.SV40, 7.62× 1012 genomic copies ml−1, and by the 
University of North Carolina vector core: AAV8.hSynp.hM4Di-mCherry, 8.3 × 1012 
genomic copies ml−1. The G-deleted Rabies-mCherry virus (4.5 × 109 genomic copies ml−1) 
was produced by the gene transfer, targeting and therapeutics core at the Salk Institute for 
Biological Studies.
Behavioral assays
All mice used in behavioral assays were allowed to recover from surgery of AAV injection 
and cannula implantation for at least 3 weeks. Place preference training was performed in a 
custom-made two-compartment conditioned place preference (CPP) apparatus (30 × 25 × 20 
cm). All locomotor behaviors, including real-time place preference, morphine-induced 
locomotion, and withdrawal-, LiCl-, footshock-induced place aversion were recorded for 
15-20 min at 30 frames s−1 with a camera controlled by custom tracking software running on 
MATLAB (MathWorks). CPA score was calculated by subtracting the time spent in the 
aversive stimulus-paired side of the chamber during baseline from the time spent in the same 
side of the chamber during the test.
Real time place preference assay30—After connecting with optical fiber, mice 
infected with AAV-ChR2 or AAV-eGFP were placed in the CPP training apparatus for 15 
min to assess their baseline place preference. During the test, we assigned the 
counterbalanced side of the chamber as the stimulation side, and placed the mice in the non-
stimulated side to start the experiment. When the mouse crossed to the stimulated side of the 
chamber, it triggered 20 Hz laser stimulation (473 nm, 20 ms pulses, 7 mW per mm2 at the 
NAc) until the mouse crossed back to the non-stimulated side. Avoidance score was 
calculated by subtracting the time spent in stimulation side during baseline (without light) 
from the time spent in stimulation side during the test (with light).

 Naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal—Mice infected with AAV-ArchT or 
AAV-eGFP were allowed to freely explore both side of a custom-made CPP training 
apparatus for 15 min in order to assess their baseline place preference. Then, these mice 
received single daily injection of morphine (i.p.) for 6 consecutive days with doses 
escalating at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 50 mg Kg−1 in their home cage to develop morphine 
dependence. Two hours after the last morphine injection, mice received an injection of 
naloxone (5 mgKg−1, i.p.) and were confined in the counterbalanced side of the CPP 
chamber. During the withdrawal, a constant green laser (532 nm, 5 mW per mm2 at the 
NAc) was delivered through the cannula onto the NAc. We turned off the laser for 1 min 
every 5 min to avoid tissue damage31. Withdrawal symptoms were recorded for 20 min 
before each mouse was returned to its home cage. Physical signs (jump, rearing and tremor) 
were manually quantified offline. 1 and 7 days after naloxone injection, withdrawal mice 
were re-exposed to the CPP chamber and allowed to explore both sides of the CPP chamber 
for 15 min.
Spontaneous morphine withdrawal19—Mice infected with AAV-hM4Di-mCherry or 
AAV-eGFP were allowed to freely explore both sides of a custom-made CPP training 
apparatus for 15 min in order to assess their baseline place preference. Then, these mice 
received daily injections of morphine (20 mg Kg−1, i.p.) in their home cage. Sixteen hours 
after each morphine injection, mice received a local infusion of CNO (3 μM, 200 nl) or 
saline (200 nl) through the cannula into the NAc. 20 min later, each mouse was confined for 
45 min in the counterbalanced side of the training chamber. This entire procedure was 
repeated once per day for 4 days. 24 hours after the final training session, mice were re-
exposed to the CPP chamber and allowed to explore both sides of the chamber for 15 min.
LiCl induced conditioned place aversion32—Mice infected with AAV-hM4Di-
mCherry or AAV-eGFP were allowed to freely explore both sides of a custom-made CPP 
training apparatus for 15 min in order to assess their baseline place preference. Then, these 
mice were injected with saline (i.p.) and confined in the counterbalanced side of the training 
chamber for 1 hour before return to home cage. 6 hours later, the same mice were received a 
local infusion of CNO (3 μM, 200 nl) into the NAc 20 min before i.p. injection of LiCl (300 
mg Kg−1) and confined in the other side of the chamber for 60 min. This entire procedure 
was repeated once per day for 4 days. 24 hours after the final training session, mice were re-
exposed to the CPP chamber and allowed to explore both sides of the chamber for 15 min.
Footshock induced conditioned place aversion32,33—On day 1, mice infected with 
AAV-ArchT or AAV-eGFP were allowed to freely explore both sides of a custom-made CPP 
training apparatus for 15 min in order assess their baseline place preference. On the second 
day, after connecting with optical fiber, these mice were confined in the counterbalance side 
of the chamber for 15 min and received 10 unescapable mild footshocks (0.5 mA, 0.5 s with 
90 s inter-stimulation interval) while constant green laser (532 nm, 5 mW per mm2 at the 
NAc) was delivered through the cannula onto the NAc. 24 hours later, mice were re-exposed 
to the CPP chamber and allowed to explore both sides of the CPP chamber for 15 min.

 Morphine-induced locomotion—Mice infected with AAV-ArchT were habituated to the 
testing apparatus (36 × 36 × 20 cm) for two daily 30 min sessions before being subjected to 
the behavioral test on day 3. On the test day, mice were connected with optical fibers and 
received a single injection of saline or morphine (30 mgKg−1, i.p.). 5 min after injection, 
mice were placed in the testing apparatus for 15 min with laser stimulation (532 nm, 5 mW 
per mm2 at the NAc) alternating from off to on every 3 min. We compared the averaged 
locomotion velocity from two laser-on sessions to the mean locomotion velocity from three 
laser-off sessions.
In vivo optogenetic depotentiation
Two weeks after recovery from AAV-ChR2 or AAV-eGFP injection and cannula 
implantation surgery, mice received daily injections of morphine (i.p.) for 5 days with 
escalating doses of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 mgKg−1 in their home cage. For slice recording, mice 
were photostimulated for 15 min with trains of 473 nm light (1 Hz, 4 ms, 900 pulses, 7 mW 
per mm2 at the NAc) 20 hours after the final morphine injection. For naloxone-precipitated 
morphine withdrawal, the same light stimulation was delivered 45 min before i.p. injection 
of naloxone.
Electrophysiological recording
Procedures for preparing acute brain slices and performing whole-cell recordings with 
optogenetic stimulations were similar to those described previously34,35. Coronal 250-300 
μm slices containing the NAc were prepared using a vibratome (VT-1000S, Leica) in an ice-
cold choline-based solution containing (in mM): 110 choline chloride, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 7 
MgCl2, 1.3NaH2PO4, 1.3 Na-ascorbate, 0.6 Na-pyruvate, 25 glucose, and 25 NaHCO3, 
saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Slices were incubated in 32 °C oxygenated artificial 
cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (in mM: 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.3 MgCl2, 1.3NaH2PO4, 
1.3 Na-ascorbate, 0.6 Na-pyruvate, 25 glucose, and 25 NaHCO3) for at least one hour prior 
to recording. Slices were transferred to a recording chamber and superfused with 2 ml min−1 
ACSF. Patch pipettes (2–5 Mohms) pulled from borosilicate glass (PG10150-4, World 
Precision Instruments) were filled with a Cs-based low Cl− internal solution containing (in 
mM): 135 CsMeSO3, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 3.3 QX-314, 4Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 8 Na2-
phosphocreatine, 290 mOsmkg−1, adjusted to pH 7.3 with CsOH. Whole-cell voltage-clamp 
recording was performed at room temperature (22-25 °C) with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier 
and a Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices). Data were sampled at 10 KHz and analyzed 
with pClamp10 (Molecular Devices) or MATLAB (MathWorks). TdTomato-expressing D1-
MSNs or eGFP-expressing D2-MSNs in the NAc were visualized using an upright 
fluorescent microscope (Olympus BX51WI). A blue LED (470 nm, Thorlabs) controlled by 
digital commands from the Digidata 1440A was coupled to the microscope with a dual lamp 
house adapter (5-UL180, Olympus) to deliver photostimulation. To record light-evoked 
EPSCs, 3-5 ms, 0.5-2 mW blue light was delivered through the objective to illuminate the 
entire field of view. To assess the efficiency of pharmacogenetic silencing of synaptic 
transmission, we first co-injected AAV-hM4Di and AAV-ChR2 into the PVT, then prepared 
NAc slices containing the ChR2 and hM4Di co-expressed terminals from the PVT. Light-
evoked EPSCs were recorded from MSNs before and after perfusion with CNO (3 μM).

 All experiments, except those in Extended Data Fig 3, were performed in the presence of 
picrotoxin (100 μM). For Extended Data Fig 3, picrotoxin or CNQX (10 μM) was perfused 
onto slices, and drug effects on light-evoked EPSCs/IPSCs were measured by recording 
traces before and 5 min after drug perfusion. Membrane potential was held at −70 mV to 
record AMPAR-mediated current, at 0 mV to record GABAA receptor-mediated IPSC or at 
+40 mV to record NMDAR-mediated current. Amplitude of NMDAR current was quantified 
at 50 ms after stimulus, when the contribution of the AMPAR component was minimal. 
AMPAR/NMDAR ratios were calculated by dividing the amplitude of the AMPAR current 
(peak current, at −70 mV) by the amplitude of the NMDAR current. The paired-pulse ratio 
(PPR) was calculated by dividing the second light-evoked EPSC by the first with 100 ms 
intervals between the two. The AMPAR current was recorded at three holding potentials 
(−70 mV, 0 mV, and +40 mV) in the presence of D-AP5 (50 μM). Rectification index (ir) of 
the AMPAR was calculated based on the following equation: ir= (I−70/70)/(I40/40), in which 
I−70 and I40were EPSC amplitudes recorded at −70 mV and +40 mV, respectively.
CTB tracing and c-Fos histology
2-5 days after bilaterally injection of CTB-488 (0.2 μl, 0.5% in PBS) (Invitrogen, C-22841) 
into the medial shell of the NAc (bregma 1.1 mm; lateral 0.8 mm; ventral 4.6 mm), mice 
underwent naloxone-precipitated withdrawal, spontaneous withdrawal, footshock, or LiCl 
treatment. 90 mins after the aversive stimuli, animals were deeply anaesthetized and 
perfused with 10ml of saline (0.9%) followed by 10 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. 
Coronal brain sections (50 μm) were cut using a cryostat (Leica). Brain sections (between 
bregma - 1.2 mm to – 1.9 mm) were first washed in PBS (3 × 10 min) and then blocked at 
room temperature with 10% NDS/0.3% Triton X-100 (PBST), then incubated with primary 
anti-c-Fos antibody (Santa Cruz, SC-52G, rabbit polyclonal IgG, 1:2000 dilution) for 3 days 
at 4 °C. Brain sections were washed in PBS (3 × 10 min), followed by incubation for 2 hours 
with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000 in 5% NDS PBST) and finally 
counterstained with Hoescht (1:10,000, ThermoFisher Scientific). Images were obtained 
using a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope or a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope, and analyzed 
by an individual blind to the identity of experimental groups.
Statistics
No statistics were used to predetermine sample size. However, our sample sizes were similar 
to those reported in previous publications7-9. Statistical methods were indicated when it 
used, and statistical analysis of main figures are provided in Extended Data Table 1. All 
analyses were performed using MATLAB (MathWorks) or Prism. No method of 
randomization was used in any of the experiments. For ANOVA analyses, the variances were 
similar as determined by Brown–Forsythe test. Experimenters were not blind to group 
allocation in behavioral experiments, but CPA sore and locomotion were measured 
automatically by custom tracking software running on MATLAB (MathWorks). All animals 
that finished the entire behavioral training and testing were included in analysis. Data are 
presented as mean ± s.e.m.

 Figure 1. In vivo optical activation of the PVT→NAc pathway evokes behavioral aversion
a, Left: Cluster of retrogradely labeled cells was observed in the PVT 5 days after injection 
of RV-mCherry into the medial shell of the NAc (n = 7). Scale bar, 500 μm; Inset shows the 
RV-mCherry injection site. Right: magnified image shows the morphology of labeled 
neurons in the boxed area. Scale bar, 50 μm. D, dorsal; L, lateral; 3V, third ventricle; DG, 
dentate gyrus. b, Schematics of in vivo manipulation of the PVT→NAc circuit in behaving 
animals. c, Representative RTPP tracks illustrate light-evoked behavioral aversion in ChR2-
expressing mice (bottom, n = 10) but not in eGFP-expressing control mice (top, n = 8). d, 
Quantification of light-evoked aversion and its effect by intra-NAc pharmacological 
manipulations. Intra-NAc infusions of NBQX (AMPAR antagonist, 1.0 μg in 200 nl, n = 8) 
but not saline (n = 10), SCH23390 (D1R antagonist, 0.2 μg in 200 nl, n = 8) or Raclopride 
(D2R antagonist, 0.3 μg in 200 nl, n = 8) abolished behavioral aversion evoked by optical 
stimulation of the PVT→NAc fibers. One-way ANOVA (F(4, 37) = 29.61, p < 0.0001) 
followed by Post-hoc Tukey's test. *** p < 0.001. Mean ± s.e.m.

 Figure 2. The PVT→NAc pathway is required for expression of aversive withdrawal symptoms
a, Experimental timeline for b-e. b, Confocal images showing that naloxone-precipitated 
withdrawal induced robust expression of c-Fos (red) in the PVTNAc projection neurons 
(green) that were retrogradely labeled by injection of CTB-488 into the medial shell of the 
NAc (n = 6). Left: scale bar, 100 μm; Right: magnified image shows the boxed area. Scale 
bar, 50 μm. c, Percentage of PVTNAc projection neurons expressing c-Fos. Naloxone (gray 
bar, n = 6) but not saline (white bar, n = 5) injection evoked significant expression of c-Fos

 naloxone-precipitated withdrawal behaviors and CPA score. Light stimulation in ArchT- 
(green bar, n = 10) but not eGFP- (white bar, n = 9) expressing mice during withdrawal 
significantly reduces the number of jump, rearing and tremor events (d) as well as the 
expression of CPA (e). Mann-Whitney U-test. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. f, CNO (3 μM) 
inhibits light-evoked synaptic current recorded from postsynaptic MSNs (n = 5). Inset shows 
example light-evoked EPSC traces before (black) and after (red) perfusion of CNO. 
Wilcoxon signed-rank test, * p < 0.05. Scale bar: 20 pA, 25 ms. g, Spontaneous opiate 
withdrawal induced CPA was reduced by local infusion of CNO in hM4Di- (red, n = 8) but 
not eGFP- (black, n = 8) expressing mice, or local infusion of saline in hM4Di- (magenta, n 
= 8) expressing mice. One-way ANOVA (F(2,21) = 7.4, p < 0.01) followed by Post-hoc 
Tukey's test. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. h, Light stimulation has no effect on locomotor velocity 
in either saline (n = 9, p = 0.57) or morphine (n = 9, p = 0.5) injected animals. Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test. Mean ± s.e.m.

 Figure 3. Morphine-induced potentiation at the PVT→D2-MSN synapses
a, Image of a NAc slice from a D1–TdTomato and D2–eGFP double transgenic mouse (n = 
5). Scale bar, 50 μm. b,c, Example traces (b) and quantification (c) of light-evoked EPSCs at 
−70 mV and +40 mV show that chronic morphine treatment significantly increased the 
AMPAR/NMDAR ratio in D2-MSNs (saline/morphine, n = 13/16 cells), but not D1-MSNs 
(saline/morphine, n = 14/14 cells). Two-way ANOVA (F(1,53) = 12.58, p < 0.001) followed 
by Post-hoc Tukey's test. *** p < 0.001. For comparison, EPSC amplitudes are normalized 
to peaks at +40 mV. Solid dots indicate the current amplitude used for calculating the 
AMPAR/NMDAR ratio. Scale bar: 300 pA, 50 ms. d,e, Example traces (d, left), I/V curve 
(d, right) and quantification (e) of light-evoked AMPAR EPSCs at −70 mV, 0 mV and +40 
mV show that morphine treatment selectively increased the rectification index of AMPAR 
EPSCs in D2-MSNs (saline/morphine, n = 7/10 cells), but not D1-MSNs (saline/morphine, n 
= 8/9 cells). Two-way ANOVA (F(1,30) = 9.87, p < 0.01) followed by Post-hoc Tukey's test. 
** p < 0.01. For comparison, amplitudes of AMPAR EPSCs are normalized to peaks at −70 
mV. Scale bar: 250 pA, 50 ms. Mean ± s.e.m.
