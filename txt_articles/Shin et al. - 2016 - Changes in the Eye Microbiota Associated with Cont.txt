ABSTRACT
Wearing contact lenses has been identified as a risk factor for the development of eye conditions such as giant papil-
lary conjunctivitis and keratitis. We hypothesized that wearing contact lenses is associated with changes in the ocular microbi-
ota. We compared the bacterial communities of the conjunctiva and skin under the eye from 58 subjects and analyzed samples
from 20 subjects (9 lens wearers and 11 non-lens wearers) taken at 3 time points using a 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing tech-
nique (V4 region; Illumina MiSeq). We found that using anesthetic eye drops before sampling decreases the detected ocular mi-
crobiota diversity. Compared to those from non-lens wearers, dry conjunctival swabs from lens wearers had more variable and
skin-like bacterial community structures (UniFrac; P value � <0.001), with higher abundances of Methylobacterium, Lactoba-
cillus, Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas and lower abundances of Haemophilus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Corynebacte-
rium (linear discriminant analysis [LDA] score � >3.0). The results indicate that wearing contact lenses alters the microbial
structure of the ocular conjunctiva, making it more similar to that of the skin microbiota. Further research is needed to deter-
mine whether the microbiome structure provides less protection from ocular infections.
IMPORTANCE
As in other body sites (i.e., the gut, skin, and mouth), the eye has a normal community of bacteria which are ex-
pected to confer resistance that provides protection from invaders. However, the eye microbiome has been largely neglected and
is relevant to eye health and understanding eye diseases and to discovery of its functions. This report of a baseline study shows
differences in the eye microbiome of contact lens wearers in relation to those of non-lens wearers and has the potential to help
future studies explore novel insights into a possible role of the microbiome in the increased risk for eye infections in contact lens
wearers.

I
n culture-dependent studies, over 50% of swabs from the con-
junctiva showed growth of skin-like bacteria (mostly coagulase-
negative staphylococci, Propionibacterium, and Corynebacterium)
(1). Ocular bacterial communities have been studied using
culture-dependent methods (2, 3) and, more recently, with 16S
rRNA gene sequencing in healthy subjects (4) and in people with
eye diseases (5, 6). Using sequencing methods, additional bacteria,
such as Pseudomonas, Bradyrhizobium, Acinetobacter, Brevundi-
monas, Aquabacterium, Sphingomonas, Streptococcus, Strepto-
phyta, Methylobacterium, Enhydrobacter, Bacillus, and Ralstonia
spp., were detected (4–6). As in other body sites, the ocular mi-
crobiota is expected to play a defensive role against colonization of
pathogens in the eye (7). Despite being important in ophthalmol-
ogy, the eye microbiome has been largely neglected, and its func-
tions remain unknown.
In the United States, over 30 million people wear contact lenses,
nearly one-third of the ~100 million worldwide (8). Wearing contact
lenses has been identified as a risk factor for eye conditions such as
giant papillary conjunctivitis (9) and keratitis (10–12). The conjunc-
tiva of patients with vernal keratoconjunctivitis (inflammation of the
eye that involves both the cornea and conjunctiva) showed increased
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) levels in relation to those of controls (7),
supporting the hypothesis of microbial involvement and interaction
with host conjunctival epithelium.
While several studies have used culture-dependent approaches
to demonstrate bacterial contamination of contact lenses (13, 14),
little is known about the impact of contact lenses on the structure
and function of the microbiota on the ocular surface. In this work,
we compare the microbiota of the ocular surface of lens wearers
with that of non-lens wearers using 16S rRNA gene sequencing
surveys.
RESULTS
We obtained 7,010,096 sequences (paired end; Phred � Q20) with
an average of 21,569 reads per sample, yielding 11,750 operating
taxonomic units (OTUs) (11,700 OTUs without singletons) (see
Table S1 in the supplemental material).
The bacterial alpha diversity of the conjunctiva was signifi-
cantly higher in subjects sampled at the laboratory without anes-
thetic than was seen in the ophthalmologic practice, which used an
anesthetic eye drop (whole-tree phylogenetic diversity [PD],
number of observed species; P value � �0.001 [nonparametric
Student’s t test]) (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). Us-
ing an anesthetic eye drop significantly altered microbial commu-

 nity composition (linear discriminant analysis [LDA] score �
�3.0; see Fig. S1B) and structure (permutational analysis of vari-
ance [PERMANOVA] P value � �0.001; see Fig. S1C), as mea-
sured by unweighted/weighted UniFrac distances. In addition, the
use of contact lenses caused only minor changes in the conjuncti-
val microbiota of subjects at the ophthalmology practice (see
Fig. S2), supporting the idea of an effect of anesthetic. Due to the
apparent perturbation caused by the eye drops, we performed
further analyses solely on the 20 subjects sampled in the laboratory
without anesthesia.
A total of 250 samples obtained in the laboratory (116 conjunc-
tiva, 114 skin under the eye, and 20 contact lenses) were rarefied at
2,090 sequences per sample (see Table S2 in the supplemental
material). Notably, the conjunctival samples showed higher alpha
diversity than the skin under the eye or contact lenses (P value �
�0.05 [nonparametric Student’s t test]; Fig. 1). In the same se-
quencing run in which we sequenced the eye project samples, we
sequenced samples of the vaginal microbiota from different sub-
jects. The alpha diversity of the vaginal microbiota was similar to
that reported by the HMP Consortium (15), and the bacterial
diversity in the skin under the eye in our study was similar to the
bacterial diversity in the skin of the face reported by Bouslimani et
al. (16) (see Fig. S3A). We consider these good positive controls
and are confident in the diversity found in the conjunctiva and
skin under the eye.
There were no significant differences in bacterial alpha diver-
sity between the conjunctiva of lens wearers and that of non-lens
wearers (nonparametric Student’s t test; Fig. 1). The microbial
structures of the conjunctiva and skin under the eye were more
dissimilar in non-lens wearers than in lens wearers (unweighted
UniFrac, nonparametric t test P value � �0.001; Fig. 2A and B).
Consistently, the conjunctival microbiota of lens wearers was
more similar to the microbiota of the skin under the eye than was
the case with the non-lens wearers (unweighted UniFrac distance,
P value � �0.001) (Fig. 2A and B; see also Fig. S4 in the supple-
mental material). However, there was no clustering by subject or
sampling time points (Fig. 2A and B). Moreover, the conjunctival
microbiota in lens wearers was more similar to human skin mi-
crobiota from a previous study (15) than to that in non-lens wear-
ers (Fig. 3). Weighted UniFrac distances depicted on principal
coordinate analysis (PCoA) plots also supported these results (see
Fig. S4). Lens wearers also had higher interindividual variability in
their ocular microbiota than non-lens wearers (unweighted Uni-
Frac, nonparametric P value � �0.001; Fig. 2C and D).
The conjunctival microbiota of non-lens wearers was influ-
enced by gender (PERMANOVA P � 0.001; see Fig. S5A and B in
the supplemental material). Numbers of Acinetobacter organisms
and of members of family Enterobacteriaceae were increased and
those of Anaerococcus were depleted in the ocular microbiota of
female subjects compared to male subjects (LDA score � �3.0;
see Fig. S5C and D). Regardless of gender, lens wearers had a
skin-like conjunctival microbiota compared to non-lens wearers
(see Fig. S5E and F). Compared to levels seen with non-lens wear-
ers, the ocular microbiota of lens wearers was enriched in Pseu-
domonas, Acinetobacter, Methylobacterium, and Lactobacillus
(LDA score � �3.0; Fig. 4). In non-lens wearers, these were de-
tected at a higher relative abundance in skin samples than in the
conjunctiva (except for Lactobacillus) (Fig. 4), suggesting that

We compared the conjunctival microbiota with that in the skin
under the eye. In relation to the skin, the conjunctiva of normal
eye (non-lens wearers) had higher abundances of Haemophilus,
Neisseria, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Rothia, and Corynebacte-
rium and lower abundances of Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Sph-
ingobium, and Methylobacterium (LDA score � �3.0; Fig. 4B).

 However, regardless of wearing or not wearing lenses, Source-
Tracker analyses using the V4 region from data generated in a
previous study of the skin microbiome (16) showed that the con-
junctival microbiota of both lens wearers and non-lens wearers
had higher proportions of hand-like bacteria than of face-like bac-
teria (P � 0.0001; see Fig. S3B in the supplemental material).
There were no significant differences in bacterial diversity and
composition between the conjunctival microbiota and skin mi-
crobiota at different time points (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental
material).
Predictive functional profiling showed that the conjunctiva of
lens wearers had a higher proportion of bacterial genes related to
cell motility and xenobiotic biodegradation than the conjunctiva
of non-lens wearers. On the other hand, the conjunctival micro-
biota of non-wearers had higher relative content of genes related
to genetic processing and nucleotide metabolism (see Fig. S7 in
the supplemental material).
DISCUSSION
Wearing contact lenses is a known risk factor for development of
microbial keratitis and other inflammatory eye conditions (17,
18). Several researchers have tried to identify the causative organ-
ism of these contact lens-related diseases using culture-dependent
methods (1, 18). To the best of our knowledge, this was a pioneer-
ing study in identifying the structure of the microbiota from con-
tact lenses and conjunctiva of contact lenses wearers using 16S
rRNA gene sequencing. While mostly illustrated by results of
studies of the gut, the concept of colonization resistance, a protec-

 tive effect shown by microbiota against invasions of foreign bac-
teria, has been suggested for the eye (7). This would imply that
some impacts on the eye microbiota, such as those related to wear-
ing contacts, might decrease the resilience or self-restoring capac-
ity of the ecosystem. Although the data represent only 3 time
points, we found relatively high stability of the eye microbiome.
The healthy eye is constantly wetted by tears, which may provide a
constant chemical environment.
The bacterial diversity of the conjunctiva is higher than that in
the skin. Moreover, conjunctiva had an alpha diversity similar to
that of the oral microbiota (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental mate-
rial). These results are remarkable considering the antimicrobial
effects of tear compounds (19).
This study showed that the eye microbiota of lens wearers is dif-
ferent from that of non-wearers, resembling more closely the micro-
biota of the skin. The results are consistent with those previously
found with culture-dependent methods (20–22). Consistently, the
presence of Staphylococcus, Propionibacterium, Corynebacterium, Ba-
cillus,Micrococcus,Rothia(previouslyassignedtoStomatococcus),and
Pseudomonas in cultures from contact lenses has been reported (1).
We also detected members of other taxa in contact lenses, such as
Streptococcus, Methylobacterium, and Acinetobacter, and members of
families Oxalobacteraceae and Enterobacteriaceae at a relative abun-
dance of �1% in more than half of the samples. In addition, Strepto-
phyta spp. (chloroplast DNA, possibly an environmental contami-
nant) showed a nonsignificant tendency (nonparametric t test; P �
0.26) to be higher in the conjunctiva of lens wearers than in that of
non-lens wearers (Fig. 4; see also Fig. S5 in the supplemental mate-
rial). We would not have detected differences in the conjunctival mi-
crobiotabetweenlenswearersandnon-lenswearersinthisstudyifwe
hadincludedsamplescollectedfromtheocularsurfaceaftertheuseof
topical proparacaine hydrochloride anesthetic, highlighting the im-
portance of sampling microbiome sites with minimal perturbations.
The anesthetic may have diluted or washed away bacteria from the
ocular surface.
By comparing the microbiota of ocular conjunctiva to that of
skin under the eye, we found that normal Corynebacterium and
Staphylococcus skin bacteria were detected at higher relative abun-
dance in the eye than in the skin, consistent with a recent study
showing the distribution of skin microbiome by body sites (16).
Tear lactoferrin plays a role in reducing levels of Staphylococcus
epidermidis biofilms (23). However, in this study, we found that
Staphylococcus levels were lower in lens wearers than in non-lens
wearers. There are not many reports of studies using molecular
methods in the diseased eye. Lee et al. (6) studied blepharitis using
different sampling sites (eyelashes and tears), sequencing regions,
and platforms (V1 to V3 16S rRNA genes with Roche-454). Their
results showed that blepharitis patients (n � 7) had increased

levels in their eyelashes and tears in relation to controls (n � 4),
none of which were increased in our lens wearers. In addition to
the different sites sampled, their patients were older than ours (59
[� 16.6]-year-old patients in the study by Lee et al. and 26 [�
4.5]-year-old patients in our study). More studies are needed to
understand which are the opportunistic pathogens associated
with infections in lens wearers. Other skin bacteria were enriched
in contact lenses and in the conjunctiva of lens wearers, which
have increased relative abundances of Pseudomonas, Acinetobac-
ter, and Methylobacterium. Representatives of these genera are
considered to be opportunistic pathogens in conjunctivitis, kera-
titis, and endophthalmitis (24–26). Enrichment of skin bacteria
caused by wearing contact lenses suggests that contact lenses could
function as a medium to transfer skin bacteria to the ocular sur-
face. Alternatively, contact lenses may be exerting selective pres-
sure on ocular bacterial communities in favor of skin-like bacteria.
Given that people use their fingers (no matter how well
washed) to put in contact lenses, we tested whether conjunctival
bacterial OTUs in lens wearers originate from hands, and results
suggested that they do not. Consistently, evidence suggests that
transplantation of microbiota between body sites changes the bac-
terial population structure only temporarily (27). An experiment
in which lens wearers use or do not use sterile gloves to insert their
lenses would clarify the origin of the bacteria in contact lenses.
The different taxa in the conjunctiva of lens wearers are re-
flected in the predicted bacterial gene content, so the differences
are not redundant in gene content. We could reliably predict bac-
terial gene profiles (mean accuracy �0.99 � 0.03 standard devia-
tion [SD] for core/bacterial housekeeping functions; minimum
accuracy � 0.82 for membrane-associated functions) (28); fur-
ther metagenomic/transcriptomic research is needed to elucidate
whether bacterial gene functions confer reduced protection
against ocular infections.
Previous studies have suggested that the commensal microbi-
ota of the ocular surface could interact with the host in immune
system to suppress microbial pathogenicity (4, 6, 7), and the im-
pact of wearing contact lenses may affect this protective function.
Our report provides novel insights into possible mechanisms by
which wearing contact lenses increases eye infection risks. Further
research is required to determine if the risk is related to contami-
nating the lenses with bacteria from the skin of the finger or if
contact lenses exert selective pressures on the eye bacterial com-
munity in favor of skin bacteria.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample collection. The study was performed under IRB protocol S12-
03905 of the NYU Medical Center. Subjects seeking routine eye care at the
ophthalmology practice at the NYU Medical Center from October 2013 to
June 2014 were sampled from their left and right eyes. A total of 58 sub-
jects (40 females and 18 males) provided samples; 20 of those subjects
(including 9 lens wearers and 11 non-lens wearers) were followed longi-
tudinally, with biweekly samples collected for 6 weeks (see Table S1 and
Table S2 in the supplemental material). Dry sterile cotton swabs (Fisher
Scientific) used to swab sampling sites were immediately placed in sterile
cryogenic tubes (Thermo Scientific). Sites sampled included right and left
conjunctivas, skin under the right and left eyes, and contact lens (250 total
samples, including 116 conjunctiva samples, 114 skin samples, and 20
contact lens samples). Samples were immediately transported to the lab-
oratory on ice and frozen at � 80°C. A total of 38 additional subjects were
sampled once (including 16 lens wearers; n � 75) (see Table S3) in an
ophthalmology office after utilization of a 50-�l drop of topical 0.5%
proparacaine hydrochloride anesthetic. Negative-control swabs (n � 3,
with no sample) were also included.
DNA extraction and sequencing. DNA extraction was carried out
using MoBio (CA, USA) PowerSoil-htp 96 well soil DNA isolation plates
according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Extracted
DNA from samples was stored at �20°C until sequencing. The V4 region
of 16s rRNA gene was amplified by PCR using barcoded primers, as pre-
viously described (29). To rule out and control for possible reagent con-
tamination, reagents for DNA extraction and for PCR amplification were
also sequenced as controls (30). The amplicons were then pooled in
equimolar ratios and purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit
(Qiagen Inc., CA, USA). The pooled amplicons were sequenced on an
Illumina MiSeq platform (Genome Technology Center of NYU Medical
Center, NY) using a paired-end technique (2 150-cycle runs).
Data analysis. The 16S rRNA sequence analyses were performed with
the QIIME suite of software tools (v1.8) (31). The filtered sequence reads
(Phred � Q20) were used to pick the operational taxonomic units
(OTUs), with an open-reference OTU picking method based on 97%
identity to entries in the Greengenes database (v13_8). Negative-control-
derived OTUs were discarded from the OTU table using a filtration script
(filter_otus_from_otu_table.py) in QIIME. After the chimeric sequences
were removed using UCHIME (32), all communities were rarefied to
2,090 reads per sample. For comparison of levels of beta diversity between
communities, the unweighted/weighted UniFrac distances (33) were cal-
culated and PERMANOVA (34) was used to test significance. Linear dis-
criminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) (35) was used to detect unique bio-
markers by determinations of the relative abundances of the members of
the bacterial taxonomies. Predictive functional analysis was performed
using PICRUSt (28) with Kegg Orthology (KO) classification (36).
To determine the overlap between OTUs of the eye samples and OTUs
found in other skin sites, we used SourceTracker (37) with a previously
reported 16S rRNA gene data set derived from samples from human face
and hand (16).
The HMP data set (15) of 16S rRNA (regions V3 to V5) sequences was
downloaded from the NIH HMP website (hmpdacc.org) and was
trimmed to contain only the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene using
BioPerl (http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Main_Page). The 16S rRNA (V4
region) sequences from the skin of the face (16) were downloaded from
EMBL EBI database (ERP005182). The sequences from the Bouslimani
study and the V4-trimmed HMP data set were merged with sequences
from this study. The QIIME suite (v1.8) was used to pick OTUs from the
merged sequences using the closed-reference method. Then, all commu-
nities were rarefied to 1,000 sequences per sample to calculate bacterial
diversity.
