Abstract
Background: Estimating distant recurrence (DR) risk among women with estrogen receptor–positive (ERþ), human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–negative early breast cancer helps decisions on using adjuvant chemotherapy. The 21-gene
Oncotype DX recurrence score (RS) is widely used for this. EndoPredict (EPclin) is an alternative test combining prognostic in-
formation from an eight-gene signature (EP score) with tumor size and nodal status. We compared the prognostic informa-
tion provided by RS and EPclin for 10-year DR risk.
Methods: We used likelihood ratio v2 and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses to compare prognostic information provided by EP,
EPclin, RS, and the clinical treatment score (CTS) of clinicopathologic parameters in 928 patients with ERþ disease treated
with five years’ anastrozole or tamoxifen. Comparisons were made for early (0-5 years) and late (5-10 years) DR according to
nodal status. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: In the overall population, EP and EPclin provided substantially more prognostic information than RS (LRv2: EP ¼ 49.3;
LRv2: EPclin ¼ 139.3; LRv2: RS ¼ 29.1), with greater differences in late DR and in node-positive patients. EP and EPclin remained
statistically significantly prognostic when adjusted for RS (DLRv2: EPþRS vs RS ¼ 20.2; DLRv2: EPclinþRS vs RS ¼ 113.8). Using
predefined cut-offs, EPclin and RS identified 58.8% and 61.7% patients as low risk, with hazard ratios for non-low vs low risk
of 5.99 (95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 3.94 to 9.11) and 2.73 (95% CI ¼ 1.91 to 3.89), respectively.
Conclusions: EP and EPclin were highly prognostic for DR in endocrine-treated patients with ERþ, HER2-negative disease.
EPclin provided more prognostic information than RS. This was partly but not entirely because of EPclin integrating molecular
data with nodal status and tumor size.
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. About
80% of primary breast cancers are estrogen receptor (ER)–
positive disease. Patients with ER-positive disease receive
adjuvant
endocrine
therapy
after
surgery
that
markedly
improves their prognosis (1). A large proportion of patients
receiving endocrine therapy have sufficiently low risk to
safely avoid chemotherapy. Differentiating these patients
from
higher-risk
patients
who
may
benefit
from
adjuvant
chemotherapy
is
a
priority
for
breast
cancer
management (2).

 Multigene expression prognostic assays may be used to esti-
mate residual risk of recurrence following surgery and endocrine
treatment to aid decisions on the appropriateness of chemother-
apy treatment. The most widely used test is the Oncotype DX 21-
gene recurrence score (RS) (3). Other prognostic scores to esti-
mate residual risk in endocrine-treated patients include the
PAM50 risk of recurrence (ROR) score (4), the Breast Cancer Index
(BCI) (5), and the IHC4 test that is immunohistochemically based
and is combined with the clinical treatment score (CTS) to inte-
grate clinicopathological parameters (6). The amount of prognos-
tic information provided for early (0-5 years) and late (beyond
five years) recurrence varies across these tests (7).
The EndoPredict (EP) assay combines the expression of three
proliferative
and
five
ER-signaling/differentiation-associated
genes and is normalized by three housekeeping genes (8). EP
may be measured in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
sections by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR) in decentralized laboratories (9) and provides a score
that ranges between 0 and 15 after scaling. EPclin was derived
from EP by incorporating nodal status and tumor size to create
an integrated diagnostic algorithm for clinical decisions (8).
Both EP and EPclin were trained on a cohort of 964 patients with
ER-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–
negative carcinomas treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy
only (8). Thresholds for EP and EPclin to differentiate between
patients at low or high risk corresponding to a 10% probability
of distant recurrence (DR) at 10 years were set at 5 and 3.3, re-
spectively. Both EP and EPclin were shown to be prognostic for
early and late distant recurrence in the Austrian Breast and
Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG)-6 and -8 trials (10).
TransATAC, the translational substudy of the Arimidex,
Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination trial (ATAC), served as a
validation study for the Oncotype DX RS (11), PAM50 ROR (12),
and BCI (13) scores and as a training set for a definition of
PAM50 ROR cut-off values and for CTS and IHC4 scores (6).
Our aims were to assess the prognostic value of EP and
EPclin
for
DR
in
postmenopausal
women
with
hormone
receptor–positive,
HER2-negative
primary
breast
cancer
in
TransATAC and to compare their prognostic ability with that of
the Oncotype DX RS.
Methods
Patient Cohort, RNA Extraction
The ATAC trial evaluated efficacy and safety of anastrozole vs ta-
moxifen given for five years in postmenopausal women with local-
ized primary breast cancer (14). TransATAC draws upon formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples from a subset of women
randomized to the monotherapy arms. RNA was extracted by
Genomic Health Inc. (GHI) (11), and residual RNA was available for
928 ER-positive, HER2-negative women. For this analysis, eligibility
required hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative, chemother-
apy-naive disease where RS and at least 350ng residual RNA were
available. A pilot study was conducted that confirmed the suitabil-
ity of TransATAC samples for EP assessment (described in the
Supplementary Methods, available online). This study was ap-
proved by the South-East London Research Ethics Committee, and
all patients included gave informed consent.
Procedures
EP genes’ analysis by qRT-PCR was performed by Sividon, who
were blinded to all clinical data. Fifty to 100 ng RNA was used to
quantitate the eight cancer-related genes of interest (BIRC5,
UBE2C, DHCR7, RBBP8, IL6ST, AZGP1, MGP, and STC2) and three
reference genes (CALM2, OAZ1, and RPL37A). EP and EPclin
scores were determined as previously described (8). The prede-
fined cut-offs for diagnostic decisions corresponding to a 10%
DR rate at 10 years were applied to stratify patients into low- or
high-risk groups: EP low risk (<5), EP high risk (�5); EPclin low
risk (<3.3), EPclin high risk (�3.3) (8). RS risk groups were deter-
mined as previously described, where cut-offs of 18 and 31 in
the
National
Surgical
Adjuvant
Breast
and
Bowel
Project
(NSABP) B-14 trial cohort corresponded to approximately 11%
and 20% of 10-year risk of DR (3). In addition to these predefined
diagnostic cut-points, we compared DR between tertiles based
on the genomic assays to allow a more detailed comparison.
CTS was derived as reported previously (6) and calculated with
the prespecified algorithm: CTS ¼ 100x{0.417N1-3 þ 1.566N4þ þ
0.930(0.497T1-2 þ 0.882T2-3 þ 1.838T>3 þ 0.559Gr2 þ 0.970Gr3 þ
0.130Age�65 – 0.149Ana)}.
Study Endpoints
The primary endpoint was distant relapse–free survival (DRFS),
which was the time from diagnosis until DR. DR was defined as
metastasis from the primary tumor at distant organs, excluding
contralateral disease and locoregional and ipsilateral recur-
rences. Death before DR was treated as a censoring event.
Statistical Analysis
Our stepwise primary objectives were to assess whether EPclin
had statistically significant prognostic information for 10-year
DR in postmenopausal women with breast cancer given either
Tamoxifen or Anastrozole monotherapy. If so, we would test if
EPclin or EP added statistically significant prognostic informa-
tion to RS and whether EP/EPclin provided statistically signifi-
cant
additional
information
to
CTS.
Secondary
analyses
included determining the prognostic ability of EP and EPclin in
early (0-5 years) and late (>5 years) settings, in patients divided
into subgroups by nodal status, and the additional prognostic
information provided by tests in multivariable comparisons.
The statistical analysis plan was approved by the Long-term
Anastrozole vs Tamoxifen Treatment Effects (LATTE) commit-
tee and Sividon before data analysis took place and is described
in the Supplementary Methods (available online). All statistical
tests were two-sided, and a P value of less than .05 was regarded
as statistically significant. All statistical analyses were per-
formed with STATA version 13.1 (College Station, TX).
Results
Sample availability is shown in Figure 1. Values for RS, EP, and
EPclin scores were calculated for 928 patients. Demographics of
the population are shown in Supplementary Table 1 (available
online). A total of 128 DRs was recorded within the 10-year me-
dian follow-up period. In node-negative women (n ¼ 680), there
were 59 DRs; in node-positive women (n ¼ 248), 69 DRs were
recorded.
Univariate Analyses
Results for EP, EPclin, RS, and CTS are presented in Table 1. Both
EP and EPclin were highly prognostic across 10 years (LRv2:

 EP ¼ 49.3; LRv2: EPclin ¼ 139.3), with EPclin being statistically sig-
nificantly more prognostic than EP in all time windows and sub-
groups, except for node-negative patients in years 0 to 5. Both
EP and EPclin provided substantially more information than RS
in years 0 to 10 (LRv2: RS ¼ 29.1). EP had similar prognostic power
to RS in years 0 to 5 in all subgroups. In node-negative patients,
both EP and EPclin performance were very similar to that of RS
(LRv2: EP ¼ 15.5; LRv2: EPclin ¼ 17.0; LRv2: RS ¼ 18.7). In contrast,
in node-positive patients, EPclin outperformed RS. EP and EPclin
were superior to RS in years 5 to 10, where RS was particularly
weak regardless of nodal status (LRv2: EP ¼ 23.6; LRv2: EPclin ¼
59.3; LRv2: RS ¼ 5.6).
Figure 2 shows the DR rate over 10 years for each of EP,
EPclin, and RS for the overall population when divided into ter-
tiles of their respective scores. The hazard ratio (HR) for the
comparison between the lowest and highest tertiles of each
score was 4.72 (95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 2.78 to 8.02), 18.01
(95%
CI ¼ 7.87
to
41.19),
and
2.41
(95%
CI ¼ 1.59
to
3.64),
respectively. For EPclin, the lowest tertile had a DR rate of only
2.1% (95% CI ¼ 1.0 to 4.7) at 10 years while the highest tertile had
a DR rate of 31.5% (95% CI ¼ 26.4 to 37.4). Similar plots of EP,
EPclin, and RS score tertiles for the separate node-negative and
node-positive populations are shown in Supplementary Figures
2 and 3 (available online). EPclin identified a third of patients in
the node-negative population, in which only one of 227 patients
had a DR over 10 years, corresponding to a 10-year relapse rate
of 0.5% (95% CI ¼ 0.1 to 3.4). For EP and RS, the equivalent tertiles
had DRs of 1.5% (95% CI ¼ 0.5 to 4.7) and 7% (95% CI ¼ 4.2 to 11.5),
respectively, over the same time period.
Supplementary Figure 4 (available online) shows the contin-
uous relationship between EPclin score and the estimated 10-
year DR rate in TransATAC according to the proportion of the
scores contributed by each nodal group. In this cohort, about
half of patients (52.6%) with EPclin scores of 3.3 or higher (high-
risk) were node-positive; only 8.6% of patients with scores of
less than 3.3 were node-positive.
Multivariable Analyses
Multivariable comparisons are shown in Table 1. Both EP and
EPclin provided statistically significant prognostic value when
added to the RS across 10 years (LRv2: RS ¼ 29.1; DLRv2: EPþRS vs
RS ¼ 20.2; DLRv2: EPclinþRS vs RS ¼ 113.8) (Table 1). For EP, this
was because of its additional information beyond RS in five to
10 years only. EPclin added statistically significant prognostic
information to RS both before and beyond five years, except in
the node-negative subgroup of patients in years 0 to 5.
For the overall population, statistically significant prognostic
information beyond that of the CTS was provided in years 0 to
10 by EP, EPclin, and RS; however, it was greater for EP and
EPclin than for RS. Similar results were observed within node-
negative and -positive subgroups (Table 1). The better perfor-
mance of EP and EPclin in years 0 through 10 was because of its
greater prognostic value in years 5 to 10, where RS added no sta-
tistically significant prognostic information to CTS (LRv2: CTS ¼
64.7; DLRv2: EPþCTS vs CTS ¼ 9.8; DLRv2: EPclinþCTS vs CTS ¼
9.9; DLRv2: RSþCTS vs CTS ¼ 2.3).

 available online). These are similar to rates observed over years
0 through 9 in 1178 TransATAC patients in our earlier report of
RS’ performance (11). To compare directly the recurrence rates
in these categories with the low-/high-risk categories of EP and
EPclin, we pooled the RS intermediate- and high-risk groups to
create an RS non-low-risk group. More patients were stratified
to the low-risk group by RS and EPclin than by EP (573 vs 546 vs
386 corresponding to 61.7%, 58.8%, and 41.6% of the cohort). The
hazard ratio between the high-/non-low- vs low-risk groups
was marginally greater for EP (HR ¼ 2.98, 95% CI ¼ 1.94 to 4.58,
P < .001) than for RS (HR ¼ 2.73, 95% CI ¼ 1.91 to 3.89, P < .001)
and substantially greater for EPclin (HR ¼ 5.99, 95% CI ¼ 3.94 to 9.
11, P < .001) (Figure 3).
EPclin’s superior ability to classify patients as low risk was
further demonstrated by the similar number of patients classi-
fied as low risk by RS coupled with a substantially lower 10-year
recurrence rate (EPclin: 5.8%, 95% CI ¼ 4.0 to 8.3; RS: 10.1%, 95%
CI ¼ 7.7 to 13.1) (Figure 3). A greater absolute separation of the
DR rate was found between the risk groups for EPclin (23.0%)
than for RS (13.4%). EPclin performed particularly well at strati-
fying node-positive patients where absolute separation at 10
years for DR rate was 31.9% compared with the 14.1% in node-
negative patients (Supplementary Figures 6 and 7, available

For most cases, EPclin and RS categorization of risk agreed;
however, 117 (12.6%) cases were EPclin low/RS non-low and 144
(15.5%) were EPclin high/RS low (kappa ¼ 0.41, P < .001).
Classification by EPclin aligned more closely with the ob-
served risks: Pairwise comparison of EPclin high/RS low vs
EPclin low/RS non-low (HR ¼ 2.75, 95% CI ¼ 1.39 to 5.44, P ¼ .002)
(Figure 4). The Net Reclassification Index (NRI) for EPclin vs RS
was 17.5% (P < .001). In recurrent cases, the EPclin upgraded
three times more cases into high-risk groups than the RS
(McNemar’s odds ratio ¼ 3.00, 95% CI ¼ 1.16 to 7.89, P ¼ .01)
whereas for noncases upgrading/downgrading was similar for
these two scores.

 Discussion
In this TransATAC population, we found that both EP and EPclin
were highly prognostic across the 10 years of follow-up and
both scores also identified early and late relapse events. This is
in agreement with previous reports in ER-positive, HER2-nega-
tive patient cohorts from the ABCSG-6 and -8 trials (8,10).
Moreover, EP and EPclin were prognostic in all assessed
subgroups.
We also compared the prognostic information provided by
EP and EPclin with that of the widely used Oncotype DX RS. This
study is the first direct comparison of the clinical performance
of EP/EPclin with RS. EPclin, as opposed to RS, includes informa-
tion from clinical factors, making it more clinically useful but
also making fair comparisons with RS complicated. Therefore,
as well as direct comparisons, we conducted analyses to deter-
mine how much information was added by the respective
scores to CTS.
We found that EP was similar to RS in years 0 to 5 but was
superior in years 5 to 10. EPclin markedly outperformed RS
across the 10-year follow-up period and also in all additional
univariate analyses, except in node-negative patients in the
early time window. These findings suggest that: 1) In years 0 to
5, EPclin predicts recurrence better in the overall population
than RS because of the clinical components included in EPclin;
and 2) in years 5 to 10, the superior performance of EPclin com-
pared with RS is partly because of the inclusion of clinical vari-
ables in EPclin but also because of a molecular component that
predicted late recurrences better. The latter is also reinforced by
the very similar prognostic value of EP in the early and late
follow-up periods, in marked contrast with RS, where perfor-
mance diminished beyond five years.
EP’s overall better performance over RS might be attributed
to the differences in the training populations. The EP algorithm
was trained on a HER2-negative, mixed node-negative and -pos-
itive population, unlike RS, which was optimized on a mixed
HER2-negative and -positive, node-negative population. These
differences may explain the better prognostic ability of EP, in
particular in node-positive patients and in patients at risk of a
late relapse.
A previous analysis of EP components in ABCSG-6 and -8
trial samples showed that proliferative genes contributed to
early prediction and ER-signaling genes provided prognosis be-
yond five years (10). Recently, we reported our analysis of RS
components in ERþ/HER2- TransATAC patients that pointed to
the loss of prediction by the ER module as the main reason for
its weak performance after five years while the proliferation RS
module was prognostic throughout the 10 years (15). The differ-
ent behavior of the proliferation and ER-associated genes in the
two scores may be because of the different identity of genes
used and their weighting in the respective algorithms. Further
analysis is necessary to understand fully the differing behavior
of these prognostic scores.
The integration of nodal status into the EPclin score allows
the algorithm to be used in both node-negative and node-
positive patients, supported by the observed DR rates in the
populations identified as low risk in the respective nodal
groups. It was notable, however, that when the algorithm was
applied as a continuous variable in the node-negative popula-
tion it identified one-third of the node-negative population with
an extremely low DR of just 0.5% at 10 years. Categorization of a
patient in such a low-risk group could be highly reassuring. Our
earlier publication showed the differing relationship of RS with
risk of DR according to nodal status (11). The current data em-
phasize that RS should not be used in node-positive patients to
estimate recurrence risk without appropriate calibration of the
relationship of RS with DR for such patients.
Of note, a recent report from the TAILORx trial described the
very low risk of DR rate in patients with RS of 10 or lower (16);
this was, however, only over the first five years of follow-up.
Generally, patients in a low-risk group would not be recom-
mended to receive chemotherapy treatment because of their
perceived low recurrence risk. Previously, ABCSG-6 and -8 ob-
served 10-year DR rates by EPclin classification that were 4% in
the low groups for both studies, 28% and 22% in the high-risk
groups for the two trials, respectively (8). Our analysis showed
similar 10-year recurrence rates at 5.8% and 28.8% in the low
and high EPclin groups of TransATAC, respectively, in contrast
with 10.1% and 23.5% observed for the RS low and non-low
groups. An NRI favorable to EPclin indicated that EPclin classifi-
cation aligned better with observed risk than RS and therefore
provided superior risk stratification when compared with RS. If
results are available from both assays yet disagree with one

 another, more weight should be assigned to the EPclin risk
estimate.
Previously, the importance of integrating clinical and molec-
ular variables to create a more accurate prognostic index for RS
(17) and for IHC4 (6) was reported. The superiority of EPclin over
EP that resulted from such integration is probably best demon-
strated by the DR rates in the highest and lowest tertiles of the
respective scores.
Recently, GHI began providing an online Recurrence Score
Pathology-Clinical (RSPC) calculator for use in node-negative
patients that combines RS with clinicopathological variables in-
cluding age, tumor size, grade, and planned adjuvant hormonal
therapy. Tang et al. reported a greater separation of low- and
high-risk patients and reduced number of patients in the
intermediate-risk
group
when
classified
by
RSPC
(17).
Nevertheless, GHI recommends that RSPC should only be used
as an “educational tool” together with RS result to enhance the
understanding of the score in the assessment of DR risk (18). It
should be noted that while integration of clinicopathological
factors with molecular features greatly enhances the prognostic
power of risk assessments, this has not been shown to increase
predictive information regarding chemotherapy benefit (17).
Our study has strengths and limitations. Strengths include
the large patient cohort with long-term follow-up from a well-
documented clinical trial and well-characterized set of samples.
For this comparison, the same batch of RNA was used, reducing
intrasample variation. EP data was obtained by personnel
blinded to the clinical data and the results of previous assays in
TransATAC. Nonetheless, limitations included the low event
rate in ER-positive, endocrine-treated patients and CTS trained
on the TransATAC cohort, slightly overestimating its perfor-
mance compared with what we would expect in independent
validation cohorts. Generalizability of the results may be limited
by the analysis of patients from the United Kingdom only.
Additionally, an unintended sample selection bias might have
occurred as the assessment of samples for EP could only be per-
formed where larger amounts of residual RNA were available.
Although this might have been expected to relate to fewer
smaller tumors in this study than in our earlier report on RS (11),
the proportion of tumors 2 cm or smaller was identical at 67% in
both. By necessarily restricting the performance of the scores to
patients not receiving chemotherapy, this cohort is likely to be
biased toward lower risk in the spectrum of ER-positive patients.
Lastly, in a number of cases, multiple comparisons were made
and caution is needed in interpreting those results. However, for
our primary sequential objectives, all tests and comparisons
were highly statistically significant at the 1% level, even after
correction for multiple comparisons (nominal P value < .001). For
subgroup analyses, heterogeneity tests are more important (19)
and no heterogeneity was observed between subgroups.
In summary, this study has confirmed the independent prog-
nostic ability of EP and EPclin in postmenopausal women with
ERþ/HER2- primary disease. EPclin provided more prognostic in-
formation than RS partly because of its integration with node
and tumor size information but also because of a superior mo-
lecular component able to predict late events better than RS. Our
data highlights the importance of the inclusion of clinicopatho-
logical factors in overall estimate of risk assessments.
