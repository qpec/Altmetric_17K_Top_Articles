T
he safety and efficacy of the combined 
mifepristone and misoprostol regimen 
for medically induced abortion 
has been well established.1-3 In Australia, 
however, despite the availability of surgically 
induced abortion, a long history of legal 
and policy restrictions on the import of 
mifepristone prevented expansion of medical 
provision until 2012.4,5 That year MS Health, 
a subsidiary of Marie Stopes International, 
received approval from the Therapeutic 
Goods Administration to import, register and 
distribute mifepristone for a medical abortion 
up to 49 days gestation, and to register 
and train clinicians in service delivery.6 
Subsequently, the medicines were subsidised 
on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) 
for $38.30,7 and indication for use extended 
up to nine weeks (63 days).8
As a suitable alternative to surgery,1 a medical 
abortion can be effectively provided in 
primary care settings with appropriate follow-
up and emergency arrangements,9 enabling 
service expansion. This can potentially 
improve access and reduce travel costs, 
particularly for women in rural and regional 
areas. The treatment can be taken earlier in 
pregnancy, and women can safely undergo 
the abortion at home, and experience it more 
naturally as a miscarriage,10 options that 
women value and find acceptable.11 Recent 
data from England, Wales and France indicate 
that amongst women eligible for both 
options, a majority chose medical,12,13 and in 
the United States, this proportion is steadily 
increasing.14 
In Australia, the number of certified 
prescribers and pharmacy dispensers is 
growing, including in non-metropolitan 
areas.15 However, fundamental issues around 
access remain. Public service provision is 
very limited and poorly coordinated, and 
when available, restricted to a few facilities 
located in major cities. Most women rely on 
fee-charging private providers, and while 
Medicare (Australian public health insurance) 
holders can access a rebate, they still incur 
out-of-pocket costs. Service provision is also 
severely hampered by varying restrictive 
state and territory abortion legislation, which 
in certain jurisdictions, is not in line with 
current medical evidence and/or standards.16 
In the Northern Territory, for instance, the 
medical option is not currently offered, 
as the law permits abortions only within 
hospitals, preventing general practitioners 
from offering medical abortions within their 
community-based practices.17
In 2003, it was estimated that the Australian 
age standardised abortion rate was 19.7 per 
1,000 women.18 However, this estimate is 
unreliable as national statistics on abortion in 
Australia vary in reliability and comparability 
due to limitations of publicly available data,

Abstract 
Objectives: To examine access and equity to induced abortion services in Australia, including 
factors associated with presenting beyond nine weeks gestation. 
Methods: Cross-sectional survey of 2,326 women aged 16+ years attending for an abortion 
at 14 Dr Marie clinics. Associations with later presentation assessed using multivariate logistic 
regression. 
Results: Over a third of eligible women opted for a medical abortion. More than one in 10 
(11.2%) stayed overnight. The median Medicare rebated upfront cost of a medical abortion 
was $560, compared to $470 for a surgical abortion at ≤9 weeks. Beyond 12 weeks, costs rose 
considerably. More than two-thirds (68.1%) received financial assistance from one or more 
sources. Women who travelled ≥4 hours (AdjOR: 3.0, 95%CI 1.2-7.3), had no prior knowledge of 
the medical option (AdjOR: 2.1, 95%CI 1.4-3.1), had difficulty paying (AdjOR: 1.5, 95%CI 1.2-1.9) 
and identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander (AdjOR: 2.1, 95%CI 1.2-3.4) were more 
likely to present ≥9 weeks. 
Conclusions: Abortion costs are substantial, increase at later gestations, and are a financial strain 
for many women. Poor knowledge, geographical and financial barriers restrict method choice. 
Implications for public health: Policy reform should focus on reducing costs and enhancing 
early access.

and differences in record keeping across 
the states and territories.19 Since national 
abortion data are not routinely collected, 
abortion trends and reliable data on service 
utilisation and costs are not available. 
Consequently, it is difficult to assess the 
extent to which the expansion of medical 
abortion has provided women with a more 
accessible and affordable option. This 
study, conducted in 14 abortion clinics 
across six Australian states and territories, 
was conceived to fill this knowledge gap. 
It aimed to investigate the proportion of 
eligible women obtaining a medical abortion, 
women’s preferences for abortion type, and 
the direct and indirect costs. Additionally, 
we sought to explore factors associated with 
presenting beyond nine weeks gestation.
Methods 
We undertook a cross-sectional survey of 
women undergoing an abortion between 
November 2014 and April 2015 at any one 
of 14 Dr Marie clinics run by Marie Stopes 
International (MSI) in Australia. Study facilities 
were located in New South Wales (n=4), the 
Australian Capital Territory (n=1), Victoria 
(n=3), Queensland (n=5) and Western 
Australia (n=1). 
Women who were ≥16 years, presenting 
for an abortion on the day, judged able 
to provide informed consent by trained 
administrative recruiting staff and with 
sufficient English proficiency were eligible to 
participate. Clinic administrative staff were 
trained to determine eligibility and invite 
clients to self-complete a brief paper-based 
anonymous questionnaire in the waiting 
room, prior to their clinical consultation 
and payment of treatment/procedure costs. 
Consent was implied if a client returned a 
questionnaire. 
Clinic staff posted completed questionnaires 
on a weekly basis to the project coordinator. 
Each survey was linked to a clinic by a specific 
code. Double data entry was conducted by 
a specialist external data entry company. 
The study was approved by the La Trobe 
University Human Ethics Committee (14-073). 
Measures 
Data were obtained via self-report. The 
questionnaire (see the Supplementary file) 
was designed to be completed in about 10 
minutes. It included three main sections, 
namely (1) participant socio-demographic 
information and brief obstetric history (n=15), 
(2) data on current pregnancy, abortion 
decision-making and challenges in accessing 
the service (n=6), and (3), travel time, costs 
and financial implications of undergoing an 
abortion (n=11). 
Pregnancy and abortion characteristics 
included gestational age (in weeks) and 
type of abortion method (medical or 
surgical). We re-coded gestational age as a 
dichotomous variable (≤9 weeks, ≥9 weeks). 
We asked about preferences for method type, 
challenges in accessing the service, travel 
time (in hours), and whether this included an 
overnight stay (yes/no). 
We asked for data on direct costs of the 
chosen method. About 19.0% (n=436) 
did not answer the question. Since cost is 
dependent on gestational age, method 
type, Medicare usage and clinic location, we 
used this information, along with the clinic 
price list to calculate the variable. Where 
self-reported data were missing, we used the 
computed variable. The correlation between 
self-reported and computed cost data 
where both existed was high (0.95). We also 
asked for any indirect expenditure incurred 
for transportation and accommodation, 
childcare, GP referral, ultrasound and other 
laboratory tests, as well as lost wages. Three 
additional measures were used to investigate 
the financial implications of undergoing an 
abortion. Respondents indicated (1) whether 
and from whom they received financial 
assistance; (2) whether they had to delay or 
forego other payments to cover costs; and 
(3) their level of difficulty in paying for the 
abortion.
We collected socio-demographic data on 
birth year and country, Aboriginal and/or 
Torres Strait islander origin, and postcode and 
suburb. We recoded postcode data into the 
Australian Statistical Geographical Standard 
measure of remoteness (major cities, inner 
regional, outer regional and remote/very 
remote).20 Respondents reported whether 
they were currently studying (yes/no), 
employed (no, full-time, part-time, casual) 
and their current relationship status (married, 
living with partner, in a relationship, single, 
divorced/separated, widowed). We used 
the respondent’s highest educational 
qualification (≤ year 10, year 12, trade 
certificate, graduate/post graduate) and 
receipt of a pension/government benefit as 
primary income (yes/no) as proxies for socio-
economic status. 
Analyses
We fitted bivariate logistic regression 
models accounting for clinic clustering to 
determine unadjusted associations between 
hypothesised predictor variables and the 
outcome of presentation later than nine 
weeks. In the adjusted model, we included 
variables associated with later presentation 
at p≤0.20 level. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% 
confidence intervals derived from multiple 
logistic regression were used to determine 
factors associated with presenting later than 
nine weeks. Certain non-significant variables 
(p>0.05) such as geographic location were 
retained in the final model since its inclusion 
was considered important from a conceptual 
standpoint. 
Using the limited data available on age and 
abortion method for the general Dr Marie 
client population, we compared differences in 
age group and method proportions between 
respondents and non-respondents and across 
clinics. All statistical analyses were conducted 
using STATA® version 13.0.21 
Results 
Of the 9,903 eligible women, 2,326 (23.5%) 
responded to the survey. Women who chose 
a medical abortion were slightly over-
represented in our sample (29.3%), compared 
to the overall client population (25.5%). 
Amongst medical abortion clients, there were 
no significant differences in response rates 
across age groups. Among surgical clients, 
the response rates of women aged 35-39 was 
slightly lower than those in other age groups. 
The variation in response rates across clinics 
was significant (p<0.05), ranging from 8.1% to 
63.8% for surgical, and 10.3% to 87.1% for the 
medical group. 
Participant characteristics 
On average, respondents were 28 years 
old (Table 1). About three-quarters (75.9%) 
were Australian born and 4.5% identified 
as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander. 
The majority (72.4%) lived in major cities, 
and more than one in 10 (12.4%) were from 
outer regional or remote Australia. Over two-
thirds were employed (69.4%) and currently 
partnered (69.6%). About one in five had 
studied ≤ Year 10 (19.8%), but over a quarter 
(29.5%) had a graduate or postgraduate 
degree. Just over a fifth (22.5%) reported 
receiving a government pension or benefit 
as their main income. Nearly one half (49.1%) 
were nulliparous, and over a third (35.7%)

Access and equity of induced abortion in Australia
reported undergoing a previous abortion. 
Amongst respondents to the question on 
gestational age (94.2%), the large majority 
(83.8%) were within 9 weeks, and nearly all 
(96.3%) were in their first trimester.
Compared to the surgical abortion group, 
those who underwent a medical abortion 
were more likely to present earlier in 
pregnancy, be born abroad, be living in major 
cities, have a higher educational qualification, 
be married and have a Medicare card. They 
were less likely to identify as Aboriginal and/
or Torres Strait Islander, receive a government 
benefit as main income, and report a previous 
abortion. 
Type of abortion
Overall, 70.0% of our sample had a surgical 
abortion. Of those eligible for both options, 
approximately 35.0% underwent a medical 
abortion. One in 10 respondents (10.3%) were 
unaware of the medical option before their 
decision to terminate. Most women (93.0%) 
choosing a medical abortion gave a reason for 
their choice; three-quarters (75.4%) of whom 
stated that they wanted to avoid surgery, 
injections or anaesthesia. Almost one half felt 
that it was easier, simpler and faster (45.0%), 
that it could be initiated earlier in pregnancy 
(44.0%), and afforded greater privacy (44.0%). 
Of those undergoing a surgical abortion, just 
under two-thirds provided a reason (61.5%). 
The two equally common reasons were that it 
required only one clinic visit and that is was a 
comparatively faster process (63.0%). Women 
also felt that there were lower risks of heavy 
and prolonged bleeding (44.1%). 
Major challenges faced
Six of every ten (61.1%) women who 
responded to the question on challenges 
experienced in obtaining an abortion 
reported at least one challenge. Of this group, 
nearly a quarter (23.0%) reported having 
trouble deciding whether to undergo an 
abortion, 13.1% reported being unaware of 
the pregnancy for a long time, and one in 10 
didn’t know where to go. 
Travel and costs 
Around two-thirds of women (62.6%) 
travelled less than an hour to get to the clinic, 
however more than one in 10 (11.2%) had an 
overnight stay. Overall, a greater proportion 
of women who lived outside major cities 
experienced longer travel times. About 4.0% 
had their abortion in a state outside their 
state of residence.

p-values represent significance of difference between participants in abortion groups using Chi-square
Under 1% reported an abortion free of cost, 
and of this group, nearly half cited an external 
organisation as their source of financial 
assistance. An overwhelming majority had 
Medicare coverage (97.6%), however 5.0% 
did not use or were unsure about using it to 
subsidise costs. Among women who used 
Medicare, the reported median upfront cost 
of a medical abortion was $560, compared 
to $470 for a surgical abortion at ≤9 weeks, 
however the final out-of-pocket direct costs 
for the patient are the same. Without the 
Medicare rebate or PBS reimbursement for 
the cost of the medicine, the median costs for 
both medical and surgical abortions at ≤nine 
weeks roughly doubled. 
As women progressed beyond the first 
trimester, the cost of the surgical procedure 
rose at key gestational intervals, whilst the 
value of the Medicare rebate remained 
constant. For women who used the rebate, 
the median out-of-pocket costs for surgical 
procedures at 13-19 weeks and beyond 19 
weeks were three ($1,500) and 16 times

($7,700) greater than the median out-of-
pocket costs within the first trimester ($470). 
About 41% reported indirect costs related to 
travel and accommodation, GP referrals and 
medical tests, childcare and lost wages. The 
median cost for these additional expenses 
was $150. 
Financial assistance and implications
Participants were asked about difficulties 
in financing the abortion in two separate 
questions. About 22.5% reported 
experiencing trouble with financial costs as a 
challenge in accessing the service. Separately, 
one in three (34.0%) women reported that 
they found it difficult/very difficult to pay for 
the abortion. Just over two-thirds of survey 
respondents (68.1%) obtained financial 
assistance from one or more sources to help 
pay for the abortion. The husband/partner/
man involved in the pregnancy was the 
most commonly cited source (80.0%) of help, 
followed by a family member (16.0%). About 
64.0% answered the question on having to 
forego regular payments to cover abortion 
costs. Among them, just over a third (35.1%) 
had to forego one or more payments, most 
often for bills (71.2%), followed by food and 
groceries (35.5%). 
Factors associated with later 
presentation 
About 16.0% of respondents were 
undergoing an abortion after 9 weeks, and 
therefore no longer eligible for the medical 
option. In a multivariate model (Table 
2) adjusted for age, country of birth and 
educational status, we found that women 
who had to travel four or more hours (OR: 
3.0, 95%CI 1.2-7.3), who had no knowledge 
of the medical option (OR: 2.1, 95%CI 1.4-3.1), 
and who experienced difficulties in financing 
the abortion (OR: 1.5, 95%CI 1.2-1.9) had 
significantly higher odds of presenting later 
than nine weeks gestation. Also, women 
who identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres 
Strait Islander (OR: 2.1, 95%CI 1.2-3.4) and 
who received a government pension as main 
income (OR: 1.5, 95%CI 1.0-2.1) had higher 
odds of later presentation. 
Discussion
For women terminating early pregnancies in 
Australia, the option of a medical abortion 
has become more readily available in most 
states and territories. This study found that 
84% of our sample was within the gestational 
age limit for a medical abortion, indicating 
that they could detect a pregnancy early, and 
then obtain rapid access to an abortion clinic. 
Among women attending within nine weeks 
gestation, a minority (35%) chose a medical 
abortion. Since women having medical 
abortions were over-represented in our 
sample overall, this is a slight over-estimate. 
We hypothesise several reasons why 
fewer eligible women chose the medical 
option. First, clients undergoing a medical 
treatment have to return after a fortnight for 
a clinical assessment to exclude a continuing 
pregnancy. This final step may serve as a 
deterrent. A growing body of international 
literature22,23 comparing self-assessment 
versus clinical follow-up after a medical 
abortion suggests that self-assessment is 
as effective. Second, the subsidised price of 
the composite pill pack was anticipated to 
substantially reduce the cost of a medical 
abortion, making it a more affordable option. 
We found that for women who intended to 
use the Medicare rebate, the median upfront 
cost of a medical treatment was in fact higher 
than a surgical procedure. However, women 
choosing the medical treatment could 
subsequently claim back between $60-$90 for 
the consultation and ultrasound, making the 
out-of-pocket costs for medical and surgical 
options roughly on par. Third, compared to 
countries such as England and France, where 
medical abortion has been available for much 
longer, and is the preferred option, it has only 
been a few years since it has become more 
widely available in Australia. Additional time 
is needed for further expansion of services, 
and for women to become knowledgeable 
about this option and feel comfortable 
choosing it for themselves. 
Our sample had nearly universal Medicare 
coverage, and most women used the 
Medicare rebate to subsidise their abortion. 
A smaller proportion of our sample (7.5%) 
either did not have Medicare or didn’t use 
the rebate compared to reports from earlier 
studies in Victoria (13.1%) in 200424 and New 
South Wales (15.1%) in 1998.25 The Medicare 
subsidy, which reduced a first trimester 
abortion cost by half, is likely to play a 
critical role in improving access, particularly

for economically disadvantaged women. 
Nevertheless, similar to findings from the 
United States,26,27 out-of-pocket costs were 
considerable, including for early abortions, 
and particularly for the minority obtained 
beyond the first trimester. 
For one in three women, financial costs were 
not limited to the treatment/procedure alone, 
but included additional related expenses 
incurred. More than one in five women 
reported concern about meeting the costs 
of an abortion. A higher proportion (34.0%) 
expressed difficulty in actually paying for 
it along the way. More than two-thirds of 
our sample relied on financial assistance 
from others, and a minority delayed paying 
regular household expenses to compensate 
for the costs associated with undergoing 
an abortion. Taken together, these findings 
demonstrate the extent of financial burden 
that women undergo to obtain their abortion. 
Women who had to travel four or more hours, 
who had no knowledge of the medical option 
prior to their decision, and who reported 
difficulty paying had significantly higher 
odds of presenting later than nine weeks, 
as did women who received a government 
pension as main income and identified as 
Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander. These 
results indicate that the potential for medical 
abortion to improve equitable access to 
abortion services will remain limited unless 
knowledge, financial and geographical 
barriers to obtaining early care are adequately 
addressed. Since these data were collected, 
the option of a medical abortion via 
telemedicine has become available from 
MSI28 and Tabbot Foundation,29 another 
independent organisation. While women, 
particularly those residing in rural and remote 
areas will benefit from less travel, and be 
able to better protect their privacy, whether 
provision by telemedicine substantially 
reduces out-of-pocket costs for women 
remains to be determined. Internationally, 
there is increasing recognition that trained 
mid-level providers such as nurses or 
midwives can provide safe and effective 
abortion care,9 and if introduced in the 
Australian context, may help in reducing costs 
and expanding services. 
We acknowledge important limitations to our 
study. This survey was administered amongst 
English-proficient women at private Dr 
Marie clinics, and findings are not necessarily 
representative of the wider population of 
women obtaining abortions in Australia. Yet 
about one-third of abortions in the country 
are conducted in these clinics15 and therefore 
they provide a useful starting point to assess 
costs and the equitability of access. The low 
response rate and its variability across clinics 
necessitate that findings be interpreted with 
caution. The sensitivity of the topic and the 
vulnerability that many women experience in 
the waiting room of an abortion clinic is likely 
to have precluded better participation. As a 
self-administered survey, we had to contend 
with considerable missing data for certain 
variables. For instance, we were unable to 
assess the role of private health insurance in 
payment for abortion because more than a 
third did not report whether they possessed 
private insurance, and substantially fewer 
responded to questions about coverage 
for their abortion service provision. The 
overwhelming lack of response to these 
questions may be indicative of women’s 
own uncertainties around whether they are 
privately insured and if and how they can use 
private coverage to subsidise abortion costs. 
Despite these limitations, our findings have 
important implications. Almost one in four 
(23%) had difficulty making the decision 
about whether to undergo an abortion. 
Previous research on reasons for having 
an abortion have consistently indicated 
that women make this decision taking into 
account a diverse and complex array of 
personal, familial and social factors.30 We 
also found that undergoing an abortion, at 
any gestation, requires significant upfront 
and out-of-pocket expenditure, and poses a 
financial burden to many women. Increasing 
the Medicare rebates will lower the burden, 
particularly for women having abortions 
beyond the first trimester, who are more 
likely to be disadvantaged. Policy initiatives 
to improve availability and access to medical 
abortion have improved choice for some 
women, however abortion costs remain 
expensive. Like women in many developed 
countries,31 Australian women who are 
socially, geographically and economically 
disadvantaged, have limited choice and 
access to abortion. 
Conclusions and implications 
Future research evaluating the impact 
of telemedicine in promoting early and 
affordable abortion access will build on these 
findings. Policymakers should investigate (a) 
how to prevent more unwanted pregnancies 
and (b) how to overcome the barriers 
outlined in this study and increase the rates 
of women accessing services at an early 
gestational age, which would save both 
women and the overall health system greater 
financial and health burdens.
