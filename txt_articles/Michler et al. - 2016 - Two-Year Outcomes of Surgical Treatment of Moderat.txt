BACKGROUND
In a trial comparing coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) alone with CABG 
plus mitral-valve repair in patients with moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation, 
we found no significant difference in the left ventricular end-systolic volume index 
(LVESVI) or survival after 1 year. Concomitant mitral-valve repair was associated 
with a reduced prevalence of moderate or severe mitral regurgitation, but patients 
had more adverse events. We now report 2-year outcomes.
METHODS
We randomly assigned 301 patients to undergo either CABG alone or the combined 
procedure. Patients were followed for 2 years for clinical and echocardiographic 
outcomes.
RESULTS
At 2 years, the mean (±SD) LVESVI was 41.2±20.0 ml per square meter of body-
surface area in the CABG-alone group and 43.2±20.6 ml per square meter in the 
combined-procedure group (mean improvement over baseline, −14.1 ml per square 
meter and −14.6 ml per square meter, respectively). The rate of death was 10.6% in 
the CABG-alone group and 10.0% in the combined-procedure group (hazard ratio 
in the combined-procedure group, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.45 to 1.83; P 
= 
0.78). 
There was no significant between-group difference in the rank-based assessment 
of the LVESVI (including death) at 2 years (z score, 0.38; P 
= 
0.71). The 2-year rate 
of moderate or severe residual mitral regurgitation was higher in the CABG-alone 
group than in the combined-procedure group (32.3% vs. 11.2%, P<0.001). Over-
all rates of hospital readmission and serious adverse events were similar in the 
two groups, but neurologic events and supraventricular arrhythmias remained more 
frequent in the combined-procedure group.
CONCLUSIONS
In patients with moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation undergoing CABG, the addi-
tion of mitral-valve repair did not lead to significant differences in left ventricular 
reverse remodeling at 2 years. Mitral-valve repair provided a more durable correction 
of mitral regurgitation but did not significantly improve survival or reduce overall 
adverse events or readmissions and was associated with an early hazard of increased 
neurologic and supraventricular arrhythmias. (Funded by the National Institutes of 
Health and Canadian Institutes of Health Research; ClinicalTrials.gov number,

schemic mitral regurgitation of mod-
erate severity develops in approximately 10% 
of patients after myocardial infarction.1,2 Mi-
tral regurgitation is caused by the displacement of 
papillary muscle, leaflet tethering, reduced closing 
forces, and annular dilatation. Over time, the con-
dition has an adverse effect on the rate of survival 
free of heart failure.3 Because most patients with 
ischemic mitral regurgitation have multivessel 
coronary artery disease requiring revasculariza-
tion, surgeons have to consider whether to add 
mitral-valve repair to coronary-artery bypass graft-
ing (CABG).
The appropriate surgical management of mod-
erate ischemic mitral regurgitation at the time of 
CABG remains controversial. Some experts ad-
vocate revascularization alone for moderate is 
che-
mic mitral regurgitation, because improvements 
in regional and global left ventricular function and 
geometry after CABG can reduce rates of mitral 
regurgitation.4,5 Others support restrictive mitral 
annuloplasty repair at the time of CABG to di-
rectly reduce the degree of mitral regurgitation, 
thus preventing further adverse remodeling and 
decreasing the risk of heart failure.6,7 However, 
the addition of mitral-valve repair to CABG neces-
sitates open-heart exposure with an increased du-
ration of aortic cross-clamping and cardiopulmo-
nary bypass, which can increase perioperative risk.
The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network 
(CTSN) addressed this trade-off by conducting a 
multicenter, randomized trial comparing CABG 
alone with CABG plus mitral-valve repair (com-
bined procedure) in patients with moderate ische-
mic mitral regurgitation.8 At 1 year, there was no 
significant difference in left ventricular reverse 
remodeling (as measured by the left ventricular 
end-systolic volume index [LVESVI]) or in rates of 
survival or major adverse cardiac and cerebrovas-
cular events (MACCE). The combined procedure 
was associated with a significantly reduced preva-
lence of moderate or severe mitral regurgitation 
but a longer hospital stay after surgery, a higher 
incidence of postoperative supraventricular arrhyth-
mias, and a higher rate of serious neurologic 
events than was CABG alone. We report here the 
2-year outcomes for patients in the trial.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
The trial design has been described previously.9 
The trial was funded by the National Institutes of 
Health and the Canadian Institutes of Health 
Research. Patients with moderate ischemic mitral 
regurgitation were randomly assigned to undergo 
either CABG alone or CABG plus mitral-valve re-
pair using a restrictive annuloplasty technique. 
Randomization was stratified according to center 
and blocked to ensure the equivalence of group 
size. The trial was conducted at 26 centers with 
a coordinating center, an event-adjudication com-
mittee, and a data and safety monitoring board 
overseeing trial progress. The institutional review 
board at each center approved the protocol, and 
all patients provided written informed consent. 
The investigators vouch for the accuracy and com-
pleteness of the data and for the fidelity of this 
report to the trial protocol, which is available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org.
Patients and Interventions
We enrolled adults with moderate ischemic mi-
tral regurgitation and multivessel coronary artery 
disease. We performed preoperative resting trans-
thoracic echocardiography to assess the degree 
of mitral regurgitation using integrative criteria10 
verified by an independent core laboratory. Pa-
tients with any echocardiographic evidence of 
structural mitral-valve disease were excluded. (For 
details on exclusion criteria, see the Supplemen-
tary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.)
The protocol mandated the use of an ap-
proved rigid or semirigid annuloplasty ring for 
mitral-valve repair; the ring was downsized from 
the annulus diameter. CABG was performed with 
the use of standard techniques and was supported 
by cardiopulmonary bypass. The protocol specified 
the use of guideline-directed medical therapy.
Trial End Points
The original trial’s primary end point was the 
degree of left ventricular reverse remodeling, as 
measured by means of the LVESVI on transtho-
racic echocardiography 1 year after randomiza-
tion. All patients were followed for 2 years with 
end points measured at 6, 12, and 24 months. 
Secondary end points included findings on trans-
thoracic echocardiography at other time points, 
rate of death, MACCE (defined as a composite of 
death, stroke, subsequent mitral-valve surgery, 
hospitalization for heart failure, or worsening New 
York Heart Association [NYHA] class), serious ad-
verse events, degree of postoperative mitral regur-
gitation, quality of life, and rehospitalization.

tion on echocardiography at baseline and at 6, 12, 
and 24 months. The motion of each of 17 wall 
segments at rest was quantified (with a score of 
1 for normal, 2 for hypokinetic, 3 for akinetic, 
4 for dyskinetic, and 5 for aneurysmal), and the 
sum of the wall-motion scores for the myocardial 
segments was divided by the number of segments 
to provide a wall-motion index. A modified wall-
motion index was calculated for the inferior–
posterior–lateral myocardial region on the basis 
of seven segments that receive their blood supply 
largely from the right and left circumflex coronary 
arteries. (Details about the wall-motion score are 
provided in the Supplementary Appendix.)
Statistical Analysis
The trial was designed to have a power of 90% 
to detect a difference in the LVESVI of 12 ml 
per square meter from baseline to 12 months. 
We assumed a baseline LVESVI of 80 ml per 
square meter, improvements of 4 ml per square 
meter in the CABG-alone group and 16 ml per 
square meter in the combined-procedure group, 
and an equal risk of death of 10 to 20% in the 
two groups at 1 year.11,12 The primary null hypoth-
esis was no between-group difference in the LVESVI 
at 1 year.1 We evaluated the LVESVI at 2 years in 
an intention-to-treat analysis using a two-tailed 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test with an alpha level of 
0.05, which accommodated nonignorable miss-
ing LVESVI outcomes owing to death by assign-
ing deceased patients the worst ranks on the 
basis of the time of death. We calculated values 
for missing data for the 2-year LVESVI using 
multiple imputation and assuming that data 
were missing at random. Secondary hypotheses 
were tested at an alpha level of 0.01. We used the 
log-rank test to compare rates of MACCE and 
death and to calculate hazard ratios from Cox 
regression models to quantify relative risks. We 
used Poisson regression to test group differenc-
es in event rates and t-tests to evaluate differ-
ences in wall-motion scores between baseline 
and 2 years. We used chi-square tests to com-
pare NYHA functional status in the two groups. 
We assessed patients’ quality of life using the 
Minnesota Living with Heart Failure question-
naire, the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI), 
European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), 
and the physical and mental subscales of the 
Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short Form 
General Health Survey (SF-12) and analyzed the 
results using mixed-effects models.
Results
Patients
A total of 301 patients underwent randomization, 
151 to the CABG-alone group and 150 to the 
combined-procedure group (Fig. S1 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). The two groups had 
similar characteristics at baseline (Table S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). The mean (±SD) 
LVESVI was 54.8±24.9 ml per square meter of 
body-surface area in the CABG-alone group and 
59.6±25.7 ml per square meter in the combined-
procedure group. Concomitant procedures were 
performed in 19% of patients. In the combined-
procedure group, the mean annulus diameter was 
31.4±5.0 mm and the average ring diameter was 
27.9±2.1 mm; 93% of patients received a ring 
measuring 30 mm or less. Aortic cross-clamp 
and cardiopulmonary-bypass times were signifi-
cantly longer in the combined-procedure group 
than in the CABG-alone group (aortic cross-clamp 
time, 117.1±35.4 minutes vs. 74.7±36.7 minutes; 
cardiopulmonary-bypass time, 163.1±54.9 min-
utes vs. 106.8±49.7 minutes; P<0.001 for both 
comparisons). Eight patients in the CABG-alone 
group underwent the combined procedure, and 
3 patients in the combined-procedure group under-
went CABG alone.
Left Ventricular Dimensions and Function
At 2 years, the mean LVESVI in surviving pa-
tients was 41.2±20.0 ml per square meter in the 
CABG-alone group and 43.2±20.6 ml per square 
meter in the combined-procedure group (mean 
change from baseline, −14.1 ml per square meter 
and −14.6 ml per square meter, respectively); most 
of the improvement (−9.4 ml per square meter 
and −9.3 ml per square meter) occurred during 
the first year. There was no significant between-
group difference in the rank-based assessment 
of the primary outcome (LVESVI including death) 
at 2 years (z score, 0.38; P 
= 
0.71). At the same 
time, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction 
was 46.1±10.5% in the CABG-alone group and 
45.6±10.0% in the combined-procedure group 
(change from baseline, 5.4±11.7 percentage points 
and 6.4±11.0 percentage points, respectively).
Persistent or Recurrent Mitral Regurgitation 
and Additional Interventions
At 2 years, the prevalence of moderate or severe 
mitral regurgitation was higher in the CABG-alone 
group than in the combined-procedure group

(32.3% vs. 11.2%, P<0.001); only 2% of patients 
in the CABG-alone group and none in the com-
bined-procedure group had severe mitral regur-
gitation. During the course of the trial, two pa-
tients in the CABG-alone group underwent 
mitral-valve surgery after the index procedure, 
and two patients in the combined-procedure group 
underwent mitral-valve reoperation. The propor-
tion of patients with postoperative moderate mi-
tral regurgitation at any time within 2 years was 
significantly higher in the CABG-alone group 
than in the combined-procedure group (43.0% vs. 
24.8%, P 
= 
0.004). The proportion of patients with 
severe mitral regurgitation or mitral-valve reop-
eration was 11.4% in the CABG-alone group and 
3.5% in the combined-procedure group (P 
= 
0.02). 
In the CABG-alone group, patients who never 
had moderate or severe persistent mitral regur-
gitation and who had not undergone a mitral-
valve intervention had more reverse remodeling 
than those who did (LVESVI, 36.3±15.1 and 
47.8±20.8, respectively; P 
= 
0.001), with correspond-
ing results in the combined-procedure group 
(LVESVI, 40.9±20.6 vs. 51.7±19.6; P 
= 
0.02).
Wall-Motion Changes and Recurrence  
of Mitral Regurgitation
To explore the effect of revascularization on the 
risk of persistence of mitral regurgitation, we 
analyzed changes in echocardiographic wall-
motion scores, which were stratified according 
to the recurrence of mitral regurgitation. The 
percent improvement in the global wall-motion 
index was larger for patients who were free of 
moderate or severe mitral regurgitation at 2 years 
than for those with such mitral regurgitation 
(16.5±20.1% vs. 7.4±16.7%, P 
= 
0.008) (Fig. 1). 
The greatest degree of improvement in the over-
all wall-motion score occurred during the first 
year after surgery. The percent improvement in the 
inferior–posterior–lateral regional wall-motion 
score was greater for patients who were free of 
moderate or severe mitral regurgitation at 2 years 
than for those with such mitral regurgitation 
(18.1±18.9% vs. 7.9±17.5%, P 
= 
0.002).
Death, Adverse Events, and Hospitalization
Clinical outcomes at 1 year have been described 
previously.1 At 2 years, we observed no signifi-
cant difference in cumulative mortality between 
the two study groups, with 10.6% for CABG alone 
and 10.0% for the combined procedure (hazard 
ratio in the combined-procedure group, 0.90; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45 to 1.83; 
P 
= 
0.78) (Fig. 2A). At 2 years, there was no sig-
nificant between-group difference in the rate of 
MACCE (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.60 to 
1.34; P 
= 
0.58) (Fig. 2B) or in any of its compo-
nent events (Table 1).
In addition, there were no significant differ-
ences in the overall rate of serious adverse events 
between the CABG-alone group and the combined-
procedure group (84.0 events per 100 patient-years 
vs. 92.0 events per 100 patient-years, P 
= 
0.35). 
During the second year of follow-up, the number 
of serious adverse events increased by 21.0% in 
the CABG-alone group and by 18.3% in the com-
bined-procedure group over 1 year. This increase 
was largely related to infections and heart-fail-
ure events, but rates did not differ significantly 
in the two groups. At 2 years, there were 16.4 seri-
ous heart-failure events per 100 patient-years in 
the CABG-alone group versus 15.7 events per 
100 patient-years in the combined-procedure group 
(P 
= 
0.84). Serious neurologic adverse events, in-
cluding stroke, transient ischemic attack, and 
metabolic encephalopathy, were more frequent 
in the combined-procedure group than in the 
CABG-alone group (14 events vs. 4 events, P 
= 
0.02). 
All the neurologic events occurred during the 
first postoperative year, and half of all strokes 
occurred during the index hospitalization. In 
75% of the patients with stroke, the score on the 
modified Rankin scale was 3 or more, indicating 
at least moderate disability; 63% of the patients 
with stroke died. Similarly, there was a higher 
rate of supraventricular arrhythmias in the com-
bined-procedure group than in the CABG-alone 
group (24 events vs. 11 events, P 
= 
0.04), but all 
such events occurred during the first year.
Overall rates of readmission and cardiovascu-
lar readmission did not differ significantly in 
the two study groups. The most common rea-
sons for cardiovascular readmission were heart 
failure (53%) and placement of an implantable 
cardioverter–defibrillator or pacemaker (12%).
Quality of Life
The pattern of change in quality-of-life measures 
during 2 years of follow-up was similar in the 
two groups, with the most improvement occur-
ring within 6 months after surgery. There were 
no significant between-group differences in 
scores on the Minnesota Living with Heart Fail-

16.8±15.4 in the CABG-alone group and 15.3±14.8 
in the combined-procedure group, on a scale of 
0 to 58, with higher scores indicating better

or Severe Mitral Regurgitation.
Shown are the results of analyses of each of 17 wall segments at rest for patients without moderate or severe mitral 
regurgitation and those with moderate or severe mitral regurgitation at 2 years after the procedure. Baseline values 
were recorded before the procedure. The values in parentheses are the mean wall‑motion scores at three time 
points for each segment. Scores on the wall‑motion index are as follows: 1, normal; 2, hypokinetic; 3, akinetic;

the number of segments to provide a wall‑motion index. At 2 years, the relative percent improvement in the global 
wall‑motion index was larger for patients free of moderate or severe mitral regurgitation than for those with mitral 
regurgitation (16.5±20.1% vs. 7.4±16.7%, P = 0.008). A chart showing the name of each numbered segment is pro‑

Discussion
In this 2-year trial, we evaluated two types of 
surgical treatment for patients with moderate 
ischemic mitral regurgitation associated with 
multivessel coronary artery disease. At baseline, 
the patients had abnormal regional left ventricu-
lar function, which was more pronounced in the 
inferior–posterior–lateral region, an area that is 
perfused by the right or left circumflex coronary 
artery. Overall, surgical revascularization with 
or without mitral-valve repair typically results in 
significant improvements in ventricular func-
tion, as measured by means of the LVESVI, ejec-
tion fraction, and global and regional wall mo-
tion. However, at 2 years, patients who underwent 
CABG alone had a rate of postoperative moder-
ate or severe mitral regurgitation that was three 
times the rate among patients who underwent 
both CABG and mitral-valve repair. Independent 
of treatment group, patients with postoperative 
mitral regurgitation had significantly less reverse 
remodeling than those without such mitral re-
gurgitation. Moreover, the absence of postopera-
tive mitral regurgitation was associated with the 
greatest improvement in global and regional 
wall-motion scores at 2 years.
Improvement in global and regional wall mo-
tion and reverse left ventricular remodeling after 
revascularization are indicative of viable myocar-
dium. Successful revascularization can also be fa-
vorable to mitral-valve function in patients with 
ischemic mitral regurgitation in relation to the 
attendant decrease in left ventricular size, in-
creased mitral-valve closing forces, improved 
papillary-muscle synchrony, and enhanced con-
tractility of subjacent myocardium.13-15 In this 
trial, improvements in both global and regional 
wall-motion scores were associated with signifi-
cantly less moderate or severe mitral regurgita-
tion at 2 years — in other words, a more durable 
and successful outcome.
These findings imply that many patients who 
were enrolled in this trial had mitral regurgita-
tion that was caused by reversible ischemia rather 
than by nonviable scar formation. Therefore, sur-
gical decision making could be improved by iden-
tifying which patients are most likely to have an 
improvement in regional wall motion and global 
left ventricular function after revascularization. 
Further investigation is required to determine 
whether patients with baseline abnormalities in 
inferior–posterior–lateral wall motion that are 
considered to be irreversible from infarction 
(e.g., on the basis of viability testing) would ben-
efit more from mitral-valve repair than from re-
vascularization. Larger trials that use viability

CABG denotes coronary‑artery bypass grafting, LVAD left ventricular assist device, MACCE major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular event, NA not applicable, and NYHA New York Heart Association.
†  
During the period from 1 year to 2 years, the number of patients includes all those with MACCE, which was defined as death, stroke, subsequent mitral‑valve surgery, hospitalization for heart failure, 
or worsening New York Heart Association class. Excluded from the number of patients who were evaluated were patients who died, withdrew, or were lost to follow‑up by 1 year. Several patients had 
events both before and after 1 year. In the CABG‑alone group, 10 of 14 patients with worsening NYHA class had their first event after 1 year, 2 of 6 patients were readmitted to the hospital for heart 
failure for the first time after 1 year, and 13 of 24 with MACCE had their first event after 1 year. In the combined‑procedure group, the numbers of patients were 6 of 12 for worsening NYHA 
class, 4 of 6 for hospital readmission, and 11 of 19 with MACCE. In the combined‑procedure group, 1 patient received an LVAD during year 1 and underwent heart transplantation in year 2.
‡  
Changes in the NYHA class were evaluated in 117 patients in the CABG group and in 127 patients in the combined‑procedure group at 1 year and in 100 patients and 115 patients, respectively, at 2 years.

ing or positron-emission tomography are needed.4
Studies of measurement of mitral-valve tethering 
and left ventricular geometry are also under way 
to address this question. The favorable contribu-
tion of beta-blockers and cardiac resynchroni-
zation to this approach should also be empha-
sized.16,17
At 2-year follow-up, the significantly higher 
frequency of postoperative moderate or severe 
mitral regurgitation among patients in the CABG-
alone group did not translate into a higher risk 
of death than among those who underwent the 
combined procedure (10.6% and 10.0%, respec-
tively). Few additional deaths occurred in the 
second year in the two study groups, and the 
overall rate of death was consistent with results 
that have been published previously.18 We also 
observed no significant differences in the rates 
of MACCE, overall serious adverse events, or 
hospital readmission, including cardiovascular 
readmission. Studies have shown that one of the 
adverse consequences of persistent mitral regur-
gitation is worsening heart failure,3 an outcome 
observed in the CTSN trial involving patients 
with severe ischemic mitral regurgitation. In that 
trial, the group that underwent mitral-valve re-

Shown are the mean scores on the Medical Outcomes Study 12‑Item Short‑Form General Health Survey (SF‑12) for 
physical health (Panel A) and mental health (Panel B) for patients undergoing either CABG alone or CABG plus mi‑
tral‑valve repair. The SF‑12 scale ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health. Panel C shows 
mean scores on the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire; scores can range from 0 to 105, with higher 
scores indicating a lower quality of life. Panel D shows mean scores on the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI), on 
which scores range from 0 to 58, with higher scores indicating a better activity level. On these measures of quality 
of life, the only significant between‑group difference was on the DASI (P = 0.02).

Surgical Treatment of Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation
pair had higher rates of persistent mitral regur-
gitation, heart-failure events, and cardiovascular 
readmissions than the group that underwent mi-
tral-valve replacement.19 However, among patients 
with moderate mitral regurgitation in our current 
trial, we did not find an excess hazard of more 
postoperative heart-failure events, an outcome 
that can probably be attributed to the relatively 
small proportion (1%) of patients who had pro-
gression to severe mitral regurgitation at 2 years. 
The combined procedure involved more compli-
cated surgery, which was associated with longer 
bypass times and an increased risk of emboliza-
tion, which may explain the higher rate of serious 
composite neurologic events in this group. More-
over, the atrial incision that is required for mi-
tral-valve exposure may have predisposed the 
patients to more supraventricular arrhythmias and 
an additional risk of thromboembolism.
Measurements of overall quality of life and 
heart-failure symptoms improved in the two study 
groups. The change in the DASI score, which 
captures self-reported exercise capacity, also 
showed substantial improvement in the two 
groups during the first 12 months. However, dur-
ing the second year, the scores for the two groups 
diverged, which indicated an overall improve-
ment in the mean DASI score for the combined-
procedure group. The observed between-group 
difference at 24 months was 5.3 points, a clini-
cally meaningful improvement that is similar in 
direction to the increase in peak myocardial oxy-
gen consumption noted on exercise testing after 
CABG plus mitral-valve repair, as compared with 
CABG alone, that was reported in a smaller, ran-
domized trial involving patients with moderate 
mitral regurgitation.7,20,21
The current trial has several limitations. First, 
the primary end point was an echocardiographic 
measure of left ventricular remodeling, not a clini-
cal outcome such as MACCE or survival. However, 
a randomized trial with an end point of death or 
MACCE at 1 year or 2 years would have required 
the enrollment of thousands of patients. On the 
other hand, there is strong evidence of an asso-
ciation between the LVESVI and clinical outcome, 
including NYHA class and rates of hospitalization 
and survival.22 Second, although we did not 
specify preoperative evaluation of myocardial vi-
ability, echocardiographic assessment of region-
al and global left ventricular systolic function can 
predict the effectiveness of revascularization in 
specific patient populations.23-25 Lastly, the time 
horizon for observations was relatively short. 
Additional events would be captured with longer 
follow-up in these patient cohorts.
In conclusion, the addition of mitral-valve 
repair to CABG had no incremental effect on 
reverse left ventricular remodeling at 2 years. 
However, patients who underwent CABG alone 
had a higher prevalence of postoperative moder-
ate or severe mitral regurgitation than did those 
who underwent the combined procedure, although 
this difference did not translate into higher rates 
of death, MACCE, serious adverse events (includ-
ing heart failure), or readmission during 2 years 
of follow-up. Patients who underwent CABG 
plus mitral-valve repair had higher DASI scores 
at 2 years, indicative of improved exercise capac-
ity. Nevertheless, the addition of mitral-valve re-
pair was associated with longer cross-clamp or 
bypass times, a longer postoperative length of stay 
during the index hospitalization, and signifi-
cantly higher rates of serious neurologic events 
and supraventricular arrhythmias. Individual treat-
ment decisions require balancing the risks of these 
adverse perioperative events against the uncertain 
benefits of a lower incidence of postoperative mod-
erate or severe mitral regurgitation. Effective revas-
cularization, as reflected in improved regional and 
global left ventricular function, plays an important 
role independent of mitral-valve repair.
