Abstract
Aims/hypothesis The relative contribution of increasing inci-
dence and declining mortality to increasing prevalence of type
2 diabetes in Scotland is unclear. Trends in incidence and
mortality rates are described for type 2 diabetes in Scotland
between 2004 and 2013 by age, sex and socioeconomic
deprivation.
Methods Data for incident and prevalent cases of type 2 dia-
betes were obtained from the Scottish national diabetes regis-
ter with number of deaths identified from linkage to mortality
records. Population size and death data for Scotland by age,
sex and socioeconomic deprivation were obtained from
National Records of Scotland. Age- and sex-specific inci-
dence and mortality rates stratified by year and deciles of
socioeconomic status were calculated using Poisson models.
Results There were 180,290 incident cases of type 2 diabetes
in Scotland between 2004 and 2013. Overall, incidence of
type 2 diabetes remained stable over time and was 4.88
(95% CI 4.84, 4.90) and 3.33 (3.28, 3.32) per 1000 in men
and women, respectively. However, incidence increased
among young men, remained stable in young women, and
declined in older men and women. Incidence rates declined
in all socioeconomic groups but increased after 2008 in the
most deprived groups. Standardised mortality ratios associat-
ed with diabetes, adjusted for age and socioeconomic group,
were 1.38 (1.36, 1.41) in men and 1.49 (1.45, 1.52) in women,
and remained constant over time.
Conclusions/interpretation Incidence of type 2 diabetes has
stabilised in recent years suggesting that increasing prevalence
may be primarily attributed to declining mortality. Prevention
of type 2 diabetes remains important, particularly among
socioeconomically deprived populations.

 implications of these trends are likely to be substantial with
recent estimates from the International Diabetes Federation
suggesting that European countries spent approximately
USD 156 billion on diabetes healthcare in 2015, a figure
projected to increase to USD 174 billion by 2040 [1].
The prevalence of all types of diabetes increased from
3.2% to 5.1% in Scotland between 2004 and 2013 [2]. In
populations with stable distributions of demographic charac-
teristics, time trends in prevalence of diabetes are influenced
by the balance between changes in incidence and mortality.
An understanding of recent trends in type 2 diabetes incidence
and mortality is necessary to assess health inequalities, to
evaluate existing approaches and to plan new approaches for
both the prevention and treatment of diabetes.
To achieve the greatest reductions in absolute incidence
and mortality, interventions need to target the populations at
highest risk. This requires an understanding of whether trends
in incidence and mortality are consistent across age, sex and
socioeconomic groups. Previous studies have reported higher
incidence and mortality among men and the most deprived
socioeconomic groups but contemporary data are lacking, par-
ticularly in Scotland [3–5]. It is not clear whether the intensi-
fication of risk factor management during the last decade
among people with type 2 diabetes has reduced disparities in
type 2 diabetes mortality across different groups.
The aim of this work was to describe the contribution of
changes in incidence and mortality rates to increasing preva-
lence of type 2 diabetes in Scotland between 2004 and 2013,
and to investigate whether trends were similar across age, sex
and socioeconomic groups.
Methods
Data sources Population-based data for people with diag-
nosed diabetes in Scotland were obtained from a 2014 extract
of the Scottish Care Information-Diabetes (SCI-Diabetes) da-
tabase. Briefly, this database was established at a national
level in 2000, and contains demographic and clinical data
relevant to diabetes care. It is populated by daily downloads
from primary and secondary care databases across Scotland
with increasing completeness since 2004. As of 2012, data
from all of the 997 general practices in Scotland have been
included in the SCI-Diabetes database. A validation study
among the subset of people with diabetes mentioned on a
hospital record in 2007 found that 99% were included in the
diabetes register [6]. Within the SCI-Diabetes database, dia-
betes type is available as a clinician-recorded variable.
Following a diagnosis of diabetes (type 1, type 2, MODY,
gestational, etc.), clinicians record diabetes type using a
drop-down menu within electronic health records. In primary
care, these are coded using the Read code system. To improve
the accuracy of this variable for research purposes, an
algorithm which combines information from the clinician-
recorded diabetes type variable and prescription data is used.
More specifically, patients are assigned to a diabetes type
based on their use of sulfonylureas for longer than a year
and/or the timing of insulin use in relation to diagnosis date,
in combination with the clinician-recorded variable. We chose
to use sulfonylureas because of the increasing use of other
classes of non-insulin glucose lowering drugs in people with
type 1 diabetes. The use of this algorithm results in a 1.5%
increase in the number of people defined as having type
2 diabetes from the original clinician-recorded variable, pri-
marily through the reclassification of people who had a re-
cording of ‘unknown diabetes’ or ‘type 1 diabetes’ [7].
Incidence of type 2 diabetes was estimated by age, sex,
Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) decile and
calendar year using population denominators based on num-
bers of people without diabetes, identified by subtraction of
the numbers of people with diabetes from total population
estimates. Mid-year population estimates and numbers of
deaths each year (2004–2013), age in one-year classes, sex
and deciles of SIMD were obtained from National Records
Scotland (NRS). The mid-year population was used as an
estimate of the person-years in the population for each year.
The SIMD is an area-based measure of socioeconomic status
that uses information from seven domains including income,
education and crime to assign deprivation scores to 6505 data-
zones across Scotland [8]. These data-zones are ranked ac-
cording to their deprivation score and divided using deciles,
with decile 1 representing the 10% most deprived areas and
decile 10 representing the 10% least deprived areas.
Follow-up time for people with type 2 diabetes was calcu-
lated from date of diagnosis of diabetes until date of death or
31st December 2013, whichever came first. Follow-up time
was truncated at age 90 years since NRS population estimates
were not available in yearly age groups for persons over
90 years. As type 2 diabetes is rare in younger people the study
was based on people over 39 years of age. Numbers of deaths
and time at risk were tabulated by calendar year, age, sex, year
of birth, deprivation decile and diabetes duration.
To calculate risk time in person-years for the non-diabetic
comparison group, risk time among persons with diabetes was
subtracted from mid-year population estimates for Scotland
by age, sex and deprivation decile. Number of deaths in peo-
ple without type 2 diabetes were calculated using a similar
method of subtraction of deaths among people with diabetes
from national data.
Approval for the creation and analysis of the linked dataset
containing no personal identifying information was obtained
from the SCI-Diabetes Collaboration steering committee, the
Scottish multicentre research ethics committee (reference
number 11/AL/0225), the Privacy Advisory Committee of
NHS National Services Scotland (reference 33/11) and
Caldicott Guardians of all health boards.

 Statistical methods All analyses were conducted separately
for men and women. Directly age-standardised incidence and
mortality rates by year of diagnosis were calculated using the
2013 European Standard Population in order to adjust for
confounding by age and to facilitate comparison with other
populations.
Poisson models were used to estimate standardised inci-
dence and mortality rates by age, calendar year and depriva-
tion decile as smooth functions using natural cubic splines.
Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) to compare mortality
rates in people with type 2 diabetes with the non-diabetic
population were modelled using Poisson models including
an indicator for diabetes status and adjustment for age, calen-
dar year and deprivation as smooth functions using natural
cubic splines. The validity of this approach was checked by
investigating the deviance of models using deprivation coded
in different ways and the use of splines was found to be ap-
propriate. Data for single year age groups within decades and
selected deprivation deciles are used for illustration. Rates are
expressed as events per 1000 person years. Interaction terms
between age, time and deprivation were included in models
where these improved the goodness of fit. All analyses were
conducted in R [9] (www.R-project.org) and all tabulations
were generated using the Epi package [10].
Results
At the time of data extraction, data for 398,076 people with a
diagnosis of diabetes, regardless of vital status, were available
on the SCI-Diabetes database. Of these, 7405 (1.9%) had in-
complete data on deprivation status and/or date of diagnosis
and were excluded. The mid-year estimate of the population
of Scotland for 2008 was 5,168,500.
Between 2004 and 2013, 180,290 people aged between 40
and 89 years were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in Scotland,
and the proportion of men among incident cases increased
from 53% to 57% (Table 1). Age-standardised incidence rates
changed little over time, particularly from 2005 onwards.
For both men and women, incidence rates were highest at
75 years of age and lowest at 45 years of age with similar
patterns observed in all of the deprivation deciles (data for
deprivation decile 5 shown in Fig. 1). Incidence rates increased
slightly over the study period in 45-year-old women but de-
clined in older women. Between 2004 and 2009, incidence
rates increased in men aged 45 and 55 years but declined after
2009. In older men, incidence rates declined during the study
period.
Overall, there were 10,508 diagnoses of type 2 diabetes
during 25.3 million person-years of follow-up among people
aged below 40 years. Due to small event numbers in individ-
ual years, stratification of incidence rates by sex or deprivation
was not possible. However, there was no clear gradient in
crude incidence rates between 2004 and 2013 with incidence
rates varying between 0.38 diagnoses per 1000 person-years
to 0.46 diagnoses (ESM Table 1).
Incidence rates were higher among more deprived groups
with a more marked effect of deprivation among women than
men (Fig. 2). Incidence declined across all deprivation cate-
gories for men and women but the decline was slower among
more deprived deciles. Furthermore, from around 2010, inci-
dence of type 2 diabetes appeared to increase among men and
women in the most deprived decile, leading to widening in-
equality in diabetes incidence in later years.
There were 77,953 deaths during 1,910,894 person-years
of follow-up among people with type 2 diabetes between 2004
and 2013 (Table 2). There were more incident cases of type 2
diabetes (n=180,290) than deaths leading to an increase of
102,337 people with type 2 diabetes during the study period.
Overall, age-standardised mortality rates declined by
11.5% for men and 15.7% for women between 2004 and
2013 with similar declines across age groups and deprivation
deciles (ESM Figs 1, 2).
The overall excess risk of death among men and women
with type 2 diabetes was approximately 40% and 80%, respec-
tively, compared with people without diabetes. SMRs increased
slightly between 2004 and 2013 but this change was not statis-
tically significant (ESM Fig. 3). Younger people had the
highest SMRs and the largest differences in risk by age were
observed among women (ESM Fig. 4). SMRs were highest in
the least deprived groups but changes in SMR risks over time
were similar across deprivation deciles (ESM Fig. 5). There
were larger differences in SMRs between the most and least
deprived men than for women, for whom SMRs were higher
than for men in all SIMD deciles.
Discussion
Using this population-based register of people with diabetes in
Scotland, we have reported contemporary rates and trends in
type 2 diabetes incidence and mortality between 2004 and
2013 and examined the effect of age, sex and socioeconomic
deprivation on these estimates.
Type 2 diabetes incidence was found to be relatively stable
after 2004 while mortality rates declined. The number of new
cases of type 2 diabetes exceeded the number of diabetes
deaths. Important differences in trends in incidence and mor-
tality rates were observed by age, sex and socioeconomic sta-
tus. Despite improvements in absolute mortality rates, type 2
diabetes continues to confer an excess risk of death compared
with the non-diabetic population.
Relation to other studies Declining or stable type 2 diabetes
incidence in the mid-2000s has also been observed in other
populations [5, 11–13]. A register-based study in Denmark,
2108
Diabetologia (2016) 59:2106–2113
 which was unable to distinguish by diabetes type, reported
increasing diabetes incidence between 1995 and 2004 but de-
clining incidence between 2004 and 2007 [11]. In Sweden, the
incidence of pharmacologically treated diabetes decreased
modestly between 2005 and 2013 [13]. The National Health
Interview Survey in the USA identified that diabetes incidence
doubled between 1990 and 2008 before plateauing between
2008 and 2012 [12]. Type 2 diabetes incidence stabilised after
2005 in the UK according to data from The Health
Improvement Network (THIN) database [5].
In contrast, another UK-based study conducted using the
Clinical Practice Research Datalink database reported that
standardised incidence ratios of diabetes increased steadily from
100 (referent period) between 1991 and 1995 to 275 (273–276)
between 2006 and 2010 [14]. Increasing age-standardised type 2
diabetes incidence among men participating in the British
Regional Heart Study was observed between 1986 and 2007
[15]. These conflicting findings may reflect differences in diabe-
tes definition, dates of comparison, methods of calculating dis-
ease incidence and underlying population characteristics.
The largest fall in type 2 diabetes incidence in Scotland
took place between 2004 and 2005. The introduction of the
Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) in the UK in 2004,
which provided incentives for general practitioners to have a
diabetes register, may have contributed to this finding.
A proposed explanation for declining or stable diabetes
incidence after 2005 is a reduction in the pool of undiagnosed
diabetes through the intensification of diagnostic activities
during the last decade [11, 16]. In 1998, the World Health
Organization altered the diagnostic criteria by lowering the
threshold for diagnosing diabetes [17], a factor which may
have contributed to the marked increases in diabetes incidence
in the late 1990s and early 2000s. For example, type 2 diabetes
incidence doubled between 1993 and 2004 in Tayside,

 Scotland. This increase may partly reflect improved diagnosis
of diabetes in addition to the change in diagnostic criteria [18].
This proposed explanation is also supported by several studies
which have reported declining numbers of undiagnosed dia-
betes cases during the last 20 years [19–21]. Data from the
German Health Interview and Examination Surveys indicate
that the proportion of undiagnosed diabetes decreased from
40% in 1997 to 22% in 2010 [19]. Furthermore, the proportion
of diabetes cases which were undiagnosed in Scotland de-
clined from 17% in 2010 to 12% in 2013 according to esti-
mates from the Association of Public Health Observatories
diabetes prevalence model, although it is not known if the
proportion was higher in the early 2000s [22]. Our finding
of differences in incidence trends by age may reflect different
patterns of opportunistic screening and obesity trends.
Stable prevalence of adulthood obesity, an established risk
factor for type 2 diabetes, is also likely to have influenced our
finding of stable diabetes incidence [23]. Estimates from the
Scottish Health Surveys indicate that the proportion of adults
who were obese increased from 24.2% in 2003 to 27.1% in
2009 but remained constant thereafter. Moreover, trends in age-
specific obesity prevalence mirror trends in age-specific diabe-
tes incidence [23]. For example, data from the Scottish Health
Surveys suggest that the proportion of obese men aged 35–44
years peaked in 2009 at 31.9% before declining to 24.7% by
2013; a similar pattern was observed in men aged 45–54 years.
This trend coincides with a peak in diabetes incidence in 2009
before declining thereafter among men aged below 65 years.
The disparity in incidence rates between men and women
has been observed in previous studies [11, 16]. One

 explanation for this is the higher risk associated with male
body fat distribution and greater insulin resistance among
men relative to women [24]. Findings from a study conducted
using the SCI-Diabetes dataset support this notion with men
developing type 2 diabetes at lower BMIs than women of a
similar age, with particularly marked differences at younger
ages [25]. Deprivation was also strongly associated with inci-
dence of type 2 diabetes and socioeconomic inequalities in
incidence of type 2 diabetes widened during the study period,
particularly among women. Data from the Whitehall Study II
suggest that health behaviours and BMI explained up to 45%
of the differences in type 2 diabetes incidence by socioeco-
nomic status [26]. These findings underline the importance of
targeting efforts to improve levels of modifiable risk factors in
more deprived groups to achieve reductions in type 2 diabetes
incidence and health inequalities.
Our finding of declining absolute mortality among people
with type 2 diabetes in recent years corresponds with results
from several studies conducted in developed countries, includ-
ing Canada [16], the UK [27], Denmark [11, 28], Australia
[29] and the USA [30]. Increased testing may have led to
earlier diagnosis of diabetes or diagnosis of people with dif-
ferent characteristics from those diagnosed in the early 2000s.
However, while previous studies have reported declining
values of glycated haemoglobin at diagnosis during this study
period [31], there was no evidence of a downward trend in
glycated haemoglobin levels at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes by
year using data from SCI-Diabetes (see ESM Table 2).
Improved management of hypertension, cholesterol and
diabetes, as well as reductions in smoking, are also likely to
have contributed to the observed declines in mortality rates.
During the last decade, diabetes treatment guidelines have
emphasised the need for intensive risk factor control [32,
33], while the implementation of the QOF has contributed to
improved diabetes care and monitoring. Indeed, the 2014
Scottish Diabetes Survey reported that the proportion of peo-
ple with type 2 diabetes and a record of HbA1c below 7.5%
(58 mmol/mol), reflecting good diabetes control, increased
from 50% to 61% between 2004 and 2013 [2]. Similarly, the
proportion of people with diabetes (not stratified by type 1 and
2) with a systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg increased
from 63% to 79% between 2004 and 2013 [2].
However, if the improvements in mortality represent im-
proved diabetes care or earlier diagnoses of type 2 diabetes
then it might be expected that the SMRs in people with type 2
diabetes compared with people without type 2 diabetes would
also have declined. We found no change in SMRs during the
study period, with mortality rates remaining approximately
40% and 80% higher among men and women with type 2
diabetes, respectively, relative to people without diabetes.
These findings contrast with earlier studies which have report-
ed declining SMRs over time and a smaller overall relative
influence of type 2 diabetes on mortality [11, 27, 29, 30]. For
example, in Australia, SMRs declined from 1.40 (95% CI:
1.36, 1.44) in 1997 to 1.21 (1.19, 1.23) in 2010 in men, and
from 1.56 (1.51, 1.61) to 1.22 (1.19, 1.24) in women [29].
Findings from a study using the THIN database reported de-
clining age and sex adjusted SMRs between 1996 and 2009,
falling from 2.14 (1.97, 2.32) to 1.65 (1.57, 1.72) [27]. In a
Swedish registry study, excess risk of mortality was 27% be-
tween 1998 and 2011 after adjusting for age and sex, decreas-
ing to only 15% when additionally adjusting for country of
birth, educational level and comorbidity [34]. A time interac-
tion was also reported in this study with type 2 diabetes con-
ferring a 17% excess risk of mortality compared with controls
matched for age, sex and county between 1998 and 2001, a
figure which declined to 13% between 2005 and 2011.
Explanations for lower excess risks of mortality among people
with type 2 diabetes in these countries compared with
Scotland include methodological differences between the
studies such as additional adjustment for confounders, smaller
differences in the health status between people with and with-
out diabetes or differences in diabetes care.
Our findings of marked sex differences in SMRs associated
with type 2 diabetes (See ESM Table 3) is in contrast to find-
ings from earlier studies [11, 27, 29, 30]. Unfortunately, only
one of these studies reports absolute mortality rates by sex and
diabetes status, thus making it difficult to determine whether
the differences in SMRs are primarily driven by absolute mor-
tality among women with type 2 diabetes or mortality among
the non-diabetic population. Further investigation is required
to identify explanations for higher SMRs associated with type
2 diabetes both in comparison to other settings and between
women and men in Scotland.
Mortality rates were higher in the most deprived groups
compared the least deprived groups. Similar patterns have
been observed in several earlier studies [3, 35–38]. We have
shown that socioeconomic inequalities in mortality have
persisted throughout the study period. The explanation for
poorer survival among the most deprived groups is likely to
include differences in risk factor prevalence and control, and
healthcare provision and use. In the Scottish diabetes register,
the mean age of people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes
was 59.2 years among the most deprived decile compared
with 63.1 years in the least deprived decile. This variance is
probably related to differences in obesity prevalence by dep-
rivation (62.4% and 51.5% of obese people in deprivation
deciles 1 and 10, respectively). A previous study among peo-
ple with type 2 diabetes in Scotland found the expected dif-
ferences in smoking habits but no differences in cholesterol
control, blood pressure or glycaemic control by socioeconom-
ic status [39].
Strengths and weaknesses Our study has a number of
strengths. First, it utilises a large population register that in-
cludes over 99% of people with a diagnosis of diabetes in
Diabetologia (2016) 59:2106–2113
2111
 Scotland, allowing presentation of national level estimates that
are unlikely to have been heavily influenced by selection bias.
Data linkage to death registrations enabled examination of
trends in mortality. The use of a robust measure of deprivation
also enabled the comprehensive description of the influence of
deprivation on trends in incidence and mortality among peo-
ple with type 2 diabetes which has not been described in
previous studies. There is potential for misclassification bias
associated with the use of an area-based measure of socioeco-
nomic status but the small size of the data-zones (approxi-
mately 800 people) to which deprivation status is assigned
means that this is likely to have a small effect.
Our study has some limitations. Our reliance on data col-
lected routinely means that the accuracy of the data cannot be
fully verified. In particular, it is possible that some people with
type 1 diabetes were misclassified as having type 2 diabetes
and subsequently included in the analyses presented here.
However, the number of misclassified patients is likely to be
very small and a diabetes type algorithm was used to validate
type of diabetes, rather than relying on clinical diagnosis alone
[7]. We were unable to examine the influence of ethnicity on
incidence and mortality rates since accurate estimates of the
population distribution by ethnicity are only available for cen-
sus years (i.e. 2011 for this study period). However, over 90%
of people with and without diabetes in Scotland are of white
ethnicity and, therefore, our estimates reflect diabetes incidence
and mortality for the majority of the population [2].
Furthermore, as data were not available for several risk factors,
including the presence of comorbid conditions, in the non-
diabetic population, we were unable to investigate possible
explanations for the excess risk of mortality among people with
type 2 diabetes. The role of risk factor control on mortality
among people with diabetes will be investigated in subsequent
studies. Finally, data on date of immigration or emigration were
not available for these analyses and this limitation may have
had a small influence on our estimates.
Implications Our findings support the notion that stabilising
obesity prevalence and the potentially smaller numbers of
people with undiagnosed diabetes through intensified diag-
nostic activities in earlier years have resulted in stable or de-
clining type 2 diabetes incidence in Scotland. Our findings
suggest that improved survival is the leading contributor to
increasing diabetes prevalence and these trends are likely to
have important implications for health services, partly through
the possible increased incidence of complications resulting
from longer diabetes durations [40]. Further research is re-
quired to identify the relative contributions of better treatment
of people with type 2 diabetes and differences in characteris-
tics of newly diagnosed patients to improvements in survival.
Despite improvements in absolute mortality rates, type 2
diabetes confers an excess risk of death compared with the
non-diabetic population, and this excess risk is higher in
Scotland than in other countries. There is still scope to address
the increased mortality associated with type 2 diabetes.
Major inequalities by age, sex and socioeconomic status in
type 2 diabetes incidence and mortality highlight the need to
implement effective approaches to the prevention and treat-
ment of type 2 diabetes that also attempt to address existing
inequalities.
