Abstract:
Background:
Recalcitrant sacroiliac joint pain responds well to minimally-invasive surgical (MIS) techniques, although long-term radiographic
and fusion data are limited.
Objective:
To evaluate the one-year clinical results from a cohort of patients with chronic sacroiliac (SI) joint pain unresponsive to conservative
therapies who have undergone minimally invasive SI joint fusion.
Methods:
SI joint fusion was performed between May 2011 and January 2014. Outcomes included radiographic assessment of fusion status, leg
and  back  pain  severity  via  visual  analog  scale  (VAS),  disability  via  Oswestry  Disability  Index  (ODI)  and  complication  rate.
Outcomes were measured at baseline and at follow-up appointments 6 months and 12 months post-procedure.
Results:
Twenty minimally invasive SI joint fusion procedures were performed on 18 patients (mean age: 47.2 (14.2), mean BMI: 29.4 (5.3),
56% female). At 12 months, the overall fusion rate was 88%. Back and leg pain improved from 81.7 to 44.1 points (p<0.001) and
from 63.6 to 27.7 points (p=0.001), respectively. Disability scores improved from 61.0 to 40.5 (p=0.009). Despite a cohort containing
patients with multiple comorbidities and work-related injuries, eight patients (50%) achieved the minimal clinically important
difference (MCID) in back pain at 12 months, with 9 (69%) patients realizing this improvement in leg pain and 8 (57%) realizing the
MCID in ODI scores at 12 months. No major complications were reported.
Conclusion:
Minimally invasive SI joint surgery is a safe and effective procedure, with a high fusion rate, a satisfactory safety profile and
significant improvements in pain severity and disability reported through 12 months post-procedure.

INTRODUCTION
Low back pain is one of the most common conditions worldwide, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 40% [1, 2]. It
is a common cause of disability and workplace absence [3 - 5]. despite the  estimated $30-61  billion (USD) spent each

year in the United States alone on treatments [6, 7]. Clinically, low back pain is challenging to diagnose, as the majority
of low back pain presents as non-specific and a large proportion of low back pain cannot be attributed to one specific
cause [8]. Patients suffering from low back pain are often subject to multiple diagnostic tests and diagnostic imaging,
thus increasing the health care costs associated with this condition [9, 10].
Mechanical  low  back  pain  -  and  specifically  sacroiliac  (SI)  joint  dysfunction–  comprises  between  10-27%  of
chronic low back pain cases [11 - 16] and is often treated initially using conservative techniques such as physiotherapy,
spinal manipulation, exercise, pharmacologic interventions, intra-articular injections or nerve ablation. While these
treatments provide relief, in many cases it is modest and temporary [17]. In cases of chronic SI joint pain (>6 months
duration) that do not respond to conservative care, patients may turn to SI joint fusion for relief [18]. Open surgical
fusion of the SI joint is an invasive procedure associated with significant disruption of the skeletal structure, bone graft
harvesting  and  instrumental  fixation.  It  is  associated  with  extended  hospitalization,  lengthy  workplace  absence,
autograft harvest-related morbidity and potential complications such as blood loss and injury to surrounding structures
such as neurovascular bundles and musculoligamentous structures [19 - 22]. Clinical effectiveness and patient safety
have improved with the advent of minimally-invasive techniques for surgical SI joint fusion, which lowers patient
morbidity and shorten recovery times, but little has been published on long-term clinical and fusion outcomes. One
minimally invasive SI joint fusion procedure utilizes a novel decorticator to achieve proper joint preparation in order to
promote bone growth and fusion (SImmetry
® SI Joint Fusion System, Zyga Technology Inc. Minnetonka, MN, USA)
[23].  This  study  reports  one-year  clinical  results  after  use  of  the  SImmetry  system,  with  a  focus  on  patient  pain,
functional ability and radiographic evidence of fusion.
METHODS
Patient Enrollment
Patients undergoing minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion at one institution between May 2011 and January
2014  were  eligible  for  inclusion  in  this  study.  Patients  were  deemed  eligible  and  suitable  for  surgery  based  on
consultation with the treating surgeon. All patients underwent a physical examination of the sacroiliac joint, including
orthopedic testing and imaging, and had two diagnostic injections with a minimum of 75% pain relief prior to being
deemed a candidate for surgery. Prior to surgery, all patients signed an informed consent form that explained the
procedure, its risks and benefits, and were informed that the results of their procedure may be collected for research
purposes. Patients had the opportunity to withdraw their consent at any time. All procedures were performed as part of
the standard of care and did not involve any investigational procedures or products.
Medical  records  of  eligible  patients  were  retrospectively  reviewed  by  the  treating  surgeon  to  extract  relevant
outcomes and procedural details. Patient data was collected at baseline, 6 weeks post-surgery and then at 3 month
intervals up to 12 months post-procedure. Outcome analysis was performed at 6 month and 12 month intervals.
Surgical Procedure
The surgical procedure using decortication and fixation was previously reported in detail by Miller et al. [23]. In
brief, under general anaesthesia, patients were positioned prone on the operating table with the pelvis draped for a
lateral incision on the buttocks. Anterior, lateral, pelvic inlet, pelvic inlet-oblique, pelvic outlet and pelvic outlet-oblique
fluoroscopic views were obtained to localize the affected joint and appropriate landmarks. Access to the sacroiliac joint
was gained via a 2 cm incision into which a 6 mm dilator was advanced to the planned entry point on the outer ilium
(Fig. 1). A guide pin was inserted through the dilator, drilled into the outer ilium and advanced through the sacroiliac
joint space, perpendicular to the plane of the joint, until contact was made with the sacral cortex. An osseous tunnel was
created over the guide pin using a 9 mm cannulated drill, with cortical and cancellous shavings collected for later use in
the grafting procedure. Debridement of the joint was completed with a novel device made of nitinol and a cutting
shaver. The cutting device was advanced into the joint and undulates over the surface as it cuts. Decortication was
completed in 3 steps, starting with the ilium and followed by the sacrum and a dual surface decorticating device that
prepares the surface as illustrated in Fig. (2). Excess cartilage was cleared from the sacroiliac joint surfaces, followed by
denuding of the cartilage and decortication of the joint surfaces utilizing a novel, proprietary decorticator instrument.
Approximately 5 cc of bone graft was packed into the denuded cavity to promote bony fusion and fixation of the Fig.
(3). A second, anti-rotational implant was placed to provide additional mechanical stability. Multiple views were
obtained during and following implantation to confirm proper placement of the implant and the incision was closed
using standard surgical techniques. Patients were discharged the same day as their procedure and were instructed to

Outcomes
Patient-reported Outcomes
Low back and leg pain severity was reported using the visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100
(worst  pain  imaginable).  Patient  disability  was  evaluated  using  the  Oswestry  Disability  Index  (ODI),  from  0  (no
disability) to 100 (complete disability). Pain and disability scores were collected at baseline (pre-surgery) and at 6
weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months post-surgery. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID)
in both VAS and ODI scores were determined a priori based on similar clinical studies. MCID for VAS was defined as
a reduction of 20 points [24, 25], while the MCID for ODI was set at a reduction of 15 points [26, 27]. Patients were
also stratified based on smoking status and body mass index (BMI) and the associated effects on pain and disability
were analyzed.
Radiographic Outcomes
Sacroiliac  joint  fusion  was  assessed  at  the  12  month  follow-up  visit  via  thin  slice  (<2mm)  CT,  viewing  four
consecutive cuts on both coronal and sagittal reconstructions. Fusion status was defined as radiographic evidence of
bony bridging across the sacroiliac joint and the absence of lucency in the joint space in both the coronal and sagittal
planes.
Statistical Methods
Alpha was set a priori at 0.05 for all statistical comparisons. Continuous data are reported as mean and standard
deviation (SD); categorical data are presented as frequencies and percentages. Means were compared using Student’s t-
tests assuming unequal variances. Fusion rates were compared using Fisher’s exact test and/or chi-squared tests, where
appropriate. All stated p-values are two-sided.
RESULTS
Twenty (20) procedures were performed on 18 patients, with two patients undergoing bilateral fusion in separate
procedures. Patient demographics are summarized in Table 1. The mean age of patients was 47.2 years (SD: 14.2,
range: 24-80 years), mean BMI was 29.4 (5.3) and 56% of patients were female. 56% of patients were smokers while
13 reported multiple comorbidities, 7 of whom reported concomitant back conditions including neck pain (n=1), low
back pain (n=3), chronic back pain (n=2) or a history of lumbar disc herniation (n=1). One year follow-up data is
available for 17 procedures (15 patients), the remaining 3 patients having been lost to follow-up. Data from the last

Procedure
All implant attempts were completed successfully. Mean blood loss was 14.5 cc for all patients, with a mean length
of stay of 0.3 days (patients were discharged the same day of surgery in 16 of 20 procedures). No re-operations were
required  following  SI  joint  implant  procedures.  Minor  complications  were  reported  in  4  procedures.  During  one
procedure, a small portion of the metal cutting tool broke off and remained lodged in the joint cavity. Post-procedure
imaging  indicated  that  the  piece  was  well-contained  and  clinically  inconsequential.  One  patient  with  a  previous,
undisclosed history of narcotic dependence and a high opioid tolerance reported uncontrolled pain post-operatively and
required an extended (4 days) hospital stay. Finally, in 2 patients, the surgical procedure was prolonged, one due to a
dysplastic pelvis and the other as a consequence of the patient’s high BMI. No post-operative complications were
reported in either of these patients.
Radiographic Evidence of Fusion
Successful SI joint fusion was observed in 15/17 (88%) procedures at 12 months (16 patients), as determined by CT
evaluation  of  bone  bridging  the  sacroiliac  joint.  Fusion  status  at  12-months  was  not  affected  by  smoking  status
(smokers: 8/9; non-smokers: 6/7) or BMI (<30: 7/9; >30: 7/7) (Fig. 4).

Pain Severity
Both back and leg pain severity showed statistically significant improvement over baseline in all patients at 12
months post-procedure. VAS scores for back and leg pain improved from 81.7 (11.9) to 44.1 (24.2) (p<0.001) and from
63.6 (29.2) to 27.7 (26.8) (p=0.001), respectively (Table 2). The MCID in back pain severity (20 point reduction in
VAS) was realized in 8/15 (53%) patients at 12 months. The MCID in leg pain was achieved in 9/13 (69%) patients at
12 months. Of those patients who achieved fusion, 80% (12/15) noted a minimum 20-point improvement in back pain
severity, while 67% (10/15) noted this level of improvement in leg pain.
Eleven (11) procedures were performed in 10 patients who identified themselves as smokers, versus 9 procedures (8
patients) in non-smokers. One patient in each group was lost to follow-up. In smokers (all of whom continued to smoke
through their final follow-up), back pain severity improved over baseline by 28% (from 81.5 (17.5) to 55.3 (16.7),
p=0.004) at 12 months, as compared with a 61% (from 81.9 (13.0) to 31.4 (23.3), p=0.002) improvement in non-
smokers (Table 2). Among smokers, 4/8 (50%) realized the MCID in VAS at 12 months (non-smokers: 4/6, 67%,
Fisher’s  Exact:  0.627,  p>0.05).  Although  back  pain  severity  improved  to  a  greater  degree  in  non-smokers,  the
difference  between  smokers  and  non-smokers  was  not  statistically  significant  (p=0.06).

Eleven (11) patients had a BMI <30 while 7 patients had a BMI >30 (2 were lost to follow-up). BMI had no impact
on improvements in back or leg pain severity at 12 months, with both subsets of patients demonstrating statistically
significant improvements over baseline (Table 2). All patients with a BMI >30 realized the MCID in leg pain severity at
12 months (5/5), while 4/8 of patients with a BMI <30 realized this level of improvement (Fisher’s exact: 0.104,
p>0.05).

Improvements  in  disability  scores  were  generally  greater  in  non-smokers,  although,  as  with  pain  severity,  the
difference between the two groups at 12 months post-procedure approached but did not reach statistical significance
(p=0.08) (Table 3). Smokers demonstrated only a 19% improvement (from 63.5 (15.0) to 50.1 (18.6), p=0.14) over
baseline in ODI scores at 12 months, while non-smokers demonstrated a 50% improvement (from 57.9 (12.9) to 28.9
(20.7), p=0.02). The proportion of patients realizing the MCID in ODI scores was similar in smokers and non-smokers
at 12 months (smokers: 3/8, non-smokers: 3/6) (Fisher’s exact: 1.00, p>0.05). In patients who achieved fusion, 60%
(9/15) realized a minimum 15-point improvement in ODI scores.
BMI did not affect improvements in disability at 12 months post-procedure (Table 3). The MCID was realized in
similar  proportions  of patients  across  BMI measurements at  12  months (<30:  5/8;  >30:  3/6;  Fisher’s exact:  1.00,
p>0.05).
DISCUSSION
Surgical fusion of the SI joint has been used for over a century, with open surgical procedures commonly performed
beginning in the early 1900s [28, 29]. Open fusion requires large incisions, significant bone harvesting and lengthy
hospital stays [21, 30], while providing lesser improvements in pain and dysfunction than minimally-invasive (MIS)
procedures  [31,  33].  In  comparison,  MIS  procedures  offer  improvements  over  open  procedures  and  conservative
treatment from both the clinical and cost-effectiveness perspectives [34, 35].
MIS options for SI joint fusion have demonstrated comparable fusion rates with open fusion procedures, with fusion
rates above 80% reported for both open [21, 36] and MIS [37, 38] procedures. Improvements in pain severity associated
with MIS procedures have been noted to be equivalent to that of open procedures, with MIS fusion often demonstrating
superiority over open fusion [31, 33]. In a recent comparison, MCID improvements in pain severity were reported in
86% of patients undergoing an MIS procedure, as compared with 61% undergoing open fusion [31]. Similar studies
have demonstrated MCID improvements in disability ranging from 82% [32, 33] to 90% [28] in MIS procedures, far
surpassing the results from open fusion (45%) [33]. We noted an 80% rate of MCID improvements in back pain in
patients who achieved fusion at 12 months.
In this study, an 88% fusion rate at 12 months post-procedure and statistically significant improvements in back
pain,  leg  pain  and  disability  at  both  6  months  and  12  months  post-procedure  were  observed,  results  which  were
comparable to other MIS procedures for SI joint fusion [28]. Our observed fusion rate was greater than that of similar
studies and occurred within a shorter timeframe [39]. While the VAS improvements noted in our study were less than
other studies, there were several confounding factors among the patients in our cohort. Eight patients in our study
reported prior low back surgery and 10 were injured at work. While a history of lumbar surgery had no significant
impact on pain or disability levels, a sensitivity analysis revealed that those patients who suffered their injury at work
had significantly worse results, especially in leg pain severity. Patients who did not suffer their injury at work noted a
mean improvement in leg pain of 85.2% at 12 months, compared to those who suffered their injury at work, who
reported a mean improvement of only 49.3%. Injured workers are known to have generally poor results when compared
with those who were not injured at work [40 - 42]. This was confirmed in our study. That this cohort was comprised of
 686   The Open Orthopaedics Journal, 2016, Volume 10
Kube and Muir
a majority of patients whose injury was work-related may explain the slightly lesser improvements in VAS scores as
compared with other studies [43].
It is noteworthy that the rates of long-term fusion and pain relief observed in this study were achieved utilizing a
fusion system that requires only two cannulated screws to stabilize and fuse the SI joint, in contrast to other MIS
systems that require multiple implants, often impacted across the joint, to provide the necessary stabilization [28, 39,
44]. The use of only 2 cannulated screws further minimizes the invasiveness of the procedure, requiring a smaller
incision than other MIS systems and eliminating the need for iliac crest bone grafting, as bone shavings collected during
implantation process are collected and used as the bone graft material during the fusion procedure. Additionally, 15 of
18 patients were discharged on the same day as their procedure using the SImmetry system, resulting in a shorter mean
length of stay than other MIS systems [45]. These data are in contrast with other MIS procedures or open fusion, which
routinely require a hospital stay of 1 to 5 days [31, 45, 46].
The effect of smoking status, while not statistically significant, demonstrated a trend towards greater improvements
in both pain and disability in non-smokers at 12 months. Previous studies have found that smokers realize lesser
improvements in pain and disability in fusion procedures [47, 48]. We observed similar findings, with smokers realizing
improvements in pain or disability at significantly lower rates than those of non-smokers. Interestingly, while smoking
has been shown previously [47, 48] and in our study to adversely affect pain and healing, there is no evidence to
indicate  that  smoking  slows  or  decreases  the  likelihood  of  fusion  [49,  50].  The  data  presented  here  support  this
observation, as there was no significant difference between the 12-month fusion rate in the smoking and non-smoking
groups.
BMI played a role in pain relief, with patients with a BMI >30 demonstrating a significant improvement in leg pain,
as  compared  with  those  with  a  BMI  <30.  All  patients,  regardless  of  BMI,  demonstrated  statistically  significant
improvements at 12 months in both back and leg pain severity, although the reductions in VAS scores for leg pain
recorded at 12 months were significantly greater for those with a BMI >30. The proportion of patients achieving the
MCID in leg pain was also higher in the BMI >30 group, with 100% of patients realizing this level of improvement at
both 6 months and 12 months post-procedure. Having a BMI of >30 has been implicated as a risk factor for sacroiliac
joint pain [51, 52], as there are increased forces exerted on the SI joints, resulting in increased pain and dysfunction. As
leg pain is a common symptom of SI joint dysfunction, fusion of the joint in patients with a BMI >30 may serve to
eliminate the pain-generating mechanism, resulting in substantial pain relief.
The  rate  of  complication  in  our  study  was  extremely  low,  with  no  re-operations  required  and  only  4  patients
experiencing procedural complications. Complications in open procedures have been reported as high as 21% and
include post-operative infection, pulmonary embolism and surgical revision [53]. Our observed complication rate is
comparable with other MIS fusion systems, which have reported minor complications in comparable percentages of
patients as compared with open fusion. No additional complications were reported in our cohort at 12-month follow-up.
CONCLUSION
This study demonstrates the safety and clinical effectiveness of the SImmetry SI joint fusion system for chronic,
recalcitrant SI joint pain and demonstrates that the SImmetry system is associated with significant improvements in
back and leg pain and in patient disability. Outcomes were comparable with those of alternate MIS procedures, despite
the presence of multiple comorbidities and a high proportion (56%) of workers’ compensation patients, who are known
to  have  poor  results  regarding  post-surgical  pain  relief.  The  wide  variation  of  comorbidities  made  stratification
impossible; however, the fact that a majority of patients suffered from concurrent conditions yet were still able to
realize improvements reflects the overall effectiveness of the SImmetry system. Future studies will focus on larger
cohorts which will enable stratification based on comorbidity and better characterization of the effectiveness of the
system in patients with comorbid conditions.
