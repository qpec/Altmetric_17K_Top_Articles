Abstract
Background: Multimorbidity is associated with higher mortality, but the relationship with cancer and cardiovascular
mortality is unclear. The influence of demographics and type of condition on the relationship of multimorbidity
with mortality remains unknown. We examine the relationship between multimorbidity (number/type) and cause of
mortality and the impact of demographic factors on this relationship.
Methods: Data source: the UK Biobank; 500,769 participants; 37-73 years; 53.7% female. Exposure variables: number
and type of long-term conditions (LTCs) (N = 43) at baseline, modelled separately. Cox regression models were used
to study the impact of LTCs on all-cause/vascular/cancer mortality during median 7-year follow-up. All-cause mortality
regression models were stratified by age/sex/socioeconomic status.
Results: All-cause mortality is 2.9% (14,348 participants). Of all deaths, 8350 (58.2%) were cancer deaths and 2985 (20.8%)
vascular deaths. Dose-response relationship is observed between the increasing number of LTCs and all-cause/cancer/
vascular mortality. A strong association is observed between cardiometabolic multimorbidity and all three clinical
outcomes; non-cardiometabolic multimorbidity (excluding cancer) is associated with all-cause/vascular mortality. All-
cause mortality risk for those with ≥ 4 LTCs was nearly 3 times higher than those with no LTCs (HR 2.79, CI 2.61–2.98); for
≥ 4 cardiometabolic conditions, it was > 3 times higher (HR 3.20, CI 2.56–4.00); and for ≥ 4 non-cardiometabolic
conditions (excluding cancer), it was 50% more (HR 1.50, CI 1.36–1.67). For those with ≥ 4 LTCs, morbidity combinations
that included cardiometabolic conditions, chronic kidney disease, cancer, epilepsy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
depression, osteoporosis and connective tissue disorders had the greatest impact on all-cause mortality. In the stratified
model by age/sex, absolute all-cause mortality was higher among the 60–73 age group with an increasing number of
LTCs; however, the relative effect size of the increasing number of LTCs on higher mortality risk was larger among those
37–49 years, especially men. While socioeconomic status was a significant predictor of all-cause mortality, mortality risk
with increasing number of LTCs remained constant across different socioeconomic gradients.
Conclusions: Multimorbidity is associated with higher all-cause/cancer/vascular mortality. Type, as opposed to number,
of LTCs may have an important role in understanding the relationship between multimorbidity and mortality.
Multimorbidity had a greater relative impact on all-cause mortality in middle-aged as opposed to older populations,
particularly males, which deserves exploration.

 Background
Multimorbidity, the presence of two or more long-term
conditions (LTCs), is a global health challenge and an
international research priority [1]. The prevalence of
multimorbidity varies according to the definition and
method of classification used, characteristics of the co-
hort under study (such as age, sex and socioeconomic
status) and country of study [2, 3]. The presence of
multimorbidity has been associated with poor quality of
life and poor health outcomes, including higher morta-
lity risk [4–6]. However, there are many evidence gaps in
understanding the relationship between multimorbidity
and mortality, for example, cancer and vascular mortal-
ity are the top two causes of mortality but the potential
impact of multimorbidity on these outcomes has not
been investigated [7]. Additionally, the role of the type
of LTCs and their combinations in risk prediction of
mortality remains unclear.
A systematic review of 39 studies including > 70 million
patients found that demographic factors such as age, gen-
der and socioeconomic status were the most important
determinants of multimorbidity [2]. However, the impact
of demographic factors on the relationship between mul-
timorbidity and mortality has not been adequately exa-
mined. The majority of studies investigating the role of
multimorbidity in predicting mortality have focussed on
elderly populations, typically those over 65 years of age
[6, 8–12]. Some studies have attempted to investigate
the relationship between multimorbidity and mortality
in adults from all age groups; however, there are sig-
nificant research gaps as these studies did not account
for possible variations in this relationship across diffe-
rent age groups and had a short follow-up duration of
1–3 years [13–15]. The recent Academy of Medical
Sciences report highlights understanding the impact of
multimorbidity in younger age groups as a key research
gap [1]. Multimorbidity is more common in those from
socioeconomically deprived backgrounds and is generally
reported to also be more prevalent in women [1, 2]; how-
ever, the impact of gender and socioeconomic status on
mortality in multimorbidity has received less attention.
While a number of previous studies have adjusted for the
effects of sex and socioeconomic status on the association
between multimorbidity and mortality [6, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15],
only two studies have examined this association across
different gradients of socioeconomic status and found that
the effect of multimorbidity remained consistent across
different socioeconomic groups [16, 17]. A syndemic
approach has been proposed to understand multimorbi-
dity, where the emphasis is to understand the context in
which
illnesses
are
experienced,
including
personal
circumstances [1, 18]. Demographic factors are likely to be
important contextual factors in studying the impact of
multimorbidity. This study aims to address the evidence
gap by utilising the UK Biobank, a large cohort of over half
a million middle to older aged adults, to examine the
relationship between multimorbidity (number and type of
LTCs) and all-cause, cancer and vascular mortality and the
influence, if any, of demographic factors on the relation-
ship between multimorbidity and mortality.
Methods
Study design and participants
This is a prospective population-based cohort study
which included 502,640 participants enrolled in the UK
Biobank from 22 different assessment centres across
England, Scotland and Wales between 2006 and 2010.
Individuals were invited to participate on a voluntary
basis if they lived within 25 miles of a UK Biobank
assessment centre and were registered with a GP. All par-
ticipants gave informed consent for data provision and
linkage. The UK Biobank has full ethical approval from
the NHS National Research Ethics Service (16/NW/0274).
A self-reported detailed account of sociodemographic,
lifestyle and medical information was collected from all
participants recruited to the study.
Procedures
All participants reported their health conditions at the
time of study recruitment. The physical and mental
health conditions reported by participants were orga-
nised into a list of 43 long-term conditions (LTCs) based
on previously published literature on multimorbidity
(please see Additional file 1: Table S1) [19, 20]. Multi-
morbidity was classified based on LTC count into no
LTCs, 1 LTC, 2 LTCs, 3 LTCs, ≥ 4 LTCs. In the main
analysis, socioeconomic status was classified based on
Townsend score (a measure of deprivation in the UK)
[21]. A Townsend deprivation score calculated using the
participant’s home postcode, based on the preceding
national census output areas, was provided; a higher score
implied
higher
levels
of
socioeconomic
deprivation.
Smoking status was divided into two categories: non-
smokers and previous/current smokers. Alcohol con-
sumption was a categorical variable based on the
self-reported frequency of alcohol intake: never or
special occasions only, one to three times a month,
one to four times a week and daily or almost daily.
Physical activity was self-reported and classified as none
(no physical activity in the last 4 weeks), low (light ‘do it
yourself (DIY)’ activity only in the last 4 weeks), medium
(heavy DIY and/or walking for pleasure and/or other
exercises in the last 4 weeks) and high (strenuous sports
in the last 4 weeks) [22]. Body mass index (BMI)
calculated from anthropometric measurements at the
baseline assessment was classified as per WHO classifi-
cation into < 18.5, 18.5–24.9, 25–29.9, 30–34.9, 35–39.9
and ≥ 40 kg/m2 [23].

 Clinical outcomes
The baseline assessment centre data were linked to
national mortality records by the UK Biobank data ana-
lysts. The three outcomes studied were all-cause mortality,
vascular mortality and cancer mortality. Vascular and
cancer mortality are the top two causes of mortality in the
UK [7]. The follow-up period ended between November
2015 and January 2016, depending on different assessment
centres across the UK. Length of follow-up was a median
duration of 7 years (interquartile range 76–93 months).
We utilised ICD-10 primary cause of death classi-
fications for defining vascular deaths (ICD-10 codes
beginning with ‘I’) and cancer deaths (ICD-10 codes
beginning with ‘C’) [24].
Statistical analysis
Participants with complete data on self-reported LTCs
and mortality status were eligible for inclusion in the ana-
lysis. The distribution of multimorbidity across various
demographic and health-related behaviour characteristics
were described using mean and standard deviation for
continuous variables and percentages for categorical
variables. Survival plots were used to compare cumulative
all-cause mortality rates between participants in the four
LTC categories (0 LTCs, 1 LTC, 2 LTCs, 3 LTCs, ≥ 4
LTCs). Cox’s proportional hazards regression modelling,
using age as the underlying time variable, was utilised to
examine the relationship between the number of LTCs
and all-cause mortality. The time variable was truncated
for survival plots at 76 years due to the smaller number of
participants beyond this point. Results were presented in
the form of hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence inter-
vals (CI), adjusted for confounding variables (sex, socio-
economic status (based on Townsend score), smoking and
alcohol status, physical activity levels and BMI). The above
analysis was repeated using vascular deaths and cancer
deaths
as
outcome
variables,
by
running
separate
cause-specific regression models to account for competing
risks between the two different causes of death. In each
cause-specific model, events due to alternative causes
were treated as censored [25]. For example, if a participant
died of vascular causes, they were censored from the
regression model for cancer death as an outcome. The
cumulative incidence function (CIF) was used to create
cause-specific mortality plots for each category of the LTC
count (no LTCs, 1-LTC, 2 LTCs, 3LTCs, ≥ 4 LTCs). The
total number of participants included in the survival ana-
lysis models (unadjusted and adjusted) varied according to
the completeness of the putative confounding variables,
and all missing data were excluded from regression
modelling; however, the proportion of missing data was
relatively small, ranging from zero to 2.4%.
Next, we examined the role of the type of LTCs in risk
prediction of clinical outcomes. We considered three
separate predictors: previous history of cancer (no/yes),
number of cardiometabolic conditions (0, 1, 2, 3, ≥ 4)
and number of non-cardiometabolic conditions (0, 1, 2,
3, ≥ 4). Hypertension, coronary heart disease, peripheral
vascular
disease,
atrial
fibrillation,
diabetes,
heart
failure, previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack
were defined as cardiometabolic conditions. The rest
of the LTCs in the list of 43 LTCs described above,
excluding cardiometabolic conditions and cancer, were
defined
as
non-cardiometabolic
conditions.
These
three predictors (cardiometabolic, non-cardiometabolic
and cancer) were included within the same model to
assess their respective impact on clinical outcomes.
Each of the three clinical outcomes (all-cause, cancer
and vascular mortality) was modelled separately as
previously described.
We then examined the effect of individual combinations
of LTCs on all-cause mortality. It was not feasible to test
for all possible combinations of LTCs (for example, in the
4 or more LTC category, there are 123,410 possible com-
binations of 43 LTCs). We therefore restricted generating
combinations to the top 25 LTCs with the greatest indivi-
dual risk of mortality in the whole cohort. Analyses were
stratified using the three multimorbid categories, based on
LTC count (2, 3, ≥ 4). Additionally, a minimum of 20
subjects per variable has been regarded as a standard
requirement for multivariable regression models; hence,
we excluded those LTC combinations which had less than
20 observations [26]. In each of these LTC count catego-
ries, the HRs with 95% CI for the top 10 LTC combina-
tions with the largest effect sizes on all-cause mortality
risk were reported. Participants with no LTCs were used
as the reference group for regression models, and all
models were adjusted for sex, socioeconomic status (based
on Townsend score), smoking and alcohol status, physical
activity levels, and BMI.
In the final section, we examined the interaction of
demographic factors (age, sex and socioeconomic status)
with LTC categories in the risk prediction of all-cause
mortality. Age was divided into three categories: 37–49,
40–59 and 60–73. Socioeconomic status was divided
into five categories based on the five quintiles of Town-
send score: 0–20 (most affluent), 20–40, 40–60, 60–80
and 80–100 (most deprived). Two separate multivariable
Cox’s
proportional
hazards
regression
models
were
utilised to study the relationship between LTCs and
all-cause mortality, stratified by (a) age and sex and (b)
socioeconomic status, respectively. Results were pre-
sented in the form of adjusted HRs with 95% CI,
adjusted for smoking and alcohol status, physical activity
levels, and BMI at baseline.
All statistical analysis was conducted using R software
[27]. Three members of the team independently checked
all statistical analyses (BJ, PH and DL).

 Sensitivity analyses
The prediction model for all-cause mortality was repeated
in sensitivity analyses. The LTC count was reconstructed
using LTC defined on using ICD-10 diagnostic records of
hospitalisation events prior to study recruitment instead
of self-reported history at the time of recruitment [24].
We used the ICD-10 diagnostic codes for N = 43 LTCs, as
described above, and searched for all hospital recorded
discharge diagnoses prior to the study recruitment (prior
to the start of the follow-up period).
Results
Patient characteristics
In total, N = 500,769 participants provided information
on LTCs and were successfully linked with mortality
status and included in this analysis. Most participants
(N = 328,176 (65.5%)) reported one or more LTC at
baseline. A total of 163,705 participants (32.7%) reported
having only one LTC; 95,226 participants (19%) reported
having two LTCs; 43,120 participants (8.6%) reported
having three LTCs and 26,125 participants (5.2%)
reported having ≥ 4 LTCs. Table 1 shows the baseline
characteristics of the four LTC groups and the overall
study population.
Multimorbidity and mortality
At the end of the follow-up period, 14,348 participants
(2.9%) had died; the mean age for those who died was
61.3 years (61.7 years for males, 60.7 years for females).
At the end of the follow-up period, 2408 participants
(1.4%) in the no LTC group had died, 4147 participants
(2.5%) in the 1 LTC group had died, 3555 participants
(3.7%) in the 2 LTC group had died, 2213 participants
(5.1%) in the 3 LTC group had died and 2025 partici-
pants (7.75%) in the ≥ 4 LTC category had died. The
respective cumulative mortality curves for participants
with higher numbers of LTC had a steeper gradient than
those of participants with no LTC at baseline, while
participants with ≥ 4 LTC had the highest mortality rate
throughout the follow-up period (see Fig. 1). The
number of LTCs reported by participants at baseline had
a strong association with all-cause mortality over the
follow-up
period
with
a
dose-response
relationship
observed in both unadjusted and fully adjusted Cox’s
regression analysis (Table 2). In the fully adjusted analysis,
participants with 1 LTC were approximately 1.5 times
more likely to die compared to participants with no LTC
(HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.38-1.54), while participants with ≥ 4
LTC were nearly three times more likely to die than
participants with no LTC (HR 2.79, CI 2.61- 2.98). The full
results for the regression model in Table 2 are presented
in Additional file 1: Table S2.
The majority of deaths (N = 8350, 58.2% of total
deaths) were attributed to cancer-related causes, while
vascular deaths (N = 2985, 20.8% of all deaths) were the
second most common cause. The mean age for those
who died due to cancer-related causes was 61.4 years
(62.1 years for males and 60.6 years for females); the
mean age for those who died due to vascular causes was
61.8 years (61.7 years for males, 61.8 years for females).
Deaths due to cancer- and vascular-related causes were
more frequent among participants with LTCs at baseline
throughout the follow-up period, and particularly among
participants with ≥ 4 LTCs (see Fig. 2). In the fully
adjusted models, participants with 1 LTC were signifi-
cantly more likely to die due to both cancer (HR 1.50;
95% CI 1.41-1.60) and vascular causes (HR 1.31; 95% CI
1.15-1.48), compared to participants with no LTCs (see
Table 3). A dose-response relationship was observed in
participants with a higher number of LTCs, who showed
a higher risk of cancer and vascular mortality; with larger
effect sizes observed for vascular mortality risk (Table 3).
Participants with ≥ 4 LTCs were more than twice as likely
to die due to cancer-related causes (HR 2.01, 95%CI
1.84-2.20) and nearly four times more likely to die due to
vascular causes (HR 3.71, 95%CI 3.23-4.27), compared to
participants with no LTCs. The full results for the regres-
sion models in Table 3 for cancer and vascular mortal-
ity are presented in Additional file 1: Table S3 and
Table S4, respectively.
Type of long-term conditions and clinical outcomes
When cardiometabolic multimorbidity, non-cardiometabolic
multimorbidity and cancer were included as separate
predictors within the same model, each had an inde-
pendent and statistically significant association with
all-cause mortality (see Table 4). Cardiometabolic multi-
morbidity also had a statistically significant association
with risk of cancer and vascular mortality. The presence
of multiple non-cardiometabolic LTCs (but excluding
cancer) had a statistically significant association with
vascular mortality, but not with cancer mortality. Pre-
vious history of cancer was associated with a statis-
tically significant higher risk of cancer mortality but
not vascular mortality.
We considered 24 individual LTCs with the greatest
individual statistically significant association with higher
all-cause mortality in the whole cohort for possible com-
binations. These 24 LTCs were dementia (HR 5.84, 95%
CI 4.11–8.31), psychoactive substance addiction (HR
4.32, 95% CI 2.50–7.44), chronic kidney disease (HR
3.61, 95% CI 3.10–4.22), alcohol addiction (HR 3.32,
95% CI 2.75–4.00), Parkinson’s disease (HR 3.10, 95% CI
2.57–3.74), heart failure (HR 2.98, 95% CI 2.44–3.64),
chronic liver disease (HR 2.99, 95% CI 2.44–3.65),
previous history of cancer (HR 2.83, 95% CI 2.72–2.95),
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (HR 2.07,
95% CI 1.93–2.23), peripheral vascular disease (HR 1.95,

 95% CI 1.61–2.37), schizophrenia/bipolar disorder (HR
1.72, 95% CI1.42–2.08), pernicious anaemia (HR 1.66, 95%
CI 1.34–2.07), stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA)
(HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.54–1.80), epilepsy (HR 1.65, 95% CI
1.43–1.90), diabetes (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.53–1.70), coro-
nary heart disease (CHD) (HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.52–1.69),
bronchiectasis (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.23–2.04), atrial fibril-
lation (AF) (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.25–1.62), connective tissue
disorders (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.25–1.50), inflammatory
bowel disease (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1. 20–1.62), viral hepatitis
(HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.06–1.79), osteoporosis (HR 1.30, 95%
CI 1.16–1.45), depression (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.17–1.34)
and hypertension (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.16–1.25).
In the LTC = 2 category, 75 different combinations of
the 24 LTCs described above were assessed for their
effect size on all-cause mortality. The rest of the
combinations were excluded as the number of observa-
tions was found to be less than 20. The top 10 most im-
pactful combinations of 2 LTCs are presented in Table 5.
Similarly, 43 and 25 different combinations of the afore-
mentioned 24 LTCs were analysed for all-cause mortality
risk in the LTC = 3 and LTC = ≥ 4 categories, respect-
ively, as they met the criteria described above. The rest
of the combinations were excluded as the number of ob-
servations was found to be less than 20. The top 10 most
impactful combinations in these categories are shown in
Table 5. For those with ≥ 4 LTCs, morbidity com-
binations that included hypertension, coronary heart
disease, chronic kidney disease, stroke/TIA, diabetes,
cancer, epilepsy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
depression, osteoporosis and connective tissue dis-
orders had the greatest impact on mortality.

 Multimorbidity, demographics and mortality risk
A statistically significant interaction was observed be-
tween LTC categories and both age (p value < 0.0001)
and sex (p value = 0.0019) in risk prediction of all-cause
mortality. In regression models stratified by age and sex,
the absolute event rate for all-cause mortality was higher
for the older age group but the relative effect sizes for
mortality risk with increasing number of LTCs were
higher for the younger age group. Absolute mortality
was highest in the older age group 60–73 years with ≥ 4
LTCs (13.1% for males and 6.4% for females) (see Fig. 3).
However, the relative effect size (fully adjusted models)
on all-cause mortality was lowest for adults with ≥ 4
LTCs in the older age group (HR 2.47, 95% CI 2.24-2.73
for males and HR 2.52, CI 95% 2.22-2.86 for females),
compared to participants in the older age group with
no LTCs. Participants in the younger age group 37–
49 years with ≥ 4 LTCs had the highest relative risk of
all-cause mortality (HR 4.61, 95% CI 3.12-6.81 for
males and HR 3.51, 95% CI 2.33-5.31 for females),
compared to participants with no LTCs in the same
age group. Of note, in the younger age group (37–49
years), men were observed to have greater effect sizes
of an increasing number of LTCs on all-cause mortal-
ity risk. However, in the other two age groups, the
observed effect sizes were similar for both men and
women.
The interaction between LTC categories and socio-
economic status (based on Townsend quintiles) in risk
prediction of all-cause mortality was not statistically

 Sensitivity analysis
A greater dose-response relationship was observed between
a number of LTCs and risk of all-cause mortality over 7
years when LTC count was defined using previous hospi-
talisation records (please see Additional file 1: Table S5),
instead of self-reported conditions.
Discussion
Summary of findings
This large prospective community cohort study in-
volving nearly half a million middle to older aged parti-
cipants demonstrates that multimorbidity has a strong
dose-response relationship with all-cause mortality. In
comparison to participants with no LTCs, participants
with 1 LTC were nearly one and a half times more likely
to die, participants with 2 LTCs were more than one and
a half times more likely to die, participants with 3 LTCs
were more than twice as likely to die, and participants
with ≥ 4 LTCs were nearly three times more likely to die,
over the median 7 years of follow-up. These results were
adjusted for the effects of a broad range of potential
demographic and lifestyle-related confounding factors.
Importantly, a similar statistically significant relationship
was
observed
between
the
number
of
conditions
reported at baseline and the risk of cancer and vascular
deaths, with greater effect sizes observed for vascular
death risk. Cardiometabolic multimorbidity had a signifi-
cant relationship with all-cause, cancer and vascular mor-
tality, while non-cardiometabolic multimorbidity (excluding
cancer) had a significant relationship with only all-cause
and vascular mortality, but with a moderate effect size.
Cancer and cardiometabolic LTCs accounted for the
majority of the most impactful individual combinations
of LTCs based on all-cause mortality risk. For those
with ≥ 4 LTCs, morbidity combinations that included
hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic kidney
disease, stroke/TIA, diabetes, cancer, epilepsy, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and connective tissue
disease had the greatest impact on mortality. In age- and
sex-stratified analysis, the absolute mortality rate was
higher among the older age group with a higher number of
LTCs; however, the observed relative effect size between a
higher number of LTCs and higher mortality risk was lar-
ger in the younger age group (37–49 years), especially
among male participants. While socioeconomic status
remained an independent and significant predictor of
all-cause mortality, the relationship between multimorbid-
ity and mortality risk was consistent across all categories
of socioeconomic status in the stratified analysis.
Strengths and limitations
The UK Biobank is recognised to be a high-quality re-
source; however, the recruited population is mostly white
British and less socioeconomically deprived than the UK
general population (although all strata of socioeconomic
spectrum are represented). It is therefore likely that
adverse lifestyle risk factors are less common than the UK
average [28]. This suggests that the effect sizes for
multimorbidity and mortality presented here, and the
moderating effects of socioeconomic status, are likely

 to provide more conservative estimates than in the
wider UK population. The use of self-reported health
data is a potential limitation, and it was not possible to
validate the presence of these self-reported long-term
conditions. However, participants reported their health
conditions with the support of a nurse and importantly
our sensitivity analyses (repeating the analyses using
health conditions based on hospitalisation records)
showed the trends in results were the same with larger
effect sizes, although it should be noted that the sensi-
tivity analyses using hospitalisation records are likely
to miss LTCs that are not commonly associated with
hospitalisation, for example, a skin-related LTC like
eczema. The large sample size is a strength of this study,
as is the ability to adjust for a wide range of sociodemo-
graphic and lifestyle factors. The examination of patient
characteristics in relation to the number of LTCs was
cross-sectional,
and
therefore,
temporal
relationships
could not be determined. There is no consensus in the
literature on the best way to measure multimorbidity [29].
A simple count was deemed suitable due to the availability
of data on a wide range of morbidities and the lack of
evidence that alternative approaches are preferable [5];
however, this count was unweighted and we have no infor-
mation on the severity of the conditions reported here.
Residual confounding is likely to be a major limitation of
any observational study of this kind. We have tried to
minimise the effects of residual confounding by adjusting
for major risk factors associated with mortality globally
[30, 31] and by considering different types of LTCs and
difference causes of mortality in our analysis.
Comparison with other literature
We found a dose-response relationship between the
number of LTCs and risk of all-cause mortality, as well
as cancer and vascular mortality in a general population
sample. A meta-analysis of 26 studies by Nunes et al.
found similar effect sizes while studying the relationship
between multimorbidity and all-cause mortality (HR
1.73 for ≥ 2 LTCs, HR 2.72 for ≥ 3 LTCs) in participants
> 65 years of age [6]. However, while there is data to show
multimorbidity is associated with lung and ovarian cancer
mortality, this is the first study we know of to examine the
relationship of multimorbidity with all-cause and cancer
mortality [32, 33]. In our study of a general population, we
found that cancer mortality risk was significantly higher
with higher cardiometabolic multimorbidity (HR 1.15 for
2 LTCs, HR 1.23 for 3 LTCs, 1.67 for ≥ 4 LTCs) but
unchanged with non-cardiometabolic multimorbidity that
excluded a pre-existing cancer diagnosis. Previous studies
conducted in populations with cancer have found an
association
between
multimorbidity
and
all-cause

 mortality (HRs ranging from 1.1 to 5.8) [34, 35], but we
could find no other studies that have examined multimor-
bidity and cancer mortality in a general population. We
found a dose-response relationship between the presence
of cardiometabolic multimorbidity (based on N = 7 LTCs)
and all-cause (HR 1.67 for 2 LTCs, HR 2.52 for 3 LTCs,
HR 3.20 for ≥ 4 LTCs) and vascular mortality (HR 3.42 for
2 LTCs, HR 7.31 for 3 LTCs, HR 8.20 for ≥ 4 LTCs). The
Emerging Risk Factor Collaboration studied the effects of
cardiometabolic multimorbidity (based on 3 LTCs—dia-
betes, stroke and myocardial infarction) in two large
cohorts (including the UK Biobank) and found a similar
dose-response effect on all-cause mortality risk, with
slightly larger effect sizes (HRs ranging from 3.1 to 3.9 for
2 LTCs, HRs ranging from 4.9 to 6.0 for 3 LTCs) [36].
Whilst the effect of multimorbidity on vascular mortality
has been studied elsewhere, it has only been studied in
populations using a selective sample of pre-existing
cardiometabolic conditions [37, 38]. We identified clusters
of long-term conditions with the strongest association
with all-cause mortality across different levels of multi-
morbidity. This is a key research gap highlighted in the
recent Academy of Medical Sciences Report [1]. Our find-
ings highlight the most impactful combinations of LTCs
and highlight the need for further research to better
understand the relationships between these conditions
and how they might interact.
In the stratified regression models, we found a signifi-
cant statistical interaction between both age and sex
with a number of LTCs on the risk of all-cause mortality,
showing an increasing number of LTCs had a greater
effect size on mortality risk among younger age groups,
especially men. This is the first study we know of to
compare this relationship across different age groups.
While socioeconomic status was a significant predictor
of all-cause mortality risk, the effect of the number of
LTCs on mortality risk remained similar across different
socioeconomic strata, and we did not observe a sig-
nificant statistical interaction between socioeconomic
groups (classified on the basis of Townsend score) and
number of LTCs on all-cause mortality risk. Previous
research on population samples in Canada [16] and
Norway [17] has found that effects of multimorbidity on
mortality remained constant across different socioeco-
nomic groups, defined on the basis of median neighbour-
hood income and individual educational qualifications. In
a meta-analysis of 1.7 million participants from seven
different high-income countries, lower socioeconomic
status was found to be a risk factor of mortality, indepen-
dent of other determinants of mortality such as smoking,
alcohol consumption, lack of physical activity, obesity,
diabetes and hypertension; however, the interaction of
socioeconomic status with the presence of LTCs was not
explored in this study [30].
One of the key research recommendations from the
recently published NICE guidelines on multimorbidity is
to develop algorithms and prediction tools for patients
to predict reduced life expectancy based on multimor-
bidity [39]. This may inform decision making for treat-
ment options in older people, while young people at risk
can be targeted for preventative interventions. We have
identified clusters of LTCs associated with the highest
risk of mortality; clinicians can use this information
while risk stratifying patients with multimorbidity in
routine practice. Our findings suggest that the impact of
multimorbidity on survival may vary significantly across
different age groups with relative mortality risk higher
among younger male adults with multimorbidity, hence
future life expectancy algorithms using multimorbidity
need to take this into account. Secondly, the majority of
interventions for the management of multimorbidity to
date have been targeted towards relatively older adults
[40, 41], and these findings suggest there is a need for
future research to develop interventions for managing
multimorbidity in middle-aged populations and to
explore whether multimorbidity should be noted as a
risk factor within cancer referral pathways.
Conclusion
In our study of middle to older aged participants recruited
from the general population, multimorbidity was consis-
tently associated with higher all-cause, cancer and vascular
mortality, even after adjusting for the effects of lifestyle
and demographic factors. Cardiometabolic multimorbidity
was noted to have a consistent association with all three
clinical outcomes considered, while cancer and cardio-
metabolic conditions were featured in almost all the most
impactful combinations of LTCs for mortality risk. Type
of LTCs, as opposed to a number, may have an important
role in understanding the relationship between multimor-
bidity and mortality. Younger participants, especially men,
were observed to have a relatively higher risk of mortality
with increasing number of LTCs. Further research is
needed to study the impact and management of multi-
morbidity in middle-aged adults, as they may be at higher
risk of early death.
