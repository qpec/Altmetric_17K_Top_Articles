Abstract.
Background: Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a tauopathy associated with prior exposure to repetitive head
impacts, such as those incurred through American football and other collision sports. Diagnosis is made through neuropatho-
logical examination. Many of the clinical features of CTE are common in the general population, with and without a history
of head impact exposure, making clinical diagnosis difficult. As is now common in the diagnosis of other neurodegenerative
disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, there is a need for methods to diagnose CTE during life through objective biomarkers.
Objective: The aim of this study was to examine tau-positive exosomes in plasma as a potential CTE biomarker.
Methods: Subjects were 78 former National Football League (NFL) players and 16 controls. Extracellular vesicles were
isolated from plasma. Fluorescent nanoparticle tracking analysis was used to determine the number of vesicles staining
positive for tau.
Results: The NFL group had higher exosomal tau than the control group (p < 0.0001). Exosomal tau discriminated between
the groups, with 82% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% positive predictive value, and 53% negative predictive value. Within
the NFL group, higher exosomal tau was associated with worse performance on tests of memory (p = 0.0126) and psychomotor
speed (p = 0.0093).
Conclusion: These preliminary findings suggest that exosomal tau in plasma may be an accurate, noninvasive CTE biomarker.

INTRODUCTION
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a pro-
gressive neurodegenerative disease associated with
prior exposure to repetitive head impacts, primarily
through contact sports such as boxing and Amer-
ican football [1–9]. Originally termed, “dementia
pugilistica” when observed in boxers, CTE is distin-
guished neuropathologically from other tauopathies,
such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal
lobar degeneration, by the regional distribution of tau
aggregates. In CTE, the pathognomonic finding is an
abnormal perivascular accumulation of hyperphos-
phorylated microtubule-associate protein tau (p-tau)
as neurofibrillary tangles, astrocytic inclusions, and
neurites, distributed irregularly and preferentially
at the depths of the cortical sulci [6, 10]. As
the disease worsens, the p-tau pathology becomes
more widespread, found most prominently in the
frontal and temporal lobes, amygdala, hippocam-
pus, and entorhinal cortex [4, 11, 12]. At this time,
CTE can only be diagnosed by neuropathological
examination.
The clinical presentation of CTE involves a
constellation of cognitive (e.g., episodic memory
impairment and executive dysfunction), mood (e.g.,
depression, apathy), and behavioral (e.g., aggression,
impulsivity) changes, with dementia often reported as
the disease progresses [7]. In some cases, predom-
inantly former boxers, motor signs and symptoms
(e.g., gait instability, rigidity) are also seen [12–14].
A purely clinical diagnosis of CTE is difficult, if not
impossible, because of the lack of any unique aspects
of the clinical course and presentation of CTE, as
well as the fact that many of the clinical features are
common in the general population, with and without
a history of head impact exposure [15]. However, the
combination of clinical features and biomarker evi-
dence of specific underlying neuropathology is now
common in the diagnosis of other neurodegenerative
diseases, such as AD [16–18].
Potential
neuroimaging
biomarkers
for
CTE
include: volumetric magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) [19–22]; diffusion tensor imaging [23]; MRI
detection of specific structural abnormalities com-
mon in CTE (e.g., cavum septum pellucidum [24,
25]); functional MRI measuring specific patterns
of connectivity [19, 26]; and magnetic resonance
spectroscopy [27]. These approaches, however, will
likely only serve as proxy biomarkers, rather than
specific markers of the underlying p-tau pathology.
One emerging method to detect and measure brain
p-tau directly involves positron emission tomogra-
phy (PET) radioligands that are specific for paired
helical filament tau [28–31]. However, once refined
and validated, PET tau will remain expensive, time-
demanding, and relatively invasive.
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of amyloid-�
peptide, p-tau, and total tau are accepted biomark-
ers for the diagnosis of AD [32–34]. Although CSF
p-tau may prove to be an appropriate biomarker
for CTE, its routine use in screening or as a
diagnostic test conducted by a primary care physi-
cian will be limited by the requirement for a
lumbar puncture, a procedure that remains con-
troversial and viewed as invasive, complicated,
and time consuming, and is often feared by
patients [35]. Therefore, the exploration of potential
blood-based biomarkers for other neurodegenerative
diseases has grown tremendously in recent years
[18, 36–40]. Studies using ultrasensitive single-
molecule immunoarray technology to measure blood
tau levels have been promising [41–43], though it
remains unclear if the measurement of tau in plasma
is an accurate marker of brain tau pathology [44].
That is, tau that can be detected in plasma has theoret-
ically been released by damaged axons into the CSF
and then leaked from CSF into blood, crossing the
blood-brain barrier (BBB). Thus, the measurement
of CSF and plasma tau does not necessarily reflect
tau within brain cells (i.e., neurons, glia).
Exosomes are nanovesicles released by most
cells throughout the body, including the brain, into
the extracellular environment through exocytosis
of plasma membrane-anchored vesicles [45]. The
molecular content or cargo of exosomes directly
reflects the content of the cell of origin. They are
released into body fluids such as CSF, blood, and
urine and are very stable, thus providing the potential
to serve as biomarkers for the diagnosis and progno-
sis of a variety of diseases. Taylor and Doellgast [46]
made the initial observation of circulating microvesi-
cles and their diagnostic potential in 1979. The term,
“exosomes” was first used in 1981 by Trams and col-
leagues [47]. Since that time, exosomes have been
the focus of growing research, primarily in the area
of tumor diagnosis [45, 48]. More recently, investiga-
tions of exosomes in neurodegenerative disease have
focused on cell-to-cell transmission of pathogenic
proteins [49, 50]. Because exosomes readily cross
the BBB, their potential as a nanodelivery system
from the periphery into the brain for the treatment
of neurodegenerative disease is also being explored
[51]. Additionally, because exosomes cross the BBB

1101
from the brain out to the periphery, with their cargo
intact, and because their cargo reflects the intracellu-
lar milieu of their point of origin, the measurement
of brain-derived exosomes may serve as a direct and
noninvasive blood test measuring brain tau pathology
[44].

enriched for neural sources through neural cell adhe-
sion molecule (NCAM) antibody in either serum
or plasma from patients with clinically diagnosed
amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD
dementia, patients with frontotemporal dementia,
and cognitively healthy controls [52]. They then
measured several proteins associated with AD and
frontotemporal lobar degeneration pathology, includ-
ing p-tau and total tau, using ELISA. They report
that a profile of these protein levels had high accu-
racy in classifying AD (MCI or dementia) from
controls and frontotemporal dementia from controls.
Furthermore, in a subgroup of subjects with measure-
ments at two time-points, from one to ten years after
baseline, the exosomal protein levels predicted later
clinical decline. More recently, Goetzl and colleagues
examined autolysosomal proteins in brain-derived
exosomes and found that the exosomal protein levels
were able to distinguish patients with AD from case
controls and reflected AD pathology up to 10 years
before symptom onset [53].
The aim of this study was to establish preliminary
support for the use of exosomal tau measurement
in plasma as a potential biomarker for CTE. To
date, every published case of neuropathologically-
confirmed CTE has had a history of repetitive head
impacts, such as those experienced in American foot-
ball [6, 7], indicating that head impact exposure is a
necessary (but not sufficient) variable for the devel-
opment of the disease. We, therefore, studied a group
of symptomatic former National Football League
(NFL) players with entry criteria selected to enrich
the sample with individuals presumably at high risk
for developing CTE, based on history of extensive
exposure to repetitive head impacts, current symp-
toms, and age. That group was compared with a
Control group comprised of asymptomatic individu-
als without any history of contact sport involvement,
other exposure to repetitive head impacts, or even
mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). We hypothe-
sized that all subjects with elevated exosomal tau
would be in the NFL group (i.e., no Control sub-
jects would have elevated exosomal tau), but that
not all NFL group subjects would have elevated
exosomal tau.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and participants
This case-control study is part of Diagnosing and
Evaluating Traumatic Encephalopathy using Clinical
Tests (DETECT), a larger project developing poten-
tial CTE biomarkers. DETECT includes a sample
of former NFL players and a control group of non-
contact sport athletes. DETECT study procedures are
described elsewhere [24, 54, 55]. The Boston Univer-
sity Medical Campus (BUMC) Institutional Review
Board approved all study procedures. Prior to par-
ticipation, all participants provided written informed
consent.
The former NFL players in DETECT met the
following inclusion criteria: male; age 40–69; min-
imum of 12 years of participation in organized tackle
football; minimum of 2 years of play in the NFL
at positions known to have extensive head impacts
based on helmet accelerometer data (i.e., offensive
and defensive linemen, linebackers, defensive backs,
running backs) [56, 57]; and a self-report (through
semi-structured telephone interview) of progressive
cognitive, behavioral, and mood symptoms for a
minimum of six months prior to participation. Con-
trol subjects met the following inclusion criteria:
male; age 40–69; and participation in organized non-
contact sports for a minimum of four years, with two
years at the college level or beyond. Exclusion criteria
for Control subjects were: history of military ser-
vice; participation in organized sports with expected
high exposure to head impacts; known or reported
history of TBI, including concussion; diagnosis of
dementia or other cognitive disorder; or self-reported
symptoms of cognitive, mood, or behavioral impair-
ment in the six months prior to entry. For the current
study, there were 78 former NFL players and 16 Con-
trols. Demographic characteristics are presented in
Table 1. All former NFL players and none of the Con-
trols met proposed diagnostic criteria for traumatic
encephalopathy syndrome [13].
Procedures
Each subject was examined over a 2-3 day period
at BUMC. Blood was drawn by venipuncture and
immediately processed. Plasma samples were stored
in 0.75 ml tubes at –80◦C, packed in dry ice, and
shipped overnight in one batch to the Exosome Sci-
ences lab (Monmouth Junction, NJ). As part of the
larger DETECT protocol, subjects were administered
 1102
R.A. Stern et al. / Plasma Exosomal Tau as a Biomarker for CTE
a battery of neuropsychological tests by a trained
research assistant, and were administered the Hamil-
ton Depression Rating Scale interview by a licensed
psychiatrist or clinical psychologist. Subjects also
completed several paper-and-pencil self-report mea-
sures of mood and behavior. All tests (see Table 2)
were selected to measure the clinical features of CTE
reported in studies of neuropathologically-confirmed
cases [7, 13, 58]. All examiners were blind to the
exosome findings at the time of administration and
scoring.
Isolation of exosomes
Extracellular vesicles were isolated from the
0.75 ml plasma samples by size exclusion chromatog-
raphy, performed using 1.0 × 10 cm columns packed
with 2% agarose-based gel (Agarose Bead Technolo-
gies) [59, 60]. Plasma samples were applied to the
column and it was then run isocratically. The elution
was monitored at 280 nm and the void volume mate-
rial (exosome fraction) was collected and pooled. The
exosomal protein for each sample was determined by
the Bradford protein assay using duplicate samples
[61].
Nanoparticle tracking analysis
The size profiles and concentrations of the chro-
matographically isolated exosomes were performed
using the Nanosight LM10 instrument equipped with
a 405 nm laser, sCMOS camera and Nanoparticle

Tracking Analysis (NTA) software (version 2.3) [60].
Exosome samples were diluted 1 : 10 in PBS and the
samples were injected into the sample chamber. For
each sample, two 30-second video clips were created
and analyzed to define the vesicle number and size
range. In light scattering mode, within the sample
field, all vesicles are visualized and counted. Using
the dilution of the sample, the NTA software calcu-
lates the total number of vesicles in the original sam-
ple. Additionally, using the viscosity of the solution
and the vesicle Brownian motion, the NTA calculates
the size of each vesicle. NTA demonstrated the size
range of vesicles in the circulation of NFL and control
subjects as 50–200 nm in diameter. This size range is
consistent with the reported size of exosomes. Rep-
resentative vesicle samples were stained for CD63,
a tetraspanin marker of exosomes, demonstrating the
identity as exosomes. An average of the total number
of vesicles was calculated for each sample. To main-
tain constancy among samples, the NTA post acqui-
sition settings were optimized and kept constant.
Fluorescent nanoparticle tracking analysis was
usedtodeterminethenumberofvesiclesstainingpos-
itive for tau. Fluoresbrite YG 100 nm Microspheres
(5.8% CV) (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) with
an excitation maxima of 441 nm and emission max-
ima at 485 nm were routinely examined initially to
assess instrument performance. The chromatographi-
callyisolatedexosomesfromallsampleswerediluted
in PBS to the same concentration in a total volume
of 100 �l. Each exosome sample was incubated with
0.5 �g mouse monoclonal antibody for microtubule-
associated protein tau (clone D-8, from Santa Cruz
SC-166060) at room temperature on a rocker for 2 h.
The samples were then incubated with 2 �l of anti-
mouse Ig labeled with quantum dots (Qdot)-655 at
4◦C overnight. Each sample was then diluted in PBS
to a final volume of 500 �l. These samples were then
analyzed used the Nanosight LM10 in fluorescent-
mode. To determine the background level, the initial
settings for the LM10 were established using known
negative samples. Once established, all samples were
analyzed using the same settings. For each sample,
two 30-second video clips were created and ana-
lyzed to define the number of fluorescent vesicles.
In fluorescent mode, in order to visualize only those
vesicles that have bound the tau antibody and Qdot-
labeled second antibody and not unbound Qdots, the
level limit of the Nanosight was set to detect only
fluorescent spots with diameters greater than 50 nm.
The visualized vesicles, within the sample field, are
counted by the NTA software and using the dilution of

the sample, the software calculates the total number
of fluorescent vesicles in the original sample. Addi-
tionally, using the viscosity of the solution and the
vesicle Brownian motion, the NTA calculates the size
of each vesicle.
Statistical analyses
For all statistical tests, a p-value below 0.05
was considered statistically significant. All statistical
analyses were conducted using SAS/STAT® Ver-
sion 9.4 for Windows. The standard deviations of
plasma exosomal tau levels were significantly dif-
ferent between the Control and NFL groups (0.2 for
Control and 3.0 for NFL, F-test = 265.6, p < 0.0001).
Therefore, exosomal tau levels were transformed log-
arithmically, resulting in considerable stabilization
of the variability between the two groups (0.5 for
Control and 0.9 for NFL, F-test = 2.71 p = 0.0339);
these log-transformed values were used in all sub-
sequent analyses. Group comparisons of age, years
of education, body mass index (BMI), total exosome
level, and exosomal tau level were performed using
independent t-tests. We used analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) to measure the mean difference of exo-
somal tau levels between groups adjusted for age and
BMI (to serve as a control for the possible small
amountoftauinmuscle).AReceiverOperatingChar-
acteristic (ROC) curve was calculated from a simple
logistic regression to assess the predictive power of
exosomal tau in discriminating between NFL and
Control groups. Cross-validation was employed to
calculate a 95% confidence interval for the c-statistic
which is a summary measure of the ROC curve [62].
Multivariate mixed-effects linear regression anal-
yses were used to model the associations of plasma
exosomal tau levels and cognitive, mood, and behav-
ior data within the NFL group. The cognitive, mood,
and behavior scores were treated as multivariate
dependent variables, while the respective plasma exo-
somal tau levels, age, and years of education were
treated as the independent variables. We allowed
for outcome-specific fixed effects and subject- and
domain-specific random effects. Hence, we modeled
two levels of correlations in our outcomes to account
for possible inflation of Type I error: (1) correlations
of all test scores from the same subjects, and (2) cor-
relations of all scores within the same domain. These
multivariate analyses are more realistic models of the
outcomes than using independent regression models
for each outcome [63]. Since all information within
each subject is utilized, we are able to provide more

interpretable and consistent results than simpler sta-
tistical models. Based on the results of these mixed
effects models, partial correlations between each cog-
nitive, mood, and behavior test score and the log of
exosomal tau were calculated adjusted for age and
years of education.
RESULTS
Group comparisons on age, education, BMI, total
exosomes and exosomal tau are presented in Table 1.
The groups did not differ in total plasma exosomes,
but the NFL group had significantly higher plasma
exosomal tau than the Control group (p < 0.0001).
Figure 1 depicts the unadjusted distribution of exo-
somal tau between the Controls and NFL groups.
Parameter estimates of the ANCOVA model are
shown in Table 2. Controlling for age and BMI,
the NFL group again had significantly higher exo-
somal tau levels than the Control group (p < 0.0001).
Figure 2 shows the ROC curve of the model with exo-
somal tau predicting classification between groups.
The model successfully discriminated between the
groups (c-statistic = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.94–1.00). The
C-statistic is maximized when the plasma exosomal
tau level is set to 0. Using 0 as a threshold resulted
in 82% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% positive
predictive value and 53% negative predictive value.

Fig. 2. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve with
plasma exosomal tau predicting classification between Control and
NFL groups. The model successfully discriminated between the
groups (c-statistic = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.94–1.00).
Within the NFL group, plasma exosomal tau levels
were significantly correlated with the WAIS-R Digit
Symbol test (Fig. 3) and the NAB List Learning test;
higher exosomal tau was associated with worse test
performance (Table 3). Exosomal tau was not signif-
icantly correlated with any of the measures of mood
or behavior. Because of the limited amount and vari-
ability of exosomal tau in the control group, as well
as the small sample size, we do not report correla-
tions between exosomal tau and the cognitive, mood,
or behavior measures for the control group.
DISCUSSION
Results suggest that plasma exosomal tau is sig-
nificantly elevated in a group of symptomatic former
NFL players compared to a control group of asymp-
tomatic former non-contact sport athletes without
any history of concussion or other TBI. Moreover,
the number of tau-positive plasma exosomes was
significantly correlated with neuropsychological test
performance; the higher the plasma exosomal tau,
the worse the performance in the areas of memory
and psychomotor speed. The exosomal tau levels had
excellent sensitivity, specificity, and positive predic-
tive value for discriminating between groups, though
negative predictive value was substantially lower.
It is noteworthy that the plasma exosomal tau lev-
els were only significantly correlated with cognitive

mance).
functioning (i.e., psychomotor speed and memory)
and not with measures of mood and behavior.
Although there are many potential interpretations
to this finding, the most parsimonious explanation
is that elevated neuronal tau is a better marker
of the cognitive features of neurodegeneration and
not the mood and behavioral features. The cogni-
tive features of CTE have been reported to occur
later in the course of the disease than the mood
and behavioral features [58]. It is possible that the
mood and behavioral features may have multiple
potential etiologies, in addition to CTE-associated
tau degeneration, whereas the cognitive changes
are more consistently due to the tau degeneration.
Future research with exosomal tau and neuroimag-
ing biomarkers (including tau PET imaging), should
address these possible explanations for our findings.
We hypothesized that elevations in plasma exo-
somal tau would not be detected in the Control
group and would only be detected in the NFL group,
whose extensive exposure to repetitive head impacts
presumably puts them at risk for CTE. We further
hypothesized that not all subjects in the NFL group
would have elevated exosomal tau because we would
not expect that all former NFL players in the study
would have CTE. ROC curve analyses supported
both hypotheses, with elevated exosomal tau hav-

classification accuracy of a proposed biomarker for
disease would not be expected to be very high. The
validation of biomarkers for CTE will need to rely on
this approach of comparing a high risk group (based
on head impact exposure history, clinical features
and course) and a control group on the biomarker
under study [64]. The combination of a non-invasive
blood test for exosomal tau and a clinical evaluation
to examine diagnostic criteria for the clinical history
and features of CTE [13] may improve diagnostic
accuracy.
The methods used to isolate exosomes for this
study did not include markers of cell derivation and,
therefore, we cannot be completely confident that the
exosomes were brain-derived. However, we found no
significant between-group difference in the measure
of total exosomes. In contrast, we found significant
differences and 100% positive predictive value in the
measure of exosomal tau. This finding suggests that
our approach for exosome isolation yielded brain-
derived exosomes, and that our measure of exosomal
tau reflected tau derived from brain cells. The exam-
ination of exosomal cargo proteins is often used as
a method of determining the cells of origin of the
exosomes in body fluids [61]. However, it is pos-
sible that our methodology may have resulted in a
lack of specificity of the derivation of the exosomes.
Although tau is most abundant in the brain, it is also
found in peripheral nervous system cells, and, to a
 1106
R.A. Stern et al. / Plasma Exosomal Tau as a Biomarker for CTE
lesser extent, in muscle [65], kidney, lung, and testis
[66]. It is possible, therefore, that some of the tau
antibody targeted exosomes from non-brain-derived
cells. Furthermore, within the brain, tau is most abun-
dantinneuronalaxons[67,68],thoughitisalsofound
in somatodendritic compartments [69] and in oligo-
dendrocytes [70]. Therefore, even if the exosomal
tau we measured was brain-derived, the approach we
used would not differentiate between neuronal and
non-neuronal cells. Future research should improve
upon the selectivity of exosomal source by initially
targeting cellular markers (e.g., through neural adhe-
sion protein), followed by a validation of origin by
noncoding RNA for specific cell types (e.g., neurons,
glia). Finally, we selected a tau antibody (D-8) which
binds to the tau epitope corresponding to amino acids
1–150 mapping at the N-terminus [71]. The antibody
is also nonspecific to central nervous system (CNS)
tau. Future research should include tau antibodies
with greater CNS specificity, as well as specific tau
isoforms associated with CTE and neurodegeneration
[72], including cis p-tau, believed to be an early driver
of neurodegeneration following repeated mild brain
injuries [73].
Additional limitations to this study include the
relatively small sample size, especially for the con-
trol group and the lack of any additional possible
biomarker of CTE. Despite these limitations, our
findings suggest that the measurement of exosomal
tau in plasma may, after additional future research,
prove to be an accurate, noninvasive biomarker for
CTE. The ability to have a blood test to detect and
quantifytauwouldbeatremendousadvancement,not
just for the diagnosis of CTE, but for AD and other
neurodegenerative diseases [40, 74]. This would not
only be useful as a diagnostic and disease progression
biomarker, it could be used as a method of enriching
participant recruitment and monitoring efficacy for
anti-tau therapeutic trials. Because of the inability of
this type of test to specify the pattern and location of
tau deposition in the brain, it may not be able to differ-
entiate between different tauopathies as a stand-alone
test. However, at the very least, a blood test for exo-
somal tau could serve as an important office-based
screen for CTE, with positive results being followed
by more extensive multimodal imaging, including
PET tau imaging [30].
