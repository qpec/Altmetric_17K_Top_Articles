Calcium ions are essential to signal transduction in virtually all cells, where they coordinate
processes ranging from embryogenesis to neural function. Although optical probes for
intracellular calcium imaging have been available for decades, the development of probes for
noninvasive detection of intracellular calcium signaling in deep tissue and intact organisms
remains a challenge. To address this problem, we synthesized a manganese-based para-
magnetic contrast agent, ManICS1-AM, designed to permeate cells, undergo esterase
cleavage, and allow intracellular calcium levels to be monitored by magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). Cells loaded with ManICS1-AM show changes in MRI contrast when
stimulated with pharmacological agents or optogenetic tools; responses directly parallel
the signals obtained using fluorescent calcium indicators. Introduction of ManICS1-AM
into rodent brains furthermore permits MRI-based measurement of neural activation in
optically inaccessible brain regions. These results thus validate ManICS1-AM as a calcium
sensor compatible with the extensive penetration depth and field of view afforded by MRI.

alcium imaging techniques are among the most widely
used experimental methods in modern biology, but the
technology for measuring large-scale calcium signaling
dynamics noninvasively remains limited. With optical calcium
reporters it is now possible to perform functional imaging of
intracellular [Ca2+] at depths of about a millimeter intact tissue1,
but for most vertebrate species this only gives access to a small
fraction of the volumes of experimental interest. Implantable
endoscopes and prisms permit measurements in deeper struc-
tures, but only over limited fields of view2,3. Hybrid techniques
like photoacoustic tomography achieve submillimeter imaging
resolution with considerably greater tissue penetration than
conventional optics. Although suitable calcium imaging probes
have been developed4,5, their application is limited by trade-offs
between depth and resolution6, and invasive surgery remains a
requirement for these approaches. In order to measure calcium
signaling processes in tissue regions of arbitrary size and depth,
there is therefore an urgent need for probes that are compatible
with truly noninvasive imaging modalities.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a uniquely powerful
neuroimaging technique that could provide a basis for wide-field
deep-tissue calcium imaging in animals and humans7. MRI
achieves a combination of unlimited depth penetration, relatively
high 3D spatial resolution (<100 µm in some contexts), and sen-
sitivity to a wide variety of contrast mechanisms. There have been
extensive efforts to design responsive MRI contrast agents for
monitoring analytes such as metal ions and neurotransmitters8–11.
To target Ca2+, most progress has been made using probes
based on gadolinium complexes or superparamagnetic iron oxide
nanoparticles12–14. These sensors transduce varying calcium
concentrations into changes in longitudinal (T1) or transverse (T2)
relaxation rates, which may be visualized, respectively, by T1- or
T2-weighted MRI. Although extracellular calcium changes have
been successfully measured in vivo using such probes15,16, acces-
sing intracellular calcium ions has been more challenging, owing
in part to the difficulty of delivering existing polar or bulky MRI
calcium sensor architectures into cells.
We speculated that a successful intracellular calcium sensor for
MRI could be produced by following design principles used in
constructing fluorescent calcium imaging dyes like Fura-2, X-
Rhod-1, and Oregon Green BAPTA17. These indicators each
consist of a planar cell-permeable aromatic fluorophore functio-
nalized with a selective calcium binding moiety derived from 1,2-
bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA).
Although BAPTA is hydrophilic and membrane-impermeant, it
may be modified with acetomethoxyl (AM) ester groups to pro-
duce a neutral, inactive compound that is readily internalized into
cells18,19. After internalization, the AM esters undergo hydrolysis
catalyzed by intracellular esterases. This process traps the probes
within the cell cytosol and restores their ability to sense calcium.
We recently created a family of cell-permeable phenylenedia-
mido (PDA)-based Mn3+ complexes that act as T1 MRI contrast
agents capable of selective cell labeling20. We reasoned that
conjugation of such complexes to BAPTA-based chelators would
result in candidate MRI calcium sensors with similar physico-
chemical properties to optical calcium imaging dyes. Such probes
could be administered to cells in an AM ester-modified form,
which would be internalized and activated (Fig. 1a). Interactions
between the BAPTA and Mn-PDA groups of the activated sensor
could then provide a basis for coupling intracellular calcium
concentration changes to T1-weighted MRI signals.
Results
Building blocks for intracellular MRI calcium sensors. To
examine the potential of Mn-PDA contrast agents to function as
building blocks for our sensor design, we performed MRI mea-
surements of BAPTA interactions with three previously intro-
duced paramagnetic chelate complexes20 (Fig. 1a inset). Addition
of 1.1 equiv of BAPTA to two of the Mn-PDA complexes, MnL1
and MnL3, produces notable effects on the T1-weighted MRI
contrast induced by these compounds in buffer; a third com-
pound, MnL2, is unresponsive to BAPTA. Importantly, these
BAPTA-dependent contrast changes are reversed by addition of
equimolar Ca2+ (Fig. 1b). This result is consistent with the pos-
sibility that the Mn-PDA moieties compete with Ca2+ for binding
to BAPTA molecules. The changes could be quantified in terms of
T1 relaxivity (r1) values, which are defined as the slope of the T1
relaxation rate (1/T1 = R1) vs. concentration of each paramagnetic
complex. Calcium-dependent changes in r1 observed for MnL1
and MnL3 in the presence of BAPTA are 105% and 23%,
respectively; both are highly significant (t-test p < 7 × 10−6).
Although mixtures of MnL1 or MnL3 with BAPTA both
showed promising calcium-dependent MRI properties, we were
concerned that competition between the PDA and BAPTA
chelators for access to manganese might compromise stability of
the Mn-PDA complexes while promoting the r1 changes we
observed. To test for this possibility, we examined the spectro-
scopic behavior of MnL1 and MnL3 in the presence of BAPTA
over time, and found indeed that the MnL1-containing mixture
displays sharp changes indicative of degradation, whereas the
MnL3 mixture remains unperturbed and apparently stable
(Fig. 1d). These results were confirmed by high resolution mass
spectrometry of the two mixtures. Even after 24 h, the MnL3
mixture with BAPTA displays a prominent base peak associated
with [MnL3 + Cl]– (m/z = 419.77) but no peak for apo L3. In
contrast, the MnL1 mixture with BAPTA develops a strong
peak for apo L1 (m/z = 347.37), indicating dissociation of the
MnL1 complex (Supplementary Figure 1). These results together
suggest that MnL3 and BAPTA constitute a suitable pair of
building blocks for intracellular calcium sensor construction, but
that MnL1 is insufficiently stable despite its greater calcium-
dependent r1 changes in the presence of BAPTA.
Synthesis and characterization of ManICS1 and ManICS1-AM.
To form our first manganese-based intracellular calcium sensor
(ManICS1) from MnL3 and BAPTA, we synthesized ManICS1
(14) and its AM ester derivative ManICS1-AM (16) using a series
of multistep reactions starting from 5-methyl-2-nitrophenol (1)
(Fig. 2, Supplementary Figure 2, and Supplementary Methods).
Compound 7, as the parent BAPTA derivative for preparing
ManICS1, was synthesized as previously reported21. Conversion
of the aldehyde group of this compound to a carboxylic acid was
performed through Pinnick oxidation22, which enables high
yields without requirement for transition metal catalysis. Oxida-
tion of aldehyde using milder conditions was unsuccessful owing
to the presence of the electron-donating tertiary amine groups.
Successive coupling of a polyethylene glycol linker and the
bifunctional L3 derivative, L3COOH (12), to compound 7 was
achieved using benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium
hexafluorophosphate, which produced higher yields than other
coupling reagents. The resulting compound 15 was metallated to
form ManICS1-AM by reaction with Mn(OAc)3∙2(H2O) in
acetonitrile
in
the
presence
of
N,N-diisopropylethylamine.
Enzymatic hydrolysis of ManICS1-AM or direct coupling of
compound 11 to MnL3COOH (13) afforded ManICS1 in mod-
erate yields (Fig. 2).
We measured the calcium responsiveness of ManICS1 in buffer
by titrating the compound with calcium chloride over a con-
centration range relevant to intracellular signaling (0–100 µM).

 as calcium ions are added (Fig. 3a). No image changes are
observed when Mg2+ is added in place of Ca2+, indicating
specificity of the responses to calcium. Apparent relaxivity
values were determined for each condition (Fig. 3b). The data
indicate that calcium binding induces a 34% increase in the
relaxivity of ManICS1, with r1 values ranging from 3.6 ± 0.1
to 5.1 ± 0.1 mM−1 s−1 over the full calcium range (unless
otherwise noted, all error margins indicate SEM of three or
more independent measurements). As expected, no significant
r1 change is observed with Mg2+ titration. The dissociation
constant for calcium binding to ManICS1 was determined to be
18 ± 12 µM (error margin from curve fit). This Kd value is higher
than most high affinity fluorescent indicators used for intracel-
lular Ca2+ imaging, but is still sufficient for converting [Ca2+]
fluctuations by as little as 1 µM from baseline into T1-weighted
image changes of ~1% or higher, equivalent to signals commonly
detected in functional MRI experiments.
Although we suspected that the dominant interactions between
BAPTA and Mn3+ would take place within individual ManICS
molecules, there was also a possibility that intermolecular
coordination or hydrophobic stacking interactions could con-
tribute to the relaxivity effects we saw. To test for such
phenomena, we performed separate calcium titration series with
three different concentrations of ManICS1 (Supplementary
Figure 3). We observed weak concentration-dependent differ-
ences in the titration curves, but no significant discrepancies
among Kd values obtained at different concentrations (t-test p ≥
0.26), arguing that intermolecular interactions between ManICS
monomers do not play a substantial role in their calcium ion
sensitivity at concentrations relevant to molecular imaging.
As an additional test of our proposed molecular mechanism for
calcium sensing by ManICS1, we formed a manganese-free
ManICS1 analog and measured its calcium affinity by titration
with a spectroscopic readout (Supplementary Figure 4). The Kd of

Fig. 1 Design of cell permeable sensors for calcium-dependent molecular fMRI. a The design consists of a cell permeable paramagnetic platform (black
complex, Mn-PDA candidate complexes shown at top right), a BAPTA-based calcium chelator (dark blue), and a linker connecting them (green, R). Prior to
cell entry (top) the BAPTA carboxylates are protected with cleavable AM esters (red), and water exchange (cyan spheres) is expected to take place at the
paramagnetic metal center (purple), leading to T1-weighted MRI signal enhancement (labeled MRI). When the agent enters cells (bottom left), the AM
esters are cleaved, liberating the sensor in its calcium-free “off” state; in this state, water exchange is expected to be blocked by interactions between the
BAPTA moiety and Mn3+, leading to low MRI signal. When calcium binds (bottom right), the MRI signal could increase again as interactions between the
BAPTA and paramagnetic platform are reduced. b Evaluation of interactions between untethered BAPTA and Mn-PDA contrast agents. In the absence
of BAPTA, the Mn3+ complexes (40 µM) do not produce calcium-dependent T1-weighted MRI contrast changes (top), but in the presence of 1.1 equiv
BAPTA, both MnL1 and MnL3 display sensitivity to addition of 1 mM calcium (bottom). c Longitudinal relaxivity (r1) values corresponding to the conditions

 this compound is only 200 nM, similar to the calcium affinity of
free BAPTA. The substantially higher Kd of full ManICS1
compared with this value is consistent with the model (Fig. 1a), in
which calcium binding by the BAPTA moiety must compete with
intramolecular manganese binding, incurring loss of apparent
calcium affinity.
Yet further support for the model (Fig. 1a) comes from studies
of ManICS1-AM. The AM ester-derivatized compound shows a

mM−1 s−1,
about 45%
higher
than
ManICS1 and within error of the relaxivity of the parent complex
MnL3 (5.2 ± 0.1 mM−1 s−1). This is consistent with the like-
lihood that uncharged ester moieties of ManICS1-AM interact
less avidly with the Mn3+ ion, and thus do not restrict water
access or affect the complex’s relaxivity as much as the
corresponding acidic moieties in ManICS1 itself. We found that
ManICS1-AM is resistant to transmetallation, indicating that
replacement of the chelated manganese ion is not a confound in
our results (Supplementary Figure 5).
To demonstrate that the ester groups of ManICS1-AM are
capable of undergoing cleavage in the cytosolic milieu, we
incubated this compound in clarified cell lysate (10% by volume)
and compared the high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) time course to that of ManICS1 and ManICS1-AM
incubated in buffer alone. We found that five hours of exposure
to cell lysate is sufficient to result in complete conversion of
the ManICS1-AM HPLC peak into a product that elutes at
the same time as ManICS1 (Fig. 3c). The identity of this product
as ManICS1 is confirmed by mass spectrometry, indicating
that all four esters of ManICS1-AM are released within the
incubation time. As a further test of the behavior of ManICS1
ester derivatives, we synthesized ManICS1-Et, in which all
four BAPTA carboxylates are modified by ethyl esters rather
than
AM
groups.
HPLC
data
indicate
that
ManICS1-Et
incubation does not yield ManICS1 after five hour incubation
with lysate; this offers the possibility of achieving genetically
targeted cleavage and intracellular accumulation of ManICS1-
Et by ectopic expression of appropriately selective esterases in
future work23.
ManICS1-AM enables intracellular calcium-sensitive MRI. To
test the ability of ManICS1-AM to enable readouts of intracellular
calcium by T1-weighted MRI, we began by examining its pro-
pensity to accumulate within cells. We incubated cultured
HEK293 cells with 10 µM ManICS1-AM or ManICS1 for 30 min,
followed by washing and MRI analysis (Fig. 4a). We found that
cells incubated with the cell permeable ManICS1-AM undergo a
substantial increase in R1 that persists above basal levels for up to
24 h, while cells labeled with ManICS1 experience a somewhat
lesser increase in R1 that returns to baseline within 5 h. This is
consistent with the hypothesis that ManICS1-AM is internalized
and converted to ManICS within cells (Fig. 1a), resulting in
intracellular trapping of the polar esterase product and extended
retention with respect to ManICS introduced from outside cells.
To assess the subcellular localization of manganese following
ManICS1-AM or ManICS1 labeling, we isolated cytosolic frac-
tions from cell lysates and analyzed the samples by inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The ICP-MS
results indicate that only ManICS1-AM labeling produces cyto-
solic elevations in manganese content (Fig. 4a inset and Supple-
mentary Figure 6). These results are again consistent with the
hypothesis that ManICS1-AM penetrates cells and is retained in
the cytosol. Once internalized, the contrast agent moreover
appears to be well-tolerated. Tests for acute toxicity and long-
term viability of HEK293 cells incubated with ManICS1-AM
show no evidence of ill-health with respect to controls (Supple-
mentary Figure 7).
To assess the calcium-dependent contrast properties conferred
by ManICS1 inside cells, we titrated intracellular calcium levels
using a procedure previously applied to test fluorescent calcium

Results
demonstrate progressive changes in R1 as [Ca2+]i ranges from
1 to 100 µM, establishing a midpoint (EC50) for intracellular
calcium sensing by ManICS1 of about 5 µM (Fig. 4b). This value
shows that ManICS1 is more sensitive to calcium in the
intracellular milieu than in the buffer conditions, perhaps due
to interactions between the contrast agent and macromolecular
solutes that could perturb the sensor’s conformational equilibria
or coordination sphere.
To assess the potential for internalized ManICS1 to report
stimulus-induced cytosolic calcium concentrations as R1 changes
detectable by MRI, we again labeled HEK293 cells with ManICS1-
AM, then challenged the cells with pharmacological agents that
elevate
cytosolic
calcium
levels
(Fig.

Ionomycin
and
arachidonic acid24,26 both produce 8–10% increases in mean R1
values recorded within 20 min of stimulation. Cells treated with
thapsigargin or carbachol, which are thought to cause only short-
lived Ca2+ responses27, do not show an elevated R1. Control
measurements using the fluorescent calcium indicator derivative
Fura-2FF-AM collected using similar stimulus conditions closely
parallel the results obtained by MRI of ManICS1-AM-labeled
cells (Fig. 4d), showing that the MRI results provide an accurate
measure of intracellular calcium perturbations.
To examine the reversibility and dynamics of ManICS1-
based calcium sensing we used the optogenetic Ca2+ actuator
BACCS228
to
stimulate
contrast
agent-labeled
cells
while
performing functional imaging with MRI. In preparation for
these experiments, cells were embedded in a gel matrix that
permitted effective Ca2+ exchange at high cell density. BACCS2-
expressing cells loaded with ManICS1-AM show dynamic light-
dependent image changes averaging 0.8 ± 0.2% in amplitude
(Fig. 4e), matching a time course obtained using optical
measurements of cells loaded with the fluorescent calcium
indicator X-Rhod-115 (Fig. 4f). Stimulation of ManICS1-AM-
labeled cells that do not express BACCS2 or MnL3-labeled cells
expressing BACCS2 produces negligible MRI effects. Both are
significantly lower than those observed with ManICS1-AM in
BACCS2-expressing cells (t-test p ≤ 10–5), revealing the calcium
specificity
of
T1-weighted
imaging
signals
obtained
with
ManICS1-AM inside living cells.
ManICS1 detects deep brain activation in rats. To determine
whether ManICS1-AM could enable detection of intracellular
calcium signals in vivo, we injected the probe into the brains of
adult rats and examined responses to stimulation with potassium
ions, which induce neural depolarization and calcium con-
centration changes in brain tissue29,30. Intracranial infusion of
ManICS1-AM into the striatum results in substantial T1-weighted
MRI signal enhancement over a ~4 mm diameter region around
the injection site, as well as in more remote tissue along the
ventricles (Fig. 5a, b). The contrast enhancement persists for over
90 min without significant loss of signal (t-test p = 0.42, n = 4)

 (Fig. 5c), differing markedly from the behavior of hydrophilic
MRI contrast agents that do not enter cells and that typically clear
from the rodent brain within two hours31. The mean T1-weighted
signal enhancement of ~20% we observe due to ManICS infusion
corresponds to a calcium-free concentration of ~19 µM in tissue,
assuming equivalent r1 values in vivo and in vitro.
Infusion of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) formulated
isotonically with 125 mM KCl elicits a robust signal change
proximal to the infusion site in ManICS1-AM-infused brain areas
(Fig. 5d). The ManICS1-dependent signal rises quickly, with an
average signal change of 5.8 ± 1.2% at stimulus offset that
subsides slowly to baseline after the KCl infusion stops (Fig. 5e).
KCl injection in the presence of the calcium-insensitive contrast
agent MnL1F—a close variant of the soluble cell-permeable
MnL1 chelate (see Supplementary Methods)—or infusion of
standard aCSF containing 125 mM NaCl in the presence of
ManICS1-AM elicits negligible mean responses of –0.2 ± 0.8%
and 1.2 ± 1.2%, respectively, at stimulus offset with respect to
baseline. The signal change observed under the ManICS1-AM K+
stimulation condition differs significantly from signals observed
under both control conditions (t-test p ≤ 0.016, n = 5) (Fig. 5f),
consistent with the expected calcium-sensing mechanism of
ManICS1 and with results obtained in cells.
Discussion
Our experiments thus demonstrate a cell-permeable manganese-
based MRI contrast agent that emulates properties of fluorescent
probes for cytosolic Ca2+ imaging, and that can detect signaling
events in deep tissue. The ManICS1 calcium sensor introduced
here incorporates membrane-permeable building blocks and can
exploit the AM ester-based approach for cell labeling and cyto-
solic trapping of the probe. Upon internalization, ManICS1-AM
reports calcium levels consistent with readouts from optical cal-
cium sensors and compatible with T1-weighted functional MRI in
rat brain, suggesting that the new probe could be used for spa-
tiotemporal mapping of calcium signaling processes previously
accessible only to optical imaging approaches, but with the
expanded depth and field of view afforded by MRI.
Further development of this class of MRI probe design could
include chemical modifications to the manganese-binding moiety,
the calcium-specific chelator, and the linker between them, with
the aims of increasing calcium affinity and optimizing interac-
tions between the calcium chelator and the paramagnetic com-
plex. Enhanced calcium binding, for instance, might be conferred
by addition of more electron-donating groups to the phenyl
groups of the BAPTA subunit. Such modifications would in turn
increase the dynamic range of relaxivity changes and sensitivity to
low levels of calcium. Delivery strategies may also need to be
refined for organ or organismic-scale applications, if properties of
ManICS1-AM itself do not yield desirable tissue distributions. In
the brain, for instance, methods for delivery past the blood–brain
barrier might be required.7 Manipulating the esterase sensitivity
of ManICS derivatives might also provide a means for tuning
tissue localization properties.20,23 The current probe, however,
already enables measurement of responses to multiple biologically
relevant stimuli in accessible tissue regions, demonstrating its
immediate utility for a variety of applications in basic biology and
biomedicine.
Methods
Synthesis. All information regarding the synthesis and characterization of Man-
ICS1, ManICS1-AM, and related compounds is reported in the Supplementary
Methods section.
In vitro magnetic resonance imaging. MRI data were acquired on a 7 T Bruker
Biospec system using a T1-weighted 2D gradient echo sequence (echo time, TE = 5
ms, repetition time, TR = 100 ms; flip angle, FA = 65°). Longitudinal relaxivity
(r1) measurements were acquired using a 2D spin echo sequence (TE = 11 ms,
TR = 125, 200, 400, 800, 1500, 3000, and 5000 ms), with in-plane resolution of
200 × 200 µm2 and 2 mm slice thickness. R1 maps and values were generated
using Karl Schmidt’s MRI Analysis Calculator Plugin for ImageJ (National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) or MATLAB scripts (Mathworks, Natick,
MA) written in house. Stimulus-dependent R1 changes in cells were calculated
as ΔR1/R1 = [R1(incubated cells) − R1(naive cells)]/R1(naive cells). Statistical
comparisons between paired conditions were performed using Student’s t-test, and
all error bars denote the standard error of the mean (SEM) from three or more
measurements, unless otherwise noted.
In vitro characterization of ManICS1 and ManICS1-AM. ManICS1, calcium and
magnesium chloride stock solutions were all prepared in 25 mM 3-(N-morpholino)
propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), pH 7.4, with 100 mM KCl. Titration series were
prepared as separate triplicates for each data point in the presence of constant
concentrations of ManICS1, confirmed subsequently by inductively coupled
plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Samples were arrayed into
microtiter plates and measured by MRI using a Bruker (Billerica, MA) Avance 7 T
scanner. Unused wells were filled with buffer, and imaging was performed on a
2-mm slice through the sample. Kd values were calculated by fitting a standard
ligand-depleting binding equation to R1 data. Error represents the standard error
values for fitted parameters in a least squares fit to the data. Calcium affinity
of manganese-free ManICS1 (10 µM) was determined by fitting a nondepleting
binding model to spectroscopic absorbance data obtained at 230 nm, in the
presence of buffered free calcium concentrations ranging from 0 to 1.5 µM.
Titration data are shown with least squares curve fits. To measure stability against
transmetallation, ManICS1-AM (40 µM) in Bis-Tris (50% EtOH, pH 7.4, 50 mM)
was treated with solutions of CuCl2 (50 µM) and ZnCl2 (50 µM) in Bis-Tris
(50% EtOH, pH 7.4, 50 mM) and stirred at room temperature for 5 h before
recording of optical absorbance spectra.
Cell labeling with ManICS1-AM. HEK293 cells (Freestyle 293-F, Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA) were cultured and prepared for relaxometry using a
previously established method19. To assess uptake, cells were exposed to contrast
agents in media for 30 min or 2 h then centrifuged at 750 × g for 5 min, washed
with Hank’s buffered saline solution and repelleted. At this point, for time course
experiments, washed cells were incubated in media again for varying time intervals
and centrifuged again. In the final stage of preparation, cells were resuspended in
media at 107 cells per 100 µl, and at this point drugs were added for pharmaco-
logical stimulation experiments. The suspended cells were finally plated into wells
of a 384-well plate and then immediately pelleted by 1 min centrifugation at 750 × g
for imaging.
Subcellular fractionation analysis of ManICS1-AM-labeled cells was conducted
by addition of 0.05% saponin and pelleting the cells at 750 × g to recover cytosolic
fraction, resuspending the cells in low salt buffer and lysing the cells with 50 passes
through a dounce homogenizer and a final centrifugation at 10,000 × g with the
supernatant collected as the nucleosolic/organellular fraction and the pellet
collected as the membrane fraction. Each cell fraction was aliquated into a crucible,
incubated at 70 °C overnight to dessicate, then at 250 °C overnight to incinerate
all organic molecules. The residual ash was resuspended in 200 µl 70% nitric
acid and incubated at 70 °C overnight to soublize the metal oxides. The final
residue was suspended into 2% nitric acid for analysis with ICP-OES.
Cellular toxicity and viability assays. HEK293 cells were incubated in 100 µM
ManICS1-AM in media containing 5% DMSO for 30 min and then washed in
media. Control cells were either untreated (naive), treated with saponin, or treated
with DMSO vehicle only. To assess acute toxicity and membrane disruption,
a subset of cells was incubated with 4 µM Ethidium Homodimer III (Biotium,
Fremont, CA) and assayed for fluorescence at 530 and 620 nm. Higher fluorescence
ratio (530/620) indicates increased cell penetrance and intercalation into DNA,
indicative of toxicity. To assess long-term viability, an MTT assay (Life Technol-
ogies, Carlsbad, CA) was performed. Cells were incubated in the MTT reagent for
4 h at 37 °C to generate formazan crystals, which were then solubilized in sodium
dodecylsulfate solution for 2 h at 37 °C and assayed for optical density at 570 nm.
Higher absorption indicates higher NAD(P)H-dependent enzymatic activity,
indicative of cell health.
Measurement of intracellular calcium responses. For stimulation experiments,
cells were incubated with 10 µM ManICS1-AM for 2 h to allow for effective
labeling and AM ester cleavage. Pharmacological stimulation was conducted by
adding 5 µM thapsigargin, 25 µM carbochol, 5 µM calcimycin, or 30 µM arachi-
donic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Chemical agents were added while
cells were in suspension to allow for mixing, then samples were gently pelleted
the samples and collected R1 relaxometry data.
For comparison stimulation measurements performed with Fura-2FF-AM
(BioVision, Exton, PA), adherent HEK293 cells (Life Technologies) were seeded
onto a 96-well plate at 5000 cells/well and grown for two days until 90% confluent.
Cells were then incubated for 45 min in 5 µM Fura-2FF-AM and then washed with

 media. Stimulants (10 µM thapsigargin, 100 µM charbocol, 5 µM calcimycin, or
30 µM arachidonic acid) were quickly added to multiple wells via multipipettor and
fluorescence output was measured at 340 and 380 nm using a Spectramax plate
reader. Measurements were repeated every 5 min for 40 min to chart the time
course of calcium concentration changes at room temperature. Mean responses
reported in Fig. 4d were reported as fold changes in the ratio of fluorescence
emission at 340 and 380 nm pre- vs. post stimulation.
Optogenetics. BACCS2-IRES-Orai (Addgene 67627) was transiently transfected
into 293freestyle cells using 293fectin (Life Technologies) and given 48 h to express.
BACCS2-expressing and control cells were incubated in 40 µM ManICS1-AM for
2 h or 5 µM X-Rhodamine-1 (Life Technologies) for 30 min then washed with
complete media without phenol red (Life Technologies). Cells were then pelleted
cooled on ice and suspended in 0.5× volumes of Matrigel (Corning). The liquid
Matrigel/cell slurry was then aliquoted onto a plate adapted to accommodate a fiber
optic input, placing the cell directly in the lightpath but 2 mm from the fiber light
source, to prevent possible heating artefacts. A 480-nm laser interfaced to the fiber
was controlled via an Arduino microcontroller, using a custom written pulse
sequence. Data were processed in ImageJ and analyzed using custom MATLAB
scripts for high/low pass filtering, detrending using a polynomial fit to the
pre-stimulus baseline and the last data point, with averaging across multiple
experiments. Time course images were binned into 2 min averages centered around
the peak response.
Animal use. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) were purchased from Charles
River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and used for all in vivo experiments. Ani-
mals were housed and maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle and permitted ad
libitum access to food and water. All procedures were performed in strict com-
pliance with US Federal guidelines, with oversight by the MIT Committee on
Animal Care.
In vivo validation experiments. A 4-mM stock of ManICS-AM or control agent
in DMSO was diluted to 200 mM in aCSF (125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.4 mM
CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM NaHCO3). Prior to intracranial
infusion, animals were anesthetized with ~2% isoflurane, shaved, and mounted in a
rodent stereotaxic device (David Kopf Instruments), while vital signs were mon-
itored by pulse oximeter (Nonin Medical). The scalp over bregma was retracted
and 28G holes were drilled into the skull 0.7 mm anterior and 3 mm lateral to
bregma for access to the caudate nucleus based on a standard rat brain atlas32. 28G
cannula guides that projected 2 mm below the surface of the skull, preassembled
with 33G metal injection cannulae that projected 5 mm below the skull (Plastics
One) were lowered to the appropriate depth through the holes and the guides were
affixed in place using SEcure light curing dental cement (Parkell, Inc.) Intra-cranial
infusions were performed using an injection rate of 0.12 µl min−1 for 2 h with
control vs. test sides alternated for each experiment to negate potential artifacts
or bias. Metal cannulae were then removed and the animal was transferred to a
custom MRI rat imaging cradle. 33G plastic cannulae (Plastics One) loaded with
aCSF or stimulatory agent were then lowered bilaterally through the guide can-
nulae to the contrast agent delivery sites, and fixed in place with a locking cap
(Plastics One). Neural stimulation was induced with isotonically KCl-
supplemented aCSF (125 mM KCl, 2.5 mM NaCl, 1.4 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2,
1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM NaHCO3), infused at a rate of 0.2 µl min−1 for 5 min.
In vivo imaging experiments were conducted on a 9.4 T Biospec MRI scanner
(Bruker) using a cross coil volume transmitter and surface receiver configuration.
Functional imaging scans were acquired using a T1-weighted gradient echo
sequence (TE = 5.5 ms, TR = 150 ms, FA = 45°). These images had 48 × 32 matrix
size with 400 µm in-plane resolution and 1 mm slice thickness, and were
acquired with an acquisition rate of 4.6 s/image. Each experiment consisted
of a 5 min pre-stimulation period, followed by 5 min of stimulation and 10 min
of rest. Anatomical images used in Fig. 5 were obtained using a T1-weighted
rapid acquisition with refocused echoes (RARE) pulse sequence (TE = 8 ms,
TR = 300 ms, FA = 160°, RARE factor = 4, number of averages = 20), with
an in-plane resolution of 100 µm and a matrix size of 192 × 128 per slice.
Distribution of agent was determined by identifying the cannula tip and
defining all contiguous pixels within 10% of image intensity at the tip as detected
agent. The mean radius was determined for each resulting region of interest (ROI)
and the volume occupied by the contrast agent was estimated as the volume of a
sphere with this radius. Mean MRI signal within these ROIs were compared at
multiple time points for analysis of contrast loss over time. The average tissue
ManICS concentration was estimated from the contrast agent-dependent percent
signal increase observed in T1-weighted anatomical scans, using the fact that
T1-weighted MRI signal is proportional to 1 – exp{–R1∙TR}; R1 in the absence
of ManICS1 is taken as 0.31 s−1 33 and the ΔR1 due to contrast agent addition
is the effective [ManICS1] times its in vitro calcium-free r1 = 3.6 mM−1 s−1.
For analysis of dynamic signal changes during stimulation, MRI intensity was
integrated over ROIs defined by a 1.2 × 1.2 mm square area adjacent to the cannula
tip and centered on the point of peak signal change during stimulation period.
Signal traces were filtered, normalized, and averaged using the same algorithm used
for analysis of the optogenetic experiments. Percent signal changes were computed
with respect to a baseline defined by the first 5 min of imaging and the last time
point. Mean signal change amplitudes reported in Fig. 5e were defined by the
average signal change during the final 1 min of infusion. The map of percent signal
change in Fig. 5d was generated by averaging percent signal change maps from five
animals aligned to their respective cannula tips and plotting the result overlaid
on a representative anatomical image. Sample sizes (n ≥ 5) used for each in vivo
functional experiment were appropriate for providing a statistical power of 0.8
for detection of a ≥4% signal change over a standard deviation of 2%.
