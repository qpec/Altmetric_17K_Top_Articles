Introduction
During development, neurons may extend axons over substantial
distances to reach an appropriate target and build the intricate
functional networks that comprise the adult nervous system
(Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996). The growth cone, a
highly motile structure at the tip of the axon, interacts with guid-
ance cues to accurately select a correct trajectory among multiple
possible routes (Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996; Song and
Poo, 2001; Dickson, 2002; Carmeliet and Tessier-Lavigne, 2005).
Once the axon reaches its target, it arborizes and establishes syn-
aptic connections, forming functional neural networks (Tessier-

Significance Statement
Brain and spinal cord injury may lead to permanent disability and death because it is still not possible to regenerate neurons over
long distances and accurately reconnect them with an appropriate target. Using microtools and nanotools we have developed a
new method to rapidly initiate, elongate, and precisely connect new functional neuronal circuits over long distances. The exten-
sion rates achieved are �60 times faster than previously reported. Our findings have direct implications for the development of
new therapies and surgical techniques to achieve functional regeneration after trauma and in neurodegenerative diseases. It also
opens the door for the direct wiring of robust brain–machine interfaces as well as for investigations of fundamental aspects of
neuronal signal processing and neuronal function.

 Lavigne and Goodman, 1996). Nervous system function depends
on the precise specificity of neuronal connections.
Injuries to the adult CNS may lead to permanent disability due
to the multiple mechanisms that limit axonal regrowth (Chew et
al., 2012). Following injury, many CNS axons do not form a new
growth cone and fail to mount an effective regenerative response
(Bradke et al., 2012). Furthermore, damage and scar tissue
surrounding CNS lesions significantly inhibit axonal growth
(Ramon y Cajal, 1928; Aguayo et al., 1990; Tessier-Lavigne and
Goodman, 1996; Horner and Gage, 2000; Song and Poo, 2001;
Dickson, 2002; Carmeliet and Tessier-Lavigne, 2005; Yiu and He,
2006; Bradke et al., 2012; Chew et al., 2012). Current therapies to
promote CNS regeneration after injury have focused on enhanc-
ing the intrinsic growth potential of the injured neuron and on
masking the inhibitors of axon extension associated with myelin
debris and the glial scar (Aguayo et al., 1990; Chew et al., 2012).
Despite this, the capacity to regenerate long axons to distant tar-
gets and to form appropriate functional synapses remains se-
verely limited. Santiago Ramon y Cajal’s statement from 90 years
ago remains essentially true today: “once the development was
ended, the founts of growth and regeneration of the axons and
dendrites dried up irrevocably. In the adult centers the nerve
paths are something fixed, ended and immutable. Everything
may die, nothing may be regenerated. It is for the science of the
future to change, if possible, this harsh decree” (Ramon y Cajal,
1928).
In the present work, we use microbeads, atomic force micros-
copy (AFM), micromanipulation, and microfabrication tech-
niques to rapidly initiate, elongate, and precisely connect new
functional neuronal circuits over long distances. Earlier studies
showed that cultured cerebellar neurons form presynaptic-like
specializations when placed in contact with beads coated with
positively charged proteins, including poly-L-lysine (Burry, 1980,
1982; Peng et al., 1987). Furthermore, previous work of our lab-
oratory has shown that poly-D-lysine-coated beads (PDL beads)
induce membrane adhesion followed by the clustering of synap-
tic vesicle complexes. Increased immunolabeling of synaptophy-
sin, bassoon, rab3a interacting molecule, the N-type calcium
channel CaV2.2, and N-cadherin, as well as rearrangement of
actin and tubulin filaments, was observed at sites of contact be-
tween neurites and PDL beads, resulting in the formation of func-
tional presynaptic boutons (Lucido et al., 2009). We also showed
that when the PDL bead is mechanically pulled away after pre-
synaptic differentiation, the synaptic protein cluster follows the
bead, initiating a new neurite (Suarez et al., 2013). Transport of
synaptophysin and bassoon were detected in the newly formed
neurite (Suarez et al., 2013).
Here, we investigate the limits of extension and functionality
of the new neurite. We show that new, functional neurites can be
created and positioned to controllably (re)wire neuronal net-
works. The extension rates achieved are faster than 20 �m/min
over millimeter-scale distances and functional connections are
established. Our results show, unexpectedly, that the intrinsic
capacity of these neurites for elongation is much faster than pre-
viously thought. Our proposed mechanical approach bypasses
slow chemical strategies and enables controlled connection to a
specific target. This technique opens new avenues for the in vitro
study of novel therapies to restore neuronal connectivity after
injury. It also enables the manipulation and rewiring of neuronal
networks to investigate fundamental aspects of neuronal signal
processing and neuronal function in vitro.
Materials and Methods
Microfluidic chambers. Microfluidic chambers, with microchannels to
direct axonal extension or with isolated compartments to grow separated
populations of neurons on the same dish, were designed and microfab-
ricated by Advanced Nano-Design Applications, McGill University,
Montreal, Quebec, Canada. These devices are made of polydimethylsi-
loxane (PDMS) using the Sylgard 184 Silicone elastomer kit (Dow Corn-
ing) as described previously (Magdesian et al., 2012). PDMS devices were
assembled on 25 mm glass coverslips (Warner Instruments). The glass
surface was coated with 100 �g/ml PDL (Sigma-Aldrich) and the devices
were used to culture neurons.
Neuronal cultures. All procedures were approved by McGill Univer-
sity’s Animal Care Committee and conformed to the guidelines of the
Canadian Council of Animal Care. Hippocampal or cortical neurons
from Sprague Dawley rat embryos of either sex (Charles River) were
isolated as previously described (Lucido et al., 2009) and added to the
microfluidic chambers. Cells were cultured in the microfluidic chambers
for 14–21 d in vitro (DIV) and the PDMS devices were removed 1–4 d
before AFM imaging or micromanipulation experiments as described
previously (Magdesian et al., 2012). During experiments, cells were con-
tinuously perfused with physiological saline [135 mM NaCl (Sigma-
Aldrich), 3.5 mM KCl (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM CaCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich), 1.3
mM MgCl2 (BDH), 10 mM HEPES (ThermoFisher Scientific), and 20 mM
D-glucose (Invitrogen); Goldman et al., 2013]. Osmolarity was 240–260
mOsm and pH was adjusted to 7.3–7.4 using NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich),
with continuous bubbling of O2 to reduce pH oscillations during
experiments.
AFM. Experiments were conducted using an MFP-3D-BIO AFM
(Asylum Research) mounted on an Olympus IX-71 inverted optical mi-
croscope. The sample was placed in the closed fluid cell, open configura-
tion, and was left undisturbed for 15 min to achieve thermal equilibrium
at 37°C. A 40�-phase objective with 0.6 numerical aperture (Olympus)
was used to focus on the sample, allowing optical access from the bottom
and AFM access from the top of the sample. Triangular MLCT cantilevers
(spring constant of 0.01 N/m; Bruker) were used and custom modified as
described below. The region of interest was located and aligned with the
cantilever tip using bright-field illumination.
Beading the AFM probe. A 50 �l drop of either 4, 10, or 20 �m beads
(Polysciences) diluted in water (1:500) was deposited on a square cover-
slip and quickly dried at 37°C. Epoxy adhesive (Loctite E-30Cl, Henkel)
was added at one edge of another square coverslip and both coverslips
were fixed at opposite sides of a microscope slide using vacuum grease 1
cm apart, with the dab of glue facing the center of the slide. The slide was
positioned in the microscope. The tip of an AFM cantilever was brought
in contact with the glue and retracted with a small droplet of glue on the
tip. Next, the slide was shifted to the coverslip containing the beads. The
AFM tip with glue was then brought in contact with the bead and lifted
away. Bead attachment was optically confirmed and the glue was cured
overnight at 37°C.
AFM micromanipulation. Neurons were cultured for 14–21 d in mi-
crofluidic chambers. During experiments, cells were perfused with phys-
iological saline. The sample was positioned in the AFM and a 10�
objective used to find the region of interest. A 40�-phase objective with
0.6 numerical aperture was used for optical measurements. The AFM
beaded tip was brought in contact with a bundle of neurites for 30 min,
applying forces between 0.1 and 0.3 nN (Magdesian et al., 2012). Next,
the AFM tip was moved 5 �m away from the sample at a speed of 0.5
�m/min, enabling the visualization of one or more neurites attached to
the bead. The AFM tip was micromanipulated further at increasing
speeds as long as intermittent periods of rest were allowed. Maximum
speeds of �100 �m/min were sustained, with average speeds of 20 � 10
�m/min. We have yet to discover whether there is a fundamental upper
limit to these speeds. After reaching the second target, the bead was
brought in contact with the region of interest for 1 h and a force between
0.1 and 0.3 nN was applied. After that the AFM was moved away from the
sample.

 Pipette micromanipulation. Ten micrometer
beads were coated with 100 �g/ml PDL as de-
scribed previously (Lucido et al., 2009), added
to 14–21 DIV neurons grown in microfluidic
chambers and incubated for 1 h. Cell culture
medium and nonadherent PDL-coated beads
were removed and cells were positioned on an
inverted optical microscope (Olympus IX-71)
with perfusion of oxygenated physiological
saline solution at room temperature at a rate
of 0.5–1 ml/min. Experiments were conduc-
ted using two pipette micromanipulators
(MX7600R, SD Instruments; PCS-5000 Series,
Burleigh). Pipettes with an outer tip diameter
of �5 �m were prepared from glass capillary
tubes (1.5 mm outer diameter; King Precision
Glass). A 40�-phase objective with 0.6 numer-
ical aperture was brought into focus with the
sample, allowing optical access from below and
micromanipulation of the pipettes from above
the sample. The PDL bead of interest was lo-
cated using bright-field illumination. PDL
beads attached to neurites along the edge of the
neuronal population above the gap and close to
neuronal cell bodies were selected. The tip of a
pipette was optically guided with motorized
micromanipulators close (2–5 �m) to the tar-
get PDL bead. Negative pressure was applied
with a 1 ml syringe connected to the pipette to
pull the PDL bead toward the pipette tip. Neg-
ative pressure in the pipette was maintained
throughout the whole micromanipulation ex-
periment to keep the PDL bead attached to the pipette. Next, the bead
was moved 5 �m away from the neurite at 0.5 �m/min, initiating �1
neurites attached to the bead. Subsequently, the PDL bead–neurite com-
plex was pulled toward a neurite-dense area close to neuronal cell bodies
in the neuronal population below the gap, extended at increasing speed
as long as intermittent periods of rest were allowed, just as described for
AFM micromanipulation. To ensure adhesion of the new neurite and the
target, a PDL bead was positioned (with a second pipette) on top of the
extended neurite and the target. After 1 h, the PDL beads were released
from the pipette tip and the new neurite(s) remained attached to the
chosen target. Saline solution was replaced by Neurobasal medium (In-
vitrogen) and the sample was incubated overnight at 37°C with 5% CO2
before electrophysiology tests were performed.
Immunocytochemistry. Immunocytochemistry was performed as
previously described (Lucido et al., 2009) with mouse anti-tubulin (De-
velopmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa), rabbit anti-
neurofilament 200 (Sigma-Aldrich), mouse anti-tau-1 antibody clone
PC1C6 (Millipore), and Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen).
The secondary antibodies used were rhodamine red anti-mouse IgG (In-
vitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 647 anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen). Samples
were imaged with a 40� objective on an inverted optical microscope
(Olympus IX-71) or with a Fluoview FV1000 laser scanning confocal
microscope (Olympus) with a 60� PlanApo oil-immersion objective on
an inverted microscope.
Electrophysiology. Whole-cell paired patch-clamp recordings were
conducted on hippocampal neurons perfused with oxygenated physio-
logical saline at room temperature for 30 min prior and during patch-
clamp experiments. Pipettes were prepared from glass capillary tubes (1.5
mm outer diameter with filament; King Precision Glass). The pipettes to
patch on the postsynaptic cell were filled with internal solution contain-
ing 95 mM Cs-methysulfonate (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM HEPES (Ther-
moFisher Scientific), 10 mM NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.15 mM EGTA
(Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.15 mM CaCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich; Invitrogen; Gold-
man et al., 2013). The pipettes to patch on the presynaptic cell were filled
with internal solution containing 95 mM K-methysulfonate, 4 mM MgCl2,
and 10 mM HEPES (Trudel and Bourque, 2010). The pH of all internal
solutions was adjusted to 7.2–7.3 using CsOH (Sigma-Aldrich) or KOH

�840 �m in 66 min (time, 78–144 min). Neurite elongation was limited by instrumen-
tation restrictions since the experimental setup on the AFM does not allow displacements
of �1 mm.

 (Sigma-Aldrich) and the osmolarity was adjusted to 230–240 mOsml/L.
Pipette resistance in solution was 3–5 M�.
Cells were observed using bright-field illumination through 10� and
40� objectives. The electrodes were visually guided to the cell of interest
using motorized micromanipulators. Images were captured using a
cooled Cascade II camera mounted on a side port of the microscope and
stored using Image Pro 6.2 software. The exposure time was set to 50 ms,
enabling live imaging at �20 frames/s. Image stacks were acquired at a
rate of 1 image/min. Brightness and contrast were optimized to enable
proper observation of the pipette–cell contact during approach and seal
formation. Whole-cell recording was first established on one of the neu-
rons in population 2 (postsynaptic cell), then the second pipette was
sealed to the neuron in population 1 (presynaptic cell).
Once in whole-cell recording mode, the presynaptic cell was switched
to current clamp and the baseline current was increased by 5–10 pA to
bring the cell closer to action potential threshold and to record stimu-
lated action potentials. At the same time, the postsynaptic cell stayed in
voltage clamp at a holding potential of �70 mV for recording of EPSCs.
Paired patch-clamp recordings were performed using Axopatch-200A
and Axopatch-200B amplifiers (Molecular Devices). Membrane current
and voltage were digitized via an USB-6218 (National Instruments) cou-
pled to a personal computer running WinWCP V4.7.3 software (Univer-
sity of Strathclyde Faculty of Science). WinWCP controlled the electrical
stimuli provided. The signals were filtered at 5 kHz through the amplifier
and sampled at 10 kHz. Presynaptic and postsynaptic traces were contin-
uously recorded. The paired recording data were exported as a text file for
off-line analysis.
Data analysis. Matlab (Mathworks) was used to analyze the acquired
image stacks as well as the paired patch-clamp recording traces. The total
length of the neurites pulled was measured. The paired recordings were
divided in intervals with a linear background. A background line was
fitted and subtracted and a threshold voltage (for the presynaptic trace,
50 mV) or current (postsynaptic trace, �40 pA) was selected. Presynaptic
action potentials (PAPs) were detected as peaks higher than the threshold
in the presynaptic trace, while EPSCs were detected as peaks lower than
the threshold in the postsynaptic trace and within a �100 ms epoch from
every PAP.
EPSCs were detected before or after PAP within 100 ms intervals and
were classified into four categories: (1) EPSCs detected before and after
PAP (1, 1); (2) EPSCs detected before PAP, but not after (1, 0); (3) EPSCs
detected after PAP, but not before (0, 1); (4) no EPSCs detected within
100 ms interval of the PAP (0, 0).
All statistical analyses were performed with R project software and are
based on logistic regressions for the rate of firing responses. First, a lo-
gistic regression containing a factor for experiment (not connected, nat-
urally connected, or mechanically connected) as well as a factor for
timing (comparing the 100 ms before the PAP with the 100 ms after the
PAP) that was nested in the experiments was used to estimate not only
whether the firing response rates were different between experiments,

 but also whether the firing rates were higher after the PAP rather than
before, separately by experiment. Second, a logistic regression including
terms for timing, experiment, and their interaction tested whether the
timing effects showed evidence of differences across the experiments.
The mean � SE were plotted as described previously (Xu et al., 2010). All
differences were considered significant at p � 0.05.
Spike-triggered activity is shown as a plot of 10 consecutive traces; the
peak of every action potential was aligned at 0 s and the simultaneous
postsynaptic trace was plotted. The onset of PAPs was located on average
5 ms before the AP peak and 5 mV from baseline. The delay between the
PAP and every postsynaptic peak was calculated within an interval of
�100 ms to allow detection of events longer
than monosynaptic activity (�5 ms) and as
much as �3 synaptic delays apart (�20 ms
each) since the probability of observing lon-
ger latencies is very low (Mu
¨ller et al., 1997).
Results
We used rat hippocampal neurons grown
in microfluidic devices, combined with
AFM and optical microscopy, to manipu-
late neurite growth, synapse formation,
and connectivity (Fig. 1). We attached a
PDL bead to the tip of an AFM cantilever
and precisely positioned the bead on top
of bundles of neurites that grew inside the
microchannels. AFM enables the precise
control of the position and force applied
by the bead on the neurites, avoiding neu-
rite compression and consequent degen-
eration (Binnig et al., 1986; Magdesian et
al., 2012). Once the PDL bead adhered to
the first bundle of axons and dendrites, we
used the AFM to pull the bead, thereby
mechanically inducing the growth of a
new neurite (Fig. 1c). We extended the
new neurite for �60 �m and put it in contact with the next
bundle of axons and dendrites. After 30 min, a stable connection
was formed (Fig. 1d) and the new neurite was extended further
for several hundred micrometers (Movie 1). During initial neu-
rite extension, it was crucial to pull the neurite–PDL bead com-
plex at a controlled rate of 0.5 �m/min. Faster elongation rates
during the first 5 �m resulted in neurite rupture. Once the
neurite was �5 �m long, it could be elongated at an average
speed of 20 � 10 �m/min up to a distance of 840 �m (limited
by instrumentation).
The number of neurites pulled with the bead depended on the
thickness of the original neurite bundle that grew in the micro-
channel and on the bead size. Usually one neurite was pulled
from bundles with a diameter of �1.25 � 0.25 �m, while �3
neurites could be pulled from bundles with a diameter of �2.6 �
0.25 �m. We used three different sizes of beads: 4.5 �m beads
created one neurite in 60% of the experiments and two neurites in
20% (n � 5), while 10 �m beads pulled two filaments in 50% of
the cases (n � 30) and 20 �m beads pulled three neurites in 67%
of the experiments and one neurite in only 11% of the experi-
ments performed (n � 9).
Next, we conducted a series of experiments to determine
whether the new neurite–PDL bead complex could be mechani-
cally manipulated and guided to establish a functional connec-
tion with a selected target. We were able to initiate and extend a
new neurite from a single neuron and precisely connect to a
second neuron several hundreds of micrometers apart in �2 h.
The newly formed connection was stable for �24 h. To test the
functionality and the type of connection, we put together an elec-
trophysiology setup that enabled paired recordings. We faced
several instrumental and biological challenges in performing
paired recordings after the formation of the micromanipulated
connection. Most neurons died or the newly formed connection
was broken when we tried to perform whole-cell patch clamp on
the same neuron that had just been elongated and connected.
To overcome these limitations, increase experimental yield,
and test the functionality of the newly created neurites and con-
nections, we decided to connect two individual neuronal popu-

 lations instead of connecting two individual neurons. This way
we could first manipulate a connection between the two popula-
tions, then stimulate any neuron on population A and perform
whole-cell patch-clamp recordings on any neuron on population
B to investigate signal transmission through the newly formed
connection. To grow isolated neuronal populations, physically
separated by a 200 �m gap, we developed a new microfluidic
device (Fig. 2). To overcome AFM instrumentation limitations
(�1 h set-up time and short horizontal range), we used pipette
micromanipulation techniques to connect the two populations
(Fig. 2; Movie 2).
Pipette micromanipulation was adapted to achieve the neces-
sary force and position precision to extend, guide, and connect
multiple neurites in �2 h. First, PDL beads were added to a
neuronal culture. After adhesion, single PDL beads were cap-
tured by suction at the tip of a micropipette. By pulling the PDL
bead, a new neurite was formed and the neurite–PDL bead com-
plex was guided in �1 h over the 200 �m gap toward the second
isolated neuronal population. Next, the neurite–PDL bead com-
plex was positioned on top of a region rich in dendrites and, after
adhesion, the neurite–PDL bead complex was released by releas-
ing the suction on the pipette (Movie 2).
The releasing step was quite challenging because tension on
the newly formed neurite tended to pull the neurite–PDL bead
back to the initiation point. Previous work from our laboratory
has shown that PDL beads added on top of a contact between an
axon and a dendrite significantly increases the chances of synapse
formation in the contact point (Lucido et al., 2009). Therefore,
we used one micromanipulator to keep the new neurite–PDL
bead in contact with the second neuronal population, and used a
second micromanipulator to position another PDL bead on top
of the newly formed neurite, pressing down to make sure that a
second contact point between the new neurite and the second
neuronal population was established. The aims of this technique
were to avoid retraction, guarantee adhesion of the new neurite to
the second neuronal population, and increase the chances of syn-
apse formation. Once the connection between two previously
isolated neuronal populations was stable, the sample was incu-
bated overnight at 37°C.
We achieved instrumentation reliability, thus ensuring that
experiments could be performed routinely and that the mechan-
ically induced connection of the new neurite was stable for �24 h
(Fig. 3). The technique of manipulating PDL beads is robust: new
neurites were induced and extended in 95% of the experiments
performed (n � 103). We reproduced these experiments with
both rat hippocampal (n � 80) and cortical (n � 23) neurons
grown inside microdevices with channels (Fig. 1; Movie 3) as well
as in regular dissociated cultures (Fig. 3). In low-density dissoci-
ated neuronal cultures, PDL beads were brought in contact with
the longest neurite of a neuron (presumably an axon) to initiate a
new neurite. The new PDL bead–neurite complex was extended
and connected to a region with multiple neurites. These experi-
ments demonstrated that we could connect two previously un-
connected neuronal populations (Fig. 2).
To assess the structural components present in the new neurites,
we used fluorescent dyes and immunofluorescence techniques. The
new neurites contain the same cytoskeletal components as naturally
grown neurites, including actin, tubulin, tau, and neurofilament
(Fig.4;FranzeandGuck,2010).Neuritepullingwasthuscompatible
with concurrent extension of cytoskeletal components, suggesting
the formation of a new, structurally appropriate (and potentially
functional) neuronal extension.
Next, we investigated whether the newly formed neurite used
to connect two isolated neuronal populations was functional and
able to transmit electrical signals. Using pipette micromanipula-
tion and PDL beads, we extended a neurite from one neuronal
population and guided it across the gap to connect to neurites in
an isolated second neuronal population (Fig. 5a–c). After incu-
bation for 24 h, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings
(Fig. 5d–f).
We selected a neuron in population 1, located within a 100
�m radius from the site where the induced neurite was initiated
to record PAPs. This neuron was considered the presynaptic cell.
Postsynaptic excitatory or inhibitory activity was recorded from a
neuron in population 2, on the other side of the gap, located
within a 100 �m radius of the micromanipulated connection
(Fig. 5g–i). By using this approach, there is a high probability that
the selected presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons were not con-
nected by a single synapse but rather polysynaptically connected.
Indeed, the variable long latencies (�25 ms) between PAPs and
EPSCs across the gap are typical of polysynaptic connections
(Bray, 1984; Lamoureux et al., 2002, 2011; Rocco-Donovan et al.,
2011).
To detect events longer than monosynaptic activity (�5 ms)
and as much as �3 synaptic delays apart (�20 ms each), we
recorded signals within an interval of �100 ms from the PAP.
Recordings derived from the mechanically induced connec-
tions were analyzed and compared with those from naturally

Despite the low experimental yield for
paired patch-clamp recordings (�25%)
and cell death after measurements (De-
banne et al., 2008), we performed �100
connections of isolated neuronal popula-
tions and �30 paired patch-clamp re-
cordings. Paired patch-clamp recordings
were only performed in micromanipu-
lated connections stable for �24 h. The
results presented in Figure 5 represent the
analysis of the most stable recordings per-
formed for �1 h in the same pair of cells.
It enabled the acquisition of �1000 PAP
stimulations and sufficient data for statis-
tical significant analysis. There is no dif-
ference in the age of the cultures used for
the three experimental conditions. Each
set of three experimental conditions was
tested on the same day (DIV 15) in neuro-
nal cultures from the same origin.
Analysis of PAPs and EPSCs using lo-
gistic regression (with timing nested in ex-
periment) revealed that in the naturally
connected group the number of EPSCs
within a 100 ms epoch post-PAP was sig-
nificantly higher than within a 100 ms ep-
och pre-PAP (Fig. 5g–i; p � 0.012). When
the same analysis was performed in the
mechanically connected group, we also
observed an increase in the number of EP-
SCs 100 ms post-PAP (Fig. 5g–i; p � 0.03).
No increase of EPSCs 100 ms post-PAP
was observed in the nonconnected group
(Fig. 5g–i; p � 0.332).
Counts of the EPSCs for each condi-
tion are shown in histograms (Fig. 5j–l).
The rate of EPSCs within �100 ms of the
PAPs in the naturally versus the noncon-
nected samples was compared with logis-
tic regression model. This analysis showed
that the naturally connected sample had a
significantly higher rate of responses than
the nonconnected sample (p � 5E-8).
The same analysis was performed to com-
pare the mechanically connected versus
nonconnected samples and the mechani-
cally connected sample also had a signifi-
cantly higher rate of responses than the
nonconnected sample (p � 0.0005).

 When the mechanically connected sample was compared with
the naturally connected, the rate of the responses was signifi-
cantly higher for the naturally connected sample (p � 4.3E-5). In
addition, we performed a test of interaction between the experi-
mental groups and the timing factors and saw no evidence of
interaction (p � 0.8), indicating that each experimental group
has a different response profile.
The electrical responses after PAPs recorded from neurons
connected naturally and by micromanipulation are significantly
higher and temporally correlate with the presynaptic activity (Fig.
5g–m). Together, these results unequivocally indicate that func-
tional connections were established by the direct micromanipu-
lation of new synaptic connections.
Interestingly, the electrical responses to PAPs in the natural
and micromanipulated connection are statistically different.
Analysis of the EPSC counts show that the natural connection has
a short-latency peak (the bin from 0 to �0.01 s) in firing proba-
bility (Fig. 5h), while there is little or no short-latency peak in the
histogram of EPSCs for the mechanical connection (Fig. 5g).
These findings are consistent with the data shown in Figure 5g,
which shows medium to long latency, but no short-latency EP-
SCs for mechanical connections, and Figure 5 h, which shows
only short-latency and medium-latency EPSCs.
Differences between the electrical responses to PAPs for nat-
ural and mechanical connections could be due to different
reasons: differences in neurite maturation and differences in
number of functional synapses. In the micromanipulated con-
nection, the newly induced neurite has been connected for only
24 h, while in the natural connection the two populations have
been connected and interacting for �10 d. Therefore, new me-
chanically induced neurites may not be as mature or functional as
the natural neurites, resulting in differences in conduction veloc-
ity and in synaptic transmission. In addition, differences in the
number of synapses involved and path followed by the electrical
stimuli in each neuronal population may also contribute to the
differences between micromanipulated and natural connections.
Our technique opens a new field for the study and comparison of
natural and micromanipulated neuronal connections.
Paired whole-cell patch-clamp recording have very low exper-
imental yield and cause cell death after measurements. To over-
come these limitations, future studies will need new platforms to
more precisely stimulate, record, and compare neuronal activity
in natural and micromanipulated connections.
Discussion
This work shows for the first time that it is possible to create new
neurites, elongate them for hundreds of micrometers in �1 h,
and functionally connect the new neurites to any desired target to
(re)wire neuronal networks. The great advantage of the current
technique is that it is not necessary to wait for neurites to natu-
rally grow, eventually interact with chemical cues, possibly turn
toward a target, and maybe form functional connections. The
present technique overcomes limitations found with previous
approaches and offers high precision and control to induce the
formation of a new neurite from a presynaptic bouton and me-
chanically extend new neurites at unprecedented speed to func-
tionally connect to a chosen target.
This method has the potential to rapidly bridge gaps formed
by neural scar tissue. Therapies for functional recovery after ax-
onal injury have focused on biochemical cues to reproduce the
sequence of events during axonal growth, namely growth cone
assembly followed by axonal extension and synapse formation
(Chew et al., 2012). Despite the development of promising new
drugs, achieving long-distance axonal regeneration to establish
functional connectivity that mimics the intact nervous system has
remained a major challenge (Chew et al., 2012).
Previous studies have shown elongation of axons at 20–40
�m/h by applying mechanical tension to an existing growth cone
(Bray, 1984; Lamoureux et al., 1998, 2002, 2011; Pfister et al.,
2004, 2006). Here we show that new neurites can be created with-
out a pre-existing growth cone and extended �60 times faster
than previously reported. We can extend new neurites at 0.5 �m/
min over the first 5 �m followed by fast extension at an average
speed of 20 � 10 �m/min up to distances of 840 �m (limited only
by instrumentation).
Axons undergoing slow stretch are structurally indistinguish-
able from those naturally grown (Pfister et al., 2004), suggesting
that axonal growth is not limited by cellular components, but
rather by limitations imposed by growth-cone performance,
which exerts relatively little tension to exploit the full intrinsic
capacity of axons to elongate (Lamoureux et al., 1998). In addi-
tion, stretched PNS neurons retain the ability to transmit active
electrical signals (Pfister et al., 2004).
Our findings reveal that the newly created CNS neurites con-
tain the main structural components of naturally grown neurites
and are able to transmit electrical signals. To the best of our
knowledge these measurements are the first micromanipulated
neuronal connections. No data on electrical signal propagation
through neuronal micromanipulated connections was found
in the literature to compare with the results obtained here. Over-
all, the postsynaptic activity of the micromanipulated and natural
connections is significantly higher compared with the noncon-
nected neuronal populations. Micromanipulated and natural
connections show significantly more responses after than before
the onset of the PAPs. In contrast, no significant increase was
observed in nonconnected neuronal populations. The present
work shows that it is possible to create and control new functional
neuronal connections. Clearly more studies need to be done to
understand whether and how micromanipulated connections
differ from natural ones. We are currently investigating new,
noninvasive electronic platforms as alternatives to whole-cell
patch-clamp recordings to perform long-term high-throughput
analysis of signal propagation in micromanipulated neuronal
connections.
The technique presented here offers a new platform to obtain
faster, more detailed and much more controlled data on how
neurons communicate, how networks modulate signals, and how
neurite growth and regeneration occurs. This method enables the
systematic engineering of interconnection patterns in neuronal
networks, allowing the creation of reproducible topologies in
vitro. Also, this method, because it enables control of the length
and diameter of the induced neurite and the easy generation of a
predefined, controlled neuronal connectivity or topology, could
