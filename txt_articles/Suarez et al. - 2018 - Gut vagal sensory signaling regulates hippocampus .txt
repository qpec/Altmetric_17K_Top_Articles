The vagus nerve is the primary means of neural communication between the gastrointestinal
(GI) tract and the brain. Vagally mediated GI signals activate the hippocampus (HPC), a brain
region classically linked with memory function. However, the endogenous relevance of GI-
derived vagal HPC communication is unknown. Here we utilize a saporin (SAP)-based
lesioning procedure to reveal that selective GI vagal sensory/afferent ablation in rats impairs
HPC-dependent episodic and spatial memory, effects associated with reduced HPC neuro-
trophic and neurogenesis markers. To determine the neural pathways connecting the gut to
the HPC, we utilize monosynaptic and multisynaptic virus-based tracing methods to identify
the medial septum as a relay connecting the medial nucleus tractus solitarius (where GI vagal
afferents synapse) to dorsal HPC glutamatergic neurons. We conclude that endogenous GI-
derived vagal sensory signaling promotes HPC-dependent memory function via a multi-order
brainstem–septal pathway, thereby identifying a previously unknown role for the gut–brain
axis in memory control.

nergy
balance
and
metabolic-relevant
communication
between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the brain is
mediated largely by the vagus nerve. Vagal afferent/sensory
information is received first in the brain within the medial
nucleus of the solitary tract (mNTS) in the caudal brainstem and
then relayed to various hindbrain and forebrain regions via
ascending neural pathways1. Neurons in the hippocampus
(HPC), a brain region traditionally linked with learning and
memory control and more recently with feeding behavior2, are
activated by direct vagal nerve stimulation and by GI vagally
mediated signals such as mechanical distension of the stomach
and intestinal nutrient infusion3–5. In addition, rats with selective
HPC lesions are impaired in utilizing interoceptive hunger and
satiety cues to guide learned anticipatory appetitive outcomes6,
suggesting that the HPC functionally integrates GI energy
balance-relevant cues. Unknown is whether feeding-relevant GI
vagal afferent signaling endogenously impacts cognitive and
mnemonic processes that are regulated by the HPC.
Consistent with a role for vagal signaling in memory function,
vagus nerve stimulation enhances memory7, 8, facilitates HPC
neurogenesis, and increases HPC expression of brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF)9, 10, a neurotrophin that promotes
neuronal survival and differentiation, as well as synaptic plasti-
city11. These findings suggest that the vagus nerve promotes
neurogenic and neurotrophic signaling. However, these findings
involve non-physiological electrical stimulation of the cervical
vagus nerve. The endogenous relevance of vagal signaling, espe-
cially gut-innervating vagal afferent pathways, to mnemonic and
cognitive control is poorly understood. Furthermore, the neural
pathways through which vagally mediated energy-state signals are
transmitted between the GI tract and hippocampal neurons
remains to be fully understood. The mNTS, where GI-derived
vagal sensory inputs synapse, sends projections to many brain-
stem and forebrain sites, but none directly to the HPC12–14. Thus,
the neural communication between the gut and the HPC must
involve a yet unidentified multi-order neural pathway.
The present study investigated the endogenous role of GI-
derived (subdiaphragmatic) vagus nerve signaling on a variety of
HPC-dependent memory processes that involve the following: (1)
processing of external visuospatial stimuli (i.e., spatial working
memory and contextual episodic memory)15; (2) discrimination
learning based on interoceptive energy status cues (food restric-
tion vs. satiety)6; and (3) social transmission of olfactory-related
food cues16. To dissociate between the role of GI vagal sensory vs.
motor signaling on HPC-dependent memory, we utilized total
subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV; eliminates all GI vagal affer-
ents and efferents) and a novel rodent surgical approach for
selective GI vagal deafferentation in which a SAP conjugated to
cholecystokinin (CCK-SAP) is injected into the nodose ganglia
(overview of approaches in Fig. 1a, b). This recently established
procedure eliminates ~ 80% of GI-derived vagal sensory input to
the brain while leaving intact all brain-to-gut vagal motor sig-
naling, and supradiaphragmatic and colonic vagal sensory sig-
naling17. Results show that vagal gut–brain sensory signaling is
required for hippocampal-dependent learning processes based on
external and visuospatial cues, effects accompanied by reduced
hippocampal expression of neurotrophic (BDNF) and neurogenic
(doublecortin, DCX) markers. Using monosynaptic and multi-
synaptic virus-based neural pathway tracing methods, we also
identified a multi-order pathway connecting the medullary mNTS
to the dorsal HPC via medial septum (MS) input to HPC gluta-
matergic neurons.
Results
SDV and CCK-SAP impair contextual episodic memory. Novel
object in context (NOIC) learning is a rodent model of contextual
episodic memory. During day 1 of training, SDV and sham
groups exhibited similar object discrimination indices (DIs; a
measure of exploration time of both objects, Fig. 2a, left), indi-
cating that baseline preference for objects A and B did not differ
by group. On test day, SDV animals had impaired contextual
episodic memory, demonstrated by a significantly reduced DI
relative to sham animals (Fig. 2a, right; a DI above 0.50 means
animals spent more time exploring the novel object for the test
context). Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)
analyses across days revealed a significant day × group interaction
(F[1,13] = 5.564, p = 0.0347), with Newman–Keuls’ post hoc
analyses confirming a significant sham vs. SDV group difference
on day 3 (p = 0.0047) but not on day 1.

 Analogous to the SDV and sham group, CCK-SAP and SAP
(controls) groups demonstrated similar DIs on day 1 of NOIC
training (Fig. 2g, left). On test day, however, the CCK-SAP group
had a significantly reduced DI relative to the sham group (Fig. 2g,
right). Repeated-measures ANOVA analyses revealed a signifi-
cant day × group interaction (F [1,15] = 6.496, p = 0.0223), with
Newman–Keuls’ post hoc analyses confirming a significant SAP
vs. CCK-SAP group interaction on day 3 (p = 0.0241) but not on
day 1. Thus, hippocampal-dependent contextual episodic mem-
ory in rats requires intact GI vagal afferent signaling.
SDV and CCK-SAP impair spatial working memory. We
developed
a
modified
Barnes
maze
procedure
to
assess
hippocampal-dependent spatial working memory in rats in which
the spatial location of an escape hole is constant across two
consecutive trials per day, but changes each subsequent training
day. The index of learning on this task is the difference in the
number of errors (exploration of escape holes that do not contain
the escape box) from trial 2 to trial 1 for each individual training
day. Results show that the SDV group was impaired in spatial
working memory performance relative to shams (Fig. 2b, right).
Repeated-measures ANOVA analyses of average difference in
number of errors from trial 2 to trial 1 revealed significant group
main effect across the 5 training days (F[1,19] = 6.8565, p =
0.0169). Individual training day analyses showed trends toward a

 Similar to the SDV and sham groups, the CCK-SAP group was
also impaired in this task relative to SAP controls, with repeated-
measures ANOVA analyses of average error difference (T2–T1)
revealing a significant group main effect across the 5 training days
(F[1,13] = 8.66, p = 0.0114) (Fig. 2h, left). Individual training day
analyses also indicated a significant group effect in error
difference (T2–T1) on Day 2 (F[1,13] = 6.824, p = 0.0215,
ANOVA) relative to sham (Fig. 2h, right). Overall, these findings
indicate that spatial working memory in rats is impaired
following GI vagal afferent ablation.
SDV does not affect interoceptive or social learning. Depriva-
tion
intensity
discrimination
learning
is
a
hippocampal-
dependent procedure in which rats learned to use interoceptive
energy status cues (0 vs. 24 h food restriction) as discriminative
stimuli for a forthcoming food reinforcer6. Repeated-measures
ANOVA over six 8-trial blocks of training (before SDV and sham
surgeries) showed that both Group 0 + and Group 24 + learned
to respond more (anticipatory food cue entries before food pellet
delivery) during the last minute of test sessions under their
reinforced compared to non-reinforced food restriction level
(Fig. 2c), supported by a significant deprivation state × depriva-
tion group interaction (F[1,22] = 135.54, p < 0.0001) and a sig-
nificant block × deprivation state × deprivation group interaction
(F[5,110] = 13.6535, p < 0.0001). When analyzing each block
individually, Newman–Keuls’ post hoc analyses indicate that
Group 0 + responded significantly more under 0 h compared
with 24 h food deprivation during blocks 3–6 (all ps < 0.0017,
Fig. 2c, left), whereas Group 24 + responded significantly more
under 24 h compared with 0 h food deprivation during blocks 2–6
(all ps < 0.000178, Fig. 2c, right). Testing of deprivation intensity
discrimination retention occurred following recovery from SDV
and sham surgeries. Results confirmed that SDV lesions had no
impact on retention of this type of interoceptive-based dis-
crimination. In Fig. 2d, the effects of total SDV vs. sham surgery
on food cup entry during the last minute of each test session
performance when both Groups 0 + and 24 + were tested under
0 h and 24 h food deprivation are shown. Repeated-measures
ANOVA revealed no significant surgery group effect (F[1,22] =
0.0123, p = 0.9126) or deprivation level × surgery group interac-
tion
(F[1,22] = 0.1665,
p = 0.687).
Animals
in
Group
0 +
responded significantly more under 0 h than under 24 h food
deprivation (Fig. 2d, left) and those in Group 24 + responded
significantly more under 24 h than 0 h food deprivation (Fig. 2d,
right), regardless of surgical group. These conclusions are
supported by Newman–Keuls’ post hoc analyses revealing a sig-
nificant 0 h vs. 24 h deprivation state interaction for Group 0 +
SDV (p = 0.0028), Group 0 + sham (p = 0.004), Group 24 + SDV
(p = 0.000589), and Group 24 + sham (p = 0.000894). These
results suggest that in the absence of GI vagal signaling via SDV,
non-vagal cues are sufficient to sustain the learned ability to use
interoceptive energy status cues as discriminative stimuli for food
reinforcement.
Social
transmission
of
food
preference
(STFP)
is
a
hippocampal-dependent procedure involving social-based learn-
ing using olfactory cues16. Percent paired flavor preference at
testing was above 50% chance for both sham and SDV groups
(Fig.
2e,
left).
Both
sham
and
SDV
group
significantly
preferred the paired flavored chow to the non-paired flavored
chow when tested 24 h after the social interaction (Fig. 2e, right;
30 min cumulative food intake). One-way ANOVA analyses
revealed no significant SDV vs. sham group effect for 30 min
percent paired flavor preference (F[1,12] = 0.0225, p = 0.883).
Paired Student’s t-test analysis indicated a significant preference
for paired vs. non-paired flavored chow for both SDV (p = 0.014)
and sham (p = 0.014) groups. Thus, GI vagal signaling has
minimal impact on hippocampal-dependent social olfactory-
based learning.
Neither SDV nor CCK-SAP affect innate anxiety or body
weight. The Zero maze procedure is an established rodent model
of anxiety-like behavior that is similar to the elevated plus maze
procedure. ANOVA revealed no significant surgical group main
effect between SDV and shams for time spent in the open
section (F[1,19] = 0.0454, p = 0.833) (Fig. 2f; left) and number of
open section entries (F[1,19] = 4.861, p = 0.731) (Fig. 2f; right).
Similarly, ANOVA revealed no significant surgical group main
effect between CCK-SAP vs. SAP for: time in open section
(F[1, 15] = 0.0103, p = 0.92) and number of open section entries
(F[1,15] = 0, p = 1.0; groups had equal means) in the zero maze
test of innate anxiety (Supplementary Fig. 1a), as well as center
zone distance (F[1,15] = 0.198, p = 0.663), number of center zone
entries
(F[1,15] = 0.6269,
p = 0.441),
and
total
distance
(F[1,15] = 0.1784, p = 0.679) in the open field test (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1b). Thus, observed contextual episodic and spatial
working memory impairments observed in SDV and CCK-SAP
rats are unlikely to be secondary to effects on anxiety-like beha-
vior. Overall, there were three cohorts of SDV and sham
animals, and terminal body weights did not differ between sur-
gical groups in any cohort: cohort 1 underwent deprivation

 intensity discrimination task (sham: 413.54 ± 10.74, SDV: 396.78
± 11.62; p = 0.329, ANOVA), cohort 2 tested in the Barnes task
(sham: 391.19 ± 8.33, SDV: 365.09 ± 11.95; p = 0.095, ANOVA),
and cohort 3 tested in NOIC and STFP tasks (sham: 371.69 ±
7.16, SDV: 354.47 ± 11.42; p = 0.199, ANOVA). Similarly, the
cohort of SAP and CCK-SAP animals used in this study showed
no significant group differences in terminal body weight (SAP:
394.16 ± 11.04, CCK-SAP: 383.28 ± 11.53; p = 0.508, ANOVA).
Therefore, we conclude that the observed contextual episodic and
spatial working memory impairments observed in SDV and
CCK-SAP rats are unlikely to be secondary to surgical effects on
body weight regulation.
SDV and CCK-SAP reduce BDNF and DCX in the dHP.
Immunoblot analyses from dorsal HPC lysates revealed that total
SDV reduced BDNF and DCX protein expression in the dorsal
HPC relative to sham controls (Fig. 3a, b), with a significant main
effect of surgical group observed for BDNF (F[1,14] = 4.609, p =
0.049,
ANOVA)
and
DCX
(F[1,14] = 5.5133,
p = 0.034,
ANOVA). Similar to SDV, the CCK-SAP significantly reduced
levels of both proteins in the dorsal HPC relative to SAP controls
(Fig. 3c, d). This conclusion is supported by one-way ANOVA
analyses indicating a significant main effect of surgical group for
both dorsal hippocampal BDNF (F[1,13] = 4.881, p = 0.0457)
and DCX (F [1,14] = 5.494, p = 0.034) levels. On the other hand,
immunoblot analyses from whole hypothalamic lysates revealed
no significant group differences for both BDNF (F[1,13] = 0.26,
p = 0.619, ANOVA) and DCX (F[1,14] = 0.4955, p = 0.493,
ANOVA) levels in CCK-SAP vs. control SAP animals (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2 a, b), indicating that GI vagal afferent ablation is
unlikely to have systemic brain-wide impact of these neuro-
trophic (BDNF) and neurogenic (DCX) markers. Hypothalamic
tissue was not collected in SDV and sham groups, and therefore
analyses for these groups could not be included.
Following Shapiro–Wilk test of normality to confirm that the
data were normally distributed [CCK-SAP vs. SAP controls:
BDNF, W = 0.75377; DCX, W = 0.90026; DI, W = 0.96494;
spatial working memory, W = 0.94624; for SDV vs. sham
controls: BDNF, W = 0.88919; DCX, W = 0.92599; DI, W =
0.93305; spatial working memory, W = 0.91989], linear regres-
sion analyses were conducted to examine whether dorsal
hippocampal BDNF and DCX protein expression were function-
ally correlated with HPC-dependent spatial working memory
(Fig. 3e, f) and NOIC (Fig. 3g, h) task performance. For Barnes
maze, analyses included all groups (sham, SDV, SAP, and CCK-
SAP) and revealed that (1) dorsal HPC BDNF levels are
negatively correlated with average error difference (T2–T1) (F
[1,28] = 4.211, R2 = 0.1307, p = 0.0496) and (2) dorsal HPC
DCX levels showed a trend toward significant correlation with
Barnes performance (F[1,29] = 3.546, R2 = 0.1089, p = 0.0698).
These results indicate that lower levels of BDNF and DCX are
associated with poorer performance in the Barnes task. For
NOIC, analyses of SAP and CCK-SAP groups only (as HPC
lysates were not collected from SDV and sham rats that
performed NOIC) reveal a significant positive correlation for
both BDNF (F[1,13] = 5.277, R2 = 0.2887, p = 0.0389) and DCX
(F[1,13] = 7.36, R2 = 0.3615, p = 0.0178) levels with DI, indicat-
ing that lower levels of BDNF and DCX are associated with
poorer performance in contextual episodic memory.
CCK activates c-Fos in dCA3 and DG glutamatergic neurons.

(Fig. 5b) relative to saline treatment, with 93.11% and 94.35% of
c-Fos mRNA-positive cells in dCA3 (Fig. 5c) and DG (Fig. 5d)

Medial septum connects mNTS neurons to the dorsal HPC.
The medial nucleus tractus solitarius (mNTS) is the first central
nervous system (CNS) site to receive GI-derived vagal sensory
input; however, the mNTS does not communicate mono-
synaptically with the HPC13. To identify regions of possible relay
between the mNTS and HPC, a combination of retrograde and
anterograde pathway tracing was used: unilateral iontophoretic
injections of a retrograde pathway tracer targeted to the dCA3
(cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) AlexaFluor 488 (AF488) con-
jugated) (Fig. 6a, c) were combined with ipsilateral iontophoretic
injections of an anterograde pathway tracer targeted to the mNTS
(AAV1-hSyn-TurboRFP-WPRE-rBG) (Fig. 6b, d). Red fluor-
ophore (red fluorescent protein (RFP) and Cy3 following
immunohistochemistry (IHC)) anterogradely labeled axons ori-
ginating from the mNTS were found in apposition to green
fluorophore (AF488 following IHC) labeled cell bodies in the MS
that were retrogradely labeled from dCA3 in each of the three
animals that were confirmed as double hits in both injection sites
(representative appositions in Fig. 6e–g), whereas such apposi-
tions were not observed in various control animals (n = 11) in
which either (or both) injection site(s) were either undetermin-
able or adjacent to the intended target.
To further support this multi-order pathway, we utilized a
novel dual-synaptic virus-based pathway tracing approach to
examine whether mNTS neurons synpatically communicate to
the HPC via a MS relay pathway18. The AAV2/1-hSyn-Cre drives
Cre expression in first-order neurons infected at the injection site,
as well as in second-order (but not third-order) neurons based on
virion release from first-order axon terminals18. A unilateral
iontophoretic co-injection of AAV2/1-hSyn-Cre (and CTB-488 to
confirm injection site) targeted to the mNTS (at the level of the
area postrema; Fig. 7a) was followed by a pressure injection of
AAV1-CAG-FLEX-TdTomato
(a
Cre-dependent
anterograde
tracer) targeted to the MS (Fig. 7b, c). Results revealed robust
axon terminal fields in the dCA3 (Fig. 7d, e) and DG (Fig. 7h, i)
for each of the three animals that were confirmed as double hits
in both injection sites. A schematic of the rostral-caudal
distribution of axon terminal fields in the dCA3 (Fig. 7f, g) and
DG (Fig. 7j, k) from a representative double hit animal are
displayed. Axonal labeling in the dHPC was not observed for rats
(n = 13) in which either the mNTS or MS injection was absent or
adjacent to the targeted region. Overall, these results indicate the
presence of synaptic connections to the dHPC from MS neurons
that receive direct input from the mNTS.
Discussion
Our results reveal that GI-derived vagal sensory signaling endo-
genously promotes hippocampal-dependent learning and mem-
ory function in rats. Both classic nonselective (SDV; eliminates all
GI vagal afferents and efferents) and novel sensory-selective
(CCK-SAP approach; eliminates ~ 80% of upper GI vagal affer-
ents) ablative methods of GI vagal disconnection impaired hip-
pocampal (HPC)-dependent memory processes, including spatial
working memory and contextual episodic memory. Moreover,

 both ablative methods reduced expression of neurogenic (DCX)
and neurotrophic (BDNF) markers in the dorsal HPC that pro-
mote neurogenesis and plasticity, and expression of these markers
in the HPC were correlated to both spatial working memory and
contextual episodic memory. We further investigated HPC
involvement in GI vagal sensory signaling by analyzing neuronal
activation in the HPC in response to the GI-derived vagally
mediated satiation signal, CCK. Expression of c-Fos in response
to peripheral CCK was robust in the HPC, predominantly present
in glutamatergic neurons in the dorsal HPC CA3 and DG. To
identify multi-order neuronal pathways by which GI vagal sen-
sory signaling communicates to the HPC, we employed multiple
innovative multi-order neural pathway tracing strategies. These
approaches identified the MS as a relay region between the mNTS
(first site of vagal sensory input to the CNS) and the dorsal HPC
(CA3 and DG). Overall, these results reveal a novel role for gut-
to-brain communication in the control of learning and memory

Previous

using

stimulation
approaches involving non-physiological stimulation of the cer-
vical vagus nerve (and is therefore not selective to GI vagal sig-
naling) revealed improved word-recognition memory in humans
following vagus nerve stimulation8. Similarly in rodents, vagus
nerve stimulation improved retention of inhibitory-avoidance
memory7 and facilitated extinction of conditioned fear19. Our
data expand these findings by establishing a physiological role for
vagal sensory signaling, specifically that originating in the GI
tract, in HPC-dependent memory function. These findings may
have clinical relevance in relation to current treatments for obe-
sity that involve disruptive manipulation of the vagus nerve, such
as bariatric surgeries (e.g., RYGB, vertical sleeve gastrectomy)20
and chronic electrical disruption of vagal nerve signaling (e.g.,
VBLOC21).
Our results support the notion that gut to brain vagally-
mediated communication has an important role in protecting
against neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease).
For example, human patients with Alzheimer’s disease showed
improved cognition following 6 months of chronic cervical vagus
nerve stimulation treatment22. At a mechanistic level, recent
studies have indicated a functional role for the gut microbiome in
regulating the interaction between GI signaling and cognition23.
For example, in germ-free mice that lack a microbiome, hippo-
campal BDNF levels are reduced24, and these effects are asso-
ciated with cognitive dysfunction25. In addition, total SDV
impairs the ability of butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid synthesized
by colonic microbiota, to reduce appetite and prevent diet-
induced obesity26, suggesting a critical need for preservation of
vagal nerve signaling in the microbiome–gut–brain axis. Given
that butyrate promotes hippocampal neurogenesis and memory
function27, one possible mechanism linking GI vagal afferent
signaling to HPC function is via gut microbial interactions with
short-chain fatty acid production.
We examined the effects of SDV-mediated GI vagal ablative
disconnection on a variety of HPC-dependent mnemonic and
cognitive processes that rely on the utilization of different cues
(external, interoceptive, social, olfactory), and that differ in their
reliance on discrete HPC subregions. Of the various memory
procedures assessed, SDV significantly impaired spatial working

 memory (Barnes maze procedure) and contextual episodic
memory (NOIC), whereas performance in appetitive learning
based on internal energy-state cues (deprivation intensity dis-
crimination) and social transmission of food-related (olfactory)
cues (STFP) was preserved. The lack of group differences between
SDV and control animals for both deprivation intensity dis-
crimination and STFP learning could be due to differential effects
of vagal nerve signaling on two functionally and anatomically-
independent subregions of the HPC, as studies have shown the
dorsal (septal in rodents, posterior in primates) HPC is associated
predominantly with visuospatial-based exteroceptive memory,
whereas the ventral (temporal in rodents, anterior in primates)
HPC is associated with conditioned appetitive and anxiety-like
behaviors2, 28, 29. The contextual episodic (NOIC) and spatial
working memory (Barnes maze) tasks used in the present study
rely on the integration of visuospatial external environmental
cues. Conversely, deprivation intensity discrimination and STFP
rely on conditioned appetitive cues (internal energy-state and
social cues, respectively). Deprivation intensity discrimination
learning is impaired by lesions to complete, dorsal, or ventral

 HPC6, 29, whereas STFP is primarily linked with ventral hippo-
campal substrates16. Thus, overall our data suggest gut-derived
vagal signaling promotes memory involving external environ-
mental cues (that may rely predominantly on the dorsal HPC),
while having less impact on conditioned appetitive and anxiety-
like behaviors (that may rely predominantly on the ventral HPC).
Considering these findings, we hypothesize that interoceptive
processing for deprivation intensity discrimination learning is
sustained in the absence of GI vagal input, and may therefore
primarily involve circulating endocrine and other metabolic sig-
nals that communicate to the HPC. Consistent with this frame-
work, injections of the gut-derived hunger hormone, ghrelin, into

 the ventral but not dorsal HPC increase food intake30, and
intracerebroventricular ghrelin injections generalize to 24 h food
restriction in non-restricted rats trained in the deprivation dis-
crimination task31. However, one limitation of the design with
regards to comparing across these different tasks is that the
learning of interoceptive and social cue-based tasks occurred at
different times post surgery. Further, although the experimental
design was consistent across surgical groups with regards to time
between surgery and behavioral testing, complete counter-
balancing of behavioral experiments that involved multiple
comparisons was not employed and is therefore a limitation of
the study.
Episodic memory, or memory of a specific event, is HPC-
dependent and was impaired by SDV (NOIC procedure). Epi-
sodic memories are important for the control of feeding behavior
and energy balance, as they are critical for animals to remember
aspects about where (food location), what (nutritive vs. adverse
postingestive consequences), and when eating occurs. Consistent
with this notion, experimental manipulations in human subjects
designed to disrupt episodic memory during feeding increase
hunger
ratings
and
food
intake
at
a
subsequent
eating
episode32, 33. Similarly in rats, disruption of episodic meal-related
memory via postprandial dorsal hippocampal infusion of mus-
cimol decreases the latency to start the post-infusion meal and
increases the size of the post-infusion meal34. From an evolu-
tionary perspective, the physiological role of GI-derived vagal
sensory signaling in HPC-dependent memory may normally
function to enhance episodic memory for eating occasions, as GI
vagal sensory signaling is most heavily engaged during feeding.
Moreover, given that it is advantageous to remember the physical
location of the food source to inform future foraging behavior, the
visuospatial external environment is likely to be a critical com-
ponent of episodic meal-related memories. From this perspective,
GI vagal sensory signaling during meal taking represents an
advantageous biological survival mechanism that promotes meal-
related episodic memory to facilitate future feeding.
Based on the impaired spatial working and contextual episodic
memory following SDV (that eliminates both GI sensory and
motor signaling), we next demonstrated that a novel selective GI
vagal sensory ablation surgical method (CCK-SAP) also impaired
both of these HPC-dependent memory processes. These findings
suggest that GI vagal sensory/afferent (and not motor/efferent)
signaling promotes HPC-dependent memory. The CCK-SAP
approach selectively eliminates ~ 80% of GI-derived vagal afferent
signaling below the diaphragm17, which differs from the estab-
lished
surgical
subdiaphragmatic
deafferentation
procedure
(SDA), which involves cutting the vagal sensory (afferent) rootlets
unilaterally near the brainstem interface and then ablating the
contralateral subdiaphragmatic vagal trunk. SDA eliminates all GI
vagal to mNTS sensory signaling, while leaving 50% of supra-
diaphragmatic sensory and 50% of vagal motor (efferent) sig-
naling intact35. Previous work has shown that SDA has no effect
on novel object recognition memory or working memory in a
non-spatial alternation task36. In contrast, here we show that both
SDV and CCK-SAP impairs a similar NOIC task. Although novel
object recognition relies on visual object recognition memory (i.e.,
the animal must remember, which object it has previously seen),
the NOIC test relies on external visuospatial and/or contextual
memory (i.e., animal must remember the location in which it
previously encountered an object). Based on previous work, it
remains controversial whether the HPC is critically involved in
novel object recognition learning, but rather mediates recognition
memory when it requires remembering that a stimulus occurred
in a certain place or time37. The perirhinal cortical area, on the
other hand, is more strongly linked novel object recognition
memory, as lesions to this brain region impair the ability of
animals to discriminate between familiar and novel objects37–39.
Moreover, rats presented with novel versus familiar objects or
pictures have increased c-Fos expression in perirhinal cortex but
not HPC, whereas the HPC, but not perirhinal cortex shows
increased c-Fos expression in response to novel spatial arrange-
ments of familiar objects40, 41. Whether or not the SDA approach,
like SDV and CCK-SAP approaches, impairs spatial and/or
contextual-based HPC-dependent memory requires further study.
STFP and NOIC involve consumption of novel foods and
exposure to novel objects, respectively, which are also used to
assess anxiety-like behavior in rodents (neophobia). Thus, we
tested both SDV and CCK-SAP rats in the zero maze anxiety test.
Moreover, we also tested the CCK-SAP animals in an additional
anxiety-relevant task, the open field test. Results revealed no
significant group differences in either SDV or CCK-SAP groups
relative to controls in these anxiety-related tests. These results
differ from a previous study that demonstrated reduced innate
anxiety-like behavior in SDA rats42. These effects could be due to
procedural differences, as unlike the individually housed rats in
the present study, the rats in the previous study were group-
housed, which has been shown to demonstrate a decrease in
mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate relative to isolated
(single-housed) male and female Sprague–Dawley rats43, 44. In
addition, we tested the SDV and CCK-SAP groups in an elevated
zero maze, whereas the SDA rats in the previous study were tested
in an elevated plus maze. Although both the zero maze and the
elevated plus maze are well accepted tests for measuring anxiety-
like behavior in rodents, untreated/normal rats show increased
exploration time of the open areas in the elevated plus vs. zero
maze, potentially due to the time spent in the center (neutral)
region of the plus maze, to which these is no equivalent in the
zero maze45, 46. Although a more extensive analysis of anxiety was
conducted in this previous study (we did not perform the food
neophagia test), it is worth noting that the elimination of 50% of
the vagal afferents above the diaphragm via SDA could be a
potential reason for different innate anxiety-like effects of SDA
relative to SDV and CCK-SAP animals, as the supradiaphramatic
vagal afferents are preserved in these two latter approaches.
Consistent with this possibility, optogenetic activation of non-
selective vagal afferents (including those innervating cardiac
systems) robustly reduces heart rate in mice47, and transgenic
overexpression of angiotensin-(1–7) in mice chronically reduces
heart rate and is accompanied by reduced anxiety-like behavior48.
Future research is needed to directly examine the role of different
vagal afferent neuron populations in anxiety-like behavior.

 The mNTS, where GI vagal sensory input arrives in the CNS,
does not send direct projections to the HPC13. Here we show that
peripheral injections of CCK, a vagally mediated GI-derived
satiation signal, significantly increased c-Fos protein and mRNA
expression in the dorsal HPC CA3 and DG, suggesting a multi-
order connection between mNTS and the dHPC. We utilized a
monosynaptic co-injection neural pathway tracing method to
identify the MS as a possible relay region connecting mNTS to the
HPC49. As this method does not determine synaptic commu-
nication between immunoreactive cell bodies (back-labeled from
the CA3) in apposition to axon terminals emanating from the
mNTS, we employed a dual-synaptic viral-mediated anterograde
tracing method and confirmed the MS as a mNTS to HPC relay
region18. Although the dual-synaptic AAV1-Cre can be trans-
ported in both the anterograde and retrograde (from axon
terminals) direction18, we limited the application to a pathway
where there are no reciprocal connections between targeted pre-
and postsynaptic regions. While the mNTS projects to the MS,
descending MS projections do not project to the caudal brain-
stem50. Previous studies have established a role of septal choli-
nergic
function
in
HPC-dependent
learning
and
memory
processes. Future work could investigate whether cholinergic
signaling is critical in regulating GI vagal modulation of HPC-
dependent spatial working and episodic memory function.
Collective results from the present study demonstrate that
endogenous vagal afferent signaling from the GI tract regulates
HPC-dependent contextual episodic and spatial working mem-
ory, potentially by driving the expression of memory-related
neurotrophic (BDNF) and neurogenic (DCX) signaling pathways.
These findings compliment and expand previous work using
cervical vagus nerve stimulation, as well as a recent report
showing that total SDV in mice reduces HPC DCX51. We further
identify the MS as a likely relay connecting the gut to glutama-
tergic dorsal HPC neurons. Our results further expand previous
work by revealing that gut-derived signals, either vagal36, 42 or
endocrine52, interact with higher-order brain regions to regulate
memory and cognition. These findings have direct clinical rele-
vance, as common bariatric surgeries partially denervate vagal
signaling20, 53, 54 and chronic vagus nerve blockade (VBLOC) was
recently Food and Drug Administration-approved for obesity
treatment21. Future studies investigating the neuroendocrine and
neural pathways conveying energy-relevant signals between the
GI tract and the HPC (and other regions of the telencephalon and
cortex) will provide additional insight into the complex role of
gut-to-brain communication in cognitive control.
Methods
Animals. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (Envigo; 320–450 g on arrival) were indivi-
dually housed with ad libitum access (except where noted) to water and chow
(LabDiet 5001, LabDiet, St. Louis, MO) on 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at
08:00 h). All procedures involving animals were approved by the University of
Southern California Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee.
Total SDV. Rats were habituated to liquid diet (Research Diets; AIN76A) for five
days before surgery. Following a 24 h fast and under ketamine (90 mg/kg), xylazine
(2.7 mg/kg), and acepromazine (0.64 mg/kg) anesthesia and analgesia (Metacam 2
mg/kg), the trunks of the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve were transected as
described previously55. A midline abdominal incision was made and then the
stomach was retracted caudally and the liver was retracted cranially to expose the
esophagus. The dorsal and ventral branches of the vagus were then dissected from
the esophagus. Each vagal branch was ligated twice with a surgical thread at an
interval of 1–2 cm, and then cauterized between the ligatures. In sham surgeries,
the trunks were exposed but the vagus nerve was not ligated or cauterized. The
incision was then closed with running sutures along the abdominal wall and stop
sutures along the skin. Rats were allowed to recover until liquid diet intake sta-
bilized (at least 1 week) and were then returned to a standard chow diet. After
behavioral testing, SDV was verified functionally with i.p. CCK-induced food
intake reduction as described56, 57. Briefly, the functional verification consists of
analysis of food intake following i.p. CCK-8 (2 μg/kg; Bachem) or saline injections
(treatments given counterbalanced on separate days) after an overnight fast. SDV
rats were included in the statistical analysis if CCK treatment resulted in a < 30%
reduction of their food intake, as described57, 58. Of the three separate cohorts of
rats that underwent SDV surgery and subsequent behavioral testing, four animals
were removed from deprivation intensity discrimination analyses and one animal
was removed from NOIC analyses based on these criteria.
CCK-SAP nodose ganglia injection. CCK-SAP targets CCK receptor expressing
cells, which are localized on vagal afferent neurons that specifically innervate the
upper GI tract59, 60. As recently confirmed, CCK-SAP injection in the nodose
ganglia (vagal afferent cell bodies) selectively eliminates ~ 80% of GI-derived vagal
afferent signaling, while preserving colonic and supradiaphragmatic vagal sensory
pathways, as well as all vagal efferents17. Twenty-four hours before surgery, rats
were given 15 ml of condensed milk in addition to their normal ad libitum access to
chow and water, and were fasted before lights went off (18:00 h). Twenty minutes
before surgery, rats received an i.p. injection of atropine sulfate (0.05 mg/kg) and
carprofen (5.0 mg/kg; Henry Schein), and then anesthetized with a ketamine (90
mg/kg), xylazine (2.7 mg/kg), and acepromazine (0.64 mg/kg) cocktail. A midline
incision was made along the length of the neck. The vagus nerve was separated
from the carotid artery with Graefe forceps until the nodose ganglion was visible
and accessible. A glass capillary (20 μm tip, beveled 30° angle) attached to a
micromanipulator was used to position and puncture the nodose ganglion and 1 µl
volume of CCK-SAP (250 ng/µl) or SAP (250 ng/µl) was injected with a Picos-
pritzer III injector (Parker Hannifin) at two sites: 0.5 µl rostral and 0.5 µl caudal to
the laryngeal nerve branch. The same procedure was performed for both nodose
ganglia on either side before the skin was closed with sterile and stop sutures along
the skin. Rats were returned to their home cage and deprived of water for 6 h and
food overnight. The post-op care was optimized to avoid excessive weight loss post
surgery and increase survival rate, as previously described61. The schedule was as
follows: Day 1 post-op rats received carprofen (5.0 mg/kg; SQ) and were given ad
libitum access to condensed milk; day 2 post-op rats received mash (10 g powdered
chow mixed with 20 ml condensed milk diluted as described above); day 3 post-op
rats received mash and solid chow pellets; day 4 and onwards, rats were given ad
libitum access to chow. After behavioral testing, CCK-SAP was verified functionally
with i.p. CCK-induced food intake reduction. The functional verification modeled
that of the SDV approach described above and that published for CCK-SAP in17.
Based on this verification test, four CCK-SAP rats were removed from all analyses.
General research design. Three separate cohorts of rats underwent SDV (or
sham) surgery and subsequent behavioral testing (described below), beginning
7 days post surgery. Cohort 1 underwent deprivation intensity discrimination
training (described below) in which rats were assigned to one of two groups (group
assignment matched based on body weight): Group 0 + (n = 16) or Group 24 +
(n = 11). After asymptotic discrimination was reached, animals were then sub-
divided (matched based on body weight and performance over the last 8-trial block
of training) into two additional groups to receive SDV (Group 0 + , n = 7; Group
24 + , n = 5) or sham (Group 0 + , n = 8; Group 24 + , n = 6) surgery 4 days after
the last training day. After 7 days of post-surgery recovery, the animals were tested
on deprivation discrimination performance for one 8-trial block (see Supplemen-
tary Table 1). Seven days after deprivation discrimination testing, animals in
Cohort 1 were tested in the zero maze task. Cohort 2 (SDV n = 8; sham n = 8) was
tested in the spatial working memory task (5 days, described below) 7 days post
surgery. Five to 6 days later, dHPC tissue was harvested from Cohort 2 for
immunblot analyses of BDNF and DCX (SDV, n = 8; sham, n = 8) (see Supple-
mentary Methods). Cohort 3 (SDV n = 6, sham n = 9) was tested in the NOIC
(5 days) task 14 days post surgery, followed by STFP 21 days post surgery (STFP;
3 days). For STFP (described below), the SDV and sham groups were observers,
whereas demonstrator rats (non-operated, n = 8) were housed in a separate room
from the observers. Based on results from our SDV experiments, CCK-SAP (n = 9)
and SAP (control, n = 8)] rats were tested in the Barnes task (beginning 7 days post
surgery; matching the timeline of post surgery SDV Barnes testing) followed by the
NOIC task (beginning 14 days post surgery; matching the timeline of post surgery
SDV NOIC testing). Seven days after NOIC testing, animals were tested in the zero
maze task followed by the open field task 3 days later. Five to 6 days later, dHPC
tissue was harvested for immunblot analyses of BDNF (CCK-SAP, n = 8; SAP, n =
7) and DCX (CCK-SAP, n = 8; SAP, n = 8) (see Supplementary Methods; see
Supplementary Fig. 3 for uncropped scan of CCK-SAP vs. SAP BDNF blot).
Groups were assigned matched according to body weight at the beginning of each
experiment. For all video analyses for behavioral variables, experimenters were
blinded to group assignments of the animals.
Novel object in context. NOIC incorporates object recognition within a specific
context, a test of contextual episodic memory. Procedures followed those pre-
viously described15, 62. Rats undergo 2 days of habituation: half of the rats
(counterbalanced within surgical groups) are able to freely explore Context 1, a
semi-transparent box (15 in W × 24 in L × 12 in H) with orange stripes, for 5 min,
whereas the other half are habituated to Context 2, a gray opaque box (17 in W ×
17 in L × 16 in H). The following day, groups are switched and habituated to the
other context under the same conditions. Twenty-four hours later, on day 1 of

 NOIC, each animal is exposed to two distinct objects: a 500 ml jar filled with blue
water (object A) and a square glass container (object B) in Context 1. The next day,
the animals are placed in Context 2 with duplicates of object A. Twenty-four hours
later the animals are placed in the previous day’s location (Context 2) with objects
A & B and investigation of both objects is measured. Each day consists of 5 min
sessions and contexts are cleaned with 10% ETOH between each animal.
Exploration is defined as sniffing or touching the object with the nose or forepaws.
The task scoring involves recording of the time spent exploring an object novel to
the context vs. time spent exploring an object familiar to the context, and calcu-
lation of a novelty or DI is based on these measurements and calculated as
[Exploration of object B/(Exploration of object A + object B)]. Rats normally will
preferentially investigate object B given that object B is a familiar object that is now
presented in a novel context. NOIC is hippocampal dependent, as performance is
impaired in rats with reversible muscimol-induced inactivation of the dorsal HPC
CA115.
Spatial working memory. Spatial working memory is a component of short-term
memory involving encoding and remembering information about one’s environ-
ment and spatial orientation. The spatial working memory task used in the present
study involves an elevated white circular Barnes maze (Diameter: 122 cm, Height:
140 cm) with 18 holes evenly spaced around the outer edge of the table’s cir-
cumference. A hidden black escape box (38.73 cm × 11.43 cm × 7.62 cm) is placed
under one of the holes. There are four sets of visuospatial cues (black and white
stripes, a white circle, a red triangle, and an assortment of irregular shapes) placed
on each of the walls surrounding the table. One day after the habituation session,
spatial working memory training begins. Rats utilize visuospatial cues to learn the
location of the escape box, while being exposed to mildly aversive stimuli (120 W
bright overhead light, 75 db white noise), which motivates them to find the escape
box to avoid these stimuli63. Each rat receives two trials per day for five training
days. The two trials are separated by 2 min (during which the maze is cleaned and
rotated). Importantly, the escape box is placed in the same location for both trials
that occur on each individual training day, but is placed in a new location at the
beginning of the first trial for each subsequent training day. Errors are measured as
investigation of holes that do not contain the escape box, and spatial working
memory is measured as the difference in the number of errors from trial 2 to trial 1
on each separate training day (which is then averaged over the five training days).
Control rats (Controls, Fig. 2b below) show improved performance (fewer errors)
on the second trial of each training day compared to the 1st, indicating that the
spatial location of the escape hole can be integrated into working memory capacity
in control rats.
Deprivation intensity discrimination. Deprivation intensity discrimination
involves learning to use different levels of food restriction as interoceptive dis-
criminative stimuli for sucrose reinforcement. The behavioral paradigm follows
that from previous publications6, 31, 64. Training: Rats are divided into Group 0 +
or Group 24 + and food deprivation levels alternate each day between 0 and 24 h
for the entire experiment. Group 0 + receives a reinforcement of five sucrose
pellets (45 mg, Product F06233, Bio-Serv) at the end of 4 min training sessions that
take place under 0 h food deprivation, and receive no pellets during training ses-
sions that take place under 24 h deprivation. Group 24 + receives the opposite
contingency between food deprivation level and pellet delivery. During sessions in
which rats were trained under their non-rewarded deprivation condition, the
feeders operated but no pellets were delivered. The rats were then given 2 min to
consume the pellets before being removed from the conditioning chambers and
returned back to their home cages. Training sessions always occurred at the same
time of day (10:00 h), but not every day to avoid a single-alternating schedule of
pellet delivery. The index of learning in the deprivation intensity discrimination
task is food-anticipatory responding (head pokes in sucrose pellet delivery location;
detected with photobeam interruptions/magazine entries) during the 1 minute
prior to pellet delivery. More specifically, the mean of the percentage of the three
20 s intervals during the last minute of the session in which the magazine pho-
tobeam was interrupted was calculated as the dependent variable (as we’ve pre-
viously described6). Rats with HPC lesions are impaired in learning and retention
of this discrimination problem6, 65, indicating that the HPC is critical for this type
of learning process. Training consisted of six eight-trial blocks (eight trials for each
deprivation state per training block), and testing (same procedures as training)
consisted of one eight-trial block 7 days after surgical recovery.
Social transmission of food preference. STFP learning involves the utilization of
olfactory cues experienced during a social encounter to guide subsequent preference
for a scented food. STFP task procedures were adapted from16. Briefly, demonstrators
(non-treated rats) and observers (surgicated rats, controls and experimental) are first
habituated to an unscented powdered rodent chow [LabDiet 5001 (ground pellets)]
overnight. Twenty-four hours later, observers are then assigned to demonstrators (1
demonstrator assigned for 2 observers, counterbalanced by observer group) and are
habituated to social interaction by being placed in a social interaction arena (23.5 cm
W × 44.45 cm L × 27 cm H; clear plastic bin with Sani-chip bedding covering the
bottom) to interact with each other for 30 min. The next day following a 23 h period of
food restriction for all rats, demonstrators are given access to one of two flavors of
powdered chow (flavored with 2.5% marjoram or 0.5% thyme; counterbalanced) for
30 min in a separate room from observers. Consistent with previous published work66,
our pilot studies demonstrated that animals equally prefer these flavors of chow. The
demonstrator is then immediately placed in the social interaction arena with one of
their two assigned observer rats and allowed to socially interact for 30 min, followed
immediately by a 30 min interaction with the second assigned observer rat (observer
rat order counterbalanced across experimental groups). Immediately after social
interactions, observers are then returned to their home cages and allowed to eat ad
libitum for 1 h. Twenty-four hours later, the 23 h food-restricted observers are tested
for STFP by placing two jars in the home cage: one containing paired flavor (flavored
chow that was given to the demonstrator) and the other with non-paired flavor (novel
flavored chow not given to the demonstrator animal). Rats are then allowed to eat for
1 h and % preference for the paired flavor is calculated by: 100*Demonstrator-paired
flavored chow intake/Demonstrator + Novel flavored chow intake. Cumulative food
intake for paired and non-paired flavors are calculated. Untreated control animals
learn to prefer the demonstrator-paired flavor based on social interaction and olfactory
food cues from the breath of the demonstrator rat; however, lesioning the dorsal HPC
impairs consolidation of this preference learning.
Zero maze. Seven days following memory test procedures, all groups of rats (SDV,
sham, CCK-SAP, and SAP) were tested in the zero maze task to examine anxiety-
like behavior. The zero maze is an elevated circular track, divided into four equal
length sections. Two sections were open with 3 cm high curbs, whereas the two
other closed sections contained 17.5 cm high walls. Animals were placed in the
maze for 5 min before being returned to the home cage. After the trial, the maze
was cleaned with 10% ethanol. Innate anxiety was measured as the number of open
section entries and total time spent in open sections, defined as the head and front
two paws in open sections. Previous studies have demonstrated that animals with
high levels of innate anxiety (based on anxiolytic and anxiogenic experimental
manipulations) spend less time in the open sections compared with animals with
low levels of innate anxiety67.
Open field. Three days following zero maze procedures, the CCK-SAP rats were
then tested in the open field task, another behavioral paradigm used in rodents to
evaluate innate anxiety-like behavior67. Open field procedures are derived from42.
The apparatus consists of a gray Plexiglas arena (60 cm × 56 cm), and a designated
center zone within the arena (19 cm × 17.5 cm), placed under diffused lighting (30
lux). Animals are placed in one of the bin’s four corners and allowed to freely
explore for 10 minutes. The apparatus is cleaned with 10% ethanol between rats.
Innate anxiety was measured as the number of entries into the center zone, distance
moved in center zone, and total distance moved in the entire arena. Previous work
has shown that animals with innate anxiety-like behavior will spend less time in the
center zone and more time in close proximity to the walls compared with animals
with low levels of innate anxiety67.
c-Fos protein and mRNA expression. Nonsurgicated rats (n = 11) received i.p.
injections of either saline (n = 5) or CCK (n = 6) (CCK-8, 8 μg/kg; Bachem), 90
min before perfusion and tissue was collected and processed as described above for
IHC and FISH processing. IHC detection of c-Fos was performed using rabbit anti-
c-Fos primary antibody (1:500, Cell Signaling, Catalog number: 2250 s) followed by
a donkey anti-rabbit IgG-AlexaFluor AF488 secondary antibody (1:500, Jackson
Immunoresearch, RRID: AB_2340619). In the same animals, mRNA detection
followed FISH procedures (see Supplementary Methods) and used c-Fos (ACD,
Catalog number: 403591), VGLUT1 (ACD, Catalog number: 317001), or GAD2
(ACD, Catalog number: 435801) probes. Representative images and quantification
for c-Fos protein and mRNA expression in dCA3 and DG obtained from both i.p.
saline and CCK injected animals were confined to Swanson Atlas level 28–3068.
Co-injection neural tracing. Neural pathway tracing experiments utilized two
tracing techniques: co-injection monosynaptic neural tracing to identify second-
order relay connections (COIN)49 and Cre-mediated dual-synaptic anterograde
tracing (below)18. Iontophoresis was performed using a precision current source
(Digital Midgard Precision Current Source, Stoelting) as described previously69.
Rats (n = 14) received unilateral iontophoretic injections of AAV1-TurboRFP
(AAV1-hSyn-TurboRFP-WPRE-rBG; Penn Vector Core, Catalog number:
V5574L) targeting the mNTS and, in the same animal, CTB-488 (CTB, AlexaFluor
488 conjugate; ThermoFisher, Catalog number: C22841) targeting the dCA3.
Following a 12-day survival period, animals were fixation-perfused and tissue was
collected and processed as described in Supplementary Methods. The native
fluorescent signal was amplified using a cocktail of mouse anti-CTB (1:500, Abcam,
Catalog number: ab62429) and rabbit anti-RFP (1:2000, Rockland, RRID:
AB_2209751) primary antibodies followed by a cocktail of donkey anti-mouse IgG-
AF488 secondary antibody (1:500, Jackson Immunoresearch, RRID: AB_2341099)
and donkey anti-rabbit IgG-Cy3 (1:500, Jackson Immunoresearch, RRID:
AB_2307443). Detection of AAV1 and CTB was by visualization of red (TurboRFP
and Cy3) and green (AlexaFluor 488) fluorescence. In 3 of the 14 animals, injection
sites were confined to the mNTS (AAV1) and dCA3 (CTB) in the same animal.
Similar neuroanatomical labeling was observed in each of these three animals and
representative images were obtained from one of these animals. Experimental

 controls (n = 11) were included when neither anterograde nor retrograde labeling
was observed in the MS following injection sites adjacent to (respectively) the
mNTS or dCA3 that did not include these regions.
Cre-mediated multisynaptic anterograde tracing. Rats (n = 16) received a
unilateral iontophoretic co-injection of AAV-Cre (4:5; AAV1-hSyn-Cre-WPRE-
hGH; Penn Vector Core, Catalog number: CS1087) and, to determine injection site,
CTB-488 (1:5; ThermoFisher, Catalog number: C22841) in the mNTS. Next, the
rats received a 200 nl pressure injection of AAV-Flex-tdTomato (diluted 1:2 in 0.1
M sodium phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, AAV1-CAG-Flex-tdTomato-WPRE-
rBG; Penn Vector Core) in the MS. Following a 3-week survival period, animals
were perfused and tissue was collected and processed as described in Supplemen-
tary Methods. AAV1-Flex-TdTomato and CTB-488 was detected based on a
combination of native fluorescence of RFP and green fluorescent protein, respec-
tively, and amplification of signal using the same cocktail of primary and secondary
antibodies as described in the co-injection neural tracing section. Representative
images were obtained from one of the three animals with both CTB-488 and
AAV1-Flex-tdTomato injection sites that were predominantly confined to the
mNTS (CTB) and MS (AAV1), respectively (similar labeling was observed in the
other two animals that were double hits). The specificity of this connection was
further supported by the absence of axon labeling in dCA3 and DG following MS
injections of AAV-FLEX-TdTomato alone (n = 3; w/AAV2/1-hSyn-Cre injections
adjacent to mNTS), mNTS injections of AAV2/1-hSyn-Cre alone (n = 4; w/AAV-
FLEX-TdTomato injections adjacent to the MS), or in rats in which either injection
site was off target (misses, n = 6).
Statistical analyses. Terminal body weights and zero maze performance data
were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, with surgery group as a between-subjects
factor for both SDV and CCK-SAP groups. NOIC was analyzed using repeated-
measures ANOVA with surgical group (between-subjects) and testing day (within-
subjects) as factors for both SDV and CCK-SAP experiments, with Newman–Keuls
post hoc comparisons to evaluate group differences on each separate day. Spatial
working memory data (Barnes maze) were analyzed using repeated-measures
ANOVA across training days with surgical group as a between-subjects variable
and training day as a within-subjects variable. The deprivation intensity dis-
crimination test data were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA with sur-
gical and deprivation (0 + , 24 + ) assignment group as between-subjects factors,
with deprivation state as a within-subjects factor, and Newman–Keuls post hoc
tests for individual group × deprivation state comparisons. The STFP percent
paired flavor preference data was analyzed using one-way ANOVA with surgical
group as a within-subjects factor. Postmortem immunoblot for both SDV and
CCK-SAP groups were analyzed using ANOVA with surgical group as a between-
subjects factor. Linear regressions were used to calculate p-values, R2 goodness-of-
fit, 95% confidence bands of the best-fit line, and linear equations between NOIC
and Barnes data with protein level data by surgical group. All groups (SDV, CCK-
SAP, and their controls) were analyzed for linear regression of HPC protein
expression vs. Barnes performance, whereas only CCK-SAP and their controls were
analyzed for HPC protein expression vs. NOIC performance (as immunoblot HPC
tissue was not extracted from SDV and sham/controls that underwent NOIC
testing). Normality was confirmed for all analyses using Shapiro–Wilk’s test. c-Fos
protein and mRNA expression levels in dCA3 and DG were analyzed using one-
way ANOVA with drug treatment group as a between-subject factor. All statistical
analyses were performed using the statistical software Statistica (Version 7; Stat-
soft) and linear regressions analyses were performed using Prism 7 (GraphPad)
statistical software. Sample size was chosen based on a priori power analyses
(conducted in Statistica V7) to ensure sufficient power to detect a pre-specified
effect size. Pre-established exclusion criteria used was the Grubbs test for outliers
(conducted in Prism 7). ANOVAs were followed by Newman–Keuls post hoc
comparisons when significant main effects or interactions were obtained. Results
are presented as mean ± SE. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
