BACKGROUND: Diagnostic and interventional procedures are often facilitated by moderate 
procedure-related sedation. Many studies support the overall safety of this sedation; however, 
adverse cardiovascular and respiratory events are reported in up to 70% of these procedures, 
more frequently in very young, very old, or sicker patients. Monitoring with pulse oximetry may 
underreport hypoventilation during sedation, particularly if supplemental oxygen is provided. 
Capnometry may result in false alarms during sedation when patients mouth breathe or dis-
place sampling devices. Advanced monitor use during sedation may allow event detection 
before complications develop. This 2-part pilot study used advanced monitors during planned 
moderate sedation to (1) determine incidences of desaturation, low respiratory rate, and deeper 
than intended sedation alarm events; and (2) determine whether advanced monitor use is asso-
ciated with fewer alarm events.
METHODS: Adult patients undergoing scheduled gastroenterology or interventional radiology pro-
cedures with planned moderate sedation given by dedicated sedation nurses under the direction 
of procedural physicians (procedural sedation team) were monitored per standard protocols (elec-
trocardiography blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and capnometry) and advanced monitors (acoustic 
respiratory monitoring and processed electroencephalograpy). Data were collected to computers for 
analysis. Advanced monitor parameters were not visible to teams in part 1 (standard) but were visible 
to teams in part 2 (advanced). Alarm events were defined as desaturation—Spo2 ≤92%; respiratory 
depression, acoustic respiratory rate ≤8 breaths per minute, and deeper than intended sedation, 
indicated by processed electroencephalograpy. The number of alarm events was compared.
RESULTS: Of 100 patients enrolled, 10 were excluded for data collection computer malfunction 
or consent withdrawal. Data were analyzed from 90 patients (44 standard and 46 advanced). 
Advanced had fewer total alarms than standard (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney = 2.073, P = 0.038; 
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney odds, 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04–2.88). Similar numbers 
of standard and advanced had ≥1 alarm event (Wald difference, −10.2%; 95% CI, −26.4% to 
7.0%; P = 0.237). Fewer advanced patients had ≥1 respiratory depression event (Wald differ-
ence, −22.1%; 95% CI, −40.9% to −2.4%; P = 0.036) or ≥1 desaturation event (Wald difference, 
−24.2%; 95% CI, −42.8% to −3.6%; P = 0.021); but there was no significant difference in deeper 
than intended sedation events (Wald difference, −1.38%; 95% CI, −20.21% to 17.49%; P = 0.887).
CONCLUSIONS: Use of advanced monitoring parameters during planned moderate sedation 
was associated with fewer alarm events, patients experiencing desaturation, and patients expe-
riencing respiratory depression alarm events. This pilot study suggests that further study into 
the safety and outcome impacts of advanced monitoring during procedure-related sedation is 
warranted.  (Anesth Analg 2016;122:1070–8)

moderate PRS in adults has been reported to be anywhere 
from <1%2,3 to >70%.4–6 Similar adverse events are reported 
during PRS in pediatric patients.7,8 Patients with greater 
ASA physical status and very young or very old patients 
appear to be at greater risk for cardiovascular and respira-
tory adverse events during PRS.9–13
Events during PRS, such as respiratory depression, 
apnea, airway obstruction, or oxygen desaturation, have 
been reported in adult and pediatric patients and can result 
in significant morbidity.8,9,13–15 Closed-claim analysis sug-
gests that better monitoring during PRS could decrease 
the number of liability cases related to these events.16 Pulse 
oximetry may not alert procedural teams to hypoventilation 
during PRS, particularly if supplemental oxygen is provided 
to the patient during procedures.3,17,18 End-tidal carbon diox-
ide ( Etco2) monitoring by capnometry provides both wave-
form and numeric displays of respiratory rate and Etco2. Its 
use during moderate PRS allows for detection of respira-
tory depression and apnea19–21 and is reported to decrease 
the incidence of desaturation events during colonoscopy.22 
The use of capnometry is recommended as a standard for 
moderate or deep sedation by the American Society of 
Anesthesiologistsa and for deep sedation by the Canadian 
Anesthesiologists’ Society.23 Other professional societies 
conclude that there is inadequate evidence to mandate cap-
nometry but suggest that it may be used during PRS.b24
Continuous patient monitoring using devices that have 
high sensitivity for detection of critical events is valuable. 
However, excessive false alarms have been shown to dis-
tract providers.25–30 Several factors may result in erroneous 
capnometry alarms, including poor patient tolerance of a 
nasal cannula for oxygen delivery and capnometry,31 mouth 
breathing,32,33 and obstruction by secretions.34–36 Advanced 
monitoring not widely available in procedural areas where 
moderate PRS is administered could allow detection of 
events before complications develop.37 An acoustic monitor 
of respiratory rate has been found to have acceptable agree-
ment with Etco2 in nonintubated patients.31,38–40 Processed 
electroencephalography has been used to assess drug-
induced cerebral suppression41 and could have a role in 
monitoring depth of sedation.42
This 2-part pilot study used advanced monitoring dur-
ing planned moderate PRS to (1) determine the incidences 
of alarm events (total number of desaturation, hypoventi-
lation, and deeper than intended sedation events); and (2) 
determine whether advanced monitor use is associated 
with fewer alarm events.
METHODS
This study was approved by the IRB of Loma Linda 
University, OSR# 5110234. Patients scheduled for elective 
gastrointestinal endoscopy (GI) or interventional radiol-
ogy (IR) procedures with planned moderate PRS were 
approached regarding study participation. Those who 
agreed provided written informed consent to participate.
Sedation Protocol
The planned moderate sedation protocol in place defines mod-
erate sedation as a drug-induced state in which the patient 
will respond to voice alone or with light touch.43 Presedation 
assessment is done to screen for medical conditions for which 
anesthesiology consultation is suggested, including previous 
sedation-related complications, continuous positive airway 
pressure-dependent sleep apnea, and conditions likely to have 
airway abnormalities, such as advanced rheumatoid arthritis, 
severe cervical spine motion limitation, small mouth open-
ing, or neuromuscular disorders that may increase respiratory 
depression following administration of sedative medications. 
Other conditions that preclude moderate PRS are a need for 
intubation and ventilatory support, hemodynamic instabil-
ity, or depressed mental status inconsistent with determining 
whether a moderate depth of sedation is present. Patients who 
have such factors are scheduled for sedation administered by 
critical care sedation and transport team nurses or referred 
for anesthesiology care. Patients who meet institutional cri-
teria are scheduled for planned moderate PRS administered 
by sedation teams. These teams include a dedicated sedation 
nurse under the direction of the physician performing the 
procedure per their usual care protocols. The sedation nurses 
involved in this study had a minimum of 10 years prior experi-
ence administering and monitoring moderate PRS.
Patients had IV access established before transfer to the 
procedure room. No oral premedication was administered. 
After transfer to the procedure room, standard and advanced 
monitors were placed, and an immediate reassessment 
of the patient’s condition and vital signs was performed 
before administration of sedative medications. When seda-
tion was assessed to be adequate, the procedure was started. 
Intraprocedural sedation level was assessed by sedation 
nurses using standard scores44,45 and recorded at 5-minute 
intervals. The sedation scores were entered into the data-
base after completion of the procedure. In addition to clinical 
observation by a sedation team nurse, all patients were moni-
tored using standard monitors that include pulse oximetry 
(Spo2), electrocardiogram, and noninvasive blood pressure.
Patient and procedure characteristics, sedative medica-
tion amounts, and the number of sedative doses given were 
recorded. As most patients received fentanyl during the 
procedures, opioids were converted to fentanyl equivalents 
using published equivalencies46,47 to facilitate comparison.
Nasal cannula capnometry (Etco2; Capnostream 20; 
Covidien, Bedford, MA) was obtained using an oxygen sup-
ply cannula that samples Etco2 via a separate path from oxy-
gen delivery, as these provide better Etco2 measurement when 
greater oxygen flow rates are used.48 In addition to standard 
monitors, we applied advanced monitors to patients using the 
latest versions of sensors and software for this pilot trial. These 
were pulse oximetry with acoustic respiratory monitor (Pulse 
CO-Oximeter with Rainbow Acoustic Monitoring; Masimo 
Corp., Irvine, CA) and processed electroencephalograpy 
(SEDLine brain function monitor; Masimo Corp.). Data from 
the study monitors were captured automatically to a research

Monitoring During Procedure-Related Moderate Sedation
computer, including the sound files from the acoustic respira-
tory monitor. Patients with skin conditions that prevent the 
use of the adhesive sensors for Spo2, acoustic monitor respira-
tory rate (RRa) or Patient State Index (PSI) would have been 
excluded. Patients were excluded from the analysis if auto-
mated data capture malfunction occurred. Advanced moni-
tors were removed after procedure completion before transfer 
to the recovery area. Patients were discharged upon satisfac-
tory recovery from sedation or if transfer to another care area 
in the facility was needed. The time interval from procedure 
end to discharge from recovery was recorded.
The pilot trial was divided into 2 parts based on whether 
the procedural sedation team had access to informa-
tion from the advanced monitors. In part 1 of the study 
(standard), the procedural sedation teams were blinded 
to advanced monitor parameters. In part 2 of the study 
(advanced), procedural sedation teams were able to see the 
advanced monitor parameters. During the interval between 
parts 1 and 2, the procedural sedation teams were taught 
how to interpret alarms from the advanced monitors, how 
to implement respiratory acoustic monitoring as part of 
their care protocol, and how to interpret alarms from the 
advanced monitors. No clinical interventions or medica-
tion administrations were specified in the study protocol. 
Alarm conditions defined for study purposes were (1) Spo2 
≤92% (desaturation event); (2) RRa ≤8 breaths per minute 
(BPM; respiratory depression); and (3) PSI ≤50 (deeper than 
intended sedation, usually indicating general anesthesia).
To investigate the reliability of very low respiratory rates 
reported by either RRa or Etco2, an analysis of events iden-
tified by review of the collected data when respiratory rate 
was ≤4 BPM in the standard group was done. Capnography 
waveform and respiratory acoustic monitoring sound files 
for each event when either monitor reported respiratory 
rate ≤4 BPM were reviewed by a research clinician. The 
presence of breath sounds in the respiratory acoustic moni-
toring sound file was considered to indicate respiration. 
An interval between breaths ≥15 seconds was considered 
as validation of the respiratory rate ≤4 BPM event reported 
by either monitor. The number of events reported by each 
device and verified by retrospective analysis as true positive 
or false positive was determined.
Statistical Analysis
As a pilot trial, the enrollment number was chosen to allow 
determination of effect size from which the sample size for 
future prospective studies could be calculated. The primary 
outcome measure was the intergroup difference in total 
alarm events during PRS (Spo2 ≤92% events + RRa ≤8 BPM 
events + PSI ≤50 events). Secondary outcome measures 
included intergroup comparisons of patient and procedure 
characteristics, comparison of patients who experienced the 
3 types of alarm events, medications given during PRS, and 
time to postprocedure discharge. Continuous data were 
analyzed for normal distribution by Shapiro-Wilk, with 
P < 0.05 indicating data were not normally distributed. 
Data that were normally distributed were expressed as 
mean; 95% confidence interval (CI) and analyzed by t test. 
Data that were not normally distributed were expressed as 
median; smoothed empirical likelihood quantile 95% CI and 
analyzed by Wilcoxon rank sum test and Wilcoxon-Mann-
Whitney (WMW) odds (reported as odds; 95% CI).49,50 
Categorical data were compared using χ2 or Fisher exact 
test. Differences in proportions were analyzed by using the 
Wald 2-sample test for proportions (reported as %; 95% CI). 
Repeated-measures logistic regression was performed with 
the Genmod procedure to evaluate nurse assigned sedation 
scores. The positive predictive values for detecting respira-
tory rate ≤4 BPM events by Etco2 and RRa were calculated. 
Statistical analyses were performed using JMP 10.0.0 or 
SAS/STAT 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) with P < 0.05 con-
sidered significant.
RESULTS
We enrolled 50 patients in the standard group between 
February and May 2012, with an additional 50 patients 
enrolled in the advanced group between October and 
December 2013. Two advanced patients withdrew consent 
before procedure start. Data collection computer failure pre-
vented data collection in 6 standard and 2 advanced patients. 
Data from 44 standard and 46 advanced patients were avail-
able for analysis. Other than sex distribution, patient and 
procedure characteristics were similar (Table 1). The seda-
tion teams involved included 27 sedation nurses and 28 pro-
cedural physicians, none of whom provided care to >10%

of patients in both groups. Four of the 27 sedation nurses 
cared for >4 standard or advanced patients, but these were 
not the same sedation nurses. The largest number of stan-
dard patients cared for by 1 sedation nurse was 6 (13.64% 
of standard) and of advanced was 8 (17.39% of advanced). 
Seven of the 28 procedural physicians cared for >4 standard 
patients, whereas 2 of the 28 procedural physicians cared 
for >4 advanced patients. The largest number of standard 
patients cared for by 1 procedural physician was 9 (20.45% 
of standard) and of advanced was 6 (13.04% of advanced). 
The number of patients with any alarm event was not sig-
nificantly different between sedation nurses providing care 
to more than compared with up to 4 standard (difference, 
4.55%; −16.43% to 21.82%; P = 0.782) or advanced patients 
(difference, −16.15%; –36.95% to 4.08%; P = 0.117). The num-
ber of patients with any alarm event was not significantly dif-
ferent between procedural physicians providing care to more 
than, compared with up to 4, standard (difference, 12.33%; 
−27.22 to 8.57%; P = 0.307) or advanced patients (difference, 
−5.52%; −16.95% to 33.59%; P = 0.519). The sedations were 
the only case of the day for a sedation nurse and procedural 
physician team working together on the day of a procedure 
in 81 (91.0%) and the second case of the day for a sedation 
nurse and procedural physician team working together on 
the day of a procedure in 8 (9.0%) studied patients.
We found fewer alarm events in advanced patients 
(median, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3–4.2) compared with standard 
patients (median, 5.5; 95% CI, 2.8–9.0; Fig. 1). The WMW 
test indicated a significant difference in the median number 
of alarmed events between the groups (z = 2.073, P = 0.038) 
and statistically significantly more alarm events in standard 
compared with advanced patients (WMW odds, 1.67; 95% 
CI, 1.04–2.88). At least 1 alarm event occurred in 71 patients 
(78.9%), more frequently in patients undergoing GI (50 of 
54; 92.6%) compared with IR (21 of 36; 58.3%) procedures 
(difference, 34.26%; 18.57%–49.95%; P = 0.0002).
We evaluated for a possible effect of trend over time and 
found no evidence of a trend effect on the number of alarms 
by date of procedure, day of the week, or first versus sec-
ond half of either standard or advanced patients. The total 
number of alarm events was subjected to a 2-way analysis 
of variance having 2 levels of sex (male and female) and 2 
levels of monitoring groups (standard and advanced). Sex 
was significantly associated neither with the total number 
of alarm events (2-way analysis of variance; P = 0.6764) nor 
with the prevalence of ≥1 alarm event (P = 0.203). Similar 
numbers of patients in standard (37; 84.1%) and advanced 
(34; 73.9%; difference, −10.2%; −26.4 to 7.0%; P = 0.255) 
had ≥1 alarm event. More than 1 type of alarm event 
occurred in 20 standard compared with 11 advanced (dif-
ference, −21.54%; −39.55% to −1.75%; P = 0.032), and only 1 
advanced patient had ≥1 episode of each type of alarm event 
compared with 8 standard (difference, −16.01%; −28.18% to 
−2.62%; P = 0.018). As shown in Figure 2, fewer advanced 
patients had ≥1 respiratory depression event (17 vs 26; dif-
ference, −22.1%; −40.9 to −2.4%; P = 0.035) or ≥1 desatu-
ration event (15 vs 25; difference, −24.2%; −42.8 to −3.6%; 
P = 0.020). Overall 31.1% of patients had ≥1 PSI ≤50 event 
indicating deeper than intended sedation was produced, 
but we did not find a significant intergroup difference 
(14 in each group, difference, −1.38%; −20.21% to 17.49%; 
P = 0.888). The nurse-assessed sedation score indicated that 
a deeper than intended level of sedation was present in 4 
(1.0%) of 406 recorded scores from advanced patients and 
in 8 (2.0%) of 393 recorded scores from standard patients 
(difference, −1.05%; −2.87 to 0.77%; P = 0.222). We were not 
able to run a repeated-measures analysis to account for cor-
related measurements of deeper than intended sedation 
scores from repeated nurses, as very few nurses worked in 
multiple procedures on a given day, and no sedation nurse 
provided care to >10% of both standard and advanced 
patients. Repeated-measures logistic regression of sedation

greater when procedural sedation teams were not able to see

when they were able to see those values (advanced) during the pro-

(advanced). More standard than advanced patients had respiratory 
rate ≤8 breaths per minute (RRa; *P = 0.035) or pulse oximetry 
saturation ≤92% (Spo2; **P = 0.020) alarm events. Deeper than

scores within a patient using the Genmod procedure with a 
repeated statement and logit link showed no significant dif-
ference between standard or advanced in the odds of hav-
ing a deeper than intended sedation score (P = 0.504). These 
deeper than intended sedation scores were recorded from 
1 (2.2%) advanced and 6 (13.6%) standard patients (dif-
ference, −11.41; −22.84% to 0.91%; P = 0.046). More detail 
regarding statistical modeling issues and decisions made in 
these analyses is provided as Supplemental Digital Content, 
Response to Statistical Editor Review (http://links.lww.
com/AA/B357).
Medication administration is shown in Table 1. Patients in 
standard received more doses of opioid (WMW: z = 2.4128, 
P = 0.0158; WMW odds, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.14–3.13; P = 0.016) 
and were more likely to receive >3 doses of opioid (differ-
ence, 25.89%; 6.40%–43.24%; P = 0.009). We evaluated for a 
possible effect of trend over time and found no evidence of 
a trend effect on opioid or midazolam total dose or num-
ber of dose administration over time or compared with day 
of the week. On the basis of our data, we were not able to 
model the influence of specific sedation nurse or procedural 
physician.
Medication administration was compared in patients 
who had alarm events to those who did not, regardless of 
standard or advanced groups (Table 2). As shown in Table 
2, patients who had any alarm events received more opioid 
doses and greater total amounts of opioid and midazolam. 
We attempted a multivariate analysis with the dependent 
variables of total opioid amount, opioid doses, total mid-
azolam amount, and total midazolam doses and indepen-
dent variables as alarm events. However, the models failed 
to meet assumptions of normality and homogeneity of vari-
ance. On the basis of our data, we were not able to model 
the influence of specific sedation nurse or procedural physi-
cian. Of the 90 patients studied, 11 standard patients were 
transferred to another care area early after completion of the 
procedure based on findings from the planned procedure. 
Analysis excluding these 11 patients similarly showed that 
patients who had any alarm events received more opioid 
doses and greater total amounts of opioid and midazolam 
compared with those who did not have any alarm events 
(Supplemental Digital Content, Supplemental Table, http://
links.lww.com/AA/B357). As we were not able to perform 
a multivariate analysis, tests of the 4 dependent variables in 
Table 2 (opioid dose, number of opioid doses, midazolam 
dose, and number of midazolam doses) were conducted 
using Bonferroni-adjusted alpha levels of 0.0125 for each 
alarm type. Patients who experienced ≥2 types of alarm 
events received a greater total amount of opioid (P = 0.012)

(P < 0.001) and midazolam (P = 0.0073).
The time interval from procedure end to discharge from 
recovery was longer for advanced (median, 111; 95% CI, 
92–150 minutes) than for standard (median, 65; 95% CI, 
47–77 minutes). The WMW test indicated a significant dif-
ference in the median time to discharge between the groups 
(z = −4.336, P < 0.0001) with a statistically significantly lon-
ger time to discharge in advanced compared with standard 
(WMW odds, 3.33; 95% CI, 2.04–6.50). This comparison was 
confounded, since 11 (25.0%) patients in the standard group 
but no patients in the advanced group were transferred 
to other procedural or care areas early after study partici-
pation. Of note, patients were enrolled only if they were 
planned to undergo elective outpatient procedures under 
moderate sedation. The decision to transfer to another area 
for further studies or care was made based on findings of 
the originally planned procedure, so the sedation teams did 
not have advance knowledge of such transfer. Therefore, it 
is unlikely that these transfer decisions affected sedation 
administration during the procedure. Time to discharge 
increased in standard (median, 77; 95% CI, 67–93) when 
patients who were transferred to other procedural or care 
areas early after study participation were excluded from 
analysis; but the difference remained significant (WMW:

medication administration excluding patients who were 
transferred to other procedural or care areas early after 
study participation).
During a total of 2029.7 monitored minutes in standard 
patients, 225 respiratory rate ≤4 BPM events were reported 
by either or both Etco2 and RRa in 25 (56.8%) standard 
patients. The number of verified true-positive or false-
positive respiratory rate ≤4 BPM events reported by each 
method is shown in Table 3. The proportion of true-positive 
respiratory rate ≤4 BPM alarm events was greater for RRa 
compared with Etco2 (P < 0.0001).
DISCUSSION
At least 1 alarm event occurred in nearly 80% of patients 
receiving planned moderate sedation to facilitate GI or IR 
procedures. These events included respiratory depression or 
desaturation events in nearly half of the patients. Providing 
additional patient monitoring parameters to procedural seda-
tion teams during planned moderate PRS was associated with 
>50% reduction in the total number of alarm events and a 35% 
to 40% reduction in the number of patients with respiratory 
depression or desaturation events. We did not find a differ-
ence in the number of patients who experienced deeper than 
intended sedation events, which were recorded in nearly one-
third of these patients undergoing planned moderate sedation.
It is likely that the alarm events recorded were related to the 
sedative medications administered. As reported in 123 adults 
undergoing GI endoscopy with planned moderate sedation, 
7% of sedative medication administrations were followed by 
desaturation, many within 5 minutes.51 Analysis of medica-
tion administration to our patients is interesting. Although 
we found a similar total opioid dose, advanced patients 
received fewer dose administrations than standard. This may 
reflect a change in procedural sedation team assessment of 
drug effects based on parameters from the advanced moni-
tors. The observational design of this study limits our ability 
to draw conclusions from this finding. However, the fewer 
dose administrations to advanced, coupled with the findings 
of greater medication dosage and administration number to 
patients who had alarm events regardless of study group, 
suggests that the use of advanced monitors could allow more 
careful titration of sedation medications to patients undergo-
ing planned moderate PRS. Future research could be designed 
to test specific algorithms of medication administration based 
on the parameters provided by the monitors.
Nearly one-third of our patients had episodes of deeper 
than intended sedation detected by PSI, despite the planned 
moderate sedation. This is less than reported in patients 
who received bolus propofol52 or midazolam with opioid 
administration during GI procedures53 but suggests that 
procedural sedation teams may not accurately detect deeper 
than intended sedation during procedures. We did not find 
a difference between groups, which may be related to mus-
cle activity impacting PSI during PRS. Since PSI is falsely 
elevated by muscle activity,54 a patient may be at a deeper 
level of sedation than indicated by PSI. This could poten-
tially decrease the sensitivity of PSI to detect deepening 
sedation until the patient approaches general anesthesia. It 
appears that algorithms used to process electroencephalog-
raphy may not filter muscle activity effectively. Improved 
filtering or correction for muscle activity may be needed for 
use of these monitors during PRS. Although this study was 
not designed to investigate the correlation of PSI to sedation 
scores, the recorded scores based on clinical assessment indi-
cated that fewer patients had deeper than intended sedation 
compared with the number indicated by PSI.
Our findings show interesting differences between cap-
nometry and respiratory acoustic monitoring. Prior stud-
ies comparing these monitors have enrolled patients with 
controlled airways,55 breathing through a tight fitting face-
mask,39 or during stays in intensive care56 or postanesthesia 
recovery units.38,54 These settings allow for more control over 
sensor and cannula placement than during PRS and allow 
intervention by clinicians when patients mouth breathe or 
remove the capnometry sampling cannula. Mouth breath-
ing during PRS may contribute to false-positive Etco2 
alarms. Use of a dual oral/nasal oxygen supply and cap-
nometry cannula may provide a different result than what 
we found. We were not able to demonstrate a relationship 
between low PSI and respiratory depression, similar to a 
report of PSI monitoring of children during PRS.57
The study has some limitations. We did not randomize 
patients to the standard or advanced group during a single 
time window, but instead used an observational before-after 
comparison model. Random assignment could have allowed 
procedural sedation teams to alter practice during sedation 
of standard patients by using experience gained while view-
ing RRa and PSI parameters during sedation of advanced 
patients. The time interval between study parts allowed 
sedation teams to gain familiarity with acoustic respiratory 
monitoring. It is possible that experience gained during this 
interval could have contributed to the difference in alarm 
events we found. However, the sedation nurses involved in 
these procedures had a minimum of 10 years prior experience 
participating in procedural sedation teams. In light of that 
experience, the additional case experience gained in the inter-
val is unlikely by itself to have altered their sedation practices. 
We did not obtain respiratory rate from a source that could 
be considered an independent standard to compare RRa and

Monitoring During Procedure-Related Moderate Sedation
Etco2 against, instead using the sound files from RRa for the 
comparative standard. Thus, we did not attempt to calculate 
a false-negative rate. In this observational study of GI and IR 
procedures, having a research assistant continuously auscul-
tate breath sounds was not practical. In addition, this auscul-
tation could have interfered with procedure performance or 
altered assessment of the patient’s sedation level by the pro-
cedural sedation teams based on patient response to stetho-
scope placement and movement. Furthermore, we compared 
RRa to Etco2 from nasal cannula capnometry. Problems with 
nasal cannula capnometry include poor accuracy if patients 
mouth breathe33 and obstruction of the sample path by secre-
tions. Future research could compare combined nasal/oral 
cannula capnometry to RRa. Finally, as this was an observa-
tional study, we did not specify sedation medications or indi-
cations for additional sedative medication administration. 
A prospective study designed to target specific PSI or RRa 
targets could be designed to more thoroughly investigate the 
possible impact of these monitors on sedation practice.
In conclusion, the use of advanced monitoring during 
planned moderate PRS was associated with fewer alarm 
events, patients experiencing desaturation, and patients 
experiencing respiratory depression alarm events. It is pos-
sible that increased use and familiarity with RRa could alert 
practitioners before the need for clinical intervention and 
thus perhaps result in fewer episodes of hypoventilation 
and desaturation. The findings of this pilot study suggest 
that further study into the safety and outcome impacts of 
advanced monitoring during PRS is warranted. E
