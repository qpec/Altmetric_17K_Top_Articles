During a Return Visit to the Emergency Department
Amber K. Sabbatini, MD, MPH; Keith E. Kocher, MD, MPH; Anirban Basu, PhD, MS; Renee Y. Hsia, MD, MSc
IMPORTANCE Unscheduled short-term return visits to the emergency department (ED) are
increasingly monitored as a hospital performance measure and have been proposed as a
measure of the quality of emergency care.
OBJECTIVE To examine in-hospital clinical outcomes and resource use among patients who
are hospitalized during an unscheduled return visit to the ED.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective analysis of adult ED visits to acute care
hospitals in Florida and New York in 2013 using data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization
Project. Patients with index ED visits were identified and followed up for return visits to the
ED within 7, 14, and 30 days.
EXPOSURES Hospital admission occurring during an initial visit to the ED vs during a return
visit to the ED.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES In-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission,
length of stay, and inpatient costs.
RESULTS Among the 9 036 483 index ED visits to 424 hospitals in the study sample,
1 758 359 patients were admitted to the hospital during the index ED visit. Of these patients,
149 214 (8.5%) had a return visit to the ED within 7 days of the index ED visit, 228 370
(13.0%) within 14 days, and 349 335 (19.9%) within 30 days, and 76 151 (51.0%), 122 040
(53.4%), and 190 768 (54.6%), respectively, were readmitted to the hospital. Among the
7 278 124 patients who were discharged during the index ED visit, 598 404 (8.2%) had a
return visit to the ED within 7 days, 839 386 (11.5%) within 14 days, and 1 205 865 (16.6%)
within 30 days. Of these patients, 86 012 (14.4%) were admitted to the hospital within 7
days, 121 587 (14.5%) within 14 days, and 173 279 (14.4%) within 30 days. The 86 012 patients
discharged from the ED and admitted to the hospital during a return ED visit within 7 days
had significantly lower rates of in-hospital mortality (1.85%) compared with the 1 609 145
patients who were admitted during the index ED visit without a return ED visit (2.48%)
(odds ratio, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.69-0.78]), lower rates of ICU admission (23.3% vs 29.0%,
respectively; odds ratio, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.71-0.76]), lower mean costs ($10 169 vs $10 799;
difference, $629 [95% CI, $479-$781]), and longer lengths of stay (5.16 days vs 4.97 days; IRR,
1.04 [95% CI, 1.03-1.05]). Similar outcomes were observed for patients returning to the ED
within 14 and 30 days of the index ED visit. In contrast, patients who returned to the ED after
hospital discharge and were readmitted had higher rates of in-hospital mortality and ICU
admission, longer lengths of stay, and higher costs during the repeat hospital admission
compared with those admitted to the hospital during the index ED visit without a return ED visit.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Compared with adult patients who were hospitalized during
the index ED visit and did not have a return visit to the ED, patients who were initially
discharged during an ED visit and admitted during a return visit to the ED had lower
in-hospital mortality, ICU admission rates, and in-hospital costs and longer lengths of stay.
These findings suggest that hospital admissions associated with return visits to the ED may
not adequately capture deficits in the quality of care delivered during an ED visit.

E
nsuring safe transitions of care is an important goal
for policy makers and other stakeholders wishing to
promote a better patient experience, to improve qual-
ity outcomes, and to reduce costs. All-cause hospital read-
missions are considered to capture deficits in transitions of
care from the hospital setting and are now a reportable mea-
sure of hospital quality tied to financial penalties for poor-
performing hospitals.1 Similar to the rationale for monitor-
ing performance using hospital readmissions, unscheduled
return visits after emergency department (ED) discharge
may also reflect inadequate ED discharge practices or
follow-up procedures.
Short-term unscheduled return visits to the ED are
increasingly monitored as an administrative performance
measure and have been considered for wider adoption as a
measure of the quality of emergency care, particularly if the
patient requires hospitalization during the return ED visit.2-6
However, the ramifications of using return visits to the ED as
a measure of quality are uncertain and may be associated
with unintended consequences. Emergency departments
provide care for a heterogeneous patient population and the
majority of patients are discharged home after evaluation
and treatment.
Emergency physicians must balance the expected
benefits of hospitalization against clinical uncertainty, the
risks associated with the inpatient environment,7,8 and the
cost associated with a hospital stay9 in their decision to hos-
pitalize patients. Ideally, an effective measure of quality of
ED dispositions would reflect a fair accounting of clinician
decision making and discriminate between high and low per-
formance as demonstrated in patient outcomes. To date,
little is known about the subsequent clinical outcomes of
patients who have had a return visit to the ED and subse-
quent hospital admission.
The goal of this study was to examine in-hospital clinical
outcomes and resource use among patients who had a return
visit to the ED and subsequent hospital admission compared
with patients who were hospitalized and did not experience a
return visit to the ED. If hospital admissions during return vis-
its to the ED reflect poor quality of emergency care or unsafe
discharge practices, we hypothesized that patients with a re-
turn visit to the ED would be more likely to return with severe
symptoms or at a later stage of their acute illness, and there-
fore experience relatively poorer clinical outcomes and in-
creased resource use during their hospitalization as a result of
delayed care.
Methods
Data
A retrospective study of adult patients with ED visits to hos-
pitals in Florida and New York in 2013 was performed using
data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project of the
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. These 2 states
were chosen for analysis because they are populous, have
robust ED-level data, and include patient identifiers to track
return visits to the ED. Hospital discharge records from the
State Inpatient Database were linked with ED discharge rec-
ords from the State Emergency Department Database. The
data sets used in this study were determined by the Human
Subjects Division at the University of Washington to not
require review by an institutional review board.
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project state databases
include records from all acute care hospitals in participating
states, including public (state, federal, Veteran’
s Affairs hos-
pitals) and private community hospitals. Each State Inpa-
tient Database includes encounter-level data for all hospital-
izations regardless of admission source, whereas the State
Emergency Department Database contains similar informa-
tion on treat-and-release ED visits. These databases track
visits to all hospitals and EDs within each state.
To identify hospitalizations that originated in the ED,
the data set was first limited to inpatient records in the State
Inpatient Database with evidence of ED-level services
(either ED revenue code, Current Procedural Terminology
code, charge, or source of admission listed as the ED). Rec-
ords for elective or scheduled admissions and admissions
for deliveries were excluded. Hospitals without ED admis-
sions were assumed to not operate an ED, and were
excluded from the data set. Once ED admissions were iden-
tified, they were combined with ED discharge records in the
State Emergency Department Database, creating a complete
data set of all ED visits within the year.
Identification of Return Visit Cohorts
Unique patient identifiers and time variables were used to
track return visits across the State Inpatient Database and
State Emergency Department Database. Records for patients
younger than 18 years, those missing either return visit vari-
able, and those resulting in transfer out of the ED to another
short-term hospital (transfers result in duplicate records in
the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project data sets) were
excluded.
To characterize ED admissions into 3 return visit
cohorts, distinct episodes of emergency care were identi-
fied, which included an index visit plus any corresponding
short-term return visits (Figure). An index visit was defined
as the first ED visit (regardless of disposition) for a unique
patient or any successive visits in which the patient had no
prior visit or hospitalization during the preceding 30 days.
Therefore, 1 patient could have had multiple index visits
available for analysis. In further defining episodes, ED index
visits were excluded in which the patient died or left against
medical advice, transferred from or to another short-term
hospital, and those that occurred during the months of
January and December (New York only; Florida does not
specify visit month) because it was not possible to assess
prior visits and return visits.
The remaining index visits were followed up for all-
cause return visits to the ED within 7, 14, and 30 days. A
recent analysis evaluating the time-to-revisit curve demon-
strated that return visits within 9 days of an index ED visit
are most likely to represent an acute episode related to
the original ED visit, whereas return visits to the ED occur-
ring 9 days after the initial visit increasingly represent

ED visits unrelated to the original visit.10 As a result, the 7-
and 14-day visit intervals are likely to capture the majority
of patients experiencing a return admission or readmission
related to their original ED visit. Return visits to the ED
within 30 days of the index ED visit also were examined for
comparison because this is the standard timeframe for
assessing hospital performance regarding readmissions and
ED visits after hospital discharge.11,12
Patients who were hospitalized during their return visit
to the ED were further stratified into the following 2 groups
depending on disposition during their most proximate
index ED visit: (1) ED return admissions (ie, patients who
were discharged from the ED at the index visit and were
hospitalized during the return visit to the ED) and (2) read-
missions (ie, patients who were discharged from the hospi-
tal, made another visit to the ED, and were rehospitalized).
For consistency of comparison, the analysis was limited to
the first return visit to the ED after an index ED visit; how-
ever, a minority of patients had multiple return visits within
an episode.
For readmitted patients, only outcomes during the read-
mission and not during the original index admission were
assessed (therefore, the return visit cohorts were mutually
exclusive). Discharge diagnoses during the index ED visits
and return visits to the ED were ranked and compared using
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision
codes. To assess the proportion of patients with a return
visit to the ED for the same condition, the Clinical Classifi-
cation Software codes13 were compared for the primary
diagnosis during each index and subsequent return visit.
Inpatient clinical outcomes and resource use for the return
visit cohorts were compared with outcomes for patients
who were admitted to the hospital during the index ED visit
but who did not have a return visit to the ED.
Outcomes
Outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality, intensive care
unit (ICU) admission, length of stay, and total inpatient costs.
Patients who died in the ED during the return visit and prior
to hospital admission were counted as having died in the hos-

pital. Admission to the ICU was chosen to include patients with
asevereclinicalcourseandwasidentifiedbycriticalcareUB-92
revenue codes (0200-0209, 0210-0219).
As done in previous studies,14-16 costs for each hospital-
ization were estimated by applying Healthcare Cost and Uti-
lization Project cost-to-charge ratios to the total hospital
charges provided in the State Inpatient Database. Because
hospital-wide cost-to-charge ratios are imperfect estimates
of costs, the actual dollar amounts may not represent the
true costs. However, because this standard was applied to
all 3 return visit cohorts equally, the comparative costs are
informative.
Statistical Analysis
To evaluate adjusted differences in outcomes and resource
use between the return visit cohorts, a series of multivariable
generalized linear models were developed controlling for
age, sex, race, Elixhauser comorbidities,17 and primary payer.
The logit-link function was used for the dichotomous out-
comes of mortality and ICU admission. Both length of stay
and total cost were highly skewed to the right and overdis-
persed. Therefore, a log-link model with a negative binomial
distribution was applied for length of stay and a log-link
model with γ distribution was applied for inpatient costs.
Patients who died during their admission were excluded
from the modeling for length of stay and cost. To account
for within-hospital correlation of patient outcomes, clus-
tered standard errors were used. To avoid bias from very
low–volume hospitals, the analysis was limited to hospitals
with at least 100 total admissions in 2013.
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 13
(StataCorp); P values of ≤.05 were considered significant.
Two-tailed tests were used for the χ2 and nonlinear regres-
sion models by convention.
Results
Cohort Characteristics
There were a total of 9 036 483 visits among approximately
7 million unique patients to 424 hospitals meeting criteria
for an index ED visit (Figure), with 55.8% of patients in the
study sample having only 1 ED visit within the calendar
year. Overall, 19.5% of patients were hospitalized during
their index ED visit. Among the 1 758 359 patients initially
admitted to the hospital during their index ED visit, 149 214
(8.5%) had a return visit to the ED within 7 days, 228 370
(13.0%) within 14 days, and 349 335 (19.9%) within 30 days.
Of these patients, 76 151 (51.0%) were readmitted to the hos-
pital within 7 days, 122 040 (53.4%) within 14 days, and
190 768 (54.6%) within 30 days.
Among the 7 278 124 patients initially discharged from
the ED during their index visit, 598 404 (8.2%) experienced
a return visit to the ED within 7 days, 839 386 (11.5%) within
14 days, and 1 205 865 (16.6%) within 30 days. Of these
patients, 86 012 (14.4%) were admitted to the hospital
within 7 days, 121 587 (14.5%) within 14 days, and 173 279
(14.4%) within 30 days.
Comparison of Return Visit Cohorts
The characteristics of the study cohorts for the return visit
interval of within 7 days appear in Table 1. Characteristics of
ED visits by state appear in eTable 1 in the Supplement.
Characteristics among the study cohorts were similar
within the 14- and 30-day intervals (eTables 2 and 3 in the
Supplement).
Patients with high use of the ED (≥5 visits/year) were
more likely to experience a return visit to the ED and com-
prised 24.7% of the total sample, but accounted for
31.3% of the hospital admissions that occurred during
return visits to the ED and 34.8% of readmissions. Among
patients with a return visit to the ED, 24.2% returned to
the ED for the same condition as their index ED visit in the
cohort of patients who were admitted during a return
ED visit and 25.9% in the cohort of patients who were read-
mitted. Compared with admissions among patients who did
not have a return visit to the ED, patients with a hospital
admission during a return ED visit were more likely to be
younger, have fewer comorbidities, and have Medicaid cov-
erage or be uninsured. In contrast, patients with a readmis-
sion were more likely to be older (≥65 years) and have Medi-
care coverage.
Admission diagnoses were also different between the
groups (Table 2). Patients with an admission during a return
visit to the ED had several diagnoses (eg, urolithiasis, chole-
cystitis, gastroenteritis, and cellulitis) not included in the 10
most common diagnoses in the other comparison groups.
Outcomes Associated With Return Visit to ED
Multivariable regressions were used to generate the
adjusted outcomes in Table 3 and Table 4. In the multivari-
able models adjusting for patient case-mix, patients initially
discharged from the ED at their index visit who were admit-
ted to the hospital during a return ED visit within 7 days
were found to have a significantly lower risk of mortality
(1.85%) compared with hospital admissions in which the
patient did not experience a return ED visit (2.48%) (odds
ratio [OR], 0.73 [95% CI, 0.69-0.78]) and a lower rate of ICU
admission (23.3% vs 29.0%, respectively; OR, 0.73 [95% CI,
0.71-0.76]).
In contrast, patients who were discharged from the hos-
pital and then readmitted during their return ED visit had a sig-
nificantly higher risk of mortality (3.43%) compared with ad-
missions in which the patient did not experience a return ED
visit (2.48%) (OR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.37-1.50]) and a higher rate of
ICU admission (30.4% vs 29.0%, respectively; OR, 1.08 [95%
CI, 1.04-1.11]).
Among only those patients who had a return visit to the
ED, the mortality for patients with a readmission during the
return ED visit was 3.43% compared with 1.85% for patients
with a hospital admission during a return visit to the ED
(difference, 1.58% [95% CI, 1.41%-1.74%]). The greatest dif-
ference in mortality between patients with a return ED visit
and readmission was observed for return visits within 7
days and was less for return visits within 14 days (differ-
ence, 1.50% [95% CI, 1.36%-1.65%]) and within 30 days (dif-
ference, 1.32% [95% CI, 1.20%-1.44%]).

which patients did not experience an ED return visit (4.97
days) (IRR, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.03 to 1.05]) but lower mean total
inpatient costs ($10 169 vs $10 799, respectively; difference,
−$629 [95% CI, −$781 to −$479).
However, patients who had been hospitalized and were
readmitted during their return ED visit had longer lengths of
stay (5.70 days) compared with admitted patients who did
not experience a return visit to the ED (4.97 days) (IRR, 1.15
[95% CI, 1.14-1.16]) but greater mean inpatient costs ($11 051
vs $10 799, respectively; difference, $252 [95% CI, $63-
$442]). Clinical outcomes and inpatient resource use was
similar for patients returning within the 14- and 30-day
intervals.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess in-hospital
outcomes among ED patients experiencing a short-term
return visit to the ED that resulted in a hospital admission.
Contrary to our initial hypothesis, patients who experienced
an ED return visit that was associated with admission
shortly after ED discharge had significantly lower rates of
in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, and costs, but higher
lengths of stay compared with admissions among patients
without a return visit to the ED. In contrast, readmissions
among patients with return visits to the ED were associated
with higher mortality and ICU admission rates during the
repeat hospitalization. Results were consistent for patients
returning to the ED within 7, 14, or 30 days of their initial ED
visit. These findings suggest that ED return admissions may
not adequately capture deficits in the quality of care deliv-
ered during an ED visit based on information from adminis-
trative data sets.
Numerous studies have examined factors associated
with hospital admissions during return visits to the ED.18-24
Our study adds to the literature by investigating outcomes
for these patients after hospitalization. Return visits after
ED discharge are frequently considered an adverse event,
especially if the patient is admitted to the hospital during
the return visit to the ED.23,24 Our findings complement a
prior study by Pham et al25 that found that patients who
revisited the ED had fewer comorbidities, lower triage acu-
ity, fewer procedures and tests performed during their
return visit to the ED, and similar hospital admission rates
as patients who did not experience a return visit. Their
study did not specifically examine outcomes among
patients admitted to the hospital during the return visit to
the ED.
Some ED return visits are likely due to medical errors,
such as missed diagnoses, inappropriate treatment, or fail-
ure to secure a close follow-up plan for vulnerable patients.
The data from the present study suggest that the majority of
hospital admissions that occur on a return visit to the ED
represent a reasonable and expected rate of failure of outpa-

tient management. Prior studies that have specifically
attempted to assess the quality of care leading to a return
visit to the ED found that a minority (5%-13%) of return vis-
its are due to potential deficiencies in the quality of care
provided during the initial visit.23,26,27
Patients who experience a return visit to the ED as
a result of potential medical error have previously been
shown to have higher rates of hospital admission than the
general ED population,23 and presumably are the subset at
greatest risk for poor clinical outcomes. However, as is often
the case with retrospective chart review, these studies are
likely subject to some hindsight bias and an incomplete pic-
ture of the clinical decision-making process, which may
explain why the findings from our study did not demon-
strate inferior outcomes among those patients who experi-
enced an ED return admission. Other studies have shown
higher rates of error associated with a return visit to the ED,
but included progression of disease that should have been
foreseen by the treating clinician as an error,28 which fails to
account for the clinical uncertainty present in a significant
number of ED encounters.
How rates of return visits to the ED are interpreted—as
reflecting medical error or as a failure of an appropriate
trial of outpatient management—has important policy impli-
cations for a value-driven health care system. Recent
changes in health care financing, such as payer scrutiny
over short-stay hospitalizations, physician profiling
with pay-for-performance incentives or penalties, and
expansion of risk-sharing agreements have placed increased
pressure on hospitals and physicians to reduce unnecessary
admissions.
Furthermore, several recent studies have shown marked
variation in ED admission rates adjusted for case-mix,29-31
suggesting the potential to significantly reduce health care
costs by optimizing disposition decision making in the ED.32
Even though there is value in tracking ED return visits as an
internal quality assurance process, emphasizing hospital
performance on ED return visits as a blunt measure of qual-
ity, especially if those revisit rates are linked to economic
incentives, may have unintended consequences. For
example, it may encourage unnecessary hospitalizations as
emergency physicians attempt to guard against clinical
uncertainty and maintain favorable revisit metrics. The
emphasis on ED return visits would be well placed if a hos-
pital admission during a return visit to the ED was associ-
ated with a poor clinical course; however, the data do not
appear to support this broad assumption. Choosing appro-
priate measures that accurately identify the quality of ED
care will be increasingly important so physicians and hospi-
tals are incentivized in a way that benefits patients while
avoiding unintended consequences.
If clinicians act prudently and allow appropriate
patients a trial of outpatient care following their ED visit, it
is expected that some patients will necessarily progress in
their illness, requiring a return visit to the ED and hospital
admission. For example, conditions for which patients who
were initially discharged from the ED and experienced a
return visit to the ED with hospital admission in our study
included diagnoses, such as cellulitis, urolithiasis, and gas-
troenteritis, which are commonly first treated on an outpa-
tient basis.
A clinician’
s decision to discharge a patient from the ED
also depends on patient preferences and his or her ability to
safely manage the condition as an outpatient, both of which
may have an effect on revisit rates. For example, provision
of anticipatory guidance for when a patient should return to
the ED is an important component of ED discharge that is
not typically assessed in studies examining return ED visits.
In addition, there is limited research on patients’acceptance
of risk and their preferences for treatment venue. Many
patients may prefer to have their illness treated at home
even if that means risking a return visit to the ED if their
symptoms worsen. Hess et al33 reported that among 101
patients with chest pain who would have otherwise been
admitted to an observation unit, up to 42% would choose
outpatient management after a simple explanation of their
treatment options and risks with a decision aid. Striking a
balance between safe discharge practices and appropriate
stewardship of hospital-based resources in a way that
respects patients’preferences for care is likely associated
with some optimal rate of ED return visits, which is cur-
rently unknown.

This study should be interpreted with the following limi-
tations. First, the retrospective analysis of a secondary data
set limited the outcomes that could be studied. Even though
this study is a good first step toward examining downstream
clinical outcomes among patients who experience a hospital-
ization during a return visit to the ED, there may be other
more nuanced outcomes, such as adverse events, the use of
specific procedures, and other indicators of morbidity among
patients who have a return visit to the ED and hospital admis-
sions not captured here.
Second,wecouldnotassessmortalityamongpatientswho
diedoutsidethehospitalbecauseourdatasetonlytrackedhos-
pital-based outcomes. However, prior studies have found that
death outside the hospital shortly after ED discharge is rare,
occurring in less than 0.05% of discharges.34,35
Third, in assessing outcomes, we did not seek to explain
all factors that accounted for differences among cohorts, but
report case-mix-adjusted outcomes between patients with
and without a return visit to the ED. As is the case with all
cross-sectional secondary data analyses, there may be addi-
tional unmeasured severity that accounts for differences in
outcomes observed between groups. We recognize that hos-
pital factors, such as ED crowding,36 may also account for
differences and would need to be explored in future studies.
Fourth, we realize that our methods may have failed to
capture some return visits to the ED. We only examined the
first return visit to the ED after each index ED visit,
although a minority of patients have complicated episodes
with multiple return ED visits before hospital admission.
In addition, we also excluded inpatient records for pa-
tients transferred in or transferred out, recognizing that
some may be return visits. Our analysis does not include
direct admissions that may have been return visits. Each of
these factors may lead to an underestimate of return visits
to the ED.
Conclusions
Compared with adult patients who were hospitalized during
the index ED visit and did not have a return visit to the ED,
patients who were initially discharged during an ED visit
and admitted during a return visit to the ED had lower
in-hospital mortality, ICU admission rates, and in-hospital
costs and longer lengths of stay. These findings suggest that
hospital admissions associated with return visits to the ED
may not adequately capture deficits in the quality of care
delivered during an ED visit.
