Abstract
Background: Hospitals’ use of observation status for patients with cancer presenting to the emergency department (ED) is not well un-
derstood. This model of care delivery may be a viable alternative to inpatient admission for patients with cancer presenting with certain 
conditions. Our objective was to assess the use of observation status among Medicare beneficiaries with and without cancer. Methods: 
Population-based SEER-Medicare data were used to assess differences in the use of observation status between Medicare beneficiaries 
aged ≥66 years with and without cancer using a matched analysis (n=151,183 per cohort). We assessed the ratio of observation unit use 
to inpatient admission, between cancer and noncancer cohorts, and for patients diagnosed with breast, colon, lung, and prostate cancers. 
Poisson regression models were used to calculate observation rate estimates and 95% CIs while adjusting for selected patient characteris-
tics. Results: When considering the volume of hospitalizations, observation status is used less frequently among beneficiaries with cancer 
than those without (43 vs 69 observation status visits per 1,000 inpatient admissions, respectively). The estimated observation rate per 1,000 
inpatient admissions was higher for beneficiaries aged <75 years versus those aged ≥75 years, those with a Charlson comorbidity index of 
0 vs 1 or ≥2, and those without a prior hospitalization versus those with ≥1 prior hospitalizations. Patients with breast and prostate cancers 
had higher adjusted and unadjusted observation rates per 1,000 inpatient admissions compared with those with colon and lung cancers. 
Conclusions: Observation status is used proportionately less for beneficiaries with cancer than those without. There may be opportuni-
ties to develop standards for ED staff to manage certain conditions for patients with cancer in observation status, and to reserve hospital 
resources for those who need it most.

penalties for inappropriate hospital admissions, obser-
vation status has become the focus of recent atten-
tion.5–7 Despite an increased focus on examining the 
use of observation status among the general popula-
tion, its use among patients with cancer is not well 
understood. At the population level, observation 
status among older adults in general is extensive and 
increasing.5,8 This trend may reflect hospitals’ rec-
ognition that some emergency care can be rendered 
without an inpatient admission. It may also reflect 
hospitals’ response to changing reimbursement para-
digms, because observation status might help reduce 
readmissions. The Hospital Readmissions Reduction 
Program, a provision in the Affordable Care Act, pe-
nalizes hospitals with higher-than-expected 30-day 
readmission rates for acute myocardial infarction, 
heart failure, pneumonia, total hip or knee replace-
ment, and COPD.9 Of note, in a recent study, the 
authors found no difference in readmission rate with 
increased observation status use. This finding supports 
the notion that hospitals were not using observation 
status to avoid readmission penalties.10
Despite increasing attention on observation sta-
tus, the extent to which it is used to successfully treat 
older adults with cancer is unknown. Patients with 
cancer aged ≥65 years are hospitalized at a rate of 
156.1 per 10,000 patients every year, which is greater 
than the rate for older adults who do not have can-
cer.11 Inpatient hospitalization is even higher for pa-
tients with terminal disease.12 Patients with cancer 
are frequently admitted to hospitals with an acute 
complication of their disease or its treatment, or for 
refractory symptoms. The specific clinical syndromes 
for which patients with cancer are seen in the ED is 
an active topic of investigation. Common complaints 
include pain, respiratory distress, and gastrointesti-
nal issues.13 There may be opportunities to develop 
standards for ED staff to manage certain conditions 
for patients with cancer in observation status, and to 
reserve hospital resources for those who need it most.
In another study by our group, implementation 
of an observation unit at a Comprehensive Cancer 
Center was associated with a reduction in the over-
all rate of inpatient admission from the ED and true 
inpatient bed utilization.14 Other designated cancer 
centers are considering or have already implemented 
an observation pathway in their EDs. As we learn 
more from observation status at dedicated cancer 
centers, these lessons can be translated to commu-
nity hospitals and vice versa. To better understand 
the opportunities that observation status may afford, 
we were interested in assessing the extent of observa-
tion status use among patients with cancer at a popu-
lation level. We hypothesized that observation sta-
tus without a follow-up inpatient admission occurs 
less often in patients with cancer than in the general 
population due to the complexity of care needs for 
this population. There may be opportunities to study 
its impact, potentially avoid unnecessary inpatient 
admissions, and maximize patient benefit. 
Methods
Data Source
We used population-based SEER cancer registry data 
linked with Medicare claims to assess differences in 
the use of observation status between Medicare fee-
for-service beneficiaries with and without cancer, us-
ing a matched retrospective comparative analysis. 
SEER, a consortium of population-based cancer 
registries sponsored by the NCI, currently includes 
18 registries covering approximately 28% of the US 
population. For all incident cancers in their coverage 
areas, SEER registries collect information regarding 
site and extent of disease, the first course of cancer-
directed therapy, and sociodemographic characteris-
tics, with active follow-up for date and cause of death. 
Medicare claims have been linked to SEER records 
for adults aged ≥65 years diagnosed with cancer and 
who reside in a SEER area. These claims include in-
formation on patient demographic characteristics as 
well as services, treatments, and procedures used by 
beneficiaries. Compared with the elderly US popula-
tion, the SEER-Medicare population has a similar age 
and sex distribution, is somewhat more likely to live 
in urban and affluent areas, and has a smaller propor-
tion of nonwhite individuals. The random 5% sample 
of Medicare beneficiaries who reside in SEER regions 
was used to identify patients without cancer for the 
matched comparative analysis.15
Study Sample
Study cases included all fee-for-service Medicare 
beneficiaries aged ≥66 years diagnosed with lung, 
breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer between 2006 
and 2008, with follow-up through 2010. Beneficia-
ries <66 years of age were excluded due to lack of 
complete claims for the year before diagnosis. The

month of diagnosis served as the study index date. 
Each Medicare beneficiary was followed for 2 years 
from diagnosis or until time of death, whichever 
came first. Patients with a prior cancer diagnosis, 
those whose cancer was diagnosed only at time of 
death, or those who were enrolled in an HMO or had 
incomplete Medicare Part A and B coverage from 
the year before diagnosis through the end of follow-
up were excluded. 
Cases were randomly matched to controls from 
the noncancer sample on a one-to-one basis without 
replacement by birth year range (5 years), geographic 
SEER region (Northeast, South, West, Midwest), sex, 
and race. Each matched control had the same study 
index date as its matched case. We excluded controls 
that were enrolled in an HMO or had incomplete 
Medicare Part A and B coverage from the year before 
the index date through the end of follow-up. Eligible 
controls had to be included in the data set for the du-
ration of a case’s follow-up period, because cases and 
matched controls were followed for the same duration.
Variables and Outcomes
Demographic and disease characteristics included 
age; race; a modified Charlson comorbidity index 
based on all inpatient, outpatient, and physician 
claims from 1 year before diagnosis16,17; and geo-
graphic region. For Medicare beneficiaries with can-
cer, we also included cancer type and disease stage.
Medicare outpatient claims were used to iden-
tify observation status for each beneficiary during 
the study period. To be classified as an “observation 
status,” the revenue code for “general classification 
category” (0760) or “observation room” (0762) had 
to be present along with the procedure code for “hos-
pital observation service per hour” (G0378) or “di-
rect admission of a patient for hospital observation 
care” (G0379).5,18 Visits were considered unique by 
date. Observation status visits that resulted in an 
inpatient admission were not identifiable and were 
therefore counted as an inpatient admission only.
Inpatient admissions were defined as any visit 
billed in MEDPAR files unique by date. Among the 
cases, we excluded admissions for cancer-directed 
surgeries because they were likely planned admis-
sions (see supplemental eAppendix 1, available with 
this article at JNCCN.org). Prior inpatient admis-
sions were also counted for each beneficiary for the 
year before the index date. 
Statistical Analyses
We examined observation status with Medicare ben-
eficiaries as the unit of analysis. We examined the 
frequency of inpatient admissions and observation 
status visits that did not result in an inpatient ad-
mission and calculated the average number of ob-
servation status visits and inpatient admissions per 
beneficiary throughout the study period. At the ad-
mission level, we used total observation status visits 
and total inpatient admissions to calculate the unad-
justed rate of observation status visits per 1,000 inpa-
tient admissions for the cancer (cases) and noncan-
cer (controls) cohorts. This rate was also calculated 
separately for the first and second year from the in-
dex date for both cohorts. Poisson regression models 
were used to calculate observation rate estimates and 
95% confidence intervals while adjusting for patient 
characteristics, including prior hospitalization and 
comorbidities. Cancer-specific observation rate esti-
mates were also adjusted for stage at diagnosis.
We received approval from the NCI for use of the 
SEER-Medicare data set for this analysis. This study 
was considered exempt research by the Memorial Sloan 
Kettering Cancer Center Institutional Review Board.
Results
A total of 161,457 cases met all eligibility criteria; 
of these, 151,193 (94%) were successfully matched 
to a noncancer control. Demographic characteristics 
were similar between cohorts. The mean age at the 
study index date was 77 years and the median age 
was 76 years for both cohorts. Both cohorts were pre-
dominantly white (85%), with 42% of beneficiaries 
residing in the Western SEER region (Table 1). The 
mean follow-up time was 18 months, with a median 
of 24 months among both groups. 
Overall Rate of Observation Status Visits
There were 222,009 inpatient admissions and 12,934 
observation status visits among the cancer cohort 
and 85,526 and 6,536, respectively, among the non-
cancer cohort. When considered in relation to inpa-
tient admissions, the noncancer cohort had a higher 
rate of observation status visits per 1,000 inpatient 
admissions compared with the cancer cohort. After 
adjusting for patient characteristics, the cancer co-
hort had an estimated 43 observation status visits 
per 1,000 inpatient admissions compared with 69 per

1,000 inpatient admissions among noncancer con-
trols (P<.001) (Table 2) 
Rates by Patient Characteristics
The adjusted and unadjusted rates of observation sta-
tus visits per 1,000 inpatient admissions differed by 
patient characteristics. Rates were higher for Medi-
care beneficiaries aged <75 years compared with ≥75 
years, those with a Charlson comorbidity index of 
0 compared with 1 or ≥2, and those without a prior 
hospitalization compared with ≥1 prior hospitaliza-
tions (Table 2). Controls had a higher observation 
status visit rate compared with cases in both years 1 
and 2 after the index date (58 vs 40 per 1,000 inpa-
tient admissions in year 1; 72 vs 52 per 1,000 inpa-
tient admissions in year 2). 
The higher rate of observation status visits per 
1,000 inpatient admissions for patients without can-
cer compared with those with cancer remained af-
ter stratifying by prior inpatient admission. In fact, 
patients without cancer with ≥1 prior hospitaliza-
tion had a higher rate of observation status visits per 
1,000 inpatient admissions than those with cancer 
and no prior hospitalizations (66 vs 47, respectively).
Rates Among Patients With Cancer
Patients diagnosed with breast and prostate cancers 
had higher overall rates of observation status per 1,000 
inpatient admissions compared with those with lung 
and colorectal cancers. In year 2 after diagnosis, the 
rate of observation status visits per 1,000 inpatient ad-
missions was higher than in year 1 for colon, lung, and 
prostate cancers, but the opposite for breast cancer. 
Patients with breast cancer had an estimated 95 ob-
servation status visits per 1,000 inpatient admissions 
during the first year of follow-up, which is higher than 
the estimated rate of 58 observation status visits per 
1,000 admissions for patients without cancer. Patients 
with cancer with lower-stage cancer at diagnosis had 
significantly higher estimated rates of observation sta-
tus visits per 1,000 admissions (P<.001).
Discussion
Observation status is a common alternative to inpa-
tient admission for patients presenting to EDs. We 
found that observation status is used less among Medi-
care beneficiaries with cancer than those without. 
We found that younger patients, those with no 
comorbidities, those with no prior hospitalizations, 
and those with lower stage at diagnosis had higher 
rates of observation status visits per 1,000 inpatient 
admissions. This suggests that observation status vis-
its are more commonly used than inpatient admis-
sions among patients who are relatively healthier at 
baseline, or that observation status visits are more 
likely to lead to inpatient admissions in sicker pa-
tients. We cannot discern between these scenarios 
from our data. Interestingly, we found high relative 
use of observation status visits among patients with 
breast cancer in year 1, suggesting important differ-

ences by cancer type. This finding could also simi-
larly reflect the overall health status of the patient 
cohort. Alternatively, patients with breast cancer are 
often seen in the ED for complications of treatment 
administered in the adjuvant setting. As such, these 
patients may have a smaller burden of cancer-related 
symptoms than the other groups in this analysis. 
There are several possible explanations for the 
lower use of observation status by Medicare ben-
eficiaries with cancer. Patients with cancer may be 
more likely to require inpatient admission following 
care in an observation setting than those without 
cancer (33% vs 20%).14 This significant departure 
from general clinical experience may discourage ED 
practitioners from using observation status for their 
patients with cancer. We were not able to determine 
the patient’s illness severity at the time of ED presen-
tation. If patients with cancer presented with more 
severe complaints, it could explain the lower use of 
observation status. Older adult patients are also more 
likely to require skilled nursing care on discharge. 
Because the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Ser-
vices policy requires 3 days of hospitalization for cov-
erage, this may discourage ED practitioners from us-
ing observation status.19 
There were some limitations in our study. In 
some cases, beneficiaries with cancer sought treat-
ment at EDs for reasons unrelated to their cancer. 
We do not know this information from this data set. 
 
However, because we are comparing cohorts with

Observation Status in Cancer
1239
and without cancer, the reasons unrelated to the 
cancer should be similar between groups. The true 
meaning of observation status varies by hospital. For 
some, it reflects a separate unit designed for monitor-
ing patients and a unique management structure. For 
others, the term may be an administrative distinc-
tion.7 This inconsistency limits our ability to evalu-
ate the impact of observation units on outcomes. We 
only included patients aged ≥66 years, and our results 
may not be generalizable to patients of all ages. The 
study is limited to 2 years of treatment and may not 
reflect use for long-term survivors. 
Moving forward, there may be opportunities to 
develop standards for ED staff to manage patients 
with cancer presenting with certain conditions and 
with different types of cancer. This can help optimize 
resource utilization in the ED. As newer management 
options for oncologic emergencies are identified, such 
as evolving risk stratification paradigms for febrile neu-
tropenia, observation status will likely play an increas-
ing role.20 The NCI has identified the management 
of oncologic emergencies as an important knowledge 
gap and facilitated the creation of the Comprehensive 
Oncologic Emergencies Research Network (CON-
CERN) consortium in March 2015 to address this 
need (https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/concern/). CON-
CERN is a research network comprising academic and 
community hospitals charged with describing the use 
of emergency care by patients with cancer and devel-
oping evidence-based management strategies that im-
prove cancer outcomes. It will be important to isolate 
the conditions that should be managed in observation 
status, outside the hospital, or in the hospital, and to 
reserve hospital resources for those who need it most. 
Minimizing healthcare costs but also matching pa-
tient needs with the appropriate level and type of care 
should be a priority, especially given policy changes 
such as through the Medicare Access and CHIP Re-
authorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) that incentiv-
ize high-quality and low-cost healthcare.21 
Conclusions 
Observation status is used less for Medicare benefi-
ciaries with cancer than for those without. Future re-
search is needed to understand the impact of using 
different models to care for patients with cancer with 
acute health issues on important patient health and 
cost outcomes, as well as key factors that contribute 
to the success of these models.
