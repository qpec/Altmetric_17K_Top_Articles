In Brief
Drugs targeting the hormone FGF21 may
have beneficial health effects. Variations
in human DNA in the FGF21 gene provide
an indication of what those effects may
be. Here, we show that variation in the
FGF21 gene is associated with higher
blood pressure and altered body shape,
despite lower total body-fat percentage.

SUMMARY
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormone
that has insulin-sensitizing properties. Some trials
of FGF21 analogs show weight loss and lipid-
lowering effects. Recent studies have shown that a
common allele in the FGF21 gene alters the balance
of macronutrients consumed, but there was little ev-
idence of an effect on metabolic traits. We studied a
common FGF21 allele (A:rs838133) in 451,099 people
from the UK Biobank study, aiming to use the human
allele to inform potential adverse and beneficial
effects of targeting FGF21. We replicated the associ-
ation between the A allele and higher percentage car-
bohydrate intake. We then showed that this allele is
more strongly associated with higher blood pressure
and waist-hip ratio, despite an association with lower
total body-fat percentage, than it is with BMI or type
2 diabetes. These human phenotypes of variation in
the FGF21 gene will inform research into FGF21’s
mechanisms and therapeutic potential.
INTRODUCTION
FGF21 is a hormone secreted primarily by the liver whose
multiple functions include signaling to the paraventricular nu-
cleus of the hypothalamus to suppress sugar and alcohol
intake (von Holstein-Rathlou et al., 2016; Talukdar et al.,
2016a), stimulating glucose uptake by adipocytes (Kharito-
nenkov et al., 2005) and acting as an insulin sensitizer (Ber-
glund et al., 2009; Bondurant et al., 2017). These features
and several other lines of evidence have prompted the devel-
opment of FGF21-based therapies as potential treatments for
obesity and type 2 diabetes, with consistent effects on triglyc-
eride lowering, some effects on weight loss, but little effect on
glucose
tolerance
(Kharitonenkov
and
DiMarchi,
2017;
Reitman, 2013). An early trial showed lipid-lowering effects
in people with type 2 diabetes and obesity, but there was
only suggestive evidence for effects on weight and glucose
tolerance (Gaich et al., 2013). A recent study suggested that
FGF21 analogs may alter blood pressure in humans (Kim
et al., 2017), although changes in blood pressure were not
observed in a previous trial (Talukdar et al., 2016b). Pre-clin-
ical evidence of FGF21’s potential role in metabolism includes
resistance to diet induced obesity in mice overexpressing
FGF21 (Kharitonenkov et al., 2005) and improved glucose
tolerance in obese mice through administration of recombi-
nant FGF21 (Kharitonenkov et al., 2005). Subsequent studies
have confirmed these findings in mice (Coskun et al., 2008;
Bondurant et al., 2017) and shown similar effects in non-hu-
man primates, including improvement of glucose tolerance
and slight weight loss in diabetic rhesus monkeys (Kharitonen-
kov et al., 2007), but other studies are less conclusive (Khar-
itonenkov and DiMarchi, 2017).

 Recent studies have shown that FGF21 affects the balance of
macronutrients consumed. Studies in mice and non-human pri-
mates show that genetically and pharmacologically raising
FGF21 levels suppresses sugar and alcohol intake (Talukdar
et al., 2016a; von Holstein-Rathlou et al., 2016). Three human ge-
netic studies have shown that a common allele at rs838133 (A/G,
minor allele frequency = 44.7%), which results in a synonymous
change to the first exon of FGF21, is associated with higher car-
bohydrate and lower protein and fat intake, with no effect on total
calorie intake (Chu et al., 2013; Soberg et al., 2017; Tanaka et al.,
2013). Soberg et al. (2017) showed that the carbohydrate prefer-
ence was specific to sugary products and may also increase
alcohol intake. These findings are consistent with data from
animal studies showing that FGF21 signals to reward centers
in the brain (Talukdar et al., 2016a; von Holstein-Rathlou et al.,
2016). The human genetic studies found no detectable effect
on the risk for type 2 diabetes and only nominal evidence for
an effect on BMI (Soberg et al., 2017).
Human genetic germline variation provides a potentially very
informative way of assessing the likely efficacy and adverse
effects of therapies. Importantly, the effect size of a genetic
association with a given trait is unrelated to the likelihood that
the relevant gene product might be an adequate drug target. A
statistically robust association suggests that pharmacological
manipulation of the target gene to stronger gain or loss of func-
tion will alter the trait to a larger extent than that conferred by the
naturally occurring allele. Examples include alleles in the PCSK9,
NPC1L1, and HMGCR genes, all associated with lower low-den-
sity lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and lower risk for atheroscle-
rotic heart disease. These alleles are also associated with very
subtly higher risk for type 2 diabetes, with odds ratios of less
than 1.06 (Ference et al., 2016; Lotta et al., 2016; Schmidt
et al., 2017; Swerdlow et al., 2015) but add genetic evidence to
that from trials showing that such LDL lowering increases the
risk for type 2 diabetes (Frayling, 2015; Swerdlow et al., 2015).
Here we aimed to extend the characterization of the pheno-
types associated with the variant in FGF21 using 451,000
individuals from the UK Biobank. We reasoned that genotype-
phenotype associations of FGF21 would generate hypotheses
for developers of FGF21-based therapies about their potential
beneficial and adverse effects. The use of human genetic infor-
mation is increasingly viewed as an important step to inform
drug development (Hurle et al., 2016). Human genotype-pheno-
type associations will also inform experimental studies of FGF21
function. We first replicated the association between the minor
allele at rs838133 and higher carbohydrate and lower protein
and fat intake. We then provide conclusive evidence that the
same allele increases alcohol intake, consistent with findings
from animal studies and meaning the allele’s effects on human
nutrient intake mimic perfectly those seen in FGF21 model
organisms. We identified several associations with metabolic
and anthropometric traits (all with statistical confidence < 6 3
10�5), most likely not detected before because of limited power:
the FGF21 rs838133 A allele is associated with stronger effects
on higher waist-hip ratio and higher blood pressure, despite an
association with lower total body-fat percentage, than its effects
on BMI, and has no detectable effect on type 2 diabetes.
RESULTS
The Minor Allele at FGF21 rs838133 Is Associated with
Higher Sugar and Alcohol Intake and Lower Protein and
Fat Intake
We first investigated the previously described associations
between the FGF21 rs838133 variant and macronutrient intake,
coffee and alcohol intake, and smoking. We used data including

among 451,099 we defined as of European ancestry. We used
a p value of 0.0005 as an equivalent of p = 0.05 given the
100 tests performed. In Table 1 we show how each copy of the

 genome-wide levels of statistical confidence. These effects
imply very strongly that the rs838133 A allele (population fre-
quency = 45%) results in lower FGF21 function because genetic
and pharmacological lowering of FGF21 in animal models,
including non-human primates, has exactly the same effect on
carbohydrate and alcohol preferences (Talukdar et al., 2016a;
von Holstein-Rathlou et al., 2016). We present all results aligned
to this putative lower function allele, but the opposite directions
can be interpreted as the putative effects of higher FGF21
function. The largest effect on macronutrient intake was with car-
bohydrate intake, where each A allele raised percentage intake
by 0.21%. There was no detectable effect on total energy intake.
Any effects on coffee consumption and smoking were minimal in
comparison. In Table S1 we show the summary characteristics
of people in the UK Biobank, including those completing the
FFQ and those not completing it.
The Minor Allele at FGF21 rs838133 Is Associated with
Lower Levels of Body Fat as a Percentage and
Paradoxically Higher Waist-Hip Ratio
Previous studies reported only nominal evidence for associa-
tions between rs838133 and anthropometric measures. Using
data from 451,099 UK Biobank participants, we showed that
the minor rs838133 allele was associated with lower total
body-fat percentage (�0.051% per allele, p = 5 3 10�5),
equivalent to 20 g in a 100 kg person with 40% fat. Lower levels
of body fat are usually associated with a lower waist-hip ratio
(WHR), but paradoxically, the FGF21 allele was associated
with higher WHR before and after adjusting for BMI (p = 2 3
10�7 after adjusting for BMI). The strongest association, reach-
ing genome-wide levels of statistical confidence, was with lower
hip circumference (p = 7 3 10�13), for which each allele was
associated with an approximately 1.0 mm difference. There
was only nominal evidence of an effect on BMI. The minor A allele
was also associated with shorter stature (also by �1 mm per
allele), but this effect on reduced growth did not account for
the smaller hip circumference (Table 2). Each of these associa-
tions with anthropometric traits was consistent with previously
published GWAS data from the GIANT consortium (Table 2).
Unlike many other variants altering WHR, the effects were very
similar in men and women (Table S2).
The Minor Allele at FGF21 rs838133 Is Associated with
Higher Blood Pressure and Altered Lipid and Liver
Enzyme Levels, but Not Type 2 Diabetes or Heart
Disease
The A allele at FGF21, associated with lower total body-fat
percentage and higher WHR was also associated with higher
blood pressure, hypertension, and blood pressure medication
use. The effect sizes were not reduced after correcting for self-
reported alcohol intake, smoking, and salt intake (Table 2). There
was no association with coronary artery disease or type 2
diabetes, and the confidence intervals for any effect of the
variant on type 2 diabetes ranged from a 0.99–1.03 odds ratio.
We also noted an association with albumin/creatine ratio (ACR)
at genome-wide levels of statistical confidence (Table 2). The
largest effect was with systolic blood pressure, for which each
A allele raised systolic blood pressure by 0.29 mm Hg; this
association
reached
genome-wide
levels
of
statistical
confidence. Where data were available from existing GWAS
(for blood pressure, coronary artery disease, and type 2 dia-
betes), a meta-analysis of existing associations and those in
UK Biobank strengthened the statistical confidence of the find-
ings (Table 2).
Finally, we examined the association between the FGF21
rs838133 allele and relevant glycemic and liver and lipid markers
that were not available in the UK Biobank but were available in
published genome-wide association study (GWAS) data (Table
3). The allele associated with higher sugar intake and lower
body-fat percentage was also associated with higher LDL
cholesterol and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels
and lower alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels in existing GWAS
data (Chambers et al., 2011; Willer et al., 2013). There was a
nominal association with triglycerides. The directions of the
associations with GGT and ALP were consistent with an effect
of higher alcohol intake and lower protein and fat intake, respec-
tively, although details of alcohol and macronutrient intake are
not available in these studies to confirm this as the cause of
the liver function test associations.
Adjusting the FGF21 Anthropometric and Metabolic
Associations for Macronutrient Intake
We next reasoned that the associations with anthropometric and
metabolic measures could be secondary to the FGF21 minor
allele’s effect on altered macronutrient intake. To test this possi-
bility, we performed additional analyses adjusting for the
measures of percentage carbohydrate, protein, and fat intake
derived from self-report FFQs available in a subset of individuals.
These analyses showed two things. First, there was no evidence
that the FGF21 allele’s effect on macronutrient intake leads to
the effects on body shape and blood pressure. The associations
with WHR adjusted for BMI, diastolic and systolic blood pres-
sure, and hypertension (and hypertension medication) were
very similar in both adjusted and unadjusted analyses. Second,
there was a trend toward the FGF21 allele’s effect on macronu-
trient intake contributing to the differences in overall BMI and
body-fat
percentage.
Although
the
differences
between
adjusted and unadjusted analyses did not reach p < 0.05, the
adjusted effect sizes were approximately three-quarters of the
unadjusted effect sizes (Table S3).
rs838133 Association with Liver FGF21 Expression
To provide additional insight into the FGF21 rs838133 associa-
tions, we next tested its association with liver gene expression
in a meta-analysis using 1,031 individuals from three hepatic
expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies. Because
rs838133 was not included on the genotyping platforms for these
studies and was in a region with low imputation quality, rs439523
(r2 = 0.62 in genetic Europeans) was used as a proxy. There was
no evidence of association with FGF21 expression (Table S4).
Phenome-wide Association Study Shows Suggestive
Associations of FGF21 Allele with Circadian Rhythm and
Physical Activity
FGF21 has multiple metabolic effects, possibly all linked to a role
as a ‘‘global starvation signal’’ (Bookout et al., 2013), and studies

et al., 2012), circadian rhythms (Bookout et al., 2013), physical

related to reward and risk behavior given the evidence that
FGF21 affects reward function in the brain. We used a false dis-
covery rate of 1% (p < 0.0095) to highlight associations (full list of
105 associations in Table S5). Notable associations, separate
from the traits already mentioned, between the allele associated
with higher sugar intake and other traits, included a more
evening chronotype, lower activity (as measured by using the In-
ternational Physical Activity Questionnaire [IPAQ]) and lower
birth weight (all self-reported). There was no association with
bone mineral density as measured by a heel ultrasound, but
the sugar intake allele was associated with a nominally higher
risk for osteoporosis (Table S5). There were no associations
with the tested female reproductive traits. We further tested
the associations with physical activity and sleep using a subset
of 96,034 individuals who had worn accelerometer devices
for 7 days and saw consistent associations, with nominal levels
of statistical confidence (Table S6).
Phenotypes Associated with Other FGF21 Alleles Based
on Publicly Available Data
Finally, we extended our analyses of human alleles likely to be
affecting FGF21 function using publicly available data (http://
www.type2diabetesgenetics.org). On the basis of whole-exome
sequence data from 13,594 individuals, three protein truncating
variants, each resulting in a frameshift, were present at amino
acid positions S76, P171, and P178. These alleles were not
associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) or BMI (WHR
was not available in the exome sequence data) but were present
in only 7 individuals, and large effects could not be ruled out (e.g.,
up to 7.52 mm Hg for SBP and 6.94 kgm2 for BMI).
DISCUSSION
Our findings are important for two main reasons. First, the
genetic association data provide hypotheses about the potential
adverse and beneficial effects of FGF21-based therapies. We
used a common, naturally occurring variant in the human
FGF21 gene, rs838133, to generate these hypotheses. Second,
the associations provide an advance in knowledge about the
wide range of effects in humans of variation in the FGF21
gene. Our motivation for studying the genotype-phenotype
associations of the rs838133 variant came from the demonstra-
tion that the phenotypic associations of naturally occurring
human genetic variation often mirror the effects of pharmacolog-
ical manipulation of, or interventions targeting, the relevant
protein or pathway linked to the gene. Examples include vitamin
D and multiple sclerosis (Mokry et al., 2015), LDL cholesterol and
coronary artery disease (Do et al., 2013), and LDL cholesterol
and type 2 diabetes (Lotta et al., 2016). Although there is no
direct evidence for the function of the rs838133 variant (or one
in strong linkage disequilibrium), the A allele is very likely to
represent lower FGF21 function, because it is very robustly
associated with higher sugar and alcohol preference in people,
a finding that is completely consistent with the genetic and
pharmacological effects of FGF21 lowering in animal models,
including non-human primates (von Holstein-Rathlou et al.,
2016; Talukdar et al., 2016a). We note that there is no association
between the FGF21 rs838133 allele and FGF21 expression in the
liver, and it may be that the effects of this variant, or one in
linkage disequilibrium, on FGF21 gene expression are too subtle
to pick up as an eQTL even in the relevant tissue.

 Our data mean that researchers studying the molecular and
therapeutic effects of FGF21 can now hypothesize and study
in greater detail a number of potential mechanisms, in both
experimental systems and clinical trials. These researchers can
use the directions of effects associated with the rs838133
A allele we presented to generate hypotheses about the likely ef-
fects of lowering FGF21. Hypotheses about the likely effects of
increasing FGF21 can be interpreted as the same effects but in
opposite directions. The first hypothesis is that FGF21-based
therapies will not have beneficial effects on type 2 diabetes.
The lack of an association between the human FGF21 allele
and type 2 diabetes strengthens the inference for the lack of
any anti-diabetic properties. Second, our data provide evidence
for the hypothesis that FGF21 manipulation will have stronger
effects on body-fat percentage and distribution than it will on
absolute weight, as measured by BMI. The strength of the asso-
ciations between the FGF21 allele and higher WHR, despite
associations with lower total body-fat percentage, were much
stronger than any association with BMI. In contrast to the lack
of association with type 2 diabetes, our data provide evidence
for the putative effects of FGF21 on several clinically important
metabolic traits, including blood pressure, ACR in the urine,
and higher LDL cholesterol. None of these associations were
previously known. The data also provide unequivocal statistical
confidence that the rs838133 allele is associated with alcohol
intake, compared with previous studies in which it was associ-
ated with alcohol intake with a p value of 0.03 (Soberg et al.,
2017). In our analyses of UK Biobank and existing GWAS data,
seven of these associations reached p < 5 3 10�5, and four
reached conventional levels of genome-wide statistical confi-
dence (p < 5 3 10�8).
The novel associations observed suggest that further func-
tional and mechanistic studies are needed to investigate
FGF21’s role in adipocyte differentiation and storage capacity.
An important observation for such studies is that our results sug-
gest that FGF21’s effects on body shape and blood pressure are
unlikely to be secondary to the effect on macronutrient intake.
These results suggest that FGF21 has pleiotropic effects, with
separate effects on macronutrient intake to those on body shape
and blood pressure. In contrast, there was a suggestion that the
associations with lower total body-fat percentage were slightly
attenuated when adjusting for macronutrient intake. These
results are consistent with the minor FGF21 allele’s association
with higher carbohydrate and lower protein and fat intake leading
to slightly lower body-fat percentage.
The associations between body composition and blood pres-
sure have similarities to those of the Pro12Ala allele in PPARG, in
which the allele associated with lower total body-fat percentage
is also associated with adverse metabolic effects, although there
are clear effects of the PPARG allele with type 2 diabetes and
insulin sensitivity in addition to body composition (Altshuler
et al., 2000; Scott et al., 2012). Some studies have linked
FGF21’s function in adipocytes to those of PPARG (Wei et al.,
2012), a transcription factor critical for adipogenesis and muta-
tions that cause a form of lipodystrophy characterized by greatly
reduced
subcutaneous
body
fat,
insulin
resistance,
high
circulating triglyceride levels, and higher blood pressure (Savage
et al., 2003). The FGF21 rs838133 minor allele is not the first
common allele to be associated with apparently paradoxical
effects on fat mass and metabolic markers. Previous human
genetic studies of alleles associated with insulin sensitivity
have shown that most are also associated with an apparently
paradoxical higher fat mass (and the insulin resistance allele is
associated with lower fat mass) (Kilpelainen et al., 2011; Lotta
et al., 2017; Scott et al., 2014; Shungin et al., 2015; Yaghootkar
et al., 2014, 2016). For some of these alleles, the apparent
paradox is explained by the higher fat mass being concentrated
in the lower body, at least in women (e.g., those in or near FAM,
LYPLAL1, and GRB14) (Shungin et al., 2015).
In addition to the anthropomorphic and metabolic associa-
tions, we observed some additional associations that will inform
follow up experimental studies. On the basis of a PheWAS of 82
traits, we observed associations consistent with those observed
in studies of mice that suggest FGF21 is a ‘‘global starvation’’
signal. For example, the allele that increases sugar intake was
associated with lower levels of physical activity and altered chro-
notype, both features of mice with higher FGF21 (Bookout et al.,
2013) but not with female reproductive traits or bone mineral
density.
What are the limitations to using common human genetic vari-
ation to infer likely effects of therapies and experiments targeting
a nearby gene? There are several limitations to our data. First,
there is no direct experimental evidence that the rs838133
variant alters FGF21 gene expression or function. We note that
there was no association between the FGF21 rs838133 allele
and FGF21 expression in the liver on the basis of 1,031 samples,
and it may be that the effect of this variant, or one in linkage
disequilibrium, on FGF21 gene expression is too subtle to pick
up as an eQTL, even in the relevant tissue. Despite occurring
in an exon of FGF21, we cannot rule out the possibility that the
variant operates through a nearby gene, and we note that the
rs838133 allele is associated with the expression of a nearby
gene FUT2, involved in vitamin B12 metabolism (Hazra et al.,
2008). If the allele operates through a different gene, it would
mean our inferences about any experimental or therapeutic in-
terventions targeting FGF21 would be invalid. However, the
fact that the human, mouse, and non-human primate nutrient
preference phenotypes of FGF21 are identical suggests that
this is unlikely. Second, the effects of the FGF21 allele are
extremely small, at approximately 0.33 mm Hg blood pressure
and a 1 mm difference in hip circumference and height. However,
the effect sizes of common genetic variants are not important
when it comes to using them to provide insight into likely effects
of much larger perturbations of a potential target. This point was
recently illustrated by the very subtle but statistically robust
effects of common alleles in genes encoding lipid-lowering
proteins and type 2 diabetes (Ference et al., 2016; Lotta et al.,
2016; Schmidt et al., 2017; Swerdlow and Sattar, 2015). Finally,
the FGF21 allele is very likely to influence human traits
throughout
life
and
therefore
may
have
different
effects
compared with an acute, pharmacological, or experimental
intervention.
In summary, human genetic association data provide further
insight into the potential multiple metabolic effects of FGF21
and have hypothesis-generating implications for the develop-
ment of therapies targeting FGF21.

 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
UK Biobank Cohort
UK Biobank recruited more than 500,000 individuals aged 37–73 years (99.5%
were between 40 and 69 years) between 2006 and 2010 from across the UK.
Participants provided a range of information via questionnaires and interviews
(e.g., demographics, health status, lifestyle), and anthropometric measure-
ments, blood pressure readings, blood, urine, and saliva samples were taken
for future analysis; this has been described in more detail elsewhere (Sudlow
et al., 2015). SNP genotypes were generated from the Affymetrix Axiom UK
Biobank array (�450,000 individuals) and the UK BiLEVE array (�50,000 indi-
viduals). This dataset underwent extensive central quality control (http://
biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk). We based our study on 451,099 individuals of white
European descent as defined by principal-component analysis (PCA). Briefly,
principal components were generated in the 1000 Genomes cohort using
high-confidence SNPs to obtain their individual loadings. These loadings
were then used to project all of the UK Biobank samples into the same
principal-component space, and individuals were then clustered using prin-
cipal components 1–4. We removed 7 participants who withdrew from the
study and 348 individuals whose self-reported sex did not match their genetic
sex on the basis of relative intensities of X and Y chromosome SNP probe
intensity.
FFQ and Alcohol Intake in UK Biobank Participants
The FFQ was added toward the end of the recruitment phase, and participants
completed while at the recruitment center. Participants were then sent four
FFQs and asked to complete them online. The questionnaire focused on the
consumption of approximately 200 commonly consumed food and drinks
(http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/refer.cgi?id=118240). For each partici-
pant completing the FFQ, nutrient intakes were estimated by multiplying the
quantity consumed by the nutrient composition of the food or beverage, as
taken from the UK food composition database McCance and Widdowson’s
The Composition of Foods and its supplements. In total, 211,051 participants
completed at least one FFQ. Participants were asked if this was a standard diet
day for them, and we excluded the 18,054 participants who reported not
following a standard diet. Averages were then calculated for participants
with up to five normal questionnaires for 192,997 individuals.
We derived alcohol units consumed per day for individuals in the UK
Biobank. For individuals reporting drinking alcohol at least once a week, a
units-per-week variable was calculated, and for individuals reporting less
frequent drinking, a units-per-month variable was calculated. A 125 mL glass
of wine (red, white, or sparkling) was considered to be 1.5 units, a pint of
beer or cider was considered to be 2.8 units, other alcoholic drinks (e.g.,
alcopops) were considered to be 1.5 units, and a measure of spirit was consid-
ered to be 1 unit.
Coffee, Smoking, and Salt Intake in UK Biobank Participants
All participants in the UK Biobank were asked about their smoking status, with
individuals defined as never, former, or current smokers. All participants in the
UK Biobank were asked about adding salt to food. Participants were asked,
‘‘Do you add salt to your food? (Do not include salt used in cooking),’’ with
the options ‘‘never/rarely,’’ ‘‘sometimes,’’ ‘‘usually,’’ and ‘‘always.’’ In the gen-
eral questionnaire, participants were asked, ‘‘How many cups of coffee do you
drink each DAY? (Include decaffeinated coffee).’’ Participants were also asked
about whether they drank caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee. From this we
derived a number of cups of coffee per day and a number of cups of caffein-
ated coffee per day.
Disease and Related Anthropometric and Metabolic Traits in UK
Biobank Participants
Measures of Adiposity
We used bio-impedance measures of body-fat percentage measured using
the Tanita BC418MA body composition analyzer.
Measures of Disease and Disease-Related Traits
We defined type 2 diabetes, hypertension, blood pressure, and heart disease
using baseline data and following similar definitions to those used in previous
genome-wide association studies. For coronary artery disease, we addition-
ally included cases from hospital episode statistics available at the time
(through the March 31, 2016, release; International Classification of Diseases,
Tenth Revision, codes I21*, I22*, I23*, I24*, and I25*). We defined type 2 dia-
betes cases if three criteria were present: (1) reports of either type 2 diabetes
or generic diabetes at the interview, (2) at least a 1 year gap from diagnosis
without requiring insulin, and (3) reported age at diagnosis over 35 years, to
limit the number of individuals with slow-progressing autoimmune diabetes
or monogenic forms. Individuals not reporting an age at diagnosis were
excluded. We also excluded individuals diagnosed with diabetes within the
year prior to the baseline study visit, as we were unable to determine whether
they were using insulin within the first year. Controls were individuals not
fulfilling these criteria.
We defined hypertensive patients as those with SBP of >140 mm Hg or dia-
stolic blood pressure of >90 mm Hg or the report of blood pressure medication
use. Controls were individuals not fulfilling these criteria. For the analysis of
systolic and diastolic blood pressure, we corrected blood pressure measures
in people on antihypertensive drugs by adding 15 mm Hg to systolic and
10 mm Hg to diastolic blood pressure, in keeping with the approach taken in
genome-wide association studies.
We defined heart disease cases if individuals reported angina and/or a heart
attack at the interview stage. We defined controls as individuals without these
conditions.
Traits Derived from Accelerometers
The UK Biobank has collected accelerometer data from 103,711 participants,
who wore the devices on the wrist for a continuous period of 1 week. We used
a well-validated and freely available R package called GGIR (version 1.5-12) to
process these files, made available to researchers, in order to extract mea-
sures of physical activity and sleep. For this study, we used three derived
measures of activity and one measure of sleep timing (L5 time). L5 time repre-
sents the midpoint time of the least active 5 hr of the day, as defined by the
minimum point of a moving average of activity levels. Our L5 time variable
represents an individual’s average across all days recorded, and units are re-
ported in number of hours after previous midday. In addition, we also used
measures of physical activity from the UK Biobank to define the proportion
of activity, classified as (1) sedentary or asleep (<40 milligravities), (2) the
proportion of activity at least non-sedentary (>40 milligravities), and (3) the pro-
portion of activity over a threshold representing moderate to vigorous activity
(>100 milligravities).
Traits in Published GWA Studies
We looked up the association of the variant rs838133 in existing relevant
genome-wide association studies, as detailed in the tables. The variant was
not present on the Metabochip.
Hepatic Expression Quantitative Trait Locus Analysis
Three hepatic eQTL datasets, comprising a total of 1,031 liver samples from
individuals of European ancestry (Table S4), were analyzed in a meta-analysis
(preliminary methods and results were reported by A.S. Etheridge et al., 2017,
Am. Soc. Hum. Genet., conference). Tissue procurement, genotyping, and
gene expression and eQTL analyses have been described previously for
each of the three studies (Innocenti et al., 2011; Schadt et al., 2008; Greena-
walt et al., 2011) Genotypes were imputed to the 1000 Genomes Project
phase 1 reference panel with Minimac (https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/
Minimac), and expression probe sequences were mapped to Ensembl genes.
Within each dataset, a genome-wide eQTL analysis was run with an additive
genetic model including dataset-specific covariates to examine cis associa-
tions within a 100 kb flanking window. Results from the three datasets were
then combined with a modified meta-test statistic that was calculated using
the following approach: tmeta = (Pwiti)/O(Pwi
2), w = O(n�(#covariates)�1)
where i is datasets 1–3 and n is sample size. Generation of p values was
accomplished by assuming that the meta-test statistics were normally
distributed.
Statistical Analysis
All genotype-phenotype association data were generated starting from
451,099 individuals defined as European ancestry and using BOLT-LMM

 version 1.2, which uses an LD score regression approach to account for struc-
ture caused by relatedness (close and distant). All association testing was
based on an additive, per allele model and adjusted for SNP chip type (UKB
Axiom or UK BiLEVE), test center, sex, and age (or year of birth for age at
menarche). Accelerometry-based phenotypes were additionally adjusted for
season and age at wear time. We tested approximately 100 traits and so high-
light main associations reaching p < 0.0005, but given that several metabolic
and anthropometric traits reach genome-wide significance, and the known
role of the FGF21 variant, we mention other traits reaching nominal signifi-
cance and used a false discovery rate of 1% to highlight associations in the
PheWAS. For continuous traits, we inverse normalized phenotypes to account
for any skewed distributions.
