Abstract
 Objective—To evaluate whether dispositional mindfulness is associated with glucose 
regulation and type 2 diabetes.
 Methods—Study participants (N = 399) were from the New England Family Study, a 
prospective birth cohort, with median age 47 years. Dispositional mindfulness was assessed using 
the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS). Type 2 diabetes and “normal plasma glucose” 
were defined using American Diabetes Association criteria.
 Results—Multivariable-adjusted regression analyses demonstrated that participants with high 
versus low MAAS scores were significantly more likely to have normal plasma glucose levels 
(prevalence ratio = 1.35 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08,1.87)), and were not significantly 
associated with type 2 diabetes (prevalence ratio = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.38,1.79), adjusted for age, sex, 
race/ethnicity, family history of diabetes and childhood socioeconomic status. Mediation analyses 
provided evidence of mediation via obesity and sense of control, where indirect effects were 
prevalence ratios (95% CI) of 1.03 (1.00,1.10) and 1.08 (1.00,1.21), respectively.

  Conclusions—Dispositional mindfulness may be associated with better glucose regulation, in 
part because of a lower likelihood of obesity and greater sense of control among participants with 
higher levels of mindfulness. These findings need to be replicated by prospective studies to 
establish causality and to evaluate potential implications for mindfulness-based interventions to 
reduce risk of type 2 diabetes.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing in the United States (US) and worldwide. In 
2012, 9.3% of the US population had diabetes, of which approximately 90% was type 2 
diabetes. Diabetes is the 7th leading cause of death in the US. The estimated annual 
economic costs in the US were $245 billion in 2012.
Increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes is due in large part to behavioral changes in diet and 
diet composition in the context of an increasingly obesogenic food environment. Strategies 
to halt and reverse population-level increases in type 2 diabetes have emphasized behavioral 
interventions, but such interventions are only modestly effective., Novel intervention targets 
are needed to improve their effectiveness and ultimately their population-level impact. We 
focus here on one such intervention target, mindfulness, for which there increasing evidence 
of a role in behavior and behavior change.
Mindfulness often is defined as the ability to attend in a nonjudgmental way to one’s own 
physical and mental processes during ordinary, everyday tasks. “Dispositional mindfulness” 
represents an inherent, yet modifiable, trait, where all people have varying capacities to 
attend and to be aware of what is occurring in the present moment. A study of twins 
involving 2118 adolescents suggested that dispositional mindfulness is one-third heritable 
and two-thirds due to non-shared (ie, individual-specific) environmental factors.
Mindfulness interventions appear to have modest effects on altering dispositional 
mindfulness. Consequently, it is useful to understand associations of this naturally occurring 
trait with outcomes of health-related behaviors including type 2 diabetes, particularly 
because relatively low-cost interventions may be able to modify mindfulness.
Little is known about the relation of mindfulness with type 2 diabetes. Preliminary 
mindfulness-based intervention randomized controlled trials in diabetic patients showed 
reductions in fasting glucose or HbA1c in some but not all studies.– The interventions that 
showed significant improvements in glucose regulation trained diabetic patients in 
mindfulness, while also directing their attention to behaviors that improve glucose regulation 
such as diet, physical activity, glucose monitoring, and diabetes medication use., We 
demonstrated associations of dispositional mindfulness with normal fasting glucose among 
participants in the New England Family Study, the same cohort used here. However, 
associations of dispositional mindfulness with type 2 diabetes, and the mechanisms by 
which mindfulness influences glucose regulation and type 2 diabetes, have not yet been 
explored.

 There are a number of mechanisms through which mindfulness could influence type 2 
diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is caused by a complex interaction of environmental factors, 
human behavior and genetic predisposition. Obesity is one of the primary risk factors for 
type 2 diabetes. About 85% of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese.
Evolutionarily, humans have had good cause to crave determinants of obesity, such as 
consumption of high caloric palatable foods and physical rest., In many calorie-rich 
industrialized societies, this craving no longer achieves the same adaptive benefits due to 
much greater food availability and sedentary occupations and pastimes. In these 
environments, craving and resulting behaviors can lead to excessive food consumption, 
obesity, and poor physical conditioning., In this context, mindfulness may be effective at 
limiting overconsumption of food and underutilizing opportunities for physical activity. 
Mindfulness has shown a positive association with greater self-regulation and ability to 
notice cravings without acting on them. Treating emotions and physical sensations as 
passing events can help people tolerate cravings and overcome addictions, whether it is for 
cigarettes or potentially for other consumption-related risks for type 2 diabetes such as 
overconsumption of high caloric palatable foods, or sedentary activities such as electronic 
screen use.,
Neurophysiological studies showed that regions of the prefrontal cortex, including the 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, are implicated in self-regulation 
and inhibitory control related to limiting excessive hedonic (ie, pleasure-focused) feeding 
behavior. Mindfulness meditation interventions have been shown to influence these same 
regions in the prefrontal cortex, which is supportive evidence that mindfulness and related 
interventions such as mindfulness meditation, may be effective for self-regulation to limit 
excessive food consumption, with resulting risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes.
Overall, there are a number of particularly plausible psychological and behavioral 
mechanisms of how dispositional mindfulness could influence glucose regulation, discussed 
in a 2015 published theoretical framework for how mindfulness could influence 
cardiovascular disease risk. Plausible mechanisms include craving (eg, for palatable foods 
and sedentary activities),,, stress response (particularly related to diabetes risk factors, such 
as impacts of stress on palatable food consumption), sense of control (eg, a person’s sense of 
efficacy in carrying out goals related to diabetes prevention, such as diet or physical activity 
regimen adherence), and awareness of present moment experiences (eg, including body 
awareness of how the body feels after consuming certain types/amounts of foods and 
engaging in physical activities).– Observational studies suggest that lipids, hypertension, 
smoking, depression and socioeconomic status also can improve risk prediction for type 2 
diabetes, although their causal role in the development of type 2 diabetes is less clear., These 
may be additional plausible mechanisms of how mindfulness could influence glucose 
regulation. However, the mechanisms linking mindfulness to glucose regulation have not 
been established using modern analytic mediation approaches.
Accordingly, the primary objective of this study was to evaluate associations of dispositional 
mindfulness with glucose regulation and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the study aimed to 
evaluate plausible mechanisms that may help explain how dispositional mindfulness could 
influence glucose regulation, such as obesity, perceived stress, sense of control,

 hypertension, HDL cholesterol, physical activity, smoking, depressive symptoms, and 
educational attainment.
 METHODS
 Sample
Study participants were from the New England Family Study (NEFS), which comprises a 
series of adult follow-up studies of 17,921 offspring born to pregnant women enrolled in the 
New England (Providence and Boston) sites of the Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP) 
between 1959 and 1974. The current NEFS study, named the Longitudinal Effects on Aging 
Perinatal (LEAP) Project, enrolled Providence-born participants between 2010 and 2011. 
From the entire Providence cohort (N = 4062), a random stratified sample of 1400 members 
was selected, with preference (ie, a higher sampling fraction) for racial/ethnic minorities. 
The Providence CPP was predominantly white race/ethnicity at study onset, reflective of the 
demographics in the community at that time in history. Racial/ethnic minorities were 
oversampled in the LEAP Project to increase generalizability of findings to other racial/
ethnic groups. Of the 1400 cohort members randomly selected, participants were eligible for 
assessment (ie, not deceased, not incarcerated, had assessments taken at age 7 years, were 
located, and lived within 100 miles of the clinical assessment site). Of the 796 eligible 
participants, we were able to establish contact with 522 (76%) participants within the 
relatively brief 13-month data collection period, and invited them to participate in the study. 
Of these 522 participants, 19% (N = 95) refused to participate in the study, and an additional 
5% (N = 27) agreed to participate but were unable to schedule assessments within the data 
collection period. Of the 400 final participants, one was excluded due to being diagnosed 
with diabetes at age <20 years (at age 2), suggesting type 1 diabetes, and therefore, removed 
from the risk set for incident type 2 diabetes.
 Independent Variable
Brown and Ryan describe dispositional mindfulness as an inherent state of consciousness 
characterized by the presence or absence of attention to, or awareness of, what is occurring 
in the present moment. The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) is a 15-item 
questionnaire of dispositional mindfulness in which respondents indicate, on a 6-point 
Likert-type scale (1=almost always to 6=almost never), their level of awareness and attention 
to present events and experiences. Sample MAAS items include: “I find it difficult to stay 
focused on what’s happening in the present,” “I tend not to notice feelings of physical 
tension or discomfort until they really grab my attention” and “I could be experiencing some 
emotion and not be conscious of it until some time later.” The MAAS has been shown to 
have a single-factor structure, and appears to emphasize an element related to dissociation 
and absent-mindedness. A mean score is calculated (range 1–6), where higher scores reflect 
greater self-reported attention and awareness, or “dispositional mindfulness.” The scale 
exhibits good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.82–0.87) and high test-retest reliability 
over a 1-month period (intraclass correlation = 0.81).,
The MAAS score has been shown to have a positive association with long-term meditation 
experience, with Zen meditators having higher MAAS scores than age- and sex-matched

 community members, and Thai monks having higher MAAS scores than Thai or American 
students. A systematic review and meta-analysis showed randomized controlled trials that 
evaluate impacts of mindfulness training on self-reported mindfulness scores, including the 
MAAS, exhibit overall improvements in self-reported mindfulness in relation to wait-list 
control groups, but not in relation to active control groups. The convergent and discriminant 
validity of the MAAS has been evaluated, and it appears to measure a distinct construct 
where higher scorers on the MAAS tend to be more aware of and receptive to inner 
experiences and are more mindful of their overt behavior. They are more aware of their 
emotional states and able to alter them, and they are more likely to fulfill basic 
psychological needs. Furthermore, higher MAAS scorers are less likely to be self-conscious, 
socially anxious and ruminative than low scorers. There has been minimal research done on 
MAAS content validity, structural validity and responsiveness; consequently these 
psychometric properties of the MAAS are not well understood. The assessment of 
mindfulness is without a gold standard, and there is current debate on the accuracy of self-
reported mindfulness, including using the MAAS., Thus, these measures should be 
considered instruments of a developing science, not finished products.
Primary analyses utilized a categorical exposure variable called “MAAS score level.” The 
numbers of participants with MAAS score of 1–2, >2–3, >3–4, >4–5 and >5–6 were 7 
(1.8%), 17 (4.3%), 59 (15.1%), 129 (33.0%) and 179 (45.8%), respectively. Consequently 
we applied MAAS score cut points to evaluate associations of low (MAAS score<4; N = 77) 
and medium MAAS levels (MAAS score 4–5; N = 131), in relation to high MAAS levels 
(MAAS score >5, N = 174), all with reasonable sample sizes to allow for adequate statistical 
power, similar to prior research., This approach allowed for exploration of threshold effects 
for low versus high MAAS scores. These are the same cut-points used in prior studies of the 
MAAS score in relation to cardiovascular disease risk factors.,
 Dependent Variables
Type 2 diabetes and “normal plasma glucose” were defined using American Diabetes 
Association criteria., Specifically, participants were considered to have type 2 diabetes if 
they were taking diabetes medication, or had 8-hour fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL or 
non-fasting glucose ≥200 mg/dL without diabetes medication. “Normal plasma glucose” 
was defined as plasma glucose <100 mg/dL and not taking diabetes medication. Medication 
use was assessed directly from participants’ medication bottles brought in during clinical 
assessments, and coded by 2 physicians according to the medical condition for which the 
medications were used. Glucose was measured enzymatically in plasma samples at CERLab 
(Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), described elsewhere., Glucose at the concentrations 
of 90 and 312 mg/dL showed day-to-day variability (CV) of 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively, 
using this assay.
 Potential Mediators
As described above, some of the most plausible mediators between mindfulness and glucose 
regulation, for which we also had data available, are body mass index, sense of control, and 
perceived stress. Body mass index (kg/m2) was directly assessed. Weight and height 
measures were obtained from participants wearing light clothing without shoes, using a

 calibrated stadiometer and weighing scale operated by trained nurse researchers. Heads were 
positioned in the Frankfurt plane. Obesity was defined as BMI≥30 kg/m2. Perceived stress 
was assessed using the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale with established validity/reliability 
described elsewhere (range: 4–20). Sense of control was assessed via the Pearlin and 
Schooler Mastery Scale (range 7–35) with good internal consistency (Cronbach’s a = 0.71), 
where higher levels represent lower perceived control.
Further plausible mediators, for which data also were available, include blood pressure, 
lipids, physical activity, smoking, depression, and socioeconomic status (eg, educational 
attainment). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were assessed by certified research nurses 
using mercury sphygmomanometers, in seated participants with arms at heart level, resting 5 
minutes prior to assessment, consistent with American Heart Association guidelines. The 
mean of the second and third blood pressure readings was used. Hypertension was defined 
as systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg and participants not taking 
antihypertensive medication. HDL cholesterol was measured enzymatically in plasma 
samples at CERLab (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), described elsewhere. HDL-C at 
the concentrations of 27.0 and 54.9 mg/dL showed day-to-day variability (CV) of 3.3% and 
1.7%, respectively, using this assay. Physical activity was assessed using the International 
Physical Activity Questionnaire with reasonable measurement properties, described in more 
detail else-where. Smoking was assessed by self-report, and dichotomized as current smoker 
versus non-smoker. Depressive symptomatology was computed as the sum of responses 
from the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (range: 0–
30). Educational attainment was categorized as ≤high school versus >high school.
 Potential Cofounders
Age was directly assessed via date of birth (recorded directly in this birth cohort), subtracted 
from clinic visit date. Sex was self-reported. Race/ethnicity was self-reported in adulthood. 
In rare cases that it was missing (N = 11), maternal reports of race/ethnicity recorded during 
pregnancy were used. Family history of diabetes was obtained by self-report, asking 
participants whether their biological father or mother ever had diabetes that first appeared as 
an adult. Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) was assessed directly from parents when 
offspring were 7 years old, using a weighted percentile of both parents’ educational 
attainment, occupation, and income relative to the USA population.
 Analytic Methods
Multivariable-adjusted regression analyses evaluated associations of MAAS score level with 
likelihood of having type 2 diabetes or normal plasma glucose. Estimated prevalence ratios 
were calculated utilizing log-binomial regressions. Analyses were adjusted for potential 
confounders including age, sex, race/ethnicity, family history of diabetes, and childhood 
SES.
Mediation analyses assessed whether obesity, physical activity, smoking, hypertension, HDL 
cholesterol, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, sense of control, and educational 
attainment accounted for the association between mindfulness and having normal fasting 
glucose. Analyses used formal mediation methods based on the counterfactual framework,

 which allows for decomposition of a total effect into direct and indirect effects, even in 
models with interactions and nonlinearities., Examining indirect effects provides evidence of 
whether mindfulness may exert its effects uniquely through any of the potential mediators 
examined in this study. Percentile-based 95% confidence intervals were estimated using the 
bootstrap method with 1000 samples. We utilized log-binomial regression analyses to 
evaluate the associations of MAAS level, and each potential mediator, with having normal 
fasting glucose.
For some participants, certain covariates were missing. Assuming that the covariates are 
missing at random, we used multiple imputation to create 100 complete datasets. 
Multivariable regression analyses was performed on each of the 100 complete datasets, each 
comprising 399 participants, and results were combined using Rubin’s Rule for multiple 
imputation.
We performed the mediation analyses, using normal plasma glucose as the primary outcome, 
in the sample with complete data (N = 331) because methods for mediation analyses with 
multiply imputed data are not available. Comparisons between participants with complete 
data (N = 331) versus incomplete data (N = 68) showed no significant mean differences for 
the independent and dependent variables, covariates and potential mediators (p > .05).
The following numbers of LEAP participants provided data for each independent variable, 
dependent variable, and covariate: Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) score (N = 
391), plasma glucose (N = 385), medication use (N = 399), age (N = 399), sex (N = 399), 
race/ethnicity (N = 399), family history of diabetes (N = 393), childhood socioeconomic 
status (SES) (N = 385), body mass index (N = 399), blood pressure (N = 396), HDL 
cholesterol (N = 385), physical activity (N = 376), smoking (N = 399), perceived stress (N = 
392), sense of control (N = 393), depressive symptomatology (N = 392) and education (N = 
392). Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.2 (Cary, NC).
 RESULTS
Initial unadjusted analyses demonstrated significant associations between MAAS level and 
normal plasma glucose levels, age, smoking, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and 
sense of control (Table 1). Further unadjusted analyses demonstrated significant associations 
of diabetes status with childhood socioeconomic index, obesity, hypertension, HDL 
cholesterol, family history of diabetes, sense of control, and educational attainment (Table 
2).
Multivariable regression analyses demonstrated that participants with high versus low 
MAAS levels were more likely (prevalence ratio = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.87) to have normal 
plasma glucose levels, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity and family history of diabetes 
(Table 3); after adjusting for childhood SES, the prevalence ratio was 1.35 (95% CI: 1.05, 
1.73) (Table 3, Figure 1). Similar trends were seen with type 2 diabetes as the dependent 
variable, but effect estimates were not statistically significant, where participants with high 
versus low MAAS were less likely to have type 2 diabetes (prevalence ratio = 0.83; 95% CI: 
0.38, 1.79), after adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, family history of diabetes, and

 childhood SES (Table 3). Formal statistical tests of an interaction between mindfulness and 
sex, and mindfulness and race/ethnicity, for the relationship between MAAS score and 
normal plasma glucose prevalence demonstrated no evidence for effect measure 
modification (p = .88 and p = .97, respectively).
In mediation analyses, obesity and sense of control explained part of the association between 
mindfulness and the likelihood of having a normal fasting glucose. The total effect of high 
versus low MAAS level on having normal fasting glucose in the complete case mediation 
analyses was a prevalence ratio of 1.31 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.67), adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, 
sex, family history of diabetes, and childhood SES. Indirect effects for obesity and sense of 
control were prevalence ratios of 1.03 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.10), and 1.08 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.21), 
respectively. This demonstrated that 0.03 and 0.08 of the 0.31 additional prevalence ratio 
total effects due to high versus low MAAS may be mediated through obesity and sense of 
control, respectively. All other tested mediators (ie, hypertension, HDL cholesterol, physical 
activity, smoking, depressive symptoms, perceived stress and educational attainment) 
showed no significant evidence of mediation.
 DISCUSSION
Study findings demonstrated that participants with higher dispositional mindfulness were 
significantly more likely to have normal plasma glucose, after adjusting for age, race/
ethnicity, sex, family history of diabetes, and childhood SES. Participants with higher levels 
of mindfulness were about 20% less likely to have type 2 diabetes, although confidence 
intervals were wide and these associations were not statistically significant. Mediation 
analyses between mindfulness and glucose regulation suggested potential mediating roles of 
obesity and sense of control.
 Prior Literature
Several studies have investigated the role of mindfulness-based interventions in glucose 
regulation in diabetic patients. Of the 5 RCTs to our knowledge, 2 studies showed significant 
reductions in glucose regulation measures including HbA1C and fasting glucose,, and 3 
studies demonstrated null findings.– Both interventions that showed significant glucose 
regulation improvements specifically trained participants in mindfulness, and also providing 
training in behaviors that improve glucose regulation such as diet, physical activity, glucose 
monitoring, and diabetes medication use., Studies that did not show improvements in 
glucose regulation typically tested standardized mindfulness-based interventions, namely 
Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy, and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction. These 
standardized interventions provide some training in mindful eating and mindful movements, 
but do not deliberately link the importance of these factors to diabetes control, and do not 
address diabetes medication adherence or glucose monitoring., The aforementioned 
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction study did provide some customization of the 
mindfulness intervention to difficult thoughts and feelings related to diabetes. Perhaps not 
unsurprisingly, this latter intervention demonstrated significant improvements in depression 
in the intervention versus control group, but only weak non-significant (p = .09) 
improvements in HbA1c. Mindfulness-based interventions targeted towards improving

 mindfulness skills for glucose regulation may increase effect sizes of mindfulness 
interventions for diabetes management. Examples of plausible targeted interventions include 
mindfulness modules addressing thoughts of craving for high caloric palatable foods or 
sedentary activities. Interventions targeting self-compassion and self-care applied to glucose 
regulation behaviors such as diet, physical activity, weight maintenance, and diabetes 
medication adherence also may be effective. To our knowledge, there have been no 
mindfulness-based interventions to date targeted towards preventing diabetes incidence.
The role of dispositional mindfulness in diabetes risk has received little study. One prior 
investigation by our group in the New England Family Study cohort found significant 
associations of mindfulness with having normal glucose levels, adjusting for age, race/
ethnicity and sex. The current study extended explorations of confounding by adjusting for 
early life and family factors including childhood SES and family history of diabetes. 
Furthermore, this the first study to our knowledge to investigate associations of dispositional 
mindfulness with type 2 diabetes, and to explore potential mediators of the relation between 
dispositional mindfulness and glucose regulation. Dispositional mindfulness is of interest in 
and of itself, as there may be various routes to mindfulness. A twin study in 2118 
adolescents published in 2015 suggested that dispositional mindfulness is one-third heritable 
and two-thirds due to non-shared environmental factors. Mindfulness interventions such as 
mindfulness meditation are some of the best studied routes to improve mindfulness, and may 
indeed be the most effective. However, there may be other influences on dispositional 
mindfulness, such as role modeling by family and community members, and genetic 
differences in neurophysiological abilities to be aware of thoughts, emotions, and physical 
sensations.
 Mechanisms
This study demonstrated evidence of mediation by obesity and sense of control. There was 
no evidence of potential mediation by other plausible factors including hypertension, HDL 
cholesterol, physical activity, smoking, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and 
educational attainment.
Prior studies found associations of mindfulness with measures of adiposity. Studies have 
found significant associations of dispositional mindfulness with body mass index, obesity 
and regional fat distribution,, and evidence of effects of mindfulness-based interventions on 
weight loss in participants seeking to lose weight., Obesity itself is likely the most important 
contributor to type 2 diabetes, where 85% of diabetics are overweight or obese. Mindful 
awareness brought to experiences of food overconsumption and inadequate physical activity 
may help participants be aware of the long reach of their immediate food and exercise 
decisions on their long-term well-being.,
Studies have shown early evidence that mindfulness is related to improved sense of control 
and self-efficacy. For example, a mindful eating intervention in participants with type 2 
diabetes demonstrated improved eating-related self-efficacy in participants following the 
intervention. A prospective study found that participants with greater dispositional 
mindfulness were more likely to enact their physical activity intentions than those with 
lesser dispositional mindfulness. A study by our group demonstrated evidence that sense of

 control is a significant mediator between dispositional mindfulness and cardiovascular 
health. Self-efficacy, a similar construct to sense of control, is related to positive diabetes-
related health behaviors including diet, physical activity and medication adherence.,52 
Further evaluation of plausible mediators in intervention studies and prospective 
observational studies will improve etiologic knowledge.
 Strengths and Limitations
Limitations of the study included cross-sectional analyses where the independent and 
dependent variables, and potential mediators, were assessed at the same time point. Cross-
sectional analyses limit causal inference compared to prospective studies. Future prospective 
studies should provide stronger evidence on whether dispositional mindfulness is associated 
with glucose regulation and type 2 diabetes. Secondly, dispositional mindfulness was 
assessed using a self-report questionnaire. The assessment of mindfulness is without a gold 
standard, and there is current debate on the accuracy of self-reported mindfulness, including 
using the MAAS., Thus, whereas these tools should be considered tools of a developing 
science, they have attained psychometric properties that justify their use in associational 
studies such as the current one (described in more detail in the Methods section above). 
Future research that uses triangulation of methods will allow better causal inference. For 
example, this would include studies that evaluate the effects of mindfulness-based 
interventions on glucose regulation, as well as studies investigating the role of dispositional 
mindfulness in glucose regulation and type 2 diabetes. Thirdly, results should be interpreted 
with the knowledge that total effect analyses were performed on the multiply imputed data 
(N = 399), which reduce bias due to observed covariates, whereas the mediation analyses 
were performed using complete case data (N = 331) due to mediation methods not currently 
available for multiply imputed data. However, effect sizes were similar for both approaches, 
where prevalence ratios for high versus low MAAS on normal plasma glucose was 1.35 
(95% CI: 1.05, 1.73) using multiple imputation (N = 399) and 1.31 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.67) 
using complete case analyses (N = 331) in fully adjusted models. Furthermore, comparisons 
between participants with complete data (N = 331) versus incomplete data (N = 68) showed 
no statistically significant mean differences for the independent and dependent variables, 
covariates, and potential mediators (p > .05), suggesting minimal differences in study 
population characteristics using either approach. Fourthly, as detailed in the Methods 
section, 1400 participants were randomly selected from the Providence Collaborative 
Perinatal Project with preference for racial/ethnic minorities, of which 796 were eligible, 
contact was established with 522, and 400 were assessed. This limitation in generalizability 
should be considered when interpreting the findings. Strengths of the study included direct 
assessments of plasma glucose, fasting time, and diabetes medication, as well as the ability 
to adjust statistically for prospectively assessed plausible confounders including childhood 
SES.
 Conclusions
This study demonstrated a significant, association of dispositional mindfulness with glucose 
regulation, and provided novel evidence that obesity and sense of control may serve as 
potential mediators of this association. As mindfulness is likely a modifiable trait, this study 
provides preliminary evidence for a fairly novel and modifiable potential determinant of

in diabetes risk, mindfulness may serve as an intervention target and risk stratification
