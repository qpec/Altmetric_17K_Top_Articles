abstract
OBJECTIVES: Breastfeeding rates differ among racial/ethnic groups in the United States. Our 
aim was to test whether racial/ethnic disparities in demographic characteristics, hospital 
use of infant formula, and family history of breastfeeding mediated racial/ethnic gaps in 
breastfeeding outcomes. 
METHODS: We analyzed data from the Community and Child Health Network study (N = 1636). 
Breastfeeding initiation, postnatal intent to breastfeed, and breastfeeding duration were 
assessed postpartum. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to estimate relative odds of 
breastfeeding initiation, postnatal intent, and duration among racial/ethnic groups and to 
test the candidate mediators of maternal age, income, household composition, employment, 
marital status, postpartum depression, preterm birth, smoking, belief that “breast is best, 
” 
family history of breastfeeding, in-hospital formula introduction, and WIC participation. 
RESULTS: Spanish-speaking Hispanic mothers were most likely to initiate (91%), intend (92%), 
and maintain (mean duration, 17.1 weeks) breastfeeding, followed by English-speaking 
Hispanic mothers (initiation 90%, intent 88%; mean duration, 10.4 weeks) and white 
mothers (initiation 78%, intent 77%; mean duration, 16.5 weeks); black mothers were 
least likely to initiate (61%), intend (57%), and maintain breastfeeding (mean duration, 
6.4 weeks). Demographic variables fully mediated disparities between black and white 
mothers in intent and initiation, whereas demographic characteristics and in-hospital 
formula feeding fully mediated breastfeeding duration. Family breastfeeding history and 
demographic characteristics helped explain the higher breastfeeding rates of Hispanic 
mothers relative to white and black mothers.
CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals and policy makers should limit in-hospital formula feeding and 
consider family history of breastfeeding and demographic characteristics to reduce racial/
ethnic breastfeeding disparities.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Breastfeeding rates 
differ between racial/ethnic groups in the United States, 
resulting in considerable health disparities for infants. 
Black infants are breastfed for substantially shorter 
periods compared with white infants, and Hispanic 
infants are breastfed for signifi
 cantly longer periods.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: We show that demographic 
characteristics and in-hospital formula feeding explain 
breastfeeding gaps between black and white mothers, 
whereas demographic characteristics and family 
history of breastfeeding help explain higher rates of 
breastfeeding in Hispanic mothers compared with white 
and black mothers.

Substantial research shows that 
breastfeeding benefits the neurologic, 
immunologic, digestive, and physical 
development of children. 
1 The 
American Academy of Pediatrics 
recommends exclusive breastfeeding 
for the first 6 months of life, with 
continued breastfeeding and 
complementary foods at least until 
the child’s first birthday. Despite this 
recommendation, approximately 
one-half of children in the United 
States are no longer breastfed by 6 
months, with only a small percentage 
breastfed for the recommended 
period of 12 months. 
2 Suboptimal 
levels of breastfeeding cost the US 
economy billions of dollars annually 
3, 
 
4 
and contribute to an estimated 
911 (predominantly infant) deaths 
each year.4 Importantly, the social, 
health, and economic burdens of low 
breastfeeding rates are not shared 
equally across racial and ethnic 
groups.
In the most recent US National 
Immunization Survey, only 
66.4% of black mothers initiated 
breastfeeding in 2012, compared 
with 83% of white mothers and 
82.4% of Hispanic mothers. 
2 
Racial/ethnic gaps in breastfeeding 
remained significant at 6 months, 
with only 35.3% of black mothers 
still breastfeeding, compared with 
55.8% of white mothers and 51.4% 
of Hispanic mothers. Black women 
consistently remain at the bottom on 
all breastfeeding indices, although 
the gap between black mothers and 
other ethnic groups has narrowed by 
a few percentage points since 2000, 
suggesting breastfeeding promotion 
efforts have helped.
Many factors have been proposed 
to explain these racial/ethnic 
breastfeeding disparities. Black 
mothers, for example, tend to be 
younger, unmarried, and of lower 
income and education compared 
with white mothers, all factors 
linked to lower breastfeeding rates. 
5 
Interestingly, although Hispanic 
mothers share many of these 
demographic characteristics with 
black mothers, they have higher rates 
of breastfeeding than white mothers. 
Moreover, accounting for income 
and maternal education differences 
between black and white mothers 
does not eliminate disparities in 
breastfeeding. 
6, 
 
7 To address the 
persistent large gap in breastfeeding 
rates between black mothers and 
mothers of other groups, the current 
article includes these demographic 
factors, but it also considers other 
causes.
The goal of the current study was to 
identify key nondemographic factors 
that might explain disparities in 
breastfeeding among black, white, 
and Hispanic mothers in the United 
States. We considered racial/ethnic 
differences in attitudes toward 
breastfeeding, family history of 
breastfeeding, in-hospital formula 
introduction, and participation in 
the Special Supplemental Nutrition 
Program for Women, Infants, and 
Children. Our objective was to 
determine whether racial/ethnic 
disparities in breastfeeding initiation, 
postnatal intent, and duration could 
be more fully explained by using 
statistical mediation techniques that 
included these hypothesized new 
factors.
METHODS
Study Sample
The sample consisted of 1636 
mothers from the Community and 
Child Health Network, an National 
Institutes of Health multisite, 
community-based participatory 
research project designed to 
examine how community, family, 
and individual factors contribute to 
racial/ethnic health disparities for 
mothers and infants. The current 
study uses data from sites in 
Baltimore, Maryland, Washington, 
DC, and Lake County, Illinois. Each 
site sought to include mothers of low 
socioeconomic status (SES) from the 
3 race/ethnicity groups, reflecting 
the local population; oversampling 
was included when needed. Data 
were obtained when mothers 
enrolled between 2008 and 2010 
during their postpartum hospital 
stay and from in-home interviews 1 
and 6 months’ postpartum. Mothers 
included in this study provided 
infant feeding data (regardless of 
feeding method) for at least 2 time 
points. Overall, <1% of initiation and 
postnatal intent data were missing, 
although 12% of mothers did not 
provide breastfeeding duration 
data and 30% lacked information 
on family breastfeeding history. We 
attempted to address this missing 
data issue by using the multiple 
imputation function in Stata, 
 
8 
generating 10 possible data sets from 
which estimates were pooled.
Measures
Independent Variables
Racial/ethnic identification was 
based on mothers’ self-report as 
either non-Hispanic white (hereafter 
referred to as white), non-Hispanic 
black (hereafter referred to as 
black), or Hispanic. The Community 
Child Health Research Network was 
designed to recruit mothers with 
these primary racial/ethnic identities 
(irrespective of legal status); thus, 
<1% also identified as other or mixed 
race. Participants who designated 
mixed race were placed in either 
the Hispanic or the black group to 
which they partially self-identified. 
Hispanic participants were further 
categorized as primarily English- or 
Spanish-speaking because markers 
of acculturation, including language 
spoken at home, 
 
8 have been shown to 
have a large impact on breastfeeding 
outcomes. 
9
Potential Mediators
Candidate mediators were chosen 
based on known associations 
with breastfeeding as rereported 
in the literature. We tested these 
factors for their ability to mediate 
or explain a significant proportion

of the variance in racial/ethnic 
disparities in breastfeeding 
outcomes. Demographic factors 
included maternal age, 
 
10 education, 
employment at 1 month postpartum, 
 
11 
poverty status 
10 (adjusted for family 
size by using federal guidelines 
12), 
relationship status13 (single, 
in a relationship, or married 
[mutually exclusive categories]), 
coresident father, 
 
14 and coresident 
grandparent. 
15 Health-related 
variables included 1 month 
postpartum depression, 
 
16 according 
to the Edinburgh Postnatal 
Depression Scale 
17 (scores ≥9 
were categorized as depressed); 
smoking at 1 month18; and infant 
preterm birth 
19 (via medical records, 
gestation <37 weeks). We also 
collected maternal and paternal 
family history of breastfeeding 
20 
(determined by asking mothers and 
fathers “Did the woman who raised 
you breastfeed any children?”) and 
the mother’s belief 
21 that “breast is 
best” (assessed by asking “Which of 
the following do you think is the best 
way to feed a baby—breastfeeding, 
a mix of breast milk and formula, 
only formula, or either breast milk or 
formula?”). Mothers who indicated 
breastfeeding was the best feeding 
method were compared with those 
who did not. Mothers were asked 
during their in-hospital stay whether 
they had participated in the Special 
Supplemental Nutrition Program for 
Women, Infants, and Children 
22 at 
any time during the past year. Finally, 
patient medical records indicated 
whether formula was introduced 
during the hospital stay23 after birth.
Outcome Variables
Primary outcomes of interest 
were breastfeeding initiation, 
postnatal breastfeeding intent, and 
breastfeeding duration. Breastfeeding 
initiation was measured at 1 month 
postpartum with the question “Have 
you ever breastfed your baby?” 
Mothers were categorized as having 
initiated breastfeeding if they 
breastfed at least once. Postnatal 
breastfeeding intent was assessed 
during the in-hospital interview and 
derived from the question “How do 
you plan to feed your baby?” Mothers 
were categorized as intending 
to breastfeed if they planned to 
provide any amount of breast milk 
or not intending to breastfeed if 
they planned to provide only infant 
formula. Breastfeeding duration was 
defined as the number of weeks that 
the infant had been breastfed by the 
6-month interview. Women who 
did not initiate breastfeeding were 
included in our duration measure 
and coded as 0. If the mother was 
no longer breastfeeding at the 1- 
or 6-month interviews, mothers 
were asked “How old was the 
child in weeks when you stopped 
breastfeeding?” to extrapolate total 
duration.
Statistical Analysis
Hierarchical linear modeling offers 
advantages over other statistical 
tools in evaluating nested data, 
which, in this case, adjusts for shared 
variance that participants (level 1) 
may have if they are from the same 
site and allows for heterogeneity of 
effect sizes for different sites (level 
2). 
24 All analyses were performed by 
using multilevel analysis, with study 
site added to the level 2 regression 
equation as a random factor, 
and independent and mediator 
variables included in univariate and 
multivariate models in the regression 
equation at level 1. Comparisons 
with Hispanic participants excluded 
the Baltimore site because only 4 
Hispanic subjects were recruited, 
precluding good estimates at level 2. 
All analyses were conducted by using 
Stata version 14 (Stata Corp, College 
Station, TX).
Mediation Analysis
A mediator is a variable, or set of 
variables, hypothesized to explain 
or cause the observed association 
between an independent variable 
(ie, race/ethnicity) and a dependent 
variable (eg, breastfeeding outcome). 
Using classic mediation criteria, 
 
25 a 
variable can be said to mediate the 
relationship between an independent 
and dependent variable (Path C) 
if: (1) the independent variable 
significantly accounts for variation 
in the mediator (Path A); (2) the 
mediator significantly accounts for 
variation in the outcome variable 
(Path B); and (3) both the mediator 
and the independent variable are 
included in a multivariate model, 
and the relationship between the 
independent variable and the 
outcome variable is significantly 
reduced or no longer statistically 
significant (Path C′), while the 
mediator continues to predict 
significant variation in the outcome 
variable ( 
Fig 1). There are often 
multiple mediators or causes of an 
association between an independent 
and dependent variable. 
26 The 
same mediation criteria are used to 
test multiple mediators; however, 
all mediators must be added 
simultaneously to equations testing 
Path A, Path B, and Path C′ to ensure 
that each mediator accounts for a 
unique proportion of the variance 
shared between the independent and 
dependent variable.
Mediation analysis was performed to 
test whether the candidate mediators 
helped to explain racial/ethnic 
breastfeeding disparities ( 
Figs 1 and  
2). 
First, hierarchical linear modeling 
was used to obtain estimates of 
racial/ethnic gaps in breastfeeding 
outcomes (Path C). Racial/ethnic 
differences in potential mediators 
were next tested (Path A). The 
association between these potential 
mediators and breastfeeding 
outcomes was then assessed (Path B). 
Only variables that were significant 
at Paths C, A, and B, respectively, 
were considered further. To avoid 
introducing reverse causality when 
assessing mediators of racial/ethnic 
disparities in breastfeeding initiation 
and postnatal intent, we did not 
consider variables that occurred 
3

MCKINNEY et al 
after the hospital stay (ie, working 
at 1 month, postpartum depression, 
smoking). Smoking, for instance, was 
measured at 1 month postpartum, 
which occurs after breastfeeding 
initiation and thus carries no 
predictive power.
The fourth and final step regressed 
significant mediator(s) on a 
breastfeeding outcome, with race/
ethnicity included in the model to 
estimate the indirect effect (Path C′). 
Sobel tests were performed (data 
not shown) to ensure that mediators 
had significant indirect effects 
(P < .05) when the aforementioned 
mediation criteria were met. Once 
mediators are included in the model, 
a racial/ethnic gap in breastfeeding 
can be said to be partially mediated 
if the association between race/
ethnicity and breastfeeding was 
reduced and C′ is still statistically 
significant, and it is fully mediated 
if C′, representing the racial/ethnic 
disparity in breastfeeding, is no 
longer statistically significant. 
25 
Unstandardized betas (β) and 
confidence intervals are reported.
RESULTS
Consistent with previous findings, 
black mothers had significantly lower 
rates of breastfeeding initiation, 
postnatal intent, and duration 
compared with other racial/ethnic 
groups, whereas Spanish-speaking 
Hispanic mothers tended to have 
the highest breastfeeding indicators 
( 
Table 1). Many other significant 
differences emerged between racial/
ethnic groups among our candidate 
mediator variables ( 
Table 2), and 
candidate variables that did not 
differ (Path A) were not considered 
further.  
Tables 3,  
4, 5,  
6, and  
7 
report regression coefficients for 
all significant mediation pathways, 
which are summarized in  
Fig 1.
Disparities Between Black and White 
Mothers
Initiation
Black mothers were less likely to 
initiate breastfeeding than white 
mothers ( 
Table 3, Path C). Black 
women also experienced higher rates 
of poverty and were less likely to 
have a college degree or be married 
compared with white women, all of 
which predicted less breastfeeding 
initiation ( 
Table 3, Paths A and B). 
Together, poverty, college education, 
and marital status fully mediated the 
gap in breastfeeding initiation 
( 
Table 3, Path C′).
Postnatal Intent
Black mothers were less likely to 
intend to breastfeed than white 
mothers ( 
Table 3, Path C). Again, 
poverty, a college degree, and being 
married fully mediated the gap in 
postnatal breastfeeding intent 
( 
Table 3, Path C′).

FIGURE 1
Mediation model pathways. Path C and C′ differ in that path C is the raw association between 
the independent and outcome variables, and path C′ is the residual association between the 
independent and outcome variables after the indirect effect of the mediator(s) is included in the 
model. Only racial/ethnic contrasts signifi
 cant at Path C were pursued. Of those, mediation analysis 
was discontinued if Path A was not signifi
 cant.

Duration
Black mothers weaned their infants 
10.3 weeks earlier than did white 
mothers ( 
Table 3, Path C). College 
education and marital status differed 
between groups and predicted 
shorter breastfeeding durations 
( 
Table 3, Paths A and B). In addition, 
white mothers were significantly 
less likely to experience in-hospital 
formula introduction than black 
mothers, which was the biggest 
predictor of breastfeeding duration, 
even in models controlling for racial/
ethnic disparities in initiation and 
postnatal intent. Together, these 
factors fully mediated the disparity 
in breastfeeding duration ( 
Table 3, 
Path C′). Poverty was not a unique 
predictor of breastfeeding duration.
Disparities Between White and 
Spanish-speaking Hispanic Mothers
Initiation
Spanish-speaking Hispanic mothers 
were more likely to initiate 
breastfeeding compared with white 
mothers ( 
Table 4, Path C). Spanish-
speaking mothers were more likely 
to have had their own mothers 
breastfeed children, which predicted 
higher breastfeeding initiation 
( 
Table 4, Paths A and B). Maternal 
family history of breastfeeding fully 
mediated the initiation gap between 
white and Spanish-speaking Hispanic 
mothers ( 
Table 4, Path C′).
Postnatal Intent
Spanish-speaking Hispanic mothers 
were significantly more likely to 
intend to breastfeed than were white 
mothers ( 
Table 4, Path C). However, 
no variables met mediation criteria.
Duration
Spanish-speaking Hispanic and white 
mothers had comparable durations 
for breastfeeding. Mediation analysis 
was therefore not pursued.

Disparities Between White and 
English-speaking Hispanic Mothers
Initiation
English-speaking Hispanic mothers 
exhibited significantly higher rates 
of initiation than did white mothers 
( 
Table 5, Path C). English-speaking 
mothers were more likely to have 
had their own mothers breastfeed 
children, which predicted higher 
breastfeeding initiation ( 
Table 5, 
Paths A and B). Maternal family 
history of breastfeeding fully 
mediated the initiation gap between 
white and English-speaking Hispanic 
mothers ( 
Table 5, Path C′). 
Postnatal Intent
English-speaking Hispanic mothers 
were more likely to intend to 
breastfeed than were white mothers 
( 
Table 5, Path C), although no 
variables met mediation criteria.
Duration
White mothers breastfed ∼6.9 weeks 
longer than did English-speaking 
Hispanic mothers ( 
Table 5, Path 
C); the latter group tended to be 
younger and lack a college degree 
( 
Table 5, Path A), both of which fully 
mediated the gap in duration ( 
Table 5, 
Path C′).
Disparities Between Black and 
Spanish-speaking Hispanic Mothers
Initiation
Spanish-speaking Hispanic mothers 
had significantly higher rates of 
initiation than did black mothers 
( 
Table 6, Path C). Spanish-speakers 
were also more likely to have a 
mother who had breastfed ( 
Table 
6, Path A), which predicted greater 
breastfeeding initiation in the next 
generation ( 
Table 6, Path B) and 
partially mediated this racial/ethnic 
disparity ( 
Table 6, Path C′).
Postnatal Intent
Black mothers were less likely to 
intend to breastfeed after leaving the 
hospital than were Spanish-speaking 
mothers ( 
Table 6, Path C). Having a

mother who breastfed also partially 
mediated the difference in postnatal 
intent ( 
Table 6, Path C′).
Duration
Black mothers nursed an estimated 
10.3 weeks less than did Spanish-
speaking Hispanic mothers ( 
Table 
6, Path C). Again, black mothers 
were less likely to have a family 
history of breastfeeding but were 
also less likely to live with the 
infant’s father ( 
Table 6, Path A). 
Together, these 2 variables partially 
explained the large gap in duration 
( 
Table 6, Path C′).
Disparities Between Black and 
English-speaking Hispanic Motherse
Initiation
English-speaking Hispanic mothers 
initiated breastfeeding more often 
than did black mothers ( 
Table 7, Path 
C). Mothers whose own mothers 
had breastfed were more prevalent 
among English-speakers than black 
mothers ( 
Table 7, Path A), which 
partially mediated the initiation gap 
( 
Table 7, Path C′).
Postnatal Intent
English-speaking Hispanic mothers 
were more likely to intend to 
breastfeed than were black mothers 
( 
Table 7, Path C). English-speaking 
Hispanic mothers were also more 
likely to have maternal and paternal 
mothers who had breastfed ( 
Table 
7, Path A). In this model, both 
family history variables predicted 
unique variations in postnatal 
intent and partially mediated the 
racial/ethnic gap in intent ( 
Table 7, 
Paths B and C′).
Duration:
Black women weaned their infants 
∼3.0 weeks earlier than English-
speaking Hispanic women ( 
Table 
7, Path C). Black mothers were 
less likely to be married or have a 
maternal history of breastfeeding 
than English-speaking Hispanic 
mothers ( 
Table 7, Path A). Both 
variables fully mediated the 
disparity in duration ( 
Table 7, 
Path C′).

intended, initiated, and maintained 
breastfeeding to a lesser degree 
than white mothers. Lower levels of 
breastfeeding initiation and postnatal 
intent among black mothers 
compared with white mothers were 
fully mediated by demographic 
factors. This finding is not surprising 
given that black women had 
higher rates of poverty and lower 
levels of education and marriage, 
variables that predicted lower rates 
of breastfeeding initiation and 
postnatal intent in the overall sample. 
Breastfeeding duration disparities 
between black and white women, 
however, were not fully explained by 
using demographic factors.
Poverty did not significantly mediate 
differences in duration between 
black and white mothers as it did 
for initiation and postnatal intent. 
Poverty may act as a proxy for 
in-hospital formula introduction, 
which more often occurs in 
predominately black communities 
that may also be low-income. 
27 In 
fact, the use of in-hospital formula 
feeding played the most important 
role for duration. Black mothers’ 
newborns were much more likely to 
be fed formula in the hospital than 
newborns of white mothers. This 
difference was not explained by 
higher rates of breastfeeding intent 
and initiation in white mothers. 
Our finding echoes reports from 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention that documented higher 
rates of supplemental feeding in 
hospitals serving black communities. 
In-hospital supplementation of 
formula prohibits establishing a 
pattern of exclusive breastfeeding 
early on, which has been shown 
to hinder breastfeeding outcomes 
postdischarge. 
28 Our study suggests 
that if only hospital formula 
introduction were eliminated, the 
black/white gap in breastfeeding 
duration could be reduced by 
∼1.8 weeks or 20% of the overall 
difference.
Consistent with notions that cultural 
norms regarding breastfeeding 
practices drive the effect of 
acculturation/immigrant status on 
breastfeeding outcomes, Spanish-
speaking Hispanic women were 
more likely to have a family history 
of breastfeeding compared with 
white and English-speaking Hispanic 
women. Maternal family history of 
breastfeeding fully mediated the 
initiation disparity between white 
and both Spanish-and English-
speaking Hispanic mothers. Racial/
ethnic differences in maternal 
age and education fully explained 
disparities in duration between 
white and English-speaking Hispanic 
mothers. No mediators were found for 
postnatal intent or duration among 
Spanish-speaking Hispanic and white 
mothers, which speaks to previous 
evidence of the Hispanic paradox 
in US breastfeeding rates. 
29 This 
paradox is a phenomenon in which 
Hispanic people in the United States 
experience good health outcomes 
despite low SES and common risk 
factors, particularly among recent 
immigrants. 
30 Comparable duration 
of breastsfeeding between white 
and Spanish-speaking Hispanic 
women in our sample suggests that 
breastfeeding norms of Spanish 
speakers’ native countries 
31 may 
overcome adverse effects of low 
SES that characterizes this less 
acculturated group in the United 
States. It is also notable that no 
significant racial/ethnic differences 
were found in the belief that “breast 
is best” or maternal employment at 
1 month postpartum, because both 
factors have been hypothesized to 
mediate racial/ethnic breastfeeding. 
32 
It is possible, however, that the 
oversampling of low SES participants 
of all racial/ethnic groups in this study 
restricted variability on these factors, 
leading to null results.

bolsters breastfeeding outcomes, 
and this intergenerational factor 
mediates racial/ethnic breastfeeding 
disparities. This finding complements 
previous research which found 
that markers of acculturation, such 
as language spoken at home, 
 
8 
predict substantial differences 
in breastfeeding behavior. 
9, 
 
33 
In addition to family history of 
breastfeeding, higher rates of 
coresident fathers and marriage 
among Hispanic women accounted 
for some of the breastfeeding 
disparities between black and both 
English- and Spanish-speaking 
Hispanic women. This finding 
supports previous research showing 
the important role that the infant’s 
father can play in fostering positive 
breastfeeding outcomes. 
34
The current study had several 
limitations. We cannot establish 
causality; interventions are needed 
to test whether decreasing the 
introduction of formula in hospitals 
serving black communities, for 
example, would reduce disparities 
between black and white women in 
breastfeeding duration. Second, 
this study included an 
overrepresentation of mothers of 
low SES, and the results may not 
be generalizable to understanding 
racial/ethnic disparities in 
breastfeeding rates between 
white, black, and Hispanic mothers 
among the middle- or upper-class. 
Finally, future research is needed 
to explore additional potential 
mediators because many racial/
ethnic disparities in breastfeeding 
were not fully explained by our 
analyses.
CONCLUSIONS
Large ethnic/racial gaps in 
breastfeeding rates exist in the 
United States among black, white, 
and Hispanic infants and their 
mothers. In line with previous 
speculations, intergenerational 
experience with breastfeeding seems 
to be an important predictor of 
infant feeding behaviors and helps 
explain why Hispanic women have 
better breastfeeding outcomes. 
Just as importantly, the negative 
impact of hospital infant formula 
feeding practices on black women 
warrants strong consideration. 
35 
Changing hospital relationships with 
formula companies that relinquish 
fiscal dependency on free formula 
is a notorious challenge for many 
hospitals that strive to improve 
breastfeeding outcomes. 
36 Change 
is possible, however, as evidenced 
by the emergence of “baby-friendly 
hospitals, 
” some of which serve areas 
with largely low-income and minority 
patient populations. 
37 This active 
inquiry into functional variables that 
can yield healthier outcomes for 
infants and mothers has produced 
new findings and may support 
planned interventions at the levels 
of individual families and health care 
providers.
