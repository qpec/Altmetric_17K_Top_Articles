ABSTRACT
Candida auris is an emerging multidrug-resistant yeast that has been re-
sponsible for invasive infections associated with high morbidity and mortality. C. au-
ris strains often demonstrate high fluconazole and amphotericin B MIC values, and
some strains are resistant to all three major antifungal classes. We evaluated the sus-
ceptibility of 16 C. auris clinical strains, isolated from a wide geographical area, to 10
antifungal agents, including APX001A, a novel agent that inhibits the fungal protein
Gwt1 (glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored wall transfer protein 1). APX001A dem-
onstrated significantly lower MIC50 and MIC90 values (0.004 and 0.031 �g/ml, respec-
tively) than all other agents tested. The efficacy of the prodrug APX001 was evalu-
ated in an immunocompromised murine model of disseminated C. auris infection.
Significant efficacy (80 to 100% survival) was observed in all three APX001 treatment
groups versus 50% survival for the anidulafungin treatment group. In addition,
APX001 showed a significant log reduction in CFU counts in kidney, lung, and brain
tissue (1.03 to 1.83) versus the vehicle control. Anidulafungin also showed a signifi-
cant log reduction in CFU in the kidneys and lungs (1.5 and 1.62, respectively) but
did not impact brain CFU. These data support further clinical evaluation of this new
antifungal agent.

C
andida auris is an emerging multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen associated with
therapeutic drug failure and mortality (1). In a recent study, the mortality rate of
patients with C. auris infections was 59%, with patients dying either with or as a result
of the C. auris infection (2). A contributing factor is widespread resistance to flucona-
zole, as well as variable susceptibilities to amphotericin B, echinocandins, and other
azoles. Examination of this collection of 54 isolates from Pakistan, India, South Africa,
and Venezuela showed that the isolates were resistant to fluconazole (93%), voricona-
zole (54%), amphotericin B (35%), echinocandins (7%), and flucytosine (6%) using
stringent breakpoints inferred from other Candida species (2). Resistance to echino-
candins, the first-line treatment for Candida infections, is particularly problematic. In
that same study, two of the isolates were triply resistant to azoles, echinocandins, and
amphotericin B, resulting in a dearth of treatment options among the three approved
major drug classes. C. auris can persist in the environment for at least 2 weeks (3), and
patients with C. auris have been colonized for several months after the infection has
resolved (1). This has led to environmental spread and transmission within health care
facilities that are difficult to decontaminate and outbreaks that are difficult to treat
(2, 4).
Contributing to the health threat is that C. auris is often misdiagnosed as Candida
haemulonii, Candida famata, or Rhodotorula glutinis and cannot be accurately identified

 using commercial yeast identification systems such as Vitek 2 or API 20C AUX. Instead,
diagnosis relies upon matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight (MALDI-
TOF) or molecular methods based upon sequencing the D1-D2 region of the 28s
ribosomal DNA (rDNA) or the internal transcribed region of rDNA (1). This is problematic
since many laboratories do not have rapid access to these technologies.
C. auris was originally identified in a patient in Japan in 2009 (5). Since then, it
appears to have emerged simultaneously in several countries, resulting in the identi-
fication of four distinct clades (2). International travel has expedited the spread of this
species, which has now been identified in numerous countries around the globe,
including Japan, South Korea, South Africa, Kuwait, Kenya, United Kingdom, India,
Pakistan, Colombia, Venezuela, and the United States (2, 6–9).
APX001 (formerly E1211) is a first-in-class small-molecule antifungal drug candidate.
It is a water-soluble phosphate prodrug that is rapidly metabolized by systemic
phosphatases to the active moiety, APX001A (formerly E1210). APX001A has a novel
mechanism of action that is different than the other five classes of antifungal agents.
APX001A targets the highly conserved fungal enzyme Gwt1. This conserved enzyme
catalyzes the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) posttranslational modification that an-
chors eukaryotic cell surface proteins to the cell membrane (10, 11). In yeasts, GPI
mediates cross-linking of cell wall mannoproteins to �-1,6-glucan. Inhibition of this
enzyme in both Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae results in inhibition of
maturation and localization of GPI-anchored mannoproteins. Inhibiting Gwt1 blocks the
inositol acylation step during synthesis of GPI-anchored proteins of the fungal cell wall,
which compromises cell wall integrity, biofilm formation, and germ tube formation and
produces severe fungal growth defects (10, 12). The closest mammalian ortholog of
Gwt1 is the PIG-W protein, which is not sensitive to inhibition by APX001A (10).
APX001A has broad in vitro activity against major fungal pathogens, including
Candida, Cryptococcus, Aspergillus, Scedosporium, Fusarium, and members of the Muco-
rales order (13–17). It maintains its activity against azole-resistant and echinocandin-
resistant strains, which is consistent with the distinct mechanism of action. In invasive
fungal infection animal models, the administration of APX001 (or APX001A) resulted in
high survival rates and reduced colony counts of fungi in the lungs, kidneys, and brains
of infected mice (18–21). The latter is particularly important given the brain dissemi-
nation associated with several invasive fungal infections (22).
In this study, we evaluated the activities of APX001A and APX001 against a panel of
16 diverse C. auris isolates and in a disseminated candidiasis infection model, respec-
tively. These isolates were previously used to evaluate the activity of two compounds
in clinical development, the glucan synthesis inhibitor SCY-078 and the echinocandin
CD101 (23, 24). The strains included clinical isolates from Germany, Japan, South Korea,
and India (23), and many demonstrated elevated MIC values for amphotericin B and
fluconazole.
RESULTS
Antifungal susceptibility profile. APX001A was highly active against all 16 strains
of C. auris with markedly lower MIC50 and MIC90 values (concentrations that inhibit 50
and 90% of the tested isolates, respectively) than the other tested antifungals with an
MIC50 of 0.004 �g/ml, an MIC90 of 0.031 �g/ml, and a range of values between 0.002
to 0.063 �g/ml (Table 1). These values are equal to or lower than those previously
observed for the activity of APX001A against other Candida species (14, 16). The next
most active agent was anidulafungin with MIC50 and MIC90 values of 0.125 and 0.25
�g/ml, respectively. Other compounds, including flucytosine, caspofungin, micafungin,
and the three azoles (itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole), demonstrated
MIC90 values of 1 or 2 �g/ml. Amphotericin B was slightly less active, with MIC90 values
of 4 or 8 �g/ml when read at 24 or 48 h, respectively (Table 1). The latter values are
higher than the amphotericin B epidemiological cutoff of 2 �g/ml for the five other
Candida species according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) inter-
pretive breakpoints, suggesting a trend for C. auris toward elevated MIC values or

 resistance (25). Fluconazole was the least active drug tested with both an MIC50 and
MIC90 of �64 �g/ml, an observation consistent with widespread resistance that has
been reported elsewhere (2).
Survival in a disseminated C. auris infection model. A neutropenic mouse model
of disseminated candidiasis was developed to enable the in vivo assessment of the
efficacy of antifungal compounds against C. auris. To determine the optimal inoculum
that would cause a disseminated infection, immunocompromised mice (n � 5) were
inoculated with 106 to 108 blastospores in 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (via
the tail vein) of clinical isolates CBS 12766 (India) and CBS 12777 (India). Survival was
monitored as a marker of disease for 14 days. Based on these preliminary experiments,
an inoculum of 3 � 107 blastospores of CBS 12766 was found to be optimal for use in
subsequent efficacy studies (unpublished observations).
APX001 intraperitoneal (i.p.) dosing regimens were chosen that included both twice
daily (BID) and three times daily (TID) for two different dose levels (78 and 104 mg/kg).
These dose levels were chosen based upon doses successfully used in a previous animal
model (20). Phase 1 studies of APX001 has demonstrated that it has a long half-life in
humans (�2.5 days) (26, 27); however, its half-life in mice is short (1 to 1.8 h depending
upon the route of administration), necessitating multiple daily doses (20, 28). The
anidulafungin dose (10 mg/kg BID i.p. or 20 mg/kg/24 h) was chosen since it is above
the dose associated with killing of 1 log CFU of several strains of C. albicans (1.95 to 13
mg/kg/24 h) and Candida glabrata (3.31 to 11.8 mg/kg/24 h), which were previously
determined for anidulafungin in similar murine neutropenic disseminated candidiasis
models (29).
In this disseminated C. auris infection model, 100% mortality was observed for the
vehicle BID-treated control group by day 5 (Fig. 1). The percent survivals on day 16 for
mice in the APX001 78-mg/kg BID, 78-mg/kg TID, 104-mg/kg BID, and anidulafungin
10-mg/kg BID groups were 90, 100, 80, and 50%, respectively. Mice in all APX001
treatment groups had a significantly higher percent survival compared to the anidu-
lafungin (P � 0.034) and vehicle groups (P � 0.0001). There was no statistically
significant difference between the three APX001-treated groups. The anidulafungin
treated mice also had a significantly higher percent survival compared to the vehicle
group (P � 0.0001).
Fungal burden: CFU reductions. In a subsequent study of disseminated C. auris
infection, mice were sacrificed at 48 h for determination of the lung, kidney, and brain
fungal burdens after i.p. dosing of APX001 (78 mg/kg BID, 78 mg/kg TID) and anidu-
lafungin (10 mg/kg BID) versus the vehicle control. The 48-h time point was chosen to
ensure 100% survival at the time of sacrifice. Both doses of APX001 and anidulafungin

 demonstrated a significant log10 reduction in kidney CFU/g (1.16 to 1.62) and lung
CFU/g (1.49 to 1.74) at 48 h versus the vehicle control group (P � 0.0003) (Fig. 2). There
was no statistically significant difference in the reduction of fungal burden in lung and
kidney for the two APX001-treated groups.
Since Candida infections can be hematogenously disseminated to other organs
including the brain, CFU counts were also enumerated from brain tissue at 48 h. The
APX001 78-mg/kg BID treatment group demonstrated a 1.83 and 1.48 log reductions
compared to both the vehicle control and the anidulafungin-treated group (P � 0.0004
and 0.005, respectively). The APX001 78-mg/kg BID and TID treatment groups were not
statistically different from each other, although the APX001 TID treatment group did
not reach statistical significance versus the vehicle control (P � 0.0691).
At the 48-h time point, APX001 demonstrated a significant reduction in the kidney,
lung, and brain fungal burdens, whereas anidulafungin demonstrated a significant
reduction in only kidney and lung fungal burdens (Fig. 2). These findings are consistent
with poor central nervous system (CNS) penetration observed for the echinocandins
(30).

 DISCUSSION
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has identified C. auris as a serious global
health threat that can cause serious invasive infections (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/
diseases/candidiasis/candida-auris-qanda.html). C. auris is often multidrug resistant, is
difficult to detect, and has caused outbreaks in health care settings. As a result, new
treatment options are required to combat this emerging health care threat, especially
for multidrug-resistant strains. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro activity of
APX001A against a panel of 16 diverse C. auris isolates, as well as the in vivo activity of
the prodrug APX001, in a disseminated candidiasis model that utilized one of the
isolates that originated from India (CBS 12766).
APX001A demonstrated an MIC90 value that was 8-fold lower than the next most
active drug, anidulafungin, and �30-fold lower than all other compounds tested (Table
1). In addition to the improved C. auris microbiological activity versus currently mar-
keted drugs, APX001A also demonstrated a lower MIC90 than two other agents in
clinical development, SCY-078 and CD101 that were evaluated versus the same 16
strains; the MIC90s for SCY-078 and CD101 were 1 and 0.25 �g/ml, respectively (23, 24).
Recently, other compounds in development have been evaluated against a panel of
100 strains housed at the CDC representing the four C. auris clades that included triply
resistant isolates. Against this panel, the MIC90 values for VT-1598, a fungal CYP51
inhibitor, and SCY-078 were both 1 �g/ml (31, 32).
APX001 was evaluated in a disseminated C. auris infection model in immunocom-
promised mice. The echinocandin anidulafungin was chosen as a control since it was
the second most microbiologically active agent and represents the class of agents most
likely to be used as first-line therapy (1, 9). The dose of anidulafungin that was chosen
has been previously shown in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling experi-
ments to be higher than both the stasis dose and the dose resulting in 1 log killing of
C. albicans and C. glabrata (29). Thus, it was anticipated that this dose regimen would
be effective in this model. The doses of APX001 used in this model are greater than or
equal to doses that have been previously shown to be effective in animal models of
candidiasis or other invasive fungal infections (18, 20, 28) and achieve area under the
concentration-time curve (AUC) after 24 h values in mice that are severalfold (�3) lower
than the steady-state AUC0�24 values anticipated to be used in phase 2 studies in
humans (26, 27). In the current model of disseminated C. auris infection, APX001
resulted in significantly better survival than anidulafungin. Both APX001 and anidula-
fungin demonstrated significant and equivalent decreases in kidney and lung CFU at 48
h. However, only APX001 demonstrated a reduction in brain CFU, a finding consistent
with the brain penetration observed in 14C-APX001 distribution studies where radio-
activity was detected in tissues associated with invasive fungal infections (33). This
contrasts with the poor CNS penetration observed for the echinocandins (30). It is
possible that better brain penetration (or other unexamined compartments that show
a differentiated distribution pattern such as eye) may have contributed to better overall
survival in this model.
One limitation of this study is that only APX001 78-mg/kg BID dosing—and not the
78-mg/kg TID dosing—demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in brain CFU.
It is possible that larger numbers of animals in each treatment group would allow
resolution of this discrepancy, or alternatively, evaluating fungal brain burden at a time
point greater than 48 h. In addition, the efficacy of APX001 administration in a delayed
therapy model requires further investigation.
We demonstrated here that APX001A and its prodrug form, APX001, have potent
activity against C. auris both in vitro and in vivo, respectively. APX001 may be a viable
treatment option for infections attributable to the emerging nosocomial pathogen C.
auris, especially for infections due to strains that are resistant to multiple drug classes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolates tested. A total of 16 clinical isolates of C. auris from a wide geographic area (Germany,
Japan, South Korea, and India) were tested for their susceptibility to 10 different antifungal agents.

 Fourteen of these C. auris isolates were obtained from the CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre, Utrecht,
the Netherlands (CBS strains 10913, 12372, 12373, 12766, 2768, and 12770 to 12777), and the other two
strains were from the Center for Medical Mycology Culture Collection characterized previously (23, 24).
Candida krusei ATCC 6258 and Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019 were used as quality control strains in
susceptibility testing. One of the clinical isolates of C. auris (CBS 12766, isolated in India) was used as the
infecting strain in the animal model of disseminated infection.
Antifungal agents. The activities of 10 antifungals against C. auris were tested, including anidula-
fungin (Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, New York, NY), caspofungin (Merck Co., Kenilworth, NJ), flucytosine
(Astellas Pharma US, Inc., Northbrook, IL), micafungin (Astellas Pharma, Inc., Tokyo, Japan), and ampho-
tericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole (AMB, FLC, ITC, POS, and VRC were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). APX001A was originally synthesized at Eisai Co., Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan, and obtained from Amplyx Pharmaceuticals.
Antifungal susceptibility testing. To establish the antimicrobial activity of APX001A against 16
strains of C. auris, broth microdilution susceptibility testing was performed according to the guidelines
in the CLSI standard M27-A3 (34). Similar to the echinocandins, the APX001A MICs were evaluated after
24 h of incubation and read as 50% inhibition as previously described (16). MIC values were evaluated
visually at 24 and 48 h, and endpoints were recorded at the lowest drug concentration to inhibit 50 or
100% of growth compared to the growth control (34).
Animal use and care. All animal-related study procedures were compliant with the Animal Welfare
Act, the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare.
Mice were used upon review and approval of an addendum to an existing protocol by the Animal Care
and Use Committee of Case Western Reserve University. Female CD1 mice (Charles River Laboratories,
Wilmington, MA) with a body weight of �25 g were obtained and allowed to acclimate for a minimum
of 5 days prior to use. Environmental controls for the animal room were set to maintain a temperature
of 16 to 22°
C, a relative humidity of 30 to 70%, and a 12:12 hourly light-dark cycle.
Disseminated C. auris infection model. Mice were immunosuppressed by i.p. injection of cyclo-
phosphamide at 200 mg/kg 3 days before and 150 mg/kg 1 day after challenge. On the day of the
challenge, blood was collected from one mouse from each group for a white blood cell count to verify
immunosuppression. Mice were infected via the tail vein with 3 � 107 C. auris CBS 12766 blastospores
in 0.1 ml of PBS. Treatment was initiated 2 h postchallenge with test compounds being administered by
i.p. injection. Treatment groups consisted of (i) vehicle control, (ii) APX001 at 78 mg/kg BID, 78 mg/kg TID,
and 104 mg/kg BID, and (iii) anidulafungin at 10 mg/kg BID. Survival was monitored for 16 days
postinoculation. Differences in cohorts were analyzed by the log-rank test and the Fisher exact test.
In a subsequent experiment, mice were sacrificed (five animals per group) 48 h postinfection and
their kidneys, lungs, and brains were harvested aseptically and weighed. Tissues were homogenized and
serially diluted in PBS, with homogenates plated onto potato dextrose agar (Difco Laboratories), and then
incubated for 48 h to determine the number of CFU. The tissue fungal burden was expressed as the
average log CFU/g of tissue. Differences in mean CFU in kidneys, lungs, and brains were compared to the
vehicle control using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post hoc Tukey test. A P value of �
0.05 was considered statistically significant.
