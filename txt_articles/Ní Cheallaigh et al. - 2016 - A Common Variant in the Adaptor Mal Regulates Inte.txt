SUMMARY
Humans that are heterozygous for the common S180L
polymorphism in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) adaptor
Mal (encoded by TIRAP) are protected from a number
of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis (TB),
whereas those homozygous for the allele are at
increased risk. The reason for this difference in sus-
ceptibility is not clear. We report that Mal has a
TLR-independent role in interferon-gamma (IFN-g) re-
ceptor
signaling.
Mal-dependent
IFN-g
receptor
(IFNGR) signaling led to mitogen-activated protein ki-
nase (MAPK) p38 phosphorylation and autophagy.
IFN-g signaling via Mal was required for phagosome
maturation and killing of intracellular Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb). The S180L polymorphism, and
its murine equivalent S200L, reduced the affinity of
Mal for the IFNGR, thereby compromising IFNGR
signaling in macrophages and impairing responses
to TB. Our findings highlight a role for Mal outside
the TLR system and imply that genetic variation in TI-
RAP may be linked to other IFN-g-related diseases
including autoimmunity and cancer.
INTRODUCTION
Genetic variation in proteins involved in innate immunity, partic-
ularly Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and their signaling adaptor
proteins, has been proposed to account for variation in sus-
ceptibility to infectious pathogens. MyD88 adaptor-like (Mal),
encoded by the gene Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain-
containing adaptor protein (TIRAP), was initially described as a
signaling adaptor protein leading to nuclear factor kappa-light-
chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) activation down-
stream of TLR4 (Fitzgerald et al., 2001; Horng et al., 2001) and
TLR2 (Horng et al., 2002; Yamamoto et al., 2002). A role for
Mal as a ‘‘bridging adaptor’’ has since been established with
Mal recruited to the plasma membrane, where it facilitates
myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) deliv-
ery to activated TLRs to initiate signal transduction in a structure
called the Myddosome (Bonham et al., 2014; Kagan and Medz-
hitov, 2006). Mal has also been reported to function as a signa-
ling adaptor for endosomal TLR signaling (Bonham et al., 2014).
Twonon-synonymoussinglenucleotidepolymorphisms(SNPs)
in TIRAP with functional consequences have been identified,
D96N and S180L. The S180L SNP is common in Indian and Euro-
pean (approximately 15%–20% carrying the L allele and 2%–3%
being homozygous for the L allele) populations (Ferwerda et al.,
2009) and results in alteration of a potential binding site near
D96, leading to steric occlusion (Valkov et al., 2011). S180L has
been associated with altered susceptibility to a number of infec-
tiousdiseasesincluding severesepsis,severepneumococcaldis-
ease, Haemophilus influenzae, and malaria (Ferwerda et al., 2009;
Khor et al., 2007; Ladhani et al., 2010). An association has been
reported between the S180L TIRAP polymorphism and TB sus-
ceptibility with heterozygotes for the mutation showing protection
from disease and homozygotes showing increased susceptibility
(Capparelli et al., 2013; Castiblanco et al., 2008; Khor et al., 2007;
Selvaraj et al., 2010), although other studies have failed to repli-
cate these findings (Dissanayeke et al., 2009; Nejentsev et al.,
2008). A recent meta-analysis of the data confirms the association
(Liu et al., 2014). The mechanism underlying the effect of the
S180L SNP has not yet been elucidated.

 Macrophages are key phagocytic cells that can eliminate or
harbor intracellular bacteria, such as Mtb and also play a key
role in secreting cytokines, which polarize subsequent adaptive
immunity to a beneficial T helper 1 (Th1) or deleterious Th2 type
response. Macrophages carry out a number of key antimicro-
bial functions including autophagy and phagosomal matura-
tion, which if successful can kill intracellular mycobacteria
(Deretic et al., 2006; Harris et al., 2009). IFN-g plays a critical
role in promoting antimicrobial functions. It activates ma-
crophages, leading to production of nitric oxide (NO) and reac-
tive oxygen species (ROS), phagosomal maturation, auto-
phagy,
and
bactericidal
activity
(Gutierrez
et
al.,
2004;
MacMicking, 2012; Matsuzawa et al., 2014). Individuals with
partial or complete defects in the IFN-g signaling pathway
have increased susceptibility to Mtb, as well as to other myco-
bacterial species (Bogunovic et al., 2012; Filipe-Santos et al.,
2006).
In this study, we report that the murine equivalent of S180L,
S200L, replicated human findings with homozygotes displaying
increased severity of tuberculous disease. In vitro, the S200L
mutation resulted in impaired phagosome maturation and killing
of Mtb. We demonstrate that, unlike S180L, S200L did not affect
TLR signaling. The impaired TB immunity seen with S200L was
due to its effect on a Mal-dependent, TLR-independent, IFNGR
signaling pathway. Mal-dependent responses to IFN-g included
p38 MAPK phosphorylation, autophagy, and phagosomal matu-
ration, but not the canonical signal transducer and activator of
transcription-1 (STAT-1) phosphorylation pathway. The S180L
polymorphism reduced the affinity of Mal for the IFNGR, thereby
compromising human macrophage responses to IFN-g. This
Mal-dependent IFNGR signaling pathway, modulated by the
S180L mutation, might affect susceptibility to infectious dis-
eases, inflammatory diseases, and cancer.
RESULTS
The S200L Mutation Is Associated with Increased
Severity of TB Disease in Vivo
Mice with the equivalent of the human S180L mutation in TIRAP
(Tirap 200L) were generated to provide an in vivo model of Mtb
infection (Figure S1). Wild-type (SS), heterozygote (SL), and ho-
mozygote (LL) mice were infected with a high dose of Mtb H37Rv
(a laboratory strain of virulent Mtb) via aerosol and weighed
weekly. SL mice were protected against weight loss (Figure 1A).
Mice were sacrificed at 8 weeks post-infection and lung lysates
were analyzed. LL mice showed increased severity of TB
disease, with an increase in bacterial burden (Figure 1B), despite
similar levels of lung tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) pro-
duction (Figure 1C). Most markedly however, we observed
increased lung inflammation in LL mice (Figure 1D) compared
to SL and SS mice. This correlates with the protection for hetero-
zygotes and the increased susceptibility seen in homozygotes
Figure 1. Mice Homozygous for Mal S200L, the Equivalent of Mal S180L, Develop More Severe Lung Inflammation in Response to In Vivo

Age- and sex-matched WT (Mal200S/S), heterozygote (Mal200S/L), and homozygote (Mal200L/L) mice were infected with 500 cfu of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(Mtb) H37Rv by aerosol.

 for the mutation in human studies. The phenotype of TB infection
seen with the S200L mutation in mice replicated the human
phenotype with S180L.
S200L Affects Macrophage Function Independently of
Cytokine Production
Mycobacterial survival in macrophages is an in vitro read-out of
macrophage function (Watson et al., 2012). Macrophages from
mice with the S200L mutation displayed a defect in killing of
intracellular mycobacteria (Figure 2A). Macrophages from mice
with the S200L mutation displayed a defect in phagosome matu-
ration, corresponding with the defect seen in bactericidal activity
(Figures 2B and 2C). Unlike Tirap�/� macrophages described
later, the S200L macrophages displayed no impairment in pro-
duction of these cytokines (Figures 2D and S2A), indicating
that the defect seen in mycobactericidal activity was not due
to an impairment of cytokine production. In addition, S200L ho-
mozygote macrophages, unlike Tirap�/� macrophages, did not
exhibit attenuated cytokine responses to TLR2 and TLR4 ligands
(Figures S2B and S2C), indicating that S200L did not affect TLR2
or TLR4 signaling.
Mal and MyD88, but Not TLRs 2 and 4, Are Required for
Macrophage Killing of Virulent Mtb
We proceeded to assess whether Mal-deficient macrophages
showed a similar in vitro phenotype to S200L macrophages in
response to Mtb infection. Immortalized and primary murine
bone marrow macrophages were used, as well as TIRAP-
silenced THP-1 cells. In contrast to our observations in S200L
macrophages (Figure 2D), we observed that production of
the key anti-mycobacterial cytokine TNF-a in response to Mtb
was greatly reduced in Mal-deficient cells (Figures 3A–3C).

also
impaired
in
the
absence of Mal (Figures S3A and S3B,
with confirmation of TIRAP silencing in
Figure S3C). Mal-deficient macrophages
(Figures 3D and 3E and S3D) showed a
marked inability to kill intracellular Mtb,
similar to that seen in the S200L macrophages. We also as-
sessed the role of TLRs 2 and 4 in our model. Tlr2�/�, Tlr2/4
double knockout (dko) and Myd88�/� macrophages replicated
the defect in pro-inflammatory cytokine production seen in
Mal deficient cells. Tlr4�/� macrophages showed a smaller,
but still significant, impairment in cytokine responses (Figures
3F and 3G and S3E and S3F). Notably, whereas Myd88�/� mac-
rophages replicated the defect in bactericidal activity seen in
Tirap�/� cells, Tlr2�/�, Tlr4�/�, and Tlr2/4 dko murine macro-
phages and THP-1 macrophages treated with an anti-TLR2
antibody did not show a similar defect despite impairments in
cytokine induction (Figures 3H and 3I and S3G). Consistent
with our findings is a previous report of unimpaired bactericidal
activity of Tlr2/4/9 triple knockout macrophages and impaired
restriction of Mtb growth by Myd88�/� macrophages (Ho
¨ lscher
et al., 2008). These data indicated that Mal and MyD88 had a
function in killing of Mtb, and that this was distinct from the
known role of Mal downstream of TLRs 2 and 4. This defect in
mycobactericidal activity seen in the absence of Mal, but not
in the absence of TLRs 2 and 4, was not due to defects in cyto-
kine production.
Mal Is Required for Autophagy and IFN-g Induced
Phagosome Maturation
We sought to identify Mal-dependent but TLR-independent
macrophage effector mechanisms. Autophagy provides a mech-
anism of killing and removing intracellular pathogens and con-
tributes to a number of critical host immune responses to Mtb
(Nı
´ Cheallaigh et al., 2011). To determine whether Mtb-induced
autophagic flux was impaired in the absence of Mal, we infected
primary macrophages with Mtb in the presence or absence of
bafilomycin, which blocks autophagosome fusion with lyso-
somes and thereby completion of autophagy and breakdown
370

 of autophagosomes (Yamamoto et al., 1998). Mtb-induced auto-
phagic flux was reduced in the absence of Mal (Figure 4A-B).
When autophagy was impaired in macrophages using knock-
down of the key effector proteins ATG7 or BECLIN-1 by siRNA,
a similar defect in bactericidal activity and phagosomal matura-
tion to that seen in Mal-deficient cells was observed (Figures
S4A–S4C).
We assessed whether Mal was required for phagosomal
maturation by pretreating macrophages with IFN-g or RPMI
control and infecting the macrophages with FITC-labeled live
Mtb. We identified phagolysosomes using anti-CD63 antibody
or LysoTracker Red and assessed co-localization of bacteria
and phagolysosomes. IFN-g pre-treatment increased co-local-
ization of bacteria and phagolysosomes in WT, but not in
Tirap�/� macrophages (Figures 4C and 4D [LysoTracker]
and Figures 4E and 4F [CD63]) a trend which persisted up to
24 hr post IFN-g treatment (Figure S4D). Similar results were
obtained in differentiated THP-1 cells treated with siRNA
against Mal and stained with LysoTracker or the mature endo-
lysosomal marker LAMP-1 (Figures 4G and S4E). Notably, IFN-
g did increase phagosomal maturation in Tlr2/4 dko, but not
Myd88�/� macrophages (Figure 4H). Thus, Mal and MyD88,
but not TLRs 2 and 4, were required for IFN-g-induced phago-
some maturation.

 Mal and MyD88, but Not TLRs 2 and 4, Are Required for
Interferon-Inducible Protein 10 Production, p38
Phosphorylation, and Autophagy in Response to IFN-g
Given our findings of impaired IFN-g induced phagosomal matu-
ration in the absence of Mal and MyD88 but not TLRs 2 and
4, we hypothesized that the Mal-dependent but TLR-indepen-
dent pathway required for killing of intracellular Mtb might
be explained by Mal participating in MyD88-dependent IFNGR
signaling. Previously, normal STAT-1 phosphorylation but im-
paired IFN-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) secretion was reported
in MyD88-deficient macrophages (Sun and Ding, 2006). We
identified a profound defect in IFN-g-induced IP-10 secretion
in Tirap�/� and Myd88�/� macrophages, but not in Tlr2/4 dko
macrophages or Tram�/� macrophages (Figure 5A and S5A).
IP-10 secretion was also reduced in TIRAP-silenced THP-1 cells
(Figure S5B). IFN-g-induced STAT-1 phosphorylation remained
intact in Mal-deficient cells (Figure S5C). We observed a reduc-
tion in Cxcl10/Ip10 mRNA and Tnfa mRNA in Tirap�/� macro-
phages after IFN-g treatment—a trend not observed for the
STAT-1 target gene, Nos2, or for Arg1 mRNA (Figure S5D).
P3 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are a class of
MAPK that respond to stress stimuli including cytokines and
are involved in apoptosis and autophagy. An IFNg-induced
p38 MAPK signaling pathway, which culminates in autophagy
and killing of intracellular bacteria, was recently reported (Matsu-
zawa et al., 2014). We hypothesized that Mal might be required
for this pathway. P38 MAPK was phosphorylated in response
to IFN-g, peaking at 4 hr post-treatment (Figures 5B, top panel),
and this was impaired in Tirap�/� macrophages (Figure 5B, bot-
tom panel and S5E). IFN-g induced autophagy, but not starva-
tion-induced autophagy, was reduced in Tirap�/� macrophages,
(Figures 5C and S6A and S6B). These data demonstrate that Mal
was required for IFN-g induced P38 MAPK phosphorylation,
autophagy and IP-10 secretion.

(C–F) WT and Tirap�/� iBMM were stimulated overnight with rmIFN-g (20 ng/ml) prior to infection with FITC-labeled Mtb H37Rv. Cells were stained with Ly-

 Mal Interacts Directly with the IFNGR
We hypothesized that Mal might act as a bridging adaptor for
MyD88 and the IFNGR. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous
IFNGR resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of overexpressed
Mal (Figure 5D, left panel). This interaction required full-length
Mal, as a mutant construct consisting solely of the TIR domain
did not immunoprecipitate with the IFNGR (Figure S7A). Immu-
noprecipitation of full-length overexpressed HA-Mal resulted
in co-immunoprecipitation of IFNGR, confirming that Mal
can bind IFNGR directly (Figure 5D, right panel). Mal did not
precipitate with other proteins including Beclin-1 and BCL-2
(Figure S7B).
We then hypothesized that if Mal functions as a bridging
adaptor between MyD88 and the IFNGR, then the previously

 reported interaction between MyD88 and the IFNGR (Sun and
Ding, 2006) would be reduced in the absence of Mal. We
observed increased recruitment of MyD88 to IFNGR in IFNg-
treated control cells (Figure 5E, lanes 5/6); however, in TIRAP-
silenced or Mal-deficient cells (knockdown shown in Figure S7C)
this interaction was reduced to background levels (Figure 5E,
lanes 7/8 and Figure S7D).

(FLIM FRET) technology. FRET occurred between IFNGR and
MyD88, indicating that they are interacting basally and for up
to 0.5 hr post IFN-g treatment (Figure 5F) in WT cells. This
steady-state interaction between MyD88 and IFNGR was dis-
rupted after initial signal transduction. In Tirap�/� cells, there
was no evidence of such a basal interaction, a pattern not altered
by subsequent IFN-g treatment. These data demonstrated that
Mal bound to IFNGR and was required for the interaction be-
tween MyD88 and IFNGR.
Interferon Gamma Is Required for Autophagy and
Phagosome Maturation in Response to Mtb
Our data had established that Mal is required for an IFN-g
signaling pathway, culminating in p38 MAPK phosphorylation
and autophagy. We hypothesized that the observed defect in
autophagy and killing of intracellular Mtb was due to the defect
in the IFN-g induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation pathway. How-
ever, we observed the deficits in autophagy and killing in a
monoculture of macrophages in the absence of exogenous
IFN-g. We therefore hypothesized that macrophages secrete
small quantities of IFN-g that are functionally relevant in our
model. Immortalized and primary macrophages and differenti-
ated THP-1 cells produced small but detectable amounts of
IFN-g when infected with Mtb (Figures S8A–S8C). IFN-g produc-
tion was reduced in Tirap�/� immortalized bone-marrow-derived
macrophages (iBMM) (Figure S8A)—this may be due to impaired
TLR2 and/or TLR4 signaling or impaired IFN-g signaling,
because IFN-g can upregulate its own production in a positive
feedback loop. We also observed IFN-g production by immortal-
ized and primary macrophages using intracellular staining and
flow cytometry (Figures S8D–S8F). Macrophages produced a
considerable amount of IFN-g if allowed to recover from LPS tol-
erization and restimulated for 4 hr (Figures S8E–S8G). Although
our data show that Mtb can induce IFN-g production by macro-
phages, the levels produced are extremely low compared to
those produced by T cells or NK cells. We therefore sought to
assess whether the low levels of IFN-g present in our macro-
phage cultures were functionally signficant for our key end-
points. Macrophages treated with a blocking antibody against
IFN-g (Figures S9A and S9B) and Ifng–/� macrophages (Figures
S9C and S9D) showed reduced maturation of Mtb containing
phagosomes. In the case of Ifng�/� macrophages, maturation
was restored by adding exogenous IFN-g (Figure S9D). Ifng�/�
macrophages also showed reduced autophagy in response to
Mtb (Figures S9E and S9F). Finally, Ifng�/� macrophages
showed a defect in bactericidal activity as assessed by intracel-
lular bacterial burden at 72 hr, similar to that seen in Tirap�/�
macrophages (Figure S9G). These data demonstrated that
macrophages secrete small but functionally relevant amounts
of IFN-g.
The S200L/S180L Mal Mutation Reduces IFN-g
Signaling
Given the new role identified for Mal in IFN-g signaling, we then
proceeded to look at the effect of the S200L polymorphism on
TLR2, TLR4, and IFN-g signaling in macrophages. As noted
above, the S200L mutation did not affect secretion of the pro-
inflammatory cytokine TNF-a in response to the TLR2 ligands
Malp-2 and Pam3CysK4 or the TLR4 ligand LPS (Figures S2A–
S2C) or Tnfa mRNA levels in response to TLR2 and TLR4
ligands (Figure 6B). However, macrophages from LL mice
and, to a lesser extent, SL mice, showed a decreased IP-10
response to IFN-g stimulation (Figures 6A and 6C), indicating
that carriage of the 200L allele in mice, impairs IFN-g, but not
TLR, responses.
We then sought to determine the effect of the S180L muta-
tion in human macrophages. We derived macrophages from
peripheral blood monocytes (MDMs) from donors genotyped
using allelic discrimination. MDMs were stimulated with TLR
ligands and TNF-a secretion was measured by ELISA. We
observed decreased responses to TLR2 and TLR4 ligands in
human MDMs (Figure 6E). We observed a decrease in IFN-
g-driven IP-10 secretion in MDMs from individuals who were
homozygous for the S180L mutation (Figure 6D). We pro-
ceeded to assess whether the S180L mutation altered the
affinity of Mal for the IFNGR. Using site-directed mutagenesis,
we
synthesized
HA-tagged
human
Mal
with
the
S180L
mutation (180L). S180L variant human Mal shows decreased
affinity for the IFNGR relative to HA-tagged wild-type Mal (Fig-
ure 6F). The S180L mutation reduces the affinity of Mal for the
IFNGR and reduces IP-10 secretion in response to IFN- g
stimulation.
DISCUSSION
Here we show that the murine equivalent of the S180L mutation
in Mal, Mal S200L, replicated the phenotype previously reported
from humans with the S180L polymorphism: it conferred pro-
tection from tuberculous disease on heterozygotes for the muta-
tion and increased susceptibility on homozygotes. In vitro, Mal
S200L impaired phagosome maturation and killing of intra-
cellular mycobacteria. However, unlike S180L, S200L did not
affect TLR signaling. We demonstrated a mechanism for these
observations: the S200L polymorphism affected a TLR-indepen-
dent, Mal-dependent, IFNGR signaling pathway. Mal-dependent
IFNGR signaling was required for p38 phosphorylation, auto-
phagy, phagosome maturation, and killing of intracellular myco-
bacteria. This IFNGR signaling pathway was attenuated by the
human mutation S180L. This offers an explanation for how the
common S180L mutation affects host innate immune responses
to Mtb. The fact that this common polymorphism attenuates
IFNGR signaling might have relevance for host susceptibility to
a number of IFN-g-related conditions including autoimmunity
and cancers.
A number of publications regarding the effect of the S180L
SNP on infectious disease susceptibility in humans have re-
ported a heterozygote advantage with increased susceptibility
seen in homozygotes (Capparelli et al., 2013; Castiblanco
et al., 2008; Khor et al., 2007; Selvaraj et al., 2010). A murine
model using the equivalent of the S180L mutation, S200L,

 replicated these findings, with heterozygotes protected from
weight loss (a cardinal clinical feature of human tuberculosis)
and homozygotes displaying increased bacterial burden and
lung inflammation.
In vitro, macrophages from mice carrying the L allele displayed
impaired phagosome maturation and killing of Mtb but did not
show evidence of impaired cytokine production. In contrast,
macrophages from TLR-deficient mice displayed impaired cyto-
kine production but preserved phagosome maturation and killing
of Mtb. Mal-deficient macrophages displayed impairment of
cytokine production in addition to the phenotype seen in the
S180L macrophages of impaired phagosome maturation and
killing.
These findings led us to search for a TLR-independent func-
tion for Mal. We show here a TLR2- and TLR4-independent
role for Mal in the IFNGR signaling pathway. Mal bound to the
IFNGR and MyD88 and acted as a bridging adaptor between
these proteins. Mal was required for IP-10 production in res-
ponse to IFN-g and for a pathway involving p38 MAPK phos-
phorylation, culminating in autophagy and killing of intracellular
bacteria. Autophagy is a key means of killing intracellular bacte-
ria, including Mtb, and also plays a role in regulation of cytokine
secretion (Nı
´ Cheallaigh et al., 2011; Peral de Castro et al., 2012).
IFN-g-induced phagosome maturation is dependent on Beclin-1
and might indeed be autophagy-dependent (Harris et al., 2007).
The defect in autophagy seen in the absence of Mal-dependent
IFNGR signaling provides an explanation for why Mal and

blotting.
MyD88, but not TLRs 2 and 4, are
required for macrophage killing of Mtb.
IFN-g is a canonical macrophage acti-
vator and is known to play a critical role
in immune responses to Mtb (Bogunovic
et al., 2012; Cooper et al., 1993; Filipe-
Santos et al., 2006; Flesch and Kaufmann, 1991; Flynn et al.,
1993). IFN-g is secreted in large quantities by activated Th1 cells
(Mosmann and Coffman, 1989), activated CD8+ cytotoxic cells
(Sad et al., 1995), and NK cells (Perussia, 1991). However, our
model for bactericidal activity and autophagy consisted of a
monoculture of macrophages. There are numerous reports of
macrophages secreting IFN-g (Darwich et al., 2009; Di Marzio
et al., 1994; Fenton et al., 1997; Fultz et al., 1993), albeit in limited
quantities, although some authors have highlighted the possible
effect of contaminating cells in producing IFN-g (Schleicher
et al., 2005). The increased proportion of IFN-g producing cells
in macrophages pre-stimulated with LPS and then ‘‘recovered’’
(O’Carroll et al., 2014) provides compelling evidence that macro-
phages can produce IFN-g given appropriate stimuli.
We show here that the murine immortalized and primary mac-
rophages used in our Mtb infection model secreted small but
functionally decisive quantities of IFN-g in response to infection
with Mtb and that Mal played a critical role in macrophage re-
sponses to Mtb, which are IFN-g dependent.
Given our identification of a role for Mal in IFNGR signaling and
its established role in TLR2 and TLR4 signaling, we examined
the effect of the S180L polymorphism and the murine equivalent
of the S180L polymorphism, S200L, on these pathways. We
show that responses to IFN-g are reduced in human cells with
the 180L variant. Human 180L variant Mal showed a reduced af-
finity for the IFNGR. Cells from mice with the equivalent mutation
also showed impairment in IFNGR signaling.

 Human S180L reduced responses to TLR2 and TLR4 ligands,
consistent with the known role of Mal as a signaling adaptor pro-
tein downstream of TLRs 2 and 4, and with published data on the
role of TLR2 as a pattern-recognition receptor involved in pro-in-
flammatory cytokine production by Mtb-infected macrophages.
Previously published data have shown that Mal is not required for
responses to high doses of TLR2 ligands (Kenny et al., 2009);
however, we hypothesize that the doses of Mtb used in this study
correspond to the lower doses of TLR2 ligands for which Mal is
required. Our findings that S180L reduced responses to TLR 2
and 4 ligands are consistent with a previous report using
L-variant Mal transfected into murine MEFs (Khor et al., 2007)
and with a recent study where PBMCs from individuals with
the Mal S180L allele were stimulated with heat-killed Mtb (Cap-
parelli et al., 2013). In contrast, another publication reported no
difference between TLR2 and TLR4 signaling in vitro in PBMCs
from individuals with the SS and SL genotypes but did show
an increase in response to low doses of TLR2 ligand in PBMCs
from a single individual with the LL genotype (Ferwerda et al.,
2009). This finding might have been caused by the presence of
polymorphisms in MyD88 which interact with the Mal SNP (Cap-
parelli et al., 2013).
Macrophages from mice homozygous for the S200L muta-
tion, the murine equivalent of S180L, did not show an impair-
ment in TLR signaling but did show an impairment in IFN-g
signaling. Murine Mal differs from human Mal in that it has 20
more amino acids at the N terminus. Mutations in Mal might
selectively impair certain signaling pathways only, as demon-
strated by a recent report on a form of Mal with an altered lipid
binding domain, which selectively impaired responses to the
TLR9 ligand CpG but not the TLR4 ligand LPS (Bonham et al.,
2014).
Importantly, the selective impairment of IFN-g but not TLR
signaling in S200L macrophages meant that the reduced phag-
osomal maturation and bacterial killing in macrophages with
the L allele and the increased bacterial burden and increased in-
flammatory response seen in homozygote S200L mice could be
the result of aberrant IFN-g signaling associated with the S180L
SNP rather than the result of impairment in TLR signaling. The
increased inflammation seen in the homozygote mutant mice
might reflect the increase in bacterial burden in the homozygote
mice or might reflect a loss of IFN-g-mediated regulation of
neutrophil recruitment and inflammation (Mishra et al., 2013;
Nandi and Behar, 2011). The increase in bacterial burden and
inflammation is not as marked as the defect seen in mice entirely
deficient in IFN-g (Cooper et al., 1993; Flynn et al., 1993), but
could be consistent with a partial defect in IFN-g signaling.
Macrophage in vitro assays and assessment of bacterial
burden and inflammation following infection demonstrated a
disadvantage for homozygote mutants, whereas serial weights
demonstrated increased severity of disease in both WT and
mutant homozygote individuals. A number of publications on
the S180L SNP and TB susceptibility in humans have reported
a heterozygote advantage and/or increased susceptibility in
mutant homozygotes. A heterozygote advantage in vivo has
also been reported for a SNP in leukotriene A4 hydrolase
(LTA4), with impaired in vitro responses seen in homozygotes
for the mutation. This effect has been attributed to the effect of
the SNP on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production
and cell necrosis (Roca and Ramakrishnan, 2013). As we face
an era of drug-resistant tuberculosis, improved understanding
of common mutations, which affect inflammatory responses to
pathogens such as Mal S180L, might guide us to improved use
of immunomodulatory treatment. Tobin and colleagues have
highlighted the potential of using LTA4H host genotypes to guide
choice of treatment for tuberculosis: individuals with tuberculous
meningitis with a LTA4 genotype associated with an excessive
inflammatory response benefited from adjunctive immunomodu-
latory steroid treatment, whereas this was harmful in those with a
LTA4 genotype associated with an inadequate inflammatory
response (Tobin et al., 2012). It is tempting to speculate that
the Mal S180L genotype could be used to inform treatment de-
cisions in a similar manner.
The S180L SNP in Mal has been reported to be associated
with altered susceptibility to not only mycobacterial disease,
but also to other infectious diseases including pneumococcal
disease, malaria, and Chaga’s disease. IFN-g signaling also
plays an important role in immune responses to these patho-
gens. Hitherto, the association of systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE) with S180L has been unexplained. TLR2 and TLR4 are not
thought to play an important role in SLE (Kim et al., 2009),
although TLR 9 has been implicated (Yang et al., 2012). Our
data suggest that the increased susceptibility to SLE associated
with S180L might be due to defects in the Mal-dependent IFN-g
signaling pathway rather than alterations in TLR2 and 4 signaling
(Pollard et al., 2013).
Indeed, IFN-g has a critical role in immunity, including promot-
ing differentiation of macrophages to a classically activated
phenotype (Martinez and Gordon, 2014). IFN-g plays a role
across a spectrum of non-infectious diseases including athero-
genesis, autoimmune diseases such as chronic atopic derma-
titis, and cancer (Feingold, 2014; Ikeda et al., 2002; Schroecks-
nadel et al., 2006). Given the frequency of the Mal S180L SNP, it
might be fruitful to assess whether the Mal-dependent IFN-g
signaling pathway plays a role in these diseases.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell Lines and Culture
Primary bone-marrow-derived macrophages were derived from the femurs of
Tirap�/�, Ifng�/�, and WT mice and differentiated for 7 days with medium con-
taining MCSF. THP-1 cells (ATCC) were transfected with siRNA against Mal
(Dharmacon) and scrambled control prior to being differentiated into macro-
phage-like cells with phorbol myristate acetate (100 nmol/L).
Assessment of Bacterial Growth
Macrophages were grown at 1 3 105 cells/ml in 12-well plates in antibiotic-
free RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. A suspension of Mtb
H37Rv was prepared as described in Supplemental Experimental Proce-
dures, and macrophages were infected with Mtb at a MOI of 10 bacteria/
macrophage. Extracellular bacteria were washed off at 3 hr post-infection.
Cells were lysed at the indicated time points and bacteria were harvested
and colonies were counted approximately 21 days later.
Phagosome Maturation Assays
Mtb H37Rv was labeled with FITC (1 mg/ml, Sigma). Bacteria were incubated
with cells for 1 hr prior to the addition of LysoTracker Red DND-99 (Invitrogen)
(100 nmol/L) for 1 hr prior to fixation. Alternatively, cells were fixed, permeabi-
lized, and with anti-CD63 /LAMP-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1 mg/mL) fol-
lowed by secondary antibody. Images were recorded on an Olympus FluoView
1000 and a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope.

 Autophagy Analysis
Autophagosome formation was measured by LC3 punctate staining using LC3
antibody (Invitrogen). Autophagic flux was inhibited using either bafilomycin
(100mM) or a combination of E64d and pepstatin.
Cytokine Measurements
Cytokine measurements were performed in supernatants using commercial
ELISA kits.
Co-Immunoprecipitation
HEK293 cells were incubated for 24 hr with DNA encoding various proteins in
the presence of Genejuice. Immunoprecipitation was initiated by incubation of
lysates for 2 hr with protein A/G sepharose beads (Amersham) plus control an-
tibodies. Precleared lysates were then incubated at 4�C for at least 2 hr with
various antibodies and protein G beads (Amersham) prior to separation by
SDS- PAGE and visualization with an enhanced chemiluminescence system
(Li-Cor).
Plasmids
HA-Mal has been previously described (Valkov et al., 2011). Site-directed
mutagensis was carried out to generate HA-tagged S180L variant Mal which
was amplified using Miniprep (QIAGEN). The sequences of both HA-Mal and
HA-S180L Mal were confirmed by seqencing (Eurofins).
Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy-Fluorescence
Resonance Energy Transfer
Macrophages were stained with primary antibodies against IFNGR2 (MyBio-
Source) and MyD88 (Abcam) and secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor A488
(donor) and A568 (acceptor) antibodies. An Olympus FV1000 microscope
equipped with a PicoHarp300 FLIM extension and a 485 nm pulsed laser diode
from PicoQuant was used to record FLIM data.
Genotyping
Mal genotype was determined on DNA extracted from buccal swabs (Isohelix,
Cell Product). Genotyping of the Mal S180L and polymorphism was performed
using the TaqMan Allelic Discrimination System (PE Biosystems).
FACS Analysis
Immortalized macrophages were stimulated, fixed, and stained with anti-
pSTAT1 (Y701) antibody conjugated to AlexaFluor 488 before analysis on a
BD FACSCanto II analyzer. For analysis of intracellular IFN-g production, mac-
rophages were infected Mtb H37Rv and then incubated with Brefeldin A. Cells
were permeabilized and stained with an anti-mouse IFN-g antibody (BD) or
isotype control.
Mice
Mal S200L heterozygote and homozygote mice (C57BL/6 background) were
generated as described in Figure S1. S200L mice were generated with
C57BL/6 embryonic stem cells and C57BL/6 blastocysts. Mice were age
and sex matched. Mice were infected with Mtb via aerosol (Martens et al.,
2012) at approximately 8 weeks of age.
Bacterial Load
At 8 weeks, mice were sacrificed. Lung homogenates from six mice were
plated to measure bacterial burden.
Lung Histology
Lungs were inflated, fixed, and stained (H&E). Lung surface area of inflamma-
tion was measured with a Nikon Eclipse E400. Percent total lung area involved
with inflammation was calculated by dividing the cumulative area of inflamma-
tion by the total lung surface area examined for each lung studied.
Lung Cytokine Expression
Lung lysates were assayed for TNF-a by ELISA (R&D Systems).
Statistical Analysis
A one-way ANOVA was performed to assess for statistically significant differ-
ence of the means between groups. Chi-square analysis was used to assess
statistically significant proportions of co-localization between groups. p
values < 0.05 were considered significant. Error bars represent SD of the
mean.
