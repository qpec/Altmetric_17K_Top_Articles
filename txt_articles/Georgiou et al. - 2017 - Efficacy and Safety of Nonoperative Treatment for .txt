abstract
CONTEXT: Nonoperative treatment (NOT) with antibiotics alone of acute uncomplicated 
appendicitis (AUA) in children has been proposed as an alternative to appendectomy.
OBJECTIVE: To determine safety and efficacy of NOT based on current literature.
DATA SOURCES: Three electronic databases.
STUDY SELECTION: All articles reporting NOT for AUA in children.
DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently verified study inclusion and extracted data.
RESULTS: Ten articles reporting 413 children receiving NOT were included. Six, including 1 
randomized controlled trial, compared NOT with appendectomy. The remaining 4 reported 
outcomes of children receiving NOT without a comparison group. NOT was effective as 
the initial treatment in 97% of children (95% confidence interval [CI] 96% to 99%). Initial 
length of hospital stay was shorter in children treated with appendectomy compared with 
NOT (mean difference 0.5 days [95% CI 0.2 to 0.8]; P = .002). At final reported follow-up 
(range 8 weeks to 4 years), NOT remained effective (no appendectomy performed) in 82% of 
children (95% CI 77% to 87%). Recurrent appendicitis occurred in 14% (95% CI 7% to 21%). 
Complications and total length of hospital stay during follow-up were similar for NOT and 
appendectomy. No serious adverse events related to NOT were reported.
LIMITATIONS: The lack of prospective randomized studies limits definitive conclusions to 
influence clinical practice.
CONCLUSIONS: Current data suggest that NOT is safe. It appears effective as initial treatment 
in 97% of children with AUA, and the rate of recurrent appendicitis is 14%. Longer-term 
clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of NOT compared with appendicectomy require 
further evaluation, preferably in large randomized trials, to reliably inform decision-making.

GEORGIOU et al 
Acute appendicitis is one of the 
most common general surgical 
emergencies worldwide, with an 
estimated lifetime risk between 
7% and 8%. 
1 The condition is of 
particular relevance to children 
because the peak in the incidence of 
appendicitis is in the second decade 
of life. 
1, 
 
2 Overall, acute appendicitis 
is diagnosed in 1% to 8% of children 
presenting to the emergency 
department with acute abdominal 
pain. 
3– 
5 The financial burden of 
treating appendicitis is huge.
The mainstay of treatment of acute 
appendicitis has been surgical 
ever since Fitz’s report over 130 
years ago 
6 before the discovery of 
antibiotics. Consequently tens of 
thousands of appendectomies are 
performed in children worldwide 
every year. However, in recent 
years, the dogma that surgery is 
required has been challenged, and 
there is growing literature to suggest 
that antibiotics without surgery 
may be an effective treatment of 
acute appendicitis in adults 
7 
– 
9 and 
more recently in children.10 
– 
12 
This nonoperative treatment 
(NOT) of acute appendicitis in 
children remains controversial and 
unproven at present due to a lack 
of randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs). 
13
NOT may be extremely appealing 
to some children and their families 
and may have benefits over 
appendectomy. Families of children 
with appendicitis frequently ask 
whether surgery is necessary or 
whether alternatives are available. 
Surgery requires general anesthesia, 
which, although a relatively safe 
intervention, clearly carries 
some risks. Appendectomy for 
uncomplicated appendicitis is 
generally considered a low-risk 
procedure, but complications 
after surgery occur in up to 7% 
of children. 
14, 
 
15 These risks of 
appendectomy should be balanced 
against the risk of recurrent 
appendicitis in a child who receives 
NOT. The aim of this review is to 
determine the efficacy and safety 
of NOT for acute uncomplicated 
appendicitis (AUA) in children in the 
reported literature.
METHODS
This study was conducted and 
reported in accordance with 
the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses guidelines for 
systematic reviews 
16 and was 
registered with the PROSPERO 
International prospective register 
of systematic reviews (registration 
CRD42015026994) on October 12, 
2015.
Systematic Review and Search 
Strategy
We performed a systematic review 
of the literature via an electronic 
search in Cochrane Central Register 
of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 
MEDLINE, and Embase in December 
2015 to find relevant articles. We 
used the following search terms: 
“nonoperative, 
” “non-operative, 
” 
“conservative, 
” “appendicitis, 
” “child, 
” 
“children.” Full details of the search 
strategy for Medline are available 
in the Supplemental Information. 
The search was limited to articles 
published in English. Study selection 
was performed independently by 2 
researchers with any disagreements 
resolved by a third. Studies that were 
unpublished or published in abstract 
form only were excluded at screening 
stage. The online systematic review 
management program Covidence 
(www. 
covidence. 
org) was used to 
coordinate the screening and data 
collection process. The reference 
lists of included articles were also 
scrutinized for additional articles 
meeting selection criteria that may 
have been missed in our initial 
search.
Study Selection Criteria
Studies were selected according to 
the following predefined criteria:
1. types of studies: any study design 
reporting NOT of AUA in children;
2. types of participants: children 
(<18 years of age); and
3. exclusion criteria: studies that 
reported NOT as treatment of 
complicated appendicitis (such as 
perforated appendicitis, ruptured 
appendicitis, appendicitis with 
an abscess, or appendix mass), 
studies that included a mixed 
population of adults and children, 
or studies that reported NOT as 
treatment of acute appendicitis 
only in children with malignancy.
We therefore included all relevant 
articles that reported any NOT 
regimen for AUA in children with 
or without a comparative group 
of children undergoing surgical 
treatment.
Quality Assessment
RCTs
We used the Jadad Scale 
17 to assess 
the quality of the 1 RCT included in 
this review. This scale assesses risk of 
bias in RCTs and assigns a final score 
of 0 (highest risk of bias) to 5 (lowest).
Nonrandomized Studies
We used the methodological index for 
nonrandomized studies (MINORS) 
criteria to assess the quality of all 
eligible non-RCTs. 
18 MINORS is a 
validated tool designed to assess 
the methodological quality of non-
RCTs, whether comparative or 
noncomparative. It comprises 12 
items, the first 8 being specifically for 
noncomparative studies, with all 12 
items being relevant to comparative 
studies. The highest attainable score 
is 16 for noncomparative studies 
and 24 for comparative studies, with 
higher scores indicative of greater 
methodological quality.
Data Extraction
Data were extracted independently 
by 2 reviewers and differences 
resolved by consensus if necessary.

The primary outcome was the efficacy 
of NOT, defined as discharge from 
hospital without appendectomy 
during the initial hospital episode. 
Secondary outcomes were concern 
over the safety or adverse effects 
of NOT, complications (no further 
definition was applied other than as 
defined in the source article, but this 
outcome did not include recurrent 
appendicitis), long-term efficacy of 
NOT (defined as remaining without 
appendectomy at final reported 
follow-up), recurrent appendicitis 
(confirmed by histology or treated 
with a second course of NOT), and 
length of hospital stay (both during 
the initial admission and total hospital 
stay required during follow-up).
Statistical Analysis
We used a 1-sided meta-analysis 
to estimate the overall efficacy 
of NOT for acute appendicitis 
across all studies using a random 
effects model in Meta-Analyst 
(Tufts University, Medford, MA). 
Two-sided meta-analysis was used 
to compare outcomes between NOT 
and appendectomy in comparative 
studies by using random-effects 
models in Review Manager (v5.3, 
Cochrane Collaboration). Estimates 
of weighted mean difference for 
continuous variables (inverse 
variance method) and risk difference 
for categorical variables (Mantel-
Haenszel method) with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) were 
generated. Proportions with adjusted 
95% CIs were generated for 1-sided 
meta-analyses.
RESULTS
Search Results and Study Selection
 
Figure 1 summarizes the results of 
the search and selection of articles. 
Eleven studies met the selection 
criteria. One of these 
19 was excluded 
because it reported interim results 
of a study that were subsequently 
reported in greater detail, and 
the latter report was included. 
10 
Therefore, 10 studies were included 
in the final quantitative analysis 
( 
Table 1).
Study Characteristics
Among the 10 studies included, 
7 were prospective and 3 were 
retrospective. Six studies compared 
children treated with either NOT or 
appendectomy, and the remaining 
4 reported outcomes of children 
receiving NOT without a comparison 
group. Outcomes of 766 children, 
of whom 413 were initially treated 
with NOT, were included. There 
was just 1 RCT, 
 
11 which was a pilot 
RCT designed to inform a future 
larger efficacy study. As such it was 
not powered to provide definitive 
evidence of the efficacy of NOT 
versus appendectomy.
Study characteristics varied in 
terms of (1) the techniques used to 
diagnose AUA, (2) antibiotic regimen 
used as NOT ( 
Table 2), and (3) the 
criteria used to select children for 
each treatment group. All studies 
used ultrasound in addition to 
clinical and laboratory parameters to 
confirm a diagnosis of AUA in most, if 
not all, children, with many also using 
either computed tomography or MRI. 
In terms of allocation to NOT, the 
RCT by Svensson et al 
11 was the only 
study to randomly allocate children 
to treatment group. Of the other 
studies, 4 used NOT routinely in 
all patients meeting inclusion 
criteria, 
 
12, 
 
20, 
23, 
 
25 whereas the 
remaining 5 studies all discussed 
both NOT and appendectomy and 
allowed parents to make a choice 
either as part of a prospective 
evaluation of NOT 
10, 
 
21, 
 
22, 
27 or as part 
of routine practice. 
24
The methodological quality of the 
studies is summarized in  
Table 1. 
The single RCT had a Jadad score of 
3 of 5 with 2 points deducted for a 
lack of blinding. The median MINORS 
score for comparative studies was 
16 of 24 (range 13–22) and for 
noncomparative studies 10 of 16 
(7–12).

Safety and Initial Effi
 cacy of NOT
Four hundred and thirteen children 
were either randomized to or 
selected for NOT. No study reported 
any adverse events related to NOT 
or concern over the safety of NOT 
in children who underwent this 
course of treatment. Overall, NOT 
was successful as initial treatment 
in 97% (95% CI 95.5% to 98.7%) 
of children during the initial 
hospital episode ( 
Fig 2). 
Heterogeneity was low for this 
outcome measure (I2 = 0%, P = .7). 
NOT was unsuccessful as initial 
treatment in 17 of 413 children, all 
of whom underwent appendectomy 
during their initial hospital 
admission.
Recurrent Appendicitis and Long-
term Effi
 cacy of NOT
Duration of follow-up varied 
between included studies ( 
Table 
1). Sixty-eight children of the 396 
who had initial successful NOT 
were diagnosed with recurrent 
appendicitis during the follow-up 
period. This includes 19 children 
from 2 studies that were offered 
a second course of NOT for 
recurrence. 
24, 
 
27 The remaining 49 
of these 68 children underwent 
appendectomy for recurrent 
acute appendicitis, and all had 
histologically confirmed recurrence. 
The adjusted incidence of recurrent 
appendicitis is 14% (95% CI 7% to 
21%;  
Fig 3); however, there was 
marked heterogeneity between 
these studies (I2 = 80%, P < .001).
During the reported follow-up period, 
an additional 11 who had successful 
initial NOT underwent appendectomy 
for a variety of reasons including 
recurrent acute appendicitis, ongoing 
abdominal pain, and parental 
choice. The long-term efficacy of 
NOT, defined as those children who 
have not had appendectomy at final 
reported follow-up, was 82% (95% 
CI 77% to 87%;  
Fig 4), with low 
heterogeneity between these studies 
(I2 = 34%, P = .14).
Comparative Outcomes of NOT and 
Appendectomy
Six of the 10 included studies 
compared NOT with appendectomy. 
These studies report outcomes in 
658 children of whom 305 (46%) 
received NOT and 353 (54%) 
primary appendectomy. Duration of 
initial hospital stay was reported in 4 
studies (340 children) 
10 
– 
12, 
 
27 and was 
shorter by a mean of 0.5 days (95% 
CI 0.2 to 0.8) in children undergoing 
appendectomy than those treated 
with NOT (Fig 5). Total length 
of hospital stay at final reported 
follow-up, including for readmissions, 
was reported in just 2 studies. 
12, 
 
24 
This outcome includes hospital 
admission for any complication 
related to disease or primary 
treatment including, for example, 
recurrence of appendicitis in children 
who had initially had NOT. Mean 
duration of follow-up in these 2 
studies was 5.3 months 
12 and 54 
months. 
24 Total duration of hospital 
stay including during follow-up was 
similar between children treated 
initially with NOT and appendectomy 
(weighted mean difference 1.1 days, 
95% CI –1.2 to 3.5; P = .34; Fig 6) 
although heterogeneity between 
these 2 studies was high (I2 = 93%, 
P = .0002). Total complications were 
reported in 5 of the 6 comparative 
studies ( 
Table 3 and  
Fig 7). Risk of 
complications was similar between 
children treated with either NOT or 
appendectomy (risk difference 2%, 
95% CI 0% to 5%; P = .1) with low 
heterogeneity (I2 = 0%, P = .47).
DISCUSSION
We have systematically reviewed 
the existing literature reporting 
NOT of AUA in children and 
included 10 studies reporting 413 
children treated with NOT. Given 
the frequency of acute appendicitis 
in the pediatric population, this 
suggests that NOT as a treatment 
modality remains in its infancy and 
is yet to become “mainstream.” The 
included studies were all published

in the past 10 years and are mainly 
cohort studies with or without a 
comparative group of children who 
were treated with appendectomy. 
Of note none originated from the 
United Kingdom. The lack of large 
high-quality RCTs and prospective 
evaluations confirms that NOT 
is a treatment yet to be formally 
evaluated in children.
Importantly, we have not identified 
any evidence to suggest that NOT 
is an unsafe treatment of children 
with AUA. No study reported any 
safety concern related to the use 
of NOT, and no study reported any 
specific adverse events related 
to NOT. No studies reported 
perforated appendicitis after NOT. 
Complications after appendectomy 
are rare, as are complications after 
NOT. To compare the risk of these 
rare events, it was decided a priori 
to use risk difference as an outcome 
measure, because this allows studies 
with no events in either arm to 
meaningfully contribute to the meta-
analysis. 
26 The data also suggest that 
in children with AUA, NOT is highly 
effective; 97% of children were

successfully discharged from their 
initial hospital admission after NOT. 
Together, these 2 facts support the 
further prospective evaluation of 
NOT compared with appendectomy 
in this population of children.
As may be anticipated, the long-term 
efficacy of NOT (as we have defined 
it) is lower than this initial 97%. 
During the follow-up reported, it is 
82%. Although we have not formally 
analyzed it, we noted a tendency 
for long-term efficacy to be lower 
in studies with longer duration of 
follow-up. Although some surgeons 
may feel that this demonstrates 
inferiority of NOT to appendectomy, 
a long-term efficacy of 82% still 
equates to 4 of every 5 children not 
having had surgery (and general 
anesthesia).
When compared with the adult 
literature, the data synthesized here 
suggest that antibiotic treatment 
of acute appendicitis is at least as 
effective in children as in adults. 
The most recent systematic 
review of adult RCTs found that 
antibiotics were initially effective 
in 84%, and of these 79% had no 
further problem during 1 year of 
follow-up. 
28 It is possible that the 
higher efficacy we have identified in 
the pediatric population is in part 
due to study design and in particular 
to differing selection criteria 
between pediatric observational 
studies and adult RCTs. In a recent 
adult observational study, success 
rate of NOT was 88% at 7 days and 
83% at 1 year. 
29
Although it is tempting to draw 
conclusions regarding comparative 
efficacy from our comparative 
analysis of NOT and appendectomy, 
we consider that to do so would be 
misleading because of the nature of 
the underlying studies. We believe 
the best use of these data is to 
act as justification for the future 
investigation of NOT and to guide 
sample size calculations in such 
studies where appropriate. The lack 
of major differences in outcomes 
between NOT and appendectomy and 
apparent safety of NOT is consistent 
with there being equipoise between 
these treatment modalities, this being 
a prerequisite for any RCT. The only 
statistically significant difference 
in our comparative analysis was a 
shorter duration of initial hospital 
stay in children undergoing 
appendectomy compared with those 
treated with NOT. A similar finding 
is reported in adult RCTs. 
28 We note 
that the majority of these early-phase 
studies evaluating NOT prescribed 
a minimum duration of antibiotics 
and/or hospital stay before initial 
hospital discharge that may have 
influenced this outcome. This and 
other limitations (discussed next) of 
study design, heterogeneity between 
studies, and methodology prevent 
more robust conclusions.
There are limitations of this study 
and the source data that should be 
appreciated when considering how 
to apply the data synthesized here 
to clinical practice and research. 
These include the inclusion of data 
from retrospective studies, those 
from noncomparative studies, and 
those from nonrandomized studies. 
All these features increase the 
possibility that bias, from a number 
of possible sources, has influenced 
our results. We therefore caution 
against the use of these data as 
definitive comparative evidence and 
await future randomized studies. 
We also acknowledge differences 
in selection criteria, diagnostic 
techniques, and antibiotic regimes 
between studies in children treated 
with NOT. Accordingly, we have used 
a random effects model for all meta-
analyses. Despite these differences 
between studies there was minimal 
heterogeneity between the outcomes 
of short- and long-term efficacy of 
NOT ( 
Figs 2 and  
4). However, for the 
outcome of recurrent appendicitis, 
there was significant heterogeneity 
between studies related, we suspect 
in part, to duration of follow-up ( 
Fig 
3). Future studies should ensure 
adequate duration and completeness 
of follow-up for the detection of 
recurrence. Although the time span 
during which recurrent appendicitis 
may occur is clearly much longer in 
children than in adults, a minimum 
of 1 year for all participants would 
seem appropriate and feasible in a 
research context.
A number of outcomes that are 
notably missing in the existing 
literature are important when 
considering the role of NOT and 
appendectomy in the treatment of 
acute appendicitis in children. These

include cost, cost-effectiveness, 
and patient and family quality of 
life. Future prospective research 
should include a comparison of 
these outcomes to enable a wider 
comparison not just at the level of the 
individual patient but for the health 
care system and society as a whole.
Although we have used initial 
discharge from hospital as the 
primary outcome for our study, 
we acknowledge that the overall 
decision of which treatment strategy 
to use may be based on more than 
this alone. It is quite likely that 
treatment decisions will be based on 
a combination of several outcomes 
including initial efficacy of treatment, 
incidence of complications, rate of 
recurrent appendicitis, and possibly 
incidence of negative appendectomy. 
Future studies should ensure 
adequate reporting of all these 
outcomes. Further work is underway 
to determine which of these 
outcomes should be included in the 
development of a Core Outcome Set 
for appendicitis in children.

This study has provided a 
comprehensive review of the existing 
literature pertaining to NOT for AUA 
in children. As far as we are aware, it 
is the first such review to synthesize 
data specifically from children. 
The study highlights the lack of 
robust evidence comparing NOT 
with appendectomy in children but 
provides data that support and justify 
ongoing and future endeavors 
31, 
 
32 to 
assimilate such evidence so that we 
can best serve the huge number of 
children who develop appendicitis 
every year. This review also confirms 
a position of equipoise between 
treatment approaches in such trials. 
Until such studies are completed, 
we would recommend that NOT 
of children with AUA be reserved 
for those participating in carefully 
designed research studies.
