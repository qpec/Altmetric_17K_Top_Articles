SUMMARY
Genetically modified T cells expressing chimeric
antigen receptors (CARs) demonstrate robust re-
sponses against lineage restricted, non-essential
targets in hematologic cancers. However, in solid
tumors, the full potential of CAR T cell therapy is
limited by the availability of cell surface antigens
with sufficient cancer-specific expression. The ma-
jority of CAR targets have been normal self-antigens
on dispensable hematopoietic tissues or overex-
pressed shared antigens. Here, we established that
abnormal self-antigens can serve as targets for tu-
mor rejection. We developed a CAR that recognized
cancer-associated Tn glycoform of MUC1, a neoanti-
gen expressed in a variety of cancers. Anti-Tn-MUC1
CAR T cells demonstrated target-specific cytotox-
icity and successfully controlled tumor growth in
xenograft models of T cell leukemia and pancreatic
cancer. These findings demonstrate the therapeutic
efficacy of CAR T cells directed against Tn-MUC1
and present aberrantly glycosylated antigens as a
novel class of targets for tumor therapy with engi-
neered T cells.
INTRODUCTION
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapies have emerged as a
potent new tool for hematologic malignancies (Brentjens et al.,
2013; Grupp et al., 2013; Kalos et al., 2011; Kochenderfer
et al., 2010; Porter et al., 2011). The major scientific issue facing
the field with engineered T cells is whether this technology can
be applied to solid tumors (June et al., 2015). To date, CARs
have mostly targeted shared antigens found on nonessential
tissues, such as CD19 on B lymphocytes. However, epithelial
malignancies mostly exist within essential tissues and most
epithelial tumor-associated antigens are shared proteins also
found less abundantly in normal tissues. Although these shared
proteins are overexpressed in malignancy, the immune system is
tolerant to them because of thymic deletion and other post-
thymic mechanisms. In addition, CAR and T cell receptor
(TCR) therapies developed against these shared proteins have
been met with serious adverse events. For example, when a
CAR targeting her2/neu was tested, the patient died from cardio-
pulmonary toxicity within days (Morgan et al., 2010). In contrast,
vaccines to her2/neu have been given to patients with a high
degree of safety (Emens et al., 2009), and millions of patients
have been treated with passive transfer therapy with trastuzu-
mab with a favorable safety profile. The explanation for the differ-
ential toxicity between adoptive cell therapy and vaccines and
antibody therapy is likely that the CAR T cells are simply more
potent.
One well-characterized cellular process involved in differential
processing following malignant transformation is protein glyco-
sylation. Glycosylation also has a role in regulating immune
tolerance, as reviewed (Rabinovich and Croci, 2012). Protein
glycosylation is initiated with the covalent linkage of glycans to
asparagine residues (N-linked) or serine (Ser) or threonine (Thr)
residues (O-linked). Here, we focus on O-linked glycosylation,
which is initiated with the addition of N-Acetylgalactosamine
(GalNAc) to Ser or Thr residues by approximately 20 human poly-
peptide GalNAc-transferases (GalNAc-Ts) (Bennett et al., 2012).
In normal cells GalNAc residues attached to the protein back-
bone are further elongated by the T synthase to form the Core 1
structure (Gal-GalNAc-a-Ser/Thr) (Ju et al., 2002). The Core 1
synthase, C1Gal-T1, requires the chaperone protein, Cosmc, to
prevent rapid degradation (Ju and Cummings, 2002).
Changes in cell surface glycosylation have been shown to in-
crease tumorigenesis and metastasis (Ohtsubo and Marth, 2006;
1444

 Ren et al., 2014; Tamura et al., 2014; Tarp and Clausen, 2008;
Taylor-Papadimitriou et al., 1999). The most prevalent aberrant
glycoforms found in cancer are the Tn (GalNAca1-O-Ser/Thr)
and sialyl-Tn (STn) (NeuAca2-6-GalNAca1-O-Ser/Thr) glyco-
forms (Springer, 1984). Several mechanisms might result in
accumulation of Tn glycoforms, including loss of T synthase ac-
tivity (Ju et al., 2002) due to mutations or epigenetic silencing of
COSMC and ectopic expression of GalNAc-Ts (Gill et al., 2013;
Ju et al., 2008; Radhakrishnan et al., 2014; Schietinger et al.,
2006). Somatic mutation of COSMC can lead to loss of tolerance
in the bone marrow lineage with resultant hemolytic anemia and
IgA nephrophathy (Berger, 1999; Ju and Cummings, 2005). Hyp-
oxic conditions often found in tumors might alter expression of
glycosyltransferases (Kannagi et al., 2010), including sialyltrans-
ferases such as ST6GalNAcI to create sialyl-Tn antigens. Glyco-
sylation changes also alter cell adhesion and motility, which
increase the metastatic potential of the tumor cell (Gill et al.,
2013; Radhakrishnan et al., 2014; Ren et al., 2014; Tamura
et al., 2014). Tn and STn antigen expression is correlated with
adverse outcome and decreased patient survival in breast can-
cer, gastric cancer, endometrial cancer, and oral squamous
cell carcinoma, among other cancers (Cazet et al., 2010; Itzko-
witz, 2003; Lin et al., 2014; Ohno et al., 2006; Victorzon et al.,
1996). Aberrant expression of Tn and STn glycoforms have in
particular been found on the cell membrane mucin MUC1, which
is a large protein with tandem repeated sequences carrying
O-glycans overexpressed in most adenocarcinomas (Finn
et al., 2011; Graham et al., 1996; Tarp and Clausen, 2008; Tay-
lor-Papadimitriou et al., 1999). In health, the Tn antigen is not
expressed and humans have natural anti-Tn IgM antibodies.
However, exposure of Tn in cancer cells might lead to loss of
immunological tolerance to Tn-glycopeptide epitopes, induction
of IgG antibodies (Ju et al., 2008; Schietinger et al., 2006; Wan-
dall et al., 2010) and immunopathology (Berger, 1999; Ju and
Cummings, 2005).
We previously demonstrated that it is safe to elicit IgG anti-
bodies to the Tn-MUC1 epitope recognized by 5E5 using a
glycopeptide vaccine (Sabbatini et al., 2007) and we docu-
mented the existence of spontaneous IgG antibodies to this in
some cancer patients (Wandall et al., 2010). Here, we develop
and characterize a novel CAR based on a monoclonal antibody
(5E5) specific to a Tn-MUC1 glycopeptide epitope widely ex-
pressed by adenocarcinomas (Sørensen et al., 2006; Tarp
et al., 2007). This CAR is able to eliminate Tn-MUC1-expressing
tumors in mouse models of leukemia and pancreatic cancer. We
propose that cancer-specific neoepitopes formed by aberrant
glycosylation might serve as targets for CAR T cell therapy
for a variety of adenocarcinomas and bone-marrow-derived
cancers.
RESULTS
Jurkat T Cell Leukemia Contains Mutations in COSMC
and Expresses Tn Antigen Epitopes
Previous work has shown that the Jurkat T cell leukemia line con-
tains a one base nucleotide deletion that results in a frameshift
and early truncation of the T synthase chaperone protein,
COSMC, responsible for preventing rapid degradation of the T
synthase (Ju and Cummings, 2002). We also identified an alanine
(A) to valine (V) substitution (nucleotide C428T) in our Jurkat E6-1
line of unknown effect on gene function that was not previously
reported (Figure S1A). Using an in vitro fluorescence assay to
measure T synthase activity, we detected negligible enzymatic
activity in Jurkat cell extracts, compared with robust activity
in 293T cell extracts (Figure S1B). These results confirm the
COSMC truncation in Jurkat leukemia cells is correlated with
the activity of T synthase.
We performed flow cytometric analysis of the Jurkat cell line
immunostained with two characterized Tn antigen-specific anti-
bodies, 5E5 and BaGs3 (Figure S1C). 5E5 mAb was developed
and characterized for its specificity to the Tn/STn glycopeptide
epitope on MUC1 (Sørensen et al., 2006). BaGs3 is an anti-Tn
mAb (Borgert et al., 2012). Both 5E5 and BaGs3 mAbs demon-
strated staining on the surface of Jurkat cells, indicating broad
aberrant O- glycosylation of proteins in these cells.
5E5 Exhibits High Affinity for Tn-MUC1
The specificity of antibodies used to construct chimeric antigen
receptors is critical because any cross-reactivity to cell surface
proteins on normal tissues can be toxic as a T cell therapy.
Thus, we evaluated the specificity of the 5E5 mAb and CAR
in vitro with a 60-mer non-glycosylated MUC1 peptide (MUC1-
60-mer) and corresponding Tn-glycopeptide (MUC1-9Tn) as
well as a control mucin, sheep-derived submaxillary mucin
(OSM). The OSM mucin is heavily glycosylated with STn O-gly-
cans and serves as a general STn hapten antigen recognized
by most anti-STn antibodies.
Neuraminidase treated Asialo-OSM (aOSM) serves as a gen-
eral Tn hapten. Using previously described antibodies to the T,
Tn, and STn carbohydrate haptens 3C9, 5F4, and 3F1 mAbs,
respectively (Madsen et al., 2013; Radhakrishnan et al., 2014),
we confirmed by ELISA that none of the antigens contained
Core 1 structure (Figure 1A, top left panel). MUC1-9Tn and
aOSM both contain Tn antigen (Figure 1A, top right panel), and
OSM contains STn antigen (Figure 1A, bottom left panel). The un-
glycosylated MUC1-60-mer peptide was not recognized by any
of these antibodies. The 3F1 antibody demonstrated low-level
binding to aOSM peptide at higher concentrations, suggesting
that the peptide contained some residual sialyation. The 5E5
mAb displayed high affinity for the MUC1-9Tn peptide and no
reactivity against the non-glycosylated MUC1-60-mer peptide
(Figure 1A, bottom right panel), indicating that the antibody de-
tects the Tn-MUC1 glycopeptide specific epitope without reac-
tivity with the unglycosylated peptide backbone. 5E5 does
weakly react with the Tn hapten at high density on aOSM (Søren-
sen et al., 2006), and due to the high affinity of the 5E5 mAb, we
titrated the glycopeptides to 233fg/mL in order to identify a
decrease in antibody binding (Figure 1A, bottom right panel).
We observed low-level binding of 5E5 mAb to aOSM compared
with the MUC1-9Tn, which is in striking contrast to the reactivity
of the 5F4 mab to the Tn hapten.
We next characterized the binding of the 5E5 mab and
scFv to normal human tissues and cancer. Immunostaining
of normal human tissues with 5E5 mAb demonstrates no bind-
ing to most tissues, including tonsil, lymph node, prostate,
adrenal, liver, heart, breast, spinal cord, cerebellum, cervix,
testes, thyroid, endometrium, thymus, muscle, colon, esoph-
agus, parathyroid, placenta, spleen, and adipose (Figure S2A).

 In contrast, the tissue microarray for stomach, lung, pancreas,
and kidney did stain with 5E5 mAb. However, with confocal
microscopy, the 5E5 staining pattern was found to be largely
intracellular and colocalized with a marker of the cis-Golgi
network, GM130, in contrast to normal MUC1 expression,
stained with HMFG1 mAb, which localizes at the membrane
and often colocalizes with EpCAM staining (Figure S2C). In
contrast to normal human tissue, 5E5 mAb has intense bind-
ing to the plasma membranes of human breast cancer and
colocalizes with EpCAM staining (Figure S2B). These results
provide support for cancer-specific expression of Tn-MUC1
and further demonstrate that there is virtually non-existent
expression of this epitope on the cellular surface of normal
tissues.
We next synthesized the variable heavy and variable light
chains of the 5E5 mAb, linked with a 3X(GGGGS) spacer and
incorporated the single chain variable fragment (scFv) into a
CAR backbone containing a CD8a hinge and transmembrane
domain, a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain and a CD3zeta activa-
tion domain (Figure 1B). The same structural backbone of the
5E5 CAR was used for the CD19 targeting CAR used for leuke-
mia (Imai et al., 2004; Milone et al., 2009), which has demon-
strated robust clinical activity in patients with leukemia (Maude
et al., 2014). Normal human donor T cells were stimulated with
anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAb-coated magnetic beads and
transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding either CD19 CAR
or 5E5 CAR (Figure S3A, S3B). CAR T cells were plated on
OSM, aOSM, MUC1-60-mer, or MUC1-9Tn peptide-coated
plates for 24 hr and the culture media was assessed for the
cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-g) (Fig-
ure 1C). One mg/mL of anti-CD3ε mAb, OKT3, was used as a
positive control for T cell stimulation. 5E5 CAR T cells secreted
high quantities of IL-2 and IFN-g in response to MUC1-9Tn but
not the non-glysosylated Muc1-60-mer. IFN-g secretion was
also observed from 5E5 CAR T cells in response to aOSM
peptide, which expresses Tn antigen on the sheep mucin, sug-
gesting that while 5E5 CAR demonstrates a high affinity for Tn-
MUC1, it might also demonstrate low level recognition for Tn

 antigen on other mucin-like glycoproteins, consistent with Fig-
ure 1A. In contrast, CD19 CAR T cells demonstrated no reactivity
to any of the peptides but showed similar cytokine secretion
in response to OKT3 stimulation, compared with 5E5 CAR
T cells, which specifically produced cytokines in response to
Tn-MUC1.
Similar to CD19 CAR T cells, 5E5 CAR T cells demonstrated no
reactivity against normal human primary cardiac, aortic and
pulmonary myocytes, renal epithelial cells, pulmonary endothe-
lial cells, or osteoblasts in chromium release assays (Figure 2),
while 5E5 CAR T cells and CD19 CAR T cells lysed positive con-
trols Jurkat E6-1 and Jurkat 19COSMC cells, respectively. In
contrast, a CAR that demonstrates normal tissue toxicity,
MC813-70, demonstrated lysis of all evaluated normal primary
cells.
5E5 CAR T Cells Induce Anti-Tumor Responses
CD19-specific CD19 CAR T cells or Tn-MUC1-specific 5E5 CAR
T cells were cultured overnight with K562 leukemia cell line,
Jurkat leukemia cell line, or NNP4 primary ovarian cancer cells
collected from a malignant pleural effusion, and analyzed for
intracellular cytokine production and degranulation via flow cy-
tometry (Figure 3A). While 5E5 CAR T cells exhibited no cytokine
production over background controls in the absence of target,
they did respond to K562 cells, Jurkat cells and NNP4 cells.
CD19 CAR T cells did not react to any of the tumor cell lines, indi-
cating low levels of alloreactivity under these conditions.
Jurkat cells were then transduced with lentiviral vector encod-
ing GFP and Click Beetle Green (CBG) luciferase, connected by a
T2A signal peptide (GFP-T2A-CBG), for bioluminescence as-
says. Normal donor T cells, transduced with 5E5 CAR, CD19
CAR, or not transduced, were cultured with the luminescent
Jurkat cells overnight at effector-to-target (E:T) ratios of 0.1:1 to
3:1 and the remaining luminescence was measured. 5E5 CAR
T cells exhibited potent cytotoxicity against Jurkat cells at all
E:T ratios, in contrast with non-transduced controls (Figure 3B).
A xenograft model of T cell leukemia was established in im-
mune-compromised NOD-SCID-Gamma (NSG) mice by intrave-
nously injecting 5 3 106 Jurkat GFP-T2A-CBG cells. When the
mean bioluminescence of tumors reached �5 3 107 photons/
second 8 days after tumor injection, mice were injected intrave-
nously with non-transduced normal human donor T cells, CD19
CAR T cells, or 5E5 CAR T cells, where all cell populations
were 50% CD4 and 50% CD8, and, in transduced groups
(CD19 and 5E5), CD4+ T cells were 60% CAR+ and CD8+
T cells were 25% CAR+. Treated mice were imaged weekly for
tumor bioluminescence until all control mice had reached
pre-approved IACUC morbidity endpoints (Figure S4A). Median
survival of mice treated with non-transduced and CD19 CAR
T cells was 42 and 37.5 days, respectively, with all control-
treated mice dead within 36 days post T cell infusion. In contrast,
mice treated with 5E5 CAR T cells had a dose dependent in-
crease in median survival of 63 and 94 days. 5E5 CAR T cell
treated mice demonstrated a reduction in tumor growth over
all other groups throughout the experiment (Figure 3C). Mice
treated with 5E5 CAR T cells at either dose also demonstrated
significantly increased survival over all control mice (Figure 3D)
(p = 0.0014). As far as we are aware, these are the first results
showing control of Jurkat leukemia cells by adoptive transfer,
although others have shown in vitro antitumor effects (Katsuhara
et al., 2015).
Rescue of COSMC in Jurkat Cells Abolishes Recognition
by 5E5 CAR T Cells
To restore COSMC function, Jurkat GFP-T2A-CBG cells were
transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding COSMC and CD19
lacking the intracellular domain (CD19t), as a selection marker,
separated by a P2A signal peptide (CD19t-P2A-COSMC), and
sorted for CD19 expression. Following restoration of COSMC,
the isogenic Jurkat cells no longer stained positive with 5E5
mAb, suggesting that the MUC1-Tn antigen is no longer exposed
(Figure 4A and Figure S5A). In addition, a reduction in aGalNAc
(Tn) residues on the surface was observed, as measured by Vicia
Villosa lectin (VVA) binding (Figure S5B). The T synthase assay
showed enzyme activity in COSMC-restored Jurkat cell extracts
was similar to the high T synthase activity observed in 293T cell
Figure 2. Evaluation of 5E5 CAR T Cells Reactivity to a Panel of Human Primary Cells
5E5 and CD19 CAR T cells were tested in a chromium release lysis assays at effector:target ratios of 1:1 to 30:1. MC813-70 CAR T cells known to exhibit normal
tissue toxicity were used as a positive control. In addition the various CAR T cells were tested on wild-type Jurkat and Jurkat with reconstituted COSMC.
Statistical comparisons are between 5E5 CAR and CD19 CAR in the positive controls Jurkat E6-1 and Jurkat 19COSMC. All other comparisons are made
between MC813-70 and 5E5. ** = p < 0.01, *** = p < 0.001, **** = p < 0.0001.

 extracts (Figure 4B), demonstrating that COSMC expression
also restored T synthase activity to the Jurkat CD19t-P2A-
COSMC cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that
reconstitution of COSMC expression in Jurkat cells restores T
synthase activity and eliminates the aberrantly glycosylated
Tn-MUC1 antigen that 5E5 mAb recognizes.
An in vitro cytotoxicity assay of the isogenic Jurkat cells
cultured with non-transduced, CD19 CAR, or 5E5 CAR-trans-
duced T cells demonstrated that 5E5 CAR T cells do not
exhibit cytotoxicity against Jurkat cells with restored T synthase
activity (Figure 4C). However, CD19 CAR T cells were able to lyse
the Jurkat CD19t-P2A-COSMC cells, demonstrating that the
COSMC restoration does not alter the resistance or susceptibil-
ity of Jurkat cells to cytolysis by CAR T cells. Complementary to
these single target experiments, 5E5 CAR T cells were able to
distinguish Tn-MUC1 positive Jurkat cells (E6-1) from Tn-
MUC1 negative Jurkat cells (CD19t-P2A-COSMC) within the
same well (Figure S5C), demonstrating that the antigen is not
transmitted to other cells by shedding or other means and sug-
gesting that CAR T cells directed against MUC1 might have
low bystander toxicity when differential O-glycosylation is
targeted.
Xenograft models using Jurkat and Jurkat CD19t-P2A-
COSMC cells also demonstrated that 5E5 CAR cytotoxicity is

 specific to defective O-linked glycosylation caused by COSMC-
deficiency. Mice receiving wild-type Jurkat (Tn-MUC1 positive)
cells and treated with 5E5 CAR T cells demonstrated increased
survival over control treated mice, and likewise, mice receiving
Jurkat CD19t-P2A-COSMC (Tn-MUC1 negative) cells treated
with CD19 CAR T cells also showed anti-tumor recognition and
increased survival over control treated groups (Figures 4D and
4E, Figure S4B). Immunohistochemical analysis of bone marrow,
spleen, pancreas, liver, and kidney from mice bearing no tumor,
Jurkat E6-1 tumor, or Jurkat CD19t-P2A-COSMC tumor re-
vealed that human T cells home to the bone marrow and spleen,
regardless of CAR or tumor, and 5E5 CAR T cells are not found
within murine normal tissue (Figure S4C). Importantly, 5E5 CAR
T cells had no effect on mice with COSMC-restored Jurkat
tumors and similarly for CD19 CAR T cells within mice bearing
Jurkat E6-1 tumors. These unresponsive treatment groups
showed an abundance of GFP+ Jurkat cells within the bone
marrow, highlighting the inability of the T cells to eradicate the
tumor in these cases.
5E5 CAR T Cells Recognize Multiple Different Cancers
5E5 CAR T cells, along with CD19 CAR T cells and non-trans-
duced T cells were cultured with a panel of human leukemia,
pancreatic, and breast cancer cell lines (Figure 5A). 5E5 CAR
T cells secreted IFN-g when cultured with two of the leukemia
lines tested, the pancreatic cancer cell lines Capan-2 and
Hs766T, and the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-453 and
MCF7. However, not all tumor cells tested stimulated 5E5 CAR
T cells, perhaps due to checkpoint expression or lack of antigen
expression. Panc1, for instance, does not express MUC1. The
O-glycophenotype of the cancer cell lines was interrogated
with immunostaining and quantitative PCR (Figures 5B and
5C). Staining by 5E5 mAb, 3F1 mAb, and VVA lectin, as well as
relative expression of ST6GalNAc1, necessary for formation of
STn antigen, correlated with stimulation of 5E5 CAR T cells.
The lack of response by the CD19 CAR T cells indicates that
the allogeneic effect was low under these conditions.

Tumor engrafted in many areas of the peritoneal cavity, including
in the mouse pancreas. Three weeks post tumor engraftment,
when the mean tumor bioluminescence reached approximately
�5 3 107 photons/second, mice were treated intravenously
with PBS or non-transduced T cells, CD19 CAR or 5E5 CAR
T cells. The injected T cells were 50% CD4+ and 50% CD8+
and CD4+ T cells were 60% CAR+ and CD8 T cells were 25%
CAR+. The 5E5 CAR T cells had a potent antitumor effect as
mice treated with 5E5 CAR T cells survived or 113 days post
T cell infusion, at the termination of the experiment (Figure 6A,
6B, 6C). The 5E5 CAR treated mice had 100% survival,

with 5E5 mAb, 3F1 mAb, and VVA lectin and flow
cytometric analysis was performed. Representa-

are presented below each MFI plot. The DMFI was
calculated by adjusting for MFI of secondary
antibody stained cells and plotted accordingly.
Cell lines stained brightly for 5E5, 3F1, or VVA
lectin are likely to generate an immunostimulatory
reaction from 5E5 CAR T cells. A caveat to this
finding is the high VVA expression of Panc1 does
not correlate with Figure 5A, yet Panc1 is known to
not expression MUC1.
(C) Relative quantitative PCR was performed on
cDNA prepared from the cell lines evaluated in (A).
Expression of ST6GalNAc1 mRNA correlated with
cytokine secretion and reactivity of 5E5 CAR
T cells to these cell lines. Expression of C1GalT1
(T synthase) was also severely reduced in breast
cancer cell lines MDA-MB-453 and MCF7. T syn-
thase is necessary to convert O-linked Tn antigens
into Core 1 glycans. Also, low expression of
C1GalT1C1 (Cosmc) mRNA is observed in 5E5
CAR-stimulating leukemia and breast cancer cell
lines. Data are plotted as mean ± SEM.
compared with 40% and 33% survival
of mice treated with non-transduced
and CD19 CAR T cells, respectively
(p < 0.02). Immunohistochemical analysis
demonstrated that 5E5 CAR T cells accu-
mulate abundantly within the Hs766T tu-
mor, while only small quantities of CD19
CAR T cells are found within the tumor
(Figure 6D).
DISCUSSION
Our studies demonstrate that a CAR
targeting
a
common
tumor
aberrant
O-glycosylation site, the Tn and STn antigen on MUC1, is able
to specifically recognize multiple types of tumors in vitro, and
demonstrates anti-tumor efficacy in murine models of cancers
as diverse as leukemia and pancreatic cancer. A variety of exper-
imental approaches, including isogenic Jurkat cells, indicate that
the CAR is specific for the Tn-MUC1 epitope. Loss of COSMC
expression is common among malignancies, as demonstrated
in The Cancer Genome Atlas, with epigenetic silencing of
COSMC found more commonly than genomic mutations (Mi
et al., 2012; Radhakrishnan et al., 2014).
Perhaps the greatest challenge to the field of engineered T cell
therapy has been the identification of a ‘‘universal’’ CAR. We
1450
Immunity 44, 1444–1454, June 21, 2016
 found that the 5E5 CAR T cells recognized and exhibited cytotox-
icity against the Jurkat T cell leukemia cell line, the K562 myelog-
enous leukemia cell line, pancreatic cancer cell lines, and breast
cancer cell lines. The 5E5 mAb has also been reported to stain
multiple myeloma and ovarian cancer (Andrulis et al., 2014;
Cloosen et al., 2006; Van Elssen et al., 2010), suggesting that
the 5E5 CAR could have widespread use for a variety of cancers.
A previous study showed that the 237 CAR, which recognizes
a murine tumor-specific glycopeptide epitope (Schietinger et al.,
2006), mediated T cell lysis of Jurkat cells (Stone et al., 2012). In
that case, recognition was proposed to be due to expression of
the Tn antigen linked to a protein distinct from the original 237-
target antigen, a glycosylated peptide from the murine OTS8
protein. Importantly, normal primary T cells are COSMC-profi-
cient and therefore do not express Tn-MUC1 recognized by
the 5E5 mAb or CAR.
A previous CAR T cell trial targeting carboxy anhydrase IX, an
enzyme overexpressed in kidney cancer uncovered low-level
expression of the target in normal biliary tree, resulting in serious
liver toxicity (Lamers et al., 2013). We were unable to detect
expression of Tn-MUC1 epitope on primary cells from healthy
donors. While there was staining of some organs by the 5E5
mab in tissue microarrays, confocal microscopy indicates that
the staining is intracellular and colocalizes with the Golgi com-
plex. Whether small amounts of surface expression of the 5E5
epitope occurs in non-cancerous tissues is unknown and can
only be determined in a clinical trial.
The occurrence of an autoimmune syndrome upon somatic
loss of COSMC in hematopoietic stem cells further suggests
that the Tn epitope is not expressed in healthy adults, and is re-
assuring because the syndrome is rare (Berger, 1999). This com-
bined with the observations that Tn is often overexpressed in

 tumors suggest that targeting of Tn with CAR T cells has promise
for cancer therapy (Tarp and Clausen, 2008). The potential of
CAR T cells engineered to target aberrantly glycosylated can-
cer-specific proteins might provide a safer alternative than tar-
geting shared, overexpressed tumor antigens. In summary, our
results provide rationale for a clinical trial to target solid tumors
that express Tn-MUC1 with CAR T cells.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Vector Design
The cDNA sequence of the variable light and heavy chains (scFv) of the 5E5
mAb (Sørensen et al., 2006) were separated by a 3xGGGGS linker and
custom synthesized by GeneArt (Life Technologies). The scFv was cloned
into a CAR-encoding lentivirus backbone, containing the CD8a leader
sequence, a portion of the CD8a extracellular domain and transmembrane
domain, and 4-1BB and CD3zeta endodomains (5E5-41BB-CD3z) in the
pTRPE vector: a custom synthesized third generation lentiviral production
vector using the EF1a promoter based on the similar pELNS vector as previ-
ously described (Carpenito et al., 2009). The genomic DNA of Cosmc was
amplified from primary human T cells with a forward primer containing the
P2A sequence, and then cloned into pTRPE. cDNA of CD19, truncated after
the transmembrane domain as previously described (Milone et al., 2009),
was amplified and cloned into the pTRPE-P2A-cosmc vector to create
pTRPE-CD19t-P2A-COSMC.
T Cell Transduction and Expansion
Lentiviral supernatant was generated from 293T cells transfected with pTRPE-
5E5 scFv-41BB-CD3z, pELPS-anti-CD19-41BB-CD3z, or pELNS-SS1 scFv-
41BB-CD3z plasmids, plus gag/pol, env, and Vsvg as previously described
(Parry et al., 2003) and collected at 24 and 48 hr. Normal donor T cells were
positively selected from leukapheresis products using anti-CD4 and anti-
CD8 microbeads (Miltenyi), expanded in vitro with anti-CD3/CD28 magnetic
beads (Life Technologies), cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum (FCS), HEPES, penicillin and streptomycin (R10) and
100 IU/mL IL-2 for 10–17 days. T cells were transduced with lentiviral superna-
tant 16 hr after bead stimulation.
Cells
The Jurkat E6-1 and K562 cell lines were obtained from ATCC and maintained
in R10. The Capan-2, Panc-1, PL45, Hs766T, BT-20, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231,
and MDA-MB-453 cell lines were also obtained from ATCC and maintained
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin and streptomycin. NNP4 pri-
mary ovarian cancer cells were obtained for a pleural tap of an ovarian cancer
patient at the University of Chicago Hospitals. K562meso was generated
through transduction of K562 cell line with lentiviral supernatant containing
mesothelin cDNA expressed by the EF1a promoter. Luciferase-expressing
cell lines were generated through transduction of the parental cell line with len-
tiviral supernatant containing Click Beetle Green luciferase-T2A-GFP and
sorted for GFP expression on the BD Influx (BD Biosciences). Cell lines ex-
pressing COSMC were generated by transducing the parental cell lines with
lentiviral supernatant containing CD19t-P2A-cosmc and sorted on the BD
Influx for expression of CD19.
Flow Cytometry
Anti-human antibodies were purchased from BioLegend, eBioscience, or
Becton Dickinson. The 5E5 mAb was developed as previously described (Sør-
ensen et al., 2006; Tarp et al., 2007). BaGs3 was a gift from Dr. Richard
Cummings at Emory University. For staining, cells were washed with phos-
phate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% FCS, and stained on ice. In all
analyses, singlets were gated on using FSC-H versus FSC-A and SSC-H
versus SSC-A, followed by gating based on forward versus side scatter char-
acteristics. Surface expression of CD19, SS1, and 5E5 CAR was detected by
staining with a biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse F(ab)2 antibody (Jackson
ImmunoResearch) and PE-conjugated streptavidin. Flow cytometry was per-
formed on a 4-laser LSRII or LSRFortessa (Becton Dickinson).
Cytotoxicity Assay
Cytotoxicity assays were performed using luciferase-expressing cell lines.
T cells were incubated with cancer cell lines at indicated effector-target ratios
for 16 hr. Cells were then washed once in PBS, lysed in luciferase cell culture
lysis reagent (Promega), and subsequently mixed with luciferase assay re-
agent (Promega). Luminescence of the lysates was analyzed using a plate
spectrophotometer. Specific lysis of each sample was calculated using the
luminescence of target cells alone, and Triton-X lysed target cells, correspond-
ing to 0% lysis and 100% lysis respectively.
Cytotoxicity of CAR T cells cultured with normal human primary cells was
evaluated in a 4 hr 51Cr release assay. One million target cells were labeled
with 51Cr (50 mCi) for 1 hr at 37�C. After labeling, 1 3 104 labeled target cells
were plated in each well of a 96-well plate and effector cells were added in a
volume of 100 ml at indicated E:T ratios. Cells were co- incubated for 4 hr at
37�C and 30 ml of supernatant was collected and transferred onto the filter
of a LumaPlate. Radioactivity on dried LumaPlate was measured using a
b-emission reading liquid scintillation counter and the percentage specific lysis
was determined as mentioned above.
Intracellular Cytokine Staining
Human T cells, CAR transduced or non-transduced, were co-cultured with
target cells (tumors, cell lines, or human primary cells) in a 1:1 ratio, at
2 3 106 cells/mL in 96-well round bottom tissue-culture plates at 37 degrees,
5% CO2 for 16 hr, in RPMI-1640 plus 10% FBS, in the presence of CD107a
mAb and golgi-inhibitors monensin and brefeldinA. Cells were washed,
stained with live/dead viability stain, followed by surface staining for CD3
and CD8, then fixed, permeabilized, and intracellularly stained for IFN-g,
TNF-a, IL-2, and GzmB. Cells were analyzed by 9-color flow cytometry (Beck-
ton Dickinson LSRFortessa), and gated on live, single-cell lymphocytes, and
CD3-positive lymphocytes.
Immunofluorescence Microscopy
Formalin fixed normal human kidney, normal human pancreas, and human
breast cancer were obtained from the Tumor Tissue and Biospecimen Bank
at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. The tissue was paraffin-
embedded, sectioned, and immunostained with antibodies to Tn-MUC1 5E5
mAb, anti-MUC1 HMFG1 mAb (Abcam), rabbit anti-human EpCAM (Abcam),
and rabbit anti-human cis-Golgi GM130 (Abcam). The sections were stained
with secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit Ig and imaged on a Leica SP8
confocal microscope.
Cytokine Secretion
Human T cell effectors were incubated with target cells at a 2:1 ratio in R10 for
16 hr. Supernatant was analyzed for IFN-g using the Human IFNg DuoSet
ELISA (R&D Systems). Effector cells were also cultured on glycopeptide-
coated plates for 24 hr and the supernatant was analyzed for IFN-g or IL-2
using the Human IL-2 DuoSet ELISA (R&D Systems).
Peptide ELISA
Synthetic glycopeptides were prepared as previously described (Tarp et al.,
2007). Lyophilized peptides were resuspended in PBS and coated on
96-well plates overnight at 4�C at the indicated concentrations. Plates were
blocked with 10 mg/mL BSA in PBS-Tween for 1 hr at 37�C, incubated with pri-
mary antibody for 1 hr, followed by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG second-
ary antibody for 30 min, then developed with TMB substrate solution (Pierce)
for 20 min, and the reaction was stopped with 2N H2SO4. The absorbance
was read at 450 nm using a plate spectrophotometer.
Xenograft Models
NSG mice were provided by the University of Pennsylvania Stem Cell & Xeno-
graft Core. Jurkat and Jurkat CD19-P2A-COSMC xenograft models were es-
tablished by injecting 5 million luciferase-expressing cells in 100 ml of PBS in
the lateral tail vein. Hs766T xenograft model was established by injection of
100,000 luciferase-expressing cells in 100 ml PBS intraperitoneally. When the
mean total flux of the tumor was between 107 and 108 photos/sec, 10 million
5E5 CAR, CD19 CAR, or NTD T cells in 100 ml of PBS, were injected once in
the lateral tail vein. Bioluminescence was measured through serial weekly im-
aging on a Xenogen IVIS-200 Spectrum camera. Mice were euthanized when

 moribund or upon the development of hind-limb paralysis or accumulated
abdominal ascites. All experiments were performed via protocols approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of
Pennsylvania.
T Synthase Assay
Cell lines were lysed in 1X RIPA (Cell Signaling) supplemented with phenylme-
thanesulfonylfluoride (PMSF) and the protein concentration was quantified by
the DC Protein Assay (BioRad). The T synthase activity of the cell lines was
assessed according to the protocol by Ju et al. (2011). Briefly, 30 mg of pro-
tein extract was incubated with GalNAc-4MU, UDP-galactose, MnCl2, and
O-glycosidase for one hour at 37�C. The reaction was stopped with the addi-
tion of 1 M glycine-NaOH pH 10 and the subsequent fluorescence of each
sample was measured at excitation of 355 nm and emission of 460 nm on
the plate spectrophotometer.
