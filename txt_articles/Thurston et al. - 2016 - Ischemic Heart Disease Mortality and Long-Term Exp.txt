Introduction
Numerous epidemiologic studies have docu-
mented associations between long-term 
exposure to fine particulate matter mass 
≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5) air pollution and increased 
mortality in urban populations (e.g., Beelen 
et al. 2014; Brook et al. 2010; Dockery et al. 
1993; Eftim et al. 2008; Krewski et al. 2000; 
Ostro et al. 2010; Ozkaynak and Thurston 
1987; Pope et al. 1995, 2002). This associa-
tion is notably robust in the United States for 
cardiovascular disease mortality, and especially 
death from ischemic heart disease (IHD; asso-
ciated with a reduction of blood supply to 
the heart, potentially leading to heart attack), 
as found in prior analyses of the American 
Cancer Society (ACS) Cancer Prevention 
Study-II (CPS-II) cohort (Pope et al. 2004). 
Based on such studies, the U.S. EPA has 
attributed nearly 90% of the economic valu-
ation of human health benefits derived from 
the U.S. Clean Air Act to reductions in PM2.5 
(U.S. EPA 1999), and nearly 1 in 5 U.S. IHD 
deaths are associated with PM2.5 exposure 
(Fann et al. 2012). Globally, it has been 
estimated by the World Health Organization 
(WHO) that roughly 3 million people die 
each year as a result of outdoor ambient 
particulate matter air pollution exposures 
(Lim et al. 2012; WHO 2014), indicating 
that air pollution is one of the world’s largest 
single environmental health risks, with PM2.5 
being estimated to account for some 9.4% 
[95% confidence interval (CI) 6.6–11.8] of all 
IHD globally (Evans et al. 2013).
Past research has focused primarily on 
PM2.5 mass concentration, so the types 
and sources of particles most responsible 
for these adverse health associations are not 
known, limiting our ability to address this 
global cardiovascular disease threat. Thus, the 
National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the 
WHO have placed a high priority on deter-
mining which constituents and components of 
the PM2.5 mass are most responsible for these 
reported health effects (NRC 2001; WHO 
2007). As noted by the WHO (2007), this 
would “facilitate targeted abatement policies 
and more effective control measures to reduce 
the burden of disease due to air pollution.”
The present analysis addresses this need 
by extending the follow-up of one of the 
largest of the PM2.5–mortality cohort studies 
that has linked individual risk factor and 
ambient air pollution with vital status data 
(Krewski et al. 2000; Pope et al. 2002, 2004), 
while expanding the scope to consider both 
PM2.5 source-specific components and trace 
element constituent exposures. Contributions 
of this analysis include a) expansion of the 
follow-up from 16 to 22 years, increasing the 
number of deaths considered by more than 
one-third; b) substantially expanded PM2.5

Background: Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution exposure has been identified as a global 
health threat. However, the types and sources of particles most responsible are not yet known. 
oBjectives: We sought to identify the causal characteristics and sources of air pollution underlying 
past associations between long-term PM2.5 exposure and ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality, as 
established in the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Prevention Study-II cohort. 
Methods: Individual risk factor data were evaluated for 445,860 adults in 100 U.S. metropolitan 
areas followed from 1982 through 2004 for vital status and cause of death. Using Cox proportional 
hazard models, we estimated IHD mortality hazard ratios (HRs) for PM2.5, trace constituents, and 
pollution source–associated PM2.5, as derived from air monitoring at central stations throughout 
the nation during 2000–2005. 
results: Associations with IHD mortality varied by PM2.5 mass constituent and source. A coal 
combustion PM2.5 IHD HR = 1.05 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.08) per microgram/cubic meter, versus an 
IHD HR = 1.01 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.02) per microgram/cubic meter PM2.5 mass, indicated a risk 
roughly five times higher for coal combustion PM2.5 than for PM2.5 mass in general, on a per 
microgram/cubic meter PM2.5 basis. Diesel traffic–related elemental carbon (EC) soot was also asso-
ciated with IHD mortality (HR = 1.03; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.06 per 0.26-μg/m3 EC increase). However, 
PM2.5 from both wind-blown soil and biomass combustion was not associated with IHD mortality.
conclusions: Long-term PM2.5 exposures from fossil fuel combustion, especially coal burning 
but also from diesel traffic, were associated with increases in IHD mortality in this nationwide 
population. Results suggest that PM2.5–mortality associations can vary greatly by source, and that 
the largest IHD health benefits per microgram/cubic meter from PM2.5 air pollution control may 
be achieved via reductions of fossil fuel combustion exposures, especially from coal-burning sources.

PM2.5 composition data; and c) consideration 
of source-apportioned PM2.5 mass to investi-
gate which pollution sources are most impor-
tant to PM2.5–IHD mortality associations in 
this cohort.
Methods
Study Population
The study population cohort was drawn from 
the ACS CPS-II, a prospective mortality 
study of approximately 1.2 million adults 
(Garfinkel 1985; Krewski et al. 2009). 
Participants were enrolled by ACS volun-
teers in the fall of 1982, and resided in all 
50 states, the District of Columbia, and 
Puerto Rico. Enrollment was restricted to 
persons at least 30 years of age, in households 
including someone at least 45 years of age, 
from whom the ACS obtained informed 
consent. Participants completed surveys that 
included questions about age, sex, weight, 
height, smoking history, alcohol use, occu-
pational exposures, diet, education, marital 
status, and other characteristics. This 
secondary analysis of the ACS CPS-II data 
set was approved by the Ottawa Hospital 
Research Ethics Board, Canada, and by the 
Institutional Review Board at the New York 
University School of Medicine. 
Deaths were ascertained through personal 
inquiries (e.g., direct contact with participants 
by volunteers) through September 1988, 
and subsequently via the National Death 
Index (Calle and Terrell 1993) through 
31 December 2004. Mortality from IHD was 
studied because this was the category found 
most associated with PM2.5 exposure in past 
analyses of this cohort (e.g., Krewski et al. 
2009; Pope et al. 2004). More than 99% of 
known deaths were assigned a cause using 
the International Classification of Diseases, 9th 
and 10th Revision (ICD-9 codes 410–414; 
ICD-10 codes I20–I25). The analytic cohort 
included 445,860 participants having ques-
tionnaire, known vital status through 2004, 
and contextual census data, residing in 100 
U.S. metropolitan areas within the contig-
uous United States where the required air 
pollution data were available, with 34,408 
IHD deaths (of a total of 157,572 deaths 
from all causes) occurring during follow-up. 
Seventy-six of the metropolitan study areas 
were included in previously published ACS 
studies (e.g., Pope et al. 2002, 2004).
Particulate Matter Source and 
Constituent Exposure Estimates
Participants were assigned a metropolitan 
area of residence based on their enroll-
ment address and three-digit ZIP code area. 
Complete data were available for 100 metro-
politan statistical areas (MSAs) (Figure 1). The 
mean concentrations of PM2.5 mass and trace 
constituents were compiled for 2000–2005 
from the Health Effects Institute (HEI) 
Atmospheric and Environmental Research 
(AER) database (HEI 2007), derived from the 
U.S. EPA Air Quality System that archived 
Chemical Species Network (CSN) and 
gaseous criteria pollutant data. The present 
analysis focuses on further investigations of 
the PM2.5–IHD association, so gaseous air 
pollutants, evaluated in past analyses (Krewski 
et al. 2009), are not considered here, except in 
the derivation of the source factors (Thurston 
et al. 2011), as discussed below. These PM2.5 
constituent data were analyzed to derive 
estimates of source apportioned PM2.5 mass 
exposure concentrations using the absolute 
principal component analysis (APCA) PM2.5 
source apportionment method (Thurston and 
Spengler 1985). Because this process results 
in orthogonal source components, the source 
impacts developed have the advantage that 
they are derived to be as independent of one 
another as possible. This method involved 
a) a factor analysis of the trace constituents; 
b) identification of source-related factors (based 
on key tracers in each component); c) adjust-
ment of factor scores into absolute scores; and 
d) a regression of the PM2.5 mass data on the 
source-related components, yielding appor-
tionments of PM2.5 mass to each source-related 
factor (Thurston et al. 2011).
These PM2.5 mass and speciation 
data have been previously characterized on 
a nationwide basis (Bell et al. 2007). Trace 
elements considered were arsenic (As), 
calcium (Ca), chlorine (Cl), iron (Fe), lead 
(Pb), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), selenium 
(Se), vanadium (V), silicon (Si), zinc (Zn), 
potassium (K), sodium (Na), elemental carbon 
(EC), organic carbon (OC), and sulfur (S). 
In the source apportionment analysis 
of these trace constituent and mass data 
(Thurston et al. 2011), the major U.S. 
PM2.5 source categories derived (and their 
key source-identifier elemental tracers) were 
metals industry (Pb, Zn); soil particles (Ca, 
Si); motor vehicle traffic (EC); steel industry 
(Fe, Mn); coal combustion (As, Se); oil 
combustion (V, Ni); salt particles (Na, Cl); 
and biomass burning (K, OC). Although 
these various tracer elements are individually 
emitted by multiple sources, when they appear 
together they have been found to be useful for 
identifying specific source category impacts 
(e.g., both As and Se for coal) (Thurston et al. 
2011). Sulfur (S) is considered individually 
here, but it is a general marker for fossil fuel 
sources that could have different predominant 
origins in different places (e.g., oil or diesel 
combustion in California vs. coal combustion 
in the Eastern United States), so it is not as 
uniquely associated with any one single source 
category, and was therefore not included in 
the source apportionment model (Thurston 
et al. 2011). Of traffic emissions, EC derives 
predominantly from diesel vehicles, whereas 
nitrogen dioxide (NO2), also included as a 
traffic tracer in this source apportionment, is 
emitted by both diesel- and gasoline-powered 
vehicles (Schauer et al. 2006). Nationwide 
spatial plots of the source-related PM2.5 
contributions to total PM2.5 mass (hereafter 
referred to as source impacts) have been 
found to support the source-component 
interpretations in this analysis: Ubiquitous 
sources, such as traffic and soil, were found 
to be spread across the nation, while more 
unique sources were not (e.g., steel and 
metals processing highest in select industri-
alized cities, coal highest in the Ohio River 
Valley region, biomass burning highest in the

U.S. Northwest, and residual oil combustion 
highest in the northeastern United States and 
major seaport cities) (Thurston et al. 2011). 
To provide directly comparable results with 
past nationwide analyses of this cohort (e.g., 
Krewski et al. 2009; Pope et al. 2002, 2004), 
individual-site elemental and source appor-
tioned PM2.5 exposures were averaged over 
the concentration values for all monitors 
in each MSA for the health effects analyses 
(ranging from one to four PM2.5 speciation 
monitoring stations per MSA) over the period 
2000–2005, with a majority (53%) of partici-
pants residing in an MSA with multiple sites.
Statistical Analysis
Standard and multilevel random-effects Cox 
proportional hazard (RE-CPH) regression 
models were applied to estimate mortality 
in relation to each of the individual indices 
of PM2.5 air pollution. The most extensively 
adjusted models estimated IHD mortality 
hazard ratios (HRs) for each PM2.5 mass, 
constituent, and source exposure using Cox 
proportional hazards (CPH) (Fleming and 
Harrington 1991) models that also included 
spatial random effects and control for contex-
tual socioeconomic variables. We also evalu-
ated models with random effects but not 
contextual variables, models with contextual 
variables but not random effects, and fixed-
effects models adjusted for individual-level 
variables only. The time axis used in the 
models was survival time from enrollment 
date. Survival times were censored at time 
of death or end of follow-up. To facilitate 
comparisons with past analyses, we modeled 
individual PM2.5 constituents and sources 
as continuous variables and report HRs for 
interquartile range (IQR) increases (equal to 
the difference between the 25th and 75th 
percentile) in the estimated mean concentra-
tion of each pollutant during 2000–2005. 
We also report HRs per 1-μg/m3 increases in 
each source to facilitate comparisons among 
sources according to each source’s mortality 
contribution per unit mass. In addition, we 
conducted sensitivity analyses of simultaneous 
CPH models, including both a source-related 
PM2.5 mass and the remaining PM2.5 mass 
(i.e., PM2.5-source–related PM2.5), for each 
identified PM2.5 source category to estimate 
the source-specific PM2.5 IHD impacts, after 
adjusting for the impact of all other PM2.5. 
Natural spline plots, showing concentration–
response curves for key source impact catego-
ries, were also prepared, using the statistical 
package R. In R, a model was defined using 
the function ns() of the R “splines” package, 
in combination with the GAMEPHIT proce-
dure, by including in the model a term the 
form ns(x, df = k), where df is the number 
of degrees of freedom (Krewski et al. 2009; 
R Core Team 2012). All survival models were 
stratified by 1-year age categories, sex, and race 
(non-Hispanic white vs. other), assigning each 
sex–race–age category its own baseline hazard. 
A total of 42 variables were included to 
control for individual characteristics that 
might confound the air pollution–mortality 
association. The variables included were 
individual-level risk factors from the CPS-II 
enrollment questionnaire (Garfinkel 1985), 
based upon previous ACS air pollution 
analyses model specifications (e.g., Krewski 
et al. 2009), as listed in Table 1. These 
included active smoking and former smoking 
(yes/no for each; and cigarettes/day, duration, 
and initiation < 18 years among active and 
former smokers, respectively); ever cigar/pipe 
smoker (yes/no); passive smoke exposure 
(hours/day); possible workplace exposure to 
PM (yes/no); occupational dirtiness index (7 
categories with an indicator of exposure to an 
increasingly dirty job or not, plus a missing 
data category); marital status (married, single, 
or other); education (< high school, high 
school, or > high school); body mass index 
(BMI) and BMI2; consumption of beer, wine, 
and other alcohol (yes, no, or missing, with 
separate variables for each type of alcohol); 
quintile of dietary fat consumption; and

quintile of combined dietary vegetable, fruit, 
and fiber consumption. For the occupational 
dirtiness index, six enrollment question 
variables were used to record past occupa-
tional exposures to asbestos, chemicals/acids/
solvents, coal/stone dust, coal tar/pitch/
asphalt, diesel engine exhaust, or formalde-
hyde, and these were then collapsed into one 
variable for the statistical analyses by identi-
fying a participant as occupationally exposed 
if a “1” for “yes” appeared for any one of the 
six variables (Krewski et al. 2000). 
Data on ecologic risk factors representing 
social and economic variables were obtained 
from the U.S. Census and other secondary 
sources at the MSA level (U.S. Census Bureau 
1993). Six ecologic covariates were obtained 
from the 1990 U.S. Census [median house-
hold income, percentage of persons > 16 years 
of age who were unemployed, percentage of 
adults with a postsecondary education, Gini 
coefficient of income inequality (ranging from 
0 to 1, with 0 indicating an equal distribution 
of income, and 1 indicating that one person 
has all the income), and percent black and 
percent Hispanic population] (U.S. Census 
Bureau 1993). Models also incorporated an 
MSA-level random effects adjustment, taking 
into account residual mortality variation 
within communities (Krewski et al. 2009).

versus PM2.5 quintile in Table 1. This 
is a nationwide cohort, but considers only 
adults > 30 years of age at enrollment. It 
was recruited by volunteers, rather than via 
random sampling. The average age of the 
cohort was 56.6 years at enrollment, and the 
group has more advanced education and a 
higher percentage of white participants than 
the general population of the United States. 
The PM2.5 constituent and source appor-
tionment exposure data are summarized 
in Table 2. These data indicate that traffic-
related PM2.5 has the highest mean concen-
tration averaged across the national cohort 
(Thurston et al. 2011), whereas other, more 
regionalized sources (e.g., coal combustion, 
oil combustion, biomass burning, and soil) 
have somewhat lower national average PM2.5 
concentration contributions. 
Figure 2 presents the PM2.5–IHD 
mortality HRs (and 95% CIs) from the 
RE-CPH model (including individual and 
contextual variables) for the various PM2.5 
constituents (i.e., trace elements) and the 
source components (i.e., PM2.5 mass attrib-
uted to each source category). The results of 
all models considered (i.e., CPH with and 
without random effects, with and without 
contextual variables) are presented in 
Table 3. As shown in Figure 2 and Table 3, 
IHD mortality was statistically significantly 
associated (p < 0.05) with PM2.5 mass and 
a variety of PM2.5 elements across most 
models (e.g., Se, S, As, Cl, Pb, EC, Fe), but 
consistently not with others (e.g., Si, K, Mn, 
OC). Estimates based on reduced models 
(without random effects and/or adjustment 
for contextual variables) were generally 
more often statistically significant than the 
Table 1. Continued.

MSA, metropolitan statistical area. Values are mean ± SD or percent. PM2.5 mass concentration quintiles computed for 
2000–2005 using data matched to MSAs from the Health Effects Institute (HEI) Atmospheric and Environmental Research 
(AER) database. Characteristics are as collected at baseline using the ACS questionnaire (Krewski et al. 2002). These 
include active smoking and former smoking (yes/no for each; and cigarettes/day, duration, and initiation < 18 years 
among active and former smokers, respectively); ever cigar/pipe smoker (yes/no); passive smoke exposure (hr/day); 
possible workplace exposure to PM (yes/no); occupational dirtiness index (seven categories with an indicator of 
exposure or not, plus a missing data category); marital status (married, single, or other); education (< high school, high 
school, or > high school); body mass index (BMI) and BMI2; consumption of beer, wine, and other alcohol (yes, no, or 
missing, with separate variables for each type of alcohol); quintile of dietary fat consumption; and quintile of combined 
dietary vegetable, fruit, and fiber consumption. Six enrollment question variables were used to record past occupational 
exposures to asbestos, chemicals/acids/solvents, coal/stone dust, coal tar/pitch/asphalt, diesel engine exhaust, or 
formaldehyde, and these were then collapsed into one variable for the statistical analyses by identifying a participant as 
occupationally exposed if a “1” for “yes” appeared for any one of the six variables (Krewski et al. 2009).

more extensively adjusted model estimates. 
However, there were some exceptions, for 
example, the HR central estimate for S based 
on the fully adjusted model (1.06; 95% CI: 
1.02, 1.11) was statistically significant and 
also larger than the HR adjusted for indi-
vidual-level variables only (1.02; 95% CI: 
1.00, 1.03) (Table 3). 
The source-component results shown in 
Figure 2 and Table 3 are concordant with the 
strong associations found for coal combustion’s 
key tracers (Se and As), with consistently statis-
tically significant IHD mortality–PM2.5 source 
category associations across models being 
found with coal combustion PM2.5 (Table 3). 
Particulate S, which is predominantly formed 
from sulfur dioxide emissions from various 
fossil fuel combustion sources, but especially 
from coal power plant emissions in the United 
States during the period of this study (U.S. 
EPA 2000), is also significant in most models. 
Metals-related factors and mortality were 
also statistically significant in some models, 
though the average exposure is very low across 
the nation (mean, 0.2 μg/m3), consistent 
with the significant IHD association with Pb, 
a metal strongly associated with this source 
factor (Thurston et al. 2011). Coal combustion 
associated PM2.5 yielded an IHD HR of 1.03 
(95% CI: 1.01, 1.05, per coal combustion 
PM2.5 IQR = 0.64 μg/m3), whereas PM2.5 
mass yielded an IHD HR of 1.03 (95% CI: 
1.00, 1.06 per PM2.5 mass IQR = 3.1 μg/m3). 
W h e n  c o n s i d e r e d  o n  a  p e r 
10-μg/m3 PM2.5 mass basis, the CI of the 
estimate for PM2.5 HR of 1.09 (95% CI: 
1.00, 1.20) overlaps prior PM2.5–IHD esti-
mates for another subset of this same cohort 
(e.g., HR = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.21 per 
10-μg/m3 PM2.5, from Krewski et al. 2009). 
When the HRs of the source concentra-
tions (which are much smaller than the total 
mass) are similarly viewed on a per 1-μg/m3 
Figure 2. Cox random effects model ischemic disease mortality associations with PM2.5 elements and 
source contributions per interquartile range (IQR). (Steel increment = 0.1 μg/m3; steel IQR = 0.0.) Forty-two 
variables collected at enrollment were included to control for individual characteristics, including active 
smoking and former smoking; ever cigar/pipe smoker; passive smoke exposure; workplace exposure to 
PM; occupational dirtiness index; marital status; education; body mass index (BMI) and BMI2; consump-
tion of alcohol; dietary fat consumption; and dietary vegetable, fruit, and fiber consumption. Six enroll-
ment question variables were used to record past occupational exposures collapsed into one variable 
(Krewski et al. 2000, 2009). Six ecologic covariates obtained from the 1990 U.S. Census (median household 
income, percentage of persons > 16 years of age who were unemployed, percentage of adults with a 
post-secondary education, Gini coefficient of income inequality, and percent black and percent Hispanic 
population). These models also incorporated an MSA-level random-effects adjustment.

comparable basis, the coal combustion PM2.5 
had an IHD HR of 1.05 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.08) 
per 1-μg/m3 coal PM2.5, versus a 1-μg/m3 
PM2.5 HR of 1.01 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.02). This 
indicates that the IHD risk estimate for coal 
PM2.5 is roughly five times higher than that 
for PM2.5 mass in general, per microgram/
cubic meter. Although the overall traffic-
related PM2.5 component and the more 
gasoline engine traffic–related OC were not 
consistently statistically significantly associated 
with IHD mortality across the various models, 
a key tracer of diesel traffic (EC) was positively 
and statistically significantly associated with 
IHD in three of the four models considered 
(p < 0.05), and nearly so in the most exten-
sively specified RE-CPH model (HR = 1.03 
per 0.3 μg/m3 EC; 95% CI: 1.0, 1.06) 
(Table 3). However, neither wind-blown 
crustal/soil–related nor biomass combustion–
related PM2.5 mass was statistically signifi-
cantly associated with IHD mortality in any 
model considered.
Results of the sensitivity analysis, with 
both the individual source–related components 
of PM2.5 and the “all other” PM2.5 mass for 
each included simultaneously, are presented 
in Figure 3. In this analysis, estimates from 
models of source-related components of 
PM2.5 (presented in Figure 2 and Table 3) 
were adjusted for a variable representing the 
remaining PM2.5 mass (i.e., after subtracting 
the mass of each respective source-related 
component from total PM2.5 mass). These 
results indicate that, even after adjustment 
for the other PM2.5 mass, the coal-related 
PM2.5 HR is the source component least 
changed, and most clearly seen to be still 
statistically significant (IHD HR = 1.05; 
95% CI: 1.02, 1.08 per 1-μg/m3 coal PM2.5). 
In addition, of all the sources considered 
here, removal of coal-related PM2.5 from 
the PM2.5 mass reduces the overall PM2.5 
mass HR estimate the most. Indeed, once 
coal-related PM2.5 is removed, the “other 
PM2.5” HR drops to nearly 1.0 and is clearly 
 
non- 
significant (IHD HR = 1.01; 95% CI: 
0.93, 1.10 per 10-μg/m3 PM2.5). In these 
models, diesel traffic–related (IHD HR = 1.01; 
95% CI: 1.00, 1.03 per 1-μg/m3 PM2.5) and 
metals-related (IHD HR = 1.09; 95% CI: 
1.00, 1.20 per 1-μg/m3 PM2.5) PM2.5 are 
the only other sources that approach statis-
tical significance. Other sources of PM2.5 are 
seen from these results to be less important 
contributors to the overall PM2.5 mass effect 
because they are clearly nonsignificant, and 
their removal from PM2.5 has a more minor 
reduction in the PM2.5 mass HR estimate.
The correlations of the source-related 
components, as calculated from the individual 
trace element observations, were derived to be 
orthogonal (independent) from one another 
(Thurston et al. 2011), but averaging the daily 
values over time and metropolitan areas can 
introduce intercorrelations among the source 
impacts (e.g., if two source-specific PM2.5 
impacts are highest in the same city). The 
intercorrelations of the various source impacts 
across the metropolitan areas (not shown) 
indicate that the highest spatial correlations 
are found between steel impacts and metals 
concentrations (r = 0.67), which is likely 
attributable to the fact that both are especially 
high in Birmingham, Alabama, in this data set 
(Thurston et al. 2011). The salt- and traffic-
related PM2.5 components also show a rela-
tively high spatial intercorrelation with each 
other (r = 0.44), which is likely caused by the 
common use of salt on roads in winter. 
Natural spline plots of HRs as a function 
of source-specific mass concentration 
(Figure 4) are shown for the sources that 
were most consistently statistically significant 
across the various models examined (coal and 
traffic), versus those sources most consistently 
nonsignificant across the models examined 
(soil and biomass burning). These are visually 
seen to be roughly comparable with the 
Figure 2 RE-CPH HR effect estimates, with 
coal combustion having the steepest slope (i.e., 
greatest effect per microgram/cubic meter) 
presented, and a slope consistent with a 5% 
increase in IHD risk per 1-μg/m3 increase in 
PM2.5 mass concentration from coal combus-
tion. Also, similar to the RE-CPH results, 
crustal/soil and biomass burning PM2.5 are 
indicated by the CIs provided in these natural 
spline plots to have nonsignificant associations 
with IHD mortality.
Discussion
Although PM2.5 pollution from most indus-
trial and fossil fuel combustion categories had 
estimates of association with IHD mortality 
> 1.0, coal combustion PM2.5 and its key 
emission tracer elements (i.e., Se and As) 
were most strongly and robustly associated 
with IHD mortality across all the various 
model specifications considered (e.g., of these 
source and tracer groupings, they are the only 
ones that were clearly all statistically signifi-
cant across the four models considered). In 
addition, particulate S, known to result largely 
from fossil fuel combustion and especially 
coal combustion (Zhang et al. 2014), was 
also found to be associated. Notably, the asso-
ciation between IHD mortality per 1-μg/m3 
increase in coal combustion PM2.5 was 
larger than the effect estimate for a 1-μg/m3 
increase in total PM2.5 mass. In contrast, IHD 
mortality was not associated with crustal soil 
PM2.5, biomass PM2.5, nor with the elemental 
tracers associated with these source catego-
ries. However, our findings do not rule out 
effects of sources that were not identified by 
the source apportionment analysis, or effects 
of region-specific sources and exposures.

The associations between ambient PM2.5 
air pollution and IHD mortality in our study 
cohort are consistent with previous reports, 
though few studies have estimated asso-
ciations with long-term PM2.5 elemental 
constituents and/or source-specific PM2.5 
mass components. A previous cross-sectional 
study of long-term PM2.5 sources and all-cause 
mortality rates in the United States during 
1980 (Ozkaynak and Thurston 1987) similarly 
reported mortality associations with metropol-
itan area-wide sulfates and coal combustion-
related particle exposures. Previous analyses of 
the ACS CPS-II cohort (Krewski et al. 2000; 
Pope et al. 1995, 2002, 2004) and the Harvard 
Six Cities Study cohort (Dockery et al. 1993) 
also showed associations between sulfates and 
both all-cause and cardiopulmonary mortality. 
Long-term exposures to EC and S were 
significantly associated with total mortality 
in a previous analysis of the ACS CPS-II 
cohort (Smith et al. 2009). A meta-analysis 
of data from 19 European cohorts indicated 
that long-term exposure to PM2.5 sulfur was 
associated with natural-cause mortality, and 
that this association was robust to adjustment 
for other pollutants and PM2.5 mass (Beelen 
et al. 2015). Sulfate alone, as discussed by 
Lippmann and Thurston (1996), is an unlikely 
causal factor for mortality or morbidity 
from a toxicological perspective, so it may 
be a contributor to the toxicity of the PM2.5 
mixture or serve as a marker for a certain type 
or source of particulate pollution that needs 
identification. A study of deaths among U.S. 
veterans (Lipfert et al. 2006) employed data 
from the U.S. EPA CSN fine particle specia-
tion network, finding mortality associations 
with nitrates, EC, Ni, V, and traffic density. 
PM2.5 constituents derived from fossil fuel 
combustion and constituents of crustal origin 
were more strongly associated than other 
PM2.5 constituents with mortality in a popula-
tion of 45,000 California teachers (Ostro et al. 
2010). A follow-up of this cohort (Ostro et al. 
2015) found statistically significant (p < 0.05) 
associations of IHD with PM2.5 mass, nitrate, 
EC, copper, and secondary organics and the 
sources gas- and diesel-fueled vehicles, meat 
cooking, and high-sulfur fuel combustion 
in California. However, individual trace 
element metals were not associated with CVD 
mortality in a meta-analysis of 19 European 
cohorts (Wang et al. 2014). Collectively, these 
past studies are largely consistent with a finding 
that the PM2.5 association with mortality varies 
with its elemental composition, but most past 
studies have not looked at the PM2.5 constit-
uent issue from a collective source-specific 
PM2.5 component perspective, which is more 
readily translatable into air quality policy. 
Although effects of short-term (day-to-
day) exposures to PM2.5 components and 
sources may differ from effects of long-term 
exposures, findings from studies of short-
term exposures to trace elements and sources 
have been generally consistent with findings 
from the present study. For example, Laden 
et al. (2000) estimated that a 10-μg/m3 
increase in PM2.5 from mobile sources was 
associated with a 3.4% (95% CI: 1.7, 5.2%) 
increase in daily mortality in six U.S. cities, 
and that a 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 from 
coal combustion sources was associated with 
a 1.1% increase (95% CI: 0.3, 2.0%) in 
mortality. However, daily mortality was not 
associated with PM2.5 crustal soil particles 
(Laden et al. 2000). The authors concluded 
that combustion particles in the fine fraction 
from mobile and coal combustion sources, 
but not fine crustal particles, were associ-
ated with increased daily mortality. Using 
Bayesian hierarchical modeling, Bell and 
HEI Health Review Committee (2012) 
investigated seasonal and temporal varia-
tion in PM2.5 composition and the risk of 
total, cardiovascular, and respiratory hospital 
admissions for persons ≥ 65 years of age in 
202 U.S. counties during 1999 through 
2005, finding that mortality effect estimates 
for particulate matter mass were higher in 
seasons and counties with higher PM2.5 Ni 
content. Ito et al. (2006) applied a Poisson 
generalized linear model to estimate source-
specific PM2.5 mass relative risks at lags 
0–4 days for total nonaccidental, cardio-
vascular, and cardiorespiratory mortality 
adjusting for weather, seasonal/temporal 
trends, and day-of-week for Washington, 
DC, during 1988–1997. They found that 
the secondary sulfate component had the 
largest (and most consistently statisti-
cally significant across investigative teams) 
percent excess cardiovascular mortality risk 
estimates, with primary coal-related PM2.5 
being similarly significantly associated, and 
risk estimates for traffic-related PM2.5, though 
significant in some cases, were more variable, 
and soil-related PM showed smaller effect size 
estimates. These various studies have largely 
provided results consistent with the findings 
of this new research, indicating that the

related PM2.5 (μg/m3) for coal, traffic, soil, and biomass source contributions to PM2.5 mass, in a model

tion of alcohol; dietary fat consumption; and dietary vegetable, fruit, and fiber consumption. Six enroll-
ment question variables were used to record past occupational exposures collapsed into one variable

population). All models also incorporated MSA-level random effects.

mortality risk from PM2.5 can vary by mass 
composition and source. 
Overall, in this new research we found that 
the PM2.5 source-component associations with 
IHD mortality were consistent with results 
from individual key trace constituents used 
to identify pollution sources. Model results 
indicate that, in this data set, long-term expo-
sures to PM2.5 from coal combustion-related 
PM2.5 (a source component most correlated 
with As and Se) and EC (a tracer element from 
combustion sources, especially diesel-powered 
motor vehicles in urban areas) were among 
those most robustly associated with increased 
risk of IHD mortality across the models 
considered. The fact that IHD mortality risk 
was more consistently statistically significantly 
associated with the EC tracer across the models 
than was overall traffic-related PM2.5 may 
suggest that the diesel portion of the traffic 
component increases risk to IHD more than 
PM2.5 from other vehicles. Soil and biomass 
burning (and their tracers, Si and Ca, and 
K and OC, respectively) were least often 
positively significantly associated with IHD 
mortality across models. 
This study has two important strengths. 
This is the first large nationwide U.S. study 
to comprehensively examine the character-
istics of PM2.5 elemental constituents and 
source-specific components in relation to 
IHD in a prospective cohort study in which 
we were able to consider detailed individual-
level subject risk factor information. Only 
recently have the availability of data from 
the CSN and the development of advanced 
source apportionment methods made studies 
of the constituents and sources of PM2.5 
possible. Second, the large population and 
number of cities considered, combined with 
the increased long-term follow-up, provide 
enhanced power to assess increases in risk 
related to relatively small changes in PM2.5 
mass and component exposures. 
Despite the strengths of this new analysis, 
there are several attributes of this study that 
may have limited its ability to detect all effects. 
One was the use of central-site monitors as an 
indicator of individual exposure, which, even 
though averaged across available sites in each 
MSA, could potentially introduce nondiffer-
ential measurement error across the various 
sources. Traffic markers such as EC can 
display significant long-term average concen-
tration spatial variation on scales of 50–500 m 
within cities (Henderson et al. 2007), whereas 
elevated pollution sources (e.g., power plants 
with tall stacks) may be more spatially homo-
geneous. This could potentially bias the effect 
estimates of localized sources, such as traffic, 
toward the null hypothesis of no increase in 
risk. Another concern might be that not all 
sources varied as much spatially (e.g., between 
cities) as others, which may limit the ability 
of the analysis to identify the impact of those 
more spatially homogeneous, and less spatially 
variable, sources, especially the steel industry 
and salt aerosols (having the smallest overall 
Standard Deviations in Table 2). However, 
coal combustion PM2.5 exposure had a 
smaller absolute standard deviation across the 
United States than two of the other sources 
(wood burning and traffic), but still had the 
most significant association, suggesting that 
this factor was not a major determinant of 
source significance in this analysis. Spatial 
confounding may also remain, despite 
adjustment for contextual variables defined 
at the MSA level and the use of random 
effects models to account for uncontrolled 
regional variation. 
Potential misclassification of the cause 
of death and changes in participant char-
acteristics (such as smoking status) during 
the follow-up are also sources of potential 
misclassification. In addition, exposures 
were classified using PM2.5 data from 2000 
through 2005, whereas follow-up extended 
from 1982 through 2004; consequently, there 
could have been some exposure misclassifica-
tion if concentrations of PM2.5 and PM2.5 
constituents changed over time, and asso-
ciations with PM2.5 sources in 2000–2005 
may actually reflect earlier exposures to these 
sources of PM2.5. Previous analyses of this 
cohort have shown PM2.5 levels at different 
time periods to be correlated, with lower 
levels at the end of the follow-up period, 
but indicating that areas with the highest 
exposures in the 1980s were still the most 
highly exposed in 2000 (Pope et al. 2002). 
Estimated concentrations of many of the trace 
element constituents (including Si, Se, Zn, 
V, and Mn) and source components (soil, 
coal, metals, traffic, and oil) were correlated 
with estimates for the early 1980s, at the start 
of cohort follow-up (Thurston et al. 2011), 
supporting the use of 2000–2005 CSN data 
to estimate long-term exposures. Although 
residential mobility is generally relatively low 
in older adults (Mateyka 2015), exposure 
misclassification could also have occurred if 
ACS cohort participants moved to a different 
area after baseline (Jerrett et al. 2007). 
A lack of information on medications 
(e.g., statins, anti-hypertensives) could also 
be a potential confounding factor if they are 
spatially correlated with air pollution expo-
sures, because statins have been suggested 
as possibly protective against PM2.5 health 
effects (e.g., Schwartz et al. 2005). Because 
there may have been regional differences in 
drug-prescribing patterns and adherence, 
and although adjustment has been made for 
random effects and for individual- and city-
level socioeconomic status indicators, they 
may not have been adequate to address this 
potential source of confounding.
These results also raise the causality 
question as to whether it is biologically plau-
sible that combustion-related particles, and 
particularly coal combustion PM2.5, would 
have a greater cardiovascular toxicity, per unit 
mass of exposure, than other particles, espe-
cially versus those of biomass or soil origins. 
There is evidence that oxidant stress is involved 
in the cardiovascular impacts of PM2.5, 
and it is also known that trace metals, such 
as those contained in high concentration in 
fossil fuel combustion–related particles, can 
cause oxidative stress (Brook et al. 2010), likely 
contributing to atherosclerosis progression. 
In addition, New York University’s mouse 
inhalation studies at five U.S. sites showed 
substantial variations in aortic plaque progres-
sion by geographic region that were consistent 
with the regional variation in annual IHD 
mortality in the ACS-II cohort, with both the 
human and mouse responses being primarily 
attributable to the coal combustion source 
category (Lippmann 2014; Lippmann et al. 
2013). Moreover, fossil fuel sources, notably 
coal combustion, are usually higher in sulfur 
content than biomass particles, resulting in 
sulfates, a secondary aerosol component that 
has been associated with increased mortality. 
The potential interaction of trace metals and 
sulfur in increasing the toxicity of PM2.5 
mass has been posited in the recent British 
Committee on the Medical Effects of Air 
Pollutants (COMEAP) Report (2009), which 
states that “Sulphates could play a role in the 
capacity of PM2.5 to drive pulmonary inflam-
mation via either increasing metal mobilisation 
from PM, and hence increasing the ability to 
drive oxidative stress leading to inflamma-
tion…. Inflammation in the lung could then 
initiate changes in blood clotting, and/or 
activation of macrophages in atherosclerotic 
plaques increasing their instability.” 
Although evidence on acute respiratory 
effects of biomass PM has been well docu-
mented (Henderson and Johnson 2012; 
Martin et al. 2013), evidence of cardiovas-
cular disease impacts by particulate matter 
from biomass is less certain. Indeed, a recent 
cohort study of chronic biomass cooking 
pollution exposures in Bangladesh found a 
significant increase in respiratory mortality, 
but not in cardiac deaths (Alam et al. 2012). 
Although the biological mechanism(s) 
responsible for the apparently greater long-
term cardiovascular toxicity of fossil fuel 
combustion particles versus others not 
enriched in transition metals and sulfur (e.g., 
soil, biomass) are not yet known, there are 
plausible toxicological pathways consistent 
with these constituents in fossil fuel PM2.5, 
and especially coal PM2.5, being more 
strongly associated with IHD mortality 
(Brook et al. 2010). Although our study is 
a U.S.-based analysis of older adults, these 
 IHD mortality and source components of U.S. PM2.5

findings have potentially broad policy impli-
cations: As the developing world deals with 
an increasing disease burden from air pollu-
tion, reductions in fossil fuel combustion, 
especially coal combustion, may well be the 
most efficacious policy approach to reduce air 
pollution’s global human health burden.
Recent risk assessments have been 
conducted based on exposure to concentra-
tions of PM2.5 mass decomposed into its 
pollution sources (e.g., Lelieveld et al. 2015). 
As discussed by Jerrett (2015), these past 
assessments have generally assumed that the 
change in risk associated with PM2.5 mass 
concentration is independent of source. Our 
new study provides evidence that there may, 
in fact, exist sources where the risk per micro-
gram/cubic meter appears to be either greater 
than (e.g., coal) or less than (e.g., biomass) the 
effect estimate derived in past epidemiological 
studies from the overall mass concentration. 
Although these new findings are supported 
by biological plausibility (as discussed above), 
further research is needed to further test the 
generalizability of the associations found (e.g., 
in younger populations).
In summary, we estimated associations 
between IHD mortality and long-term expo-
sures to elemental constituents and source 
components of PM2.5 in a U.S. cohort of older 
adults with follow-up from 1982 through 
2004. Exposure to fossil fuel combustion–
related PM2.5 air pollution, especially from 
coal combustion, but also from diesel traffic–
related emissions, was significantly associated 
with IHD mortality in our study population. 
This finding, combined with past results 
and other knowledge of PM2.5 constituent 
toxicity, suggests that the greatest cardiovas-
cular mortality benefits from PM2.5 control 
may be achieved via reductions in fossil fuel 
PM2.5 exposures, especially in PM2.5 from coal 
combustion. This research has implications 
for both clean air policy and climate change 
mitigation policy because it provides an indi-
cation as to which of the various sources of 
EC, carbon dioxide, and particulate matter, 
if reduced, might return the greatest public 
health benefits.
