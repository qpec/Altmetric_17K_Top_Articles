SUMMARY
Neural networks are emerging as the fundamental
computational unit of the brain and it is becoming
progressively clearer that network dysfunction is at
the core of a number of psychiatric and neurodegen-
erative disorders. Yet, our ability to target specific
networks for functional or genetic manipulations re-
mains limited. Monosynaptically restricted rabies vi-
rus facilitates the anatomical investigation of neural
circuits. However, the inherent cytotoxicity of the
rabies largely prevents its implementation in long-
term functional studies and the genetic manipulation
of neural networks. To overcome this limitation, we
developed a self-inactivating DG-rabies virus (SiR)
that transcriptionally disappears from the infected
neurons while leaving permanent genetic access to
the traced network. SiR provides a virtually unlimited
temporal window for the study of network dynamics
and for the genetic and functional manipulation
of neural circuits in vivo without adverse effects on
neuronal physiology and circuit function.
INTRODUCTION
Network dynamics are thought to be the substrate of brain infor-
mation processing and of mental representations (Buzsa
´ ki and
Freeman, 2015; McIntosh, 2000). From a clinical perspective,
network-wide dysfunction is also beginning to be recognized
as the culprit behind a number of psychiatric (Rubinov and Bull-
more, 2013) and neurodegenerative disorders (Roselli and Car-
oni, 2012). Consequently, major efforts have been made in the
development of methods to unravel the organization of neural
networks both in animal models and humans (Callaway, 2008;
Cardona et al., 2010; Livet et al., 2007; Osten and Margrie,
2013; van den Heuvel et al., 2016). However, defining circuit ar-
chitecture is only the first step toward understanding the phys-
ical implementation of information processing in the brain. Infor-
mation about circuit topology, namely the relationships among
neurons within a connected network, should also be used
to gain functional and genetic access to topologically defined
network elements, as this would allow probing their functional
role in neural computation and behavior.
The recent development of G-deleted rabies virus (DG-rabies)
(Mebatsion et al., 1996; Wickersham et al., 2007b) provided the
first non-electron microscopy (EM)-based method aimed at
revealing network synaptic topology upstream of defined nodes
(Miyamichi et al., 2011; Stepien et al., 2010; Tripodi et al., 2011;
Wickersham et al., 2007b). Despite the transformative role of
DG-rabies-based approaches in the anatomical investigation
of neuronal circuits, their use to manipulate the functional prop-
erties of neural networks in vivo remains limited. The main reason
of this limitation relates to the cytotoxic effects of the rabies virus.
The DG-rabies is a replication-competent virus that eventually
leads to neuronal death (Wickersham et al., 2007a). The temporal
window for optical imaging and functional interventions enabled
by DG-rabies in functionally unaffected circuits is thus limited to
5–17 days from infection (Namburi et al., 2015; Tian et al., 2016;
Wertz et al., 2015).
We reasoned that, in order to circumvent this limitation, it would
be sufficient to transcriptionally silence the virus shortly after the
primary infection. Transcriptional silencing of DNA-based viruses,
such as adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), is generally achieved
by using conditional recombinant cassettes that invert the viral
genes of interest upon recombination (Atasoy et al., 2008). How-
ever, strategies to conditionally manipulate the expression of
RNA-based viruses, such as rabies, are currently lacking. Given
the unique coupled nature of transcription and replication of the
rabies virus and their dependence on virally encoded proteins
(Finke and Conzelmann, 2005), we hypothesized that the condi-
tional modulation of viral protein stability, as opposed to viral
genome recombination, could act as an ON-OFF switch with
which to direct the viral transcription-replication cycle. To this
aim, we engineered the rabies genome so that selected viral pro-
teins could be reversibly targeted to the proteasome using a
conditionally cleavable proteasome-targeting domain. This gave
origin to a self-inactivating DG-rabies (SiR) that switches OFF
following the primary infection, thereby preventing cytotoxicity
while providing permanent genetic access to the mapped neural
elements via a CRE/FLP-mediated recombination event triggered
soon after the infection. We show that SiR-infected neurons retain
unaltered physiological properties, functional connectivity, and
normal synaptic function several months following the primary
infection and, likely, for the entire life of the animal. Furthermore,
we used SiR to perform in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging of V1

 neurons projecting to V2, showing that computational properties
of V1 neurons, such as their orientation tuning, remain intact after
SiR infection. The development of the SiR virus gives, for the first

RESULTS
Conditional Control on the Rabies Life Cycle
Given that both transcription and replication of the rabies virus
depend on virally encoded proteins, we hypothesized that con-
ditional modulation of viral protein stability may act as a switch
on the viral transcription-replication cycle. To achieve such a
modulation, we fused a PEST proteasome-targeting domain to
each and every protein of the DG-rabies virus (individually or in
combinations) in order to direct their proteasomal degradation
(Figure 1A; full list of constructs in Table S1). To implement a level
of conditional control on viral protein stability, the Tobacco Etch
Virus cleavage site (TEVs) was interposed between the particular
viral protein and the proteasome-targeting domain. The tobacco
etch virus protease (TEVp) selectively cleaves the TEVs linker,
separating the viral proteins from the proteasome-targeting
domain, sparing them from degradation (Figures 1A and 1B).
The binary system composed by TEVp and TEVs should provide
a form of exogenous control on the extent and temporal window
of viral protein degradation during viral production and, poten-
tially, in vivo. Namely, the virus should be able to transcribe
and replicate only when TEVp is present, giving origin to a sys-
tem in which viral transcription and replication are constitutively
OFF unless TEVp is provided.

We screened the suitability to viral pro-
duction and TEVp dependence of six viral
constructs, in which each viral protein
was targeted to the proteasome alone or
in combination (Figures 1C–1K; Table S1).
To this aim, we generated a stable cell line expressing TEVp and
thespikeglycoprotein(Figures1Aand1B).Surprisingly,thedesta-
bilization ofthe viral proteins M,P, N/P, and N/P/L led to a virus un-
able to efficiently spread even in presence of the protease. In
contrast, the virus with proteasome-targeted L protein did amplify
both in presence (Figure 1D) and absence (Figure 1J) of the TEV
protease, indicating that the partial destabilization of the L protein
by the degradation domain is insufficient to impair the viral
replication machinery. The virus in which the N protein alone
was destabilized showed the desired conditional control: failure
to amplify in absence of TEVp and successful amplification in
TEVp-expressing cells (at 18 days post transfection +TEVp
80% ± 4%, �TEVp 2% ± 0.2% of infected cells, p = 3 3 10�3,
two-tailed two-sample Student’s t test, Figure 1K). This indicates
that N is the sole viral protein whose conditional destabilization, in
our design, is sufficient to reversibly suppress the viral transcrip-
tion-replication cycle. We confirmed that the conditional inactiva-
tion of the N-tagged DG-rabies is a proteasome-dependent pro-
cess by amplifying the virus in absence of TEVp but in presence
of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Figure S1A). Indeed, the
amplification rate of the N-tagged DG-rabies virus significantly
increases, in a dose-dependent manner, following the administra-
tion of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (at 12 days post transfec-
tion 0 nM MG-132, 0.1% ± 0.1%; 250 nM MG-132, 13% ± 5% of
infected cells, p = 0.04, two-tailed two-sample Student’s t test,
Figure S1B). After a further round of improvement on the viral
cassette design (Figures S2 and S3; STAR Methods), we were
able to produce a SiR with the desired TEVp-dependent ON/
OFF kinetics constituted by an NPEST-rabies-mCherry cassette
containing a TEVp-cleavable linker between N and the PEST
sequence.

 Permanent Genetic Access to Neural Circuits with SiR
In order to experimentally assess the in vivo cytotoxicity of the
newly generated SiR, we added a CRE recombinase and a desta-
bilized mCherry (SiRCRE-mCherry, Figure 2B) to the SiR genome.
We then tested SiR transcription-replication kinetics and cyto-
toxicity in vivo by injecting SiRCRE-mCherry in the CA1 pyramidal
layer of Rosa-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-YFP mice (Figure 2B). The tran-
sient expression of the CRE recombinase driven by the SiR
should be adequate to ensure a permanent recombination of
the Rosa locus and consequent YFP expression even after a
complete transcriptional shut down of the virus (Figure 2A). At
the same time, the destabilized mCherry marks the presence of
active virus with high temporal resolution. Indeed, while at
3 days post infection (p.i.) only the virally encoded mCherry can
be detected (Figures S4C–S4C000 and S4F), by 6 days p.i. the vir-
ally encoded CRE has induced recombination of the conditional
mouse reporter cassette, triggering the expression of YFP in all
infected neurons (Figures S4D–S4D000 and S4F0). In order
to exclude any SiR-induced cytotoxicity, we monitored the sur-
vival of SiRCRE-mCherry-infected CA1 pyramidal neurons over a
6-month period. By 3 weeks p.i., the SiR had completely shut
down (98% ± 2% YFPON mCherryOFF, Figures 2D–2D000 and 2G)
and, more importantly, no significant neuronal loss was observed
during the 6-month period following SiR infection (one-way
ANOVA, F = 0.12, p = 0.97, Figures 2F–2F000and 2G). This is in
striking contrast with what is observed after canonical DG-rabies
infection, in which the majority of infected neurons in the hippo-
campus die within 2 weeks from the primary infection (Figures
S5A–S5C). We further confirmed the absence of SiR-induced
cytotoxic effects in vivo by assessing the level of caspase-3 acti-
vation (cCaspase3) at 1 and 2 weeks following SiR infection and
comparing it to that elicited in mock-injected controls. The results
indicate no significant differences between SiR and mock-in-
jected conditions in the levels of caspase-3 activation (one-way
ANOVA, F = 0.11, p = 0.7, Figures S5F–S5G000 and S5H). Moni-
toring the in vivo viral RNA genomic titer during the course of
the infection also shows that SiR completely disappears (at a
genomic level) from the infected neurons by 2 weeks p.i. (Fig-
ure 2H). Overall, these results show that the SiRCRE-mCherry tran-
scription-replication kinetics provides enough time to generate
an early CRE recombination event (Figures S4D–S4D000) before
the virus disappears (Figures 2D–2D000). It thereby ensures perma-
nent genetic (CRE-mediated) access to the infected neurons
without affecting their survival (Figures 2G and 2H).
SiR Pharmacological Reactivation In Vivo
Experiments in vitro indicate that modulation of viral stability by
conditional proteasome degradation is sufficient to modulate
the viral transcription-replication cycle. In order to assess
whether conditional control over viral protein degradation can
be achieved in vivo, we designed an AAV virus to express
TEVp under a doxycycline-inducible promoter (AAVTRE::TEVp,
Figure 3A) (Shockett and Schatz, 1996). This should provide
pharmacological control on the viral transcription-replication cy-
cle by doxycycline-mediated release of viral N protein from tar-
geted proteasomal degradation.
To address if and at what stage post infection SiR can be
reactivated by doxycycline administration, we injected CA1
neurons in the hippocampus with AAVTRE::TEVp followed by the
SiRCRE-mCherry injection 1 week after. Doxycycline (100 mg/kg)
was then administered by oral gavage for 2 days at two different
time points, after 1 or 2 weeks post SiR infection (Figure 3B). In
agreement with the viral RNA profile analysis, administration of
doxycycline at 1 week post SiR infection, when the virus is
still transcriptionally active, significantly increases the percent-
age of YFPON mCherryON neurons (YFPON-mCherryON �doxy
22% ± 3%, +doxy 38% ± 2%, p = 0.02, Figures 3C–3D00 and
3G). Moreover, we observed no effect by administering doxycy-
cline 2 weeks post SiR infection (YFPON-mCherryON �doxy 1% ±
1%, +doxy 1% ± 1%, p = 0.2, Figures 3E–3G). These results indi-
cate that the transcriptional activity of the virus, as reflected by
mCherry expression, can be sustained in vivo if doxycycline is
administered in an early time window before the complete disap-
pearance of the virus.
SiR Transsynaptic Spreading Capabilities
For its use in long-term functional investigations of neural net-
works, it is key that the SiR retains the ability to spread transsy-
naptically. Therefore, we assessed the spreading capabilities of
SiR and compared it to the canonical B19 DG-rabies in both
cortical and subcortical circuits. In order to test this, we first in-
jected the nucleus accumbens (NAc) bilaterally with an AAV ex-
pressing TVA and the newly developed optimized rabies glyco-
protein (oG) (Figure 4A), which has been shown to enhance
rabies virus spreading (Kim et al., 2016). The expression of
TVA permits selective infection of the starting cells in the NAc
by an EnvA pseudotyped SiR, while the expression of oG allows
its transsynaptic retrograde spread (Kim et al., 2016; Wicker-
sham et al., 2007b). Then, we re-targeted the NAc in the two
hemispheres with either SiR or DG-rabies EnvA-pseudotyped vi-
ruses. In agreement with the known connectivity of this area
(Russo and Nestler, 2013), we identified transsynaptically
labeled neurons in various cortical and subcortical regions,
including the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and ventral tegmental
area (VTA). We focused on these two areas to quantify spreading
efficiency. At 1 week p.i., we observed no significant difference in
the spreading capabilities between SiR and the canonical B19
DG-rabies (Figures 4A, 4B, 4D, 4D0, 4F, 4F0, and 4I; one-way
ANOVA, F = 0.03, p = 0.96), indicating that the self-inactivating
nature of the SiR does not affect its ability to spread efficiently.
Moreover, as expected, by 3 weeks p.i., we observed a decrease
in the number of transsynaptically labeled neurons upon B19
DG-rabies infection due to neuronal loss, while no changes
upon SiR infection were detected (Figures 4C, 4E, 4E0, and
4G–4H; B19 DG-rabies, one-way ANOVA, F = 43, p = 6 3
10�5; SiR, one-way ANOVA, F = 0.03, p = 0.96).
Furthermore, we tested the transsynaptic spreading ability of
SiR also in hippocampal circuits by targeting the pyramidal layer
of CA1 of Rosa-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-YFP mice. As expected, we
identified neurons labeled by the SiR in the pyramidal layer of
CA3 (Figures S6A and S6A00), indicating specific transsynaptic
spreading. Presynaptic neurons were also identified in the
lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) as evidenced by YFP expression
(Figure S6A000). Importantly, SiR-infected starting cells in CA1
expressing TVA and G remained viable throughout the infec-
tion period (Figures S6B–S6B00). Thus, efficient transsynaptic

 spreading was compatible with long-term survival of the synap-
tically connected neurons.
The use of CRE recombinase in the SiR limits its application in
combination with available mouse CRE lines. This is a limiting
factor when trying to initiate the transsynaptic spreading from
genetically defined neuronal populations. To overcome this
shortcoming, we generated an SiR encoding for a FLP recombi-
nase and tested its efficiency. We specifically targeted CA1 py-
ramidal neurons by injecting a CRE-dependent AAV expressing
TVA and oG (AAV-FLEXTVA-oG) in CA1 of VGlut2::CRE mice, in
which the CRE recombinase is expressed in excitatory neurons
(Figure S6C). At the same time, we targeted the presynaptic area
CA3 with a FLP-dependent AAV encoding a nuclear-tagged GFP
(AAV-FRTnucGFP) (Figure S6C). The AAV-FRTnucGFP virus drives
GFP expression following a FLP-dependent recombination
event. We then injected SiRFLP (EnvA) in CA1 initiating the trans-
synaptic spreading selectively from TVA-expressing excitatory
neurons (Figures S6C and S6C0). Transsynaptically labeled neu-
rons can be observed in the CA3 presynaptic target area (Fig-
ure S6C00), proving the viability of the approach.
In order to confirm the general validity of this method, we
decided to use a distinct transgenic line to start the transsynaptic
spreading also from inhibitory neurons.

We first injected AAV-FLEXTVA-oG in the

target the inhibitory neuronal population
in this area. We then injected the AAV-
FRTnucGFP in a known presynaptic area,
the BLA (Figure S6D). Then, we specif-
ically targeted TVA-positive neurons with
SiRFLP (EnvA), thus initiating the transsy-
naptic spread selectively from NAc inhib-
itory neurons (Figures S6D and S6D0). This
led to efficient FLP-dependent transsy-
naptic labeling of neurons in BLA (Fig-
ure S6D00). Overall, these results confirm
the efficiency of a CRE- and FLP-depen-
dent combinatorial approach based on the use of SiRFLP in
conjunction with available CRE mouse lines, expanding the
range of use of the SiR.
Use of SiR as Retrograde Non-transsynaptic Tracer
Given the paucity of highly efficient and selective axonal retro-
grade viral tracers, we took advantage of the high affinity of the
rabies virus for axon terminals and assessed whether the SiR
can be used also as retrograde intraneuronal (non-transsynaptic)
tracer. To this aim, we pseudotyped the SiR with oG (Kim et al.,
2016). Using this approach, we mapped the synaptic inputs to
the VTA with SiR (oG) comparing its non-transsynaptic retro-
grade spreading efficiency with one of the most efficient retro-
grade viruses available to date, the rAAV2-retro (Tervo et al.,
2016). We focused our analysis on three known presynaptic
areas to VTA: the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the NAc,
and the lateral hypothalamus (LH) (Figure 4J) (Watabe-Uchida
et al., 2012). Overall, spreading efficiency is broadly comparable
between SiR and rAAV2-retro (Figure 4N). However, SiR was
more efficient in labeling subcortical structures such as LH and
NAc (LH, p = 0.18; NAc, p = 0.03; Figures 4L–4L00, 4M–4M00,
and 4N), with more than one order of magnitude of difference
in the case of the NAc to VTA circuit. On the other hand, the

 rAAV2-retro turned out to be more efficient in labeling cortical
targets such as the mPFC (p = 0.05, Figures 4K–4K00 and 4N).
Altogether, these data indicate that SiR also functions as a
highly effective retrograde axonal (non-transsynaptic) tracer.
Unaffected Neuronal and Synaptic Functions on SiR
Infection
While the absence of cytotoxicity and the maintenance of trans-
synaptic spreading ability of the SiR is encouraging for its use in
the functional manipulation of neural networks, we also wanted
to make sure that SiR has no long-term effects on neuronal phys-
iology. In order to do so, we injected SiRCRE in the pyramidal
layer of CA1 in Rosa-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-tdTomato mice. We
then compared the electrophysiological properties of infected
and non-infected neurons at 1 week and 5 months following
SiR infection. TomatoON neurons in CA1 were recorded in
whole-cell patch-clamp mode. All pyramidal CA1 neurons re-
corded showed regular spiking profiles (Figure 5A) with no signif-
icant difference among all tested conditions and time points
in the input resistance, resting membrane potential, spike
threshold, action potential amplitude and half-width, and instan-
taneous firing frequency (Figures 5B–5F; Table S2). Furthermore,
when SiRCRE was injected in Rosa-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-ChR2YFP
mice, ChR2 was successfully expressed in transduced neurons
(Figures 5G–5J). Brief light pulses (0.5–2 ms) lead to ChR2 direct
activation in transduced neurons and triggering of action poten-
tials with short latency (5.4 ± 0.6 ms spike-peak latency, Fig-
ure 5G–5H). Infected neurons could be activated at various
frequencies with similar reliability at both 1 week and 2 months
p.i. (Figure 5I). A key finding was that light activation of
SiRCRE-infected neurons elicited DNQX-sensitive excitatory
postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) (latency 6.8 ± 0.4 ms) in non-
infected neurons at 2 months p.i. (Figure 5J), indicating persis-
tence of functional connectivity and no adverse effects on syn-
aptic function.
Investigating Network Dynamics with SiR
The absence of cytotoxicity and unaltered electrophysiological
responses support the use of SiR for long-term circuit manipula-
tions. The presence of functional connectivity between SiR-in-
fected neurons and no adverse effects on synaptic properties
also indicate that network function is likely to be preserved
following SiR infection. In order to test whether network-depen-
dent computations are also preserved and whether SiR can be
used to monitor neural activity in vivo, we looked at a prototypi-
cal example of network-dependent computation, orientation
tuning in visual cortex. We first targeted V1 neurons projecting
to V2 (V1 > V2) by injecting oG pseudotyped SiRCRE in the V2
area of Rosa-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-tdTomato mice. At the same
time, we injected an AAVGCaMP6s in the ipsilateral V1 (Figure 6A).
Retrograde spreading of SiRCRE from V2 induced recombination
of the Rosa locus permanently labeling V1 > V2 neurons (Figures
6B–6B00; Movie S1). We then monitored the Ca2+ dynamics of
SiR-infected V1 > V2 neurons in vivo 4 weeks p.i., under a two-
photon microscope, while anesthetized animals were exposed
to moving gratings of different orientations across the visual
field (Figure 6C) (Benucci et al., 2009). Infected V1 > V2 neurons
showed significant increases in fluorescence at particular
grating orientations resulting in a cellular tuning curve show-
ing direction or orientation selectivity (Figures 6G and 6H).
Notably, recorded Ca2+ responses, as well as the percentage
of active neurons, were similar between SiR-traced neurons
(GCaMP6sON-tdTomatoON) and neighboring non-SiR V1 neu-
rons (GCaMP6sON-tdTomatoOFF) (Figures 6E and 6F). Further-
more, to exclude the possibility of long-term deleterious effects
on circuit function following SiR infection, we repeated functional
imaging experiments at 2 and 4 months p.i. (Figure S7). In both
cases, we found no significant difference in percentage of active
neurons or stimulus-driven responses between GCaMP6sON-
tdTomatoON and GCaMP6sON-tdTomatoOFF neurons (Figures
S7F–S7H00). These data indicate that SiR-traced networks pre-
serve unaltered computational properties and that SiR can be
used in combination with GCaMP6s to monitor the Ca2+ dynamic
with no upper bounds to the temporal window for the optical
investigation.
DISCUSSION
The development of monosynaptically restricted rabies viruses
has had a transformative effect on the study of neural circuits
(Miyamichi et al., 2011; Stepien et al., 2010; Tripodi et al.,
2011; Wickersham et al., 2007b). Until now, however, the
cellular cytotoxicity that accompanies rabies virus infection
effectively limited the temporal window for its use for the func-
tional interrogation of neural circuits. The induced cytotoxicity is
linked to the transcriptional activity of the virus. Replicative and
transcriptionally competent rabies viruses hijack the cellular
translational machinery to sustain their replication at the
expense of endogenous cellular translation (Komarova et al.,
2007). This affects cellular function, cellular transcriptional pro-
file, and eventually, neuronal function and survival. Therefore,
any replicative competent rabies virus, including less cytotoxic
strains (Reardon et al., 2016), will eventually compromise
cellular physiology within a particular time frame. In order to
gain life-long genetic and functional access to network ele-
ments defined topologically by rabies-dependent gene expres-
sion and in the absence of any adverse cytotoxic effects, we
developed a SiR that transcriptionally disappears from infected

 neurons shortly after the primary infection but has sufficient
transcriptional activity in those early stages to genetically tag in-
fected neurons for the long-term.
In line with the complete transcriptional silencing of the virus,
we observed no changes in the electrophysiological signature
between infected and uninfected neurons 1 week post infection,
when viral transcription is dampened but still present, and
5 months after infection, a time point at which the SiR has
switched OFF but that is well beyond the survival window of neu-
rons infected with canonical B19 DG-rabies (Wickersham et al.,
2007a). Moreover, we showed that SiR virus can be employed in
long-term studies using optogenetics with no reduction in the
reliability of optical stimulation and, most importantly, maintain-
ing the synaptic function and integrity that is key for physiological
and behavioral studies. By using SiR to monitor calcium dy-
namics in vivo, we show that circuit-dependent responses of

 infected neurons, such as visual tuning to moving stimuli, remain
unaffected after viral infection.
The unique features of the SiR make it the ideal tool for long-
term functional and genetic modification of neural networks.
Such interventions may include the functional manipulation of
neural circuits with light-activated opsins or chemically gated
channels as well as the study of long-term network activity using
genetically encoded calcium indicators (Emiliani et al., 2015; Luo
et al., 2008; Packer et al., 2013, 2015) (Figure 7A). With the ca-
nonical B19 DG-rabies, the safe temporal window that ensures
near-physiological neuronal responses and minimal neuronal
loss has been reported to be between 5–15 days from the infec-
tion, with slight differences between reports, possibly reflecting
different sensitivity of distinct neuronal populations (Kiritani
et al., 2012; Namburi et al., 2015; Tian et al., 2016; Wertz et al.,
2015). The use of the recently introduced DG-rabies strain
variant CVS-N2cDG has been reported to push the useful tempo-
ral window for imaging further up to 17 days post infection (Rear-
don et al., 2016). With SiR, traced neurons remain healthy indef-
initely, and there are no upper bounds to the temporal window for
the optical or functional investigation of neural circuits in physio-
logical conditions except for those imposed by the imaging
approach itself and the expressed transgene of choice.
SiR also makes it possible to knockout genes of interest in a
circuit-specific manner via genomic recombination of a condi-
tional cassette, for the first time without any associated neuronal
loss or temporal constraints (Figure 7B). In addition, the uniquely
transient transcriptional nature of SiR combined with permanent
CRE-dependent tracing offers the possibility to trace recurrently
the circuit upstream of a defined entry node over time, leaving a
permanent snapshot of the network topology at each iteration
(Figure 7C). This feature may be exploited to follow circuit re-
modeling after physiological or pathological structural plasticity,
such as during development, upon learning or following trau-
matic brain injuries.
Switching OFF viral transcription is not only instrumental to
abolish cell death and preserve neuronal function, but it also
eliminates the problem of the rabies-mediated inhibitory effect
on the cellular translational machinery (Komarova et al., 2007).
Moreover, a further advantage of the self-inactivating nature of
the virus is that it may allow for lowering the biosafety require-
ment for its production. We show that upon infection in vivo,
there are no detectable viral particles in the injected brain tissue
after 2 weeks from the primary infection, which may lead to
downgrading SiR safety level.
One caveat to consider when using SiR is that, while our
design produces a neurotropic virus that has no adverse effects
on neuronal function and survival, this is at the cost of switching
OFF its own transcription. Therefore, the delivery of transgenes
of interest must be achieved in a combinatorial manner by mak-
ing use either of floxed viral cassettes (i.e., AAVs) or of transgenic
conditional mouse lines. Notably, we successfully implemented
both strategies in this study.
Our findings establish SiR as a tool that provides functional
and genetic access to traced network elements safely in vivo
for the lifetime of the animal, with no cytotoxic effects, no
changes in the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of the
infected neurons, and no adverse effects on network function

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Animal strains
Male mice aged between 8 and 12 weeks from of the following lines were used: C57BL/6 wild-type (WT), Rosa-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-
tdTomato (Jackson: Gt(ROSA)26Sortm14(CAG tdTomato), Rosa-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-YFP (Jackson: Gt(ROSA)26Sor < tm1(EYFP)
Cos > ), Rosa-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-ChR2-YFP (Jackson: B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm32(CAG-COP4*H134R/EYFP)Hze/J), VGAT::CRE
(Jackson: Slc32a1tm2(cre)Lowl), VGlut2::CRE (Jackson: Slc17a6tm2(cre)Lowl). All transgenic mice were isogenic in a C57BL/6
background, maintained in pathogen and opportunistic agents-free conditions and monitored quarterly. All procedures were con-
ducted in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific procedures) Act 1986 and European Community Council Directive on Animal
Care. Animals were group-housed in a 12 hr light/dark cycle with food and water ad libitum.
Cell lines
HEK293T cells and BHK-21 were purchased from ATTC. All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM, GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, GIBCO) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (GIBCO) unless other-
wise stated. HEK293T packaging cells expressing Rabies glycoprotein (HEK-GG) were generated by lentivirus infection with
Lenti-H2BGFP-2A-GlySAD (Table S1) and after 3 passages GFP expressing cells were selected by fluorescent activated cell sorting
(FACS). HEK293T packaging cells expressing Rabies glycoprotein and TEV protease (HEK-TGG) were generated from HEK-GG by
lentivirus infection with Lenti-puro-2A-TEVp and selected, after 3 passages, with 1 mg/mL of puromycin added to the media
for 1 week.
BHK-21 packaging cells for pseudotyping Rabies virus with optimized G (BHK-TGoG) were generated with the same procedure as
the HEK-TGG by the infection first with Lenti-H2BGFP-2A-oG and subsequently with Lenti-puro-2A-TEVp. BHK packaging cells for
pseudotyping Rabies virus with EnvA receptor (BHK-T-EnvA) were obtained infecting BHK-EnvA with Lenti-puro-2A-TEVp and se-
lecting with puromycin.
METHOD DETAILS
First generation DG-NPESTRabies. In vitro and in vivo tests of cytotoxicity
In order to obtain conditional regulation of viral protein stability, in addition to the C-Terminal PEST domain (see main text), a SPLIT-
TEVp cassette (Gray et al., 2010) was cloned in the DG-Rabies genome. A tag (myc, FLAG or V5) was also fused to the N-terminal of
each viral protein. The SPLIT-TEVp dimeric protease is only active in presence of rapamycin and could potentially provide a tool for
the exogenous regulation of viral protein stability during production and in vivo. We first tested the capability of the SPLIT-TEVp ex-
pressed by plasmid to cleave a TEVp activity reporter in HEK293T cells (Figure S2B), then we tested the ability of the virally expressed
cassette to cleave the TEVp activity reporter (Figure S2C).
In order to probe the effect of protein destabilization on neuronal survival, we infected human Embryonic Stem cells (hESCs)
derived neurons with DG-NPESTRabiesSPLIT-TEVp-mCherry. We performed a longitudinal study of the survival of infected neurons and
compared survival rate to a control DG-Rabies. Neurons were infected and imaged longitudinally at 4, 10 and 16 days to evaluate
the cell death (Figures S3A–S3C00). Lentivirus expressing GFP was used to normalize infection rates in order to account for cell death
due to the prolonged manipulation and repeated over-night imaging sessions. Only 26% ± 4% of control DG-Rabies infected neurons
were still detectable at 16 days post-infection (N = 3, n = 781 for each condition; Figures S3C–S3C00 and S3D). On the contrary, the
DG-NPESTRabiesSPLIT-TEVp-mCherry virus showed no significant cell loss after 16 days (94% ± 6%, N = 3, n = 917 for each condition,
Figures S3B–S3B00 and S3D) and a significant increase in cell survival compared to DG-Rabies control (p = 3.2x10�5; paired two-
tailed Student’s t test).
To understand if the reduced cytotoxicity of DG-NPESTRabiesSPLIT-TEVp-mCherry is associated with a reduction of the viral transcrip-
tion, we monitored the intensity of the reporter expressed in neurons infected with the control DG-Rabies and the DG-NPESTRabiesS-
PLIT-TEVp-mCherry viruses which share the same expression cassette (Figure S3E). Over time the mean mCherry signal of DG-NPESTRa-
biesSPLIT-TEVp-mCherry infected cells resulted to be significantly lower than controls (mCherry intensity at 10 days, DG-Rabies 138% ±
3%, DG-NPESTRabiesSPLIT-TEVp-mCherry87% ± 7%, p = 0.01; N = 3, n = 584 for each condition; paired two-tailed Student’s t test).
We then tested the performance of the DG-NPESTRabiesSPLIT-TEVp-mCherry virus in vivo.
We replaced the mCherry gene in the DG-NPESTRabiesSPLIT-TEVp-mCherry virus with the CRE recombinase (DG-NPEST
RabiesSPLIT-TEVp-CRE). This ensures that infected neurons can be permanently labeled after a complete transcriptional shut down
of the virus, allowing for the discrimination between viral silencing and cell death. We injected DG-NPESTRabiesSPLIT-TEVp-CRE in
CA1 of Rosa-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-tdTomato reporter mouse line in CA1 in the hippocampus (Figure S3F). We observed a significant
increase in neuronal survival upon DG-NPESTRabiesSPLIT-TEVp-CRE infection compared to that observed upon infection with control

 DG Rabies (25% ± 2%, at 2 weeks for DG-NPESTRabiesSPLIT-TEVp-CRE and 8% ± 3%, at 2 weeks for DG Rabies p = 7x10�3, Figures
S3G–S3I). However prominent neuronal loss was still present upon DG-NPESTRabiesSPLIT-TEVp-CRE infection (76% ± 3%, at 3 weeks,
p = 9x10�4, Figures S3H–S3H00 and S3I).
The residual cytotoxicity of DG-NPESTRabiesSPLIT-TEVp-CRE might be linked to a constitutive low basal dimerization and activity of
the SPLIT-TEVp cassette and can give origin to transcriptionally active viral particles. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed
no significant effect on neuronal survival and mCherry expression levels in presence or absence of rapamycin (mCherry expression
10 days p.i. DG-NPESTRabiesSPLIT-TEVp -RAP 87% ± 7%, DG-NPESTRabiesSPLIT-TEVp +RAP 85% ± 6%, p = 0.21; N = 3, n = 793 for each
condition; paired two-tailed Student’s t test; Figure S3E) and no significant effects on cells survival were associated with the
rapamycin administration in hESCs derived neurons (at 16 days; DG-Rabies+RAP 26% ± 4%, DG-Rabies-RAP 30% ± 7%, p = 0.69;
DG-NPESTRabiesSPLIT-TEVp +RAP 88% ± 11%, DG-NPESTRabiesSPLIT-TEVp -RAP 94% ± 6%, p = 0.79; N = 3, n = 833 for each condition;
paired two-tailed Student’s t test, Figure S3D). Furthermore, we observed a constitutive low level of TEVp activity in HEK293T cells in
absence of Rapamycin (Figure S2B, line 2) indicating a basal level of Rapamycin-independent SPLIT-TEVp dimerization. Overall
these results indicate that DG-NPESTRabiesSPLIT-TEVp has reduced cytotoxicity in hESCs derived neurons and in vivo when compared
to DG-Rabies. However, it fails to completely switch off following the infection, which leads to significantly delayed, yet still present,
neuronal cytotoxicity and neuronal loss. For these reasons we generated a second generation of DG-NPESTRabies by removing the
leaking SPLIT-TEVp and replacing it with an mCherry-CRE cassette giving origin to a Self inactivating DG-Rabies virus (SiR) with the
desired ON-OFF and TEVp dependent kinetics (main text).
Design and generation of DG-Rabies and lentivirus plasmids
All the attenuated Rabies plasmids, listed in Table S1, were generated by Gibson cloning using pSAD-DG-F3 plasmid (Osakada et al.,
2011) as starting material. Briefly, the Rabies genome was PCR amplified in 2 fragments starting from the protein to be tagged. These
fragments were then mixed with the tag and/or PEST domain obtained by oligonucleotides annealing and assembled using Gibson
master mix (NEB).
The lentiviral vectors used to generate the packaging cells were derived from a 3rd generation lentivirus transfer vector (gift from
Michael Hastings ‘‘361 polylinker,’’ originally pCCL-SIN-18PPT.Pgk.EGFP-WPRE). All the lentiviral vectors were generated by
Gibson assembly, opening the backbone by digestion with XbaI and KpnI and PCR amplifying the CMV promoter and the different
inserts.
Viral Screening and proteasome inhibition
For screening of attenuated DG-Rabies viruses, HEK-GG or HEK-TGG cells were co-transfected with rabies genome vector, pcDNA-
T7, pcDNA-SADB19N, pcDNA-SADB19P, pcDNA-SADB19L, and pcDNA-SADB19G (Osakada et al., 2011) and maintained at 37�C
with 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (GIBCO) and 100 u/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin. The day
after transfection and subsequently every 3 days, cells were washed with PBS, treated with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and replated in a
new dish in a ratio 1:3. After splitting, cells were maintained for one day at 37�C and 5% CO2 and then 2 days at 35�C and 3% CO2.
Every 3 days cells were fixed with 4%PFA and viral spreading was assessed by FACS sorting the cells for mCherry expression.
For testing the proteasome dependence of attenuated DG-Rabies virus conditional inactivation, HEK-GG cells were co-trans-
fected and processed as described before for the viral screening. At 3 days post transfection cells were treated with 10-100-
250 nM of MG-132 (Sigma) or vehicle (0 nM condition, DMSO) in the medium until the end of the experiment. For the 250 nM
MG-132 condition every 48 hr of incubation in DMEM supplemented with MG-132 cells were washed with PBS once and incubated
in DMEM 10% FBS for 24 hr.
Viral productions
For the recovery of high titer DG-Rabies, HEK-GG or HEK-TGG for control or attenuated Rabies respectively, were infected in 10 cm
dishes at 70%–80% confluence with 1 mL of viral supernatant obtained as described in the viral screening section. Cells were split
the day after infection and maintained for 1 or 2 days at 37�C and 5% CO2 checking daily the viral spreading. When 70%–80% of cells
expressed the viral marker, the media was replaced with 2% FBS DMEM and maintained for 2 days at 35�C and 3% CO2. Then, the
viral supernatant was collected, cell debris removed by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 10 min followed by filtration with 0.45 mm filter
and the virus concentrated by ultracentrifugation on a sucrose cushion as described before (Wickersham et al., 2007a).
Rabies viruses pseudotyped with oG were produced infecting BHK-TGoG cells in 10 cm dishes with 1 mL of viral supernatant. Cells
were split the day after infection and maintained for one or two days at 37�C and 5% CO2 checking daily the viral spreading. When
70%–80% of cells expressed the viral marker, the media was replaced with 2% FBS DMEM and maintained for 2-3 days at 35�C and
3% CO2. Then, the supernatant was collected and processed as previously described.
Rabies viruses pseudotyped with EnvA were produced as previously described (Wickersham et al., 2007a) using BHK-T-EnvA cells
instead of BHK-EnvA cells.
In vitro cytotoxicity analysis
Human Embryonic Stem cells (hESCs) derived neurons were kindly provided by Dr. Rick Livesey. Cells were plated in 24-wells glass
bottom plates and infected over-night with attenuated or control DG-Rabies viruses supernatants at comparable MOI to obtain �5%
e4
Cell 170, 382–392.e1–e7, July 13, 2017
 of infected cells. Cells were imaged every 4 days post infection overnight in a 37�C heated Leica SP8 confocal microscope in
Hibernate�-A Medium (Invitrogen) with 5 random fields imaged for each well. Cells survival was calculated normalizing each condi-
tion to the mortality of control LentivirusGFP infected hESCs derived neurons imaged and processed in the same conditions.
Immunohistochemistry
Mice were perfused with ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains were incu-
bated in PFA overnight at 4�C, rinsed twice with PBS and then dehydrated for 48 hr in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4�C. The brains were
frozen in O.C.T. compound (VWR) and sliced at the cryostat (Leica, Germany). Free-floating sections were rinsed in PBS and then
incubated in blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) containing primary antibodies for 24 hr
at 4�C. Sections were washed with PBS three times and incubated for 24 hr at 4�C in blocking solution with secondary antibodies.
Immuno-labeled sections were washed three times with PBS and mounted on glass slides. Antibodies used in this study were
chicken anti-GFP (Thermo Scientific, A10262, 1:1000), rabbit anti-RFP (Rockland, 600-401-379, 1:2000), donkey anti-chicken alexa
488 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 703-545-155, 1:1000), donkey anti-rabbit Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 711-165-152, 1:1000)
and rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 (NEB, #9661, 1:500).
Viral injections
All procedures using live animals were approved by the Home Office and the LMB Biosafety committee. For all experiments mice
aged between 6-12 weeks were used. Mice were anesthetized with isofluorane delivered at a flow of 3% in 2L/min of oxygen for
the initial induction and then maintained at 1%–2% in 2 L/min of oxygen. The anesthetized animal was placed into a stereotaxic appa-
ratus (David Kopf Instruments) and Rimadyl (2 mg/kg body weight) was administered subcutaneously (s.c.) as anti-inflammatory. A
small hole (500 mm diameter) was drilled and viruses were injected using a Hamilton neurosyringe. The syringe was left in the brain for
5 min before being retracted. Viruses were injected at the following titers: 3x108 infectious units/ml for Rabies viruses, 2x1012
genomic copies/ml for AAVs, 3x108 infectious units/ml for Lentiviruses. Up to a max of 400 nL in volume of virus were injected in
the following brain areas: CA1 (AP: �2.3 mm, ML: 1.65 mm and DV: 1.45mm from bregma), V1 (AP: �3.3 mm, ML: 2.8 mm and
DV: 0.25 mm from brain surface), V2 (AP: �3.6 mm, ML: 1.2 mm, DV:0.6 mm from bregma), NAc (AP: 1.3 mm, ML: 1.3 mm and
DV: 4.75 mm from bregma), VTA (AP: �3.2 mm, ML: 0.45 mm and DV: 4.35 mm from bregma), BLA (AP: �1.65 mm, ML: 2.9 mm
and DV: 4.7 mm from bregma).
In vivo cytotoxicity analysis
To test the in vivo viral cytotoxicity, 400 nL of same titer (3x108 infectious units/ml) attenuated and control DG-Rabies were injected in
CA1 area of the hippocampus in both hemispheres. At 1-2-3 weeks or 2-6 months p.i. brains were collected and sectioned at the
cryostat (35 mm). Infected neurons were imaged sampling the entire hippocampus (acquiring one every 4 sections) using a robot as-
sisted Nikon HCA microscope mounting a 10x (0.45NA) air objective and fluorescent hippocampal neurons counted using Nikon HCA
analysis software. Cell survival for attenuated and control DG-Rabies was calculated normalizing each time point to the mortality of
control Lentivirus-GFP infected hippocampi using the same injection protocol.
To confirm no cytotoxic effect upon SiR infection in hippocampus, brains slices at 1 and 2 weeks p.i. were stained with anti-cleaved
caspase-3 (cCaspase3, 1:500). Confocal images were acquired using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope mounting a 20X (0.75NA) air
objective and the total number of cCaspase3 positive neurons counted in PBS, SiR or DG-Rabies injected hippocampi.
Drug induced reactivation of SiR virus in vivo
Rosa-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-YFP animals were injected in CA1 of hippocampus with an AAV expressing constitutively rtTA and TEV pro-
tease under the control of a doxycycline inducible promoter (Table S1). 1-week p.i. the same area was re-injected with SiRCRE-mCherry
and doxycycline (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 100 mg/Kg) administered by oral gavage at 1 or 2 weeks post SiR injection. 1 week after
drug administration brains were collected and sectioned at the cryostat (35 mm). Infected neurons were imaged and counted sam-
pling the entire hippocampus (acquiring one every 4 sections) using a robot assisted Nikon HCA microscope.
Transsynaptic and intraneuronal retrograde tracing
To test the in vivo retrograde transsynaptic viral spreading efficiency, 400 nL of AAVTVA-oG were injected in the NAc contralateral in the
2 hemispheres of Rosa-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-tdTomato animals. At 3 weeks post-AAV injection, TVA expressing cells were targeted in
the 2 hemispheres with 400 nL of same titer (3x108 infectious units/ml) SiRCRE or control DG-RabiesGFP. At 1 and 3 weeks p.i. brains
were collected and sectioned at the cryostat (35 mm). Transsynaptic spreading and neuronal survival were assessed by imaging SiR
or DG-Rabies infected neurons in the NAc, BLA and VTA (acquiring one every 2 sections) using a robot assisted Nikon HCA micro-
scope mounting a 10x (0.45NA) air objective and ipsilateral fluorescent neurons counted using Nikon HCA analysis software. Trans-
synaptic spreading efficiency was calculated by dividing the number of inputs neurons in the BLA or VTA by the number of starting
neurons and normalized to SiR efficiency.
To test the in vivo intraneuronal retrograde viral efficiency, 400 nL of SiRCRE (8.5x108 infectious units/ml) or 400 nL of rAAV2-retro-
nucGFP (4x1012 genomic copies/ml) were injected in the VTA of Rosa-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-tdTomato mice.
Cell 170, 382–392.e1–e7, July 13, 2017
e5
 At 1 and 3 weeks p.i., for SiR and rAAV2-retro respectively, brains were collected and sectioned at the cryostat (35 mm). Retrograde
spreading was assessed by imaging SiR and DG-Rabies infected neurons in the NAc, mPFC and LH (acquiring one every 4 sections)
using a robot assisted Nikon HCA microscope mounting a 10x (0.45NA) air objective and fluorescent neurons were counted using
Nikon HCA analysis software.
Analysis of SiR genomic copies in vivo
To evaluate the genomic copies of SiR virus in the infected animals over time, SiRCRE-mCherry was injected in the CA1 region of hip-
pocampus of Rosa-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-YFP animals. After 1, 2, 3 or 8 weeks, mice were culled and the injected hippocampi manually
dissected immediately after. The hippocampi were homogenized using a Tissuelyser II (QIAGEN) and processed accordingly to
manufactory instruction with RNeasy kit (QIAGEN) to extract total RNA. 500 ng of RNA per hippocampus were retrotranscribed using
superscript IV kit (Invitrogen) and analyzed for GADPH, YFP and mCherry expression by quantitative PCR (rotorgene sybr-green). The
Livak method was applied for quantification: the expression of YFP and mCherry was normalized to the expression of the GADPH
housekeeping gene (DCT = CTgene - CTGADPH) and the variation over time as fold change (2-DDCT) to the 1 week time point
(DDCT = DCTTime point – DCT1 week).
Electrophysiology
For electrophysiological recordings, SiRCRE-mCherry was injected bilaterally in the CA1 of one month-old Rosa-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-
tdTomato or Rosa-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-ChR2YFP mice. Recordings were made either one week or 2 and 5 months p.i.
Coronal hippocampal slices (350 mm) were prepared using a vibrating microtome (7000smz-2, Campden Instruments LTD, Lough-
borough, UK) in ice-cold sucrose-based cutting solution oxygenated with carbogen gas (95% O2, 5% CO2) and with the following
composition (in mM): KCl 3, NaH2PO4 1.25, MgSO4 2, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 1, NaHCO3 26.4, glucose 10, sucrose 206, ascorbic acid
0.40, kynurenic acid 1. Slices were incubated at 37�C for 30 min in a submerged-style holding chamber with oxygenated artificial
cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; in mM: NaCl 126, KCl 3, NaH2PO4 1.25, MgSO4 2, CaCl2 2, NaHCO3 26.4, glucose 10) with an osmolarity
adjusted to 280-300 mOsm/L and stored thereafter in the same holding chamber at room temperature for at least 1 hr. Slices were
then individually transferred to the recording chamber and were perfused with oxygenated aCSF at room temperature at a flow-rate
of approximately 2 mL/min.
Whole-cell current-clamp recordings were obtained from CA1 neurons using 6-9 MU pipettes pulled from borosilicate glass cap-
illaries (1.5 mm OD x 0.86 mm ID). Pipettes were filled with artificial intracellular solution containing (in mM): K-gluconate 150, HEPES
10, NaCl 4, ATP-Mg 4, GTP-Na 0.3 and EGTA 0.2; adjusted to pH 7.2 and osmolarity 270-290 mOsm/L. Data were recorded using an
Axon Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA, USA) and signals were low-pass filtered at 2 kH and acquired at
5 kHz using a digitizer (Axon Digidata 1550A, Molecular Devices, Union City, CA, USA) on a PC running pClamp. Light-evoked re-
sponses from neurons infected with SiR virus were elicited using a 450-490 nm LED light (pE-300 coolLED system, Scientifica
Ltd, Uckfield, UK) through a 40X water immersion objective (0.8 NA).
In Figure 5K, putative postsynaptic neurons were pre-screened on the basis of being mCherryOFF and in proximity of presynaptic
mCherryON. Latencies from the onset of the optical stimulation were then assessed.
Pharmacology
The AMPA receptor antagonist DNQX (20 mM) was used in a subset of electrophysiological recordings in order to probe synaptic
connectivity between neurons infected with SiR virus and neighboring neurons.
In vivo 2-photon imaging
Injected Rosa-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-tdTomato mice (see Viral injections section) were anesthetized with isofluorane 2%. Animal pinch
withdrawal and eyelid reflex were tested to assay the depth of anesthesia. Rimadyl (2 mg/kg body weight) was injected subcutane-
ously as an anti-inflammatory. Both eyes were covered with an eye ointment to prevent corneal desiccation during the experiment.
The animal was head-fixed and a metal head-post cemented to the skull. A craniotomy of 4 mm in diameter was drilled over the V1
cortex. After the removal of the skull, the cortical surface was kept moist with a cortex buffer, containing: 125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl,
10 mM Glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgSO4 and 2 mM CaCl2, adjusted to pH 7.3. The cortex was then covered with a custom
made plug coverslip (Goldey et al., 2014) and sealed with Super Glue and dental cement. Mice were anesthetized with 2% of iso-
fluorane and mounted under a two-photon laser-scanning microscope (Multiphoton Imaging System, Scientifica, Uckfield, United
Kingdom) equipped with a Ti:sapphire mode-locked laser (Mai Tai-Series, Spectra Physics) tuned at 920 nm. Imaging was performed
through a water-immersion lens (Nikon, 16X, 0.8 NA) at a resolution of 256 3 256 pixels with zoom 2 or 4, leading to a field of view of
390 3 390 mm and 195 3 195 mm respectively. Data were acquired at 3.5 Hz. The objective was shielded with a black fabric cone
equipped with a plastic o-ring fixed onto the head plate (Andermann et al., 2010). Visual stimulation was controlled using a
custom-made GUI in Python (based on PsychoPy toolbox) and was performed with a LED screen positioned 15 cm from the left
eye of the mouse. Moving square-wave gratings were presented at 12 directions in 30 degrees steps and a photodiode was used
to detect the starting and the ending time of each stimulus. Each grating direction was presented 5 times in random order alternated
with a blank condition. The spatial frequency of the grating was 0.04 cycles per degree (cpd) and the temporal frequency was 1 Hz.
Imaging and visual stimulation were triggered together using Arduino micro-controller board. Imaging session lasted up to 2 hr and
e6

 the power at sample was controlled in the range 30-40 mW. Data analysis was performed in ImageJ and MATLAB and was restricted
to cell bodies. Detection of region of interest (ROI) was performed with Suite2p (Pachitariu et al., 2016). The relative changes in fluo-
rescence were calculated as dF/F0 = (F(t)-F0)/(F0). Orientation tuning curves were generated by taking the mean response for each
orientation during the entire stimulus period. Response amplitudes are presented as the relative change in fluorescence during the
stimulus period compared to the pre-stimulus baseline (dF/F). All data are presented as mean ± SEM.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Mean values are accompanied by SEM. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes. Data collection and analysis
were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments. Statistical analysis was performed in R and/or MATLAB. Paired t test
and one-way ANOVA test were used to test for statistical significance when appropriate. Statistical parameters including the exact
value of n, precision measures (mean ± SEM) and statistical significance are reported in the text and in the figure legends (see indi-
vidual sections). The significance threshold was placed at a = 0.05.
