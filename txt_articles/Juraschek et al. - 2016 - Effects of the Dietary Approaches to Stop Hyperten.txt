Objective. Randomized trial data guiding dietary
recommendations to lower serum uric acid (UA), the etio-
logic precursor of gout, are scarce. We undertook this
study to examine the effects of the Dietary Approaches to
Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet (a well-established diet
that lowers blood pressure) and levels of sodium intake
on serum UA.
Methods. We conducted an ancillary study of a
randomized, crossover feeding trial in 103 adults with
prehypertension or stage I hypertension. Participants
were randomly assigned to receive either the DASH diet
or a control diet (typical of the average American diet)
and were further fed low, medium, and high levels of
sodium for 30 days, each in random order. Body weight
was kept constant. Serum UA levels were measured at
baseline and following each feeding period.
Results. Trial participants were 55% women and
75% black with a mean6 SD age of 51.56 9.7 years and a
mean6 SD serum UA level of 5.06 1.3 mg/dl. The DASH
diet reduced serum UA (20.35 mg/dl [95% confidence
interval (95% CI) 20.65, 20.05], P5 0.02), with a higher
effect (21.29 mg/dl [95% CI 22.50, 20.08]) among par-
ticipants (n5 8) with a baseline serum UA level of
‡7 mg/dl. Increasing sodium intake from the low level
decreased serum UA during the medium sodium intake
period (20.3 mg/dl [95% CI 20.5, 20.2], P< 0.001) and
during the high sodium intake period (20.4 mg/dl [95%
CI 20.6, 20.3], P< 0.001).
Conclusion. The DASH diet lowered serum UA,
and this effect was greater among participants with hyper-
uricemia. Moreover, we found that higher sodium intake
decreased serum UA, which enhances our knowledge of
urate pathophysiology and risk factors for hyperuricemia.
Serum uric acid (UA) is an important factor in the
causal pathway for gout (1). Furthermore, serum UA has
been implicated as a potential risk factor and/or mediator
of cardiovascular disease outcomes and mortality in a
large number of observational studies (2–6). Although
many of the clinical trials targeting serum UA reduction
have focused on pharmacologic interventions (7–9), diet
has long been identified as an important determinant of
the serum UA level (10). However, much of the dietary
evidence on serum UA reduction is derived from observa-
tional studies (11–13). There is little evidence from ran-
domized clinical trials in support of dietary interventions
to lower serum UA. Moreover, prior intervention studies
have focused on isolated micronutrients such as vitamin C
(14,15) or food types such as dairy products (16). It
remains unknown whether adopting a healthful dietary
pattern might effectively lower serum UA.
The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
(DASH)–sodium trial was a clinical feeding study designed
to examine the impact of the DASH diet and vary-
ing amounts of sodium consumption on blood pressure
(17). In the original trial, participants consumed either
the DASH diet or a control diet (typical of the average
American diet) with each of 3 sodium levels: 60, 120,

 and 180 mmoles/day (based on a 2,600 kcal diet). The
trial found that the DASH diet lowered blood pressure
substantially and that low sodium consumption further
lowered blood pressure (17). Ultimately, the DASH diet
redefined national dietary guidelines for the prevention
of cardiovascular disease, and it has been adopted and
nationally disseminated by the National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute (NHLBI) as the diet that should be
implemented as the optimal nonpharmacologic ap-
proach to prevent and treat hypertension and lower
cholesterol.
In this ancillary study of the DASH–sodium trial,
we examine the effect of the DASH diet, as well as that
of varying sodium intake, on the serum UA level. We
hypothesized that the DASH diet would lower UA lev-
els as it contains many dietary components observed to
be associated with lower UA levels (e.g., lower red meat
[purine] consumption, greater low-fat dairy consump-
tion, and higher intake of vitamin C–containing fruits
and vegetables). We also hypothesized that reducing
sodium intake would lower UA levels, given its associa-
tion with high blood pressure.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
DASH–sodium was an investigator-initiated, multicen-
ter, randomized trial sponsored by the NHLBI from September
1997 through November 1999 (17). Briefly, DASH–sodium
compared the effects of 3 levels of sodium intake on blood pres-
sure in 2 distinct diets among adults with prehypertension or
stage I hypertension (systolic blood pressure of 120–159 mm Hg
or diastolic blood pressure of 80–95 mm Hg). The intervention
diet was the DASH diet, emphasizing fruits, vegetables, and
low-fat dairy foods and reduced consumption of saturated fat,
total fat, and cholesterol; the control diet was typical of the
average diet in the United States (18). The DASH diet also
included whole grains, poultry, fish, and nuts and contained
smaller amounts of red meat, sweets, and sugar-containing
beverages than the typical diet in the United States. Participants
were fed each of 3 sodium levels: low (a target of 60 mmoles/
day), medium (a target of 120 mmoles/day), and high (a target
of 180 mmoles/day). The high sodium level (180 mmoles/day)
reflected typical sodium intake of a United States adult consum-
ing 2,600 kcal/day of food. The daily sodium intake was adjusted
to reflect the total energy requirements of each participant,
such that larger or more active participants received more food
and sodium than did smaller and less active participants. Nutri-
ent composition of the diets is shown in Table 1.
Participants.
In the original study, adult men and
women age $22 years were recruited at 4 clinical centers.
Based on 3 screening visits, all participants had an average sys-
tolic blood pressure of 120–159 mm Hg and an average dia-
stolic blood pressure of 80–95 mm Hg. Persons with a prior
diagnosis of heart disease, renal insufficiency, poorly con-
trolled dyslipidemia, or diabetes mellitus were excluded (17).
Persons using antihypertensive agents or insulin or drinking
.14 alcoholic beverages a week were also excluded.
This secondary analysis was limited to participants
recruited at the Johns Hopkins University clinical center in
Baltimore, MD, which analyzed serum specimens for UA collected
as part of a comprehensive metabolic panel. The Institutional
Review Board at Johns Hopkins University approved the original
study protocol including subsequent analysis of stored specimens.
Written informed consent was provided by all participants.
Controlled feeding.
Participants were provided all of
their food, which included snacks and meals. Following a
2-week run-in period during which participants ate the high-
sodium, control diet, they were randomly assigned to either the
DASH diet or the control diet according to a parallel-arm
design. These diets were consumed at each of the 3 sodium lev-
els for 30 days in random order following a crossover design.
Each sodium level was separated by a 5-day washout period.
Participants resumed their home diets during the 5-day washout
periods. Caloric intake was adjusted to maintain a constant
weight throughout the trial. In the original study, .98% of par-
ticipants completed each of the intervention periods (17).
Measurement of serum UA level. At baseline and at
the end of each sodium intake period, participants presented
to the clinical center for phlebotomy (1997–1999). After par-
ticipants had fasted, serum specimens were collected and then
centrifuged, aliquoted, and immediately delivered to Quest
Diagnostics for analysis without freezing or storage. UA levels
were measured via spectrophotometry.
Other covariate measurements and definitions. Addi-
tional covariates were ascertained via questionnaire, labora-
tory specimens, and physical examination. Blood pressure was
the primary outcome of the original DASH–sodium trial.
Blood pressure was recorded using random-zero, mercury
sphygmomanometers while participants were seated at 3
screening visits, twice during the run-in period, weekly during
the first 3 weeks of each of the 3 30-day intervention periods,
and at five clinic visits during the last 9 days (at least 2 during
the final 4 days) of each intervention period. A high blood

 pressure at baseline was defined as a mean systolic blood pres-
sure of $140 mm Hg or a mean diastolic blood pressure of
$90 mm Hg.
In addition to blood pressure, body mass index (BMI)
was derived from standardized measurements of height and
weight. Further, standard laboratory assays and techniques
were used to measure serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen,
fasting glucose, and fasting triglycerides. Glomerular filtration
rate was estimated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epide-
miology Collaboration serum creatinine equation (19).
Statistical analysis.
Study population characteristics
were described using the mean6 SD and proportions. When
evaluating the effect of the DASH diet on UA level, the primary
comparison was change in UA level from baseline (i.e., end of
period measured at the end of each sodium intake period minus
baseline) between the DASH diet and the control diet. When
evaluating the impact of sodium intake on UA level, the pri-
mary comparisons were within-person UA levels measured at
the end of the high sodium intake period versus the end of the
low sodium intake period. Comparisons of high sodium versus
medium sodium and medium sodium versus low sodium were
secondary. As there was no evidence of effect modification by
diet on the relationship between sodium level and UA level, we
present the overall sodium effects (rather than stratified by
diet). Carryover effects for the crossover design involving
sodium levels were assessed with interaction terms involving
visit and assignment order. These terms were not significant,
suggesting that there were no order or carryover effects.
We also performed prespecified subgroup analyses to
assess for effect modification of baseline covariates known to
influence UA concentrations, including sex (male, female),
race (white, black), baseline serum UA concentration (,4,
4 to ,5, 5 to ,6, 6 to ,7, and $7 mg/dl), BMI category
(,30 kg/m2, $30 kg/m2), and baseline hypertension status.
These comparisons were exploratory for the purpose of inter-
preting and elucidating the primary results.
All analyses were performed with Stata software, ver-
sion 14.0 (StataCorp). Comparisons of serum UA levels across
diets at single sodium levels (i.e., baseline, low, medium, or
high) were performed using t-tests following the trial’s parallel
design. All other comparisons of serum UA levels were per-
formed using generalized estimating equation regression mod-
els with a Huber-White robust variance estimator (20), which
assumed an exchangeable working correlation matrix. Note
that the robust variance estimator allows the model to produce
valid standard errors even if the correlation structure is mis-
specified. In stratified analyses, P values comparing strata
were generated using interaction terms. The baseline UA
interaction term was performed by replacing each category of
UA level (,4, 4 to ,5, 5 to ,6, 6 to ,7, and $7 mg/dl) with
the median baseline UA level for that category and treating it
as a continuous variable. P values less than or equal to 0.05
were considered significant. Only 1 serum UA value was miss-
ing from the control diet with medium sodium intake level,
and this value was excluded from the analysis.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics. Baseline characteristics
of the 103 study participants recruited at the Baltimore
site are shown in Table 2. Participants had a mean6 SD
age of 51.5 6 9.7 years, 55% were women, 75% were
black, 42% were obese, and 34% had hypertension. The
mean 6 SD serum UA level was 5.0 6 1.3 mg/dl. Eight
participants (8%) had a serum UA level of $7 mg/dl at
baseline. Alcohol consumption among study participants
was low (mean 6 SD 1.3 6 2.5 gm/day).
Changes in serum UA level from baseline are
shown in Table 3. During the control diet, low sodium
intake was associated with an increase in UA from base-
line (0.4 mg/dl; P , 0.001). Meanwhile, during the
DASH diet, high sodium intake was associated with a
reduction in UA from baseline (20.3 mg/dl; P 5 0.01).

 Effects of the DASH diet. The mean UA levels
by diet, after consuming each sodium level, are shown in
Figure 1. The DASH diet was associated with signifi-
cantly lower serum UA during both low (20.53 mg/dl;
P 5 0.03) and medium (20.56 mg/dl; P 5 0.03) sodium
intake and with a nonsignificant reduction in serum UA
levels
during
high
sodium
intake
(20.33
mg/dl;
P 5 0.18). There was no evidence of effect modification
by diet on the relationship between sodium level and
UA level. Overall, the DASH diet reduced serum UA
compared with the control diet (20.35 mg/dl [95% con-
fidence interval (95% CI) 20.65, 20.05], P 5 0.02).
Effects of sodium intake level.
Regardless of
diet, medium sodium intake significantly reduced serum
UA compared to low sodium intake (20.35 mg/dl for
the DASH diet, P 5 0.04; 20.33 mg/dl for the control
diet, P , 0.001). Similarly, compared to low sodium
intake, high sodium intake significantly reduced serum
UA (20.33 mg/dl for the DASH diet [P 5 0.003];
20.53 mg/dl for the control diet, [P , 0.001]). Overall,
when aggregated across both diets, compared to low
sodium intake, medium sodium intake lowered serum
UA (20.34 mg/dl [95% CI 20.52, 20.16]; P , 0.001),
and high sodium intake lowered serum UA (20.43
mg/dl [95% CI 20.58, 20.28], P , 0.001). There was no
significant difference between high and medium sodium
intake across both diets (20.09 mg/dl; P 5 0.31).
Effect modification.
The effect of the DASH
diet on serum UA was nearly null when baseline serum
UA was either ,4 mg/dl or 4 to ,5 mg/dl. However,
when baseline serum UA was 5 to ,6 mg/dl, the DASH
diet reduced serum UA (20.45 mg/dl). This effect was
incrementally greater (20.76 mg/dl) in participants with
baseline serum UA of 6 to ,7 mg/dl, and 21.29 mg/dl in
participants with baseline serum UA of $7 mg/dl (P for
interaction5 0.04) (Figure 2). The effect of the DASH
diet on serum UA appeared higher in men (20.67 mg/dl)
than in women (20.09 mg/dl); however, this difference
was of borderline statistical significance (P 5 0.06). Race,
obesity, and high blood pressure did not modify the rela-
tionship between the DASH diet and serum UA.
With regard to the effects of sodium intake lev-
els on serum UA, sex, race, baseline serum UA level,
and obesity did not modify the relationship between
sodium intake and serum UA (Figure 2). However,
participants with high blood pressure at baseline dem-
onstrated larger effects from the high versus low
sodium intake (20.66 mg/dl) than did participants with
low blood pressure at baseline (20.31 mg/dl) (P for
interaction 5 0.02).
DISCUSSION
In this ancillary study in a single center of the
DASH–sodium trial, we found that consuming the

body mass index, and baseline high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure $140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure $90 mm Hg). Given that
there was no sodium intake–diet interaction, the comparison of the DASH and control diets used all 3 measures of serum UA determined after
each of the sodium intake periods. The comparison of high and low sodium intake is presented for participants consuming either the control
diet or the DASH diet. Dashed lines represent the overall mean difference. Values are the mean (95% confidence interval [95% CI]).

 DASH diet, a widely recommended diet for the preven-
tion and treatment of hypertension, significantly reduced
serum UA. Furthermore, in exploratory subgroup analy-
ses, this reduction was larger among those with higher
serum UA levels at baseline, with changes in serum UA
of 20.76 mg/dl and 21.29 mg/dl among those with base-
line serum UA levels of 6 to ,7 mg/dl and $7 mg/dl,
respectively. Notably, the latter effect size approached
that of pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy (7–9). We
also found that increased levels of sodium intake reduced
serum UA, and this effect was greater among participants
with high blood pressure at baseline.
The DASH diet emphasizes whole grains, fruits,
vegetables, and low-fat dairy products with a low intake
of red meats, sweets, and saturated fats (18). Thus, the
DASH diet encompasses many of the elements known
to be inversely associated with hyperuricemia and gout,
such as lower purine content (11–13), higher dairy con-
tent (13,16), and higher vitamin C (14,15,21) intake with
fruits. Furthermore, recent evidence has shown that
consuming a fruit and vegetable–based diet alkalinizes
urine, increasing UA excretion (22). In this study, we
further observed a trend toward greater UA reduction
in participants with higher UA levels at baseline. As
participants consumed the same foods during the run-in
period, differential effects according to baseline UA val-
ues may reflect underlying differences in the renal clear-
ance of UA. Future study would be needed to clarify
this speculation. Despite the large magnitude reduction
observed in exploratory analyses of study participants
with hyperuricemia (i.e., serum UA level of .7 mg/dl),
additional research is needed to confirm these effects in
a population with gout. As such, urate-lowering therapy
should continue to be the cornerstone of gout treat-
ment, whenever indicated (23).
The comorbidity benefit of any urate-lowering
approach is important, as hyperuricemia and gout are
associated with cardiovascular–metabolic comorbidities
(24,25) and sequelae (e.g., increased future risk of
myocardial infarction and premature death) (25–27).
However, the conventional low-purine, urate-lowering
approach offers limited efficacy, palatability, and sustain-
ability and promotes increased consumption of refined
carbohydrates and saturated fat that can worsen the
cardiovascular–metabolic comorbidities of gout by lead-
ing to insulin resistance and increased levels of plasma
glucose, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol (28,29). In contrast, the DASH diet substantially
reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure among
hypertensive individuals (18). As a result, the American
Heart Association guidelines for cardiovascular health
and the dietary management of hypertension guidelines
endorse dietary approaches that are similar to those
included in the DASH diet (17,18,30). The DASH diet is
also quite palatable. A post hoc survey found that
DASH–sodium trial participants reported liking the
DASH diet more than the control diet, with a higher will-
ingness to continue the DASH diet compared to the con-
trol diet (31).
Our randomized trial analysis also found that high
sodium intake lowers serum UA. The relationship
between sodium intake and UA is a subject of contro-
versy, yet previous physiologic studies have suggested
similar findings. For example, a study of 27 men showed
that increasing sodium intake from 20 mmoles/day to 200
mmoles/day decreased UA levels by 1 mg/dl (P , 0.001)
(32). In another crossover trial of 147 nonobese, normo-
tensive adults, it was found that 7 days of low versus high
sodium intake (20 versus 300 mmoles/day) significantly
increased serum UA by ;1 mg/dl (33). We similarly
show that higher sodium intake reduced serum UA.
The mechanism by which increased sodium
intake decreases UA is unclear. Prior studies have
shown that both sodium and urate reabsorption often
occur in response to similar physiologic stimuli (34–38).
This would suggest that decreased sodium reabsorption
in response to higher sodium intake would also decrease
urate reabsorption. It is also possible that the inverse
relationship between sodium intake and UA reflects
action of the renin–angiotensin system, as UA is inversely
related to renal blood flow (39) and vascular resis-
tance (40). Similarly, angiotensin II has been shown to
decrease urate excretion after an acute infusion (41,42).
Our study’s findings are certainly consistent with the
reported effects of thiazide diuretics on UA in both
animal (43) and human (44,45) studies. Thiazides act
predominantly on the distal tubule to reduce sodium
reabsorption, but are known to increase UA levels
simultaneously (44). It should be noted that despite
increasing UA, thiazides are associated with a lower risk
of myocardial infarction and stroke (46).
In exploratory subgroup analyses, we observed that
UA reduction from sodium intake was greatest in partici-
pants who had high blood pressure at baseline, similar to
findings in another study of patients with essential hyper-
tension (47). This subgroup also represents a population
that could likely benefit from a low-sodium diet for blood
pressure management. It should be noted that the higher
sodium level in this trial (i.e., 180 mmoles/day) is approxi-
mately equal to the average sodium consumed in a typical
American diet (i.e., 1,659 mg per 1,000 kcal/day or ;187
mmoles/day at 2,600 kcal/day) (48). Interestingly, among
participants consuming the DASH diet, increasing sodium
intake from medium to high had practically no effect on

 UA. As a result, our findings do not support the idea that
one should consume excessive or even the typical levels of
sodium in the American diet to lower UA. Rather, just as
with thiazide initiation, clinicians counseling their patients
with gout on adopting a low-sodium diet should be wary
of the potential for acute changes in UA, as UA
fluctuations are known to precipitate gout flares (49).
The present study has limitations. First, the study
excluded
persons
with
prior
cardiovascular
disease,
advanced kidney disease, and medication-treated diabetes
mellitus, which may limit its generalizability. Similarly,
our study population differed from the usual gout popula-
tion, having a low alcohol intake and being 55% female.
Moreover, our study was conducted .17 years ago. Fur-
ther, the duration of interventions was relatively short,
precluding conclusions related to the long-term effects of
the DASH diet and sodium intake on serum UA. Also, it
is conceivable that the effects of the DASH diet and
sodium intake might differ in a population of patients
with gout, although the subgroup effects observed among
hyperuricemic individuals are likely to be applicable to
those with gout. Finally, our subgroup analyses are by
nature exploratory. Differences between strata of baseline
UA level (P 5 0.04 for DASH diet versus control diet) or
strata of baseline high blood pressure (P 5 0.02 for high
sodium intake versus low sodium intake) are at best mar-
ginal and warrant confirmation in a dedicated trial.
Notwithstanding these limitations, the present
study has a number of important strengths. We employed
a randomized, clinical trial to examine the impact of a
dietary intervention on serum levels of UA. Further, the
trial protocol required maintenance of a constant weight,
minimizing effects from weight change (50). Moreover,
the study population was diverse, diets were highly regu-
lated, and participants were very compliant with the study
diets throughout the trial period. Finally, the crossover
design increased our power to observe the effects of diet
and sodium levels on UA within study participants
despite a modest sample size.
In conclusion, the DASH diet lowered serum UA,
and this effect was substantial among participants with
hyperuricemia. Moreover, low sodium intake increased
serum UA, which enhances our knowledge of urate path-
ophysiology and risk factors for hyperuricemia.
