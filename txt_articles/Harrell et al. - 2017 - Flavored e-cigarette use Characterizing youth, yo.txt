The purpose of this study is to investigate how the use of flavored e-cigarettes varies between youth (12–17 years
old), young adults (18–29 years old), and older adults (30+ years old). Cross-sectional surveys of school-going
youth (n = 3907) and young adult college students (n = 5482) in Texas, and young adults and older adults (n =
6051) nationwide were administered in 2014–2015. Proportions and 95% confidence intervals were used to de-
scribe the percentage of e-cigarette use at initiation and in the past 30 days that was flavored, among current e-
cigarette users. Chi-square tests were applied to examine differences by combustible tobacco product use and de-
mographic factors. Most e-cigarette users said their first and “usual” e-cigarettes were flavored. At initiation, the
majority of Texas school-going youth (98%), Texas young adult college students (95%), and young adults (71.2%)
nationwide said their first e-cigarettes were flavored to taste like something other than tobacco, compared to
44.1% of older adults nationwide. Fruit and candy flavors predominated for all groups; and, for youth, flavors
were an especially salient reason to use e-cigarettes. Among adults, the use of tobacco flavor at initiation was
common among dual users (e-cigarettes + combustible tobacco), while other flavors were more common
among former cigarette smokers (P = 0.03). Restricting the range of e-cigarette flavors (e.g., eliminating sweet
flavors, like fruit and candy) may benefit youth and young adult prevention efforts. However, it is unclear
what impact this change would have on adult smoking cessation.

1. Introduction
An astonishing number of “characterizing flavors” are now widely
available for those who use e-cigarettes – by one estimate, over 7500
(Zhu et al., 2014). In addition to tobacco and menthol, e-cigarettes
come in sweet flavors, like fruit, candy, and dessert. Enticing flavors
like these were banned from conventional cigarettes in 2009 to reduce
youth smoking, as they were often used as a starter product (FDA.
Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, 2015; US
Department of Health Human Services, 2012). Flavors alone are harmful
to health (Barrington-Trimis et al., 2014; Hutzler et al., 2014; Grana et
al., 2014; Kosmider et al., 2016; Tierney et al., 2015; Behar et al.,
2014). Toxic compounds like diacetyl, which has been linked to severe
respiratory disease, have been found in 75% of flavored e-cigarettes
(Allen et al., 2015; Farsalinos et al., 2014).
Data on the occurrence of flavored e-cigarette use across different
age groups are sparse. The prevalence of flavored e-cigarette use
among youth current (i.e., past 30 day) e-cigarette users is estimated
between 63.3% (Corey et al., 2015) and 85.3%, (Ambrose et al., 2015) ac-
cording to the 2014 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) and the
2013–2014 Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study
(PATH), respectively. Preliminary, unpublished results from 2013 to
2014 PATH suggest the proportion of flavored e-cigarette use among
18–24 year old young adult current users is similar to youth, at 83.0%,
while that among adults 25+ years old is lower, at 63.0% (Hyland et
al., 2016). Only one published study of young adults' flavored tobacco
products use is available, which showed only 17% of 18–34 year old
young adult current e-cigarette users used a flavored e-cigarette in
2012, before the sharp increase in e-cigarette use nationwide (Villanti
et al., 2013). There are no published studies on adults' flavored e-ciga-
rette use. Until more data on this topic are available, it remains unclear
whether preferences for flavored e-cigarettes vary by age group. This
evidence will be important to determine whether regulation, like the
ban on cigarette flavors, is also needed for e-cigarettes.

 Though some adults begin using e-cigarettes as a device to stop
smoking conventional cigarettes (Grana & Ling, 2014; McRobbie et al.,
2014), other reasons, like curiosity (Schmidt et al., 2014; Biener et al.,
2015; Kong et al., 2014; McDonald & Ling, 2015; Surís et al., 2015;
Sutfin et al., 2015; Biener & Hargraves, 2014), are more relevant to
youth and young adult e-cigarette users. Among these reasons, flavors
play a particularly prominent role. In the 2013–2014 PATH survey,
81.5% of youth e-cigarette users said that they used e-cigarettes “be-
cause they come in flavors I like” (Ambrose et al., 2015). Data from
smaller, qualitative studies of young adults suggest flavors are an attrac-
tive aspect of using e-cigarettes, contributing to the novelty of these de-
vices, which are “fun toys” (McDonald & Ling, 2015; Choi et al., 2012).
Among adults use e-cigarettes to quit conventional cigarette smoking,
tobacco flavor is often preferred at the start, though sweet flavors be-
come more relevant as e-cigarette use continues (Farsalinos et al.,
2014; Dawkins et al., 2013).
The impact of flavors on the uptake of e-cigarettes among youth
compared to adults is not without controversy. The most influential
study to date that drives this debate is that by Shiffman and colleagues
(Shiffman et al., 2015). Nonsmoking youth (n = 216, 13–17 years old)
and adult cigarette smokers with varied histories of e-cigarette use
(n = 432, 19–80 years old) were asked to rate their preferences for
flavors being offered in 2014 by NJOY e-cigarettes. Across all flavors,
adult smokers' interest surpassed that of nonsmoking youth. The au-
thors concluded their data do not support the hypothesis that flavors
in e-cigarettes will entice nonsmoking youth to use them. Concerns
about the reliability and validity of this study, funded by NJOY, have
been raised (Glantz, 2015). Additional research is needed to elucidate
if flavors are disproportionately preferred by young people or adults.
The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the use of fla-
vored e-cigarettes varies between youth (12–17 years old), young
adults (18–29 years old), and adults (30+ years old). We examine the
use of flavored e-cigarettes at initiation and whether “usual” e-ciga-
rettes, for current users, are flavored. Differences in flavored e-cigarette
use by combustible tobacco product use are considered, as are differ-
ences by sex and race/ethnicity. We investigate a variety of flavors: to-
bacco; menthol or mint; fruit (e.g., cherry, strawberry); candy (e.g.,
gummy bear) or dessert (e.g., chocolate, vanilla); coffee or alcohol;
and spice (e.g., cinnamon); as well as unflavored e-cigarettes, among
adults. Finally, we consider the relevance of flavors as a reason to use
e-cigarettes.
2. Methods
2.1. Data sources
Data are derived from three separate studies to represent e-ciga-
rette use profiles across three age groups and include studies of
youth (12–17 years old), young adults (18–29 years old), and adults
(30+ years old). The studies are the (a) Texas Adolescent Tobacco
and Marketing Surveillance System (TATAMS); (b) Marketing and
Promotions Across Colleges in Texas Project (M-PACT); and (c) the
Tobacco Products and Risk Perceptions Survey (TPRPS). The first
two studies are characteristic of the 4 largest metropolitan areas in
Texas (i.e., Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth, San Antonio, and Austin),
while the last study is representative of non-institutionalized adults
in the United States. This study was a collaboration across two differ-
ent Tobacco Centers of Regulatory Science (TCORS) recently
established by the Food and Drug Administration and, as such, repre-
sents value in cross-institutional collaboration.
2.1.1. TATAMS
The Texas Adolescent Tobacco and Marketing Surveillance System
(TATAMS) is a multiple component, rapid response surveillance system
administered by the Texas Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science on
Youth & Young Adults (Texas TCORS). Data from the Texas Education
Agency, Texas Private School Accreditation Commission, and the Na-
tional Center for Education Statistics were used to generate a sampling
frame of all public, private and charter schools with 6th, 8th and 10th
graders in 2014–15 in the 5 counties surrounding the 4 largest cities
in Texas (Houston, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Austin, San Antonio). A complex
multistage probability sample of public schools was drawn using prob-
ability proportional to the grades' enrollment, and all private and char-
ter schools were invited to participate. Details about this procedure are
provided in Pérez et al. (Pérez et al., 2015). Data for this manuscript are
taken from the baseline survey, which was administered October 2014–
June 2015, on an electronic form on computerized tablets (Delk et al.,
n.d.). Seventy nine schools and 3907 middle and high school students
participated, representing a population of 461,069 6th, 8th, and 10th
graders in these major metropolitan areas (Pérez et al., 2015). The Insti-
tutional Review Board at University of Texas' Health Science Center,
Houston approved all protocols (HSC-SPH-13-0377).
2.1.2. M-PACT
The Marketing and Promotions Across Colleges in Texas Project
(M-PACT) is also affiliated with the Texas TCORS and is a rapid-re-
sponse surveillance system that runs parallel to TATAMS in 2- and
4-year colleges across the same cities. Three colleges of each type
were selected from each city, for a total of 24. Participants were
full- or part-time degree- or certificate-seeking 18–29 year old un-
dergraduate students attending the 4-year college or a vocational/
technical program at the 2-year college. Recruitment at 2-year col-
leges was limited to students enrolled in vocational/technical pro-
grams as they have an elevated prevalence of cigarette use (Loukas
et al., 2008). Over 13,000 college students (n = 13,714) were eligible
to participate and recruited via an e-mail invitation. Of these, 5482
(40%) completed the baseline survey in November 2014–February
2015, from which the data here are drawn. More details regarding
the sampling for this study can be found elsewhere (Loukas, 2015).
The University of Texas at Austin's Institutional Review Board ap-
proved all protocols (2013-06-0034).
2.1.3. TPRPS
The Tobacco Products and Risk Perceptions Survey (TPRPS) is ad-
ministered by the Georgia State University Tobacco Center of Regula-
tory Science (GSU TCORS). The survey presented here was conducted
August to September 2015 and was administered to a cross-section-
al, probability sample drawn from GfK's KnowledgePanel, a probabil-
ity-based web panel representative of non-institutionalized US
adults. Of these KnowledgePanel members, 8135 were invited to
participate in the online survey and 6091 qualified as completers.
Forty cases were excluded due to refusing to answer more than
one-half of the survey questions, for a final sample of 6051 adults,
representing 238,226,996 nationwide. The average panel recruit-
ment rate (RECR) for this study, reported by GfK, was 13.8% (rate at
which those from the target population accept the invitation to join
KnowledgePanel), the average profile rate (PROR) was 64.6% (rate
at which those of the target population who accept the invitation
to join KnowledgePanel complete the required GfK profile surveys
to become members of KnowledgePanel), and the study completion
rate (COMR) was 76.0% (the percentage invited to participate in the
survey that completed the survey) for a cumulative response rate of
6.8% (RECR*PROR*COMR). More details about this design and the
computation of these response rates are found here (Callegaro &
DiSogra, 2008; Weaver et al., n.d.). The Institutional Review Board
at Georgia State approved all study protocols (H14028).

 categories that applied. If any flavor was chosen, respondents were cat-
egorized as “flavored, not tobacco” in Table 2. This same rule was ap-
plied to all studies for current use of flavors in Table 2. In Fig. 1, the raw
“check all that apply” form of current use item was retained instead to
illustrate the maximum variability in flavors across the studies. M-
PACT applied the flavor use at initiation question to only current users,
while the other studies also applied it to ever users. For flavors as a rea-
son to use, responses were dichotomized across all studies. The TPRPS
survey only asked this question of adult current e-cigarette users
(Table 3).
The measure of combustible tobacco product use included ciga-
rettes, hookah, and all types of cigar products (large cigars, cigarillos,
and little filtered cigars). Former combustible use was defined as partic-
ipants who reported ever use of any combustible product, but not cur-
rent use. TPRPS defined ever use of cigarettes as reporting smoking
100 or more cigarettes in their lifetime; ever use of all other products
was defined as having used the product even one or two times in
their lifetime. TATAMS and M-PACT defined ever use of each product
the same: reporting using the product (even one or two times) in
their lifetime. Current combustible product use was defined as partici-
pants who reported use of any combustible product at least 1 day in
the past 30 (for TATAMS or M-PACT participants) or “every day” or
“some days” (for TPRPS participants). In addition, we also focused in
analyses on the subset of current combustible users that were currently
smoking cigarettes, regardless of their other combustible product use;
these are noted as current cigarette (Tables 2 and 3). Never combustible
use was defined as those who reported “no” to ever use of all of these
products. Questions that define ever use and current use of these prod-
ucts are identical to the questions in Table 1 for e-cigarette use, except
e-cigarettes are replaced by these other tobacco products, each with a
separate question.
2.2.2. Data analysis
Proportions and 95% confidence intervals were used to describe
the percentage of e-cigarette use at initiation and in the past
30 days that can be attributed to the use of flavored e-cigarettes
(Table 2). Statistics were calculated overall and then stratified by
combustible tobacco product use. Sample sizes for never combusti-
ble users were only large enough to be examined in TATAMS and
M-PACT, as most adult e-cigarette users had already used combusti-
ble tobacco products. Chi-square tests were used to study differences
between current and former combustible users (Table 2) and to in-
vestigate differences by sex and race/ethnicity across e-cigarette fla-
vor categories among current e-cigarette users (results presented in
text). Proportions of e-cigarette use in the past 30 days that could be
attributed to all types of flavors, including tobacco, mint/menthol,
fruit, coffee/alcohol, candy/dessert, spice, or other flavor were calcu-
lated (Fig. 1). To determine the salience of flavors as a reason to use
e-cigarettes, proportions and 95% confidence intervals were calcu-
lated (Table 3). Analyses of TPRPS data were stratified by age group
(18–29 years old vs. 30+ years old) to provide estimates for young
adults nationwide that could be compared with those from Texas
(M-PACT). Sampling weights were applied to the TATAMS and
TPRPS data, but not to M-PACT, as M-PACT employed a convenience
sample, while TATAMS and TPRPS used random sampling protocols
that allow the results to generalize back to the population from
which the sample was drawn, when weights are applied. Detailed in-
formation about the calculation and application of sampling weights
is provided elsewhere (Pérez et al., 2015; Callegaro & DiSogra, 2008;
Weaver et al., n.d.). Estimates that relied on denominators ≤50 were
suppressed as the results would be statistically unreliable.
3. Results
E-cigarette use was most common among young adult college
students in Texas. The prevalence of ever e-cigarette use among
Texas youth and young adult college students (18–29 years old)
was 19.5% (95% CI: 15.9%, 24.0%) and 44.6% (95% CI: 43.3%, 46.0%),
respectively, while it was 29.5% (95% CI: 26.0%, 33.3%) and 13.8%
(95% CI: 12.6%, 15.0%) among young adults (18–29 years old) and
adults (30+ years old) nationwide. Current e-cigarette use was
7.4% (95% CI: 5.9%, 9.0%), 15.3% (95% CI: 14.3%, 16.3%), 9.3% (95%
CI: 7.2%, 12.0%) and 4.5% (95% CI: 3.8%, 5.2%) across these different
samples, respectively.
3.1. Use of flavored e-cigarettes at initiation
Most youth, young adult, and adult e-cigarette users said their first
e-cigarette was flavored, with the majority reporting their first e-ciga-
rette was flavored to taste like something
other than tobacco (Table 2). The proportion of current users who
started with an e-cigarette flavored with something other than tobacco
was considerably higher in Texas youth (98.6%) and young adults in
Texas (95.2%) and nationwide (71.2%) compared to older adults nation-
wide (44.1%). Tobacco flavor was significantly more common among
older adults nationwide (47.5%), compared to young adults nationwide
(21.0%) and young adult college students (4.8%), and youth (1.4%) in
Texas.
No significant differences were noted by combustible tobacco prod-
uct use for youth in Texas, but significant differences emerged for young
adult college students in Texas and adults nationwide. At initiation, the
use of tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes was more common among current
dual users (e-cigarette and combustible tobacco product users) than ex-
clusive e-cigarette users (i.e., former combustible tobacco product
users), for both age groups (p b 0.05, both). Among adults nationwide,
43.5% of current combustible users said their first e-cigarette was fla-
vored to taste like tobacco, compared to 27.8% of former combustible
product users.
3.2. Current use of flavored e-cigarettes
Similar trends in flavored e-cigarette use in the past 30 days
were noted (Table 2). Overall, most youth, young adult, and adult
e-cigarette users reported the “usual” e-cigarette they used in the
past 30 days was flavored, with the majority reporting that it was
flavored to taste like something other than tobacco. The proportion
of current users whose “usual” e-cigarette was flavored but not with
tobacco was appreciably higher for Texas youth (97.9%) and young
adults (96.7%) in Texas and nationwide (82.2%) compared to older
adults nationwide (69.3%). In older adults, current use of an e-ciga-
rette flavored with something other than tobacco (69.3%) was
also significantly higher than the same at initiation (44.1%). No
differences by combustible product use were observed for any
age group.
3.3. Preference for and salience of flavors
Among current e-cigarette users, there were no significant differ-
ences in use of flavored e-cigarettes at initiation or “usually” by sex or
racial/ethnic group for any age group (all p N 0.05, data not shown in
Table). Fig. 1 illustrates preferences for specific flavors among current
e-cigarette users, for the “usual” e-cigarette. Across all studies, fruit
flavors predominated, endorsed by 76% of Texas youth, 83% of Texas
young adult college students, 74% of young adults nationwide, and
47% of older adults nationwide. The next most popular flavor was
candy or dessert, reported by 57% of Texas youth, 52% of Texas young
adult college students, 50% of young adults nationwide, and 27% of
older adults nationwide. Tobacco flavor was the least commonly report-
ed as a usual flavor among all groups, at 13% of Texas youth, 23% of Texas
young adult college students, 1% of young adults nationwide, and 13% of
older adults nationwide.

 Table 3 presents the proportion of participants who said they
used e-cigarettes because they “come in flavors I like”. Among cur-
rent e-cigarette users, more Texas youth (72.9%) than young adult
college students in Texas (57.4%) and young adults (64.8%) and
adults (54.0%) nationwide endorsed this item. The same trend was
noted for ever users, overall, comparing youth (64.9%) to young
adult college students (49.5%) in Texas. Among youth and young
adult ever e-cigarette users in Texas, this was lowest among those
who had never used a combustible tobacco product (53.5% and
34.0% respectively) and higher among those who had some experi-
ence with combustible tobacco product use (79.8% and 50.9%
respectively).

 4. Discussion
Although the use of flavored e-cigarettes was not uncommon among
older adults, our study underscores the relevance and importance of
this issue for both youth and young adults. For school-going youth and
young adult college students in Texas, almost all first (N95%) and
“usual” (N96%) e-cigarette use was with a product flavored to taste
like something other than tobacco. The large majority of young adults
nationwide also preferred flavored e-cigarettes (71.2% and 82.2%, at
first and “usual” use respectively). By comparison, fewer adults nation-
wide reported the same at initiation (44.1%), and at “usual” use (69.3%).
The latter finding suggests flavors other than tobacco become increas-
ingly relevant to older adults as they continue using e-cigarettes.
This study is the first one to date that explicitly compares patterns of
flavored e-cigarette use across age groups. Our findings are troubling
and suggest that, like conventional cigarettes (US Department of
Health Human Services, 2012), characterizing flavors could be especial-
ly enticing to young people, at onset and with continued use. Eliminat-
ing or restricting e-cigarette flavors in future could be an essential
element of comprehensive tobacco control policies designed to reduce
the appeal of tobacco products for young people. Already, Chicago and
New York City have begun to restrict the sale of flavored tobacco prod-
ucts and e-cigarettes (Emanuel, 2013). As e-cigarettes are now under
the authority of FDA to regulate (FDA/USDA, 2014), other regulations
like the ban placed on flavored cigarettes (FDA. Family Smoking
Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, 2015) could be considered, also.
No rules specific to flavorings in e-cigarettes were set forth in the recent
deeming action taken by the FDA.
Given our findings and that of others', regulatory actions would not
only impact youth and young adults, but also older adults. Preferences
for certain flavors differ slightly by age group in studies to date, includ-
ing this one, and also by cigarette smoking status (Krishnan-Sarin et al.,
2015; Berg, 2015). Sweet flavors, like fruit and candy, are most com-
monly preferred by youth, young adults, and adults alike and exceed
N75% of flavored e-cigarette use in most studies (Farsalinos et al.,
2014; Dawkins et al., 2013; Krishnan-Sarin et al., 2015; Berg, 2015). In
one study from the UK, sweet flavors reduced perceptions of harm
from e-cigarettes among youth (Ford et al., 2015). In our study, prefer-
ence for sweet flavors was appreciably lower among older adults, at
b50%. Across studies of youth, young adults, and adults, mint or men-
thol and tobacco flavors are preferred more often among e-cigarette
users who also smoke cigarettes (dual users), compared to exclusive
e-cigarette users, and those who have never smoked a cigarette, espe-
cially at initiation (Farsalinos et al., 2014; Dawkins et al., 2013;
Krishnan-Sarin et al., 2015; Berg, 2015). Still, use of these flavors is at
considerably lower rates than sweeter flavors, varying between 25%
and 50% of youth and adult cigarette smokers, respectively (Farsalinos
et al., 2014; Dawkins et al., 2013; Krishnan-Sarin et al., 2015; Berg,
2015). These data suggest that tobacco and mint/menthol flavored e-
cigarettes could be most relevant to and helpful for adult cigarette
smokers who may use e-cigarettes to try to quit smoking. Thus,
restricting the range of flavors by eliminating sweet ones may offer
the most benefit to youth and young adult prevention efforts, without
doing harm to adults. Though e-cigarettes are not a proven tool for
adult cigarette smoking cessation, it is unclear what impact this action
may have on these efforts, instead (Grana et al., 2014; Grana & Ling,
2014; McRobbie et al., 2014). Remarkably, trends in flavored e-cigarette
use reported here did not vary by sex or race/ethnicity for any of the age
groups, suggesting the impact of any actions specific to this issue might
only differ across different life stages and/or by combustible product
use.
Limitations include the study's reliance on self-report and cross-sec-
tional analyses that do not allow for the direct estimation of the role that
flavors have in initiation or cessation among youth, young adults, or
Fig. 1. Variability in flavored e-cigarette use among youth, young adult and adult current e-cigarette users.

 older adults. TATAMS and M-PACT are specific to school-going partici-
pants, who may not generalize to out-of-school youth. Also, these stud-
ies from Texas may not be representative of similarly-aged students
living elsewhere, though e-cigarette use rates are comparable to those
from national studies (Ford et al., 2015; Singh, 2016). Studies have not
yet evaluated whether e-cigarette use rates are similar between young
people who do and do not attend school, though data indicate that
youth and young adults who do not attend school are more likely to
smoke combustible cigarettes (United States Department of Health
and Human Services, 2012). Finally, minor differences in the wording
of items and procedures used across all three studies to assess flavored
e-cigarette use may be a potential limitation of the study, too. Though
these three studies were not designed to be directly comparable,
every effort was made post-hoc to align measures and analyses.
5. Conclusion
Characterizing flavors, especially sweet ones (e.g., fruit, candy, des-
sert), appear to be particularly relevant to e-cigarette use among
young people, the rates of which have risen substantially in recent
years (Singh, 2016; United States Department of Health and Human
Services, 2012; Neff et al., 2015; Arrazola et al., 2015). Nationwide,
past 30 day e-cigarette use was highest in 2014 among youth (13.4%)
(Neff et al., 2015) and young adults (14.2%, 18–24 year olds) (Arrazola
et al., 2015) compared to adults (2.4%, 25–44 year olds). (Agaku et al.,
2014) Given new longitudinal research that shows that e-cigarette use
also predicts the onset of combustible tobacco product use among
both youth and young adults (Leventhal et al., 2015; Primack et al.,
2015; Wills et al., 2016), acting like a “gateway” drug, it is imperative
to identify feasible and effective intervention strategies that could po-
tentially decrease the onset of and continued e-cigarette use. Eliminat-
ing or restricting characterizing flavors for e-cigarettes, especially
sweet ones (e.g., fruit, candy, dessert) may offer the most benefit to
youth and young adult prevention efforts. However, it is unclear what
impact this strategy might have on adult cigarette smoking cessation.
