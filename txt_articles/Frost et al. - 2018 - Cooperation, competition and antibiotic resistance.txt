Abstract
Bacteria commonly live in dense and genetically diverse communities associated with surfaces. In these communities, 
competition for resources and space is intense, and yet we understand little of how this affects the spread of antibiotic-
resistant strains. Here, we study interactions between antibiotic-resistant and susceptible strains using in vitro competition 
experiments in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and in silico simulations. Selection for intracellular 
resistance to streptomycin is very strong in colonies, such that resistance is favoured at very low antibiotic doses. In contrast, 
selection for extracellular resistance to carbenicillin is weak in colonies, and high doses of antibiotic are required to select for 
resistance. Manipulating the density and spatial structure of colonies reveals that this difference is partly explained by the
fact that the local degradation of carbenicillin by β-lactamase-secreting cells protects neighbouring sensitive cells from 
carbenicillin. In addition, we discover a second unexpected effect: the inducible elongation of cells in response to carbenicillin 
allows sensitive cells to better compete for the rapidly growing colony edge. These combined effects mean that antibiotic 
treatment can select against antibiotic-resistant strains, raising the possibility of treatment regimes that suppress sensitive 
strains while limiting the rise of antibiotic resistance. We argue that the detailed study of bacterial interactions will be 
fundamental to understanding and overcoming antibiotic resistance.
Introduction
Antibiotic resistance is a major concern that is threatening
our ability to treat the most common of bacterial infections
[1]. As well as attempting to find new drugs, we need to
better understand the processes that promote, or inhibit, the
spread of antibiotic-resistant strains [2]. There is a large
literature on the evolution of antibiotic resistance that has
primarily focused on understanding how bacteria respond to
antibiotics in liquid culture [3 5]. While tractable, these
conditions lie in stark contrast to the way that bacteria often
grow. Both in the environment and in infections, bacteria
commonly grow in dense and genetically diverse commu-
nities, where competition for space and resources is intense
[6 8].
Growth of bacteria in these communities, often known as
“biofilms” when on a surface [9], is well known to increase
the phenotypic ability of bacteria to resist antibiotics [2, 10].
However, these observations are based on single strains
and, to understand the rise and fall of resistance, we need to
understand
how
genetically
antibiotic-resistant
strains
compete with sensitive strains under these conditions.

 Growth in dense and diverse communities generally means
that each cell can much more strongly influence the growth
and survival of other cells [11, 12]. This effect is known to
promote the evolution of competitive phenotypes, including
toxin secretion [13], smothering polymers [14] and adhe-
sion [15]. However, growth in dense communities can also
lead to
spatiogenetic structure and the evolution of
cooperative phenotypes, such as enzymes that digest com-
plex molecules outside the cell [7, 16].
The key insight from these studies is that the details of
how cells are arranged and how they affect each other are
critical to understanding natural selection in dense colonies.
How might colony growth impact selection for antibiotic-
resistant strains? If the mechanism of resistance only
Fig. 1 Natural selection for antibiotic resistance in liquid culture.
Susceptible and resistant strains were competed in liquid culture
supplemented with carbenicillin (extracellular resistance) or strepto
mycin (intracellular resistance). Both streptomycin (a) and carbeni
cillin (b) suppress the growth rate of the susceptible strain (red line
shows the susceptible growth in the presence of the resistant strain,
black line shows the susceptible growth alone). In contrast, the growth
rate of the resistant strain is not altered by antibiotic exposure (c, d, red
line shows the resistant growth in the presence of the susceptible
strain, grey line shows the resistant growth alone). As a result, all
antibiotic concentrations select for the resistant strain (e, f). Please note
that we use different axis ranges for the susceptible (a, b) and resistant
(c, d) cell division data, because the data have very different ranges.

3 for monocultures, are shown (Colour figure

 benefits the cell that carries it, intense competition in
colonies is likely to lead to strong selection for resistance.
By contrast, if the resistance of one cell protects another,
antibiotic resistance can become a cooperative trait. In this
case, resistant cells may protect sensitive neighbours from
antibiotics, weakening the strength of selection for resis-
tance. Recent work shows that it can be difficult to predict
whether a particular mechanism of resistance will have
competitive or cooperative effects [17]. Here, we use the
term cooperation as it is widely used in social evolution
theory, which is a phenotype that provides a benefit to
another individual and that evolved, at least in part, because
of this benefit [18 20]. Cooperation appears particularly
likely for resistance to β-lactams [21, 22], which often arises
via the secretion of β-lactamase enzymes that break down
antibiotics both in the periplasm and extracellularly [23,
24].
Here, we develop a simple experimental system to
understand how competition and cooperation influence
the spread of antibiotic-resistant strains in bacterial
colonies. Specifically, we directly compete antibiotic-
resistant and -sensitive strains of the pathogen P. aeru-
ginosa against each other in dense colonies, that are
exposed to variable concentrations of antibiotics, that are
broken down by the resistant strain, either intracellularly
or extracellularly. The resistant strain carries a clinical,
non-conjugative, plasmid (Rms149) [25] that confers
resistance to an aminoglycoside (streptomycin), which is
adenylated in the cytoplasm, and a β-lactam (carbeni-
cillin), which is thought to be hydrolysed both in the
periplasm and extracellularly [23, 24]. As we will show,
this allows us to directly compare a purely competitive
resistance mechanism, which protects only the cells that
carry it, with one that functions cooperatively. This
reveals that how cells compete, whether they cooperate,
and how they are arranged are all fundamental to the rise,
or fall, of resistant strains in bacterial colonies. Crucially,
this approach allows us to identity antibiotic dose
regimes that inhibit the growth of bacterial colonies
without selecting for resistance in vitro.
Materials and methods
In our experiments, we compete susceptible and resistant
strains of P. aeruginosa on LB media, either in the form of
broth culture or on agar plates. Resistant strains are isogenic
with susceptible strains with the exception that they have
been transformed with a clinical, multidrug-resistant plas-
mid, Rms149 [25]. Streptomycin resistance is conferred by
the aadA5 gene, which encodes an aminoglycoside adeny-
lyltransferase. The blaA gene provides carbenicillin resis-
tance, in the form of a constitutive class A β-lactamase. Cell
divisions are calculated using the following equation:

Results
Low antibiotic doses select for resistant strains in
liquid cultures
In order to establish our system, we first competed plasmid-
bearing and plasmid-free strains against each other in well-
mixed broth (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). Plasmid
carriage reduced fitness by 3% (s.e. = 0.38%, supplemen-
tary experimental procedures) in the absence of antibiotics,
demonstrating a cost to resistance (t21 = 9.7, P < 0.001). As
expected, supplementing culture medium with either an
aminoglycoside (streptomycin) or β-lactam (carbenicillin)
caused the fitness of the antibiotic-sensitive strain to rapidly
decrease (Fig. 1e, f), because antibiotics suppress the
population growth rate of the sensitive strain (Fig. 1a, b),
but not the resistant strain (Fig. 1c, d). One way of quan-
tifying this effect is to estimate the minimal concentration of
antibiotic required to select for the resistant strain (mini-
mum selective concentration, MSC) as a fraction of the
minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) required to fully
suppress the sensitive strain (MIC). We estimate that the
MSC was very low for both streptomycin (1.6 μg/ml; 9.7%
MIC) and carbenicillin 2.3 μg/ml (7% MIC; Fig. 1).
Moreover, we saw no evidence of resistant cells protecting
susceptible cells for either antibiotic, such that neither form
of resistance is functioning as a cooperative mechanism
under these conditions. These findings are in line with
previous results [21, 27 30], and demonstrate that the
mechanism of resistance has little, if any, impact on selec-
tion for resistance in mixed broth cultures.
Colony growth has complex effects on selection for
resistance
We next asked how life in a dense and genetically diverse
community impacts the fate of an antibiotic-resistant strain.
To do this, we repeated our competition experiments on
 agar plates (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3);
sometimes known as the “colony biofilm” model [9]. Our
first observation was that, without antibiotics, the cost of
plasmid carriage is significantly increased to 5.1% (t17.8 =
2.7, P = 0.0157). This increase is consistent with the finding
that growth under biofilm conditions increases competition
 between strains. Cell division in mature colonies and bio-
films often only occurs at the very edge [31], and this
generates strong competition and natural selection to reach
the edge and gain sustained access to nutrients and space for
proliferation [14, 32 35]. This effect
competition for the
growing edge
is expected to amplify the fitness benefit of
rapid cell division because fast-growing strains have the
added benefit of preferentially accessing the growing edge.
While expected from a large body of previous work, this
effect appears to have never been formalised. We, therefore,
used an individual-based model of colony growth in order
to reconcile our empirical findings with this intuitive effect
(Supplementary Fig. S4).
Theoretical considerations suggest that the effect of
colony growth on selection for resistance should depend
strongly on whether resistance has the potential for coop-
erative effects. This is because growth in dense colonies
should increase the scope for cross-protection, which pro-
tects susceptible cells and, thereby, weakens selection for
cooperating resistant strains [33]. Moreover, while not
guaranteed [17, 36], mechanisms of resistance that occur
intracellularly are expected to have weaker effects on other
cells than mechanisms that act outside the cell owing to the
cell membrane [33].
Consistent with these predictions, the MSC for strepto-
mycin, where resistance is conferred via an intracellular
mechanism, was approximately an order of magnitude
(0.78 μg/ml; 2.4% MIC) less than the MSC for carbenicillin
(20 μg/ml; 62% MIC) in bacterial colonies (Fig. 2). Fur-
thermore, we see no evidence for cross-protection of sus-
ceptible cells by resistant cells for streptomycin (Fig. 2a).
Rather we see that susceptible cells do worse in direct
competition with resistant cells than growing on their own.
This is again consistent with streptomycin acting as a non-
cooperative mechanism as we saw for the liquid culture
experiments.
The carbenicillin data are qualitatively different between
the liquid culture and colony experiments. Theory predicts
that selection for cooperative resistance will be potentially
weak in colonies because the secretion of detoxifying
enzymes by plasmid-carrying cells provides cross-protection
to nearby sensitive cells [33]. This allows sensitive strains to
benefit from reduced antibiotic exposure without paying
the fitness cost of resistance [21, 22, 28]. Consistent with
this explanation, the growth rate of the susceptible strain is
markedly increased by the presence of the resistant strain in
colonies at the lower concentrations of carbenicillin (Fig. 2).
Further evidence of cross-protection comes from com-
paring the morphology of susceptible cells grown in the
presence and absence of resistant cells. Carbenicillin is
known to cause cell elongation and filamentation due to
induction of the SOS response [37, 38] and inhibition of cell
wall synthesis [39]. Cell elongation occurs in susceptible
cells both when they grow alone and when they are grown
in combination with resistant cells. However, the presence
of resistant cells reduces the filamentation of susceptible
cells, providing evidence of cross-protection at the single-
cell level (Fig. 3a, b). One possible effect of cell elongation
is that colony-forming units may underestimate the fitness
of susceptible cells if the additional biomass per cell allows
more cells to ultimately be produced. However, this would
only lead to an underestimation of the extent of cooperation
and cross-protection in the experiments.
Genetic mixing weakens selection for carbenicillin
resistance
The differences in selection for streptomycin and carbeni-
cillin resistance observed in bacterial colonies suggest that
local interactions between neighbouring cells are key to
understanding selection for β-lactamase secretion in bac-
terial colonies. Theoretical work predicts that the spatial
organisation of genotypes is fundamental for the evolution
of cell cell interactions in biofilms [32 35, 40, 41]. Spe-
cifically, it predicts that the formation of clonal patches
within colonies will limit cross-protection, which will
favour resistant cells over susceptible cells. We, therefore,
tested the importance of spatial structure for the competi-
tiveness of our antibiotic-resistant strain. We inoculated
colonies with a varying number of cells, at a concentration
of carbenicillin that selected against antibiotic resistance in
Fig. 2 Natural selection for resistance in bacterial colonies. Suscep
tible and resistant strains were competed over 7 days on solid agar with
either streptomycin (intracellular resistance) or carbenicillin (extra
cellular resistance). On streptomycin, resistant strains outcompete
susceptible strains at all concentrations of antibiotic (a, red line
denotes susceptible growth in the presence of the resistant strain, black
line denotes susceptible growth alone), where skulls denote that no
colony forming units of the susceptible strain were observed. How
ever, the resistant strain increased the growth rate of the sensitive strain
in the presence of carbenicillin, demonstrating cross protection (b).
Resistant growth increases in the presence of streptomycin when the
susceptible strain is present (c, red line denotes resistant growth in the
presence of the susceptible strain, grey line denotes resistant growth
alone) but is suppressed by the presence of the susceptible strain on
carbenicillin (d, red line denotes resistant growth in the presence of the
susceptible strain, grey line denotes resistant growth alone). This
relative increase in resistant growth, on streptomycin, with the sus
ceptible strain, is expected from a competition effect, specifically the
resistant strain outcompeting the susceptible strain for resources more
effectively than against another resistant strain. Streptomycin always
selects for resistance (e), whereas low doses of carbenicillin select for
the sensitive strain (f). Representative images of the colonies in which
yellow resistant and red susceptible strains are competed over 6 days,
also demonstrate this result (g, h) while control colonies, in which both
colours are susceptible, show the effect of these concentrations of
antibiotic on non resistant cells (i, j). The mean and standard error of
two experiments, each with n
6 for co cultures and n
3 for
monocultures, are shown (Colour figure online). See also Supple
mentary Figs. S2 and S3
 our earlier experiments (Fig. 2). Inoculating with fewer cells
leads to a greater degree of spatial structure in the form of
larger clonal patches (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S5)
[42]. In line with our prediction, the fate of the resistant
cells was reversed under conditions of low inoculation
density and they were able to outcompete the susceptible
cells (two-way ANOVA, F1, 15 = 10.9, P = 0.005), (left
hand data point, Fig. 4e). By contrast, at higher inoculation
densities, we observe that susceptible cells can outcompete
resistant cells, replicating our earlier results. Moreover, the
effect of density on competition is not seen until after 2 days
of growth, once the communities are fully confluent (Sup-
plementary Fig. S5). This suggests it is spatiogenetic
structure within the colonies that is key to the observed
effects, not simply the fact susceptible cells are physically
isolated for longer at a low inoculation density (Fig. 4).
If spatial structure within colonies is capable of causing
resistant strains to outcompete susceptible strains, then
removing spatial structure should remove the competitive
advantage of resistant strains. In order to test this prediction,
we mixed one set of colonies daily using an inoculation
loop [14]. When there was no antibiotic present, this mixing
had no effect on susceptible fitness (three-way ANOVA, F1,
31 = 0.978, P = 0.33). However, as predicted, mixing the
low-density treatment reversed the outcome of the compe-
tition such that the resistant strain was no longer able to
outcompete the susceptible strain (three-way ANOVA, F1,
28 = 5.2, P = 0.03), (Fig. 4e, g). Simply disordering a bac-
terial
colony,
therefore,
can
remove
the
competitive
advantage of an antibiotic-resistant strain. In sum, our data
show that spatial structure in bacterial communities can be
critical for the spread of antibiotic resistance.
Fig. 3 Cross protection of susceptible cells by resistant cells is sup
ported by the degree of cell filamentation. Confocal images of the
colony edge after 2 days show carbenicillin causes susceptible cells to
filament, when grown alone on increasing concentrations of antibiotic
(a, moving horizontally across the first row, both red and yellow cells
are susceptible). The presence of the resistant strain causes susceptible
cells to filament less (b, moving across second row, susceptible cells in
yellow, resistant cells in red) than when they are grown alone at the
same concentration of antibiotic (a, top row). At intermediate
concentrations of carbenicillin there is enrichment at the edge for the
susceptible strain when in competition with the resistant strain (b,
centre panels, susceptible strain in yellow, resistant strain in red).
When the resistant cells are grown alone on the antibiotic (c, both
colours are resistant) they do not filament at these concentrations of
carbenicillin. The MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) is the
lowest concentration of antibiotic that completely inhibits growth of
susceptible cells (here measured in a colony (Colour figure online))
(Supplementary Table S1)
 An unexpected benefit to antibiotic susceptibility
Our experiments demonstrate that density and spatial
structure can be fundamentally important for the rise of
resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. Moreover, our data
generally support a simple model where resistant cells
experience a growth rate cost from carrying a plasmid,
and will cross-protect susceptible cells when they are
nearby (high density and low spatiogenetic structure).
However, there are a number of intriguing patterns in our
data,
which
all
suggest
that
this
simple
view
is
insufficient.
 The first observation is that low doses of carbenicillin
can actually benefit the sensitive strain. Specifically, the
fitness advantage of the susceptible strain doubles from
5.5 to 11 % upon the addition of low doses of carbenicillin
(t16 = −2.9, P = 0.01). One explanation for this strong
effect could be that carbenicillin promotes the growth
of susceptible cells. However, we see no evidence for
growth promotion in pure cultures (Figs. 1b and 2b)
and, more importantly, the increase in fitness in mixed
culture is due to a decrease in the growth rate of resistant
cells, not an increase in the susceptible cells (red line
in Fig. 2b, d). This effect on resistant cells is also not a
direct effect of the antibiotic, as this depression of growth
rate is not seen in pure resistant cultures (grey line in
Fig. 2d). Instead, the antibiotic is somehow shifting the
balance of competition in mixed culture towards the sus-
ceptible strain and allowing it to suppress the growth of the
resistant strain.
Competition within colonies is intense and a large body
of theoretical and empirical work has shown that the effects
of natural selection occur primarily at the growing edges
[14, 43 45]. In particular, this shows that it is the lateral
growing edge
forming the circumference of a colony
that is most critical (upwards growth is much more limited
than lateral growth). This led us to hypothesise that sus-
ceptible cells were somehow able to obtain better access to
the lateral growing edge, allowing them to grow outwards
and inhibit the growth of resistant cells. All of our fre-
quency data so far has been from measurements of the
whole colony (Figs. 1, 2, 4). Focussing in on the growing
edges of colonies does indeed reveal that the edge becomes
increasingly dominated by susceptible cells over time
(Fig. 3b, middle row). However, this might happen simply
because susceptible cells divide faster (above, Supplemen-
tary Fig. S4) and does not demonstrate an additional
mechanism that allows them to dominate at the edge. To
assess the importance of positioning, we need to experi-
mentally test whether susceptible cells do better with anti-
biotic because they can influence spatial structure.
This test was inadvertently performed in the experiment
in Fig. 4, which examines whether increases or decreases in
genetic mixing affect cross-protection. As discussed above,
mixing up the colonies enabled cross-protection and bene-
fitted susceptible cells in the low-density treatment. How-
ever, there was a second and unexpected effect of mixing.
In high-density inoculations, where cells start off well-
mixed, physically mixing colonies reduces susceptible fit-
ness (Fig. 4e, right hand points). Moreover, this effect is
caused by increasing the resistant cell abundance (Fig. 4c).
Disrupting spatial structure in colonies where susceptible
cells are already winning, therefore, reduces susceptible
fitness. This is exactly what is predicted from a model
where antibiotic treatment somehow helps susceptible cells
to obtain a better position in the colony. This model also
predicts that the effect of mixing is not seen in the absence
of antibiotics, which is also the case (Fig. 4f).
Cell shape and the increased fitness of susceptible
cells
How does antibiotic exposure allow susceptible cells to find
more favourable positions in the colony? Inspection of the
colony edge gave a clear candidate: susceptible cells in
mixed colonies change shape upon the addition of anti-
biotics (Fig. 3). If shape is important, then a key prediction
is that changes in cell shape should proceed any increase in
the frequency of susceptible cells. To test this prediction we
tracked the aspect ratio of cells during competitions and
compared this with the frequency of susceptible and resis-
tant cells at each time point. Consistent with the shape-
drives-fitness model, the elongation of susceptible cells
occurs prior to their competitive gains against resistant cells
(Fig. 5).
Time-lapse imaging of the colony edge highlighted a
candidate mechanism for the advantage of elongated cells.
We see sets of elongated cells that align orthogonally to the
edge of the colony and push themselves outwards. This
enables cells to grow ahead of the resistant strain and cut it
off from the growing edge (Fig. 6a). The clearest support
for the effect of cell shape would come from manipulating
the shape of susceptible cells to ask how shape affects the
ability to spatially organise and compete. We do not know
of any route to prevent susceptible cells from elongating
under antibiotic treatment without strong pleiotropic effects
on growth rate and other phenotypes. However, a recent
study that combined individual-based modelling with the
study of cell shape mutants in Escherichia coli also suggests
that cell shape can be important for positioning in bacterial
Fig. 4 Spatiogenetic structure and the evolution of antibiotic resis
tance. Susceptible (red) and resistant (yellow) strains were co
inoculated onto plates containing either no antibiotic (black line) or
12 μg/ml carbenicillin (red line) (a d). Final cell counts are shown
here, as opposed to cell divisions (Figs. 1 and 2), because the use of
different densities itself changes the number of cell divisions that occur
(low cell density treatments experienced reduced nutrient competition
and increased cell division). The final cell count removes this effect
and is an easier metric to interpret. The growth data is shown in the
Supplementary Information (Supplementary Fig. S5). From this data,
the relative susceptible fitness was calculated (e, f). The extent of
separation between susceptible and resistant strains in a colony can be
varied with the number of inoculating cells, as can be seen in images
taken after 6 days (g, h). Mixing (dotted line, bottom row of g and h)
decreases the fitness of the resistant strain in colonies with a low initial
density (colonies in LHS row in g go redder upon mixing (bottom
row)) and increases fitness in colonies with a high initial density
(colonies in middle and RHS row go yellower upon mixing, bottom
row). The mean and standard error of two experiments, each with n
3, are shown (Colour figure online). See also Supplementary Fig. S5
 biofilms [46]. Moreover, filamentation of Bacillus subtilis
can increase migration away from the colony [47].
We, therefore, extended the simulation models of Smith
et al. [46] in order to study the effect of cell shape on
positioning at the edge of a colony (Fig. 6 and Supple-
mentary Fig. S6). We focused on the growing edge because
this is the critical area of competition in an expanding
colony and the region where we see strong enrichment for
elongated susceptible cells. As we observe in the time-lapse
imaging (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Movie S1), the
individual-based model shows how long cells can align
themselves orthogonally to the colony edge and push out-
wards occluding shorter cells from the edge. This gives
them a competitive advantage as they can spread outwards,
allowing them to align with the direction of growth ahead of
resistant strains and hence to dominate the growing edge
(Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. S6).
To summarise, the combination of competition data,
imaging and our individual-based simulations all support
a model where carbenicillin drives cell elongation and
Fig. 5 Susceptible cells increase in aspect ratio before outcompeting
resistant cells in carbenicillin treated colonies. Yellow susceptible and
red resistant cells were competed on either 12 μg/ml carbenicillin (red)
or no antibiotic (black). The edge of these colonies was then imaged
during growth to measure cell length and relative cell numbers (a, b).
The bottom images are micrographs of the colony edge under the
different conditions showing the shifts in aspect ratio in susceptible
cells, in the presence of resistant cells, during carbenicillin treatment
(c). The mean and standard error of two experiments, each with n
3,
are shown. (Colour figure online)
 this provides an unexpected, but strong, fitness advantage
to susceptible cells during biofilm growth. In combina-
tion with the effects of cross-protection, this means that
sub-MIC doses of carbenicillin can inhibit bacterial
growth while selecting against an antibiotic-resistant
strain.
Discussion
Understanding the spread of antibiotic-resistant strains is a
major goal for both science and society. In well-mixed broth
cultures, we find that selection for resistance is strong,
irrespective of the mechanism of resistance. In contrast, we
Fig. 6 Cell shape is important for competition at the edge of colonies.
Micrographs show longer susceptible cells (yellow) extending from
the colony edge and occluding shorter resistant cells (red). This is
shown in time lapse images of growth at the edge of a representative
colony after 10 h, growing on 12 μg/ml carbenicillin (a). These images
differ in quality from earlier images (e.g., Fig. 5) because we had to
use a lower fluorescence intensity to avoid bleaching during time lapse
imaging. An individual based model shows the same effect (b). In the
model, we can alter cell shape alone and follow its effects on cell
sorting. Starting from a random configuration of Susceptible (S) and
Resistant (R) cells in a 1:1 mixture, at t1, we observe that long cells
extend from the colony edge (t2, black arrows). This improves their
resource access and, as in our experiments, allows them to occlude the
shorter cells from the edge. This, in turn stimulates further growth (t3,
black arrows). By t4, S cells have become enriched at the colony edge
through positive feedback. Histograms of cell x coordinates track the
growth of the colony edge and quantify the shape driven enrichment
process in the individual based model, taken at the same 4 time points
as in b (c). p(x) shows the probability of finding a given strain at a
given point in the colony. Data merged from a sample of 20 simula
tions; times t1 t4 correspond to 12, 24, 36 and 56 h of growth,
respectively. The colour brightness intensity of each cell corresponds
to its growth rate, with brighter cells indicating faster growth (Colour
figure online). See also Supplementary Fig. S6
 find that selection for resistance in colonies depends criti-
cally on the mechanism of resistance, the spatiogenetic
structure of colonies and the regulatory responses of sen-
sitive cells to antibiotic exposure. Although bacterial colo-
nies are a simplification of natural communities, we find
they are sufficient to show that structured communities have
both complex and surprising effects on selection for anti-
biotic resistance.
Consistent with theory ([14, 32 35], Supplementary
Fig. S4), we see that growth in colonies greatly increases
the strength of competition between strains, because rapidly
growing bacteria preferentially gain access to the nutrient-
rich edge of the colony. All else being equal, this should
increase the strength of selection for resistance in colonies.
It is difficult to directly compare the results of broth and
colony competition experiments with each other, because
there are many differences between these two modes of
growth other than spatial structure. However, it is clear from
our colony competition experiments that selection for car-
benicillin resistance was notably weak in colonies. Indeed,
of the four conditions we consider (two growth conditions,
two antibiotics), we only see evidence for cooperative
resistance for colony growth on carbenicillin. In the other
three conditions, antibiotic resistance serves only to protect
the cells that carry it.
Our experiments, which included disrupting spatioge-
netic structure, are consistent with extracellular β-lactamase
production protecting the sensitive strain under colony
growth. Indeed, this protection can be so strong that the
susceptible strain outcompetes and outnumbers the resistant
strain in the colony (Figs. 3 and 4), as predicted by evo-
lutionary theory for costly cooperative traits [20, 48]. Fur-
thermore, by focussing on the growing edge, where natural
selection is at its most powerful [34, 49], we discovered a
second unexpected effect. Our data and theory suggest that
exposure to low levels of carbenicillin leads to cell elon-
gation, which allows susceptible bacteria to preferentially
access the growing edge of treated colonies (Figs. 5 and 6).
Importantly, these two factors are also associated with
greatly weakened natural selection for antibiotic resistance.
Specifically, the dose of carbenicillin required to generate
selection for resistance is over an order of magnitude higher
than for streptomycin that is chemically modified inside the
cell (20 μg/ml; 62% MIC versus 0.78 μg/ml; 2.4% MIC); an
effect not seen in the liquid experiments (Supplementary
Table S2). The broader consequence of this is that natural
selection for a multidrug-resistant strain may be reduced by
treatment with an antibiotic that targets a cooperative
resistance mechanism. More generally, it suggests that
drugs with strong extracellular effects, like β-lactamases,
may be particularly amenable to treatment strategies inten-
ded to slow the rate of resistance evolution. However, this
requires the identification of doses that are high enough to
limit bacterial growth but low enough to allow susceptible
strains to remain competitive relative to resistant strains. We
have identified these conditions in our experiments, but
additional work is needed to see if they can be harnessed as
part of a treatment strategy.
In conclusion, our work cautions against the focus on
liquid culture assays for understanding antibiotic resistance
evolution. Few pathogenic bacteria live like this and we
have shown that competitive outcomes in dense commu-
nities can be very different. Encouragingly, this shift in
perspective may help to identify exposure regimes that
suppress the growth of sensitive strains without favouring
resistant strains [50 52].
