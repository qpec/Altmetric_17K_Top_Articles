Abstract 
Background:  
There are 37 million people living with HIV (PLHIV) and 115 million people with antibodies to 
Hepatitis C (HCV). Little is known about the extent of HIV/HCV co-infection. We sought to 
characterise the epidemiology and burden of HCV co-infection among PLHIV. 
Methods:  
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE CINAHL+, POPLINE, Africa-wide Information, Global Health, Web of 
Science, and WHO databases for studies measuring prevalence of HCV and HIV, published from 
2002-2015. Populations were categorised according to HIV exposure, with the regional burden of co-
infection being derived by applying co-infection prevalence estimates to published numbers of 
PLHIV. We conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the odds of HCV among PLHIV compared to their 
negative counterparts.  
Findings: 
Among PLHIV, HIV/HCV co-infection is 2·4% (IQR=0·8-5·8%) within general population samples, 4% 
(IQR 1·2-8·4%) within pregnant or heterosexually exposed samples, 6.4% (IQR 3·2-10·0%) among 
men who have sex with men (MSM) and 82·4% (IQR 55·2-88·5%) among people who inject drugs 
(PWID). Odds of HCV infection is 6 times higher among PLHIV. Globally, there are 2·3 million 
HIV/HCV co-infections (IQR 1·3-4·3) of whom 1.3 million (IQR 0.8-1.4) are PWID, equalling an overall 
co-infection prevalence among PLHIV of 6·2% (IQR 3·4-11·9%).  
Interpretation: 
We found a consistently higher HCV prevalence among PLHIV across all risk groups and regions, but 
especially in PWID. There is a clear mandate to prioritise routine testing of HCV among all PLHIV, but 
targeted approaches are specifically needed for PWID and MSM. There is a need to improve country 
level monitoring of prevalence of HCV.

INTRODUCTION 
HIV and Hepatitis C (HCV) infection are major global public health concerns, with overlapping modes 
of transmission and affected populations. As of December 2014, an estimated 36.9 million people 
were living with HIV, 2·3 million were newly infected and 1·6 million died.1 While HIV transmission 
has declined since 2001, with improved survival due to the scale-up of anti-retroviral therapies 
(ART), more people are living with HIV than ever before.2 It was estimated that in 2005 over 184 
million people were HCV antibody positive.3 More recent data suggest this has declined to 115 
million (92-149)4, with this being attributed to improved screening of blood supply, decreases in 
injecting risk behaviours and differences in prevalence reported from South East Asia. However, 
other evidence5 6 suggests the disease burden remains high, with 3-4 million new infections and 
350,000 deaths occurring annually.3, 7 HCV treatment has been transformed with the advent of direct 
acting antivirals (DAAs) which offer high cure rates within 12-24 weeks.8   
The interaction between HIV and HCV co-infection impacts on the transmission and natural history 
of HCV infection. The transmission efficiency of HCV increases in the presence of HIV infection, with 
the perinatal transmission risk doubling among HIV-infected mothers.9, 10 People living with HIV 
(PLHIV) without treatment are less likely to spontaneously clear HCV infection, have higher HCV viral 
loads and experience more rapid HCV disease progression than those without HIV infection.11 
Although ART improves outcomes in HCV co-infected patients, with decreased HCV-related 
mortality,12 HCV co-infection may also complicate HIV treatment, with some evidence suggesting an 
increased risk of drug-related hepatoxicity among those on ART.
12 There remains a lack of consistent 
data on the impact of HCV co-infection on HIV progression.13 9, 12  
As PLHIV live longer, HCV-related liver disease in co-infected patients is becoming a major cause of 
morbidity and mortality. However, the burden of HIV-HCV co-infection is poorly understood. One 
review suggested 4-5 million PLHIV are infected with HCV14, but relied on a small number of studies 
and unclear methodologies, while a second reported prevalence from selected studies only.15 Other 
reviews have provided estimates for sub-Saharan Africa only16 17 or among people who inject drugs 
(PWID)18, but there have been no reviews documenting the global burden of HCV co-infection 
among PLHIV. Reliable estimates are needed to determine the scale of the public health problem 
posed by HCV co-infection and to inform regional and national strategies for hepatitis screening and 
management.19-23 We therefore undertook a systematic review to estimate the prevalence and 
global burden of HCV co-infection among PLHIV. 
 
METHODS 
Search strategy and selection criteria 
We searched eight databases for material that reported the prevalence of HCV and HIV, published 
between 2002 and 2015, following the PRISMA guidelines.24 The searches were done in January 
2015 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL+, POPLINE, Africa-wide Information, Global Health, Web of 
Science, and the Cochrane Library, Index Medicus of the Eastern Mediterranean Region, Index 
Medicus of the South-East Asian Region, LILACS and Western Pacific Region Index Medicus. All 
language sources were included. Search terms included: ‘HIV OR Human immunodeficiency virus’ 
and ‘OR Hepatitis-C OR HCV’ and ‘prevalen* OR inciden* OR seroprevalen* OR screening OR 
surveillance OR population* OR survey* OR epidem* OR data collection OR population sample* OR 
community survey* OR cohort OR cross-sectional OR longitude* OR follow-up’. Searches were 
tailored to each database. Reference lists were screened for additional sources.  
 
We included papers with estimates of HCV co-infection among HIV population samples greater than 
50, recruited based on HIV infection status or other behavioural characteristic. We excluded 
editorials or reviews containing no primary data, samples of HCV or HIV/HCV infected individuals, or 
 4 
 
samples relying on self-reported infection status. We excluded samples drawn from populations 
with other co-morbidities or undergoing interventions that put them at greater risk of co-infection.  
Screening and data extraction 
Two reviewers (CM, BM) screened all sources for inclusion, with a third reviewer (LP) consulted 
when necessary. Data extracted included: study methods; field-work dates; population sampled; 
recruitment site; sample size; diagnostic assays used; and prevalence of co-infection. For 10% of 
included studies, data were double extracted by a second author (EG) to check for accuracy. 
 
Quality assessment  
Studies were rated according to their study design and assay quality (Appendix, Box 1). Studies with 
larger sample sizes, recruited from multiple sites, recording age, sex or HIV risk-factors were scored 
higher (A) and lower scores (C) were given if none were reported. HCV antibody assay methods were 
rated from 0 where no assay type was specified, up to 3 when they used a 2nd or 3rd generation HCV 
antibody assay with confirmatory testing. Best estimates were selected for each population group 
per country based on the highest study design and assay score. Where multiple estimates existed, 
we applied decision rules to select the best estimate (Appendix Box 2). 
 
Classification of countries according to Global Burden of Disease region 
Countries were grouped according to the 21 Global Burden of Disease regions, consistent with 
previous published reviews on HCV burden.3, 25  
 
Definition of Population groups 
Populations were categorised according to their main HIV exposure categories. General population 
samples were considered low-risk, and included samples of blood donors (unpaid), ante-natal clinic 
attendees or general population surveys, not recruited based on HIV positive status. Samples of 
PLHIV reporting heterosexual transmission as the main risk factor or pregnant women were grouped 
together. We categorised samples as PWID when >75% of individuals had experience of injecting, 
and as men who have sex with men (MSM) when >75% reported main HIV exposure to be sex with 
men. These two groups included studies of PLHIV and populations recruited based on risk behaviour. 
Other population groups included: PLHIV reporting any injecting drug use (but <75% had experience 
of injecting); sex workers; prison inmates; drug users (non-injecting); high-risk (recruited from STI 
clinics or a mixed population engaging in sexual and/or injecting risk behaviours but <75% had 
experience of injecting).   
 
Data synthesis  
We reported HIV/HCV co-infection prevalence among four population groups by country and region, 
reporting the best estimate and range for each country. Global and regional prevalence estimates 
were derived from the median of the ‘best’ estimates for that region with the inter-quartile range 
(IQR). Data were entered into ArcGIS 10·2 (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, CA.) 
to generate maps presenting country-level HIV/HCV co-infection prevalence estimates.  
 
We synthesised estimates across six independent population groups (general population, PWID, 
MSM, sex workers, prison inmates and high-risk populations) on overall HCV co-infection and mono-
infection prevalence, and undertook a meta-analysis across the ‘best’ estimates of the odds of being 
HCV-positive among HIV-positive populations compared to HIV-negative populations, stratified by 
population group. A standard correction of 0·5 was added to all zero prevalence estimates using 
STATA 13·1 (Stata Corp, College Station, Tex). Odds ratios were calculated through a Mantel-
Haenszel method with a random-effect model. Meta-analysis are presented as forest plots.

We report global and regional estimates of burden of HCV co-infection among PLHIV. Using number 
of PLHIV by country and region estimated by the Joint United Nations Programmes on HIV/AIDS 
(UNAIDS)1, we applied the median HCV co-infection prevalence among PLHIV for non-PWID samples 
from the literature search for MSM, general population and HIV-positive samples of pregnant 
women or those heterosexually exposed by sub-regions and then overall. The HCV prevalence 
among HIV-positive PWID was also applied to the distribution of HIV-positive PWID across sub-
regions, as estimated by UNAIDS.26  
 
Role of the funding source 
The WHO commissioned this review to inform the update of the WHO guidelines on screening of co-
infections and initiation of ART. The funder contributed to the data collection, analysis, 
interpretation, and writing of the review. All authors had full access to the study data and share final 
responsibility for the findings submitted for publication. 
 
RESULTS 
From a total of 31,767 publication references, 783 papers met the inclusion criteria resulting in 902 
estimates of the prevalence of HIV/HCV co-infection (Figure 1). 
Availability of estimates by region  
Co-infection estimates were identified for 89 of the 194 countries (46%). In Sub Saharan African, the 
most estimates were identified in East Africa (11/15), then South Africa (4/6), and fewest in Central 
and West Africa (9/24). A total of seven estimates were identified in North Africa and the Middle 
East (7/21).  Estimates were found in every country in North America (n=2) but the minority of 
countries in South America (8/21) and the Caribbean (3/15). Estimates were identified in 8 countries 
in South and South East Asia (8/17), three countries in Asia Pacific and Australasia (n=17), and one in 
East Asia (n=2). Across Europe, a total of 9 estimates were identified in Eastern European (9/12) and 
Central Asian countries, 18 in Western (18/24) and 5 in Central European countries (5/12).  
Prevalence of HIV/HCV co-infection  
General population samples 
The mid-point prevalence of HCV co-infection among 30 HIV-infected general population samples 
was 2.4% (IQR 0·8-5·8%). The highest prevalence was in North Africa and the Middle East (5.8%) and 
the lowest prevalence in East Africa (0.6%). Within these general population samples, prevalence 
was highest among blood donors at >10% in India and Nepal, and 7% in Brazil.27-30 All estimates are 
summarised in Table 1. 
PLHIV (heterosexual and pregnant women) 
The mid-point prevalence of HCV co-infection among 95 studies in PLHIV (heterosexual /pregnant 
women) was 4·0% (IQR 1·2-8·4%). Prevalence was highest in West and Central Africa (9·0%, IQR 8·0-
11·0) and lowest in Southern Africa (0·5%, IQR 0-1·0%).  
MSM 
The mid-point prevalence among 80 MSM samples was 6·4% (IQR 3·2-10·0%). Prevalence was 
highest in North America (16·2%, IQR= 15·2-17·3%) and lowest in East Asia and South and South East 
Asia (2·0%).  
PWID  
 6 
 
The mid-point prevalence among 123 studies of PWID (≥75% of sample ever PWID) was 82·4% (IQR 
55·2-84·5%) with little regional variation. The highest prevalence was in North Africa/Middle East 
(88·5%) and lowest in Western and Central Europe (69·9% and 58·5% respectively). There were a 
further 333 estimates from samples of PLHIV, where injecting drug use was a key exposure but <75% 
of the sample injected drugs. Among these estimates, the median prevalence of injecting drug use 
was 29·0% (IQR 13·9-46·%). There was a clear association between the prevalence of self-reported 
injecting drug use and HIV/HCV co-infection prevalence (Figure 3 – correlation coefficient 0·89, 
p<0.001).  
 
Odds of HCV infection among HIV-positive relative to HIV-negative persons 
Across all population groups, there was a 5·8-fold (95% CI 4·5-7·5) increased odds of HCV positivity 
among HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative persons, but with high heterogeneity (I squared 
95·7%, p<0·001). Odds of HCV were highest among HIV-positive prison inmates (OR=17·4, 95%CI 7·6-
39·5), but comparable among MSM (OR=7·5 95% CI 4·4-12·7), PWID (OR=6·0, 95%CI 4·2-8·7) and 
other high-risk populations (OR=6·8 95%CI 4·0-11·5), then lowest among sex workers (OR=3·1, 95%CI 
1·4-6·8) and general population samples (OR=1·6, 95% CI 1·0-2·5). Within study heterogeneity was 
high for all population groups except for general population and sex-worker samples where it was 
moderate. See Figure 4 and Online Table 2. 
 
Global burden of HCV co-infection among PLHIV 
We estimate that there are 2,278,400 (IQR=1,271,300-4,417,000) cases of HCV co-infection among 
PLHIV globally, of which 1,362,700 (IQR=847,700-1,381,800) are among HIV-positive PWID. This 
gives a global prevalence of HCV co-infection among PLHIV of 6·2% (IQR 3·4-11·9%). Eastern Europe 
and Central Asia has the largest burden, representing 27% of the total, reflecting the large 
population of PWID (Table 2). 
DISCUSSION 
This is the first global systematic review of the prevalence and burden of HCV among HIV infected 
persons. We estimate 2·3 million (IQR 1·3-4·4 million) cases of HCV co-infection among PLHIV 
globally, making a global prevalence of 6·2%, of whom 59% are PWID. The greatest burden is in 
Eastern Europe and Central Asia, due to the large HIV-infected population of PWID, where an 
estimated 607,700 HIV infected persons are co-infected with HCV infection, followed by 429,600 in 
Sub Saharan Africa. Prevalence of HCV co-infection among HIV-infected populations varies widely 
and is highest among PWID (82·4%, 55·2-88·5%), then MSM (6·4%, 3·2-10·0%) and pregnant or 
heterosexually exposed populations (4·0%, 1·2-8·4%), and lowest among general population samples 
(2·4%, 0·8-5·8%). 
 
Findings corroborate previous evidence that South Asia, East Asia and Eastern Europe constitute the 
largest populations of anti-HCV infections.3, 4 We found clear geographic differences in estimated 
HIV/HCV prevalence across population groups. Among general population samples, prevalence was 
highest in South America (3·9%) and West and Central Africa (3·6%) and lowest in East Africa (0·6%).  
Among HIV-positive pregnant women or those with heterosexual exposure, prevalence was again 
highest in West and Central Africa (9%), but lower in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa. Previous reviews 
of HIV/HCV co-infection in Sub-Saharan Africa found a prevalence of between 5·7% and 7% among 
HIV positive cohorts, which is within the range of our estimates.16 17 One of these reviews also 
reported comparably high rates of HCV co-infection in West Africa, but higher rates in South and 
East Africa than our review. A lack of data on risk behaviours made comparison of these regional 
differences challenging.17 Among PWID, HIV/HCV co-infection prevalence is higher than 80% in six 
 7 
 
regions, particularly in regions where there are large populations of PWID with concentrated HIV 
epidemics, including Central and Eastern Europe, South and South East Asia and North America.31    
 
PWID 
This global review corroborates other evidence showing the importance of injecting drug use in 
driving the HCV epidemic among PWID and PLHIV, and that the highest burden of HCV among PWID 
is in the Russian Federation and China. 25, 32 We found a six-fold increased odds of HCV infection 
among HIV positive compared to HIV negative PWID population groups. This is consistent with 
parenteral transmission being the primary mode of HIV and HCV acquisition among PWID, and HCV 
being much more easily transmitted than HIV.33 These findings highlight the urgent need to scale-up 
HIV and HCV prevention interventions among PWID including needle/syringe exchange programmes, 
opiate substitution therapy and provision of ART, both globally and specifically in Eastern Europe 
and South East Asia.34 In addition, the new era of highly curative short course direct acting antiviral 
therapies for HCV offer the potential to not only improve individual clinical outcomes but also 
reduce transmission,35 and therefore emphasises the importance of ensuring equitable access of 
PWID to HCV testing and DAA treatment.32, 35 
 
 
MSM 
Overall, there was moderate HCV co-infection among HIV-positive MSM samples with an eight-fold 
increased odds of HCV infection in HIV-infected MSM compared to HIV-uninfected MSM. This data 
aligns well with growing evidence suggesting MSM are increasingly vulnerable to HCV transmission, 
in part fuelled by the use of new psychoactive substances, increased sexual and injecting risk and 
sero-sorting within this risk group.36, 37 Evidence also suggests high rates of HCV re-infection 
following spontaneous clearance or treatment among HIV-positive MSM highlighting the need for 
repeated testing and targeted interventions among this population. 38 
 
 
Data limitations 
Despite a systematic search of published and unpublished literature, estimates were only identified 
in 46% of countries globally, with few country-level estimates among general population samples. 
The study quality was variable highlighting the need for more robust monitoring of HCV among 
PLHIV, and increased transparency in the methodologies used as well as availability of estimates to 
facilitate monitoring of global trends. The higher co-infection prevalence among blood donors clearly 
shows the need for careful screening of blood donations for HCV and highlights the problems in 
inferring general population prevalence from this population. 27-30 Given this potential bias, it is 
possible that our general population estimate for co-infection is an over-estimate, although it falls 
within the range published in previous regionally-focussed reviews and estimates are consistently 
lower than for other groups engaging in higher-risk behaviours. Higher prevalence among blood 
donors were observed in studies conducted prior to 2008 than more recent studies, indicative of 
improved screening of donors.17 28, 39-41  The high level of within-study heterogeneity within our 
meta-analysis urge some caution in our interpretation of the impact of HIV positivity on odds of HCV 
infection particularly for prison inmates where the confidence intervals are wide, PWID and high-risk 
populations. 
 
Our global review focussed on published literature and did not include an exhaustive review of grey 
literature, as applied in other systematic reviews of this kind42, though the inclusion of WHO 
databases and Global Health captured some unpublished grey literature. We lastly acknowledge that 
our focus on HCV antibody prevalence fails to fully determine the burden of active HCV infections 
 8 
 
among PLHIV (determined by HCV RNA positivity). Only 10% (92) of our estimates contained data on 
HCV RNA, the majority of which (47%) were derived from studies in North America or Western 
Europe.  It is estimated that between 20-30% of those exposed to HCV antibodies will spontaneously 
clear the virus and be HCV RNA negative but remain antibody positive and this may differ across 
populations.43, 44 Given the paucity of data and diversity in geographic regions, populations and risk 
groups covered in the review we considered that a focus on antibody prevalence better reflects the 
epidemiology of exposure and infection.  
 
Conclusion  
International guidelines recommend HCV screening for PLHIV in many settings, and provision of 
appropriate HCV care for those chronically infected.19-23  However, this is currently poorly 
implemented, particularly in low and middle income settings, and among populations such as PWID, 
prisoners, sex workers and MSM.32, 45  There is a clear mandate to prioritise screening of blood 
donors and routine testing of HCV among all PLHIV, but targeted approaches are needed for PWID 
and MSM where the magnitude of HCV infection risk has not been met with a commensurate 
investment in surveillance, testing and treatment. There is also a need to improve country-level data 
on prevalence of HCV among all populations to help them define their epidemiology and inform 
policies for hepatitis C testing, prevention, care and treatment. This is particularly important in 
countries with growing populations of PWID and concentrated HIV epidemics among PWID and 
MSM, but also in Sub-Saharan Africa where the burden of co-infection is large due to the high 
burden of HIV.  This will need investment in building HCV surveillance and care and treatment 
capacity.

Research in context 
Previous reviews of HIV/HCV co-infection have focussed on specific regions or sub-populations or 
not employed systematic review methodologies to extract and synthesise data. Data are needed to 
establish the global burden of HCV co-infection among PLHIV, identify the populations at risk and the 
key geographical regions most affected. This is essential in order to inform normative guidance and 
service delivery for testing and care and treatment services. 
 
What this study adds 
We estimate a mid-point of 2·3 million (IQR 1·3-4·3 million) cases of HIV/HCV co-infection globally, of 
whom over half - an estimated 1.3 million (IQR 0·89-1·4 million) are PWID. This equates to a global 
HCV co-infection prevalence of 6·2% (IQR 3·4-11·9%) among PLHIV. The greatest burden of HIV-HCV 
co-infection is in Eastern Europe, where an estimated 607,700 HIV infected persons are co-infected 
with HCV infection, followed by 429,600 in Sub-Saharan Africa. Prevalence of HCV co-infection 
among PLHIV is highest (82·%, 55·2-88·5%) among PWID, comparable among MSM (6·4%, IQR=3·2-
10·0%) and pregnant or heterosexually exposed populations (4·0%, 1·2-8·4%), and lowest among 
general population samples (2.4%, IQR=0·8-5·8%). Odds of HCV infection is 6 times higher among 
PLHIV than HIV negative populations ranging from 1.6 times higher among the general population, 3 
times higher among sex workers and 6-8 times higher among MSM, PWID and high risk populations. 
 
Implications 
Our findings clearly shows that PLHIV are at high risk of HCV infection, particularly PWID who 
constitute 58% of the global burden of HCV co-infections among PLHIV. Routine testing of HCV 
among PLHIV is needed, but especially among PWID and MSM including good linkage to care and 
treatment. There is also a need to improve country level monitoring of prevalence of HCV among all 
population groups, both HIV positive and negative groups, to define the epidemiology and to inform 
hepatitis C testing, prevention, care and treatment services. This will require commensurate 
investment in building HCV surveillance and care and treatment capacity.

ⱡ Totals are derived from median of best estimates scored. ^ Range is presented for country level estimates and interquartile range for regional totals. All best estimate are selected according 
to the decision rules in Text Box 2, except for estimates provided for Heterosexual/Pregnant women in the Netherlands where the lower assay and study design score was selected to exclude 
the presentation of an outlier. * Denotes estimates (total) derived from samples of HIV+ pregnant women among the population group PLHIV (heterosexual and pregnant women) including: 
Nigeria (2)  1%; 22%; Malawi (1) 0·09%; Uganda (1) 0·6%; Brazil (2) 5%; 15·5%; USA (1) 3·8%, the Netherlands (1) 75%; Spain 29·7%, UK (1) 3%. References for all studies are listed in the Web
