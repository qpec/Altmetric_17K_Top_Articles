Abstract The heart switches its energy substrate from glucose to fatty acids at birth, and
maternal hyperglycemia is associated with congenital heart disease. However, little is known about
how blood glucose impacts heart formation. Using a chemically defined human pluripotent stem-
cell-derived cardiomyocyte differentiation system, we found that high glucose inhibits the
maturation of cardiomyocytes at genetic, structural, metabolic, electrophysiological, and
biomechanical levels by promoting nucleotide biosynthesis through the pentose phosphate
pathway. Blood glucose level in embryos is stable in utero during normal pregnancy, but glucose
uptake by fetal cardiac tissue is drastically reduced in late gestational stages. In a murine model of
diabetic pregnancy, fetal hearts showed cardiomyopathy with increased mitotic activity and
decreased maturity. These data suggest that high glucose suppresses cardiac maturation,
providing a possible mechanistic basis for congenital heart disease in diabetic pregnancy.

Introduction
Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common type of birth defect affecting 0.8% of human
live births (Fahed et al., 2013). Although genetic factors play a significant role in the development
of CHD, current genomic technologies, including exome sequencing and SNP arrays, have provided
a genetic diagnosis for only 11% of the probands (Gelb et al., 2013), highlighting the crucial role of
non-genetic contributors.
Among the non-genetic factors that influence the fetal heart, maternal hyperglycemia is the most
common medical condition, associated with a 2–5-fold increase in CHD independent of genetic con-
tributors (Centers for Disease Control, 1990; Simeone et al., 2015; Yogev and Visser, 2009). Dia-
betic
pregnancy
is
often
accompanied
by
maternal
complications
including
vasculopathy,
neuropathy, and insulin resistance, which potentially affect fetal cardiac formation indirectly. These
systemic complications are often subclinical, hindering the dissection of the pathomechanism of
CHD in diabetic pregnancy. Thus, despite the established association between maternal hyperglyce-
mia and malformation of the fetal heart, little is known about how glucose levels impact cardiomyo-
cyte
development
and
how
hyperglycemia
affects
heart
formation
in
diabetic
pregnancy
(Gaspar et al., 2014).
The metabolic environment is one potential non-genetic determinant of cell proliferation and dif-
ferentiation. Cells display distinct metabolic characteristics depending on their differentiation stage
(Carey et al., 2015; Tohyama et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2009), and the fuel type used by the cells
serves not merely as a source of energy but also as a critical regulator of self-renewal and differentia-
tion of stem or progenitor cells (Harris et al., 2013; Oburoglu et al., 2014; Shiraki et al., 2014;
Shyh-Chang et al., 2013). However, little is known about the mechanism. Cardiomyocytes shift their
energy substrate during late embryonic and neonatal stages (Makinde et al., 1998). Glucose is the
major energy source during the early developmental stages. Oxidative phosphorylation is low until
E10.5 of developing rodent hearts and rapidly increases between E10.5 and E14.5 (Cox and Gun-
berg, 1972). This coincides with the rapid maturation of the mitochondrial structure in embryonic
cardiomyocytes (Mackler et al., 1971). Shortly after birth, fatty acid oxidation becomes the predom-
inant source of ATP production to meet the high energy demand of the maturing heart
(Warshaw and Terry, 1970). These metabolic changes occur as a consequence of changes in the
expression of metabolic enzymes and transporters. However, it remains unclear whether and how
these metabolic changes, in turn, regulate the cardiac differentiation program.
Here, we describe the use of in vitro human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-
CMs) and an in vivo murine diabetic model to show that glucose not only induces cardiomyocyte
proliferation but also inhibits cardiomyocyte maturation. Glucose can be metabolized in multiple cat-
abolic and anabolic pathways, including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, the pentose phos-
phate pathway (PPP) and the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway. Our chemical screening revealed
that the pro-mitotic and anti-maturation effect of high glucose is regulated by glucose-derived deox-
ynucleotide biosynthesis through PPP. In vivo measurement of 18F-FDG accumulation revealed that
glucose uptake is drastically suppressed during the late gestational and early postnatal stages. Expo-
sure to high blood glucose in a murine model of diabetic pregnancy resulted in higher mitosis and
delayed maturation of fetal cardiomyocytes in vivo. Together, our data uncover how the dynamics of
glucose metabolism impact late embryonic cardiogenesis.
Results
Glucose reduction promotes hESC-CM differentiation
hESC-CMs were differentiated in monolayer in a chemically defined condition, reproducibly
yielding ~90% of MF20+ cardiomyocytes at day 14 with multiple cell lines including WA09 (H9) and
UCLA4 hESCs (Figure 1A–C) (Arshi et al., 2013; Minami et al., 2012). hESC-CMs start to beat syn-
chronously at around day 6–7 in our system. To characterize the differentiation stages, mRNA
expression profiles from H9 hESC-CMs were serially examined by RNA-seq at five distinct stages
(GSE84815): undifferentiated hESC (day 0); mesodermal precursor stage (hMP, day 2); cardiac

 progenitor stage (hCP, day 5); immature cardiomyocyte (hCM14); and hESC-CMS differentiated for
14 additional days (hCM28). The expression data were analyzed using signatures collected from
MSigDB,
a
body
atlas
and
primary
cell
atlas
(Mabbott
et
al.,
2013;
Su
et
al.,
2004;
Subramanian et al., 2005). As expected, the stem cell signature decreases during these five stages,
while signatures associated with heart and smooth muscle increase, further suggesting that our pro-
tocol leads to a high degree of enrichment for cardiomyocytes (Figure 1D and E). This differentia-
tion course is comparable to that reported in previous publications (Paige et al., 2012;
Wamstad et al., 2012).
To examine the impact of glucose levels on cardiac differentiation, hESC-CMs were cultured in
media containing various concentration of glucose, starting at the hCM14 stage when cells are
already differentiated to immature cardiomyocytes (Figure 2A, Video 1 and 2). The basal differenti-
ation medium contains 25 mM glucose, 0.9 mM pyruvate, essential and nonessential amino acids,
and human albumin (G25 medium). Interestingly, glucose dose-dependently suppressed the expres-
sion of TNNT2 (a cardiac marker), NKX2-5 (a cardiac marker), and PPARGC1A (a mitochondrial
marker) (Figure 2B). Gene expression profiling by RNA-seq revealed that genes that are related to
cardiac muscle and function are enriched in hESC-CMs in low glucose medium, and that genes
that are associated with mitosis and cell cycle are enriched in the high-glucose group genome-wide
(Figure 2C, Figure 2—figure supplement 1B; GSE84814). These data suggest that low glucose
after day 14 induces the differentiation and suppresses the cell cycle of hESC-CMs.
To validate these results, hESC-CM proliferation was analyzed by pH3 staining and EdU flow
cytometry analysis. Low glucose decreased mitotic activity at day 28 without affecting the viability of
hESC-CMs (Figure 2D,E). In addition, hESC-CMs in low glucose medium showed more robust stain-
ing of a-actinin, although the sarcomere length did not significantly change (Figure 2F, Figure 2—
figure supplement 1B). MitoTracker staining and flow cytometry analyses revealed that hESC-CMs
cultured in low glucose media have increased mitochondrial contents and inter-myofibrillar distribu-
tion of mitochondria, characteristic of differentiated cardiomyocytes (Figure 2F and G). Addition of
2-DG (2-deoxy-D-glucose), a competitive inhibitor of glucose phosphorylation, induced higher levels
eLife digest Congenital heart disease is the most common type of birth defect, affecting nearly
1 in 100 children born. It can involve a weak heart, narrowed arteries, narrowed heart valves, or the
main arteries of the heart switching places. These conditions can be fatal if untreated and often
need surgery to correct.
The mother’s blood sugar levels during pregnancy can have a large effect on how likely the baby
is to have congenital heart disease. If a pregnant woman has poorly controlled diabetes with rapidly
fluctuating sugar levels, she may be at a higher risk of having a child with the condition. High sugar
levels in the mother’s blood make the baby up to five times more likely to have congenital heart
disease. It has been difficult to find out exactly how sugar levels interfere with heart development
because diabetes can affect the fetus in many ways.
Nakano et al. used stem cells and experiments in pregnant mice with diabetes to hone in on how
high sugar levels affect the fetus’s heart development. First, heart cells were grown from human
stem cells, and exposed to high levels of glucose in a dish. This revealed a new mechanism for how
high sugar levels affect heart formation: the cells created too many nucleotides, the building blocks
of molecules such as DNA. It turns out that high glucose levels boosted a chemical process in the
cell known as the pentose phosphate pathway. Some of the products of this pathway are
nucleotides. This made the cells divide rapidly, but did not allow them to mature well compared
with cells exposed to normal levels of sugar. In another experiment, Nakano et al. found similar
results in pregnant diabetic mice. The heart cells in mouse fetuses also divided quickly but matured
slowly when exposed to high sugar levels.
An estimated 60 million women at an age to have children have diabetes. These new findings
help us to understand why and how these women are more likely to have children with congenital
heart disease, and further study will hopefully lead to a better way to prevent this condition.

 of MitoTracker and MF20 expression even in the presence of 5 mM or 25 mM glucose (Figure 2—
figure supplement 1C), suggesting that the effect is specific to glucose and not to changes in
osmotic pressure. Consistently, flow cytometry showed a significant increase in cell size under glu-
cose-restricted conditions (Figure 2I). Together, these results demonstrate that glucose dose-
dependently suppresses the maturation of cardiomyocyte cellular architecture and the upregulation
of cardiac genes in hESC-CMs.
Glucose reduction promotes functional maturation of hESC-CMs
We next compared the metabolic and functional maturity of hESC-CMs cultured in the presence and
absence of glucose by six methods. First, hESC-CMs were stained with JC-1, a green fluorescent
dye that generates red fluorescence upon formation of aggregates in active mitochondria. The level
of red fluorescence is often used as an indicator of mitochondrial membrane potential and, there-
fore, mitochondrial activity. Immunofluorescent staining revealed that mitochondria in glucose-
reduced hESC-CMs are more elongated (Figure 3A), and flow cytometry analysis revealed that the
level of JC-1 aggregation is significantly higher in glucose-reduced hESC-CMs cultured in both

 regular 0.9 mM and 10 mM pyruvate conditions. (Figure 3B). These data suggest that high glucose
inhibits the functional maturation of mitochondria.
Second, intracellular lactate levels of hESC-CMs were measured using Laconic, a fluorescence res-
onance energy transfer (FRET)-based lactate nanosensor (San Martı
´n et al., 2013). After glucose
deprivation, the Laconic construct was introduced into hESC-CMs via adenovirus as described
previously (John et al., 2008). In hESC-CMs differentiated in standard 25 mM glucose, bath-applied
lactate (4 mM) caused a rapid increase in intracellular lactate (measured as a decrease FRET ratio),
demonstrating the efficacy of the probe. Subsequent addition of pyruvate evoked a similar but
smaller elevation of intracellular lactate. Under these conditions, inhibition of mitochondrial respira-
tion with sodium cyanide (NaCN) had only a minor effect on the intracellular lactate level. This result
suggests that hESC-CMs that are differentiated in standard 25 mM glucose do not actively metabo-
lize pyruvate (Figure 3C, upper panel). By contrast, addition of 4 mM pyruvate to glucose-reduced
hESC-CMs did not cause intracellular lactate accumulation, and addition of NaCN in the presence of
pyruvate resulted in a substantial increase in lactate level. This result is consistent with pyruvate utili-
zation by mitochondria (Figure 3C, lower panel). Together, these data suggest that mitochondria
metabolize pyruvate in hESC-CMs that are cultured in glucose-reduced conditions, but not in the
presence of glucose.
Third, we assessed cellular respiration of hESC-CM using the XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer
(Seahorse Bioscience), in which oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured in real time in a basal
state and in response to oligomycin (an ATP synthase inhibitor), FCCP (carbonilcyanide p-
triflouromethoxyphenylhydrazone, a mitochondrial uncoupler), and rotenone or myxothiazol (com-
plex I or III inhibitors, respectively) (Figure 3D). Although base-line mitochondrial respiration was not
changed (Figure 3E), ATP-linked respiration was elevated in the no glucose condition (Figure 3F
and G). Glucose-reduced hESC-CMs also demonstrated substantially larger maximum respiration
capacity, as indicated by the response to FCCP (Figure 3H). These results corroborate the increased
capacity of cellular respiration in hESC-CMs cultured under low glucose conditions.
Fourth, the Ca2+ kinetics of hESC-CMs were assessed using a Ca2+ transient assay (Shimizu et al.,
2015). Although the peak amplitude of the transient (DF/F0) did not show a significant difference,
the maximum upstroke (Vmax) was significantly faster and the time to 50% decay was significantly
shorter in the glucose-reduced group (Figure 3I). This pattern is consistent with the previous report
demonstrating
the
role
of
thyroid
hormone
on hiPSC-CM maturation (Yang et al., 2014),
and suggestive of an inhibitory role of high glu-
cose on hESC-CM maturation.
Fifth, taking advantage of our monolayer cul-
ture system, we examined electrophysiological
properties, using a multi-electrode array (MEA)
culture plate as reported previously (Zhu et al.,
2017). Maximum upstroke velocity (dV/dtmax) of
field
potential
is
a
reliable
parameter
for
approximating the electrophysiological maturity
of
cardiomyocytes
derived
from
pluripotent
stem cells (Haase et al., 2009; Ma et al., 2011;

cultured

25
mM
glucose,
those
hESC-
CMs cultured in the absence of glucose dis-
played a significant increase in dV/dtmax (Fig-
ure 3—figure supplement 1A–C).

 (Huebsch et al., 2015). Both average maximum
contraction speed and average maximum relaxa-
tion speed were higher in those hESC-CMs cul-
tured in 0 mM glucose (Figure 3J). Together,
these data suggest that glucose reduction pro-
motes the functional maturation of hESC-CMs at
the metabolic,
electrophysiological, and bio-
mechanical levels.
Glucose blocks cardiac maturation
through the pentose phosphate
pathway
Having determined that glucose reduction indu-
ces cardiac maturation at morphological, genetic
metabolic, and functional levels, we next sought
to analyze the mechanism by which glucose
blocks cardiac maturation. Glucose is metabo-
lized by multiple pathways involving both cata-
bolic
reactions
(anaerobic
glycolysis
and
the aerobic TCA cycle) and anabolic reactions
(PPP, the hexosamine pathway, etc.). We first
examined the impact of glucose reduction on the global metabolomics signature. Mass spectrome-
try revealed that glucose deprivation resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of the metabo-
lites in purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, the PPP, the hexosamine pathway, and glycolysis,
whereas lipid precursors, amino acids, glutamine, and glutamate, as well as urea cycle metabolites,
were not significantly affected (Figure 4A and Figure 4—figure supplement 1). ATP levels were not
significantly different under glucose-restricted conditions (Figure 4B), neither were any specific
stress pathways significantly increased when examined by RNA-seq, suggesting that the cells were
not energy-starved in the absence of glucose in the cell culture media.
To identify the metabolic pathway responsible for the improved cardiac maturation by glucose
reduction, we conducted a systematic screening using chemical inhibitors for the various glucose
metabolic pathways in the monolayer 384-well format (Figure 4C). Consistent with flow cytometry
for MitoTracker and MF20 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C), 2-DG dose-dependently abolished
the glucose-dependent inhibition of TNNT2 and NKX2-5 mRNA levels in hESC-CM (Figure 4D and
Figure 4—figure supplement 4A). 3PO (3-[3-pyridinyl]-1-[4-pyridinyl]-2-propen-1-one), an inhibitor
of the phosphofructokinase PFKFB3 (which is a regulator of PFK1), did not affect the level of hESC-
CM maturity at any concentration of glucose (Figure 4E and Figure 4—figure supplement 4B). The
failure of 3PO to recapitulate the effect of glucose deprivation suggests that glucose metabolites
downstream of PFK1 are not essential for the glucose-dependent inhibition of cardiac maturation.
Consistently, sodium oxamate (a lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] inhibitor) did not block the inhibitory
effect of glucose (Figure 4F and Figure 4—figure supplement 4C). Interestingly, however, 6AN (6-
[cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ylideneamino] naphthalene-2-sulfonate) and DHEA (didehydroepiandroster-
one), both inhibitors of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in the oxidative arm of the
PPP, recapitulated glucose reduction (Figure 4G and H, Figure 4—figure supplement 4D–E). As
summarized in Figure 4—figure supplement 3, our chemical inhibitor screening suggests that the
PPP plays a critical role in the inhibition of cardiac maturation and that blocking this pathway by
either use of chemical inhibitors or glucose deprivation induces cardiac maturation. Although mito-
chondria are a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and physiological levels of ROS pro-
mote cellular differentiation (Crespo et al., 2010), the level of ROS measured by DCFDA
(dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate) did not increase in the absence of glucose and neither did
ROS inhibition had a significant impact on TNNT2 expression level (Figure 4—figure supplement
3F), suggesting that the increase in ROS is not responsible for the induction of cardiac maturation.

 Nucleotide metabolism regulates cardiomyocyte maturation
The oxidative arm of the PPP generates two major products: reducing power in the form of NADPH
and 5-carbon sugars that supply the backbone for nucleotide biosynthesis. To test whether glucose
level impacts cardiac maturation by affecting nucleotide biosynthesis, we rescued nucleotide synthe-
sis by adding uridine to hESC-CMs cultured in low glucose media. Under glucose starvation, supple-
mentation of uridine is known to rescue the growth of bacteria, yeast and malignant cells
(Linker et al., 1985). In our hESC-CM culture system, uridine restored cell proliferation even in low-
glucose conditions (Figure 5A and B). Interestingly, uridine dose-dependently reduced the level of
TNNT2 even in glucose-deprived conditions (Figure 5C and Figure 5—figure supplement 1A), sug-
gesting that glucose-mediated inhibition of cardiac maturation is dependent on the supply of
nucleotides and not of NADPH.
In order to test whether nucleotides are necessary for the glucose-dependent inhibition of cardiac
maturation, nucleotide biosynthesis was blocked by multiple methods. Addition of an excess amount
of thymidine (unlike uridine) blocks the synthesis of DNA by inhibiting the formation of deoxycytidine
(i.e., the thymidine block method), which is commonly used to synchronize the cell cycle
(Reichard et al., 1960; Xeros, 1962). When excess thymidine was added to hESC-CMs, the expres-
sion of TNNT2 and NKX2-5 were increased (Figure 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 1B). To
further confirm this effect, we blocked deoxynucleotide synthesis by hydroxyurea (HU), an inhibitor
of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) that catalyzes the formation of deoxyribo-nucleotides. Consistent
with the results from thymidine block, HU dose-dependently induced the expression of TNNT2 and
NKX2-5 (Figure 5E and Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). RNAi-based knockdown of RRM2B, a
key subunit of RNR, also resulted in a significant increase in TNNT2 expression level, even in the
presence of 25 mM glucose (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Together, these gain- and loss-of-
function data suggest that nucleotide biosynthesis is a key regulatory pathway of the pro-mitotic–
anti-maturation effect of glucose.
Nucleotide deprivation, not cell cycle block, induces cardiomyocyte
maturation
Nucleotide synthesis is a key step in DNA replication and thus cell cycling. Therefore, it is not clear
whether the maturation of hESC-CMs that results from deprivation of glucose is due to the cell-cycle
block in general or to the effects of nucleotides themselves. To examine whether cell-cycle arrest in
general is an essential trigger for cardiac maturation, we blocked the mitotic activity of hESC-CMs
by a CDK4/6 inhibitor and paclitaxel (Taxol; an inhibitor of microtubule breakdown), both
of which block the cell cycle without directly inhibiting the nucleotide kinetics. Interestingly, neither
CDK4/6 inhibitor nor paclitaxel induced cardiac maturation (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–B).
Together, these data suggest that cell-cycle arrest by itself is not crucial for the promotion of cardiac
maturation. Rather, nucleotide deprivation is a key mechanism for cardiac maturation.

 Glucose uptake is progressively suppressed during physiological
cardiogenesis in utero
These
in
vitro
data
suggest
that
glucose
reduction
promotes
cardiac
maturation
while
inhibiting cardiomyocyte proliferation. An intriguing possibility is that the same mechanism underlies
cardiac maturation in the in vivo natural counterpart. During normal embryogenesis, however, the
blood glucose level is primarily regulated by maternal metabolism and stays relatively stable in
utero, leading us to hypothesize that cellular glucose uptake becomes restricted during late fetal
stages. To test this possibility, we measured the glucose uptake in the fetal hearts using 18F-labeled
2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucose (FDG). 18F-labeled FDG was injected intravenously via the maternal tail vein
at E10.5, E12.5, and E15.5 or intraperitoneally into P1 and P7 pups. After 2 hr, the mice were
imaged by PET/CT, the hearts were dissected, and cardiac accumulation was measured quantita-
tively. Interestingly, the normalized cardiac accumulation progressively and rapidly decreased from
E10.5 to P7, with 0.11% and 0.05% 18F-FDG uptake in P1 and P7 hearts, respectively, compared to
E10.5 hearts (Figure 6). These data suggest that cardiac glucose uptake becomes significantly
restricted during late gestational and early postnatal stages, creating an intracellular glucose depri-
vation condition during natural in vivo development.
Hyperglycemia promotes the proliferation and inhibits the maturation
of cardiomyocytes in utero
We next tested whether hyperglycemia promotes the proliferation and inhibits the maturation of car-
diomyocytes in vivo using fetuses and neonates from diabetic pregnancy. Akita heterozygous mice
carry a single amino-acid substitution in the Ins2 gene and exhibit multiple disorders associated with
maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) (Barber et al., 2005; Fujita et al., 2001; Wang et al.,
1999; Yaguchi et al., 2003; Yoshioka et al., 1997). By crossing an Akita female with a wild-type
male, we created a diabetic pregnancy condition in which wild-type fetuses (half of the pups in the
litters) and their littermates are exposed to hyperglycemia (Figure 7A). In the C57BL/6 background,
the average blood-glucose levels of the Akita mothers that we used were significantly higher than
those of sex-matched control littermates (215 ± 84 vs 71 ± 12 mg/dl, respectively; p<0.0005). Fetal
and neonatal Tnnt2+ cardiomyocytes from wild-type hearts from wild-type mothers and wild-type
hearts from Akita mothers were examined for mitotic activity in an in vivo EdU incorporation assay at
E16.5 and P0 stages, when cardiomyocytes are not yet multinucleated or multiploidic. As shown in
Figure 7B and C, the number of cardiomyocytes in S phase was significantly higher at both E16.5
and P0 in the diabetes group. Histological analyses showed that the number of phosphorylated his-
tone H3-positive cardiomyocytes (pH3+/Tnnt2+) is higher at E16.5 in the embryos from diabetic
pregnancies (Figure 7D and E). These data suggest that fetal cardiomyocytes are more mitotic
when exposed to maternal hyperglycemia.
To examine whether hyperglycemia inhibits the maturation of fetal cardiomyocytes in vivo, we
analyzed the fetal and neonatal hearts from diabetic pregnancies. The level of Tnnt2 expression was
significantly lower in the hearts from the diabetic pregnancies (Figure 7F). A hallmark of the congen-
ital heart disease associated with diabetic pregnancy is asymmetric cardiac hypertrophy. Although
heart weight/body weight ratio did not show a difference in our mouse model, the thickness of left
and right ventricular free walls was significantly increased in the hearts from diabetic pregnancies at
P1 (Figure 7G). Consistently, the cardiomyocyte size measured by flow cytometry was significantly
smaller in the diabetic pregnancy group (Figure 7H). These data suggest that overproliferation and/
or delayed maturation underlie the pathological mechanism of cardiomyopathy associated with dia-
betic pregnancy.

 Discussion
In summary, we investigated the role of glucose
in cardiac formation, and discovered (1) that glu-
cose dose-dependently inhibits cardiac matura-
tion
in
hESC-CMs,
(2)
that
the
maturation-
inhibitory effect is dependent on nucleotide bio-
synthesis via the PPP, (3) that the developing
heart accomplishes intracellular glucose starva-
tion by limiting glucose uptake in late gestational
stages during normal embryogenesis, and (4) that
perturbation of the environmental glucose level
in diabetic pregnancy affects natural cardiomyo-
cyte maturation in vivo.
Cardiomyocytes switch their main energy sub-
strate from glucose (or other carbohydrates) to
fatty acids shortly after birth. This metabolic
switch has long been believed to be an adapta-
tion of cardiomyocytes to facilitate more efficient
production of ATP. However, our study has
revealed that a drastic suppression of glucose
uptake occurs during gestational stages, long
before the metabolic switch after birth (Figure 5).
Our in vitro hESC-CM glucose-deprivation experi-
ments mimic this in vivo glucose starvation.
The results suggest that glucose deprivation
induces cardiac maturation at genetic, morpho-
logical,
metabolic,
electrophysiological
and
biomechanical
levels
(Figures
2
and
3), suggesting that glucose is a negative regula-
tor of the maturation of fetal cardiomyocytes in
vitro and in vivo, as well as a positive regulator of
the mitotic activity of these cells. Perturbation of the natural glucose starvation results in higher
mitotic activity and lower maturity of cardiomyocytes in vivo (Figure 7). Together, our results sug-
gest that the metabolic switch during perinatal stages is necessary not only to meet the energy
demand but also to induce the genetic program that facilitates the maturation of the cardiomyocytes
in vivo. An important question that is yet to be answered is how the drastic suppression of intracellu-
lar glucose uptake is achieved in the fetal heart. As the fetal glucose environment is primarily deter-
mined by maternal metabolism and kept relatively constant in utero, one possibility is that the
glucose uptake is limited at the glucose transporter level in fetal cardiomyocytes. In fact, fetal heart
switches its glucose transporter isoform at around this stage. Understanding how glucose regulates
the genetic program and how the glucose uptake is regulated at the genetic level will be key to fur-
ther dissecting the cross-talk between the genetic and non-genetic factors governing heart
formation.
Nucleotide biosynthesis via the PPP as a key mechanism in balancing
proliferation and maturation
Glucose is the most fundamental and commonly available nutrient for the cells. Hence, the activity of
the glucose metabolic pathways is tightly regulated in cells. Glucose is broken down to extract
energy through the glycolysis pathway and also shunts to supply 5-carbon sugars and NADPH
through the PPP. In our study, chemical inhibition of glucose metabolic pathways in hESC-CMs
revealed that it is not the catabolic breakdown of glucose to extract energy but rather the anabolic
use of glucose to build nucleotides that is responsible for the glucose-dependent inhibition of car-
diac maturation. Most of the proliferating cells synthesize nucleotides de novo from glucose, gluta-
mine, and CO2. In our hESC-CM experiments, blocking the PPP and nucleotide biosynthesis
inhibited
the
glucose-mediated
induction
of
mitosis
and
suppression
of
maturation,

 supplementation of nucleotides was sufficient to recapitulate the effect of glucose (Figures 4 and
5). These data suggest that nucleotide biosynthesis via the PPP is the key regulator of the pro-
mitotic/anti-maturation
effect
of
glucose.
Interestingly,
cardiomyocyte
maturation
was
not
fully induced by blocking of the cell cycle with a CDK4/6 inhibitor or paclitaxel, neither of which
directly impact the nucleotide kinetics. Therefore, it is not the cell cycle in general but the
nucleotides themselves that blocks the maturation (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). It is well-docu-
mented that there is generally an inverse correlation between cell proliferation and differentiation
during developmental stages (Ruijtenberg and van den Heuvel, 2016). Our data raise an intriguing
possibility that nucleotide biosynthesis serves as a nodal point balancing cell proliferation and differ-
entiation during development.
Hyperglycemia as a potential teratogen in the fetal heart
Clinically, maternal diabetes can accompany multiple complications including neuropathy, microvas-
culopathy, nephropathy, and insulin resistance. Although meta-analysis predicts that hyperglycemia
itself is a major teratogen during diabetic pregnancy (Reece et al., 1996), it is often difficult to dis-
sect the impacts of maternal complications on CHD as they are often subclinical. To our knowledge,
our in vitro study is the first to demonstrate that environmental glucose itself, if excessive, directly
impacts cardiac differentiation. The formation of the heart is regulated by both genetic and non-
genetic factors, with the latter playing important roles particularly during late-stage cardiogenesis.
An interesting aspect of the interaction between genetic and non-genetic mechanisms is that they
seem to reinforce each other mutually. Our data suggest that the glucose metabolic environment is,
on the one hand, a consequence of changes in cardiac genetic program, and on the other hand, a
cause of the changes in cardiac gene expression.
Potential application to the translation
Understanding the metabolic signature of hESC-CMs will potentially open new methods for purifying
these cells (Tohyama et al., 2016;
Tohyama et al., 2013) or inducing
their maturation
(Drawnel et al., 2014). Considering that the inhibitors of the PPP and nucleotide biosynthesis have
entered clinical trials for cancer treatment (Tennant et al., 2010; Vander Heiden, 2011), our data
raise the possibility that manipulating this pathway may allow us to control the proliferation and mat-
uration of cardiomyocytes for regenerative medicine.
With the advances in fetal diagnosis and surgical techniques, the number of CHD patients who
survive childhood (and so have adult CHD) is growing rapidly by nearly 5% per year (Brickner et al.,
2000). Maternal hyperglycemia is a common medical condition associated with 2–5-fold increase in
CHD (Centers for Disease Control, 1990; Simeone et al., 2015; Yogev and Visser, 2009). Cur-
rently, 60 million women of reproductive age (18–44 years old) worldwide and approximately 3 mil-
lion in the U.S. have diabetes mellitus. This number is predicted to double by 2030, posing a huge
medical and economic burden (Gabbay-Benziv et al., 2015). Our findings will lay a foundation for
understanding how the glucose environment regulates cardiogenesis and how disturbance of non-
genetic factors affects the genetic program during the pathological development of the heart.
Materials and methods
Mouse and cell lines
Wild-type and Akita mice were maintained on the C57BL/6 background according to the Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institute of Health (NIH Publi-
cation No. 85–23, revised 1996). Housing and experiments were performed according to the Institu-
tional Approval for Appropriate Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by the UCLA Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol #2008-127-07). H9 (WA09) and UCLA4 (UCLA stem cell
core) hESC lines were maintained as described before (Arshi et al., 2013). Authentication of hESCs
was achieved by confirming the expression of pluripotency genes and protein markers. hESCs were
routinely verified as mycoplasma-free using a PCR-based assay. hESCs were grown and differenti-
ated in a chemically defined condition (Minami et al., 2012; Young et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2017).

RNA-seq and data analyses
For the RNA-seq analyses shown in Figures 1D, E and 2C, RNA was extracted from hESC, hMP,
hCP, hCM14, hCM28, hCM28 (in 25 mM glucose) and hCM28 (in 0 mM glucose) using TRIZOL
(TheroFisher) and RNeasy kit (QIAGEN). 500 ng of DNaseI-treated RNA was used as input material
for library preparation using the Illumina TruSeq mRNA kit (Illumina, RS-122–2001), according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Final libraries were sequenced as single-end 50 bp on the Illumina
HiSeq2000 platform (GSE84814). Libraries for RNA-Seq shown in Figures 1D, E and 2C were pre-
pared with the KAPA Stranded RNA-Seq Kit. The workflow consists of mRNA enrichment, cDNA
generation, end repair, A-tailing, adaptor ligation, strand selection and PCR amplification. Different
adaptors were used for multiplexing samples in one lane. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina
HiSeq 3000 for a paired end 2 � 150 run (GSE84815). A data quality check was done on an Illumina
SAV. De-multiplexing was performed with the Illumina Bcl2fastq2 v 2.17 program. Short read
sequences generated from an Illumina Sequencer were aligned to the UCSC human reference
genome hg19 downloaded from support.Illumina.com (http://support.illumina.com/sequencing/
sequencing_software/igenome.html) using TopHat from the Tuxedo Tools. The average overall read
mapping rate reached over 82 percent (average = 82.43 percent). The output was in the form of
BAM (Binary Sequence Alignment/Map format) files. These outputs contain information for assigning
location and quantifying the short-read alignments obtained from the RNA-seq samples. This is nec-
essary for downstream analyses such as annotation, transcript abundance comparison and polymor-
phism detection. Counts or gene expression matrices were generated using HTSeq, which
quantified the reads per transcript. The expression matrices were log transformed and normalized
using the rlog function in the Deseq2 package. The normalized gene expression matrices were used
as input for SaVanT (Signature Visualization Tools), which allowed for the visualization of molecular
signatures directly related to heart development as seen in Figures 1D, E and 2C.
Flow cytometry
hESC-CMs and mouse embryonic hearts were washed three times with PBS and incubated at 37˚C in
a dissociation enzyme solution with occasional pipetting to a single-cell suspension. The enzyme
solution contained 1% penicillin/streptomycin (ThermoFisher, 15140–122), 10% fetal bovine serum
(Hyclone), collagenase 2 mg/ml (Worthington, CLS-2), dispase 0.25 mg/ml (Gibco, 17105–041),
and DNAase I (ThermoFisher) in PBS. The cells were analyzed with the following antibodies: MF20
(mouse, 1:100, Hybridoma Bank), Tnnt2 (rabbit, 1:250, Sigma-Aldrich), MitoTracker Orange
CMTMRos (ThermoFisher), JC-1 (Abcam), and EdU (100 ml of 10 mM EdU solution per 10 g of
mouse, ThermoFisher). For MF20 and Tnnt2, FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody
(BD Biosciences) was used. Stained cells were analyzed by a flow cytometer (LSRII, BD Biosciences).
Data analysis was performed using FACSDiva (BD Biosciences).
Immunocytochemistry and morphological analysis
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked for an hour with 5% normal goat serum, and
incubated with mouse alpha actinin antibody (Sigma) followed by Alexa fluor 488-conjugated sec-
ondary antibody (ThermoFisher). Images were taken with Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscopy. Sarco-
mere lengths were analyzed using Zeiss Zen software.
mtDNA-to-nDNA ratio analysis
Total DNA including mtDNA was extracted from cells using the PureLink DNA kit (ThermoFisher),
and DNA purity and quantity were determined using a spectrophotometer. To determine the ratio
between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, qRT-PCR was performed on a Roche Lightcycler 480 using
SYBR Green dye. Mitochondrial gene expression was corrected for nuclear gene expression values,
and normalized to the value of the control group for each experiment as described before. Forward
and reverse primer sequences are as follows: UUR forward, CAC CCA AGA ACA GGG TTT GT; UUR
reverse, TGG CCA TGG GTA TGT TGT TA for mt DNA; B2-microglobulin forward, TGC TGT CTC
CAT GTT TGA TGT ATC T; and B2-microglobulin reverse, TCT CTG CTC CCC ACC TCT AAG T.

 Ca2+ transient assay
Ca2+ transient was measured as described (Shimizu et al., 2015). Briefly, hESC-CMs cultured in the
presence or absence of glucose were loaded with 5 mM fluo-4 AM and imaged in Tyrode buffer con-
taining 138.2 mM NaCl, 4.6 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl, 15 mM glucose and 20 mM HEPES according to
the manufacturer’s instruction. Images were recorded on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope. Data
analysis was carried out using the Zeiss Zen and ImageJ.
In vitro contractility assay
Contractility assessments were performed by utilizing a video-based technique with the UCSF Glad-
stone-developed Matlab program MotionGUI (Huebsch et al., 2015). The videos were converted
from .mts to .avi format at native resolution using commercially available software and loaded into
the MotionGUI program. The conversion between pixels and real distance was performed within the
MotionGUI program using a reference image with unit divisions of 100 um, taken under the same
objective and video zoom settings as the cell videos, to yield a pixel size of 0.681125. This pixel size
was used for all contractility assessments. Motion vectors were calculated and the data were evalu-
ated upon completion. All samples were subjected to the same post-processing procedures in order
to ensure consistency during comparative analysis. Each video sample was post-processed using
neighbor-based cleaning with the vector-based cleaning criterion within the program. The threshold
for this post-processing method was set to two for all samples and was adequate for improving the
signal-to-noise ratio enough to identify peaks clearly corresponding to beating events in most sam-
ples. A small number of videos suffering from significant noise issues were separately subjected to
fast Fourier transform (FFT) frequency domain cleaning with a cut-off frequency of 1 Hz. Only one
post-processing method was applied to one video at one time. All other parameters of the Motion-
GUI program not outlined here were set to their respective default values.
Measurement of intracellular lactate level by Laconic
The lactate biosensor Laconic was a gift from Dr. Barros (San Martı
´n et al., 2013). Overexpression
of Laconic in hESC-CM was achieved using engineered adenoviruses encoding the construct. Expres-
sion of the construct was sufficiently high after 36–48 hr for FRET experiments or microscopy imag-
ing. All cells were imaged live without fixation. Images (16 bit) were acquired using a microscope
(Eclipse TE300; Nikon) fitted with a 60� (1.4 NA) oil immersion lens (Nikon) and equipped with a fil-
ter cube comprising a CFP bandpass excitation filter, 436/20b, together with a longpass dichroic
mirror (455DCLP; Chroma Technology Corp). Two LEDs (Philips Lumileds), one emitting at 455 ± 20
nm (royal blue) and the other emitting at 505 ± 15 nm (cyan) were used as light sources. Ratiometric
FRET measurements were obtained from the YFP and CFP images acquired simultaneously using a
Dual View image splitter (Optical Insights) equipped with a 505 nm longpass dichroic filter to sepa-
rate the CFP and YFP signals, a CFP emission filter (480/30), and a YFP emission filter (535/40)
(John et al., 2008). Images were captured with a Cascade 512B digital camera (Photometrics).
Reagents indicated in Figure 3C were added and followed by washing.
XF24 extracellular flux analyzer
hESC-CMs were seeded onto a matrigel-coated XF24 Cell Culture Microplate (Seahorse Bioscience)
at 2–7.5 104 cells/well with or without glucose (25 mM glucose of cardiac differentiation media).
Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured using an XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyser (Seahorse
Bioscience) in unbuffered DMEM assay medium supplemented with 1 mM pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine
and with or without 25 mM glucose. OCR was measured before and after the sequential addition of
0.75 mM oligomycin, 0.5 mM FCCP and 0.75 mM of rotenone/myxothiazol. OCR was normalized to
protein concentration using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Mitochondrial respiration was calculated as
the difference between total and rotenone/myxothiazol rates. Maximal respiration was the response
to FCCP. ATP-linked respiration was represented by the oligomycin-sensitive respiration rate,
whereas uncoupled respiration was represented by the difference between oligomycin and rote-
none/myxothiazol rates.

 Multi-electrode array
hESC-CMs at the stage of hCM14 were plated on microelectrode arrays (MEAs) containing 120 inte-
grated TiN electrodes (30 mm diameter, 200 mm interelectrode spacing). The MEAs were placed in
an incubator with a temperature of 37˚C and 5% CO2. Two days were given to allow the cardiomyo-
cytes to well attach the MEAs before recording started. Local field potentials at each electrode were
collected over a period of 5 min every day in total with a sampling rate of 1 KHz using the
MEA2100-HS120 system (Multichannel systems, Reutlingen, Germany). Data analysis was carried out
using the MC_DataTool (Multichannel Systems), Origin (OriginLab Corporation) and Matlab (Math-
Works). Data shown are based on three independent hESC-CM preparations.
Mass spectrometry-based metabolic measurements
The experiments were performed as described (Krall et al., 2016). Briefly, cells were seeded in 6-
well plates, so that the final cell count at the time of metabolite extraction was about 7*105 and this
was even across all cell lines. To extract intracellular metabolites, cells were briefly rinsed with cold
150 mM ammonium acetate (pH 7.3), followed by the addition of 1 ml cold 80% MeOH on dry ice.
Cell scrapers were used to detach cells, and the cell suspension was transferred into Eppendorf
tubes. Extracted metabolites were transferred into glass vials and dried down under vacuum. For
the LC-MS-based analysis, the samples were resuspended in 70% acetonitrile and 50 ml were
injected onto a Luna NH2 column (150 mm x 2 mm, Phenomenex). Separation was achieved using A)
5 mM NH4AcO (pH 9.9) and B) ACN. The gradient started with 15% A) going to 90% A) over 18
min, followed by an isocratic step for 9 min and reversal to the initial 15% A) for 7 min. Metabolites
were quantified with TraceFinder 3.3 using accurate mass measurements (�3 ppm) and retention
times of pure standards. Data analysis was performed using the statistical language R.
Gene expression analysis by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR
RNA was extracted from the tissue or the cells cultured with a specific concentration of glucose
together with or without titrated metabolic pathway inhibitors using the Direct-zol RNA mini prep
kit (Zymo research). RNA was reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA using the qScript cDNA
synthesis kit (Quanta Biosciences). Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR was performed using Viia7
(Applied Biosystems/ThermoFisher). In Figures 1B, 2B and 4C–E, Figure 4—figure supplement
3A–E, Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C, and Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–B, each bar rep-
resents the average of biological duplicates with at least three independent wells, each of which is
triplicated for qPCR reaction. The relative mRNA level is normalized to the expression level of 25
mM glucose without any chemicals. Forward and reverse primer sequences are as follows: GAPDH

18F-FDG measurement by g-counter
18F-FDG was obtained from the UCLA Department of Nuclear Medicine. Warmed pregnant mice or
pups were injected intravenously or intraperitoneally, respectively, with ~90 microCi (~3.33 MBq) of
18F-FDG. After 2 hr, the mice were sacrificed. Preliminary experiments suggested that 2 hr was suffi-
ciently long for 18F-FDG to reach maximum accumulation in each organ and embryo. Fetal or neona-
tal hearts were separated from the other tissue (carcass), and the mass and radioactivity in both the
hearts and the carcasses were measured using a standard balance and a Wizard 3’ automatic gamma
counter (Perkin Elmer), respectively. The radioactivity levels in the pup carcasses were higher than
the detection limit of the gamma counter, so the expected gamma counter values for the pup car-
casses were calculated on the basis of the decay-corrected injected dose of 18F-FDG and known
conversion values between microCi and CPM on the gamma counter. To calculate the ‘Normalized
FDG accumulation’, radioactive accumulation in each heart was divided by heart weight and then
further divided by the total radioactivity in each embryo or pup. This last normalization is to account
for differences in 18F-FDG injected dose and accessibility to the embryos and pups. Averages and

 standard errors of the mean (SEM) were calculated, and the values were normalized such that E10.5
embryo FDG accumulation was set to 100.
Immunostaining
Mouse embryos were isolated in cold PBS and fixed in 4% PFA for 1~2 hr, followed by equilibration
in 30% sucrose in PBS solution overnight. The tissues were placed in 1:1 30% sucrose/OCT (Tissue-
Tek, Electron Microscopy Sciences) solution for 1–2 hr, then in 100% OCT compound for 1 hr at 4˚C,
and embedded in 100% OCT compound, carefully oriented in Cryomolds (Ted Pella). The blocks
were immediately frozen on dry ice with isopropanol and stored at �80˚C. The sections were cut 5
mm with a Leica CM3050 S cryostat. The following primary and secondary antibodies were used: a-
actinin (mouse, 1:200, Sigma-Aldrich), Phospho-Histone 3 (rabbit, 1:250, Millipore), as well as Alexa
Fluor 488 (green)- and Alexa Fluor 594 (red)-conjugated secondary antibodies specific to the appro-
priate species, which were used (1:500; ThermoFisher) for fluorescent staining. Sections were
mounted with antifade mounting medium with DAPI (ThermoFisher), and analyzed by using AxioIm-
ager D1 (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc).
Statistical analysis
ANOVA and Student’s t-test were used to determine whether any statistically significant difference
exists among independent groups.
