IMPORTANCE The etiologic factors of late-life depression are still poorly understood. Recent
evidence suggests that microvascular dysfunction is associated with depression, which may
have implications for prevention and treatment. However, this association has not been
systematically reviewed.
OBJECTIVE To examine the associations of peripheral and cerebral microvascular dysfunction
with late-life depression.
DATA SOURCES A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE for
and longitudinal studies published since inception to October 16, 2016, that assessed the
associations between microvascular dysfunction and depression.
STUDY SELECTION Three independent researchers performed the study selection based on
consensus. Inclusion criteria were a study population 40 years of age or older, a validated
method of detecting depression, and validated measures of microvascular function.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS This systematic review and meta-analysis has been
registered at PROSPERO (CRD42016049158) and is reported in accordance with the PRISMA
and MOOSE guidelines. Data extraction was performed by an independent researcher.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The following 5 estimates of microvascular dysfunction
were considered in participants with or without depression: plasma markers of endothelial
function, albuminuria, measurements of skin and muscle microcirculation, retinal arteriolar
and venular diameter, and markers for cerebral small vessel disease. Data are reported as
pooled odds ratios (ORs) by use of the generic inverse variance method with the use of
random-effects models.
RESULTS A total of 712 studies were identified; 48 were included in the meta-analysis, of
which 8 described longitudinal data. Data from 43 600 participants, 9203 individuals with
depression, and 72 441 person-years (mean follow-up, 3.7 years) were available. Higher levels
of plasma endothelial biomarkers (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule–1: OR, 1.58;
95% CI, 1.28-1.96), white matter hyperintensities (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.19-1.39), cerebral
microbleeds (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.03-1.34), and cerebral (micro)infarctions (OR, 1.30; 95% CI,
1.21-1.39) were associated with depression. Among the studies available, no significant
associations of albuminuria and retinal vessel diameters with depression were reported.
Longitudinal data showed a significant association of white matter hyperintensities with
incident depression (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.09-1.30).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This meta-analysis shows that both the peripheral and
cerebral forms of microvascular dysfunction are associated with higher odds of (incident)
late-life depression. This finding may have clinical implications because microvascular
dysfunction might provide a potential target for the prevention and treatment of depression.

ate-life depression is a highly prevalent and heteroge-
neous disease with high rates of morbidity and
mortality.1,2 It is characterized by recurrent episodes: up
to 50% of those who recover from a first episode of depres-
sion will experience additional episodes throughout their
lifetime.3-6 Evidence suggests a cerebrovascular etiologic
cause7 because late-life depression has been associated with
vascular dementia, stroke, and white matter hyperintensities
(WMHs).8Moreover,avascularetiologiccausemayexplainthe
high recurrence rate of depression, in addition to the high rate
of resistance to antidepressants and/or cognitive behavioral
therapy; approximately one-third of patients with depres-
sion have treatment-resistant depression.6,9,10
Several studies have provided evidence that cerebral small
vessel disease may play a role in the etiologic factors of late-
life depression.7,11-18 A meta-analysis from 2014, including
19 studies and 6274 participants, showed significant cross-
sectional and longitudinal associations between white mat-
ter lesions, a proxy of cerebral small vessel disease, and (inci-
dent)depression.19However,multiplestudieswithcontinuous
measures of WMHs were not included in this meta-analysis,
and 2 large longitudinal studies became available only
recently.13,20 Furthermore, the growing evidence on alterna-
tivemarkersofmicrovasculardysfunction(forinstance,onbio-
markers of endothelial dysfunction) was not taken into ac-
count in previous meta-analyses.21-23
In view of these considerations, we hypothesize that mi-
crovascular dysfunction, both peripheral and cerebral, may be
associated with depression. We conducted a systematic re-
view and meta-analysis to investigate this hypothesis, both in
cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.
Methods
Search Strategy
We used MEDLINE and EMBASE to conduct a systematic lit-
erature search for cross-sectional and longitudinal epidemio-
logic studies of humans, determining the association be-
tween markers of microvascular dysfunction and depressive
symptoms and/or depressive disorder, published from incep-
tion to October 16, 2016. This study has been registered
at PROSPERO (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/
[CRD42016049158]) and is reported in accordance with the
PRISMA24andMOOSEguidelines.Weconsideredthefollowing
5 estimates of microvascular dysfunction: plasma markers of
endothelial function, albuminuria, measurements of skin and
muscle microcirculation, retinal arteriolar and venular
diameter, and markers for cerebral small vessel disease. The
exact search strategy and rationale are in the eAppendix in the
Supplement.
Selection Criteria and Data Extraction
Three independent researchers performed the study selec-
tion (M.J.M.v.A., A.J.H.M.H., and M.T.S.). Population-based or
case-control studies that reported on microvascular dysfunc-
tion in participants with or without depression were in-
cluded. Figure 1 shows the selection procedure. Of the 67 stud-
ies included in the review, we extracted the following: baseline
characteristics of the study population, study design, num-
ber of participants with or without depression, definition of
microvasculardysfunctionanddepression(self-reportedques-
tionnaire vs diagnostic psychiatric interview), fully adjusted
results including 95% CIs, SD, or range, and confounders in-
cludedintheanalyses.Whenthesedataweremissing,theprin-
cipal investigators were contacted for further information. If
the principal investigator could not provide the missing data,
the study was excluded. The quality of studies was assessed
by use of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for case-control
andcohortstudies(eTable1intheSupplement).Thisscaleuses
a 10-point grading system with a maximum score of 9 points
for longitudinal studies, 6 points for cross-sectional cohort
studies, and 8 points for case-control studies and assesses se-
lection of study groups, comparability of groups, and ascer-
tainment of exposure and outcome.25 We calculated the per-
centage of the maximum NOS score for all studies (eTable 1 in
the Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
We performed the meta-analysis with Review Manager, ver-
sion 5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Col-
laboration), by use of the generic inverse variance method
with random-effects models. In studies that reported micro-
vascular function as mean (SD) values for participants with
depression compared with controls without depression, we
calculated odds ratios (ORs) based on the standardized mean
difference method in concordance with the Cochrane Hand-
book for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.26 If only a range
of scores was reported, we estimated the SD using the for-
mula (upper limit − lower limit)/4. We used forest plots to
display the pooled ORs and 95% CIs, assessed heterogeneity
using I2 statistics (values of 50%-75% indicated moderate
heterogeneity, and values of >75% indicated considerable
heterogeneity),26-28 and determined the risk of publication
bias by visual inspection of funnel plots, the Egger test, and
the trim-and-fill method.26,29,30 We performed subgroup
and meta-regression analysis with R31 to explore heteroge-
neity, and we evaluated the methods to assess depression
Key Points
Question Are both the peripheral and cerebral forms of
microvascular dysfunction associated with late-life depression,
as suggested by the vascular depression hypothesis?
Findings This systematic review and meta-analysis of 48 studies
comprising 43 600 participants, including 9203 individuals with
depression, shows that the cerebral and peripheral forms of
microvascular dysfunction were associated with increased odds
for (incident) late-life depression, independent of cardiovascular
risk factors.
Meaning These findings support the hypothesis that
microvascular dysfunction is causally linked to late-life depression.
This finding may have clinical implications because microvascular
dysfunction might provide a target for the prevention and
treatment of depression.

 (diagnostic interviews vs self-reported questionnaires),
study design (case-control vs cohort study), methods to
assess WMHs (semiautomatic volumetry vs subjective rating
scale), and study quality as assessed by the NOS score (≥60%
vs <60%).
Results
Study Selection and Characteristics
We identified 712 studies, of which 90 full-text articles were
assessed for eligibility. Of these, we selected 67 studies that
investigated whether microvascular dysfunction was associ-
atedwithdepressivedisorderordepressivesymptoms.Ofthese
studies, 59 had a cross-sectional design (35 case-control stud-
ies and 24 cohort studies), and 8 had a longitudinal design
(8 cohort studies). In total, data from 43 600 participants,
including 9203 individuals (21.1%) with depression, were in-
cluded in the meta-analysis. The mean age of participants was
66 years, and 23 544 were female (54.0%). In total, 72 441 per-
son-years were included in longitudinal analyses (mean [SD]
follow-up, 3.7 [0.7] years). We found no studies that investi-
gated the association between skin and muscle microcircula-
tion and depressive disorder or depressive symptoms.
All studies included in the review used a dichotomous
outcome measure for depression, either by use of a diagnos-
tic interview to assess major depressive disorder or by use of
a cutoff for clinically relevant depressive symptoms, includ-
ing the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview or the
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM for depressive disor-
der and the Centers for Epidemiological Studies Depression
Scale, the Geriatric Depression Scale, the Hamilton Depres-
sion Rating Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the
Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale for clinically
relevant depressive symptoms. Plasma samples of biomark-
ers (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [sICAM-1],
soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [sVCAM-1],
e-selectin, and von Willebrand factor [vWF]) for endothelial
function were all analyzed by the use of an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay. Albuminuria was measured by use of
the albumin to creatinine ratio or 24-hour urinary albumin
excretion. Retinal vessel calibers were measured by the use
of stereoscopic color fundus photography. Cerebral small
vessel disease was determined by magnetic resonance
imaging–defined automated segmentation of WMH volume
(33 studies), rating scales for WMH severity (22 studies),
microbleeds (4 studies), and/or lacunar or silent infarctions
(4 studies). Characteristics of all selected studies are
presented in eTable 2 in the Supplement and the outcomes
of the selected studies in eTable 3 in the Supplement.
Association of Endothelial Function With Depression
Eight studies investigated the cross-sectional associations be-
tween plasma markers of endothelial function and depres-
sive symptoms (n = 6) or depressive disorder (n = 4).21,32-38
Most studies observed that higher levels of endothelial plasma
markers, which indicate dysfunction, were associated with
depression.32,33,35-38 One study described lower sVCAM-1
levels,34 and another study lower e-selectin levels,21 in par-
ticipants with depression compared with controls without
depression.
Seven studies21,32-35,37,38 were included in the meta-
analysis on plasma markers of endothelial function (1 study
provided insufficient data36). We found a significant associa-
tion between higher levels of plasma markers of endothelial
function and depression (Figure 2; pooled OR per SD increase

(t = 1.569; P = .12).
Association of Albuminuria With Depression
Two studies investigated the association between albumin-
uria and depression.22,23 Albuminuria was not significantly as-
sociated with depression in patients with (OR, 1.29; 95% CI,
0.96-1.73) or without (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.70-1.63) prior car-
diovascular disease.22 A second study23 found no significant
association between urinary protein (milligrams per gram) and
depressive symptoms in participants with chronic kidney dis-
ease (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.90-1.26).
Association of Retinal Microvascular Diameters
With Depression
Two studies investigated the association between retinal ar-
teriolar and venular diameters and depression.39,40 In a sub-
population of participants with diabetes, significant differ-
ences were found between controls (mean [SD] arteriolar
diameter, 133.1 [5.5] μm; mean [SD] venular diameter, 214.2
[7.5] μm), patients with diabetes (mean [SD] arteriolar diam-
eter, 135.7 [5.6] μm; mean [SD] venular diameter, 208.7
[7.6] μm), and patients with depression and diabetes (mean
[SD]arteriolardiameter,140.3[5.8];P < .01fortrend;mean[SD]

Cross-Sectional Association of Cerebral Small Vessel Disease
With Depression
Fifty-fivestudiesinvestigatedtheassociationbetweencerebral
small vessel disease and depression,11,13,14,17,20,41-91 of which 8
studies had a prospective design.13,20,70,84,85,88-90 Most studies
focused on WMH volumes or WMH severity scores in a case-
controlorapopulation-basedcohortsetting.Inadditiontostudy-
ing WMHs, 4 studies also evaluated the association of micro-
bleeds and microinfarctions with depression.13,51,82,91 Overall,
cerebral small vessel disease was associated with depression.
Thirty-eight studies11,13,17,44-47,49,51-58,60-64,66,73,75-88,91
were included in the meta-analysis on cross-sectional data
(Figure 3; eFigure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement). A sig-
nificant association between WMHs and depression was
found (pooled OR per SD, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.19-1.39; P < .001;
I2 = 66%). A statistically significant association was found
between a higher number of microbleeds (pooled OR, 1.18;
95% CI, 1.03-1.34; P < .05; I2 = 0%) and brain (micro)
infarctions (pooled OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.21-1.39; P < .001;
I2 = 1%) and depression. To reduce possible residual
confounding by medical comorbidities, we restricted the
analysis to studies that corrected for diabetes status or
hypertension. The results remained statistically significant
when pooling the WMH studies that corrected for diabetes

by the inspection of the funnel plots (eFigure 1 in the Supple-

(eFigure 4 in the Supplement). Owing to the limited number of
studies, we could not perform subgroup analyses or valid esti-
mations on publication bias for data on microbleeds and
microinfarctions.
Longitudinal Association of Cerebral Small Vessel Disease
With Depression
Eight studies were included in the meta-analysis of longitu-
dinaldata(Figure4).13,20,70,84,85,88-90OnlydataonWMHscould
be pooled, because only 1 longitudinal study13 investigated the
association of microbleeds and brain infarctions with depres-
sion. As shown in Figure 4, a statistically significant associa-
tionbetweenWMHsandtheincidenceofdepressionwasfound
(pooled OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.08-1.28; P < .001; I2 = 27%) over a
mean follow-up of 3.7 years. We found no evidence of publi-
cation bias based on the funnel plots (eFigure 5 in the Supple-
ment) or the Egger test (t = 1.139; P = .30).
Discussion
This extensive meta-analysis on 43 600 participants, includ-
ing 9203 individuals with depression, shows that general-
ized microvascular dysfunction is associated with depres-
sion, both in cross-sectional and longitudinal settings,
independent of cardiovascular risk factors. Multiple markers
of microvascular dysfunction, including endothelial plasma
markersandmarkersofcerebralsmallvesseldisease,arecross-
sectionally associated with a higher level of depressive symp-
toms and depressive disorder. In addition, WMHs are associ-
ated with incident depression over time. These findings are in
agreement with the vascular depression hypothesis and ex-
tend this hypothesis, as peripheral microvascular dysfunc-
tion may also be associated with depression.92,93
In this systematic review with meta-analysis, we evalu-
ated the associations between microvascular dysfunction and
depression. We included cross-sectional and longitudinal epi-
demiologic studies, and are the first, to our knowledge, to con-
sider the association of multiple measures of both cerebral and
peripheralmicrovasculardysfunctionwithdepression.Bycom-
bining the extensive evidence on WMHs with data from bio-
markers of endothelial function, we aim to provide further evi-
dence for the hypothesis that cerebral small vessel disease may
originate from endothelial dysfunction. We suggest that gen-
eralized microvascular dysfunction, as can be measured
throughout the body, is an important pathophysiologic fac-
tor that may contribute to the development of depression. Our

 results confirm and extend 2 previous meta-analyses that ad-
dressed the association between WMHs and depression19,94 by
including more than 6 times the number of participants and
depression cases, thus increasing statistical power. This num-
ber enabled us to overcome the major caveat of high hetero-
geneity, which was a major methodological issue in previous
meta-analyses. The use of diagnostic interviews vs question-
naires to assess depression, and case-control vs cohort study
design were found to be the sources of heterogeneity, which
has important implications for future studies that investigate
the pathophysiologic factors of depression. These variables,
however, did not affect the observed associations, which
strengthens the validity of our findings. Finally, our study fo-
cusedonlate-lifedepression,inwhichvascularpathologiccon-
ditions are thought to have the greatest effect, while previ-
ousmeta-analysescombinedearlyandlate-lifedepression.19,94
The association of microvascular dysfunction with de-
pression can be explained by several mechanisms. First, im-
paired endothelial function in the cerebral microcirculation
may lead to cerebral perfusion deficits, resulting in chronic is-
chemia in the cerebrum.95 Chronic ischemia could cause struc-
tural disruptions of the fiber tracts in the cerebral white mat-
ter, which are visualized as WMHs on results of magnetic
resonance imaging.95-98 If the affected regions are involved
in mood regulation, this may predispose the individual to
the development of depression. Second, microvascular dys-
function is closely linked to and interrelated with chronic
low-grade inflammation and/or oxidative stress, which
may represent different pathways in the development of
depression.35,99-102 Low-grade inflammation is known to con-
tribute to endothelial dysfunction.21,35 In addition, the cere-
bral endothelium may be more vulnerable to oxidative stress,
owing to a high production of reactive oxygen species in the
brain as a result of the high metabolic demand.103 Moreover,
the brain has limited antioxidant defenses,104 while damage
related to oxidative stress has been described in psychiatric
disease105-107andmaycontributetocerebraldysfunction.How-
ever, multiple studies have shown that the association be-
tweenmicrovasculardysfunctionanddepressionisonlypartly
dependent on inflammation21,35,36 or oxidative stress,21 which
suggests that microvascular dysfunction itself represents an
independentpathwayinthedevelopmentofdepression.Third,
cardiometabolic risk factors may be involved in the associa-
tion between microvascular dysfunction and depression. For
instance, increased arterial stiffening may induce microvas-
cular disease and is related to depression.108 Increased arte-
rial stiffness leads to an increased pulsatile pressure load,
which, owing to the low impedance of the cerebral microcir-
culation, can penetrate deeply into the white matter, thereby
inducing microvascular dysfunction and WMHs.108-110 In ad-
dition, other cardiometabolic risk factors, such as decreased
physical activity,111 smoking,112 obesity,113 hypertension,113-115
diabetes,114,115 and unhealthy diet,98,116,117 have been associ-
ated with both microvascular dysfunction and depression.
However, we mainly used results that were adjusted for car-
diometabolicriskfactorsinourmeta-analysis.Thisfindingmay
suggest that microvascular dysfunction represents an inde-
pendent pathway in the development of depression. Fourth,
acute and chronic stress can result in autonomic and hypo-
thalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation, which in turn
can contribute to both depression and cardiovascular
disease.118 Stress-induced elevated cortisol levels may cause
cerebralatrophy,reducedneurogenesis,synapticplasticity,and
monoaminergic signaling, all of which could contribute to the
development of depression.119
The exact pathogenesis of WMHs is currently undeter-
mined. Several studies have assumed that WMHs are due to
ischemia7,8,120,121; however, evidence indicates that WMHs
originate from cerebral endothelial dysfunction.122 This evi-
dence is supported by findings that WMHs and microinfarc-
tions are associated with leakage of plasma fluid compo-
nents, arteriolar wall infiltration, thickening of the arteriolar
wall, and changes in perivascular tissue, causing disruption of
the normal architecture, including damaged arteriolar smooth
muscle cells and fibrin depositions. In addition, the specific
anatomy of capillaries (with functional shunts and tight con-
trol of capillary flow patterns) could enable 2 distinct mecha-
nisms to induce ischemia within the brain: limited blood
supply and limited oxygen extraction due to capillary
dysfunction.123
Strengths and Limitations
The strengths of this study include the large number of in-
cluded studies and individuals with depression, resulting in
high statistical power, which allowed an extensive explora-
tion of the cause of heterogeneity within the meta-analysis.
This meta-analysis is limited by the available literature. Based
on the available data, we cannot rule out the possibility of re-
verse causality. It is plausible to assume that the association
between microvascular dysfunction and depression is bidi-
rectional; that is, microvascular dysfunction may cause de-
pression, and vice versa. The proposed temporality was sup-
ported by the longitudinal association for WMHs and
depression, but could not be confirmed for other markers of
microvascular dysfunction. Further longitudinal studies are
needed to address this issue. In addition, the interrelation-
ships among medical comorbidities, microvascular dysfunc-
tion, and depression could only partly be assessed. There-
fore, an important limitation of this meta-analysis and indeed
of the source studies is that we cannot exclude residual con-
founding by variables not considered in the source studies.
However,basedonoursubanalyses,confoundingbytype2dia-
betes, hypertension, and cardiovascular risk factors is un-
likely. In addition, some of the indicators of vascular dysfunc-
tion, such as albuminuria, may be less specific and may more
likely reflect a general health status, which could have led to
an overestimation of the association. Furthermore, most stud-
ies on plasma biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction mea-
sured multiple biomarkers; therefore, we did not calculate a
pooled estimate. Nevertheless, when focusing on the pooled
ORs per specific biomarker, the 95% CIs were virtually within
the same range. Finally, data on the association between al-
buminuria, retinal diameters, and depression appeared to be
scarce, while data on albuminuria were available only in study
populations with disease, and therefore cannot be extrapo-
lated to the general population.

 As the cerebral microvasculature is difficult to study, there
isaneedtodevelopmoreadvancedandpowerfulimagingtech-
niques, such as 7-T magnetic resonance imaging and diffuse
tensor imaging, which may provide more sensitive research
tools with more detailed structural information on microvas-
cularchangesasseenincerebralsmallvesseldisease.124-127Fur-
thermore, several state-of-the-art techniques have been de-
veloped to investigate the microcirculation throughout the
body, such as sublingual intravital microscopy,128 skin laser-
Dopplerflowmetry,113,129dynamicretinalvesselanalysis,129and
skin capillaroscopy.130 Large-scale studies using these new
techniques are of crucial importance to unravel the associa-
tion between microvascular dysfunction and depression. In
addition, experimental studies are needed to demonstrate
the possible causal role of microvascular dysfunction in de-
pression. Multiple drugs, such as angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors131 and statins,132,133 as well as lifestyle
interventions134,135 have been shown to improve microvascu-
lar function; it is not known, however, whether such inter-
ventions can improve brain microcirculatory function in gen-
eral or WMHs specifically.136 Some evidence exists that
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be effica-
ciousinthetreatmentofdepression.137-139However,largerran-
domized trials have not been performed. Statins may provide
another intervention of interest in depression, although the
current literature reports conflicting results.140-145 Random-
ized clinical trials in individuals at high risk for or with de-
pression may provide further insight into the role of microcir-
culatory dysfunction in the prevention and/or treatment of
depression.
Conclusions
This meta-analysis shows that generalized microvascular dys-
function is associated with higher odds of depression and that
cerebralsmallvesseldiseaseisassociatedwithanincreasedrisk
for the development of depression over time. These findings
supportthehypothesisthatmicrovasculardysfunctioniscaus-
ally linked to depression. This finding may have clinical impli-
cations, as microvascular dysfunction might provide a poten-
tial target for the prevention and treatment of depression.
