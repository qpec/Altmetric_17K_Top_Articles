BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking has been linked with several factors 
associated with cardiac dysfunction. We hypothesized that cigarette 
smoking is associated with left ventricular (LV) structure and function, and 
incident heart failure (HF) hospitalization.
METHODS: We investigated 4129 (never smoker n=2884, current smoker 
n=503, and former smoker n=742) black participants (mean age, 54 
years; 63% women) without a history of HF or coronary heart disease 
at baseline in the Jackson Heart Study. We examined the relationships 
between cigarette smoking and LV structure and function by using cardiac 
magnetic resonance imaging among 1092 participants, cigarette smoking 
and brain natriuretic peptide levels among 3325 participants, and incident 
HF hospitalization among 3633 participants with complete data.
RESULTS: After adjustment for confounding factors, current smoking 
was associated with higher mean LV mass index and lower mean LV 
circumferential strain (P<0.05, for both) in comparison with never 
smoking. Smoking status, intensity, and burden were associated with 
higher mean brain natriuretic peptide levels (all P<0.05). Over 8.0 years 
(7.7–8.0) median follow-up, there were 147 incident HF hospitalizations. 
After adjustment for traditional risk factors and incident coronary heart 
disease, current smoking (hazard ratio, 2.82; 95% confidence interval, 
1.71–4.64), smoking intensity among current smokers (≥20 cigarettes/d: 
hazard ratio, 3.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.65–7.32), and smoking 
burden among ever smokers (≥15 pack-years: hazard ratio, 2.06; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.29–3.3) were significantly associated with incident 
HF hospitalization in comparison with never smoking.
CONCLUSIONS: In blacks, cigarette smoking is an important risk factor 
for LV hypertrophy, systolic dysfunction, and incident HF hospitalization 
even after adjusting for effects on coronary heart disease.

igarette smoking is a risk factor for heart failure 
(HF) independent of traditional risk factors.1–5 
Whereas cigarette smoking increases the risk 
of coronary heart disease (CHD), a major cause of HF, 
there may be other effects of smoking that result in car-
diac dysfunction and HF.6 For example, smoking acutely 
increases systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total sys-
temic vascular resistance, pulmonary artery pressure, 
and pulmonary vascular resistance, all known risk fac-
tors for HF.7 Furthermore, smoking is associated with 
carbon monoxide exposure, which has been reported 
to increase oxidative stress and lead to impaired mito-
chondrial function, inflammation, impaired endothelial 
function, and worsening renal function, all of which 
have been implicated in the pathophysiology of HF.8–13
Blacks have a doubling in the incidence of HF in com-
parison with other races.14 The prevalence of current 
cigarette smoking among blacks has declined in recent 
years, but remains ≈18% among adults.15 Although 
some epidemiological studies have demonstrated a sig-
nificant association of current cigarette smoking with 
risk of developing HF, there are limited data specific to 
blacks who are substantially affected by cardiovascular 
diseases.
We hypothesized that cigarette smoking is associ-
ated with cardiac remodeling, left ventricular dysfunc-
tion, and incident HF hospitalization in blacks. To test 
this hypothesis, we examined the association of ciga-
rette smoking status, intensity, and burden with cardiac 
structure and function and incident HF hospitalization 
in the JHS (Jackson Heart Study).
METHODS
The data, analytic methods, and study materials can be made 
available to other researchers for purposes of reproduc-
ing the results or replicating the procedure by following the 
Jackson Heart Study publications procedures and data use 
agreements.
Study Participants
The JHS is a large prospective community-based observational 
study designed to investigate risk factors for cardiovascular 
diseases in blacks. Details of the JHS study design, recruit-
ment, and data collection have been described previously.16 
In brief, 5301 black participants residing in the Jackson, 
Mississippi, tricounty area (Hinds, Rankin, and Madison) 
were recruited for the baseline examination between 2000 
and 2004 and completed 3 subsequent study follow-up visits 
(visit 1, 2000–2004; visit 2, 2005–2008; visit 3, 2009–2012). 
The JHS was approved by the institutional review boards of 
Jackson State University, Tougaloo College, and the University 
of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi. All study 
participants provided written informed consent. 
For the present analysis, we excluded all individuals with 
a history of CHD or HF (n=717), missing CHD/HF data (n=5), 
missing information on smoking status (n=33), or missing 
information on study covariates (n=422) at visit 1 (Figure 1).
Smoking Information
Smoking information was obtained via questionnaire at both 
visits 1 and 3. Participants who smoked >400 cigarettes in 
their lifetime were defined as ever smokers. Participants who 
gave a positive response to the question, “Do you now smoke 
cigarettes?” were classified as current smokers. Those who 
responded negatively to both of these questions were clas-
sified as never smokers.12 Participants who smoked >400 
cigarettes but no longer smoked at the time of the exami-
nation were classified as former smokers. Cigarettes per day 
(smoking intensity) and pack-years (smoking burden) were 
also collected. Smoking burden and data related to time since 
quitting in former smokers is available in Table I in the online-
only Data Supplement.
Clinical Covariates
At each examination, systolic and diastolic blood pressures 
were measured in the right arm of participants twice using 
the random-0 blood pressure sphygmomanometer (Hawksley 
and Sons Limited). The first blood pressure was obtained after 
allowing the participant to rest for 5 minutes in a seated posi-
tion, and the second blood pressure was obtained after wait-
ing 1 additional minute. The average of the 2 measurements 
was used. Body mass index was calculated as body weight 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor for 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however, 
less is known about the risk for heart failure (par-
ticularly in blacks).
• We found that current cigarette smoking status, 
smoking intensity (cigarettes per day), and smok-
ing burden (pack-years) were independently asso-
ciated with higher left ventricular mass, lower left 
ventricular strain, higher brain natriuretic peptide 
levels, and higher risk of incident heart failure hos-
pitalization in blacks.
• These relationships were significant after adjust-
ment for coronary heart disease, suggesting mech-
anisms beyond atherosclerosis probably contribute 
to myocardial dysfunction and increased risk of 
heart failure in smokers.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Blacks are disproportionately affected by cardiovas-
cular diseases, including heart failure and they are 
more likely to die of smoking-related diseases than 
whites.
• Our findings suggest that smoking is associated 
with structural and functional left ventricular 
abnormalities that lead to heart failure in blacks 
and that smoking cessation should be encouraged 
in those with risk factors for heart failure.

(kg)/height (m2). Self-reported antihypertensive medication 
use was collected at the time of each examination. Venous 
blood samples were drawn from each participant after >12 
hours of fasting. Fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c, 
and serum creatinine levels were assessed by using standard 
laboratory techniques. Diabetes mellitus was defined as the 
use of diabetes medications, a hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5%, or a 
fasting blood glucose ≥126 mg/dL at baseline. Estimated glo-
merular filtration rate was calculated by using the Modification 
of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation.17
Cardiac and Aortic Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging
Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images were obtained 
with 1.5T MR Siemens Espree scanner (Siemens Medical 
Solutions) at visit 3 (Figure 1) in a randomly selected subset 
of 1092 participants without incident CHD between visits 1 
and 3. Cine and tagged imaging were performed to assess 
LV mass, volumes, and deformation parameters. LV mass and 
volumes were indexed to body surface area measured at visit 
3. LV peak midwall circumferential strain was assessed at the 
apex, middle, and base of the LV, and these 3 variables were 
averaged to determine total LV circumferential strain. All 
strain variables are negative values; more negative values indi-
cate greater circumferential shortening. The coefficients of 
variation of each LV strain variable are as follows: base strain, 
19.0%; mid strain, 20.2%; apex strain, 18.3%; and total 
strain, 15.5%. CMR aortic pulse wave velocity was calculated 
as follows: pulse wave velocity (m/s) = distance (mm)/transit 
time between ascending to the diaphragm level of descend-
ing aorta (ms). Transit time was calculated as the average time 
difference using the least-squares estimate between all data 
points on the systolic upslope of the ascending and descend-
ing aortic flow curves after peak flow normalization, and 
distance from ascending to descending aorta was measured 
using the oblique sagittal image through the thoracic aorta.
Brain Natriuretic Peptide Measurements
Plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were mea-
sured at visit 1 using a chemiluminescent immunoas-
say performed on the Siemens Advia Centaur (Siemens 
Medical Solutions) (Figure 1).18 The coefficient of variation 
of the assay was previously described.18 We included the 
histogram of raw BNP data in the Figure in the online-only 
Data Supplement.
Outcomes of the Longitudinal Study
The primary outcome was time to HF hospitalization. In the 
JHS cohort, HF hospitalization surveillance began January 
1, 2005. Among participants who survived to January 1, 
2005, we assessed the cumulative incidence of HF hospital-
ization from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2012 
(Figure 1). Potential HF hospitalizations were identified and 
adjudicated as previously described.19 In brief, hospitalization 
data were obtained from the hospital discharge index from 
all catchment area hospitals and annual follow-up informa-
tion. Hospitalization data from noncatchment area hospitals 
were obtained after participant consent. The self-reported 
data from annual follow-up were confirmed with the hos-
pital discharge index data. The primary diagnoses based on 
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical 
Modification codes were reviewed by trained medical person-
nel and adjudicated by trained adjudicators based on signs 
and symptoms, clinical documentation, laboratory tests, chest 
x-ray films, and other imaging modalities including echocar-
diography, multiple gated acquisition scans, and magnetic 
resonance imaging.20 Incident CHD was ascertained through 
directed patient queries during an annual telephone follow-
up and ongoing surveillance of hospitalizations, and subse-
quently confirmed through the review of hospital records.
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean with SDs for normally distributed 
continuous variables, median with interquartile ranges for 
nonnormally distributed continuous variables, and frequen-
cies and proportions for categorical variables. ANOVA with 
post hoc Bonferroni test, Mann-Whitney U test, and χ2 test 
were used for comparison of variables between smoking 
status groups if applicable. Relationships between smoking 
variables and BNP levels and cardiac structure and function 
were examined as cross-sectional analyses at visit 1 and visit 
3, respectively. Relationships between smoking variables and 
incident HF hospitalization were assessed as prospective lon-
gitudinal analyses.

Cross-Sectional Study
Relationships between smoking status (current, former, never), 
intensity among current smokers (cigarettes/d), and burden 
among ever smokers (pack-years), and cardiac structure and 
function measured using CMR (LV volume variables, LV ejection 
fraction, LV mass index, LV mass/volume, and LV systolic strain 
variables) and BNP levels were assessed by using linear regression 
analysis. Two models, minimally and further adjusted models, 
were constructed to evaluate the associations of smoking and 
cardiac structure and function. Model 1 included adjustment for 
age and sex, whereas model 2, in addition, included body mass 
index, systolic blood pressure, use of antihypertension medica-
tion, and history of diabetes based on a previous meta-analysis, 
and we additionally included estimated glomerular filtration rate 
to determine if the effect of smoking is independent of its effect 
on renal function.12,21 Medication use may affect the relationship 
between smoking status and LV structure and function. Thus, 
we created another model to examine the relationship between 
smoking status and LV structure and function assessed by car-
diac magnetic resonance imaging with additional adjustment for 
classes of medications (calcium channel blocker use, β-blocker 
use, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin 
receptor blocker use, and diuretics use; Table II in the online-only 
Data Supplement) instead of antihypertensive medication use. To 
examine the possibility of unmeasured differences in blood pres-
sure that may affect the associations, we additionally included 
average ambulatory systolic blood pressure instead of office 
systolic blood pressure (model 3). Ambulatory systolic blood 
pressure monitoring was performed as previously described.22 
Ambulatory systolic blood pressure was evaluated only at visit 1, 
and the number of included participants who underwent ambu-
latory systolic blood pressure monitoring was small (n=711). 
Therefore, we were only able to examine the relationship 
between smoking status and BNP levels (model 3). Aortic valve 
stenosis and mitral valve regurgitation can increase LV load and 
promote LV hypertrophy. Thus, we additionally adjusted for aor-
tic valve stenosis and mitral valve regurgitation severity evaluated 
by echocardiography at visit 1. Analyses of smoking status and 
BNP levels (Table III in the online-only Data Supplement, model 
4), and smoking status and incident HF hospitalization (Table IV 
in the online-only Data Supplement, model 5) were additionally 
performed with adjustment for the grade of aortic valve steno-
sis and mitral valve regurgitation. Detailed information on the 
echocardiographic methods is described in the online-only Data 
Supplement. BNP levels were natural log transformed because 
they were not normally distributed. To visualize the relationship 
between smoking intensity and burden and BNP levels, restricted 
cubic spline curves were used. The analysis was adjusted using 
multiple covariates (model 2), and we used 3 knots. Knots were 
located at 10 (half-pack), 20 (pack), and 40 cigarettes (2 packs)/d 
for intensity, and 7.5, 15, and 30 pack-years for burden. For this 
analysis, the y axes were expressed as adjusted geometric mean 
ratios with 95% confidence interval (CI).
Longitudinal Study
We constructed Kaplan-Meier curves for cumulative survival 
free from incident HF for smoking status (current, former, 
never), intensity among current smokers (cigarettes/d), and 
burden among ever smokers (pack-years), and compared by 
using log-rank tests. Cox proportional hazards models were 
used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of incident HF by 
using smoking status, intensity, and burden category groups. 
Censoring was applied to both loss to follow-up and deaths. 
The assumption of proportionality was tested by using 
Schoenfeld residuals. No significant deviations from propor-
tionality were observed. Several models were constructed to 
evaluate associations of smoking information with outcomes. 
The same models that were used in the cross-sectional analyses 
were used, with the exception of model 2, in which incident 
CHD was additionally included as a time-dependent variable to 
evaluate the influence of incident CHD on incident HF. All sta-
tistical analyses were performed with STATA version 14 (STATA 
Corp). A 2-sided P value of <0.05 was considered significant.

ers, and 2884 (70%) were never smokers. Never smok-
ers were more likely to be women than the other smok-
ing status groups. Former smokers were older and had 
a higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes mel-
litus than the other smoking status groups. Current 
smokers had a higher prevalence of current drinking, a 
lower prevalence of achieving the recommended physi-
cal activity level, and a higher mean estimated glomeru-
lar filtration rate than the other smoking status groups. 
The prevalence of taking calcium channel blockers, β-
blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or 
angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics was higher 
in former smokers than in the other groups, and the 
prevalence of taking these antihypertensive medica-
tions in current smokers was lower than in never smok-
ers (Table 1).
Smoking Status and Cardiac Structure 
and Function Assessed by CMR at Visit 3
After adjustment for confounding factors, current 
smoking was associated with higher mean LV mass 
index (β-coefficient, 5.24; 95% CI, 2.71–7.77) and 
LV mass/volume ratio (β-coefficient, 0.12; 95% CI, 
0.06–0.18), whereas smoking status was not associ-
ated with mean LV volume measurements or LV ejec-
tion fraction (Table 2). However, current smoking was 
significantly associated with lower mean LV systolic 
function assessed with LV circumferential strain (total 
peak systolic circumferential strain: β-coefficient, 0.74; 
95% CI, 0.26–1.22). Current smoking also was associ-
ated with higher mean pulse wave velocity in model 2 
(β-coefficient, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.09–2.41) (Table 2). After 
additional adjustment for medication class (model 3), 
the relationship between smoking status and cardiac 
structure and function was not remarkably changed 
(Table II in the online-only Data Supplement). Howev-
er, in this model, former smoking was associated with 
lower LV mass index.
Smoking Status, Intensity, and Burden 
and BNP Levels at Visit 1
After adjustment for confounding factors, current 
smoking (model 2: β-coefficient, 0.182; 95% CI, 
0.074–0.290), smoking intensity among current smok-
ers (model 2, ≥20 cigarettes/d versus never smokers: 
β-coefficient, 0.298; 95% CI, 0.122–0.474), and smok-
ing burden among ever smokers (model 2, ≥30 pack-
years versus never smoker: β-coefficient, 0.139; 95% 
CI, 0.018–0.260) were significantly associated with 
higher mean BNP levels (Tables 3 through 5). Even after 
adjustment for mean systolic ambulatory blood pres-
sure instead of office systolic blood pressure, the asso-
ciation was not remarkably changed (Tables 3 through 
5, model 3). After adjustment for grade of aortic valve 
stenosis and mitral valve regurgitation severity, the as-
sociation was not remarkably changed (Table III in the

Smoking Status, Intensity and Burden, 
and Incident HF Hospitalizations
At the time of January 1, 2005, 3633 participants of 
4129 were alive and eligible for the longitudinal analysis. 
Over a median follow-up of 8.0 years (interquartile range, 
7.7–8.0 years), there were 147 incident HF hospitaliza-
tions (incidence rate, 5.46/1000 person-years). Both for-
mer and current smokers had a higher incidence of HF 
than never smokers (log-rank P<0.01) (Figure 3). Current 
smoking was associated with increased incident HF hos-
pitalizations after adjustment for conventional risk factors 
and incident CHD as a time-dependent variable (HR, 2.82; 
95% CI, 1.71–4.64) (Table 6). Furthermore, smoking in-
tensity among current smokers (model 2, ≥20 cigarettes/d 
versus never smoker: HR, 3.48; 95% CI, 1.65–7.32) was 
associated with incident HF hospitalization in multivariable 
analyses (Table 7). Smoking burden among ever smokers 
was associated with incident HF, albeit not linearly (model 
2, ≥15 pack-years versus never smoker: HR, 2.06; 95% 
CI, 1.29–3.33, P<0.01 and ≥30 pack-years versus never 
smoker: HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.00–2.56) (Table 8). After ad-
ditional adjustment for valvular heart disease, the associa-
tion was not remarkably changed (Table IV in the online-
only Data Supplement, model 5).

In our community-based cohort of blacks, current smok-
ing was associated with a higher LV mass and lower LV

circumferential strain assessed by CMR. Current smoking 
status and higher levels of smoking intensity and burden 
were associated with higher mean BNP levels at baseline. 
Furthermore, current smoking and higher levels of smok-
ing intensity and burden also were associated with in-
creased risk of incident HF hospitalization after adjusting 
for possible confounding factors including incident CHD.
Limited evidence on the relationship between smok-
ing and HF currently exists.1–5,23,24 In the Health ABC 
study (Aging and Body Composition), both current 
smoking and past smoking were associated with inci-
dent HF independently of incident CHD, and smoking 
burden was associated with incident HF among former 
smokers, but not among current smokers.1 The impact 
of current smoking on incident HF was higher in our 
study (HRs 1.93 versus 2.82 in ours) than in their study. 
To our knowledge, their study was the first that exam-
ined the relationship between smoking status and inci-
dent HF with adjustment for incident CHD, and the ex-
amination of the relationships between smoking burden 
and incident HF, as well. Our study results are consistent 
with the Health ABC Study, and extend the findings to 
a large cohort of blacks. However, in contrast to the 
Health ABC Study, our study showed dose-dependent 
associations of smoking intensity among current smok-
ers on incident HF accounting for incident CHD. This 
difference may be attributed to the difference in the 
numbers of current smokers in their study (n=221) and 
ours (n=503). In their study, past smoking was associ-
ated with incident HF, and there was dose dependency 
between smoking burden and incident HF among for-
mer smokers. Thus, the relationship between smoking 
behavior and incident HF could be different because of 
other factors including different ethnicities (40% blacks 
in the Health ABC Study and 100% blacks in our study). 
Recently published articles reported the relationships 
between smoking and different phenotypes of incident 
HF. In the PREVEND study (The Prevention of Renal and 
Vascular Endstage Disease Intervention Trial), current 
smoking was associated with incident HF with reduced 
ejection fraction.4 However, in the Framingham Heart 
Study, current smoking was associated with incident 
HF with preserved ejection fraction.3 In the JHS, the 
information on phenotypes of incident HF is currently 
not available, and further investigation is warranted to 
determine whether smoking status is associated with 
specific phenotypes of incident HF in blacks.
There are several previous studies that examined the 
relationship between smoking and LV mass.25–30 Many 
of them showed a positive association; however, there 
are some studies that showed neutral or negative asso-
ciations.27,28 We showed a positive association between 
current smoking and LV mass among those without 
CHD. These observations are supported by several previ-
ous studies that demonstrated a positive relationship be-
tween current smoking and LV hypertrophy.25,26 Our study

confirmed this finding in a large community-based cohort 
of blacks. It is important to note that our study used CMR 
data. CMR is a more accurate technique for assessment 
of LV wall thickness, volumes, and ejection fraction than 
echocardiography; therefore, CMR offers diagnostic ad-
vantages over echocardiography.31–33 Furthermore, our 
results are consistent with other studies evaluating risk 
factors such as smoking and CMR-derived measures of 
cardiac structure.29 One prior study that showed a nega-
tive association between smoking and LV mass or LV mass 
index used a unique cohort of Army Training Regiment 
recruits with an average age of 20 years.28 Thus, the re-
sults of that study may not be generalizable to the gen-
eral community or older smokers. In our analysis, after 
additional adjustment for class of medication use, former 
smoking was associated with lower LV mass index. The 
mechanism of this association is unclear at this point, and 
further investigation on this issue is warranted.
A recently published study showed a significant corre-
lation between current smoking and LV diastolic dysfunc-
tion assessed by tissue Doppler echo imaging.26 This study 
also found a nonsignificant relationship between smok-
ing and global longitudinal strain. Another study showed 
an adverse association between smoking status and bur-
den on LV circumferential strain assessed by CMR among 
those without any symptoms or history of cardiovascu-
lar disease.34 These study findings are somewhat limited 
by their cross-sectional design and lack of HF outcomes. 
Our study builds on this work by using a large cohort of 
blacks and demonstrating and linking the associations of 
adverse structural and functional cardiac effects of ciga-
rette smoking with incident HF hospitalizations.
In our study, smoking status, intensity, and burden 
were associated with higher BNP levels. Nadruz and 
colleagues35 showed that, among those free of overt 
CHD and HF, cumulative cigarette exposure assessed by 
pack-years was associated with higher N-terminal pro-
BNP levels, and active smokers had a higher incidence of 
elevated N-terminal pro-BNP levels after 15 years of fol-
low up. Otsuka and colleagues36 also showed smoking 
status was positively associated with higher N-terminal 
pro-BNP levels. Our study results showed that all mea-
sures of smoking (status, intensity, and burden) were 
associated with higher BNP levels, and extended these 
findings to a large cohort of blacks. Both larger LV mass 
index and higher BNP levels reflect higher LV wall stress. 
Based on our findings, it is possible that current smok-
ing, smoking intensity, and smoking burden are associ-
ated with higher LV wall stress, increasing the risk of HF.
Cigarette smoking has been associated with higher 
levels of inflammatory cytokines and dysfunction and 
death of endothelial cells through increased oxidative 
stress.9,10,37,38 Endothelial dysfunction and inflammation 
may affect cardiac structure and function either through 
direct influences on the myocardium or indirectly by ac-
celerating arterial atherosclerosis and augmented LV af-
terload. In turn, carbon monoxide exposure may cause 
LV hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction independently 
of its effect on endothelial function or blood pressure.11 
These collective effects of smoking may result in the 
larger LV mass and systolic dysfunction seen in our 
study. Furthermore, cigarette smoking is independently 
associated with worsening of kidney function.12 Thus, 
cigarette smoking–related alterations of cardiac struc-
ture and function, combined with impairment of renal 
function, may lead to incident HF independently of 
CHD. In this study, smoking burden among ever smok-
ers was associated with incident HF, albeit nonlinearly. 
This may be related to a longer time since quitting in 
the group with the highest smoking burden (≥30 pack-

years). Regardless, higher smoking burdens (both ≥15 
pack-years and ≥30 pack-years) were significantly as-
sociated with more incident HF hospitalization.
In the current study, former smoking was not asso-
ciated with adverse cardiac remodeling, impaired car-
diac function, BNP levels, or incident HF hospitalization 
after adjusting for possible confounding factors. These 
findings suggest that smoking cessation may be an im-
portant strategy to reduce the risk of impaired cardiac 
function and HF in current smokers.
Our study has a few limitations including lack of 
information about the type of cigarettes (including 
tar concentration or menthol) that the participants 
smoked. Self-reported smoking status was not con-
firmed with cotinine levels, which are currently unavail-
able in JHS. Our data were obtained from an all-black 
cohort in Jackson, Mississippi, and may not be gener-
alizable to other ethnic/racial groups or other regions. 
Unmeasured confounding may have influenced the re-
sults. It is also possible that HF cases may have been 
missed (or misclassified); however, the definition for HF 
that was used has been previously used and validated 
in other JHS analyses, and in ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk 
in Communities Study), as well. In our study, the rela-
tionships between smoking status and BNP levels and 
cardiac structure and function were assessed at visits 
1 and 3, respectively. The longitudinal relationship be-
tween smoking status and HF hospitalization was eval-
uated beginning 5 years after visit 1 (2005). Therefore, 
time differences of performed examinations may limit 
the causal inference of the effect of smoking on car-
diac structure and function and BNP with the relation-
ship between smoking and HF hospitalization. Finally, 
because of the lack of follow-up echocardiograms and 
appropriate clinical data, we were unable to assess the 
type of HF (ie, HF with preserved versus reduced ejec-
tion fraction).
Our study also has several strengths. To our knowl-
edge, this study is the first prospective study to show a 
dose relationship between cigarette smoking and inci-
dent HF in a large cohort of blacks. Blacks have a higher 
incidence of HF than whites, Hispanics, and Asians.14,39 
Thus, smoking cessation may be a potential strategy to 
attenuate the higher rate of HF in blacks. Because of 
superior reliability, we used CMR instead of echocar-
diography to assess cardiac structure and function.40
Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor for cardio-
vascular disease. However, the influences on cardiac struc-
ture and function may not be fully recognized because of 
the strong association with CHD. In our study, cigarette 
smoking was associated with higher mean LV mass index 
and LV mass/volume assessed with CMR among those 
without known CHD. Smoking intensity and burden also 
are associated with higher mean BNP levels and incident 
HF in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, in blacks, cig-
arette smoking is a strong risk factor for higher LV mass 
and systolic dysfunction, and incident HF hospitalization 
independent of its effects on incident CHD.
