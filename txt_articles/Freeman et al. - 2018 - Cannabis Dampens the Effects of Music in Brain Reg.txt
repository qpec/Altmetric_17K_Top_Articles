Abstract
Background: Despite the current shift towards permissive cannabis policies, few studies have investigated the pleasurable 
effects users seek. Here, we investigate the effects of cannabis on listening to music, a rewarding activity that frequently 
occurs in the context of recreational cannabis use. We additionally tested how these effects are influenced by cannabidiol, 
which may offset cannabis-related harms.
Methods: Across 3 sessions, 16 cannabis users inhaled cannabis with cannabidiol, cannabis without cannabidiol, and placebo. 
We compared their response to music relative to control excerpts of scrambled sound during functional Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging within regions identified in a meta-analysis of music-evoked reward and emotion. All results were False Discovery 
Rate corrected (P 
< 
.05).
Results: Compared with placebo, cannabis without cannabidiol dampened response to music in bilateral auditory cortex 
(right: P 
= 
.005, left: P 
= 
.008), right hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus (P 
= 
.025), right amygdala (P 
= 
.025), and right ventral 
striatum (P 
= 
.033). Across all sessions, the effects of music in this ventral striatal region correlated with pleasure ratings 
(P 
= 
.002) and increased functional connectivity with auditory cortex (right: P 
< .001, left: P 
< .001), supporting its involvement 
in music reward. Functional connectivity between right ventral striatum and auditory cortex was increased by cannabidiol 
(right: P 
= 
.003, left: P 
= 
.030), and cannabis with cannabidiol did not differ from placebo on any functional Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging measures. Both types of cannabis increased ratings of wanting to listen to music (P 
< 
.002) and enhanced sound 
perception (P 
< 
.001).
Conclusions: Cannabis dampens the effects of music in brain regions sensitive to reward and emotion. These effects were 
offset by a key cannabis constituent, cannabidol.

Introduction
The main psychoactive constituent of cannabis, THC (delta-
9-tetrahydrocannabinol), produces subjective effects such as 
feeling “stoned” and can impair memory and elicit transient 
psychotic-like symptoms (Curran et al., 2016). Certain types of 
cannabis also contain cannabidiol (CBD), which can have oppos-
ite effects of THC on a range of functional neuroimaging tasks 
(Bhattacharyya et al., 2010; Batalla et al., 2014). Moreover, CBD 
has been found to offset harmful effects of THC (e.g., memory 
impairment and psychotic-like symptoms) without influencing 
subjective intoxication (Curran et al., 2016; Englund et al., 2017). 
Cannabis containing high THC and little if any CBD is becoming 
increasingly prevalent (Hardwick and King 2008; ElSohly et al., 
2016) and has been linked to greater mental health and addic-
tion problems compared with less potent varieties of cannabis 
(Di Forti et al., 2015; Freeman and Winstock 2015).
Despite the changes currently occurring in cannabis legisla-
tion worldwide, including legalization of use for medicine and 
pleasure (Room 2014), few studies have attempted to document 
the effects that recreational users seek (Curran et al., 2016). The 
limited evidence of positive effects tends to have arisen inci-
dentally in studies investigating cannabis-related harms. For 
example, THC has been reported to increase phonological flu-
ency (Curran et al., 2002), a measure of divergent thinking, espe-
cially among people with low trait creativity (Schafer et al., 2012).
Cannabis has a strong historical link to music and is associated 
with several distinct styles, including jazz, reggae, and rock (Booth 
2004). Cannabis is reported to enhance appreciation of music (Tart 
1970; Green et al., 2003), and its use is consistently high among 
people who attend music festivals and nightclubs (Lim et al., 2008; 
Van Havere et al., 2011; Palamar et al., 2015). This association may 
be partly attributable to shared effects on reward circuitry between 
drug and nondrug rewards (Berridge and Kringelbach 2015). Music 
recruits key regions in the reward network, including ventral stri-
atum, mediodorsal thalamus, anterior insula, orbitofrontal cortex, 
amygdala, and hippocampus (Koelsch 2014).
Many of these reward-related brain regions are character-
ized by a high density of Cannabinoid T
ype-1 Receptors (CB1Rs) 
(Curran et al., 2016). THC is a partial agonist of CB1Rs and may 
influence response to music by interfering with endogenous 
CB1R ligands such as anandamide (Thieme et al., 2014), which 
plays a causal role in consummatory response to reward (Mahler 
et al., 2007). A human neuroimaging study found that THC (a 
partial CB1R agonist) dampened the effects of monetary reward 
feedback across a widespread network, including temporal and 
orbitofrontal cortices, while leaving reward anticipation intact 
(van Hell et al., 2012). By contrast, 7-day administration of a 
CB1R antagonist was found to diminish response to food reward 
in ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex (Horder et al., 2010).
Additionally, THC causes modest, regionally selective 
increased dopamine release in limbic striatum (Bossong et al., 
2015). Such effects might enhance the rewarding experience of 
music, which can also elicit dopamine release in ventral stri-
atum (Salimpoor et al., 2011) as well as enhancing activation 
and connectivity between mesolimbic brain regions (Blood 
and Zatorre 2001; Menon and Levitin 2005; Koelsch et al., 2006; 
Salimpoor et al., 2011; Trost et al., 2012). Functional connectivity 
between ventral striatum and auditory cortex during listening 
also predicts the rewarding experience of music (Salimpoor et 
al., 2013; Zatorre and Salimpoor 2013; Martínez-Molina et al., 
2016).
Here, we conducted the first controlled experimental study 
on the interactive effects of cannabis and music. Based on pre-
vious findings that cannabis and music activate and increase 
connectivity between common regions in the reward net-
work, whereas a CB1R antagonist dampened neural response 
to reward (Horder et al., 2010), and observational data linking 
cannabis use and music, we hypothesized that cannabis would 
increase haemodynamic response to music in brain regions 
sensitive to reward and emotion (Koelsch 2014) as well as sub-
jective ratings (wanting to listen to music, pleasure of listen-
ing). Given that CBD and THC can have opposing neural effects 
(Bhattacharyya et al., 2010; Batalla et al., 2014) and CBD can 
attenuate THC harms (Curran et al., 2016; Englund et al., 2017), 
we predicted that these effects would be partially offset by CBD.
Methods
Design and Participants
A randomized, double-blind, crossover design compared can-
nabis with CBD (Cann+CBD), cannabis without CBD (Cann-CBD) 
and matched placebo in 16 cannabis users. Experimental ses-
sions were separated by at least 1 week (>3 times the elimin-
ation half-life of THC) to minimize carryover effects (D’Souza 
et al., 2004; Hindocha et al., 2015). In addition to the music task 
described here, participants completed additional assessments 
that are reported elsewhere (Lawn et al., 2016). Inclusion cri-
teria were fluency in English, right-handedness, age between 
18 and 70 years, and self-reported current cannabis use (≥4 
times in the last year, ≤3 times/wk, ability to smoke a whole 
joint to oneself). We did not collect data on participants’ typ-
ical method of administering cannabis. However, previous 
data from the UK suggest that the majority (~76%) of cannabis 
users typically smoke cannabis together with tobacco in joints, 
and only a small minority (~4%) use a vaporizer as their most 
common route (Hindocha et al., 2016). Exclusion criteria were 
Significance Statement
Here, we report that cannabis administration decreased response to music in several brain regions linked to reward and 
emotion. These included right ventral striatum, which showed increased functional connectivity with auditory cortex 
and correlated with pleasure ratings during musical listening, consistent with its critical role in reward processing. 
These effects were offset when cannabis contained cannabidiol, a key cannabinoid that has been found to reduce some 
harmful effects of cannabis.

self-reported frequent and/or severe adverse reactions to can-
nabis, current use of illicit drugs other than cannabis more than 
twice per month, current alcohol use >4 d/wk, significant phys-
ical health problems, color blindness, current treatment for a 
psychiatric disorder, current/history of psychosis, and current/
history of psychosis in an immediate family member. This study 
was approved by the UCL ethics committee, and all participants 
provided written informed consent.
Procedure
Following telephone screening, eligible participants completed 
a baseline session consisting of task training (outside of the MRI 
scanner), video training for drug administration, drug history 
(Freeman et al., 2012), and problematic cannabis use on Severity 
of Dependence Scale (Gossop et al., 1995). The Beck Depression 
Inventory-II (Beck et al., 1996) and Temporal Experiences of 
Pleasure (Gard et al., 2006) were also administered. Each experi-
mental session began with a urinary drug screen to verify recent 
use reported by Timeline Follow-back (Sobell and Sobell 1992). 
Next, 11-point (0–10) Numerical Rating Scales were adminis-
tered ~0 minutes before drug inhalation (Pre-Drug), ~5 minutes 
after first drug administration (Post-Drug), and ~90 minutes 
after first drug administration (Post-Scan). The Numerical 
Rating Scales “Want to Listen to Music” and “Enhanced Sound 
Perception” were administered at all 3 of these time points; “Feel 
Drug Effect,” “Like Drug Effect,” and “Want More Drug” were 
administered only after drug administration (Post-Drug and 
Post-Scan). Heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
were also recorded at the same 3 time points (Pre-Drug, Post-
Drug, Post-Scan).
Drug Administration
Cannabis was obtained from Bedrocan, The Netherlands and 
used within 6 months of purchase. It was stored on site in 
foil-sealed pouches at -20ºC and then at ambient temperature 
prior to drug administration. Each dose was vaporized using a 
Volcano Medic Vaporizer (Storz and Bickel) at 210ºC in 2 sequen-
tially administered balloons to minimize residual cannabinoids 
(Lawn et al., 2016). Participants inhaled at their own pace (each 
inhalation held for 8 seconds, enforced by the experimenter 
using a stopwatch) until the balloon was empty, which lasted ~5 
minutes for both balloons. All participants complied with this 
administration protocol. Bedrobinol (12% THC, <1% CBD), Bediol 
(6% THC, 7.5% CBD), and placebo cannabis were used to load 
doses of 8 mg THC + 10 mg CBD (Cann+CBD), 8 mg THC (Cann-
CBD), and placebo (Lawn et al., 2016). Placebo cannabis had a 
comparable terpene profile to the 2 active forms of cannabis, 
ensuring it was matched for smell. The same physical quantity 
of cannabis/placebo (133.4mg) was administered across each 
of the 3 sessions. This dose of THC has produced effects on 
brain and behavior in studies with similar vaporizer protocols 
(Bossong et al., 2009; Hindocha et al., 2015; Mokrysz et al., 2016) 
and is roughly equivalent to one-quarter of a standard UK joint 
(Freeman et al., 2014).
Music Task (Menon and Levitin 2005)
Six 21-second excerpts of standard instrumental classical 
music were taken from compact disc recordings, adapted from 
a previous study (Menon and Levitin 2005). Six scrambled ver-
sions were created by randomly drawing 250- to 350-millisec-
ond variable-sized sections from each piece and concatenating 
them with a 30-millisecond linear cross-fade between excerpts 
(Menon and Levitin 2005). Scrambled excerpts retain the same 
distribution of pitch and loudness and the same spectral infor-
mation as normal music. However, they lack temporal structure 
and are rated as less pleasurable than normal excerpts (Menon 
and Levitin 2005).
To deliver clear audio during scanning, clips were adapted 
to improve volume constancy during sections of low volume. 
Output volume was adapted for each participant in the scanner 
before the task commenced. Normal/scrambled excerpts were 
delivered using PsychoPy (Version 1.79.01) through MR com-
patible sensimetric earphones (http://www.sens.com/products/
model-s14/) in a standard blocked fMRI design. The 12 normal/
scrambled excerpts were presented in a pseudo-randomized 
order across the 3 test sessions. Each 21-second excerpt was fol-
lowed by a 1-second interstimulus interval. Next, participants 
rated the pleasantness of each excerpt using a 2-finger response 
pad beneath their right hand (fixed time of 8 seconds). The 
numerical rating scale was anchored from 0 (not at all pleasant) 
to 10 (very pleasant). This was followed by 12 seconds of pas-
sive fixation (rest). The total task time was 8 minutes 24 seconds, 
plus a 5-second end-buffer period.
fMRI Data Acquisition
Imaging data were collected using a Siemens TIM Avanto 1.5T 
scanner, using a 32-channel receive-only head coil, at the 
Birkbeck-UCL Centre for Neuroimaging, London. An automated 
shim procedure was applied to minimize possible magnetic 
field homogeneities. Functional imaging used a multiband 
(acceleration factor 
= 
4) gradient-echo T2*-weighted echo-planar 
imaging (EPI) sequence with 40 slices per volume (TR 
= 
1000 ms; 
TE 
= 
55 ms; in-plane matrix 
= 
64 x 64; 3 mm isotropic voxels; flip 
angle 
= 
75°; bandwidth 
= 
1474 Hz/pixel; 509 volumes). The first 8 
scans were treated as “dummy” scans and discarded to avoid 
T1-equilibrium effects. All scanning parameters were selected 
to optimize the quality of the BOLD signal while maintaining a 
sufficient number of slices to acquire whole-brain data. To co-
register the fMRI data into standard space, we also acquired a 
MPRAGE structural sequence (TR 
= 
2730 ms; TE 
= 
3.57 ms; mat-
rix 
= 
176 x 256 x 256; 1-mm isotropic voxels; flip angle 
= 
7°; 
bandwidth 
= 
190 Hz/pixel; parallel imaging acceleration fac-
tor 
= 
2), and a B0 field map image (64 axial slices; TR 
= 
1170 ms; 
TE1 
= 
10.0 ms; TE2 
= 
14.76 ms; in-plane matrix 
= 
64 x 64; 3 x 3 x 
2 mm voxels; flip angle 
= 
90°; bandwidth 
= 
260 Hz/pixel) to enable 
distortion correction of the functional data.
fMRI Data Analysis
Preprocessing and data analysis were performed using 
Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.
ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/). Standard preprocessing procedures 
consisted of bias correction of EPI images to control for within-
volume signal intensity differences, realignment/unwarping 
to correct for interscan movements, correction for differences 
in slice acquisition timing, and normalization of the images to 
an EPI template specific to our sequence and scanner that was 
aligned to the T1 MNI template. Finally, the normalized func-
tional images were spatially smoothed with an isotropic 8-mm 
FWHM Gaussian kernel.
At the first level, the normal and scrambled epochs were 
each modelled as a 21-second boxcar convolved with the canon-
ical hemodynamic response function combined with time and

dispersion derivatives to create the contrast music>scrambled, 
as previously used with this task (Menon and Levitin 2005). 
The interstimulus interval, rating, and passive fixation (rest) 
were also modelled. Each subject’s movement parameters were 
included as confounds. Low-frequency noise was removed with 
a high-pass filter (cut-off frequency 1/128 Hz). Parameter esti-
mates pertaining to the height of the hemodynamic response 
function for each regressor of interest were then calculated for 
each voxel.
At the second level, the contrast music>scrambled was 
entered into a within-subject ANOVA model with a single fac-
tor of drug (Cann+CBD, Cann-CBD, placebo). Within this ANOVA 
model, we used t contrasts to investigate music>scrambled and 
the reverse contrast (scrambled>music) across all scans. Drug 
effects on music>scrambled were conducted using t contrasts 
within this ANOVA model. To aid interpretation of signifi-
cant drug effects (which could reflect changes in response to 
music, scrambled, or both), separate parameter estimates were 
extracted from these coordinates for the contrasts music>rest 
and scrambled>rest using the MarsBaR region of interest tool-
box; these were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA 
in SPSS.
Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis was per-
formed to assess task-related functional connectivity (O’Reilly 
et al., 2012) using seed regions identified by drug effects. We 
extracted the representative time-course from voxels in the 
seed region (6-mm radius sphere) using the first eigenvari-
ate calculated from singular value composition. This time 
course (physiological) was entered into a General Linear Model 
together with the contrast music>scrambled (psychological) 
and their interaction (PPI). Motion parameters were included in 
first-level models as nuisance regressors. The PPI regressor was 
analyzed using a within-subject ANOVA. We used t contrasts 
to investigate PPI effects across all scans and to compare drug 
effects.
A False Discovery Rate correction (P 
< 
.05) was applied to all 
fMRI analyses. Regions of interest were defined from a previ-
ous meta-analysis of music-evoked reward and emotion (see 
Figure 1 and supplementary Table 1 in Koelsch 2014) using the 
MarsBaR toolbox. Firstly, each of the structures identified in the 
meta-analysis was converted into a single sphere. Coordinates 
were converted to MNI using the Yale BioImage Suite (Lacadie 
et al., 2008). Sphere radius was estimated from the cluster size 
reported in the meta-analysis. Where clusters contained mul-
tiple structures, size was determined using the cluster mean. 
Subthreshold clusters were assigned a default size of 200 mm3. 
Each of these spheres was combined into a single mask that 
was applied to second-level analysis. This mask (41 
240 mm3) 
included bilateral hippocampal formation, bilateral amygdala, 
bilateral auditory cortex, right ventral striatum, left caudate 
nucleus, presupplementary motor area, frontomedian cortex, 
rostral cingulate zone, pre-genual and middle cingulate cortex, 
medial and laterial orbitofrontal cortex, right anterior insula, 
mediodorsal thalamus, and superior parietal lobule.
Behavioral Data Analysis
SPSS version 21 was used to analyze all behavioral data and par-
ameter estimates extracted posthoc using MarsBaR. Outliers 
(>3 times IQR) were winsorized within each session and time 
point. Histograms were used to investigate normality, and 
square root or log transformations were applied where appro-
priate. Trait measures (BDI, Temporal Experiences of Pleasure, 
SDS, and drug history) were missing for one participant. Missing 
data from experimental sessions (0.69% of Numerical Rating 
Scale data, 0.69% of cardiovascular data) were imputed with the 
mean for that session and time point to retain each participant 
in the repeated-measures analysis. Repeated-measures ANOVA 
models were used for all data collected on the 3 experimental 
sessions, including within-subject factors of drug (Cann+CBD, 
Cann-CBD, placebo) and time (Pre-Drug, Post-Drug, Post-Scan) 
or (Post-Drug, Post-Scan) and additional factors where appro-
priate. Posthoc pairwise tests were Bonferroni-corrected locally 
within each ANOVA model. Additional repeated-measures 
ANOVA models were used to aid interpretation of interactions 
where appropriate. The Greenhouse-Geisser correction was 
applied where assumptions of sphericity were violated, with 
degrees of freedom rounded to the nearest integer. To reduce 
type I and type II error rates, correlations with fMRI data were 
collapsed across each of the sessions using mixed effects mod-
els, with a Bonferroni-adjusted α threshold. These accounted for 
fixed effects of drug and session order, with a random intercept 
of participant and maximum likelihood estimation. Equivalent 
mixed effects models were used to assess possible confound-
ing by cardiovascular measures, cannabis use, and session order.
Results
Participants
Seventeen participants completed the study. One participant 
was excluded due to excessive head movement on one session 
(exceeding thresholds for both translation [>6 mm] and rotation 
[>6º]) and was replaced, leaving a final sample of 16. Demographic 
and drug use data are shown in Table 1. The following num-
ber of participants completed each treatment order: Placebo,

Behavioral Results
Subjective Effects
Subjective effects are shown in Figure 2 . A main effect of drug 
(F1,22 
= 
107.659, P 
< 
.001, ηp
2 
= 
0.878) emerged for Feel Drug Effect, 
reflecting increased scores following Cann+CBD (P 
< 
.001) and 
Cann-CBD (P 
< 
.001) compared with placebo, but no differences 
between Cann+CBD and Cann-CBD (P 
= 
1.000). There was also 
a main effect of time, indicating that scores decreased from 
Post-Drug to Post-Scan (F1,15 
= 
19.057, P 
< 
.001, ηp
2 
= 
0.560), but 
there was no evidence for an interaction between drug and 
time (F2, 30 
= 
0.796, P 
= 
.461, ηp
2 
= 
0.050). Like Drug Effect showed 
a similar profile of results. There was a main effect of drug 
(F2,30 
= 
44.371, P 
< 
.001, ηp
2 
= 
0.747), reflecting increased scores fol-
lowing Cann+CBD (P 
< 
.001) and Cann-CBD (P 
< 
.001) compared 
with placebo but no difference between Cann 
+ 
CBD and Cann-
CBD (P 
= 
1.000). There was also a main effect of time, indicating 
that scores decreased from Post-Drug to Post-Scan (F1,15 
= 
19.454, 
P 
< 
.001, ηp
2 
= 
0.565). Again, there was no evidence for an inter-
action between drug and time (F2,30 
= 
0.589, P 
= 
.561, ηp
2 
= 
0.038). 
For Want More Drug, there was no evidence for any effects or 
interactions: drug by time (F2,30 
= 
2.462, P 
= 
.102, ηp
2 
= 
0.141), drug 
(F2,30 
= 
1.329, P 
=

= 
0.081), or Time (F1,15

Cardiovascular Effects
Cardiovascular effects are shown in Figure 2. For heart rate 
(BPM), a drug by time interaction emerged (F2,28 = 18.243, P < .001, 
ηp
2 = 0.549) as well as main effects of both drug (F2,30 = 13.999, 
P < .001, ηp
2 = 0.483) and time (F2,30 = 45.977, P < .001, ηp
2 = 0.754). 
Heart rate increased from Pre-Drug to Post-Drug following 
Cann+CBD (P < .001) and Cann-CBD (P < .001) but not placebo 
(P = .456). It then decreased from Post-Drug to Post-Scan for 
both Cann+CBD (P < .001) and Cann-CBD (P < .001) but did not 
change on placebo (P = 1.000). When comparing the 2 types of 
cannabis alone, there were no differences between the effects of 
Cann+CBD and Cann-CBD on heart rate across the 3 time points 
(drug by time interaction: F2,30 = 0.123, P = .885, ηp
2 = 0.008; main 
effect of drug: F1,15 = 0.090, P = .768, ηp
2 = 0.006, main effect of time: 
F2,30 = 87.391, P < .001, ηp
2 = 0.854). For systolic blood pressure, a 
main effect of drug was found (F2,30 = 6.297, P = .005, ηp
2 = 0.296). 
This reflected increased blood pressure for both Cann+CBD 
(P = .030) and Cann-CBD (P = .006), compared with placebo, but 
no differences between Cann+CBD and Cann-CBD (P = 1.000). 
There was no evidence for an interaction between drug and

time (F4,60 = 0.953, P = .440, ηp
2 = 0.060) or a main effect of time 
(F2,30 = 2.641, P = .088, ηp
2 = 0.150). For diastolic blood pressure, 
an interaction between drug and time was found (F4,60 = 3.217, 
P = .019, ηp
2 = 0.177) and a main effect of time (F2,30 = 7.702, P = .002, 
ηp
2 = 0.339) but not drug (F2,30 = 2.975, P = .066, ηp
2 = 0.165). Diastolic 
blood pressure increased from Pre-Drug to Post-Drug for Cann-
CBD (P < .001) but not Cann+CBD (P = .233) or placebo (P = 1.000). 
It then increased from Post-Drug to Post-Scan following placebo 
(P = .030) but not Cann-CBD (P = 1.000) or Cann+CBD (P = 1.000).
Subjective Music Ratings
Subjective music ratings are shown in Figure 3. For Want to 
Listen to Music, we found a drug by time interaction (F4,60 
= 
5.256, 
P 
= 
.001, ηp
2 
= 
0.259) and main effects of drug (F2,30 
= 
5.664, P 
= 
.008, 
ηp
2 
= 
0.274) and time (F1,22 
= 
6.300, P 
= 
.012, ηp
2 
= 
0.296). Scores 
increased from Pre-Drug to Post-Drug following Cann+CBD 
(P 
< 
.001) and Cann-CBD (P 
= 
.002) but not placebo (P 
= 
1.000). 
Scores then decreased from Post-Drug to Post-Scan on Cann+CBD 
(P 
= 
.028), but these tests did not reach significance for Cann-
CBD (P 
= 
.553) or placebo (P 
= 
.199). However, analysis of all three 
drug conditions suggested that the decrease in Want to Listen 
to Music from Post-Drug to Post-Scan was equivalent across 
the 3 sessions (drug by time interaction: F1,21 
= 
1.130, P 
= 
.321, 
ηp
2 
= 
0.070; main effect of drug: F2,30

main effect of time: F1,15 
= 
7.164, P

.017, ηp
2 
= 
0.323). Moreover, 
when comparing the 2 types of cannabis alone, there were no 
differences between the effects of Cann+CBD and Cann-CBD on 
Want to Listen to Music across the 3 time points (drug by time 
interaction: F2,30 
= 
0.804, P 
= 
.457, ηp

= 
0.051; main effect of drug:

= 
8.251, 
P 
= 
.001, ηp
2 
= 
0.355).
For Enhanced Sound Perception, Pre-Drug scores were 
removed from analysis due to floor effects on each session. Mean 
(SD) values were 0.25 (0.45) on placebo, 0.00 (0.00) on Cann+CBD, 
and 0.00 (0.00) on Cann-CBD. Analysis of variance was there-
fore restricted to 2 time points (Post-Drug, Post-Scan). A main 
effect of drug (F2,30 = 
44.810, P 
< 
.001, ηp
2 = 
0.749) reflected increased 
scores from placebo following Cann+CBD (P 
< 
.001) and Cann-
CBD (P 
< 
.001) and higher scores following Cann+CBD compared 
with Cann-CBD (P 
= 
.015). There was no evidence for an inter-
action between drug and time (F2,30 = 
2.056, P 
= 
.146, ηp
2 = 
0.121) or 
a main effect of time (F1,15 = 
1.248, P 
= 
.281, ηp
2 = 
0.077). Finally, we 
analyzed trial-by-trial pleasure ratings, recorded immediately 
after listening to classical music and scrambled sound excerpts 
during MRI scanning. There was a main effect of excerpt 
(F1,15 = 
133.860, P 
< 
.001, ηp
2 = 
0.899), indicating that music was rated 
as more pleasant than scrambled sound. However, there was no 
evidence for a main effect of drug (F2,30 = 
1.205, P 
= 
.314, ηp
2 = 
0.074) 
or a drug by excerpt interaction (F2,30 = 
1.221, P 
= 
.309, ηp
2 = 
0.075). 
Next, we calculated a pleasure rating score (music>scrambled) 
equivalent to our fMRI contrast of interest to provide compar-
able metrics for brain and behavior. Mean (SD) pleasure rating 
scores were 5.16 (2.27) for Cann+CBD, 4.78 (2.03) for Cann-CBD, 
and 5.53 (1.99) for placebo. Analysis of these scores provided no 
evidence for an effect of drug (F2,30 = 
1.221, P 
= 
.309, ηp
2 = 
0.075).
fMRI Results
Main Effect of Task
All fMRI analyses were conducted among regions of inter-
est selected from a meta-analysis of previous studies (Koelsch 
2014). Across all sessions, listening to music elicited activation 
in bilateral amygdala, bilateral striatum, left hippocampus, and 
left cingulate gyrus (see Table 2). For completion, we also exam-
ined the reverse contrast (scrambled>music), which revealed 
activation in bilateral auditory cortex (see Table 2).
Drug Effects 
Response to music>scrambled was greater on placebo compared 
with Cann-CBD in bilateral auditory cortex, right hippocam-
pus/parahippocampal gyrus, right ventral striatum, and right 
amygdala (see Table 2 and Figure 4). There was no evidence for 
any differences when comparing Cann+CBD with placebo or 
Cann+CBD with Cann-CBD.
To aid interpretation of these findings (which may have been 
driven by drug effects on music, scrambled sound, or both), we 
extracted parameter estimates from each of the clusters iden-
tified in this drug effect (Table 2, bottom panel) for separate 
contrasts of music>rest and scrambled>rest. ANOVA revealed 
an interaction between drug (placebo, Cann-CBD) and contrast 
(music>rest, scrambled>rest) (F1,15 = 
37.851, P 
< 
.001, ηp
2 = 
0.716). 
This interaction indicated that relative to placebo, Cann-CBD 
decreased parameter estimates for music>rest (P 
= 
.009, mean 
difference -0.195, standard error 0.065). However, there was no 
evidence for drug effects on scrambled>rest (P 
= 
.130, mean dif-
ference 0.103, standard error 0.064). There were no other findings 
involving drug (drug by contrast by region interaction: F4,60 = 
0.687, 
P 
= 
.604, ηp
2 = 
0.044; drug by region interaction: F4,60 = 
0.919, P 
= 
.459, 
ηp
2 = 
0.058; main effect of drug: F1,15 = 
0.585, P 
= 
.456, ηp
2 = 
0.038). 
This suggests that Cann-CBD dampened response to music to a 
similar extent across each of these regions (right auditory cor-
tex, left auditory cortex, right hippocampus/parahippocampal 
gyrus, right ventral striatum, and right amygdala) while having 
negligible effects on response to scrambled sound.

relationship between pleasure ratings and response to music 
in right ventral striatum (F1,34 = 11.447, P = .002; Figure 5). The 
same relationship was found using a Pearson correlation ana-
lysis across all scans (r = 0.463, P = .001). This correlation did not 
contain any outlying values (all data points were <3 times the 
interquartile range). However, there was still evidence for a cor-
relation after excluding the 2 data points showing the highest 
and lowest right ventral striatum response to music (mixed 
effects model: F1,41 = 4.438, P = .041; Pearson correlation analysis 
r = 0.318, P = .032).
Functional Connectivity
Previous research has shown that the rewarding experience of 
music is predicted by increased functional connectivity between 
right ventral striatum and auditory cortex (Salimpoor et al., 2013; 
Zatorre and Salimpoor 2013; Martínez-Molina et al., 2016). To test 
this, we conducted PPI analyses. These analyses were conducted 
posthoc, informed by our findings that Cann-CBD blunted partic-
ipants’ response to music in right ventral striatum and auditory 
cortex. Within-subjects ANOVA revealed that across all sessions, 
the right ventral striatum region (15, 15, -12) identified in our ana-
lysis showed a robust increase in functional connectivity with 
bilateral auditory cortex (and to a lesser extent, right caudate) 
during music relative to scrambled sound (Table 3). For comple-
tion, we conducted the reverse contrast. However, we found no 
evidence for any regions showing reduced connectivity with this 
region during music relative scrambled sound. Next, we exam-
ined drug effects using t contrasts. Compared with Cann-CBD, 
greater functional connectivity occurred on Cann+CBD between 
right ventral striatum and bilateral auditory cortex (Table 3; 
Figure 6). We also conducted a PPI analysis using an auditory cor-
tex seed (right superior temporal gyrus 51, -27, 6). However, this 
PPI analysis did not identify any regions that showed increases 
in functional connectivity with the seed region.
Possible Confounding
Cardiovascular Drug Effects
We conducted correlations between all Post-Drug cardiovascu-
lar measures (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) 
and the 9 clusters showing evidence of drug effects (see Tables 
2 and 3) across all sessions (total 27 correlations). We found no 
evidence for any association between cardiovascular and fMRI 
data (all P 
> 
.05).
Cannabis Use
We also explored correlations between levels of cannabis of use 
and our main findings. These were conducted between (1) years 
of cannabis use, (2) days of cannabis use per month and the 9 
clusters showing evidence of drug effects (Tables 2 and 3), Want 
to Listen to Music (Post-Drug), Enhanced Sound Perception (Post-
Drug), and pleasure rating scores. Of the 24 correlations, we found

no evidence for any associations (all P 
> 
.05) apart from a trend 
negative correlation between years of cannabis use and functional 
connectivity between right ventral striatum and left hippocampus 
(F1,48 
= 
4.984, P 
= 
.030). However, this did not reach significance at a 
Bonferroni-corrected threshold (α 
= 
0.0021). Moreover, the effect of 
drug remained significant in this model (F1,48 
= 
7.455, P 
= 
.002).
Order Effects
Because the same music and scrambled sound excerpts were 
presented across each of the 3 sessions, we investigated pos-
sible order effects. For all fMRI results showing drug effects, the 
effect of drug remained significant, and there was no evidence 
for an effect of session order (all P 
> 
.05). There was no evidence 
for effects of drug or session order for pleasure rating scores 
(all P 
> 
.05). Analysis of Want to Listen to Music (Post-Drug) and 
Enhanced Sound Perception (Post-Drug) scores showed effects 
of drug (both P 
< 
.001) but not session (both P 
> 
.05).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first controlled experiment inves-
tigating the interactive effects of cannabis and music. Cannabis 
dampened response to music in several regions implicated in 
music-evoked reward and emotion (Koelsch 2014): bilateral audi-
tory cortex, right amygdala, right hippocampus/parahippocam-
pal gyrus, and right ventral striatum. Across all scans we found 
a positive correlation between response to music in this ventral 
striatal region and the pleasure of listening to the same sound 
clips, consistent with several studies implicating the ventral stri-
atum in musical pleasure (Blood and Zatorre 2001; Koelsch et al., 
2006; Salimpoor et al., 2011; Trost et al., 2012). The same ventral 
striatal region showed increased task-related functional con-
nectivity with bilateral auditory cortex, an effect that has pre-
viously been shown to predict musical reward value (Salimpoor 
et al., 2013; Zatorre and Salimpoor 2013; Martínez-Molina et al., 
2016).
These findings were contrary to our prediction that cannabis 
would increase the rewarding effects of music, which can acti-
vate and increase connectivity within mesolimbic brain regions 
(Blood and Zatorre 2001; Menon and Levitin 2005; Koelsch et al., 
2006; Salimpoor et al., 2011; Trost et al., 2012) and, in common 
with THC, may increase striatal dopamine release (Salimpoor et 
al., 2011; Bossong et al., 2015). Moreover, observational data sug-
gests that cannabis is frequently used in the context of music 
and may enhance its effects (Tart 1970; Green et al., 2003; Lim et 
al., 2008; Van Havere et al., 2011; Palamar et al., 2015).
One possible explanation for our findings is that THC inter-
fered with the endocannabinoid system, which plays a critical 
role in reward processing (Parsons and Hurd 2015). For example, 
acute THC may deplete the CB1R ligand anandamide (Thieme 
et al., 2014), which increases consummatory response to reward 
in the nucleus accumbens shell (Mahler et al., 2007). Disruption 
of the endocannabinoid system could explain why neural 
response to reward was previously dampened by 7-day admin-
istration of a CB1R antagonist (Horder et al., 2010) as well as a 
single dose of the partial CB1R agonist THC (van Hell et al., 2012). 
It should also be noted that our findings of dampened response 
to music occurred in the context of increased wanting to listen 
to music. These findings are broadly consistent with previous 
findings that THC may have dissociable effects on anticipatory 
(“wanting”) and consummatory (“liking”) components of reward 
(van Hell et al., 2012; Jansma et al., 2013), although our task 
lacked a neural index of reward anticipation.
Cannabis with CBD did not differ from placebo on any fMRI 
measures. Furthermore, it resulted in greater task-related 
functional connectivity between ventral striatum and audi-
tory cortex compared with cannabis without CBD. These find-
ings suggest that CBD was able to offset some effects of THC, 
consistent with previous research (Curran et al., 2016; Englund 
et al., 2017) and evidence that THC and CBD can have opposite 
neural effects (Bhattacharyya et al., 2010; Batalla et al., 2014). For 
example, activation in right superior temporal gyrus (a region 
identified in our study) during word listening relative to rest was 
previously found to be decreased by THC but increased by CBD 
(Winton-Brown et al., 2011). Moreover, CBD may increase con-
centrations of anandamide (Bisogno et al., 2001; Leweke et al., 
2012). We found some evidence that CBD interacted with THC 
on additional measures. Taken together, CBD appeared to par-
tially offset some negative effects of THC (increase in diastolic 
blood pressure, decreased response to music) while preserving

or potentiating desirable ones (enhanced sound perception, 
functional connectivity with ventral striatum during musical 
listening).
In terms of clinical implications, the effects of acute can-
nabis administration here are similar to previous findings in 
people with depression, who also show a blunted response to 
music in ventral striatum as well as medial orbitofrontal cortex 
(Osuch et al., 2009). In this respect, acute cannabis administra-
tion may transiently mimic the diminished response to reward 
characteristic of some mental health disorders. The impact of 
chronic cannabis administration remains unclear. However, a 
4-year prospective study found that increased cannabis use 
was associated with subsequent reductions in ventral striatal 
response to reward anticipation (Martz et al., 2016). It there-
fore is possible that effects of cannabis on reward processing 
may contribute to an increased risk of developing depression 
(Zhang et al., 2013; Lev-Ran et al., 2014) as well as other disor-
ders characterized by reward dysfunction such as addiction and 
psychosis (Radua et al., 2015; Luijten et al., 2017). Moreover, our 
findings support the potential utility of CBD in reducing can-
nabis harms while maintaining the positive effects users seek 
(Englund et al., 2017).
Strengths of this study include its controlled experimen-
tal design, comparison of cannabis with and without CBD (but 
matched for THC), a music task previously validated using fMRI 
(Menon and Levitin 2005), and regions of interest informed by 
meta-analysis (Koelsch, 2014). Our sample size was equivalent 
or larger than previous studies with comparable designs (van 
Hell et al., 2012; Jansma et al., 2013) and neuroimaging music 
studies of music (mean n = 14.5 across 22 studies (Koelsch 
2014)). We used a fixed set of classical music excerpts, com-
mensurate with previous use of this task (Menon and Levitin, 
2005) and many other studies (Koelsch, 2014). Advantages of 
this approach include the absence of lyrics (which would influ-
ence neural response due to speech) and ease of comparison 
with existing data. Although participants rated classical sound 
clips as highly pleasant (~7.5 of 10), results may have differed if 
preferred music was preselected by participants (Osuch et al., 
2009). Drug order was not completely balanced in this study, 
and the same sound clips were presented on each of the 3 ses-
sions. However, we found no evidence that session order influ-
enced our results. We screened for personal/family history of 
psychosis and current treatment for a psychiatric disorder, 
but not for lifetime history of other mental health problems. 
Additionally, our sample were cannabis users, which may have 
prolonged cannabinoid clearance between sessions. However, 
we found minimal evidence for associations between cannabis 
use and fMRI findings, and their response to cannabinoids may 
be more representative of typical use than healthy volunteers 
who never use cannabis.
In conclusion, cannabis dampened the effects of music in 
bilateral auditory cortex, right hippocampus/parahippocam-
pal gyrus, right amygdala, and right ventral striatum. During 
musical listening, this ventral striatal region correlated with 
pleasure ratings and showed increased functional connectivity 
with auditory cortex. By contrast, cannabis containing canna-
bidiol did not influence the effects of music in brain regions sen-
sitive to reward and emotion.
