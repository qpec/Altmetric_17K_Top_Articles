BACKGROUND: In 2016, the Microsimulation Screening Analysis-Colon (MISCAN-Colon) model was used to inform the US Preventive Services
T
ask Force colorectal cancer (CRC) screening guidelines. In this study, 1 of 2 microsimulation analyses to inform the update of the American Can-
cer Society CRC screening guideline, the authors re-evaluated the optimal screening strategies in light of the increase in CRC diagnosed in young
adults. METHODS: The authors adjusted the MISCAN-Colon model to reflect the higher CRC incidence in young adults, who were
assumed to carry forward escalated disease risk as they age. Life-years gained (LYG; benefit), the number of colonoscopies (COL;
burden) and the ratios of incremental burden to benefit (efficiency ratio [ER] 5 DCOL/DLYG) were projected for different screening
strategies. Strategies differed with respect to test modality, ages to start (40 years, 45 years, and 50 years) and ages to stop (75
years, 80 years, and 85 years) screening, and screening intervals (depending on screening modality). The authors then determined
the model-recommended strategies in a similar way as was done for the US Preventive Services Task Force, using ER thresholds in
accordance with the previously accepted ER of 39. RESULTS: Because of the higher CRC incidence, model-predicted LYG from
screening increased compared with the previous analyses. Consequently, the balance of burden to benefit of screening improved and
now 10-yearly colonoscopy screening starting at age 45 years resulted in an ER of 32. Other recommended strategies included fecal
immunochemical testing annually, flexible sigmoidoscopy screening every 5 years, and computed tomographic colonography every 5
years. CONCLUSIONS: This decision-analysis suggests that in light of the increase in CRC incidence among young adults, screening
may be offered earlier than has previously been recommended. Cancer 2018;124:2964-73. V

INTRODUCTION
It is estimated that in 2018, > 50,000 colorectal cancer (CRC) deaths will occur in the United States,1 making CRC the
second most common cause of cancer death in men and women combined.2 CRC death often can be prevented by CRC
screening,3 which is recommended from ages 50 years to 75 years by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)
and the American Cancer Society (ACS).4,5 For the population as a whole, CRC incidence and mortality have been
declining for several decades, much of which is attributed to an increase in CRC screening uptake.2 However, in adults
aged <50 years among whom screening currently is not routinely recommended for those at average risk, CRC incidence

 has been increasing since the mid-1990s.6-11 Based on
national data, CRC now is the most commonly diagnosed
cancer and the most common cause of cancer death in
American men aged <50 years.12,13
In the recently updated USPSTF guidelines,4
screening was recommended to begin at age 50 years,
despite the fact that 2 of 3 colorectal microsimulation
models of the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance
Modeling Network (CISNET) suggested that starting
screening at age 45 years provided a more favorable bal-
ance between the benefits and burden of screening com-
pared with starting at age 50 years.14 As described in the
USPSTF recommendation statement, reasons for not
lowering the recommended age to start screening were the
lack of agreement between all 3 CISNET models and the
limited empirical data related to screening before age 50
years.4 However, accumulating evidence has demon-
strated a persistent increase in CRC incidence in adults
aged <50 years.2,6 Although the elevated background risk
likely will be carried forward with these generations as
they age due to the cohort effect,6 it is unlikely that it will
be observed in CRC incidence data for those aged �55
years because it is counteracted by the increased uptake of
screening in those ages.
The CISNET microsimulation models that were used
to inform the 2016 USPSTF CRC screening guidelines
were calibrated to CRC incidence rates from the Surveil-
lance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program reg-
istries during 1975 through 1979.14 This time frame was
chosen because there was little CRC screening in this period.
As a result, these models did not account for the recent
increase in CRC incidence in individuals aged <50 years.
Therefore, at the request of the ACS, we re-evaluated the
optimal age to start screening, age to stop screening, and the
screening interval incorporating contemporary trends in
young adults to inform the update of the ACS CRC screen-
ing guideline.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We used the Microsimulation Screening Analysis-Colon
(MISCAN-Colon) model to evaluate the optimal age to
start screening, age to stop screening, and screening interval.
First, we adjusted the model to reflect the increased CRC
incidence in more recent birth cohorts. Second, the benefits
and harms of the different screening strategies were pre-
dicted. Third, the balance between the benefits and the bur-
den of screening was used to select model-recommended
strategies. The methods used for these steps are described in
the section below. Analyses were similar to those performed
to inform USPSTF guideline recommendations (see Sup-
porting Table 1 for a summary of all differences).14
MISCAN-Colon
The MISCAN-Colon model used in this study was devel-
oped by the Department of Public Health within Erasmus
University Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Nether-
lands, and has been described in detail elsewhere.15,16 It is
part of CISNET, a consortium of cancer decision model-
ers sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). In
brief, the model generates, with random variation, the
individual life histories for a large cohort to simulate the
US population in terms of life expectancy and cancer risk.
Each simulated person ages over time and may develop
�1 adenomas that can progress from small (�5 mm) to
medium (6-9 mm) to large (�10 mm) in size. Some ade-
nomas develop into preclinical cancer, which may pro-
gress through stages I to IV. During each disease
transition point, CRC may be diagnosed because of symp-
toms. Survival after clinical diagnosis is determined by the
stage at diagnosis, the location of the cancer, and the per-
son’s age. Some simulated life histories are altered by
screening through the detection and removal of adenomas
or diagnosing CRC in an earlier stage, resulting in a better
prognosis. Screening also results in high rates of detection
and removal (overtreatment) of polyps, the majority of
which would not progress to invasive disease, and may
result in fatal complications from colonoscopy with poly-
pectomy,15,17,18 all of which are considered in the model.
Model incorporation of increase in CRC incidence
The original MISCAN-Colon model was calibrated to
CRC incidence in 1975-1979. To incorporate the
increased CRC incidence in recent birth cohorts, we
adjusted the model based on the observed increase since
that period as estimated by Siegel et al.6 Age-period-
cohort modeling of SEER data performed by Siegel et al
revealed that the increase in CRC incidence currently is
confined to ages <55 years and primarily is the result of a
strong birth cohort effect that began in those born in the
1950s. Consequently, these and subsequent generations
will carry forward escalated disease risk as they age.6
Affected cohorts are only now reaching the age to initiate
screening, which will likely somewhat counteract the
trend. In our analyses, we simulated a cohort of adults
aged 40 years in 2015, and assumed that this cohort had a
1.591-fold increased CRC incidence across all ages com-
pared with the original model. This incidence multiplier
was based on the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for CRC of
the 1935 birth cohort (those aged 40 years in 1975)

 compared with the 1975 birth cohort (those aged 40 years
in 2015).19 In accordance with the data, we assumed that
the increase in CRC incidence was mostly confined to an
increase in tumors in the rectum and the distal colon.6 In
the base case analysis, we assumed that the increase in
CRC incidence was caused by a higher prevalence of ade-
nomas. In a sensitivity analysis, we explored how our
results differed with the alternative assumption of stable
adenoma prevalence, but faster progression to malignancy.
Screening Strategies
Six screening modalities were evaluated: 1) colonoscopy;
2)
fecal
immunochemical
testing
(FIT);
3)
high-
sensitivity
guaiac-based
fecal
occult
blood
testing
(HSgFOBT); 4) multitarget stool DNA testing (FIT-
DNA); 5) flexible sigmoidoscopy (SIG); and 6) computed
tomographic colonography (CTC). Multiple ages to
begin and stop screening and multiple screening intervals
were evaluated for each modality (Table 1). Test charac-
teristics are described by Knudsen et al,14 and are pre-
sented in Supporting Table 2. A 40-year-old US cohort
free of CRC was simulated, thereby only evaluating the
effect of the different screening strategies in a population
of individuals to whom the screening guidelines for
average-risk individuals apply. These 40-year-olds were
assumed to have a 100% adherence to screening, follow-
up, and surveillance.20
The benefit of screening was measured by the num-
ber of life-years gained (LYG) from the screening strategy,
and corrected for life-years lost due to screening complica-
tions. The number of required colonoscopies was used as
a measure of the aggregate burden of screening, and
included colonoscopies for screening, follow-up, surveil-
lance, and the diagnosis of symptomatic cancer. Because
this measure of burden does not capture the burden of
other screening modalities, direct comparisons of the ben-
efit and burden across screening strategies were limited to
those with similar noncolonoscopy burden. Therefore,
only the stool-based tests were grouped, which resulted in
4 classes of screening modalities: 1) colonoscopy; 2) stool-
based modalities (FIT, HSgFOBT, and FIT-DNA); 3)
SIG; and 4) CTC.
Efficient and Near-Efficient Screening
Strategies
The LYG and colonoscopy burden were plotted for each
screening strategy by class of screening modalities. Strate-
gies providing the largest incremental increase in LYG per
additional colonoscopy were connected, thereby compos-
ing the efficient frontier. All strategies on the efficient
frontier were considered efficient screening options,21
whereas others fell below the frontier and were domi-
nated. Weakly dominated strategies that had LYG within
98% of the efficient frontier were defined as near-
efficient; other strategies below the efficient frontier were
considered inefficient. For efficient and near-efficient
strategies, the incremental number of colonoscopies
(DCOL), the incremental number of LYG (DLYG), and
the efficiency ratio (ER) (DCOL/DLYG) relative to the
next less effective efficient strategy were calculated.
Model-Recommended Screening Strategies
A predefined algorithm was used to select model-
recommended screening strategies (Fig. 1).14 First, the
efficient frontier for the colonoscopy strategies was gener-
ated (step 1), after which a benchmark colonoscopy
screening strategy was selected that 1) was an efficient or
near-efficient colonoscopy screening strategy, 2) had LYG
no less than the previously recommended colonoscopy

a The number of unique strategies excluded the strategies that overlap (eg, colonoscopy every 10 years from ages 50 to 80 years and from ages 50 to 85
years both include colonoscopies at ages 50, 60, 70, and 80 years and therefore are not unique strategies).

 every 10 years from ages 50 to 75 years, and 3) had an effi-
ciency ratio (ER 5 DCOL/DLYG) of � 40, 45, or 50
incremental colonoscopies per LYG (step 2). We decided
to evaluate different ER thresholds in liaison with recom-
mendations for cost-effectiveness analysis, for which it is
recommended to evaluate multiple willingness-to-pay
thresholds.22 We analyzed ER thresholds of 40, 45, and
50, in accordance with the efficiency ratio for the
MISCAN-Colon model in the USPSTF analyses, in
which 39 was considered an acceptable number of colo-
noscopies per LYG and 114 was not, suggesting the
threshold of an acceptable number of colonoscopies per
LYG was in-between those values.14
Next, the start age and stop age of screening were
fixed at those of the colonoscopy benchmark strategy
(step 3), because different start ages and stop ages for dif-
ferent screening modalities are not easy to implement in
practice because this may complicate the communication
between physicians and patients. Simplifying a regimen
has been shown to be an important intervention to
increase patient adherence,23 and therefore recommend-
ing different start ages or stop ages for the different
screening modalities may result in lower participation.
For the noncolonoscopy screening modalities, within-
class efficient frontiers were created, with the same start
age and stop age as the benchmark colonoscopy strategy
(step 4), and selected were 1) efficient or near-efficient
strategies that 2) had at least 90% of the LYG compared
with the benchmark colonoscopy strategy and 3) had
ERs lower than the benchmark colonoscopy strategy
(step 5). Among all strategies within a class of screening
modality fulfilling all the above criteria, only the most
effective strategies were recommended by the model
(step 6).
Assumptions Evaluated in the Sensitivity
Analyses
Three major assumptions were made that potentially
influenced the results, which therefore were explored in
the sensitivity analyses. First, as mentioned above, we
assumed that the increase in CRC incidence was caused
by an increase in adenoma onset in our primary analyses.
Therefore, we explored faster adenoma progression to
malignancy in a sensitivity analysis. Second, we assumed
that the 1975 birth cohort will carry forward the increased
CRC incidence as they age. Therefore, we increased inci-
dence only <age 50 years in a sensitivity analysis. Third,
we used an IRR of 1.591 because this is applicable to the
1975 birth cohort. Incidence rate ratios of 1.2, 1.3. . . 2.3
and 2.4 were explored in a sensitivity analysis, with higher
ratios being potentially informative for more recent birth
cohorts.
RESULTS
A total of 132 unique screening strategies were evaluated
(Table 1). The CRC deaths averted per 1000 40-year-olds
ranged from 25 for triennial HSgFOBT from ages 50 to
75 years to 40 for colonoscopy every 5 years from ages 40
to 85 years (Supporting Table 3). The lifetime number of
colonoscopies per 1000 40-year-olds, used as a measure of
burden, ranged from 1433 for triennial FIT screening
from ages 50 to 75 years to 8671 for colonoscopy every 5
years from ages 40 to 85 years, whereas the number of
LYG compared with no screening, used to measure bene-
fit, ranged from 284 for triennial HSgFOBT from ages 50

 to 75 years to 475 for colonoscopy every 5 years from ages
40 to 85 years (see Supporting Table 3).
Efficient and Near-Efficient Screening
Strategies
The LYG compared with the number of colonoscopies
required and the efficient frontier for the colonoscopy
strategies are presented in Figure 2. Nine efficient and 5
near-efficient (LYG within 98% of the efficient frontier)
colonoscopy strategies were identified, in which the ERs
(incremental burden-to-benefits ratios) for the colonos-
copy strategies ranged from 11 colonoscopies per LYG for
screening every 15 years from ages 50 to 75 years to 569
for colonoscopy screening every 5 years from ages 40 to
85 years (see Supporting Table 4). The current colonos-
copy screening recommendation (screening every 10 years
from ages 50-75 years) was 1 of the 9 efficient strategies
and had an ER of 23. The plots of the other screening
modalities can be found in Supporting Information Fig-
ures 1 to 3. Twenty-two of 25 stool-based strategies in or
near the efficient frontier were FIT strategies, demonstrat-
ing that FIT screening largely dominated the other stool-
based strategies (Supporting Fig. 1).
Model-Recommended Strategies
The colonoscopy strategy recommended by the model
was screening every 10 years from ages 45 to 75 years with
an ER of 32 incremental colonoscopies per LYG (Table
2). This strategy was selected because it was on the effi-
cient frontier and had the highest number of LYG among
the strategies with ERs <40 and 45. Compared with the
current recommendation (screening every 10 years from
ages 50-75 years), this strategy resulted in 25 (16.2%)
additional LYG accompanied by an increase in 810
(117%) colonoscopies per 1000 40-year-olds.
Class-specific efficient frontiers for strategies other
than colonoscopy were created, including only those strat-
egies with the same start age and stop age as the bench-
mark colonoscopy strategy (Table 2). Per screening class,
1 screening strategy was in or near the efficient frontier,
had an ER smaller than the benchmark colonoscopy strat-
egy, and had at least 90% of the LYG from the benchmark
strategy, thereby fulfilling the criteria to be recommended
by the model. In addition to colonoscopy screening every
10 years, our model recommended FIT screening annu-
ally, SIG every 5 years, and CTC every 5 years from ages
45 to 75 years (Table 2).
With an ER threshold of 50, screening was recom-
mended from ages 40 to 75 years by colonoscopy every
10 years, FIT every year, SIG every 5 years, and CTC
every 5 years (Supporting Table 5). Irrespective of the
ER threshold, no HSgFOBT and FIT-DNA strategies
were recommended. HSgFOBT strategies were not on
the efficient frontier and for the few efficient FIT-DNA
strategies that were, the ER was higher than the colonos-
copy benchmark.
Sensitivity Analyses
As shown in Table 3, alternative assumptions that were
explored in the sensitivity analyses influenced the model
recommendations. First, when the increased CRC inci-
dence was incorporated as faster adenoma progression to
malignancy rather than higher adenoma onset, the model

 suggested to start screening at age 40 years for all ER
thresholds. Second, if the assumed higher CRC incidence
was confined to ages <50 years, colonoscopy screening
every 10 years from ages 50 to 75 years resulted in the low-
est ER: 40.7. The model recommended starting screening
at age 40 years by colonoscopy every 10 years with ER
thresholds of 45 and 50. Finally, model-recommended
strategies depended on the level of increase in CRC inci-
dence. The start age for colonoscopy decreased as IRRs
increased. With an ER threshold of 45, the optimal age to
start screening remained at age 50 years for IRRs < 1.3,
whereas the optimal age to start screening was decreased
to age 40 years with an IRR of �1.7. The first and second
alternative assumption did not influence the stopping age
nor the screening interval, but stopping age and/or inter-
val were influenced by some of the more extreme IRRs.
DISCUSSION
The results of the current analyses suggest that screening
initiation at age 45 years has a favorable balance between
screening benefits and burden based on the increase in
CRC incidence in young adults. For current 40-year-olds,
the model recommends screening every 10 years with
colonoscopy, every year with FIT, every 5 years with SIG,
or every 5 years with CTC from ages 45 to 75 years. The
model-recommended start age depended on the ER
threshold that was applied; when 50 colonoscopies per
LYG was used as a threshold, the model recommended
starting screening at age 40 years.
The results of the current study were sensitive for
alternative assumptions regarding the magnitude and eti-
ology of the increase in CRC incidence in young adults;
however, the model recommended starting screening
before age 50 years, often even at age 40 years, in the
majority of alternative scenarios. Thus, the model recom-
mendation of screening initiation at age 45 years appears
robust and may even be conservative. Close monitoring of
the developments in CRC incidence is required to inform
future guidelines because incidence is increasing with each
subsequent birth cohort.6
To our knowledge, the current study is the first
study that incorporates the recent increase in CRC inci-
dence, especially for rectal and distal colon cancer, in a
decision-analytic modeling approach to assess CRC
screening. Our estimated benefits of screening, which
resulted in
decreased incremental burden-to-benefit
ratios, were much higher compared with the analysis per-
formed to inform the USPSTF guidelines.14 For example,
the LYG and ERs for screening every 10 years by colonos-
copy from ages 50 to 75 years were 248 and 39 for the
USPSTF analysis, versus 404 and 23 in this analysis. In
addition, in contrast to the analysis performed for the
USPSTF, SIG screening every 5 years was recommended
by the model. This likely can be attributed to the higher
percentage of tumors in the rectum and the distal colon.
The only other difference between the current model and
the one used for USPSTF was the update of the lifetable
from 2009 to 2012, which did not meaningfully influence
findings (data not shown).
The ER of colonoscopy screening every 10 years
from ages 45 to 75 years in our analysis was 32, a lower
ratio of incremental burden to benefit than the ER of the
model-recommended
colonoscopy
strategy
in
the
USPSTF analysis. In contrast to the USPSTF analysis,
this analysis to inform the ACS was only performed by 1
of the 3 CISNET models. However, the other 2 CISNET
models already suggested that starting screening at age 45
years was preferred in the analysis for the USPSTF, in
which the higher risk was not incorporated, albeit with a
15-year interval for colonoscopy screening.14

Colonoscopy strategies are described by age at which to start screening/
age to stop screening/screening interval. ER thresholds of 40, 45, and 50
colonoscopies per life-year gained were evaluated.
a In our base case analyses, we assumed an IRR of 1.591 and we assumed
that the higher incidence was caused by an increase in adenoma onset
instead of faster adenoma progression. Furthermore, we assumed that the
current generation of 40-year-old individuals will carry forward escalated
disease risk as they age.
b 50/75/10 had an ER of 40.7; it was the strategy with the lowest ER among
the strategies that met the life-year gained criterion.

 Decision models are a useful tool with which to
inform screening guidelines because they can extrapolate
evidence and predict long-term outcomes of numerous
screening strategies. Decision modeling is an important
component within the context of all scientific evidence
that is taken into consideration when screening guidelines
are evaluated. Since the USPSTF recommendations, com-
pelling empirical data from Siegel et al6 have demon-
strated that the increase in CRC incidence is primarily the
result of a strong birth cohort effect, which fueled debate
regarding the age of screening initiation. This debate trig-
gered reanalysis of the optimal age to begin and end
screening and the screening interval that CISNET models
performed earlier for the USPSTF. Taken together,
empirical data and modeling now suggest that screening
should be started at an earlier age for those at average risk
of disease. Our model recommendation to start screening
at age 45 years instead of age 50 years is driven solely by
the assumed increase in CRC disease burden. A study by
Murphy et al suggested that the increase in CRC inci-
dence in younger ages is likely caused by an increase in
colonoscopy use rather than an increase in disease burden,
based in part on stable CRC mortality rates.24 It is impor-
tant to note that Murphy et al presented mortality data
from 1992 through 2013 and did not systematically quan-
tify recent trends. Race-specific examination of CRC
mortality from 1970 to 2014 among individuals aged 20
to 49 years by Siegel et al demonstrated that although
CRC mortality is decreasing in blacks, it actually is
increasing in whites. Moreover, the trend is consistent
with a cohort effect, with the increase beginning in 1995
for individuals aged 30 to 39 years and in 2005 for indi-
viduals aged 40 to 49 years, a decade later than the uptick
in incidence for each age group.25 Therefore, because the
increase in incidence is accompanied by an increase in
mortality, higher colonoscopy use in individuals aged
<50 years does not appear to be the main driver of the
increase in CRC incidence in young adults.
The current study has several limitations. First, it is
not known whether the increase in CRC incidence is
caused by an increase in the number of adenomas, a faster
adenoma progression to malignancy, or some combina-
tion of the 2. We found that under both assumption of a
higher adenoma onset as well as faster adenoma progres-
sion, screening initiation before age 50 years was optimal
and therefore also would be expected for the combination
of assumptions. Future research is needed to determine
the cause and carcinogenic pathway of the increase in
CRC. Second, it is not certain that the current 40-year-
olds will carry forward the same escalated disease risk as
they age. Therefore, we evaluated the extreme, namely
that they would return to levels for 1975-1979 levels, in a
sensitivity analysis. Although this impacted the predicted
benefits of screening, this only further lowered the recom-
mended starting age to 40 years when an ER threshold of
45 incremental colonoscopies per LYG was applied.
Third, we used the number of LYG and the number of
colonoscopies to measure the benefits and the burden,
respectively. Therefore, the burden of tests other than
colonoscopies was not considered, which made direct
comparison of all strategies not possible. Fourth, to the
best of our knowledge, there is no commonly accepted
threshold for the incremental number of colonoscopies
per LYG. For the USPSTF analysis, 39 was considered an
acceptable ratio for our model.14 Because it is recom-
mended to evaluate multiple willingness-to-pay thresh-
olds,22 we evaluated ER thresholds of 40, 45, and 50.
Although these thresholds are subjective and do influence
our model recommendations, the ER for screening initia-
tion at age 45 years was 32 in this analysis, and therefore
was superior to the ER accepted by the USPSTF.14 Fifth,
similar to the assumptions in our analysis for the
USPSTF,14 we assumed perfect adherence to all screen-
ing, diagnostic follow-up, and surveillance tests for the
purpose of comparing the performance of individual tests
under ideal assumptions. Therefore, the model predicted
the maximum achievable benefit for all screening strate-
gies. In reality, the current percentage of being up to date
with screening is 61.1%,26 and the adherence to diagnos-
tic follow-up and surveillance is approximately 80%.27,28
This suggests that the model-predicted benefits will not
be achieved. However, guidelines are optimally based on
the full potential of benefit that would accrue under com-
plete adherence to recommendations because assuming
realistic adherence might result in recommending more
frequent screenings as the model then compensates for the
substantial percentage of the population that does not par-
ticipate in every recommended screening. For individuals
who do adhere to the recommendations, this actually
would result in overscreening associated with unnecessary
burden. Furthermore, public health organizations will
always seek to increase adherence to recommendations.
Sixth, the lack of empirical data regarding the perfor-
mance of CRC screening tests in adults aged 45 to 49
years means that we assumed that these tests would per-
form equally well in this age group compared with adults
aged 50 to 54 years. In fact, apart from a lower prevalence
of disease, there is little reason to expect that performance
would differ. In the case of visual tests, lesions of interest
should have similar visibility. Tests for occult blood have

 been shown to perform differently by age, but the differ-
ence in characteristics is small at younger ages. Harms
associated with colonoscopy should be lower given the
observation that harms increase with increasing age.
Finally, we did not tailor recommendations to population
characteristics, whereas further personalization of screen-
ing may improve the balance of burden to benefit. In the
accompanying article, Meester et al have demonstrated
that when incidence is updated in race- and sex-specific
analyses, screening is recommended from age 45 years for
all race and gender combinations.29
A
well-established
decision-analytic
modeling
approach that incorporates the increase in CRC incidence
among those of younger ages suggests that screening from
ages 45 to 75 years is recommended for the current gener-
ation of 40-year-olds. Colonoscopy screening every 10
years, annual FIT screening, SIG screening every 5 years,
and CTC screening every 5 years are screening strategies
with similar benefits and acceptable colonoscopy burdens.
If the gradual increase in CRC incidence in more recent
birth cohorts continues, even earlier start ages for screen-
ing should be considered in the future.
