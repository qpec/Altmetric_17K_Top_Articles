SUMMARY
Transient episodes of brain oscillations are a com-
mon feature of both the waking and the sleeping
brain. Sleep spindles represent a prominent example
of a poorly understood transient brain oscillation that
is impaired in disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease
and schizophrenia. However, the causal role of these
bouts of thalamo-cortical oscillations remains un-
known. Demonstrating a functional role of sleep
spindles in cognitive processes has, so far, been hin-
dered by the lack of a tool to target transient brain os-
cillations in real time. Here, we show, for the first
time, selective enhancement of sleep spindles with
non-invasive
brain
stimulation
in
humans.
We
developed a system that detects sleep spindles in
real time and applies oscillatory stimulation. Our
stimulation selectively enhanced spindle activity as
determined by increased sigma activity after trans-
cranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) applica-
tion. This targeted modulation caused significant
enhancement of motor memory consolidation that
correlated with the stimulation-induced change in
fast spindle activity. Strikingly, we found a similar
correlation between motor memory and spindle
characteristics during the sham night for the same
spindle frequencies and electrode locations. There-
fore, our results directly demonstrate a functional
relationship between oscillatory spindle activity and
cognition.
INTRODUCTION
Oscillatory patterns are fundamental to the organization of tha-
lamo-cortical activity and are conserved across species [1, 2].
The presence of oscillations at different frequencies is dynami-
cally regulated as a function of overall behavioral state and
moment-to-moment fluctuations in cognitive demands [1–4].
The transient occurrence of pronounced rhythmic activity is
commonly observed in recordings of cortical network dynamics.
However, the causal role of the dynamic occurrence of brain os-
cillations remains poorly understood. Most prominently, sleep
spindles are transient electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations
between 11 and 16 Hz [5, 6]. The functional role of sleep spindles
in cognitive processes has been hypothesized, but not yet
directly demonstrated [7, 8]. Besides the issue that the majority
of previous studies on the role of sleep spindles are based on
correlations between sleep spindles and memory consolidation,
the few studies that manipulated sleep using tones, electrical
stimulation, or pharmacology increased sleep spindles indirectly
by enhancing slow oscillations/slow-wave sleep [9–13]. This
fundamental gap in our understanding of these thalamo-cortical
oscillations is the result of the lack of a tool to monitor and selec-
tively enhance transient epochs of oscillatory activity in real time
in humans. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)
applies a weak electrical current to the scalp, and recent evi-
dence demonstrates that tACS is capable of inducing fre-
quency-specific effects on brain dynamics [14–19] and can be
used to identify the functional role of brain oscillations in cogni-
tion [19–22]. However, no approach to selectively target tran-
sient oscillations has been described. Animal studies and
computational models showed that the effectiveness of trans-
cranial electrical stimulation (tES) relies on the internal network
dynamics; therefore, stimulation paradigms that resemble the
temporal structure of endogenous activity patterns are the
most effective paradigms [16, 23–27]. Based on these findings,
we hypothesized that real-time detection of transient oscillations
that trigger short epochs of tACS resembling the targeted
endogenous oscillation provides a means to boost transient os-
cillations. Sleep spindles represent the ideal target oscillation to
apply this approach for several reasons: (1) Sleep spindles are
clearly defined and distinct oscillations during non-rapid eye
movement (NREM) sleep that can be targeted in real time. (2)
So far, no approach has been described that enhanced sleep
spindle activity without increasing other sleep oscillations or
the time spent in specific sleep stages [10–12]. (3) Their pro-
posed role in cognitive processes such as memory consolidation
still needs to be demonstrated. (4) Several psychiatric and
neurologic disorders are hallmarked by sleep spindle deficits,

 such as Alzheimer’s disease [28], autism [29], and schizophrenia
[30–34]. We used an EEG-feedback-controlled approach that re-
stricts the application of tACS (FB-tACS) in the spindle frequency
range to when a sleep spindle during NREM sleep is detected
and, therefore, only targets network dynamics when spindle ac-
tivity is prevailing. We further performed two learning paradigms
(a declarative word pair and a procedural motor sequence tap-
ping task) that have typically been used to demonstrate sleep-
dependent memory consolidation [8, 10]. This approach enabled
us to ask whether sleep spindles play a causal role in memory
consolidation. This is a question of significant translational rele-
vance, given the number of neurological and psychiatric condi-
tions associated with memory impairment [33, 34]. We found
that spindle FB-tACS caused an enhancement of cortical syn-
chronization in the spindle frequency range that intensified the
spindling process and improved memory consolidation.
RESULTS
16 male participants underwent a screening night and, there-
after, completed two study nights (randomized, counterbal-
anced crossover design), one with spindle FB-tACS (verum)
and one without stimulation (sham). During both study nights,
participants performed an associative word pair (declarative)
and motor sequence tapping task (procedural) in the evening
and were retested in the morning to assess sleep-dependent
memory consolidation. All-night polysomnographic recordings
(8 hr EEG, EOG [electrooculogram], and EMG [electromyogram])
were collected. Participant-adapted thresholds based on spec-
tral power values and spindle characteristics obtained during the
screening-night EEG (Fz-CPz) were used to simultaneously eval-
uate in real time whether (1) the participant was in NREM sleep
and (2) spindle activity reached an individually defined threshold
(Figure 1A; Figure S1; Supplemental Experimental Procedures)
during the study nights. If (1) and (2) were met, short epochs of
alternating currents with a spindle-like waveform were applied
bi-frontally during the verum condition (1 mA, 12 Hz sine wave,
1 s duration at maximum amplitude, 0.25 s linear ramp up,
and 0.25 s linear ramp down; Figure 1B). Each stimulation was
followed by a 6.5 s timeout (no stimulation even if spindles are
present). Our electrode montage resulted in a stimulation that
encompassed broadly frontal and centro-parietal regions (Fig-
ure 2). Participants were successfully blinded to the stimulation
condition, as the two participants who reported sensation of
electrical stimulation did so during the sham night. One subject
was excluded from stimulation-related EEG analysis due
to bad signal quality (see the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures).
tACS Was Restricted to NREM Episodes with Prevailing
Sleep Spindle Activity
Our spindle detection algorithm led to tACS application solely
when sleep spindle activity was prevailing, as illustrated in Fig-
ure 3. In all participants, spindle activity was significantly higher
at and around the algorithm spindle detection time point (‘‘stim-
ulation onset’’) compared to the rest of the epoch as verified by
the Hilbert amplitude between 11 and 16 Hz during the sham
nights (Figure 3C). Furthermore, combining the NREM and sigma
threshold detection allowed for a successful identification of pre-
vailing spindle activity during NREM sleep, with a negligibly low
number of stimulations during REM or wakefulness (Figure S1E;
Table S1).
Spindle FB-tACS Improved Motor Memory Consolidation
We found superior motor memory consolidation (absolute over-
night difference; Figure 4A) assessed by speed for correct trials
(reduction in response time, a measure for the tapping time be-
tween key presses) after spindle FB-tACS (�21.01 ± 5.72 ms)
compared to sham (�10.97 ± 7.69 ms; robust linear mixed-
model factor condition: F(1, 11.8) = 5.7, p = 0.035). 12 of 16 par-
ticipants (responders) showed this beneficial effect of spindle
FB-tACS on motor memory consolidation (Figure 4B). This effect
was not driven by baseline performance differences, since the
response time in the evening was not different between sham
and verum conditions (factor condition: F(1, 11.8) = 0.0, p =
0.97). Furthermore, the reported motor sequence speed gains
cannot simply be explained by an improvement in attentional re-
action time, as performance in a psychomotor vigilance task was
not significantly affected by stimulation (Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures; Table S2). Number of errors and number
of correctly tapped sequences were not affected by stimulation
(Figure S2; all p values for factor condition were >0.1). Number of
correctly tapped sequences has previously been used as a mea-
sure for speed [10, 35, 36]. However, this measure likely as-
sesses both accuracy and speed, because it is dependent on
number of errors (accuracy) and response time (speed). Indeed,
we found that overnight changes in correctly tapped sequences
was negatively correlated with number of errors (pooled data for
both conditions, r(30) = �0.59, p < 0.001). In addition, we found
that decreased response time (increase in speed) across the

 sleep period was related to an increase in the number of correctly
tapped sequences; pooled data for both conditions, r(30) =
�0.52, p < 0.005. Of note, speed and accuracy were not signif-
icantly correlated and, therefore, represent two independent
components (pooled data for both conditions; r(30) = �0.25, p
> 0.1). Hence, it is important to separate those two components
of motor learning, because they might be differentially affected
by stimulation. Thus, stimulation effects might be masked if
combination measures (e.g., number of correct sequences) are
used. To confirm that the speed aspect of the number of
correctly tapped sequences was also significantly affected by
stimulation condition, we further controlled the robust linear
mixed model (dependent variable: number of correctly tapped
sequences) for accuracy by including number of errors as a co-
variate. Indeed, this corrected model revealed a significant effect
of stimulation condition on number of correctly tapped se-
quences, F(1, 10.9) = 5.17, p = 0.04, further confirming that, spe-
cifically, speed was significantly modulated by FB-tACS.
Spindle FB-tACS had no effect on declarative memory (differ-
ence in number of recalled word pairs: sham, 8.00 ± 1.23 words;
verum, 7.94 ± 1.07 words; F(1, 11.8) = 0.00, p = 0.97). Collec-
tively, spindle FB-tACS improved sleep-related gains in motor
sequence tapping speed but had no influence on motor
sequence accuracy or declarative memory.
Spindle FB-tACS Had No Effect on Sleep Architecture
but Increased Post-stimulation Spindle Activity
Given this beneficial effect of FB-tACS on motor memory consol-
idation, we next investigated whether FB-tACS enhanced sleep
spindle activity. We hypothesized that a selective enhancement
of spindle activity by stimulation was the underlying mechanism
of this memory improvement. First, we excluded the possibility
that overall effects on the macroscopic structure of sleep could
account for the effect on memory. None of the time spent in in-
dividual sleep stages or total sleep time was significantly
different between the sham and verum conditions (Table 1; all
p values of factor condition were >0.1). Furthermore, no signifi-
cant effect of condition on sleep architecture was found if only
motor memory responders (n = 12) were included (all p values
of factor condition were >0.1). Due to the pronounced stimula-
tion artifact (within �2 s around the tACS start and around
4.3–6 s, caused by internal source switching in the stimulator;
Figure S3; see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for
details), analysis was only possible in a stimulation-free interval.
Thus, we then examined how short epochs of 12-Hz tACS
affected the NREM sleep EEG in a short stimulation-free interval
after the tACS artifact (2–4.3 s after stimulation onset; see the
Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details) compared
to sham condition (only spindle detection trigger, no tACS
applied). For this analysis, 15 out of 16 participants were
included due to an unusable EEG for one participant (see the
Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We performed the
analysis separately for NREM sleep stages 2 and 3 (N2 and
N3, respectively) to account for number of included trials, light
sleep (N2) and deep sleep (N3), and different thalamic hyperpo-
larization levels (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures
for details). Spindle FB-tACS led to a broad increase in spindle
activity around 11–16 Hz only in N2 averaged over all electrodes,
with motor memory responders (n = 11) showing an increase in
very fast spindle frequencies (15–16 Hz) compared to non-re-
sponders (n = 4, show decrease; Figure 5). Besides a selective
increase in spindle activity, our stimulation also significantly
reduced power in the delta and theta ranges in N2 (Figure 5)
and N3 (Figure S4). Since sigma activity overlaps with alpha ac-
tivity during wakefulness, one might argue that the stimulation
leads to arousal that could explain an increase in sigma activity.
However, our results clearly show that this is not the case: (1)
wakefulness alpha is between 8 and 12 Hz, whereas our increase
in spindle activity is between 12 and 16 Hz (Figure S5); (2) the
spectrogram after the stimulation has a similar profile for sham
and verum epochs, looking clearly different from a typical wake-
fulness (eyes-closed) period; and (3) the number of wakefulness
periods and perceived sleep depth were not significantly
different between conditions (Table 1; Table S2).
FB-tACS-Induced Enhancement of Spindle Activity
Predicted Improvement in Motor Memory Consolidation
In order for sleep spindle activity to promote motor memory
speed gains, the stimulation-induced increase in spindle activity
should be related to the improvement in motor memory consol-
idation. Given that non-responders and responders mainly
differed in spindle activity increase for very fast frequencies
(15–16 Hz), we restricted our correlation analysis to this fre-
quency window. Indeed, we found a significant negative correla-
tion between the verum-related change in response time and
spindle activity for the very fast spindle frequency range, indi-
cating that the increase in fast sleep spindle activity predicted
reduction in tapping time (increase in speed) due to verum stim-
ulation (Figure 5C). This negative correlation was found globally
but only reached trend level or significance for mainly parietal
and occipital electrodes; Pearson correlation of merged pari-
eto-occipital cluster (four electrodes), r(13) = �0.65, p = 0.009
(cluster survives supra-threshold cluster analysis; see the Sup-
plemental Experimental Procedures). No significant correlation
was found for delta-theta activity reduction in tapping time due
to verum stimulation (Figure S6). The number of applied stimula-
tions during the verum night (Table S3) was not related to the
FB-tACS-related motor memory improvement, r(14) = �0.09,

 p = 0.75. Considering that we only encountered a spindle in-
crease in N2, we further performed the same analysis including
only the number of stimulations during N2. Again, no significant
correlation was found, r(14) = �0.05, p = 0.86.
Spindle Characteristics and Sleep-Dependent Motor
Memory Consolidation Are Similarly Correlated during
the Sham Night
To further confirm the role of fast sleep spindles in motor memory
consolidation, we finally examined whether a similar relationship
exists between motor memory consolidation and different
NREM sleep spindle characteristics (e.g., density) in the absence
of stimulation (sham). Overnight change in response time
was negatively correlated with spindle density and duration,
again for the same frequency bins (15–16 Hz for density and
14.5–16 Hz for duration) and posterior electrodes (Figure 6).
This finding convincingly confirms that the characteristics of
fast spindles, specifically density and duration, are important
for sleep-dependent motor memory consolidation.
DISCUSSION
We established a successful framework to investigate the
functional role of specific transient brain oscillations in cognitive
processes by applying targeted, individualized, and feedback-
controlled weak electrical brain stimulation. We found that spin-
dle FB-tACS can enhance sleep spindle activity in a broad fre-
quency range during NREM N2 sleep without increasing other
sleep rhythms or time spent in individual sleep stages. Further-
more, spindle FB-tACS enhanced motor sequence consolida-
tion by means of increased speed, and fast sleep spindle activity
played a functional role in this gain. Therefore, we provide the
first direct demonstration of the functional role of sleep spindle
activity in motor memory consolidation.
Sleep spindles have previously been hypothesized to benefit
memory formation [7, 8]. For instance, sleep-dependent im-
provements in declarative and procedural learning paradigms
correlated with sleep spindle characteristics [35, 37, 38].
Furthermore, spindles were increased during sleep following
the training of these learning paradigms compared to a control
condition [39–42]. In further support of a central role of sleep
spindles in memory processes, patients with schizophrenia
show a pronounced reduction in sleep spindles that correlates
with deficits in sleep-dependent motor memory consolidation
[33, 34]. However, these studies were restricted to correlations,
leaving it unclear whether learning-associated changes in sleep
spindle dynamics are an epiphenomenon or, indeed, play a
functional role in memory consolidation. Previous attempts in
manipulating sleep in humans (e.g., auditory stimulation, phar-
macology, or slow-oscillatory direct current stimulation) were
only successful in enhancing sleep spindles as a side effect
of enhancing slow oscillations [9, 10, 12, 13] or the time spent
in sleep stages, such as slow-wave sleep [11]. In addition, tES
approaches so far have only enhanced declarative memory
but failed to improve procedural tasks [43], even though one
of the studies reported increases in sleep spindle measures
along with enhanced slow oscillations/slow-wave sleep [10].
A possible explanation for this missing effect on procedural
memory is that the reported significant increase in sleep spin-
dles was only found for slow-frequency spindles, but not for

(A) Single EEG trace of a representative participant
with a detected spindle (pink dashed line) using
our online spindle detection algorithm. The algo-
rithm we used detected a spindle using two
criteria. The first one was the spindle activity
threshold, and the second one was the number of
peaks above this threshold. When the algorithm
detected five peaks above the threshold (refers to
time point 0 ms, pink dashed line), stimulation
started for 1.5 s in the verum condition. Online
spindle detection was used to control the stimu-
lation start, ensuring cortical stimulation exclu-
sively during NREM spindles. Trace was obtained
from a sham night (Fz-CPz, only triggering, no
stimulation).
(B) Spectrogram of Fz-CPz of a representative
participant during sham night shows that tACS
triggers were present during sleep spindles, as
indicated by increased spindle activity (10–16 Hz)
around 0 (represents onset of tACS for verum
condition).
(C) Spindle (11–16 Hz) Hilbert amplitude averaged
spindle triggers of Fz-CPz during sham night. Each

illustrated epoch to the overall mean of the epoch (�2.5 to 7.5 s around trigger) for all correct NREM spindle triggers. Gray-black bars illustrate the number of
participants showing significant increased spindle amplitude at the respective time point compared to the mean of the whole epoch. Around 0 ms (‘‘stimulation
onset’’), all participants showed significantly increased, prevailing spindle activity compared to the rest of the epoch.

 fast-frequency spindles [10]. In addition, all studies using tES to
modulate NREM sleep and enhance memory consolidation
applied either slow-oscillatory transcranial direct current stimu-
lation (tDCS)/tACS (0.75 Hz) or tDCS [43] and were, therefore,
not optimized to selectively target sleep spindles. We are the
first here to selectively enhance sleep spindle activity, along
with motor memory consolidation, using FB-tACS throughout
nocturnal sleep and, therefore, provide a functional role of
these oscillations in cognitive processes.
Spindle FB-tACS specifically enhanced sleep-dependent
speed gains, and not accuracy, in a motor sequence tapping
paradigm reflected in a significant decrease of response time
but not error rate. This is in accordance with previous studies
that mainly found a robust effect of sleep on speed measures
(e.g., [10, 11, 36, 44, 45]). However, most of these studies used
number of correct sequences per trial as a measure for speed.
Our results revealed that the number of correct trials is not inde-
pendent of the error rate and, therefore, relates to the accuracy
of the performance. In addition, some studies also indicate a
beneficial effect of sleep on the error rate (accuracy) [46]. In other
words, changes/variations in error rate might be reflected in the
number of correct sequences and could, therefore, mask/
confound sleep and intervention condition effects on speed
measures. By including error rate as a covariate in our model,
stimulation condition had a significant effect on number of
correctly tapped sequences, showing that spindle FB-tACS
selectively enhanced sleep-dependent speed benefits, but not
accuracy. Collectively, our findings argue for the use of more
‘‘pure’’ measures of speed in motor sequence tapping tasks,
e.g., by focusing on the response time of correctly tapped se-
quences or controlling for the error rate in future models. Of
note, future studies will be needed to investigate more complex
‘‘real-life’’ motor tasks that benefit from sleep and to relate those
findings to sleep spindles/FB-tACS. To elucidate the specific
changes that sleep spindles have on motor memory, the use of
simple motor tasks can be of advantage. In our case, the task
design enabled us to differentiate speed from accuracy. Never-
theless, from a translational point of view, it remains to be inves-
tigated whether ‘‘real-life’’ memory impairments could benefit
from our stimulation approach.
It has recently been shown that tACS effects on cognitive per-
formance are dependent on basal cognitive performance [47].
Indeed, we also see a significant negative correlation, r(14) =
�0.86, p = 0.004, for sham motor memory consolidation and
FB-tACS-related increases, indicating that the more participants
already benefit from sleep in motor sequence memory during the
sham night, the less they further improve due to FB-tACS stimu-
lation. However, as Santarnecchi et al. [47] addressed in their
publication, we cannot rule out that the correlation we see is
confounded by regression to the mean. Future studies are
needed to support this specific finding.
Analysis of spindle activity during tACS was not possible due
to the stimulation artifact. However, spindle activity was
enhanced in a specific window after tACS. We hypothesize
that our stimulation increases properties of the next spindle
that followed the initially detected/and stimulated one (either
probability of having a spindle, duration, or amplitude of the
spindle). Intriguingly, the increase starts around 3.5 s after the
previous spindle started. According to literature, sleep spindles
seem to have a prominent reoccurrence rate of around 3–5 s
[48–50]. This also points to the idea that the spindle following
the stimulation might have been affected or more likely to be
started. Since we have clear analysis limitations due to strong,
multiple artifacts in our verum night (and, therefore, not a
continuous recording that can be investigated), we further
investigated correlations of motor memory benefits and spindle
characteristics during the sham night. Our findings show that
mainly spindle density and duration are correlated with the
sleep benefit on motor sequence tapping speed, which gives
a first hint that changes in sleep spindle duration and/or density
might have given rise to our verum-related motor memory
improvement. Further studies are needed to determine the ef-
fect of our stimulation on the stimulated spindle itself and spe-
cific spindle characteristics in a dataset that can be continu-
ously analyzed. This might be achieved by performing animal
experiments with intracranial electrodes where spiking activity
can be obtained during stimulation (e.g., [23]) or by developing
and applying highly sophisticated tACS artifact removal algo-
rithms that can perfectly separate neuronal activity from artifact
in the same frequency range. Long-lasting effects of tACS have
been reported, but previous reports did not find any long-last-
ing effects of tACS during wakefulness for very short applica-
tions of tACS (e.g., 1 s [51, 52]). However, they focused on
alpha activity during wakefulness, and a different mechanism
might hold true for sleep. A recent report from our group [53]
showed that stimulation effects that outlast stimulation de-
pended on the specific state in wakefulness. Moreover, using
a computational model, the study suggested that recurrent

 connections in thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical loops led
to outlasting effects of stimulation. A similar mechanism is plau-
sibly in play in the present study. During sleep, short stimulation
bursts may activate the thalamo-cortical loop, which leads to a
more pronounced subsequent spindle, or increase the likeli-
hood of occurrence of the next spindle after stimulation. Along
this line, we could speculate that we only see a spindle activity
increase in N2, but not N3, because the stimulation was not
strong enough to modulate thalamo-cortical system properties
during N3, since this state is characterized by more delta/slow
waves and fewer sleep spindles than N2 [5, 54]. Future studies
in animal models will be needed to explore spindle changes af-
ter tACS and to establish the mechanism of this tACS induced
after the effect in spindle activity using cortical and subcortical
invasive recordings. The stimulation-induced overnight gains in
motor sequence learning were mediated by fast sleep spindle
activity, which is in line with previous literature showing a cor-
relation of motor memory exclusively with fast spindle charac-
teristics [39]. We replicate this correlation in the sham night with
different spindle characteristics and found the same frequency
bins and electrodes of spindle density and duration significantly
correlating with motor memory consolidation. Several studies
hypothesized that slow- and fast-frequency spindles might
serve different functions [5, 39, 55]. Each spindle type shows
a different topography with slower spindle frequencies (around
12 Hz) being preferentially visible over frontal areas, whereas
fast sleep spindles (around 14 Hz) are more pronounced over
centro-parietal regions [5, 54, 56, 57]. Considering that our cor-
relations with motor memory consolidation were restricted to
the fast spindle frequency range, our results underline the
assumption that slow and fast sleep spindles might serve
different functions. Therefore, our results highlight the impor-
tance of separating slow and fast frequencies for future ana-
lyses of sleep spindles. The correlation between spindle activity
and memory consolidation is seen mainly over posterior re-
gions. Of note, the negative correlations are global but only
reach significance in the posterior regions. Thus, it is important
to take our spatial findings with caution. Fronto-parietal regions
(e.g., SMA [supplementary motor area], M1, precuneus), cere-
bellum, and basal ganglia are implicated in motor sequence
learning [58, 59]. Interestingly, frontal regions seem to be
more activated during early stages of learning, while parietal re-
gions seem to get more involved during later stages [58, 60]. In
addition, Shadmehr and Holcomb showed that, hours after
performing a visuomotor task (consolidation), there is a shift
in the neural representation of the internal model by means of
activation in posterior parietal regions instead of frontal regions
[61]. Thus, our correlation, which is strongest at parietal re-
gions, might point to the main parietal involvement in motor
sequence consolidation. However, it is still unclear which spe-
cific cortical regions might be involved in sleep-dependent
memory consolidation. Based on our findings, future studies
should specifically target posterior brain regions using faster
frequencies (e.g., 15 Hz tACS) to optimally benefit motor mem-
ory consolidation.
In addition, the question arises whether synchronization of
frontal oscillatory activity might play a role for the efficacy of
our applied stimulation on behavior. It still remains to be investi-
gated whether spindles synchronized across cortical regions are
essential for memory consolidation to occur or whether only
spindles localized to brain regions involved in performing the
task are necessary. Future studies are needed to investigate
this idea by, e.g., using only left or right hemispheric stimulation
or out-of-phase stimulation.
Besides sleep spindles, slow waves have been proposed to
play an important role in memory consolidation [8]. However,
we found a superior sleep-dependent speed gain for verum con-
dition, despite a spindle FB-tACS-induced decrease in delta and
theta power, pointing to a limited role of slow waves in this spe-
cific process. Along this line, some studies have suggested a role
of spindles in motor memory consolidation in dissociation from
effects mediated by the slow waves. Using tones to reduce
slow waves and REM sleep without changing sleep spindles,
Genzel et al. [62] were able to preserve the consolidation of pro-
cedural and declarative memory. Enhancing slow-wave activity
(SWA; 0.5–4 Hz) but decreasing spindle activity using the
GABA reuptake inhibitor Tiagabine led to diminished memory
consolidation in a motor sequence tapping task [63]. Finally, pa-
tients with schizophrenia who show reduced motor sequence
consolidation also exhibit a pronounced decrease in sleep spin-
dles with negligible changes in SWA [31–34, 64]. Here, we show
that selective spindle enhancement had no effect on declarative
memory consolidation, despite this hypothesis from previous
studies [8]. A possible explanation for this missing effect could

 be the reduction in delta activity, because sleep spindles might
only be beneficial for this memory type in combination with
slow waves [65]. However, further studies are needed to delin-
eate the importance of coalescence of slow waves and spindles
for declarative memory, e.g., by applying spindle tACS time
locked to slow-wave up states.
Our results further suggest that sleep spindles and slow waves
cannot be independently modulated. Along this line, previous
studies have shown that specific sleep spindle characteristics
and slow waves are inversely related [5, 54, 66–70]. For instance,
spindle density and spindle frequency are reduced in early
NREM sleep, in the middle of NREM cycles and in N3, when
SWA is maximal [54]. Further studies underlining this notion
found less spindle activity in the recovery night after sleep depri-
vation that is marked by increased SWA [5, 68] or reported nega-
tive correlations between spindle measures (e.g., sigma activity)
and SWA during NREM sleep [69, 70]. Our results further support
and extend the notion that SWA and sleep spindles share a
reciprocal relationship.
Collectively, spindle FB-tACS revealed the functional relation-
ship between fast sleep spindles and motor memory consolida-
tion. Thus, our findings serve as an important starting point to
develop neuro-therapeutics for treating motor memory impair-
ments afflicting patients with psychiatric and neurological disor-
ders [33, 34, 64] and older individuals [71]. Future studies, how-
ever, are needed to further find optimized stimulation parameters
by means of ideal stimulation location (centro-parietal instead of
frontal) and (spindle) frequency applied (e.g., 15 Hz instead of
12 Hz). In addition, future research is needed to evaluate whether
other frequencies temporally far from spindle activity worsen
the performance. In a broader context, our results provide
convincing evidence that targeted and individualized stimulation

Figure 5. FB-tACS Increases Spindle Activity during NREM Stage 2 Sleep that Is Related to Stimulation-Induced Motor Sequence Tapping
Speed Gains
(A) Difference of spectrograms (verum � sham) averaged for all channels for longest artifact-free interval during NREM stage 2 (N2, 2–4.3 s) and corresponding p
values of a paired t test between sham and verum conditions (p values >0.1 are black; pink rectangles highlight window with increased spindle activity).
(B) Detailed analysis of increased spindle activity window during N2 (11–16 Hz; pink window in A). Spectrogram values were averaged over time for the selected
time window and plotted for each frequency bin and channel. This analysis was done for responders (n = 11; superior speed gain in motor sequence task for
verum condition compared to sham) and non-responders (n = 4) separately.
(C) Topographical representation of Pearson correlation coefficients between the spindle activity difference (n = 15; pooled for responders and non-responders)
for 15–16 Hz (black rectangle in B) and the difference (verum � sham) in overnight speed gain (Figure 4B). Superior speed gain in verum condition compared to
sham is reflected in a negative number as superior speed means reduced response time. Thus, negative correlation coefficients show that more spindle activity
increase is related to a more pronounced sleep-dependent response time decrease (speed increase) in the verum condition compared to sham. Electrodes (black
dots) that showed a significant correlation (Pearson) are indicated with gray dots (p < 0.05), and electrodes that showed a trend level are indicated with white dots
(p R 0.05 and p < 0.1). The size of the cluster (four neighboring electrodes with gray and white dots) was significant after a supra-threshold cluster analysis was
performed (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures).

 approaches are fundamental for selectively boosting transient
brain oscillations. Furthermore, our study provides a model para-
digm for establishing the functional role of transient brain oscilla-
tions in human behavior. Our FB-tACS design is a radical depar-
ture from the former stimulation approach, because it takes
individual, endogenous network activity into account. Stimula-
tion success likely depends on the underlying network activity
as has been convincingly shown in in vivo, in vitro, and compu-
tational studies [16, 23–26]. This is why feedback-controlled ap-
proaches provide a promising starting point for individualized
treatment paradigms that successfully target pathological
network dynamics with non-invasive brain stimulation.
