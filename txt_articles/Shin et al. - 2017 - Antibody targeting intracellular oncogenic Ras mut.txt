Oncogenic Ras mutants, frequently detected in human cancers, are high-priority anticancer
drug targets. However, direct inhibition of oncogenic Ras mutants with small molecules
has been extremely challenging. Here we report the development of a human IgG1 format
antibody, RT11, which internalizes into the cytosol of living cells and selectively binds to the
activated GTP-bound form of various oncogenic Ras mutants to block the interactions with
effector proteins, thereby suppressing downstream signalling and exerting anti-proliferative
effects in a variety of tumour cells harbouring oncogenic Ras mutants. When systemically
administered, an RT11 variant with an additional tumour-associated integrin binding moiety
for tumour tissue targeting significantly inhibits the in vivo growth of oncogenic Ras-mutated
tumour xenografts in mice, but not wild-type Ras-harbouring tumours. Our results demon-
strate the feasibility of developing therapeutic antibodies for direct targeting of cytosolic
proteins that are inaccessible using current antibody technology.

 R
as proteins (KRas, HRas and NRas) are small GTPases that
function as molecular switches at the inner plasma
membrane by alternating between GTP-bound active
forms (Ras � GTP) and GDP-bound (Ras � GDP) inactive forms,
which differ based on the conformations of their switch I and
switch II regions1,2. Only active Ras � GTP interacts through its
two distinct switch regions with the conserved Ras-binding
domain (RBD) of multiple effector proteins, such as Raf kinases,
PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) and RalGDS (Ral guanine
nucleotide dissociation stimulator)3,4. These protein–protein
interactions
(PPIs)
trigger
many
cellular
signalling
of
proliferation,
differentiation
and
survival1,2.
Oncogenic
mutations in Ras proteins, predominantly found at G12, G13
and Q61 residues, impair the GTPase activity rendering the
mutants persistently GTP-bound active form, thereby promoting
tumorigenesis
and
tumour
malignancy1,2.
Oncogenic
Ras
mutants, and most frequently KRas mutants (86% of Ras-
driven cancers)5, are found in B25% of human cancers with the
highest frequencies in pancreatic (B98%) and colorectal (B53%)
cancers1,6.
Decades of efforts have been made to develop oncogenic Ras
mutant-targeting small molecule agents7–12. However, direct
inhibition of oncogenic Ras mutants has proven extremely
challenging and no agents have been clinically approved to
date; this is mainly due to difficulties in identifying druggable
pockets for small molecule binding on the surface of Ras13.
Recently, the small-molecule rigosertib, which binds to the RBD
of effector proteins rather than Ras itself, was shown to block the
PPIs between Ras and effector proteins14. Alternatively, some
peptide-based inhibitors that block the PPIs between active Ras
and effector proteins have been reported15,16; however, the in vivo
activities were not evaluated.
Antibodies with large surface area paratopes are excellent to
specifically target proteins with high affinity17. More than 40
therapeutic antibodies have been clinically approved against
many extracellular proteins18. However, such antibodies do not
have the capacity to localize to cellular cytosolic regions after
receptor-mediated endocytosis19, restricting their therapeutic
application
in
targeting
cytosolic
proteins.
Previously,
intracellularly expressed antibody fragments (intrabodies) were
developed that selectively bind to the active Ras � GTP form to
block
the
PPIs
with
effector
proteins,
thereby
inhibiting
tumorigenesis
and
metastasis
in
mouse
models20,21.
This
suggests that blocking intracellular Ras � GTP–effector PPIs
using
a
conventional
antibody
regimen
such
as
systemic
administration
could
be
an
effective
approach
to
inhibit
oncogenic Ras-driven signalling.
Here we describe the generation and therapeutic efficacy of a
human IgG1 format antibody, named iMab (internalizing and
PPI interfering monoclonal antibody), which directly targets the
intracellularly activated GTP-bound form of oncogenic Ras
mutants after internalization into the cytosol of living cells. iMab
specifically binds to the PPI interfaces between activated Ras
and effector proteins to block these associations, thereby
inhibiting downstream oncogenic signalling and exerting anti-
tumour effects in mouse xenograft models when systemically
administered.
Results
Generation of GTP-bound active Ras specific RT11 iMab. We
recently reported a cytosol-penetrating antibody TMab4, referred
to as cytotransmab22. In the intact human IgG1 form, this
can reach the cytosol of living cells after internalization through
clathrin-mediated
endocytosis
using
cell
surface-expressed
heparan
sulfate
proteoglycan
(HSPG)
as
a
receptor,
and
subsequent endosomal escape from early endosomes into the
cytosol22,23.
Internalized
TMab4
undergoes
conformational
changes in response to the acidified pH of early endosomes,
which results in endosomal membrane pore formation, through
which TMab4 escapes into the cytosol24. Since the capacity for
cellular internalization and subsequent endosomal escape of
TMab4 cytotransmab resides in the light chain variable domain
(VL)22,24, we sought to generate an active Ras � GTP-specific iMab
by replacing the original heavy chain variable domain (VH) of
TMab4 with a Ras � GTP specific-binding VH domain in the
conventional IgG1 format (Fig. 1a). As an antigen to screen such
VH domains, the active form of human KRas mutant with a
G12D mutation (KRasG12D), which is the most prevalent mutant
found in Ras-driven tumours1,5, was prepared by loading it with
the non-hydrolysable GTP analog, GppNHp (guanosine 50-[b,g-
imido] triphosphate). The conformations of GppNHp-bound
KRas mutants are equivalent to those of the GTP-bound forms
with resistance to g-phosphate hydrolysis4,11,20. To isolate active
Ras form–specific VH domains, we screened synthetic human
heavy chain (HC) libraries displayed in the format of VH library-
CH1 on the surface of yeast haploid cells25. This was performed
by one round of magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) and then
one round of fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) against
biotinylated KRasG12D � GppNHp antigen in the presence of
at least a 10-fold excess molar ratio of non-biotinylated
KRasG12D � GDP as a soluble competitor (Fig. 1b). The enriched
HC yeast haploid library cells were then mated with the other
mating type of yeast cells that secret the light chain (LC) with the
VL-CL of TMab4 in an attempt to isolate a Ras � GTP specific VH
that can properly associate with TMab4 VL in the IgG form
(Fig. 1b). Two subsequent rounds of FACS of the mated Fab
library in the mode of competition screening generated the RT4
clone. When characterized in the purified human IgG1 form, RT4
selectively bound KRasG12D � GppNHp, but not KRasG12D � GDP,
with a dissociation constant (KD) of B110 nM (Supplementary
Fig. 1a–c).
To further increase the affinity of RT4 for active Ras form,
we constructed three types of HC libraries based on the RT4
VH domain in yeast haploid cells (Supplementary Fig. 2a)
and screened them against KRasG12D � GppNHp in competition
mode using KRasG12D � GDP with one round of MACS and
then mated the enriched library cells with the yeast cells
that secret TMab4 LC. The mated diploid yeast cells were
further subjected to competition screening by FACS, yielding 6
unique high affinity RT4 variants (Supplementary Fig. 2b).
Evaluation of these variants in the purified human IgG1 form
for
selective
binding
activity
of
KRasG12D � GppNHp
over
KRasG12D � GDP led us to choose RT11 for further study
(Supplementary Fig. 2c–f).
RT11 binds to the PPI interfaces of active Ras form. RT11
bound selectively to the GppNHp-bound active forms of wild-
type (WT) KRas, NRas, and HRas and their oncogenic mutants
with mutations at residue 12, 13 or 61, such as KRasG12D,
KRasG12V, KRasG13D, KRasQ61H, HRasG12V and NRasQ61R, but
negligibly to the GDP-bound inactive forms (Fig. 1c). This
demonstrated that RT11 specifically binds to the activated forms
of all three Ras proteins, regardless of isotype and oncogenic
mutations. When measured by surface plasmon resonance, the
KD values ranged from 4 to 17 nM (Supplementary Table 1),
which suggests a much stronger affinity than that of active Ras for
its effector proteins, such as approximately 56–160nM for Raf26–28,
1 mM for RalGDS29 and 2.7mM for PI3K30,31. RT11 efficiently
competed with the RBDs of cRaf (cRafRBD) and RalGDS

 (RalGDSRBD), as well as PI3Ka (p110a/p85a), for binding to
KRasG12D� GppNHp (Fig. 1d), suggesting that RT11 binds to the
PPI interfaces between active Ras and effector proteins.
To further identify the epitopes recognized by RT11, alanine-
scanning mutagenesis was performed focusing on residues in
direct contact with effector proteins in the switch I (residues 30–38)
and switch II (residues 60–76) regions of KRasG12D (Fig. 1e)3,4,30.
RT11 significantly lost binding affinity for KRasG12D � GppNHp
mutants carrying an alanine substitution at most residues in the
switch I (D33, P34, T35, I36, E37, D38 and Y40) and switch II
regions (E63), with the exception of some residues (E31, S39, R41,
Q61 and Y64; Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 3a). This
mutational study, combined with the results of competition
ELISA, strongly suggests that RT11 specifically binds to the PPI
interfaces, namely the switch I and II regions, of active Ras form
with the effector proteins (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 3b).
When assessed with other Ras family members32, RT11
exhibited B50% binding activity for GppNHp-bound active
forms of MRasWT and RRasWT, but not for the GDP-bound
inactive
ones,
when
compared
to
active
KRasG12D
(Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). This can be explained by the
virtually identical residues in the switch I and II regions

family
members,
but
the
slightly
distinct
tertiary conformations, compared to those of Ras proteins
(Supplementary Fig. 4c,d)33. However, RT11 did not cross-react
with both active and inactive forms of Rac1WT, belonging to the
Rho family of GTPases32, which has much different primary and
tertiary structures from those of Ras proteins (Supplementary
Fig. 4).
RT11 penetrates into living cells and binds to active Ras. We
next evaluated whether RT11 can reach the cytosol from outside
of living cells through a split-GFP (green fluorescent protein)
complementation cellular assay23,24. In this assay, complemented
GFP fluorescence can be observed only when extracellularly-
treated RT11-GFP11-SBP2 (RT11 fused with GFP11 fragment
and a streptavidin-binding peptide 2 (SBP2) at the C terminus of
HC) reaches the cytosol of HeLa-SA-GFP1-10 cells stably
expressing a streptavidin (SA)-fused GFP1-10 fragment in the
cytosol (Fig. 2a). RT11-GFP11-SBP2 incubated with RasWT-
harbouring HeLa-SA-GFP1-10 cells exhibited complemented
GFP fluorescence in the cytosol, similar to that observed with
TMab4-GFP11-SBP2 (ref. 23), demonstrating that RT11 retains
the cytosol-penetrating ability of TMab4 VL. Quantification of
the cytosolic access amount23 of RT11 revealed quantities of B14
and 195 nM after 6 h of extracellular treatment of HeLa cells with
0.1 and 1 mM RT11, respectively (Supplementary Table 2).
Furthermore, when incubated with mCherry-KRasG12V-trans-
formed mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 and KRasG12V-harbouring
human colorectal SW480 cells under normal cell culture
conditions, internalized RT11, but not TMab4, co-localized with
KRasG12V at the inner plasma membrane (Fig. 2b), where active
KRasG12V � GTP is anchored1,2. However, in RasWT-harbouring
human colorectal HT29 cells, RT11 predominantly localized
throughout the cytosol without enrichment at the plasma
membrane (Fig. 2b), similar to TMab4. This could be ascribed
to the predominant presence of RasWT in the inactive form in
resting cells34,35. Immunoprecipitation (IP) using endosome-
depleted cell lysates of RT11-treated KRasG12V-transformed
NIH3T3 cells and KRasG12V-harbouring SW480 cells, using
RT11 itself, revealed the physical interaction of RT11 with
cytosolic KRas mutants after internalization (Fig. 2c). These
results demonstrate that RT11, originating from outside the cells,
can specifically recognize the GTP-bound active Ras forms at the
inner
plasma
membrane
after
cellular
internalization
and
cytosolic localization.
RT11 inhibits the in vitro growth of Ras mutant tumour cells.
We next assessed the ability of RT11 to inhibit the proliferation of
tumour cells carrying various oncogenic Ras mutants under
monolayer culture conditions. In contrast to TMab4, which
showed negligible cytotoxicity to cells, RT11 exhibited dose-
dependent anti-proliferative activity for diverse oncogenic Ras
mutant tumour cells, such as colorectal carcinoma SW480
(KRasG12V) and LoVo (KRasG13D) cells, pancreatic carcinoma
AsPC-1 (KRasG12D) and PANC-1 (KRasG12D) cells, fibrosarcoma
HT1080 (NRasQ61K) cells, lung carcinoma H1299 (NRasQ61K)
cells, leukemic HL60 (NRasQ61L) cells and KRasG12V-trans-
formed NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 5a). The
anti-proliferative activity of RT11 was much weaker than and
comparable to that of the pharmacological inhibitor sorafenib
(Raf kinase inhibitor) and LY294002 (PI3K-Akt inhibitor),
respectively, when compared at the equivalent molar concentra-
tions
(Supplementary
Fig.
5b).

 pharmacological inhibitors, RT11 did not show significant cyto-
toxicity to RasWT cells, specifically colorectal Colo320DM and
HT29 cells, breast MCF-7 cells and leukemic K562 cells, as well as
non-transformed NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3a and Supplementary
Fig. 5a), indicating that direct Ras blocking by RT11 results in
minimal toxicity to RasWT cells probably due to their minimal
dependence on the Ras-driven signalling for proliferation1,2,35.
Oncogenic Ras mutations are known to drive anchorage-
independent tumour growth, another important hallmark of
cellular transformation21,36. On the basis of soft agar colony-
formation assays, RT11 treatment resulted in B44–64% inhibition
of anchorage-independent
proliferation for oncogenic KRas
mutant cells (SW480, LoVo and PANC-1) and NRas mutant
cells (HT1080 and H1229), but not in RasWT Colo320DM and
K562
cells,

treatment
(Supplementary Fig. 5c). This result demonstrates that RT11
suppresses the tumorigenic activity of oncogenic Ras mutants. Of
note, the effect on tumour growth after blocking oncogenic Ras
with RT11 was more evident in anchorage-independent growth
conditions (soft agar) than that in monolayer culture conditions
(Supplementary Fig. 5a,c), which is line with previous observations
with siRNA-mediated knockdown of oncogenic Ras37,38.
RT11 blocks active Ras-effector protein interactions. To eluci-
date the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-proliferative
activity of RT11, we first examined the ability of RT11 to disrupt
the association between oncogenic KRas mutants and effector
proteins within the cytosol of cells by analysing the subcellular
localization of enhanced GFP-fused cRafRBD (eGFP-cRafRBD)
after transformation into KRasG12V-harbouring SW480 cells10.

indicating a physical association between KRasG12V and eGFP-

transformed SW480 cells with RT11, but not TMab4, displaced
the eGFP-cRafRBD probe from the inner plasma membrane
(location of active KRas) to the cytosol (Fig. 3b). Furthermore,

 blocks PPIs between active oncogenic KRas mutants and effector
proteins after cellular internalization in living cells.
We next investigated the effect of RT11 on downstream
signalling mediated by Ras � GTP-effector PPIs such as the Raf-
MEK1/2-ERK1/2
and
PI3K-Akt-mTOR
pathways1,2.
RT11
exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of downstream signalling
mediated by PPIs of Ras-Raf (MEK1/2 and ERK1/2) and Ras-
PI3K (Akt and p70S6K) in serum-stimulated HA-KRasG12V-
transformed NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3e) and epidermal growth factor
(EGF)-stimulated SW480 cells (Fig. 3f). The Raf inhibitor
sorafenib and PI3K-Akt inhibitor LY294002 attenuated only
targeted signalling in SW480 cells (Fig. 3f). These results
demonstrate that competitive blocking of active Ras-effector
PPIs by RT11 results in the attenuation of downstream signalling,
which is required for cell growth and survival.
We examined whether RT11 affects the intrinsic GTPase
activity of GTP-loaded KRasWT and KRasG12D in vitro. RT11 did
not significantly affect the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of both
KRasWT and KRasG12D, similar to TMab4 (Supplementary
Fig. 6), indicating that the inhibitory activity of RT11 against
active Ras signalling is not through an acceleration in GTP
hydrolysis of active Ras.
Generation of tumour-associated integrin targeting RT11-i.
Since RT11 internalizes through HSPG, which is ubiquitously
expressed in epithelial cells22, we hypothesized that this antibody
might lack tissue specificity when administered systemically. To
confer tumour tissue specificity to RT11, the RGD10 cyclic
peptide
(13
residues:
DGARYCRGDCFDG),
which
binds
specifically to tumour-associated integrins such as avb3 and
avb5 (ref. 39), was genetically fused to the N-terminus of the LC
of RT11 via a (G4S)2 linker, generating RT11-i (Fig. 4a). As a
control, TMab4-i was also generated in the same manner.
Integrin avb3 and/or avb5 are overexpressed on the surface of
many types of tumour cells and tumour-associated blood
vessels40. RT11-i and TMab4-i, purified in well-assembled IgG
forms without non-native soluble oligomers (Supplementary
Fig. 7a,b), selectively bound to integrin avb3-transformed K562
cells, but not to the WT K562 cells, as well as to integrin avb5-
expressing tumour cells (Fig. 4b,c). Furthermore, RT11-i retained
its selective binding of only active Ras forms (Supplementary
Fig. 7c), its cytosol-penetrating ability (Supplementary Fig. 7d and
Supplementary Table 2), and its binding to inner plasma
membrane-anchored
active
KRas
mutants
after
cellular
internalization (Fig. 4d,e). Even after 48 h of incubation at
50 �C, both RT11 and RT11-i maintained selective binding to
active KRasG12D form without the formation of soluble oligomers
(Supplementary
Fig.
8),
indicating
that
RT11-i
possesses
comparable thermal stability to that of RT11. Thus, the fusion
of the RGD10 peptide to the N terminus of the LC of RT11 did
not compromise the biochemical and biophysical properties of
RT11.
RT11-i
exhibited
significantly
improved
anti-proliferative
activity against oncogenic Ras mutant tumour cells grown in
monolayer
culture
conditions,
but
not
against
RasWT
Colo320DM cells, when compared with that of TMab4-i
(Supplementary Fig. 7e). However, the Ras-specific blocking
effect was modest because TMab4-i itself also exerted anti-
proliferative activity due to RGD10-mediated integrin blocking of
anchorage-dependent growth39,40. When assessed in anchorage-
independent growth conditions on soft agar, RT11-i resulted in
B40–67% suppression of colony formation in oncogenic Ras
mutant
SW480
(KRasG12V),
LoVo
(KRasG13D),
AsPC-1
(KRasG12D), PANC-1 (KRasG12D), HT1080 (NRasQ61K) and
H1299 (NRasQ61K) cells, but not in RasWT Colo320DM cells,
when compared to TMab4-i (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 7f).
These data demonstrate that RT11-i retains the anti-proliferative
activity of RT11 by specifically blocking oncogenic Ras signalling
in tumour cells.
Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of RT11-i. The phar-
macokinetic profiles of RT11-i and TMab4-i were examined in
BALB/c athymic nude mice following a single intravenous
injection of 20 mg kg–1. The plasma concentrations of the anti-
bodies declined in a biphasic manner (Fig. 5a), which is a typical
profile for systemically administered antibodies41. The terminal
serum half-life (T1/2b) was similar for each antibody, and was
specifically 105.8±2.3 h and 100.1±3.1h for RT11-i and TMab4-i,
respectively, resembling that of other IgG-format antibodies in
mice41.
We next determined tissue distribution by intravenous dosing
of DyLight755-labelled antibodies into nude mice bearing
integrin avb5-expressing SW480 xenograft tumours. RT11 with-
out RGD10 fusion did not exhibit any increased distribution in
the tumours, compared to that in normal tissues, during 24 h
circulation (Supplementary Fig. 9a,b). In contrast, RGD10-fused
RT11-i and TMab4-i displayed preferential accumulation in the
tumours with a peak at 24 h post injection, when compared to
that in the normal tissues (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 9c),
demonstrating the in vivo tumour targeting ability of RT11-i and
TMab4-i.
RT11-i inhibits the in vivo growth of Ras mutant tumours. We
next assessed the in vivo anti-tumour efficacy of RT11-i through
intravenous
injection
into
mice
harbouring
pre-established
oncogenic Ras mutant tumour xenografts (SW480 (KRasG12V),
LoVo (KRasG13D), and HT1080 (NRasQ61K)), or RasWT tumours
(Colo320DM). Compared to the PBS-treated vehicle control,
TMab4-i slightly retarded the growth of SW480 and HT1080
tumours, which was accompanied by reduced phosphorylation of
Akt (Fig. 6a,b and Supplementary Figs 10 and 11); this could be
attributed to the anti-tumour activity of the RGD10 moiety,
through blocking integrin avb3- and/or avb5-mediated tumour
angiogenesis and growth39,40. Nonetheless, the growth of LoVo
tumours was not affected by TMab4-i. Importantly, RT11-i
markedly inhibited the growth of the three oncogenic KRas
mutant tumour xenografts, showing B46–70% more tumour-
growth inhibition
(TGI) (Fig. 6a)
and B42–63% greater
reduction in tumour weight, compared to those after treatment
with TMab4-i (Supplementary Fig. 10b). However, in case of
RasWT Colo320DM tumours, no significant difference was
observed in anti-tumour efficacy between RT11-i and TMab4-i.
During the antibody treatments the mice did not exhibit any
significant body weight loss (Supplementary Fig. 10c). Thus, the
additional anti-tumour activity of RT11-i for Ras mutant tumours
could be ascribed to the blocking activity of oncogenic Ras
signalling. The in vivo sensitivity of the tumours to RT11-i was in
the following order: HT1080 (B70% TGI)4SW480 (B56%
TGI)4LoVo (B46% TGI), which roughly correlated with
in vitro colony formation assay results (Fig. 4f), indicating their
different dependency on oncogenic Ras signalling.
The examination of excised tumour tissues following treatment
showed co-localization of RT11-i with oncogenic Ras mutants at
the inner plasma membrane of tumour cells, whereas TMab4-i
was observed only in the cytoplasmic regions without co-
localization with Ras mutants (Fig. 6c and Supplementary
Fig. 11a). This result indicates that RT11-i is bioavailable
in vivo inside the cytosol of tumour cells after systemic
intravenous administration. Compared to those in vehicle- and
TMab4-i-treated tumour tissues, RT11-i-treated tumour tissues

 showed significantly reduced levels of phosphorylated MEK1/2,
ERK1/2 and Akt (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 11b,c) and
decreased staining for the cell proliferation marker Ki-67, as well
as increased apoptosis as measured by TUNEL-staining, only for
oncogenic Ras mutant tumour cells (Supplementary Fig. 11d,e).
Taken together, the above results identified the in vivo anti-
tumour mechanism of RT11-i against oncogenic Ras mutant-
driven tumour growth.
RT11-i overcomes KRas mutation-driven cetuximab resistance.
Oncogenic KRas mutations have been associated with anti-EGFR
antibody resistance in adenocarcinoma such as colon cancer42,43.
We examined whether combined treatment with RT11-i and the
anti-EGFR
antibody
cetuximab
(Erbitux)
could
overcome
cetuximab resistance in colorectal LoVo tumours harbouring
the oncogenic KRasG13D mutation, using a xenograft mouse
model. Biweekly injections of cetuximab alone at a high dose
(50 mg kg–1) or that in combination with TMab4-i only slightly
impaired tumour growth compared to that in vehicle-treated
control mice (Fig. 7a–c), confirming the poor responsiveness of
LoVo xenografts to cetuximab treatment44. However, combined
treatment of cetuximab plus RT11-i dramatically retarded
tumour growth and increased mouse survival, by B16 d,
compared to those in mice treated with cetuximab alone or
cetuximab plus TMab4-i. Analysis of excised tumour tissues
following
treatment
revealed
that
combined
treatment
dramatically reduced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt, and
STAT3, compared to that with cetuximab alone treatment
(Fig. 7d). These results suggest that RT11-i inhibits oncogenic
KRas mutant-driven signalling, thereby overcoming cetuximab
resistance in KRas mutant colorectal tumours.
Discussion
Many disease-associated intracellular proteins have been con-
sidered undruggable using conventional antibody regimens. In
this study, we demonstrated that intracellular oncogenic Ras
mutants could be directly targeted, to block their function, from
outside of living cells using RT11/RT11-i iMab antibodies.

 Systemic administration of RT11-i resulted in significant growth
inhibition and apoptosis in oncogenic Ras mutant-harbouring
tumour xenografts in mice, without significant toxicity to RasWT-
carrying tumours. This implies its therapeutic potential as an
anti-cancer antibody specific for oncogenic Ras mutant tumours.
Importantly, our study illustrates the development of a new class
of antibody, iMab, the action of which can be dissected into four
sequential steps: (1) tumour homing by targeting tumour-
associated cell surface-expressed proteins after systemic admin-
istration, (2) internalization by receptor-mediated endocytosis
into targeted tumour cells, (3) cytosolic localization owing to their
ability to escape from early endosomes, and (4) specific binding to
a targeted cytosolic protein to block its function.
The RT11 iMab was generated by integrating the Ras � GTP-
specific binding VH domain with the cytosol-penetrating VL
fragment to form a single IgG format antibody. Competition
screening with KRasG12D � GppNHp in the presence of excess
amounts
of
KRasG12D � GDP
as
a
competitor
resulted
in
successful isolation of VH-dependent active Ras form–specific
RT11, which selectively binds to active forms of both WT and
oncogenic mutants of KRas, NRas, and HRas with similar
affinities, but not to GDP-bound inactive forms (Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Table 1). Importantly, the binding sites of RT11
were mapped to the switch I and switch II regions of the GTP-
bound active Ras form, which are conformationally distinct from
the GDP-bound inactive forms, namely the commonly shared
PPI interfaces of oncogenic Ras mutants with the effector
proteins1,2,6. This epitope identification explains how RT11/
RT11-i competitively blocks the physical interactions between
activated Ras and its effector proteins, leading to inhibition of

 downstream signalling mediated by Ras-effector PPIs, such as
Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 and PI3K-Akt pathways (Fig. 3e,f and
Supplementary Fig. 11). These results suggest that blocking
Ras � GTP–effector protein PPIs is the molecular mechanism of
action for RT11/RT11-i iMabs. Because the four Ras proteins
(KRas4A, KRas4B, HRas and NRas) differ markedly in their
C-terminal hypervariable regions, but share almost identical PPI
interfaces in the switch regions1,13, RT11/RT11-i is anticipated to
exhibit broad specificity to the oncogenic Ras mutants. This was
shown using KRas, NRas, and HRas mutants with predominant
oncogenic mutations at G12, G13 or Q61 residues (Fig. 1c and
Supplementary Fig. 7c). This reasoning was further supported by
the anti-proliferative effect of RT11/RT11-i on a panel of tumour
cells, including colorectal, pancreatic, and lung carcinoma,
fibrosarcoma, and leukemia, harbouring diverse oncogenic Ras
mutations (Figs 3a and 4f and Supplementary Figs 5 and 7e,f).
The binding characteristics of RT11/RT11-i will ultimately
broaden its therapeutic applications through the comprehensive
targeting of various oncogenic Ras mutants.
For systemic in vivo applications, the RGD10 peptide-fused
RT11-i
was
generated
for
tumour
tissue
homing
ability,
via targeting tumour-associated integrin avb3 and/or avb5
(refs 39,40). RT11-i exhibited selective binding to the cell
surface-expressed
integrin
avb3/avb5
while
retaining
the
binding
specificity
of
RT11
to
active
Ras
after
cellular
internalization. Importantly, when intravenously administered,
RT11-i demonstrated reasonable serum half-life and preferential
accumulation in tumour tissue (Fig. 5). RT11-i might exert some
anti-tumour activity due to the RGD10-mediated integrin
blocking
activity39,40,
particularly
for
integrin
avb3/avb5-
overexpressing tumour cells, based on the effects of TMab4-i
on SW480 and HT1080 xenograft tumours (Fig. 6a,b). However,
RT11-i as a single agent exhibited measurable anti-tumour
activity via the oncogenic Ras-specific blocking mechanism,
showing a B46–70% more TGI, when compared to treatment
with TMab4-i, in mice harbouring oncogenic KRas mutant
SW480 and LoVo tumours as well as NRas mutant HT1080
tumours, but not in those harbouring RasWT tumours (Fig. 6),
without systemic toxicity (Supplementary Fig. 10c). Furthermore,
in xenograft mouse models,
RT11-i sensitized
cetuximab-
resistant,
KRasG13D
mutant
colorectal
LoVo
tumours
to
cetuximab by inhibiting the bypass oncogenic KRas mutant
signalling (Fig. 7). This suggests that the combination of RT11-i
and an anti-EGFR antibody might be an effective clinical strategy
for patients with advanced colon cancer harbouring oncogenic
KRas mutations. Since the RT11-i iMab has many desirable
features of conventional IgG antibodies, including the capacity for
large-scale manufacturing, systemic administration and long
serum half life, it has great potential to be developed as a first-
in-class anticancer antibody.
Nonetheless, the in vivo anti-tumour activity of RT11-i is not
very potent as a single agent, and requires frequent dosing at
relatively high concentrations for significant suppression of
tumour growth (Fig. 6). Thus RT11-i should be further
engineered to improve potency for practical clinical studies. For
this purpose, the endosome escape efficiency (currently B4.3%)
of RT11-i after receptor-mediated endocytosis requires improve-
ment to achieve sufficient cytosolic localization to address
relatively high cellular concentrations (0.4–1.6 mM) of Ras45.
Such RT11-i derivative can be generated by incorporating the
recently engineered cytosol-penetrating TMab4 VL variant with
Bthreefold improved endosomal escape efficiency (B13%)24.
Furthermore, affinity maturation of RT11-i against the active
form of oncogenic Ras mutants (currently 4–17 nM) will be
necessary to increase the efficiency of blocking Ras � GTP–effector
PPIs.
In conclusion, our results demonstrate the feasibility of
developing antibody therapeutics that directly target cytosolic
proteins involved in disease-associated PPIs, such as oncogenic
Ras mutants, by systemic administration, similar to conventional
therapeutic antibody regimens. Our work also provides an
innovative antibody platform technology, iMab, which can extend
the antibody target space to cytosolic proteins from the current
limits of only extracellular proteins.
Methods
Antibodies. Antibodies used as reagents in this study are listed in Supplementary
Table 3.
Protein expression and purification. Plasmids including pGEX-3X-HRasG12V,
encoding human HRasG12V, and pEF-BOS-HA-KRasG12V, encoding human
KRasG12V, were kindly provided by Professor T.H. Rabbitts (St James’s University
Hospital, UK)20 and Prof T. Kataoka (Kobe University, Japan)9, respectively.
Human NRas (clone ID hMU009336), RRas (clone ID hMU001042), Rac1 (clone
ID KU000510), RasGAP (RASA1) (clone ID hMU002576) genes were purchased
from Korea human gene bank of Medical Genomics Research Center (KRIBB,
Korea). Human MRas (residues 1–208, Genebank accession code: NM_012219.4),
cRafRBD (residues 1–149, GeneBank accession code: NM_002880.2), and
RalGDSRBD (residues 788-885, GeneBank accession code: NM_006266) genes were
prepared by DNA synthesis (Bioneer Inc., Korea). For the bacterial expression of
KRasWT (residues 1–188), HRasWT (residues 1–189), and NRasWT (residues
1–189) and their oncogenic mutants, cRafRBD (residues 1–149), and RalGDSRBD
(residues 788-885), the respective gene fragment was cloned in frame into
pGEX-3X vector (GE Healthcare) to be expressed in the N-terminal GST-fused
form. The GST-fused proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3)plysE cells and
purified using Glutathione-Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare) according to the
manufacturer’s. The purified GST-fused Ras proteins were used in ELISA, surface
plasmon resonance and/or GTPase assays. For the bacterial expression of
KRasG12D (residues 1–169)8, its alanine-scanning mutants, MRas (residues 1–208),
RRas (residues 1–218), and Rac1 (residues 1–177), the respective gene fragment
was cloned into pET23 vector (Novagen) to be expressed in the N-terminal 6 �
His-fused form. The His-fused proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3)plysE
cells and purified using Ni-NTA resin (Clontech) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The purified His-fused KRasG12D (residues 1–169) was used for
antibody library screening by MACS and FACS, competition ELISA with cRafRBD
and RalGDSRBD for KRas binding, and/or antibody epitope mapping studies. The
purified His-fused MRas, RRas, and Rac1 were used for ELISA. For mammalian
expression of RasGAP, a DNA encoding the catalytic domain of RasGAP (residues
714–1047) was cloned in frame into pSecTag2A vector (Invitrogen)22 to be
expressed in the N-terminal 6 � His-fused form. The plasmid was transiently
transfected into HEK293F cell culture in Freestyle 293F media (Invitrogen)
following the standard protocol22,24. RasGAP was purified using
Ni-NTA resin (Clontech). Protein concentrations were determined using a
Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) kit (Pierce, 23225) and by measuring the absorbance
at 280 nm.
Preparation of GppNHp- or GDP-loaded Ras proteins. Ras protein was loaded
with the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue GppNHp (Sigma-Aldrich, G0635) or
GDP (Millipore, 20–177) following the previously reported protocol30,46. For
GppNHp loading, the purified Ras protein was incubated with a 20-fold molar
excess of GppNHp in exchange buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM
(NH4)2SO4, 10 mM ZnCl2, 5 mM DTT) containing alkaline phosphatase beads
(2 units per mg of Ras protein) for 1 h at 25 �C with gentle agitation. The reaction
mixture was then centrifuged to pellet the alkaline phosphatase beads and the
supernatant was taken. For GDP loading, the purified Ras protein was incubated
with a 20-fold molar excess of GDP in Ras storage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,
1 mM DTT, 2 mM MgCl2) containing 20 mM EDTA for 30 min at 30 �C and
further incubated for 30 min at 4 �C after adding 60 mM MgCl2 to the buffer.
To remove the excess unbound GppNHp or GDP from the reaction mixture, the
sample was applied to a PD10 Sephadex G25 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated
with Ras storage buffer according to the manufacturer’s instructions and elution
fraction was collected. For the antibody screening probe, KRasG12D � GppNHp was
further biotinylated using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Thermo Scientific, #21217)
in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions47.
Screening of yeast antibody library against KRasG12D . GppNHp. Yeast strains
and media composition have been previously described25,48,49. The synthetic
human HC library displayed in the format of VH library-CH1 on the surface of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae JAR200 haploid cells with mating type a (MATa) was
used25,49. For HC haploid library screening against KRasG12D � GppNHp, one
round of MACS and then one round of FACS were sequentially performed using 1
and 0.5 mM of biotinylated KRasG12D � GppNHp in the presence of 10-fold excess
molar concentrations of non-biotinylated KRasG12D � GDP as a competitor25,47,48.

 After the first round of FACS, the enriched HC yeast haploid library cells were
mated with the other mating type of S. cerevisiae YVH10 cells (MATa) that
secreted a fixed LC with the VL-CL (LC constant domain) of TMab4 to generate an
enriched Fab library on the diploid yeast cells, as illustrated in Fig. 1b. The mated
diploid Fab library was screened by FACS using conditions that were more
stringent: 0.1 mM KRasG12D � GppNHp and 5 mM competitor (1:50 competition) in
round 2, 0.1 mM KRasG12D � GppNHp and 10 mM competitor (1:100 competition)
in round 3. The binding level of biotinylated KRasG12D � GppNHp was observed
by Streptavidin-conjugated R-phycoerythrin (SA-PE) (Thermo Scientific, S-21388,
dilution 1: 600). Typically the top 0.5–1% of target-binding cells was sorted. The
final sorted yeast cells were plated on selective medium and individual clones were
isolated. The VH gene from selected diploid yeast cells was amplified by colony
PCR for sequencing25,49.
Affinity maturation of RT4. Three kinds of HC libraries were generated focusing
on VH-CDRs of RT4 by performing serial overlapping PCRs47, as illustrated in
Supplementary Fig. 2. Since VH-CDR3 tends to locate near to the center of the
antigen-antibody interface50, three distinct HC libraries, dubbed library 6, 7 and 9,
with the length variation of 6, 7, and 9 residues of VH-CDR3, respectively, were
designed mutating each residue with a degenerate codon NNK, which encodes all
20 amino acid with a reduced stop codon frequency48. In addition, in all three HC
libraries, the exposed residues of VH-CDR1 (residues 31–33), VH-CDR2 (residues
50, 52–56) were commonly randomized, while maintaining the original amino
acids of RT4 at a level ofB50% at each residue, using designed oligomers47,51. For
the yeast surface-displayed HC library, each amplified VH gene library (12 mg) and
linearized yeast surface display vector pYDS-H (4 mg) were co-transformed four
times into S. cerevisiae JAR200 strain by a homologous recombination technique
using a BioRad Gene Pulser II model #1652108 (refs 25,48,49). The diversities of
library 6, 7, and 9, determined by plating serial 10-fold dilutions of the transformed
cells onto selective agar plates, were B4.6 � 108, 2.0 � 108 and 2.4 � 108,
respectively. The library screening was conducted as described above under more
stringent competition screening conditions.
Construction of antibody expression plasmids. The isolated VH gene was
subcloned, in-frame without additional amino acids, into Not1/ApaI sites of
pcDNA 3.4-TMab4-HC carrying the human IgG1 constant domain sequence
(CH1-hinge-CH2-CH3)22 for HC expression. For LC expression, the pcDNA
3.4-TMab4-LC plasmid encoding the TMab4 VL and Ck constant domain
sequences (residues 108–214) was used22. For LC expression of RGD10-fused
TMab4-i and RT11-i antibodies, the synthesized DNA encoding the RGD10
peptide (DGARYCRGDCFDG)39 and (G4S)2 linker was subcloned, in frame
without additional amino acids, at the N-terminus of TMab4 VL using the
NotI/BsiWI site of pcDNA 3.4-TMab4-LC, generating pcDNA 3.4-TMab4-iLC.
All the constructs were confirmed by sequencing (Macrogen, Inc.).
Expression and purification of antibodies. The plasmids encoding HC and LC
were transiently co-transfected in pairs, at equivalent molar ratios, into HEK293F
cell cultures in Freestyle 293F media (Invitrogen) following the standard proto-
col22,52. Culture supernatants were collected after 5–7 d by centrifugation and
filtration (0.22 mm, Polyethersulfone, Corning, CL S43118). Antibodies were
purified from the culture supernatants using a protein-A agarose chromatography
column (GE Healthcare) and were extensively dialysed to achieve a final buffer
composition of PBS (pH 6.5). The anti-EGFR mAb cetuximab (Erbitux) was
expressed and purified52,53. Before cell treatments, antibodies were sterilized by
filtration using a cellulose acetate membrane filter (0.22 mm, Corning). Antibody
concentrations were determined using the Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) kit and by
measuring the absorbance at 280 nm (refs 22,52).
Surface Plasmon Resonance. Kinetic interactions between antibodies and Ras
proteins were measured at 25 �C using Biacore 2000 surface plasmon resonance
(GE Healthcare)47,52. RT11 or RT11-i (20 mg ml–1) antibodies in Na-acetate
(pH 4.5) were immobilized onto the carboxymethylated dextran surface of a CM5
sensor chip at the level of approximately 2,000 response units (RUs). Subsequently,
GppNHp- or GDP-loaded GST-fused KRas (WT, G12D, G12V, G13D, and Q61H),
GST-fused HRas (WT and G12V), and GST-fused NRas (WT and Q61R) proteins,
serially diluted to various concentrations (100–6.25 nM) in running buffer (TBS
(50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mM NaCl), 5 mM MgCl2 and 0.01% (v/v) Tween-
20), were injected over immobilized RT11 or RT11-i at a flow rate of 30 ml min–1
for 3 min with 3 min dissociation per cycle. After each cycle, surfaces were
regenerated with buffer (20 mM NaOH, 1 M NaCl, pH 10.0) for 1 min. The binding
data were normalized by subtracting the response of a blank cell and then globally
fitted using the BIAevaluation software to obtain kinetic interaction parameters.
ELISA. Binding specificity of antibodies to antigens was determined by ELISA. The
96-well EIA/RIA plates (Corning) were coated for 1 h at 25 �C with 5 mg ml–1 of the
indicated antibody and blocked with a blocking solution (TBST (TBS, 0.1% (v/v)
Tween-20), 5 mM MgCl2, 4% (w/v) BSA). After washing with TBST, 100 nM of
GST-fused protein (Ras WT or mutants) or His-fused protein (RRas, MRas, or
Rac1), which was loaded with GppNHp or GDP in the blocking solution, was
applied to each well for 1 h at 25 �C. After washing with TBST, bound protein
was detected by labelling with an HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-GST antibody
(Sigma-Aldrich, A7340, dilution 1:4,000) or HRP-conjugated goat anti-His
antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, A7058, dilution 1:2,000)) and subsequent incubation
with ultra TMB (3,30,5,50-tetramethylbenzidine)-ELISA solution (Thermo
Scientific, 34028). Absorbance was read at 450 nm on a VersaMax microplate
reader (Molecular devices). The results are presented after subtracting the
BSA-coated background control value.
Competition ELISA. Various concentrations of TMab4 or RT11 (1 mM–5.65 pM)
were competed for binding to the respective plate-coated cRafRBD (20 mg ml–1),
RalGDSRBD (200 mg ml–1), or PI3Ka (p110a/p85a, Signalchem, P27-102H)
(10 mg ml–1) for 1 h at 25 �C with excess amount of His-KRasG12D � GppNHp (1 mM
for cRafRBD, 10 mM for RalGDSRBD) or biotinylated His-KRasG12D � GppNHp
(5 mM for PI3Ka). Bound His-KRasG12D � GppNHp and biotinylated His-
KRasG12D � GppNHp were then detected using the HRP-conjugated goat anti-His
antibody and HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Thermo Scientific, 21130, dilution
1:10,000), respectively, as described above. The binding data were processed by
nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad PRISM (GraphPad software, Inc.).
GTPase assay of Ras proteins. GST-fused KRas (WT and G12D mutant) was
loaded with GTP (Sigma-Aldrich, G8877) following the protocol for the prepara-
tion of GppNHp-loaded Ras protein. GTPase activity of Ras proteins was measured
using an EnzCheck phosphate assay kit (Thermo Scientific, E6646) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions27. Briefly, assay buffer only (intrinsic GTPase
activity), indicated antibody (15 mM final concentration) or RasGAP (15 mM final
concentration) was added to a reaction mixture (30 mM GTP-loaded KRas protein
(WT or G12D), 200 mM 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside (MESG),
and 50 U ml–1 purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) in assay buffer (50 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT)) in 96-well half-area microplates (Corning). GTP
hydrolysis was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 (10 mM final concentration). The
absorbance at 360 nm was measured at 20 �C for 20 min at every 10 s interval on a
MULTISKAN GO plate reader (Thermo Scientific). The phosphate concentration
([Pi]t) at each time point was determined by comparison with a phosphate
standard curve and plotted against time. The hydrolysis rate constant (k) was
determined by fitting the data to a single-phase, exponential non-linear regression
curve with the equation [Pi]t ¼ [Pi]0 þ ([Pi]final � [Pi]0) (1 � exp( � kt)) in
GraphPad Prism software27.
Cell lines. The human cell lines, cervix carcinoma HeLa cells, colorectal carcinoma
SW480, LoVo, HT29, and Colo320DM cells, pancreatic carcinoma AsPC-1 and
PANC-1 cells, soft tissue sarcoma HT1080 cells, lung carcinoma H1299, acute
myeloid leukemia HL60 cells, chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells, breast carci-
noma MCF-7 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblast NIH3T3 cells were purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). All cell lines were authen-
ticated by DNA short tandem repeat profiling (ABION CRO, Korea), and used
within 20 passages. HeLa, PANC-1, and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM
(HyClone) medium, and SW480, LoVo, HT29, Colo320DM, AsPC-1, HT1080,
H1299, HL60, K562 and MCF-7 cells were maintained in RPMI1640 (HyClone)
medium. All cells were cultured in growth media that was supplemented with 10%
(v/v) heat-inactivated FBS (HyClone), 100 U ml–1 penicillin, 100 mg ml–1 strepto-
mycin and 0.25 mg ml–1 amphotericin B (HyClone). All cell lines were maintained
at 37 �C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator and routinely screened for Mycoplasma
contamination (CellSafe).
Generation of KRasG12V-expressing NIH3T3 cells. The cDNA fragment
encoding KRasG12V (residues 1–189) was inserted at the C-terminus of mCherry in
pmCherry-C1 plasmid (Clontech)54 and HA in the pcDNA3.1-HA plasmid22 to
generate the expression plasmid for mCherry-KRasG12V and HA-KRasG12V,
respectively. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with the expression plasmid using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Scientific, 11668019) and then selected in media
containing 0.8 mg ml–1 G418 (Sigma-Aldrich, A1720) to isolate the stable cell line
expressing mCherry-KRasG12V or HA-KRasG12V.
Cytosolic split GFP complementation assay. To estimate the cytosolic locali-
zation and cytosolic access of antibodies, an enhanced split GFP complementation
assay was performed as specified in the figure legend23,24. TMab4-GFP11-SBP2,

were prepared by co-expression of the respective GFP11-SBP2-fused HC and its
cognate LC in HEK293F cells, as described above.
Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Cellular internalization and locali-
zation of antibodies in cultured cells were detected by confocal microscopy22,23.
Briefly, cells (5 � 104) that were grown on 12-mm diameter coverslips in 24-well
culture plates were treated with indicated antibodies, as specified in the figure

 anti-human IgG antibody (Invitrogen, A11013, dilution 1:500) for 1 h at 25 �C. Ras
proteins were detected with rabbit anti-Ras antibody (Abcam, ab108602,
dilution 1:100) and subsequently with TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody
(Sigma-Aldrich, T6778, dilution 1:250) for 1 h at 25 �C. The nucleus was stained
with Hoechst 33342 in PBS for 5 min at 25 �C. After mounting the coverslips onto
glass slides with Perma Fluor aqueous mounting medium (Thermo Scientific,
TA-030-FM), center-focused single z-section images were obtained on a Zeiss
LSM710 system with ZEN software (Carl Zeiss).
Western blotting. Indicated cells (3 � 105 cells per well) were seeded in six-well
plates, cultured overnight, and then treated with the conditions specified in the
figure legends. Western blotting was performed using specific antibodies following
the standard procedure22,53. For quantification of western blotting data, band
intensities were quantified using ImageJ software and normalized to values of the
loading control. The phosphorylation levels of proteins were normalized to the
total levels of each protein, equivalently loaded on SDS–PAGE gels55. Relative band
intensity was expressed as a ratio compared to the value of the corresponding
control. The original scans of western blots are provided as Supplementary Fig. 12.
Immunoprecipitation. To exclude the possibility of IP by antibodies released from
endosomes during cell lysis, IP experiments were performed with endosome-
depleted cell lysates, which were prepared by removal of early and late endosomes
from the cell lysates using density gradient centrifugation56. Indicated cells (1 � 108
cells per well in 100-mm dish) were treated with PBS buffer or 2 mM of indicated
antibodies for 12 h at 37 �C. The cells were washed twice for 30 s at 25 �C with low-
pH glycine buffer (200 mM glycine, 150 mM NaCl, pH 2.5) and were then
homogenized on ice with homogenization buffer (250 mM sucrose, 3 mM
imidazole, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2 and protease inhibitors
(Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Thermo Scientific, 78440)) and adjusted to 40.6%
sucrose concentration by adding 62% sucrose (1:1.2 v/v). Discontinuous sucrose
gradients were established in ultracentrifuge tubes with 2 ml homogenates
containing 40.6% sucrose, subsequently overlaid with 3 ml of 35% sucrose, 2 ml of
25% sucrose and 5 ml of homogenization buffer. Sucrose gradients were
centrifuged in an SW41 swinging-bucket rotor (Beckman) at 100,000g for 3 h at
4 �C. After centrifugation, the endosome-depleted fractions were collected from the
bottom of each gradient by puncturing with a needle (26½-gauge). Late endosomes
and lysosomes were found on the interface between 25% sucrose and
homogenization buffer, whereas early endosomes and carrier vesicles were at the
35–25% interphase. The removal of endosomal fractions from the whole cell lysates
was assessed by monitoring Rab5, an early endosome marker22. The endosome-
depleted cell lysates were mixed and incubated for 30 min on ice with Ras IP buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 10% glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2
and protease inhibitors)55. The endosome-depleted cell lysates were then subjected
to IP for 2 h at 4 �C with protein A agarose to pull down the antibodies (TMab4,
RT11, TMab4-i, and RT11-i), anti-HA antibody (Covance, MMS-101 P), and
subsequent incubation with Protein A/G agarose (Santa Cruz, sc-2003) to pull
down HA-KRasG12V proteins, or cRafRBD-immobilized agarose beads (Merck
Millipore, 14–278) to pull down the GTP-bound active Ras proteins. The
complexes were subsequently washed with lysis buffer and equal precipitates were
analysed by western blotting with b-actin as a loading control53,55.
Cell proliferation assay. Cells, seeded at a density of 1 � 104 cells per well in
24-well plates, were cultured for 24 h, and then treated twice, at time 0 and 72 h,
with the indicated concentrations of antibodies or the pharmacological inhibitor
(sorafenib (Selleckchem, S7397) or LY294002 (Millipore, 440202)) for 6 d, as
specified in the figure legend. After the 6 d incubation, cells were collected and
viable cells were counted by trypan blue staining. The results are presented as the
percentage of viable cells relative to that of the PBS-treated control53.
Soft agar colony formation assay. Cells (1 � 103) in 0.5 ml of DMEM or
RPMI1640 containing 10% (v/v) FBS and 0.35% (w/v) SeaPlaque agarose were
overlaid onto bottom agar consisting of 0.5 ml of DMEM or RPMI1640 containing
10% (v/v) FBS and 0.6% (w/v) agarose in a 12-well culture plate57. The cells were
incubated at 37 �C and treated with 2 mM of antibodies in growth medium every
72 h for 14–21 d. Following treatment, the cell colonies were stained by BCIP/NBT
(5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/Nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma-Aldrich,
B5655)), photographed, and analysed with ImageJ software. Colonies with a
diameter 4200 mm were counted.
Intracellular KRasG12V-cRafRBD interaction inhibition assay. The ability of
RT11 to interrupt physical interactions between activated KRas and effector
proteins in living cells was monitored by analysing the subcellular localization of
eGFP-tagged cRafRBD protein in KRasG12V-harbouring SW480 cells10,58. To
construct a plasmid encoding the eGFP-fused cRafRBD protein, cRafRBD (residues
51–220) was inserted at the C-terminus of eGFP in pEGFP-C2 (Clontech). SW480
cells were transfected with the eGFP-cRafRBD-expression plasmid using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After three passages under selection with
3 mg ml–1 G418, the cells were treated with antibodies at the indicated doses for
12 h at 37 �C in serum-free media. After two washes with PBS, the cells were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 25 �C. After staining the nucleus
with Hoechst 33342 in PBS for 5 min at 25 �C, center-focused single z-section
images were obtained by confocal microscopy as described above23,53.
Xenograft tumour models. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal
and Ethics Review Committee of Ajou University and performed in accordance
with the guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee53. The approval ID for using the animals was No. 2015-0003 by the
Animal Core Facility of Ajou University. For xenograft tumour models, 4-week-
old, female, BALB/c athymic nude mice (NARA bio, Korea) weighing 17–20 g were
inoculated subcutaneously into the right thigh with SW480 (5 � 106 cells per
mouse), LoVo (2 � 106 cells per mouse), HT1080 (3 � 106 cells per mouse),
or Colo320DM (5 � 106 cells per mouse) cells in 150 ml of a 1:1 mixture of
PBS/Matrigel (BD Biosciences, 354234). When the mean tumour volume reached
approximately 80–100 mm3, mice were randomly assigned to treatment cohorts,
and antibodies (TMab4-i and RT11-i) or a PBS vehicle control, as specified in the
figure legend, were administered intravenously via the tail vein, in a dose/weight-
matched manner. The cetuximab dose for all experiments was 50 mg kg–1
intraperitoneally twice weekly. Tumour volumes and body weight were recorded at
regular intervals until tumours reached approximately 1,000 mm3, at which time
mice were killed. Tumour volume (V) was evaluated using digital calipers and
estimated by the formula V ¼ L � W2/2, where L and W are the long and short
lengths of the tumour, respectively53. Tumour growth inhibition (TGI) by RT11-i
compared to that by TMab4-i was determined on the last day of the study
according to the formula: TGI (%)¼ (100 � (Vf
RT11-i–Vi
RT11-i)/(Vf
TMab4-i–Vi
TMab4-i)
� 100), where Vi is the initial mean tumour volume in the RT11-i or TMab4-i
treatment group, and Vf is the final mean tumour volume in the RT11-i or TMab4-i
treatment group, as indicated by the superscript notation44. Mice were killed with
CO2 asphyxiation, and some tumours were collected for histological analysis.
Immunofluorescence microscopy of tumour tissues. The extracted tumours
from mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 �C, cryoprotected in
30% sucrose for 24 h, and then frozen in OCT embedding medium (Tissue-Tek).
For immunofluorescence staining, 20-mm thick cryosections were prepared and
incubated with blocking solution (2% (w/v) BSA in PBS) for 1 h at 25 �C. Tissue
sections were incubated with specific primary antibodies overnight at 4 �C, washed
three times with PBST (PBS pH 7.4, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20) for 10 min, and then
incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h at 25 �C. Apoptotic cells
were detected by a standard TUNEL assay using the DeadEnd Fluorometric
TUNEL System (Promega). The nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 for 5 min
at 25 �C. After tissue sections were washed three times with PBST and mounted on
slides with Perma Fluor aqueous mounting medium, center-focused single z-sec-
tion images were obtained on a Zeiss LSM710 system with ZEN software
(Carl Zeiss). Using the acquired fluorescence images from each tissue, the
fluorescence intensity and number of positively stained cells were quantified using
ImageJ software and presented as the relative percent staining compared to that of
the PBS-treated control.
Pharmacokinetic studies in mice. Female BALB/c nude mice, between 4 and 6
weeks old, received a single injection of 20 mg kg–1 of the indicated antibodies in a
total volume of 200 ml via the tail vein. In time intervals of 30 min, 1, 4, 8, 12, and
24 h, and 2, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days, blood samples were taken from the tail vein or
retro orbital sinus of CO2-anaesthesized mice (n ¼ 3 per time point) and incubated
for 30 min at 25 �C. Clotted blood was centrifuged at 12,000 r.p.m. for 10 min at
25 �C, and serum samples were stored at –80 �C. Concentrations of human IgG in
the serum samples were determined by ELISA. The 96-well EIA/RIA plates
(Corning) were coated with 5 mg ml–1 of polyclonal goat anti-human IgG (Fab
specific) in PBS at 4 �C overnight. The plates were washed with PBST and blocked
for 1 h with blocking buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 1% (w/v) BSA). Samples, as well as
purified RT11-i and TMab4-i, used as standard controls, were diluted in blocking
buffer and added to the plates with subsequent incubation for 2 h at 25 �C.
After washing with PBST, the bound antibody was detected by incubation with
HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG at a 1:10,000 dilution in blocking buffer for
1 h at 25 �C. After washing with PBST, ultra TMB-ELISA solution was added and
absorbance was read at 450 nm on the VersaMax microplate reader (Molecular
devices). For comparison, the first value (30 min) was set to 100%. Pharmacokinetic
parameters, distribution phase serum half-life (T1/2a), and elimination phase serum
half-life (T1/2b) were calculated by two-phasic nonlinear regression analysis using
GraphPad Prism41,53,59. The serum antibody concentration was also estimated in
molar concentration assuming that the total blood volume of nude mice of
approximately 20 g (body weight) is B2 ml (ref. 60).
Biodistribution imaging in vivo. Antibodies were conjugated with DyLight 755
and purified using a DyLight 755 Antibody Labeling Kit (Thermo Scientific,
84538) in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications. BALB/c athymic
nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously into the right thigh with SW480
(5 � 106 cells per mouse) cells in 150 ml of a 1:1 mixture of PBS/Matrigel. When the
mean tumour volume reached B200 mm3, DyLight 755-labelled antibodies (20 mg)

 were intravenously injected into the mice through the tail vein. Before imaging,
mice were anaesthetized with 1.5–2.5% isoflurane (Piramal Critical Care).
The whole body distribution profiles of antibodies were quantified by in vivo
fluorescence using the IVIS Lumina XRMS Series III (Perkin Elmer) at the
indicated time intervals. After the final scan, tumour tissues (T) and normal organs
(N) were excised and imaged ex vivo. To reduce the effects of tissue
autofluorescence background, manual spectral unmixing was performed and the
fluorescence intensity of an identically sized region of interest was then quantified
by radiant efficiency (photons s � 1 cm � 2 steradian � 1 mW � 1 cm � 2) using Living
Image software (PerkinElmer).
Statistical analysis. Data are represented as the mean±s.d. of triplicate samples
from one representative experiment based on at least three independent experi-
ments, unless otherwise specified. Comparisons of data from tests and controls
were analysed for statistical significance by a 2-tailed, unpaired Student’s t-test
using MS Excel. A one-way analysis of variance with the Newman-Keuls multiple
comparison post hoc test was used to determine significance for in vivo tumour
growth experiments. An animal survival curve and the median survival time were
estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and differences in survival were evaluated
by a Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test using GraphPad Prism software. A P value of
o0.05 was considered significant.
Data reporting. No statistical method was used to pre-determine sample size, but
sample size is similar to sample sizes routinely used in the field. The investigators
were not blinded to allocation during experiments. No samples or animals were
excluded.
Data availability. All data in this study are available within the article and its
Supplementary Files or available from the authors on request.
