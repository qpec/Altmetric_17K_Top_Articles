BACKGROUND: In recent years, high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing for triaging atypical squamous cells of
undetermined significance and cotesting with cytology have been implemented in clinical practice. However, clinical data
for primary screening with human papillomavirus (HPV) testing alone are currently lacking. METHODS: This study retro-
spectively reviewed the correlation of cytology, histology, and hrHPV testing through the use of a cytology laboratory
quality assurance database with 130,648 Papanicolaou (Pap) tests interpreted at Houston BioReference Laboratories and
Houston Methodist Hospital between March 1, 2013 and June 30, 2014. Among the 47,499 patients who had undergone
cytology-HPV cotesting, 1654 underwent follow-up biopsies. RESULTS: The sensitivities of the hrHPV and Pap tests were
80.8% and 81.2%, respectively, for detecting any type of cervicovaginal dysplasia and 91.3% and 90.9%, respectively, for
high-grade cervicovaginal lesions. For biopsy-confirmed high-grade cervicovaginal lesions (cervical intraepithelial neo-
plasia grade 21, adenocarcinoma in situ, or carcinoma; n 5 253), the false-negative rates for hrHPV and Pap tests were
8.7% and 9.1%, respectively. The false-negative rate for cytology-hrHPV cotesting was only 1.2%. CONCLUSIONS: In clini-
cal practice, the hrHPV test alone is not significantly superior to the Pap test as a primary screening method for cervico-
vaginal lesions. The false-negative rate of the hrHPV test in detecting biopsy-confirmed high-grade cervicovaginal lesions
is comparable to the rate of the Pap test. Women with cytology and hrHPV cotesting, however, have a significantly lower
false-negative rate than those undergoing either test alone. Currently, cytology-HPV cotesting remains the best strategy
for detecting high-grade cervicovaginal lesions. Cancer Cytopathol 2016;124:317-23. V

INTRODUCTION
Persistent infections with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) cause most cervical cancers and precancerous
lesions.1 In the past 50 years, the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer have significantly decreased in the
United States as a result of successful cytological cervical cancer screening programs.2 In recent years, human pap-
illomavirus (HPV) testing has been incorporated into the cervical cancer screening and management algorithm to
assist in triaging cases with equivocal cytology (ie, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance
[ASCUS]); HPV testing has also been used in combination with cytology to maximize the detection rate of high-
grade cervical lesions in women who are 30 years old or older.3

Original Article
 Despite the increased integration of hrHPV testing
with cytology in clinical practice, the use of the hrHPV
test alone as an effective and sufficient primary screening
method for cervical cancer remains controversial.4 Recent
studies conducted in Europe and Canada have demon-
strated that primary hrHPV screening exhibits higher sen-
sitivity in detecting precursor lesions of cervical cancer
(cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 [CIN2] and cervi-
cal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 [CIN3]) in comparison
with cytology alone in single and multiple rounds of
screening.5-10 These studies suggest that hrHPV testing
could be effective as a primary screening method.
After Food and Drug Administration approval in
April 2014 of the Cobas HPV test as an option for primary
cervical cancer screening in women who are 25 years old or
older, an interim clinical guideline for using the test was
subsequently published.11 Because of the paucity of data,
this interim guideline was largely based on studies per-
formed in Europe rather than prospective United States–
based studies.12,13 Because of the differences between the
European and US populations in terms of the screening
rates and frequency, HPV genotypic distribution, HPV
vaccination rates, volume of migration/immigration, and
demographics, the data collected from these trials may not
represent the situation in the United States. Therefore,
data from large-scale studies conducted within US popula-
tions are crucial for the evaluation of the performance of
hrHPV testing alone in detecting cervical cancer and pre-
cancerous high-grade cervical lesions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
We retrospectively reviewed 130,648 Papanicolaou (Pap)
tests recorded in our laboratory information system data-
base from March 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014, and we identi-
fied 47,499 cases that had undergone hrHPV cotesting
with the Cobas 4800 system (Roche Molecular Diagnos-
tics, Pleasanton, Calif). Among the cases subjected to
cotesting, 1654 had sufficient and interpretable follow-up
biopsy samples. This is a routine quality assurance (QA)
process performed at our laboratory as mandated by the
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988
(CLIA’88) and the Laboratory Accreditation Program
(LAP) of the College of American Pathologists (CAP).
Patient Population and Pap Tests
The ages of the patients who had undergone Pap and
HPV cotesting with follow-up biopsies ranged from 15.6
to 94.5 years (mean, 37.9 years). All Pap tests were per-
formed with liquid-based methods: 52.4% (867 cases)
with ThinPrep and 47.6% (787 cases) with SurePath. The
cytological data acquired by our laboratory were bench-
marked with the CAP database as required by the CAP
LAP.
Biopsy Confirmation
Board-certified cytopathologists or gynecology pathologists
at Houston Methodist Hospital performed the cytological
interpretations. The follow-up biopsies were performed
within 1 year of the cytology-HPV cotesting. Lesions equal
to or higher than CIN2 were considered high-grade
lesions. Immunohistochemical staining for p16/Ki-67 was
performed in all possible CIN2 lesions, and an interpreta-
tion of CIN2 was rendered only if the p16/Ki-67 immu-
nostain was supportive. Cases with both a positive Pap or
HPV test and biopsy-confirmed high-grade cervical lesions
(CIN2 and higher) were defined as true-positives. Cases
with a negative Pap or HPV test and biopsy-confirmed
high-grade cervical lesions (CIN2 and higher) were defined
as false-negatives. Real-time histological-cytological correla-
tions were performed at the time of the biopsy sign-out;
this is our routine clinical practice and fulfills the mandates
of CLIA’88 required by the CAP LAP. The numbers from
the laboratory information system were tabulated annually
for reporting purposes to the CAP LAP.
Statistical Analysis
The test sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI]) was cal-
culated, and the McNemar test was used to compare the
HPV and Pap tests. All calculations were performed with
STATA 14 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas).
Institutional Review Board Approval
The institutional review board at Houston Methodist Hos-
pital approved this retrospective QA study.

 CAP LAP. Table 1 shows the cytology reporting data
determined by the ThinPrep method, and Table 2 shows
the cytology reporting data determined by the SurePath
method. Each table indicates our cytology reporting per-
formance in comparison with the CAP benchmarking
data. As mandated by the CAP LAP, our results are within
the 5% to 95% range of reported rates.
HPV Reporting Rates
In our laboratory, the positive hrHPV reporting rates with
the Pap tests that were found to be negative for intraepithe-
lial lesion or malignancy (NILM) and ASCUS were similar
to those for the general population with both ThinPrep
(6.9% and 30.5%, respectively) and SurePath (8.5% and
31.6%, respectively).
Biopsy Diagnoses
In this general screening population, the high-grade squa-
mous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) reporting rate was
0.24%, and there was consistent cytohistological correla-
tion in 70% of the cases. The majority of cases with uncor-
related data were due to tissue-sampling variances (98%).

HPV Test for Detecting High-Grade Lesions/Zhou et al
Cancer Cytopathology
May 2016

 The biopsy samples revealed benign tissue or lesions (n 5
634), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs)
encompassing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1
(CIN1) and HPV effects (n 5 765), HSILs (including
239 cases of CIN2/CIN3 and 5 cases of vaginal intraepi-
thelial neoplasia grade 2/3), squamous cell carcinomas
(n 5 3), adenocarcinomas in situ (n 5 6), and endome-
trial adenocarcinomas (n 5 2). The 2 cases of endometrial
adenocarcinoma were excluded from the study because
they were not considered HPV-driven tumors and, as
expected, tested negative for hrHPV. Lesions interpreted to
be equal to or higher than CIN2 were considered high-
grade lesions (n 5 253). The following analyses were based
on the aforementioned 1652 cases with cytology and HPV
testing and follow-up biopsies.
Sensitivities of the HPV Test and Cytology
in Detecting All Dysplastic Lesions
The correlations of the HPV and Pap tests with high-grade
lesions confirmed by biopsies are summarized in Tables 3
and 4. Among the 1652 cases with cytology, HPV testing,
and
follow-up
biopsies,
1018
cases
had
histology-
confirmed dysplastic lesions (LSIL and higher). The Pap
test detected 827 of the 1018 cases (sensitivity, 81.2%;
95% CI, 78.7%-83.6%), and the HPV test detected 823
of the 1018 cases (sensitivity, 80.8%; 95% CI, 78.3%-
83.2%). The sensitivities of the HPV test and cytology
alone were nearly the same with no statistically significant
difference (P 5 .86).
Sensitivities of the HPV Test and Cytology
in the Detection of High-Grade Lesions
Among the 1652 cases with cytology-HPV cotesting and
follow-up biopsies, 253 cases had histology-confirmed
high-grade lesions. The Pap test detected 230 of the 253
cases with a sensitivity of 90.9% (95% CI, 86.7%-94.1%),
whereas the HPV test was positive in 231 of the 253 cases
with a sensitivity of 91.3% (95% CI, 87.1%-94.5%).
There was no statistically significant difference (P 5 1.0)
between the sensitivities of the Pap and HPV tests in
detecting biopsy-confirmed high-grade lesions.
Table 5 shows the breakdown of the data for the 253
biopsy-confirmed high-grade lesions with results from HPV
tests and cytological diagnoses. Twenty-three of the 253
high-grade lesions (9.1%) were interpreted as NILM with
the Pap test, and 22 (8.7%) were negative for the HPV test
after the 2 cases of HPV-negative endometrial cancer were
excluded. In contrast, only 3 of the 253 cases (1.2%) were
double-negatives for both the Pap and HPV tests.
DISCUSSION
Our clinical study was conducted within a large general
screening population in the Houston area with hrHPV
prevalence and HSIL reporting rates similar to those of the
general populations reported in other established trials and
surveys in the United States.14 It is notable that in this

 group, the HPV reporting rates of ASCUS and NILM
were particularly close to those found in the Addressing the
Need for Advanced HPV Diagnostics (ATHENA) trial.12
The cytology reporting performance in our laboratory
benchmarked well with the nationally published CAP data-
base. This is a routine QA activity of all cytological labora-
tories performing gynecologic cytology, and it is mandated
under CLIA’88.
Several investigators consider HPV testing more sen-
sitive than cytomorphology in detecting cervicovaginal dys-
plasia.5-10,12 The rationale is based on the following
assumptions: 1) cervical dysplasia is a fundamentally HPV-
driven lesion, 2) the signal amplification and polymerase
chain reaction–based assays are more sensitive than the
morphology-based Pap test, and 3) HPV infection com-
monly precedes observable morphological changes. In sev-
eral large trials, it has been shown that polymerase chain
reaction–based HPV tests yield higher negative predictive
values than cytology.5-10,12 However, the results from the
current clinical QA database do not support the notion
because the hrHPV test alone was not superior to cytology
in detecting high-grade cervicovaginal lesions. In our group
of 1652 cases, the sensitivities of the HPV and Pap tests in
detecting any dysplastic or high-grade lesions on follow-up
biopsies were similar with no statistically significant differ-
ences (80.8% vs 81.2% for any dysplastic lesions, P 5 .86;
91.3% vs 90.9% for high-grade lesions, P 5 1.0).
The underlying reasons for not detecting a relatively
high percentage of biopsy-confirmed high-grade cervicova-
ginal lesions with the HPV test are not known. Several
potential contributing factors may include low viral loads,
sampling issues, interference from chemicals in the fixative,
technical errors, the exclusion of causative HPV genotypes
from the test panel, or truly non–HPV-driven lesions. It is
important to note that HPV testing depends on the pres-
ence of a sufficient amount of viral components shed from
infected cells in the sample (the sensitivities and targeting
viral elements vary among the HPV tests). In individuals
with persistent HPV infections, the viral DNA may even-
tually be integrated into the host genome; this can signifi-
cantly reduce the viral load in cervical specimens.
Although most cervical cancer cases are believed to be
caused by persistent hrHPV infections, HPV is not always
detected before the diagnosis of cancer. A recent study
indicated that only 91% of cervical squamous cell carcino-
mas were HPV-positive according to the Linear Array
HPV genotyping test.15 In another study, Zhao et al16
demonstrated that 9% to 25% of patients with squamous
cell carcinoma had negative HPV test results (according to
various testing methods) in the preceding 1 to 5 years. The
data from the Kaiser Permanente study showed that 37%
of women with cervical squamous cell carcinoma were
HPV-negative 5 years before the histological diagnosis of
cervical cancer.17 In 2015, Blatt et al18 published an
extended study involving 256,648 cases with cytological
and HPV cotesting. The authors demonstrated that 19%
of the women with cervical cancer can be misdiagnosed if
HPV cervical screening is the only detection method. In
our opinion, the cases missed by HPV testing (despite the
variety of detection methods) can be attributed to the
amounts of HPV elements being undetectable for the test-
ing method used. Moreover, at the latter stage of HPV
infection involving viral DNA integration into the host
genome, the lesion cells may have accumulated sufficient
genetic hits for uncontrolled proliferation that does not
require the continuous HPV replication needed in the
early stages of HPV infection. The unexpectedly low sensi-
tivity of the HPV test in detecting high-grade cervicovagi-
nal lesions may also be attributed to the fact that the
causative HPV genotypes are not tested in the given HPV
test panel; although the panel includes the so-called
hrHPV genotypes, many other HPV genotypes can also
cause cervicovaginal lesions, including high-grade dyspla-
sia. Our previous study showed that HPV-90, a rare geno-
type that had not been previously reported in the United
States, was detected in as many as 3.9% of women in a
high-risk group and was associated with cervical dysplasia
in 9.6% of women infected solely with this genotype.19 In
2009, the International Agency for Research on Cancer
placed this genotype into group 3 (unknown oncogenic
potential) on the basis of limited data. It is possible that in
the future, some HPV genotypes previously considered “of
unknown oncogenic potential” or “low-risk” could be
determined to be causative agents of high-grade cervicova-
ginal lesions. The incidence of cervicovaginal lesions
related to these less common HPV genotypes could
increase with HPV vaccination against HPV-16 and HPV-
18. It is evident that the HPV test alone for hrHPV detec-
tion will not cover all HPV genotypes causing cervicovagi-
nal lesions.
In addition, several cervical cancers with prior or cur-
rent negative HPV tests may be not HPV-driven malig-
nancies but instead HPV-independent cancers, including a
group of rare cervical cancer subtypes: minimal deviation

 adenocarcinomas, gastric and intestinal carcinomas, and
mesonephric and clear cell carcinomas.16 Austin and Zhao
proposed that a very small number of cervical cancers with
negative HPV test results could be due to the performance
of HPV testing beyond the HPV infection period in cervi-
cal carcinomas with a rapid growth phase.20
Although the Pap test is mainly designed for cervical
cancer screening, endometrial preneoplastic lesions and
cancers and other uterine malignancies and metastatic
tumors are sometimes detected with the Pap test, which
adds the benefits of cytological screening. These malignan-
cies are unrelated to HPV infection and, therefore, are not
detected by HPV testing. In the current study, the 2 cases
of endometrioid adenocarcinoma missed by HPV tests
were detected by the Pap test. The increasing rates of obe-
sity in young women in North America render the detec-
tion of atypical endometrial cells increasingly important.
Among the cases with biopsy-confirmed high-grade
cervicovaginal lesions (CIN2/CIN3, vaginal intraepithelial
neoplasia grade 2/3, adenocarcinoma in situ, or carcinoma;
n 5 253), the false-negative rates were 8.7% for the HPV
test and 9.1% for cytology. The HPV false-negative rate of
our study is comparable to the rates of other published
studies,21-24 in which the HPV false-negative rates were
approximately 10%. Co-evaluation with both cytological
and HPV tests had a significantly lower false-negative rate
(1.2%) in comparison with either HPV testing or cytology
alone; this finding suggests that the 2 tests are complemen-
tary in detecting high-grade cervical lesions. Our data
strongly support the view that currently cytology-HPV
cotesting is the best strategy for screening women who are
30 years old or older. This strategy is currently endorsed
by
the
2012
consensus
cervical
cancer
screening
guidelines.4,25
Our large population-based observational study is the
second of its kind conducted since the Food and Drug
Administration approved the Cobas HPV test as a primary
screening method for cervical cancer; our investigation fol-
lows a recent extended study by Blatt et al.18 In contrast to
the low sensitivity of the Pap test in detecting high-grade
lesions (42.63%) reported in the ATHENA trial,12 in our
study, the sensitivity of the Pap test was 90.9%, which is
comparable to the published data with optimized liquid-
based cytology.26-28 The difference between our findings
and those of the ATHENA trial is most likely attributable
to multiple factors. Optimal cytology reporting perform-
ance is crucial in evaluating the effectiveness of screening
modalities. The CAP benchmarking database is an ideal
reference for evaluating the performance of cytological
laboratories.
There are several caveats that may have had an
impact on the interpretation of our results. First, this was a
large retrospective study rather than a controlled trial.
Although a patient selection bias was unavoidable, the
study more likely reflects the performance of the Pap and
Cobas HPV tests in a real-world clinical practice versus
that in study trials. Second, the current study included
cases detected by the SurePath and ThinPrep methods in
almost equal numbers. The HPV-negative cases with
biopsy-confirmed high-grade cervicovaginal lesions were
observed in both SurePath and ThinPrep preparations. It
has been suggested that several of the liquid-base prepara-
tions may have interfered with the sensitivity of HPV test-
ing and, therefore, may have obscured the interpretation of
our data. Certainly, additional studies are necessary to fur-
ther assess the potential interference of different collection
media with HPV testing.
In conclusion, the Cobas HPV test alone is not supe-
rior to the Pap test as a primary screening method for
high-grade cervicovaginal lesions. The false-negative rate of
the HPV test in detecting biopsy-confirmed high-grade
cervicovaginal lesions is comparable to that of the Pap test.
Currently, cytology-HPV cotesting is the best strategy for
the detection of high-grade cervicovaginal lesions because
of the significantly lower false-negative rates achieved.
