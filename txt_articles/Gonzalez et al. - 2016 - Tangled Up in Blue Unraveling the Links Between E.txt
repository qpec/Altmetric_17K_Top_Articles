 Tangled Up in Blue: Unraveling
the Links Between Emotional
Distress and Treatment Adherence
in Type 2 Diabetes
Diabetes Care 2016;39:2182–2189 | DOI: 10.2337/dc16-1657
OBJECTIVE
We conducted comprehensive assessments of emotional distress to examine
relations with diabetes medication adherence over time.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Ethnically and socioeconomically diverse adults treated for type 2 diabetes com-
pleted validated self-reports (SRs) for diabetes distress and depression, were
administered semistructured depression interviews, and provided blood samples
for A1C. Medication adherence among 104 participants was electronically moni-
tored (EM) over the subsequent 3 months; validated SRs of medication adherence
were also obtained. Hierarchical linear regression evaluated independent effects
of diabetes distress and depression on adherence.
RESULTS
Mean 6 SD 3-month medication adherence was 76.1% 6 25.7% for EM and
83.7% 6 21.9% for SR. Higher levels of SR (P < 0.001) and interview-based
(P < 0.05) depressive symptom severity (P < 0.05) and diabetes-related distress
(P < 0.01) showed a significant bivariate association with EM and SR nonadher-
ence. Regression models showed baseline diabetes distress was a significant in-
dependent predictor of EM (b = 20.29; P = 0.001) and SR adherence (b = 20.24;
P < 0.02) at follow-up. SR depression was an independent predictor of EM and SR
adherence and reduced the effects of diabetes distress to nonsignificance. Subse-
quent models indicated this effect was driven by somatic rather than cognitive-
affective symptoms of depression. Results were consistent but weaker for
interview-based depressive symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS
Findings support diabetes-related distress and depression symptom severity as
risk factors for type 2 diabetes medication nonadherence. Somatic symptoms
captured by depression measures, but not cognitive-affective symptoms, inde-
pendently predict nonadherence and should be further investigated as a potential
link between emotional distress and nonadherence.
The prevalence of depression has been estimated to be up to twofold greater in
individuals with type 2 diabetes than in those without diabetes (1), and depression
may have significant consequences for diabetes treatment outcomes (2–4). If these
associations reflect a causal influence of depression on diabetes treatment

 outcomes, that influence may be ex-
plained,inpart,bytreatmentnonadherence
and suboptimal self-management. Depres-
sive symptoms have been significantly asso-
ciated with problematic self-management
(5), even at low levels of symptom severity
thatwouldnotwarrantapsychiatricdiagno-
sis (6). How to conceptualize these subclin-
ical symptoms of depression has been a
matter of debate (7–9). Questions include
whether elevated scores on such measures
that do not rise to the level of a diagnosable
disorder should be thought of as symptoms
of depression at all.
Considerable evidence supports the
validity of a construct for diabetes-related
emotional distress that is distinct from a
depressive mood disorder and specific to
the stress of living with a chronic illness
and a demanding self-management regi-
men (9). Diabetes-related distress reflects
the emotional and psychological reac-
tions to the burden and stress associated
with diabetes and its management (10).
Diabetes-related distress has been em-
pirically distinguished from depression
and depressive symptoms in relation to
self-management and glycemic control
(9,11–13). The available literature suggests
that diabetes distress is more common,
more chronic, and more closely associated
with diabetes outcomes than major de-
pressive disorder (MDD) (9). Evidence
alsosuggeststhatdiabetes-relateddistress
can often be mischaracterized as MDD in
research studies as a result of an over-
reliance on self-report (SR) screening mea-
sures with high rates of false positives
(7,8). Thus, there is a need for continued
research that differentiates depression
from diabetes-related distress in relation
to diabetes self-management.
Studies illustrate that the majority of
patients with type 2 diabetes who en-
dorse elevated levels of depressive symp-
toms on screening measures do not
qualify for a diagnosis of a depressive
mood disorder (see, e.g., ref. 11). The
overlap between somatic symptoms of
depression and diabetes-associated ill-
ness may partially explain this discrep-
ancy. For example, a study of adults
with type 2 diabetes showed that much
of the overidentification of depression
by a commonly used screening instru-
ment (14) was explained by symptoms
involving impairments in sleep, appetite,
and energy level (15). Results from a
large, population-based study showed
that differences in depressive symptoms
between adults with and without diabe-
tes were limited to somatic symptoms; no
significant differences were found for
cognitive-affective symptoms of depres-
sion (16). Further, qualitative analysis of
structured clinical interviews for depres-
sion showed that patients with type 2 di-
abetes often discuss somatic symptoms
of depression as being caused by diabetes
and diabetes-related medications (17).
The current study sought to examine,
using rigorous assessment methods, as-
sociations among diabetes distress, de-
pression, and medication adherence.
Based on previous research showing a
linear relationship between depressive
symptom severity and diabetes treat-
ment nonadherence, even at subclinical
levels (5,6) and the lack of a significant
relationship between MDD and type 2
diabetes treatment nonadherence (11),
our analyses focus on severity ratings
for emotional distress, rather than a di-
agnosis of MDD. We hypothesized inde-
pendent effects of diabetes-related
distress and depression in relation to
medication nonadherence and explored
the possibility of differential effects for
somatic versus cognitive-affective symp-
toms of depression in relation to diabetes
nonadherence. We expected that these
relationships would be consistent 1)
across SR and interviewer assessments
of depressive symptom severity and 2)
across subjective and objective measures
of diabetes medication adherence.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Study Sample and Procedures
Participants were recruited from diabetes
specialty and primary care clinics affili-
ated with a large, urban, academic med-
ical center through clinician referral, clinic
screening, posted fliers, and mailings as
part of a 3-month longitudinal observa-
tional study examining treatment adher-
ence and distress. Participants (N = 120)
were evaluated for depression, com-
pleted SR questionnaires, had blood
drawn, received an electronic bottle cap
to track their adherence, and were given
$50 compensation. Of the 120 partici-
pants, 105 completed the electronic med-
ication monitoring portion of the study
and returned for a follow-up assessment,
for which they were compensated an ad-
ditional $50. One participant was ex-
cluded because their monitored oral
medication was discontinued between
study visits, leaving 104 participants for
these analyses. Entry criteria included
age 18 years or older, a diagnosis of
type 2 diabetes, an SR ability to read or
write in English, and taking oral medica-
tion for diabetes or insulin and taking an
oral medication for hypertension or hy-
percholesterolemia. Participantsprovided
informed consent, and the institutional
review board at the Albert Einstein Col-
lege of Medicine approved this study.
Measures
Psychiatric Diagnoses
The Mini International Neuropsychiatric
Interview (MINI), a structured and valid
diagnostic interview that assesses vari-
ous psychiatric disorders based on diag-
nostic criteria, was used to establish
baseline current or previous MDD (18). In-
terviews were administered by doctoral-
level clinical psychology students, who
were trained and monitored by a licensed
clinical psychologist (J.S.G.) through
audiotaped supervision.
Diabetes-Related Distress
The 17-item Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS)
(10) evaluates distress over the past
month, using a scale from 1 (no distress)
to 6 (serious distress). A mean score ,2.0
indicates little to no distress, 2.0 to 2.9
indicates moderate distress, and $3 indi-
cates high distress (19). The instrument
has four subscales. Here we focus on
the five-item emotional burden subscale
(DDS-EB) to avoid overlap with reports of
adherence to the treatment regimen (i.e.,
regimen distress items), and to avoid
items that are not specifically representa-
tive of the experience of emotional dis-
tress (e.g., dissatisfaction with providers
and support from significant others). The
DDS-EB most clearly measures emotional
distress related to diabetes (face validity)
and has been previously associated with
SR medication adherence among adults
with type 2 diabetes (20). In this sample,
internal reliability was excellent for the
DDS total score (a = 0.95) and for the
DDS-EB (a = 0.92); scores from these
scales were strongly correlated (r = 0.90;
P , 0.001).
9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire
The 9-item Patient Health Question-
naire (PHQ-9) is a brief, valid, SR depres-
sion screening measure assessing the
frequency of depressive symptoms
over the past 2 weeks (14). The PHQ-9
assesses four somatic (sleep, fatigue,
appetite, and psychomotor retardation)
care.diabetesjournals.org

 and five cognitive-affective symptoms
(lack of interest, depressed mood, neg-
ative self-feelings, concentration prob-
lems, and suicidal ideation) that are
part of the diagnostic criteria for
MDD (21). Total scores $10 are consid-
ered a positive screen for MDD (14).
The internal reliability in this sample
was adequate for the total (a = 0.88),
cognitive-affective (a = 0.83), and so-
matic (a = 0.75) scales. The two sub-
scales were strongly correlated (r = 0.74;
P , 0.001).
Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating
Scale
Doctoral-level clinical psychology stu-
dents assessed depression symptom se-
verity via a semistructured interview at
baseline, with audiorecorded supervi-
sion by a licensed clinical psychologist
(J.S.G.). The Montgomery-Åsberg De-
pression Rating Scale (MADRS) probes
depressive symptoms experienced dur-
ing the previous week (22). Additional
open-ended follow-up questions elicit
information about the severity and fre-
quency of a specific symptom, rated
from 0 to 6. Scores between 31 and
34 are considered moderate depression
and those $35 are considered severe
depression (23). The MADRS has fewer
somatic symptoms than other measures
of depression severity (24). Intraclass
correlation between raters has been
previously reported as excellent (r =
0.93) (25). The MADRS was also scored
as a composite of cognitive-affective
symptoms (apparent sadness, reported
sadness, inner tension, concentration
difficulties, inability to feel, pessimistic
thoughts, and suicidal thoughts) and so-
matic symptoms (reduced sleep, reduced
appetite, and lassitude), consistent with
previous studies (26,27). Internal reliabil-
ity for the total scale score in our sample
was good (a = 0.85), with lower reliabil-
ity for the somatic (a = 0.60) than the
cognitive-affective (a= 0.82) subscales,
which were strongly correlated (r =
0.66; P , 0.001).
Electronically Monitored Medication
Adherence
Each participant was given a Medication
Event Monitoring System bottle cap
(MEMS) (AARDEX Group, Zurich, Swit-
zerland) to track one diabetes-related
medication for approximately 3 months.
Oral antihyperglycemic medications were
tracked when available. If a participant
was taking insulin and no oral antihyper-
glycemic medication, a medication for
cholesterol or blood pressure was
tracked. If multiple medications satisfied
these criteria, the oral medication that
was taken most frequently or was the
most difficult to remember was selected.
The percentage of doses taken as pre-
scribed was calculated by dividing the
number of times the bottle was opened
by the number of openings prescribed
during that time period. MEMS data
were corrected only when participants
could identify a specific day or days on
the calendar that they took their medica-
tion in a way that would not have been
recorded by the MEMS. MEMS readings
were corrected for 44 participants for
common reasons including medication
taken from a pillbox, inpatient hospitali-
zation, or taking multiple doses out of the
bottle when leaving home.
SR Medication Adherence
SR adherence ratings were adapted
from Lu et al. (28) and were previously
validated in adults with type 2 diabetes
(29). Participants were asked six sepa-
rate questions: “What percentage of
the time did you take all your diabetes
medications as your doctor prescribed?,”
using past week, month, and 3-month
intervals with 11 response categories
(0%, 10%, 20%, . . . 100%), and “On av-
erage, how would you rate your ability
to take all your diabetes medications as
your doctor prescribed?,” using past
week, month, and 3-month intervals
with 6 response categories (very poor,
poor, fair, good, very good, and excel-
lent). For the current analyses, responses
were combined into a composite stan-
dardized score (a = 0.97).
Glycemic Control
Diabetes control was assessed by gly-
cated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) via a cen-
tral laboratory. Participants had blood
drawn by a research nurse at each study
visit. Only 101 participants supplied a
valid HbA1c result at the follow-up for
reasons including refusal because of a
recent blood draw as part of regular clin-
ical care, a research nurse was unavail-
able during the scheduled visit, and
unwillingness to wait or return for a
blood draw.
Data Analysis
Descriptive statistics, including distribu-
tion normality, were examined for de-
mographic and study-related variables.
Bivariate relations among covariates,
indicators of emotional distress, SR/
electronic monitoring (EM) adherence,
and HbA1c values were examined using
the Pearson r statistic. Hierarchical lin-
ear regression examined independent
effects of baseline indictors of emo-
tional distress in predicting 3-month
SR/EM adherence. The DDS-EB, total
continuous scores from the PHQ-9 and
MADRS,andcompositescoresofcognitive-
affective and somatic depressive symp-
toms were evaluated as independent
predictors ofEM and SR adherence in sep-
arate models. Multicollinearity in the mul-
tiple regression models was assessed
using the variance inflation factor and tol-
erance, and no significant multicollinear-
ityamongpredictorswasfound.Allanalyses
were completed using SPSS software ver-
sion 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).
RESULTS
Sample Characteristics
Baseline characteristics of the larger
sample were described by Baek et al.
(30), and values for baseline variables
included in this analysis were not signif-
icantly different between those who
are included in the current analysis
and those who were lost to follow-up.
As seen in Table 1, participants were, on
average, ethnically diverse, older adults;
51.9% reported at least one diabetes-
related complication and 38.5% were
prescribed insulin. The average EM per-
centage of dosage taken as prescribed
was 76.1% (SD 25.7%); the average num-
ber of days monitored was just over
3 months (96.1 6 13.4 days). The aver-
age DDS score indicated “moderate” di-
abetes distress. Approximately 46.2% of
the sample scored above the threshold
for clinically significant diabetes distress
(19). Approximately 21% screened posi-
tive for MDD on the PHQ-9. However,
only five individuals who screened posi-
tive on the PHQ-9 met diagnostic criteria
for current MDD (22.7%); three positive
screens met criteria for previous MDD
(13.6%). The small number of partici-
pants with current MDD precluded fur-
ther analysis of the role of diagnosis in
this sample.
Bivariate Relationships: Covariates,

Indicators

associated with greater EM and SR

 adherence: older age (r = 0.33, P = 0.001
and r = 0.21, P = 0.03, respectively) and
fewer days of electronic monitoring
(r = 20.36, P , 0.001 and r = 20.13, P =
0.20, respectively). Participants taking
insulin had significantly lower EM adher-
ence (67.24% 6 27.28%; P = 0.005), com-
pared with those taking oral medications
only (81.72% 6 23.09%), although their SR
adherence was not significantly different
(P = 0.59). Significant covariates were
included in the respective multivariable
models presented below.
EM and SR adherence at follow-up
were significantly correlated (r = 0.45;
P , 0.001); each was significantly asso-
ciated with baseline HbA1c (r = 20.24,
P = 0.02 and r = 20.32, P , 0.001, re-
spectively) and with follow-up HbA1c
(n = 101; r = 20.30, P = 0.003 and
r = 20.31, P = 0.001, respectively).
DDS-EB was positively correlated with
PHQ-9 (r = 0.62; P , 0.001) and MADRS
total scores (r = 0.45, P , 0.001).
DDS-EB was somewhat more closely re-
lated to cognitive-affective (PHQ-9: r =
0.65, P , 0.001; MADRS: r = 0.46, P ,
0.001) than somatic depressive symp-
toms (PHQ-9: r = 0.50, P , 0.001; MADRS:
r = 0.32, P = 0.001). MADRS and PHQ-9 total
scores were strongly correlated (r = 0.82;
P , 0.001).
Those who screened positive on the
PHQ-9 had significantly lower EM adher-
ence (62.52% 6 29.21%; t = 2.91; P =
0.005) than those who screened nega-
tive (79.80% 6 23.49%). This difference
was significant for SR adherence as well
(P = 0.010). Each of the continuous var-
iables for emotional distress was signif-
icantly and negatively associated with
EM adherence in bivariate analyses, ex-
cept for MADRS cognitive-affective
symptoms (P = 0.16); all emotional
distress variables were significantly as-
sociated with SR adherence (Table 2).
No significant bivariate relationships
were found between emotional dis-
tress variables and HbA1c at baseline
(data not shown). Only DDS total scores
were significantly associated with
follow-up HbA1c (n = 101; r = 0.22;
P = 0.029).
Multivariable Regression Analyses
Hierarchical models showed that greater
levels of diabetes distress were signifi-
cantly associated with lower EM and SR
adherence after covariate adjustment
(Table 3, step 1). When the PHQ-9 total
score was added to these models, it ac-
counted for significant additional vari-
ance in both EM (P = 0.021) and SR
adherence (P = 0.004), and attenuated
the effect of diabetes distress to nonsigni-
ficance (Table 3, step 2a). Adding MADRS
total scores in separate models did not
account for significant additional variance
in EM or SR adherence beyond that ac-
countedforbydiabetesdistressandcovar-
iates (Table 3, step 2b).
Next, we examined somatic and
cognitive-affective depressive symptom
dimensions as predictors of adher-
ence, controlling for covariates. Results
showed that only somatic depressive
symptoms were independently asso-
ciated with EM adherence, whereas
cognitive-affective symptoms were not
independently significant in either
model. Neither of the depression symp-
tom components was independently

 predictive of SR adherence; this was
consistent for MADRS and PHQ-9 (Table
4, steps 1a and 1b).
Based on these results, we tested a fi-
nal set of models adding somatic symp-
toms to covariates and diabetes distress
to examinetheirindependence in predict-
ing adherence. PHQ-9 somatic symptoms
accounted for additional independent
variance in EM and SR nonadherence; di-
abetes distress was attenuated to non-
significance in each of these models
(Table 4, step2a). MADRS somatic depres-
sive symptoms accounted for additional
independent variance in EM adherence,
but not in SR adherence; in each case
diabetes distress remained a significant
independent predictor of adherence
(Table 4, step 2b).
CONCLUSIONS
Our results show that various indicators
of depression and diabetes-related
emotional distress were bivariately as-
sociated over time with both SR and
EM medication nonadherence in a
diverse sample of adults with type 2 di-
abetes. Diabetes distress and depres-
sion shared between 20% and 38%
of their variance in this sample, sug-
gesting substantial overlap in the mea-
surement of these emotional distress
constructs. Cognitive-affective symp-
toms of depression assessed by clinical
interview, the gold-standard approach
of depression assessment, were the
only indicator of emotional distress not
significantly associated with EM adher-
ence in bivariate analysis. About 21%
of our sample screened positive for
MDD, and their adherence was signifi-
cantly lower than those who did not
screen positive. However, only 36% of
these positive screens met diagnostic
criteria for either current or previous
MDD (64% were false positives). Fur-
ther, total diabetes-related distress
was the only indicator of emotional dis-
tress that was associated with HbA1c val-
ues at follow-up.
Multivariable adjustment showed
that diabetes distress, measured by the
emotional burden subscale of the DDS,
was significantly associated with both
EM and SR adherence. Self-reported de-
pression symptom severity was indepen-
dently significant across adherence
measures and attenuated the contribu-
tion of diabetes distress to nonsignifi-
cance, indicating overlapping variance
between these two measures. Effects
were weaker for the MADRS, which was
not independently predictive of either EM
or SR adherence, and did not attenuate
the effects of diabetes distress. Impor-
tantly, the MADRSinterviewwasdesigned
to be less sensitive to somatic symptom
confounding when chronic illness is pre-
sent (23). Thus somatic symptoms may
play a role in explaining differences be-
tween MADRS and PHQ-9 findings.
As recommended by authoritative
diagnostic systems (21), MADRS in-
terviews involved clinical judgment in
the evaluation of symptoms. Also, the
MADRS does not assess increases in
sleep or appetite, only decreases. The
PHQ-9 includes items for fatigue and
psychomotor retardation, whereas the
MADRS only assesses difficulty in initiat-
ing activities (lassitude). Thus the PHQ-9
more fully assesses the symptom crite-
ria for MDD (21) but may also be more
vulnerable to confounding by physical
illness and illness-related functional im-
pairment(24). PHQ-9reportsofdisturbed
appetite, fatigue, and psychomotor retar-
dation were the only symptoms that dif-
ferentiated adults with diabetes from those
without diabetes in a recent population-
based study (16). Furthermore, problems
with appetite, sleep, and fatigue were
the only PHQ-9 symptoms that did not
discriminate between false-positive and
true-positive cases of depressive disor-
der in a study of adults with type 2 diabe-
tes (15). This suggests these somatic
symptoms are less closely associated
with true depression in diabetes than

Emotional Distress and Treatment Adherence
Diabetes Care Volume 39, December 2016
 cognitive-affectivesymptoms. These differ-
ences warrant further investigation.
Our findings demonstrating an inde-
pendent role for somatic symptoms of
depression in predicting medication ad-
herence in type 2 diabetes are, to our
knowledge, novel and require replication.
Previous research has repeatedly linked
depression to diabetes treatment nonad-
herence, but these studies have not ex-
amined differences between depression
symptom dimensions (5). Furthermore,
prior studies have predominantly relied
on SR screening measures of depression,
for which more than half of positive
screens would be false positives (11,31),
consistent with our findings. When stud-
ies assessed depressive disorders using a
standardized diagnostic interview, they
generally failed to find a relationship with
diabetes treatment adherence (see, e.g.,
ref. 11). Intervention trials that have been
successfulintreatingdepressionindiabetes
have been unsuccessful in improving med-
ication adherence or self-management
(see, e.g., ref. 32). Other data demon-
strate that relations between depression
symptom severity and problems with self-
management, including medication non-
adherence, persist after the exclusion of
nearlyalllikelycasesofMDD(6).Thelackof
an independent role for cognitive-affective
symptoms of depression reported by this
study casts further doubt on whether
clinical depression is the construct un-
derlying the relationship between ele-
vations on depressive symptom scales
and diabetes treatment nonadherence.
Studies that have attempted to iden-
tify independent relationships between
diabetes distress and depressive symp-
toms in relation to diabetes self-care
have found somewhat mixed results,
emphasizing one or the other construct,
with variation of effects across aspects
of self-management (12,13,20,33). Our
study is unique in 1) using both a clinical
interview for depression severity and
validated SR; 2) using EM to assess
missed medication doses and vali-
dated SR; and 3) examining somatic
and cognitive-affective components of
depression. These methods allow us to
limit the role of shared measurement
error in these effects. We also took a
conservative approach of using only the
emotional burden subscale of the DDS in
our analyses to limit potential confound-
ing with treatment adherence behaviors
and to avoid introducing sources of dis-
tress, such as dissatisfying relationships
with providers, that could influence ad-
herence through pathways other than
emotional distress (10,20).
Our design also has limitations. There
is no “gold standard” for the assessment
of medication adherence and, although
our data are consistent with prior re-
search showing that EM captures more
nonadherence than SR, EM is also sub-
ject to measurement error; both mea-
sures were equivalently related to HbA1c
in this and previous research (29). Further
limitations of EM include a lack of stan-
dardization concerning which type of
medication was monitored. Thus, we can-
not speak to variations across these mea-
sures with certainty, despite our attempt
to avoid errors related to EM by adjusting
values based on compelling participant
reports about doses taken in ways that
would not be captured by EM. The same
is trueforour measuresofdepression: we
cannot be certain about which differ-
ences between the assessments explain
the variations in effects. The MADRS so-
matic symptom scale also had marginal
reliability. We focused on depressive
symptom severity rather than diagnosis
of a mood disorder in these analyses
based on prior evidence (6,11), and re-
sults cannot speak directly to the effect
of depressive mood disorders. Our rela-
tively small sample may alsolimit the gen-
eralizability of findings and may have
limited power for our analyses, especially
for more distal HbA1c effects. Given the
correlationalnature ofthis study,it is pos-
sible that a third variable, such as disease
burden (e.g., complications and comor-
bidities) or complexity of diabetes man-
agement, contributed to both increased
emotional distress and nonadherence.
Finally, although we captured average
adherence over a clinically meaningful
period of time (i.e., ;3 months), our de-
sign also prevents an examination of how
these variables change over time. Future
longitudinal studies with more than two
time points and those that use ecological
momentary assessment methods may
better evaluate the direction of and cap-
ture the dynamic relations among the fac-
tors identified here.

 in future research may improve our un-
derstanding of the nature and potential
explanatory mechanisms for relations
between depression and diabetes health
outcomes. Studies from the cardiovascu-
lar disease (CVD) literature, which also re-
ports consistent evidence linking depression
to poor prognosis, suggest that this dis-
tinction could be important. For example,
population-level data showed that so-
matic symptoms of depression, but not
cognitive-affective symptoms, were inde-
pendently associated with coronary heart
disease and personal and family history of
myocardial infarction, among other CVD
risk factors (34). Meta-analysis of prospec-
tive studies of depressive symptom di-
mensions in individuals with CVD found
that somatic symptoms were significantly
associated with mortality and cardiovas-
cular events in fully adjusted analyses;
cognitive-affective symptoms were not
(35). Other recent studies similarly dem-
onstrate an independent effect of somatic
symptoms, rather than cognitive-affective
symptoms, in predicting poor CVD out-
comes (see, e.g., refs. 35, 36, and 37).
Whether this pattern of findings re-
flects a unique effect of certain depres-
sive symptoms, a particular depression
“subtype,” or confounding with symp-
toms of physical illness is unclear. Further
investigation of these possibilities is
needed in relation to diabetes self-
management and health outcomes.
Clinical Implications
One fundamental clinical implication of
this study is that providers should be
aware that emotional distress can often
be associated with risk for type 2 dia-
betes treatment nonadherence. Our re-
sults provide evidence for considerable
consistency of effects across measures
of emotional distress; they also dem-
onstrate substantial intercorrelation
among these indicators of emotional
distress. This likely reflects a significant
role for shared variance across these
measures. While routine screening for
depression, an increasingly common
standard of diabetes care, identifies pa-
tients with more depressive symptoms
and who may be at higher risk for treat-
ment nonadherence, it does not sepa-
rate the larger number of false-positive
from true-positive depression cases, nor
does it identify the most appropriate
intervention. Further evaluation is nec-
essary for screening programs to be
effective (7,8). Rather than focusing ex-
clusively on clinical depressiondan im-
portant but far less prevalent problem
than clinically significant diabetes dis-
tress in this and other samples (see,
e.g., refs. 38 and 39)devidence sug-
gests that emotional distress that does
not rise to the level of a psychiatric di-
agnosis could nevertheless represent
meaningful risk for problems with dia-
betes treatment adherence. As such,
providers should be attuned to emo-
tional distress in their patients during
clinical encounters and consider specific
depressive symptom presentations and
diabetes-related distress as part of their
further evaluation of positive screens to
more accurately identify the nature of
the problem and guide the selection of
appropriate interventions (7,9,11).
Consistent evidence across methods
of assessment demonstrates that so-
matic symptoms involving fatigue,
sleep, appetite disturbance, and psycho-
motor changes may warrant particular
attention in relation to emotional distress
and risk for type 2 diabetes treatment
nonadherence. Whether these symptoms
represent somatic symptoms of a major
depressive episode, residual symptoms
between episodes of depression, situa-
tional stress, confounding with symptoms
of physical illness, or side effects of pre-
scribed medication, or whether they have
other explanations can likely only be
ascertained through a careful clinical in-
terview. Distinguishing among these ex-
planations for reported “symptoms”
should be at least as important as estab-
lishing their severity in guiding the selec-
tion of appropriate interventions to
reduce emotional distress and improve
treatment adherence among adults living
with type 2 diabetes.
