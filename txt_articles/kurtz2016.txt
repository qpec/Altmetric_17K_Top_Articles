Background: The purpose of this study was to analyze the utilization and outcomes of ceramic bearings
used in revision total hip arthroplasty (R-THA) in the Medicare population.
Methods: A total of 31,809 patients aged >65 years at the time of revision surgery who underwent R-THA
between 2005 and 2013 were identified from the United States Medicare 100% national administrative
claims database. Outcomes of interest included relative risk of readmission (90 days) or infection,
dislocation, rerevision, or mortality at any time point after revision. Propensity scores were developed to
adjust for selection bias in the choice of bearing type at revision surgery.
Results: The utilization of ceramic-on-polyethylene (C-PE) and ceramic-on-ceramic (COC) bearings in
R-THA increased from 5.3% to 26.6% and from 1.8% to 2.5% in between 2005 and 2013, respectively. For
R-THA patients treated with C-PE bearings, there was reduced risk of 90-day readmission (hazard ratio,
HR: 0.90, P ¼ .007). We also observed a trend for reduced risk of infection with C-PE (HR: 0.88) that did
not reach statistical significance (P ¼ .14). For R-THA patients treated with COC bearings, there was
reduced risk of dislocation (HR: 0.76, P ¼ .04). There was no significant difference in risk of rerevision or
mortality for either the C-PE or COC bearing cohorts when compared with the metal-on-polyethylene
bearing cohort.
Conclusion: Medicare patients treated in a revision scenario with ceramic bearings exhibit similar risk of
rerevision, infection, or mortality as those treated with metal-on-polyethylene bearings. Conversely, we
found an association between the use of specific ceramic bearings in R-THA and reduced risk of read-
mission (C-PE) and dislocation (COC).

Ceramic bearings, in which a ceramic femoral head articulates
against either polyethylene (ceramic on polyethylene [C-PE]) or a
ceramic acetabular component (ceramic on ceramic [COC]), have
been used for >40 years in primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) as
an alternative to metal-on-polyethylene (M-PE) bearings [1-3].
Contemporary ceramic bearings have well-documented, long-term
clinical survivorship in primary THA [4,5]. Although ceramic com-
ponents were initially adopted because of their improved wear
resistance relative to M-PE [6,7], recent research has also shown
that the use of ceramic mitigates the risk of taper corrosion [8].
Previous studies have also suggested that COC bearings may be
associated with reduced risk of dislocation [9,10]. Balancing these
advantages, ceramic bearings have well-known drawbacks, namely,
their increased cost [11]; the potential risk of fracture [5,12],
although substantially diminished for the current generation
[13,14]; and, in the case of COC articulations, squeaking [15]. Due
partly to concerns about squeaking, COC is currently a less popular
bearing choice than C-PE among US surgeons [11].
In the past decade, there have been substantial changes in the
usage of alternative bearings in primary THA due, first, to the
widespread adoption of metal-on-metal (MOM) articulations up to

 2008, followed by their subsequent decline [16]. In the United
States, MOM hips were used in 26%-32% of revision THAs between
2005 and 2008 because of concerns about dislocation, especially in
elderly patients [16]. By contrast, comparatively little is known
regarding the usage patterns for ceramic bearings during revision
surgery in the past decade, especially after the decline of MOM
usage that began in 2009.
The outcomes of different ceramic bearings during revision
surgery likewise remain poorly understood. Previous studies on
ceramic bearing usage during revision have focused on the out-
comes of patients who were revised after the rare circumstances
of a fracture of the femoral head [17] or who were revised because
of squeaking [18]. Wong et al [19] studied 884 aseptic revisions of
MOM hip resurfacing arthroplasties in Australia. They observed no
difference in the rerevision rate as a function of the bearing sur-
face (M-PE, MOM, COC, or C-PE); however, they cautioned that a
larger sample size than what they examined would be likely be
necessary to see differences, if there were any [19]. Jack et al [20],
also from Australia, followed the outcomes of 165 acetabular cup
revisions using COC bearings; however, this observational cohort
study did not include a control group with an alternative bearing.
In the United States, Cooper et al [21] described the treatment of
patients who were revised for adverse locale tissue reactions from
taper corrosion in M-PE bearings and later recommended that
device components that do not include cobalt or chromium be
used in the treatment of such patients at revision, using C-PE or
COC bearings [22].
It remains unknown how the patient outcomes after revision
using contemporary ceramic bearings compare with the outcomes
for patients revised using M-PE bearings in the United States.
Accordingly, we addressed the following related research ques-
tions: (1) what is the utilization of ceramic bearings for revision
total hip arthroplasty (R-THA) in the Medicare population and how
has it evolved over time; (2) does the use of C-PE bearings influence
outcomes after R-THA as compared with M-PE; and (3) does the use
of COC bearings influence outcomes after R-THA as compared with
M-PE?
Methods
The Medicare 100% national administrative claims database was
used to identify revision THA patients between October 1, 2005,
and December 31, 2013. This set of data captures all fee-for-service
claims submitted by hospitals for hip revision and other hospital-
izations from this group of patients. Patients aged <65 years or
beneficiaries enrolled in a health maintenance organization were
excluded. A small number of beneficiaries residing outside of the 50
states were also excluded. Thus, our study considered the elderly
Medicare population of revision hip arthroplasty patients.
Unique, encrypted Medicare beneficiary identifiers were used to
follow patients longitudinally throughout the study period. Pa-
tients’ Medicare entitlement status and mortality were tracked
using a linked “denominator” file provided by the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services that accompanied the analytic
data sets. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM: 81.53, 00.70-00.73) procedure
codes were used to identify hip revision patients. We did not
distinguish between the type of revision surgery (ie, acetabular vs
femoral revision) in assigning patients to the study. Previous
research has suggested that outcomes after revision are not sensi-
tive to the type of revision surgery [19].
Our focus was to investigate outcomes as a function of the
bearing surface used in the revision, which was identified in the
revision claim record using an ICD-9-CM code of 00.74 (M-PE);
00.75 (MOM); 00.76 (COC); and 00.77 (C-PE). These bearing surface
codes were introduced in October 2005 for M-PE, MOM, and COC
bearings. In October 2006, the code for C-PE was introduced. As a
result, the C-PE cohort has one less year of follow-up than the other
bearing surface cohorts in this study. Between 2006 and 2013,
about 31%-33% of revisions recorded in the Medicare database
included a bearing surface code (Table 1). We investigated the
difference in patient characteristics between those with known vs
unknown bearings to better understand the study population. We
observed a slight but significant difference in the patient charac-
teristics that received a bearing code in the Medicare database and
those that were uncoded. Overall, female patients, older patients,
those needing Medicare buy-in (indicative of lower socioeconomic
status), those with greater comorbidities (based on their Charlson
score [23]), and patients residing in the South census region all had
a lower probability of having their bearing type coded. Conversely,
a higher total hospital charge was associated with a higher likeli-
hood of having the bearing type coded.
Because MOM bearings are no longer widely used, we focused
our research on the comparison of outcomes in patients with
known M-PE, C-PE, and COC bearings at the time of revision THA.
Outcomes of interest included 90-day readmission for any reason,
periprosthetic joint infection, dislocation, rerevision, or death at
any time point after the index revision procedure during the study
period. Hospital readmission was determined by the appearance of
any inpatient claims within 90 days of discharge from the index
revision surgery, indicating a rehospitalization episode. The rate of
90-day hospital readmission is a quality measure defined by the
Affordable Care Act of 2010 [24]. Periprosthetic joint infection was
identified using an ICD-9-CM diagnosis code of 996.66 [25],
whereas dislocation was identified using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes
of 718.35, 835.00-835.03, and 996.42 (effective October 2005) [26].
Rerevision was identified using the same revision codes listed
previously to assemble the study cohorts, and death was identified
using the previously mentioned denominator file accompanying
the inpatient analytical data set. We used the Kaplan-Meier
approach to inspect the crude (unadjusted) survivorship of the
M-PE, C-PE, and COC cohorts for each of the outcomes of interest.
Propensity scores were developed to adjust for selection bias in
the choice of bearing type at revision surgery. As discussed in a
recent review [27], propensity scores were used to treat large data
sets of retrospective registry data, such as are available via Medi-
care, for selection bias. The application of propensity scores rep-
resents an approach to treating Medicare data like a randomized
clinical study by effectively balancing patient factors known to be

 related to bearing surface selection. Specifically, the propensity
score calculates a patient’s chance of receiving a C-PE or COC
implant, given certain patient and hospital factors. The actual
bearing material received is independent of this propensity score. If
different types of bearings were implanted for patients having
identical propensity, the choice of bearing material can be thought
of as randomly assigned. This ensures that the outcomes associated
with each bearing type are not confounded by patient factors. The
propensity score was calculated for each patient using the
following predictors: age, sex, region, race, Medicare buy-in (a
proxy for socioeconomic status), Charlson Comorbidity Score,
revision calendar year, length of stay, charge amount, hospital
volume, surgeon volume, principal diagnosis, hospital location
(urban or rural), hospital type (eg, public, private), size of the
hospital, and 2-way interactions among age, gender, race, Charlson
score, hospital size, and hospital type.
Cox regression incorporating propensity score stratification (10
levels) was then used to evaluate the impact of bearing surface
selection on outcomes, after adjusting for patient-, hospital-, and
surgeon-related factors. The Cox model was stratified into 10 pro-
pensity strata. The Cox model combined the likelihood functions
from each stratum and estimated an overall hazard ratio and cor-
responding confidence intervals. The Cox regression model incor-
porated the main study variables: bearing type (C-PE, COC, or
M-PE) and the following potential confounding variables: patient
age; race; census region; patient diagnosis of diabetes, heart dis-
ease or obesity; patient's Charlson Comorbidity Index; hospital
type, location, and size; hospital procedure volume; surgeon pro-
cedure volume; total hospital charges; length of stay; Medicare
buy-in; operating room charges; and calendar year. All statistical
analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (Cary, NC).
Results
A total of 31,809 Medicare patients who underwent R-THA be-
tween 2005 and 2013 with known bearing types were identified
from the Medicare 100% inpatient sample administrative database,
including 4,265 patients who received C-PE, 869 patients who
received COC, and 26,675 patients who received M-PE bearings
(Table 1). The relative usage of ceramic bearings varied over time
(Fig. 1). In 2007, the first calendar year in which all 4 bearing codes
(including MOM) were fully implemented; C-PE and COC usage was
5.3% and 1.8%, respectively. By 2013, C-PE and COC bearings usage
increased to 26.6% and 2.5%, respectively (Fig. 1). During this time
period, the relative usage of MOM bearings declined from 27.3% to
10% among R-THAs.
The R-THA patients in this study were 60% female, on average
(±standard deviation) 75 (±10) years old, 94% white, and 50% had
no comorbidities (corresponding to a Charlson score of 0, Table 2).
The usage of C-PE implants in R-THA was the highest in the 65- to
69-year cohort (21% of revision operations in that cohort) and
lowest for the 85þ year cohort (7% of revision operations). The
opposite trend was observed for M-PE implants: 76% of patients in
the 65- to 69-year cohort received M-PE implants compared with
90% of the 85þ year cohort. Percentage of patients receiving COC
implants, on the other hand, was uniform among all age cohorts.
Utilization of C-PE, COC, and M-PE was comparable in male and
female patients. Although patients with bearing codes were
dominantly white in this study, the utilization of ceramic bearings
was homogeneous across races. For instance, 13% of white patients,
14% of black patients, and 10% of patients of unknown/other races
received C-PE bearings, whereas the utilization of COC bearings
were 3%, 4%, and 4% for white, black, and unknown/other races,
respectively. While patients in the Midwest received the largest
number of M-PE implants (7615), patients in the South received the

 largest number of C-PE (1517) and COC (325) implants. Among
infection, dislocation, and loosening as reasons for revision, loos-
ening occurred most frequently among all 3 bearing types.
For R-THA patients treated with C-PE bearings, there was
reduced risk of 90-day readmission (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.90, 95% CI:
0.84-0.96, P ¼ .007; Fig. 2). We also observed a trend for reduced
risk of infection with C-PE (HR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.74-1.04) that did not
reach statistical significance (P ¼ .14). Based on Kaplan-Meier
analysis, the crude (unadjusted) survivorship at 5 years, using
rerevision as an end point (with 95% CIs), was 83.7% (82.8%-84.6%)
for M-PE, 82.2% (79.0%-84.9%) for C-PE, respectively. After pro-
pensity score stratification and adjustment for confounders, there
was no significant difference in risk of rerevision (P ¼ .99) or
mortality (P ¼ .51) for the C-PE bearing cohorts when compared
with M-PE. When recipients of C-PE and M-PE are compared,
reason for revision was a risk factor for all 5 outcomes (death,
dislocation, rerevision, infection, readmission) analyzed in this
study (Fig. 2). Charlson score and length of stay were risk factors for
all outcomes except rerevision. Finally, race was a risk factor for all
outcomes except infection.
For R-THA patients treated with COC, there was reduced risk of
dislocation (HR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.58-0.99, P ¼ .04; Fig. 3). Based on
Kaplan-Meier analysis, the crude (unadjusted) survivorship at 5
years, using rerevision as an end point (with 95% CIs), was 85.0%
(79.7%-88.9%) for the COC cohort. After propensity score stratifi-
cation and adjustment for confounders, there was no significant
difference in risk of rerevision (P ¼.31) or mortality (P ¼.45) for the
COC bearing cohorts when compared with the M-PE cohort. When
C-PE and M-PE cohorts were compared, reason for revision was a
risk factor for all 5 outcomes (death, rerevision, infection, read-
mission) analyzed in this study (Fig. 3). Charlson score and length of
stay were risk factors for all outcomes except rerevision. Race and
year of implantation were risk factors for all outcomes except
infection. Finally, age was a risk factor for all outcomes except
dislocation.
Overall, age was the highest relative importance predictor of
mortality, whereas reason for revision was the predictor with
highest relative importance for dislocation, infection, readmission,
rerevision for COC bearings for both COC and C-PE bearings (Figs 2
and 3).
Discussion
In this study of all comers for revision total hip surgery in the
elderly Medicare population, we asked how the use of ceramic
bearings changed over time and whether the type of ceramic
bearing influenced outcomes relative to M-PE. Between 2006 and
2013, we observed an increase in the reported usage of C-PE

 bearings in revision surgeries for Medicare beneficiaries. We found
no evidence to suggest that ceramic bearings were associated with
worse outcomes than M-PE bearings when used in revisions.
Conversely, we found support for our hypotheses that ceramic
bearings may improve certain outcomes after revision surgery,
such as 90-day readmission, dislocation, and perhaps infection;
however, the results were bearing- and outcome-specific.
We would like to highlight several limitations of our study for the
reader. First, our analysis was based on a retrospective analysis of
administrative billing data, which was limited to the ICD-9-CM
classification of procedures and diagnoses. Because the Medicare
data set does not include clinical information, it was not possible for
us to evaluate clinical factors such as soft tissue damage, the presence
of metal-related pathology, or osteolysis in our study. We attempted
to include andadjust for revisionprocedure complexityanddifficulty
due to patient and clinical factors by considering the patients’
Charlson Comorbidity Index and length of stay as proxies. Further-
more, our analysis methodology including propensity scores was
designed to adjust for selection bias in the assignment of ceramic
bearings in the comparison with M-PE bearings and overcome the
limitation of a restrospective nonrandomized study design.
Second, our study was limited to 31%-33% revision patients in
Medicare with known billing codes, which are optional and not
required for hospital reimbursement [28]. We addressed this
limitation using propensity scores to adjust for selection bias
among the patients who were coded for bearing type. Third, the
patient population was limited to those >65 years in age who
were covered by Medicare; our findings may not necessarily apply
to younger patients. Fourth, we included all comers to revision in
this analysis and did not subclassify the treated population into
septic vs aseptic revisions, for example. Fifth, our analysis was
limited to outcomes recorded in an inpatient setting, which may
have underestimated the risk of dislocation because not all of
these events may be treated with clinical intervention requiring an

Sixth, the bearing codes for both types of ceramic bearings and
the control (M-PE) bearings are general and do not distinguish
between the types of polyethylene formulations, different types of
ceramic biomaterials, or head size that were used clinically during
the study period. In the first decade of the 2000s, many different
formulations of highly cross-linked and thermally stabilized poly-
ethylene were clinically introduced, including second-generation
materials [29]. In addition, the type of ceramics available in the
United States also varied in the time period of this study, with the
increased adoption of zirconia-toughened alumina after 2003 [30].
Furthermore, changes in femoral head size were clinically intro-
duced during this time period to improve joint stability and reduce
dislocation risk [26]. Thus, the granularity of the administrative
bearing codes limits our ability to answer questions about specific
formulations of bearing materials and head size.

 Nevertheless, these limitations are offset by the use of the
largest (100%) nationally representative data set available for the
elderly population, in which ceramic bearings were used in about a
quarter of revisions for any reason. The smallest cohort in our study
(for revision COC patients) is approximately the same size as the
entire study population of revision resurfacings considered by
Wong et al [19] in their analysis of the Australian registry data.
Because of the sample sizes necessary to identify potentially subtle
trends in administrative data, very large data sets, such as ortho-
pedic registries or the Medicare data set we used, are well suited to
examining the outcomes after revision surgery.
The utilization of alternative bearings has been previously
examined in the context of primary THA and as a result of concerns
with MOM. Although the usage of MOM bearings has previously
been studied in revision surgeries, we are aware of no previous
utilization studies of ceramic bearings in revision for US patients,
making comparison of our results difficult. Clinicians were attrac-
ted to alternative bearings because of the larger head sizes that
could be achieved with MOM to improve joint stability and reduce
dislocation risk. Since that time, larger diameter ceramic heads (up
to 44 mm in diameter) are now clinically available in the United
States. Also, there is greater understanding based on international
registry data that head sizes >36 mm diameter may not necessarily
provide improved dislocation risk in clinical practice. Finally, con-
cerns with taper corrosion using cobalt-chromium femoral heads
may also be playing a role in surgeon decisions to increasingly
adopt ceramic heads in both a primary and revision scenario.
Although it is not possible for us to identify from claims data which
of the aforementioned trends are responsible for the increase in
ceramic bearing usage among Medicare beneficiaries undergoing
revision, the trends are temporally coincident with the reduction of
utilization of MOM bearings and, to a growing extent, reduced
usage of M-PE bearings as well.
Few studies have examined the rates of THA rerevision for large
populations [19,31]. Based on the Australian registry, Wong et al
[19] found a 26% rerevision rate at 10 years, with no significant
effect of the bearing surface. Examining the elderly Medicare
population, Ong et al [31] reported 81% survivorship at 5 years after
revision, which is comparable to the survivorship for the 3 cohorts
recorded in the present study. The difference in lower rerevision
rates between the study by Wong et al and the Medicare studies is
most likely due to differences in the patient mix in the 2 studies. In
the study by Wong et al [19], the patients were all revisions of hip
resurfacing performed in Australia, which according to the 2014
registry report [5] was most often performed in male patients aged
<65 years.
For the C-PE cohort, the reduced 90-day admission rates and
trend for reduced risk of infection were independent findings.
Recent studies presented at national conferences suggest that
ceramics may be more resistant to infection than cobalt-chromium
surfaces [32-35], which would help explain these results viewed
here. Further analysis is needed to better understand the associa-
tion between infection, early readmission, and the use of C-PE
bearings.
Previous studies have reported that COC bearings have a lower
risk of dislocation than M-PE bearings in primary THA [9,10] and
revision THA [36]. Hernigou et al [9] specifically addressed this
topic with primary THA, comparing the risk of dislocation in C-PE
and COC bearings that were implanted between 1972 and 1982.
Interestingly, they noted biologic factors that differed between the
C-PE and COC bearings, which enabled significantly greater
capsular thickening and, hypothetically, greater long-term dislo-
cation resistance in the COC cohort. Also, the C-PE incorporated
historical, gamma-air-sterilized polyethylene for the acetabular
liner that would generate biologically active wear particles.
In summary, our results indicate that, after adjusting for selec-
tion bias and various confounding patient-, surgeon-, and hospital-
related factors, Medicare patients treated in a revision scenario
with ceramic bearings exhibit similar risk of rerevision or mortality
as those treated with M-PE bearings. Conversely, we found an
association between the use of specific ceramic bearings in R-THA
and reduced risk of readmission (C-PE) and dislocation (COC). The
findings of this study support further research into the association
between ceramic bearings in R-THA and lower risk of hospital
readmission, dislocation, and, potentially, infection.
