Abstract
In cascade testing, genetic testing for an identified familial pathogenic variant extends to disease-free relatives to allow ge-
netically targeted disease prevention. We evaluated the results of an online initiative in which carriers of 1 of 30 cancer-
associated genes, or their first-degree relatives, could offer low-cost testing to at-risk first-degree relatives. In the first year,
1101 applicants invited 2280 first-degree relatives to undergo genetic testing. Of invited relatives, 47.5% (95% confidence inter-
val [CI] ¼ 45.5 to 49.6%) underwent genetic testing, and 12.0% (95% CI ¼ 9.2 to 14.8%) who tested positive continued the cascade
by inviting additional relatives to test. Of tested relatives, 4.9% (95% CI ¼ 3.8 to 6.1%) had a pathogenic variant in a different
gene from the known familial one, and 16.8% (95% CI ¼ 14.7 to 18.8%) had a variant of uncertain significance. These results
suggest that an online, low-cost program is an effective approach to implementing cascade testing, and that up to 5% of the
general population may carry a pathogenic variant in 1 of 30 cancer-associated genes.
Testing those diagnosed with a disease is the most efficient
way to identify carriers of predisposing germline genetic var-
iants, and is consistent with clinical practice guidelines (1). To
achieve the goal of genetically targeted primary disease preven-
tion, testing for an identified familial pathogenic variant must
then extend to disease-free relatives in a process known as
“cascade testing” (2–4). Cascade testing has been designated by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a Tier 1 geno-
mic application for Lynch Syndrome and Hereditary Breast and
Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (5). However, there are major barriers
to cascade testing, including cost, insurance constraints (6), and
confidentiality laws that prohibit direct contact of a patient’s
relatives by her/his physician or genetic counselor. The burden
of informing relatives about test results and their implications
falls primarily on the patient, who may simultaneously be
struggling with a new diagnosis (7). In the cancer genetics field,
technologic advances have reduced testing costs and enabled
new care delivery models (8,9). We evaluated the first year of an
online, low-cost family testing initiative offered by a testing
laboratory.

ing program (Figure 1A). People with a qualifying pathogenic re-
sult from the testing laboratory received an email introducing
the family testing program; information about the program was
also distributed to potential participants with the results from
other laboratories through online advertisements, at clinics,
and at events for families with hereditary cancer. After initial
application, the testing laboratory sent emails to FDRs identified
by the applicant, inviting them to undergo CLIA-certified multi-
plex sequencing of these 30 genes at an out-of-pocket cost of US

 $50. Sequencing and variant classification followed standard
practice guidelines (Supplementary Methods, available online).
FDRs with pathogenic results were required to speak by tele-
phone with a genetic counselor to obtain their test results and
counseling about cancer risk (10,11). All participants signed in-
formed consent approved by the Western Institutional Review
Board, Inc. All P-values are two-sided, and a P-value of less than
.05 was considered statistically significant.
In the program’s first year (September 27, 2016 to September
27, 2017), 1101 applicants (741 carriers and 360 FDRs) invited
2280 FDRs. Applicants were more often women (78.1% of carrier
applicants, binomial P < .001; 63.9% of FDR applicants, binomial
P < .001); demographic details are in Supplementary Table 2
(available
online).
During
the
follow-up
period
(median ¼
216 days), 47.5% (95% CI ¼ 45.5 to 49.6%) of invited FDRs under-
went testing. Invited female relatives were more likely to test
than males (52.6% vs 42.0%, v2 P < .001). There were no differen-
ces in testing by gene (Figure 1B): relatives who were invited be-
cause
of
a
pathogenic
variant
associated
with
a
well-
characterized syndrome (BRCA1/2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2,
CDH1, CDKN2A, STK11, and TP53) were tested as often as those
who were invited because of a pathogenic variant in a less well-
characterized gene (48.1% vs 45.9%, v2 P ¼ .31) (Supplementary
Table 2, available online). Among all invited FDRs who tested
positive, 12.0% (95% CI ¼ 9.2 to 14.8%) continued the cascade by
inviting additional FDRs.
Of FDRs who tested (Figure 2A), 48.1% (95% CI ¼ 45.4 to 50.8%)
carried the identified familial pathogenic variant (consistent
with their stated first-degree genetic relationship to carriers)
and 4.9% (95% CI ¼ 3.8 to 6.1%) a different pathogenic variant. Of
these unexpected pathogenic variants, 42.4% (95% CI ¼ 30.5 to
54.3%) were in low-penetrance alleles (specifically APC I1307K,
CHEK2 I157T, and MUTYH heterozygotes), 37.9% (95% CI ¼ 26.2 to
49.6%) in less well-characterized cancer risk genes (specifically
ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CHEK2, MITF, NBN, RAD51C, and RAD51D),
and 19.7% (95% CI ¼ 10.1 to 29.3%) in syndromic genes (specifi-
cally BRCA1/2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) (Figure 2B). Of
tested FDRs, 16.8% (95% CI ¼ 14.7 to 18.8%) had a variant of un-
certain significance, and 54.5% (95% CI ¼ 48.0 to 61.1%) of these
also had a pathogenic variant.
Cascade testing for cancer susceptibility gene mutations
faces substantial challenges. Despite recent cost declines, test-
ing often costs $500 or more and may lack insurance coverage:
Medicare does not cover preventive genetic testing of cancer-
free relatives. In the US, privacy regulations prohibit direct con-
tact of relatives by patients’ clinicians, which concentrates the
burden of informing relatives on carriers themselves. Cascade
testing
rates
in
specialized
genetics
clinics
are
low,
at
approximately 30% of eligible FDRs (12–14). Alternative care
models that allow direct contact of relatives by patients’ clini-
cians can improve testing rates to 50 to 60% (12,14), but have not
been explored in the US. In the model described here, patients
empowered the laboratory to initiate testing by providing FDRs’
email addresses for direct contact. At 47.5%, FDRs’ testing up-
take equaled that of the Lynch Syndrome cascade protocols at
expert centers (15). However, continued cascade testing beyond
one FDR was low (12.0%). Cascade rates beyond the first degree
are not described in the existing literature, which has relied on

 patient report, and the rate documented here should serve as a
benchmark for future studies. While the cascade rate might be
expected to decrease with each successive invitation of rela-
tives, the observed drop-off to 12.0% is likely suboptimal. This
drop-off could reflect limited understanding of test results,
which is the major potential weakness of an online approach
without in-person counseling. While FDRs with pathogenic
results
received
posttest
genetic
counseling
by
telephone
(10,11), pretest counseling was provided only as a video, and in-
formed decision-making outcomes were not measured.
Interestingly, 4.9% of FDRs carried an unexpected pathogenic
variant that the carrier applicant did not share. Previous studies
estimated that 10 to 20% of patients with breast, colon, or ovar-
ian cancer carry germline cancer suspectibility genes (16–19).
Because the FDRs tested here were selected based on their rela-
tionship to a carrier of a different pathogenic variant, and not
for family or personal history of cancer suggesting the patho-
genic variant they were found to carry, their results (outside of
the familial pathogenic variant) may approximate those of the
general population. Even excluding unexpected mutations in
genes with higher prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish popula-
tion (BRCA1, BRCA2, APC I1307K), we estimate that 3.9% (2.9 to
5.0%) of people may carry a pathogenic variant in a cancer sus-
ceptibility gene; this estimate may inform discussion about
population-wide genetic testing.
Study limitations include selection bias (eg, computer liter-
acy) and missing information on the number of relatives eligible
for testing and whether relatives were tested previously. Most
important, this study addresses the first step in cascade
testing—enhancing identification and testing of at-risk FDRs—
but not the essential next steps of engaging FDRs in informed
decision-making about options to manage their risk, such as
screening or preventive surgery. Future research must explore
strategies to extend affordable testing more broadly; to inte-
grate clinician expertise both pre- and posttesting with online
approaches like the one described here; and to enable those
testing positive to understand their cancer risks and access ap-
propriate risk-reducing interventions.
