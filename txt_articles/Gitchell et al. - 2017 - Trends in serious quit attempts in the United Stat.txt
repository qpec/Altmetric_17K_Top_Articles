ABSTRACT
Background and aims
Quitting smoking is the most potent way to reduce the health risks associated with smoking cig-
arettes, and public health objectives in the United States include dramatic increases in the proportion of smokers making a
serious quit attempt eachyear. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has, since 2000, set as its Healthy
People 2020 objective to encourage 80% of smokers to make a serious quit attempt per year. This study assessed the trend
in quit attempts from 2009 to 2014. Design
We examined the percentage of US smokers making a serious quit attempt
each year from 2009 to 2014 from the repeating cross-sectional National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).
Setting
United States. Participants
The number of qualifying respondents per year ranged from 5748 in 2010 to
7219 in 2012, with a total of 40362 respondents included in the analysis. Measurements
Respondents were deemed
to have made a serious quit attempt if they were either current smokers who reported that they stopped smoking for more
than 1 day in the past 12 months because they were trying to quit smoking, or reported being former smokers (smoked
100+ cigarettes life-time, but now not smoking) who quit in the past year. Findings
Analyses of trends from 2009 to
2014 showed an overall linear increase in quit attempts [odds ratio (OR) = 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01–
1.04, P = 0.0075], but also a quadratic trend (OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 1.00–1.02, P = 0.0189). Conclusions
The propor-
tion of US smokers making a serious quit attempt has increased since 2009, due to an upward trend since 2011. The 2014
serious quit attempt rate was 55.0%. These rates are still below the Healthy People 2020 objective of 80% of smokers mak-
ing a serious quit attempt per year.

INTRODUCTION
Cigarette smoking remains the single largest behavioral
contributor to premature death and disability in the high-
income world, and is fast achieving this status in the
middle- and low-income world. Accordingly, efforts to re-
duce its toll remain public health and public policy priori-
ties [1]. Long-established and accepted approaches to
reduce smoking-related morbidity and mortality include ef-
forts to prevent uptake by youth, reduce exposure to smoke
among non-smokers and encourage and support quit at-
tempts among current smokers. Promoting quitting
among current smokers has the greatest near-term effect
on morbidity and mortality, as current smokers are subject
to near-term harms [2,3].
Total smoking cessation in a population is the product
of the proportion of smokers making a quit attempt
multiplied by their success rate [4,5]. As a result, public
health programs have focused both on boosting quit at-
tempts and improving their success rate. Zhu et al. [6]
and Aveyard & Raw (2012) [7] have noted that we have
had only modest success at increasing quit attempts, both
in the United States and globally. The US Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (CDC) has, since 2000, set
as its Healthy People objective to encourage 80% of
smokers to make a serious quit attempt per year [8], yet
only 52.4% of smokers made a quit attempt in 2010 [9].
To monitor progress on this goal, we examined esti-
mates of past-year quit attempts to evaluate recent trends.

 starting with 2009 was that the last nation-wide and sub-
stantial policy intervention expected to impact quitting—a
62-cent increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes—
occurred in 2009 [10], and presentation of prior data
had already been published [9].
The NHIS is a multi-purpose health survey conducted
by the CDC and is the principal source of information on
the health of the civilian, non-institutionalized, household
population of the United States. This analysis is based on
adult (18+ years of age; younger respondents were not
asked questions about smoking) current (some days and
every day) smokers and former smokers who had quit in
the past year. Respondents whose current smoking status
was unknown were excluded from the analyses. The yearly
samples consisted of 5748 (2010) to 7219 (2012) qualify-
ing respondents (smokers and ex-smokers) per year
(total = 40362 respondents), and were weighted to reflect
the US adult population.
A serious quit attempt was defined following the meth-
odology used by the CDC in their analysis of the 2001–10
NHIS data (2011). Respondents were deemed to have
made a serious quit attempt if they were either current
smokers who reported that they stopped smoking for more
than 1 day in the past 12 months because they were trying
to quit smoking, or reported being former smokers (smoked
100+ cigarettes life-time, but now not smoking) who had
quit in the past year.
Logistic regression models were used to assess both lin-
ear and quadratic trends in serious quit attempts by year.
The quadratic model included both linear and quadratic
terms. No higher-order models were considered.
Due to the complex NHIS sample design, analyses were
conducted using SAS-Callable SUDAAN version 11.0.1
and SAS version 9.4.
RESULTS
Serious quit attempt rates by year are shown in Table 1.
Analyses of trends from 2009 to 2014 showed an overall
linear increase in serious quit attempts [odds ratio
(OR) = 1.02 per year, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01–
1.04, P = 0.0075], but also a quadratic trend1 (OR = 1.01,
95% CI = 1.00–1.02, P = 0.0189). During this time-
period, the proportion of serious quit attempts that ended
in abstinence increased slightly, from 21.2% of all serious
quit attempts in 2009 to 22.4% in 2014 (see Table 1);
however, this increase is not significant (linear trend
P = 0.1604; quadratic trend P = 0.5689). As evident in
Fig. 1, the proportion of smokers making a serious quit at-
tempt did not change from 2009 to 2011 (linear trend
P = 0.1941, OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.93–1.02), but
increased significantly beginning in 2011 (OR = 1.05,
95% CI = 1.02–1.08, P = 0.0008; see Fig. 1), which ac-
counts for the quadratic trend.
DISCUSSION
The proportion of smokers making a serious quit attempt
increased from 2009 to 2014, but this was due entirely
1Estimates reported for the full 2009–14 analysis were generated using a logistic regression model including both linear and quadratic terms for year. This
model was found to fit significantly better than a model including only the linear term (t(df = 1) = 11.16, P = 0.0284).

 to increased quitting activity in 2012 and thereafter: the
curve shows a substantial upward turn in quit attempts
starting in 2012. In fact, the 2014 serious quit attempt
rate (55.0%) represents the highest such rate in NHIS since
the survey was re-designed in 1997. This is an encourag-
ing finding, especially as the CDC reported on state-level
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) quit
attempt data showing no change between 2011 and
2013 [11], prompting the American Cancer Society’s Can-
cer Action Network to observe that: ‘(a)ttempts to quit
using cigarettes by adults stalled between 2011 and
2013…’ [12].
The NHIS data do not themselves explain why quit at-
tempts may have increased during this period. Many fac-
tors can affect quit attempts [5], including substantial
increases in price and taxation [13], but as noted in the In-
troduction the last substantial national increase in ciga-
rette prices was during the first half of 2009, limiting
changes in price as a simple explanation for the phenome-
non. The CDC Tips from Former Smokers (TIPS) campaign
started in the first half of 2012, and pre–post analyses of
population cohorts has demonstrated that TIPS increases
quit efforts [14–17].
Another hypothesized influence on quit attempts is the
awareness and use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes).
Some have expressed concern that the use of e-cigarettes,
or even just awareness of e-cigarettes, might reduce quit at-
tempts [18,19], suggesting that quitting activity would de-
cline as e-cigarette awareness and use increase. However,
these data show that quitting activity has been increasing
even as awareness and use of e-cigarettes has been increas-
ing steeply [20–22], which is not consistent with the hy-
pothesis that e-cigarette awareness and use is suppressing
quit attempts.
In any case, the data show that the proportion of cur-
rent smokers making serious quit attempts has been on
the upswing since 2012, and suggest that all efforts should
be made to maintain this momentum, and move towards
the ambitious Healthy People 2020 goal of having 80%
of smokers make quit attempts each year.
