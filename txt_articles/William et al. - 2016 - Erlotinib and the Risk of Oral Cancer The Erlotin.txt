IMPORTANCE Standard molecularly based strategies to predict and/or prevent oral cancer
development in patients with oral premalignant lesions (OPLs) are lacking.
OBJECTIVE To test if the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor erlotinib would reduce
oral cancer development in patients with high-risk OPLs defined by specific loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) profiles. Secondary objectives included prospective determination of
LOH as a prognostic marker in OPLs.
DESIGN The Erlotinib Prevention of Oral Cancer (EPOC) study was a randomized,
placebo-controlled, double-bind trial. Accrual occurred from November 2006 through July
2012, with a median follow-up time of 35 months in an ambulatory care setting in 5 US
academic referral institutions. Patients with OPLs were enrolled in the protocol, and each
underwent LOH profiling (N = 379); they were classified as high-risk (LOH-positive) or
low-risk (LOH-negative) patients based on their LOH profiles and oral cancer history. The
randomized sample consisted of 150 LOH-positive patients.
INTERVENTIONS Oral erlotinib treatment (150 mg/d) or placebo for 12 months.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Oral cancer–free survival (CFS).
RESULTS A total of 395 participants were classified with LOH profiles, and 254 were classified
LOH positive. Of these, 150 (59%) were randomized, 75 each to the placebo and erlotinib
groups. The 3-year CFS rates in placebo- and erlotinib-treated patients were 74% and 70%,
respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 1.27; 95% CI, 0.68-2.38; P = .45). The 3-year CFS was
significantly lower for LOH-positive compared with LOH-negative groups (74% vs 87%, HR,
2.19; 95% CI, 1.25-3.83; P = .01). Increased EGFR gene copy number correlated with
LOH-positive status (P < .001) and lower CFS (P = .01). The EGFR gene copy number was not
predictive of erlotinib efficacy. Erlotinib-induced skin rash was associated with improved CFS
(P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this trial, LOH was validated as a marker of oral cancer risk
and found to be associated with increased EGFR copy number (the target of the
intervention). Erlotinib did not, however, improve CFS in high-risk patients with LOH-positive
or high-EGFR-gene-copy-number OPLs. These results support incorporation of LOH testing as
a prognostic tool in routine clinical practice but do not support erlotinib use in this setting.

O
ral premalignant lesions (OPLs), often clinically rec-
ognized as leukoplakia or erythroplakia, are consid-
ered risk factors for development of oral cancer. Oral
premalignant lesions are a clinical manifestation of what can
be a diffuse process of field cancerization. In patients with
treated head and neck cancers, field cancerization contrib-
utes to development of second primary tumors, a significant
cause of morbidity and mortality.1 Systemic chemopreven-
tion has been proposed as a method to address the entire mu-
cosal field at risk to halt or reverse carcinogenesis.2 However,
a standard head neck cancer chemoprevention approach has
yet to be developed, despite extensive previous clinical inves-
tigations of various retinoids,3-7 interferon,8 celecoxib,9
ONYX-015,10 and Bowman Birk inhibitor concentrate,11 among
other candidate preventive drugs.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a criti-
cal role in oral epithelial carcinogenesis and is the only vali-
dated molecular target for which an agent (ie, the monoclo-
nal antibody cetuximab) has been approved to treat head and
neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs).12,13 However, the
intravenous weekly administration of cetuximab imposes a
limitation for long-term preventive use. In contrast, EGFR ty-
rosinekinaseinhibitors(eg,erlotinib)aredosedorallyandhave
demonstratedmodestactivityagainstinvasiveHNSCC,14-16ren-
dering them reasonable choices for evaluation for oral cancer
chemoprevention.
Even within patients with oral premalignant lesions, the
reported risk of malignant transformation is highly variable,17
and applying a chemoprevention strategy is best justified if
focused on individuals at highest cancer risk.18 To date, no
robust prognostic marker has been developed to guide rou-
tine clinical management. Our group and others19-21 have
reported that specific loss of heterozygosity (LOH) profiles
in OPLs were associated with an increased risk of cancer in
patients with or without a history of oral cancer in retro-
spective case-control and prospective cohort observational
studies.

vious studies, to our knowledge this is the first trial of OPLs
designed with a definitive primary end point of oral cancer
development—a critical aspect, given the lack of correlation
between premalignant lesion response and oral cancer–free
survival (CFS).5 This is also the first randomized clinical trial
in the entire cancer prevention field to utilize molecular risk
assessment as a core selection strategy, thus attempting to
develop a chemopreventive approach based on precision
medicine.
Methods
The EPOC trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, multicenter study involving 5 institutions in the
United States. The study was approved by the institutional re-
view boards of each institution. The trial protocol is available
for review in Supplement 1. Written informed consent was ob-
tained from all patients prior to participation.
Eligibility
Participants were eligible for LOH screening if they had his-
tologicevidenceoforalpremalignantlesionswithin1yearprior
to enrollment, with or without a history of oral cancer. Pa-
tients with a premalignant lesion at the margins of a cancer re-
section were eligible. The EPOC trial used a convergent trial
design in which individuals with premalignant lesions with or
without previously treated oral cancers were included in the
same trial, with LOH used as the common high-risk eligibility
criterion, but oral cancer history was accounted for as a strati-
fication factor.18,22
Molecular risk assessment was based on LOH profiles in
the OPL and was performed centrally real time at MD Ander-
son Cancer Center19-21 (eMethods in Supplement 2). Treating
physicians were notified of the results via a web-based sys-
tem. High-risk LOH profiles (LOH-positive cases) were
defined as LOH at 3p14 and/or 9p21 in participants with a
history of oral cancer or LOH at 3p14 and/or 9p21 plus an
additional chromosomal site (17p, 8p, 11p, 4q, or 13q) in par-
ticipants without a history of oral cancer, based on previ-
ously published data.20,21 All other cases were considered
LOH negative.
Only LOH-positive patients were eligible for randomiza-
tion in EPOC. Additional main eligibility criteria included East-
ern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status less than
2, normal organ and bone marrow function, and no active
invasive cancer within the previous 2 years (with the excep-
tion of oral cancers and nonmelanoma skin cancers). One
informed consent document was used for molecular testing
and participation in the active treatment portion of the proto-
col. However, prior to randomization, eligible patients signed
the consent form again if the time from initial consent to ran-
domization was greater than 1 month, according to institu-
tional policies.

namic allocation method was applied to achieve balanced ran-
domization with respect to smoking status (current, former,
and never smoker) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
use. Subjects were randomized to the erlotinib arm or the pla-
cebo arm with equal probability by a centralized computer sys-
tem. The investigators, clinicians, and patients were blinded
to the treatment arm assignments.
Treatment with erlotinib (at a starting dose of 150 mg/d
orally)ormatchingplacebowasinitiatedinadouble-blindfash-
ion after randomization. Dose reductions for erlotinib to 100
mg/d orally and subsequently 50 mg/d orally were allowed in
accordance with protocol-defined toxic effects criteria (trial
protocol in Supplement 1).
Treatment continued for a maximum of 12 months, un-
less participants developed oral cancer or intolerable toxic ef-
fects or withdrew treatment consent (see eMethods in
Supplement 2 for further details). Rationale for the 1-year treat-
ment period was based on the expectation of a therapeutic
effect of promoting cell death and elimination of LOH-
positive premalignant clones during use of the EGFR inhibi-
tor, balanced by the ability of relatively asymptomatic
patients to tolerate full therapeutic doses of the drug (with
potential for adverse effects) for an extended period in the
prevention setting.
The EGFR gene copy number was evaluated in pretreat-
ment biopsy specimens by fluorescence in situ hybridization,
as previously described23 (eMethods in Supplement 2).
Statistical Considerations
The primary end point of the study was oral CFS, defined as
timefromrandomizationtodevelopmentofhistologicallycon-
firmed oral cancer or death in the intent-to-treat population.
For events that had not occurred by the time of the analysis,
times were censored at the last contact at which the patient
was known to be alive and oral cancer free. The distribution
of CFS was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. A strati-
fiedlog-ranktest(stratifiedbypriororalcancerstatus)wasused
for the comparison of CFS between the treatment and pla-
cebo group. A log-rank test was performed to compare differ-
ences between groups.
The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used
to incorporate potential prognostic factors including age, sex,
smokinghistory,alcoholuse,numberofpriororalcancers,time
from last oral cancer to the randomization, histologic find-
ings, and treatment assignment as covariates. The interac-
tion effect between treatment and a covariate such as EGFR
gene copy number on CFS was evaluated using the Cox pro-
portional hazards regression model by including the main ef-
fect terms of treatment and EGFR gene copy number and the
interaction term. The proportional hazards assumption for the
Cox proportional hazards model was evaluated. No model vio-
lations were detected.
Regression diagnostics (eg, generalized residuals, Martin-
gale residuals, and Shoenfeld residuals) were examined to en-
sure that the models were appropriate. The Fisher exact test
was used to compare EGFR gene copy number between LOH-
positive and LOH-negative groups. Exploratory landmark
analysis was performed to investigate the relationship be-
tween grade 2 or higher rash at 1 month and improved oral CFS
in the erlotinib arm, consistent with previous studies.24
The proposed sample size was 150 randomized patients,
whichwascalculatedbasedonthefollowingassumptions:100
patients with and 50 patients without a history of oral can-
cer; accrual over a 2-year period, with an additional 2.5 years
of follow-up; and oral cancer rates of 65% and 35% at 3 years
in patients with21 and without19 a history of oral cancer, re-
spectively. With these parameters, the study would have 85%
powertodetecta40%erlotinib-inducedreductioninthe3-year
oral cancer rate (corresponding to a hazard ratio [HR] of 0.47),
with a 2-sided type I error rate of .05. Subgroup analyses of the
efficacy of erlotinib in patients with and without a history of
oral cancer were prespecified. We aimed at a relatively large
treatment effect that could optimize benefit-risk and benefit-
cost ratios. We expected erlotinib to be associated with
moderate adverse effects and significant costs. Therefore, we
reasoned that further clinical development of this drug in the
prevention setting would only be justified if cancer incidence
could be reduced in a high proportion of patients.
Two interim analyses for efficacy monitoring were
planned, at the end of years 2.5 and 3.5. However, we con-
ducted only 1 interim analysis as planned at the time when 23
events were observed. This first interim analysis found no sta-
tistically significant difference in CFS at the .0005 level be-
tween the 2 treatment groups, so the study was not termi-
nated early. This interim analysis had minimal effect on the
significance level of the final analysis. The P values were com-
pared with the O’
Brien-Fleming boundary, which has already
taken the multiple testings under consideration. We did not
performthesecondplannedinterimanalysisbecausethenum-
ber of events never reached 49 at the planned time for the sec-
ond interim analysis while the trial was ongoing. The final
analysis was to be performed at the end of year 4.5, but this
was delayed to year 7 to allow at least 12 months’follow-up
after randomization of the last participant.
The study was monitored by the MD Anderson Data Safety
Monitoring Board (DSMB) every 6 to 12 months and was al-
lowed to proceed until its completion. The timing of database
freeze was approved by the DSMB, with the assumption that
the longer-than-expected recruitment period leading to ex-
tended follow-up of patients initially enrolled in the study
would compensate for the shorter follow-up time for later en-
rollees, thus minimizing further delays in the readout of the
primary end point.
Results
From November 2006 until July 2012, 379 participants were
consented, registered, enrolled, and tested for LOH. Four par-
ticipants had noninformative LOH results and were excluded
from further analyses, yielding 375 participants classified as
either LOH negative (n = 121, 32%) or LOH positive (n = 254,
68%). Of the 254 LOH-positive patients, 150 (59%) were ran-
domizedtoerlotinib(n = 75,50%)orplacebo(n = 75,50%)and
initiated treatment. All randomized patients were eligible for
evaluation of the primary end point of oral CFS (Figure 1). At

the time of the analysis, 78% of the censored patients had been
followed for 2 years or longer.
Patient Characteristics
The characteristics of enrolled patients according to LOH and
randomization status are described in the Table and eTable 1
in Supplement 2.
Effect of Erlotinib on Oral CFS
After a median follow-up time of 35 months for the surviving
participants, 40 patients developed oral cancer, yielding a cu-
mulative incidence of oral cancer of 27% in the randomized
population. There were no statistically significant differ-
ences in oral CFS between the placebo and erlotinib groups
(P = .45, stratified log-rank test, Figure 2). There was a trend
toward improved oral CFS during the initial 12-month treat-
ment period for the erlotinib group, but this effect was not sta-
tisticallysignificantorsustained.The3-yearoralCFSrateswere
74% and 70% for the placebo- and erlotinib-treated patients,
respectively(HR,1.27;95%CI,0.68-2.38;P = .45,stratifiedCox
proportional hazards model). There were 10 deaths in the ran-
domized population (6 in the erlotinib group [4 from oral can-
cer, 1 from lung cancer, 1 from brain cancer], 4 in the placebo
group [3 from oral cancer, 1 unknown]).
Toxic Effects and Treatment Characteristics
eTable 2 in Supplement 2 describes the grade 2 and 3 toxic ef-
fects that occurred in 10% or more of the participants. As ex-
pected, erlotinib-treated patients experienced more derma-
tologic toxic effects, diarrhea, fatigue, and mucositis than did
those in the placebo group. There were only 2 other grade 3
toxic effects (cellulitis and dehydration) and 1 grade 4 toxic ef-
fect (diarrhea), occurring in 1 erlotinib-treated patient each.
There were no treatment-related deaths. Dose reductions were
required in 45% of patients randomized to erlotinib and 1% of
those receiving placebo (eTable 3 in Supplement 2). The main
reason for dose reductions and/or treatment interruptions was
adverse events. Dose intensity and compliance, as assessed by
pill counts, are reported in eTable 3 in Supplement 2. Nonste-
roidal anti-inflammatory drugs were used by 20 randomized
patients during the 36-month trial period.
LOH as a Marker of Oral Cancer Risk
Therewasastatisticallysignificantdifferencein3-yearoralCFS
rate between the LOH-positive group (74%) and the LOH-
negative group (87%) (HR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.25-3.83; P = .01)
(Figure3A).Onmultivariateanalysiswithadjustmentsbynum-
berofpriororalcancers,histologicfindings,andtreatment,the
difference in CFS between LOH-positive and LOH-negative
groupsremainedsignificant(HR,2.20;95%CI,1.16-4.19;P = .02)
(eTable 4 in Supplement 2).
Exploratory Analyses
There was a statistically significant association between EGFR
gene copy number and LOH-positive status (P < .001) (eTable
5 in Supplement 2), providing further rationale for EGFR tar-
geting in this patient population. Increased EGFR gene copy
number was associated with inferior oral CFS (HR, 2.11;
95% CI, 1.19-3.75; P = .01) (Figure 3B). The combination of
LOH-positive status and increased EGFR gene copy number
conferred the highest cancer risk (P = .02) (Figure 3C).
Figure 4A depicts erlotinib effects on oral CFS in sub-
groups of interest. No clear benefit from erlotinib was identi-
fied in any subgroup, including increased EGFR gene copy
number, with P > .05 for all interaction tests.
An exploratory landmark analysis found a significant as-
sociation between grade 2 or higher rash at 1 month and im-
proved oral CFS in the erlotinib arm (84% vs 55% 3-year CFS;
P = .01),(Figure4B).NoassociationsbetweenoralCFSanddose

Discussion
To our knowledge, the EPOC trial represents the first molecu-
larly based precision medicine trial design in cancer preven-
tion, and the first study of OPLs to use cancer as the primary
end point. This trial established that targeting EGFR with er-
lotinibinpatientswithhigh-riskOPLsdidnotimproveoralCFS.
The EPOC trial established LOH as the most robust OPL prog-
nostic molecular marker prospectively validated to date. We
observed a novel association between LOH-positive status and
increased EGFR gene copy number and identified EGFR gene
copy number as a marker of oral cancer risk. However, EGFR
gene copy number (the target of erlotinib) was not a predic-
tive marker of drug efficacy in this setting.
We chose the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib as the agent for this
trial because EGFR plays a critical role in oral carcinogenesis
andistheonlyclinicallyvalidatedmoleculartargetinheadand
neck cancer therapy. Gain in EGFR gene copy number in OPLs
was correlated with an increased risk of oral cancer develop-
ment in a retrospective analysis.23 In mouse models of OPLs,
treatment with erlotinib reduced development of pre-
malignant and malignant lesions.25 Early-phase clinical trials
suggest that targeting EGFR26,27 or EGFR downstream signal-
ing (eg, cyclin D1)8 may be effective in treating OPLs. How-
ever, the EPOC trial did not demonstrate an oral CFS benefit
(even in lesions with increased EGFR gene copy number) from
erlotinib in LOH-positive participants despite a trend toward
delayed cancer development during the 12-month erlotinib
intervention.
The EPOC trial found that the erlotinib-induced rash was
a strong positive predictor of improved CFS, which is consis-
tent with data from cancer therapy trials.24,28,29 Rash is con-
sidered a pharmacodynamic marker of EGFR-inhibitor drug
exposure.24,30 The high rate of dose reductions owing to oc-
currence of toxic effects, however, suggests that increased
doses of erlotinib may not be tolerated in this setting. Alter-
natively, EGFR-inhibitor rash may reflect host-derived prog-
nostic factors regardless of drug level, as suggested by recent
studies of specific gene polymorphisms30 and innate immu-
nity in animal models.31
We observed an association of the core selection criteria
for EPOC (LOH profiles) with the target of the drug interven-
tion(EGFR).AlthoughEGFRgenecopynumbergaininthisset-
ting could be due to a nonspecific manifestation of genomic
instability (marked by the phenomenon of LOH), there is also
biologic plausibility for a mechanistic link to the specific LOH
lociincludedinEPOCeligibility,suchas3p14(FHITgene),9p21
(p16INK4a/CDKN2Agene),and17p(TP53gene).Inheadandneck
cancer,cyclinD1overexpression(adownstreamtargetofEGFR)
seems to precede and enhance permissiveness for genomic in-
stability and gene amplification,32 which could potentially ex-
plain our findings of a correlation between LOH-positive (and
genomically unstable) lesions and increased EGFR gene copy
number. Based on recent findings33,34 and our present data,
one can postulate that genotoxic or replicative stress (whether
mediated or not by EGFR) may lead to cyclin D1 activation and

genomic instability resulting in either the loss of chromo-
somal fragments, including key “caretaker” tumor suppres-
sor genes (eg, TP53 and CDKN2A), or gain and loss of whole
chromosomes (eg, chromosome 7 polysomy) and EGFR
amplification.35 Increased EGFR copy number could, in turn,
serve as a positive feedback loop, stimulating cell prolifera-
tion further, particularly within the context of p16INK4a loss (as
reflected by LOH at 9p21),34,36 thus leading to growth advan-
tage, selection, and malignant transformation. Indeed, non–

izedbyamplificationofEGFR(7p12)andCYCLIND1(11q13)and
deletion of FHIT (3p14) and CDKN2A (9p21).37 Likewise, a cor-
relation of EGFR gene amplification and CDKN2A deletion has
also been reported in glioblastomas.38
Regardlessofmechanism,lesionswithbothLOHandEGFR
gain were at highest cancer risk. The 2-hit (LOH and EGFR/
chromosome 7 polysomy) genomic instability-driven model
may explain the lack of erlotinib efficacy found in the EPOC
trial. These high-risk OPLs may have already accumulated ad-
ditional changes leading to the persistent activation of signal-
ing pathways operating downstream or independently from
EGFR. For example, LOH in 3p is often accompanied by copy
number gains in 3q26,39 an amplicon that includes the PIK3CA

Conclusions
In summary, despite the importance of EGFR biology to head
and neck neoplasia and the strength of the preclinical and pre-
liminary clinical data, erlotinib did not reduce the risk of oral
cancer in patients with LOH-positive OPLs, including lesions
with increased EGFR gene copy number. Nonetheless, the
EPOC trial demonstrated prospectively the role of LOH as a
marker of cancer risk in OPLs and supports its use as a prog-
nostic tool in clinical practice. The novel approach in the EPOC
trial of selecting a molecularly defined high-risk population
most likely to benefit, allowing the first streamlined OPL trial
designed with the clinically meaningful definitive end point
of invasive cancer, is a new paradigm for future precision can-
cer chemoprevention trials.
