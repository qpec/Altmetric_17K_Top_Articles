Abstract
BACKGROUND—Zika virus (ZIKV) has been linked to central nervous system malformations 
in fetuses. To characterize the spectrum of ZIKV disease in pregnant women and infants, we 
followed patients in Rio de Janeiro to describe clinical manifestations in mothers and 
repercussions of acute ZIKV infection in infants.
METHODS—We enrolled pregnant women in whom a rash had developed within the previous 5 
days and tested blood and urine specimens for ZIKV by reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-
reaction assays. We followed women prospectively to obtain data on pregnancy and infant 
outcomes.
RESULTS—A total of 345 women were enrolled from September 2015 through May 2016; of 
these, 182 women (53%) tested positive for ZIKV in blood, urine, or both. The timing of acute 
ZIKV infection ranged from 6 to 39 weeks of gestation. Predominant maternal clinical features 
included a pruritic descending macular or maculopapular rash, arthralgias, conjunctival injection, 
and headache; 27% had fever (short-term and low-grade). By July 2016, a total of 134 ZIKV-
affected pregnancies and 73 ZIKV-unaffected pregnancies had reached completion, with outcomes 
known for 125 ZIKV-affected and 61 ZIKV-unaffected pregnancies. Infection with chikungunya 
virus was identified in 42% of women without ZIKV infection versus 3% of women with ZIKV 
infection (P<0.001). Rates of fetal death were 7% in both groups; overall adverse outcomes were 
46% among offspring of ZIKV-positive women versus 11.5% among offspring of ZIKV-negative 
women (P<0.001). Among 117 live infants born to 116 ZIKV-positive women, 42% were found to 
have grossly abnormal clinical or brain imaging findings or both, including 4 infants with 
microcephaly. Adverse outcomes were noted regardless of the trimester during which the women 
were infected with ZIKV (55% of pregnancies had adverse outcomes after maternal infection in 
the first trimester, 52% after infection in the second trimester, and 29% after infection in the third 
trimester).

 CONCLUSIONS—Despite mild clinical symptoms in the mother, ZIKV infection during 
pregnancy is deleterious to the fetus and is associated with fetal death, fetal growth restriction, and 
a spectrum of central nervous system abnormalities. (Funded by Ministério da Saúde do Brasil and 
others.)
We have been conducting active surveillance for dengue infection in the general population 
of Rio de Janeiro since 2007. In 2012, we established a prospective cohort for dengue 
surveillance in mother–infant pairs within the Manguinhos Rio de Janeiro area. In 2015, we 
noted an increase in cases of a dengue-like illness that was characterized by a descending 
rash, generally without fever; this increase coincided with a surge in the number of cases of 
illness characterized by a pruriginous rash in northeastern Brazil.1 In early 2015, most cases 
were originally reported to surveillance systems as dengue; however, Zika virus (ZIKV) was 
eventually identified.2–8 To identify ZIKV cases in our population, we modified our 
pregnancy cohort study and enrolled women who presented with a rash at any week of 
gestation. This report is a follow-up to a previously published preliminary report, available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.
METHODS
STUDY POPULATION
In this cohort study, pregnant women at any week of gestation who presented to the acute 
febrile illness clinic at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation with a rash that had developed within 
the previous 5 days were offered enrollment and were included in the study after they had 
provided written informed consent. After the women were enrolled, detailed demographic, 
medical, and prenatal history information, as well as clinical findings, were entered into 
case-report forms. Laboratory data on rubella, cytomegalovirus, and Venereal Disease 
Research Laboratory (VDRL) serologic testing were abstracted from prenatal medical 
records and entered in case-report forms. Serum and urine specimens were obtained at study 
entry. Weekly follow-up was conducted by telephone, and a second visit was scheduled 
within 30 days after enrollment for clinical and laboratory follow-up. Women were referred 
for fetal ultrasonography before 20 weeks of gestation, between 20 and 30 weeks of 
gestation, and after 30 weeks of gestation. No women had had a diagnosis of fetal 
malformations in the current pregnancy before enrollment. The study population was 
generally healthy; women reported no coexisting conditions or medication use. Infants born 
to ZIKV-positive mothers are being followed prospectively.
STUDY OVERSIGHT
The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at Fundação Oswaldo 
Cruz (Fiocruz) and the University of California, Los Angeles. The authors vouch for the 
accuracy and completeness of the data and the analyses and for the fidelity of the study to 
the protocol.
LABORATORY TESTING
Real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays for ZIKV were 
performed with the QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR kit (Qiagen), as described previously,9 with

 the same primers and cycle times, at the Fiocruz Flavivirus Laboratory; assays were 
performed on blood specimens, urine specimens, or both that were obtained at the entry 
visit. The Fiocruz Flavivirus Laboratory is a reference laboratory for flavivirus infections in 
the region. Serologic testing for IgG antibodies to dengue (Abcam) and IgM antibodies to 
chikungunya (Euroimmun) were performed on serum specimens obtained at the entry visit. 
Patient specimens were also tested by RT-PCR for dengue10 and chikungunya.9 Patients 
were tested for parvovirus B19 and cytomegalovirus by PCR (TaqMan RT PCR, Applied 
Biosystems) and by serologic testing during regular prenatal care. PCR assays for human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) DNA (Abbott RT HIV Viral Load) were performed on all 
patient specimens. Screening tests for syphilis were performed during prenatal care with the 
use of VDRL assays, with treponemal assays (Alere Determine Syphilis) used as 
confirmatory tests.
FETAL ULTRASONOGRAPHY
All abdominal scanning was performed with a 4-to-8-mHz probe (Voluson 730 Expert/
Voluson E6, GE) by perinatologists who were certified by the Brazilian College of 
Radiology and the Brazilian Federation of Societies of Gynecology and Obstetrics 
(Febrasgo). The variables that were measured are listed in the Supplementary Appendix, 
available at NEJM.org. For Doppler studies, the pulsatility index of the umbilical artery and 
of the middle cerebral artery were used.11 Abnormalities such as cerebral calcifications and 
microcephaly were noted. Measured fetal ultrasonographic variables were plotted by 
gestational age according to the nomograms published on www.perinatology.com. Fetal 
growth restriction was defined as fetal weight estimated according to the Hadlock formula 
that was below the 10th percentile.12 Microcephaly in fetal imaging was defined as fetal 
head measurements (e.g., head circumference) that were two standard deviations below the 
mean expected at a particular gestational age or below the 3rd percentile.13
INFANT CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS
Anthropometric measures at birth (weight, length, and head circumference) were obtained in 
all live-born infants. History taking and physical examinations were performed for all infants 
by pediatric specialists. ZIKV-exposed infants were evaluated by a multidisciplinary team 
that included neonatologists, neurologists, infectious disease specialists, geneticists, 
ophthalmologists, and physical therapists. All abnormal diagnoses were reviewed by a panel 
of specialists for confirmation. Microcephaly was defined as a head-circumference z score of 
less than −2 (moderate) or less than −3 (severe). Small-for-gestational-age infants were 
defined as infants with body-weight z scores of less than −1.28 at birth.14
INFANT IMAGING STUDIES
Brain imaging studies were offered for infants born to mothers who had positive PCR results 
for ZIKV. Transfontanel ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) of the head with and 
without contrast, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; AERA Siemens, 1.5 tesla) with or 
without contrast were performed according to the standard of care. If abnormalities were 
suspected on transfontanel ultrasonography, patients were referred for CT or MRI brain 
imaging. All infant assessments were conducted with knowledge of ZIKV infection status.

 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We compared the demographic and clinical variables of pregnant women who were positive 
for ZIKV on PCR with those who were negative for ZIKV on PCR, using Fisher’s exact test 
(two-sided); P values of 0.05 or less were considered to indicate statistical significance. We 
performed similar analyses comparing pregnancy and infant outcomes in ZIKV-infected and 
ZIKV-uninfected mother–infant pairs. For comparison of medians, an independent-samples 
median test was used. Comparisons of negative pregnancy outcomes according to maternal 
trimester of infection between ZIKV-infected and ZIKV-uninfected mother–infant pairs were 
compared with the use of McNemar’s test.
RESULTS
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PARTICIPANTS
During the period from September 2015 through May 2016, we enrolled 345 pregnant 
women and tested blood specimens, urine specimens, or both for ZIKV by qualitative RT-
PCR. Of these 345 women, 182 (53%) had positive results for ZIKV on PCR in blood, urine, 
or both. The current report focuses on 134 ZIKV-positive women and 73 ZIKV-negative 
women who were expected to deliver by July 31, 2016 (Fig. 1). Among the 134 ZIKV-
positive women, quantitative ZIKV PCR results were available for 130 (4 PCR assays were 
performed at outside facilities). Among women with quantitative PCR results, 85 had 
positive PCR results in serum specimens, 76 had positive PCR results in urine, and 31 had 
positive PCR results in both specimens; 45 women had positive results in urine only and 54 
had positive results in blood specimens only (median number of PCR cycles for serum 
specimens, 32.0; inter-quartile range, 30.0 to 34.0; range, 24.2 to 37.0; and median number 
of PCR cycles for urine specimens, 30.0; interquartile range, 27.0 to 33.0; range, 22.0 to 
37.0). Demographic and clinical characteristics are described in Table 1. Among ZIKV-
positive women, 38% reported similar illnesses in other family members, and only 14% 
reported that their partner had been ill. ZIKV infection was present in women of all 
socioeconomic strata. More than half the women presented with acute infection in the 
second trimester of pregnancy. ZIKV-negative women were more likely to have used insect 
repellent than ZIKV-positive women (83% vs. 60%, P = 0.006), but otherwise there were no 
significant differences in demographic characteristics or medical history between the two 
groups. ZIKV-positive women resided across multiple neighborhoods and municipalities 
within the larger metropolitan Rio de Janeiro area (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF THE MOTHERS
All pregnant women had rash as part of their clinical presentation, since rash was an 
inclusion criterion. A descending macular or maculopapular rash was the most common type 
of exanthem noted in ZIKV-positive women (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
maculopapular rash was seen far more frequently in ZIKV-positive women than in ZIKV-
negative women (P = 0.02). The other prevalent finding was pruritus, which was seen in 
90% of ZIKV-positive women in our study. The next most common finding was arthralgia, 
which was reported in 62% of ZIKV-positive women and in 70% of ZIKV-negative women 
(P = 0.29). Conjunctival injection was present in 58% of ZIKV-positive women and in a 
smaller percentage (40%) of ZIKV-negative women (P = 0.03). Fatigue or malaise was

 described in 52% of ZIKV-positive women versus 75% of ZIKV-negative women (P = 
0.002), and myalgia was described in 41% versus 62% (P = 0.005); the higher rates among 
ZIKV-negative women were probably due to the diagnosis of underlying chikungunya virus 
in some ZIKV-negative women. Lymphadenopathy (isolated or generalized) was present in 
both groups (in 38% of ZIKV-positive women and 27% of ZIKV-negative women, P = 0.12). 
Fever was not a highly prominent finding, occurring in less than a third of the women with 
acute ZIKV infection but in 58% of ZIKV-negative women (P<0.001). When fever was 
present, it was generally short-term and low grade (37.5 to 38.0°C). Nausea or vomiting was 
reported in 31% of ZIKV-positive women and was more common (occurring in 44%) among 
ZIKV-negative women (P=0.07).
OUTCOMES OF PREGNANCIES
Among 134 women who had positive results for ZIKV on PCR testing, information on 
confirmed outcomes of pregnancy was available for 125, with 117 live births in 116 
pregnancies (one set of twins) between January 1 and July 31, 2016. There were 9 cases of 
fetal death (Fig. 1 and Table 2, and Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix): 5 
miscarriages in the first trimester of pregnancy, 2 miscarriages in the second trimester, and 2 
stillbirths in the third trimester. Among 73 ZIKV-negative women, 61 had known outcomes, 
including 4 cases of fetal death and 57 live births. In the ZIKV-positive group, 93% of the 
women remained in the study, whereas retention in the ZIKV-negative group was 84% (P = 
0.03).
Three of seven negative pregnancy outcomes in the ZIKV-negative group — two of the four 
fetal losses and one small-for-gestational-age infant — occurred in women with 
chikungunya virus. One of the first-trimester miscarriages in the ZIKV-positive cohort 
occurred in a woman who was coinfected with ZIKV and chikungunya virus. Three ZIKV-
infected patients (2.8%) were coinfected with chikungunya virus; however, chikungunya 
infection was more prevalent in the ZIKV-negative group (42%, P<0.001) (Table 2). No 
patients in either group were found to have active dengue infection on PCR; however, prior 
dengue infection was very common, with 88% in the ZIKV-positive group and 86% in the 
ZIKV-negative group having IgG antibodies to dengue. One woman in each group had a 
positive treponemal syphilis test; those pregnancies did not have adverse outcomes. No 
women had evidence of active cytomegalovirus infection by either PCR or IgM detection. 
Among ZIKV-negative women, 29 other infections were identified, including 23 cases of 
chikungunya, 4 cases of parvovirus B19, and 1 case of syphilis. None of the women were 
found to have HIV by RT-PCR testing.
Among 125 pregnancies in ZIKV-positive women, 58 adverse pregnancy outcomes were 
noted (46.4%); in contrast, 7 of the 61 pregnancies (11.5%) in the ZIKV-negative cohort 
resulted in adverse outcomes (P<0.001). Despite the high rate of adverse outcomes in our 
control group of pregnant women with other infectious illnesses, the findings in the ZIKV-
positive group were far more striking. Adverse pregnancy outcomes by the timing of 
maternal ZIKV infection are shown in Figure 2. The timing of maternal ZIKV infection 
ranged from 6 to 39 weeks of gestation. Adverse outcomes after ZIKV infection occurred 
regardless of the timing of maternal infection; adverse outcomes occurred in 55% of

 pregnancies in which the mother was infected in the first trimester (11 of 20 ZIKV-infected 
pregnancies), in 52% of those in which the mother was infected in the second trimester (37 
of 71 ZIKV-infected pregnancies), and in 29% of those in which the mother was infected in 
the last trimester of pregnancy (10 of 34 ZIKV-infected pregnancies). Among ZIKV-infected 
pregnancies, there were 5 miscarriages (25% of the 20 pregnancies with first-trimester 
infection), 2 fetal losses (3% of the 71 pregnancies with second-trimester infection); and 2 
stillbirths (6% of the 34 pregnancies with third-trimester infection). Among 117 live births 
in the ZIKV-positive cohort, 49 infants (42%) were found to have abnormalities on clinical 
examination, imaging, or both; in contrast, among 57 live births in the ZIKV-negative 
cohort, 3 infants (5%) had such abnormalities (P<0.001).
Three infants with abnormalities who were born to ZIKV-negative women were small for 
gestational age; one was born to a woman who was found to have chikungunya virus 
infection. Because of the large number of chikungunya infections in the control group, 
adverse pregnancy outcomes were also frequent in this group. There was no significant 
difference in the rate of fetal loss between ZIKV-positive mothers and ZIKV-negative 
mothers (7.2% and 6.6%, respectively; P = 1.0). Obstetrical complications were very high in 
both groups: 39% in ZIKV-positive women and 35% in ZIKV-negative women (P=0.62). 
ZIKV-positive women, however, were nearly 10 times as likely as ZIKV-negative women to 
have emergency cesarean sections performed owing to fetal distress (23.5% vs. 2.5%, P = 
0.003) (Table 2). Infants born to ZIKV-positive mothers were also nearly 4 times as likely to 
need critical care assistance immediately after birth (a finding that is reflective of fetal 
distress) as infants who had not been exposed to ZIKV (21% vs. 6%, P = 0.01).
A total of 153 ultrasound studies were performed in 59 women who were found to be 
positive for ZIKV during pregnancy; the remaining 75 ZIKV-positive women declined 
imaging studies either because the obstetrical facility was too far away or because of fear of 
possible fetal abnormalities related to ZIKV infection. Detailed ultrasonographic findings 
are described in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix. ZIKV-negative women underwent 
fetal ultrasonography as part of regular prenatal care. All the women in the cohort received 
prenatal care. Nine women with ZIKV infection (6.7%) were lost to follow-up (i.e., did not 
seek prenatal care at our obstetrical facility and were unable to be reached for further 
evaluation despite multiple attempts; pregnancy outcomes are unknown). Included among 
these 9 women was 1 woman whose fetus had severe abnormalities on fetal ultrasonography. 
In the ZIKV-negative cohort, 12 women (16%) were lost to follow-up, mainly because of a 
change in their contact information. ZIKV-negative women did not deliver at our obstetrical 
facility. In addition, women were less likely to continue follow-up in the study if ZIKV 
infection was ruled out.
INFANT OUTCOMES
Infants who were small for gestational age, as a potential consequence of fetal growth 
restriction or poor placental perfusion, constituted 9% of ZIKV-exposed babies and 5.3% of 
babies in the control group (P = 0.06). Four infants in the ZIKV-positive group (3.4%) were 
noted to have microcephaly at birth; two were small-for-gestational-age infants with 
proportionate microcephaly (i.e., the head size is small but is proportional to the weight and

 length of the infant), and two had disproportionate microcephaly (i.e., the head size is small 
relative to the weight and length of the infant). None of the infants in the control group had 
microcephaly. Fetal growth variables for fetuses of ZIKV-positive women who had 
ultrasonography performed during pregnancy are shown in Figure 3, and anthropometric 
measurements, including birth weight and head circumference, of live-born infants in both 
groups are shown in Figure 4 and Table 3.
A total of 49 of the 117 live-born infants (42%) who had been exposed to ZIKV in utero had 
abnormal findings in the first month of life (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Almost all the abnormalities affected the central nervous system (CNS). Microcephaly was 
observed in infants whose mothers were infected in weeks 8, 12, 30, and 38 of gestation. 
Disproportionate microcephaly was seen only in infants infected in the first trimester of 
pregnancy; 2 infants infected in later trimesters had proportionate microcephaly and were 
small for gestational age. One of the infants with disproportionate microcephaly was also 
small for gestational age. Cerebral calcifications, cerebral atrophy, ventricular enlargement, 
and hypoplasia of cerebral structures were seen in multiple infants, with cerebral 
calcifications seen in infants infected as late as 34 weeks of gestation. Parenchymal brain 
hemorrhages were seen in some infants, including one whose mother was infected shortly 
before delivery at 39 weeks of gestation. A total of 31 of the 49 infants (63%) had grossly 
abnormal results on neurologic examinations; hypertonicity, clonus, hyperreflexia, abnormal 
movements, spasticity, contractures, and seizures were identified. Abnormal funduscopic 
examinations and abnormal hearing assessments were also noted.
Other features that were identified included persistence of the cortical thumb sign, with 
maintained clenched fists beyond 3 months of age, which reflects CNS disease; foveas in the 
knees or elbows due to limb contractures in utero; and redundant scalp skin in infants with 
normal head circumference. MRIs have not been performed in all infants to date. 
Conversely, a number of infants with normal clinical assessments in early infancy had 
abnormal nonspecific MRI findings; a common description was “excessive hypersignaling in 
T2 in the white matter, diffuse in the peritrigonal posterior areas and less evident in the 
frontal parietal white matter with hyposignaling in the diffusion sequence.” These findings 
are abnormal and may reflect cortical tract dysfunction; nevertheless, close follow-up will be 
needed to ascertain the degree of CNS involvement.
Two infants were born large for gestational age owing to maternal gestational diabetes; one 
of these infants, born to a mother who had been infected at 15 weeks of pregnancy, was 
found to have congenital heart disease, which probably was associated with maternal 
gestational diabetes, although we cannot exclude the possibility of a potential association 
with ZIKV infection. Follow-up of ZIKV-exposed infants is ongoing.
DISCUSSION
ZIKV is a flavivirus that was recently introduced into Brazil. Its rapid expansion into a 
population that is probably fully susceptible is due to the effectiveness of its vector, the 
Aedes aegypti mosquito. Diagnosis of ZIKV infection in Brazil has been complicated by the 
cross-reactivity among flavivirus antibodies and by the fact that dengue has been endemic in 
Brasil et al.

 Brazil for more than 30 years. Serosurveillance studies have found evidence of dengue 
antibodies in more than 90% of the population of Recife.15 In our cohort, dengue IgG 
antibodies were present in 88% of the women, but no patients were found to have acute 
dengue infection. The diagnosis of ZIKV infection in Brazil relies on identification of the 
virus through RT-PCR during the acute period of infection. The virus is detectable in blood 
during the period of acute viremia and initial symptoms and subsequently is shed in the 
urine, generally for 3 to 14 days.16 Because RT-PCR assays for ZIKV are generally not 
available, most cases of ZIKV infection in Brazil are diagnosed clinically, without 
laboratory confirmation. In our study, 134 women who were positive for ZIKV had acute 
infection with virus that was detected in blood, urine, or both.
Nevertheless, the starting point in our cohort study was an illness with rash in a pregnant 
woman who presented to our clinic. As more women presented with a similar illness, we 
dichotomized the illnesses into two groups on the basis of the results of PCR testing for Zika 
virus infection. However, a number of clinical categories relating to the illnesses clearly 
indicate that the illnesses in the Zika-negative women differed from those in the Zika-
positive women. Zika-negative women were more likely to have nausea, vomiting or 
anorexia, fatigue or malaise, myalgia, respiratory symptoms, and fever than were Zika-
positive subjects. Also the exanthems generally differed between the two groups. As 
compared with women who tested negative for acute ZIKV infection, women who tested 
positive for the virus had distinctive clinical features that included conjunctival injection and 
a maculopapular pruritic rash. The presence of these clinical features should raise suspicion 
for ZIKV infection. Low-grade fever was observed in 27% of the women; therefore a case 
definition that is based on the presence of fever would miss more than 70% of cases.17
The potential cause of illness in the ZIKV-uninfected women is known in some of the cases. 
Rio de Janeiro saw a rise in the number of chikungunya virus cases as of April–May 2016, 
coinciding with a decline in ZIKV cases. No patients were identified with ZIKV in our 
cohort after May 2016. Chikungunya virus was responsible for 42% of the infections in our 
control group and coinfected three ZIKV-positive women. Additional infections identified 
were parvovirus B19 in four ZIKV-negative women and two cases of syphilis, but no 
adverse pregnancy or infant outcomes were noted in these six patients.
Whether sexual transmission of ZIKV played a role in transmission to pregnant women in 
our cohort is difficult to assess, since couples usually cohabitate and would presumably have 
the same type of vector exposure. ZIKV-positive women more frequently had a history of 
affected family members than ZIKV-negative women.
Links between the current ZIKV epidemic in Brazil and the rise in the number of observed 
cases of neonatal microcephaly have generated considerable debate about whether the 
observed phenomenon is real and, if so, whether microcephaly is a direct effect of ZIKV or 
whether it could be due to potential environmental exposure of pregnant women to 
teratogenic agents.18 There is now a growing body of evidence that suggests a causality link 
between ZIKV and neonatal structural malformations.19–21 Both prenatal and postnatal 
imaging studies in our cohort showed serious and frequent problems in CNS development in 
utero, as well as in fetal development overall, with such problems affecting 46% of 125

 pregnancies and 42% of 117 live-born infants. Though the clinical illness in women has 
similarities to rubella,22 the effects in the unborn infants differ. With rubella, the time 
window for adverse outcomes in utero occurs in the first 16 weeks of pregnancy.23–25 In 
contrast, with ZIKV, the time window appears to be throughout pregnancy. ZIKV 
pathogenicity was evident in our cohort even in the presence of a “control” group that was 
affected by chikungunya virus, which is also linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes, 
particularly fetal loss.26
Fetuses infected in the first trimester had findings suggestive of pathologic change during 
embryogenesis, but CNS abnormalities were seen in fetuses infected as late as 39 weeks of 
gestation, which underscores the CNS viral tropism. Potential findings suggestive of 
placental insufficiency were identified in infants who were born small for gestational age or 
who were born after signs of fetal distress. Microcephaly as detected by ultrasonography and 
confirmed at birth was noted in four cases (3.4%), but in only one case was it an isolated 
finding that was not present in conjunction with fetal growth restriction. Nevertheless, two 
cases of microcephaly were found to be disproportionate. Although microcephaly has been 
widely discussed in relation to ZIKV infection, it is important to note that other findings 
such as cerebral calcifications and fetal growth restriction were present more frequently. 
Many of the clinical and radiographic abnormalities identified in our cohort have been 
described in prior case series.27,28 We have observed a variety of neurologic findings, 
including visual and hearing deficits, seizure activity, hypertonicity, spasticity, hyperreflexia, 
contractures, dysphagia, and feeding difficulties. A troubling aspect of our study is that 
children were assessed in early infancy, when some subtle neurologic manifestations of 
disease are difficult to identify. On further follow-up, we suspect that additional clinical 
manifestations of neurologic disease may be identified in infants who were not previously 
found to have abnormalities.
Our results should be interpreted with caution since they reflect individual neurologic 
assessments and imaging performed in early infancy and with knowledge of in utero ZIKV 
infection status. All infants are still being monitored and will be periodically reevaluated 
with neurodevelopmental assessments. It is important to note that the potential effect of 
asymptomatic ZIKV infection during pregnancy was not assessed in this cohort.
In summary, our data show that the risk of severe adverse pregnancy and infant outcomes 
after maternal ZIKV infection was substantial.

 Figure 1. Prospective Maternal Cohort and Pregnancy Outcomes
Among 134 ZIKV-positive women, 9 were lost to follow-up before delivery and 125 had 
outcomes that could be evaluated; 116 of these pregnancies resulted in 117 live-born babies 
(there was one set of twins); 9 pregnancies ended in fetal death. One ZIKV-positive mother 
who had a miscarriage was coinfected with chikungunya virus; two ZIKV-negative mothers 
whose pregnancies ended in fetal death were infected with chikungunya virus. Three infants 
of ZIKV-negative mothers were small for gestational age at birth (listed as “abnormalities on 
examination”); one was born to a mother with confirmed chikungunya virus infection.

 Figure 2. Pregnancy and Infant Outcomes According to the Week of Gestation at the Time of 
ZIKV Infection
Adverse outcomes included 9 cases of fetal death in 125 pregnancies (7.2%) and 49 
abnormal clinical findings, imaging findings, or both during the newborn period in 117 
infants (42%) born from 116 pregnancies. Adverse outcomes occurred in women who were 
infected during the period from 6 to 39 weeks of gestation. Abnormalities are detailed in 
Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix.

 Figure 3. Fetal Biometric Variables as Measured on Ultrasonography
Fetal measurements of biparietal diameter (Panel A), head circumference (Panel B), and 
estimated fetal weight (Panel C), plotted according to gestational age, are shown for each 
fetus of ZIKV-positive women who had ultrasonography performed during pregnancy. 
Dotted lines show the 10th and 90th percentiles for gestational age, based on established 
nomograms from www.perinatology.com. Fetal weight curves are based on the Hadlock 
formula, in which a measurement of less than the 10th percentile is considered to indicate 
fetal growth restriction. Microcephaly was defined as a head circumference of more than 2 
standard deviations below the mean expected for gestational age. Symbols denote the

 trimester of PCR-documented infection (first trimester, <14 weeks; second trimester, 14 to 
28 weeks; third trimester, ≥29 weeks). Repeat measurements for the same fetus are 
connected with a solid line to show growth trajectory. Results for fetuses with abnormal 
findings are denoted in color and labeled with maternal patient number. Not all 
measurements were obtained for every fetus at each ultrasound examination.

 Figure 4. Infant Anthropometric Measures at Birth
Shown are measurements of head circumference at birth in infant boys (Panel A) and girls 
(Panel B) and estimated birth weight in infant boys (Panel C) and girls (Panel D), according 
to gestational age at birth. A total of 117 live infants were born to women in our cohort who 
had positive results for ZIKV on polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assays, and 57 were born 
to women who had negative PCR results for ZIKV. Small for gestational age was defined as 
a z score for birth weight of less than −1.28. Microcephaly was defined as a z score of less 
than −2 (moderate) and less than −3 (severe).
