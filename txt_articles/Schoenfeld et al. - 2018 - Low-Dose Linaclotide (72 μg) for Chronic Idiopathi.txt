OBJECTIVES: 
 
 
Linaclotide is a guanylate cyclase-C agonist approved in the United States, Canada, and Mexico at 
a once-daily 145-μ 
g dose for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC); a once-daily 
72-μ 
g dose for CIC recently received FDA approval. The trial objective was to evaluate the effi
 cacy 
and safety of a 72-μ 
g linaclotide dose in CIC patients.
 
METHODS: 
 
This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomized patients with CIC (Rome III criteria) to once-
daily linaclotide 72 
μ 
g or 145 
μ 
g, or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint, 12-week complete 
spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) overall responder, required patients to have ≥3 CSBMs and an 
increase of ≥1 CSBM per week from baseline in the same week for ≥9 of 12 weeks of the treatment 
period. Secondary endpoints included 12-week change from baseline in bowel (SBM and CSBM 
frequency, stool consistency, straining) and abdominal (bloating, discomfort) symptoms, monthly 
CSBM responders, and 12-week CSBM responders among patients who averaged >1 SBM/week at 
baseline. Sustained response (12-week CSBM overall responders who met weekly criteria for 3 of the 
4 fi
 nal weeks (weeks 9–12) of treatment) was evaluated as an additional endpoint. Adverse events 
(AEs) were monitored.
 
RESULTS: 
 
The intent-to-treat population included 1,223 patients (mean age=46 years, female=77%, 
white=71%). The primary endpoint was met by 13.4% of linaclotide 72-μ 
g patients vs. 4.7% of 
placebo patients ( 
P 
<0.0001, odds ratio=3.0; statistically signifi
 cant controlling for multiplicity). 
Sustained response was achieved by 12.4% of linaclotide 72-μ 
g patients vs. 4.2% of placebo 
patients (nominal  
P 
<0.0001). Linaclotide 72-μ 
g patients met 9-of-10 secondary endpoints 
vs. placebo ( 
P 
<0.05; abdominal discomfort,  
P 
=0.1028). Patients treated with linaclotide 
145 
μ 
g also improved CIC symptoms for the primary (12.4%) and sustained responder endpoint 
parameters (11.4%) and for all 10 of the secondary endpoint parameters including abdominal 
discomfort ( 
P 
<0.05). Diarrhea, the most common AE, was mild in most instances and resulted in 
discontinuation of 0, 2.4%, and 3.2% of patients in the placebo, linaclotide 72-μ 
g, and linaclotide 
145-μ 
g groups, respectively.
 
CONCLUSIONS:  
Once-daily linaclotide 72 
μ 
g signifi
 cantly improved CIC symptoms in both men and women with a low 
rate of discontinuation due to diarrhea over 12 weeks of treatment.

INTRODUCTION
 
Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) is a functional bowel 
disorder characterized by infrequent defecation, hard and diffi
  -
cult-to-pass stools, a sense of incomplete evacuation, and oft
 en, 
abdominal bloating and/or discomfort ( 
1–3 
). Approximately 15% 
of the general population report experiencing symptoms consist-
ent with CIC ( 
4 
). Th
 e prevalence of CIC is higher in women than 
men and increases with age ( 
5 
).
 
Linaclotide is a potent peptide agonist of the guanylate cyclase 
C (GC-C) receptor located on the luminal surface of the intes-
tinal epithelium. Activation of GC-C increases cyclic guanosine 
monophosphate (cGMP) production, resulting in increases in 
lumenal chloride, bicarbonate, and fl
 uid secretion ( 
6–8 
). Linaclo-
tide increases intestinal transit and reduces visceral hypersensitiv-
ity in animal models; in patients with irritable bowel syndrome 
with constipation (IBS-C), linaclotide improves abdominal pain 
and other abdominal symptoms, such as discomfort and bloat-
ing. Th
 ese eff
 ects may be related to cGMP modulation of aff
 erent 
nerve activity ( 
9–13 
). Linaclotide is approved in the United States, 
Canada, and Mexico for the treatment of chronic idiopathic con-
stipation (CIC) and IBS-C, and in the European Union (EU), 
Hong Kong, Japan, and Switzerland for the treatment of IBS-C 
( 
12–14 
).
 
A previous Phase 2b dose-range-fi
 nding study was conducted in 
301 patients with CIC and evaluated once daily linaclotide doses 
of 72, 145, 290, and 580 μ 
g. All four linaclotide doses were well 
tolerated and met the primary endpoint of change from baseline 
in SBM frequency over the 4-week treatment period ( 
P 
<0.05 vs. 
placebo); in addition, an increasing treatment eff
 ect was observed 
with higher doses for key secondary endpoints ( 
15 
). To ensure that 
an eff
 ective dose was identifi
 ed for CIC patients, the 145-μ 
g and 
290-μ 
g dose levels were evaluated in two large phase 3 trials ( 
14 
). 
Both doses met the primary endpoint of a 12-week CSBM overall 
responder with little diff
 erence between the two doses in the sec-
ondary effi
  cacy endpoints or in their adverse event profi
 les. Th
 ere-
fore, the lowest eff
 ective dose, 145 μ 
g, was approved by the FDA for 
the treatment of CIC. A subsequent trial demonstrated that lina-
clotide (145 μ 
g) was effi
  cacious at treating men and women with 
CIC and prominent abdominal bloating ( 
16 
). In order to ensure 
that patients with all levels of CIC severity (from mild to severe) 
have a dosing option with linaclotide and because patients diff
 er 
in their response to linaclotide treatment, an additional dosing 
option of less than 145 μ 
g is desirable. Th
 e 72-μ 
g dose of linaclo-
tide was selected as a potentially safe and eff
 ective option for CIC 
patients based on its demonstrated effi
  cacy in the previous phase 
2b study ( 
15 
).
 
Th
 e primary objective of this trial was to investigate the effi
  cacy 
and safety of linaclotide 72 μ 
g administered once daily to patients 
with CIC.
 
METHODS
 
Trial design
 
Th
 is 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group trial included patients at 105 clinical 
centers in the United States from October 2014 (fi
 rst patient con-
sented) through August 2015 (last patient completed). Th
 e trial 
was designed, conducted, and reported in compliance with the 
ethical principles that have their origins in the Declaration of 
Helsinki and the principles of Good Clinical Practice guidelines. 
Prior to their participation in the study, all patients reviewed and 
signed an informed consent form approved by an institutional 
review board. Th
 e trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (registra-
tion number NCT02291679).
 
During an initial screening period of up to 21 days, patients 
provided blood and urine for routine testing and were instructed 
to discontinue any prohibited medications (eg, anti-cholinergics, 
opioids) for at least 14 days (24 h for non-steroidal anti-infl
 am-
matory drugs if taken for abdominal pain or discomfort, and for 
laxatives) before the start of baseline assessments. Eligible patients 
meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria then entered the 
14-day baseline period, during which they used an interactive 
voice response system (IVRS) to provide daily and weekly symp-
tom assessments. Patients who continued to meet eligibility crite-
ria were then randomized to linaclotide 72 μ 
g, 145 μ 
g, or placebo 
for 12 weeks.
 
In addition to a screening visit, study site visits occurred at the 
start of the baseline period (day −14) and throughout the treat-
ment period (day 1 and at week 2, 4, 8, and 12 visits). All personnel 
involved in the design and implementation of the trial remained 
blinded until the database was locked and the results tables were 
generated.
 
Trial patients
 
Patients were men and women aged 18 years or older who met 
modifi
 ed Rome III criteria for CIC ( 
17 
). Th
 e criteria included 
<3 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs: BMs occurring in the 
absence of laxative, suppository, or enema use during the preced-
ing 24 h) per week and at least one of the following symptoms 
during ≥25% of BMs for at least 12 weeks (not necessarily con-
secutive) within the preceding 6 months: straining, lumpy or 
hard stools, and a sensation of incomplete evacuation. In addi-
tion, patients needed to report having an average of ≤6 SBMs 
and <3 complete SBMs (CSBMs: SBMs associated with a sensa-
tion of complete evacuation) per week during the 14-day base-
line period. Patients also needed to demonstrate compliance with 
IVRS, requiring adequate completion of IVRS questions on ≥10 of 
14 days of the baseline period. Patients were required to have met 
American Gastroenterological Association colonoscopy guideline 
requirements ( 
18 
).
 
Patients were excluded if they reported loose or watery stools 
(Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) ( 
19 
) score of 6 or 7) in the absence 
of laxative, suppository, enema, or other prohibited medication use 
for >25% of BMs during the 12 weeks preceding the trial; mushy 
stool (BSFS score of 6) for>1 SBM, or a watery, liquid stool (BSFS 
score of 7) for any SBM during the baseline period; or met the 
Rome III criteria for irritable bowel syndrome ( 
17 
). Other key 
exclusion criteria included structural GI abnormalities or condi-
tions aff
 ecting GI motility; prior diagnosis of infl
 ammatory bowel 
disease; a diagnosis or family history of a familial form of colorectal

cancer; active peptic ulcer disease; a history of diverticulitis or any 
chronic condition that could be associated with abdominal pain or 
discomfort; a history of fecal impaction requiring hospitalization; 
or a history of cathartic colon, laxative or enema abuse, ischemic 
colitis, or pelvic fl
 oor dysfunction. Patients were excluded if they 
had: undergone bariatric surgery or any type of intestinal resec-
tion; abdominal or pelvic surgery 6 months prior to screening; 
appendectomy or cholecystectomy 60 days prior to screening; or 
other major surgery 30 days prior to screening.
 
Rescue medication (bisacodyl tablet or suppository) use was 
not allowed on the day before, day of, or day aft
 er randomiza-
tion (protocol-defi
 ned bisacodyl rescue medication was other-
wise allowed during the baseline and treatment periods, when 
≥72 h had passed since the patient’
s previous BM or when symp-
toms became intolerable). Patients who were on a stable dose of 
fi
 ber, bulk laxatives, or stool soft
 eners during the 30 days prior to 
screening were permitted to continue using these products dur-
ing the trial.
 
Effi
 cacy assessments and endpoints
 
Daily reports by patients via the IVRS included the number of 
BMs since the previous day’
s call and whether rescue medication 
was used during that time. For each BM, patients then reported: 
whether the BM was associated with a sensation of complete emp-
tying (yes/no); stool consistency (7-point BSFS; 1=“separate hard 
lumps like nuts [diffi
  cult to pass]” to 7=“watery, no solid pieces 
[entirely liquid]”); and severity of straining (5-point ordinal scale; 
1=“not at all” to 5=“an extreme amount”). Daily patient reports 
also included rating of abdominal bloating, abdominal discom-
fort, and abdominal pain at its worst during the previous 24 h, 
each rated by the patient on an 11-point numerical rating scale 
(NRS; 0=“none”
, 10=“very severe”).
 
Weekly IVRS assessments included constipation severity 
(5-point ordinal scale; 1=“none” to 5=“very severe”), adequate 
relief of constipation symptoms (yes/no), and degree of relief of 
constipation symptoms (7-point balanced scale; 1=“completely 
relieved” to 7=“as bad as I can imagine”).
 
Additional assessments were performed at specifi
 ed patient vis-
its to the study center. Treatment satisfaction was measured using a 
5-point ordinal scale (1=“not at all satisfi
 ed”
, 5=“very satisfi
 ed”) at 
weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12; and disease-specifi
 c quality of life was meas-
ured using the validated Patient Assessment of Constipation—
Quality of Life (PAC-QOL) instrument ( 
20 
).
 
Primary endpoint 
 
. 
  
Th
 e primary effi
  cacy endpoint of the trial 
was the 12-week CSBM overall responder. A 12-week CSBM 
overall responder was a patient who was a CSBM weekly 
responder for ≥9 of the 12 weeks of the treatment period. 
A CSBM weekly responder for a treatment period week was 
a patient who had a CSBM weekly frequency rate that was ≥3 
and increased by ≥1 from baseline, based on a minimum of 
four complete IVRS calls for that week. Bowel movements that 
occurred within 24 h following rescue medication use were not 
considered spontaneous and were therefore not counted for the 
effi
  cacy endpoints.
 
Secondary and additional endpoints 
 
. 
  
Secondary endpoints were 
pre-specifi
 ed, controlled for multiplicity, and compared the li-
naclotide 72-μ 
g group with the placebo group. Secondary end-
points included 12-week average change from baseline in stool 
frequency (CSBM and SBM frequency rate), stool consistency, 
straining, abdominal bloating, and abdominal discomfort. Sec-
ondary responder endpoints included an analysis of the primary 
endpoint parameter (12-week CSBM overall responder) for the 
subgroup of patients who averaged >1 SBM per week during the 
baseline period, and monthly CSBM responders, in which re-
sponders were to meet weekly CSBM responder criteria for ≥3 
of 4 weeks of the treatment month specifi
 ed (month 1, month 2, 
or month 3).
 
Additional endpoints included: 12-week CSBM sustained 
responder (a sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint), which 
required patients to be CSBM weekly responders for ≥9 of 12 
weeks, including ≥3 of the last 4 weeks (Weeks 9–12) of the treat-
ment period; 12-week degree of relief of constipation symptoms 
responder, which required patients to report their constipation 
symptoms as ‘
somewhat’
, ‘
considerably’
, or ‘
completely’
 relieved 
(i.e., ≤3) for all 12 weeks of the treatment period, or ‘
considerably’
 
or ‘
completely’
 relieved (i.e., ≤2) for at least 6 of 12 weeks of the 
treatment period; 12-week change from baseline in constipation 
severity and in abdominal pain; and treatment satisfaction at week 
12 and PAC-QOL (change from baseline to week 12).
 
Safety assessments
 
Treatment emergent adverse events were elicited/identifi
 ed at 
each study visit using non-leading questions. Reports of diarrhea 
were all captured in a manner consistent with other spontane-
ous AEs, without consideration of other factors (i.e., stool con-
sistency, perception of “bothersomeness”). Th
 e site investigator 
assessed all patient-reported adverse events (AEs) and serious 
AEs (SAEs) and determined their severity (mild, moderate, or 
severe) and relationship to study treatment (unrelated, unlikely, 
possible, probable, defi
 nite). Other safety evaluations included 
physical examinations, vital sign measurements, and standard 
clinical laboratory tests.
 
Statistical methods and data analysis
 
 
Eligible patients were stratifi
 ed by baseline SBM frequency (i.e., 
those with >1 SBM/week and those with ≤1 SBM/week) and were 
randomly assigned to one of three double-blind treatments (72-μ 
g 
or 145-μ 
g linaclotide or matching placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio using a 
block size of six through a central randomization. Th
 e treatment 
sequence was generated in SAS by a statistical programmer not 
assigned to this trial and provided securely to the IVRS vendor. 
Trial personnel used the IVRS to assign patients to treatment and 
inform study drug dispensing.
 
Corresponding with the trial’
s primary objective, to determine 
the effi
  cacy and safety of linaclotide 72 μ 
g administered once daily 
to patients with CIC, the primary analysis compared the propor-
tion of responders in the linaclotide 72-μ 
g group with the propor-
tion of responders in the placebo group by employing a 2-sided 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratifi
 ed by baseline SBM

frequency stratum (>1 per week vs. ≤1 per week) and geographical 
region.
 
For each of the change-from-baseline secondary effi
  cacy param-
eters, the linaclotide 72-μ 
g group was compared with the placebo 
group using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with fi
 xed 
eff
 ect terms for treatment group, baseline SBM weekly frequency 
stratum, and geographical region and the corresponding baseline 
value as a covariate. Th
 e ANCOVA model included patients in all 
3 treatment groups. In addition, comparison between the linaclo-
tide 72-μ 
g group and the placebo group on the primary effi
  cacy 
parameter (12-week CSBM overall responder) within the baseline 
SBM frequency >1 per week stratum was conducted by employing 
a 2-sided CMH test stratifi
 ed by geographical region alone. Lastly, 
for each of the monthly CSBM responder parameters, the propor-
tion of responders in the linaclotide 72-μ 
g group was compared 
with the proportion of responders in the placebo group using the 
same methods as the primary effi
  cacy analysis.
 
Th
 e overall family-wise type I error rate for testing the primary 
and secondary effi
  cacy endpoints was controlled at the 0.05 sig-
nifi
 cance level using a fi
 ve-step serial gate-keeping multiple com-
parisons procedure (MCP). Th
 e sample size of 400 patients per 
treatment arm provided 93% power to detect a diff
 erence between 
the placebo and linaclotide 72-μ 
g groups for the primary effi
  cacy 
endpoint. No direct comparisons between the linaclotide 72-μ 
g 
and 145-μ 
g dose groups were performed; however, comparisons 
between the linaclotide 145-μ 
g and placebo groups were per-
formed for all effi
  cacy parameters, but were not controlled for 
multiplicity.
 
Patients were assumed not to have had BMs or to have taken 
rescue medications if the corresponding daily question was not 
answered. If a patient dropped out of the trial or otherwise did 
not report the effi
  cacy data for a particular treatment-period week 
(patients were required to complete at least 4 IVRS calls during 
a treatment week), the patient was not considered a responder 
for that week. An observed-cases approach to missing data was 
applied to the change-from-baseline secondary endpoints, such 
that if a patient dropped out of the study or otherwise did not 
report data, the average of the non-missing data over the 12 weeks 
of the treatment period was the patient’
s value. All  
P 
-values were 
based on two-sided tests.
 
Safety endpoints were summarized descriptively. Counts and 
percentages were utilized for treatment-emergent adverse events 
and potential clinically signifi
 cant fi
 ndings; n, mean, and standard 
deviation were computed for continuous safety measures.
 
 
All randomized patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug 
were included in safety analyses (safety population) and the intent-
to-treat (ITT) population.
 
RESULTS
 
Patient disposition, demographics, and baseline characteristics
 
 
Of the 2,244 patients who provided informed consent, 1223 
patients were randomized and received at least one dose of trial 
medication ( 
Figure 1 
). Because all patients received the treat-
ment to which they were randomized, the ITT and safety popula-
tions were identical. A total of 1,078 patients (88.1%) completed 
all 12 weeks of the treatment period. Th
 e treatment groups were 
generally balanced with respect to demographics, and baseline 
bowel and abdominal symptoms ( 
Table 1 
). Mean compliance rate 
with study drug dosing (assessed by counting pills returned at 
study visits) up to study discontinuation/completion during the 
12-week treatment period was >97%.
 
Effi
 cacy results
 
A total of 13.4% of patients receiving linaclotide 72 μ 
g met the 
12-week CSBM overall responder primary endpoint com-
pared with 4.7% of patients receiving placebo ( 
P 
<0.0001; odds 
ratio=3.0, 95% confi
 dence interval=1.8, 5.2;  
Figure 2 
). Th
 ese 
results were comparable to the approved linaclotide 145 μ 
g dose 
group, in which 12.4% of patients met responder criteria (nomi-
nal  
P 
<0.0001; OR=2.8, 95% CI=1.6, 4.9). Nominal  
P 
-values are 
presented for the 145-μ 
g dose, as these results were not controlled 
for multiplicity. Sustained response, defi
 ned as 12-week CSBM 
overall responder+weekly responder for ≥3 of the fi
 nal 4 weeks 
of treatment, was signifi
 cantly higher in the linaclotide 72-μ 
g 
and 145-μ 
g groups compared to placebo: 12.4, 11.2, and 4.7% of 
patients in the linaclotide 72, 145 μ 
g, and placebo groups, respec-
tively ( 
Table 2 
).
 
For fi
 ve of the six secondary 12-week change-from-baseline 
endpoints, the linaclotide 72-μ 
g group demonstrated statistically 
signifi
 cant improvements compared with placebo ( 
Table 2 
). Th
 e 
mean number of CSBMs and SBMs per week increased during 
treatment with linaclotide 72 μ 
g by 1.7 and 2.4, respectively (both 
 
P 
<0.0001). Mean stool consistency score in the linaclotide 72-μ 
g 
group was 3.6, an increase of 1.7 from baseline, compared to 3.0, an 
increase of 1.1 from baseline, for the placebo group ( 
P 
<0.0001). 
Th
 e 
linaclotide 72-μ 
g group also had 12-week-change-from-baseline 
improvements in abdominal symptoms (11-point NRS) relative 
to placebo, including improvement in abdominal bloating (−1.4 
for 72 μ 
g vs. −1.1 for placebo;  
P 
=0.0063) and abdominal pain (an 
additional study endpoint, −1.2 for 72 μ 
g vs. −1.0 for placebo; 
nominal  
P 
=0.0183). For each of these parameters, improvement 
was seen during the fi
 rst week of treatment and was sustained 
throughout the trial ( 
Figure 3 
). Weekly change-from-baseline 
results over the 12 weeks of treatment for the linaclotide 145-μ 
g 
group were similar to the 72-μ 
g group, with modest dose ordering 
observed ( 
Table 2 
,  
Figure 3 
).
 
 
For the remaining secondary endpoints, signifi
 cantly higher 
percentages of linaclotide 72-μ 
g patients met monthly CSBM 
responder criteria for months 1, 2, and 3 of the treatment period, 
respectively, compared with placebo patients (

was reported to be mild or moderate in severity. Severe diarrhea 
was reported by 3 patients (0.7%) in the placebo group, 2 patients 
(0.5%) in the linaclotide 72-μ 
g group, and 10 patients (2.4%) in 
the linaclotide 145-μ 
g group. Of the patients who developed diar-
rhea, 10.7% of patients in the placebo group had onset within 
the fi
 rst 7 days of treatment, compared with 54.4% in the linaclo-
tide 72-μ 
g group and 51.6% in the linaclotide 145-μ 
g group; the 
median times to onset of the fi
 rst episode of diarrhea were 33.5 
days in the placebo group compared with 5.0 days and 7.0 days in 
the linaclotide 72-μ 
g and 145-μ 
g groups, respectively. No SAEs of 
diarrhea were reported during the trial. No clinically signifi
 cant 
sequelae (e.g., orthostatic hypotension or dehydration) or occur-
rences of potentially clinically signifi
 cant vital signs or laboratory 
values for sodium, potassium, blood urea nitrogen, or creatinine 
were reported in patients with diarrhea. Diarrhea was the most 
common AE leading to treatment discontinuation, occurring in no 
patients in the placebo group and 2.4% and 3.2% of patients in the 
72-μ 
g and 145-μ 
g groups, respectively. Temporary dose interrup-
tions due to diarrhea not leading to discontinuation were reported 
by 0.7%, 1.2%, and 1.5% of placebo, linaclotide 72-μ 
g, and 145-μ 
g 
patients, respectively.
 
Four serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported by 4 patients 
(1.0%) in the placebo group and included intraductal prolif-
erative breast lesion, constipation, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, 
and asthma. Four SAEs were reported in three linaclotide 72-μ 
g 
patients (0.7%): hypotension, azotemia with concurrent peptic 
reported improvements in constipation severity, abdominal pain, 
treatment satisfaction, and overall PAC-QOL scores compared 
with the placebo patients. For all effi
  cacy parameters, results for 
the linaclotide 145-μ 
g patients were similar to the linaclotide 
72-μ 
g patients, with the 145-μ 
g group generally having slightly 
improved numerical values over the 72-μ 
g group for the change-
from-baseline parameters ( 
Table 2 
). Across the treatment groups, 
mean rescue medication use was <10% of days (8.7–9.5%) during 
the treatment period.
 
Safety
 
During the 12-week treatment period, at least 1 treatment-emer-
gent AE was reported by 107 patients (26.7%) in the placebo 
group, 143 patients (34.8%) in the linaclotide 72-μ 
g group, and 
145 patients (35.3%) in the linaclotide 145-μ 
g group (72-μ

ratio (OR)=1.47; confi
 dence interval (CI) (1.09, 1.98) and 145-μ 
g 
OR=1.50; CI (1.11, 2.02);  
Table 3 
. Most AEs were mild or mod-
erate in severity; severe AEs were reported for 2.5%, 2.2%, and 
3.4% of patients in the placebo, linaclotide 72-μ 
g, and linaclotide 
145-μ 
g groups, respectively. Adverse events led to study discon-
tinuation of 0.5% of placebo patients, 2.9% of linaclotide 72-μ 
g 
patients, and 4.6% of linaclotide 145-μ 
g patients.
 
Th
 e most common AE was diarrhea, which was reported by 
28 (7.0%) placebo patients, 79 (19.2%) linaclotide 72-μ

145-μ 
g patients: colitis and inadequately controlled diabetes melli-
tus. One SAE, the colitis in the linaclotide 145 μ

sidered possibly related to study drug; none of the other SAEs were 
considered by the investigators to be treatment-related. Th

DISCUSSION
 
 
In this trial of patients with chronic constipation, linaclotide 72 μ 
g 
once daily achieved statistical signifi
 cance (controlling for multi-
plicity) for the primary endpoint and 9 of 10 secondary endpoints 
when compared to placebo. Th
 e primary endpoint (12-week 
CSBM overall responder) required patients to have ≥3 CSBMs 
and an increase from baseline of ≥1 CSBM, within the same week, 
for ≥9 of 12 weeks. Th
 is is a particularly rigorous endpoint, when 
considering that the average baseline CSBM rate among patients 
in this trial was 0.2 per week and 76% reported 0 CSBMs. Th
 e 
linaclotide 72-μ 
g dose also achieved statistical signifi
 cance for the 
sustained responder endpoint, which required patients meeting 
the 12-week CSBM overall responder to also be weekly respond-
ers for ≥3 of the last 4 weeks of the treatment period. Monthly 
CSBM responders to 72-μ 
g linaclotide increased numerically

As in previous linaclotide studies, AEs were elicited from 
patients via non-leading questions and were all recorded and 
analyzed; “diarrhea” was not objectively defi
 ned as part of the AE 
reporting process. Th
 us, it is diffi
  cult to interpret whether diarrhea 
reported as an AE simply represented a signifi
 cant change in stool 
consistency or frequency, as would be expected from a drug like 
linaclotide, or truly represented an adverse event. For patients with 
chronic constipation, looser stools may be welcome, and in lina-
clotide clinical trials are actually associated with higher treatment 
satisfaction ( 
21 
). A better measure of the impact of diarrhea on 
patients than simple prevalence may be to look at dropout rates 
due to diarrhea, as this provides a measure of a patient’
s willingness 
to continue therapy. In the present study, dropout rates due to diar-
rhea were low across all groups (<5%). Serious adverse events were 
infrequent and balanced across treatment groups (≤1% of patients 
in any group). In both trials, there were no clinically meaningful 
diff
 erences observed in clinical laboratory or vital signs param-
eters between the linaclotide and placebo groups. Th
 erefore, when 
considering both treatment effi
  cacy and tolerability in clinical 
practice, we hypothesize that patients with milder constipation or 
a greater responsiveness to GC-C agonism may obtain suffi
  cient 
benefi
 t with the 72-μ 
g dose. Similarly, patients with more severe 
from month 1 to 3 and were signifi
 cantly diff
 erent from placebo 
for each month. Less symptomatic patients (i.e., those with >1 
SBM/week during baseline) also showed a signifi
 cant response 
to 72-μ 
g linaclotide compared to placebo with a slightly higher 
response compared to the overall population. All secondary 
endpoints, with the exception of abdominal discomfort, showed 
statistically signifi
 cant improvement with 72 μ 
g of linaclotide 
compared to placebo.
 
Linaclotide 72 μ 
g demonstrated effi
  cacy that was similar to 
linaclotide 145 μ 
g for the responder parameters and the 12-week 
change-from-baseline parameters. Nonetheless, for some of the 
change-from-baseline effi
  cacy endpoints (e.g., CSBM frequency), 
there was a slightly greater eff
 ect with the 145-μ 
g dose than with 
the 72-μ 
g dose. Th
 is modest dose eff
 ect is consistent with dose-
dependent increases in bowel frequency seen in the earlier phase 
2b dose-ranging study of linaclotide ( 
15 
).
 
Consistent with linaclotide’
s pharmacology and established 
safety profi
 le, diarrhea was the most common TEAE. Diarrhea 
infrequently led to discontinuation of treatment (2.4%, 3.2%, and 
0 for linaclotide 72 μ 
g, 145 μ 
g, and placebo, respectively). Severe 
diarrhea was uncommon and was experienced by 0.5%, 2.4%, and 
0.7% of linaclotide 72 μ 
g, 145 μ 
g, and placebo patients.

constipation and abdominal symptoms, or less sensitivity to GC-C 
agonism may benefi
 t from the higher, 145-μ 
g dose.
 
Th
 e results from this trial demonstrate that linaclotide at a daily 
dose of 72 μ 
g for up to 12 weeks is safe and well tolerated, and may 
provide clinicians with an additional dosing option for treating the 
heterogeneous CIC patient population.
 
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
 
We acknowledge the extensive contributions made by the late 
B. Joseph Lavins, MD. We are grateful for his tireless eff
 orts in 
developing linaclotide and advancing guanylate cyclase research. 
He is dearly missed by his colleagues and friends.

Study Highlights
 
WHAT IS CURRENT KNOWLEDGE 
 
✓ 
 
Chronic idiopathic constipation is a highly prevalent and 
heterogeneous disorder. 
 
✓ 
 
Linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase activator, improves symp-
toms of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). 
 
✓ 
 
The heterogeneous nature and severity of CIC results in 
variable treatment responses. 
 
WHAT IS NEW HERE 
 
✓ 
 
72 
μ 
g of linaclotide effectively treats symptoms of CIC. 
 
✓ 
 
The 72-μ 
g dose of linaclotide was well tolerated. 
 
✓ 
 
The most common side effect of the 72-μ 
g dose of linaclo-
tide was diarrhea. 
 
✓ 
 
Most diarrhea adverse events (97%) were mild to moderate 
in severity and discontinuation rates were low (2.4%).
