Abstract
Purpose The optimal radiofrequency (RF) power and lesion duration using contact force (CF) sensing catheters for atrial
fibrillation (AF) ablation are unknown. We evaluate 50 W RF power for very short durations using CF sensing catheters during
AF ablation.
Methods We evaluated 51 patients with paroxysmal (n = 20) or persistent (n = 31) AF undergoing initial RF ablation.
Results A total of 3961 50 W RF lesions were given (average 77.6 ± 19.1/patient) for an average duration of only 11.2 ± 3.7 s. As CF
increased from < 10 to > 40 g, the RF application duration decreased from 13.7 ± 4.4 to 8.6 ± 2.5 s (p < 0.0005). Impedance drops
occurred in all ablations, and for patients in sinus rhythm, there was loss of pacing capture during RF delivery suggesting lesion
creation. Only 3% of the ablation lesions were at < 5 g and 1% at > 40 g of force. As CF increased, the force time integral (FTI)
increased from 47 ± 24 to 376 ± 102 gs (p < 0.0005) and the lesion index (LSI) increased from 4.10 ± 0.51 to 7.63 ± 0.50 (p < 0.0005).
Both procedure time (101 ± 19.7 min) and total RF energy time (895 ± 258 s) were very short. For paroxysmal AF, the single
procedure freedom from AF was 86% at 1 and 2 years. For persistent AF, it was 83% at 1 year and 72% at 2 years. There were
no complications.
Conclusions Short duration 50 Wablations using CF sensing catheters are safe and result in excellent long-term freedom from AF
for both paroxysmal and persistent AF with short procedure times and small amounts of total RF energy delivery.

1 Introduction
Radiofrequency (RF) ablation is widely utilized to treat atrial
fibrillation (AF). The predominant goal for catheter ablation of
AF is durable pulmonary vein (PV) isolation. Virtually, all veins
appear isolated at the end of a procedure, but late recurrences can
occur and repeat studies often show PV reconnection. Lesion
formation for PV isolation and other ablations depend upon RF
current delivered, duration of RF energy delivery, and good
ablation catheter tissue contact. Increasing the power (and,
therefore, current) to 50 W for longer duration lesions results
in increased ablation efficacy but is associated with increased
complications [1]. Shorter duration 50 W lesions also provide
better long-term outcomes but without an increase in complica-
tions [2]. The availability of catheters which measure tissue con-
tact force (CF) provides a tool to potentially improve PV isola-
tion and long-term outcomes. Prior studies using CF have used
average power of 25–28 W for durations of 40 to 75 s at each
site for a total RF energy delivery time of 37.6 to 46.5 min [3–5].
Our study evaluates the feasibility of doing AF ablation using
very short duration ablations at a power of 50 W with CF sens-
ing catheter technology.

 by point by point RF ablation with the St. Jude (St. Paul, MN)
TactiCath® CF sensing catheter at Sequoia Hospital,
Redwood City, California. All patients signed written in-
formed consent. The study was approved by the Western
Institutional Review Board. The AF type was categorized as
paroxysmal: lasting < 1 week or persistent: lasting > 1 week
and < 1 year or requiring pharmacological or electrical cardio-
version in < 1 week. Patients with longstanding persistent AF
lasting >1 year were excluded.
2.2 Ablation protocol
Our ablation protocol [6] and our periprocedural
anticoagulation protocols [7] have been previously described.
Antiarrhythmic drugs were stopped at least five half-lives and
amiodarone at least 3 months before ablation. The St. Jude
EnSite™ Velocity™ system was used in all cases for 3D
mapping. All patients underwent circumferential PV isolation
and other ablations as clinically indicated. All ablations were
at 50 W, including the posterior wall, using the St. Jude
TactiCath™ open irrigated-tip CF sensing catheter and the
St. Jude Ampere™ RF generator with a target CF of 10–
40 g. CF readings of 5–10 g were accepted, provided visual
inspection of the CF waveform showed a stable pattern with-
out respiratory variation and was constantly above 0 g. If we
did not get adequate CF, the transseptal sheath was ex-
changed for a St. Jude Agilis™ steerable sheath. We used a
2s ramp time, a catheter irrigation rate of 30 ml/min, and a
50 °C temperature cutoff in the LA and 42° for the RA isth-
mus. Lower temperature cutoff was used in the RA isthmus to
avoid steam pops if the tip was buried in a trabeculation. For
patients in sinus rhythm, pacing was undertaken from the
distal bipole of the ablation catheter at 10 mA and 2 ms
duration during RF energy delivery at a rate approximately
20 bpm faster than sinus. We terminated RF energy delivery
several seconds after there was loss of capture, confirmed by
sudden return to the sinus rate and loss of atrial capture by the
pacing spikes. For patents in AF, we used a target LSI of 5.5–
6 at all locations. After the veins were encircled, patients in
AF were cardioverted. We evaluated entrance and exit block
using a St. Jude Spiral™ circular mapping catheter
documenting lack of vein potentials and failure of pacing
inside the vein to propagate to the atrium. The esophagus
was marked with a thermistor catheter. Our RF lesions were
so short that any temperature rise was seen after RF was
terminated. If there was a small temperature rise, we did not
resume ablation until the esophageal temperature fell back to
baseline. After vein isolation, other additional clinically indi-
cated ablations were performed. Isoproterenol was given to
look for non-PV triggers and arrhythmia induction performed
with bursts of rapid atrial pacing before and during isoproter-
enol. Non-PV triggers or induced atrial flutters or tachycar-
dias were mapped and ablated.
2.3 Data collection and analysis
For each patient, we recorded preablation age, gender, duration
of AF, AF type, prior antiarrhythmic drug therapy, CHADS2 and
CHA2DS2-VASC scores, cardioversions, body mass index
(BMI), LA size, prior strokes/transient ischemic attacks (TIAs),
and the presence of hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery dis-
ease (CAD), cardiomyopathy, and obstructive sleep apnea. For
each RF energy delivery, we recorded the duration of RF time in
seconds, the CF in grams sampled at 50 Hz and averaged over
the duration of each RF application, the force time integral (FTI)
in gram-seconds (gs), the LSI, and the percent impedance drop
during RF energy delivery. FTI is the average CF of each lesion
in grams multiplied by the duration of the lesion in seconds, and
the LSI was empirically derived in animals to reflect lesion size.
The LSI metric is calculated and displayed in real time. LSI is
derived using a complex proprietary mathematical formula that
takes into account a 6-s moving average of CF and current as
well as time. Procedure time was defined as time from groin stick
to sheath removal. A successful ablation procedure was defined
as no AF, flutter, or tachycardia lasting more than 30 s off of
antiarrhythmic drugs after a 3-month blanking period.
2.4 Follow-up
No patients received antiarrhythmic drugs during the blanking
period. Patients who went into persistent AF were cardioverted at
the end of the blanking period. Patients sent daily transtelephonic
ECG strips for 1–3 months after ablation and were seen at
3 months when a 7- to 14-day continuous ECG patch monitor
was done. Initial failures were encouraged to undergo a repeat
ablation after the blanking period; however, only the initial abla-
tion was used for outcome analysis. Patients were seen or
contacted frequently from 3 to 12 months and seen at 1 year
when they underwent another 7- to 14-day continuous ECG
patch monitor. Thereafter, patients were seen directly or
contacted by phone at least annually and arrhythmia records
obtained from hospitals and referring physicians. ECG recorders
were reissued for arrhythmia symptoms. Pacemaker AF data
were utilized when available.
2.5 Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was done using XLSTAT 2014. Continuous
data were described as mean ± standard deviation and counts
and percent if categorical. Analysis of variance was done for the
FTI, LSI duration of lesions, and average impedance drop dur-
ing RF energy delivery by ranges of CF. Kaplan-Meier curves
were generated for AF-free survival after the initial ablation for
patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF and for patients
grouped by the percent of the total number of ablation lesions
done with CF < 10 g. All statistical tests were two sided, and
p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

 3 Results
3.1 Patient population
The patient population is summarized in Table 1. There were
31 males and 20 females with an average age of 68.4 ±
9.3 years. Twenty-one patients had paroxysmal AF and 30
patients had persistent AF. Thirteen patients were in AF at
the time of ablation. The average duration of AF was 6.1 ±
7.0 years, and patients had failed an average of 0.92 ± 0.91
antiarrhythmic drugs.
3.2 RF energy delivery
A total of 3961 RF lesions were delivered in these 51 patients,
an average of 77.6 ± 19.1 per patient. All lesions were at 50 W.
Figure 1 shows the distribution of lesions by ranges of CF.
Only 3% of the lesions were below 5 g of force, and only 1%
were > 40 g of force. The largest group was 49% with an
average force between 10 and 20 g. The average duration of
RF delivery was 11.2 ± 3.7 s. Figure 2 shows the distribution
of average lesion duration by CF ranges. For lesions with < 5 g
of force, the average duration of RF delivery was 12.5 ± 4.9 s
and for CF from 5 to < 10 g, the average duration of each
lesion was 13.7 ± 4.4 s. Above 10 g, there was a gradual de-
cline in duration of RF energy delivery down to 8.6 ± 2.0 s for
average CF > 40 g (p < 0.0005). All PVs showed entrance and
exit block at the end of the procedure and failure of pacing
around the circumference of the vein to capture. In addition to
PV isolation, 15 patients underwent right atrial isthmus flutter
ablation for clinical or induced right atrial flutter, 37 patients
underwent left atrial roof line ablation, 1 underwent a low
posterior line ablation for posterior wall isolation, 3 left atrial
flutters were mapped and ablated, and complex fractionated
atrial electrograms were ablated in 1 patient. These ancillary
ablations were also done at 50 W for short duration, and their
RF data is included in the data for each patient. The average
procedure time for these patients was 101 ± 19.7 min (range
58 to 180). The total duration of RF energy delivered was 895
± 250 s (range 307 to 1893).
3.3 LSI and FTI
The average LSI for all lesions was 5.9 ± 0.88. Figure 3 (top
panel) shows the average LSI by CF ranges. As the CF in-
creased from < 5 to > 40 g, the LSI value increased from 4.10
± 0.51 to 7.63 ± 0.50 (p < 0.0005). Figure 3 (bottom panel)
shows the average FTI by CF ranges. As CF increased from
< 5 to > 40 g, the average FTI increased from 47 ± 24 to 376 ±
102 gs (p < 0.0005).
3.4 Loss of pacing capture and impedance drop
during RF energy delivery
To monitor surrogates for lesion formation, we monitored the
loss of pacing capture during RF delivery for those patients in
sinus rhythm and impedance drops for each RF energy deliv-
ery for all patients. Figure 4 shows a typical burn done in sinus
rhythm with loss of pacing capture during RF. The average

 impedance drop for all lesions was 13.5 ± 5.5%. As CF in-
creased, the average impedance drop per lesion decreased
from 14.5 ± 5.2% for the 5 to < 10 g force range to 9.6 +
5.2% for CF > 40 g (p < 0.0005) (Fig. 5). We did not have
an audible or tactile steam pop in any of the 3961 RF appli-
cations. No char was noted on any catheters. For all lesions
delivered in sinus rhythm, we paced during RF energy deliv-
ery. Except for an occasional lesion on the anterior portion of
the right upper PV, there was always loss of capture prior to
termination of RF energy delivery. For lesions on the anterior
right upper vein, where there was no loss of capture, we
stopped RF at an LSI of 6.0. Rechecking these areas after
terminating RF showed no electrograms and no capture after
repositioning the catheter. We felt that the proximal pole of the
catheter may have been touching tissue and causing anodal
stimulation or there may have been adjacent right atrial tissue
capture to explain continued atrial capture when the LSI
reached 6.0. Prior to terminating the procedure, we paced
along all lesion sets to further document failure to capture.
All veins were isolated in all patients, and there were no acute
reconnections noted.
3.5 Long-term outcomes
All patients considered free of AF underwent 3 and
12 month 7- to 14-day continuous monitors. The average
follow-up was 1.74 ± 0.61 years. Figure 6 shows the

during RF. This figure shows a
single lesion created near the top
of the left upper pulmonary vein.
While pacing the distal bipole of
the ablation catheter, RF is turned
on at 50 W. After 10 s of RF
(when the LSI was 4.9), there is
loss of capture. The RF was
continued for a total RF time of
13.4 s. The average CF was 11.0 g

 Kaplan-Meier single procedure AF-free rates by AF type
(paroxysmal vs. persistent). For paroxysmal AF, the single
procedure freedom from AF was 86% at 1 and 2 years.
For persistent AF, the single procedure AF-free rate was
83% at 1 year and 72% at 2 years. The difference in long-
term outcome between paroxysmal and persistent AF was
not significant (p = 0.331).
We also examined the single procedure AF-free rate for the
entire cohort by the percent of lesions in each patient with
average CF < 10 g. We compared patients who had < 20%
of their RF lesions at < 10 g to those with 20–30% of the
lesions at < 10 g and those with > 30% of the lesions at <
10 g. Figure 7 shows the Kaplan-Meier curves for these three
groups. There was no difference in single procedure AF-free
rates, suggesting that even the lesions created with < 10 g of
force using 50 W, the majority of which were between 5 and
10 g (averaging 8.0 g of force), were making durable lesions.
This may have been due to our requiring an optimal CF wave-
form for CF between 5 and 10 g.
Nine patients returned for a repeat ablation after their
initial ablation failed. All had at least one active vein.
There was more than one site of vein reconnection of
24.2% and a single site of reconnection in 27.3% of the
veins. Eight of the nine patients had atrial arrhythmias
eliminated by the redo ablation.
3.6 Complications
There were no instances of stroke or TIA, pericardial
tamponade, atrial-esophageal fistulae, PV stenosis, or death.
4 Discussion
The main finding of this study is that using CF sensing cath-
eters and 50 Wablations averaging only 11.2 s/burn, we safely
isolated the PVs in all patients with much shorter procedure
times and total RF energy delivery (< 15 min/patient) than
reported in prior studies using lower power and longer dura-
tion RF applications [3–5]. We had an excellent single proce-
dure 1 and 2-year freedom from AF.
In the present study, we did point by point ablation to ex-
amine the characteristics of each lesion regarding RF duration,
loss of pacing capture during RF delivery, impedance drop,
and measurement of LSI and FTI. The average duration of all
lesions was 11.2 ± 3.7 s. The RF generator we utilized takes
2 s to get up to full 50 W power when RF energy is applied to
the catheter. Several animal studies support the use of 50 W
ablation for 5–10 s. In an in vitro and in vivo sheep model,
Bhaskaran et al. [8] compared 50 and 60 W ablations for 5 s
with the conventional 40 W ablations for 30 s, all delivered at
a CF of 10 g. They delivered energy after the RF generator had
reached full power. Their 5-s ablation would be comparable to
a 7-s ablation in our study. They demonstrated that 50 and
60 W ablations for 5 s achieved transmural lesions and were
safer than the 40 W 30-s ablations. Steam pops occurred in 8%
of the lesions using 40 W for 30 s and in none of the 5-s 50 and
60 W ablations. When they evaluated 80 W for 5 s, there was
an 11% occurrence of steam pops, suggesting an upper limit
on safe power for short duration lesions. Another study by

 Goyal et al. [9] in fresh killed porcine ventricles showed that
for 20 g of CF, the time needed to create a 4-mm deep lesion
decreased from just over 20 s for 20 W to 6–7 s for 50 W. That
study suggested that these high power and short durations
might help to reduce collateral injury.
Several previous clinical studies evaluated 50 W ablations
using non-CF catheters. Kanj et al. [1] compared 35 vs. 50 W
ablations. They randomized 180 patients (85% with paroxys-
mal AF) to ablation using either an 8-mm non-irrigated cath-
eter or an open irrigated tip catheter (OITC) at either 35 or at
50 W. For the OITC, they showed a 6-month freedom from
AF of 82% at 50 W and only 66% at 35 W with shorter
fluoroscopy and left atrial times with 50 W. They did note
more steam pops, pericardial effusions, and gastrointestinal
complaints at 50 W, probably because they ablated at each site
for prolonged periods of time and did not shorten the RF
delivery time for the 50 W lesions. Bunch and Day [10] re-
ported on the use of 50 W and a “painting” technique where
they moved the catheter back and forth across a small area
until it was devoid of electrograms and reported no esophageal
injuries and an 85% freedom from AF after one or two abla-
tions with a mean follow-up of 338 days. In a previous study,
we reported a technique like that of Bunch and Day, termed
“perpetual motion,” using open irrigated tip catheters at 50 W
[2] for short durations at each site. Compared with lower pow-
er ablations for longer durations, the short 50 W ablations had
better long-term freedom from AF and shorter procedural, left
atrial and fluoroscopy times. There was no increase in com-
plications with the use of 50 W for short durations. The pres-
ent study extrapolates those observations about short duration
50 W ablations to the use of CF sensing catheters.
The appropriate range of CF and appropriate method for
real-time monitoring of CF ablations is still being determined.
In the TOCATTA study [4], using 15 to 40 W of power, there
was a higher 1-year success rate when the CF was maintained
above 20 g. That study also suggested the FTI should be >
500 gs and possibly > 1000 gs for best outcomes. The
EFFICAS I study [3], using a median of 25 W of power for
up to 60 s at each site, showed fewer PV reconnections when
the FTI was > 400 gs. The FTI has been commonly used as a
real-time surrogate for durable lesion formation. There are at
least four determinants of lesion formation at each site: CF, RF
energy duration, RF current, and catheter stability. The only
components the FTI considers are the CF and the RF lesion
duration. The FTI does not consider either current or power
level or catheter stability. Das et al. [11] recently reported on
the use of the “ablation index” which is similar to the FTI but
also includes power in a weighted formula. They found the
ablation index to be superior to FTI for acutely monitoring PV
isolation. In our study, we followed the LSI measurement
which also utilizes CF, RF duration, and RF current (which
reflects delivered power) in determining a real-time number to
guide ablations. We also visually incorporated the CF
waveform as a measure of catheter stability, especially for
ablations done at < 10 g of force. We monitored both imped-
ance drop at all sites and loss of capture for the patients in
sinus rhythm and always saw loss of capture and a fall in
impedance, indicating good lesion formation by the time the
LSI reached a value of 5.5–6.0. This would suggest that when
using 50 W ablations for patients in AF, where loss of pacing
capture cannot be monitored, one should deliver energy at all
sites long enough to achieve an LSI in the 5.5–6.0 range. For
patients in sinus rhythm, when ablating the anterior portion of
the right upper PV while pacing, one should stop the ablation
when the LSI reaches 6.0, even if there is still atrial capture, as
the capture may anodal form the proximal pacing electrode of
the ablation catheter. Since force quality is not incorporated
into the LSI measurement, for CFs between 5 and 10 g, one
should carefully monitor CF quality by continuous visual in-
spection of the CF waveform. If this waveform frequently
drops to 0 g or is labile, one should abort that lesion and start
anew with higher or more stable CF. When using 50 W abla-
tions, one cannot use the prior target FTI numbers reported in
the literature, as these were all derived using RF energy well
below 50 W. In our study using short duration 50 Wablations,
we did not achieve an average FTI of 400 gs, even for lesions
with a CF > 40 g. There was an eightfold range with wide
standard deviations (from 47 ± 24 to 376 ± 102 gs) for average
FTIs as CF went from < 5 to > 40 g and less than a twofold
range with smaller standard deviations (from 4.10 ± 0.51 to
7.63 ± 0.50) for average LSI over the same CF ranges. This
suggests that the LSI is a better number to monitor than the
FTI, as it takes RF current into consideration and is less var-
iable from lesion to lesion over a range of CFs.
Our study suggests that, when using CF sensing cathe-
ters at 50 W, if one wants to use drag lesions, perpetual
motion or painting techniques to keep the RF generator on
while moving the ablation catheter to a new site, one
should remain at each spot for approximately 8–9 s for
higher CF sites and for a few seconds longer at lower CF
sites, before moving on to the next spot.
Studies have indicated that a fall in impedance during RF
energy delivery [12] or loss of pace capture [13] indicates
lesion formation. Studies evaluating CF suggest that there is
a greater fall in impedance with more CF [14]. For unclear
reasons, we found a smaller decrease in impedance as CF
increased. This may be due to the fact that we used endpoints
of lesion formation (loss of pace capture and LSI) to guide the
termination of RF rather than measuring impedance drop at a
fixed time after the onset of RF delivery and that our ablation
times were very short.
In the TOCCASTAR study [5] for paroxysmal AF ablation,
there was no difference in the 1-year freedom from AF when
the CF sensing catheter was compared to the non-CF sensing
catheter. However, when the data were analyzed comparing
patients who received ≥ 90% of the ablation lesions with ≥
6
J Interv Card Electrophysiol (2018) 52:1–8
 10 g of force to those who had < 90% of their lesions at ≥ 10 g,
the group with a higher percentage of high CF lesions
achieved a 75.9% 1-year freedom from AF compared to
58.1% for the group where CF was less optimal. In our present
study, having a higher percentage of ablation sites at less than
10 g of force did not significantly impact the outcome. In
addition, for paroxysmal AF, our 1-year 86% freedom from
AF was considerably higher than the overall 67.8% seen in the
TOCCASTAR trial for paroxysmal AF. This could be due to
our requirement that for CF between 5 and 10 g, the CF wave-
form must be ideal and consistent with good contact or it could
be that 50 W ablations overcome the limitations of slightly
lower CF.
Radiofrequency energy delivery to tissue is a complex in-
teraction and is well summarized in a recent review [12].
There is a resistive component adjacent to the catheter elec-
trode which results in local heating and dissipation of radio-
frequency energy as heat. This resistive heating depends upon
current delivered to the tissue and the resistance seen by the
RF generator. Resistive heating probably occurs relatively ear-
ly in the RF application. Greater resistive heating can be
achieved by the use of higher RF power or lower resistance,
achieved by the use of larger tip catheters or extra skin elec-
trodes. There is also a secondary passive heating of deeper
tissue which increases with longer duration RF applications.
Tissue needs to be heated to 50 °C or higher for several sec-
onds to achieve irreversible coagulation necrosis which results
in an electrically silent scar. The use of catheter tip cooling and
greater energy both result in larger and deeper scar formation.
Open irrigated tip catheters, such as the one used in the present
study, results in tip temperature increases of only a few de-
grees Celsius which are associated with 20–30° of tissue tem-
perature increases [15]. Thus, with the open-irrigated tip cath-
eters, one can heat and ablate adjacent tissue at 50 Wof power
without having catheter tip coagulation in the blood pool. The
shorter, higher energy RF applications we used in the present
study may also result in fewer complications by achieving
rapid local resistive tissue ablation and avoiding deeper col-
lateral passive heating seen with longer and lower power RF
applications. Although the present study is too small to exam-
ine the rate of infrequent complications, over the past 12 years,
we have performed more than 4500 AF ablations using 50 W
for short durations, including the posterior wall, with only a
single non-fatal atrioesophageal fistula, a single patient with
PV stenosis requiring intervention, a pericardial tamponade
rate of 0.34%, and a 48-h stroke rate of 0.145%.
5 Limitations
This was a single center study. There were a relatively small
number of patients evaluated. However, there were almost
4000 ablation applications evaluated and almost five million
individual data points examined with 50 Hz sampling. Despite
the small number of patients, the excellent long-term single
procedure outcomes support the animal data referenced previ-
ously and provides “proof of concept” for using this technique
in future trials of AF ablation. Although we saw no complica-
tions, the number of patients is too small to evaluate for infre-
quent serious complications that can occur with AF ablation.
6 Conclusions
Monitoring the quality of the CF waveform, documenting loss
of capture during pacing during RF delivery for patients in
sinus rhythm, and following a parameter that takes current
or power into account provide a safe and rational method for
monitoring short duration RF ablations at 50 W using CF
measuring catheters. The use of short duration 50 W RF le-
sions permits shorter procedures with minimal total RF energy
delivery and excellent outcomes.
