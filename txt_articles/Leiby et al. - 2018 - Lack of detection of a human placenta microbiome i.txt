Abstract
Background: Historically, the human womb has been thought to be sterile in healthy pregnancies, but this idea
has been challenged by recent studies using DNA sequence-based methods, which have suggested that the womb
is colonized with bacteria. For example, analysis of DNA from placenta samples yielded small proportions of microbial
sequences which were proposed to represent normal bacterial colonization. However, an analysis by our group showed
no distinction between background negative controls and placenta samples. Also supporting the idea that the womb is
sterile is the observation that germ-free mammals can be generated by sterile delivery of neonates into a sterile isolator,
after which neonates remain germ-free, which would seem to provide strong data in support of sterility of the womb.
Results: To probe this further and to investigate possible placental colonization associated with spontaneous preterm
birth, we carried out another study comparing microbiota in placenta samples from 20 term and 20 spontaneous
preterm deliveries. Both 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing were used to
characterize placenta and control samples. We first quantified absolute amounts of bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences using
16S rRNA gene quantitative PCR (qPCR). As in our previous study, levels were found to be low in the placenta samples and
indistinguishable from negative controls. Analysis by DNA sequencing did not yield a placenta microbiome distinct from
negative controls, either using marker gene sequencing as in our previous work, or with shotgun metagenomic sequencing.
Several types of artifacts, including erroneous read classifications and barcode misattribution, needed to be identified and
removed from the data to clarify this point.
Conclusions: Our findings do not support the existence of a consistent placental microbiome, in either placenta from term
deliveries or spontaneous preterm births.

 Background
Infection of the placenta by pathogens is known to cause
adverse outcomes in pregnancy [1, 2]. Historically, the
contents within the gravid uterus of a healthy pregnancy
were believed to be sterile based on numerous attempts
to culture living microorganisms from placental tissue
and amniotic fluid [3–5]. In contrast, in recent years, it
has been proposed that microorganisms colonize the
placenta naturally based on deep DNA sequencing data,
so that a placenta microbiome is characteristic of health
[6–13]. In one study, lineages found in placenta samples
were proposed to most closely match lineages from oral
samples [6]. Imaging studies also reported possible iden-
tification of intracellular bacteria within the basal plate
of placentas and at the maternal-fetal interface [14].
Previously, we reported that we could not detect a
placenta microbiome over the background in negative
controls in samples from term deliveries [15]. In this
previous study, analysis of the absolute quantities of
bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies using qPCR showed no
difference between the amount of DNA extracted from
placental tissues versus background negative controls.
Sequencing 16S rRNA marker genes showed that bacter-
ial lineages present in placenta samples and negative
controls were indistinguishable, but differed from oral or
vaginal swab samples run in parallel, which showed spe-
cific lineages typical of each anatomical site. Several
groups have published on contaminants present in ex-
traction reagents and the complications this introduces
in studying samples with low microbial biomass [16–18],
such as samples of placenta tissue.
Another type of data argues strongly for sterility
within the amniotic sac in healthy pregnancies. For
many mammals, it is possible to create axenic (germ--
free) neonates by delivery using sterile cesarean section,
followed by introduction of the neonate into a sterile
isolator.
This
method
is
used
routinely
to
derive
germ-free mouse strains and has been used to derive
germ-free rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, cats, pigs,
lambs, calves, goats, baboons, chimpanzees, and marmo-
sets [19]. Even germ-free humans have been generated
by this method [19, 20]. This observation provides
strong evidence against the idea that contents of the
gravid uterus (placenta, amniotic cavity, and fetus) are
colonized with microbes.
Here,
we
sought
to
investigate
possible
placenta
colonization associated with spontaneous preterm birth.
We reasoned that even if the healthy placenta is not
normally colonized, perhaps placenta associated with
preterm delivery would harbor a detectable microbiome.
We thus obtained placenta tissue and control samples
from 20 term and 20 spontaneous preterm births
(Table 1). We first carried out 16S rRNA gene qPCR to
check absolute levels of bacterial DNA, but found that
both term and preterm samples had low copy numbers
indistinguishable from background levels in negative
controls. We then carried out both 16S rRNA gene
sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing, but
found no consistent microbial signature unique to
placenta in term or preterm births.
Results
Birth cohorts studied
To investigate possible colonization of the placenta asso-
ciated with preterm birth, we analyzed 20 placentas from
spontaneous preterm births and 20 from full-term deli-
veries (Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S1). Placenta
tissue samples were processed to remove the external
layers in an effort to exclude microbes adhering to the
outside of the placenta acquired during delivery. Mater-
nal side and fetal side samples were both collected. Six
cases of preterm birth were complicated by both clinical
chorioamnionitis (maternal fever > 100.4 and at least
one of the following: maternal tachycardia > 100 bpm,
fetal tachycardia > 160 bpm, or fundal tenderness) and
histological chorioamnionitis (white blood cells detected
in fetal membranes). As positive controls, we collected
saliva and cervicovaginal fluid from the mothers—both
body sites that are known to harbor rich microbial
communities [21–23]. We also collected several types of
negative controls (Additional file 1: Table S2). These
included (1) swabs that were opened in the sample
processing room and waved in the air (“Air Swab”),
(2) empty tubes that were processed through the
DNA extraction (“Blank”), and (3) PCR grade water
processed in parallel with the samples during amplifi-
cation and DNA sequencing acquisition, though not
DNA purification (“H2O”).

 DNA purification
In our previous work, we used two different DNA purifi-
cation kits to prepare samples, because purification kits
are known to be sources of contaminating bacterial
DNA [16, 17]. Previously, we used the MO BIO Power-
Soil and PSP kits and found that each kit yielded DNA
producing distinct bacterial sequences when amplifying
negative controls. DNA extracted from placenta samples
with the two kits not only resembled negative controls
but also matched the particular background of each
extraction kit, helping us distinguish the influence of re-
agent contamination. Thus, in this study, we also used
two DNA purification kits (Additional file 1: Table S3).
We used the DNeasy PowerSoil kit to match previous
work [6, 15], and also, in an attempt to suppress the in-
fluence of contamination, we compared a newly available
DNA purification kit designed to minimize adventitious
DNA, the QIAamp UCP Pathogen Mini kit (UltraClean).
As positive controls, we also purified samples expected
to contain robust microbial communities from maternal
saliva and vaginal swabs. Only one set of vaginal swabs
was available, so these were purified using the Ultra-
Clean kit.
Absolute abundance of bacterial DNA in samples
quantified using 16S rRNA gene-targeted qPCR
We investigated our sample set to determine whether
placenta DNA samples contained higher absolute levels
of bacterial DNA than negative controls as measured
using 16S rRNA gene qPCR (Fig. 1). Samples from saliva
and cervicovaginal fluid contained high concentrations
of bacterial DNA (low cycle of threshold), as expected
(Fig. 1, right two sample sets). Negative controls showed
high cycles of threshold, indicating low 16S rRNA gene
content (Fig. 1, leftmost three sample sets). Placenta
samples contained little 16S rRNA gene DNA, with
cycles of threshold similar to negative controls. (Fig. 1,
middle). Comparisons between the placenta samples and
Blank and H2O samples show that there was no signifi-
cant difference (Placenta (F)–Blank, p = 0.915; Placenta

significant differences between placenta samples and Air
Swabs (p = 0.001 for fetal side, p = 0.002 for maternal
side); however, the negative control Air Swabs yielded a
lower CT (higher amounts of bacteria; Additional file 1:
Table S4). We found no differences between sample sets
when comparing placenta samples separated by term,
chorioamnionitis, or extraction kit with the negative
controls (Additional file 1: Tables S5-S10).
We then compared placenta samples between term
and preterm births. Two comparisons achieved signifi-
cance, but the direction was inconsistent. For data from
the UltraClean kit, comparison of fetal side placenta
from preterm and term births showed a significantly
lower mean value CT for the preterm births (p < 10−5,
Kruskal-Wallis). However, for data from the PowerSoil

showed lower mean CT for the term births (p = 0.0396,
Kruskal-Wallis). We compared the chorioamnionitis pla-
centa samples to other preterm birth and pooled placenta
samples
and
found
no
significant
differences.
We
conclude that, unlike the saliva or vaginal samples, the
numbers of 16S rRNA gene copies in placental samples
were not significantly higher than in negative controls and
that there is little difference between preterm, term or
chorioamnionitis samples.
Analysis of bacterial DNA using 16S rRNA marker gene
sequencing
We next assessed the composition of the 16S rRNA gene
sequences in our samples using 16S rRNA marker gene
sequencing. For this, we analyzed the V1-V2 region of
the 16S rRNA gene, because previous work suggested
that the placental microbiome might be derived from
oral communities [6], and V1-V2 has been used to
characterize oral communities in multiple peer-reviewed
publications [24–29]. This region of the gene is also rela-
tively short (typically ~ 260 bp), which increases amplifi-
cation efficiency and so is useful for analyzing low
biomass samples [24, 26]. We amplified and sequenced
the sample set (Additional file 1: Table S3) and as an
additional positive control added a set of synthetic
DNAs encoding divergent microbial 16S rRNA gene se-
quences to verify robust performance of biochemical
steps and proper sample tracking [17]. We recovered
useable data (> 100 reads) for 303 of 388 samples (Add-
itional file 1: Table S11 and Additional file 2: Figure S1).
Of the placenta samples, 62/160 (38.75%) did not meet
this threshold. We speculate that clean work up of low
biomass samples resulted in suppression of background
DNA contamination, leading to fewer 16S rRNA sequen-
cing reads in some samples. The output 16S rRNA gene
sequences were clustered using Dada2, and clusters were
assigned taxonomically using the SILVA database.
The major lineages detected are summarized in Fig. 2a
and detailed further in Additional file 2: Figure S2.
Vaginal and oral samples showed well-known bacterial
lineages associated with these body sites; vaginal samples
contained high proportions of Ureaplasma, Sneathia,
and
Lactobacillus,
and
oral samples were
high in
Neisseria, Porphyromonas, Streptococcus, and Prevotella
[21–23]. Samples from placenta, and also the negative
controls, were high in environmental bacteria commonly
associated with contaminants, such as Ralstonia and
Pseudomonas[16]. Placenta and negative control samples
also contained reads matching to chloroplasts (Strepto-
phyta), possibly derived from pollen in dust. Other bac-
teria present in both placenta and negative control
samples
included
Prevotella
and
Enterobacteraceae,
which
may
be
either
human-associated
or
environmental. Several vaginal lineages were detected se-
lectively in some of the placenta samples, including
Ureaplasma, Sneathia, and Lactobacillus. Further ana-
lysis showed that these were found predominantly in the
samples from vaginal deliveries and not cesarean deli-
veries. To test this further, we asked whether vaginal
lineages found in placenta matched between mother-pla-
centa
pairs
more
closely
than
in
unmatched
mother-placenta pairs; placentas were found to share
lineages
with
their
corresponding
mother
more
frequently than with other mothers (p < 10−5 for com-
parison of Jaccard distances). In contrast, samples
from cesarean deliveries showed no such correspond-
ence (p = 0.24 for comparison of Jaccard distances),
supporting the idea that vaginal lineages in placentas
were derived from the mother during vaginal delivery.
Clustering
of
samples
using
unweighted
UniFrac
showed separation of the saliva and vaginal samples
from all other sample types, while negative controls and
placenta samples formed an overlapping large cluster
(Fig. 2b). Sample clustering was then assessed sta-
tistically
by
PERMANOVA
(all
p
values

file

S12),
comparing
weighted
UniFrac, unweighted UniFrac, and Jaccard distances.
Comparison of placenta samples from preterm and
term deliveries showed no significant difference. Com-
parison of vaginal delivery versus cesarean delivery also
showed no difference for the UniFrac analyses, but did
achieve significance for Jaccard distance. Distances were
significantly different between kits (p = 0.021 all samples,
fetal, maternal). Comparisons between preterm and term
deliveries, performed separately on samples of each kit,
showed no differences. Comparisons of vaginal delivery
versus cesarean delivery, performed separately on sam-
ples purified using each kit, also showed no difference,
suggesting that there are no strong distinctions based on
delivery type in the data.
Comparisons of sample type showed significant diffe-
rences between blanks versus saliva, vaginal, and air
swab samples. Significant differences were also found
when comparing samples of each kit. However, blanks
and placenta samples showed no difference between
sample type (Fig. 2c). Comparisons of blanks with
placenta samples performed on samples from each kit
separately also did not show significant differences.
Comparison of placenta samples associated with cho-
rioamnionitis showed no significant difference compared
to other placenta samples. An overview of the bacterial
lineages detected is in Additional file 2: Figure S3.
Recently, Leon et al. [30] published a study of 265 pregnan-
cies, assessing the possible placenta microbiome in term
and preterm samples using 16S rRNA amplicon sequen-
cing. They too found no consistent placenta microbiome
over background. They did however find representation of

 Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma in some preterm placentas.
In our data, we assessed possible colonization with these
organisms, requiring detection by 16S rRNA amplicon se-
quencing in at least 2/4 samples per placenta to call a
lineage as present. Analysis was carried out at the level of
operational taxonomic units, our most discriminating
measure (Additional file 2: Figure S4). We found Myco-
plasma in 2/20 preterm deliveries and none of the term
deliveries; we found Ureaplasma in 3/20 preterm deliveries
and 1/20 term deliveries. Thus, although there was no sta-
tistically significant difference between our preterm and
term samples, detections of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma
in the 16S rRNA amplicon data from preterm samples are
potentially consistent with results of Leon et al. However,
we note that 5/6 cases are in vaginally delivered placentas
and the organism could be detected in the vaginal sample

 from the same woman (Additional file 2: Figure S4). Thus,
contamination with vaginal microbes during delivery is also
a possible explanation for the origin of Ureaplasma and
Mycoplasma in the preterm placenta samples.
The exception was a unique Ureaplasma amplicon se-
quence variant detected in two placenta samples and not
in the corresponding vaginal swab from a preterm,
cesarean section, and chorioamnionitis-associated birth
(subject 265). Ureaplasma has been associated with
chorioamnionitis, and thus in this case may represent
detection of an authentic infection in subject 265 [31],
paralleling results of Leon et al. [30].
We conjecture that kit contamination was a less sig-
nificant factor here than in Lauder et al. [15] and that
sequences from other sources, such as laboratory water
(e.g., Ralstonia) and maternal vagina were the major
source of contamination in this study. Thus, our analysis
of 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing did not disclose
any consistent distinction between placenta samples and
negative controls.
Analysis of total DNA content using shotgun
metagenomic sequencing
Previous studies have used shotgun metagenomic se-
quencing to analyze the placenta microbiome [6], so we
decided to also compare shotgun sequencing for this
sample set. A major disadvantage of using shotgun
metagenomics to interrogate human tissue is that the
vast majority of sequencing effort will be spent on se-
quencing human DNA. We thus focused on sequencing
a subset of our samples, so as to obtain more sequencing
depth. We chose to sequence only the samples extracted
with the UltraClean kit because that set included the
vaginal swabs.
Deep sequencing produced a large number of reads
for each sample type: 1.4 billion reads for placenta, 31
million for negative controls, 190 million for saliva, and
72 million for vaginal samples (Fig. 3). Filtering out se-
quences matching the human genome removed large
proportions of reads: 99.8% of the placenta samples,
19.3% of the negative controls, 76.0% of the saliva, and

 97.8% from the vaginal swabs. The large proportion of
human sequences removed from the placenta samples
left only an average of 35,600 total reads per sample to
interrogate for microbial composition.
Reads were then filtered a second time using Komple-
xity to mask low-complexity reads likely derived from host
repetitive DNA elements such as microsatellites that
eluded the first filter [32]. Next, the reads were assigned
taxonomically using Kraken [33]. The reads were filtered a
final time to remove those classified as Chordata and
Arthropoda, which were likely human sequences that
eluded earlier filtering steps, and Apicomplexa, unlikely
placental colonists, because database genomes of this
group are known to be problematic [34]. Finally, Kraken
assignments with three or fewer classified reads (summed
over the full sample set) were removed.
Major lineages detected for each sample are shown in
Fig. 4 and detailed further in Additional file 2: Figure S5;
placenta samples only are summarized in Additional file 2:
Figure S6. Saliva samples showed the expected oral bacte-
rial lineages, including Streptococcus and Prevotella.
Vaginal lineages were dominated by Lactobacillus and
Gardnerella. Placenta samples and the negative controls
contained high proportions of Ralstonia, a bacteria known
to be a frequent reagent contaminant [16], which was also
detected in the 16S rRNA marker gene sequence data.
Thus, the major placenta bacterial lineage in the shotgun
sequencing data could be attributed to contamination.
The next two most abundant lineages in placenta,
Alteromonas mediterranea and Methanosarcina mazei,
were less abundant in controls, but both appear to be
artefactual detections. Analysis of reads aligning to
Alteromonas mediterranea showed that the 5050 classi-
fied reads aligned to only 0.221% of the 4.6 million base
pair genome, and some of these reads aligned to human
DNA as well as the bacterial genome. Methanosarcina
mazei also showed sparse coverage of the genome, with
1159 reads aligning to only 0.0098% of the 4.1 million
base pair genome, and the sequences that mapped were
of
low
complexity
(Additional
file
1:
Table
S13).
Low-complexity sequences are known to be problematic
in quality control and classification steps, and in some
cases, these low-complexity samples aligned to human
DNA as well as the bacterial genomes, likely explaining
their presence.
A few placenta samples were also higher in Vibrio bac-
teria than were negative controls. We used DNA from
Vibrio campbellii, a marine bacteria, as a positive control
during sequence acquisition. Reads matching Vibrio
campbellii formed over 2% of nonhuman placental reads
and up to 31% of a single sample. We thus infer that
barcode misreading during sequence acquisition [17]
accounted for the detection of this organism.
We next asked whether any distinctions could be
found among the different types of placenta samples.
When we extracted lineages unique to placenta after ex-
cluding those found in negative controls (Additional file 1:
Table S14), we recovered very few reads. The most
abundantly represented taxon, Acidiplasma cupricumu-
lans, was identified with only 12 reads in 11 samples
total. Acidiplasma cupricumulans is an acidophile from
the phylum Archaea and not a likely candidate for a pla-
cental colonist. Other organisms showed even lower
read numbers, leaving us doubtful that any represented
authentic placental colonists.
After filtering out probable artifacts and barcode misat-
tributions (Alteromonas mediterranea, Methanosarcina
mazei, and Vibrio campbellii), comparison of preterm and
term deliveries showed a significant difference (p = 0.002,
PERMANOVA, Jaccard distance). However, none of the

 taxa identified show more than 24 reads aligning to the
target genome. (Additional file 1: Tables S15 and S16).
The most abundant organism identified, Kytococcus
sedentarius, was identified largely in a single preterm, fetal
side placenta sample (20 out of 24 classified reads) that
was from a pregnancy with preterm premature rupture of
membranes (PPROM) and chorioamnionitis. Kytococcus
sedentarius was discovered as a marine bacteria and is
suggested to also be an opportunistic human pathogen
[35]. Reads classified as Kytococcus sedentarius were also
found in other samples including Saliva, Blanks, and H2O
at similar or higher levels, suggesting this bacteria could
be derived from reagent contamination. We thus find that
all differential detections are of extremely low abundance
and are sample specific. Comparison of vaginal deliveries
and cesarean deliveries showed no distinction (p = 0.204,
PERMANOVA, Jaccard distance). Comparison of fetal
versus maternal side placenta samples showed no signifi-
cant
distinction
(p = 0.169,
PERMANOVA,
Jaccard
distance). Comparison of placenta samples from cases of
chorioamnionitis to other placenta samples also showed
no differences (Additional file 2: Figure S6). Thus, we con-
clude that analysis by shotgun metagenomic sequencing
also did not disclose a detectable placenta microbiome,
and consistent with the lack of signal, we did not see
convincing biological distinctions in the data.
Discussion
The existence of a placenta microbiome in healthy
mothers remains controversial. Previously, we reported
that we could not distinguish the putative microbiome in
term placenta samples from the contamination back-
ground in negative controls [15]. Here, we repeated the
study but compared samples from term and spontaneous
preterm births, and also compared results obtained by 16S
rRNA marker gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomic
sequencing. Using 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing, we
found that placenta samples were generally similar to
background, although we did find low-level representation
of vaginal lineages selectively in placentas from vaginal de-
liveries, suggestive of contamination of placenta samples
with vaginal fluids. With shotgun metagenomic sequen-
cing, the great majority of the sequences were human or
contaminants shared with negative controls. Of the small
number
of
nonhuman
reads
that
differed
between
placenta and controls, most were low-complexity DNA
sequences likely derived from human repeated sequences.
We were unable to distinguish the placenta microbiome
from background in either term and preterm births,
though reaching this conclusion required filtering several
forms of artifacts associated with low-biomass samples
containing high amounts of human DNA. These data do
not support the hypothesis that the placenta is normally
colonized by a consistent bacterial community.
We were unable to detect any distinctive bacterial sig-
nature in placentas from cases of chorioamnionitis,
which involves inflammation of the fetal membranes as-
sociated with bacterial infection. In a minority of cases,
Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma could be detected in the
16S rRNA gene sequence data from preterm samples.
However, these organisms were also usually detectable
in vaginal swab samples from the same women, leaving
it unclear whether these sequences originated from the
placenta specimen or vaginal contamination during de-
livery. In favor of the contamination argument, Lactoba-
cillus amplicon sequence variants characteristic of those
inhabiting the vagina were similarly abundant in many
samples from vaginal deliveries. However, it is possible
that Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma are genuinely present
in vagina and placenta in some of the pre-term birth
samples. We did find one case where Ureaplasma was
detected in a preterm birth sample associated with
chorioamnionitis but not in vagina, possibly representing
authentic detection of a pathogen in placenta. Thus, we
feel our data may be consistent with 16S rRNA amplicon
sequence results of Leon et al. [30], suggesting asso-
ciation of Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma in placenta from
some preterm birth samples.
With this study and two previous failures to detect a nor-
mal placenta microbiome in samples from healthy term de-
liveries
[15,
30],
we
question
whether
any
bacterial
community normally exists in this tissue and suggest that it
is usually sterile until rupture of membranes during delivery.
Thus, our studies on placenta are more broadly consistent
with the sterile womb hypothesis. Infection may be detect-
able in a minority of placenta samples from pre-term birth,
though
here
too
possible
contamination
of
placenta
specimens with vaginal lineages provides an alternative
explanation for most cases. Our data is congruent with the
observation that axenic (germ free) mammals can be gene-
rated routinely [19, 20]—in numerous studies, mammalian
neonates have been delivered by sterile cesarean section into
sterile isolators, after which they remain sterile. It is hard to
sustain the idea that the womb is normally colonized by
microbes given this observation. Furthermore, two recent
studies using deep DNA sequencing methods could not de-
tect bacteria in the amniotic fluid of women with healthy
pregnancies [36, 37]. In our view, available data is incon-
sistent with the colonized womb hypothesis and more con-
sistent with the sterile womb hypothesis.
Conclusions
We assayed samples from preterm and term deliveries
using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metage-
nomics. The expected microbial communities
were
found in oral and vaginal samples, but placenta samples
could not be distinguished from the contamination
background.

 Methods
Human subjects
Subjects in this study were selected from a large
case-control study (Cellular Injury and Preterm Birth,
CRIB) funded by the March of Dimes Prematurity
Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania. All
enrollment details and sample collection methods can
be found in [15] with the following addition. This study
used samples from 20 subjects in the control group as
well as 20 subjects identified as “cases.” The control
group consisted of uncomplicated singleton pregnancies
delivered at term following spontaneous labor (regular
contractions, cervical dilation) or spontaneous rupture
of membranes. Cases were defined as adult women with
singleton pregnancies who delivered between 23–0/7
and 34–6/7 weeks gestational age following idiopathic
preterm
labor
(regular
contractions
and
cervical
dilation), preterm
premature
rupture
of
membranes
(PPROM), or cervical insufficiency (painless cervical dila-
tion). The CRIB study has been approved by the Institu-
tional Review Board at the University of Pennsylvania
(protocol #821376).
DNA purification
Two DNA extractions kits were used for this study, DNeasy
PowerSoil (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and QIAamp UCP
Pathogen Mini (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany).
PowerSoil kit: DNA was extracted from replicate
maternal-side and fetal-side placental biopsies, mother’s
saliva, air swabs, and reagent blanks. Whole placenta biop-
sies were placed directly into tared bead tubes, and ranged
from 0.03 to 0.68 g. Between 33 and 100 μl of saliva was
transferred into the tubes. Swabs were cut directly into
the bead tubes. Samples were extracted as previously
described [15]. Extracted DNA was stored at -20 °C.
UltraClean kit: DNA was extracted from replicate
maternal-side and fetal-side placental biopsies, mother’s
saliva, vaginal swabs, air swabs, and reagent blanks. For
the vaginal swabs, air swabs, and saliva, samples were
extracted as per the manufacturer’s protocol with the
Mechanical Pre-lysis steps, using Pathogen Lysis Tubes
S (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Swabs were cut directly
into microcentrifuge tubes. Between 30 and 100 μl of
saliva was used for the extractions.
The optimum mass of a tissue sample for this extrac-
tion method is 0.25 g. In order to minimize the chance
of contamination of the placenta tissues, whole samples
were directly transferred into tared lysis tubes, and the
mass was recorded. The tissue samples weighed between
0.06 and 0.45 g. Five hundred microliters of reagent ATL
was added, and the samples were placed in a TissueLyser
II (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) for 10 min. Forty micro-
liters of proteinase K was added to each sample, and
then they were incubated overnight at 56 °C. The
samples were then placed in the TissueLyser again for
10 min. If the initial mass of the sample was greater than
0.25 g, a proportion of the supernatant, normalized to
0.25 g, was removed and diluted to 440 μl, and then
extracted per manufacturer’s protocol. Extracted DNA
was stored at − 20 °C.
16S rRNA gene quantitative PCR
Bacterial abundance was quantified using qPCR of the
V1-V2
region
of
the
16S
rRNA
gene
using
a
TaqMan-based assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). Samples were run in triplicate. Primer and probe
sequences are described in [38, 39] and are presented in
Additional file 1: Table S17. Reactions were analyzed on
a QuantStudio 5 Realtime PCR System (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA).
16S rRNA marker gene amplification and sequencing
The V1-V2 regions of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified
in each sample using Golay-barcoded primers 27F and
338R [40, 41]. Samples were amplified in quadruplicate,
then pooled and bead purified using Agencourt AMPure
XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Amplified pro-
ducts were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform
(Illumina, San Diego, CA).
Analytical methods used for 16S rRNA marker gene data
Sequence data was processed using DADA2 [42]. Reads
were trimmed from 251 bases to 240. Dereplication,
error modeling, denoising, pair merging, and chimera
removal were performed using default parameters.
Taxonomic assignments were generated by comparison
to the Silva reference database [43–45]. Samples with
fewer than 100 reads were excluded from downstream
analysis. Beta diversity analysis (unweighted UniFrac
and weighted UniFrac) was performed using the beta_-
diversity.py
script
from
Qiime
1.9.1
[46].
Jaccard,
PCoA, and PERMANOVA analysis were performed
using functions vegdist, pcoa, and adonis from the R
package “vegan” [47].
Shotgun metagenomic sequencing
Samples were prepared for metagenomic sequencing with
the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit and sequenced on
the Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with
dual-indexed barcodes and 2 × 125 base read lengths.
Analytical methods used for shotgun sequence data
The shotgun metagenomic sequence reads were proc-
essed using the Sunbeam pipeline [32]. Reads were
quality controlled with Trimmomatic [48], to remove
low-quality bases and adapter sequences. Host reads
were then identified using BWA [49] and removed.
The remaining reads were taxonomically classified

 using Kraken [33] with a custom database built on all
bacterial,
fungal,
archaeal,
and
viral
genomes
in
RefSeq release 79 [50]. To further filter our data of
problematic, low-complexity reads, we used Komplex-
ity to remove low-complexity reads that remained
after host decontamination [32]. As a final filtering
step, we excluded reads that were classified by Kraken
as Chordata, Arthropoda, and Apicomplexa. Sequen-
cing reads were aligned to target genomes using
BWA-MEM [49], and genome coverage was calcu-
lated using BEDtools [51].
