(2016) A cross-sectional study of ‘care left undone’ on nursing shifts in hospitals.

Abstract
Aims. To determine factors associated with variation in ‘care left undone’ (also
referred to as ‘missed care’) by Registered Nurses (RNs) in acute hospital wards in
Sweden.
Background. ‘Care left undone’ has been examined as a factor mediating the
relationship between nurse staffing and patient outcomes. The context has not
previously been explored to determine what other factors are associated with
variation in ‘care left undone’ by RNs.
Design. Cross-sectional survey to explore the association of RN staffing and
contextual factors such as time of shift, nursing role and patient acuity/dependency
on ‘care left undone’ was examined using multi-level logistic regression.
Methods. A survey of 10,174 RNs working on general medical and surgical
wards in 79 acute care hospitals in Sweden (January–March 2010).
Results. Seventy-four per cent of nurses reported some care was left undone on
their last shift. The time of shift, patient mix, nurses’ role, practice environment
and staffing have a significant relationship with care left undone. The odds of
care being left undone is halved on shifts where RN care for six patients or fewer
compared with shifts where they care for 10 or more.
Conclusion. The previously observed relationship between RN staffing and care
left undone is confirmed. Reports of care left undone are influenced by RN roles.
Support worker staffing has little effect. Research is needed to identify how these
factors relate to one another and whether care left undone is a predictor of
adverse patient outcomes.

 Introduction
Research in both the USA (Kalisch et al. 2011) and Europe
(Ausserhofer
et al.
2014)
has
identified
a
relationship
between nurse staffing levels and care left undone, suggest-
ing that it may be mediating factor between Registered
Nurse (RN) staffing and outcomes. In one study, missed
care explained over 40% of the variation in care quality
ratings (Sochalski 2004) and in New Zealand, care left
undone is used as an indicator of staffing adequacy in hos-
pitals (Carville 2014). However, little attention has been
paid to other factors that may be associated with care left
undone, the degree of variation in these factors and poten-
tial effect on staffing levels and care left undone.
Background
Based on their systematic review, Kane and colleagues con-
cluded that higher RN staffing levels are associated with
lower rates of hospital-related mortality and lower rates of
adverse patient events (Kane et al. 2007). In a study that
involved a retrospective review of 176,000 shifts, Needle-
man and colleagues reported that mortality rates were sig-
nificantly greater for patients on shifts where RN staffing
was 8 hours or more below the planned level (Needleman
et al. 2011). More recently, a review undertaken for the
National Institute of Health & Care Excellence (NICE)
reported that there was evidence from several large, good-
quality studies that lower nurse staffing levels are associated
with increased rates of death and falls, shorter lengths of
stay and lower readmission rates (Griffiths et al. 2014).
Nurse staffing levels are not only recognized as predictors
of care quality and the avoidance of patient harm but have
also been consistently linked to nurse job satisfaction (She-
ward et al. 2005) and propensity to leave their jobs or the
nursing
profession
(Heinen
et al.
2013).
Differentials
between the staffing levels of hospitals or in different geo-
graphical areas can thus become drivers for workforce
mobility. In Sweden, recruitment agencies report that nurses
have been attracted to work in hospitals in Norway partly
due to the perception of better staffing levels and an oppor-
tunity to provide more complete care and work in a calmer
environment (News in English, 2014).
Recent
research
from
a
large
international
study,
RN4Cast, suggests that optimal levels of staffing are not
being consistently achieved across Europe. Nurse staffing
levels varied considerably both within and between coun-
tries; each additional patient per RN was associated with a
7% increase in the likelihood of a surgical patient dying
within 30 days of admission (Aiken et al. 2014). In another
report from RN4Cast, RNs in Sweden who perceived that
there was sufficient staffing and resources were two and a
half times more likely to assess patient safety of their ward/
unit positively (Alenius et al. 2013).
Ausserhofer and colleagues used survey data from 33,659
nurses participating in the RN4Cast study to examine care
left undone and associations with organizational factors in
12 European countries (Ausserhofer et al. 2014). Nurses in
hospitals with more favourable work environments and bet-
ter patient to RN ratios were significantly less likely to
report leaving any necessary nursing care undone. However,
they note a limitation: the possible differences related to
country were controlled for in the statistical model, but the
effects of different country contexts were not fully explored.
Considerable
within-country
variability
was
observed,
which the authors suggest would merit further analysis. A
more detailed examination of the local context and how
this might influence the relationships between care left
undone and staffing is therefore warranted.
Why is this research or review needed?
� Care left undone by nurses has previously been found to
contribute to poor care quality, increased risk and worse
outcomes for patients.
� The context has not previously been explored to determine
whether differences in factors such as Registered Nurse
(RN) involvement in care provision, role and time of shift
may also be associated with variation in ‘care left undone’
by RNs.
What are the key findings?
� The time of shift, patient mix, nurses’ role and practice envi-
ronment all have a significant relationship with care being left
undone and the volume of activities not completed.
� Taking
the
observed contextual
factors into
account,
Registered Nurse (RN) staffing remains a significant pre-
dictor of care being left undone.
� Support worker staffing levels have little effect in mitigat-
ing care left undone by RNs.
How should the findings be used to influence policy/
practice/research/education?
� Workload tools and methods to plan nurse staffing need to
take account of many different factors – role of staff, fre-
quency of monitoring, dependency of patients, time of day/
night – to ensure the level of nurse staffing provided is suf-
ficient to meet patient needs at all times of the day or
night, without care being left undone.

 Analysis of the English data from the RN4Cast study used
a multi-level model to examine the relationship between care
left undone and RN staffing, taking account of differences in
hospital, specialty, patient dependency, time of shift, support
worker staffing levels and the practice environment (Ball
et al. 2014). On a day shift, the mean number of patients
cared for was 7�8 per RN and at night, 10�9. Eighty-six per
cent of nurses in England reported that at least one care activ-
ity had been left undone due to lack of time on their last shift.
RN staffing levels were significantly associated with the inci-
dence of care being left undone; 78% of those on the best
staffed shifts (6�1 patients or fewer per RN) reported incom-
plete care compared with 89% on the worst staffed shifts
(11�7 or more patients per RN). The study also reported a
strong association between the amount of care left undone
and quality of care. Variation in the level of nursing support
staff was not related to variation in missed care, suggesting
that support staff were neither substituting for nor comple-
menting the work of RNs in relation to the areas of care
assessed in the survey. Given the global interest in staffing
levels, care quality and skill-mix, replicating these analyses in
other countries is a priority.
Previous research on ‘missed care’ and adverse events has
identified a range of factors that are associated with increased
likelihood of incomplete care or negative patient outcomes:
RN staffing levels, skill-mix and the practice environment
(Kalisch et al. 2011, Ball et al. 2014, Ausserhofer et al.
2014). Using data from the same project but a different coun-
try allows us to explore the influence of these and other con-
textual variables in greater detail. In this study, we also
posited that the time of shift, level of patient dependency, the
degree of involvement of RNs in direct care provision and
level of support provided by other members of the nursing
team may also affect whether care needed by patients is car-
ried out and the level of staffing required to do so.
The study
Aims
The aim of the study was to examine factors associated
with RN reports of ‘care left undone’ on acute medical/sur-
gical
wards
in
Sweden
and
describe
the
relationship
between staffing levels and ‘care left undone’. Specifically
the following questions are addressed:
1 What is the type and prevalence of ‘care left undone’
reported by RNs?
2 What factors are associated with the incidence and preva-
lence of incomplete care?
3 How do RN and nursing support worker (nursing assis-
tants and aides) staffing levels relate to care left undone?
Design
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Sweden as part
of the Registered Nurse Forecasting (RN4Cast) study and
provides the basis for the analyses presented here. The
methodology of the RN4Cast survey followed a protocol
established by the international RN4Cast consortium of 15
countries (Sermeus et al. 2011).
Sample/participants
All RN members working on general medical or surgical
wards in all 79 acute hospitals in Sweden were identified
via the Swedish Association of Health Care Professionals.
The Association covers over 70% of all nurses, so all wards
and hospitals were potentially sampled.
Data collection
Between January - March 2010, the survey was sent out
by ‘Statistics Sweden’ and respondents were given the
option of answering either a web survey or a postal sur-
vey (N = 33,083). After three reminders, the response rate
was
70%
(n = 23,087).
Of
these,
10,174
respondents
were identified as working on inpatient adult medical or
surgical
care
wards
and
thus
match
the
inclusion
criteria used for the RN4Cast study and are used in this
analysis.
Ethical considerations
All nurses were surveyed voluntarily and anonymously. Eth-
ical approval was received for the Swedish component of
the RN4Cast project from the regional Ethical Review
Board in Stockholm (Dnr 2009/1587-31/5).
Measures
Nurse staffing
Respondents were asked about the last shift they worked
and to give the number of staff providing direct patient care
and the number of patients on the ward. Nurse staffing
comprises RNs and unregistered nurse support workers,
who in Sweden are Enrolled Nurses (3 years of training)
and auxiliary nurses (1 year of training).
From these responses, we identified the:
• Number of patients per RN providing direct care.

JAN: ORIGINAL RESEARCH: EMPIRICAL RESEARCH – QUANTITATIVE
Care left undone in Sweden
 • Number
of
patients
per
nursing
support
worker
(non-registered nursing assistants, auxiliaries or aides)
providing direct care.
• Total nurse staffing (RN plus all support worker
staffing).
Patient dependency and acuity
To estimate patient dependency, nurses were asked to report
the number of patients that they were directly responsible for
requiring assistance with all activities of daily living (ADL)
on their last shift. This was divided by the total number of
patients they reported they had responsibility for, to produce
an indication of the patient dependency.
Similarly, to estimate patient acuity, nurses were asked to
report the number of patients who required monitoring at
least hourly. This was divided by the total number of
patients they reported they had responsibility for, to pro-
duce a percentage.
Practice environment
We measured the nurse work environment using a validated
measure: the practice environment scale of the nursing work
index (PES-NWI) (Lake 2002). The PES-NWI measures nurse
participation in hospital affairs, managerial support for nurs-
ing, promotion of care quality and views of the relationships
between nurses and doctors. Respondents rated each item on
a four-point scale (strongly disagree, disagree, agree and
strongly agree). Four of the items in the Practice Environment
Scale related specifically to nurse staffing and resourcing.
These were excluded to avoid overlap (i.e. common variance)
with the other measures of nurse staffing used in the analysis
and the resultant 28-item scale was used (‘PES_28’). The
mean score (from 1 to 4, where 1 is low) provides an overall
rating of the practice environment.
Role in care provision
Nurses were asked to describe their role in providing care
on the last shift they worked, to indicate if they: ‘provided
most care themselves’, ‘supervised care provided by others
and provide some themselves’, or ‘provide only limited care
with most direct care being carried out by others’.
Transferrable activity
A measure of the variation in RNs’ activity – in terms of
activities that could be argued as being transferable – was
ascertained by presenting respondents with a list of nine
activities that could be undertaken by others (such as
obtaining supplies, delivering food trays, covering for other
services out of hours) and asking them to indicate how fre-
quently they undertook each: ‘never’, ‘sometimes’ and
‘often’ (Box 1). It includes the item ‘performing non-nur-
sing care’ (which was translated as ‘Utf€
orde arbetsuppgifter
som borde g€
oras av andra yrkesgrupper’ in Swedish). The
categories were combined to create a binary variable:
‘often’ vs. ‘sometimes or never’.
Care left undone
Missed care on the last shift was assessed by asking nurses
to identify which of a list of 13 activities, informed by
Box 1: Other activities undertaken and activities left undone
Transferrable activity undertaken by RNs
Activities left undone (Schubert et al. 2008)
• Delivering and retrieving food trays
• Performing activities that should be done by other staff groups
• Arranging discharge referrals and transportation
• Routine phlebotomy/blood draw for tests
• Transporting of patients within hospital
• Cleaning patient rooms and equipment
• Filling in for non-nursing services not available on off-hours
• Obtaining supplies or equipment
• Answering phones, clerical duties
• Adequate patient surveillance
• Adequate documentation of nursing care
• Administering medication on time
• Comfort/talk with patients
• Develop or update nursing care plans/care
pathways
• Educating patients and/or family
• Frequent changing of patient’s position
• Oral hygiene
• Pain management
• Planning care
• Preparing patients and families for discharge
• Skin care
• Undertaking treatments/procedures

 work by Schubert et al. (2008) on care rationing, that were
considered to be ‘Necessary but left undone because you
lacked time to complete them?’ (Box 1).
Validity and reliability
The questionnaire survey (and measures in it) is described
in more detail elsewhere (Sermeus et al. 2011) and has
been used extensively in previous studies of nurse staffing
and patient safety. The practice environment scale of the
nursing work index (revised) (PES-NWI) used to measure
the nurse work environment has been internationally vali-
dated (Lake 2002) and has been used previously in Eur-
ope (Rafferty et al. 2007). The activities in the measure
of ‘care left undone’ are derived from BERNCA, an
instrument that has validated associations between missed
care, patient’s experience of care and patient-related out-
comes (Schubert et al. 2008). It was translated into Swed-
ish, achieving a content validity index of 0�91 (Squires
et al. 2013).
Data analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 20
(Guildford, Surrey, UK). Descriptive statistics were used to
explore the data and identify the distribution of responses,
create a profile of respondents and identify any data
anomalies
such
as
extreme
outliers
or
out
of
range
responses. The staffing variables were grouped into eight
bands (<4 patients per nurse, 4�0-4�99, 5�0-5�99 and so on
up to ≥10 patients per nurse).
The relationship between ‘missed care’, staffing levels and
other factors was explored through two multi-level regres-
sion models: a mixed model Poisson regression (where the
dependent variable was the number of items of missed care)
and a mixed model logistic regression (no missed care vs.
one or more aspects of missed care). To analyse the hierar-
chical cross-sectional design with RNs in hospitals, a two-
level model was fitted to the data. Hospital ID and modi-
fied practice environment score (PES-28) were treated as
first (hospital)-level variables. All other variables – shift,
patients per RN, patients per nursing support worker,
patients requiring assistance with daily living (number of
patients),
patients
requiring
frequent
monitoring,
RN
involvement in care and transferrable activity levels – were
treated as second-level variables (individual nurse/shift).
These independent variables were regressed onto a global
nominal dependent variable. The percentage of missing data
was low, and therefore, complete cases analyses were per-
formed.
Results

characteristics
are
presented
in
Table 1. They are predominantly women (93%), average
40 years of age and the vast majority trained in Sweden
(98%). More than half (59%) have a bachelor’s degree in
nursing.
Prevalence and type of care left undone
Seventy-five per cent reported that at least one of the 13
care activities listed had not been done on their last shift
due to lack of time. The mean number of items of care left
undone across all shifts is 2�9. More care was left undone
on day and afternoon shifts than night shifts (Table 2).
The most commonly reported activities that were left
undone were comfort/talking with patients (46%), develop-
ing or updating nursed care plans/care (34%) and oral
hygiene (31%). Pain management (6%) and treatment and
procedures (6%) were least likely to be reported as missed.
All activities were less likely to have been considered ‘neces-

Care left undone in Sweden
 sary but undone’ on night shifts (Table 2). On day shifts,
those reporting some care had been left undone were on
shifts with an average of 6�2 patients per RN, compared
with 4�76 patients per RN on shifts where no care was
reported as undone.
Staffing and other factors
Many of the factors that we hypothesized may relate to the
incidence and prevalence of care left undone also vary by
shift (Table 3). Both RN and total staffing levels (i.e.
including support staff) varied considerably by time of shift:
early/day shifts averaging 5�5 patients per RN, afternoon
shifts 7�0 patients per RN and night shifts 11�4 patients per
RN.
Fifty-five per cent of RNs reported that they supervise
care provided and provide some care themselves, whereas
27% provide most care themselves. At night, more nurses
reported providing most care themselves (52% vs. 19% in
the day).

J.E. Ball et al.
 Many of the factors examined appear to be interrelated.
For example, RNs providing ‘most care’ themselves are
working on shifts with 4�9 patients per RN in the day,
while those providing ‘some care’ are on shifts with an
average of 6�1 patients per RN and those reporting only
‘limited’ direct involvement, 6�5 patient per RN. However,
no difference is observed between overall staffing level (i.e.
patients per member of nursing staff including support
workers/assistant nursing staff) and the reported level of
RN involvement in care provision.
The average number of transferrable activities often
undertaken is 2�35 (out of a possible 9); 25% of nurses
specifically indicate that they have often undertaken ‘non-
nursing care’. A difference is also observed in the extent
to which nurses undertake potentially transferrable activi-
ties by time of shift. For example, nurses on afternoon
shifts are less likely to have reported they ‘often’ arranged
patient
discharges/transportation
or
performed
routine
phlebotomy, but more likely to have answered phones,
performed other clerical duties or reported that they filled
in for non-nursing services. The extent to which nurses
undertake
these
‘transferrable’
activities
also
varies
according to the type of role fulfilled – the greater the
level of ‘hands on’ care provided, the greater the number
of transferrable activities RNs report are ‘often’ done
(Table 4).
The descriptive analysis suggests that a complex set of
interrelated factors are associated with care left undone. To
discern the effect of each on care left undone and examine
in detail the association with staffing, these factors were
entered into a multivariate multi-level model (Table 5).
All shifts with RN staffing levels with fewer than 10
patients per RN are associated with reduced odds of care
being left undone compared with those with 10 or more.
Where shifts are staffed with six or fewer patients per RN,
the odds of care being left undone are more than halved
compared with shifts on which there are 10 + patients per
RN (OR 0�466, P < 0�001). RN staffing of fewer than four
patients per RN reduced the odds of care being left undone
by 85% (OR 0�148, P < 0�001). Figure 1 presents this rela-
tionship graphically. By contrast, there appeared to be no
effect from increasing numbers of support workers until it
reached the level of fewer than four patients per support
worker. Where support workers cared for fewer than four
patients, odds of missing care were slightly reduced (OR
0�714, P = 0�021).

being left undone and the number of activities identified as

 tionship with care being left undone and the volume of
activities not completed. When these factors are added into
a multi-level multivariate statistical model, the odds of care
being left undone are significantly and substantially greater
on the worst staffed shifts compared with the best. Thus,
the same association between staffing and care left undone
is found in Sweden, as has been reported using RN4Cast
data from England (Ball et al. 2014) and across Europe
(Ausserhofer et al. 2014). The effect of nurse support
worker staffing, however, was minimal.
The findings presented from Sweden, where local contex-
tual factors have been explored and described in greater
detail, provide an opportunity for us to consider the factors
beyond staffing level that have an association with care that

 is left undone. A reflection on how the findings from Swe-
den contrast with those reported from the same study but a
different country – England – points to differences in the
nature of the RN role and highlights that what RNs do, or
do not do, varies as does the context.
For example, in the previous analysis of English RN4Cast
data, the time of shift was controlled for in the regression
model, recognizing that care and activities undertaken at
night are different from those in the day (Ball et al. 2014).
A more detailed examination of the effect of the time of
shift in the current analysis has found considerable differ-
ences in how wards are staffed, the roles of RNs and in the
care left undone at different times. On day shifts, Swedish
wards have a mean of 5�9 pts per RN and 3�1 patients per
nursing staff including support workers and thus have levels
that are better than the average reported in England (Ball
et al. 2012). But on night shifts, staffing levels in Sweden
are dramatically lower than on day shifts and fall below
the England night time average with 11�4 patient per RN
and 7�9 patients per nursing staff including support work-
ers. There are also significant and substantial differences
between morning/day and afternoon/evening shifts in Swe-
den – an average of 7�0 patients per RN on afternoons and
3�7 patients per nursing staff including support workers
compared with 5�5 and 2�9, respectively, for morning/day
shifts. Given evidence from other countries of increased
risks and adverse outcomes associated with workload and
staffing levels at night range of settings (Gordon & Beckett
2011, de Cordova et al. 2014, Yiu et al. 2014), this war-
rants further exploration.
It is not just the patterns of staffing across shift that
reveals country differences. In Sweden, we have found that
on day shifts, 19% of RNs report that they provide most
of the direct care for patients themselves. In contrast in
England, 31% have been reported as having a primarily
direct care role (Ball et al., 2012). This points to a differ-
ence in the way care is provided and the relative roles of
RNs and support workers in the two countries. Swedish
nurses are less likely than English nurses to report that
they often do the potentially ‘transferrable’ activities listed
on the survey. The differences are greatest in relation to
‘non-nursing care’; 25% of RNs is Sweden reported that
they often undertake such activities compared with 49% in
England. This suggests that there could be a difference in
the way RNs are deployed or that RNs’ perspectives on
what is within the scope of nursing is different between
the two countries. Both undertaking transferrable activities
and having a less direct role in direct care provision are
associated with increased level of care being left undone in
Sweden.
While we see an overall association between staffing and
care left undone in both countries, an exploration of the
other factors that relate to care being left undone thus
points to new insights into the circumstances where care
that is considered necessary is nonetheless left undone on
hospital wards. RNs fulfil different roles and nursing is

JAN: ORIGINAL RESEARCH: EMPIRICAL RESEARCH – QUANTITATIVE
Care left undone in Sweden
 delivered in different ways in different countries, and these
differences impact on what is done and critically on what is
not done. This has implications for the way we undertake,
report and interpret international research that endeavours
to explore the relationship between RN inputs and patient
outcomes.
Despite having different balance in RN staffing between
day, afternoon and night shifts and some differences noted
in RN roles and the degree to which RNs do transferrable
activities, a strong relationship between RN staffing and
care left undone is nonetheless found in both countries.
Given these differences, the pattern observed is surprisingly
similar: for example, staffing of four patients per RN in Swe-
den is associated with a mean of 2�9 items of care left undone
compared with 3�0 in England; staffing of six patients per
RN is associated with 3�5 items of missed care in Sweden
and 3�6 in England. This adds to the growing body of evi-
dence; crucially, this study confirms the relationship between
RN staffing levels and missed care even after controlling for
variation in the roles taken by nurses, patient dependency
and the level of staffing by support workers.
In our analysis of data from England, we saw no associa-
tion between levels of support worker staffing and missed
care (Ball et al. 2014) and hence no evidence that support
workers were effectively substituting for RNs. There is a sig-
nificant interest among policy makers and managers in such
substitution. While research suggests that healthcare support
workers can successfully adapt to new and more advanced
roles, evaluation has been almost exclusively qualitative and
has not focussed on assessing the effectiveness of these substi-
tutions (Wakefield et al. 2009, Kessler et al. 2014). While in
this present study we saw a small benefit when support
worker staffing was at its highest level (compared with hav-
ing no assistants), the effect was modest compared with the
effects of increasing levels of RN staffing. If missed care is
regarded as an inverse measure of productivity, it is unlikely
that substitution would be an efficient approach to reducing
it because the marginal gains from increased RN staffing are
so much higher than for assistants.
In the evidence review conducted for the NICE safe staff-
ing guidance in England, few studies reported on the rela-
tionship between patient factors, nursing roles and the
requirements for nurse staffing (Griffiths et al. 2014). The
results from this study suggest that patients’ requirements
for frequent observation and assistance with daily living
increase the requirements for nursing care staff, specifically
RNs since as the proportion of patients needing such care
increases reports of care left undone also increase (after
control for the current size of the nursing workforce). Simi-
larly nurses undertaking potentially transferable tasks such
as delivering meal trays is associated with an increased
demand for RN staffing, if necessary care is to be com-
pleted. While such assessments may seem largely obvious,
the empirical evidence is limited and these factors are often
omitted from tools designed to indicate staffing require-
ments (Fasoli & Haddock 2010).
Limitations
In interpreting these results, we need to recognize that the
cross-sectional design means that whilst we can draw infer-
ences about the possible nature and prevalence of care left
undone, the findings cannot be used to make assertions
about causation. The measure used to capture ‘care left
undone’ is based on nurses’ accounts and as such is subjec-
tive. Individual nurses may have quite different expecta-
tions and perceptions of the level and type of care that
patients need and the extent to which they have been able
to deliver the required activities. While the care activities
needed (and perceived as necessary by nurse respondents)
are likely to vary according to the time of shift, the study
has endeavoured to take this into account by including
time of shift in the regression models. By using a closed
question and asking about 13 specific activities, we have to
some extent been able to limit the potential variation in
interpretation.
Nurses on hospital wards typically work in teams; we do
not know whether care reported as missed by one nurse
may have been done (either at the time or later) by another
member of staff. In addition, the measure used does not
give an indication of the frequency or volume of each activ-
ity that was left undone – i.e. distinguishing between an
activity missed once or the same activity missed several
items during a shift.
Conclusion
Understanding a range of factors that impinge on the role
that RNs play in delivering care is important, as these fac-
tors are likely to influence the staffing that is needed in a
particular context and at a particular time, to avoid neces-
sary care being left undone by RNs. Despite some differ-
ences
in
RN
role
and
activity
reported,
the
overall
relationship between RN staffing and care left undone in
Sweden is consistent with that reported from England and
across Europe. While completeness of care is a valuable
goal in its own right, more research is, however, needed to
test whether care left undone mediates the relationship fre-
quently observed between RN staffing and patient outcomes
such as mortality.
