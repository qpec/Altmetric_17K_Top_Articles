Sleep paralysis is a relatively common but under-researched phenomenon. While the causes are un-
known, a number of studies have investigated potential risk factors. In this article, we conducted a
systematic review on the available literature regarding variables associated with both the frequency and
intensity of sleep paralysis episodes. A total of 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. For each study,
sample size, study site, sex and age of participants, sleep paralysis measure, and results of analyses
looking at the relationship(s) between sleep paralysis and associated variable(s) were extracted. A large
number of variables were associated with sleep paralysis and a number of themes emerged. These were:
substance use, stress and trauma, genetic influences, physical illness, personality, intelligence, anomalous
beliefs, sleep problems and disorders (both in terms of subjective sleep quality and objective sleep
disruption), symptoms of psychiatric illness in non-clinical samples (particularly anxiety symptoms), and
psychiatric disorders. Sleep paralysis appears to be particularly prevalent in post-traumatic stress dis-
order, and to a less degree, panic disorder. Limitations of the current literature, directions for future
research, and implications for clinical practice are discussed.

Introduction
Sleep paralysis involves a period of time at either sleep onset or
upon awakening from sleep during which voluntary muscle
movements are inhibited. Ocular and respiratory movements
remain unaltered and perception of the immediate environment is
clear [1]. These episodes are frequently associated with a variety of
hallucinations, such as a sense of an evil presence (known as
intruder hallucinations), pressure felt on the chest (incubus hallu-
cinations), and illusory feelings of movement (vestibular-motor (V-
M) hallucinations) [2]. Sleep paralysis is a global phenomenon, with
terms for sleep paralysis existing in over 100 cultures [3]. In many
places, sleep paralysis experiences are interwoven with a culture's
folklore [4,5]. Episodes of sleep paralysis have been suggested as an
explanation for supposed paranormal phenomena such as witch-
craft [6], demonic assault [7], and space alien abduction [8,9]. Fear
and distress are typically associated with episodes [2], though
feelings of bliss are sometimes reported [10].
A review of lifetime prevalence rates of sleep paralysis in the
general population estimated prevalence to be approximately 8%,
though individual study estimates greatly vary from 2 to 60% [11].
The lack of a ‘gold standard’ measure of sleep paralysis is likely part
of the reason for this [3] and the problem is amplified by the fact
that the precise phrasing used to ask about sleep paralysis has been
shown to affect the reported prevalence rate [12]. Averaging over
multiple studies, no effects of age have been found and sex differ-
ences show mixed results [11]. Finally, there are slightly higher
lifetime prevalence rates of sleep paralysis in non-Caucasian
compared to Caucasian groups [11].
In addition to limitations with the measures used to assess sleep
paralysis, another outstanding problem is the lack of consistency
with terminology. Sleep paralysis is a common symptom of nar-
colepsy, a neurological disorder. Narcolepsy is characterised by
excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (sudden, brief, bilateral
losses of muscle tone in response to strong emotions such as
laughter or anger [13]) and disturbed nocturnal sleeping patterns
[14]. Therefore, the term isolated sleep paralysis is preferred when
sleep paralysis is present in the absence of a diagnosis of narcolepsy
[3]. Some authors also use the term fearful isolated sleep paralysis to
indicate cases where episodes are causing clinically significant fear

 and/or distress [3]. Finally, when episodes occur repeatedly, the
term recurrent (fearful) isolated sleep paralysis can be used, though
there is no agreement on exactly how often episodes need to occur
in order to be considered recurrent [15,16].
The causes of sleep paralysis are likely to be multifactorial [17]. It
is therefore important for clinicians and researchers to understand
the factors that may influence the frequency and intensity of epi-
sodes. Here, we systematically review the available literature
regarding variables associated with sleep paralysis. It is hoped that
this review will provide a resource to both clinicians, who shall
have a better understanding of this common experience, and also
researchers interested in formulating new research questions.
Methods
A literature search was performed using OvidSP on the following
databases: Ovid MEDLINE (1946 e September 2015); PsycINFO (1806
e September 2015); Journals@Ovid Full Text (e September 2015);
and PsycARTICLES Full Text (e September 2015). The following search
terms were used: “sleep paralysis”, “isolated sleep paralysis”, “par-
asomnia not otherwise specified”, “hypnagogic”, “hypnopompic”,
“parasomnia”, “sensed presence”, and “incubus”.
There was no restriction made on the age of articles included in
this review. For all identified articles published since 2000, refer-
ence lists were also scanned to see whether we had missed any
articles suitable for inclusion in this review. Furthermore, manual
searches were conducted of all journals containing more than five
of the studies identified via the database searches. Where this
happened, only articles published since 2000 were scanned for
reasons of feasibility. These steps allowed us to reduce the possi-
bility of non-indexed studies being missed.
For inclusion in this systematic review, studies were required to
meet the following criteria:
1) Results are presented as a full original research paper pub-
lished in a peer-reviewed journal.
2) Sleep paralysis is clearly defined, and it is clear that sleep
paralysis has been identified in the sample, and is not
another phenomenon (e.g., night terrors, hypnagogic/hyp-
nopompic hallucinations with no paralysis, nightmares).
3) The presence of sleep paralysis in the sample was measured
either via a continuous measure of frequency or a binary
sleep paralysis present/absent measure.
4) An association has been explored between sleep paralysis
and other variable(s). Either a comparison between groups
(e.g., sleep paralysis vs no sleep paralysis) or an association
between sleep paralysis frequency/intensity and the vari-
able(s) under study.
5) Single case studies were excluded.
6) Review, commentary, or opinion articles not including any
original data were excluded (but reference lists from such
papers were checked, in line with the search strategy).
7) Only English language articles were included.
In total, 35 articles were identified that matched all the inclusion
criteria. One article was found by searching article reference lists,
and one was obtained through personal correspondence. Further-
more, an additional five articles that also matched all the inclusion
criteria were recommended by a reviewer. Therefore, a total of 42
articles were included in this report. The process for selecting
studies is displayed in the Supplementary materials. From the
included studies, the following data were extracted: Sample size
and study site, sex and age of participants, sleep paralysis measure,
and results of analyses looking at the relationship(s) between sleep
paralysis and associated variable(s).
Results
The articles included in the review can be found in Table 1. The
studies identified come from a wide range of different research
groups, providing a highly international and cross-cultural sample.
Studies looking at associations between sleep paralysis and
other variables are found in Table 2. Associations between sleep
paralysis and variables specifically related to sleep-related factors
are displayed in Table 3, with associations with other sleep disor-
ders shown in Table 4. Table 5 shows associations between sleep
paralysis and symptoms of psychiatric illness. Finally, Table 6 shows
associations with psychiatric disorders and medication. Overall, the
majority of studies looked at sleep paralysis frequency alone, with
fewer studies examining variables associated with the intensity
and/or vividness of sleep paralysis and associated hallucinations.
Demographics
Relationships between demographic variables and sleep paral-
ysis are shown in Table 2. Generally, studies that have investigated
age differences in sleep paralysis prevalence have found no sig-
nificant effect of age [17e21]. Similarly for sex differences the
majority of studies found no significant effects [17e19,22e27]. Two
large-scale surveys of Asian adolescents did find significant sex
differences, with higher prevalence in females though the reported
differences were very small. Munezawa and colleagues found an
8.2% prevalence for males and 8.4% for females. Ma et al. found a
prevalence of 6.1% for males and 7.4% for females [24,28]. In a study
of Hmong immigrants, higher odds of experiencing sleep paralysis
were found in male participants (odds ratio (OR) ¼ 1.61), though
the exact prevalence rates for both sexes were not reported [21].
Finally, a study in an American sample found that males were more
likely to have experienced lifetime isolated sleep paralysis than
females, but there were no differences in lifetime fearful or recur-
rent fearful isolated sleep paralysis episodes [29]. With regards to
ethnicity, evidence is also mixed. One study found African Amer-
ican individuals experienced a higher incidence of sleep paralysis
compared with Caucasians [30]. A second study found that non-
Caucasians had a higher prevalence of fearful and recurrent fear-
ful isolated sleep paralysis compared to Caucasians [29]. Two other
studies however found no significant effect of ethnicity [23,31].
Presence of sleep paralysis was shown to be higher in rural
compared to urban areas in a survey of Chinese adolescents [28].
Having a higher amount of available money had a small but sig-
nificant association with the presence of sleep paralysis (10.9% of
participants with ¥5000 or more available to them experienced
sleep paralysis compared with 7.3% who had less than ¥5000
available) in one Japanese sample, as did regularly eating breakfast,
with those who ate breakfast everyday reporting a lower incidence
of sleep paralysis (7.5%) compared to those who ate breakfast oc-
casionally (10.8%) [24], though findings are inconsistent [21,32]. It is
unclear why these variables should be associated with sleep pa-
ralysis. Some research suggests that food timing may be important
in the synchronisation of internal circadian clocks [33]. It is possible
that by eating breakfast only occasionally, circadian clocks are
disrupted leading to an increased incidence of sleep paralysis.
Drinking alcohol, smoking, and substance use
Relationships between substance-use variables and sleep pa-
ralysis are shown in Table 2. It is unclear whether sleep paralysis is
associated with general substance use. In two large nationwide
samples in China (N ¼ 11,754) and Japan (N ¼ 90,081) it was found
that those who reported drinking at least one alcoholic drink per
day over the last month were significantly more likely (9e12%) than

 others (6e7%) to report experiencing sleep paralysis [24,28].
However, in a large (N ¼ 862) UK sample where self-reported
weekly alcohol consumption in terms of units of alcohol was
recorded, alcohol intake over the past week did not predict sleep
paralysis independently of anxiety symptoms, depressed mood,
threatening events, and sleep quality [17].
Evidence for the association between smoking behaviour and
sleep paralysis is also mixed e with increased odds of experiencing
sleep paralysis in those who smoked (defined as at least one ciga-
rette a day) (15%) compared with those who did not (8%) [24]. This
relationship was not found in two other studies [17,28]. Of note,
none of the studies on this topic have provided a quantitative es-
timate of amount of nicotine consumed. Given the negative impact
caffeine can have on sleep [34], it was surprising that there was no
evidence of a significant association between caffeine intake and
sleep paralysis [17,28].
Stress and trauma
Relationships between stress and trauma, and sleep paralysis
are shown in Table 2. A confirmed or unconfirmed history of
childhood sexual abuse (CSA) was found to be significantly related
to frequency of sleep paralysis episodes [35]. This study defined a
confirmed case of CSA as either having a person other than the
victim and/or abuser confirm the abuse, or that other people con-
fronted the abuser, or that the abuser was charged in connection
with the abuse. An unconfirmed history of CSA was defined as
having vivid recollections of abuse in the absence of anyone being
aware of it/no one being confronted or charged as the abuser. The
frequency and intensity of intruder and incubus hallucinations
were significantly greater in both CSA groups as compared to those
who did not report sexual abuse [35]. No differences in terms of V-
M hallucinations were found between groups. Another study found
the reported prevalence of sleep paralysis did not differ signifi-
cantly between groups of participants who reported remembering
their CSA (47%) with those who believed they had experienced CSA
but possessed no autobiographical memories of it (44%). Sleep
paralysis prevalence was significantly higher in both CSA groups
compared to a control group who reported not having experienced
CSA (13%) [36].
Other experiences of threatening/traumatic events also appear
to be related to sleep paralysis. In a sample of Hmong immigrants
living in the USA, stressful experiences during the Vietnam war
(e.g., “I was exposed to chemical warfare”, “I lost family, close rel-
atives or friends”) were related to increased odds of experiencing
sleep paralysis [21]. General experiences with potentially traumatic
events (such as assault, death of a loved one, disasters, etc.) were
found to be related to sleep paralysis in terms of the occurrence of a
traumatic event [37]. Also a link was found between increasing
numbers of traumatic events experienced and sleep paralysis
[17,37]. Relatedly, self-report levels of life-stress showed similar
associations with sleep paralysis [19,38,39]. In studies of Nigerian
doctors and nurses, the authors did not find a relationship between
sleep paralysis and threatening events [26,27]. This may be due to a
smaller sample size or could be because of the specific de-
mographic targeted.
Hereditary factors
Relationships between hereditary factors and sleep paralysis are
shown in Table 2. A familial association has been reported for sleep
paralysis [25,40,41]. One study by us used a twin modelling
approach to disentangle genetic from environmental effects. There
appeared to be moderate genetic influences (estimated at 53%) on
variation in presence of sleep paralysis [17]. A number of specific
genes involved in circadian cycles were also examined and specific
polymorphisms of the PER2 gene were associated with sleep pa-
ralysis although the association was no longer significant when
adjusting for multiple testing [17]. Another study employing a very
small sample (N ¼ 44) found no association between sleep paralysis
and narcolepsy genes HLA DR2 or HLA DQ1 [41].
Physical health
Relationships between physical health and sleep paralysis are
shown in Table 2. General physical health problems appear to be
associated with sleep paralysis when using general physical health
quality of life scales [20,42,43], though this was not found in one
study [18]. Little research however has linked any specific physical
health problems with sleep paralysis. For example, body mass in-
dex (BMI) was not found to be related to whether someone re-
ported having experienced sleep paralysis during their lifetime [32]
or to vary with frequency of episodes [20]. However, in another
study, higher BMI was related to both lifetime and recurrent epi-
sodes of fearful isolated sleep paralysis but not related to lifetime
non-fearful isolated sleep paralysis [29]. In an experimental study,

 participants who experienced sleep paralysis in a laboratory envi-
ronment showed higher diastolic and lower systolic blood pressure
in sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMP; REM episodes that occur
abnormally early in the sleep cycle, defined in this study as within
25 min of sleep onset) preceding a sleep paralysis episode
compared to SOREMPs without sleep paralysis [42]. Finally, one
study showed that complaints of chronic pain were linked to the
presence of sleep paralysis experiences [21].
Personality, intelligence, and anomalous beliefs
Relationships with sleep paralysis are shown in Table 2. Mea-
sures of personality traits, such as the Eysenck personality ques-
tionnaire, do not appear to be related to sleep paralysis frequency
[22,26,27,38]. Levels of waking state dissociative experiences,
involving depersonalisation, derealisation, and amnesia, were
found to be related to both sleep paralysis frequency [36] and the
frequency/intensity of all three hallucination types [35]. The degree
to which individuals become absorbed in their mental fantasy has
been linked to hallucination frequency and intensity [35], but
another study did not find absorption to be related to overall
episode frequency [36]. It should be noted that these studies were
conducted in groups containing individuals who had experienced
CSA. However, another study in a more general sample found
dissociative experiences to be linked to sleep paralysis frequency,
and also to intruder and V-M hallucinations [39].
In a university sample, a composite measure of “imaginative-
ness” that comprised scales of absorption, fantasy proneness,
magical thinking, imagery vividness, paranormal and mystic be-
liefs, perceptual aberration, and unusual sensory experiences, was
related to sleep paralysis frequency and intensity [22]. It was un-
clear which of these components was driving the relationship. In
the same sample, those reporting sleep paralysis compared to
others showed greater hypnotisability assessed both subjectively
and objectively [22]. Sensory imagery vividness was found to not be
related to sleep paralysis frequency, but significantly predicted the
intensity of all three hallucination types [39]. Frequency of day-
dreams was not related to sleep paralysis, but daydreaming style,
particularly positive constructive daydreams, was related to V-M
hallucinations [39].
One study looked at intelligence in relation to sleep paralysis
and found a significant negative association between intelligence
quotient (IQ) and reports of lifetime isolated sleep paralysis, fearful
isolated sleep paralysis, and fearful recurrent isolated sleep paral-
ysis [29]. When levels of paranormal belief have been examined,
mixed evidence has been found, with some studies finding no
relationship [19,22], whilst others report links [39]. Paranormal
beliefs have also been related to intruder and V-M hallucinations
during sleep paralysis [39]. Levels of belief in conspiracy theories
have been found not to relate to sleep paralysis [39].
Sleep-related factors
Relationships between sleep-related variables and sleep paral-
ysis are shown in Table 3. Symptoms of automatic behaviour, the
spontaneous production of purposeless verbal or motor behaviour
without conscious control, an auxiliary symptom of narcolepsy
[44], were found to predict sleep paralysis independently of age,
physical health, sleep problems, mental health, and psychiatric
medication [20]. In a specific sample of 747 Hmong immigrants
living in the USA, sleep paralysis was higher in individuals who had
a relative who had suffered sudden unexpected nocturnal death
syndrome (SUNDS) (29% of the sample reported having a relative
die of SUNDS) [21] as compared to those who did not have a relative
die of SUNDS.
A number of ‘anomalous’ sleep experiences appear to be more
common in people who also experience sleep paralysis. Experi-
encing nightmares appears to be common in those with sleep pa-
ralysis, as an association has been found in a number of studies
[22,24,32]. Responses to whether participants have ever experi-
enced a lucid dream, which is a dream in which the dreamer, whilst
dreaming, is aware that they are in a dream [45], showed no rela-
tionship with sleep paralysis frequency in two studies [22,46].
However, in another study that used a continuous measure of lucid
dreaming frequency, a significant association with sleep paralysis
was found [39]. This was particularly true of sleep paralysis

 episodes featuring V-M hallucinations [39]. Hypnopompic (sleep-
offset) hallucinations were a significant predictor of sleep paralysis,
though it is possible that these hallucinations were not occurring
during sleep paralysis [20]. Exploding head syndrome (hearing loud
noises such as explosions at wakeesleep or sleepewake transi-
tions) is more common in individuals reporting episodes of fearful
isolated sleep paralysis than in those not reporting sleep paralysis
(37% vs 14%) [47]. Out-of-body experiences (OBE), often associated
with REM sleep [48,49], were reported to be associated with sleep
paralysis although the possibility that the OBE was a hallucination
experienced during sleep paralysis cannot be ruled out [22].
Two experimental studies were able to induce episodes of sleep
paralysis in a laboratory environment [42,50]. Sleep can be distin-
guished into different stages. Currently a broad distinction is made
between rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement
(NREM) sleep. Within NREM, sleep is further divided into stage 1,
stage 2, and stage 3. A typical sleep cycle comprises of the individual
progressing from stage 1 to stage 2 to stage 3, and then back to stage
1 before entering a period of REM sleep. In a study of 16 participants,
who had all self-reported having sleep paralysis at least twice, it was
shown that SOREMPs triggered by sleep disruption, led to six epi-
sodes of sleep paralysis (10% of all SOREMPs), with all but one
reporting multisensory hallucinations and feelings of fear and dread
[50]. This study induced six episodes from 64 sleep disruptions (9%).
Polysomnography (PSG) recordings showed sleep paralysis epi-
sodes to contain abundant alpha (8e13 Hz) EEG activity, indicative
of relaxed wakefulness, i.e., not expected during sleep, occurring
with persistence of muscle atonia during sleep paralysis [50].
A second study using 13 participants, again selected based on
self-reporting at least two lifetime episodes of sleep paralysis,
induced a total of eight episodes of sleep paralysis from 184 sleep
interruptions (4%) using a multi-phasic sleep wake schedule [42].
Six of the eight episodes occurred following a SOREMP whilst no
episodes occurred following a regular REM period. The other two
sleep paralysis episodes occurred immediately after sleep onset
and, even though PSG data suggested a REM period was imminent,
activity could not be scored as REM in the conventional manner
[42]. Participants who had episodes of sleep paralysis in the labo-
ratory showed increased amounts of stage 1 sleep, compared to
participants who did not experience sleep paralysis. Furthermore,
poorer performance on a vigilance task (longer reaction times) was
found before a SOREMP with sleep paralysis. More generally, poorer
vigilance task performance, and increased subjective sleepiness
were found in the sleep paralysis group [42]. It should be noted in
both of these studies, SOREMPs were defined as REM periods
occurring within 25 min of sleep onset. This differs from the
American Academy of Sleep Medicine definition, which defines a
SOREMP as REM sleep occurring within 15 min of sleep onset [1].
Related to sleep disruption, shiftwork was related to a higher self-
reported prevalence of sleep paralysis (48% vs 36%) [51].
Subjective sleep quality, as assessed via measures such as the
Pittsburgh sleep quality index [52], was found to be related to sleep
paralysis in multiple studies [17,18,24,28,32,39]. Excessive daytime
sleepiness was associated with sleep paralysis in two studies [18,24],
with another two finding no association [20,25]. Particular aspects
of ‘sleep hygiene’ (which refers to habits and practices that are
conducive to sleeping well on a regular basis) were associated with
greater odds of reporting sleep paralysis. Specifically, excessively
short (<6 h) [24,28,32] or long (>9 h) [24,28] sleep duration and
napping [32], especially long naps (>2 h) [24,28], were associated

 with increased odds of sleep paralysis. Long self-reported sleep la-
tency (>30 min) and difficulty initiating sleep were related to an
increased likelihood of reporting sleep paralysis [24,32]. Bedtimes
also showed some relationship to sleep paralysis. With a bedtime of
22:00 h as the reference group, the odds of having ever experienced
sleep paralysis (compared with never having experienced sleep
paralysis) were significantly reduced in participants reporting a
bedtime between 22:00 h and midnight, and significantly increased
in participants reporting a bedtime later than midnight [24,28].
Sleep paralysis episodes are most likely to occur when the indi-
vidual is lying in the supine position (on the back) [53,54]. Despite
this, it was shownthat peoplewhohadreportedexperiencingat least
one episode of sleep paralysis, as compared to those who had not,
were no more likely to fall asleep lying in the supine position [53].
Distribution of sleep paralysis events show a weakly bi-modal
distribution with 28% of episodes occurring within an hour after
bedtime and 26% occurring five or more hours following bedtime
[55]. Perhaps unsurprisingly, hypnagogic (when falling asleep)
episodes of sleep paralysis were most prominent in the first hour
after bedtime, hypnomesic (sometime during sleep) episodes most
common between 1 and 3 h after bedtime, and hypnopompic ep-
isodes were most common between 6 and 12 h post bedtime [55].
Overall, hypnomesic episodes were most common [55].
Sleep disorders
Associations between sleep paralysis and other sleep disorders
are shown in Table 4. In a large population-level study, insomnia
disorder was not associated with increased prevalence of sleep
paralysis, however non-restorative sleep, a common symptom of
insomnia [1], was associated with increased sleep paralysis rates
(33% vs 13%) [20]. In a further study, disrupted sleep (defined as
waking up repeatedly during the night) was a significant predictor
of sleep paralysis, with those reporting disrupted sleep more than

 five nights per month being three times more likely to experience
sleep paralysis compared to those reporting less than five nights of
disrupted sleep per month [56]. One study reported increased sleep
paralysis in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) patients compared to
controls (20% vs 5%) [57], however no independent association was
found in a separate study [20]. In studies of narcoleptic populations,
patients had a higher sleep paralysis prevalence than controls (59%
vs 15%) [46]. Another study showed differing sleep paralysis prev-
alence rates in narcolepsy patients with varying concentrations of
cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin 1 [58], which is a biomarker
for narcolepsy [59]. Those with below 200 pg/ml concentration
exhibited more frequent episodes of sleep paralysis (52%) than
those with a normal concentration of CSF hypocretin-1 (33%).
Despite the increased frequency of episodes, there were no signif-
icant differences in episode severity between groups [58]. In a
different study also with narcolepsy patients, those who experi-
enced narcolepsy with idiopathic hypersomnia showed no signifi-
cant differences in sleep paralysis frequency compared to those
with narcolespy without hypersomnia [60]. Prevalence of sleep
paralysis
did
not
differ
between
two
groups
of
idiopathic
hypersomnia patients, when comparing patients who either did or
did not have a long sleep time [61].
Using minimal International classification of sleep disorders 90
(ICSD-90) criteria [62], and a large population-level sample [20],
those with sleep paralysis, as compared to those without, showed
higher rates of a number of dyssomnias (disorders of getting to
sleep and staying asleep) and parasomnias (disorders of abnormal/
unusual behaviours during sleep). Ohayon and colleagues found
that no disorder other than nocturnal leg cramps predicted sleep
paralysis frequency in a multiple predictor model [20,22].
Symptoms of psychiatric illness
Relationships between symptoms of psychiatric illness and
sleep paralysis are shown in Table 5. In non-clinical samples,
multiple studies have examined the links between sleep paralysis
and general mental health problems. The latter have been indexed
by scales such as the mental health short-form, which gives an
index of a person's quality of mental health. These studies have
shown that poorer general mental health is significantly associated

 with frequency of sleep paralysis [18,22,24,25,28,42], although two
studies of Nigerian health workers did not find a relationship
[26,27].
Mirroring
the
clinical
findings,
anxiety-related
symptoms
appear to be associated with sleep paralysis [17,38,39], though this
was not found in all studies [56]. Furthermore, anxiety sensitivity
(fear of the physical symptoms of anxiety) showed a small but
significant relationship with the presence of sleep paralysis in one
study [19]. A second study showed anxiety sensitivity to be
significantly correlated with lifetime and recurrent fearful sleep
paralysis [29]. Social anxiety symptoms also appear to be related to
sleep paralysis, with a study finding participants who experienced
sleep paralysis with a ‘felt presence’ hallucination showing higher
levels of social anxiety than participants who experienced sleep
paralysis without hallucinations [63]. Felt presence hallucinations
during sleep paralysis have also been related to the amount of
distress associated with an episode of sleep paralysis. The level of
distress related to sleep paralysis episodes was associated with
dysfunctional social imagery [64].
Higher scores on self-report measures of depressed mood have
been associated with sleep paralysis frequency [29,36,37]. It has
also been shown that this relationship remains significant after
anxiety symptoms have been controlled for [56]. However, other
multivariate
studies
assessing
multiple
predictors
(such
as
depressed mood, anxiety symptoms, alcohol intake, threatening
events, sleep quality, dissociative experiences, daydreaming, and
sensory imagery) did not find depressed mood to independently
predict sleep paralysis [17,39].
Psychiatric disorders and medication use
Results focussing on sleep paralysis in relation to psychiatric
illness and medication are displayed in Table 6. Patients with a
diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in American,
Cambodian, and Chinese samples all showed higher prevalence of
sleep paralysis (between 65 and 100%) compared to healthy con-
trols (20e25%) [65e67]. In a study focussing on fearful isolated
sleep paralysis in patients with panic attacks, individuals who also

 were diagnosed with PTSD were significantly more likely to expe-
rience recurrent fearful isolated sleep paralysis compared with
patients with panic attacks but without PTSD [29]. No differences
were found with regards to lifetime isolated sleep paralysis in those
with and without PTSD. Significant positive correlations between
PTSD symptoms and intruder, incubus, and vestibular-motor (V-M)
hallucination frequency and intensity during sleep paralysis epi-
sodes were found in one study [35]. This suggests that PTSD is
associated with both the frequency and intensity of sleep paralysis
episodes, though a separate study did not find a link between PTSD
and fear/distress experienced during sleep paralysis [19]. In a
sample of 142 African Americans, whilst both current (25% vs 20%)
and lifetime (56% vs 48%) PTSD diagnosis rates were numerically
higher in participants with sleep paralysis, this study did not find
statistically significant differences [37].
Significantly higher prevalence rates of sleep paralysis in pa-
tients with panic disorder were also found. Lifetime prevalence
rates of 56e59% were reported for panic disorder patients which
was significantly higher than those without panic disorder [30,67],
whose prevalence was approximately 19% [67], though not all
studies found this difference [37]. Another study found 31% of
participants who had experienced sleep paralysis met diagnostic
criteria for clinical or subclinical panic disorder, whilst none of
those who did not experience sleep paralysis met diagnostic criteria
[19]. In a study comprising African American and Caucasian par-
ticipants, patients with panic disorder were significantly more
likely to experience recurrent sleep paralysis (defined as fourþ
episodes per year) (36%) as compared to patients with other anxi-
ety disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia,
and generalised anxiety disorder (11%) [30]. In a further study, in-
dividuals with frequent sleep paralysis were more likely to have
experienced panic attacks than those with less frequent/no sleep
paralysis, though exact prevalence rates were not reported [40]. In
other studies focussing on panic attacks, sleep paralysis was more
common in individuals with panic attacks (32e49%) compared to
those without (10e15%) [31,37].
Studies that have considered anxiety disorders more generally
have shown that participants with self-reported anxiety disorders
were significantly more likely to experience sleep paralysis than
those without [31]. However, other studies have failed to find
anxiety disorders to be a significant predictor of sleep paralysis
[20,29]. One study found slightly higher prevalence rates for pa-
tients with panic disorder (21%) and social phobia (22%) compared
with generalised anxiety disorder (16%), though differences were
not significant (this may be due to the low sample size, N ¼ 62). This
study did however find a significant association between the
presence of sleep paralysis and a co-morbid anxiety disorder (35%),
compared to being diagnosed with a single anxiety disorder (11%)
[23]. Similarly, another study found that the number of fearful sleep
paralysis episodes was positively correlated with the total number
of anxiety and mood disorder diagnoses [29].
There is less evidence for an association between sleep paralysis
and depression. Specifically, sleep paralysis prevalence was not
significantly higher in a group meeting diagnostic criteria for
depression (31%) compared with a group who did not meet the
criteria (28%) [37]. In a study of outpatients with anxiety disorders,
a comorbid depression diagnosis was not associated with an
increased prevalence in sleep paralysis compared to patients
without comorbid depression [23]. In a population level survey of
over 4000 individuals, depression (as assessed by DSM-IV criteria)
was not significantly related to sleep paralysis in a multiple pre-
dictor model (including age, physical health, sleep problems, bi-
polar disorder, and psychiatric medication) [20]. One study
however did find a significant correlation between depression and
recurrent fearful sleep paralysis, with both lifetime and lifetime
fearful sleep paralysis showing no relationship to depression [29].
There has been just one study looking at bipolar disorder and sleep
paralysis. Here it was found that bipolar disorder occurred more
frequently in a severe sleep paralysis group, defined here as at least
one episode per week (19%), compared with a no sleep paralysis
group (2%) [20]. Sleep paralysis has been associated with a lifetime,
but not current, diagnosis of alcohol/substance abuse disorder [37].
There is little evidence regarding the association between psy-
chiatric medication use and sleep paralysis (see Table 6). Whilst one
study found higher use of anxiolytic medication in individuals with
weekly sleep paralysis as compared to those without [20], the
reasons for this medication use was unclear. Other studies have
failed to link anxiolytic medications with sleep paralysis [23]. The
use of anti-depressant [20,23,29,56] and hypnotic medications [20]
was also found not to be related to sleep paralysis frequency.
Discussion
This review set out to investigate variables associated with ep-
isodes of sleep paralysis. Whilst strengths in the current literature
include a wide range of variables investigated and a diverse array of
samples, plus a number of relatively large-scale studies, limitations
currently exist that should be addressed in future research.
As described in the introduction, a great deal of variation in
terms of measures to assess sleep paralysis was noted (as shown in
Table 1). Furthermore, very few studies reviewed provided any
evidence regarding the psychometric validity/reliability of their
chosen measure. The Waterloo unusual sleep experiences ques-
tionnaire (WUSEQ) has been shown to have a reliable three-factor
structure [2,10] and internal reliability (as assessed by Cronbach's
alpha) was shown to be good in one study that reported it [39].
Furthermore, research to date has relied on retrospective reporting.
As many studies assessed lifetime prevalence of sleep paralysis, the
reliability of such measures is questionable. Some studies using a
prospective measure of sleep paralysis have found a similar factor
structure of hallucinations to when retrospective measures are
used [68,69]. However, no studies to date have assessed associated
variables using a prospective design. This is an important area for
future research as it will allow for a more accurate assessment of
sleep paralysis episodes and their predictors.
Few studies have distinguished between sleep paralysis epi-
sodes with and without clinically significant distress (i.e., fearful
sleep paralysis) [29]. This is an important distinction to make when
considering the clinical impact episodes are having on an individ-
ual. Whilst a large number of variables have shown an association
with sleep paralysis, future studies should work to further isolate
the factors that specifically predict episodes where clinically sig-
nificant levels of distress are present. This would help further refine
our knowledge regarding relationships between sleep paralysis and
other variables, but also prove beneficial in aiding clinical in-
terventions for those whose lives are being adversely affected by
severe episodes.
Similarly, some episodes of sleep paralysis are reported as
positive experiences, especially episodes containing V-M halluci-
nations [10]. An interesting future investigation would be to look at
whether there are any characteristics that specifically predict these
‘blissful’ sleep paralysis experiences and whether positive and
fearful episodes can be dissociated based on the variables that
predict them.
From the studies conducted to date on the variables associated
with sleep paralysis, no longitudinal investigations have been
conducted. Whilst the cross-sectional research carried out so far
has been useful in establishing the existence of important re-
lationships, the direction of these effects cannot be inferred. Future
work
should

 understanding the nature of these associations. For example, do
high levels of stress and anxiety lead to more frequent episodes of
sleep paralysis or do frequent episodes of sleep paralysis result in
higher levels of stress and anxiety?
Potential mediators and/or moderators of relationships are also
still to be evaluated. Again, studies investigating these issues would
be useful in better refining our understanding of which factors
precipitate the occurrence of episodes. For example, one prediction
could be that anxiety is related to sleep paralysis via an indirect
effect of poorer sleep quality [70], which in this instance would be
acting as a mediator.
Finally, do certain variables, such as a genetic predisposition,
make the underlying risk of sleep paralysis more likely, but are
other variables, such as experiencing a particular stressor, respon-
sible for triggering a specific episode? Exploring this potential
gene � environment interaction is an important goal for future
studies. Anecdotal evidence suggests that sleep paralysis episodes
often occur in ‘waves’, with high frequency periods followed by
times of no sleep paralysis. Understanding the factors that trigger
possible periods of multiple episodes should be undertaken in the
future, and could be achieved by techniques such as sleep diary
studies, and also experience sampling, which involves repeated
sampling of sleep and waking experiences as they occur in
ecologically valid settings.
One limitation of our review is the breadth of the search terms
used. As we identified studies based on keywords related to sleep
paralysis, it is possible that studies that included sleep paralysis not
as a primary aim may have been missed. In particular, this may
occur in assessment of other sleep disorders, that only asked about
sleep paralysis as a secondary point. Capturing these studies would
require searching for articles relating to each sleep disorder spe-
cifically and searching through texts to find sleep paralysis mea-
sures. A preliminary search for the key words ‘insomnia disorder’
for example, resulted in over 13,000 hits. Should we do this for
every sleep disorder we would obtain many times this number of
articles. It was not practical to manually search this number of ar-
ticles by hand. Readers should keep this limitation in mind when
considering the findings of this work.
Despite these limitations, the research reviewed here has pro-
vided important insights into variables associated with sleep pa-
ralysis. For example, rates of sleep paralysis do appear to be elevated
in a number of sleep disorders, especially narcolepsy [46,58].
Studies also suggested an increased prevalence in obstructive sleep
apnoea patients [57], nocturnal leg cramps [20], as well as those
suffering from insomnia symptoms [20,56]. Interestingly, one study
that was not included in this review because of a lack of a control
group found a sleep paralysis prevalence rate of 14% in patients with
KleineeLevine syndrome [71] (a sleep disorder characterised by
episodes of severe hypersomnolence in association with cognitive,
psychiatric, and behavioural disturbances [1]). Without a control
group it is hard to say whether this prevalence is increased relative
to controls. In the only study to assess the prevalence of multiple
sleep disorders in those with or without SP, few links were found
[20]. However, it should be noted that diagnoses were made by a
trained computer system and not by a sleep medicine clinician. In
the clinical setting, sleep paralysis often occurs within the context
of disturbed sleep. Preliminary experimental work into the link
between SOREMPs and sleep paralysis, and self-report measures of
poor sleep quality, support this idea [17,18,24,28,32,39,42,50].
Certain psychiatric groups showed higher rates of sleep paralysis
compared to controls, especially patients with PTSD [29,65e67].
Whether sleep paralysis is the cause or the consequence of PTSD is
unclear, however some studies focused on patients who had
experienced trauma during the Cambodian civil war suggest that
sleep paralysis appears as a symptom of the PTSD [65,66].
Qualitative evidence also suggests that the hallmark symptom of
‘flashbacks’ present in PTSD may actually manifest as hallucinations
occurring during sleep paralysis [65,66]. It is also now well-
documented that PTSD patients often suffer from ‘disruptive
nocturnal behaviours’ (DNB) such as trauma-related nightmares
[72]. Future research should consider DNBs alongside sleep paral-
ysis to ascertain whether these two sleep phenomena are closely
linked in this illness. Anxiety disorders generally, and panic disor-
der in particular, also appear to be associated with a higher prev-
alence of sleep paralysis [19,23,30,31,40,67], with preliminary
evidence suggesting that socially anxious individuals who also
experience felt presence hallucinations during wakefulness are
more likely to experience sensed presence hallucinations during
sleep paralysis, compared to socially anxious individuals who do
not experience felt presence hallucinations during wakefulness
[63]. These findings are especially important for clinicians, and
suggest that experiences of sleep paralysis should be more routinely
assessed within certain psychiatric groups. No studies reviewed
looked at associations between sleep paralysis and schizophrenia.
However one study estimated a prevalence of 15% in schizophrenia
patients, though they did not have a control group [73]. This
prevalence does not seem abnormally different to prevalence esti-
mates in healthy samples [11], though differential diagnosis be-
tween these two conditions is an important consideration [74].
There is still very little work into successful interventions for
reducing and/or improving outcomes for individuals suffering from
severe cases of sleep paralysis. We did not find clear evidence that
sleep paralysis frequency was associated with any psychiatric
medications [20,23,29,56]. However, it should be noted that none
of the studies on this topic had a primary aim of investigating the
efficacy of any particular medication. No studies reviewed sys-
tematically investigated whether a specific medication led to a
reduction in sleep paralysis episodes. Rather, these studies looked
to see whether taking medications predicted sleep paralysis in a
cross-sectional design, with minimal information regarding why
the medication was being taken, how long the medication was
being taken, and what the exact dosages were. It is currently un-
clear whether these substances are or are not effective in reducing
sleep paralysis symptoms, as suitable studies to test these hy-
potheses are yet to be performed. This is a clear area for future
research. Research into treatment options for narcolepsy have not
yielded many insights into potential treatments for sleep paralysis.
A 2007 report by the AASM [75] suggested sodium oxybate as an
effective for treatment of cataplexy, daytime sleepiness, and dis-
rupted sleep due to narcolepsy, but evidence for its effectiveness in
treating sleep paralysis was mixed and based on lower quality ev-
idence. One double-blind, placebo-controlled trial looking at so-
dium oxybate for treating narcolepsy found changes in sleep
paralysis did not differ from placebo [76]. A follow-up study by the
same group did however find a 6 g dosage sodium oxybate to lead
to a reduction in episodes [77]. With regards to selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other antidepressant medication,
the report concluded that this recommendation is based on anec-
dotal clinical experience [75]. Many clinicians do prescribe anti-
depressant medications (such as SSRIs) to those with narcolepsy to
help alleviate both symptoms of cataplexy and sleep paralysis. The
hypothesised mechanism of action is to enhance postural muscle
tone during REM sleep, the stage of sleep most associated with
sleep paralysis [74]. Despite this reasonable theoretical link be-
tween SSRIs and sleep paralysis, more studies need to be conducted
in the future on this important topic. It has been noted that sensory
stimulation may help end sleep paralysis episodes, but may be even
more unpleasant than the sleep paralysis itself [78].
This review suggests a couple of areas where potential in-
terventions could be targeted. As factors such as anxiety and stress

 appear to be linked with sleep paralysis [17,19,38,39,43], techniques
aiming to reduce levels of these factors may also help in alleviating
sleep paralysis episodes. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has
been shown to be useful in reducing levels of anxiety [79] and
coping with stress [80], and has also been shown to be effective in
various sleep disorders, particularly insomnia [81,82]. A CBT for
isolated sleep paralysis manual now exists as a promising therapy
[3], however systematic evidence for its effectiveness is still lacking.
Poor subjective sleep quality was shown to be consistently
related to sleep paralysis [17,18,24,28,32,39], suggesting that efforts
to improve the quality of an individual's sleep could help in
reducing sleep paralysis episodes. The importance of sleep hygiene
in various parasomnias, including sleep paralysis, has been sug-
gested before [83]. Sleep hygiene education is intended to improve
sleep initiation and maintenance, through interventions such as
adjusting bedroom temperature, avoiding alcohol close to bedtime,
and going to bed and waking up at similar times each day [3,84].
Based on the evidence reviewed here, future work into sleep hy-
giene education and sleep paralysis is warranted [3].
Very little experimental work into the underlying neurophysi-
ology of sleep paralysis has been performed. It does appear how-
ever that episodes are linked with sleep disruption and are
particularly associated with SOREMPs [42,50]. Preliminary genetic
evidence also suggests a link with altered circadian rhythms [17]. At
a neurobiological level, the paralysis associated with REM sleep is
believed to be regulated by the GABA and glycine neurotransmitter
systems, which are important in the inhibition of motor neurons
during REM sleep, so contributing to the muscle atonia [85]. What
is currently unknown is why some people regain waking levels of
consciousness during REM sleep resulting in an episode of sleep
paralysis. Sleep paralysis has been suggested to be a dissociated
state,
featuring
both
REM
and
waking
type
brain
activity
[42,50,86e88], though see [89]. Understanding how and why this
unique state of consciousness arises is an important topic for future
research, not only because it will further our understanding of sleep
paralysis, but also because heightened levels of awareness during
REM sleep have been suggested as a potential way of studying the
emergence of consciousness [90e92].
A large body of research has now been conducted into variables
associated with the frequency and intensity of sleep paralysis epi-
sodes. Despite a number of limitations, these studies have made an
important contribution to our understanding of this unusual, but
relatively common, condition. It has been shown that sleep paral-
ysis is highly prevalent in PTSD and anxiety disorders and there are
a number of associated variables in the general population. There is
now a tremendous opportunity to expand and improve on this
literature, to further our understanding of the origins of, and
treatment options for, sleep paralysis experiences.

Practice points
� Sleep paralysis should be considered by clinicians when
diagnosing sleep disorders, especially in narcolepsy and
those exhibiting symptoms of insomnia.
� Sleep paralysis should be assessed more frequently in
certain psychiatric groups, particularly those presenting
with PTSD and anxiety disorders.
� Clinicians working with patients who experience severe
episodes of sleep paralysis should consider the patient's
mental and physical health and also the quality of their
sleep as possible related factors.
� It is important to consider the level of clinical distress in
patients presenting with severe cases of sleep paralysis.
Research agenda
� Reliable and valid measures of sleep paralysis, including
distinctions in hallucinatory content and clinical out-
comes, should be developed and routinely used, and
would be useful in dissociating possible distinctions be-
tween and predictors of a) fearful sleep paralysis and b)
blissful sleep paralysis.
� Longitudinal designs are required to better tease apart the
direction of causation of effects between sleep paralysis
and other variables.
� Further laboratory work should be conducted to improve
our understanding of the neurophysiology of sleep pa-
ralysis episodes.
� Randomised controlled trials with adequate sample sizes
of potential treatment options (both psychological and
pharmacological) for severe episodes of sleep paralysis.
