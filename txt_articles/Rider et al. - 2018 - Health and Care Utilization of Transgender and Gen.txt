BACKGROUND: Transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) adolescents have difficulty 
accessing and receiving health care compared with cisgender youth, yet research is limited 
by a reliance on small and nonrepresentative samples. This study's purpose was to examine 
mental and physical health characteristics and care utilization between youth who are 
TGNC and cisgender and across perceived gender expressions within the TGNC sample.
METHODS: Data came from the 2016 Minnesota Student Survey, which consisted of 80 929 
students in ninth and 11th grade (n = 2168 TGNC, 2.7%). Students self-reported gender 
identity, perceived gender expression, 4 health status measures, and 3 care utilization 
measures. Chi-squares and multiple analysis of covariance tests (controlling for 
demographic covariates) were used to compare groups.
RESULTS: We found that students who are TGNC reported significantly poorer health, lower 
rates of preventive health checkups, and more nurse office visits than cisgender youth. For 
example, 62.1% of youth who are TGNC reported their general health as poor, fair, or good 
versus very good or excellent, compared with 33.1% of cisgender youth (χ2 = 763.7,  
P < .001). Among the TGNC sample, those whose gender presentation was perceived as very 
congruent with their birth-assigned sex were less likely to report poorer health and long-
term mental health problems compared with those with other gender presentations.
CONCLUSIONS: Health care utilization differs between TGNC versus cisgender youth and across 
gender presentations within TGNC youth. With our results, we suggest that health care 
providers should screen for health risks and identify barriers to care for TGNC youth while 
promoting and bolstering wellness within this community.

What’s KnOWn On thIs subject: Transgender and 
gender nonconforming (TGNC) adolescents are significantly 
affected by mental health disparities and have difficulty 
accessing and receiving health care compared with 
cisgender youth. Previous research in this field is limited by 
reliance on small, nonrepresentative, and adult samples.
What thIs stuDy aDDs: TGNC adolescents reported 
poorer health, fewer health checkups, and more nurse 
visits than their cisgender peers. TGNC adolescents whose 
gender expression strongly matched their birth-assigned 
sex had better health and fewer long-term mental health 
problems compared with other gender presentations.

 Youth who are transgender have a 
gender identity and/or expression 
differing from societal expectations 
based on their birth-assigned sex, 
whereas youth who are cisgender 
have a gender identity aligning with 
their birth-assigned sex. Gender 
nonconforming describes individuals 
whose gender expression does not 
follow stereotypical conventions 
of masculinity and femininity and 
who may or may not identify as 
transgender.1 Although research 
on youth who are transgender and 
gender nonconforming (TGNC) is 
in its nascence, studies indicate 
that adolescents who identify as 
TGNC versus cisgender experience 
significant mental health disparities.2 
Additional studies are needed to 
better understand other health risks, 
disparities, and access to health care 
among youth who are TGNC.
A paucity of health research examines 
TGNC adolescents’ perceived 
gender expression (ie, the way 
others interpret a person’s gender 
presentation along a spectrum 
from feminine to masculine). The 
authors of the gender minority 
stress and resilience model3 theorize 
that misperceptions of a person’s 
gender expression may result in a 
young individual feeling as if their 
gendered experience is negated or 
not affirmed. The young individual 
may also be placed at an elevated risk 
for harassment and victimization, 
which in turn may contribute to a 
heightened risk for negative health 
outcomes, such as depressive 
symptoms, self-harm, posttraumatic 
stress, disordered eating, and 
suicidal ideation and attempts.4 
– 
9 
For example, Roberts et al10 found 
that youth who reported childhood 
gender nonconformity were at 
heightened risk for depressive 
symptoms during adolescence and 
early adulthood compared with 
those reporting childhood gender 
conformity. Birth-assigned males 
who reported childhood gender 
nonconformity were at the greatest 
risk for bullying victimization and 
depressive symptoms.
This vulnerability for poorer health 
outcomes reveals the importance 
of access to affordable, competent 
health care services for youth who 
are TGNC. However, historical 
marginalization in health care 
settings and a lack of competent 
providers create barriers to 
treatment and contribute to delayed 
access to care and longer-term health 
consequences.11 
– 
18 For example, 
Gordon et al19 found that gender 
nonconformity was associated with 
an increased risk for problems with 
mobility, usual activities, pain or 
discomfort, anxiety, and depression. 
Health scores were lower for 
participants with moderate gender 
conformity and lowest for those 
with low gender conformity when 
compared with participants reporting 
high gender conformity. Given the 
limited research on perceived gender 
nonconformity and health outcomes, 
Wylie et al20 emphasized the 
importance of assessing perceived 
gender expression as a determinant 
of health disparities, particularly in 
population-based studies.
Previously, researchers have most 
often dichotomized gender into 
binary categories (exclusively 
masculine [man or boy] or feminine 
[woman or girl], 
13 which minimizes 
the complexity of TGNC identities.21 
In a recent study, researchers found 
that 41% of a Canadian TGNC sample 
identified as gender nonbinary 
(ie, identifying as both, neither, or 
somewhere between masculine 
and feminine), which illustrates 
the importance of investigating the 
heterogeneity of gender identities 
and expressions among this group.22 
Health researchers who do not 
incorporate options to indicate 
nonbinary gender identities and 
expressions are at risk for having 
categories that misclassify or exclude 
certain gender diverse participants.21 
This categorical invisibility and 
erasure of diverse gender identities 
and expressions contribute to a 
lack of knowledge and training for 
health care providers and thereby 
place youth who are TGNC at risk 
for poorer health outcomes. In 
the current study, we address 
these concerns and illuminate 
health-related disparities in this 
underserved youth population.
Limitations in the extant research 
include reliance on samples of 
adults, 
2 convenience samples, and 
small sample sizes. Population-
based studies with large samples of 
adolescents are needed to generalize 
findings and make accurate 
comparisons between gender identity 
groups (TGNC versus cisgender). Our 
purpose in this study was to examine 
the prevalence of mental and physical 
health concerns and health care 
utilization among youth who identify 
as TGNC versus cisgender and across 
perceived gender expressions within 
our TGNC sample, using a large-scale, 
population-based sample.
MethODs
Data source and study Design
Data are from the Minnesota 
Student Survey (MSS), a statewide 
surveillance system coordinated 
by the Departments of Education, 
Health, Human Services, and Public 
Safety that is used to assess health 
and well-being among select grades 
of public school students. In 2016, 
85% of the state’s school districts 
participated. Passive parental 
consent procedures were used in 
accordance with federal laws. The 
analytic sample was composed of 
80 929 students in ninth and 11th 
grade who were asked about their 
gender identity. The University 
of Minnesota’s Institutional 
Review Board determined that 
this secondary analysis of existing 
anonymous data was exempt from 
review.

 survey Measures
Gender identity was assessed by using 
a modified version of the validated 
2-item approach recommended by 
transgender health experts.23 
– 
26 
Birth-assigned sex was assessed 
by the question, “What is your 
biological sex?” (male or female), 
followed by gender identity: “Do 
you consider yourself transgender, 
genderqueer, genderfluid, or unsure 
about your gender identity?” (yes or 
no). Adolescents who provided an 
affirmative response to the gender 
identity measure comprised the TGNC 
group. Perceived gender expression 
was measured by combining 2 items 
validated with young adults20 to 
create the following item: “A person’s 
appearance, style, dress, or the way 
they walk or talk may affect how 
people describe them. How do you 
think other people at school would 
describe you?” (response options: 
very or mostly feminine, somewhat 
feminine, equally feminine and 
masculine, somewhat masculine, or 
very or mostly masculine).
Dependent variables included health 
status (general health, long-term 
physical health problems, long-
term mental health problems, and 
staying home sick from school) and 
care utilization (nurse office visits 
and preventive medical and dental 
checkups). A description of these 
measures is presented in Table 1. 
Notably, response options for general 
health were dichotomized into “very 
good or excellent” versus “poor, 
fair, or good” because of a skewed 
distribution. 
Demographics and personal 
characteristics included 4 variables. 
Students were asked their grade 
and to endorse 1 or more of 5 racial 
groups and whether they self-
identified with a Hispanic ethnicity. 
Responses were combined to create 
a race and/or ethnicity variable 
(Hispanic or Latino; American Indian 
or Alaskan Native [non-Hispanic]; 
Asian [non-Hispanic]; Black, African, 
or African American [non-Hispanic]; 
Native Hawaiian or other Pacific 
Islander [non-Hispanic]; White [non-
Hispanic]; and multiple race [non-
Hispanic]). An indicator of poverty 
included whether students received 
free or reduced-price lunch at school. 
School location was coded as within 
or outside the 7-county Minneapolis 
and St. Paul metropolitan area.
Data analysis
Analyses were conducted by 
using IBM SPSS version 23 (IBM 
Corporation, Armonk, NY). First, 
χ2 tests were used to compare 
demographic characteristics, health 
status, and care utilization measures 
between students who are TGNC 
and cisgender. A 2-sided significance 
level of .001 was selected to reduce 
type I error rate because of the 
large sample. Second, multiple 
analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) 
models were used to estimate least 
squares means of the 4 health status 
variables simultaneously and then 
the 3 care utilization variables 
simultaneously for TGNC students by 
their perceived gender expression 
while controlling for grade, free 
or reduced-price lunch, race and/
or ethnicity, and school location. 
Pillai’s trace value statistic was used 
to assess the significant effects of 
perceived gender expression and 
control variables on the dependent 
variables. For dichotomous 
dependent variables, adjusted least 
squares means can be interpreted 
as predicted probabilities. Analyses 
were conducted separately for birth-
assigned male and birth-assigned 
female adolescents who are TGNC 
by using an α level of .05. Bonferroni 
tests were used to correct α for 
all post hoc comparisons between 
perceived gender expression groups.

 and 78 761 (97.3%) students who 
identified as cisgender. As shown in 
 
Table 2, the TGNC sample included a 
higher proportion of those assigned 
female at birth, youth of color, and 
those receiving free or reduced-price 
lunch than the cisgender sample. 
No significant differences emerged 
between students in metropolitan 
versus nonmetropolitan locations.
health statuses and care utilization 
between adolescents Who are tGnc 
Versus cisgender
Almost two-thirds (62.1%) of youth 
who are TGNC reported their general 
health as poor, fair, or good as 
opposed to very good or excellent, 
which is nearly twice the rate among 
youth who identify as cisgender 
(33.1%, P < .001; Table 3). Over half 
(59.3%) of youth who are TGNC also 
endorsed having long-term mental 
health problems compared with 
17.4% of cisgender youth (P < .001). 
Over half (51.5%) of youth who are 
TGNC reported staying home from 
school because of illness at least once 
in the past month (versus 42.6% 
of youth who are cisgender; P < 
.001). Youth who are TGNC visited 
the nurse’s office more often and 
reported lower rates of preventive 
medical and dental checkups during 
the last year than their cisgender 
peers.
health status and care utilization 
by birth-assigned sex and Perceived 
Gender expression
Perceived gender expression among 
youth who are TGNC is shown in 
 
Table 4. We found that youth who 
are TGNC varied across perceived 
gender expressions. Notably, the 
prevalence of TGNC adolescents 
with an equally feminine and 
masculine perceived gender 
expression was highest for both 
those assigned male (29.3%) and 
assigned female (41.2%) at birth 
compared with other perceived 
gender presentations. In Table 5, 
we present predicted probabilities 
and pairwise comparisons for youth 
who are TGNC by perceived gender 
expression, stratified by birth-
assigned sex. As indicated by Pillai’s 
trace, there was a significant effect 
of perceived gender expression for 
students who are TGNC and assigned 
male at birth on health status 
measures (P < .001) after controlling 
for covariates. Statistically 
significant differences between at 
least 2 groups on general health and 
long-term mental health problems 
were indicated in our results.

 Pairwise comparisons revealed that 
participants perceived as equally 
feminine or masculine (49.2%) or 
somewhat masculine (57.5%) were 
significantly more likely to report

For adolescents who are TGNC and

participants assigned female with 
a very feminine perceived gender

DIscussIOn
Population-based research in 
which both binary and nonbinary 
gender categories are examined is 
essential for a more comprehensive 
understanding of health disparities 
and health care needs of adolescents 
who are TGNC.13 In this study, we 
address research gaps related to 
health status and care utilization of 
youth who are TGNC by describing a 
variety of physical and mental health 
indicators in a large, population-
based sample of adolescents and 
identifying perceived gender 
expression as an important factor in 
understanding health disparities for 
this understudied group.
We found that students who 
are TGNC reported significantly 
poorer health status, lower rates 
of preventive health checkups, and 
more visits to the nurse’s office than 
their cisgender peers. Although youth 
who are TGNC reported an overall 
worse health status compared with 
their cisgender peers, nearly three-
quarters of youth who are TGNC did 
not experience long-term physical 
disabilities or health problems, which 
is consistent with previous findings 
that this group typically does not 
struggle with chronic physical health 
concerns.2 Over half of adolescents 
who are TGNC have received 
preventive medical and dental care; 
these rates are slightly lower than 
those reported previously, but with 
this information, we can continue to 
highlight the importance of health 
care providers addressing health risk 
while promoting wellness within this 
community.29, 
 
30
Among the TGNC sample, important 
differences emerged across perceived 
gender expressions by birth-assigned 
sex. Youth who are TGNC with 
perceived gender expressions that 
are incongruent or that somewhat 
deviate from societal expectations 
for their birth-assigned sex were 
at higher risk for poorer health 
outcomes. This is not surprising 
given the social pressures to conform 
to gender roles and stereotypes 
associated with one’s birth-assigned 
sex and is consistent with previous 
studies.10 Comparisons between 
perceived gender expression groups 
were not significantly different for 
any care utilization measure.
School nurses are uniquely 
positioned to promote, educate, 
and advocate for optimal health 
for students who are TGNC. For 
example, school nurses can promote 
antibullying policies and clubs such 
as Gay-Straight Alliances to improve 
school climate.31, 
 
32 School nurses 
can assist adolescents by providing 
resources and information about 
gender identity and expression. 
When appropriate, school nurses 
can also discuss with parents of 
self-disclosing adolescents who 
are seeking support that family 
support is protective and rejection 
is potentially detrimental to health. 
In addition, nurses can assist with 
health promotion by referring to 
appropriate resources.32

 Consistent with gender minority 
and resilience theory, individuals 
perceived as gender nonconforming 
may be vulnerable to discrimination 
and have difficulty accessing and 
receiving health care compared 
with their cisgender peers.14, 
 
29, 
 
30, 
 
33 
Perceived gender nonconformity may 
be a risk factor for minority stressors 
(eg, nonaffirmation, victimization, 
discrimination, or rejection), which 
may in turn elevate adverse health 
outcomes for these youth.3, 
 
13 Youth 
who are perceived or identify as 
gender nonconforming or nonbinary 
must also overcome unique barriers 
to accessing affirming health 
care compared with other TGNC 
adolescents, such as mistrust of 
health care providers because of fear 
of the youth’s own gender identity or 
expression being misunderstood.34, 
 
35  
These barriers contribute to delays 
in seeking services, which may 
result in poorer health outcomes. 
More research with a focus on 
differences across gender identities 
and expressions is needed to better 
understand associations contributing 
to health risk disparities among 
youth who are TGNC.
To our knowledge, this is the 
first large, population-based 
study of TGNC adolescents in 
the United States conducted to 
describe prevalence rates of 
health status and care utilization 
compared with cisgender youth 
and to explore perceived gender 
expression. Because of the census-
like recruitment strategy in which 
all schools in the state were 
invited to participate, findings are 
more generalizable than results 
from previous studies in which 
convenience samples were used. The 
numerous measures of health status 
(including both mental and physical 
health) and care utilization are 
considerable strengths of the survey, 
with which we address a gap in the 
literature for youth who are TGNC.

In these analyses, we controlled for free and/or reduced-price lunch, race and/or ethnicity, grade, and school location. α 
level set at .05. Post hoc tests used Bonferroni's correction to adjust α for all pairwise comparisons. Numbers do not sum 
to the sample size because of missing data on at least 1 variable.
a Post hoc analysis indicated significant differences between equally feminine and masculine and very masculine perceived 
gender expressions as well as somewhat masculine and very masculine perceived gender expressions.
b Post hoc analysis indicated significant differences between somewhat feminine and very feminine perceived gender 
expressions, equally feminine and masculine and very feminine perceived gender expressions, as well as somewhat 
masculine and very feminine perceived gender expressions.
c Post hoc analysis indicated significant differences between very masculine and all other perceived gender expression 
groups.
d Post hoc analysis indicated significant differences between very feminine and all other perceived gender expression 
groups.

Downloaded from 
 for youth who are TGNC is provided 
in our results, it is important to 
note limitations. First, asking about 
biological sex may be confusing for 
some students more accustomed to 
the phrase “sex assigned at birth, 
”  
which is commonly used in this 
population. Likewise, the measure 
of gender identity does not allow 
for differentiation of students who 
identify as transgender, genderqueer, 
or unsure. We were also unable 
to assess whether youth were 
interested in being perceived as 
a different gender, had received 
any gender-affirming medical 
interventions (ie, puberty blockers, 
gender-affirming hormones), or 
had socially transitioned to their 
affirmed gender, which may impact 
how their gender expression is 
perceived and how they feel about 
particular perceptions of their 
gender. Furthermore, we lack a 
measure of actual gender expression 
(ie, how youth perceive and present 
themselves in society through 
dress, mannerisms, and personal 
style). Instead, students were asked 
about how they think others at 
school perceive them, which might 
be interpreted as a question more 
reflective of gender affirmation 
than personal gender expression 
and/or presentation. Missing data 
(whether due to nonresponse or 
missed opportunities because of 
school absence) may result in an 
underestimation of TGNC identity 
and health status. Lastly, youth who 
are TGNC often use the bathroom in 
the nurse’s office36; thus, students 
may have overreported the frequency 
of nurse office visits.
cOnclusIOns
Health status and care utilization 
differ between youth who are 
TGNC versus cisgender and across 
perceived gender presentations. With 
our results, we suggest that health 
care providers should screen for 
health risks and identify barriers to 
care for youth who are TGNC while 
promoting and bolstering wellness 
within this community. Although 
youth who are TGNC generally 
appear healthy and many are using 
health care services, continued 
research and advocacy are needed 
to decrease barriers to care and 
improve health outcomes for these 
young people, particularly those 
whose perceived gender expressions 
transgress societal expectations. As 
such, it is important that providers 
develop competency to work with 
adolescents with diverse gender 
identities and expressions because 
health needs may differ across and 
within gender groups.
