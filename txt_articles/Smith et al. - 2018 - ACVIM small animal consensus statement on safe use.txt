Consensus Statements of the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) provide the veterinary community with uptodate informa-
tion on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of clinically important animal diseases. The ACVIM Board of Regents oversees selection of
relevant topics, identification of panel members with the expertise to draft the statements, and other aspects of assuring the integrity of the process.
The statements are derived from evidencebased medicine whenever possible and the panel offers interpretive comments when such evidence is
inadequate or contradictory. A draft is prepared by the panel, followed by solicitation of input by the ACVIM membership which may be incorpo-
rated into the statement. It is then submitted to the Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine, where it is edited prior to publication. The authors are
solely responsible for the content of the statements.

The purpose of this report is to offer a consensus opinion of ACVIM oncology diplomates and
technicians on the safe use of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics in veterinary practice. The focus is on
minimizing harm to the personnel exposed to the drugs: veterinary practitioners, veterinary techni-
cians, veterinary staff, and pet owners. The safety of the patient receiving these drugs is also of
paramount importance, but is not addressed in this statement. Much of the information presented
is based on national recommendations by Occupational Safety and Health Administration, National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, United States Pharmacopeia, and other published
regulations. These directives reflect an abundance of caution to minimize exposure to medical per-
sonnel, but large-scale studies about the consequences of long-term occupational exposure are
not available in veterinary medicine. Challenges in the delivery of optimal treatment safely and
economically to veterinary patients in general practice without access to a veterinary oncologist or
other specialist, because of costs or proximity, remain.

 daily or every-other-day small molecule inhibitor treatment also
increases the risk of exposure to clients.
Handling of cytotoxic drugs has been classified as an occupational
health hazard according to a National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health (NIOSH) alert, first published in 2004 and most recently
updated in 2016.4 Such drugs are carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic,
abortifacient, and increase the risk of stillbirth.5–8 Some of this information
has been derived from in vitro studies, animal studies, and from studies in
pregnant women receiving chemotherapy for their own malignancies, but
adverse effects still might be seen at lower levels of exposure. Compared
to intermittent high-dose exposure, chronic low levels of cytotoxic chem-
otherapy exposure actually may have increased risk, because cytotoxic
effects are less likely to occur with similar mutagenic effects.9 Veterinary
small molecule inhibitors, although often not considered “classical” chemo-
therapy agents, carry similar risks, according to package inserts (https://
www.zoetisus.com/products/dogs/palladia/index.aspx).
Current
targets
are associated with angiogenesis, and treatment with these agents could
harm a growing fetus. They should be handled as other cytotoxic drugs.
Human healthcare workers (eg, pharmacy employees, nurses) han-
dling chemotherapeutics have been found to have variably increased
chromosomal aberrations compared to the general population,9–16 as
well as urinary excretion of these drugs or their metabolites,17,18 which
could lead to similar reproductive complications found in cancer
patients treated with cytotoxic drugs.19–23 In fact, some large studies5
and a meta-analysis24 have shown an incremental increased risk of
infertility and early pregnancy loss with occupational exposure to che-
motherapeutics. Chromosome changes appear to be exposure- and
drug-dependent, with high-volume practice and alkylators being associ-
ated with the most abnormalities.10 Additionally, the chance of devel-
oping some cancers might be increased.21,23,25 As a caveat, most of the
studies included in the meta-analysis were performed before the wide-
spread use of closed-system transfer devices (CSTD). Various methods
used to detect abnormalities, lifestyle factors, amount of exposure to
cytotoxic drugs, and variable use of safety measures impact the useful-
ness of these studies in attributing causation to these health risks. The
addition of protective measures such as biologic safety cabinets (BSCs),
CSTDs, and personal protective equipment (PPE) markedly decreases,
but does not always eliminate, evidence of drug contamination.16,26,27
In veterinary medicine, several studies have been performed to
investigate occupational risk in reproductive outcomes and cancer devel-
opment. However, chemotherapy use and exposure have not been spe-
cifically investigated related to these outcomes. A 1998 study of 3000
female veterinary graduates showed both a decreased risk of preterm
delivery and a decreased risk for small-for-gestational age births com-
pared to the general population.28 In a review of several studies examin-
ing the cause of death in veterinarians, an increased risk was found for
the development of multiple myeloma (6 cases out of 12 000), and a
decreased risk for lung cancer, but overall there was a similar risk of can-
cer as in the general population and no conclusion about specific occupa-
tional exposures could be made.29 Reportedly, 71% of veterinary
practices in the United Kingdom use cytotoxic drugs, indicating that prac-
titioners do need to be aware of the use of protective procedures when
using chemotherapeutics.30 In a 2009 survey of 93 practices in
Hampshire,31 half of which used cytotoxic drugs, 100% reported compli-
ance with staff training, exclusion of pregnant workers, waste manage-
ment, and instructions to clients about precautions. However, none had a
designated BSC, and only 82% used PPE. In a survey of Canadian veteri-
nary practice, 30% of general practitioners and 22% of academic veteri-
narians reported using chemotherapeutics.32 Mixed or small animal
practitioners made up 91% of the private practice population and equine
practitioners 8.6%. In 8% of general practice veterinarians, accidental
exposures to cytotoxic drugs were reported. Academic veterinarians
using chemotherapeutics were mostly small animal or mixed practitioners
(47%), although a larger proportion of equine veterinarians using chemo-
therapeutics was found in academia (35%). No accidental exposures were
reported in this population. In the Netherlands, a 2006 study found fre-
quent contamination of the veterinary practice environment, including
gloves of personnel administering chemotherapy, surfaces of preparation
and administration areas, floors, and door handles.33 In a review of an
American veterinary teaching hospital in 2010, surface contamination
was found in 10% of swabs within the preparation area only, and 60%-
70% compliance with safety procedures regarding the use of PPE was
reported.34
The risk to clients while caring for their pets with cancer or administer-
ing cytotoxic drugs also is poorly defined. Some contamination of the envi-
ronment, and potential exposure to family members or caregivers occurs
when people are receiving chemotherapy.33,35 Guidelines for safe handling
of PO chemotherapeutics in human practice have been compiled, attempt-
ing to limit potential harms.36 In veterinary medicine, some environmental
contamination also has been documented,37 and similar precautions
should be taken by clients handling veterinary cancer patients undergoing
chemotherapy and administering drugs at home to their pets.38,39
Because chemotherapy drugs usually have a low therapeutic index,
inappropriate administration increases risks of exposure to personnel,
as well as the risk of adverse events for the patient. Evaluation and
suggestions in this regard are beyond the scope of this consensus
statement, but some guidelines have been included that also impact
the safety of those administering drugs. The European consensus state-
ment on chemotherapy use recommends that these drugs should have
proven efficacy before administration, recognizing that most are used
in an off-label fashion. Acknowledging that practitioners other than
oncologists do administer these drugs, at a minimum, consultation with
a veterinary oncologist to determine the risks versus benefits to the
patient is strongly recommended. The reader is referred to the follow-
ing resources regarding patient safety:

| FEDERAL AND STATE GUIDELINES
Several states now mandate that veterinary hospitals comply with
NIOSH guidelines40 regarding hazardous drugs (HD). The first was the
state of Washington in April 2011, closely followed by California in
2013 and North Carolina in 2014. The United States Pharmacopeia
(USP) has updated guidelines (Chapter 800) that are scheduled to be
implemented in 2019.

| EXPOSURE RISKS: GUIDELINES FOR
MITIGATION
Exposure to cytotoxic drugs can occur at many time points. For staff,
risks occur during handling, preparation, and administration of the drugs.
Pet owners risk exposure when they administer PO medications at
home and also when they are exposed to secretions and excreta from
their pets. These latter exposure events also are risks to veterinary staff
when patients are hospitalized after their treatments or admitted for
treatment of adverse events. The routes of exposure include skin con-
tact, skin absorption, inhalation of aerosols or drug particles, ingestion,
and needle stick injuries.41 The guidelines below are currently recom-
mended practices, but they are being continually revised.
4
| PERSONNEL TRAINING
In human hospitals, the rate of compliance with chemotherapy safety
guidelines varies from 68% to 80%. The attitude of oncology nurses to
preventative measures is altered by their education and their belief in
the risks posed.42,43 Reasons cited for lack of use of PPE include: they
are not comfortable, they were forgotten because of work pressures,
and they were not believed to be necessary.44 Complacency occurs
with PO medications because people do not perceive them to be as
toxic as parenteral medications.45 Additional concerns in veterinary
medicine include increased client costs and the perception that safety
practices can decrease efficiency. Although there are costs associated
with using appropriate safety equipment, their use does not impede
workflow and educated veterinary technical staff are willing to use pro-
tective practices.46 All of the aforementioned obstacles should be con-
sidered and addressed during training.
Only trained personnel should handle and administer chemothera-
peutics, and training should be documented in staff personnel files and,
for owners, in the medical records of the patients being treated, before
the handling of any HD. A safety officer should be designated in each
facility, with responsibility for training, documentation, and continual
review (at least every 6 months) and updating manuals as needed
when new guidelines become available.
Written policies and procedures for the safe handling of HD
must be in place in any facility in which HD are handled.47 A key
element of the safety program is the availability of Safety Data Sheets
(SDS, formerly called Material Safety Data Sheets [MSDS]). The
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines
state that healthcare facilities in which HD are used must provide
worker training, adequately label HD, and provide access to SDS for
all HD used in the hospital. The updated Hazard Communication
System requires that SDS will have a new common format and con-
tain standardized information, such as proper handling, protective
equipment to be used, steps to take in case of spills, first aid meas-
ures, and toxicological information (eg, routes and symptoms of expo-
sure). Drug insert information sheets for every anti-neoplastic agent
used in the hospital should be collected into a binder and kept avail-
able for review by staff.
All employees must be trained on the proper care and use of PPE
and spill kits.47 Workers should be trained to wear proper PPE during
HD receiving, storage, preparation, administration, disposal, and in
cleaning up waste from patients that have received HD.
PPE Recommendations for preparation, administration, spill and
waste management, and inventory management
Proper use of CSTD to ensure containment of HD during com-
pounding and administration and methods of preventing aerosol forma-
tion and spread of contamination should be taught. Employees must
also understand proper methods of drug transportation within the facil-
ity. Policies and procedures regarding drug spills should be established,
and employees should understand how to recognize and manage a spill.
Large spills should be handled by workers who are trained in handling

 HD. Cleaning protocols, the appropriate cleaning products, and proper
waste containers for disposing of HD should be available.
Medical management programs should be in place for workers
who handle or may be exposed to HD. Training should occur at the
time of hiring. At a minimum, employees should be encouraged to
come forward with any concerns and should notify their supervisors if
they are actively attempting to become pregnant, are pregnant, are lac-
tating, or have a health issue that requires they consider alternative
duties on the advice of their physician. Documentation of the amount
of drug handling per shift can serve as a surrogate of potential drug
exposure, and can be maintained in the employee’s file if questions
arise.48 Workers who have health changes or substantial contact with
HD, such as cleaning up a large spill, skin or eye contact, or a needle
stick should have follow-up reviews after consultation with their
physician.40
HD safety skills
5
| ALTERNATIVE DUTY
There currently is no recommended exposure limit for HD, and the
safe level of exposure cannot be determined. Workers who are preg-
nant, breastfeeding, or attempting to conceive or father a child
should avoid exposure or decrease exposure to as low a level as rea-
sonably practicable. They should not assist in preparation or admin-
istration of HD, nor should they handle patients or clean cages or
runs of patients that have received chemotherapy. These workers
should be offered alternative duties if they choose not to work with
cytotoxic agents. Employees’ physicians should be involved in mak-
ing the determination of whether or not to work with HD. The
greatest time of risk is during the first trimester, and women may
not be aware of pregnancy during this time. Clear guidelines on
decreasing occupational exposure to all staff at all times are a critical
component of chemotherapy safety for unborn children. It is the
responsibility of the employee to alert management if she is preg-
nant or if she is trying to conceive.
6
| ENVIRONMENT
The environment in chemotherapy safety should be set up so as to
limit direct exposure to HD and decrease the risk of indirect exposure
by contaminated packaging, poor handling technique, and spills. The
risk of exposure starts when HD are delivered to the facility. These
drugs should be labeled as HD at entry to the facility to ensure that
appropriate safety measures are followed. In testing of vials and pack-
aging of cytotoxic drugs at arrival from the manufacturer, surface con-
tamination is common, ranging from 0% to 100% of vials tested.49–51
In 1 study, no contamination of vials had occurred when they arrived
from the distributor, but frequent contamination of vials that had been
stored in the pharmacy was identified, with a presumption of cross
contamination from the preparation areas.49 In areas receiving chemo-
therapy agents, such as a central supply facility, staff should, at a mini-
mum, handle incoming drugs from suppliers with chemotherapy-rated
gloves to prevent exposure from broken vials. Staff should be trained
in how to manage spills and broken vials.
Storage should be carried out according to labeled recommenda-
tions (eg, refrigerated, room temperature, light-sensitive). The HD
should be stored in a separate, labeled area. Refrigerated items should
be stored in a dedicated, labeled refrigerator that is not used to store
food or other drugs. In addition, areas in which HD are stored or pre-
pared must be designated and clearly marked with appropriate signage.
Eating, drinking, smoking, chewing gum, using tobacco, applying cos-
metics, or storing food or drinks must be prohibited in areas in which
HD are stored, prepared, or used.40 Warning signs should be posted
during preparation and administration to alert other personnel of the
potential hazard of entering the area(s). The storage, preparation, and
administration areas should include surfaces that are easily cleaned and
decontaminated. Carpet and upholstery should be avoided. Work
surfaces in preparation areas often are found to have traces of drugs
present.49,51 Contamination varies with the type of equipment used in
the preparation procedures. Some studies have shown similar levels of
contamination within the oncology wards of human hospitals as seen
in HD preparation areas.49
All HD should be prepared and administered in a controlled area
where access is limited to authorized personnel trained in chemother-
apy procedures. Ideally, preparation and administration would occur in
a negative-pressure room. Positive pressure rooms (such as surgical
suites) should be avoided because of the potential spread of airborne
contamination. The preparation and administration areas should be
clutter-free and contain only necessary items and supplies. All needed
supplies should be gathered before drug preparation and administration
to minimize exiting and re-entering the work area(s). Whenever possi-
ble, tasks associated with preparation and administration should be
coordinated to maximize efficiency and minimize worker exposure.
Chemotherapeutic agents should be prepared using primary engi-
neering control, such as a BSC or compounding aseptic containment
isolator. Employees must be trained on the proper use of these devices.
Characteristics of ideal BSCs include: vertical laminar flow, which car-
ries contaminated air away from the operator (horizontal flow only pro-
tects the drug and not the worker); High-efficiency particulate

 arrestance filter; 100% ventilation to the outside; and, a continuously
running fan. Current recommendations also allow for class II type A
BSC with 30% recirculation. All BSC should be serviced and recertified
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Use of a BSC does
not prevent contamination within the cabinet, and use of proper tech-
nique when working within the hood and following appropriate clean-
ing procedures are essential.40,47
Use of a CSTD is recommended during preparation and adminis-
tration of chemotherapeutic drugs. A CSTD mechanically prevents the
escape of a drug or vapor out of the system into the environment. A
CSTD also should decrease the risk of needle accidents during adminis-
tration. The typical device includes an adaptor for the drug vial, a piece
that attaches to a luerlock syringe (needleless system), and adaptors to
allow connection of the needleless syringe to the fluid lines. The risk of
aerosolization is highest during transfer of the drug from the vial to
syringe and from the syringe into a fluid line. A CSTD will decrease
aerosolization of a parenteral drug during preparation and administra-
tion and prevent accidents during administration. Multiple studies have
shown a decrease in environmental contamination with the use of
CSTD.52–59 A CSTD is not a substitute for the use of PPE or prepara-
tion in a ventilated cabinet.40,47,60
Many commercially available devices limit surface contamination
during preparation and administration of chemotherapy agents. These
devices take time to learn how to use properly and efficiently. Clini-
cians and technicians should acquaint themselves with a product by
proper instruction. Once a degree of competency with the system has
been reached, any of these devices appear to provide protection
against contamination and accidents without slowing or hindering staff.
Considerations that should be taken into account when choosing the
appropriate device for a practice include: level of protection, ease of
use, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, and cost.

| PREPARATION AND TRANSPORT OF
CHEMOTHERAPY DRUGS
Only personnel trained in the handling of HD and proper technique
should prepare chemotherapy drugs. Orders and prescriptions should
be independently calculated and verified by at least 2 separate individ-
uals, but ideally including the prescribing clinician, a second person
trained in handling HD, and the worker responsible for preparation.
Full PPE should be worn during preparation. A plastic-backed absorb-
ent pad should be placed under the preparation site, and should be
replaced at least once daily, or anytime a spill occurs or the pad is con-
taminated. Only supplies essential to drug preparation should be placed
in the BSC to avoid disrupting the efficiency of the BSC. Critical
operations should be done at least 3 inches above the work surface.
Splitting, opening, or crushing tablets or capsules should never occur.
Fluid bags should be spiked and tubing should be primed with a com-
patible fluid before adding HD.
Outer gloves should be removed before final preparation and
surface decontamination. The outside of the container should be wiped
with gauze moistened with a deactivating substance before removal
from the BSC. The work surface area in the BSC should be decontami-
nated and disinfected. A fresh pair of outer gloves should be donned
before removing the product from the BSC. The final product should
be clearly labeled as cytotoxic and sealed in a plastic bag that allows
visualization of the product, then placed into the transport bag or
plastic box. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated contamina-
tion of the bags in which doses prepared for an individual patient are
delivered, but bags to be used for transport should never be placed in
the BSC to avoid inadvertent contamination of the outer surface of the
bag. Gloves and PPE should be removed in such a manner as to avoid
environmental contamination, and materials should be disposed of in
an appropriate waste container. Transport of HD should occur by hand
in a secondary container that allows clear visualization of the product.
The worker responsible for transportation should, at a minimum, wear
chemotherapy-rated gloves.
8
| DECONTAMINATION
Written protocols and supplies for cleaning should be available and
readily accessible, and only trained staff should be involved in cleaning.
A spill kit and hazardous waste container should be readily accessible
in chemotherapy receiving, preparation, and administration areas, as
well as in holding areas for patients receiving chemotherapy. Cleaning
supplies used in the chemotherapy area should not be used in non-
chemotherapy areas. Dedicated mops, buckets, and cleaning supplies
should be identified and used. All surfaces associated with HD handling
should be considered contaminated. All equipment, counters, and work
surfaces should be cleaned with a deactivating agent and cleaning
agent at the start of the day, before and after each activity, and at the
end of the work shift.
Because no universal cleaner exists for all chemotherapy drugs,
and no specific wipe-down procedures have been studied, no proven
decontamination procedures exist. Most commonly used cleaning
agents contain some form of detergent and hypochlorite solution.
However, strong detergent and water may remove most drug residues
when the directions as indicated on the container are followed. Repeti-
tion should provide increased effectiveness of decontamination. The
use of alcohol for primary disinfection will not deactivate HD and may
result in spread of contamination, although a final alcohol wipe is some-
times used to prevent corrosion of stainless steel surfaces. Directly
spraying a surface is not recommended, because of the risk of aerosoli-
zation. Gauze, wipes, or paper towels should be sprayed directly, and
then used to wipe the surface. Sprayers or pressure washers should
not be used for initial cleaning of cages, kennels, or stalls used for hous-
ing patients treated with HD.

| SPILL MANAGEMENT
Spills must be contained and cleaned immediately, according to the
extent of the spill. Cleaning always should proceed from areas of lesser
contamination to those of greater contamination. One trained person
should manage the spill by use of a properly maintained and easily
accessible spill kit that includes: appropriate PPE; sufficient supplies to
absorb a spill of 1000 mL; absorbent, plastic-backed sheets or pads;
disposable toweling; at least 2 sealable, thick plastic, pre-labeled haz-
ardous waste disposal bags; a disposable scoop for collecting glass frag-
ments; and, a puncture-resistant container for glass fragments. Steps
for managing a spill include: donning PPE, placing broken vials or other
waste into a sealable bag, and absorbing liquid into absorbent pad or
cleaning dry spills by wetting disposable toweling to limit creation of
dust. The used bag and other supplies should be disposed of in a haz-
ardous chemical waste container according to Environmental Protec-
tion Agency/Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (EPA/RCRA)
regulations (https://www.epa.gov/rcra/resource-conservation-and-recov-
ery-act-rcra-regulations#haz). The spill zone should be cleaned and disin-
fected after proper cleaning procedure. The PPE then should be removed
and disposed of in the hazardous chemical waste container. Hands should
be washed.
The spill should be documented by those involved in clean-up
including: drug name; approximate volume spilled; how the spill
occurred; spill management procedures; and, names of personnel,
patients, and any others exposed to the spill. Documentation of expo-
sures should be placed in the affected persons’ personnel files. An anal-
ysis of the incident should prompt procedures to prevent recurrence.
10
| DISPOSAL
The EPA has been granted authority to enforce regulations set forth by
the RCRA, which tracks hazardous waste from generation to disposal.
The OSHA and ASHP recommend that hazardous waste be disposed
of in a manner similar to that required for RCRA (https://www.epa.gov/
rcra/resource-conservation-and-recovery-act-rcra-regulations#haz).
All
hazardous waste should be disposed of and stored separately from reg-
ular waste and according to federal, state, and local regulations. Trace
wastes (<3% of original quantity) should be disposed of in chemother-
apy waste containers (yellow in the United States). Waste containers
should be clearly labeled, leak-proof, and covered with a foot-pedal
operated lid to minimize respiratory exposure and contamination.
Puncture-proof containers are needed for sharp or breakable items.
Waste disposal should be carried out by licensed commercial waste dis-
posal companies.
11
| CHEMOTHERAPY ADMINISTRATION
Safe administration of chemotherapy to veterinary patients requires a
non-disrupted environment and cooperative behavior of the animal. If
safe administration cannot be guaranteed, use of chemical restraint, or
the decision not to treat an animal, is at the discretion of the
prescribing clinician. Chemotherapy should be administered by 2
trained persons. The use of PPE is required. Work should be performed
below eye level to minimize the potential for personnel contamination.
Chemotherapy drugs given PO should be intact; tablets should
never be crushed or split and capsules should not be opened. Intrale-
sional chemotherapy likely carries a high risk for environmental and
personnel exposure, and additional precautions to prevent contamina-
tion such as a larger disposable administration pad for the table, clean-
ing the treated area on the patient afterwards and potentially covering
it may be needed, depending on the amount of leakage that occurs. A
full face shield is recommended. For injectable chemotherapy, an IV
catheter should be placed in a suitable vein by experienced personnel.
Catheter placement must be obtained by a “clean stick” to minimize
the potential for extravasation and possible personnel exposure. The
smallest gauge and shortest length of catheter to accommodate ther-
apy should be used. Heparinized saline should never be used to irrigate
lines or catheters because of possible precipitation of some chemother-
apy agents and the potential for more extravasation risk because of
local bleeding. An IV pump should be avoided where practical to pre-
vent increased pressure on veins, decrease the risk of extravasation,
and decrease the risk of disconnection and spills. The person restrain-
ing the patient should monitor the administration site for potential
extravasation, and verify patency of the vein throughout administra-
tion. A syringe or infusion pump is acceptable for non-HD administra-
tion, such as monoclonal antibodies or bisphosphonates, and for long-
duration infusions such as continuous rate infusion (CRI) of cytosine
arabinoside and dacarbazine. Frequent observation of the patient to
confirm patency and connection of the catheter is essential in this set-
ting. Dedicated syringe and infusion pumps for chemotherapy adminis-
tration should be stored in a dedicated chemotherapy administration
area and not utilized for non-cytotoxic drug administration.
Before administration, the HD should be examined for leakage
while it is contained in the transport bag. The patient’s identification
should be verified, as well as the drug name and dosage. If the HD
appears intact and the dose correct, it may be removed from the trans-
port bag. A plastic-backed absorbent pad should be placed under the
administration area to absorb leaks and prevent drug contact with the
patient’s skin. The transport bag may be used as a containment bag for
materials contaminated during administration.
After administration, the IV catheter should be removed with lines
and tubing intact. The outer glove then should be removed, inside-out,
with the IV catheter contained inside the glove. Administration materi-
als should be properly disposed of and decontamination procedures
followed. Gowns should not be worn longer than 3 hours to prevent
permeation, and then should be removed and discarded after use, or
earlier when soiled. Gloves should be discarded after each use and
hands washed.47

| MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS
The duration of excretion of cytotoxic drugs has not been established
for most drugs in veterinary patients. Drug might be expected to be

 found in urine, feces, saliva, vomitus, and sebum. In the studies that
have been performed, detectable concentrations of drug have been
found in the urine for days to weeks after administration, although con-
centrations are markedly decreased within 3 days.38,61–63 Many drugs
also are eliminated in the feces, and differences in PO bioavailability
may result in drug excretion for 5–7 days post-administration.38,47 The
true level of risk from exposure to excreted products is not known.
Information also is limited regarding the exposure of staff and owners
after intralesional injection of drugs or electrochemotherapy treat-
ments. Metabolites of HD also potentially retain cytotoxic attributes
and, in most studies, these have not been measured or assessed. The
default position should be to handle excreta from patients that have
received injectable chemotherapy as contaminated for a minimum of
48–72 hours post-administration, and perhaps as long as 7 days after
PO chemotherapy.

The number of personnel interacting with the patient should be
minimized, and only trained personnel should handle patients or be
involved in cleaning patient areas. Excreta from patients that have
received chemotherapy should be handled with the same PPE as used
for spills. At a minimum, safety glasses with side shields and
chemotherapy-rated double gloves for cleaning and decontaminating
work should be worn. Face shields should be used if splashing is possi-
ble. Gloves also should be chemically resistant to the decontamination
or cleaning agent. Hands should be washed with soap and water after
removing the gloves. Disposable towels should be used to clean ken-
nels and excreta if possible, and materials should be double-bagged for
disposal. All materials that have been in contact with the animal during
the period of risk should be considered potentially contaminated and
appropriate PPE should be worn when these materials are handled.
Dedicated cages, kennels, or stalls in a low-traffic area should be
used for animals undergoing treatment with HD. All materials that
might come into contact with the patient or bodily fluids should be dis-
posable or easily cleaned. Metal or disposable bowls for food and water
and disposable bedding should be used. Cages and runs should be
labeled with a laminated, cleanable sign that includes verbiage indicat-
ing that the patient has received chemotherapy, the name of the drug
administered, the major route of excretion, and the number of days
PPE is recommended. Ideally, color-coded disposable collars should be
used to identify animals recently treated with chemotherapy drugs.38
The patient should be allowed to urinate and defecate outside in a
separate, designated, low-traffic area, if possible. Because ultraviolet
light is believed to inactivate many drugs,64,65 an area with sunshine
exposure or an area that can be cleaned easily is recommended. Feces
can be removed from the area by personnel wearing chemotherapy-
rated gloves and disposed of as hazardous waste. Hands should be
washed after handling excreta. Urine can be diluted with water from a
low-flow hose or watering can.
13
| CLIENT SAFETY
When patients are discharged after chemotherapy administration, or
HD are prescribed for clients to administer, written discharge instruc-
tions should include information about safe handling of the pet. Clients
who are pregnant, attempting to conceive, or lactating should not be
tasked with drug administration or cleaning of any patient excreta. Cli-
ent consultation with their personal physician is recommended before
initiating treatment to discuss any potential contact risks. The presence
of small children in the home also should prompt a frank conversation
about potential exposure to HD. Handling of pets after chemotherapy
administration should be with caution; a pet’s interaction with children
in the home should be supervised, avoiding contact with excreta, and
with thorough hand washing afterwards. If inadvertent direct contact
with HD or contaminated urine or feces of a patient occurs, the skin
should be rinsed with water and washed using dishwashing detergent
for a minimum of 5 minutes, in accordance with recommendations for
chemical
exposure
(https://ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/firstaid.
html), and any additional instructions from a personal physician
followed.
Chemotherapy-rated gloves should be dispensed with any HD for
use by the client when giving medications, and hands should be
washed after each administration. The pet’s medications should not be
stored with medications for humans, near food, or where accessible by
children. Child-proof containers are recommended if there are small
children in the home. Pills should not be split or crushed, capsules
should not be opened, and swallowing of medications by the pet
should be confirmed. Compounding of liquid medications should be
discouraged, because of the potential for environmental contamination
during administration. If a pet commonly spits out a pill after it has
been concealed in food or a treat, the medication should be adminis-
tered alone. Empty vials or syringes should be returned to the clinic for
proper disposal.
Animals receiving chemotherapy should remain in a controlled
environment and not be allowed to urinate or defecate in community
areas, areas where children may be exposed, or areas that cannot be
easily cleaned for at least 48 hours after drug administration. Ideally a
low-traffic, sunlit area would be preferred for elimination. If excreta are
found in the house, the area should be cleaned, and hands should be
washed afterwards.
Recommendations for cleaning excreta include wearing gloves,
avoiding high-pressure sprays, and using disposable towels. Solid items
should be removed with gloved hands and double-bagged with
910 |

 impermeable disposable bags for household wastes. Liquid wastes
should be blotted dry. The area should be cleaned with dilute bleach
once gross contamination is removed. Cat litter boxes should be
cleaned daily and litter should be double-bagged and discarded with
household trash. Any soft items (eg, bedding, towels, toys) should be
washed twice, separately from other laundry, after exposure, and
ideally bleached.33,66

| CHALLENGES
Currently, approximately 350 veterinary oncologists are listed on the
ACVIM website, not all of whom are actively practicing. They are pri-
marily concentrated in urban, high-population areas or at veterinary
teaching hospitals. Many states have only 1 location with an oncologist
available, and a few states have no oncologists within their borders.
Although other specialists also administer chemotherapy, most are
found in similar locations. Primary care veterinary practitioners often
are requested by clients to administer chemotherapy to pets, either
because of the perceived costs of specialty care or the time commit-
ment and inconvenience in traveling to a specialty center. Suggestions
(other than referral to a specialist) for these practitioners are to collabo-
rate with a hospital pharmacy, create a group that can purchase appro-
priate safety equipment, or contract a company that can provide
individual doses of chemotherapy drugs. Providing optimal patient care
for our pets with cancer while also providing optimal safety for those
people handling HD is a fine balance. The only known safe level of
exposure to these drugs is none, and little information is available
about increased risk to people who infrequently administer HD. Stricter
mandates may limit the number of pets that can receive cancer
treatment.
15
| COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The committee encourages the formation of a central resource for vet-
erinarians regarding chemotherapy use. Creation of standardized train-
ing materials, including slide sets, webinars, suggested documentation
of personnel training in practice, and client and staff informational liter-
ature would be extremely helpful for practices that use chemotherapy
drugs. Studies that evaluate risks in veterinary healthcare workers who
handle chemotherapy drugs, especially information about levels of
exposure, would help inform recommendations in practice. Further
investigation of the risks to clients who own animals receiving chemo-
therapy also are needed.
