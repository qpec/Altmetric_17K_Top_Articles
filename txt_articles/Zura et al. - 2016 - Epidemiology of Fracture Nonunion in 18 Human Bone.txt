IMPORTANCE Failure of bone fracture healing occurs in 5% to 10% of all patients. Nonunion
risk is associated with the severity of injury and with the surgical treatment technique, yet
progression to nonunion is not fully explained by these risk factors.
OBJECTIVE To test a hypothesis that fracture characteristics and patient-related risk factors
assessable by the clinician at patient presentation can indicate the probability of fracture
nonunion.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS An inception cohort study in a large payer database of
patients with fracture in the United States was conducted using patient-level health claims for
medical and drug expenses compiled for approximately 90.1 million patients in calendar year
2011. The final database collated demographic descriptors, treatment procedures as per
Current Procedural Terminology codes; comorbidities as per International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision codes; and drug prescriptions as per National Drug Code Directory
codes. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for variables associated
with nonunion. Data analysis was performed from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2012,
EXPOSURES Continuous enrollment in the database was required for 12 months after fracture
to allow sufficient time to capture a nonunion diagnosis.
RESULTS The final analysis of 309 330 fractures in 18 bones included 178 952 women
(57.9%); mean (SD) age was 44.48 (13.68) years. The nonunion rate was 4.9%. Elevated
nonunion risk was associated with severe fracture (eg, open fracture, multiple fractures), high
body mass index, smoking, and alcoholism. Women experienced more fractures, but men
were more prone to nonunion. The nonunion rate also varied with fracture location:
scaphoid, tibia plus fibula, and femur were most likely to be nonunion. The ORs for nonunion
fractures were significantly increased for risk factors, including number of fractures
(OR, 2.65; 95% CI, 2.34-2.99), use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs plus opioids (OR,
1.84; 95% CI, 1.73-1.95), operative treatment (OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.69-1.86), open fracture (OR,
1.66; 95% CI, 1.55-1.77), anticoagulant use (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.51-1.66), osteoarthritis with
rheumatoid arthritis (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.38-1.82), anticonvulsant use with benzodiazepines
(OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.36-1.62), opioid use (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.34-1.52), diabetes (OR, 1.40;
95% CI, 1.21-1.61), high-energy injury (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.27-1.49), anticonvulsant use (OR,
1.37; 95% CI, 1.31-1.43), osteoporosis (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.14-1.34), male gender (OR, 1.21; 95%
CI, 1.16-1.25), insulin use (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.10-1.31), smoking (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.14-1.26),
benzodiazepine use (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.10-1.31), obesity (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.12-1.25),
antibiotic use (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.13-1.21), osteoporosis medication use (OR, 1.17; 95% CI,
1.08-1.26), vitamin D deficiency (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.05-1.22), diuretic use (OR, 1.13; 95% CI,
1.07-1.18), and renal insufficiency (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.17) (multivariate P < .001 for all).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The probability of fracture nonunion can be based on
patient-specific risk factors at presentation. Risk of nonunion is a function of fracture severity,
fracture location, disease comorbidity, and medication use.

 T
he rate of fracture nonunion is estimated to be be-
tween 5%1 and 10%,2 and the rate of nonunion may be
increasing as the survival rate for patients with severe
injuries improves.3 The risk of nonunion is related to the se-
verity of injury resulting in fracture,4 and many randomized
clinical trials5 have shown that variations in nonunion rates
areassociatedwithdifferentsurgicaltreatments.However,pro-
gression to nonunion is not fully explained by these factors
alone.6 Determination of the probability for and potential miti-
gation of nonunion risk is an important clinical objective be-
causepatientswithnonunioncanexpectmorelong-termpain,
physical disability, mental health problems, and medical treat-
ment costs as well as a slower return to normal work
productivity.7 Herein, we describe the epidemiology of frac-
ture nonunion in adults, with a focus on information avail-
able to the clinician at patient presentation. We hypothesize
that the interplay between a patientâ€™
s physiologic risk factors
and fracture characteristics increases the risk of fracture
nonunion.5 We tested this hypothesis in a large payer data-
base of patients with fracture in the United States.8
Methods
Database
Truven Health Analytics (Durham, North Carolina) compiled
patient-level health claims data for medical and drug
expenses, together with laboratory test results, hospital dis-
charge information, and death data on 90.1 million
patients.9 Data were submitted by hospitals, managed care
organizations, Medicare and Medicaid programs, and
approximately 300 large corporations in exchange for bench-
mark reports.9 This study was approved and exempted from
the need for informed consent by the institutional review
board of Duke University Medical Center because patient
data were deidentified.
The final database contained 1 row per unique fracture,
with comma-separated values for patient variables. Variables
included patient demographics, treatment procedures as per
the Current Procedural Terminology codes; disease comorbidi-
ties as per the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Re-
vision (ICD-9) codes; and drug prescriptions as per National
Drug Code Directory (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts
/cder/ndc/) codes.
Study Design
Study inclusion was limited to patients with a coded bone frac-
ture in calendar year 2011. Patients were excluded if they had
less than 12 months of continuous enrollment following frac-
ture so as to capture all coded nonunions.
Fractures were identified based on 5-digit ICD-9 codes.
Rule-out codes were not counted; such codes are used to or-
der radiography in some patients who may not have a frac-
ture. In addition, codes with an unspecified character string
in the definition were not used because such codes are re-
placed with a specific code defining the location of the frac-
ture. Nonunion was determined by the presence of either a
nonunion code or a code for prescription use of an electrical
bone stimulation device since such devices are used to treat
nonunion. Patients who used low-intensity pulsed ultra-
sound devices for a fresh fracture were excluded because this
prescription device may increase the healing rate for bone.
Disease comorbidities were identified using ICD-9 pri-
mary disease codes. Secondary conditions arising from a
chronic disease condition (eg, diabetic retinopathy) were not
used as proxies for the primary disease because of the risk of
double counting. Thus, our analysis would not identify pa-
tients with diabetes diagnosed before 2011, although medica-
tions used to treat diabetes would be captured. Medications
were identified using National Drug Code Directory codes,
which are for oral medications purchased in a retail phar-
macy. Such codes contain a range of medications; the opioid
class contains analgesics but can also contain opioid agonists
used to treat addiction. Medications were assumed to be part
of long-term therapy, with the exception of antibiotics, throm-
bolytics, analgesics, and corticosteroids.
Analysis focused on the cohort of patients aged 18 to 63
years at the time of the fracture. This age range was chosen
because skeletal maturity is achieved by approximately 18
years.10 Patients younger than 18 years were abundant in the
database, but their healing rate was high, so it was less com-
pelling to identify risk factors for those who failed to heal.
Patients older than 63 years were excluded because the
requirement for 12 months of continuous enrollment created
an artifact as patients transitioned to Medicare and no longer
appeared in the database. Older individuals were also
excluded because only some purchase Medicare supplemen-
tal coverage and thus are not representative of other Medi-
care patients.
Analytic Strategy
Ouroverallhypothesiswasthattheprobabilityoffracturenon-
union can be determined with the use of risk factors derived
from patient demographics, using Current Procedural Termi-
nology, ICD-9, and National Drug Code Directory codes. Pos-
sible risk factors for nonunion were identified in a literature
search,5 with a focus on risk factors likely to be of concern to
orthopedic surgeons. We requested information on 257 po-
tential nonunion risk factors, including fracture type, frac-
ture cause, patient demographics, and medication use. We fo-
cused on 18 bones most frequently fractured. An operative
Key Points
Question Which patient-specific risk factors other than injury
severity increase risk of nonunion of fractures?
Findings In an inception cohort study of a payer database in
which 309 330 fractures in 18 bones were analyzed, only 5
patient-specific risk factors significantly increased the risk of
nonunion more than 50% across all bones: multiple concurrent
fractures, prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and
opioid use, open fracture, anticoagulant use, and osteoarthritis
with rheumatoid arthritis.
Meaning The probability of fracture nonunion can be determined
from patient-specific risk factors at presentation.

 treatment variable was defined for patients who received any
fracture surgery and we compared them with patients who did
notundergosurgery.Statisticalanalyseswereperformedusing
SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). The critical value for sig-
nificance was set at P < .05.
Because so many variables were available for each pa-
tient, it was important to group variables into manageable cat-
egories. Ultimately, data were pooled to obtain 45 variables of
interest (eAppendix in the Supplement). For example, pa-
tientshadasmanyas15separatefractures,butwebinnedthem
into a smaller number of categories for analysis (eg, 1-2 frac-
tures, 3-5 fractures, and â‰¥6 fractures). Multivariate logistic re-
gression was used to control for correlations among the vari-
ous risk factors.
We did not adjust for multiple comparisons because
showing 95% CIs for each odds ratio (OR) achieves the same
end. Furthermore, an OR significant at P < .001 is comparable
to an OR significant at P = .05 that has been Bonferroni cor-
rected for 50 comparisons. Correcting for additional compari-
sons would be likely to lead to type II (false-negative) errors.
In an exploratory context such as this, P values should be
interpreted as a measure of statistical evidence rather than a
test of hypothesis.
Validation
In parallel to the logistic regression analysis, we also con-
ducted random forest decision tree modeling using the same
covariates.11 The random forest method is invariant to inter-
actionsandtermsofhigherdimension,suchasquadraticterms.
The random forest method generally performs better than re-
gression methods but, unlike regression analysis, is harder to
interpret. We compared the methods using the C statistic (area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and found
that the models were substantially equivalent; the C statistic
of the random forest model was only slightly larger than the
C statistic of the logistic regression model, differing in the third
or fourth decimal place. We elected to report only the main ef-
fects logistics regression model herein. Nonunion rates for in-
dividual bones were also compared with those in the litera-
ture. Data analysis was performed from January 1, 2011, to
December 31, 2012.
Results
A flowchart (eFigure in the Supplement) shows how the pa-
tient sample was assembled. There were 309 330 fractures in
patients ranging from 18 to 63 years (mean [SD], 44.48 [13.68]),
or approximately 6725 patients in each of the 46 age classes.
The overall nonunion rate was 4.9% (Table 1), with substan-
tial variation from bone to bone. The metatarsal was the most
frequently fractured bone, with a nonunion rate of 5.7%. The
lowest nonunion rates were for the metacarpal (1.5%) and ra-
dius (2.1%) bones. The highest nonunion rates were for the
scaphoid (15.5%), followed by the tibia and fibula (14%) and
femur (13.9%). These were the only bones for which the non-
unionratewasgreaterthan10%.If4.9%ofallpatientshadnon-
union fractures (Table 1), then there were approximately 330
nonunion patients per age class. This relatively small number
of nonunion fractures per age class could potentially result in
uncertainty in estimating nonunion rates as a function of age.
There were clear demographic differences between pa-
tients who healed and those who failed to heal (Table 1).
Women had more fractures, but men had a higher proportion
of nonunions. Open fractures represented 3.9% of all frac-
tures, but 10.9% of open fractures were nonunion and 4.7%
of closed fractures were nonunion. Multiple fractures were
more likely result in nonunion; nonunion frequency was 4.4%
in patients with 1 fracture but 24% among patients with 7 or
more fractures.

Multivariate evaluation of fractures associated with comor-
bidities(Table2)indicatedthat3riskfactors(osteoarthritis[OR,
1.45; 95% CI, 1.39-1.52], osteoarthritis with rheumatoid arthri-
tis [OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.38-1.82], and type 1 diabetes [OR, 1.40;
95% CI, 1.21-1.61]) increased the odds of nonunion by at least
40%.Oddsratiosforindividualnonunionriskfactorsweregen-
erally small, with 13 of 16 multivariate ORs less than 1.40
(Table 2). Two risk factors were inversely associated with non-
union (OR, <1): cardiovascular disease (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90-
0.98) and allergy (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.93) (Table 2). The
number of risk factors and the complex interactions possible
between risk factors may explain the absence of multivariate
ORs higher than 1.58 (Table 2).
Use of certain medications increased the nonunion risk
(Table 3). After controlling for confounding variables, the most
powerful risk factor was use of nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-
torydrugs(NSAIDs) and opioids(multivariateOR,1.84;95%CI,
1.73-1.95). Other pain medications, such as opioids alone, and
anticonvulsants, with or without benzodiazepines, were mod-
erately strong positive risk factors, whereas antidiabetics other
than insulin (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.99) and oral contracep-
tives (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.81-0.95) were inversely associated
with nonunion.
Nonunion ORs were significantly increased for many risk
factors (Table 4 and Table 5), including number of fractures
(OR, 2.65; 95% CI, 2.34-2.99), use of prescription analgesics
(NSAIDs and opioids; OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.73-1.95), operative
treatment(OR,1.78;95%CI,1.69-1.86),openfracture(OR,1.66;
95% CI, 1.55-1.77), anticoagulant use (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.51-
1.66), osteoarthritis with rheumatoid arthritis (OR, 1.58; 95%
CI, 1.38-1.82), anticonvulsant use with benzodiazepines (OR,
1.49; 95% CI, 1.36-1.62), opioid use (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.34-
1.52), type 1 diabetes (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.21-1.61), high-
energy injury (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.27-1.49), osteoporosis (1.24;
95% CI, 1.14-1.34), male gender (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.16-1.25), in-
sulin use (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.10-1.31), diagnosed smoking (OR,
1.20; 95% CI, 1.14-1.26), diagnosed obesity (OR, 1.19; 95% CI,
1.12-1.25), antibiotic use (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.13-1.21), osteopo-
rosis medication use (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.08-1.26), diagnosed
vitamin D deficiency (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.05-1.22), diuretic use
(OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.07-1.18), and renal insufficiency (OR, 1.11;
95% CI, 1.04-1.17) (all, multivariate P < .001).
Relativelyfewriskfactorsaffectedmultiplebones(Tables4
and 5). The need for operative treatment was associated with
nonunion in 15 bones, anticoagulant use was associated with
nonunion in 14 bones, use of analgesics (NSAIDs and opioids)
affected12bones,andosteoarthritisanduseofanticonvulsants
each affected 11 bones. Overall, the largest risk factor for non-
unionwasthenumberoffractures(OR,2.65;95%CI,2.34-2.99).
A limited number of putative risk factors were inversely
correlated with nonunion (Tables 4 and 5), including oral con-
traceptive use (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.81-0.95), allergy (OR, 0.90;
95%CI,0.86-0.93),andage(OR,0.97;95%CI,0.95-0.98);each
was apparently protective in at least 2 bones. Some bones have
several protective factors; both radius and ankle had 3 protec-
tive factors. A total of 12 bones had at least 1 protective factor.
Smoking was not identified as a major risk factor in this
study (Tables 4 and 5). However, our data included only diag-
nosed past or current smoking, which most reliably may mean
that someone was offered smoking cessation therapy. Thus,
our count of smokers is likely an underestimate. Only 10.2%
of patients were coded as past or current smokers (Table 1),
whereas 18% of the general population is expected to smoke12
and other nonunion cohort studies have reported a preva-
lence of smoking higher than the US average.13 Similarly, we

was analyzed, so many people with nonunion fractures may
have been obese but we have no record of it.
Lack of convergence of the model was a rare problem
(Tables4and5)exceptforcoagulants,whichappeartoberarely
used among patients with fractures (Table 3). The number of
patients with multiple scaphoid fractures may have been too
small to find a solution for nonunion associated with mul-
tiple fractures. Only 10 boneâ€“risk factor ORs other than co-
agulants could not be estimated.
Discussion
There were clear demographic differences between patients
whosefractureshealedandthosewhosefracturesfailedtoheal
(Table 1). Most risk factors conferred a relatively small in-
crease in multivariate nonunion risk (Table 2), perhaps be-
cause there are complex interactions between and among risk
factors. Use of certain medications was an important deter-
minant of nonunion (Table 3). Adjusting medication use by pa-
tients may enable physicians to improve the odds that a pa-
tient will heal. Nonunion rates varied among bones, and the
contributions of various risk factors showed a complex inter-
play (Tables 4 and 5). In general, nonunion rate appears to be
a function of fracture severity, fracture location, disease co-
morbidity, and medication use.
The distinction between univariate and multivariate ORs
is important. For example, type 2 diabetes was associated with
a univariate OR of 1.60 and a multivariate OR of 1.15 (Table 2).
If that diagnosis is the only information that a clinician has
about a patient, then it is reasonable to conclude that this pa-
tient has a 1.60-fold higher risk of nonunion than does a per-
son without type 2 diabetes. As other variables become known
and can be incorporated into a risk assessment, the risk asso-
ciated specifically with type 2 diabetes decreases. In a multi-
variateanalysis,whichcontrolsformanyotherfactors,thenon-
union risk associated with type 2 diabetes was 1.15-fold times
the risk of nonunion in a person without that disease (Table 2).
It is almost certainly the case that type 2 diabetes has not been
diagnosed and treatment has not been instituted in some pa-
tients; thus, the disease would not have been analyzed in this
study. Diabetes medications other than insulin appear to pro-
vide protection from nonunion (Tables 4 and 5), although the
mechanism of such a protective effect is not known. When
working with large patient databases (eg, big data), unantici-
pated associations are likely to be found. Causality cannot be
tested without using an experimental approach; therefore, big
data projects should be regarded as an opportunity for hypoth-
esis generation rather than hypothesis testing.
The overall nonunion rate that we report was 4.9%
(Table 1). This rate is somewhat lower than others reported in
the literature,1,2 although the healing rate for individual bones
aligns well with previously published information. For ex-
ample, the tibial nonunion rate we report was 7.4% for 12 808
fractures. The literature suggests that the expected non-
union rate for tibial fractures is 7.6%, a value derived by col-
lating the reported healing rate in 46 publications spanning the
period from 1976 to 2014 and including 5920 fractures treated

with a variety of conservative and operative methods.14-58 The
agreement between our database and the literature is striking
since both samples include many patients who received a wide
range of treatments.
Similarly, the nonunion rate we report for clavicle frac-
tures is 8.2% for 7414 fractures. Collation of literature on
clavicle fractures suggests that the expected nonunion rate is
8.6%. This percentage was derived from the reported healing
rate in 12 separate publications59-70 spanning the period from
2004 to 2013 and including 3168 patients treated with a range
ofconservativeandoperativemethods.Bothsamplesarelarge,
andthenonunionrateinourdatabaseagaindiffersbylessthan
a percentage point from the literature values.
Theoverallnonunionratewereport(4.9%)isslightlylower
than the 5% to 10% that reviews suggest,1,2 which may reflect
reporting bias. Clinicians generally report more often on frac-
tures that heal poorly.71 Metacarpal fractures heal with a non-
union rate of just 1.5% and have been reported only 226 times
intheliterature(perPubMedsearch,December21,2015:search
terms, bone fracture healing and metacarpal). Conversely, tibia
fractures have a nonunion rate of 7.4% and have been reported
2578 times in the literature (per PubMed search, December 21,
2015: search terms, bone fracture healing and tibia). Similarly,
femur fractures have a nonunion rate of 13.9% and have been
reported 2791 times in the literature (per PubMed search, De-
cember21,2015,searchterms,bonefracturehealingandfemur).
This research has several limitations. First, Truven Health
Analytics is a payer database that excludes unemployed or in-
digent patients who might have had a higher rate of nonunion.
Second, some diagnoses may have been coded incorrectly as
fracture if coding was performed before radiographic imaging.
However, this error is unlikely because rule-out codes were not
counted; such codes are used to order imaging if a fracture is
suspected.Third,somefracturesthatreceivedtreatmentin2011
could have occurred earlier. Fourth, uncoded patient data can-
notcontributetoconclusions.Dataweremorelikelytobemiss-
ing from the database if information was not crucial to reim-
bursement; smokers not receiving medication for smoking
cessation would likely not be coded as smokers. Nevertheless,
missing data are a problem in every study, including random-
ized clinical trials. Therefore, we used statistical methods, in-
cludingrandomforestanalysis,thatarerobustandresilientde-
spite missing data.11 Additional limitations are characteristic of
claims databases in general; there is imprecision in ICD-9 cod-
ing schemes,72 and coding errors are common but are as-
sumedtodistributerandomlyandtobeminimizedbytheneed
for accurate reporting for claims reimbursement and by legal
penalties for fraudulent reporting.73 Limitations do not appear
to be a substantial issue because the nonunion rates we report
are similar to others in the literature.
An important strength of this research is that it has con-
tributed novel insights into the cause of fracture nonunion. For
example, use of certain medications is a key risk factor for frac-
ture nonunion (Table 3). Because medication use is a modifi-
able risk factor, our findings suggest that clinicians could coun-
sel patients about use of medications. Other strengths of this
research are that all data were collected prospectively, the 12-
month follow-up time represents a longer follow-up interval

than used in most other published studies,5 and the out-
comes reported reflect real-world outcomes.
Conclusions
Fracture nonunion can result from the interplay of many
risk factors. Key risk factors include features of the fracture,
such as severity and location, as well as issues such as
comorbidities and use of certain medications. Fracture
severity, fracture location, comorbidity, and medication use
could be incorporated into an algorithm that would help cli-
nicians determine which fractures are at greatest risk of
nonunion. Medications have a significant effect on fracture
healing and can potentially be altered after fracture to
improve healing.
