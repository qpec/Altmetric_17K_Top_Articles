Summary
Background Major depressive disorder is one of the most common, burdensome, and costly psychiatric disorders 
worldwide in adults. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments are available; however, because of 
inadequate resources, antidepressants are used more frequently than psychological interventions. Prescription of 
these agents should be informed by the best available evidence. Therefore, we aimed to update and expand our previous 
work to compare and rank antidepressants for the acute treatment of adults with unipolar major depressive disorder.
Methods We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis. We searched Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS database, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, PsycINFO, the websites 
of regulatory agencies, and international registers for published and unpublished, double-blind, randomised 
controlled trials from their inception to Jan 8, 2016. We included placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials of 
21 antidepressants used for the acute treatment of adults (≥18 years old and of both sexes) with major depressive 
disorder diagnosed according to standard operationalised criteria. We excluded quasi-randomised trials and trials 
that were incomplete or included 20% or more of participants with bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, or 
treatment-resistant depression; or patients with a serious concomitant medical illness. We extracted data following a 
predefined hierarchy. In network meta-analysis, we used group-level data. We assessed the studies’ risk of bias in 
accordance to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and certainty of evidence using the 
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Primary outcomes were 
efficacy (response rate) and acceptability (treatment discontinuations due to any cause). We estimated summary 
odds ratios (ORs) using pairwise and network meta-analysis with random effects. This study is registered with 
PROSPERO, number CRD42012002291.
Findings We identified 28 552 citations and of these included 522 trials comprising 116 477 participants. In terms of 
efficacy, all antidepressants were more effective than placebo, with ORs ranging between 2·13 (95% credible interval 
[CrI] 1·89–2·41) for amitriptyline and 1·37 (1·16–1·63) for reboxetine. For acceptability, only agomelatine (OR 0·84, 
95% CrI 0·72–0·97) and fluoxetine (0·88, 0·80–0·96) were associated with fewer dropouts than placebo, whereas 
clomipramine was worse than placebo (1·30, 1·01–1·68). When all trials were considered, differences in ORs between 
antidepressants ranged from 1·15 to 1·55 for efficacy and from 0·64 to 0·83 for acceptability, with wide CrIs on most 
of the comparative analyses. In head-to-head studies, agomelatine, amitriptyline, escitalopram, mirtazapine, 
paroxetine, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine were more effective than other antidepressants (range of ORs 1·19–1·96), 
whereas fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, reboxetine, and trazodone were the least efficacious drugs (0·51–0·84). For 
acceptability, agomelatine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, and vortioxetine were more tolerable than 
other antidepressants (range of ORs 0·43–0·77), whereas amitriptyline, clomipramine, duloxetine, fluvoxamine, 
reboxetine, trazodone, and venlafaxine had the highest dropout rates (1·30–2·32). 46 (9%) of 522 trials were rated 
as high risk of bias, 380 (73%) trials as moderate, and 96 (18%) as low; and the certainty of evidence was moderate 
to very low.
Interpretation All antidepressants were more efficacious than placebo in adults with major depressive disorder. 
Smaller differences between active drugs were found when placebo-controlled trials were included in the analysis, 
whereas there was more variability in efficacy and acceptability in head-to-head trials. These results should serve 
evidence-based practice and inform patients, physicians, guideline developers, and policy makers on the relative 
merits of the different antidepressants.

Introduction
Psychiatric disorders account for 22·8% of the global 
burden of diseases.1 The leading cause of this disability 
is depression, which has substantially increased since 
1990, largely driven by population growth and ageing.2 
With an estimated 350 million people affected globally, 
the economic burden of depressive disorders in the 
USA alone has been estimated to be more than 
US$210 billion, with approximately 45% attributable to 
direct costs, 5% to suicide-related costs, and 50% to 
workplace costs.3 This trend poses a substantial 
challenge for health systems in both developed and 
developing countries, with the need to treat patients, 
optimise resources, and improve overall health care in 
mental health.
Grouped into various classes of drugs with slightly 
different mechanisms of action, antidepressants are 
widely used treatments for major depressive disorder, 
which are available worldwide. However, there is a long-
lasting debate and concern about their efficacy and 
effectiveness, because short-term benefits are, on 
average, modest; and because long-term balance of 
benefits and harms is often understudied.4 Therefore, 
innovation in psychopharmacology is of crucial 
importance, but the identification of new molecular 
targets is difficult, primarily because of the paucity of 
knowledge about how antidepressants work.5 In routine 
practice, clinicians have a wide choice of individual 
drugs and they need good evidence to make the 
best choice for each individual patient. Network 
meta-analyses of existing datasets make it possible to 
estimate comparative efficacy, summarise and interpret 
the wider picture of the evidence base, and to understand 
the relative merits of the multiple interventions.6 There-
fore, in this study, we aimed to do a systematic 
review and network meta-analysis to inform clinical 
practice by comparing different antidepressants for 
the acute treatment of adults with unipolar major 
depressive disorder.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis. 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS database, MEDLINE, 
MEDLINE In-Process, PsycINFO, AMED, the UK 
National Research Register, and PSYNDEX from the date 
of their inception to Jan 8, 2016, with no language 
restrictions. We used the search terms “depress*” OR 
“dysthymi*” OR “adjustment disorder*” OR “mood 
disorder*” OR “affective disorder” OR “affective 
symptoms” combined with a list of all included 
antidepressants.
We included double-blind, randomised controlled 
trials (RCTs) comparing antidepressants with placebo or 
another active antidepressant as oral monotherapy for the 
acute treatment of adults (≥18 years old and of both 
sexes) with a primary diagnosis of major depressive 
disorder accord 
ing to standard operationalised diagnostic 
criteria (Feighner criteria, Research Diagnostic Criteria, 
DSM-III, DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, DSM-5, and ICD-10). We 
considered only double-blind trials because we included 
placebo in the network meta-analysis, and because 
this study design increases methodological rigour by 
minimising performance and ascertainment biases.7 
Additionally, we included all second-generation anti-
depressants approved by the regulatory agencies in 
the USA, Europe, or Japan: agomelatine, bupropion, 
citalopram, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, escitalopram, 
fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, levomilnacipran, milnacipran, 
mirtazapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, 
vilazodone, and vortioxetine. To inform clinical practice 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Antidepressants are routinely used worldwide for the treatment 
of major depressive disorder, which is one of the most 
important global health challenges; however, in the scientific 
literature, there remains considerable debate about both their 
effectiveness as a group, and the potential differences in 
effectiveness and tolerability between individual drugs. With the 
marketing of new antidepressants and increasing numbers of 
trials published every year, an updated systematic review and 
network meta-analysis was required to synthesise the evidence 
in this important clinical area.
Added value of this study
This network meta-analysis represents a major update and 
extension of our previous study, which addressed 
12 anti 
depressants with data for head-to-head comparisons 
only, and provides the best currently available evidence base to 
guide the choice about pharmacological treatment for adults 
with acute major depressive disorder. We now include a more 
comprehensive list of 21 antidepressants and placebo, consider 
three new clinical outcome measures and many potential 
effect modifiers, and use the most advanced statistical 
methodology for network meta-analysis to date.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our findings should inform clinical guidelines and assist the 
shared decision making process between patients, carers, and 
clinicians in routine practice on selecting the most appropriate 
antidepressant for adults with acute major depressive 
disorder. Future research should seek to extend network 
meta-analysis to combine aggregate and individual-patient 
data from trials in a so-called individual-patient data network 
meta-analysis. This analysis will allow the prediction of 
personalised clinical outcomes, such as early response or 
specific side-effects, and the estimate of comparative efficacy 
at multiple timepoints.

globally, we selected the two tricyclics (amitriptyline and 
clomipramine) included in the WHO Model List of 
Essential Medicines). We also included trazodone and 
nefazodone, because of their distinct effect and tolerability 
profiles. Additionally, we included trials that allowed 
rescue medications so long as they were equally provided 
among the randomised groups. We included data only for 
drugs within the therapeutic range (appendix pp 133, 134). 
Finally, we excluded quasi-randomised trials and trials 
that were incomplete or included 20% or more of 
participants with bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, 
or treatment-resistant depression; or patients with a 
serious concomitant medical illness.
The electronic database searches were supplemented 
with manual searches for published, unpublished, and 
ongoing RCTs in international trial registers, websites 
of drug approval agencies, and key scientific journals in 
the field.8 For example, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov 
using the search term “major depressive disorder” 
combined with a list of all included antidepressants. 
We contacted all the pharmaceutical companies 
marketing anti 
depressants and asked for supplemental 
unpublished information about both premarketing 
and post-marketing studies, with a specific focus on 
second-generation antidepressants. We also contacted 
study authors and drug manufacturers to supplement 
incomplete reports of the original papers or provide 
data for unpublished studies.
Six pairs of investigators (ACi, TAF, LZA, SL, HGR, 
YO, NT, YH, EHT, HI, KS, and AT) independently 
selected the studies, reviewed the main reports and 
supplementary 
materials, 
extracted 
the 
relevant 
information from the included trials, and assessed the 
risk of bias. Any discrepancies were resolved by 
consensus and arbitration by a panel of investigators 
within the review team (ACi, TAF, LZA, EHT, and JRG).
The full protocol of this network meta-analysis has 
been published.8
Outcomes
Our primary outcomes were efficacy (response rate 
measured by the total number of patients who had a 
reduction of ≥50% of the total score on a standardised 
observer-rating scale for depression) and acceptability 
(treatment discontinuation measured by the proportion 
of patients who withdrew for any reason).8 All-cause 
discontinuation was used as a measure for the 
acceptability of treatments, because it encompasses 
efficacy and tolerability.9 Secondary outcomes were 
endpoint depression score, remission rate, and the 
proportion of patients who dropped out early because of 
adverse events. When depressive symptoms had been 
measured with more than one standardised rating scale, 
we used a predefined hierarchy, based on psychometric 
properties and consistency of use across included trials.8 
In the absence of information or supplemental data from 
the authors, response rate was calculated according to 
a validated imputation method.10 We recorded the 
outcomes as close to 8 weeks as possible for all analyses.9 
If information at 8 weeks was not available, we used data 
ranging between 4 and 12 weeks (we gave preference to 
the timepoint closest to 8 weeks; if equidistant, we took 
the longer outcome). We checked trial protocols where 
available and compared published with unpublished 
data. We extracted data following a predefined hierarchy 
described in our protocol and gave priority to unpublished 
information in case of disagreement.8
Data analysis
For studies published more than once (ie, duplicates), we 
included only the report with the most informative and 
complete data. Full details of the applied statistical 
approaches are provided in the protocol.8 We estimated 
summary odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes 
and standardised mean differences (SMD, Cohen’s d) for 
continuous outcomes using pairwise and network meta-
analysis. In network meta-analysis, we used group-level 
data; the binomial likelihood was used for dichotomous 
outcomes and the normal likelihood for continuous 
outcomes. The study effect sizes were then synthesised 
using a random-effects network meta-analysis model. We 
accounted for the correlations induced by multi-group 
studies by using multivariate distributions. The variance 
in the random-effects distribution (heterogeneity variance) 
was considered to measure the extent of across-study and 
within-comparison variability on treatment effects. 
Additionally, in network meta-analysis, we assumed that 
the amount of heterogeneity was the same for all treatment 
comparisons. To assess the amount of heterogeneity, we 
compared the posterior distribution of the estimated 
heterogeneity variance with its predictive distribution.11 To 
rank the treatments for each outcome, we used the surface 
under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) and the 
mean ranks.12 The transitivity assumption underlying 
network meta-analysis was evaluated by comparing the 
distribution of clinical and methodological variables that 
could act as effect modifiers across treatment com-
parisons.8 We did a statistical evaluation of consistency (ie, 
the agreement between direct and indirect evidence) 
using the design-by-treatment test13 and by separating 
direct evidence from indirect evidence.14
We assessed the studies’ risk of bias in accordance to 
the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of 
Interventions. Additionally, we assessed the certainty 
of evidence contributing to network estimates of the 
main outcomes with the Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) 
framework.15
We evaluated whether treatment effects for the 
two primary outcomes were robust in subgroup analyses 
and 
network 
meta-regression 
using 
study 
year, 
sponsorship, depressive severity at baseline, dosing 
schedule, study precision (ie, small study effect), and 
novelty effect.16 The appendix (pp 133–36) summarises

the definition of covariates. The sensitivity of our 
conclusions was evaluated by analysing the dataset with 
the following restrictions: studies with reported response 
rate, studies using accepted doses in all groups, studies 
with unpublished data, multi-centre studies, and 
head-to-head studies. We used comparison-adjusted 
funnel plots to investigate whether results in imprecise 
trials differ from those in more precise trials.17
We fitted all models in OpenBUGS (version 3.2.2)18 
using the binomial likelihood for dichotomous outcomes, 
uninformative prior distributions for the treatment effects, 
and a minimally informative prior distribution for the 
common heterogeneity SD. We assumed uninformative 
priors—ie, N(0,1000)—for all meta-regression coefficients. 
Convergence of models was ensured by visual inspection 
of three chains and after considering the Brooks–
Gelman–Rubin diagnostic. The codes of analyses, 
statistical details of the meta-analysis, and meta-regression 
models are presented in the appendix (pp 182, 183). 
Statistical evaluation of inconsistency and production of 
network graphs and result figures were done using 
the network and network graphs packages in Stata 
(version 14.2).19 Network meta-analyses of the primary 
outcomes were duplicated using the netmeta 0.9-6 package 
in R (version 3.4.0).20 The appendix (p 289) lists the changes 
to the original protocol. The study was done from 
March 12, 2012, to June 4, 2016, and data analysis was done 
from June 5, 2016, to Sept 18, 2017

Results
28 552 citations were identified by the search and 
680 potentially eligible articles were retrieved in full text 
(figure 1). We included 421 trials from the database search, 
86 unpublished studies from trial registries and 
pharmaceutical company websites, and 15 from personal 
communication or hand-searching other review articles. 
Overall, 522 double-blind, parallel, RCTs (comprising 
116 477 patients) done between 1979 and 2016, and 
comparing 21 antidepressants or placebo were included 
in the analysis (appendix pp 6–64). The appendix 
(pp 65–114) summarises the characteristics of included 
studies. The mean study sample size was 224 participants 
(SD 186). In total, 87 052 participants were randomly 
assigned to an active drug and 29 425 were randomly 
assigned to placebo. The mean age was 44 years (SD 9) for 
both men and women; 38 404 (62·3%) of 61 681 of the 
sample population were women. The median duration of 
the acute treatment was 8 weeks (IQR 6–8). 243 (47%) of 
522 studies randomly assigned participants to three 
or more groups, and 304 (58%) of 522 were placebo-
controlled trials. 391 (83%) of 472 were multi-centre 
studies and 335 (77%) of 437 studies recruited outpatients 
only. 252 (48%) of 522 trials recruited patients from North 
America, 37 (7%) from Asia, and 140 (27%) from Europe 
(59 [11%] trials were cross-continental and the remaining 
34 [7%] were either from other regions or did not specify). 
The great majority of patients had moderate-to-severe 
major depressive disorder, with a mean reported baseline 
severity score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 
17-item of 25·7 (SD 3·97) among 464 (89%) of 522 studies. 
Response rate was imputed in 20 608 (17·7%) of 
116 447 cases. Rescue medications (typically benzo-
diazepines or other sedative hypnotics) were allowed in 
187 (36%) of 522 studies. 409 (78%) of 522 studies were 
funded by pharmaceutical companies. We retrieved 
unpublished information for 274 (52%) of the included 
trials. Consistent with the study protocol, the primary 
analysis was based on the 474 studies (comprising 
106 966 patients) that used drugs within the licensed dose 
range (ie, the dosage approved by the regulatory agencies 
in the USA and Europe; appendix pp 133, 134).
Figure 2 shows the network of eligible comparisons for 
efficacy and acceptability. All antidepressant drugs, 
except milnacipran, had at least one placebo-controlled 
trial. Only levomilnacipran was not directly compared 
with at least another active drug in any of the networks. 
The appendix (pp 139–44) provides detailed results of 
pairwise meta-analyses. Figure 3 shows the network 
meta-analysis’ results for the primary outcomes. In terms 
of efficacy (432 RCTs, comprising 102 443 patients), all 
antidepressants were more effective than placebo, with 
ORs ranging between 2·13 (95% credible interval [CrI] 
1·89–2·41) for amitriptyline and 1·37 (1·16–1·63) for 
reboxetine. In terms of acceptability (422 RCTs, 
comprising 99 787 patients), agomelatine (OR 0·84, 
95% CrI 0·72–0·97) and fluoxetine (0·88, 0·80–0·96) 
were associated with fewer dropouts than placebo; 
by contrast, clomipramine was worse than placebo 
(1·30, 1·01–1·68).
The relative efficacy of antidepressants compared with 
placebo is also shown for remission (appendix 
pp 152, 153). The random-effects summary SMD for all 
antidepressants was 0·30 (95% CrI 0·26–0·34; p<0·0001; 
appendix pp 150, 151). In terms of dropouts due to 
adverse events, all active drugs were associated with 
higher withdrawal rates than placebo with ORs ranging

1361
between 1·64 and 4·44, and 95% CrI excluding the 
null, except agomelatine (OR 1·21, 95% CrI 0·94–1·56; 
appendix pp 154–55). For the full results of the secondary 
outcomes see the appendix (pp 150–55).
In the analysis of response rate, 8% of the loops were 
inconsistent (17 of 219 loops; p value of the design by 
treatment test was 0·063), and also 8% of the loops 
were inconsistent for dropouts (16 of 210 loops; p=0·219). 
The median heterogeneity variances were estimated 
at 0·044 (95% CrI 0·028–0·063) for response and 
0·040 (0·023–0·062) for dropout, suggesting moderate-
to-low heterogeneity. Subgroup meta-regression analyses 
revealed that the use of placebo in trials was the strongest 
explanation of heterogeneity and inconsistency in those 
evaluated. Exclusion of placebo-controlled trials resulted 
in a 24% relative reduction in heterogeneity variance for 
response and 45% for dropout. Additionally, we found 
that smaller and older studies presented larger effects 
of the active interventions versus placebo (in particular 
for amitriptyline, bupropion, fluoxetine, and reboxetine; 
appendix pp 182–96). The year of randomisation or study 
precision did not materially impact on the relative 
treatment effects between active interventions (appendix 
p 228). Overall, 46 (9%) of 522 trials were rated as high 
risk of bias, 380 (73%) trials as moderate, and 96 (18%) as 
low (appendix pp 115–32).
We also synthesised head-to-head studies separately to 
assess the differences between drugs. Figure 4 presents 
these data for the primary outcomes (194 studies

comprised 34 196 patients). Agomelatine, amitriptyline, 
escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, 
and vortioxetine were more effective than other 
antidepressants (ORs ranging between 1·19 and 1·96), 
whereas fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, reboxetine, and 
trazodone were among the least efficacious drugs 
(ORs ranging between 0·51 and 0·84). In terms of 
acceptability, agomelatine, citalopram, escitalopram, 
fluoxetine, sertraline, and vortioxetine were more 
tolerable than other anti 
depressants (ORs ranging 
between 0·43 and 0·77), whereas amitriptyline, 
clomipramine, duloxetine, fluvoxamine, reboxetine, 
trazodone, and venlafaxine were the antidepressants 
associated with the highest dropout rates (ORs ranging 
between 1·30 and 2·32). When all trials were considered, 
differences in ORs between antidepressants ranged 
from 1·15 to 1·55 for efficacy (appendix p 147) and 
from 0·64 to 0·83 for acceptability (appendix p 149), 
with wide CrIs on most of the comparative analyses. 
Figure 5 reports the two-dimensional graphs about 
efficacy and acceptability in all studies and head-to-head 
studies. Results for the secondary outcomes were in line 
with the findings for the primary outcomes (appendix 
pp 197–230). Within the head-to-head comparisons, 
when a treatment was the novel or experimental drug of 
comparison, it appeared to be significantly more 
effective than when that same treatment was the older 
or control drug of comparison (difference 1·18-times, 
95% CrI 1·09–1·27). Adjusting for this novelty effect 
diminished the differences between antidepressants.
We incorporated the GRADE judgments in figure 4. 
The certainty of evidence for the relative treatment 
effects of efficacy and acceptability varied; it was 
moderate for most of the comparisons involving 
agomelatine, escitalopram, citalopram, and mirtazapine, 
and low to very low for most comparisons involving 
vortioxetine, nefazadone, clomipramine, bupropion, 
and amitriptyline (appendix pp 231–65). The appendix 
(pp 266–85) presents the ranking of treatments based 
on cumulative probability plots and SUCRAs.
In accordance with the review protocol, we also did a 
sensitivity analysis, including all the studies that used 
the drugs within the accepted doses (ie, doses 
recommended in some international clinical guidelines; 
appendix pp 133, 134) and the results did not change 
substantially (appendix p 187).
Discussion
This study is based on 522 double-blind studies, 
which included 116 477 patients randomly assigned to 
21 individual first-generation and second-generation 
antidepressant drugs or placebo. The project extends 
our previous work that had addressed 12 antidepressants 
with data for head-to-head comparisons.9 The present 
analysis is substantially more comprehensive because it 
includes 21 active treatments and placebo. The much 
larger evidence base (about 117 000 vs 26 000 patients), 
obtained through exhaustive search for published and 
unpublished information, allowed us to investigate 
additional important outcomes, such as remission, 
change in mood symptoms and dropouts due to 
side-effects, and a number of methodological issues, 
such as sponsorship, dosing schedule, study precision, 
and novelty effect.16
We found that all antidepressants included in the meta-
analysis were more efficacious than placebo in adults 
with major depressive disorder and the summary effect 
sizes were mostly modest. Some antidepressants, such as

escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, agomelatine, and 
sertraline had a relatively higher response and lower 
dropout rate than the other antidepressants. By contrast, 
reboxetine, trazodone, and fluvoxamine were associated 
with generally inferior efficacy and acceptability profiles 
compared with the other antidepressants, making them 
less favourable options. To make our results as relevant 
and robust as possible to inform clinical practice, we 
decided to focus on head-to-head studies and at the same 
time emphasise the certainty of the retrieved evidence. 
Our assessment overall found few differences between 
antidepressants when all data were considered, while there 
was more diversity in the range of efficacy and dropout 
patterns seen across the head-to-head comparisons than 
the meta-analysis of antidepressants versus placebo.
The present findings in adults contrast with the efficacy 
of antidepressants in children and adolescents, for which 
fluoxetine is probably the only antidepressant that might 
reduce depressive symptoms.21 This differential efficacy 
across age groups might reflect heterogeneous mech-
anisms and causes of depression,22 smaller number of 
studies in young people, or different methodological issues 
affecting adult and paediatric trials.23 The effect sizes were 
also smaller in more recent and larger placebo-controlled 
trials than in older and smaller ones, which might be an 
indicator of bias.
Estimated differences between drugs were smaller in 
placebo-controlled trials than in head-to-head studies. 
There are several potential explanations, as many factors 
have been associated with higher placebo response rates, 
such as randomisation ratio and the expectation of 
receiving an active treatment, the therapeutic setting, or 
the frequency of study visits.24 In our dataset, we found that 
response to the same antidepressant was on average 
smaller and dropouts more likely to occur in placebo 
controlled trials than in head-to-head studies. Moreover, 
for the same drug and the same probability of receiving 
placebo, larger all-cause dropout rates were associated with 
a lower response to treatment. The use of the last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) approach for imputing 
missing outcome data might have affected the estimates 
of treatment effect.25 Depressive symptoms tend to 
spontaneously improve over time and this phenomenon 
contributes to the high percentage of placebo responders 
in antidepressant trials.26 Patients randomly assigned to 
the active drug in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 
might leave studies earlier than in head-to-head studies 
because they might suspect they have been allocated to 
the placebo group than to the intervention group. 
Antidepressants usually take full effect only after weeks of 
treatment; therefore, participants who dropped out earlier 
tend to have poorer responses than those who remain on 
treatment, which are carried forward to the end of the trial 
by the LOCF analysis. The final result can be an 
underestimate of the true efficacy of the active drug.
Another possible explanation could be a bias in conduct, 
analysis, or reporting of head-to-head trials, driven by

commercial interests.27 In our analyses, funding by 
industry was not associated with substantial differences in 
terms of response or dropout rates. However, non-industry 
funded trials were few and many trials did not report or 
disclose any funding. We also observed that drugs tended 
to show a better efficacy profile when they were novel and 
used as experimental treatments than when they had 
become old. This novelty effect might arise where a novel 
agent is perceived to be more effective and better tolerated; 
alternatively, selective analyses and outcome reporting 
bias might be more prominent when a treatment is 
first launched.16
Our literature search was as comprehensive as possible, 
including the largest amount of unpublished data to date, 
which are associated with less favourable effect sizes for 
antidepressants.28 Although it is possible that a certain 
amount of unpublished data could not be retrieved, our 
comparison-adjusted funnel plots did not suggest that 
small studies gave different results from larger studies 
either among placebo-controlled trials or head-to-head 
comparison trials (appendix pp 179–81, 225–27). The 
estimates of treatment effect from our study are in line 
with previous reviews on the same matter,28 but they are 
considerably more precise because of our larger quantity 
of data and resulting statistical power.
Our review has some limitations. According to the 
GRADE framework, the quality of many comparisons was 
assessed as low or very low for amitriptyline, bupropion, 
and venlafaxine, whereas it was often rated as moderate 
for agomelatine, escitalopram, and mirtazapine. We 
incorporated the certainty of evidence in the main results 
of our analysis to highlight the most robust findings for 
further use in clinical judgment. However, many trials did 
not report adequate information about randomisation and 
allocation concealment, which restricts the interpretation 
of these results. To increase the methodological rigour of 
the contributing evidence, we included only double-blind 
trials, which were generally very similar in design and 
Figure 4: Head-to-head comparisons for efficacy and acceptability of the 21 antidepressants
Drugs are reported in alphabetical order. Data are ORs (95% CrI) in the column-defining treatment compared with the row-defining treatment. For efficacy, ORs higher than 1 favour the 
column-defining treatment (ie, the first in alphabetical order). For acceptability, ORs lower than 1 favour the first drug in alphabetical order. To obtain ORs for comparisons in the opposite direction, 
reciprocals should be taken. Significant results are in bold and underscored. The certainty of the evidence (according to GRADE) was incorporated in this figure (appendix pp 231–65). OR=odds ratio.

conduct. The poor information in terms of risk of bias 
assessment might be a matter of reporting; however, we 
presented full details about the risk of bias of all included 
studies in the appendix (pp 115–32). We did not do a formal 
cost-effectiveness analysis. All of the most effective anti-
depressants are now off patent and available in generic 
form. Some of the antidepressants are included in the 
WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, which makes 
them available worldwide and ready to use also in 
developing countries.
We analysed only average treatment effects and were not 
able to investigate potentially important clinical and 
demographical modifiers of treatment response at the 
individual patient level (eg, age, sex, severity of symptoms, 
or duration of illness). Patients recruited in randomised 
trials tend to be highly selected and we also excluded 
patients with psychotic or treatment-resistant depression, 
which might limit the applicability of the results to these 
clinical subgroups, but it was intended as a methodological 
strength to assure transitivity in the network. We did 
not cover important clinical issues that might inform 
treatment decision making in routine clinical practice 
(eg, specific adverse events, withdrawal symptoms, or 
combination 
with 
non-pharmacological 
treatments). 
Additionally, because of the paucity of information 
reported in the original studies, we were not able to 
quantify some outcomes, such as global functioning. It 
should also be noted that some of the adverse effects of 
antidepressants occur over a prolonged period, meaning 
that positive results need to be taken with great caution, 
because the trials in this network meta-analysis were of 
short duration. The current report summarises evidence of 
differences between antidepressants when prescribed 
as an initial treatment. Given the modest effect sizes, 
non-response to antidepressants will occur. Our infor-
mation unfortunately cannot guide next-step choices after 
failure of such a first step (ie, they do not apply to treatment-
resistant depression), for which well performed trials 
are scarce.29
Using the data made available on the websites of the 
US Food and Drug Administration and European 
Medicines Agency, on the international trial registries, 
and from contacting study authors and pharmaceutical 
companies, we managed to incorporate in the analysis a 
considerable amount of unpublished data for some 
drugs—namely, agomelatine, escitalopram, paroxetine, 
reboxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, vilazodone, and vorti-
oxetine—but not for all the antidepressants included in 
the network meta-analysis. This limitation in the primary 
trials might affect the validity of the findings for some 
antidepressants, but the incorporation of both direct and 
indirect comparisons might have contributed to reduce 
the potential risk of bias.30 We did our best to retrieve 
all unpublished data and contacted study authors 
for supplemental material, but we are aware that a 
substantial amount of information is still not available to 
the public. There are online archives where trials are 
prospectively registered; however, they collect reliable 
information only about the most recent studies and we 
cannot rule out the possibility that some studies are 
absent or the same study has been counted twice in our 
analyses. It is not uncommon for the same study to 
go by different names in different publications, which 
complicates the process of data synthesis.31 By making 
the dataset fully and freely available, we welcome any

Data are reported as ORs in comparison with reboxetine, which is the reference drug. Error bars are 95% CrIs. 
Individual drugs are represented by different coloured nodes. Desvenlafaxine, levomilnacipran, and vilazodone 
were not included in the head-to-head analysis because these three antidepressants had only placebo-controlled 
trials. ORs=odds ratios. 1=agomelatine. 2=amitriptyline. 3=bupropion. 4=citalopram. 5=clomipramine.

information that might help clarify any mistakes in 
our dataset.
Notwithstanding these limitations, the findings from 
this network meta-analysis represent the most compre-
hensive currently available evidence base to guide the 
initial choice about pharmacological treatment for acute 
major depressive disorder in adults. All statements 
comparing the merits of one antidepressant with another 
must be tempered by the potential limitations of the 
methodology,32 
the 
complexity 
of 
specific 
patient 
populations, and the uncertainties that might result from 
choice of dose or treatment setting. We hope that these 
results will assist in shared decision making between 
patients, carers, and their clinicians.
