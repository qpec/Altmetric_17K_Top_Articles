ZIKV, a mosquito-borne flavivirus, has spread across the Western 
Hemisphere in the past year. First isolated in 1947 from a sentinel 
rhesus macaque in the Ziika Forest region of Uganda1, ZIKV remained 
in relative obscurity for many years until outbreaks occurred in the 
Pacific islands and then in the Americas in the past decade. A large 
outbreak started in Brazil in late 2014, and it is a growing public health 
concern2. Active transmission has been reported in approximately 60 
countries and territories globally. Most human infections are transmit-
ted by mosquitos; however, ZIKV can also spread directly through 
sexual contact3–6 and vertically from mother to fetus7–9. About 20% 
of ZIKV-infected individuals develop symptoms, which mostly 
resemble those caused by other arboviruses, such as dengue viruses 
or chikungunya virus. Unlike these viruses, however, ZIKV causes 
congenital defects, including microcephaly10,11, and is associated 
with Guillain–Barré syndrome, meningoencephalitis and myelitis in 
infected adults8,11–14.
Since the recent declaration by the World Health Organization 
(WHO) that ZIKV is a global health concern, rapid progress has been 
made to understand its pathogenesis and to develop human in vitro 
models and animal in vivo models15–23. Following clinical observations 
of ZIKV in fetal brains obtained from infected women9,10, we reported 
that ZIKV efficiently targets human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) and 
attenuates their growth15. This finding provides a potential mechanism 
for ZIKV-induced microcephaly as hNPCs drive the development of 
the cortex in the human brain. Furthermore, we and others have shown 
that ZIKV infection of brain organoids, which are used as three-dimen-

In response to the current global health emergency posed by the Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak and its link to 
microcephaly and other neurological conditions, we performed a drug repurposing screen of ~6,000 compounds 
that included approved drugs, clinical trial drug candidates and pharmacologically active compounds; we identified 
compounds that either inhibit ZIKV infection or suppress infection-induced caspase-3 activity in different neural 
cells. A pan-caspase inhibitor, emricasan, inhibited ZIKV-induced increases in caspase-3 activity and protected 
human cortical neural progenitors in both monolayer and three-dimensional organoid cultures. Ten structurally 
unrelated inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases inhibited ZIKV replication. Niclosamide, a category B anthelmintic 
drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, also inhibited ZIKV replication. Finally, combination 
treatments using one compound from each category (neuroprotective and antiviral) further increased protection of 
human neural progenitors and astrocytes from ZIKV-induced cell death. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this 
screening strategy and identify lead compounds for anti-ZIKV drug development.

RESULTS
Development of high-throughput compound-screening approaches
We first quantified caspase-3 activity and cell viability in hNPCs and 
astrocytes that were derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells 
(iPSCs), as well as in glioblastoma SNB-19 cells, after ZIKV infection in a 
1,536-well plate format (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). The prototypic 
ZIKV strain, MR766, was used in the primary screen because it produced 
the strongest cell death signal in cell culture experiments. The signal-to-
basal (S/B) ratios and the coefficients of variation (CV) obtained in the 
caspase-3 activity assay after a 6-h ZIKV exposure were 2.1-fold and 7.0% 
for hNPCs, 7.0-fold and 5.9% for SNB-19 cells and 11.0-fold and 9.1% for 
astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. 1b). The Zʹ factors, which are a measure 
of statistical effect size and an index for assay quality control37, for hNPCs, 
SNB-19 and astrocytes were 0.20, 0.68 and 0.72, respectively. Because a Zʹ 
factor >0.5 indicates a robust screening assay37, the caspase assay using 
SNB-19 cells or astrocytes is suitable for high-throughput screening.
To measure cell viability, we performed an ATP-content assay follow-
ing ZIKV infection for 3 d (Supplementary Table 2). Cell viability was 
reduced by 39%, 82% and 69% in hNPCs, SNB-19 cells and human astro-
cytes, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1c). The Zʹ factors in these three 
cell types were 0.06, 0.37 and 0.32, respectively. These results indicated 
that measuring caspase-3 activity is a better assay for high-throughput 
compound screening than the cell-viability assay.
High-throughput screen of compound collections
We carried out a screening campaign, using the caspase-3 activity 
sional (3D) cellular models of early human brain development, leads to 
reduced thickness of hNPC and neuronal layers, and an overall reduc-
tion in organoid size16,17,20,24, observations that are again consistent 
with features of microcephaly. These results have also been recapitulated 
in mouse models20,21,23. Despite these advancements in understanding 
how ZIKV causes developmental abnormalities and in preclinical studies 
that are underway to develop vaccines25,26, there is currently no drug 
approved to treat or prevent ZIKV infection.
Drug repurposing screens have recently emerged as an alternative 
approach to accelerate drug development27,28. Following a repurposing 
phenotypic screen, new indications for existing drugs may be rapidly 
identified, and clinical trials can be carried out quickly, which is espe-
cially critical for rapidly spreading infectious diseases. For example, 
recent drug repurposing screens have led to discoveries of potential new 
candidate therapies for Ebola virus disease29,30, giardiasis31, Entamoeba 
histolytica infection32, malaria gametocytes33, Exserohilum rostratum 
infection34, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection35 and, very recently, ZIKV 
infection36. On the basis of our previous finding that ZIKV infection 
of hNPCs results in an increase in caspase-3 activation, followed by 
cell death15, we designed a compound-screening approach using cas-
pase-3 activity as the primary screening assay, with a secondary cell 
viability assay for confirmation (Supplementary Fig. 1a). We identified 
two classes of effective compounds that are capable of protecting neural 
cells from ZIKV-induced cell death, one consisting of compounds that 
are antiviral in nature and the other of compounds that are neuropro-
tective in nature.

directly preventing ZIKV-induced cell death or suppressing ZIKV rep-
lication (Supplementary Table 4).
Protection from ZIKV-induced cell death by emricasan
Emricasan, a pan-caspase inhibitor, was identified as the most potent 
anti-cell-death compound, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration 
(IC50) values of 0.13–0.9 µM in both caspase activity and cell viability 
assays for SNB-19 cells against three ZIKV strains: MR766 (1947 Ugandan 
strain), FSS13025 (2010 Cambodian strain) and PRVABC59 (2015 Puerto 
Rican strain) (Fig. 1a). It was also effective for all three cell types tested 
(Supplementary Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 5). In addition, emri-
casan treatment reduced the number of active (cleaved) caspase-3-ex-
pressing forebrain-specific hNPCs after infection with FSS13025, in both 
monolayer and 3D organoid cultures (Fig. 1b,c). Emricasan treatment of 
ZIKV-exposed brain organoids did not seem to affect hNPC proliferation, 
as compared to the mock-treated organoids, when evaluated by phospho-
histone3 (PH3) expression (106 ± 10%; n = 8; P = 0.7; one-way analysis of 
variance (ANOVA)). Notably, ZIKV antigen persisted in both 2D and 3D 
cultures after emricasan treatment (Fig. 1b,c). Therefore, emricasan shows 
neuroprotective activity for hNPCs but does not suppress ZIKV replication.
assay and SNB-19 cells, with the Library of Pharmacologically Active 
Compounds (LOPAC, 1,280 compounds), the National Center for 
Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS ) Pharmaceutical Collection 
of approved drugs (2,816 compounds) and a collection of clinical can-
didate compounds (2,000 compounds). Primary hits included a total 
of 116 compounds that suppressed ZIKV-induced caspase-3 activity 
in SNB-19 cells. We also carried out an independent primary screen 
in hNPCs using the same libraries. This second screen resulted in 173 
primary hits that included all 116 compounds from the initial caspase-3 
screen in SNB-19 cells. All of the results from the primary screen with 
the approved drug collections, and hit confirmation, were deposited 
into the open-access PubChem database (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/).
Next, the activity of these primary hits from the caspase-3 activity 
assay was re-evaluated in ZIKV-infected SNB-19 cells, hNPCs and 
astrocytes, and, notably, was performed in parallel with the compound 
cytotoxicity assay (Supplementary Fig. 1d,e and Supplementary Table 
3). Cytotoxic compounds were then eliminated from the confirmed-
hit list. Consistent with the screening design, we identified compounds 
that reduced virally induced caspase activation and apoptosis by either

depletion of CDK9 impairs influenza A viral replication46. The pos-
sibility of ZIKV inhibition by a CDKi is particularly intriguing, given 
our recent observation that ZIKV infection and cell cycle regulation are 
intimately connected15. We therefore tested 27 additional structurally 
distinct CDKis for inhibition of ZIKV infection (Supplementary Table 
6). We identified nine effective compounds using SNB-19 cells (Fig. 3c,d 
and Supplementary Fig. 4a), whereas four non-CDK-kinase inhibitors 
showed minimal anti-ZIKV activity (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Analyses 
of ZIKV production showed IC50 values at submicromolar concentra-
tions for nine of the ten CDKis tested, with seliciclib and RGB-286147 
at 24 nM and 27 nM, respectively (Fig. 3d).
Using the clinical isolate from the 2015 Puerto Rico Zika out-
break, PRVABC59, we next examined the effectiveness of the identi-
fied compounds in hNPCs and astrocytes, both of which are target 
cells for ZIKV infection in the fetal brain9. Niclosamide and PHA-
690509 treatments inhibited ZIKV infection and production in these 
central nervous system cells (Fig. 4a–c). ZIKV targets astrocytes in 
the adult mouse brain47. Analysis of ZIKV production after infec-
tion of human astrocytes showed IC50 values of ~0.2 mM for both 
niclosamide and PHA-690509 (Fig. 4c). Quantification of astrocyte 
viability showed minimal toxicity for niclosamide, PHA-690509 
and four CDKis at levels <3 mM (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Given 
the critical role of CDKs in cell cycle regulation, we examined the 
effect of PHA-690509 and seliciclib, the most potent CDKi for ZIKV 
inhibition (Fig. 3d), on hNPC proliferation. ZIKV infection led 
to a drastic reduction in hNPC proliferation, which was partially 
rescued by treatment with either compound (Supplementary Fig. 
5b). Furthermore, treatment with PHA-690509 (1 mM) or seliciclib 
(5 mM) alone had minimal effect on hNPC proliferation in brain 
organoids (Supplementary Fig. 5c).
Identification of antiviral compounds against ZIKV
Using expression of ZIKV protein NS1 as a read-out to screen anti-ZIKV 
activity, we identified two compounds from the primary hit list that 
substantially inhibited ZIKV infection of SNB-19 cells (Supplementary 
Fig. 2a). The first was niclosamide, a US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA)-approved drug for treating worm infections in both humans and 
domestic livestock; the other was PHA-690509, an investigational com-
pound that functions as a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKi). 
Both compounds inhibited replication of all three strains of ZIKV, as 
measured by NS1 expression, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2a–d 
and Supplementary Fig. 2b,c).
We further validated the antiviral activity of these two compounds 
using independent approaches. First, measurement of intracellular ZIKV 
RNA levels showed IC50 values of 1.72 µM and 0.37 µM for PHA-690509 
and niclosamide, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2d,e). Second, 
both compounds suppressed production of infectious ZIKV particles 
at submicromolar concentrations (Fig. 2e). To investigate the underly-
ing cellular mechanism, we performed time-of-addition experiments 
in SNB-19 cells (Fig. 3a). Both compounds effectively inhibited ZIKV 
infection when added either 1 h before or 4 h after virus inoculation 
(Fig. 3b). In contrast, a monoclonal antibody to AXL, a putative ZIKV 
entry factor38,39, was only effective when added before inoculation (Fig. 
3b). Furthermore, the reduction of ZIKV RNA by treatment with these 
compounds was apparent only after the entry phase (0–4 h after infec-
tion) and correlated with the replication phase (4–24 h) of the infection 
cycle (Supplementary Fig. 3). Taken together, these results indicate that 
niclosamide and PHA-690509 inhibit ZIKV infection at a post-entry 
stage, probably at the viral RNA replication step.
Pharmacological CDKis have been shown to inhibit replication of 
diverse viruses in culture, including herpes viruses and HIV40–45, and

DISCUSSION
Here we developed two ultra-high-throughput assays, using human 
neural cells, to measure ZIKV-induced caspase-3 activity and cell via-
bility, and we screened over 6,000 approved drugs and drug candidate 
compounds. Our efforts so far have led to the identification of small 
molecules that either protect against cell death in multiple neural cell 
types or suppress ZIKV replication.
Emricasan, also called IDN-6556 or PF-03491390, is an inhibitor of 
activated caspases, and it has sub- to nanomolar activity in vitro48,49. 
Emricasan is currently being evaluated in phase 2 clinical trials for the 
reduction of hepatic injury and liver fibrosis caused by chronic HCV 
infection50,51. Emricasan was well tolerated in human trials, and there 
were no significant adverse events51. It was reported that overall and 
maximum concentrations of emricasan (orally, twice daily, ×4 d) in 
human blood were 1.90 mg/ml (3.35 mM) and 2.36 mg/ml (4.15 mM), 
Benefit of combining neuroprotective and antiviral compounds
Finally we explored combining these two categories of compounds 
(neuroprotective and antiviral). The two-drug combination of emri-
casan and PHA-690509 showed an additive effect in inhibiting cas-
pase-3 activity in SNB-19 cells (Fig. 4d). A similar additive effect was 
found to preserve astrocyte viability after ZIKV infection (Fig. 4). 
Notably, emricasan did not interfere with PHA-690509’s ability to 
inhibit ZIKV infection in the combination treatment (Fig. 4b and 
Supplementary Fig. 6a–c).
We also tested the effect of sequential treatment with the two catego-
ries of compounds. We found that treatment of PRVABC59-infected 
hNPCs with emricasan for 72 h followed by niclosamide treatment for 
48 h led to the recovery of ZIKV-negative hNPCs, suggesting a beneficial 
effect of ‘buying time’ by inhibiting apoptosis to allow the infected cells 
to recover (Supplementary Fig. 6d).

health_professionals/). Independently of evaluating the potential ben-
efits and risks for pregnant women, niclosamide could be used to reduce 
viral load in infected men and nonpregnant women, which could reduce 
transmission and potentially prevent Guillain–Barré syndrome and 
other ZIKV-related complications in humans.
Despite rapid progress in the preclinical development of anti-ZIKV 
vaccines25,26, testing the safety and efficacy of vaccines in humans can 
take a substantial amount of time. Effective countermeasures against 
ZIKV, including small-molecule therapeutics, are also urgently needed. 
Our findings and the tools provided here should significantly advance 
current ZIKV research and have an immediate effect on the develop-
ment of anti-ZIKV therapeutics. Furthermore, our findings could have 
implications for combating infections by other arboviruses, such as den-
gue viruses, chikungunya virus and West Nile virus, many of which can 
cause devastating illness.

respectively. Therefore, the reported human plasma concentration 
of emricasan is about tenfold higher than the IC50 for inhibition of 
increased caspase-3 activity and cell death caused by ZIKV infection 
in vitro. Future animal studies will be critical to evaluate the efficacy of 
emricasan in vivo. Whether it is safe to use emricasan during pregnancy 
for ZIKV infection in humans will need to be evaluated in preclinical 
toxicology studies and in clinical trials.
Ten structurally unrelated CDKis inhibit ZIKV replication and 
production, supporting a role for CDKs in the life cycle of ZIKV in 
human cells. Because flaviviruses are not known to encode any CDKs, 
these results suggest that one or more cellular CDKs in the host may be 
important for ZIKV replication. Further studies on target identifica-
tion, including targeted kinome siRNA or CRISPR screens, may reveal 
additional insights into the mechanism of action for these inhibitors. 
Although many CDKis are being evaluated in clinical trials for various 
cancers, cystic fibrosis and Cushings disease, these compounds may not 
be suitable for pregnant women because of potentially hazardous effects 
on the fetus52. In our in vitro analyses, treatment with PHA-690509 or 
seliciclib partially rescued the ZIKV-induced reduction of hNPC pro-
liferation, and the treatment with either compound in the absence of 
ZIKV infection showed a minimal effect on hNPC proliferation in brain 
organoid cultures, which model early human brain development in vitro 
(Supplementary Fig. 5c,d). Future studies in animal models, including 
both rodents and primates, are critical to test the efficacy and toxic-
ity of identified compounds in vivo. Notably, these CDKis and their 
derivatives may be useful for treating nonpregnant humans who face an 
increased risk of Guillain–Barré syndrome and other conditions follow-
ing ZIKV infection. For example, viral RNA and infectious virus have 
been detected in the semen of men months after acute symptoms have 
resolved53. In addition, these CDKis will be valuable chemical tools in 
probing the roles of specific types of CDKs in ZIKV infection, which 
could serve as new targets for anti-ZIKV drug development. The struc-
tural diversity of effective CDKis also provides multiple scaffolds for 
lead-compound optimization using medicinal chemistry.
Niclosamide is an FDA-approved drug (trade name Niclocide) 
that has been used in humans to treat worm infections for nearly 50 
years, and it is well tolerated54,55. It is known to inhibit several viruses 
in culture systems, including the Japanese encephalitis flavivirus56–58. 
Its broad antiviral activity has been attributed to its ability to neutral-
ize endolysosomal pH and interfere with pH-dependent membrane 
fusion57, which is an essential step in the common virus entry pathway. 
Our time-of-addition and time-course analyses, however, suggest that 
inhibition by niclosamide occurs at a post-entry step, such as replica-
tion. Future molecular studies of its mechanism of action may provide 
additional targets for drug development. Niclosamide is a category B 
drug, which indicates that no risk to fetuses has been found in animal 
studies. It has low toxicity in mammals with an oral median lethal dose 
(LD50) value of 5,000 mg per kg body weight (mg/kg) in rats59. The 
potency of niclosamide on inhibition of ZIKV replication is in the sub-
micromolar range, whereas clinically it can be delivered at micromolar 
levels59. Additionally, a pro-drug formulation may further increase the 
bio-availability of this compound, which is currently indicated for treat-
ing intestinal parasites. The WHO recommends that niclosamide may be 
used during pregnancy because it has not been shown to be mutagenic, 
teratogenic or embryotoxic (http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/
Jh2922e/3.1.3.html). The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) concurs with the WHO recommendation and further recom-
mends that “for individual patients in clinical settings, the risk of treat-
ment (with Niclosamide) in pregnant women who are known to have 
an infection needs to be balanced with the risk of disease progression in 
the absence of treatment” (http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/hymenolepis/

ONLINE METHODS
Human forebrain-specific NPCs, astrocytes, organoids and cell line cultures. 
The human iPSC line (C1-2 line) was previously generated from a skin biopsy 
sample of a healthy male newborn and has been fully characterized and passaged 
on mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) feeder layers60. The BJ line was derived from 
healthy control fibroblasts obtained from the American Type Culture Collection 
(ATCC) (CRL-2522, male, neonatal). All studies followed institutional review 
board (IRB) protocols approved by Florida State University, Johns Hopkins 
University School of Medicine and Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. 
Human iPSCs were differentiated into forebrain-specific hNPCs following the 
previously established protocol60. Briefly, human iPSC colonies were detached 
from the feeder layer with 1 mg/ml collagenase treatment for 1 h and suspended 
in embryonic body (EB) medium, consisting of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-
2-free iPSC medium supplemented with 2 µM dorsomorphin (Sigma) and 2 
µM A-83 (Tocris) in nontreated polystyrene plates for 4 d with a daily medium 
change. After 4 d, EB medium was replaced by neural induction medium (NPC 
medium), which consists of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with F12 nutri-
ent mixture (DMEM/F12), N2 supplement, non-essential amino acids (NEAA), 
2 µg/ml heparin (Sigma) and 2 µM cyclopamine (Tocris). Floating EBs were then 
transferred to Matrigel-coated 6-well plates at day 7 to form neural-tube-like 
rosettes. Attached rosettes were kept for 15 d with an NPC medium change every 
other day. On day 22, rosettes were picked mechanically and transferred to low-
attachment plates (Corning) to form neurospheres in NPC medium containing 
B27 supplements (Invitrogen). Neurospheres were then dissociated with Accutase 
(Millipore) at 37 °C for 10 min and placed onto Matrigel-coated 6-well plates at 
day 24 to form monolayer hNPCs in NPC medium containing B27. These hNPCs 
expressed forebrain-specific progenitor markers60, including NESTIN, PAX6, 
EMX-1, FOXG1 and OTX2.
Human BJ iPSC line and forebrain NPCs were derived as described previ-
ously61,62. Human iPSC-derived forebrain NPCs were maintained at high density, 
grown on Matrigel (BD Bioscience) in medium consisting of DMEM/F12, 1× 
N2, 1× B27-RA (Invitrogen), 1 mg/ml laminin (Invitrogen) and 20 ng/ml FGF-2 
(Invitrogen). hNPCs were differentiated to astrocytes and cultured on Matrigel-
coated plates in astrocyte medium (ScienCell). Astrocytes were split 1:3 every 
week with Accutase (Millipore) and cultured up to 120 d.
Forebrain-specific organoids were generated from the C1-2 human iPSC line 
as previously described17. Briefly, on day 1, human iPSC colonies were detached 
7 d after passage with collagenase type IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific), washed 
with fresh stem cell medium and transferred to an ultra-low-attachment 6-well 
plate (Corning Costar), containing 3 ml of stem cell medium (without FGF-2), 
plus 2 mM dorsomorphine and 2 mM A83-01. On days 5–6, half of the medium 
was replaced with induction medium consisting of DMEM/F12, 1× N2 supple-
ment (Invitrogen), 10 mg/ml heparin, 1× penicillin–streptomycin, 1× NEAA, 1× 
Glutamax, 4 ng/ml WNT-3A (R&D Systems), 1 mM CHIR99021 (Cellagentech) 
and 1 mM SB-431542 (Cellagentech). On day 7, organoids were embedded in 
Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and continued to grow in induction medium for 6 
more days. On day 14, embedded organoids were mechanically dissociated from 
Matrigel by pipetting up and down onto the plate with a 5-ml pipette tip. Typically, 
10–20 organoids were transferred to each well of a 12-well spinning bioreactor 
(SpinW) containing differentiation medium, consisting of DMEM/F12, 1× N2 
and B27 supplements (Invitrogen), 1× penicillin–streptomycin, 1× 2-mercap-
toenthanol, 1× NEAA and 2.5 mg/ml insulin (Sigma). Day 18 forebrain organoids 
were exposed to ZIKV FSS-13025 in SpinW for 24 h and then in replaced fresh 
medium for an additional 9 d before fixation and immunostaining as previously 
described17. To test the potential toxic effect on hNPC proliferation, day 20 fore-
brain organoids were also treated with PHA-690509 (1 mM) or seliciclib (5 mM) 
for 3 d without ZIKV exposure. On day 23 (20 + 3), treated forebrain organ-
oids were pulsed with 10 mM 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU; Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) for 1 h and immediately fixed for analysis.
The glioblastoma SNB-19 cell line (part of the National Cancer Institute 
60 human tumor cell lines) was a gift from Dr. David Meckes (Florida State 
University, Tallahassee, FL). SNB-19 cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 
in RPMI-60 medium, 1× penicillin–streptomycin and 10% FBS (Invitrogen). 
The Aedes albopictus C6/36 cell line (ATCC) was maintained at 28 °C in 5% CO2.
Preparation of ZIKV and cell infection. The MR766-ZIKV stock with the titer 
of 1 × 105 tissue-culture-infective dose (TCID)/ml, in the form of culture fluid 
from an infected rhesus Macaca cell line LLC-MK2, was originally obtained 
from ZeptoMetrix (Buffalo, NY). The FSS13025-ZIKV strain was obtained 
from Drs. Robert Tesh and Pei-Yong Shi (University of Texas Medical Branch, 
Galveston, Texas). The PRVABC59 strain was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, 
VA). Original viral stocks were then amplified in Aedes albopictus clone C6/36 
cells. Briefly, C6/36 cells were inoculated with viral inoculum for 1 h at 28 °C 
in a low volume of medium (3 ml per T-75 flask), with rocking every 15 min, 
before the addition of 17 ml medium. Virus-inoculated cells were incubated at 
28 °C for 6–7 d before harvesting the supernatant. C6/36-amplified ZIKV titer 
was determined by infecting Vero cells for 48 h with a methylcellulose overlay 
and analyzed for focus-forming units per ml (FFU/ml). In mock infections, an 
equal volume of spent uninfected C6/36 culture medium was used. For infections, 
cells were seeded into 12-well plates 1 d before virus addition. For all cell types, 
compound was added 1 h before viral addition unless otherwise specified. Cells 
were harvested at 24–72 h after infection.
Compound libraries. The Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds 
(LOPAC), which consists of 1,280 compounds, was purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich. The NCATS pharmaceutical collection63, a collection consisting of 
2,816 clinically approved and investigational drugs, was established in 2011. All 
compounds were dissolved in DMSO as 10-mM stock solutions, then diluted in 
DMSO at a 1:3 ratio in 384-well plates, followed by reformatting into 1,536-well 
compound plates for use in high-throughput screening (HTS).
Caspase-3 assay. Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay kit (catalog number G8092; Promega, 
Madison, WI) was used to detect caspase-3 activity. Reagents were reconstituted 
as described in the protocol from the manufacturer. Polystyrene plates (384-well 
and 1,536-well; regular tissue-culture-treated and PDL-coated) were purchased 
from Greiner Bio-One (Monroe, NC). Cells were seeded in 384- and 1536-well 
assay plates and cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 16 h. ZIKV solution was added 
to cells, followed by incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 6 h. Caspase-Glo-3/7 
reagent was added to each well, unless otherwise specified, and incubated at 
room temperature for 30 min. The luminescence intensity of the assay plates 
was measured using a ViewLux plate reader (PerkinElmer). Data were normal-
ized by using the cell-containing wells without ZIKV as a negative control (0% 
induction of caspase-3 activity) and wells containing ZIKV infected cells that 
induced caspase-3 activity were used as a positive control (100% induction of 
caspase 3 activity).
ATP content assay for cell viability and compound cytotoxicity. The ATPlite 
luminescence assay system assay kit (catalog number 6016731; PerkinElmer) 
was used to determine cell viability. The reagent was reconstituted and prepared 
as described by the manufacturer. In order to measure the cell death caused by 
ZIKV infection, cells were cultured for 16 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in assay plates, 
followed by addition of ZIKV solution and incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 
72 h. ATPlite, the ATP-monitoring reagent, was then added to the assay plates, 
which were then incubated for 15 min. The resulting luminescence was mea-
sured using the ViewLux plate reader. Data were normalized using wells without 
cells as a control for 100% cell killing, and cell-containing wells without ZIKV 
infection as full cell viability (0% cell killing). For analysis of potential toxicity of 
select compounds, cells were seeded in 96-well plates. One day later, cells were 
treated with the indicated compounds and concentrations for 24–48 h before the 
addition of Cell Titer-Glo substrate (Promega) and measurement, according to 
manufacturer’s instructions.
Large-scale compound screening. A quantitative high-throughput screening 
(qHTS, ref. 64), in which each compound was assayed in four concentrations 
(0.37, 1.84, 9.2 and 46 mM), was performed in singlet for the primary compound 
screen. While a single-compound concentration (in singlet) has been traditionally 
used for HTS of large compound collections (such as 1 to 3 million compounds), 
the qHTS format with multiple compound concentrations has recently been used 
for medium or small compound collections, such as an approved drug library. 
Specifically, SNB-19 cells and hNPCs were seeded onto PDL-coated 1,536-well 
assay plates at 250 cells per 3 ml per well and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 16 h. 
Test compounds, dissolved in DMSO, were transferred to assay plates at a volume 
of 23 nl/well by an automated pintool workstation (Wako Automation, San Diego, 
CA). Compounds were incubated with cells for 30 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2, imme-
diately followed by the addition of 2 ml/well of ZIKV (2 FFU/cell). Incubation time

of compound-treated cells with ZIKV varied based on assay format. Experiments 
measuring virus-induced caspase-3/7 activity required a 6-h incubation of ZIKV 
in the presence of compounds at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Following this incubation, 3.5 
ml/well of caspase-3/7 reagent mixture was added to the assay plates. The plates 
were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and the resultant luminescence 
signal was measured using a ViewLux plate reader (Perkin Elmer). Experiments 
measuring virus-induced cell death required a 72-h incubation of ZIKV in the 
presence of the compounds, at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Following this incubation, 3.5 
ml/well of ATP content detection reagent was added to assay plates. The plates 
were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and the resultant luminescence 
signal was measured in a ViewLux plate reader. Step-by-step assay protocols are 
listed in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.
Confirmation of primary hits and counter-screen. The primary hits were 
selected with criteria of IC50 values ≤ 30 mM, and maximal inhibition ≥ 50%. 
The hit compounds were diluted 1:3 in DMSO to 11 concentrations for the confir-
mation experiments. The same caspase-3 activity assay was first used to confirm 
the activity of the primary-hit compounds (n = 3). In order to further confirm 
the activity of these compounds, the protective effect of these primary hits on the 
cell death caused by incubation of cells with ZIKV for 3 d was also determined 
using an ATP content cell viability assay (n = 3).
Because compound cytotoxicity could nonspecifically reduce the caspase activ-
ity induced by ZIKV, we also used the ATP content assay to measure compound 
cytotoxicity in the absence of ZIKV infection. Cells were seeded in the same 
way as described above in 1,536-well assay plates. After a 6-h incubation with 
compounds in the absence of ZIKV, 3.5 ml/well of ATP content reagent mixture 
was added to the assay plates, which were then incubated for 30 min at room 
temperature. The luminescence signal in the assay plates was measured using a 
ViewLux plate reader (Supplementary Table 3). Any compounds that exhibited 
cytotoxicity were eliminated as false-positive compounds.
Western blot analysis. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, pelleting and 
subsequent lysis in 1× Laemlli buffer, and the lysates were then boiled, or the 
cells were directly lysed in 1× Laemlli buffer and boiled. Antibodies used were 
anti–ZIKV NS1 (1:2,000; BF-1225-36, BioFront Technologies, Tallahassee, FL) 
or anti-GAPDH (sc-25778, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Texas). The screening 
of two subsets of compounds for antiviral activity (Supplementary Fig. 2a and 
Supplementary Fig. 4b) was performed in a blinded manner, whereas all other 
experiments were performed in a nonblinded manner.
Immunocytochemistry. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) 
for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were permeabilized and blocked with 
0.25% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and 10% donkey or goat serum in phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min as previously described60. Samples were then 
incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight, followed by multiple PBST 
(PBS plus Tween-20) washes and incubation with secondary antibodies for 1 
h at room temperature. Slides were mounted using VECTASHIELD with 4ʹ,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vectorlabs, Burlingame, CA). The following 
primary antibodies were used: anti–flavivirus group antigen (clone D1-4G2-4-
15; mouse; 1:500; Millipore), anti–cleaved caspase-3 (Asp15; rabbit; 1:500; Cell 
Signaling Technology) and anti–phospho-histone-H3 (PH3; 9701S; rabbit; 1:300; 
Cell Signaling Technology) as previously described17. Antibodies were prepared 
in PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 and 10% donkey serum. For EdU assay, 
the Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 488 Imaging Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was 
used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Images were taken by Zeiss LSM 
700 and 880 confocal microscopes, an Olympus BX61 microscope or a Zeiss 
Axiovert 200M microscope.
For organoid studies, quantitative analyses were conducted on randomly 
selected cortical structures captured by confocal microscope in a blinded fashion 
(example as shown in Fig. 1c). Cell death and cell proliferation were quantified 
by counting activated caspase-3+ and PH3+ nuclei, respectively, relative to the 
total number of nuclei stained by DAPI in the ventricular structures in at least 
six samples, as previously described17. We determined our sample sizes based on 
previous studies conducted in our lab17.
NS1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The anti-ZIKV NS1 ELISA 
kit (ZKV-NS1-EK) was obtained from BioFront Technologies (Tallahassee, FL) 
and used according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Viral titer by focus-forming unit (FFU) assay. ZIKV titers from cell superna-
tants were determined by infecting Vero cells for 48 h with a methylcellulose 
overlay and analyzing the plates for focus-forming units per ml (FFU/ml). Briefly, 
cell supernatant was titrated in triplicates onto a monolayer culture of Vero cells 
in 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Virus inoculum was removed and 
replaced with a methylcellulose overlay. Vero cells were incubated for an addi-
tional 48–72 h before fixation and incubated with anti–flavivirus group antigen 
overnight at 4 °C. The next day, fixed cells were washed three times with PBS and 
incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse secondary 
antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed again three times with PBS and 
incubated with DAB peroxidase substrate for 10 min (Vector Labs).
Antiviral compound analysis. SNB-19 cells, human astrocytes or hNPCs 
were seeded in 12-well plates at approximately 3 × 105 cells/well. The next 
day, cells were treated with compound at 1- to 10-fold of the IC50 value, or 
the indicated concentration, for 1 h before inoculation with ZIKV (multiplic-
ity of infection (MOI) = 0.5–1). Cells and supernatant were harvested 24–48 
h post infection and analyzed by western blot, immunostaining or quan-
titative RT–PCR analyses. Western blot bands were quantified, and immu-
nostaining images were counted using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD). For 
qRT–PCR analysis, total cellular RNA was purified using the RNeasy Mini 
Plus kit (Qiagen). About 500–1,000 ng total RNA was reverse-transcribed 
into cDNA using random hexamers according to manufacturer’s instruc-
tions (Superscript III First Strand Synthesis System, Invitrogen). Quantitative 
PCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Invitrogen), gene 
specific primers (ZIKV-NS1-Forward: TGGAGTTCAACTGACGGTCG; 
ZIKV-NS1-Reverse: 
TACCCCGAACCCATGATCCT; 
Gapdh-
Forward: 
TCACTGCCACCCAGAAGACTG; 
and 
Gapdh-Reverse: 
GGATGACCTTGCCCACAGC), and an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast real-
time PCR system. A 60 °C to 95 °C melt curve analysis following PCR was 
performed using default settings. Relative quantification was performed using 
the DDCT method with Gapdh as the endogenous control, and the relative fold 
change was calculated by normalizing to the levels in the control cells.
Data analysis and statistics. The primary-screen data and concentration 
response curves were analyzed using software developed internally65. The 
IC50 values of compound confirmation data were calculated using the Prism 
software (GraphPad Software, Inc. San Diego, CA). All values are expressed as 
the mean ± s.d. unless specified otherwise. Western blots were quantified using 
ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD). We did not exclude any samples. Experiments 
were not blinded, except for those that were specified. The sample sizes were 
estimated according to previous studies and the known variability of the assays. 
Statistical analyses were carried out with the one-way ANOVA using the Prism 
software. The Zʹ factor, a measure of statistical effect size and an index for 
assay quality control, was calculated by: Zʹ = 1 – ((3 × s.d.signal) + (3 × s.d.basal)/
(Meansignal – Meanbasal)).
