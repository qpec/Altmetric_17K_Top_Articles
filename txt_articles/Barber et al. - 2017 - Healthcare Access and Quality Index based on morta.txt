Healthcare Access and Quality Index based on mortality from 
causes amenable to personal health care in 195 countries and 
territories, 1990–2015: a novel analysis from the Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2015
GBD 2015 Healthcare Access and Quality Collaborators*
Summary
Background National levels of personal health-care access and quality can be approximated by measuring mortality 
rates from causes that should not be fatal in the presence of effective medical care (ie, amenable mortality). Previous 
analyses of mortality amenable to health care only focused on high-income countries and faced several methodological 
challenges. In the present analysis, we use the highly standardised cause of death and risk factor estimates generated 
through the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) to improve and expand the 
quantification of personal health-care access and quality for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015.
Methods We mapped the most widely used list of causes amenable to personal health care developed by Nolte and 
McKee to 32 GBD causes. We accounted for variations in cause of death certification and misclassifications 
through the extensive data standardisation processes and redistribution algorithms developed for GBD. To isolate 
the effects of personal health-care access and quality, we risk-standardised cause-specific mortality rates for each 
geography-year by removing the joint effects of local environmental and behavioural risks, and adding back the 
global levels of risk exposure as estimated for GBD 2015. We employed principal component analysis to create a 
single, interpretable summary measure–the Healthcare Quality and Access (HAQ) Index–on a scale of 0 to 100. 
The HAQ Index showed strong convergence validity as compared with other health-system indicators, including 
health expenditure per capita (r=0·88), an index of 11 universal health coverage interventions (r=0·83), and human 
resources for health per 1000 (r=0·77). We used free disposal hull analysis with bootstrapping to produce a frontier 
based on the relationship between the HAQ Index and the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a measure of overall 
development consisting of income per capita, average years of education, and total fertility rates. This frontier 
allowed us to better quantify the maximum levels of personal health-care access and quality achieved across the 
development spectrum, and pinpoint geographies where gaps between observed and potential levels have 
narrowed or widened over time.
Findings Between 1990 and 2015, nearly all countries and territories saw their HAQ Index values improve; 
nonetheless, the difference between the highest and lowest observed HAQ Index was larger in 2015 than in 1990, 
ranging from 28·6 to 94·6. Of 195 geographies, 167 had statistically significant increases in HAQ Index levels 
since 1990, with South Korea, Turkey, Peru, China, and the Maldives recording among the largest gains by 2015. 
Performance on the HAQ Index and individual causes showed distinct patterns by region and level of development, 
yet substantial heterogeneities emerged for several causes, including cancers in highest-SDI countries; chronic 
kidney disease, diabetes, diarrhoeal diseases, and lower respiratory infections among middle-SDI countries; and 
measles and tetanus among lowest-SDI countries. While the global HAQ Index average rose from 40·7 
(95% uncertainty interval, 39·0–42·8) in 1990 to 53·7 (52·2–55·4) in 2015, far less progress occurred in narrowing 
the gap between observed HAQ Index values and maximum levels achieved; at the global level, the difference 
between the observed and frontier HAQ Index only decreased from 21·2 in 1990 to 20·1 in 2015. If every country 
and territory had achieved the highest observed HAQ Index by their corresponding level of SDI, the global average 
would have been 73·8 in 2015. Several countries, particularly in eastern and western sub-Saharan Africa, reached 
HAQ Index values similar to or beyond their development levels, whereas others, namely in southern sub-Saharan 
Africa, the Middle East, and south Asia, lagged behind what geographies of similar development attained between 
1990 and 2015.
Interpretation This novel extension of the GBD Study shows the untapped potential for personal health-care access and 
quality improvement across the development spectrum. Amid substantive advances in personal health care at the 
national level, heterogeneous patterns for individual causes in given countries or territories suggest that few places 
have consistently achieved optimal health-care access and quality across health-system functions and therapeutic 
areas. This is especially evident in middle-SDI countries, many of which have recently undergone or are currently 
experiencing epidemiological transitions. The HAQ Index, if paired with other measures of health-system

Introduction
Quantifying how much personal health care can 
improve population health and ultimately health-system 
performance is a crucial undertaking, particularly 
following the inclusion of universal health coverage (UHC) 
in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).1 Mortality 
from causes considered amenable to personal health care 
serve as an important proxy of health-care access and 
quality (panel),4,6–8 and thus can be used to benchmark 
dimensions of health-system performance and to identify 
untapped potential for advancing personal health-care 
access and quality.9–12 Much debate exists concerning the 
relative contributions of personal health care, population-
level health initiatives, and social determinants to 
population health.13–16 Studies show that access to high-
quality health care substantially improves many health 
outcomes, including infectious diseases (eg, tuberculosis 
and measles);17–19 maternal and neonatal disorders;20,21 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
In the last several decades, various studies have used measures of 
amenable mortality, or deaths that could be avoided in the 
presence of high-quality personal health care, to garner signals 
about health-system delivery, effectiveness, and performance. 
Rutstein and colleagues developed an initial list of conditions 
from which death was “unnecessary and untimely” during the 
late 1970s, while Charlton and colleagues were the first to apply 
this concept to population-level analyses in England and Wales. 
Although variations of amenable cause lists exist today, the most 
widely used cause list of 33 conditions was developed and further 
honed by Nolte and McKee during the early-to-mid 2000s. Such 
analyses of health-care access and quality, as approximated by 
amenable mortality, have been limited to Europe, Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, 
and country-specific assessments, including the USA, Australia, 
and New Zealand. These studies acknowledge several 
methodological challenges that may impede the policy utility 
and applications of their results. Heterogeneity in cause of death 
certification and misclassification, even for countries with 
complete vital registration systems, can hinder comparability of 
results over time and place. Further, researchers commonly 
acknowledge that variations in measured amenable mortality 
rates may be more reflective of differences in underlying risk 
factor exposure rather than true differences in personal 
health-care access and quality.
Added value of this study
The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
(GBD) provides an appropriate analytic framework through 
which these main challenges in approximating personal 
health-care access and quality can be addressed. First, the 
extensive cause of death data processing and standardisation 
that occur within GBD allow for the systematic identification and 
redress of cause of death certification errors or misclassification. 
These adjustments are conducted across all geographies and 
over time, accounting for known misclassification patterns and 
applying well established redistribution algorithms for causes 
designated to so-called garbage codes, or causes of death that 
could not or should not be classified as underlying causes of 
death. Second, we draw on GBD’s comparative risk assessment 
analyses to risk-standardise national cause-specific mortality 
rates to global levels of risk exposure; this step helps to remove 
variations in death rates due to risk exposure rather than 
differences in personal health-care access and quality. Third, we 
construct the Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index based 
on risk-standardised cause-specific death rates to facilitate 
comparisons over time and by geography. Finally, we produced a 
HAQ Index frontier to enable a better understanding of the 
maximum observed levels of the HAQ Index across the 
development spectrum, and what untapped potential for 
improving personal health-care access and quality may exist 
given a country or territory’s current resources.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our results point to substantive gains for advancing personal 
health-care access and quality throughout the world since 1990. 
However, the gap between places with the highest and lowest 
HAQ Index in 1990 increased by 2015, suggesting that 
geographic inequalities in personal health-care access and quality 
might be on the rise. In 2015, countries in western Europe 
generally had the highest HAQ Index values while geographies in 
sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania mainly saw the lowest, further 
emphasising these disparities. A number of countries achieved 
improvements in the HAQ Index that exceeded the average 
found for their development level, identifying possible success 
stories in markedly advancing personal health-care access and 
quality at the national level. Based on our frontier analysis, many 
countries and territories currently experience untapped potential 
for improving health-care access and quality, on the basis of their 
development, a finding that could be transformative for 
prioritising particular health-sector reforms, pinpointing 
cause-specific therapeutic areas that require more policy 
attention, and monitoring overall progress toward universal 
health coverage.
characteristics such as intervention coverage, could provide a robust avenue for tracking progress on universal health 
coverage and identifying local priorities for strengthening personal health-care quality and access throughout the world.

several cancers (eg, testicular, skin, and cervical cancers);22,23 
and many non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as 
cerebrovascular disease (stroke),24 diabetes,25 and chronic 
kidney disease.26 Consequently, assessing mortality rates 
from these conditions, which are considered amenable to 
personal health care,4,6–8 can provide vital insights into 
access to and quality of health care worldwide. Assessments 
of both mortality and disease burden attributable to risk 
factors modifiable through public health programmes and 
policy (eg, tobacco taxation), combined with access to high-
quality personal health care, can provide a more complete 
picture of the potential avenues for health improvement.
In the late 1970s, Rutstein and colleagues first introduced 
the idea of “unnecessary, untimely deaths”, proposing a 
list of causes from which death should not occur with 
timely and effective medical care.6 Eventually termed 
“amenable mortality”, this approach has been modified 
and extended since, with researchers refining the list of 
included conditions by accounting for advances in medical 
care, the introduction of new interventions, and improved 
knowledge of cause-specific epidemiology.7,8,27–29 Numerous 
studies have subsequently assessed amenable mortality 
trends over time, by sex, and across ages in different 
populations;2,10,11,30–33 examples include analyses showing 
variations in amenable mortality within the European 
Union and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD),3,34 and how much the US health 
system 
has 
lagged 
behind 
other 
higher-income 
countries.30,31 Some studies also extended the set of 
amenable conditions to include those targeted by public 
health pro 
grammes.31 The most widely cited and utilised 
list of causes amenable to personal health care is that of 
Nolte and McKee,4 which has been extensively used in 
Europe, the USA, and other OECD countries.9,11,30,31,35
Previously, several technical challenges have emerged 
concerning the quantification of mortality from con-
ditions amenable to personal health care and its use for 
understanding overall health-care access and quality. First, 
discrepancies in cause of death certification practices and 
misclassification over time and across geographies affect 
comparisons of amenable mortality.4,36 Second, observed 
geographic and temporal variations in deaths from 
selected amenable causes (eg, stroke and heart disease) 
might be attributed partly differences in risk factor 
exposure (eg, diet, high BMI, and physical activity) rather 
than actual differences in access to quality personal health 
care. Public health programmes and policies might modify 
these risks in well-functioning health systems, but risk 
variation can still confound the measurement of personal 
health-care access and quality. Third, much of this work 
has occurred in higher-income settings, with few studies 
applying the concept of amenable mortality as a 
mechanism for assessing access and quality to personal 
health care in lower-resource settings. Other critiques 
involve weak correlations between observed trends and 
variations in amenable mortality and indicators of health-
care provision and spending, although this result could 
Panel: Context and definitions
With the present analysis, we use the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
Study (GBD) to approximate average levels of personal health-care access and quality for 
195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. Here we define key concepts frequently 
used in the literature focused on assessing health-care quality and how they relate to GBD 
terminology: 
Avertable burden refers to disease burden that could be avoided in the presence of 
high-quality personal health care in addition to disease burden that could be prevented 
through effective public health (ie, non-personal) interventions. 
Amenable burden entails disease burden that could be avoided in the presence of 
high-quality personal health care.2,3 To be considered a cause amenable to personal health 
care, effective interventions must exist for the disease.4 The most widely used and cited 
list of causes amenable to health care is that of Nolte and McKee.
Preventable burden involves disease burden that could be avoided through public health 
programmes or policies focused on wider determinants of health, such as behavioural and 
lifestyle influences, environmental factors, and socioeconomic status.2,3 For some causes, 
both personal health care and public health programmes and policies can reduce burden.
Within the GBD framework, we have two related terms: attributable and avoidable 
burden.5 
Attributable burden refers to the difference in disease burden observed at present and 
burden that would have been observed in a population if past exposure was at the lowest 
level of risk.
Avoidable burden concerns the reduction in future disease burden if observed levels of 
risk factor exposure today were decreased to a counterfactual level.
For this study, we use the definition of amenable burden and focus on amenable mortality 
to provide a signal on approximate average levels of national personal health-care access 
and quality. Future analyses facilitated through the GBD study aim to provide more 
comprehensive assessments of health systems using amenable burden and preventable 
burden.
Garbage codes refer to causes certified by physicians on death certificates that cannot or 
should not be considered the actual underlying causes of death. Examples include risk 
factors like hypertension, non-fatal conditions like yellow nails, and causes that are on 
the final steps of a disease pathway (eg, certifying cardiopulmonary arrest as the cause 
when ischaemic heart disease is the true underlying cause of death). A vital strength of 
the GBD Study is its careful identification of garbage codes by cause, over time, and 
across locations, and subsequent redistribution to underlying causes based on the GBD 
cause list. 
Risk-standardisation involves removing the joint effects of environmental and 
behavioural risk exposure on cause-specific mortality rates at the country or territory level 
for each year of analysis, and then adding back the global average of environmental and 
behavioural risk exposure for every geography-year. The goal of risk-standardisation is to 
eliminate geographic or temporal differences in cause-specific mortality due to variations 
in risk factors that are not immediately targeted by personal health care—and thus 
provide comparable measures of outcomes amenable to personal health-care access and 
quality over place and time. 
Frontier analysis refers to the approach used for ascertaining the highest achieved values 
on the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQ Index) on the basis of development 
status, as measured by the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). The HAQ Index frontier 
delineates the maximum HAQ Index reached by a location as it relates to SDI; if a country 
or territory falls well below the frontier value given its level SDI, this finding suggests that 
greater gains in personal health-care access and quality should be possible based on the 
country or territory’s place on the development spectrum.

occur if health-care quality is heterogeneous within 
countries.37–40 Additionally, existing lists might exclude 
causes for which health care can avert death, such as the 
effects of trauma care on various injuries,4,41,42 and the ages 
at which personal health care can reduce mortality, namely 
beyond the age of 75.43,44
The goal of this analysis is to use estimates of mortality 
amenable to personal health care from the Global Burden 
of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 
(GBD 2015) to approximate access to and quality of 
personal health care in 195 countries and territories from 
1990 to 2015. Quantifying access to and quality of personal 
health care has many policy uses, and no consistent 
measures of personal health-care access and quality 
currently list across the development spectrum; for 
instance, the World Bank coverage index only includes 
three interventions,45 and the 2010–11 International Labour 
Organization’s indicator of formal health coverage covered 
93 countries, with substantial data missingness for sub-
Saharan Africa.46 The highly standardised cause of death 
estimates generated through GBD,47 along with risk factor 
exposure,48 can address several limitations associated with 
previous studies of amenable mortality. GBD provides 
comprehensive, comparable estimates of cause-specific 
death rates by geography, year, age, and sex through its 
extensive data correction processes to account for 
variations 
in 
cause 
of 
death 
certification.47 
The 
quantification of risk exposure and risk-attributable deaths 
due to 79 risk factors through GBD allows us to account for 
variations in risk exposure across geographies and time,48 
and thus helps to isolate variations in death rates due to 
personal health-care access and quality. We also examine 
the relationship between our measure of health-care access 
and quality, as defined by risk-standardised mortality rates 
amenable to health care, across development levels, as 
reflected by the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). Finally, 
we produce a frontier of maximum levels of personal 
health-care access and quality observed on the basis of 
SDI, which allows us to quantify the potential for further 
improvement in relation to development status.
Methods
Overview
We employed the most widely cited and used framework 
for assessing mortality amenable to personal health 
care.4,9,11,30,31,35 The Nolte and McKee cause list does not 
include all possible causes for which health care can 
improve survival; however, it does provide a set of 
conditions for which there is a reasonable consensus that 
personal health care has a major effect (table 1). Starting 
with this list, our analysis followed four steps: mapping 
the Nolte and McKee cause list to GBD causes; risk-
standardising mortality rates to remove variations in death 
rates not easily addressed through personal health care; 
computing a summary measure of personal health-care 
access and quality using principal component analysis 
(PCA); and assessing the highest recorded levels of health-
care access and quality across the development spectrum.

elsewhere.47–50 For the present analysis, a vital strength of 
GBD is its careful evaluation and correction of cause of 
death certification problems and misclassification at the 
national level. In the GBD, we systematically identified 
causes of death that could not or should not be underlying 
causes of death (so-called garbage codes), and applied 
established statistical algorithms to correct for and 
redistribute these deaths.51

Mapping the Nolte and McKee amenable cause list to the 
GBD cause list
Drawing from Nolte and McKee’s list of 33 causes 
amenable to personal health care,4,9,11,30,31,35 we mapped 
these conditions to the GBD cause list based on 
corresponding International Classification of Diseases 
(ICD) codes (appendix p 18). In GBD, thyroid diseases 
and benign prostatic hyperplasia are part of a larger 
residual category and thus were excluded. Diphtheria and 
tetanus are separate causes in GBD so we reported them 
individually. Because of its extensive processes used to 
consistently map and properly classify ICD causes over 
time,47,53 GBD supported the assessment of 32 causes on 
the Nolte and McKee cause list from 1990 to 2015.
Age-standardised risk-standardised death rates
Some variation in death rates for amenable causes are 
due to differences in behavioural and environmental risk 
exposure rather than differences in personal health-care 
access and quality.48,54,55 Using the wide range of risk 
factors assessed by GBD,48 we risk-standardised death 
rates to the global level of risk exposure.48 We did not risk-
standardise for variations in metabolic risk factors directly 
targeted by personal health care: systolic blood pressure, 
total cholesterol, and fasting plasma glucose. For example, 
stroke deaths due to high systolic blood pressure are 
amenable to primary care management of hypertension.
To risk-standardise death rates, we removed the joint 
effects of national behavioural and environmental risk 
levels calculated in GBD, and added back the global levels 
of risk exposure: 
where mjascy is the death rate from cause j in age a, sex s, 
location c, and year y; mrjascy is the risk-standardised death 
rate; JPAFjascy is the joint population attributable fraction 
(PAF) for cause j, in age a, sex s, country c, and year y for 
all behavioural and environmental risks included in 
GBD; and JPAFjasgy is the joint PAF for cause j, in age a, 
sex s, and year y at the global level.
GBD provides joint PAF estimation for multiple risks 
combined, which takes into account the mediation of 
different risks through each other. Further detail on 
joint PAF computation is available in the appendix 
(pp 5–8).
We used the GBD world population standard to 
calculate age-standardised risk-standardised death rates 
from each cause regarded as amenable to health care.47 
We did not risk-standardise death rates from diarrhoeal 
diseases as mortality attributable to unsafe water and 
sanitation was not computed for high-SDI locations; 
such standardisation could lead to higher risk-
standardised death rates in those countries compared 
with countries where mortality was attributed to unsafe 
water and sanitation.48 With all causes for which no PAFs 
are estimated in GBD, such as neonatal disorders and 
testicular cancer, risk-standardised death rates equalled 
observed death rates.
The effects of risk-standardisation are highlighted by 
comparing the log of age-standardised mortality rates to

the log of age-standardised risk-standardised mortality 
rates for amenable causes (appendix p 14). For each SDI 
quintile, many countries had differing levels of age-
standardised mortality rates but their risk-standardised 
mortality rates were similar, demonstrating how 
underlying local risk exposure can skew measures of 
mortality amenable to personal health care.
Construction of the Healthcare Access and Quality Index 
based on age-standardised risk standardised death rates
To construct the Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) 
Index, we first rescaled the log age-standardised risk-
standardised death rate by cause to a scale of 0 to 100 
such that the highest observed value from 1990 to 2015 
was 0 and the lowest was 100. To avoid the effects of 
fluctuating death rates in small populations on rescaling, 
we excluded populations less than 1 million population 
from setting minimum and maximum values. Any 
location with a cause-specific death rate below the 
minimum or above the maximum from 1990 to 2015 was 
set to 100 or 0, respectively.
Because each included cause provided some signal on 
average levels of personal health-care access and quality, 
we explored four approaches to construct the HAQ 
Index: PCA, exploratory factor analysis, arithmetic mean, 
and geometric mean. Details on these four approaches 
are in the appendix (pp 7, 8, 21, 22). All four measures 
were highly correlated, with Spearman’s rank order 
correlations exceeding rs=0·98. We selected the PCA-
derived HAQ Index because it provided the strongest 
correlations with six other currently available cross-
country measures of access to care or health-system 
inputs (table 
2). Three 
indicators 
came 
from 
the GBD Study 
2015: health expenditure per capita, hospital beds 
per 1000, and the UHC tracer intervention index, a 
composite measure of 11 UHC tracer interventions (four 
childhood vaccinations; skilled birth attendance; coverage 
of at least one and four antenatal care visits; met need for 
family planning with modern contraception; tuberculosis 
case detection rates; insecticide-treated net coverage; and 
antiretroviral therapy coverage for populations living 
with HIV).56 Three indicators came from WHO 
(physicians, nurses, and midwives per 1000),57 the 
International Labour Organization,46 and the World Bank 
(coverage index based on diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus 
vaccine coverage, coverage of at least four antenatal care 
visits, and proportion of children with diarrhoea receiving 
appropriate treatment).45 All indicators had correlation 
coefficients greater than 0·60, and three exceeded 0·80 
(health expenditure per capita, the UHC tracer index, 
and International Labour Organization formal health 
coverage).
The appendix (pp 21, 22) provides final rescaled PCA 
weights derived from the first five components that 
collectively accounted for more than 80% of the variance 
in cause-specific measures. Colon and breast cancer had 
negative PCA weights, which implied higher death rates 
were associated with better access and quality of care; 
because this cannot be true we set these weights to zero 
in the final PCA-derived HAQ Index. The appendix 
(p  15) compares each geography’s HAQ Index in 2015 
with the log of its age-standardised risk-standardised 
mortality rates.
Quantifying maximum levels of the HAQ Index across 
the development spectrum
To better understand maximum levels of personal health-
care access and quality potentially achievable across the 
development spectrum, we produced a frontier based on 
the relationship between the HAQ Index and SDI. We 
tested both stochastic frontier analysis models and data 
envelopment analysis; however, the relationship between 
SDI and the HAQ Index did not fit standard stochastic 
frontier analysis models,58 and data envelopment analysis 
cannot account for measurement error and is sensitive to 
outliers.59 To generate a frontier fit that closely follows the 
observed HAQ Index and allowed for measurement error, 
we used free disposal hull analysis on 1000 bootstrapped 
samples of the data.58 Every bootstrap included a subset 
of locations produced by randomly sampling (with 
replacement) from all GBD geographies. The final HAQ 
Index value was drawn from the uncertainty distribution 
for each location-year, with outliers removed by excluding 
super-efficient units; additional methodological detail can 
be found in the appendix (pp 9–12). Last, we used a Loess 
regression to produce a smooth frontier for each five-year 
interval from 1990 to 2015. For every geography, we report 
the maximum possible HAQ Index value on the basis of 
SDI in 1990 and 2015, while values for all years can be 
found in the appendix (pp 23–28).
Uncertainty analysis
GBD aims to propagate all sources of uncertainty 
through its estimation process,47,48 which results in 
uncertainty intervals (UIs) accompanying each point 
estimate of death by cause, geography, year, age group, 
and sex. We computed the HAQ Index for each 
geography-year based on 1000 draws from the posterior 
distribution for each included cause of death. We report 
95% UIs based on the ordinal 25th and 975th draws for 
each quantity of interest.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. The corresponding author had full access to 
all the data in the study and had final responsibility for 
the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Distinct geographic patterns emerged for overall HAQ 
Index levels and gains from 1990 to 2015 (figure 1). 
Andorra and Iceland had the highest HAQ Index in 1990, 
whereas most of sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia and

Figure 2: Figure 2: Performance of the HAQ Index and 25 individual causes by the fourth SDI quartile (A), third SDI quartile (B), second SDI quartile (C), 
and first SDI quartile (D) in 2015
In addition to the HAQ Index, all causes presented in this figure are scaled 0 to 100, with 100 being the “best” value (ie, lowest observed age-standardised 
risk-standardised mortality rate by cause) and 0 being the “worst value” (ie, highest observed age-standardised risk-standardised mortality rate by cause) between 
1990 and 2015. Within each SDI quartile, countries and geographies are ordered by their HAQ Index in 2015. HAQ Index=Healthcare Access and Quality Index. 
SDI=Socio-demographic Index.

several countries in Latin America and the Caribbean 
were in the first decile. By 2015, nearly all countries and 
territories saw increases in their HAQ Index, yet the gap 
between the highest and lowest HAQ Index levels was 
wider in 2015 (66·0) than in 1990 (61·6). The tenth decile 
included many countries in western Europe, Canada, 
Japan, and Australia, while the UK and the USA were 
in the ninth decile. Latin America and the Caribbean 
had varied HAQ Index levels, spanning from Haiti 
(first decile) to Chile (seventh decile). By 2015, Vietnam 
and Malaysia reached the sixth decile; China and 
Thailand rose to the seventh decile; and Turkey and 
several countries in the Middle East and Eastern Europe 
improved to the eighth decile. In sub-Saharan Africa, 
Cape Verde (fifth decile), Namibia, South Africa, Gabon, 
and Mauritania (fourth decile) had the highest HAQ 
Index levels in 2015, rising from their positions since 
1990. At the same time, many sub-Saharan African 
countries remained in the first decile in 2015, including 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Niger, and 
Zambia. In Asia and the Pacific, a number of countries 
also experienced relatively low HAQ Index levels: 
Afghanistan and Papua New Guinea (first decile); 
Pakistan and India (second decile); and Indonesia, 
Cambodia, and Myanmar (third decile).
Comparing the overall HAQ Index with its component 
parts showed substantial heterogeneity in 2015, even 
within similar SDI quartiles (figure 2). Within the fourth 
SDI quartile, most geographies performed well on several 
vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, diph-
theria, tetanus, and whooping cough, yet some experienced 
lower values for communicable conditions such as lower 
respiratory infections. Geographies in the fourth SDI 
quartile generally performed worse for cancers, but many 
recorded values exceeding 90 for cervical and uterine 
cancers. Nearly all geographies in the fourth SDI quartile

surpassed 90 for maternal disorders, while geographies in 
the third and second SDI quartiles showed far more 
diverse results. A similar pattern emerged in causes for 
which routine surgeries can easily avert mortality (eg, 
appendicitis and hernias) among third and second SDI 
quartile geographies, with some countries performing 
fairly well for such causes (eg, China, Turkey, Sri Lanka) 
while others lagged behind (eg, Mexico, Indonesia, South 
Africa). Many geographies in the third and second SDI 
quartiles not only had fairly low values for NCDs such as 
diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and hypertensive heart 
disease, but also fared poorly on a subset of infectious 
diseases (ie, tuberculosis, lower respiratory infections, and 
diarrhoeal diseases) and neonatal disorders. In the first 
SDI 
quartile, 
neonatal 
and 
maternal 
disorders, 
tuberculosis, lower respiratory infections, and diarrhoeal 
diseases often led to the lowest scaled values, while most 
geographies experienced relatively better performances for 
a subset of cancers. Notably, several countries in the 
first SDI quartile recorded fairly high values for vaccine-
preventable diseases. By contrast, nearly all of these 
countries and territories saw values lower than 50 for 
causes associated with routine surgeries and more 
complex case management (eg, epilepsy, diabetes, and 
chronic kidney disease).
For nearly all countries and territories, the HAQ Index 
has markedly improved since 1990, with 167 recording 
statistically significant increases by 2015 (figure 3). 
Because of incomplete data systems, uncertainty bounds 
were relatively large for lower-SDI countries, whereas 
uncertainty for higher-SDI countries—places where data 
systems are more complete and of high quality—was 
much smaller. Five countries with the largest significant 
increases for the HAQ Index were South Korea (high 
SDI), Turkey and Peru (high-middle SDI), and China 
and the Maldives (middle SDI). Among low-middle-SDI 
and low-SDI countries, Laos and Ethiopia saw among 
the greatest improvements in the HAQ Index; however, 
these gains were less pronounced due to wide 
uncertainty bounds.
Based on a frontier analysis, we found that, as SDI 
increases, the highest observed HAQ Index values also

rose (figure 4). Further, maximum HAQ Index levels 
achieved generally improved since 1990 across levels of 
SDI. Table 3 details each geography’s HAQ Index values 
for 5-year intervals from 1990 to 2015, as well as their 
frontier HAQ Index levels on the basis of a location’s 
SDI. Measuring the distance between a geography’s 
observed HAQ Index in 1990 and 2015 and its frontier for 
these years provides a benchmark for potential gains in 
health-care access and quality—a metric that also 
considers the geography’s relative resources on the basis 
of SDI. Additionally, comparing how differences between 
a given place’s observed HAQ Index and frontier change 
over time can show where personal health-care access 
and quality have improved in parallel with changes in 
development.
Worldwide, 
the 
average 
HAQ 
Index 
values 
significantly increased, but the average global frontier 
improved in tandem; subsequently, gaps between the 
global HAQ Index and frontier changed minimally 
between 1990 and 2015. While most regions recorded 
narrowing gaps between average HAQ Index values and 
maximum levels achieved, a subset saw negligible 
progress or widening differences (eg, southern sub-
Saharan Africa, south Asia, and the Middle East). In 
2015, 52 countries and territories had HAQ Index 
estimates that included the frontier within their 
uncertainty bounds, indicating these geographies met 
the maximum levels of personal health-care access and 
quality attained by locations of similar SDI. Conversely, 
62 geographies fell further behind the HAQ Index 
frontier associated with their level of SDI; this trend was 
especially pronounced in much of southern sub-
Saharan Africa, Iraq, Pakistan, and Honduras (figure 5). 
This result was in stark contrast with several countries 
in eastern and western sub-Saharan Africa (eg, Burundi, 
Comoros, Rwanda), Turkey, Peru, and South Korea, 
many of which more than halved the differences 
between their HAQ Index and frontiers given their SDI 
by 2015.
Discussion
Drawing from GBD 2015, we constructed a novel measure 
of personal health-care access and quality—the HAQ 
Index—by using highly standardised estimates of 
32 different causes that are amenable to personal health 
care. Compared with previous efforts, the HAQ Index 
provides a clearer signal on personal health-care access 
and quality over time and place because GBD provides 
enhanced comparability of cause of death data, helps to 
account for variation due to behavioural and environmental 
risk factors, and includes 195 countries and territories 
over time. Our analysis showed large differences in 
personal health-care access and quality, spanning from a 
low of 23·1 in Ethiopia in 1990 to higher than 90 in 
Andorra, Iceland, Switzerland, Norway, and Sweden in 
2015. The global HAQ Index improved from 40·7 in 1990 
to 53·7 in 2015, and 167 of 195 countries and territories 
significantly increased their HAQ Index during this time. 
Although the HAQ Index and SDI were highly correlated, 
we noted substantial heterogeneity for geographies at 
similar SDI. If every location reached the highest observed 
HAQ Index experienced by level of SDI, our global 
measure of health-care access and quality could have 
reached 73·8 in 2015—a clear indicator of untapped 
potential for health-care improvement worldwide.
While most countries saw progress on the HAQ Index 
since 1990, the marked improvements recorded for 
countries including South Korea, Turkey, and China 
highlight that much more rapid advances are possible. A 
subset of countries narrowed the gap between observed 
personal health-care access and quality and what could be 
expected given their level of development—and then 
achieved gains beyond what might be anticipated on 
the basis of SDI. Peru, the Maldives, and Ethiopia are 
examples of such stand-out geographies for reaching 
higher-than-expected levels of personal health care and 
access since 1990. Case studies conducted by the World 
Bank highlight potential drivers of these countries’ 
successes,60 and additional research on how certain

health-system 
attributes, 
including 
financing 
arrangements, provider ownership, and stewardship 
functions, are related to personal health-care access and 
quality is warranted. Separating out measures of access 
from quality of care received would be ideal, especially 
because programmatic and policy options to address 
barriers in access and quality can differ across and within 
countries. Nonetheless, such information measured in a 
consistent manner is rarely available.34,46,57,60
Several geographies had minimal gains in reducing the 
difference between their observed HAQ Index and the 
highest levels achieved at a similar SDI—a warning sign 
that heightened health-care access and quality is not an 
inevitable product of increased development. Further, 
a subset of countries in southern sub-Saharan Africa, 
south Asia, and the Middle East saw widening gaps 
between HAQ Index values in 2015 and the frontier 
reached by countries of comparable SDI. These findings 
could reflect several challenges faced by these countries, 
including subnational inequalities in both wealth and 
health-care options; and recent or rapid epidemiological 
transitions wherein the health-care sector and cause-
specific services offered trail behind the diseases 
afflicting populations. Along with examining the drivers 
of greater-than-expected gains, future studies should 
strive to understand why other countries are lagging 
behind—and how they can pursue advancing health-care 
access and quality for all individuals.
Improving personal health-care access and quality is an 
important priority in the SDG era, emphasising the 
potential utility of the HAQ Index for SDG monitoring. At 
present, the UHC target—SDG 3.8—focuses mainly on 
so-called tracer interventions in the areas of maternal and 
child health, reproductive health, and a subset of infectious 
diseases,61 and thus fails to adequately capture the vital 
role of personal health care for NCDs and injuries. The 
HAQ Index provides a more comprehensive measure that 
reflects health-system capacity for effectively detecting 
risk for, managing, and preventing early death from a 
range of conditions. Combining the HAQ Index, coverage 
of health interventions, and prevalence of risk factors that 
are modifiable through public health initiatives could 
provide a more robust mechanism for tracking UHC 
progress across multiple dimensions of health-system 
action.
Health systems can provide differential access and 
quality across therapeutic areas and levels of care. The 
HAQ Index reflects the average experience as captured 
by included conditions, and does not currently 
distinguish between diseases more strongly related to 
primary or secondary care. Our PCA weights suggest 
some conditions are less highly correlated with other 
causes, including colon cancer, breast cancer, testicular 
cancer, non-melanoma skin cancer, or diphtheria. The 
comparatively low weights on these outcomes could 
reflect measurement error, residual challenges in risk 
standardisation, or health-system heterogeneity by level 
of care. Subnational work that identifies variation in 
personal health-care access and quality within a particular 
health-system structure, and that uses multi-method 
approaches to view the health system from the 
perspective of patients and frontline providers,62,63 may 
help elucidate whether some health-system components 
function distinctly from its average. For example, access 
to and quality of oncology care might be relatively distinct 
from other health-system dimensions and, where 
appropriate treatment is contingent on specialists or 
particular equipment, such as radiotherapy for cancer, 
even a temporary loss of these resources may substantially 
affect outcomes.64 Conversely, access to high-quality 
primary care services, which enable early detection of 
conditions that are fatal if diagnosed at later stages, can 
be shaped by different factors, such as flexibility of clinic 
hours or types of insurance providers accepted.65
Mortality amenable to personal health care and mortality 
attributable to modifiable behavioural and environmental 
risk factors
For the present study, we based the HAQ Index on the list 
of causes established by Nolte and McKee,4,9,11,30,31,35 and did 
not systematically re-examine scientific literature to update 
causes for which personal health care can significantly 
improve outcomes. Conducting this kind of systematic 
review is crucial to identifying additional causes for 
inclusion in the HAQ Index. Numerous causes should be 
considered, and would likely result in adding antiretroviral 
therapy for HIV, artemisinin-based combination therapies 
for malaria, treatment of hepatitis C, and improvements in 
emergency and trauma care, among others.41,42,66–69 
Expanding the amenable cause list should be determined 
by clear criteria that define when health care sufficiently 
reduces cause-specific mortality and thus provides a strong 
enough signal about access and quality. Such additions 
will probably improve the HAQ Index, though the nature 
of PCA estimation and its measurement of common 
variance across 32 causes may not substantially change 
future results. This analysis stemmed from existing 
scientific literature on mortality amenable to health care, 
but personal health care also can have profound effects on 
non-fatal health outcomes (eg, hip replacement for 
oesteoarthritis or surgery for cataracts). Future updates of 
the HAQ Index should consider incorporating measures 
of non-fatal conditions amenable to personal health care, 
which would then capture health-system capacity to deliver 
health gains through improved functional health status.
Understanding how much mortality or disease burden 
is avertable based on providing access to high-quality 
personal health care and modifying behavioural and 
environmental risks through public health initiatives is 
of high policy interest. GBD currently assesses mortality 
and burden attributable to a large set of risk factors, 
which supplies useful insights on the potential of risk 
modification to improve health. Quantification of the 
full potential of personal health care to reduce burden

by cause would provide an important additional piece 
of policy-relevant information. Controlling for other 
factors through statistical modelling, such as income and 
educational attainment, we could examine how much 
cause-specific variation relates to the HAQ Index. Such 
work would help to pinpoint opportunities for national 
and 
subnational 
progress 
through 
health-system 
improvements, which would likely include public health 
programmes and policies as well as the organisation and 
delivery of personal health services across levels of care.
Moving to performance measurement
In estimating the HAQ Index frontier by SDI,58 we 
quantified the gap between observed personal health-
care access and quality and levels potentially achievable 
at a given level of SDI. With these analyses, we lay the 
foundation for a refined assessment of health-system 
performance. The World Health Report 2000, which 
sought to evaluate health-system performance by 
country,70 estimated the contribution of health systems 
for improving healthy life expectancy while statistically 
controlling for other factors. As suggested by Nolte and 
McKee,9,71 using a measure more directly related to 
health-system actions, such as mortality amenable to 
personal health care, could reduce the need to control for 
other factors in health-system performance assessment. 
The World Health Report 2000 framework used five broad 
dimensions—average levels of health, inequalities in 
health, average levels of health-system performance, 
inequalities in responsiveness, and fair financing—and 
then compared overall health system attainment based 
on a frontier for health expenditure per capita.71 Our 
current analysis only focused on the contribution of 
personal health care to mortality and the potential for 
improvement in this domain relative to development. In 
the future, GBD could support examining subnational 
health inequalities and expanding into health finance 
quantification of financial risk protection. A stronger 
empirical basis for assessing these three domains of 
health-system performance would also facilitate testing a 
range of efficiency and performance models.
Our frontier analysis showed that the highest observed 
HAQ Index levels, as achieved by geographies with an 
SDI of 0·8 or higher, steadily shifted higher over time. 
This expansion of health-care access and quality may 
reflect a rising share of GDP allocated to health among 
high-SDI countries. However, the frontier estimate for 
GDP per capita spent on health points to a similar shift 
upward at high expenditure. One explanation of this trend 
is new medical technologies and programmes, which 
could be driving an overall upward shift in health-care 
access and quality achievable in well financed systems. 
Another potential explanation is innovation in health-care 
organisation, such as the creation of centralised stroke 
care units in major cities.72 A more detailed examination 
of these changes may further elucidate how investing in 
medical innovations can affect health-system performance. 
In particular, this might shed light on the association 
between investment in health-care resources and 
outcomes, a relationship that is unlikely to be linear. For 
instance, audits have identified three main factors 
underlying maternal deaths: sub 
standard care, delays in 
care, and problems with blood transfusions.73 Addressing 
the latter requires a different type of intervention, namely 
investments in infrastructure, than the former two factors. 
Such knowledge is of particular importance in the SDG 
era, as some studies point to advances in medical 
technology and innovation as the primary pathway for 
elevating health alongside increasing development.74
HAQ Index compared to other measures of access and 
quality of care
Detailed results on HAQ Index components seem 
consistent with previous, albeit limited, studies on health-
care performance. Within Europe, Nordic countries 
performed especially well, corresponding with past work 
on a composite measure of public health policies.75 Country 
performance on diabetes aligned with earlier work on 
diabetes mortality and incidence,25 wherein country-level 
differences were largely explained by known health-system 
changes, such as substantial improvements in several 
Baltic states during the late 1990s. In Latin America, 
Costa Rica’s relatively high HAQ Index (72·9), as compared 
with 
nearby 
countries 
(eg, 
Nicaragua 
[64·3], 
Guatemala [55·7]), is consistent with its designation as an 
original “good health at low cost” country.76
In view of the paucity of standard health-care access and 
quality measures, assessing HAQ Index validity compared 
to other indicators was challenging. In this analysis, we 
identified three measures of health-system resources and 
three measures of intervention coverage that included 
at least 70 countries. These correlations, which all 
exceeded 0·60, offer some evidence of convergent validity 
but do not provide criterion validity.77,78 Nonetheless, these 
results are encouraging and stand in contrast to previous 
studies done in limited settings.37–40 In comparison with 
past work,9,11,31 the moderately high correlation with other 
health-care indicators might be due to our efforts to risk-
standardise mortality amenable to health care; PCA 
weighting of different amenable conditions; and the 
inclusion of a substantively larger, more diverse set of 
health systems across the development spectrum. 
Additional validation analyses are needed to compare 
HAQ Index performance with other measures of health-
care access and quality; such validation exercises might be 
more feasible at the subnational level with greater data 
density, such as states in the USA.79
Limitations
This analysis has a number of limitations beyond those 
already described. First, many limitations experienced in 
GBD cause of death estimation are applicable to this 
study.47 Second, our risk-standardisation procedure might 
not represent all possible risk-outcome pairs as they 
 Articles

www.thelancet.com   Vol 390   July 15, 2017
pertain to included causes of amenable mortality 
(eg, determinants of testicular cancer or neonatal 
disorders).48 With its annual updates, GBD aims to improve 
upon its comparative risk assessment, and thus HAQ 
Index assessment is likely to be improved alongside 
advances in risk quantification. Third, two causes received 
negative weights in the PCA analysis and were 
subsequently excluded. One potential explanation for this 
is that joint PAFs for these causes may underestimate risk-
attributable mortality in high-SDI countries (eg, the effects 
of diet, obesity, and physical inactivity for breast cancer). 
However, given the high Spearman’s rank order correlation 
between the average of all 32 causes and the HAQ Index, 
excluding these causes from the PCA likely had minimal 
effect on our results. Fourth, we used PCA to construct the 
HAQ Index based on age-standardised risk-standardised 
death rates from the 32 causes. Alternative methods for 
index construction led to highly correlated results, but 
exact rankings somewhat varied. We subsequently view 
exact rank orders as less useful than comparing a given 
geography’s HAQ Index values over time, to countries of 
similar SDI, and relative to the HAQ Index frontier. Fifth, 
while the HAQ Index offers a more robust indicator of 
overall health-care access and quality than currently 
available measures, it does not directly capture effects of 
personal health care on causes without substantial 
mortality (eg, depression, hip oesteoarthritis, and 
cataracts). The effects of health care on both fatal and non-
fatal conditions may be highly correlated, but incorporating 
how access and quality of care explicitly affect non-fatal 
outcomes would improve measurement. Sixth, GBD 
corrections for cause of death misclassifications (so-called 
garbage codes) varies substantially by geography and thus 
can affect results. Even among high-SDI countries, GBD 
showed substantial variation for the proportion of 
amenable deaths assigned to garbage codes, ranging from 
7·9% in Finland to 39·8% in Portugal (appendix p 19). 
Seventh, for countries with complete or nearly complete 
vital registration (VR) data and few deaths misclassified 
based on ICD codes, the HAQ Index may be more robust 
and less prone to high levels of uncertainty than for 
countries with lower-quality or non-existent VR data. 
Mortality estimates that heavily draw from verbal autopsy 
data or other modelling approaches have larger UIs. Our 
results for most of sub-Saharan Africa, for example, 
include wide UIs and thus few countries recorded HAQ 
Index values that statistically differed from the regional 
mean. Eighth, we rescale the log age-standardised risk-
standardised death rate for each cause from 0 to 100 using 
the observed range across countries from 1990 to 2015, but 
achieving 100 does not mean that additional improvement 
is not possible. Subsequently, the HAQ Index range 
reported here is relative to national achievements to date, 
and these thresholds may rise if or when improved 
personal health-care access and quality occurs for given 
causes. Ninth, the HAQ Index does not currently capture 
subnational inequalities in personal health-care access and 
quality, which might emerge on the basis of geographic 
location or socioeconomic status, among other factors. 
Future efforts to quantify these measures with greater 
geospatial resolution should be prioritised.
Conclusions
Our analysis demonstrates that a policy-relevant summary 
measure of personal health-care access and quality can be 
derived from GBD. This novel measure supports the first-
ever comparable assessment of personal health-care 
access and quality across 195 countries and territories, 
over time, and along the development spectrum. The 
HAQ Index considerably advances previous efforts to 
approximate personal health-care access and quality by 
systematically adjusting for cause of death certification 
biases and misclassification, risk-standardising death 
rates across geographies, and applying PCA to identify 
common dimensions of health-care access and quality 
associated with multiple conditions. Globally, most 
countries and territories recorded gains in personal 
health-care access and quality from 1990 to 2015, yet many 
still experienced levels that fell well below what has been 
achieved by geographies at a similar development status. 
Amid calls to improve monitoring of UHC and overall 
health-system performance, the HAQ Index provides a 
strong basis for benchmarking progress toward greater 
access and higher-quality personal health care alongside 
country-level gains in resources to achieve these aims.
