Spinal cord injury (SCI), involving damaged axons and glial scar tissue, often culminates
in irreversible impairments. Achieving substantial recovery following complete spinal cord
transection remains an unmet challenge. Here, we report of implantation of an engineered
3D construct embedded with human oral mucosa stem cells (hOMSC) induced to
secrete neuroprotective, immunomodulatory, and axonal elongation-associated factors,
in a complete spinal cord transection rat model. Rats implanted with induced
tissue engineering constructs regained fine motor control, coordination and walking
pattern in sharp contrast to the untreated group that remained paralyzed (42
vs. 0%). Immunofluorescence, CLARITY, MRI, and electrophysiological assessments
demonstrated a reconnection bridging the injured area, as well as presence of increased
number of myelinated axons, neural precursors, and reduced glial scar tissue in
recovered animals treated with the induced cell-embedded constructs. Finally, this
construct is made of bio-compatible, clinically approved materials and utilizes a safe
and easily extractable cell population. The results warrant further research with regards
to the effectiveness of this treatment in addressing spinal cord injury.

INTRODUCTION
Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in structural and functional damage to neural circuitry, arising from
axon loss, local inflammation, glial scarring, and progressive tissue cavitation extending beyond the
boundaries of the primary lesion (Cregg et al., 2014). Allograft nerve transplantation, cell therapy,
and implantation of engineered tissue have achieved partial functional recovery in SCI rodents
(Ramon-Cueto et al., 2000; Coumans et al., 2001; Cao et al., 2004; Fouad et al., 2005; Guo et al.,
2007; Pan et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2012, 2014). Cell therapy relying on autologous cells capable of
inducing neuroprotective and regenerative processes would be of significant potential for future
clinical purposes. Several types of autologous cells present attributes rendering them promising

candidates for effective cell therapy. Mesenchymal stromal cells
from various sources and olfactory ensheathing cells are the
most studied cell types for autologous transplantation, showing
efficacy to ameliorate SCI in animal models and also in early
human clinical trials (Tabakow et al., 2013; Jarocha et al.,
2014; Kakabadze et al., 2016; Assinck et al., 2017; Melo et al.,
2017). These can be used in combination with scaffolds, genetic
engineering, medium-based induction or co-transplanted with
other cell types (Assinck et al., 2017). Other cell types such
as induced pluripotent-derived cells (Khazaei et al., 2016),
dental pulp stem cells (Sakai et al., 2012), neural progenitors
grafts (Lu et al., 2014; Kadoya et al., 2016) showed efficacy in
treating SCI in animal models. Human oral mucosa stem cells
(hOMSCs) exhibit a neural crest-like stem cell phenotype, high
expandability, which persists for over 70 cumulative population
doublings, low interdonor heterogeneity and a negligible effect
of aging on clonogenicity, growth and differentiation (Marynka-
Kalmani et al., 2010). We recently reported that hOMSCs can be
induced into astrocyte-like cells, which exhibit elevated secretion
of neurotophic factors (NTFs), provide neuroprotection to motor
neurons in vitro and enhance neural repair in rats with sciatic
nerve injury (Ganz et al., 2014).
Tissue engineered (TE) scaffolds provide a 3D environment
in which cells can attach, grow and differentiate, maintain
cell
distribution,
and
provide
graft
protection
following
transplantation (Levenberg and Langer, 2004). Biodegradable
scaffolds are of special importance for spinal cord repair since
they can provide the initial protection for grafted cells and
guidance for axons, while degrading after these processes are
completed. We have shown that biodegradable poly(l-lactic
acid)(PLLA)/polylactic-glycolic acid (PLGA) scaffolds support
proliferation, differentiation, and organization of embedded
olfactory bulb-derived cells, enhancing their NTF secretion
(Blumenthal et al., 2013; Shandalov et al., 2014). PLGA was
selected to provide flexibility, whereas the PLLA was chosen
to provide stiffness. Thus, the biomechanical properties of the
scaffold depend on the ratio of PLLA and PLGA used, allowing
tuning of its stiffness and its micro-pores’ shape (Levy-Mishali
et al., 2009; Lesman et al., 2011). For this study we used 50%
PLLA and 50% PLGA porous scaffolds, which feature porous
structure compatible with cell culture, easily implantable, and
estimated to degrade in ∼60 days (Teng et al., 2002).
Furthermore, such scaffolds can act as a reservoir for
secreted NTFs, creating gradients capable of both supporting
morphogenesis and potentiating their actions (Blumenthal
et al., 2013). Based on this evidence, we hypothesized that
an implantable TE construct consisting of induced-hOMSCs
embedded in a fibrin/PLLA/PLGA matrix may act as a multi-
effector device capable of enhancing endogenous regenerative
processes
and
promoting
neurological
recovery
following
complete spinal cord transection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Naïve hOMSC Cell Culture
After obtaining signed informed consent and the approval of the
Institutional Helsinki Committee at the Baruch Padeh Medical
Center, Poria, Israel, hOMSCs were isolated from oral mucosa
biopsies, collected by Dr. Shareef Araidy and Dr. Sammy Pour.
Briefly, biopsies were incubated overnight at 4◦C in dispase
(Sigma, Israel). Then, the epithelial layer was separated from the
lamina propria and the latter was minced into 0.5 mm3 pieces
and placed in 35 mm culture dishes (Nunc). Expansion medium
was gently added to the explants to enhance their attachment
to the floor of the dish. Cells that migrated from the explant to
the culture dishes were harvested with 0.25% trypsin (Biological
Industries, Beit-Haemek, Israel) and seeded at a cell density of
4 × 104 cells/cm2. Cells were passaged at 70–80% confluence.
hOMSCs were cultured in expansion medium consisting of
low-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, supplemented
with 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 100 U/ml penicillin (Biological
Industries, Beit-Haemek, Israel), 2 mM glutamine (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Gibco),
as described by Marynka-Kalmani et al. (2010). All experiments
used hOMSCs at passages 4–10. Three different donor tissues
were used to form the constructs tested.
PLLA/PLGA Scaffold Preparation
Porous sponges composed of 50% PLLA and 50% PLGA were
fabricated utilizing a particulate leaching technique to achieve
pore sizes of 212–600 µm and 93% porosity. Briefly, PLLA
(Polysciences) and PLGA (Boehringer Ingelheim) were dissolved
1:1 in chloroform to yield a 5% (w/v) polymer solution; 0.24 ml
of this solution was loaded into molds packed with 0.4 g
sodium chloride particles. The solvent was allowed to evaporate
overnight, and the sponges were subsequently immersed, for 8 h,
in distilled water (changed every hour) to leach the salt and create
an interconnected, porous structure. Final PLLA/PLGA sponges
were 3 × 3 mm, and 1 mm thick. Before use, sponges were soaked
overnight in 70% (v/v) ethyl alcohol and then three times in
PBS. Previous works have demonstrated the biocompatibility and
biodegradability of PLLA/PLGA porous scaffolds and estimated
its degradation time to be about 30–60 days (Teng et al., 2002).
hOMSC Seeding and Differentiation
Naïve
hOMSCs
were
harvested
with
trypsin
(Biological
Industries, Israel), counted and aliquoted (5 × 105 cells/tube).
Cells were suspended in 3.5 µl human thrombin (Sigma, Israel),
followed by addition of 3.5 µl human fibrinogen (Sigma, Israel),
and then immediately seeded on PLLA/PLGA scaffolds in a
non-tissue culture plate. Acellular scaffold were seeded with
fibrinogen and thrombin without cells. We allowed cells in
seeded scaffolds to attach and fibrin to polymerize for 30 min in
37◦C, 5% CO2, at high humidity. hOMSC expansion medium
(1 mL) was then added to each scaffold. The next day, a
two-step medium-based consisting the first of basic fibroblast
growth factor 2 (R&D Systems) and 20 ng/ml epidermal growth
factor (R&D Systems) was started. Following 72 h, the second
differentiation step was initiated. Cells were incubated in
serum-free medium (DMEM low glucose/SPN/glutamine) with
the addition of 1 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Sigma-Aldrich),
0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) (Sigma-Aldrich),
50 ng/ml Neuregulin, and 1 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF; PeproTech Asia, Rehovot, Israel) for an additional 72 h.

Acellular scaffolds were cultured for 6 days in growth medium
(Figure 1A).
Viability Assay
To assess cell viability, scaffolds were loaded with calcein
acetoxymethyl ester (calcein AM; 1 µmol/L) and ethidium
homodimer-1 (4 µmol/L) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 50 min at 37◦C, on
a 3D XYZ shaker. Scaffolds were then washed thrice with PBS and
visualized using a confocal microscope. Cell viability was assessed
before implantation.
Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR
Total RNA from hOMSCs induced on scaffolds or in cell
culture plates (n = 3/group) was isolated using the TRI reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the supplier’s
recommendations. RNA (2 µg) was reverse transcribed with
random primers and SuperScriptIII (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). Real-time PCR of the genes of interest was performed
in a StepOnePlusTM (Applied Biosystems), using PlatinumR
SYBRR Green qPCR SuperMix UDG with ROX (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). PCR amplification was performed over
40 cycles (program: 2 min at 50◦C, 2 min at 95◦C, 40 repeats
of 15 s at 95◦C and 30 s at 60◦C). Data were quantified
using the ��Ct method, and normalized to the lactate
dehydrogenase A (LDHA) housekeeping gene. �Ct of naïve
cultures served as baseline values. Data are presented as the
mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) change from the
baseline.

Spinal Cord Injury and Construct
Implantation
All animal experiments were performed in strict compliance
with protocols approved by the Technion—Israel Institute of
Technology and Tel Aviv University Ethics Committees (IL
040032012). In line with these guidelines, rats that performed
self-mutilation or lost more than 20% body weight after surgery
were excluded from the experiment. Animal randomization was
performed by an experimenter blinded to the treatments. Adult
female Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with a mixture of
xylazine (10–15 mg/kg) and ketamine (60–90 mg/kg) and with
a maintenance dose of isoflurane (Harvard Apparatus, USA)
during surgery. After laminectomy at the 9th−11th thoracic
vertebral levels, the spinal cord was completely transected at the
T10 level, using a microscissor (Kent Scientific, USA). The rostral
and caudal stumps were lifted to ensure complete transection
and a hook (Kent Scientific, USA) was passed circularly inside
the generated gap to confirm that no fibers remained at the
bottom part of the spine canal. The groups evaluated in this study
were designated as none (no scaffold or cells), acellular scaffold
(scaffold with no cells), naïve (scaffold with naïve hOMSC), and
induced (scaffold with induced hOMSC into a neural phenotype).
The lesion in rats assigned to the “none” group was then
sutured as described below. For the other treatment groups,
PLLA/PLGA scaffolds were inserted between both caudal and
rostral parts of the spinal cord and sealed with an acellular
PLLA/PLGA scaffold. An additional PLLA/PLGA scaffold was
placed over the transected site and over the exposed rostral
and caudal regions of the cord to provide structural support
and minimize friction between the spinal cord and the vertebra
bone (Figure 2A). Muscle layers and skin were then sutured
and the rats were placed in temperature-controlled incubation
chambers until they awoke. They were then transferred to cages,
and bladder massages were applied twice daily until bladder
function was regained. Antibiotics (Solvasol, 10 mg/kg body
weight) were injected daily for 1 week. Buprenorphine (Bayer)
was administered at a dose of 0.01–0.05 mg/kg before surgery
and 3 days after. Ciclosporin (10 mg/kg/d) (Novartis) was
administered daily to all rats 1 day before surgery and for 5 days
post-surgery. The identity of each rat within each experimental
group remained coded until the end of the experiment and
data analysis. Surgeries were carried out by three independent
investigators and crosschecked to minimize influence of human
factors.
Motor Analysis in Spinal Cord Injury
Two independent blinded observers, who did not participate
in the surgeries or construct implantation, evaluated and
scored rat behavior. Rats were given random numbers and the
examiners were blinded to treatments, reporting results per
rat without any further information regarding the treatment
each animal received. Functional recovery and gait was assessed
and scored using BBB tests (Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan
locomotor scale method; de Medinaceli et al., 1982; Basso
et al., 1995). Throughout the experiment, the following exclusion
criteria were applied: (a) A BBB ≥4 three days after surgery,
indicated partial transection. (b) Self-mutilation resulting in
loss of one digit or more of the hind limbs. (c) Substantial
weight loss (see Supplementary Table 2). The assays were
performed on a setup enabling simultaneous photography of
the sagittal and coronal planes. Measurements were made 1–
4 d following implantation, followed by measurements every
7 days. All measurements were made at the same time of
day to avoid circadian variability. Baseline BBB was defined as
the value recorded at the first test after surgery. The weekly
score was the lowest score obtained during each calendar
week.
Immunofluorescence
Naïve and Induced hOMSC Analysis
Cells were fixed in 4% PFA (n = 5 scaffolds/group). Samples
were blocked with 5% goat serum, 1% BSA, and 0.05%
Triton-X in PBS for 2 h, and then incubated with rat

with
4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI)
(1:1,000,

Spinal Cord Analysis
Rats were sacrificed with CO2 and immediately perfused with 4%
PFA. Spinal cords were dissected, embedded in optimal cutting
temperature compound (OCT) and longitudinally sectioned
(20 µm) using a cryostat (Leica CM1850, Germany). Five
interspaced sections from five animals in each respective group,
were used for the analysis. Sections were blocked with 5%
goat serum, 1% BSA, and 0.05% Triton-X in PBS for 2 h,
and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at
4◦C. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-
b III-tubulin (1:2,000, Abcam, ab18207, Chen et al., 2010),
rabbit anti-GAP-43 (1:1,000, Millipore, Kawaja et al., 2011),
rat anti-GFAP (1:5,000, Life sciences, 13-0300, clone 2.2B10,
Zoltewicz et al., 2012), rat anti-CD11b (1:1,000, Abcam, ab8878,
clone M1/70, Fulmer et al., 2014), rat anti-MBP (1:1,000,
Abcam, ab62631, clone MBP101, Kwon et al., 2014), mouse
anti-human nuclei (1:2,000, Millipore, MAB1281, clone 235-
1, Varela et al., 2012), mouse anti-CSPG (1:500, Millipore,
MAB5284, clone cat-301, Andrews et al., 2012), mouse anti-
NF200 (1:1,000, Abcam, ab24574, Tokuda et al., 2015) and
mouse anti-nestin (1:200, Millipore, MAB353, clone rat-401, Lee
et al., 2012). For immunofluorescence staining, sections were
incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse (H+L)
(1:500, Molecular probes, A-11001), goat anti-rabbit (H+L)
(1:500, Molecular probes, A-11034) or goatanti-rat (H+L) (1:500,
Molecular probes, A-11006) antibodies, or with Alexa 568-
conjugated goat anti-mouse (H+L) (1:500, Molecular probes,
A-11031) or goat anti-rabbit (1:500, Molecular probes, A-
11036). Nuclear DNA was stained with DAPI (1:1000). For
immunohistochemistry, hematoxylin, and eosin staining was
performed. Sections from the same rats were used for
immunochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses. Using
custom-made MATLAB software, the region of interest (ROI)
was manually defined to exclude the non-scaffold area. The
resultant image was decomposed to blue, green, and red channels.
For each channel, an adaptive threshold filter was applied
at 35% of the maximum intensity value to remove noise.
Subsequent processing and noise filtration were achieved by
applying the erosion morphological operator. To quantify the
relative area covered by an IHC indicator, the total pixelated
area was calculated and normalized to the actual area of the
ROI. To compare the myelination of axons between the groups
we evaluated and quantified expression of MBP in elongated
areas, suggesting presence of myelinated axons. MATLAB scripts
were programmed to automatically count elongated elements
representing axons in MBP immunofluorescence images. Images
were cleaned using morphological operators (erosion). The
resultant binary image was segmented by selecting connected
areas. Areas larger than a certain threshold were automatically
excluded from the ROI to avoid miscalculation of large
bundles of connected neurons. For each region, second-order
moments were calculated to obtain major and minor axis
lengths. All areas containing a major to minor axis ratio
>5 indicating the matching ellipse has one axis at least five
times larger than the other axis were identified as elongated
axons. The number of elongated axons in each image was
counted. Data are presented as mean ± SEM, One-way
ANOVA, with the Bonferroni post-hoc test, evaluated statistical
differences between the groups (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p <
0.001).
MRI-DTI
MRI Protocol
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, with the
assistance of Bioimage Ltd., in a 7T MRI system (Bruker,
Germany), using a 20 mm surface coil placed on the back of
the rat, at the injury site. Rats were anesthetized using 1–3%
isoflurane and maintained at 37◦C; breathing was monitored
with a respiratory sensor (n = 3/group). The MRI protocol
included the following sequences:
T2 RARE
Sagittal T2-weighted imaging was performed in order to localize
the axial slices in the correct location, including upstream
and downstream regions adjacent to the injury site. T2 RARE
included the following parameters: TR/TE = 1,200/16, RARE
factor = 4, no. of averages = 4, 20 slices of 0.8 mm, in-plane
resolution of 0.17 × 0.2 mm (matrix size 128 × 128 and FOV
of 25.6 × 22.8 mm).
DTI
DTI
was
performed
under
the
following
conditions:
TR/TE = 4,500/30 ms, 4 EPI segments, �/δ = 10/4.5 ms,
15 non-collinear gradient directions with a single b value shell at
1,000 s/mm2 and one image with a b value of 0 s/mm2 (referred
to as b0), 3 averages, 2 repetitions. Geometrical parameters
were: 18 slices of 1 mm thickness (brain volume) and in-plane
resolution of 0.156 × 0.156 mm2 (matrix size of 128 × 128
and FOV of 20 mm2). The duration of each DTI repetition was
14:24 min.
DTI Fiber Tracking
DTI calculation and fiber tracking were performed using the
ExploreDTI software (Leemans et al., 2009). The tensors obtained
were spectrally decomposed to their eigen-components. The
eigen-values were used to calculate FA maps. Tractography
was applied using Deterministic (streamline) fiber tracking,
terminating at voxels with an FA lower than 0.3 or following
a tract orientation change higher than 30◦ (Basser et al., 2000).
Fibers that passed through a manually selected ROI were plotted.
The fibers were plotted as streamlines. The masks obtained were
overlaid over the color-coded FA image.
CLARITY and Lightsheet Imaging
The CLARITY protocol was used to map the neural fiber
projections in the entire spinal cord tissue (Chung et al., 2013).
Firstly, the hydrogel monomer solution was prepared, on ice,

3D-Constructs Induce SCI Recovery
by adding in deionized water with 4% acrylamide solution
(Bio-Rad), 0.025% Bis-acrylamide solution (Bio-Rad), 0.25%
photoinitiator VA044 (Wako), 10% 1XPBS (Gibco), and 4% PFA
solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Then, the rats were
anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine, transcardially perfused,
and the spinal cords were harvested and placed in 20 ml cold
hydrogel monomer solution in a 50 ml conical tube, for 7 days in
a 4◦C refrigerator. Next, the tubes were de-gassed in a desiccation
chamber in a chemical hood to replace all of the gas in the tube
with nitrogen. Later, the tubes were submerged in 37◦C water
bath for 3 h, to allow for hydrogel polymerization. The embedded
samples were extracted from the gel in the chemical hood. To
dialyze out excess PFA, initiator, and monomer, the samples were
washed for 24 h at room temperature with 50 ml clearing solution
(deionized water with 200 mM Boric acid (Sigma), 4% sodium
dodecyl sulfate (Sigma), and NaOH pellets (EMD), pH 8.5).
The samples were washed two more times with 50 ml clearing
solution, for 24 h each time, at 37◦C, to further reduce residual
PFA, initiator and monomer. The samples were placed in clearing
solution, and incubated in a 37◦C water bath for 10 days until
clearing cues appeared, followed by two PBST (0.1% TritonX in
1X PBS) washes, for 24 h each, in a 4◦C refrigerator. The samples
were then incubated at 4◦C for 1 week, with primary antibodies
[mouse anti-β-III tubulin (Promega, 1:2000), rabbit anti-growth-
associated protein 43 (Millipore, 1:1,000)] in 5% donkey serum
and 0.1% TritonX solution. After 4 consecutive 1X PBS washes,
the samples were incubated at 4◦C for 1 week with secondary
antibodies [goat anti-mouse Cy3 (Jackson, 1:1,000), donkey anti-
rabbit Alexa488 (ThermoFisher, 1:2,000)]. Then, the samples
were maintained at room temperature for 2 days, in scale solution
containing 4M urea, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% TX-100. Finally, the
tissues were imaged using light-sheet microscopy (Zeiss Z1).
Electrophysiology
Following ketamine/xylazine anesthesia, rats were placed in
a stereotaxic apparatus and a midline incision was made in
the head skin (n = 3/group). The cranium was exposed and
two electrical stimulation screw electrodes were implanted
2 mm to the right of the midline, at −1.0 mm and +4.0 mm
anterior and posterior to the bregma, respectively. The screw
electrodes were connected to the output terminals of the
SD9 stimulator (Grass Technologies, Warwick, RI). The sciatic
nerve at the rear of the left leg was exposed and two
silver wire hook electrodes were inserted. Another wire was
inserted into the footpad of the leg and served as a ground
electrode. The hook electrodes were connected to the unity gain
headstage, built on a dual TL072 operational amplifier (Texas
Instruments) and powered by two 9 V batteries. The amplified
signals were band-pass filtered between 0.1 and 3 kHz (7P511
AC wideband preamplifier with 7DA driver amplifier, Grass
Technologies, Warwick, RI), digitized (NI USB-6341 analog-
to-digital converter, National Instruments), acquired at 10 kHz
and stored on a personal computer running the WinWCP
software package (courtesy of Dr. John Dempster, University of
Strathclyde, UK). The stimulation intensity was chosen according
to hindlimb contraction and appearance of the reliable sciatic
nerve compound action potential (CAP) in the first animal, and
maintained throughout the experiment.
Sensory Examination
Sensory evaluation was performed at the end of the experiment
(56 days after surgery), using the pinch technique (n = 4/group;
Gale et al., 1985). The nociceptive stimulus was applied in
both hindlimbs and tail. Responses were considered binary
(responsive or unresponsive, and scored as positive or negative,
respectively). The responsiveness criterion was defined as a
response unlikely to be purely reflexive, indicating percept of the
sensory stimulation, manifested by a vocal response, head turn or
a withdrawal effect of the evaluated hindlimbs or tail.
Statistical Analysis
Results were expressed as mean ± SEM. All analyses were
performed using MATLAB/ Prism. Graphs were generated by
Prism 5 software (USA). Differences between two groups were
statistically analyzed by a two sided T-test assuming different
variance between groups, while one-way ANOVA was applied
to compare between three groups and Bonferroni comparison
post-hoc test was used to characterize specific differences between
groups. For the in vivo cell transplantation experiment, two-
way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison post-hoc test
was performed. Significance levels: ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01,
∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.

Following

(induced
hOMSC), more than 95% of the cells were viable (Figure 1B)
and featured elongated processes homogenously distributed
within the scaffold (Figure 1C, Supplementary Video 1). Similar
cellular phenotypes, characterized by decreased expression of
pluripotency, neural crest and neuronal-associated genes and a
substantial increase in expression of astrocyte-related genes and
NTF, were observed between the hOMSCs induced in a dish
vs. 3D environment. In contrast, BDNF and EAAT2 expression
was significantly higher in the 3D construct, as compared to
2D cultures, while VEGF was also overexpressed, but to a lesser
extent than measured in 2D-induced hOMSCs (Figure 1D).

immunomodulatory and trophic/neuroprotective/regenerative
properties, such as GM-CSF, LIF, SDF-1, IL-10, IL-6, and IL-4,
were also increased after induction (Supplementary Table 1).
Implantation of Induced Constructs
Following Complete Spinal Cord
Transection Elicits Functional Recovery
The complete spinal cord transection model is characterized
by severe axonal damage, associated with motor and sensory
function loss caudal to the injury, and by limited spontaneous
recovery (Talac et al., 2004). Immediately following complete
transection of spinal cords at T10 rats were divided into the
following groups: none (no scaffold or cells), acellular scaffold
(scaffold with no cells), naïve (scaffold with naïve hOMSC) and
induced (scaffold with induced hOMSC into a neural phenotype;
Figure 2A, Supplementary Figure 2). Complete transection was
confirmed with CLARITY and following IHC staining the
scaffold was identified in bright field view and axons were imaged
in a 3D stack using light sheet microscopy (Supplementary
Figure 3).

rectangle). Brasnhan–Beatie–Basso (BBB) scores in 5/12 rats
(42%) exceeded 15 points, while several rats’ scores (4/12, 33%)
were as high as 19–20 within the induced-construct group. In
sharp contrast, none of the other treated animal groups achieved
similar BBB values and untreated rats remained paralyzed
throughout the experimental period. Constructs bearing naïve
hOMSCs (non-induced) elicited intermediate improvements,
with 1/5 rats (20%) reaching a late phase of recovery (BBB scores
≥ 17). To a much lesser extent than both cell-bearing constructs,
acellular scaffolds also prompted a small improvement (1/10 rats
[10%] BBB ≥14 and 8/10, 80% of rats reached BBB scores ≤7;
Figure 2D). The improvement demonstrated by the induced
hOMSC group was reproducible with different donors. For two
additional donors induced construct yielded BBB scores >9 in
22% of the cases (2/9 rats). Furthermore, gait and coordination
analysis of the recovered induced-construct-treated rats (BBB
>17) revealed walking patterns similar to those of intact
rats, with progressive and adaptive motor coordination over
time where hindlimb—forelimb movement is followed by a
hindlimb—forelimb movement from the contralateral side.
This behavior developed over time in the induced group, where
uncoordinated gait was present at earlier stages of recovery. In
contrast, paralyzed controls exhibited movement of the forelimbs
only (Figure 2E). Additionally, some of the recovered animals
also exhibited a “mosey walk” or abnormal stepping pattern but
yet coordinated and functional (high BBB). Coordinated gait
was observed in 5 out of 12 rats treated with induced constructs,
1 out of 5 rats treated by naïve constructs, and only 1 out of
10 rats from the acellular construct group. None of the rats
transected and left untreated (none group) showed any motor
improvement. In addition, 56 days post-implantation, 75% of
the evaluated rats treated with induced-constructs responded to
gross stimuli, while rats receiving the acellular constructs failed
to show any sensory response (Figure 2F).
Functional Recovery Is Associated with
Structural Organization of and Electric
Conduction through the Transected Site
To determine the functional basis of the observed recovery,
structural analysis of the spinal cord and electrical signal
propagation were evaluated in vivo. Temporal structural
remodeling of the spinal cord was assessed by MRI diffusion
tensor imaging (MRI-DTI) performed 3 and 56 days after
surgery in the same animals. In all cases, no fibers connecting
the injured spinal cord were observed 3 days after transection
with our resolution, suggesting complete transection. Complete
transection was also verified using CLARITY (Supplementary
Video 5). In contrast, partial connection of rostral and caudal
fibers was only present on day 56 in the same rats treated
with induced hOMSCs (Supplementary Videos 6, 7). On day
56, fractional anisotropy (FA) recordings 1–4 mm caudal to
the injury site were significantly higher in induced-hOMSC
construct-treated rats compared to the acellular group, but were
still lower than in intact rats (intact rats exhibit FA of 0.7,
indicative of organized spinal cord tissue with high anisotropy.
Induced hOMSC exhibited FA of 0.32–0.39, higher than the
acellular group with FA between 0.23 and 0.25, p < 0.05,
Figure 3A, Supplementary Figure 4).
To assess functional electrical transmission, motor cortices of
rats treated with either induced-hOMSC constructs or acellular
scaffolds were stimulated with single pulse stimulation. Motor-
evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the isolated sciatic
nerve at the hind limb level (Figure 3B). Functional electrical
transmission assessments demonstrated high-amplitude signals
propagating through the sciatic nerve of rats treated with
induced constructs, vs. hardly detectable signal propagation in
the acellular group (2.19 ± 0.43 and 0.79 ± 0.35 mV, respectively,
a statistically significant difference P < 0.04; Figures 3C,D).
The electric signal in the former group was abolished by
a second transection at C5 rostral to the initial transection
(0.14 ± 0.05 mV, statistically significant difference vs. hOMSC
measurement before retransection, P < 0.009 and non-significant
difference vs. the acellular group). This suggests the connectivity
between the motor cortex through the spinal cord to the sciatic
nerve was exhibited in the induced group and was severed by
transection at an arbitrary midpoint.
Re-establishment of Neuronal Integrity and
Glial Scar Inhibition Underlie the Observed
Recovery
Histology and quali-quantitative immunofluorescence tools were
then used to identify cellular mechanisms associated with the
recovery of the neuronal circuitry at the injury/implantation
site (Figures 4, 5). While some degree of tissue cavitation was
observed at the injury site in all the evaluated groups, new
tissue with an organized ventral white matter structure was
identified in the induced hOMSC construct-treated group only.
Neuronal markers beta-III tubulin (TUJ1) and neurofilament-
200 (NF200) showed increased expression at the implantation
site of the construct bearing induced hOMSCs, but were barely
identified in the acellular or naïve groups (Figure 4A). Moreover,
10-fold increase in TUJ1 levels were observed in regions caudal
to the lesion site in the induced-construct treated animals when
compared to the acellular group (Figure 4A). Similar expression
profiles were obtained for the axonal elongation marker NF200,
GAP43, myelin basic protein (MBP) and the neuroprogenitor
marker nestin (6, 3, 8–15, and 3–6 fold increase respectively to the
acellular group; Figures 4A,B). Immunofluorescence staining
of longitudinally sectioned spinal cord tissue samples from
rats treated with an acellular PLLA/PLGA scaffold or induced
construct showed GAP43-positive fibers passing through the
dense glial scar tissue into the PLLA/PLGA scaffold. More
remarkable GAP43-positive fibers were present in higher
numbers in the induced construct group as compared to the
acellular group (Figure 4C).
The lowest levels of the glial scar marker chondroitin sulfate
proteoglycan (CSPG) as well as GFAP and were measured
in the induced hOMSC group as compared to all other
groups by 3- to 5-fold reduction (Figure 5A). GFAP levels
and the number of CD11b-positive microglial cells were also
reduced in this group, while marked microglial presence was
noted around naïve hOMSCs (Figure 5A). CD11b was also

markedly reduced but to no statistically significant degree
(Figure 5B). To evaluate the migration of induced-hOMSC into
the spinal cords, constructs engineered with GFP-labeled cells
were implanted and monitored. While a few GFP-positive cells
were identified at a distance of up to 4 mm both rostral and
caudal to the implantation site, 28 days after transplantation, the
majority of cells remained within the implanted construct area
(Supplementary Figure 5).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we report that transplantation of artificial tissue
constructs secreting trophic factors formed a growth-permissive
microenvironment that counteracted inhibitory signals and
promoted connectivity restoration across the injury spinal cord
site (Jones et al., 2001). In most cases, these effects translated to
substantial functional improvement, enabling paraplegic rats to
walk independently and regain sensory perception (Figures 2,3).
Functional recovery (BBB scores between 14 and 21) was
achieved in 0, 10, 40, and 42% of the rats implanted with no
construct or with an acellular, naïve and induced construct,
respectively (Figures 2C,D). Specifically, 5 of 12 rats (42%)
treated with the induced constructs demonstrated BBB scores
exceeding 17, a compiled reflection of improved coordinated gait,
plantar placement, weight support, recovery of toe clearance,
trunk stability, and predominant parallel paw and tail position,
suggesting regained cortical motor control (Basso et al., 1995;
Li et al., 2014). Previous attempts to treat SCI have thoroughly
evaluated a large variety of cells, both in combination with
TE and with ectopic expression of therapeutic genes (Tetzlaff
et al., 2011; Granger et al., 2014). Here we engineered a multi-
effector construct exhibiting an average BBB score of 9.7, with
some animals exhibiting 19–20 BBB scores and normal motor
coordination (Figure 2). Yet, focus on the mean BBB scores does
not reflect the binary or on/off outcome of our treatment. The
induced constructs promoted remarkable recovery in 42% of the
rats, and show no efficacy in the remainder of the rats within
the same group. This binary effect compels further investigation,
since understanding of the underlying mechanisms causing
substantial improvement in some animals and no practical
improvement in others can render this method into an effective
treatment. In contrast, transected but untreated rats from the
none group showed limited spontaneous recovery, confirming
again the complete transection of the spinal cord in the tested
groups. Interestingly, although most of the rats transplanted with
empty scaffolds did not show major improvements (80% with

BBB <7), 20% of the rats treated with scaffold only exhibited
substantial improvements, but to a lesser degree than the other
groups. Indeed, previous studies demonstrated that scaffolds
alone are able to promote axonal elongation and functional
recovery in rodents (Lavik et al., 2002; Teng et al., 2002) and
primates (Slotkin et al., 2017).
The recovery reported here for the induced group was
also accompanied by an improvement in sensory responses
to gross external stimuli in 75% of the treated rats, while all
the other groups failed to show such responses (Figure 2F).
Furthermore, our findings (Figures 2,3) resonate with 11 studies
reporting a positive correlation between electrical conduction
and functional effects elicited by cell transplants after SCI
(Granger et al., 2014). MEPs travel in both dorsolateral
and ventral pathways and are routinely used to evaluate
reticulospinal and corticospinal tract integrity (Garcia-Alias
et al., 2006). The amplitudes of the propagated MEPs recorded
in the induced group were lower than those observed in
the intact animal, but significantly higher than those of the
acellular group. This suggests at least partial connectivity

2012).
Histological, CLARITY and MRI-DTI analyses provided
additional evidence of the complete interruption of axonal
bundles at the transected level in non-walking animals, while
fibers bridging the injury site were detected in walking rats
(Figures 3,4, Supplementary Figure 3). The clearly abnormal
stepping pattern typically observed in the induced group animals
may suggest lack of restoration of propriospinal or modulatory
control, or a hypersensitivity phenomenon. Yet, partial structural
restoration of the connectivity, combined with small-amplitude
MEPs were sufficient to elicit substantial functional recovery in
the whole animal (Figure 3). The explanation to this dissimilarity
between this substantial functional recovery and the limited
recovery of the electro-physiological properties (as well as the
axonal connectivity as provided in the MRI study) is still
unknown. It might be attributed to partial reconnection to
a spinal cord pattern generator that governs the locomotion
(Rybak et al., 2006).
MRI-FA values demonstrated improved directionality of
axon tracts in the induced-hOMSC group, which positively
correlated with TUJ1, NF200, GAP43, and MBP staining and
motor function, indicating active axonal elongation processes
as previously reported (Figures 2–4, 3A, Supplementary Figure
4; Nevo et al., 2001; Kozlowski et al., 2008; Kelley et al.,
2014). At the same time, the induced hOMSC group displayed
the lowest levels of the axonal elongation inhibitory factor,
CSGPs, and the lowest degree of co-localization with GAP43
(Figure 4). In contrast, strong co-localization of CSPGs and
GAP43 was observed in all the other control groups, suggesting
axon growth neutralization or collapse, highly resembling those
of the dystrophic end bulbs or “sterile clubs” first reported by
Ramon y Cajal (Ramón Y Cajal, 1928; Davies et al., 1999). In
rats treated with the acellular PLLA/PLGA scaffolds and induced
constructs, GAP43-positive fibers traversed the dense glial scar
tissue into the scaffold area, suggesting that the scaffold itself
plays an important role in tissue regeneration, resonating with
the findings by Teng et al. who reported that the scaffold alone
promoted functional recovery by reducing epidural and glial scar
formation (Teng et al., 2002). Yet, as compared to the acellular
group, a larger number of GAP43-positive fibers were detected in
the induced construct group, probably due to paracrine activity
of the induced hOMSCs within the scaffold (Figure 4C). In
line with these observations, astrocytes, and to some extent,
microglial reactivity were reduced, potentially avoiding a hostile
environment for neuronal plasticity and repair (Figure 5). In
addition, induced constructs may support recruitment and/or
proliferation of nestin-positive progenitors (Figure 4), and their
respective differentiation at the injury site (Matsumura et al.,
2010). Grafted cells were mostly detected at implantation site,
indicating the effectiveness of the scaffolds in retaining the cells
and enhancing the local paracrine effect mediated by secreted
factors.
Analysis of the induced constructs by a protein array provided
additional evidence of a paracrine effect, with increased secretion
of BDNF, NT-3/4, GDNF, VEGF, HGF, SDF-1, and G-CSF
(Kitamura et al., 2011; Jeong et al., 2012; Silva et al., 2014).
BDNF, NT-3/4, VEGF, and HGF have been shown to induce
the growth of neurites and NF200/GAP-43 axons, and to
promote myelination and regeneration of CST, rubrospinal, and
reticulospinal tracts. These factors were also associated with
reduced inflammation, glial reactivity, and reduced expression of
the glial scar molecules in the spinal cord (Kobayashi et al., 1997;
Liu et al., 1999; Facchiano et al., 2002; Jin et al., 2002; Tuszynski
et al., 2003; Kitamura et al., 2011; Jaerve et al., 2012; Jeong et al.,
2012; Kadoya et al., 2016). SDF-1 can promote axon outgrowth in
the presence of myelin inhibitors, as well as support and attract
endogenous nestin-positive neural precursor cells to the injury
site (Jaerve et al., 2012), as observed in our analysis.
The clear binary or on/off effect observed within the
treated animals, ranging from unresponsive rats to highly
responsive ones may have been the results of heterogeneous or
variable 3D cell seeding and differentiation within the scaffold.
More importantly, their precise implantation position at the
spinal level, may have selectively induced partial repair and
reconnection of specific spinal tracts, as previously described
(Kobayashi et al., 1997; Liu et al., 1999; Facchiano et al., 2002; Jin
et al., 2002; Tuszynski et al., 2003; Kitamura et al., 2011; Jaerve
et al., 2012; Jeong et al., 2012). Since the minimum requirements
for eliciting substantial recovery have yet to be defined, subtle
differences in the scaffold and its position related to the spinal
cord stumps may have selectively favored restoration of some but
not all tracts.
Considering the complexity of tissue repair in spinal cord
injuries, it is likely that the observed functional changes
were elicited by the synergistic activity of several factors
differentially
secreted

constructs
leading
to
neuroprotection, gliomodulation, and consequential stimulation
and/or repressed inhibition of axonal elongation processes
(Tetzlaff et al., 2011). Furthermore, a minor recovery of the
electro-physiological properties probably induced by axonal
elongation or by neuroprotective mechanisms elicited functional
recovery, even in the scaffold only group. As demonstrated
in this study, immediate provision of these cues after injury
minimizes secondary degeneration and stimulates endogenous
regenerative/repair mechanisms. The treatment design exploited
an implant fabricated of FDA-approved, biocompatible, and
biodegradable materials with easily accessible adult stem cells,
which are induced through a medium-based protocol. This
multi-effector
approach
showed
encouraging
preliminary
results and warrants further investigation to shed light on
the mechanisms underlying the observed recovery, to enable
improved efficacy and to define the intervention optimal for
treatment of spinal cord injury.
