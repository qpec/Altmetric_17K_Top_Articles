Abstract
Background: Radiotherapy is a mainstay for the treatment of lung cancer that can induce pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis.
The matricellular protein connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a central mediator of tissue remodeling.
Methods: A radiation-induced mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis was used to determine if transient administration of a hu-
man antibody to CTGF (FG-3019) started at different times before or after 20 Gy thoracic irradiation reduced acute and chronic
radiation toxicity. Mice (25 mice/group; 10 mice/group in a confirmation study) were examined by computed tomography, his-
tology, gene expression changes, and for survival. In vitro experiments were performed to directly study the interaction of
CTGF blockade and radiation. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: Administration of FG-3019 prevented (�50%–80%) or reversed (�50%) lung remodeling, improved lung function, im-
proved mouse health, and rescued mice from lethal irradiation (P < .01). Importantly, when antibody treatment was initiated
at 16 weeks after thoracic irradiation, FG-3019 reversed established lung remodeling and restored lung function. CTGF block-
ade abrogated M2 polarized macrophage influx, normalized radiation-induced gene expression changes, and reduced myofi-
broblast abundance and Osteopontin expression.
Conclusion: These results indicate that blocking CTGF attenuates radiation-induced pulmonary remodeling and can reverse
the process after initiation. CTGF has a central role in radiation-induced fibrogenesis, and FG-3019 may benefit patients with
radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis or patients with other forms or origin of chronic fibrotic diseases.
Radiotherapy
is
an
important
treatment
for
lung
cancer.
However, ionizing radiation induces acute and chronic side ef-
fects that limit the efficacy of radiotherapy (1–3). No treatments
are approved for radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis (4–6).
The pathophysiologic events induced by radiation are similar to
those that occur after other types of lung injury and idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (7,8). The common pathologic features
of pulmonary fibrosis are dysregulated wound healing charac-
terized by myofibroblast expansion and progressive deposition
of extracellular matrix (ECM) (9–12). This aberrant tissue re-
modeling alters normal lung architecture, impairing gas ex-
change, lung function, and quality of life.

 Key mediators of lung fibrosis have been identified, but a
unified model of fibrogenesis has not been established (12,13). A
number of treatment strategies have shown promising effects
in rodent models of lung toxicity, including targeting free radi-
cal production (14), inflammatory cell recruitment, statins, and
inhibitors of PDGF, VEGF, FGF, TGFß, Cox-2, integrin signaling
(6,7,15–27), and targeting the TLR-4, CXCL12/CXCR4-axis, and
NADPH-Oxidase 4 (28). The effectiveness of agents to halt fibro-
sis or reverse manifested lung remodeling in the clinic has yet
to be investigated (29–33).
The matricellular protein connective tissue growth factor
(CTGF) is a central mediator of tissue remodeling and fibrosis
(34–37). CTGF has been reported to be an essential mediator for
the fibrotic activity of TGFb (38,39), but can also act indepen-
dently of TGFb. A role of CTGF expression has been described in
mouse models of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (40–
43), and elevated CTGF expression was reported in patients with
IPF (44–48).
Here we investigated whether blocking CTGF with FG-3019, a
human monoclonal antibody that binds human and rodent
CTGF, could attenuate and reverse pulmonary fibrosis after tho-
racic irradiation. The C57Bl/6 lung radiation model used is phys-
iologically
relevant
because
it
exhibits
a
similar
slow,
progressive course and mechanisms characteristic of human fi-
brosis (1,49–51). Strong biphasic induction of CTGF expression
in the lungs of irradiated C57Bl/6 mice has also been reported
(50). FG-3019 was evaluated prior to observation of persistent
lung remodeling (prevention) and after statistically significant
lung remodeling was detectable (therapeutic intervention) (51).
Methods
Mouse Thorax Irradiation and CT Monitoring
All animal and cell procedures were approved by institutional
and governmental authorities (DKFZ internal animal protection
office; Regierungspraesidium Karlsruhe, Germany). Irradiation
and monitoring of the six- to eight-week-old female C57Bl/6
mice (25 mice/group; 10 mice/group in a confirmatory study)
were performed as previously described (15,52). Mice thoraces
were irradiated with 20 Gy photons (6 MeV linac, dose rate 118
cGy/min, Siemens, Munich, Germany) (Supplementary Figure 1,
available
online).
High-resolution
computed
tomography
(HRCT; Aquilion, Toshiba, Minato, Japan) was analyzed for mor-
phological and quantitative lung density. For the irradiation
and CT procedures, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal
application of 0.2 mg/kg Rompun (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany)
and 100 mg/kg ketamine 10% (Parke-Davis, Detroit, MI).
Antibody Treatment
FG-3019 is a human mAb and was administered (i.p., 10mg/kg,
3/week) for eight weeks starting two days before irradiation
(pretreatment group), or two, 20, or 112 days (16 weeks) after ir-
radiation (two-, 20- or 112-day groups). Control (nonirradiated)
mice received FG-3019 or IgG for eight weeks beginning two
days after experiment initiation. Placebo-treated mice received
IgG for eight weeks beginning two days after irradiation.
Antibodies were provided by Fibrogen, Inc. (San Francisco, CA)
in histidine-buffered saline, pH 6.
Lung Histology
Histological analysis was performed as previously described
(15,52). In brief, two to four mice/group were killed for histology
on days scheduled for CT examination. Their lungs were fixed
by intratracheal instillation of 4% formalin followed by over-
night fixation, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 mm, and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or Sirius red for colla-
gen deposition. Alpha-SMA staining was performed using
Vector Elite Stain Kits (pk6101, Vector, Burlingame, CA) and an
anti-aSMA-antibody (Abcam 5694-100; Abcam, Cambridge, UK).
Macrophages were detected by a monoclonal rat antibody
(Abcam, ab56297), and mastcells were stained by Giemsa (Dako,
Hamburg, Germany). Visualization was performed using bioti-
nylated secondary antibodies followed by an avidin-biotin per-
oxidase complex (Vectastain, PK6100; Vector, Burlingame, CA)
and the chromogen 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (Vectastain, PK6100).
Images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope
equipped with a Nikon digital sight DS- U1 (Nikon Corp.,
Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed with ImageJ Software
Version 1.42q (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).
Health Status in Mice and Blood Gas Analysis
Blood was collected from the tail capillary of three mice/group,
and oxygen content was measured on an ABL5 Radiometer
blood gas analyzer (Radiometer GmbH, Willich, Germany).
Mouse health was assessed semiquantitatively in at least three
randomly chosen mice using a rank scale (0–3) assessing mobil-
ity, skin status, hunched back, breath rate, and weight.
Gene Expression in Mouse Lungs
RNA from two mice per group was quantified on one-color
4x44K mouse whole genome arrays (Agilent G4122F; Agilent,
Santa Clara, CA). Array data were analyzed with Genespring GX
(Agilent) software. Data were normalized to the median of eight
nonirradiated control samples. Major expression patterns of
probes altered substantially (�twofold) and statistically signifi-
cantly (P < 0.01) by irradiated (RT) relative to nonirradiated IgG
controls or FG-3019 relative to RT alone were identified by prin-
cipal components analysis. Cell type–specific origins of coordi-
nately altered transcripts were confirmed using the mouse
BioGPS database. All fold-change (Fc) values used for individual
comparison between two groups met cutoffs for a greater than
twofold increase or decrease in relative expression, calculated
as the relative expression between the two groups. Data are
available at ArrayExpress (accession number: E-TABM-1153).
In Vitro Assays
Primary
isolated
human
endothelial
and
fibroblast
cells
(HUVEC, HDMEC), human pulmonary fibroblasts (HPF), normal
human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF), primary human mesenchy-
mal stem cells (MSC) (53), and human NSCLC A549 cells were
treated with FG-3019 6 radiation. Clonogenic, cell proliferation,
and Matrigel invasion/migration and proliferation coculture as-
says were performed. Immunoblots were probed with FG-3019,
anti-aSMA, anti-collagen IV antibodies. Cell cycle and apoptosis
assays using subG1 DNA and Caspase-3 were performed by
FACS.

 Statistics
Mouse survival curves after thoracic irradiation and antibody
treatments were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method and
analyzed using the log-rank test and the Cox proportional haz-
ards model. The assumption of proportionality was verified by
including time-dependent covariates in the Cox model and also
by analyzing the Kaplan-Meier curves. Starting points for the
log-rank test were the time of radiation or the time of FG-3019
start, as indicated. Mice killed for histological examination were
censored. Other quantitative data are shown as mean values 6
SD, as indicated. For analysis of differences between multiple
groups, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, followed by the
appropriate post hoc test. Expression data were analyzed using
ANOVA with Bonferroni correction. Student’s t test was used for
parametric and Wilcoxon test for nonparametric variables.
Correlation analyses were performed using Pearson correlation
coefficient (PCC). All tests were two-tailed. P values of less than
.05 were considered statistically significant. The Graphpad
Prism (Version 6.0, Ja Jolla, CA) and Statistica (Statistica 5.0,
Statsoft, Tulsa, OK) software packages were used.

Results
Survival and Mouse Health after Lethal Thorax
Irradiation
Thoracic irradiation without FG-3019 treatment was uniformly
lethal and all mice died within 11 months, while transient FG-
3019 treatment
prolonged
overall survival
in a schedule-
dependent manner (Figure 1, A–D). FG-3019 extended median
survival of irradiated mice from 161 days (95% CI ¼ 151.1 to
170.9) to 300 days (95% CI ¼ 166.1 to 325.9; P ¼ .003 for pooled,
FG-3019-treated mice) (Figure 1B). The greatest survival benefit
was achieved when FG-3019 treatment was initiated 20 days af-
ter irradiation with 70% survival at 48 weeks (P ¼ .01) (Figure
1C). Initiation of FG-3019 two days before irradiation also in-
creased survival (P ¼ .03). The survival advantage from FG-3019
was present if data were analyzed from the time of radiotherapy
or from the start of treatment (Figure 1D). FG-3019 was well tol-
erated and improved the health of irradiated mice (Figure 1E;
Supplementary Table 1, available online). Mice in the 20-day
group showed the greatest benefits and were most similar to
nonirradiated control mice. Mice that started FG-3019 at 16
weeks after irradiation, when health deterioration was already
evident, showed statistically significant and persistent health
status improvement during the eight weeks of FG-3019 adminis-
tration and after treatment was completed (Supplementary
Table 1, available online). Irradiated mice (RT) and placebo-
treated mice exhibited reduced weight vs controls (P < .001). FG-
3019-treated groups attenuated the radiation-associated weight
loss (P ¼ .008 vs RT).
Computed Tomography of Lung Density Increases
A hallmark of lung fibrosis is increased tissue density, which is
the basis of computed tomography (CT) analysis. Longitudinal
CT monitoring demonstrated that the lung density of irradiated
mice progressively increased after 12 weeks until 30 weeks
(Figure 2, A–C). By eight weeks, CT morphology revealed high-
density foci distributed throughout the lungs as typical signs of
acute and subacute pneumonitis. By week 30, these dense foci
fused to larger areas, indicative of chronic radiation damage
and lung fibrosis. Reticular alterations and irregular septal
thickening were typical CT findings characteristic of pulmonary
fibrosis, consistent with histology. FG-3019 reduced CT signs of
damage and lung densities. Early FG-3019 treatment attenuated
the lung density increase by 42.8% (FG-3019 pre) and 46.5% (FG-
3019 post day 2). FG-3019 initiation at day 20 almost completely
prevented radiologically detectable lung damage, attenuated
lung density increase by 83.3% (week 48 postirradiation), and
yielded CT images comparable with nonirradiated control mice.
CT imaging also demonstrated that the lung density in-
crease was reversible upon CTGF blockade: At 16 weeks, lung
density was increased by 100 HU in irradiated mice without FG-
3019 and continued to rise thereafter. FG-3019 administration
starting at 16 weeks induced progressive lung density decreases
that remained stable after treatment ceased (Figure 2C).
Lung and chest wall radiation-induced toxicity can alter the
macroscopic structure and morphology of the thoracic scaffold-
ing, leading to reduced lung size, mobility, and function. CT
data revealed that FG-3019 also attenuated radiation-induced
thorax shrinkage and cardiac hypertrophy (Supplementary
Results and Supplementary Figure 2, A and B, available online).
Lung Function
In radiotherapy of lung cancer patients, a major side effect is
worsening of lung function resulting in reduced blood oxygena-
tion (3). We assessed gas exchange from tail capillary blood for
oxygen partial pressure (paO2). At 30 weeks, paO2 levels were
substantially below normal, indicating worsening of the oxygen
status, while paO2 values in the 20-day/16-week FG-3019 groups
were in the normal range, indicating a positive effect on lung
function (Figure 2D). In addition, the oxygen saturation data in-
versely correlated with lung densities measured by CT (r2 ¼
0.80, P < .001) (Figure 2E). Thus, FG-3019 robustly improved func-
tion of irradiated lungs in a treatment- and schedule-sensitive
manner, and CT lung density measurements were representa-
tive of lung function. For details, see the Supplementary Results
(available online).
Lung and Cardiac Remodeling
Lung histology demonstrated progressive tissue remodeling af-
ter 12 weeks, with increasing alveolar septal thickness evident
by 18 weeks reaching a plateau by 30 weeks (Figures 3, A–C;

 online). Consistent late changes included alterations in the epi-
thelium of bronchi and bronchioles including erosion, hyperpla-
sia, and squamous metaplasia. By 30 weeks, extensive lung
remodeling had occurred and morphometric analysis indicated
that only approximately 30% of the alveolar area remained in-
tact. Sirius Red staining revealed fibrotic patches of collagen,
consistent with irradiation-induced fibrogenesis (Figure 3A).
FG-3019 strongly reduced erosion, wall broadening, collagen de-
position, and fibrosis in a schedule-dependent manner: The
strongest beneficial effects of FG-3019 were seen in the 20-day
group, which exhibited minimal change throughout the course
of the experiment, and lungs that looked histologically normal
at 30 weeks—more than two months after FG-3019 administra-
tion had halted.
In the 16-week group, septal thickening and pneumonitis
were evident at 16 weeks, but lung remodeling was substan-
tially resolved within two weeks of FG-3019 treatment and al-
most completely resolved by 24 weeks (Figure 3, B and D;
Supplementary Results and Supplementary Figure 3, available
online). Thus radiology and histology showed that FG-3019 ro-
bustly improved lung fibrosis–associated parameters and sug-
gested that as little as two weeks of FG-3019 reversed delayed
radiation-induced lung toxicity.
Furthermore, alpha-smooth muscle actin (aSMA) staining at
30 weeks showed that FG-3019 reduced irradiation-induced
myofibroblast abundance (Figure 3E) as a potential mechanism
for FG-3019’s antifibrotic effects because myofibroblasts are in-
volved in ECM deposition and lung remodeling in lung fibrosis
(54). Likewise CTGF blockade between 16 and 18 weeks mark-
edly reversed radiation-induced osteopontin/SPP1 mRNA and
protein expression (Figure 3F), which is a potential biomarker
for the development of pulmonary fibrosis (55–57).
Histology of the hearts revealed collagen deposits indicating
mild myocardial fibrosis of both the right (RV) and left (LV) ven-
tricle that were attenuated by FG-3019. Irradiation also in-
creased the thickness of the right (RV) ventricle wall, which was
attenuated
by
FG-3019
in
the
20-day/16-week
groups
(Supplementary Results and Supplementary Figure 4, A and B,
available online).
Acute Inflammation and Edema
FG-3019 pretreatment prevented leukocyte infiltration at day 2
(Figure 4A; Supplementary Results, available online), consistent
with a report of CTGF affecting peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC) recruitment (58,59). FG-3019 also suppressed acute
septal thickening, a surrogate for interstitial edema (Figure 4A;
Figure 2. Lung density and function after thoracic irradiation. The lung density
of mice in each group was analyzed radiologically by computed tomography
(CT) and quantified in Hounsfield units (HU) at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24,
30, and 48 after irradiation. A) Representative computed tomography slices of
mouse lungs at 12 and 24 weeks after irradiation. White areas represent high-
density tissues (heart, bone, scar tissue), black areas represent air, dark gray
areas are normal lung tissue (� -520 HU), and lighter gray areas indicate in-
creased density due to increased cellularity, edema, deposition of extracellular
matrix proteins, and fibrosis. Lung fibrosis is characterized by diffuse bilateral
areas of “ground glass” and intralobular reticular opacities. B) Quantitative lung
density data derived from noninvasive computed tomography. All lung density

 Supplementary Figure 5A, available online). This is relevant be-
cause edema allows extravascular fibrin to serve as a provi-
sional matrix, promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) in response to stimuli like TGFb (60) leading to formation
of myofibroblasts. Together the data suggest a role for CTGF in
radiation-induced
acute
edema
and
leukocyte
influx
(Supplementary Figure 7, available online).
Delayed Immune Response
The acute inflammation and edema spontaneously subsided by
two weeks after irradiation. A subsequent inflammation phase
reached a fourfold higher leucocyte peak at 18 to 20 weeks
(Figure 4B; Supplementary Figure 5B, available online). FG-3019
reduced alveolar histiocytosis, characterized by sharp increases
of macrophages and mast cells after 16 weeks (Figure 4, C and
D). In the 16-week group, two weeks of FG-3019 reversed and
prevented pulmonary leukocyte influx. Between 16 weeks and
18 weeks after irradiation, the relative percentage of macro-
phages increased disproportionally from 2.9% 6 0.29% to 34.1%
6 3.3% of all leukocytes (P ¼ .003). FG-3019 reduced the macro-
phage influx and prevented this proportion shift, suggesting
that macrophage influx drives fibrogenic lung remodeling in re-
sponse to irradiation (Figure 4E).
Gene Expression Changes
Microarray analysis was performed to better understand rever-
sal of the fibrotic process. Microarray expression profiling on
18-week lung samples (n ¼ 2/group) showed that the expression
of many transcripts was statistically significantly, substantially,
and coordinately altered by radiation alone (Figure 5A). FG-3019
beginning 20 days or 16 weeks after irradiation produced a gene
expression pattern resembling that of nonirradiated mice. This
expression normalization in the 16-week therapeutic group sug-
gested that inhibition of CTGF for only two weeks was sufficient
to profoundly alter the biology of the remodeling lung. Analysis
of individual genes showed that radiation increased transcripts
associated with mesenchymal cell types and ECM remodeling,
which were coordinately downregulated by FG-3019 (Figure 5B).
Similarly regulated transcripts in the 20-day/16-week groups
were characteristic of immune cell infiltration and/or have im-
portant roles in fibrosis, inflammation (61,62), immune cell re-
cruitment
(63),
tissue
destruction
(64,65),
myofibroblast
stimulation, and collagen deposition, fibroblast survival (66),
and EMT and ECM-deposition (Figure 5, B and C; Supplementary

 by FG-3019 was reflected in the transcriptome by normalizing
markers for mast cells and M2 polarized macrophages, but not
M1 macrophages (Figure 5, B–D) (68,69). The expression data
suggest that FG-3019 acted in a concerted manner rather than
by
blocking
a
single
antifibrotic
pathway
(Supplementary
Results and Supplementary Figures 5 and 6, available online).
Fibroblasts, Mesenchymal Stem Cells, and TGFb-
Stimulated EMT
In vitro, FG-3019 exhibited little toxicity in clonogenic survival
and proliferation assays in primary human endothelial cells
(HUVEC, HDMEC), fibroblasts (NHDF, HPF), and A549 lung cancer
cells. (Figure 6, A and B). FG-3019 reduced constitutive (100 mg/
mL: 68.3%, SD¼ 6.4%, P ¼ .007; 30 mg/mL: 38.2%, SD¼ 7.8%, P ¼
.03) and TGFb-stimulated HPF migration (30 mg/mL: 58.1%,
SD¼ 6.7%, P ¼ .01) (Figure 6C). It attenuated TGFb-stimulated dif-
ferentiation or EMT with reduced expression of a-SMA and colla-
gen IV protein in HPF and A549 cells (Figure 6D), and attenuated
TGFb induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal phenotype change
(data not shown), supporting the hypothesis that CTGF blockade
disrupts TGFb-mediated fibrogenesis. FG-3019 did not alter the
intrinsic cellular radiosensitivity of endothelial cells, fibroblasts,
and A549 lung cancer cells (Figure 6, E–H), or human mesenchy-
mal stem cells. It had only mild and subadditive antimigratory
and antiproliferative effects when combined with radiation
(Figure 6, I–K). FG-3019 did not alter the radiation-induced G2 cell
cycle block and did not statistically significantly increase apopto-
sis of MSC (Figure 6, L and M). In a coculture proliferation model
of human MSC with HPF or endothelial cells (HDMEC), irradiation
of MSC, HPF, and HDMEC in the bottom compartment stimulated
paracrine MSC and HPF proliferation in the upper compartment,
which was inhibited by FG-3019 for HPF but not for MSC. For ex-
ample, irradiation of MSC stimulated HPF proliferation by 1.9-
fold (SD¼ 0.22-fold, P ¼ .02), which was reduced by FG-3019 to
1.1-fold (SD¼ 0.13-fold, P ¼ .03) (Figure 6N).
Discussion
Transient administration of FG-3019, a human monoclonal anti-
body to CTGF, attenuated radiation-induced lung remodeling in
C57Bl/6 mice and reversed the process after it had initiated. All
FG-3019-treated
groups
demonstrated
benefit:
Radiation-
induced lung remodeling was attenuated, prevented, or re-
versed (as assessed by histology and longitudinal CT), and the
overall health and lifespan of the mice were improved. When
FG-3019 treatment started 20 days after the irradiation, most
mice (70%) were rescued from death despite having received a
lethal radiation dose.

 CTGF may contribute to multiple aspects of the process of fi-
brosis. CTGF may directly modulate the formation of myofibro-
blasts
by
regulating
transdifferentiation
of
fibroblasts
or
epithelial cells or indirectly contribute to myofibroblast forma-
tion by enabling edema leading to deposition of provisional ma-
trix upon which epithelial cells undergo EMT. CTGF stimulates
myofibroblasts to express chemokines and cytokines that re-
cruit leukocytes and regulate their activity. CTGF also stimu-
lates myofibroblasts to deposit and remodel ECM leading to
changes in organ structure and function. Our data support this
model by showing that FG-3019 reprogrammed fibrogenesis via
normalization of the radiation-induced expression of genes in-
volved in inflammation associated with M2 macrophage influx,
EMT, myofibroblast activation, remodeling, and ECM deposition.
Open questions remain with respect to radiation dose interde-
pendence on the role of M2/M1 polarization changes that might
affect inflammation type, vessel permeabilization, and tissue
vascularization (70,71).
FG-3019
also
normalized
radiation-induced
SMA
and
osteopontin protein and mRNA expression, suggesting a reduc-
tion of fibrotic disease activity because osteopontin has been
implicated in fibrogenesis via ERK-dependent signaling and has
been suggested as a biomarker for pulmonary fibrosis (72–74).
FG-3019 treatment starting 20 days after irradiation achieved
the most profound benefits on lung structure and function.
Treatment starting two days before/after irradiation, showed
smaller benefits, suggesting that CTGF has an important role in
radiation response between weeks 9 and 11 after irradiation,
when early FG-3019 administration stopped, but was ongoing in
the 20-day group.
FG-3019 two-day pretreatment resulted in longer survival
than FG-3019 starting two days after irradiation despite the
largely overlapping eight-week administration periods. One
possible explanation is that FG-3019 pretreatment attenuated
delayed responses to irradiation by preventing leucocyte influx
and edema that allows extravascular fibrin to provide a provi-
sional matrix upon which epithelial cells undergo EMT (60).
Therapeutic administration of FG-3019 reversed progressive
lung remodeling, and lung densities decreased over the eight
weeks of FG-3019 administration and remained stable without
further treatment for another six months until the experiment
was terminated. Similarly most radiologic, histologic, lung func-
tion, and health parameters reversed their disease progression.
These data demonstrate that transient administration of FG-

 3019 had a durable effect and that the process of fibrosis could
be reversed. The relatively modest improvement of survival in
certain groups may have resulted from the early timing of the
treatment or cumulative irreversible lung and/or cardiac toxic-
ity already present at the time of treatment initiation (FG-3019
16 weeks).
Complex homeostatic processes like fibrogenesis are regu-
lated by signaling networks controlled by positive and negative
regulatory elements (51,75–77). Our data suggest that CTGF is a
mediator of the shift from acute inflammation to a chronic
fibrogenic inflammatory program, consistent with the hypothe-
sis proposed by Kular (78) that CCN proteins are modulators of
inflammation. Exposure to FG-3019 for only two weeks was suf-
ficient to normalize the gene expression pattern and reprogram
fibrotic processes.
In vitro, FG-3019 effects were modest, with no influence on
the intrinsic radiosensitivity of cells. However, FG-3019 ex-
hibited antimigratory and antiproliferative effects in fibro-
blasts/MSCs and attenuated TGFb-stimulated differentiation,
constituting mechanisms associated with fibrotic processes
(79). The relative resistance of mesenchymal stem cells to FG-
3019 and the preservation of MSC recruitment and paracrine
stimulation upon radiation might be relevant for the putative
regenerative function of MSC after radiation-induced lung dam-
age (53,79,80)
Our study is not without limitations. We used only one
eight-week FG-3019 administration scheme and one large single
radiation dose, and neither dose dependence nor different radi-
ation dose fractionations were examined. The complicated
interdependence
with
heart
damage
also
remains
to
be
elucidated.
Overall, the data on blocking CTGF in a mouse model of
radiation-induced lung toxicity are encouraging. The radiation-
induced fibrosis model is a relevant trauma that initiates a se-
ries of events over almost one year that result in fibrosis and
mimic what occurs in humans after irradiation. Transient ad-
ministration of FG-3019 to irradiated mice prevented and re-
versed lung remodeling, preserved lung function, and provided
a survival benefit. The monoclonal human antibody to CTGF
may represent a promising new strategy to prevent, attenuate,

 or reverse radiation-induced lung toxicity. The robustness and
the magnitude of the beneficial effects provide translational rel-
evance with potential for clinical transfer. FG-3019 is in clinical
development in several indications, including idiopathic pulmo-
nary fibrosis and pancreatic cancer. Our results indicate that
CTGF plays an important role in radiation-induced lung toxicity
and that blocking CTGF using FG-3019 could benefit patients un-
dergoing radiotherapy in the thorax or may benefit patients
with other forms of therapy-induced or idiopathic fibrotic
diseases.
