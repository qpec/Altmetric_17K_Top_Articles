Multiple studies have examined the risk of prenatal antidepressant exposure and risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with inconsistent results. Precisely estimating such risk, if any, is of great importance
in light of the need to balance such risk with the benefit of depression and anxiety treatment. We developed a method to integrate
data from multiple New England health systems, matching offspring and maternal health data in electronic health records to
characterize diagnoses and medication exposure. Children with ASD or ADHD were matched 1:3 with children without
neurodevelopmental disorders. Association between maternal antidepressant exposure and ASD or ADHD liability was examined
using logistic regression, adjusting for potential sociodemographic and psychiatric confounding variables. In new cohorts of 1245
ASD cases and 1701 ADHD cases, along with age-, sex- and socioeconomic status matched controls, neither disorder was
significantly associated with prenatal antidepressant exposure in crude or adjusted models (adjusted odds ratio 0.90, 95%
confidence interval 0.50 − 1.54 for ASD; 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.53 − 1.69 for ADHD). Pre-pregnancy antidepressant exposure
significantly increased risk for both disorders. These results suggest that prior reports of association between prenatal
antidepressant exposure and neurodevelopmental disease are likely to represent a false-positive finding, which may arise in part
through confounding by indication. They further demonstrate the potential to integrate data across electronic health records
studies spanning multiple health systems to enable efficient pharmacovigilance investigation.

INTRODUCTION
Prenatal exposure to medications that may disrupt serotonergic
neurotransmission has been proposed as an environmental risk
factor for autism, motivated largely by rodent studies demonstrat-
ing an impact of such disruption on subsequent behavior.1,2 In
multiple investigations based on registries, electronic health
records (EHRs), or claims databases, some indication of increased
risk following antidepressant exposure was identified, initially for
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and later for attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), although the extent to which
such risk represented confounding by indication could not be
confidently
determined,3,4
and
a
recent
large-scale
Danish
registry-based study did not replicate the ASD association.5
Likewise, in a previous EHR study in a large health system, we
did not detect elevated autism risk after controlling for aspects of
maternal psychopathology.6 However, elevated ADHD risk—with-
out clear mechanistic explanation—was detected and not fully
explained by maternal psychiatric illness.
The precise estimation of risk, if any, has substantial public
health implications. The decision to expose a developing fetus to
any medication is a difficult one for parents and clinicians; such a
decision may be even more fraught in case of depression and
related disorders, where the potential benefits of treatment are
still misunderstood by the lay press7 and clinicians despite
evidence that treatment discontinuation increases depressive
recurrence
risk
substantially.8
Therefore,
we
extended
our
methods to allow matching of children and mothers across
different health systems without exposing identifying information,
and applied this approach to identify another large, independent
cohort of children with ASD and ADHD and matched controls for a
replication study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Overview and data set generation
To maximize comparability with prior work, cohort definitions and analytic
strategies followed those described in our prior report.6 Sociodemographic
and clinical data were drawn from three independent EHRs: the Partners
HealthCare system, which spans Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH),
Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Newton-Wellesley Hospital, as well as
affiliated outpatient clinics; the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
(BIDMC); and the Boston Children’s Hospital. Additional maternal and
paternal data, as well as confirmation of matching accuracy between
mothers and offspring were obtained from the Massachusetts Registry of
Vital Records and Statistics.

 Specific data drawn from EHRs included sociodemographic data, billing
codes, problem lists and medications. These data were managed with the
i2b2 server software (i2b2 v1.6.04, Boston, MA, USA),9–11 a scalable
computational framework for managing human health data.
Mothers were identified on the basis of matching child’s date of birth
and surname, insurance identifiers and hospital encounter date. As a
further confirmation of match, and to address cases where children might
have different last names or where they might have been removed from
maternal custody, Massachusetts state birth certificates were queried for all
identified children. Where the mother − child matches could not be
confirmed, those pairs were omitted from analysis. Consistent with prior
reports, we restricted the analysis to one child per mother, choosing the
child with ASD or ADHD when a mother had both a case and control
offspring. When two case or two control children were identified from one
mother we randomly selected one child for inclusion in the study.
Matching across, institutions used a one-way hash of maternal and child
identifiers;12 this allowed unique individuals to be matched without
revealing names or other identifiers outside a given health system. For
example, investigators in the Partners HealthCare system never received
access to identifiers from the Children’s Hospital system, and vice versa.
Once the linking was complete, each mother and child was assigned a
study-specific identifier and all identifiers were removed from the
analysis file.
The Institutional Review Boards of Partners HealthCare, BIDMC and
Boston Children’s Hospital approved all aspects of this study. Access to
Massachusetts birth certificates was approved by the Massachusetts
Department of Public Health Institutional Review Board.
Cohort definition
Eligible children for the ASD cohort were identified from the Partners and
Boston Children’s Hospital EHRs if they met the following criteria: age
2 − 19 years; at least one ICD-9 code of 299 (pervasive developmental
disorder) between 1997 and 2010; delivered at MGH, Brigham and
Women’s Hospital, Newton-Wellesley Hospital or BIDMC. The ADHD cohort
comprised children age 2 − 19 years with at least one ICD-9 code of 314.x
and no ICD-9 code of 299 between 1997 and 2010, delivered at MGH,

 Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Newton-Wellesley Hospital or BIDMC. Prior
work demonstrated that these ICD-9 codes have a high sensitivity and
specificity for ASD and ADHD versus generally healthy control children
(that is, those without diagnosis or symptoms of ASD or ADHD) in the
Partners Healthcare system based on review of 50 ASD, ADHD and control
records by an experienced child neuropsychologist,6 as other reports also
suggested.3 Mother − child pairs included in our previous report were
excluded.
These children were then matched 1:3 with non-ASD control children
delivered at MGH, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Newton-Wellesley
Hospital or BIDMC with the same year of birth, birth hospital, sex, insurance
type as a proxy for socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity and preterm
versus full-term status. Children with any history of ASD, ADHD or
intellectual disability (ICD-9 of 299, 314 or 317 − 319) were excluded from
the control population. If fewer than three matches could be identified for
a case, year of birth was relaxed so that controls were born within 3 years
of a given case. Sixty-five ASD cases (2.5%) had no matches among healthy
control children and were excluded from primary analysis; their inclusion in
exploratory analysis did not change results; 107 ASD cases matched fewer
than 3 controls but were included in the analysis with 1 or 2 matched
controls. In all, 138 ADHD cases (3.5%) had no matches among healthy
control children and were excluded from primary analysis; their inclusion in
exploratory analysis did not change results; 317 ADHD cases matched
fewer than 3 controls but were included in the analysis with 1 or 2
matched controls.
Exposure definition
We used the definitions of exposure applied in prior work.3,6 Primary
analyses examined any exposure during pregnancy (from the 90 days
before
last
menstrual
period
(LMP)
through
delivery)
and
before
pregnancy (any time before LMP). Additional exposure windows were
calculated based on estimated LMP based on gestational age—this
included preconception (3 months before LMP), first trimester (0 − 90 days
following LMP), second trimester (91 − 180 days following LMP) and third
trimester (4180 days after LMP up to delivery). Exposures were identified
using e-prescribing data in the EHR, both inpatient and outpatient, which
record number of pills, frequency and refill number, allowing calculation of
exposure period. Even where the clinician is not the primary prescriber (for
example, for patients receiving psychiatric medications outside of this
health system), hospital policy requires reconciliation of medication lists at
outpatient visits and hospital admission. The exposure period was
truncated when discontinuation was recorded by the clinician. Exposure
was defined formally as overlap between a medication prescription
window and a given time period (entire pregnancy or trimester, for
example) By prior agreement between the Partners HealthCare system and
Surescript, medication dispensation data is not allowed to be applied for
research purposes and so is unavailable.
Analysis
Three sets of models were examined for association between individual
baseline variables and ASD or ADHD versus control status. In crude
analyses, simple conditional logistic regression estimated the odds ratios
for disease based on predictor. In model 1, conditional logistic regression
models also included gender, race, year of birth, type of maternal
insurance (public versus private) and median maternal income derived
from census tract; these variables were selected a priori as potential
confounding variables and to ensure consistency with our prior report.6 In
model 2, presence or absence of maternal major depressive disorder (ICD-9
code of 296.2x or 296.3x) was added to model 1, addressing confounding
by indication. Adjusted odds ratios were calculated for both model 1 and 2.
In light of concern for confounding by maternal psychopathology raised
in prior reports, proxies for maternal illness severity, including number of

 psychopharmacologic visits, number of psychotherapy visits, different
antidepressant medications in the prior year, and specific psychiatric
disorder or comorbidity were also examined in regression models.
All analyses used R 3.0.1 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria).
RESULTS
Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of the ASD and
ADHD cohorts, as well as the healthy controls matched 3:1 with
each case group. Table 1 also reports crude and adjusted odds
ratios for association between individual characteristics and
disease status. As in our prior report, greater maternal age was
associated with increased ASD risk, while younger maternal age
was associated with increased ADHD risk. For both diagnoses,
greater maternal (and paternal) education was associated with
decreased risk in offspring. Finally, for ADHD but not ASD,
offspring of mothers with public versus private insurance were at
elevated risk.
We next examined ASD and ADHD risk associated with
antidepressant exposure before and during pregnancy (Table 2).
For both ASD and ADHD, pre-pregnancy antidepressant use was

 associated with greater risk, even after adjustment for maternal
major depression. However, no significant increase in risk during
pregnancy as a whole, or with exposure during particular
trimesters, was observed for either disorder. To allow comparison
with prior reports, high and low/moderate-affinity antidepressants
were examined separately in regression models. Neither group
yielded
significant
associations
with
ASD
or
ADHD
risk
(Supplementary Table 1).
Finally, to elucidate the potential confounding effects of illness
severity, Table 3 summarizes features of maternal illness extracted
from the EHR. We observed that maternal psychotherapy appears
to be associated with a significant increase in ASD risk. Estimates
of risk for ASD or ADHD associated with individual maternal
diagnoses varied widely, suggesting the complexity of the familial
relationship between childhood neurodevelopmental disorders
and maternal psychiatric illness, and reflecting the modest
numbers of individuals represented despite the relatively large
case and control cohorts. However, incorporating individual terms
in risk models for ASD or ADHD did not meaningfully change
results: in no case was the resulting adjusted odds ratio changed
by 410%, nor was it significantly different from 1.
DISCUSSION
In an effort to clarify the risk for neurodevelopmental disorders
associated with prenatal antidepressant exposure, we applied a
novel methodology to identify a new and independent cohort of
ASD cases, another of ADHD cases, and matched cohorts of
healthy control children. Data were drawn from three large
Boston-based health systems as well as state birth certificate
records. For both ASD and ADHD, we find no significant increase
in risk associated with prenatal antidepressant exposure. Support-
ing the possibility that prior reports represent confounding by
indication, we do identify risk associated with pre-pregnancy
antidepressant exposure, and with prenatal maternal psychother-
apy. In other words, the requirement for maternal antidepressant
treatment, rather than the medication itself, may be associated
with risk for neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring.
We recognize that even estimates of risk derived from large
cohorts still represent only estimates. So, for example, we can only
exclude an increase in odds of ASD 454% with 95% confidence
interval. (By the same token, an equally likely prospect is a
protective effect of the same magnitude). In all cases, the risk of a
prescription for a given medication must be weighed against the
potential benefits. In aggregate, the present results should in
general increase confidence that any treatment-associated risk is
likely to be quite modest. Still, in light of recent media portrayals
of depression during pregnancy7 equating antidepressant use
with smoking, it is clear that, for some individuals, any risk would
be considered to be too great, perhaps because of an unwilling-
ness to recognize the potential neonatal morbidity as well as the
known maternal morbidity and mortality associated with depres-
sion and related disorders. In our prior report, we found evidence
of ADHD risk that persisted despite adjustment for maternal
psychopathology. We suggested at that time that, given the risk of
that finding representing a false positive, further study was
warranted.6 The present results suggest the importance of such
follow-up, indicating that ADHD risk is unlikely to be substantially
increased by antidepressant exposure. We also note that, unlike
ASD where a rodent model initially posited risk,6 the prior
probability for association between ADHD and antidepressant
exposure would be lower in the absence of a clear mechanism
of risk.
We could identify no reason for the discordance between this
result and our prior one with regard to ADHD. Of note, the non-
antidepressant risk factors for ASD and ADHD (for example,
maternal age and socioeconomic status) are still noted in the
present cohort, suggesting that in other respects it is similar to
those
in
prior
descriptions.
Likewise,
while
antidepressant
prescribing rates are somewhat lower (primarily because of the
inclusion of another hospital with lower antidepressant prescrib-
ing rates), the variables associated with such prescriptions remain
similar to those in our prior report. Incorporating terms for delivery
site, or diagnosis site, did not meaningfully impact results.
The present study has multiple limitations. First, as already
noted, we cannot exclude more modest risk, which would require
substantially greater sample sizes. Broader application of the
cross-institution approach we describe may represent; first, means
of generating such cohorts. Second, there persists some risk for
confounding, as any proxy of maternal psychopathology other
than direct measurement is imperfect. On the other hand, in light
of evidence of efficacy for depression treatment during preg-
nancy, a randomized trial might be challenged on ethical grounds.
Third, there is some risk of misclassification among control
subjects, if ASD or ADHD was diagnosed at another institution,
which would tend to decrease power to detect true association.
The relatively low prevalence of ASD should minimize the impact
of such misclassification; in contrast to most prior studies, by
spanning the two primary ASD referral centers (MGH and Boston
Children’s Hospital) in this region, the probability of such
misidentification is substantially diminished. Moreover, while we
used a case definition previously validated by chart review that
included scores from autism diagnostic observation scale,13 some
misclassification of cases may also diminish power.
In the context of prior reports, this study illustrates both the
power and the challenge of in silico pharmacovigilance studies.
Without recruitment of a single individual, existing EHR data
facilitated generation of a very large cohort of at-risk patients,
matching mothers and offspring. On the other hand, such
nonrandomized data presents a high risk for confounding, even
when EHRs with more detailed health data are available for
analysis. We also note that, while the data generation and analysis
required ~ 4 weeks, interactions with multiple institutional review
boards and development of protocols acceptable to these
independent bodies required nearly 2 years. Thus, while it is not
reflected directly in our results, we would argue that this study
also highlights the need for more consistent review policies and
protocols across institutions.
Taken together, our results in this new cohort provide some
clarification of the magnitude of risk reported in prior investiga-
tions. Paired with estimates of the benefit of treating depression
and related disorders during and after pregnancy, they should aid
patients and clinicians in decision-making about this class of
psychotropic medications. More broadly, these results illustrate a
strategy for linking across health systems to study rarer exposures
or outcomes.
