Adoptive T cell therapy (ATT) can be highly effective in 
treating individuals with late stage cancer. Treating meta-
static melanoma with in vitro expanded tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes achieved objective response rates (49–72%), de-
pending on the preconditioning regimen (Rosenberg et al., 
2011). This represents one of the most effective therapies of 
metastatic melanoma for patients amenable to ATT. Never-
theless, in 74/93 patients, tumors recurred within 3 yr after 
treatment (Rosenberg et al., 2011). Tumor recurrence can be 
attributed to the transferred T cells, the cancer, or the host. 
Metastatic melanoma trials suggested loss of the target anti-
gen (Melan-A/Mart-1) as escape mechanism (Y
ee et al., 2002; 
Mackensen et al., 2006), likely because of the poor binding 
of Melan-A/Mart-1 epitope to MHC class I (MHC-I) re-
striction element (HLA-A*0201), a factor that predicts tumor 
escape (Engels et al., 2013). In other cases, loss of the β2-mi-
croglobulin (β2m) gene and concomitant loss of MHC-I cell 
surface expression was suggested (Restifo et al., 1996; Paschen 
et al., 2003; Chang and Ferrone, 2007). The β2m gene is in 
close vicinity to a tumor suppressor gene frequently deleted 
in cancer (15q21.1; Feenstra et al., 1999; Leal et al., 2008), 
and loss of MHC-I appears to confer a growth advantage 
for cancer cells unrelated to immune effects (Garrido et al., 
2012). Therefore, it is unclear whether MHC-related genetic 
lesions are the result of immune escape or simply increased 
malignancy. Such a cause-and-effect relationship is difficult to 
address in the clinic, mainly because of the limited number 
of patients in which the T cell pressure might be sufficiently 
strong and persistent that the cancer cells indeed needed to 
escape. In most cases, the transferred T cells were specific for 
self-antigens and derived from the autologous repertoire, 
skewed toward low-avidity T cells (Lyman et al., 2005).
Cancer cells could evade T cell recognition by several 
other mechanisms. Defects in the proteasome or transporter 
associated with antigen processing could cause altered or im-
paired peptide generation (Androlewicz et al., 1993; Rock 
et al., 1994; Suh et al., 1994). IFN-γ responsiveness by the 
cancer cells favors their rejection (Dighe et al., 1994; Kaplan 
et al., 1998). It also increases MHC-I expression and induces 
components of the immunoproteasome, leading to a broader 
peptide pool (Kloetzel and Ossendorp, 2004). However, many 
MHC-I ligands are produced in the form of extended pre-
cursors that require the removal or trimming of amino acids 
to adapt to the constraints of the MHC-I peptide-binding 
site (Weimershaus et al., 2013). This trimming is mainly per-
Adoptive T cell therapy (ATT) can achieve regression of large tumors in mice and humans; however, tumors frequently recur. 
High target peptide-major histocompatibility complex-I (pMHC) affinity and T cell receptor (TCR)-pMHC affinity are thought 
to be critical to preventing relapse. Here, we show that targeting two epitopes of the same antigen in the same cancer cells 
via monospecific T cells, which have similar pMHC and pMHC-TCR affinity, results in eradication of large, established tumors 
when targeting the apparently subdominant but not the dominant epitope. Only the escape but not the rejection epitope re-
quired postproteasomal trimming, which was regulated by IFN-γ, allowing IFN-γ–unresponsive cancer variants to evade. The 
data describe a novel immune escape mechanism and better define suitable target epitopes for ATT.

formed by the endoplasmic reticulum–resident aminopepti-
dase ERA 
AP (the human homologue is ERAP1), which is 
also IFN-γ inducible (Saric et al., 2002; Serwold et al., 2002).
Target cell recognition by T cells is the result of a tri-
partite interaction between the peptide, the presenting MHC 
molecule, and the TCR. Targeting peptide–MHC-I com-
plexes (pMHC) with high affinity led to eradication of large 
established tumors, whereas targeting pMHC with low affin-
ity selected antigen loss variants (Engels et al., 2013). Similarly, 
high but not low TCR affinity for pMHC resulted in effec-
tive T cell responses with high affinity TCRs typically de-
riving from the nontolerant and low affinity TCRs from the 
tolerant repertoire (Theobald et al., 1995). Thus, if pMHC 
and pMHC-TCR affinities were similar for two peptide epi-
topes, T cells might be similarly effective or ineffective in re-
jecting tumors. Therefore, it was critical when comparing the 
usefulness of different peptide epitopes as targets for ATT to 
keep the model constant for all but one factor. 
T
o this end, we 
introduced TCRs into monospecific TCR transgenic CD8+ 
T cells specific for an antigen not expressed by the host or 
the cancer cells, which ensured that the CD8+ T cells redi-
rected with different TCRs had identical phenotype at the 
time of transfer. 
The 
TCRs were originally isolated from anti-
gen-negative hosts, i.e., the unskewed repertoire. By targeting 
two different epitopes of the same tumor antigen in the same 
cancer cells, we excluded the amount of antigen, frequency 
of variant clones, and tumor-induced immune suppression 
as possible factors for differential immune escape. Arguably, 
genetic instability of cancer cells and tumor burden are the 
highest risk factors for immune escape. Therefore, we treated 
tumors grown for several weeks to ∼1 cm diam (∼500 mm3), 
which corresponds to a clinically detectable mass of ∼109 
tumor cells (Yu et al., 2006).
We targeted two different epitopes of SV40 large T (T
-
Ag) in tumors whose growth depended on T
-Ag (Anders and 
Blankenstein, 2013). The H2-Kb–presented peptide IV (pIV) 
is dominant, with ∼11% of the CD8+ T cells in T
-Ag immu-
nized wild-type mice being pIV specific, demonstrating that 
the epitope is efficiently processed and presented under vac-
cine conditions (Mylin et al., 2000). The H2-Db–presented 
peptide I (pI) is sub-dominant, with ∼3% specific CD8+ T 
cells at peak levels. Nevertheless, pI-specific CD8+ T cells 
can eradicate large established tumors (Anders et al., 2011; 
Charo et al., 2011) and pIV-specific CD8+ 
T cells were shown 
to control autochthonous pancreatic or prostate carcinomas 
(Garbi et al., 2004; Otahal et al., 2007; Bendle et al., 2013). 
However, in these cases tumor burden at the time of ATT was 
probably too low to allow for the generation of escape vari-
ants. Here, we show that pI and pIV bind with similar affin-
ity to MHC-I, and that pI- and pIV-specific TCR-redirected 
CD8+ T cells (TCR-I and TCR-IV
, respectively) have similar 
affinity to the cognate pMHC. Both rejected large established 
tumors expressing high amounts of MHC-I molecules but 
tumors with low MHC-I were eradicated only by TCR-I 
T cells. TCR-IV T cells selected IFN-γ–unresponsive escape 
variants, which was possible because pIV
, but not pI, required 
postproteasomal trimming by ERA 
AP for efficient T cell 
recognition, suggesting that IFN-γ–independent epitopes are 
better targets for ATT.

(SD ± 3%; n = 4) and 77% (SD ± 3%; n = 4) for TCR-I and 
TCR-IV
, respectively. The expression levels, although similar 
between the two 
TCRs, were generally lower on OT
-1 
T cells 
(46%; SD ± 18% for TCR-I; n = 4; and 40%; SD ± 16% for 
TCR-IV; n = 4). We next compared the avidity of TCR-I 
and TCR-IV T cells by labeling them with pMHC multim-
ers, which can be dissociated into monomers, termed MHC 
Streptamers. The dissociation of MHC Streptamers from the 
T cell surface accurately measures koff-rates and was followed 
by confocal microscopy (Nauerth et al., 2013). The pMHC 
koff-rate was comparable for the two TCRs (36 s, SD ± 13 s 
for TCR-I; 46 s, SD ± 7 s for TCR-IV); if anything, the T1/2 
was longer for TCR-IV T cells (P = 0.002; Fig. 2 B). When 
we compared the functional avidity of TCR-I and TCR-IV 
T cells by measuring the levels of secreted IFN-γ upon rec-
ognition of peptide-loaded, transporter associated with anti-
gen processing–deficient RMA-S cells, we found that both 
TCR-I and TCR-IV T cells recognized lower peptide con-
centrations equally well (Fig. 2 C). These data exclude differ-
ences in TCR affinity as a major variable in our system.
Tet-TagLuc and 16.113p cells have similar T-Ag levels, 
whereas pI and IV have similar pMHC affinity and pMHC-I 
levels on the cell surface
T
o characterize the two T
-Ag+ cancer cell lines used in this 
study, Tet-TagLuc and 16.113p (Anders et al., 2011; Charo et 
al., 2011), we evaluated factors that can influence the likeli-
hood of tumor recurrence, such as pMHC affinity (Spiotto 
et al., 2004; Engels et al., 2013) and antigen expression lev-
els. T
et-TagLuc and 16.113p cells expressed similar levels of 
T
-Ag (Fig. 3 A). The affinity of pI and pIV for MHC-I was 
analyzed in a cell-free peptide competition assay. The pep-
tide concentrations needed for replacing 50% of the indica-
tor peptides bound to H2-Db and H2-Kb, respectively, were 
quite similar (IC50, 31 and 76 nM for pI and pIV
, respec-
tively; Fig. 3 B). Because the functional avidity was similar for 
TCR-I and TCR-IV T cells (Fig. 2 C), co-culturing these T 
cells with T
-Ag+ cancer cells could indirectly answer whether 
the two epitopes are equally well presented on the cancer cell 
surface. T
o maximize the surface expression of pI and pIV
, 
we stimulated T
et-TagLuc and 16.113p cells with IFN-γ for 
48 h. TCR-I and TCR-IV T cells recognized both cell lines 
equally well (Fig. 3 C), thus we conclude that the levels of 
surface expression was similar for both epitopes.
TCR-I and TCR-IV T cells reject Tet-TagLuc tumors, but 
16.113p tumors escape TCR-IV T cell pressure
Because MHC-I expression influences the amount of pep-
tide presented on the cell surface, we analyzed MHC-I ex-
pression by 
T
et-TagLuc and 16.113p cells. MHC-I expression 
(H2-Kb/Db) was lower for 16.113p (Kb/Db MFI, 10.5/4.8; 
SD ± 9.9/2.3; n = 3) compared with T
et-TagLuc cells (Kb/
Db MFI, 21.9/14.7; SD ± 21.3/6.3; n = 3), even after 
IFN-γ stimulation (Kb/Db MFI, 79.3/30; SD ± 60.9/10.8 
and 162.5/62.1 SD ± 137.1/29.4; n = 3, for 16.113p and

for T

16.113p tumors. T

by TCR-I and TCR-IV T cells, whereas in mock-treated 
mice tumors progressed (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, TCR-I T cells 
eradicated 16.113p tumors, whereas in 3/4 mice receiving 
TCR-IV T cells tumors eventually relapsed after initial re-
gression (Fig. 4 C). In total, 12/16 16.113p tumors recurred 
in TCR-IV T cell-treated mice and in 0/17 mice receiving 
TCR-I therapy (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that pMHC and pM-
HC-TCR affinities are not sufficient parameters to predict 
rejection epitopes. We next investigated whether TCR-IV 
T cell tumor recognition was impaired in vivo. We treated 
16.113p tumor-bearing mice with Renilla Luciferase (RLuc) 
expressing 
TCR-I and 
TCR-IV 
T cells (Charo et al., 2011) to 
monitor 
T cell accumulation at the tumor site by biolumines-
cent imaging. 
The signal for both 
TCR-I and 
TCR-IV 
T cells 
appeared at a similar time in the tumor and peaked at day 10 
(Fig. 5 A), indicating that tumor infiltration and proliferation 
of TCR-IV T cells was not impaired. T
o examine whether 
TCR-IV T cells were still functional in mice with recurrent 
tumor, we performed an in vivo kill assay. We injected those 
mice with unpulsed and pI- and pIV-pulsed splenocytes la-
beled with different CFSE concentrations and, after 16 h, an-
alyzed for specific kill of pIV-pulsed population. Naive and 
16.113-immunized C57BL/6 mice served as negative and 
positive controls. Unlike naive mice, immunized C57BL/6 
mice effectively killed both pI- and pIV-pulsed but not un-
pulsed cells. The specific pIV kill was 2.6% (SD ± 0.9%; n = 
3) for naive and 90.1% (SD ± 9.7%; n = 4) for immunized 
C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 5 B). TCR-IV T cells in mice with re-
current 16.113p tumors were still functional, as they lysed the 
pIV-pulsed splenocytes with 99.5% (SD ± 0.5%; n = 5) spe-
cific kill (Fig. 5 B), but not pI-pulsed or unpulsed splenocytes.
16.113p tumors escape TCR-IV T cells by 
disrupted IFN-γ signaling
Because TCR-IV T cells remained functional despite pro-
gressively growing tumors, seven escape variants were isolated 
from TCR-IV T cell–treated mice and analyzed for the mech-
anism of escape. We analyzed them for MHC-I and IFN-γ 
receptor (IFNγR) expression, and several other IFN-γ–in-
ducible genes, and all seven escape variants showed sim-
ilar results. The expression of H-2/Db and Kb molecules on 
the escape variants was lower when compared with the pa-
rental 16.113p cells and could not be clearly detected with 
individual antibodies (Fig. S1 A). Therefore, we amplified 
the MHC-I signal by using biotinylated pan MHC-I (anti- 
H-2/Db/Kb) antibody (Ab) and fluorochrome-coupled strepta-
vidin. 
Without IFN-γ stimulation, MHC-I expression was a bit 
lower for the 999 escape variant compared with the parental 
16.113p cells (16.113p/999 MFI: 56.6/18.8; SD ± 2.8/1.7; n 
= 2; Fig. 6 A). Upon IFN-γ stimulation, only parental 16.113p 
cells up-regulated MHC-I expression (16.113p/999 MFI: 
547/18.6; SD ± 124.5/0.8; n = 2), indicating that variants with 
acquired IFN-γ unresponsiveness had been selected under 
TCR-IV T cell pressure (Fig. 6 A and Fig. S1 B). Despite the 
IFN-γ unresponsiveness, 999 cells still expressed the IFNγR 
(16.113p/999 MFI, 1,214/1,924.5; SD ± 687.3/1,966.5; n =

2; Fig. 6 B), and so did the other TCR-IV escape variants (Fig. 
S1 C). We next analyzed the expression of several IFN-γ-in-
ducible genes involved in antigen processing and presentation 
(β1i/LMP2, β5i/LMP7, β2i/MECL-1, and ERA 
AP) by West-
ern blots (WBs). In contrast to parental 16.113p cells, none of 
the proteins were up-regulated in the 999 cells treated with 
IFN-γ for 48 h (Fig. 6 C). Thus, the escape variants had ac-
quired a defect in the IFN-γ signaling pathway, which allowed 
16.113p tumors to escape 
TCR-IV 
T cell therapy. Both STAT1 
and phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1) were detectable in the 
parental 16.113p cells, but not in 999 cells (Fig. 6 C), which 
suggests that the breakage in the IFN-γ signaling occurred 
further upstream in the cascade. Ligand-induced dimeriza-
tion of IFN-γ receptor leads to JAK1 and JAK2 activation and 
phosphorylation of STAT1. JAK1 was still present in IFN-γ–
stimulated 16.113p cells, whereas JAK2 was down-regulated 
(Fig. 6 C). These observations are in line with findings that 
IFN-γ also triggers a negative regulation loop by proteasomal 
targeting of ubiquitinated JAK2 (Ungureanu et al., 2002). In 
the 999 cells, JAK2 was still present and JAK1 was completely 
down-regulated, indicating that the signaling cascade was dis-
rupted at the level of JAK1, which had been observed before 
in human cancer cells (Dunn et al., 2005; Fig. 6 C). 
The 
WB of 
proteins for the IFN-γ–inducible genes and JAKs from the cell 
lysates of other escape variants are shown in Fig. S2 (A and B).
Recognition of pIV, but not pI, is dependent on IFN-γ signaling
T
o understand why the IFN-γ–unresponsive escape variants oc-
curred only upon TCR-IV
, but not TCR-I, T cell therapy, we 
analyzed their recognition by TCR-I and TCR-IV T cells in 
vitro and in vivo. For in vitro recognition, the parental 16.113p 
cell line and seven escape variants were incubated with TCR-I 
or 
TCR-IV 
T cells. In contrast to parental 16.113p cells, the rec-
ognition of the escape variants was impaired for TCR-IV but 
not 
TCR-I 
T cells (Fig. 7 A and Fig. S2 C), indicating that unlike 
for pIV
, the recognition of pI did not require IFN-γ signaling. 
TCR-IV T cells recognized 16.113p without IFN-γ pretreat-
ment (Fig. 7 A), suggesting that a small amount of pIV was pro-
duced in the absence of IFN-γ, enough to stimulate the T cells 
to secrete IFN-γ and further stimulate epitope production, lead-
ing to better recognition and more IFN-γ secretion. T
o obtain 
independent evidence that pIV was dependent on IFN-γ, we 
treated mice bearing T
et-TagLuc tumors, which are normally 
rejected by TCR-IV T cells (Fig. 4 B), with IFNγ−/− TCR-IV 
T cells to ask whether under these conditions tumors escaped. 
Mice with ∼4-wk-old established tumors (309 mm3; SD ± 216 
mm3) received 5 × 105 IFN-γ−/− TCR-I, IFN-γ−/− TCR-IV
, 
or mock (OT
-1) T cells. Tumors progressed in mock-treated 
cells and were rejected in most of the IFN-γ−/− TCR-I T cell–
treated mice (1/5 mice had a late relapse; Fig. 7 B). In contrast, 
T
et-TagLuc tumors in IFN-γ−/− TCR-IV T cell–treated mice 
regressed, in some cases completely, but finally resumed growth 
in 6/7 mice (9/10 tumors from two experiments; Fig. 7 B), con-
firming the critical role of IFN-γ for targeting pIV but not pI.
IFN-γ regulates pIV production through ERA 
AP
T

constitutive proteasome and the immunoproteasome. No 
qualitative and no major quantitative differences were ob-
served between the relevant cleavage products generated by 
either constitutive or immunoproteasomes (Fig. 8 and Fig. 
S3). Both, standard and immunoproteasome efficiently gener-
ated the T-Ag206-215 epitope (pI) from T
-Ag196-221 polypeptide 
(Fig. 8 A and Fig. S3 A), and produced minor amounts of 
potential epitope precursor peptides plus the corresponding 
N-terminal flanking cleavage products (Fig. 8 A and Fig. S3 
A). 
The precise minimal 
T
-Ag404-411 epitope (pIV) was difficult 
to detect and proteasomes generated only minor amounts of 
this minimal epitope (Fig. 8 B and Fig. S3 B). In contrast, 
N-terminally extended potential epitope precursor peptides 
plus their corresponding N-terminal flanking cleavage prod-
ucts were generated prominently (Fig. 8 B and Fig. S3 B). 
Additionally, we detected N-terminally extended cleavage 
products with methionine as C-terminal residue (Fig. 8 B 
and Fig. S3 B). This cleavage results indicated that efficient 
production of pIV required post-proteasomal trimming. Be-
cause up-regulation of ERA 
AP was impaired in the 16.113p 
escape variants (Fig. 6 C), we asked whether ERA 
AP was 
responsible for pIV generation. An escape variant was trans-
duced with retrovirus containing ERAP1-GFP or only GFP
, 
and GFP sorted. 
The GFP expression of sorted cells was stable 
over time for the cells that were transduced with GFP only, 
but not for ERAP1-GFP–transduced cells (Fig. 9 A). There-
fore, three stably transduced clones were GFP selected from 
ERAP1-GFP–transduced cells, where clone 1 and 4 over-
expressed ERAP1, whereas clone 2 was negative (Fig. 9 B). 
The GFP selected clones were similar to the original escape 
variant when other IFN-γ–inducible genes were compared 
(Fig. 9 B). 
We next compared the in vitro recognition of these 
cells by TCR-I and TCR-IV T cells. Because TCR-I T cells 
already recognize the original escape variants, introduction 
of ERAP1 in the escape variant did not affect TCR-I T cell 
recognition (Fig. 9 C). For TCR-IV T cells, the recogni-
tion of the escape variant was restored by introduction of 
ERAP1 (Fig. 9 C), demonstrating that ERA 
AP facilitates the 
IFN-γ–regulated generation of pIV
. However, the levels of 
secreted IFN-γ were a bit lower in comparison to the values 
obtained upon recognition of parental 16.113p cells. This was 
not surprising considering that all the other IFN-γ–inducible 
proteins contributing to pMHC T cell recognition were still 
down-regulated in the selected clones.
IFN-γ–resistant variants appear only in established tumors 
despite the presence of endogenous T cells
Current models often use therapy a few days after cancer cell 
inoculation, which does not compare to tumors detected in the 
clinic. Assuming genetic instability and tumor burden as critical 
factors for generation of variants, we treated mice with 16.113p 
tumors grown for a short or long time period. Mice bearing 
large established tumors (533 mm3; SD ± 293 mm3) grown for 
∼30 d or small tumors grown for ∼10 d (36 mm3, SD ± 21 
mm3) were treated with 5 × 105 TCR-IV or mock T cells. In 
mock-treated mice, tumors progressed for both small and large 
tumors (Fig. 10 A). As expected, large established tumors re-
gressed, but then recurred in all 
TCR-IV–treated mice; however, 
small 16.113p tumors were rejected and did not relapse during 
a 3-mo observation time (Fig. 10 A). These data suggest that 
variants occurred with low frequency and were present only in 
large tumors. Therefore, the IFN-γ–resistant variants likely also 
occurred in mice treated with TCR-I T cells, but were recog-
nized and eliminated, which makes IFN-γ–independent epi-
topes better targets for ATT. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude 
Figure 7. Recognition of 16.113p escape variants by TCR-IV T cells 
is IFN-γ-dependent as well as the rejection of Tet-TagLuc tumors.

the possibility that these variants would not have developed in 
the presence of functional endogenous 
T cells, as it is known that 
ERAP1 deficiency can lead to an altered peptide pool and im-
munogenicity (Hammer et al., 2007; James et al., 2013). T
o clar-
ify this, we challenged T
-Ag tolerant (LoxP-TagLuc-pA/CM2) 
mice (Buschow et al., 2010; Anders et al., 2012) with 16.113p 
cells to allow tumor growth in the presence of endogenous T 
cells. ∼3 wk later, when the tumors were large enough to pos-
sibly contain the variants (201.9 mm3; SD ± 120.6 mm3), mice 
were irradiated and treated with 5 × 105 TCR-IV T cells (one 
mouse received irradiation only). In the mouse which received 
irradiation only, the tumor progressed, whereas in the mice with 
irradiation and TCR-IV T cell transfer, tumors were rejected in 
2/6 mice (Fig. 10 B). In the other four mice, tumors initially 
regressed, but later recurred (Fig. 10 B). 
We isolated those tumors 
and analyzed whether they were still responsive to IFN-γ. In 1/4 
tumors, MHC-I expression was up-regulated upon IFN-γ stim-
ulation (Fig. 10 C). It could be that the T cells became tolerant 
in this mouse because the LoxP-TagLuc-pA mice express low 
levels of 
T
-Ag in normal tissues (Buschow et al., 2010). However, 
the remaining three tumors were IFN-γ unresponsive and could 
not up-regulate MHC-I (Fig. 10 C), demonstrating that similar 
escape variants also occur in immunocompetent mice.

As ATT becomes widely applicable and efficacy will con-
tinuously increase, tumor recurrence of escape variants will 
remain a major problem. Because too many factors can cause 
tumor recurrence, a reductionist approach is most suitable to 
firmly uncover the underlying mechanisms. Previous stud-
ies in which the peptide epitope was the only variable had 
shown that high pMHC affinity is a critical factor to prevent 
tumor recurrence (Engels et al., 2013). Compatible with these 
data, both pI and pIV with relatively high pMHC affinity 
served as rejection epitopes in the T
et-TagLuc tumor model. 
However, pMHC affinity was not sufficient to predict the 
“rejection epitope” when 16.113p tumors expressing low 
levels of MHC-I were targeted. TCR-I T cells targeting the 
subdominant epitope pI rejected large established tumors, 
whereas tumors in most cases escaped 
TCR-IV 
T cells target-
ing the dominant epitope pIV
. 
Thus, immunodominance does 
not predict rejection epitopes, reminiscent of murine virus 
models, in which T cells against subdominant but not domi-
nant epitopes were protective (Gallimore et al., 1998). In the 
clinic, mainly dominant epitopes have been targeted, because 
subdominant epitopes are difficult to identify.
Just as the antigen amount determines the efficiency 
of ATT, with higher antigen levels preventing tumor recur-
rence (Spiotto et al., 2004), the MHC-I level might have a 
similar role because the actual amount of the surface pre-
sented epitope is influenced by it (Cormier et al., 1999). 
With 
16.113p cells inherently expressing lower levels of MHC-I, 
the TCR-IV T cells might not have acquired as much stim-
uli as with Tet-TagLuc tumors to produce enough effector 
Figure 8. Epitope I is produced in sufficient 
amounts by the proteasome, whereas epitope IV 
requires postproteasomal trimming. Shown are 
the relevant cleavage products detected in standard 
proteasome digestions of T-Ag196-221 (A) and T-Ag398-417 
(B) in three independent experiments. Irrelevant pep-
tide-products are indicated in black, and the epitope 
and epitope precursor peptides are indicated in red 
and blue, respectively. For pIV, peptide precursors for 
an alternative epitope with methionine on the C ter-
minus are shown in green. Thickness of the cleavage 
products indicates relative cleavage intensity.

molecules for tumor stroma destruction as a prerequisite for 
preventing tumor recurrence by escape variants (Spiotto et 
al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2008; Anders and Blankenstein, 2013). 
TCR-I T cells rejected the MHC-I high expressing Tet- 
TagLuc tumors and the MHC-I low expressing 16.113p 
tumors. Therefore, when targeting a suitable epitope, the 
levels of MHC-I may not be as an important factor for 
cancer eradication as previously believed, which is encour-
aging considering that many tumors express low levels of 
MHC-I (Bukur et al., 2012). However, the amount of pro-
duced epitopes should be sufficiently high to compensate 
for the low MHC-I levels.
IFN-γ secretion by T cells was essential for tumor 
rejection in most analyzed models (Zhang et al., 2008; Lis-
topad et al., 2013), probably acting in multiple ways. It 
needs to act on the tumor stroma to induce vasculature 
destruction (Qin and Blankenstein, 2000; Briesemeister et 
al., 2011; Schietinger et al., 2013). Its effect on the cancer 
cells is controversial. Some studies suggested that tumor 
rejection required IFN-γ responsiveness by the cancer cells 
(Dighe et al., 1994; Kaplan et al., 1998), whereas others 
suggested that IFN-γ–unresponsive cancer cells were re-
jected at equal levels as the IFN-γ–responsive counterparts 
(Mumberg et al., 1999; Qin and Blankenstein, 2000). Our 
data may resolve this discrepancy, as they suggest that ef-
fective pIV-targeting requires the cancer cells to respond 
to IFN-γ, whereas pI-targeting does not. IFN-γ action on 
the cancer cells was suggested to increase T cell recogni-
tion by up-regulation of MHC molecules and/or com-
ponents of the proteasome (Dighe et al., 1994), notably 
before ERA 
AP was discovered (Saric et al., 2002; Serwold 
et al., 2002). Because the immunoproteasome appears to 
generate quantitatively but not qualitatively different pep-
tides (Mishto et al., 2014), it could not explain why tumors 
escaped TCR-IV but not 
TCR-I 
T cells, especially because 
pIV as the dominant epitope is usually efficiently gener-
ated. In contrast, ERA 
AP generates qualitatively different 
peptides (Hammer et al., 2006; York et al., 2006), thus the 
differential amounts of pI and pIV generated in the IFN-γ–
unresponsive variants allowed tumors to escape only under 
TCR-IV T cell pressure, indicating that IFN-γ–indepen-
dent epitopes qualify as rejection epitopes if all the other 
parameters are met. Therefore, any cancer containing vari-
ants with loss in genes that play a role in IFN-γ signaling 
(Abril et al., 1998; Kaplan et al., 1998; van Hall et al., 2006; 
Respa et al., 2011) could result in tumor escape if the gen-
eration of the targeted epitope depended on ERAP1.
The impaired recognition of the escape variants by 
TCR-IV T cells was probably a result of the combined ef-
fect of overall down-regulation of IFN-γ–inducible genes 
Figure 9. Expression of ERAP1 in escape variants restores recogni-
tion by TCR-IV T cells. (A) 1575 cells were transduced with either pMP71-

that contributed to poor epitope presentation which made 
them therapy resistant and allowed escape. Neverthe-
less, ERAP1-reconstitution in the escape variants restored 
TCR-IV T cell recognition, suggesting that efficient epi-
tope IV generation was directly linked to IFN-γ–regu-
lated postproteasomal trimming. However, the inability to 
up-regulate IFN-γ–inducible genes did not abolish elimi-
nation of the escape variants within 16.113p tumors when 
they were treated by TCR-I T cells, showing that these 
therapy-resistant variants still produced enough pI epitope. 
ERA 
AP deficiency leads to altered peptide pool which has 
been associated with increased immunogenicity (Hammer 
et al., 2007; James et al., 2013). Nevertheless, in our model 
the IFN-γ–unresponsive variants developed in established 
tumors independently of the presence of the endogenous 
T cells, suggesting that IFN-γ–resistant variants can develop 
naturally without causing immunogenicity.
Although the exact mechanism of escape that we see 
in our model has not yet been described after ATT in the 
clinic, a polymorphism in ERAP1 appears to be associated 
with poor prognosis in human papillomavirus–induced 
cervical carcinoma (Mehta et al., 2009). Moreover, im-
mune escape caused by ineffective N-terminal trimming 
by ERAP1 has been described for HIV and CMV infec-
tions (Draenert et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2011). Therefore, 
when selecting rejection epitopes for ATT, it should be 
taken into consideration whether the epitope produc-
tion is dependent on ERAP1.

All mouse studies were in accordance with institutional,

bers were purchased from Taconic: Rag−/− (RAG2), P14 
(4138; these mice were additionally backcrossed to Rag−/− 
to obtain P14/Rag−/− mice), OT-1/Rag−/− (4175) and 
CD45.1 (4007). ChRLuc/OT-1/Rag−/− mice were previ-
ously described (Charo et al., 2011), and OT-1/IFN-γ−/−/
Rag−/− were provided by T. Schüler (Institute for Molec-
ular and Clinical Immunology, Magdeburg, Germany). 
LoxP-TagLuc-pA mice (Buschow et al., 2010) were crossed 
to CM2 mice (Anders et al., 2012) to generate LoxP-Ta-
gLuc-pA/CM2 mice. Male or female mice aged 2–8 mo 
were used in animal experiments.

Cells
RPMI and DMEM media (Gibco) used in cell culture 
were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS (PAN 
Biotech), 50 µg/ml gentamicin (Gibco), and 50 µM mer-
captoethanol (Gibco; hereafter referred as RPMI-all and 
DMEM-all). Hek-T cells were used as packaging cells for 
retroviral vectors. MCA-205 (Anders et al., 2011) cells were 
used as T
-Ag–negative controls. T
et-TagLuc cells were pre-
viously described (Anders et al., 2011) and 16.113p cells 
(16.113FP; Charo et al., 2011) were generated by one time 
in vivo passage of 16.113 cells (Willimsky and Blankenstein, 
2005) in a P14/Rag−/− mouse. The seven 16.113p escape 
variants (999, 1004, 1575, 1577, 2100, 2106, and 2099) iso-
lated from Rag−/− mice and the four 16.113p escape variants 
(29839, 29836, 29840, and 29846) from LoxP-TagLuc-pA/
CM2 mice were generated from relapsed tumors when they 
reached the size of ∼500 mm3. Tumors were excised, cut in 
small fragments and incubated for 6 h at 37°C in collage-
nase (1 mg/ml; Invitrogen) supplemented DMEM-all, after 
which they were cultured for 1 wk in DMEM-all supple-
mented with 1x antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen), and then 
only DMEM-all was used. No routine cell line validation or 
mycoplasma testing was performed.
Gene vectors and transfection
TCR-I (Staveley-O’Carroll et al., 2003) and TCR-IV con-
structs containing α and β chains separated by the 2A ele-
ment of porcine teschovirus (β-P2A-α) were designed using 
Vector NTI software (Invitrogen). TCR-I and TCR-IV were 
cloned into individual pMP71 vectors using EcoRI and NotI 
restriction sites. pMSCV vector encoding for GFP (pMIG) 
was used as mock control. Retroviral supernatants were gen-
erated by cotransfecting (1:1) ≥70% confluent Hek-T cells 
with pMP71-TCR-I, pMP71-TCR-IV
, or mock (GFP) plas-
mids together with pCL-eco vector (Imgenex) using Lipo-
fectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s 
protocol. In brief, a total of 3 µg DNA was added to 500 µl 
OptiMEM medium (Gibco) preincubated for 5 min at RT 
with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 
The mix was incubated 
for 20 min at RT and subsequently resuspended in 1.5 ml 
DMEM-all and added to 6-well plate containing ≥70% con-
fluent Hek-T cells. The cells were incubated for 8-15 h, after 
which the medium was replaced by RPMI-all. Supernatants 
were collected 48 and 72 h after transfection, filtered (0.45-
µm pore size) and used in T cell transduction. ERAP1 was 
subcloned from pPM-hERAP1-HA (BioCat GmbH) into 
pMP71-IRES-GFP by NotI and SalI restriction sites, result-
ing in pMP71-ERAP1-IRES-GFP retroviral vector.
Expansion of T cells and retroviral transduction
Spleens were isolated from P14/Rag−/− or OT
-1/Rag−/− 
mice and prepared as a single-cell suspension with ACK 
(150 mM NH4Cl [Merck], 1 mM KHCO3 [Roth], and 
0.1 mM Na2EDTA [Roth], pH 7.2) lysis of red blood cells. 
1–2 × 106 cells were cultured in 24-well plates in 1 ml of 
RPMI-all supplemented with 1 µg/ml anti (α)-CD3 (clone 
145-2C11), 0.1 µg/ml α-CD28 (clone 37.51) purified Ab 
(BD) and 10 IU/ml IL-2 (Proleukin; Prometheus Laborato-
ries) for 24 h at 37°C in 5% CO2 humidified incubator. After 
24-h activation, media was removed from the splenocytes and 
replaced with 1 ml/well virus supernatant containing 10 µg/
ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were spinoculated 
for 2 h at 800 g and 32°C. Virus supernatant was removed 
and replaced with 1 ml RPMI-all containing 10 IU IL-2. 
Cells were transduced twice, with an interval of 24 h. The 
level of surface TCR expression was measured 24 or 48 h 
after the last transduction. Similarly, 106 1575 escape variant 
cells were plated on 6-well plates 1 d before transduction. 
The cells were spinoculated twice with a 24-h interval with 
2 ml/well of virus supernatant (pMP71-ERAP1-IRES-GFP 
or pMP71-IRES-GFP) containing polybrene as described 
above in this paragraph. After expansion in culture (transduc-
tion ratio; ≈10% for pMP71-IRES-ERAP1-GFP) the cells 
were sorted for GFP and cloned.
Flow cytometry and cytokine release assays
Transduced T cells were stained with α-CD8 Ab (APC; clone 
53–6.7) and the TCR cell surface expression was measured 
by pI- and pIV-specific PE-conjugated H2-Db and H2-Kb 
tetramers (H2-Db SAI 
NNY 
AQKL and H2-Kb VVY 
DFL 
KL 
[anchor modified, in other assays native peptide was used]; 
tetramer I and tetramer IV; Beckman Coulter). Up-regula-
tion of MHC-I on the tumor cells was obtained by incuba-
tion with 100 ng/ml IFN-γ (Gibco) for 24–48 h. MHC-I 
expression was measured by staining with α-H2-Db (FITC; 
clone KH95; BD) and α-H2-Kb (FITC; clone AF6-88.5; 
BD). Alternatively, subsequent staining with biotinylated 
α-H-2Kb/Db Ab (clone 28–8-6; BD) and streptavidin-APC 
(BD) was used to increase the MHC-I signal. 16.113p and 
the escape variants were stained for IFNγR by biotinylated 
α-CD119 Ab (clone 2E2; BD) and streptavidin-APC (BD). 
The signal was amplified using FAS 
ER kit (BD) according 
to the manufacturer’s protocol. T
et-TagLuc and 16.113p cells 
were stained for intracellular T
-Ag expression using the Cy-
tofix/Cytoperm kit (BD) with α-T
-Ag–specific Ab (FITC; 
PAb108; BD) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells 
derived from CD45.1 mice were identified from total spleno-
cytes by staining with α-CD45.1 Ab (APC; clone A20; BD). 
For the cytokine release assay, 105 transduced CD8+ T cells 
were co-cultured with 5 × 104 of target tumor cells (that were 
≥80% confluent at the day of experiment, ±IFN-γ/48 h) in 
200 µl RPMI-all media supplemented with 5 IU/ml IL-2 
(Proleukin; Prometheus Laboratories) for 24 h on 37°C in 
96-well plates (200 µl/well). For functional avidity, 5 × 104 
TCR-I and TCR-IV transduced CD8+ T cells were co-cul-
tured with equal numbers of RMA-S cells pulsed with ti-
trated amounts of freshly dissolved pI or pIV (10−5–10−15 M). 
The cell supernatants from the co-cultures were tested 24 h 
later for cytokine levels by mouse IFN-γ ELI 
SA kits (BD) 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

o visualize 
monomeric pMHC-I on the surface of living T cells, a flu-
orochrome was conjugated to a cysteine on a linker at the 
end of the Streptag sequences. For MHC multimerization, 
1 µg of Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated MHC-I and 0.75 µg 
Streptactin-PE were diluted in a final volume of 50 µl FACS 
buffer for each staining (up to 5 × 106 cells), and incubated 
for at least 45 min. Before MHC Streptamer binding T cells 
were kept on ice for at least 30 min to minimize the risk 
of MHC Streptamer internalization. Cells were subsequently 
resuspended in 50 µl Streptamer solution and incubated on 
ice in the dark for 45 min after which they were stained 
with α-CD8 Ab (20 min) and sorted on MoFlo Legacy Cell 
Sorter (Beckman Coulter).
The koff-rate of monomeric pMHCs from 
TCRs on liv-
ing T cells was analyzed as previously described (Nauerth et 
al., 2013). In brief, cells were kept at 4°C during the whole 
analysis by a precooled water-cooling device, connected to a 
Peltier cooler. 1 µl of cells was pipetted into a reservoir built 
of a customized metal insert, which fitted exactly into the 
cooling device that was sealed with a coverslip at the bottom. 
T
o arrest cells and therefore facilitating monitoring of single 
cells, a polycarbonate membrane and a small metal shim were 
added on top of the cells. 4°C cold FACS buffer was added 
to the cells, the metal shim was put into the cooling device 
on the inverse microscope and a time series was started on 
the microscope, taking one picture every 10 min. By addition 
of d-biotin after the first picture, which diffuses through the 
5-µm pore of the membrane, the MHC Streptamer complex 
on the cells disrupts and monomeric Alexa Fluor 488–labeled 
p-MHC dissociate from the T cell surface. Time series were 
run until complete dissociation of pMHCs. Alexa Fluor 488–
fluorescence intensities of single cells were background and 
bleaching corrected and plotted over time. T
o calculate the 
koff-rate and half-life of TCR–pMHC interaction an expo-
nential decay was fitted into the data.
Peptide competition assay
Purification of MHC molecules by affinity chromatography 
has been previously described (Sidney et al., 2001). Assays to 
quantitatively measure peptide binding to MHC-I molecules 
are based on the inhibition of binding of a high affinity radiola-
beled peptide to purified MHC molecules, and are performed 
essentially as described previously (Sidney et al., 2001, 2008). 
In brief, 0.1–1 nM of radiolabeled peptide is coincubated at 
room temperature with 1 µM–1 nM of purified MHC in the 
presence of a cocktail of protease inhibitors and 1 µM β2m. 
After a 2-d incubation, MHC-bound radioactivity is deter-
mined by capturing pMHC complexes on α-H2-Kb (clone 
B24-8-3) or α-H2-Db (clone 28–14-8s) Ab-coated Lumitrac 
600 plates (Greiner Bio-one), and measuring bound cpm 
using the T
opCount (Packard Instrument Co.) microscintilla-
tion counter. In the case of competitive assays, the concentra-
tion of peptide yielding 50% inhibition of the binding of the 
radiolabeled peptide is calculated. Under the conditions used, 
where [label]<[MHC] and IC50 ≥ [MHC], the measured 
IC50 values are reasonable approximations of the true kD val-
ues (Cheng and Prusoff, 1973; Gulukota et al., 1997). Each 
competitor peptide (H2-Db–specific SAI 
NNY 
AQKL and 
H2-Kb–specific VVY 
DFL 
KC, pI and pIV
, respectively) was 
tested at six different concentrations covering a 100,000-fold 
dose range, and in three or more independent experiments. 
As a positive control, unlabeled version of the radiolabeled 
probe was also tested in each experiment. The indicator pep-
tides used were Adenovirus E1A P7>Y (SGP 
SNT 
YPEI) for 
H2-Db and 
VSV NP52-59 (RGY 
VFQ 
GL) for H2-Kb.
In vivo kill assay
1 wk before the assay, C57BL/6 mice were immunized by 
i.p. injection of 107 16.113 cells resuspended in 100 µl PBS 
to be used as positive controls. Spleen was isolated from a 
CD45.1 mouse and single-cell suspension was prepared. After 
red blood cell lysis with ACK buffer for 2 min, splenocytes 
were washed twice with 1x PBS (Gibco) and divided into 
three tubes. The cells were either left untreated or incubated 
with pI or anchor-modified pIV (VVY 
DFL 
KL), at a final 
concentration of 0.5 µM at 37°C for 30 min. Subsequently, 
the three populations were labeled with different concentra-
tion of CFSE (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37°C for 15 min. 
The final CFSE concentration was 0.025, 0.25, and 2.5 µM 
for unpulsed, pI-, and pIV-pulsed cells, respectively. The cells 
were washed three times with PBS, the different populations 
were mixed at 1:1:1 ratio, and 5–10 × 106 cells in 100 µl 
PBS were i.v. injected into the mice. 16 h later, spleens were 
isolated and splenocytes were stained with α-CD45.1 Ab and 
analyzed by flow cytometry.
WB
Cells were lysed in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 
5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor 
(cOmplete; Roche). 20 µg of total protein extracts were sep-
arated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose 
membrane (Optitran BA-S 85 Reinforced NC; Whatman). 
The membrane was incubated in PBS supplemented with 
0.4% T
ween-20 and 5% dry milk for 1 h. Primary antibod-
ies recognizing Jak1 (6G4; Cell Signaling T
echnology), Jak2 
(D2E12; Cell Signaling T
echnology), Stat1 (polyclonal; Cell 
Signaling T
echnology), Phospho-Stat1 (58D6 [T
yr701]; Cell 
Signaling T
echnology), ERAP1 (6H9), MECL (K6512), 
LMP2 (polyclonal; Abcam), LMP7 (polyclonal; Abcam), or 
β-Actin (C4; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were diluted 
in PBS/0.1% T
ween-20 and 2.5% dry milk and were ap-
plied overnight at 4°C. The membrane was washed three 
times with PBS/0.1% T
ween-20 followed by 1-h incubation 
with the secondary Ab (0.2 µg/ml goat anti–rabbit IgG H&L 
chain–specific peroxidase conjugate, rabbit anti–mouse IgG 
 2345
JEM Vol. 213, No. 11
H&L chain–specific peroxidase conjugate, or rabbit anti–
goat IgG H&L chain–specific peroxidase conjugate; EMD 
Millipore). The ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection kit 
(GE Healthcare) was used for detection. Membranes were 
analyzed with the Fusion FX System using FusionCapt Ad-
vance FX7 Software (Peqlab).
Tumor challenge and adoptive T cell transfer
Age- and sex-matched mice were injected s.c. into the right 
flank with 5 × 106 tumor cells in 100 µl PBS. On the day of 
ATT, mice were ranked by tumor size and equal mean tumor 
sizes were allocated to different therapy groups. Mice received 
5 × 104 or 5 × 105 CD8+ T cells in 100 µl PBS i.v. Tumor 
size was measured by caliper, and the mean tumor size was 
determined from the measurements along three orthogonal 
axes (a, b, and c). 
Tumor volumes were calculated according to 
this formula: V (mm3) = (a × b × c)/2. Mice were sacrificed 
when the tumors reached 15 mm mean diameter. Animals 
were excluded from analysis if they died from reasons unre-
lated to tumor burden, and the experimenter was not blinded 
with respect to treatment groups. No prespecified effect size 
was used to determine sample sizes in animal studies.
Bioluminescence imaging
In vivo imaging was performed using a Xenogen IVIS 200 
(Caliper Lifescience). A maximum of five anesthetized mice 
were imaged at once. Each mouse received an i.v. injection of 
freshly prepared coelenterazine (Biosynth) that was dissolved 
in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) and diluted in PBS (100 µg/100 µl 
per mouse; Charo et al., 2011). Images were acquired for 
 
1 min using small binning. All data were analyzed using Liv-
ing Image analysis software (Caliper Lifescience). The region 
of interest for the measured signal was drawn at the tumor site 
identically for all mice and was set anew for each experiment.
Proteasomal isolation, peptide cleavage, 
and mass spectrometry (MS)
20S proteasomes were purified from T2, T2.27, or lympho-
blastoid cell lines as previously reported (Theobald et al., 
1998) and the purity was verified by SDS-PAGE electro-
phoresis (12.5% poly-acrylamide gel stained with Coomassie 
dye). Synthetic peptides at different concentrations (from 20 
to 80 µM) were digested by 1–5 µg 20S proteasomes in 100 µl 
TEAD buffer (20 mM 
Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium azide, 
and 1 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.2) for different time periods 
(from 1 to 24 h) at 37°C. Digestions were stopped with 0.1 
vol of trifluoroacetic acid and frozen. All experiments were 
repeated at least twice. In liquid chromatography runs, the 
peptide separation was performed on a 1 mm RP column 
(Beta Basic-18, 100 mm × 1 mm, 3 mm, 150 Å; Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) using a Surveyor system (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific). The mobile phase (A) was 100% water containing 
0.05% (vol/vol) trifluoroacetic acid, and (B) was 70:30 (vol/
vol) acetonitrile/water containing 0.045% (vol/vol) trifluoro-
acetic acid. 
The elution was performed on binary gradient: 3% 
B 10 min, 3–63% B in 32 min. A flow rate of 30 µl/min was 
used. Online MS analysis was performed by DECA XP MAX 
iontrap instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MS data were 
acquired with a triple scan method in positive ion mode (MS: 
mass range, 200–2000 m/z; zoom scan, MS/MS). Analysis of 
ESI/MS data were accomplished using Bioworks version 3.3 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Database searching was performed 
using the following parameters: no enzyme, mass tolerance for 
fragment ions 1.5 amu (atomic mass unit). In time-dependent 
processing experiments (signal intensity versus time of diges-
tion) the kinetics of the identified peaks was analyzed by using 
LCQuan software version 2.5 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed on data obtained with koff-
rate assay. Sample groups were compared using a two-sided 
Wilcoxon rank sum test. 
The variances of the two groups were 
compared by F-test and were not equal (p-value = 0.039).
