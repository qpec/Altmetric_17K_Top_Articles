What Do Women Really Want? Lessons
for Breastfeeding Promotion and Education
Amy Brown
Abstract
Background: Promoting breastfeeding is a strategic priority, but breastfeeding rates remain low in the United
Kingdom. Women value breastfeeding promotion and education, but a different strategy may be needed to
continue to raise breastfeeding rates. New mothers, as the experts, are best placed to inform these changes. The
current study explored new mothers’ attitudes toward breastfeeding education and promotion, evaluating ex-
periences and examining ideas for change.
Materials and Methods: One thousand one hundred thirty mothers with a baby aged 0–2 years old who had
planned to breastfeed at birth completed a questionnaire consisting of both closed and open-ended questions
exploring their attitudes to breastfeeding promotion and support.
Results: Overall, the findings showed that mothers valued breastfeeding information, but believed that changes
needed to be made to current messages. Key themes included a move away from the perception that breastfeeding
is best (rather than normal), emphasis on wider values other than the health benefits of breastfeeding, and a
message that every feed, rather than just 6 months exclusive breastfeeding, matters. Mothers also highlighted the
need for promotion and education to target family members and wider society rather than simply mothers
themselves, all of whom influenced both directly or indirectly maternal decision and ability to breastfeed. Mothers
suggested ideas for promotional campaigns or how specific groups or methods could be used to increase support,
including education for children, TV adverts, and using established online sources of breastfeeding information.
Conclusions: The findings are important both for those supporting new mothers to breastfeed and those
involved in breastfeeding policy and promotional messages.
Introduction
T
he importance of breastfeeding for infant and
maternal health is well established,1,2 with breastfeeding
recognized as a key strategy to improve population health and
reduce inequalities.3 Promoting breastfeeding is therefore
an important strategy for optimal infant and maternal health.4 In
the United Kingdom, schemes such as the NHS ‘‘Start for Life’’
encourage new mothers to breastfeed, emphasizing the impor-
tance of breastfeedingfor both mother and baby. Alongside this,
theBabyFriendly Initiativestrives toencourage new mothers to
breastfeed through the provision of education antenatally,
promotinghospital practices thatencouragemothersandinfants
to stay close together and removing any unnecessary use or
promotion of baby milk substitutes. A large part of this is
training staff to provide informed, accurate, and consistent ad-
vice and support both antenatally and in the postnatal period.5
Knowledge that breastfeeding is the optimal nutrition for
an infant is well understood, even among women who choose
to formula feed from birth.6 Intention to breastfeed is strong
and many women want to receive information regarding
breastfeeding.7 However, despite this, levels of breastfeeding
are low in the United Kingdom. Although rates are slowly
increasing, with 81% of mothers now initiating breastfeeding
at birth,8 only 34% of mothers are breastfeeding at all at 6
months with less than 2% doing so exclusively for this pe-
riod.9 This is not simply intention to stop; up to 80% of
mothers who stop breastfeeding before 6 weeks report that
they do so before they are ready.9
We know that reasons behind formula use are complex, in-
volving many biological, psychological, and social factors.10–12
However, given our understanding of breastfeeding issues and
the government’s strategic priority to promote breastfeeding,
yet consistently low rates of breastfeeding continuation,

 potentially a different, more intensive, or more effective way of
tackling low breastfeeding rates is needed.13,14
One critical element is providing new mothers with high
quality accessible support after they have given birth. How-
ever, engagement during pregnancy is also important. Mo-
thers who feel prepared, knowledgeable, and confident about
breastfeeding typically have better outcomes after birth,15–17
and enabling women to breastfeed by providing high quality,
widespread practical and informed education and support is
central to improving breastfeeding rates.18 However, spe-
cifically how this information and support is publicized may
need a different direction.
Two main challenges for breastfeeding education and pro-
motion arise. First, if the majority of women understand the
benefits of breastfeeding and want to breastfeed, what should
breastfeeding promotion and education cover? Second, how
can breastfeeding promotion and education help to break down
wider barriers to enable women to breastfeed? Importantly, any
messages promoted must be relevant to mothers today and
placed within an appropriate wider social and cultural con-
text.19 The aim of the current study was to examine directly
what information new mothers feel they need in relation to
breastfeeding promotion and education, what strategies they
believe worked, and what practices they felt were restrictive.
Materials and Method
Design
A retrospective mixed methods study, exploring moth-
ers’ perceptions of breastfeeding education and promotion
messages.
Participants
Ethical approval was granted by a Department of Psy-
chology Research Ethics Committee. All aspects of this study
were performed in accordance with the ethical standards set
out in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. Participants included
mothers with a baby aged up to 2 years who had planned
during pregnancy to breastfeed. A 2-year limit was chosen in
line with World Health Organization recommendations to
breastfeed for the first 2 years postpartum and beyond.20 The
decision was made to exclude mothers who intended to for-
mula feed as they would likely have consistently different
views toward the need for breastfeeding support.
Participants were recruited from local mother and baby
groups and through online parenting forums based in the
United Kingdom. Paper copies of the questionnaire were
distributed through local groups. For online participants,
advertisements were placed on parenting forums and par-
ticipants used an online link to complete the questionnaire
using SurveyMonkey. Participants from the face-to-face
groups were also given an online link to complete the ques-
tionnaire if required, and likewise, online participants could
request a paper copy. Both the paper and online version of the
questionnaire contained an information and consent section
and debrief information. Details of how to contact the re-
searcher for further information were included. All partici-
pants were required to give first three letters of UK postcode to
confirm they were UK based.
Measures
Participants completed a questionnaire consisting of open-
ended questions examining their beliefs regarding breastfeed-
ing education and promotion in the United Kingdom (Table 1).
Questions examined experiences of breastfeeding education
and promotion in conjunction with exploring how participants
believed breastfeeding should be promoted. Participants were
prompted to give examples of both what worked and what
did not. Alongside this, participants responded to a series of
statements examining breastfeeding promotion using a five-
point likert scale [strongly agree to strongly disagree].
Participants provided age, education, and marital status
alongside details regarding occupation, which were coded
according to the National Statistics Socio-Economic Classi-
fication self-coded method.21 Participants also indicated
whether they had planned to breastfeed, how they fed at birth,
and breastfeeding duration if they had stopped breastfeeding.
Data analysis
Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.
The proportion of respondents agreeing with each statement
was calculated by combining those who agreed or strongly
agreed with each statement.
Qualitative data were analyzed using a simple qualitative
descriptive approach.22 A content analysis was performed for
each script. This entailed reading through each script to identify
emerging themes. Themes were grouped into key themes and
subcategories. The aim was to explore scripts following prin-
ciples of data saturation with analysis continuing until it was felt

 that no new themes or ideas were emerging. A random sample
of scripts was selected for confirmation of themes by two in-
dependent coders. Agreement was found in over 90% of cases.
Given the significant sample size, a decision was made to
analyze all quantitative responses, but to select 200 responses
for qualitative analysis. This sample was stratified to reflect
numbers who breast or formula fed at birth, for those still
breastfeeding or not, and ensuring this sample reflected the
original spread of maternal age, education, and parity. Par-
ticipants were randomly selected from those groups. This
number clearly exceeded recommended minimums for
qualitative data,23,24 and saturation of main themes was found
within expected numbers.25 However, it also allowed for
a quantitative description of occurrence of themes. The
proportion of participants who agreed with each key and
subtheme was recorded in a table to allow an additional de-
scriptive quantitative analysis of data
Results
Quantitative results (entire sample)
For the full sample, 1130 mothers with a baby aged 0–2
years had full quantitative data. Maternal mean age was 30.62
(SD: 4.32), with mean years in education of 13.23 (SD: 3.34).
For full demographic details see Table 2. Mean age of infant
was 39 weeks (SD: 38.2). Thousand and four (88.8%) breastfed
at birth, while 126 (11.2%) formula fed at birth, despite in-
tention to breastfeed. Mothers (45.2%) were breastfeeding at
the time of the questionnaire (31.04% exclusively, 14.2%
partially). Those (92.4%) who stopped within the first 6 weeks
stated that they would have liked to breastfeed for longer.
Examining quantitative responses, 89.1% believed that it
was important to promote breastfeeding to pregnant mothers
and 75.8% felt that breastfeeding promotion affected moth-
er’s decision to breastfeed. However, only 14.6% of mothers
agreed that methods of breastfeeding promotion and education
are currently excellent, and 17.9% of mothers were happy with
the information they received from health professionals during
pregnancy. Overall, only 8.2% believed that the ‘‘breast is
best’’ slogan was a good way to increase breastfeeding rates.
Specifically, although 94.8% of participants felt that breast-
feeding promotion tackled the health benefits of breastfeeding,
only 48.4% felt that they had been given sufficient information
on how to find support after the birth, with 10.4% believing
that breastfeeding promotion messages prepared mothers for
what it would be like to breastfeed a baby.
Qualitative results (stratified sample)
The qualitative responses of 200 mothers were therefore
included in the qualitative analysis. The sample was stratified
closely for percentage breastfed at birth [n = 178 (89%)—
compared to 88.8% in the full sample) and still breastfeeding
at time of questionnaire [n = 90 (45%—compared to 45.2% in
the full sample). This stratified sample was then matched as
closely as possible for maternal age, education, and parity,
although naturally this was not an exact match but of close
similarity [see Table 2]. The mean age in the stratified sample
was 30.66% (SD: 4.29), with a mean number of years in
education of 13.28 (SD: 3.31).
In a series of open-ended responses, mothers critiqued their
experiences of breastfeeding promotion and education, giving
suggestions for what information and guidance they would have
liked to have received or felt would work better. Frequency of
main and subthemes can be found in Table 3. Overall, as shown
in the quantitative data, mothers were strongly in favor of
breastfeeding being promoted and pregnant women receiving
breastfeeding education during pregnancy.
‘‘We definitely need to be telling new mothers about why
breastfeeding is so good. It is important that they learn about
the differences between breast and formula and make an
informed choice. I think this should play a larger role in
antenatal education but also be extended to everyone else.
Everyone needs to know why breastfeeding is so important
for mums to stand a chance of making this work’’
However, mothers went on critique the specific informa-
tion they had received, examining both positive and negative
examples they had encountered.
Breast is not best; it is the normal way to feed an in-
fant.
The strongest idea reflected throughout the data focused
upon the semantics of how breastfeeding promotion and edu-
cation should be delivered. Breastfeeding should not be por-
trayed as ‘‘best,’’ but as normal. Breastfeeding, as thebiological
norm, should be perceived as theautomatic behavior rather than
an active choice being made. Participants believed that by la-
beling breastfeeding as ‘‘best’’, the subcontext was that formula
feeding was perfectly good enough. It also portrayed breast-
feeding as something complicated that had to be worked to-
ward, with the expectation that not many would manage this.
‘‘Breast is best but this puts breastfeeding on an unob-
tainable pedestal for some people. This then makes infant
formula seem to be reachable, normal and something that has
all the stuff needed for babies. Instead breastfeeding should
be marketed as normal and perfect.’’
‘‘Breast milk does not reduce the chances of a child being
obese etc, formula increases the chance of them being obese.
We may be sparing some feelings by flipping reality on its
head but in the long run we are only hurting ourselves.’’

 Do not focus solely on the health impact of breastfeed-
ing.
Many mothers reported how they had received plentiful
information on the health impact of breastfeeding, but less
emphasis was placed on other reasons that might encourage
mothers to breastfeed. Mothers highlighted how they felt
stronger precedence should be placed on more immediate
tangible hooks for the mother; factors such as convenience,
lower cost, ease, and closeness, alongside factors such as
emotional closeness and instinct.
‘‘Breastfeeding is about so much more than health. It is
about cuddles, and closeness and bonding. It saves time, costs
nothing and you can never forget to take it out with you. Why
don’t we emphasise these things more?’’
Moreover, mothers raised the idea that by focusing on
simply the health benefits of breastfeeding, there was the risk
that breast milk appeared to conceptualize almost as a prod-
uct that the baby must have for its health, rather than simply
being the normal way to feed a baby.
‘‘Breastmilk is not a medication, supplement or product
and sometimes it is promoted as this thing your baby must
have. It’s not about that. It’s so much more.’’
Related to this was the misinterpretation that selling breast-
feeding as simply promoting health was often misinterpreted
as an assurance that a breastfed infant would never become
ill. Mothers recalled how they were often surprised or dis-
appointed when their breastfed infant did get ill.
‘‘Although there are health differences between breast and
formula fed babies they are not guarantees. Breastfed babies
can still get ill so if mothers are sold the idea of breastfeeding
on health benefits alone and then their baby gets sick it can
make them feel like they did it wrong or that it wasn’t actually
that good and they might as well formula feed as their friend
who did have really healthy kids’’.
Mothers noted that with the current emphasis on the health
benefits of breastfeeding, combined with the concept of
breast being ‘‘best,’’ mothers felt they attracted quick criti-
cism from those who did formula feed when their breastfed
infant did fall ill. Their infant’s illness was taken as ‘‘proof’’
that the messages about breastfeeding were wrong.
‘‘There is a lot of defensiveness amongst some mothers
who do not breastfeed at the idea of breastfed babies being
healthier. I had a number of people pointedly notice that my
breastfed baby had a cold/bit of dry skin/sticky eye saying
that they thought breastfeeding was meant to stop all that and
their formula fed baby didn’t have it’’.
Take it a day at a time—every feed counts.
The World
Health Organization20 recommends exclusive breastfeeding
for the first 6 months, alongside continued breastfeeding up to
the second year and beyond. However, a strong belief was
that the way in which this information had been interpreted
and disseminated often discouraged women from breast-
feeding at all as they felt that if they did not follow these
‘‘rules’’ there was little point in continuing. Although mothers
understood concepts of milk supply and the potential damage
of supplementation, many felt overwhelmed by the thought
of 6 months of exclusive feeding, or felt that any perceived
benefit would only come from exclusive feeding.
‘‘If you really want to boost breastfeeding, you have to
abandon this black or white stance . It’s a spectrum, with
exclusive breast at one end, and exclusive formula at the
other. But it’s promoted as a black or white choice and most

BREASTFEEDING PROMOTION

 mums end up failing to keep all the rules and giving up the
whole thing’’
‘‘It is overwhelming as a first time mum who is perhaps
exhausted by the birth that she must now feed this baby ex-
clusively for the next six months. You might have a mum who
baulks at the idea of six months, but six weeks or even 6 days
seems achievable for her. That is better than not at all.’’
This included recognizing that even when new mothers
understood the guidance and wanted to follow it, breast-
feeding had to fit within their wider experience. However,
many felt that unless they breastfed exclusively they were
judged for their choices.
‘‘Please recognise that us mums are only human. We
would love to focus only on our babies we really would. But
sometimes our other children need attention, we need to go
back to work or sometimes we have the audacity of putting
our mental health first. Sometimes that means giving an oc-
casional bottle of formula or stopping at four months old.
Stop making us feel like we have failed when we have actually
done a damn good job!’’
If discussions could be more open with women, giving
them the information and tools they need to make an in-
formed choice, perhaps women may breastfeed for longer, or
even initiate when they otherwise would not, just for a few
days. Importantly, recognition of what they have done, rather
than what they have not, may help reduce feelings of guilt at
stopping breastfeeding.
Tell us the truth—it can be challenging.
A theme running
throughout the responses was that women often felt ill pre-
pared for what breastfeeding would truly be like. Antenatal
preparation stressed only positive aspects of breastfeeding,
presenting feeding as a simple and straightforward expe-
rience. However, many mothers felt that they encountered
challenges, difficulties, or simply found that breastfeeding
was not as they expected. Few mothers felt that they were
prepared for the realities of breastfeeding and held high ex-
pectations of how simple it would be. When these were
shattered, they became disillusioned or felt that they needed
to stop breastfeeding as they must be doing something wrong,
or that their baby was ‘‘difficult.’’ Conversely, although they
did not believe that breastfeeding should be labeled difficult,
they felt that if they had been prepared for the realities of
breastfeeding (the rewarding, the mundane, and the chal-
lenging), they felt they may have continued for longer.
‘‘It was all so positive. Breast is best for your baby.
Breastfeeding will help you lose weight. Breastfeeding will
make bonding with your baby easier. Breastfeeding is a
wonderful experience. Perhaps all that is true but it is in no
way the whole picture. When I then found it difficult, at times
demanding and my baby appeared to want to scream rather
than snuggle serenely at my breast I felt like a complete
failure and embarrassed and guilty that I felt that way to boot.
If I’d known the truth I could have worked through all of this
rather than thinking it wrong’’
‘‘Honest real information about how hard it can be to latch
on, things you can do to help latch, most common issues and
solutions to those. How it can hurt, its normal to struggle at the
start, information about growth spurts, more information on
how milk production actually works so mums can then make
informed decisions on feeding and know if they do something
like top up with formula then how it will impact their supply’’
Considering what information new mothers needed, fre-
quently, non-NHS sources were brought up, including online
breastfeeding resources, blogs, and breastfeeding books.
These books and websites in particular were seen as excellent
examples as they provided detailed information, not simply
about health benefits and latch but they had detailed infor-
mation and suggestions of how to solve problems that might
arise. These sources of information have been built up over
time, are accurate, and widely seen to be excellent sources of
information. One suggestion could be that the NHS openly
directs women to these sites, both as a source of information
and support, compiling a list of resources for them, rather
than trying to recreate information on a smaller level.
‘‘Dispelling BF Myths and Analytical Armadillo (and I am
sure other blogs) are excellent, and I find them to be much
more informative and supportive than some of the leaflets
available.’’
Importantly, mothers wanted information not only re-
garding the difficulties they might experience but how they
could overcome these. Positive stories were recalled as to
hearing realistic tales of breastfeeding from experienced
friends or breastfeeding peer supporters during pregnancy,
which helped them form realistic ideas about what breast-
feeding would be like. This information was also invaluable
to learning how although these difficulties might arise, they
could be overcome.
‘‘I went to this great class. We covered why breastfeeding is
so important and how to do it but also what it was really like to
breastfeed. Some local peer supporters came in and fed in front
of us (which was the first time I had seen a baby breastfeed)
and talked about problems they had and importantly how they
got over them. They then gave us details of how to contact them
and groups to go to once the baby was here. We felt part of
something and like we knew what to expect.’’
Target a wider audience.
Finally, mothers expressed a
clear view that breastfeeding promotion had to encompass a
much wider audience. Encouraging the support of breast-
feeding from partners, family, and wider society was seen as
a key step to ensuring that mothers received the encourage-
ment and support needed to successfully establish breast-
feeding. Mothers felt that if those around them were informed
and knowledgeable about breastfeeding and recognized their
role in supporting the mother, their job of breastfeeding
would become easier.
‘‘You can tell women that breast is best til the cows come
home. But if their partner believes differently and the mother in
law is trying to give the baby a bottle, who do you think is going
to win? Tell mums by all means but also tell their wider family–
get the message out there in a way everyone will buy into it’’
Moreover, it was felt important to target society as a
whole, so that new mothers would feel confident in their
decision to breastfeed. If others understood the importance
of breastfeeding, then new mothers would find it less chal-
lenging to feed.
‘‘I know why breastfeeding is important. My partner knows
why breastfeeding is important. But it’s very difficult to put up
with others’ ignorant views. Educate the general public and it
would be a lot easier. Even if this just means more awareness
that you’re not allowed to tell a woman to stop!’’
Mothers also felt that if talking about, and seeing, breast-
feeding became commonplace, then breastfeeding would
106
BROWN
 become normalized in society. If society was encouraged
to accept breastfeeding, then breastfeeding would become
more commonplace, visible, and expected. Mothers felt that
breastfeeding images needed to infiltrate every public space
so that breastfeeding no longer became something that was
viewed as different. Ideas for targeting wider groups and in-
creasing acceptance billboard campaigns, having breastfeed-
ing interwoven into television programmes, and just more
promotional posters and breastfeeding welcome stickers.
‘‘The only thing you can do is make it more normal and
accepted. If everyone grows up seeing pictures of it, seeing
women doing it, seeing it on soaps etc and seeing people
doing it, it will be a normal natural thing to do.’’
Specifically, educating children and young people so that
subsequent generations were informed and supportive as to
the need of breastfeeding arose numerous times.
‘‘Go into schools. Talk to the children before someone else
gives them the idea that breastfeeding is something to be
ashamed about and formula milk is normal.’’
Related to this, a common idea was that more should be
done to actively promote breastfeeding to the general public
through advertising campaigns in the same way that the
formula companies do.
‘‘Australia does some good adverts on TV which are very
widely seen and help to counter formula promotion. PLEASE
stop the TV ads for formula as they’re so misleading and
PLEASE promote breastfeeding on TV.’’
‘‘Formula companies advertise by showing bouncy, happy
babies rather than just them sucking on a bottle. Maybe we
need to see how we can promote breastfeeding in other ways
than the more traditional.’’
Utilizing celebrities as a means of promoting and ‘‘getting
behind’’ breastfeeding was a suggestion that frequently ar-
ose. Mothers felt that when a celebrity endorsed or even
simply mentioned that they were breastfeeding, it created an
aspiration for others who supported that celebrity. It also
meant that breastfeeding became talked about in newspapers,
magazines, and on television and social media.
‘‘Angelina Jolie BF twins for 3 months, Danni Minogue BF
before shows on X Factor. Use strong role models like this to
show those who won’t try that it is not that difficult.’’
Mothers recognized that although new mothers are pri-
marily responsible for breastfeeding, without a network
which encourages, supports, and recognizes the importance
of breastfeeding, their journey was going to be much more
difficult. An approach that considers and targets the wider
influences on the mother is needed. One mother summed
this up:
‘‘You have the ideal behaviour, the gold standard that we
should be aiming for. But we have to realise that not everyone
can do that. Yes we want it (they want it) but we want them to
do lots of other things like not smoke or drink too much.
Realise that just feeding for a few days is an achievement for
some, or some will want to give formula too. Understand
some mothers need to go back to work. Support, understand,
enable. Nagging never works. Make breastfeeding seem non
threatening, non embarrassing and normal and by taking a
step back we might actually just get where we want to be.’’
Considering the findings as a whole, participants provided
a wealth of information and ideas about their thoughts and
experiences regarding breastfeeding education and promo-
tion. Mothers highlighted how they believed that breast-
feeding should be promoted as the normal biological way to
feed an infant, highlighting factors outside of health and
considering realistic experiences of breastfeeding. Promotion
of the importance of breastfeeding needed to go outside of the
mother, targeting those who support her and the wider views
of society if breastfeeding was going to become the normal
and expected behavior.
Discussion
This article presents the experiences, attitudes, and per-
ceptions of a large sample of new mothers toward breast-
feeding promotion and education in the United Kingdom. It
highlights beliefs about what they feel works (and does not
work) in relation to supporting and educating new mothers to
breastfeed with suggestions to the information, guidance, and
assistance mothers would like to receive. Overall, mothers felt
that a new wider approach was needed as they perceived that
people had become immune to current messages. In essence,
mothers aspired for breastfeeding to become the cultural and
social norm in the United Kingdom with the right support
networks to inspire, guide, and enable women to breastfeed.
Considering the themes that emerged, there was a strong
awareness that breastfeeding promotion had to operate within
the social and cultural environment of new mothers, as high-
lighted by Dykes & Flacking.19 The first of these messages
considered that breastfeeding should not be portrayed as
‘‘best,’’ but as normal. Breastfeeding, as the biological norm,
should be perceived as the automatic behavior rather than
an active choice being made. Typically, in other areas of
health promotion, comparisons are made toward the biolog-
ical norm. Messages surrounding smoking cessation are not
phrased toward the benefits of not smoking, instead they
highlight the risks to health of deviating from the biological
norm. In breastfeeding promotion, however, breastfeeding is
often considered to decrease risk of illness (rather than arti-
ficial feeding increasing risk), creating ideas of perfection
rather than need.26 Indeed even the World Health Organi-
zation has a statement that ‘‘Exclusive breastfeeding for 6
months is best for babies everywhere’’27 and the NHS a
breastfeeding campaign entitled ‘‘Off to the best start.’’28
This may dilute health messages.
This wording may appear insignificant, but affects the way
in which breast and formula milk are framed. For example,
Hannan, Benton-Davies, & Grummer-Strawn found that while
agreement was high with the statement that ‘‘breastfeeding is
healthier for babies,’’ the majority disagreed with the state-
ment that ‘‘Feeding a baby formula instead of breast milk
increases the chances the baby will get sick.’’29 Rephrasing
messages to highlight breastfeeding as the biological norm
would both emphasize the potentially impact of formula
feeding and also help reinstate breastfeeding as the normal
option.
Second, mothers suggested that promotion should not fo-
cus solely on the health impact of breastfeeding. This senti-
ment echoes work by Burns et al. (2012) who described how
breast milk is sometimes lifted to such a pedestal that em-
phasis becomes focused on the baby receiving the milk for its
health, rather than the wider experience of breastfeed-
ing, including that of the role of the mother in this ‘‘transfer.’’30
Breastfeeding is not just about health; mothers breastfeed
for a wide range of reasons, including emotional well-being,
BREASTFEEDING PROMOTION

 convenience, or just because it is natural, instinctive, or they
want to, but this is rarely considered when discussing breast-
feeding with new mothers, instead focusing on urging them
to transfer the health benefits to their infant. Repositioning
the arguments for breastfeeding away from purely health
reasons was also suggested as one way of absolving some
of the tensions between breast and formula feeding mothers
and reducing reported feelings of guilt among mothers who
cannot breastfeed, as it moves away from just being this re-
quired health intervention for their infant that they are ‘‘fail-
ing’’ to provide.31
A related idea was that the focus should be shifted away
from an almost all or nothing approach to breastfeeding and
recognize that every feed makes a difference. Although for-
mula milk supplementation can reduce milk supply,32 ex-
clusive formula feeding carries greater risk than partial
breastfeeding, meaning that every feed does matter.33 Wo-
men should know the potential risk of supplementation, but
also that there was still reason to breastfeed even if the infant
was mixed fed or that breastfeeding for even 1 day was better
than not at all. Moreover, this approach might help to reduce
some of the guilt that mothers feel at not meeting breast-
feeding goals.31 Infant feeding decisions are complex and
affected by many wider uncontrollable circumstances and
barriers.34 Mothers may have competing circumstances that
reduce the likelihood of exclusive breastfeeding, but partial
breastfeeding may be a good solution for them. This needs to
be recognized, and presenting breastfeeding as ‘‘1 day at a
time’’ could help overcome this. If discussions could be more
open with women, giving them the information and tools they
need to make an informed choice, perhaps women may
breastfeed for longer, or even initiate when they otherwise
would not, just for a few days. Importantly, recognition of
what they have done, rather than what they have not, may
help reduce feelings of guilt at stopping breastfeeding.
A further theme was the belief that more information was
needed on what breastfeeding was really like. Many mothers
can encounter challenges such as pain, difficulties getting the
infant latched on, or simply feeling overwhelmed by the re-
sponsibility of breastfeeding, compounded by little knowledge
of how breastfeeding works.10–12 The concept of antenatal
education glossing over the challenging side of breastfeeding
out of fear that it might dissuade women from breastfeeding is
evident in the literature.35,36 However, the early days post-
partum can often feel exhausting and unrelenting as the new
mother learns how to care for a dependent infant.37 Calls have
been made for women to be more accurately prepared prena-
tally for the experience of postnatal fatigue and responsi-
bility38 and the realities of breastfeeding as a skill that for
many develops over time.39 This is not to say that breastfeed-
ing should be portrayed as an insurmountable obstacle, but at
present mothers can be presented with idealistic images that
are hard to meet in reality (as would idealistic portrayal of most
behaviors). Maternal self-efficacy and confidence to breast-
feed have been shown to predict breastfeeding duration.40
Giving mothers a clear insight into what issues they might
face, but in addition equipping them antenatally to overcome
these may increase maternal confidence that she will be able to
breastfeed. Indeed, in other areas of maternal and infant health,
such as childbirth, this approach is typically taken; women
prepare for and develop strategies for the challenge of giv-
ing birth. Why is the same not done in a balanced way for
breastfeeding? Suggesting that mothers would not choose to
breastfeed if they deemed it to present even the slightest
challenge seems condescending and certainly creates issues
when challenges are inevitably encountered.
Finally, mothers called for breastfeeding promotion to tar-
get a wider audience, as they felt that their ability or enjoyment
of breastfeeding was affected by the attitudes and knowledge
of those around them. Indeed, the attitudes of those close to the
mother, including the woman’s partner, wider family, and
peers, are shown to directly and indirectly affect a woman’s
decision to initiate and continue breastfeeding.41 Mothers are
more likely to breastfeed for longer when their partner is
positive42 and knowledgeable43 about breastfeeding. Fathers
also express desire to receive more information about breast-
feeding to be able to support their partner.44
It was felt important that messages should target society as
a whole, so that new mothers would feel confident in their
decision to breastfeed. Although the law now protects women
when breastfeeding their infants in public, attitudes toward
the subject can be derogatory. Many surveys show that de-
spite the general public typically agreeing with the breast
is best message, many take umbrage with seeing a woman
breastfeeding her baby.45 Mothers recognized that although
new mothers are primarily responsible for breastfeeding,
without a network that encourages, supports, and recognizes
the importance of breastfeeding, their journey was going to
be much more difficult. Our behavior, no matter how delib-
erate, is determined by social, economic, and environmental
influences,46 and infant feeding is no different. Breastfeeding
promotion has previously been criticized as placing the mo-
ther solely in control and responsible for behavior and out-
comes of infant feeding, when in fact she is influenced both
consciously and subconsciously by wider social, cultural, and
political contexts.47,48
On the surface, it appears that the findings of this research
suggest innovative and novel ways of changing the way
breastfeeding promoted in the United Kingdom is needed.
However, on closer inspection of policy guidelines for
breastfeeding education and support, the ideas that emerged
should already be in practice. The Department of Health Start
4 Life scheme already promotes many of the ideas that were
discussed, such as every feed making a difference and giving
details of where to find a range of support and advice.49
Similarly, the UNICEF Baby Friendly states that all pregnant
women should be informed about the health benefits and
management of breastfeeding, given support postnatally to
establish breastfeeding and provided with specific details of
where to get support if problems occur. It appears that the
policy, evidence, and guidance are already in place for new
mothers to be supported, but that these messages may not be
getting through to new mothers, or may be drowned out by
other influences such as negative attitudes from family,
friends, and the public.
Although policy may be in place to support breastfeeding
mothers, in reality evidence shows that although most health
professionals are willing and skilled in providing such sup-
port, many have so many competing demands that they do not
have the time to offer support.50,51 Others may have their own
negative experiences of breastfeeding that may affect their
ability or belief in delivering positive breastfeeding sup-
port.52 The natural solution, as arose in the data, is for ex-
tensive training to be offered to those working to support new
108
BROWN
 mothers and for wider, more accessible support services to be
put in place. Interventions should go outside of simply ma-
ternal natal care, targeting fathers, family members, and so-
ciety itself. The government must spread messages about the
importance and normality of breastfeeding more widely, to
reinforce laws protecting women to breastfeed and to remove
formula advertising completely from media sources. Im-
plementing these strategies would mean that breastfeeding
becomes the normal and expected way to feed an infant and
that future generations of women would feel more informed,
confident, and supported in doing so.
However, in the United Kingdom, the current government
has withdrawn funding of the annual Breastfeeding Aware-
ness week, the Infant Feeding Survey, and reduced numbers
of specialist infant feeding coordinators in the United King-
dom53 with pressure continuing to grow on the midwifery
work force to pick up the shortfall.54 Given the significant
costs of treating illnesses in formula fed infants,55 it seems
counterproductive for the government to do anything but
direct more funding toward breastfeeding services. Re-
cognition needs to be given to this.
Limitations of the work include the selective sample used.
Recruitment methods mean that mothers who held strong
opinions about their experiences or attitudes toward breast-
feeding education and support in the United Kingdom may
have been more likely to respond. However, responses were
received from mothers who did not follow through their in-
tention to breastfeed and who breastfed for varying durations.
Internet recruitment may have enhanced this, with the po-
tential to be biased toward a more affluent demographic.
Internet-based recruitment is growing in popularity in health
research,56,57 particularly for studies in maternal and infant
health.58,59 Care should be taken in considering whether the
findings are generalizable to a wider population.
Limitations aside, this article offers insight into the live
experiences of mothers affected by breastfeeding policy and
practice in the United Kingdom today and is of relevance
to anyone working to support new mothers or to develop
breastfeeding promotion, education, or policy. The key lesson
that emerges is that breastfeeding needs to be repositioned
as the normal way to feed a baby, with this message going
to those supporting the mother and wider society. However,
these messages need to be realistic about what breastfeeding
is like and an understanding that every breastfeed matters
needs to be portrayed. Mothers need accurate information
and skilled, sensitive, and appropriate support, taking into
account their wider social and cultural situation and needs.
