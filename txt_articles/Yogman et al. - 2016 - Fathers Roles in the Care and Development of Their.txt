abstract
Fathers’ involvement in and infl
 uence on the health and development of their 
children have increased in a myriad of ways in the past 10 years and have 
been widely studied. The role of pediatricians in working with fathers has 
correspondingly increased in importance. This report reviews new studies 
of the epidemiology of father involvement, including nonresidential as well 
as residential fathers. The effects of father involvement on child outcomes 
are discussed within each phase of a child’s development. Particular 
emphasis is placed on (1) fathers’ involvement across childhood ages and 
(2) the infl
 uence of fathers’ physical and mental health on their children. 
Implications and advice for all child health providers to encourage and 
support father involvement are outlined.
CLINICAL REPORT
Guidance for the Clinician in Rendering Pediatric Care
INTRODUCTION
In the decade that followed since the original clinical report on the 
father’s role was published by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 
May 2004, 
1 there has been a surge of attention and research on fathers 
and their role in the care and development of their children. Three areas 
(academic study, policy initiatives, and socioeconomic forces) have fueled 
this increase. First, high-quality studies, both qualitative and quantitative, 
have improved the conceptualization and understanding of the myriad 
of ways fathers are involved in and influence the health of their children, 
regardless of marital status. Of key import are several national, father-
inclusive longitudinal studies in families, such as the Fragile Families and 
Child Wellbeing Study, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study of Birth 
and Kindergarten, and Early Head Start, which for the first time allow 
for the reporting of nationally representative findings relating father 
involvement and child and family well-being over time.
In the public policy arena, shifts have occurred away from “deadbeat 
dads” and what men are not doing for their families to a focus on more 
supportive perspectives on positive involvement2 and the unique ways

fathers contribute to families and 
children. Another major policy 
development in the past decade is the 
adoption by several states (California, 
New Jersey, and Rhode Island) of 
paid family leave laws that were 
conceived as support for fathers’ 
bonding and attachment with their 
newborn infants or young children.3 
In 2015, a Massachusetts law took 
effect that entitles male employees 
to take 8 weeks of unpaid leave for 
the birth or adoption of a child if they 
work for a company with at least 6 
employees.4 Despite this opportunity, 
men still face negative career effects 
if they take family leave time.5
Two major socioeconomic forces, 
the growth in women’s educational 
achievement and the Great Recession 
of 2008, with its particularly severe 
impact on paternal employment, 
have led to more fathers having the 
opportunities to contribute at home 
or to become stay-at-home dads in 
families in which mothers are able 
to sustain family income. These 
influences, paired with the dramatic 
cross-cultural growth in academia, 
lay print, social media, television, 
and electronic publications focusing 
on fathers, have stimulated public 
discussion around fathers and their 
roles in families (eg, http://

The literature from the past decade 
and the increasing number of peer-
reviewed studies published in major 
pediatric and medical journals 
focusing specifically on fathers8, 
10–16 
have painted a more nuanced picture 
of today’s fathers’ roles, married 
or not. Drawing on important 
contributions from such disciplines 
as infant mental health, sociology, 
and psychology, this literature 
offers a critical assessment of the 
central and unique role of fathers 
in the health of their children, their 
influence on maternal well-being, 
and their interactions with the health 
care system. These studies reported 
that fathers are present at the birth 
of their children, frequently attend 
well-child or acute care visits across 
childhood, and have unique roles 
in child health that may differ from 
those of mothers. The involvement of 
fathers has important consequences 
for child well-being, especially with 
regard to issues of diet/nutrition, 
exercise, play, and parenting 
behaviors (eg, reading, discipline).17 
Barriers to health care involvement 
include systemic issues such as 
inconvenient office hours and lack 
of time off from work beyond the 
newborn period as well as individual 
issues, most notably employment, 
relationship quality with the mother 
and the potential of maternal 
“gatekeeping, 
” and lack of parenting 
confidence.14, 
17 Although many 
of these issues affect all parents, 
especially if they work swing shifts, 
they are more common barriers for 
fathers.
The field of pediatrics remains 
slow to incorporate these 
findings into practice and into the 
conceptualization of family-centered 
care. Although mothers continue 
to provide the majority of care for 
the well and sick child, fathers are 
more involved than ever before.18 
Yet, cultural and structural biases 
still play a role; pediatricians still 
see a majority of mothers at clinical 
encounters and therefore may not 
have changed their practices to be 
family-friendly in terms of available 
hours, comfort in interacting with 
men, and addressing fathers’ unique 
concerns regarding their children. 
With few supportive parental leave 
programs in existence (at best for 
only 1 parent), fathers typically have 
to pit their workplace responsibilities 
against their home responsibilities at 
a very early stage in their transition 
to fatherhood. Pediatricians are often 
the first members of the health care 
team to engage fathers in their new 
role during this transition; failure to 
make this connection may result in 
poorer downstream involvement and 
engagement. Given the changes in the 
stereotype of the father’s exclusive 
role as breadwinner, child health 
care providers have an opportunity 
to have an even greater influence 
on child and family outcomes by 
supporting fathers and enhancing 
their involvement.19
The purpose of this report, therefore, 
is to update data on fathers’ 
roles and to highlight the latest 
multidisciplinary findings related 
to fathers, children, and pediatrics. 
When possible, programs that are 
particularly innovative in supporting 
father involvement in children’s 
health are highlighted as examples 
of approaches to family-friendly 
pediatric care.
FATHERS BY THE NUMBERS
Defining who is a father must account 
for the diversity of fathering that 
occurs. Most children have a father, 
whether he is currently residing 
with them or living separately. 
Some children have a single father 
or 2 parents who are both fathers. 
Children in a blended family may 
have both a biological nonresident 
father and a stepfather. Some gay 
men and lesbians have created 
families in which children have 3 
or 4 adults in a parenting role, with 
1 or 2 of them being fathers. Some 
children do not have a male figure 
involved in raising them (eg, those 
whose parent is a single mother, by 
choice or circumstance, and those 
whose parents are a lesbian couple). 
As in the previous report, 
1 “father” 
is defined broadly as the male or 
males identified as most involved 
in caregiving and committed to the 
well-being of the child, regardless 
of living situation, marital status, 
or biological relation. A father 
may be a biological, foster, or 
adoptive father20; a stepfather; or a 
grandfather. He may or may not have 
legal custody and may be resident

or nonresident. Data for many of 
these subgroups are quite limited 
and must not be extrapolated to all 
subgroups. Although parenthood 
status is usually straightforward, 
circumstances in which parenthood 
status and parental rights are unclear 
may involve complex legal issues, 
including implications in terms 
of parental access to the child’s 
protected health information and 
ability to consent to care. Some 
states may legislate more restrictive 
definitions.
The number of fathers in the United 
States increased from 60.1 million 
in 2000, to 64.3 million in 2007, to 
70.1 million in 2012.18 The number 
of single fathers raising children was 
1.96 million in 2012, approximately 
10% of single parents, an increase 
of 60% in the past 10 years. Stay-at-
home fathers were counted by the 
Census for the first time in 2003 and 
totaled 98 000. By 2007, the number 
of stay-at-home fathers increased 
by more than 60% to 159 000, and 
in the 2012 Census the number was 
189 000. Fathers represent 3.4% of 
all stay-at-home parents, and 32% 
of these men are married to women 
working full-time. They care for more 
than 200 000 children full-time and 
almost 2 million preschoolers part-
time. Fathers whose partners work 
full-time and stay-at-home fathers 
are 2 groups likely to take their child 
to the doctor and to be primarily 
responsible for their child’s health 
care, recreation, and school-related 
activities. The census numbers 
may be underestimates, according 
to a recent Pew Center report that 
suggested that, in 2010, there were 
2.2 million stay-at-home dads. One-
quarter of these men were home 
because they were unemployed, 
21% chose to stay home to care for 
their child (increased from 5% in 
1989), and 35% were home because 
of illness or disability. Half of these 
fathers were poor, and they were 
more likely to be older. Low-income 
minority fathers had great difficulty 
finding available jobs. Although most 
stay-at-home parents are mothers, 
fathers’ share of stay-at-home 
parenting increased from 10% in 
1989 to 16% in 2012.21–23 Although 
1 in 6 fathers are nonresidential, 
only 1% to 2% of them do not 
participate at all with their children, 
24 
sometimes because they meet a new 
partner and father new children.
FATHERS’ TIME SPENT WITH CHILDREN
Researchers have long suggested 
that a “new fatherhood” is emerging, 
one that allows for balance between 
workplace and home responsibilities. 
Although no state offers a distinct 
paternity leave, several states have 
addressed 1 of the major barriers 
for fathers in taking leave to care for 
children and family by establishing 
paid family leave policies. In 1 study 
in fathers working for Fortune 500 
companies, 85% took some time off 
after the birth of the child, generally 
for 1 to 2 weeks (unpaid), and 
reported feeling more stressed about 
coordinating family-work conflicts 
than mothers did.25 Generally 
speaking, in families, work and time 
with children often compete with 
one another, with parents spending 
more time in the workplace than 
they are able to spend at home. With 
the use of time-use diaries such 
as the American Time Use Survey, 
the Pew Research on Social and 
Demographic Trends reported that 
although mothers continue to do 
the majority of work at home and 
with children, fathers have increased 
their time in both categories over the 
years. Comparing 1965 with 2011, 
fathers more than doubled their time 
spent on housework (4 vs 10 hours/
week) and child care (2.5 vs 7 hours/
week).26 Researchers point to this 
increase as evidence of a subgroup 
of “new fathers” who appear to 
preserve time with children, likely 
by cutting back on, or incorporating 
their children into, their leisure time, 
especially on weekends.27, 
28
FATHER INVOLVEMENT AND CHILD 
OUTCOMES ACROSS THE CHILDHOOD 
LIFE SPAN
Perinatal and Newborn Period
The father’s relationship with his 
child’s health care provider is likely 
to begin in the early childhood years 
and can grow over time to a long-
term relationship. Early encounters 
with pediatricians may occur as 
prenatal visits, visits in the newborn 
nursery, or any number of the 
well- or acute-care visits. Fathers 
have been shown to be involved 
prenatally by attending health care 
visits and assisting their pregnant 
partners; regardless of marital 
status, the vast majority of fathers 
are present at their child’s birth.29 
Fathers have even been noted to have 
Couvade syndrome, wherein they 
experience insomnia, restlessness, 
and excess weight gain during their 
partner’s pregnancy.30 Prenatal 
involvement and residence at birth 
were the strongest predictors of 
paternal involvement by the time 
a child reached 5 years.31 Father 
involvement during pregnancy 
correlated with mothers being 1.5 
times more likely to receive first-
trimester prenatal care29 and with 
reductions in prematurity and infant 
mortality.32, 
33 Among mothers who 
smoked, father involvement was 
associated with a smoking reduction 
of 36% compared with mothers 
whose partners were not involved.34 
Fathers’ mental health/psychological 
distress during pregnancy has been 
correlated with adverse childhood 
emotional problems at 36 months 
of age. In a study comparing father 
skin-to-skin care with conventional 
cot care during the first 2 hours 
after birth, newborn infants in the 
father skin-to-skin group cried less, 
became drowsy sooner, and had less 
rooting, sucking, and wakefulness.35 
Simple interventions such as bathing 
demonstrations in the newborn 
period have been shown to have 
long-lasting effects on enhancing 
paternal involvement, as have 
e3

paternal support groups in a variety 
of contexts.16 Fathers can play a 
critical role in supporting maternal 
breastfeeding and, conversely, if 
feeling excluded and competitive, can 
undermine it. Many birthing hospitals 
have instituted programming 
designed for and marketed directly to 
expectant fathers to offer resources 
for them as key partners.
During infancy, fathers have been 
shown to be competent and capable 
of similar successful interactions 
with young infants and to have 
similar psychological experiences 
as mothers.16 However, their 
relationship is not redundant; 
the father is more likely to be 
the infant’s play partner than the 
mother, and father’s play tends to 
be more stimulating, vigorous, and 
arousing for the infant.16, 
36 Fathers 
were equally successful in matching 
emotions with their children (during 
social interactions, fathers were 
able to synchronize arousal rhythms 
with their infants just as successfully 
as mothers), but the quality of 
interactions (especially play) was 
more intense with fathers.37, 
38 These 
high-intensity interactions with 
fathers may encourage childrens' 
exploration and independence, 
whereas the less-intensive 
interactions with mothers provide 
safety and balance.9, 
16 Interestingly, it 
has now been shown in human males 
that testosterone levels are higher 
during conception and decrease 
during child rearing.39, 
40 Correlations 
between fathers’ responses to their 
own versus other 2- to 4-month-olds 
have been shown between salivary 
testosterone levels and functional 
MRI responses in prefrontal and 
subcortical areas.41 Changes in 
paternal oxytocin levels have been 
correlated with exploratory play, 
and changes in prolactin levels 
have been correlated with affective 
synchrony during fathers’ interaction 
with their 2- to 6-month-olds.42, 
43 
Paternal plasma and salivary 
oxytocin levels were uniquely 
associated with stimulatory contact 
but not with affectionate touch as 
with mothers. Previous contact 
with infants had a greater impact on 
fathers compared with mothers.44 
Responses on functional MRI in 
mothers and fathers in response to 
seeing their own infants on video are 
also different: mothers show more 
activation in the amygdala but fathers 
show more activation in the superior 
temporal sulcus (temporoparietal 
and frontal regions), a key structure 
of the mentalizing network.45
Fathers’ involvement during 
the newborn period is strongly 
associated with marital status. 
Forty percent of births are to 
unmarried couples, which has been 
accompanied by an increase in the 
number of nonresident fathers.46 
Although many unmarried couples 
are cohabitating at the time of the 
child’s birth, recent studies showed 
that 63% of unmarried fathers are 
no longer living with the mother 
and their child after 5 years.47 
These nonresident fathers have less 
contact and involvement with their 
children than do resident fathers.48 
Several factors influence the level of 
involvement of nonresident fathers 
with their children, including age, 
level of education, employment 
status, geographical distance from 
their child, mental health status, and 
social support.48–50 The relationship 
with the mother, including the 
maintenance of a coparenting 
relationship, is also a major indicator of 
nonresident father involvement.47, 
51 
Although nonresident father 
involvement has traditionally been 
thought to decrease over time, recent 
work shows that involvement can 
follow several different trajectories, 
including remaining stable and, 
in some cases, even increasing.48 
Increasing ongoing nonresident 
father involvement in a child’s life can 
play an important role in child and 
adolescent well-being, even assuming 
traditional father responsibilities.52 
Recent commentaries have disputed 
the inaccurate stereotype that black 
fathers desert their offspring; in 
fact, most black fathers in the United 
States live with their child (2.3 
million live with their child and 1.7 
million do not). The fact that 72% of 
black children are parented by single 
women reflects several influences, 
including the following: (1) 600 000 
of the 1.5 million black men not living 
with their child are incarcerated, (2) 
many black couples live together but 
do not marry, and (3) some men have 
children with more than 1 woman.53
Given the increase in both nonmarital 
childbirths and nonresident 
father involvement, it is especially 
important to note that nontraditional 
forms of positive father involvement 
have been associated with children’s 
academic achievement, emotional 
well-being, and behavioral 
adjustment.54 Fostering father 
involvement in fragile single-parent 
families may reduce behavioral 
problems.55 However, having a 
father move out of the house by 3 
years of age was associated with 
infant temperament (ie, irregular 
schedule, difficult infant behavior), 
and it is not clear which is the 
precipitating factor.56 Nonmarital 
father involvement drops sharply 
after the parents’ relationship 
ends, especially when they enter 
subsequent relationships and have 
children with new partners.57 Policy 
makers advocating for programs to 
strengthen low-income families have 
specifically called for better research 
on programs to enhance paternal 
involvement.58
Early Childhood
Father involvement in the early 
childhood years is associated 
with positive child developmental 
and psychological outcomes over 
time, although most studies do not 
differentiate the benefits of having 
2 parents from a specifically male 
presence as the second parent. 
For example, at 3 years of age, 
father-child communication was a 
e4

significant and unique predictor of 
advanced language development 
in the child but mother-child 
communication was not.59 Despite 
this finding, infants from birth to 
7 months of age were exposed to 
significantly more language from 
mothers compared with fathers.60 
Mothers tailor word choice to the 
child’s known vocabulary, whereas 
fathers are more likely to introduce 
new words.9 Child health care 
providers have an opportunity to 
encourage fathers to speak to their 
infants more.
In a prospective study, when fathers 
were more involved (caring, playing, 
communicating) in infancy, children 
had decreased mental health 
symptomatology at 9 years of age.61 
Fathers engaged in more roughhouse 
play, and their involvement in 
play with preschoolers predicted 
decreased externalizing and 
internalizing behavior problems 
and enhanced social competence.62 
In a nationally representative 
household sample, positive father 
involvement was inversely associated 
with child behavior trajectories, 
such that more involvement 
was accompanied by less child 
maladaptive behavior; furthermore, 
the influence of maternal depressive 
symptoms on child problem 
behaviors varied by the level of the 
father’s positive involvement.63 
This information suggests that 
the influence of involved fathers 
may compensate for the negative 
influence of maternal depression (eg, 
reduced responsiveness to a child’s 
socioemotional needs), thereby 
reducing the risk of child problem 
behaviors and development.
Definitions of masculinity are in flux, 
from an emphasis on toughness to 
an emphasis on tenderness; racial/
ethnic differences still persist in this 
domain. In 1 study, white fathers 
were more demonstrative with 
children younger than 13 years than 
were black fathers, hugging their 
children more and telling them they 
loved them.64 Intervention programs 
with 8- to 12-year-old black boys 
that enhanced the parenting skills 
of nonresidential fathers were 
associated with reduced aggressive 
behavior of the boys.65
Adolescence
During adolescence, several recent 
national longitudinal studies have 
shown that father involvement 
is associated with a decrease in 
the likelihood of adolescent risk 
behaviors (even more strongly 
for boys)66, 
67 and predicts less 
adolescent depressive symptoms 
for both genders.68 A recent meta-
analysis of longitudinal studies 
of father involvement showed 
that father engagement was 
correlated with enhanced cognitive 
development, reduced behavioral 
problems in male adolescents, 
decreased psychological problems in 
female adolescents, and decreased 
delinquency and economic 
disadvantage in families of low 
socioeconomic status.8 Early father 
involvement with daughters has been 
associated with a decreased risk of 
early puberty, decreased early sexual 
experiences, and decreased teen 
pregnancy.9, 
69 Extrapolating from 
animal studies, exposure to fathers’ 
pheromones may slow female 
pubertal development.9 Adolescents 
whose nonresident fathers are 
involved have been shown to be less 
likely to begin smoking regularly.70 In 
general, increased father involvement 
has been associated with improved 
cognitive development, social 
responsiveness, independence, 
and gender role development, 
particularly in females.16 Fathers can 
now be seen to have a role expanded 
far beyond that of stereotypic 
disciplinarian, breadwinner, and 
masculine role model to that of 
care provider, companion, teacher, 
role model for parenting, and 
supportive spouse. The unique and 
complementary role of fathers is 
beginning to be understood. More 
research is needed on fathers’ role in 
promoting resiliency.
FATHER INVOLVEMENT WITH CHILDREN 
WITH SPECIAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS
Mothers are typically the primary 
caregivers when children have 
physical illness or developmental 
delay, and medical information 
passed on to the father may be 
interpreted or selected by the 
mother. Over time, the mother 
becomes the conduit to the health 
care provider and indirectly in charge 
of the child’s care. This indirect 
communication can be frustrating for 
the father and can affect the parental 
relationship. Fathers of children with 
special health care needs have been 
found to be highly involved in the 
care of their children. Fathers have 
been shown to increase involvement 
with children with chronic illnesses, 
often advocating for their children’s 
medical needs even if it means 
positioning themselves in the health 
care system as “unpopular” family 
members.71, 
72 Although mothers 
are generally more involved with 
their children’s direct care, a 
father’s participation in care has 
been linked to higher adherence to 
treatment, better child psychological 
adjustment, and improved health 
status compared with families with 
nonparticipating fathers.73 Fathers 
of children with cancer and of infants 
recovering from cardiac surgery 
have been found, not surprisingly, 
to experience intense emotional 
reactions to their child’s health and 
treatment.74, 
75 Intervention programs 
with parents of developmentally 
delayed children have far better child 
outcomes when fathers participate 
in the parent training along with 
mothers.76 Among preterm infants 
in the NICU (especially those with 
low-income black fathers), increased 
paternal involvement was associated 
with improved cognitive outcome at 
3 years of age, even after adjusting 
for family income, neonatal health, 
and paternal age.77, 
78 The population

of children with special health care 
needs has not been well studied and 
needs better research.
IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF OTHER 
GROUPS OF FATHERS
With the growing understanding of 
the role of fathers, there has been an 
appreciation of the context within 
which fathering occurs. Although 
there are many universalities 
for fathers in terms of how men 
see their roles in caring for their 
children, the diversity of cultural 
and social norms and expectations 
is wide. As physicians who care for 
children from many backgrounds, 
pediatricians need to be aware of the 
issues relevant to these particular 
groups.
An emerging sociodemographic 
trend currently under study is 
the increasingly common family 
phenomenon in which parents have 
biological children with multiple 
partners (multipartner fertility). 
Almost 1 in 5 fathers between the 
ages of 15 and 44 years have children 
with more than 1 partner.79 The 
prevalence of births with multiple 
partners varies significantly with 
demographics, with a higher rate of 
multipartner fertility among racial 
and ethnic minorities and those who 
are economically disadvantaged.79, 
80 
Age at first sexual experience, 
age at birth of the first child, and 
relationship status of partners are 
also indicators of multipartner 
fertility.80, 
81 Men whose first children 
are born outside of marriage are 
3 times as likely to experience 
multipartner fertility than are men 
who are married to the mother of 
their first child at the time of birth.79 
Children are affected by their fathers’ 
multipartner fertility, because it 
leads to complex family structures 
and diminished resources for each 
child.82, 
83 Children with nonresident 
fathers with multipartner fertility 
experience less overall parent-
child interaction than children 
with nonresident fathers without 
multipartner fertility.84 Nonresident 
fathers also provide less monetary 
support for their children when they 
have a child with a new partner.83 
A link exists between multipartner 
fertility and depression in fathers, 
although the causal direction of this 
association is unclear.85
A variety of other groups of fathers 
are benefiting from the growth in 
fathering research. For example, in 
military families, not only have more 
fathers been deployed overseas in the 
past 10 years86, 
87 but more mothers 
have also been deployed, leaving 
fathers to be the single parents 
of children while their mothers 
are away. Researchers who have 
described the sources of support 
for deployed fathers are currently 
testing a smartphone app designed 
to bolster support while a parent is 
serving overseas.88
Another population that is the subject 
of increased study is black fathers. 
Although black fathers have been 
noted to be less likely to marry and 
more likely to live apart from their 
children than white fathers (24% vs 
8%), 
24, 
89 black nonresidential fathers 
are more likely to provide daily 
child care support, such as bathing, 
dressing, and reading to their 
children, than white nonresidential 
fathers.24 Interventions with 
nonresident black fathers designed 
to prevent risky youth behaviors 
by preschool-aged children showed 
some success in paternal monitoring 
and intentions to avoid violence but 
no effect on reducing aggressive 
behavior.90 Black fathers involved 
in raising their preschool-aged 
children note unique concerns about 
keeping their children safe in violent 
neighborhoods and seek strategies 
for monitoring and educating 
children about safety and ways to 
improve community life.91 Pediatric 
health care providers should be 
aware that, although black fathers 
are indeed eager to learn about 
child rearing, researchers report 
they prefer to receive information 
from relatives or community-based 
organizations rather than from 
health care providers, 
92 so making 
connections within the community 
may be the best way to reach fathers 
and families. More data are now 
available on the diversity of Hispanic 
fathers and the importance of 
understanding cultural differences, 
but there are still large research 
gaps in our understanding of at-risk 
children of non–English-speaking 
fathers or displaced undocumented 
immigrant fathers and of cultural 
differences more broadly.93
According to 2010 census data, there 
are 352 000 gay male couples in the 
United States, and approximately 
10% of them are raising children.94 
This number does not include gay 
fathers who share custody with 
a child’s mother after a divorce 
or single fathers parenting alone, 
who are not counted in the census. 
Many gay fathers became fathers 
in the context of a heterosexual 
relationship, although increasingly, 
gay male couples are adopting 
children, partnering with lesbian 
mothers, or using surrogate carriers 
to father children.95, 
96 Children 
with gay parents are comparable to 
children with heterosexual parents 
on key psychosocial developmental 
outcomes.97–99 Large sample surveys 
from the 2003–2013 American Time 
Use Survey (N = 44 188) showed 
that women with same-sex partners 
as well as opposite-sex partners 
and men with same-sex partners 
spent more time with their children 
than did men with opposite-sex 
partners.100 Same-sex couples (both 
men and women) also reported 
more equal sharing of child care 
compared with heterosexual couples, 
who tend to specialize care (ie, 
mothers provide more child care 
than fathers).98 A study from the 
United Kingdom examining adopted 
children 3 to 9 years old in gay father, 
lesbian mother, and heterosexual 
parent families found more positive

parental well-being and parenting 
in gay father families and fewer 
externalizing behaviors compared 
with heterosexual families.101 With 
continued focus on families with 
gay male parents and improved 
data collection allowing for more 
generalizability across the population, 
a greater understanding of the family 
dynamics and contributions to child 
development in families that include 2 
fathers is certain to evolve.
Vulnerable and marginalized fathers, 
such as those who are socially 
or economically disadvantaged, 
adolescent, immigrant, or incarcerated 
but who wish to remain connected 
with their children, are especially 
important for pediatric outreach. 
More than 750 000 fathers are absent 
serving time in prison.102 A new 
program at the Boston Children’s 
Museum called Father’s Uplift brings 
previously incarcerated fathers to 
the museum to reengage with their 
children in a welcoming, imaginative, 
child-centered learning environment 
that supports diverse families in 
nurturing their children’s creativity 
and curiosity through joyful play. 
In a qualitative study, previously 
incarcerated black fathers expressed a 
need for employment, social support, 
and health care to rebuild healthy 
relationships with their children.102, 
103 
Increasingly, the relationship of 
children and incarcerated fathers 
is an area of study.104 The fathers of 
children born to unmarried teenaged 
mothers (resident or nonresident) may 
be an important protective factor if 
they remain involved in their children’s 
lives. The involvement of these fathers 
during their partners’ pregnancy 
has been associated with improved 
outcomes such as low birth weight 
and infant mortality and has become 
an increasing area of research.33
INFLUENCE OF FATHERS’ MENTAL AND 
PHYSICAL WELL-BEING ON CHILDREN’S 
AND FAMILIES’ HEALTH
A father’s own well-being can also 
influence the well-being of the 
child. Since the initial clinical report 
from the American Academy of 
Pediatrics was published, major 
research advances have been made 
in understanding paternal mental 
health problems.
Reviews of the literature in the 
postpartum period established a 
prevalence of depressed fathers 
that ranged from 2% to 25%, 
with an increase to 50% when 
mothers experienced postpartum 
depression.105–110 New fathers were 
1.38 times as likely to be depressed 
as comparably aged males.111 A 
recent study found that nonresident 
fathers reported higher depression 
symptoms during the transition to 
fatherhood, but resident fathers had 
a 68% increase in their depressive 
symptoms in the first 5 years of 
fatherhood.112 Because of higher 
rates of several stressors (eg, 
racism, unemployment, poverty, 
incarceration, and homelessness) 
not as commonly associated with 
white fathers, black fathers may be at 
higher risk of depression and other 
poor mental health outcomes.49, 
113, 
114 
Screening for postpartum depression 
by using the Edinburgh Postnatal 
Depression Scale has been validated 
for fathers as well as for mothers.115
The onset of depression in the 
postpartum period also occurs 
later for fathers (ie, up to a year 
postpartum) than mothers (ie, 
first 3 months postpartum).106 The 
expression of depression is different 
in men than in women, with men 
more likely to avoid emotional 
expression, deny vulnerability, 
and not seek help, which explains 
the discrepancy in prevalences 
between men and women.116, 
117 
Psychology researchers who 
study men and masculinity also 
contend that men experience 
depression in uncharacteristic 
ways, such as alcohol- and drug-
related comorbidity, compulsive 
and antisocial behavior, and 
interpersonal conflict marked with 
anger and defensive assertions.118 
This behavior can lead to marital 
stress and domestic violence, can 
undermine breastfeeding, and 
can increase the risk of marital 
breakup. Conversely, a healthy 
father can mitigate the adverse 
effects of maternal depression on 
the infant. This example is only 1 
of the ways in which fathers can 
buffer toxic stress, such as maternal 
substance abuse, a family death, or 
previous abuse. Recent research 
has shown that depressed fathers 
are 4 times as likely to spank their 
infants than nondepressed fathers 
and less likely to read to them.105, 
119 
Fathers’ ratings of 16 domains/
activities of their lives ranked the 
emotional experience of parenting 
along with work-life conflict as the 
most negative and the most tiring 
activities.120 Longitudinal studies 
of paternal depression scores from 
the National Longitudinal Health 
Survey showed the highest score 
for nonresident fathers on entry to 
fatherhood.112 Resident fathers have 
increased depression scores during 
early fatherhood (children 0–5 years 
of age), with a 68% increase by the 
time the children reach 5 years of 
age.112 More than one-fifth of fathers 
have experienced depression by the 
time their child is 12 years of age.121 
Child health care providers may find 
it useful to ask fathers with a history 
of mental illness how being with 
their children affects their mental 
illness and how their symptoms 
affect the way they interact with their 
children.122, 
123
Like maternal depression, which 
has long been known to affect the 
mother-infant relationship and child 
development, recent data reveal 
that paternal depression also has 
negative effects on child behavior, 
mood, and development. Depression 
in fathers is a risk factor for excessive 
infant crying.9 The Avon Longitudinal 
Study of Parents and Children, a 
sample of 12 884 fathers, showed 
that paternal depression in the 
postpartum period was associated 
e7

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
with an increase in child conduct 
problems at ages 3 and 5 years, 
even when maternal depression 
and other sociodemographic 
correlates were controlled for.124 
Depressed fathers affect child 
outcomes by way of mothers (ie, both 
mothers’ depression and couple’s 
conflict), which, in turn, adversely 
affects the child’s emotional and 
behavioral outcome.125 In a study 
in a community sample of parents 
and adolescents (N = 775), maternal 
depression and paternal depression 
were both significantly associated 
with depression in adolescents.126 
A meta-analysis of fathers’ mental 
health and child psychopathology 
found that paternal depression 
was significantly correlated with 
child and adolescent internalizing 
symptoms.127 Other studies have 
shown that father involvement 
is associated with a decrease in 
externalizing behavior problems.8 
Recent research highlights 
the epigenetic risk for older 
fathers, who are at higher risk of 
conceiving children with autism or 
schizophrenia, 
128 attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder, academic 
problems, Marfan syndrome, 
dwarfism, and substance abuse.9, 
129
Mental health problems of parents 
have predictable and negative 
consequences on parental child 
care habits, father involvement, and 
coparenting. Depressed parents 
tend to spend less time with their 
children (aged 3 years and younger) 
and limit physical contact (ie, 
hugging and cuddling) and are 
more likely to express frustration 
in child rearing.105, 
130 In a study 
in families of children enrolled in 
Head Start, nondepressed fathers 
were more involved with infants 
than were depressed fathers.131 
Similarly, depressed fathers in 
the Fragile Families and Child 
Wellbeing Study reported less 
father-child activities (engagement 
and reciprocal play), lower levels of 
relationship quality with the mother, 
and lower levels of coparental 
relationship supportiveness than did 
nondepressed fathers.132 Conflict 
in the coparental relationship may 
heighten the risk of the development 
of depression in fathers, 
106, 
108, 
125 
but more research is needed in this 
aspect of family life and paternal 
depression. Mental health problems 
in fathers are also highly correlated 
with later emotional disorders in 
their children.133, 
134
Becoming a father can be a 
transformative experience for men's 
physical health as well, during which 
men become motivated to take better 
care of themselves. President Barack 
Obama, in his Father’s Day 2008 
speech, 
135 said, “When I was a young 
man, I thought life was all about me—
how do I make my way in the world, 
and how do I become successful and 
how do I get the things that I want. 
But now, my life revolves around 
my 2 little girls.” Research shows 
that many men credit becoming a 
father as a reason to improve their 
diet, decrease risky behaviors and 
alcohol use, and increase physical 
activity.136 For children and families, 
this commitment to improved health 
behaviors bodes well, because a 
healthy father can protect against 
poverty by contributing to the family 
finances, sharing in child rearing, 
and often serving to introduce their 
offspring to the workplace in the 
form of first-time or summer jobs.
Just as children serve as motivation 
for fathers to improve their own 
health, 1 example of how a father’s 
physical well-being may affect a 
child’s well-being is obesity. Current 
research now suggests that when 
only 1 member of the parenting 
couple is in a higher weight status 
category, it is the father’s and not 
the mother’s weight status that is a 
significant predictor of later child 
overweight and obesity.137, 
138 In fact, 
the odds of a healthy mother and 
overweight father having an obese 
child 4 years later were 4.18 (95% 
confidence interval: 1.01–17.33), 
and the odds of a healthy mother 
and obese father having an obese 
child 4 years later were 14.88.139 
These results suggest that fathers 
are a key influence in shaping the 
family environment that leads to the 
development of child obesity.
Another example of how fathers can 
influence their children’s health and 
well-being is pertussis immunization. 
Pertussis continues to infect, on 
average, more than 3000 infants 
and results in more than 19 deaths 
per year, 
140 with the majority of 
cases, hospitalizations, and deaths 
occurring in infants younger than 
2 months who are too young to 
be vaccinated. In 1 report, fathers 
were the source of 15% of infant 
infections.141 The Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention recommends 
that infants be protected before they 
receive the first pertussis vaccine at 
6 to 8 weeks of age by vaccinating 
pregnant women and their close 
contacts in the peripartum period, 
but this recommendation has had 
limited success among fathers.140 A 
paternal pertussis vaccine is reported 
to avert 16% of pertussis cases.142 
Because of the need to reach fathers, 
some hospitals and health care 
providers have successfully provided 
the vaccination in the maternity ward 
or during pediatric encounters, 
143, 
144 
further emphasizing the need to 
include the consideration of fathers 
when considering the health of 
children.
The increases in fathering research 
outlined in this clinical report yield 
new understanding and insight into 
the important role and influence 
of fathers in the health, care, and 
development of their children and, 
in turn, have resulted in innovative 
approaches to support fathers. For 
example, New York City introduced 
a Young Men’s Initiative in 2011, 
committing $3 million, part of which 
established a City University of New 
York Fatherhood Academy to boost 
fathers’ parenting skills, resulting 
in a 15% decrease in teenage

pregnancies.145 The White House 
launched My Brother’s Keeper, 
146 an 
initiative aimed at bettering outcomes 
for some of the nation’s most at-risk 
young men. In addition, the White 
House recently expressed support 
for paid parental leave and held a 
White House summit on working 
fathers.147 A Dad 2.0 Summit was 
held in Houston148 in the winter of 
2014 to link multiple bloggers on 
fatherhood to corporations interested 
in marketing to a previously ignored 
group of men. The message is clear: 
fathers do not parent like mothers, 
nor are they a replacement for 
mothers when they are not at home; 
they provide a unique, dynamic, 
and important contribution to their 
families and children. Parenting 
interventions to encourage father 
involvement seldom acknowledge 
fathers’ coparenting role and need 
fundamental change.149 Pediatricians 
are encouraged to stay abreast of this 
information and take advantage of 
specific opportunities to intervene150 
to support the overall family as a way 
to ultimately improve child outcomes.
ADVICE FOR PEDIATRICIANS/CHILD 
HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS
Pediatricians are likely to see a 
growing number of fathers involved 
in the health and health care of their 
children. With so many advances in 
the understanding of the roles fathers 
play with their children, a number of 
suggestions on how to encourage and 
support fathers in a pediatric setting 
are provided. Pediatricians can begin 
by adopting 1 or 2 suggestions the 
next time they see a father with his 
child.
Fourteen Pediatric Opportunities to 
Involve Fathers in Ongoing Care
1. Welcome fathers and express 
appreciation for their 
attendance. Speak directly to the 
father as well as the mother or 
partner and solicit his opinions. 
Encourage office staff and nurses 
to actively encourage father 
involvement at all pediatric 
office visits, especially during the 
early critical years. Starting with 
the prenatal visit, actively engage 
the father (eg, at the prenatal 
visit, ask the father about his 
decision whether to circumcise 
the infant if male).
2. Introduce yourself to the father 
and the mother or other parent, 
especially if this is the first visit. 
Politely explore the father’s 
relationship to the other parent 
(eg, married, living together or 
not) and his cultural traditions 
and personal beliefs about 
his role in caring for the child. 
Assess differences in parenting 
beliefs and help parents 
negotiate, if necessary.
3. Recognize that mothers and 
fathers may not always agree 
on how best to raise a child. For 
example, parents may disagree 
on the approach to discipline 
or issues of firearm safety. 
Pediatricians can serve as a 
mediator in such discussions, 
meeting with both parents or 
caregivers together to discuss 
these and other behavior-
management issues, and should 
avoid (whenever possible) siding 
with 1 parent or the other on 
important parenting issues.
4. Emphasize how children look 
to their fathers as role models 
of behavior and are likely to 
imitate behaviors they see. 
Use this in a positive way to 
encourage the increased use 
of seat belts and helmets for 
bike riding and decreased 
tobacco, alcohol, and other 
substance use.
5. Screen fathers for perinatal 
depression. Useful screens 
include the Edinburgh 
Postpartum Depression Scale 
(EPDS) or the version that uses 
the partners report (EPDS-P), the 
Gotland Male Depression Scale 
(GMDS), and the more general 
Center for Epidemiological 
Studies Depression Scale 
(CES-D) and Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). As 
with maternal depression 
screening, have a plan in place 
(referral to own physician) 
if either parent screens 
positive or exhibits depressive 
symptoms.
6. Review the need for parents 
to keep up to date on adult 
vaccines and recommend any 
needed updates for vaccines, 
such as pertussis and influenza 
immunizations.
7. Stress the unique role many 
fathers play in encouraging age-
appropriate physical play and 
modeling physical activity such 
as exercise.
8. Explore the family composition, 
cultural beliefs about fathering 
and men’s roles in families, 
physical health of both parents, 
and the division of child care 
tasks within the family. If 
parents are not both living in 
the household, discuss living 
and visiting arrangements, 
time together, and custody 
arrangements. In the event of a 
parental separation or divorce, 
encourage both fathers as 
well as mothers to continue to 
communicate individually with 
the pediatrician.
9. Encourage fathers to assume 
some roles early on in the care 
of the child, and encourage 
the mother to let the father be 
involved and learn from his own 
mistakes. Early time alone with 
the child helps a father gain 
confidence and develop his own 
style of interaction and provides 
a mother or other parent with 
much-needed time alone. Ask 
fathers what skills they feel are 
lacking and develop a list of local 
or online resources to support 
fathers in gaining confidence and 
skills in parenting.

10. Inform the family about the 
normal elation, fatigue, and 
challenges of being a father. 
Discuss openly the usual 
interruptions in sleep for the 
whole family, the decreases 
in sleep for the whole family, 
the decrease in energy, the 
alterations in time together as a 
couple and individual free time, 
and the changes in intimacy and 
the sexual relationship. This may 
be the first time some fathers 
will have discussed these issues 
openly.
11. Educate fathers about the 
practicalities of breastfeeding 
and how to support mothers’ 
nursing. If mothers plan to 
return to work after the first few 
months at home, they may need 
the infant to be flexible about 
taking a bottle while they are 
at work. If so, this represents 
an opportunity for fathers to 
participate in feeding by offering 
a daily bottle of the mother’s 
milk (once breastfeeding is 
well established) to foster the 
necessary infant flexibility 
to take a bottle in addition 
to continuing to breastfeed 
whenever possible. In addition, 
fathers provide important skin-
to-skin care and help the mother 
in routine tasks that facilitate 
rest, bonding, and continued 
breastfeeding.
12. Discuss how the couple is 
adapting to parenthood (with 
each child). Asking questions 
such as “How is your relationship 
(or the family) adjusting to 
the new infant?” or “How is it 
now that your child is older?” 
opens the door to reflection 
and discussion and can remind 
parents of the importance of 
their own partner relationship 
and the need to nurture and 
maintain it. Encourage parents 
to continue to dedicate time 
for adult activities without 
children.
13. As advocates for children and 
families, pediatricians can 
identify current and necessary 
future public policies that 
support fathers’ involvement 
with their children. Promote the 
use of policies such as the Family 
Medical Leave Act (codified at 29 
CFR S825 [1993]) and flexible 
work schedules as ways to 
balance employment and family 
responsibilities. “Use it or lose it” 
paternity leave policies abroad 
have resulted in more than 
90% of new fathers taking brief 
paternity leave to bond with 
their newborn infants.
14. In most cases, permission for 
medical procedures can be 
granted by either legal parent, 
but in some cases it may be 
important to include both 
parents in such discussions and 
even legal documents. Even if 
not legally required, it is usually 
advisable for pediatricians 
to include fathers who share 
custody, whether residing with 
the child or not, in written 
communications about the child, 
such as results of testing or 
subspecialist evaluations.
