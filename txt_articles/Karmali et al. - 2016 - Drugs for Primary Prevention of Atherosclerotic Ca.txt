Abstract
Importance—The Million Hearts initiative emphasizes the “ABCS” - aspirin, blood pressure 
control, cholesterol management, and smoking cessation. Evidence for the effects of drugs used to 
achieve the ABCS has not been comprehensively synthesized in primary atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevention.
Objective—To compare the efficacy and safety of aspirin, blood pressure-lowering therapy, 
statin, and tobacco cessation drugs on fatal and non-fatal ASCVD outcomes in primary ASCVD 
prevention.
Evidence Review—Structured search of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 
Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment Database 
(HTA), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PROSPERO International Prospective Systematic Review 
Trial Register to identify systematic reviews published from January 1, 2005, to June 17, 2015, 
that reported the effect of aspirin, BP-lowering therapy, statin, or tobacco cessation drugs on 
ASCVD events in individuals without prevalent ASCVD. Additional studies were identified by 
searching the reference lists of included systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and health technology 
assessment reports. Reviews were selected according to predefined criteria and appraised 
formethodologic quality using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool 
(range, 0–11). Studies were independently reviewed for key participant and intervention 
characteristics. Outcomes that were meta-analyzed in each included review were extracted. 
Qualitative synthesis was performed, and data were analyzed from July 2 to August 13, 2015.

 Findings—From a total of 1967 reports, 35 systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials were 
identified, including 15 reviews of aspirin, 4 reviews of BP-lowering therapy, 12 reviews of statins, 
and 4 reviews of tobacco cessation drugs. Methodologic quality varied, but 30 reviews had 
AMSTAR ratings of 5 or higher. Compared with placebo, aspirin (relative risk [RR], 0.90; 95%CI, 
0.85–0.96) and statins (RR, 0.75; 95%CI, 0.70–0.81) reduced the risk for ASCVD. Compared with 
placebo, BP-lowering therapy reduced the risk for coronary heart disease (RR, 0.84; 95%CI, 0.79–
0.90) and stroke (RR, 0.64; 95%CI, 0.56–0.73). Tobacco cessation drugs increased the odds of 
continued abstinence at 6 months (odds ratio range, 1.82 [95%CI, 1.60–2.06] to 2.88 [95%CI, 
2.40–3.47]), but the direct effects on ASCVD were poorly reported. Aspirin increased the risk for 
major bleeding (RR, 1.54; 95%CI, 1.30–1.82), and statins did not increase overall risk for adverse 
effects (RR, 1.00; 95%CI, 0.97–1.03). Adverse effects of BP-lowering therapy and tobacco 
cessation drugs were poorly reported.
Conclusions and Relevance—This overview demonstrates high quality evidence to support 
aspirin, blood pressure-lowering therapy, and statins for primary ASCVD prevention and tobacco 
cessation drugs for smoking cessation. Treatment effects of each drug can be used to enrich 
clinician-patient discussions in primary ASCVD prevention.
INTRODUCTION
In 2011, the United States Department of Health and Human Services launched the Million 
Hearts initiative to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes over 5 years.1 Million Hearts 
includes a clinical emphasis on the ABCS, that is, aspirin for high-risk patients, blood-
pressure control, cholesterol management, and smoking cessation. Projections estimate that 
optimizing ABCS management could reduce the burden of atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease (ASCVD) substantially.2 To support the Million Hearts goal and identify new 
models of care delivery and payment, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation 
launched the Million Hearts Cardiovascular Risk Reduction Model in 2016, a cluster 
randomized payment model test to evaluate the effect of value-based payment to incentivize 
ASCVD risk assessment and reduction. This effort requires rigorous and transparent 
quantification of treatment effects for aspirin, blood pressure-lowering therapy, statins, and 
tobacco cessation drugs in primary ASCVD prevention.3 Despite the wealth of evidence 
synthesis activities within individual drug classes, we are not aware of any reports that have 
summarized the efficacy and safety of all 4 drug classes highlighted in the Million Hearts 
initiative for primary ASCVD prevention.
An overview of systematic reviews is a novel approach to appraise and synthesize results 
from multiple systematic reviews into a single, useful document that can be used to guide 
health care providers and policy makers.4–7 To address this evidence gap, we performed an 
overview of systematic reviews to compare the efficacy and safety of aspirin, blood 
pressure-lowering therapy, statin, and tobacco cessation drugs on fatal and non-fatal 
outcomes for primary ASCVD prevention.
METHODS
This overview followed guidelines outlined by the Cochrane Collaboration to synthesize 
effects of multiple interventions for an overarching clinical question using data from 
Karmali et al.

 published systematic reviews.4 We established a protocol and published it in PROSPERO.8 
The clinical question guiding this overview is presented in PICOTSS (patient, intervention, 
comparators, outcomes, timing, setting, and study design) format (Box). We also performed 
a supplemental systematic review to evaluate for potential interactions when combination 
drug therapy is used but found none (detailed search methods and results outlined in 
eAppendix 1 and 2 in the Supplement).
Review Eligibility Criteria
We included systematic reviews of randomized and quasi-randomized clinical trials 
comparing the pooled treatment effects of aspirin, blood pressure-lowering therapy, statin, or 
tobacco cessation drugs against placebo or usual care in adults (≥ 18 years of age) without 
ASCVD. For systematic reviews that included a combination of individuals with and 
without prevalent ASCVD, we included reviews that reported effect estimates for 
participants defined as “primary prevention.” When reports included both primary and 
secondary prevention populations, we included only those reports with <10% of the 
population with prevalent ASCVD.9 Systematic reviews or trials in which drugs were used 
to treat or control chronic conditions (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, renal 
disease, macular degeneration, and aortic stenosis) were excluded.
Outcomes
The primary outcomes for our review were (1) all-cause mortality; (2) fatal and nonfatal 
cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and stroke (ASCVD); and (3) adverse 
events as reported by the authors of included reviews. Secondary outcomes were (1) fatal 
and nonfatal ischemic heart disease events, including myocardial infarction, angina, and 
coronary revascularization; (2) fatal and nonfatal cerebrovascular events, including stroke 
and transient ischemic attack; (3) total nonfatal ASCVD events; (4) total and low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol levels; (5) systolic and diastolic BP; (6) health-related quality of life 
using validated instruments; and (7) direct costs. Secondary outcomes were: (1) fatal and 
non-fatal ischemic heart disease events, including myocardial infarction, angina, and 
coronary revascularization; (2) fatal and non-fatal cerebrovascular events, including stroke 
and transient ischemic attack; (3) total non-fatal ASCVD events; (4) total and low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol; (5) systolic and diastolic blood pressure; (6) health-related 
quality of life using validated instruments; and (7) direct costs.
Search Strategy
We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of 
Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA), MEDLINE, 
EMBASE, and PROSPERO International Prospective Systematic Review Trial Register 
from January 1, 2005, to June 17, 2015. We limited retrieval to English language systematic 
reviews. One of us (M.A.B.) who was an experienced information specialist performed all 
searches. Detailed search strategies with explanations of databases and search filters are 
included in eAppendix 1 in the Supplement.

 We identified additional eligible studies by searching the reference lists of included 
systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and health technology assessment reports. We contacted 
study authors when necessary to identify further information that we may have missed.
Study Selection and Data Extraction
Two of us (K.N.K. and M.D.H.) independently performed all tasks for study selection, data 
extraction, evidence synthesis, and quality assessment. Any discrepancies here and 
throughout were resolved through consensus or recourse to a third investigator (D.M.L.-J.).
We screened titles and abstracts and then full texts to identify relevant systematic reviews for 
inclusion. For studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, we independently abstracted key 
participant and intervention characteristics and reported data on prespecified outcomes using 
standardized data extraction templates. We also extracted pooled effect estimates for 
outcomes that were meta-analyzed in each included review. We reported dichotomous data 
as risk ratios (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We reported 
continuous data as mean differences (MDs) with 95% CI.
Evidence Synthesis
Data were analyzed from July 2 to August 13, 2015. We independently assessed the 
methodological quality of each systematic review using the Assessment of Multiple 
SysTemAtic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool.10 Because many systematic reviews included 
information from overlapping trials, we did not perform a separate meta-analysis of pooled 
effect estimates. Instead, we performed a qualitative synthesis for each drug intervention and 
reported the treatment effect from the most comprehensive and highest-quality systematic 
reviews as recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration and as has been performed in other 
overviews.4,6,11,12
We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation 
(GRADE) approach to rate the overall quality of the evidence.13 We created an adapted 
“Summary of Findings” table based on the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for 
Systematic Reviews of Interventions to convey key information about the best treatment 
effect for each drug intervention and overall confidence in this estimate.4
Secondary Analyses
We reported results that evaluated potential differences in drug effects between men and 
women, and people with and without diabetes mellitus when these results were presented by 
review authors. We were unable to quantify differences by race/ethnicity due to limitations 
of data availability and reporting.
Differences between protocol and overview
We revised our search strategy by using a “precision maximizing filter” after our initial 
search, which used a “sensitivity- and specificity-balancing filter,” produced unfeasibly large 
results. We also restricted our retrieval to English language because of time limitations for 
project completion. Lastly, we elected to include systematic reviews of tobacco cessation 
drugs that included some trials involving participants with known vascular disease. We made

 this decision because reviews addressed smoking cessation as the primary efficacy outcome 
and provided limited data on cardiovascular outcomes or mortality.
RESULTS
Search results
We performed 4 independent searches for systematic reviews evaluating the effects of: (1) 
aspirin, (2) blood pressure-lowering therapy, (3) statin, and (4) tobacco cessation drugs in 
the primary prevention of ASCVD. We present a PRISMA study flow in aggregate (Figure) 
and by drug class (eAppendix 3 in the Supplement).
Our search identified 1,967 records, of which 145 records were evaluated as full-text articles 
after title and abstract screening. In total, we selected 35 systematic reviews, available as 37 
reports for inclusion. There were: 15 systematic reviews evaluating the effect of aspirin,14–29 
4 systematic reviews of BP-lowering therapy,30–33 12 systematic reviews of statins,34–46 and 
4 systematic reviews of tobacco cessation drugs in a primary prevention setting.47–50 
Reasons for exclusion of each full text report and references to the excluded study are 
presented by drug class in eAppendix 4 in the Supplement.
Aspirin
Characteristics of included reviews—A summary of the 15 aspirin systematic reviews 
is provided in eAppendix 3 in the Supplement. Type 2 diabetes-specific treatment effects 
were provided in 6 reviews.18–20,24,28,29 The latest search ran through 2013.17 The reviews 
included data from 6 to 9 primary prevention trials with 95,456 to 102,621 participants. 
Trials generally included adults age 40 to 70 years, and weighted mean (SD) age of 
participants in the most comprehensive report was 57 (4) years.25
Trial quality assessment and review quality—Authors of included studies used a 
variety of criteria to judge trial quality, including risk of bias assessments, Jadad scores, 
Delphi process, and the United States Preventive Services Task Force quality criteria. Trial 
quality was generally assessed as “high”, and risk of bias was categorized as “low.” 
Systematic review quality, as measured by AMSTAR rating, ranged from a score of 5/11 to 
11/11. The most comprehensive and highest rated systematic review was a Health 
Technology Assessment by Sutcliffe et al. 2013.25
Efficacy/cardiovascular benefits—Treatment effects of aspirin on all-cause mortality, 
composite cardiovascular events, and individual component cardiovascular events were 
broadly comparable across all systematic reviews. The systematic review by Sutcliffe et al.25 
reported a 6% reduction in all-cause mortality (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88–1.00) and 10% 
reduction in major cardiovascular events (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85–0.96).25 Treatment effects 
on other outcomes are provided in eAppendix 3 in the Supplement.
Systematic reviews that reported type 2 diabetes-specific treatment effects demonstrated 
similar relative benefits compared with the general primary prevention group; however, all 
the upper 95% CIs included the possibility of no improvement. Sex-stratified analyses were 
reported in 4 systematic reviews,14,16,27,29 of which one was an individual participant data

 (IPD) meta-analysis of 6 primary prevention aspirin.14 These analyses demonstrated similar 
reductions in the composite cardiovascular disease outcome in men (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78–
0.98) and women (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76–1.01). However, the effects were driven by a 
reduction in major coronary events in men (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67–0.89) and ischemic 
stroke in women (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.59–0.99).
Safety, Adverse Effects, and Other Secondary Outcomes—Reviews varied in their 
definition of clinically important bleeding, but all 15 reported increased risk of bleeding and 
other hemorrhagic complications with aspirin therapy. The analysis from the Antithrombotic 
Treatment Trialists’ Collaboration, which accounted for differences in person-years of 
follow-up and used a standardized definition for “major bleeding” in pooled trials (major 
gastrointestinal and extracranial bleeding that were fatal or required blood transfusion), 
reported a 54% increased risk of major bleeding with aspirin therapy (RR 1.54, 95% CI 
1.30–1.82) and a 32% increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.00–1.75).14 
Data on other bleeding risks are shown in eAppendix 3 in the Supplement. Data on health-
related quality of life and direct costs were not reported in the identified systematic reviews.
GRADE assessment—We rated the quality of evidence for the effect of aspirin on all-
cause mortality as moderate, downgrading because of imprecision of treatment effect. We 
rated the quality of evidence for the effect of aspirin on reducing major cardiovascular events 
as high. We also rated the quality of evidence for the effect of aspirin on increasing major 
bleeding as high.
Blood pressure-lowering therapy
Characteristics of included reviews—We identified 4 systematic reviews of blood 
pressure-lowering therapy in primary ASCVD prevention,30–33 of which 2 of these 
reviews30,33 reported the effects of blood pressure reduction in individuals with “mild” or 
grade 1 hypertension (systolic blood pressure 140–149 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 
90–99 mmHg). Diabetes-specific treatment effects were not reported. The latest search ran 
through 2014 and included individual participant data from the Blood Pressure Lowering 
Treatment Trialists’ Collaboration (BPLTTC).33 The most comprehensive systematic 
reviews included 25 trials with 163,131 participants31 and 27 trials with 108,297 
participants.32 Only 8 trials overlapped between these 2 reviews owing to variations in 
search strategies, search time frames, inclusion criteria, and classification of primary 
prevention by authors of the included reviews. The mean age of participants ranged from 30 
to 80 years, and weighted mean age in the most comprehensive systematic review was 62 
years.32 A summary of systematic review characteristics and detailed characteristics from 
the full data abstraction are provided in eAppendix 3 in the Supplement.
Trial quality assessment and review quality—Authors of the included reviews used a 
variety of criteria to judge trial quality, including risk of bias and GRADE assessments. The 
authors report a range of quality assessments from “very low” to “high” quality for trials 
evaluating the effects of calcium channel blockers and diuretics. AMSTAR ratings ranged 
from a score of 4/11 to 9/11.

 Efficacy and Cardiovascular benefits—Treatment effects of BP-lowering therapy on 
all-cause mortality, composite cardiovascular outcomes, and individual component 
cardiovascular outcomes were broadly comparable across systematic reviews. The 
systematic review by Law et al.,32 the most comprehensive review, reported an 11% 
reduction in all-cause mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.85–0.95), 16% reduction in coronary 
heart disease events (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.79–0.90), and 36% reduction in stroke (RR 0.64, 
95% CI 0.56–0.73).32 Treatment effects standardized to a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic BP 
and 5 mmHg reduction in diastolic BP were also reported (eTable 2).
The effects of BP-lowering treatments in persons with “mild” or grade 1 hypertension were 
reported in 2 systematic reviews.31,33 The review by Sundström et al.33 was an update to the 
Diao et al. review30 and included individual participant data from 8 additional trials (10 
comparisons) from the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists’ Collaboration for a 
total of 13 trials and 15,266 participants with grade 1 hypertension. Sundström et al.33 
reported a 22% reduction in all-cause mortality (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67–0.92), a 14% 
reduction in total cardiovascular events (OR 0.86, 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.01), a 25% reduction in 
cardiovascular death (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57–0.98), and a 28% reduction in stroke (OR 0.72, 
95% CI 0.55–0.94). Overall, cardiovascular event rates were low in the trials, so effect 
estimates for total cardiovascular events and coronary events were imprecise.33
Type 2 diabetes mellitus-specific treatment effects were not reported for BP-lowering 
treatment. Sundström et al.33 reported no interaction by sex for all-cause mortality, total 
CVD events, coronary heart disease events, stroke events, or heart failure events, but a 
borderline interaction was present for CVD mortality (OR 0.58 95%CI 0.41–0.81 for men; 
OR 1.19 95%CI 0.74–1.91 for women; p=0.02).
Safety, Adverse Effects, and Other Secondary Outcomes—Only 1 systematic 
review30 reported an increased risk of treatment withdrawals due to adverse events and this 
was derived from one trial (RR 4.80, 95% CI 4.14–5.57). However, risk of bias for this 
outcome was high. The updated search by Sundström et al.33 noted that data on treatment 
withdrawal were “limited” but equally common in the active and control groups when 
available. Data on health-related quality of life and direct costs were not reported in any 
review.
GRADE assessment—We rated the quality of evidence for the effect of BP-lowering 
therapy on reducing all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease, and stroke as high. We rated 
the quality of evidence for the effect of BP-lowering therapy on treatment withdrawals as 
low, downgrading because of study limitations and inconsistency.
Statins
Characteristics of included reviews—We identified 13 reports of 12 systematic 
reviews of trials that investigated the effects of statins in primary prevention.34–46 Type 2 
diabetes mellitus-specific treatment effects were reported in 3 reviews36,39,41 and sex-
specific treatment effects were reported in 3 systematic reviews.34,37,43 The latest search ran 
through 2012.45

 The 2 most comprehensive reviews included 18 to 20 primary prevention trials involving 
56,934 to 63,899 participants.42,45 Mean age of participants generally ranged from 50 to 75 
years, and mean age in the most comprehensive review was 57 years.45 Two reports from the 
Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ (CTT) Collaboration37,38 were included in our overview. 
One of these reviews reported treatment effects 70,025 participants without prevalent 
vascular disease37 and the other reported treatment effects for 53,152 participants with a 5-
year predicted risk of a major vascular event 10% or less (>90% without prevalent vascular 
disease). A summary of systematic review characteristics is provided in eAppendix 3 in the 
Supplement.
Trial quality assessment and review quality—The authors reported that trials 
generally had low risk of bias, but many were funded by pharmaceutical companies.45 
AMSTAR ratings ranged from a score of 5/11 to 11/11. The most comprehensive and 
highest rated systematic review was by Taylor et al.45
Efficacy and cardiovascular benefits—Treatment effects of statins on all-cause 
mortality, total cardiovascular disease events, myocardial infarction, and stroke were broadly 
comparable across all systematic reviews. The systematic review by Taylor et al.45 reported 
a 14% reduction in all-cause mortality (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79–0.94), 25% reduction in 
major cardiovascular events (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.70–0.81), and reductions in fatal and 
nonfatal coronary heart disease and stroke events.45 Mean baseline (SD) low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) in CTT trials was 143.1 (27.1) mg/dL and mean (SD) 
difference in LDL between statin regimen and control was 41.8 mg/dL. Treatment effects 
standardized per 40.6 mg/dl (1 mmol/L) reduction in LDL cholesterol were also reported by 
the CTT for all-cause mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85–0.97) and major vascular events (RR 
0.75, 95% CI 0.70–0.80).38
Effects of statin treatment in participants with diabetes mellitus were reported in 3 
systematic reviews and demonstrated similar proportional benefits compared with the 
general primary prevention group.36,39,41 Sex-specific treatment effects were also reported 
in 3 systematic reviews,34,37,43 of which one was an individual participant data meta-
analysis.37 After adjusting for baseline differences in prognostic characteristics and 5-year 
vascular risk, no sex-specific heterogeneity was seen.37 Additional statin treatment effects 
are provided in eAppendix 3 in the Supplement.
Safety, Adverse effects, and other Secondary Outcomes—Data on adverse effects 
of statin treatment were included in 7 systematic reviews and included risks of cancer, 
creatine kinase elevation, rhabdomyolysis, liver enzyme elevation, hemorrhagic stroke, type 
2 diabetes, and serious adverse effects.34,35,37,38,42,45,46 Taylor et al.45 reported no evidence 
of increased risk of overall adverse effects (defined as cancers, myalgia and rhabdomyolysis, 
type 2 diabetes, hemorrhagic stroke, and other adverse effects leading to treatment 
discontinuation) among individuals treated with statin compared to control/placebo (RR 
1.00, 95% CI 0.97–1.03). However, there was an 18% increased risk for the individual 
outcome of type 2 diabetes for those treated with statin (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01–1.39).

 Data on health-related quality of life were not reported. Data on cost-effectiveness were 
reported in Taylor et al45 from 3 statin trials, all demonstrating cost-effectiveness of statin 
therapy in primary prevention. In the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study 
(WOSCOPS), statin treatment led to 2,460 years of life at £8,121 (or $12,788) per life-year 
gained. In the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: an Intervention Trial 
Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial, statin therapy had a cost-effectiveness of £25,796 
(or $40,315) per quality adjusted life year. Last, in an analysis from the Collaborative 
Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), Taylor et al.45 reported an incremental cost 
effectiveness ratio of £2,320 (or $3,626) per quality adjusted life year at 10 years.
GRADE assessment—We rated the quality of evidence for the effect of statins on 
reducing the risk of all-cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, coronary heart disease 
events, and stroke as high. We rated the quality of evidence for the safety of statins as 
moderate, downgrading because of indirectness of evidence.
Tobacco cessation drugs
Characteristics of included reviews—We included 4 systematic reviews of tobacco 
cessation drugs.47–50 None of the reviews differentiated between trials that included 
participants with and without prevalent vascular disease. Moreover, reviews reported limited 
information about the effects of tobacco cessation drugs on cardiovascular outcomes or risk 
factors. The primary efficacy outcome for most reviews was continuous smoking cessation 
at 6 months. Diabetes-specific or sex-specific treatment effects were not reported. The latest 
search ran through 2012.48 Mean age among participants in the most comprehensive 
systematic review was 57 years.48
The most comprehensive systematic review was an overview of several Cochrane systematic 
reviews by Cahill et al. addressing drug therapy for smoking cessation.48 This overview 
synthesized information from 267 trials of 101,804 participants. Among the trials, there 
were 150 trials of nicotine replacement therapy, 72 trials of antidepressants (primarily 
buproprion hydrochloride), and 24 trials of nicotine receptor partial agonists (primarily 
varenicline tartarate). A summary of systematic review characteristics is provided in 
eAppedix 3 in the Supplement.
Trial quality assessment and review quality—Authors reported that trials of nicotine 
replacement therapy and bupropion did not clearly describe methods of randomization or 
allocation concealment and were therefore at “high risk of bias.” Trials of varenicline were 
more contemporary and generally lower risk of bias, although they were industry funded.48 
AMSTAR ratings ranged from 7/11 to 11/11, and the highest rated systematic review was 
Cahill et al48 (eAppendix 3 in the Supplement).
Efficacay and smoking cessation—The overview by Cahill et al.48 reported treatment 
effects of tobacco cessation drugs on 6 months of continuous smoking abstinence, which 
was primarily biochemically verified. The overview reported that nicotine replacement 
therapy, buproprion, and varenicline all increased the odds of smoking cessation at 6 months 
compared to placebo (nicotine replacement therapy OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.71–1.99; bupropion

 OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.60–2.06; and varenicline 2.88, 95% CI 2.40–3.47). Cahill et al.48 also 
reported the effects of a limited number of tobacco cessation drugs on cardiovascular disease 
events. However, individual studies were underpowered for this endpoint, events were 
poorly reported, and many trials included participants with prevalent CVD. Treatment 
estimates for buproprion and varenicline for smoking cessation outcomes are listed in 
eAppendix 3 in the Supplement.
Safety, Adverse effects, and Other Secondary Outcomes—Cahill et al.48 also 
reported the effects of tobacco cessation drugs on serious adverse events for a limited 
number of therapies. For nicotine replacement therapy, limited information on serious 
adverse effects was reported in trials.48 Data for buproprion and varenicline were reported 
(RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.99–1.69 and RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.72–1.55, respectively).48 Data on 
health-related quality of life and direct costs were not reported.
GRADE Assessment—We rated the quality of evidence for the effect of varenicline on 
smoking cessation as high and the quality of evidence for the effect of buproprion and 
nicotine replacement therapy on smoking cessation as moderate, downgrading because of 
study limitations. We rated the quality of evidence for the safety of tobacco cessation drugs 
as moderate, downgrading because of indirectness of evidence. We rated the quality of 
evidence for the effect of tobacco cessation drugs on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular 
outcomes as low, downgrading because of study limitations, inconsistency, and imprecision.
DISCUSSION
Principal findings
We performed an overview of systematic reviews that synthesized evidence of the efficacy 
and safety of drugs that can be used in primary ASCVD prevention to achieve targets set by 
the Million Hearts initiative and that will be used in the Million Hearts Cardiovascular Risk 
Reduction model. There is high quality evidence that aspirin, BP-lowering therapy, and 
statins reduce the risk of ASCVD events from 10% to 25% among individuals without 
prevalent ASCVD. There is also high quality evidence that BP-lowering therapy and statins 
reduce the risk of all-cause mortality by 11% and 14%, respectively. There was no 
heterogeneity in treatment effect among subgroups of individuals with diabetes mellitus or 
by sex. There is moderate to high quality evidence that tobacco cessation drugs increase the 
odds of continued abstinence by 88% to 188%, but the direct effects on cardiovascular 
events are uncertain. A summary of findings table is presented in the Table.
Adverse effects of drug therapy were either not reported or poorly reported in many 
systematic reviews, and many review authors noted “under-reporting” of adverse events in 
the individual trials. Our search demonstrated high quality evidence that aspirin increases the 
risk of major bleeding by 54% and moderate quality evidence that statins do not increase the 
overall risk of adverse events, but risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus was increased among 
individuals taking statins. Adverse effects of BP-lowering therapy and tobacco cessation 
drugs were poorly reported.

 Strengths
Our overview has several strengths. First, we focused this evidence synthesis on systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials, because randomized clinical trials 
represent the highest-quality evidence to determine the effects of health care interventions. 
Second, we used a comprehensive, transparent search strategy to identify studies and 
followed a prespecified protocol to guide our evidence synthesis, noting any deviations from 
protocol. Third, we performed all title screening, data extraction, and quality assessments in 
duplicate to minimize potential bias in generation of this overview. Fourth, we used a 
validated instrument (the AMSTAR tool) to assess the methodologic quality of included 
systematic reviews and factored this quality assessment to guide our conclusions regarding 
the effects of pharmacologic interventions. This systematic process, with study quality 
assessment using standardized tools, could be used as a potential model for more rapid 
development of trustworthy guidelines.
Limitations
Our overview also has important limitations to acknowledge. First, we did not retrieve data 
from primary trials and therefore were limited to the information and judgments of the 
authors who wrote the systematic reviews. Selection criteria, search strategies, and 
definitions of primary prevention often varied between reviews, and authors of the included 
reviews often used different criteria to define primary prevention, which led to different 
numbers of trials for systematic reviews of the same drug. Second, our conclusions were 
limited by the available data. Although data were generally well reported for drug efficacy, 
limited information was reported on safety, particularly for BP-lowering therapy and tobacco 
cessation drugs. Third, we had limited ability to comment on the potential of differential 
treatment effects by race/ethnicity. Nevertheless, several reviews noted consistent 
proportional treatment effects regardless of baseline characteristics, suggesting that 
treatment effect does not demonstrate heterogeneity. Fourth, our treatment effect estimates 
were limited by the short-term horizon of the clinical trials. Thus, we may have 
underestimated the potential added benefits and risks of sustained treatment. Fifth, our 
overview does not include evidence from recent trials like the Japanese Primary Prevention 
Project (JPPP)51 or cost-effectiveness analyses of long-term statin use from WOSCOPS.52 
However, inclusion of these studies would not have changed our overall conclusions. For 
example, the point estimate for treatment effect from low-dose aspirin in the JPPP trial was 
similar to our reported effect, though with wider confidence intervals (HR 0.94, 95% CI 
0.77–1.15) and primary prevention statin therapy was also shown to be cost-effective at 15 
years of follow-up. Finally, our overview does not provide information on the added effects 
of lifestyle interventions such as diet, exercise, and weight loss in combination with drug 
therapy. However, essentially all included clinical trials of ASCVD prevention included 
background recommendations of therapeutic lifestyle change in combination with study 
drugs.
Conclusions
This overview of systematic reviews demonstrates high quality evidence to support aspirin, 
BP-lowering therapy, and statins for primary ASCVD prevention and tobacco cessation

 drugs for smoking cessation. It provides reliable, evidence-based pooled estimates for these 
interventions on the lowered risk of primary ASCVD events and best-available evidence for 
the effect of tobacco cessation drugs on continuous abstinence at 6 months. These treatment 
effects can be used to enrich discussions between health care professionals and patients.
