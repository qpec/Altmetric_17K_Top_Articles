Summary
 Background—The life expectancy of the average American with diabetes has increased, but 
the level of health and functioning of those extra years are not known.
 Methods—Comparing adults aged 50 to 70 with (n=3,027) and without diabetes (n=9,750), we 
assessed incident disability, remission from disability, and mortality between population-based 
Cohort 1 (born 1931-1941, followed 1992 to 2002) and Cohort 2 (born 1942-1947, followed 2002 
to 2012), from the Health and Retirement Study. Disability was defined by mobility loss, some 
difficulty with ≥1 instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and some difficulty with ≥1 
activities of daily living (ADL). Age-specific probabilities representing the two birth cohorts in the 
U.S. were entered into a five-state Markov model to estimate the number of years of disabled and 
disability-free life by age 70.
 Findings—Among persons with diabetes, compared with Cohort 1(n=1,071), Cohort 2 
(n=300) experienced more disability-free and total years of life, later onset of disability, and fewer 
disabled years lost. Solutions to the simulations of the Markov models suggest that among 50 year 
old diabetic men this amounted to a 0.8 to 2.3 year delay in disability across the 3 metrics

 (mobility p=0.01, IADL p=0.24, ADL p=0.01), while living 0.7 to 1.3 years longer (mobility 
p<0.0001, IADL p=0.001, ADL p<0.0001); results were similar for women. Parallel 
improvements in disabled life were gained across cohorts of non-diabetic adults (cohort 1 
n=9,218; cohort 2 n=2,727), although non-diabetic adults in both cohort 1 and cohort 2 had 
significantly more disability-free years (e.g., cohort 1: non-diabetic men from age 50: 17.0 vs 
diabetic men: 13.0; cohort 2: non-diabetic men from age 50: 17.9 vs diabetic men: 14.8) and fewer 
life years lost (e.g., cohort 1: non-diabetic men from age 50: 1.2 vs diabetic men: 2.8; cohort 2: 
non-diabetic men from age 50: 0.6 vs diabetic men: 1.5) than diabetic adults within the two 
cohorts (p< 0.0001).
 Interpretation—Regardless of diabetes status, adults experienced compression of disability 
and gains in disability-free life years.

 Introduction
Incidence and prevalence of diabetes have more than doubled in the past two decades in 
virtually all demographic subgroups of the U.S. population.(1) These trends have been 
accompanied by large reductions in mortality rates that have increased the number of years 
spent with diabetes for the average person and for the population overall.(2) As a result, the 
lifetime probability of diabetes has also increased dramatically, now reaching 40% for both 
men and women in the United States.(3) Although yearly rates of several diabetes-related 
complications declined during this period,(4) the impact of living more years of life with 
diabetes on the quality of those extra years of life remains unclear.
People with diabetes have double the incidence of physical disability, and the few estimates 
of trends in disability prevalence from surveys among the diabetic population suggest that 
there has been no change in the past 20 years.(5) Thus, whether recent clinical and public 
health efforts have been successful in compressing disability (i.e., reducing the number of 
years with disability) while increasing lifespans remains unclear. Compression occurs if the 
delay in onset of disability is greater than the increase in life expectancy. As a result, the 
average time spent in an active state (i.e., disability-free) will increase, both in absolute 
terms and as a proportion of total life expectancy (TLE).(6) Alternatively, expansion of 
disability occurs if the gain in TLE is associated with longer periods of disability, implying 
that medical advances have extended life for those suffering from disabling diseases, without 
changing the age of disability onset or the number of healthy years of life.
As diabetes is one of the most common conditions associated with increasing rather than 
decreasing prevalence, we assessed if disability expanded or was compressed among the 
diabetic population and compared it with that of the non-diabetic population among two 
consecutive birth cohorts between the ages of 50 and 70 years in the United States. We used 
a discrete Markov model to determine whether the net impact of recent trends in diabetes 
incidence, disability, and mortality have affected the average age of disability onset and the 
number of healthy and disabled years experienced by adults with and without diabetes.

  Methods
We analysed data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a population-based, 
prospective health interview survey of a cohort of adults ≥ 50 years in the United States.(7, 
8) These survey data were collected every two years from 1992 through 2012. We used birth 
cohorts to assess the net impact of recent trends in diabetes incidence, disability, and 
mortality. The first cohort (Cohort 1) included 9,750 (n=8,687 without diabetes; n=1,067 
with diabetes) respondents born from 1931 through 1941 and surveyed in 1992 (baseline) 
and biennially through 2002. The second cohort (Cohort 2) included 3,027 (n=2,727 without 
diabetes; n=300 with diabetes) respondents born from 1942 through 1947 surveyed in 2002 
(baseline) and biannually through 2012. Baseline response rates during the study ranged 
from 70% for cohort 2 to 81% for cohort 1 and the follow-up response rates ranged from 
84.0% to 89.1% for cohort 1 and from 87.1 to 90.7% for cohort 2.(9) The HRS is sponsored 
by the National Institute on Aging and conducted by the Institute for Social Research at the 
University of Michigan. The Health Sciences Institutional Review Board at the University of 
Michigan approved the HRS study design.
We developed a simulation model that incorporated the national levels of diabetes 
prevalence, incidence and mortality among the two birth cohorts. Using the model, we 
calculated the average age of disability onset, disability-years, and life years lost between 
age 50 and 70 among the diabetes and non-diabetes populations in the two birth cohorts. To 
test our hypothesis of no compression or expansion of disability, we compared Cohort 1 
(weighted to the 1992 U.S. population of the birth cohort born during 1931-1941, followed 
through 2002) with Cohort 2 (weighted to the 2002 U.S. population of the birth cohort born 
during 1942-1947, followed through 2012).
Diabetes was defined as the self-report by a respondent to HRS of a diabetes diagnosis (ie, 
being told by a doctor that he or she has diabetes or high blood sugar) at first interview or 
during the study period.(9) Disability was defined using three different disability domains: 
mobility, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and activities of daily living (ADL). 
Mobility disability was based on responses to questions regarding difficulty: 1) walking one 
block; 2) walking several blocks; 3) climbing one flight of stairs; 4) stooping, crouching, or 
kneeling; and 5) pushing or pulling a large object.(10) We defined mobility loss as having 
difficulty with four or five of these difficulties. In 1992 IADL disability was defined as 
having difficulty in performing at least one of the following: reading a map, using a 
calculator, and using a microwave; these are the activities that are assumed to have been 
used by Wallace and Herzog in their paper.(11) From 1994 through 2012, IADL was defined 
differently, as difficulty with any of using the telephone, taking medication, handling money, 
shopping, and preparing meals. Further explanation of how these variables were constructed 
has been published elsewhere.(7) ADL disability was defined as having difficulty in 
performing at least one of the following: walking across a room, getting in and out of bed, 
dressing, bathing, and eating.
Deaths were confirmed using the National Death Index and the Social Security Death Index. 
To obtain data on the condition of deceased respondents prior to their death, proxies for the 
respondents were interviewed. Next of kin are interviewed if a respondent dies, and if no

 next of kin, a friend is contacted. If the estate is not settled at the time of the exit interview, a 
post-exit interview at the next wave is conducted.
 Statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics were compared cohort 1 with cohort 2, among those with diabetes 
and among those without diabetes, using chi-squared statistics with 95% confidence 
intervals and a statistically significant cut-off of p<0.05. We conducted logistic regression 
using generalised estimating equations to obtain annual incidence of disability and mortality 
according to diabetes status by age group and also to determine the age-specific yearly 
probability of becoming disabled, dying, and remission to a non-disabled state among those 
who become disabled. Respondents that entered the study with prevalent disability were 
excluded from the incidence and remission estimates. We used inverse probability weighting 
to reduce bias related to missing data, whether it was due to loss of follow-up or non-
reporting by the respondent in that wave or previous waves.(12) In this method, logistic 
regression is used to determine the predicted value of having complete data; weights are the 
inverse of the probability of having complete data. To obtain these estimates, data were 
modelled with STATA version 13 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).
 Markov model with a 20 year time horizon
We developed a discrete-time Markov simulation model with annual transition. The model 
was applied to two populations, one for those with diabetes and the other for those who 
remained diabetes-free. The models predict disability-related outcomes from ages 50–70 
years, using probability estimates of disability, mortality and remission (figure). During each 
1 year interval, individuals may move from and to one of the five states: not disabled, short-
term disability, not disabled but with previous disability, long-term disability and death. 
Because of the high recovery rates observed in the data, we created two bridge states of 
short-term disability and not being disabled but had disability history. Short-term disability 
is defined as being disabled less than one year, in contrast with long-term disability defined 
as remaining disabled more than one year. In the model, individuals with short-term 
disability revert to not being disabled, die, or continue to be disabled after one year of 
disability onset. Based upon data from HRS, individuals may have multiple episodes of 
short-term disability over a lifetime.
To understand the impact of diabetes on twenty-year disability outcomes, we estimated and 
compared outcomes with those of individuals of the same ages without diabetes that 
remained without diabetes until death. The confidence intervals of the twenty-year estimates 
were estimated using Monte Carlo simulation, with 10,000 random draws of age- and sex-
specific estimates (5,000 for each sex) from the underlying parametric distributions derived 
from HRS data.

  Results
Cohort 1 included 9,754 respondents, 1,067 of whom had a diabetes diagnosis and 8,687 of 
whom did not; cohort 2 included 3,027 subjects, 300 of whom had a diabetes diagnosis and 
2,727 of whom did not. Age-adjusted diabetes prevalence did not differ between persons 
born in the 1940's with those born in the 1930's, (9.9% (95% CI, 9.3, 10.4) vs 9.2% (95% 
CI, 8.1, 10.4). However, BMI, educational attainment, and age each differed by cohort (table 
1). Among those with and without diabetes, the baseline prevalence of history of stroke and 
self-reported high blood pressure at baseline increased significantly from the baseline of the 
first cohort to the second (p<0.05). Among those without diabetes, the prevalence of current 
smokers declined significantly from 27.2% (95% CI, 25.8, 28.7) to 21.2% (95% CI, 18.8, 
23.8).
The proportions of respondents with prevalent ADL and mobility loss at baseline were 
significantly higher among those with diabetes than among those without. Yet, the 
prevalence of mobility loss and difficulty with ADLs decreased significantly among those in 
cohort 2 compared with cohort 1, for those with and without diabetes. IADL differences are 
not reported at baseline because of the differences in measurements in 1992 from the rest of 
the interview years.
We found significant differences between cohorts within age group for incidence of 
disability, recovery from disability, and mortality by disability status, though it varied some 
by diabetes status (p<0.05; table 2). Between the two cohorts, incidence of mobility loss, 
IADLs and ADLs decreased among those aged 50-60 years and 61-70 years among adults 
with and without diabetes. Recovery from incident disability increased among both age 
groups for all disability types, with the exception of mobility loss among those with diabetes 
aged 50-60 years. Mortality decreased among those with ADLs aged 50-60 years for those 
with diabetes.
 Healthy and Disabled Life Years
Among diabetic men from ages 50 and 60, there was a significant -1.3 (95%CI: -1.7, -0.8; 
from 2.8 to 1.5) and -0.3 (95%CI: -0.6, 0.0; from 1.6 to 1.3) year decrease, respectively, in 
life years lost (i.e., total remaining life years up to age 70) between the two periods, with a 
delay in the age of onset of disability from age 50 for all disability types and from age 60 for 
mobility loss and ADLs (table 3 and appendix table). From age 60, diabetic men in Cohort 2 
experienced later age of disability onset for all three disability types (0.9 to 1.4 years later in 
cohort 2), more disability-free years (0.9 to 1.4 years fewer) and fewer disabled years 
(difference of 0.7-1.1 years) than those in Cohort 1.
Like men with diabetes, non-diabetic men had a postponement of disability onset, along 
with equivalent increases in healthy years of life and a reduction in years of disabled life 
from age 60 to 70.
Among diabetic women there was a delay in the age of onset of mobility loss accompanied 
by more non-disabled years and fewer life years lost. For example, 60 year old diabetic 
women in Cohort 2 experienced later age of disability onset for all three disability types (1.2

 to 1.6 years later), more disability-free years (1.2-1.6 more years) and fewer disabled years 
(1.1-1.4 fewer) than those in Cohort 1 (table 4). These encouraging findings are similar 
among non-diabetic women, who also had significant increases in non-disabled years and 
decreases in disabled years.
All differences between those with diabetes and without diabetes within each cohort by sex, 
age, and disability type were statistically significantly different (p<0.001).
 Discussion
In this comparison of disability and mortality between U.S. adults born in the 1940's versus 
the 1930's, persons with diabetes are generally becoming disabled later and living more 
disability-free years by the age of 70. These improvements in health status – suggesting a 
compression of morbidity – affected adults both with and without diabetes, both sexes, and 
were observed across different disability definitions. We noted some differences by sex: men 
gained total years of life from ages 50 and 60, whereas women only had decrease in life 
years lost from age 50.
The difference in healthy years over time was driven by 3 factors in our model: mortality, 
incident disability, and remission from disability. With the exception of IADLs, disability-
free life years increased among the all groups because mortality risk and disability risk 
declined in tandem, along with an increase in remission from disability. The non-diabetic 
population in the first cohort, however, had a greater number of healthy years and later 
disability onset than their diabetic peers. Even though they had less chance of improvement, 
those without diabetes in cohort 2 improved significantly compared to cohort 1 in terms of 
disabled and life years as those with diabetes.
Although our analyses could not assess the factors explaining the compression of disability 
in the U.S. population, our findings are consistent with the concurrent improvements in the 
management and control of cardiovascular disease risk factors and HbA1c as well as 
improved processes of care and reductions in diabetes-related complications and other 
chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular disease.(13-15) The decreases in mortality of the 
diabetic population have been previously documented in the United States(2) and in other 
populations(16), but may also have the effect of suppressing reductions in prevalence of 
chronic conditions, as was evident in the fact that stroke and heart disease prevalence 
increased, rather than decreased over time in the diabetic population.
Over the period from 1997 to 2007, diabetes was shown to increasingly contribute to 
disability among people aged 50 to 64.(17) However, that study assessed the prevalence of 
disability, unlike our study which excluded prevalent disability cases and assessed incidence 
of disability and remission from disability which are different metrics. Other reported causes 
of difficulty with a physical function included depression, heart problems, hypertension, and 
weight problems. Although our analyses did not assess factors modifying the changes in 
disability, morbidity, and healthy life years, our analysis of baseline characteristics suggests 
that increases in BMI, prevalent hypertension, and history of stroke are all plausible factors 
for the gap between those with diabetes and those without. Class II and class III obesity

 increased from 73 to 123 percent between the 2 cohorts among diabetic adults while only 
increasing 31% for both and from a much lower proportion in cohort 1 for those without 
diabetes; these categories of obesity have previously been shown to carry 1.4 and 1.8 times 
the prevalence of disability compared to normal weight persons aged over 65 years.(18) 
Stroke prevalence, which increased 4.7 percentage points in the diabetic population over 
time, has been associated with a 50 percent increased risk of disability.(19) Although rates 
of diabetes-related complications have declined substantially over the past two decades, the 
absolute numbers of diabetic adults with complications persists because of the continued 
increase in the prevalence of diabetes.(4)
Our findings show that among those without diabetes, more years of total life remaining 
combined with postponing or recovering from disability results in a greater number of 
healthy life years. This finding could be related to increases in those following a healthy 
lifestyle, which prolongs life expectancy and postpones disability.(6) It is also possible, 
however, that more healthy life years are being achieved due to more healthcare utilisation, 
and in some cases, expensive procedures. For example, from 1999 to 2008, there was a 
dramatic increase in the rate of knee replacements (tripling for those 45-64 years and 
doubling for those ≥ 65 years) in the United States, which substantially reduces pain and 
improves functioning among people with severe knee problems.(20) Future studies should 
consider how other aspects of care, whether efficient, low-expense primary care, or 
advanced therapies for other chronic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and 
musculoskeletal conditions, are affecting disability rates.
There are several limitations to our study. First, our discrete-time Markov model considered 
those without diabetes to remain diabetes-free until death. However, the age-specific 
probabilities used as input into the model included incident cases of diabetes. By using 1-
year transition cycle simulations, the age-specific probabilities by diabetes accounted for the 
incident diabetes cases (i.e., those who did not become disabled prior to diabetes diagnosis, 
as those who became disabled prior to diabetes diagnosis would have been censored after 
disability onset). Second, our Markov model does not allow for stratification of the 
transitions by multiple factors, such as obesity, physical activity, high blood pressure, 
cardiovascular disease, education, and depression, which could explain many of the 
differences between those with and without diabetes observed. A separate study of HRS data 
found lower wealth and education to be associated with higher levels of disability and earlier 
onset of disability.(21) Thus the greater education attainment achieved in cohort 2 may be 
associated with the compression of disability and later onset of disability. Third, our 
analyses were limited by lack of data beyond age 70 in cohort 2, which led us to restrict 
analyses of both cohorts to the 50 to 70 age-range to permit a valid comparison of the two 
cohorts. Thus, our analyses should be regarded as examination of fairly early disability, as 
opposed to more common age-related disability that occurs between age 70 and death. 
Fourth, data for age at diabetes diagnosis were not available for cohort 2 at baseline. Given 
that cohort 2 was on average 1 year older than cohort 1 and the prevalence of obesity was 
much greater among cohort 2, they likely had a longer duration of diabetes which may have 
affected the onset of disability. Fifth, disability measures were self-reported difficulty with 
performing tasks which may not be considered ‘disability’ but we used four or five tasks to 
define severe mobility loss to lessen potential bias. Although IADLs were measured differed

 during the baseline of cohort one, there was consistency across the remaining the interview 
years, therefore this difference should pose minimal bias in assessing incidence and 
remission of IADL difficulty. Finally, our study design does not allow us to separate the 
effects of period differences from cohort differences, but remains the first study that we are 
aware of to quantify whether later cohorts with diabetes are experiencing a compression of 
morbidity relative to earlier cohorts.
Few studies have quantified healthy and disabled life years in adults with diabetes.(22-24) A 
previous analyses of Health and Retirement Survey data found that persons with diabetes 
become disabled 6 to 7 years earlier than persons with diabetes. Estimates from the Global 
Burden of Disease Study (GBD) suggest that diabetes is the 7th leading cause of increased 
years with disability.(24) However, the GBD estimated disabled life years is based on a 
combination of prevalence and standard disability weights, which is driven by prevalence 
and therefore does not lend itself to direct comparison with our estimates, which 
incorporated individual-level disability incidence estimates and are independent of 
prevalence. Our analyses are also not directly comparable to studies of trends in disability 
prevalence because our estimates incorporate incidence of and remission from disability, as 
well as mortality.(17) We are not aware of previous studies examining trends in healthy and 
disabled life years among a national sample of these birth cohorts. In addition to having 
important implications for patients with diabetes and the families and health systems that 
care for them, trends in healthy years of life serve as an indication of whether clinical and 
public health goals to compress disability are being achieved. It is unknown whether the 
compression of disability among those with and without diabetes, will continue. Our 
analyses only included those born up to 1947; one study examining Baby Boomers (born 
1947 and after) found that difficulty with ADLs increased significantly for this generation.
(25)
If reduction in mortality occurs because of longer survival with diabetes and disability, then 
length of life with both will increase. One intervention study among obese adults with type 2 
diabetes found that a mean weight loss of 7% or more and increasing duration of physical 
activity to more than 175 minutes a week led to a reduction of 48% in the severity of 
mobility-related disability.(10) In addition, a systematic review on interventions to prevent 
disability in frail community-dwelling adults found that relatively long-lasting and multi-
component, several-times weekly physical activity programs for moderately physically frail 
older persons can be protective against disability.(26) Healthy lifestyle programs including 
physical activity also reduce the risk of developing clinically significant symptoms of 
depression and preserve physical quality of life among overweight adults with diabetes.(27) 
Because of the possible burden of new cases of mobility loss among those with and without 
diabetes aged 50-64 years, physical activity programs may be helpful in reducing the risk of 
disability in this age group. In addition, factors leading to disability, such as weight and 
physical and mental functioning, might be addressed so that the benefits of better health care 
are optimised. Ultimately, the decrease in disability onset due to primary prevention of 
diabetes may play an important role in achieving longer disability-free life years.

 Research in context
Evidence before this study
Mortality rates among people with diabetes are declining, as are yearly rates of several 
diabetes-related complications, but the impact of living more years of life with diabetes 
on the quality of those extra years of life remains unclear. Although cross-sectional 
studies have shown that the disability prevalence among the diabetic population has not 
changed in the past 20 years, it is unknown if clinical and public health efforts have been 
successful in compressing disability (ie, reducing the number of years of disability into 
the last years of life). Few studies have quantified healthy and disabled life years in adults 
with diabetes. A previous analyses of Health and Retirement Survey data found that 
persons with diabetes become disabled 6 to 7 years earlier than persons with diabetes.
Added value of this study
We are not aware of previous studies examining trends in healthy and disabled life years 
among a national sample of these birth cohorts. In this comparison of disability and 
mortality between U.S. adults born in the 1940's versus the 1930's, persons with diabetes 
are generally becoming disabled later and living more disability-free years by the age of 
70. These improvements in health status – suggesting a compression of morbidity – 
affected adults both with and without diabetes, both sexes, and were observed across 
different disability definitions.
Implications of all the available evidence
Available evidence related to compression of disability among adults with diabetes 
suggests that healthy lifestyles that assist in a maintenance of healthy weight and lean to 
fat ratios are effective in reducing disability among adults with diabetes. Similarly, 
evidence based approaches to prevent diabetes and cardiovascular disease through both 
lifestyle modification and preventive care risk factors to reduce CVD are also important 
for continued reduction in diabetes-related morbidity and disability.
