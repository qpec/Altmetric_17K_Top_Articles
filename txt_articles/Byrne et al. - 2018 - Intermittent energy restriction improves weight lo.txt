BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The MATADOR (Minimising Adaptive Thermogenesis And Deactivating Obesity Rebound) study
examined whether intermittent energy restriction (ER) improved weight loss efficiency compared with continuous ER and, if so,
whether intermittent ER attenuated compensatory responses associated with ER.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: Fifty-one men with obesity were randomised to 16 weeks of either: (1) continuous (CON), or (2) intermittent
(INT) ER completed as 8 × 2-week blocks of ER alternating with 7 × 2-week blocks of energy balance (30 weeks total). Forty-seven
participants completed a 4-week baseline phase and commenced the intervention (CON: N = 23, 39.4 ± 6.8 years, 111.1 ± 9.1 kg,
34.3 ± 3.0 kg m − 2; INT: N = 24, 39.8 ± 9.5 years, 110.2 ± 13.8 kg, 34.1 ± 4.0 kg m − 2). During ER, energy intake was equivalent to 67% of
weight maintenance requirements in both groups. Body weight, fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM) and resting energy expenditure
(REE) were measured throughout the study.
RESULTS: For the N = 19 CON and N = 17 INT who completed the intervention per protocol, weight loss was greater for INT
(14.1 ± 5.6 vs 9.1 ± 2.9 kg; Po0.001). INT had greater FM loss (12.3 ± 4.8 vs 8.0 ± 4.2 kg; Po0.01), but FFM loss was similar (INT:
1.8 ± 1.6 vs CON: 1.2 ± 2.5 kg; P = 0.4). Mean weight change during the 7 × 2-week INT energy balance blocks was minimal
(0.0 ± 0.3 kg). While reduction in absolute REE did not differ between groups (INT: -502 ± 481 vs CON: − 624 ± 557 kJ d − 1; P = 0.5),
after adjusting for changes in body composition, it was significantly lower in INT (INT: − 360 ± 502 vs CON: − 749 ± 498 kJ d − 1;
Po0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Greater weight and fat loss was achieved with intermittent ER. Interrupting ER with energy balance ‘rest periods’
may reduce compensatory metabolic responses and, in turn, improve weight loss efficiency.

INTRODUCTION
Part of the difficulty in losing weight and maintaining weight loss
by lifestyle changes is that the body responds to energy restriction
(ER) through a series of compensatory changes in biological and
behavioural determinants of body weight.1,2 A key component of
this is a reduction in resting energy expenditure (REE), which has
been observed in lean rodents and humans during fasting and
severe ER.3–5 Paradoxically, it is also seen in people with
overweight or obesity after only modest weight loss,6–8 as we
have outlined in a recent review.9
Given that REE is determined largely by body size and
composition, it is expected to decrease with weight loss. However,
during ER, REE has been reported to decrease to a greater extent
than that expected from changes in body composition, a
phenomenon termed ‘adaptive thermogenesis’.10 This leads to
markedly reduced efficiency of weight loss. For instance, we11 and
others12,13 have shown that, at the onset of prolonged continuous
ER interventions, actual weight loss was almost 100% of that
expected from energetic calculations. However, as the period of
continuous ER continues, weight loss per unit energy deficit was
substantially reduced, and a large proportion of the less than
expected weight loss could be explained by the reduction in
REE.11 Therefore, finding ways to attenuate this adaptive decrease
in REE during ER may improve weight loss and maintenance.
Although some studies of adults with overweight or obesity
suggest that compensatory responses to ER and weight loss
persist beyond the ER period,14–19 other research suggests that
many of these responses can be reversed following a 7- to 14-day
period of energy balance post-weight loss.1,20 This raises the
possibility that periods of deliberate energy balance could be
exploited during dietary interventions to enhance the efficiency of
weight loss. This approach is akin to periodisation in exercise
training
programmes
which
incorporate
stimulus
cycles
to
progressively overload the physiology and stimulate positive
adaptations in functional capacity, and cycles of reduced training
volume designed to avoid overtraining and the negative effects
on performance that result from chronically high training loads.21
In a similar way, an intermittent approach to ER, consisting of
cycles of restriction interspersed with periods of energy balance,
may attenuate compensatory responses associated with chronic
ER, and thus provide a more effective and sustainable weight loss
strategy than traditional continuous approaches.
We proposed that an optimal intermittent ER cycle might be to
combine 2-week blocks of energy balance (sufficient time for the
attenuation of adaptive thermogenesis) with ER blocks of the
same length. The use of 2-week blocks of ER is based on analysis
of the seminal Minnesota semi-starvation studies which revealed
that the reduction in REE accompanying ER comprises two phases;
a rapid, early phase (~2 weeks22,23) which is likely attributable to

 alterations in processes regulating cellular metabolism in response
to an acute change in energy balance,13,24–26 and a later phase
where the reduction in REE is a function of reduced body tissue.27
Based on the above considerations, we examined the effect of
repeatedly interrupting ER with deliberate periods of energy
balance (intermittent ER), in terms of its effects on body weight,
body composition and REE. We hypothesised that, compared with
continuous ER, intermittent ER, delivered as alternating 2-week
blocks of ER and energy balance, would result in more efficient
weight and fat loss (greater loss per unit ER), and that the
compensatory reduction in REE typically associated with contin-
uous ER, would be attenuated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The MATADOR (Minimising Adaptive Thermogenesis And Deactivating
Obesity Rebound) study was a single-centre, parallel-group, randomised
controlled trial. The study was granted ethics approval through the
University
Human
Research
Ethics
Committee
at
the
Queensland
University of Technology, Australia. Fifty-one males with obesity were
recruited in cohorts and, after screening, were allocated to the continuous
(CON) or intermittent (INT) ER interventions. Participants initially undertook
a 4-week baseline (weight stabilisation) phase to determine energy needs
and help them to accommodate to the study diet macronutrient
composition, and then undertook 16 weeks of ER delivered as either:
(1) CON: 16 weeks of continuous (daily) ER, or (2) INT: 16 weeks of ER as
8 × 2-week blocks of ER interspersed with 7 × 2-week blocks of energy
balance (30 weeks total; please see study design in Supplementary Item 1).
Both groups then completed an 8-week post-weight loss energy balance
phase. Including the 4-week baseline, 16- or 30-week ER, and 8-week post-
weight loss energy balance phases, the total length of the intervention was
28 and 42 weeks for the CON and INT groups, respectively. Food was
provided for each of these three phases (further details in the section
Provision of diet, below). Participants were followed up after a 6-month
free-living period.
Eligibility criteria for participants
Eligible participants were males aged 25–54 years, with a body mass index
classified as obese (30–45 kg m − 2), weight-stable (±2 kg for 6 months prior
to participation) and sedentary (o60 min of structured moderate to
vigorous intensity physical activity per week). Exclusion criteria are listed in
Supplementary Item 2.
Recruitment and screening strategies
Supplementary Item 3 is a CONSORT diagram providing an overview of the
flow of participants through the study. The three-step screening process to
assess eligibility is detailed in Supplementary Item 4. After providing
informed consent, participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to
either the CON or INT interventions. While it was not possible to blind
participants or research staff to the assigned treatment groups, there was
no discussion with the participants regarding the difference between the
two interventions. As shown in the CONSORT diagram, 51 men were
randomised and commenced the 4-week baseline weight stabilisation
phase, 47 completed the baseline phase, 41 completed the ER phase (16 or
30 weeks, in the CON and INT groups, respectively), and 36 completed the
ER phase per protocol, which was defined as completion of the assigned ER
intervention (CON or INT) without weight gain while in restriction, and
meeting assessment requirements up to and including Week16 ER.
Determination of weight maintenance energy requirements
Weight maintenance energy requirements were estimated for each
participant
by
multiplying
measured
REE
(detailed
below)
by
an
appropriate physical activity level based on self-reported work-time and
leisure-time physical activity. Participants were prescribed an individua-
lised diet (detailed below) designed to maintain weight stability, and were
provided with an electronic weighing scale to self-record body weight at
home. These weights were used to assess the adequacy of energy intake
for weight maintenance, and to adjust energy intake as required. If
participants gained or lost weight consistently over at least 3 days, they
were provided with instructions on how to adjust the energy intake of the
provided diet to maintain weight stability.
Energy restriction interventions
The study was designed so that the ER diet for participants in both groups
was equivalent to 67% of individual weight maintenance energy
requirements (that is, 33% reduction in energy intake). The energy intake
prescription was adjusted to account for reductions in REE that were
measured after every 4 weeks of ER, to ensure that participants remained
in the same relative energy deficit throughout the study. Consequently, the
absolute deficit (kJ d − 1) decreased significantly over time (Po0.001) in
both groups, but did not differ between CON and INT groups (P = 0.49):
WK1-4ER: -4142 ± 442 and − 4009 ± 647 kJ d − 1; WK5-8ER: − 3998 ± 464 and
− 3885 ± 538 kJ d − 1; WK9-12ER: − 3902 ± 505 and − 3790 ± 583 kJ d − 1;
WK13-16ER: − 3810 ± 533 and − 3740 ± 444 kJ d − 1. During the seven
energy balance blocks in the INT group, participants were prescribed a
diet providing 100% of weight maintenance energy requirements.
Provision of diet
Participants were provided with all main meals and morning and afternoon
snacks for the duration of the study (28 or 42 weeks for the CON and INT
interventions, respectively). Meals were prepared by a commercial kitchen
under the direction of a dietician and delivered to the participants’ homes
each week. This ‘base’ diet supplied the majority of each participant’s
energy requirements. The remaining energy intake came from additional,
discretionary items, chosen by individual participants in consultation with
a researcher (REW). Inclusion of discretionary items in a long-term
(24-–month)
dietary
intervention
has
been
shown
to
increase
compliance.28 The planned macronutrient distribution in both ER and
energy balance diets was 25–30% of energy as fat, 15–20% as protein and
50–60% as carbohydrate. Participants were required to complete daily self-
report food diaries for the duration of the study (28 or 42 weeks for CON
and INT groups, respectively). The completion of these diaries was required
for participants to be considered compliant with the study requirements,
but the data have not been analysed as a measure of dietary adherence.
Overview of data collection
As shown in Supplementary Item 1, weight, body composition and REE
were measured at the start and end of the 4-week baseline phase, after
every 4 weeks of ER, at weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8 of the 8-week post-ER energy
balance phase, and at follow-up 6 months later. Resting energy
expenditure is not reported for the post-ER energy balance and 6-month
follow-up time points due to a large amount of missing data. During ER,
measurements were taken after the same number of weeks of ER for both
groups. For example, the Week 4 measurement was taken 4 weeks after
baseline for the CON group, and 6 weeks after baseline for the INT group
(that is, after the first 2 × 2-week blocks of ER separated by 1 × 2-week
block of energy balance). As another example, the Week 8 measurement
was taken 8 weeks after baseline for the CON group, and 14 weeks after
baseline for the INT group (that is, after 4 × 2-week blocks of ER separated
by 3 × 2-week blocks of energy balance). Measurements were included
every 4 weeks during the ER intervention to provide information on the
time course of responses, in addition to pre-post comparisons. All
measurements during the ER intervention were taken during restriction
in both groups. For the INT group, measurements were made at the end of
a 2-week block of ER.
Body height, weight and composition
Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a Harpenden
stadiometer (Holtain Ltd, Crosswell, UK). At each laboratory visit, body
weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a calibrated digital scale,
and body composition was calculated from body density measured by air
displacement
plethysmography
(BOD
POD,
Life
Measurement
Inc.,
Concord, CA, USA). In addition to laboratory measurements of weight, all
participants were provided with an electronic weighing scale (Model
WW147A, Conair Australia, Pty Ltd, Terrey Hills, NSW, Australia), and asked
to record body weight at least weekly during the study. These self-reported
body weights were used to track progress throughout the study, and
provide additional information on the time course of changes in weight in
the periods between laboratory visits.
Resting energy expenditure
resting energy expenditure was measured using a ventilated hood system
(TrueOne 2400 Metabolic System, ParvoMedics Inc, Sandy, UT, USA), which
was calibrated before each measurement using standardised gases. All

 testing was conducted between 0600 and 0900 h after a minimum 10-h
overnight fast. Participants arrived at the laboratory by car and were
instructed to minimise physical activity prior to arrival. Testing was
performed in a thermo-neutral environment with participants lying supine
in a comfortable position, head on a pillow, and a transparent ventilated
hood placed over their head. During the measurement period, participants
were asked to remain as relaxed as possible without falling asleep, and
instructed not to talk or fidget. To reduce boredom and prevent sleep,
participants listened to quiet music throughout the measurement. VO2 and
VCO2 were measured continuously for 30 min. After discarding the first
10 mins of data, REE was calculated as the lowest consecutive 10-min
average value, provided that the coefficient of variation within that 10-min
interval was o5%. Resting energy expenditure was calculated using the
Weir equation.29
Calculation of predicted REE, and of changes from baseline
Given the contention regarding the best analytical approach to assess and
define adaptive thermogenesis,30–38 we examined changes in REE using
three approaches:
1. Comparing REE over the intervention after adjustment for changes in fat
mass (FM) and fat free mass (FFM).
2. Comparing measured REE with REE predicted from the group-specific
equations developed using regression analysis of baseline data (see
details below).
3. Comparing measured REE with REE predicted from the reference
equation published by Muller et al.39
It has been suggested32 that the most appropriate analysis uses the
study-specific regression equation derived from baseline data (REE, body
composition, age, sex). As such, linear regression analyses were performed
to develop prediction equations for REE from baseline data (group
allocation, age, FM, FFM). Whereas age did not significantly explain any of
the variance in REE, group allocation accounted for a significant proportion
of variance in REE. Consequently, a separate equation was derived for CON
and INT:

Given the relatively small, homogeneous sample in the present study, it
could be argued that the resulting prediction equation may not be
robust.35 To overcome this potential weakness, REE was also predicted
from the equation developed by Muller et al.39 on a larger, phenotypically
similar cohort (body mass index 430 kgm − 2; N = 278); where female = 0,

These equations were used to predict REE at baseline, and after 4, 8, 12 and
16 weeks of ER for the CON and INT groups separately. Changes in REE
from baseline for measured and predicted values were then compared.
Statistical analyses
All analyses were performed using the STATA statistical software package
Version 14.2 (Statacorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA). Data are reported as
mean ± standard deviation (s.d.) unless otherwise specified. Mixed model
repeated measures analyses were employed to determine changes in
outcome variables from baseline, and differences between the CON and
INT groups accounting for covariates (FM, FFM, age) where appropriate.
Linear regression analyses were used to examine relationships between
REE and body composition. Differences were considered significant where
Po0.05.
Data are reported for all randomised participants via intention-to-treat
(ITT)
analysis
using
the
Last-Observation-Carried-Forward
method,
whereby the last available measurement for each participant at the time
point prior to withdrawal from the study is retained for each missing time
point thereafter in the analysis. The ITT analyses include every participant
who was randomised according to randomised treatment assignment,
ignoring level of compliance, protocol deviations and withdrawals.40
Consequently, the estimate of treatment effect from ITT analyses is
generally conservative. As some participants dropped out during the
baseline phase without participating in the ER interventions, analyses are
also provided for the sub-samples of all participants who completed the
baseline phase (CON = 23; INT = 24), and those who completed Week 16 of
ER (CON = 22; INT = 19). In this way, we are able to report on the effect of
the interventions with the maximum sample at the end of each stage of
the study as reported in the CONSORT diagram.
To examine the efficacy of the two interventions, analyses were
provided for the cohort of participants who completed Week 16 of ER
per protocol (CON = 19; INT = 17). Finally, as not all participants were
available at the 6-month follow-up, analyses are also provided for
participants who completed Week 16 of ER per protocol and were available
for measurements at the 8-week post-ER energy balance phase and
6-month follow-up (CON = 13; INT = 15).
The primary outcome variable for the study was weight loss, and the
secondary outcome was REE. Over 16 weeks of ER, the energy deficit
imposed by a 33% energy deficit would result in an estimated weight loss
of ~ 14 kg for a 110 kg male. However, we and others have found, in well-
controlled medium-length (12–24 weeks) dietary restriction interventions,
that weight loss is 60–70% of what is predicted from the ER imposed.9–11
As such, the expected weight loss during continuous ER would be ~ 9 kg.
We tested the hypothesis that weight loss would be greater (higher loss
per unit ER) with intermittent vs continuous ER, in part because of
attenuation of adaptive thermogenesis (smaller reduction in REE) in
response to intermittent ER.
Accounting for the expected variance in starting weight, we calculated
that 34 participants (17 per group) would be required, at a statistical power
of 0.8 (α = 0.05), to detect (two-tailed) a ~ 5 kg greater weight loss from ER
without adaptive thermogenesis (INT: 14 kg) compared with weight loss
during continuous ER inducing thermogenic compensation (CON: 9 kg).
It was uncertain a priori the degree to which adaptive thermogenesis
could be attenuated using the model of intermittent ER we employed.
Body
composition-adjusted
REE
has
been
shown
to
decrease
by
~ 400 kJ d − 1 within 2 weeks of commencing moderate ER, and larger
reductions have been reported in response to more severe and prolonged
ER.11,13,18,26,41 We, and others, have shown the decrease in body
composition-adjusted REE, even in response to severe ER, is completely
reversed after 10–14 days of reinstating an energy balance diet.11,20,41
Consequently, 18 participants (9 per group) would be required at a
statistical power of 0.8 (α = 0.05) to detect (two-tailed) a 400 kJ d − 1
reduction in body composition-adjusted REE compared with no change.
Given that REE was measured during ER for both groups, but the
magnitude of adaptive thermogenesis was predicted to be modified by
the 2-week blocks of energy balance in the INT intervention, we estimated
the effect would be potentially halved. To detect a difference of this
magnitude (~200 kJ d − 1), a cohort of 38 (19 per group) would be required
(two-tailed) at a statistical power of 0.8 (α = 0.05). Anticipating a 25% drop-
out during the intensive intervention, we planned to recruit 50 participants
(25 per group).
RESULTS
Baseline
The only variable in which the two groups differed at baseline was
REE, and only in the subset of participants who completed the
intervention, or who completed the intervention per protocol
(Table 1). This difference was largely accounted for by group
differences (non-significant) in FFM and FM in these reduced
cohorts (data not reported). As shown in Figure 1a, the change in
body weight over the 4-week baseline for the total group (n = 47)
was − 1.6 ± 1.4 kg (−1.4 ± 1.2%), and did not differ, on average,
between the CON and INT groups. For the 47 participants with
measures at the start and end of baseline, the change in REE was
− 138 ± 511 kJ d − 1 (−1 ± 6%). This change tended to be related to
weight loss (r = 0.26, P = 0.07). One participant lost 6.1 kg during
the baseline phase because of an error in the calculation of
prescribed
energy
intake.
Excluding
this
participant’s
data,
average changes in body weight (−1.5 ± 1.3 kg; − 1.3 ± 1.1%) and
in REE (−125 ± 511 kJ d − 1; − 1 ± 6%) were not related (r = 0.22,
P = 0.13).

 Intervention: pre vs post
Weight loss was significantly greater in the INT than CON group
for each analysis approach (Table 2). Specifically, weight loss over
the 16-week ER intervention in the INT group was 47% greater
than that in the CON group when considering data for all
participants randomised or who completed baseline, 58% greater
for those who completed the intervention, 53% greater for those
who completed the intervention per protocol, and 80% greater for
the cohort who were available for the 6-month follow-up.
There was a significantly greater average loss of FM in the INT
compared with CON group for those who completed the
intervention, those who completed the intervention per protocol,
and those who were available for follow-up (Po0.01 for each
analysis), and a tendency towards significance in the ITT analysis
(P = 0.09; Table 2). Changes in FFM were small, and not different
between groups in any analyses. The proportional changes of FM
and FFM did not differ between groups; FM comprised ~ 87 ± 21%
of the weight lost.
The reduction in absolute REE at completion of Wk16 ER did not
differ between groups, with average differences of 6 ± 6% (CON:
7 ± 6%; INT: 6 ± 5%) from end of baseline to Wk16ER. However,
given the marked difference in weight loss between groups, after
adjusting for changes in body composition, the reduction in REE
was significantly smaller in INT (4 ± 6%) than in CON (9 ± 6%), and
this was evident for both ITT and completers analyses (Table 2).
Intervention: time course of responses
The change in weight from the end of baseline was significant
throughout ER for both groups, and cumulative weight loss was
significantly greater in INT than CON from Wk8ER onwards
(Figure 1a). Importantly, the weight change during the 7 × 2-week
energy balance blocks in the INT group was, on average,
0.0 ± 0.3 kg
(Figure
1b).

shows
the
magnitude of weight loss for every 4 weeks of ER. FM was
significantly lower than baseline at each time point during the ER
intervention for the INT group, whereas the reduction plateaued
by Wk12ER in the CON group (Figure 2).
The INT group had a greater initial decrease in absolute REE
compared with CON (Figure 3a). However, the reduction in REE
was similar between groups at Wk16ER, despite the greater
reduction in body weight in INT. When adjusted for body
composition, REE in CON decreased progressively across the
intervention. In contrast, the initial decrease in REE in INT was
partly reversed during the final 4 weeks of ER, resulting in a
significantly lower reduction in REE than CON at Wk16ER
(Figure 3b). Using the prediction equations derived at baseline,
measured REE was significantly lower than predicted in CON at
Wk16ER (Figure 3c), but tended to be higher than predicted at
Wk16ER in INT (Figure 3d). Compared with REE predicted from the
equation of Muller et al.,37 the measured change in REE in the CON
group was similar to predicted REE at Wk4ER and Wk8ER, but
decreased to a greater extent than predicted from Wk12ER
onwards (Figure 3e). In contrast, measured change in REE in the
INT group was lower than predicted at Wk4ER but similar to
predicted thereafter (Figure 3f).
Intervention: 8-week post-weight loss energy balance and 6-month
follow-up
A subset of the cohort (CON = 13, INT = 15) was available for body
weight and composition measures during the 8-week post-weight
loss energy balance phase and at the 6-month free-living follow-
up. The weight change from the start of baseline to Wk16ER in this
subset (Figure 4a: CON: − 10.1 ± 3.7 kg; INT: − 15.4 ± 5.6 kg) was
similar to that in the larger cohort who completed the ER
intervention (Figure 1). Weight was stable in INT throughout the
8-week post-weight loss energy balance phase. Weight was also

 stable in the CON group for the first 2 weeks of this phase, with
subsequent small, but significant, increases of 0.6 ± 1.3 kg at Wk4
and 1.2 ± 2.1 kg at Wk8 (Weeks 20 and 24 in Figure 4a).
Weight regain over the 6-month post-intervention phase varied
between individuals. On average, both groups regained weight
over the 6-month follow-up (INT: 3.5 ± 5.9 vs CON: 5.9 ± 4.7 kg;
P = 0.24), but the total weight lost from the end of baseline
remained greater in the INT group at follow-up (INT: −11.1 ± 7.4 vs
CON: �3.0 ± 4.4 kg, P = 0.001). FM at the 6-month follow-up
remained significantly lower than baseline in INT, but was not
significantly different from baseline in CON (Figure 4b). The
changes in FM were 4.9 ± 3.9 and 2.9 ± 5.6 kg, and in FFM were
1.0 ± 1.9 and 0.6 ± 0.9 kg for CON and INT, respectively.
DISCUSSION
The aim of this investigation was to compare changes in body
weight, body composition, and REE in men with obesity in
response to: (1) 16 weeks of continuous ER, or (2) an equivalent
duration
and
magnitude
of
ER
delivered
intermittently
as
alternating 2-week blocks of ER and energy balance. In support
of the hypotheses, intermittent ER resulted in greater weight loss
and greater (or a tendency for greater) fat loss, without greater
loss of FFM, than an equivalent ‘dose’ of continuous ER. In
addition, despite greater weight loss, there was a significantly
smaller reduction in REE (adjusted for changes in FM and FFM) in
the INT than in the CON group, consistent with attenuation of
adaptive thermogenesis. Furthermore, although both groups
regained weight post-intervention, weight loss (reduction from
baseline) was, on average, 8.1 kg greater in the INT than CON
group at the 6-month follow-up.
The superior weight loss in the INT group in the present study is
in contrast with the majority of studies that have reported no
advantage of intermittent over continuous ER. The term ‘inter-
mittent energy restriction’ has become almost synonymous with
the term ‘intermittent fasting’, which consists of alternating 1- to
7-day periods of complete or partial food restriction (true or
modified fasting), and ad libitum food consumption.9 A recent
12-month clinical trial42 and several recent reviews9,43,44 have
concluded that existing models of intermittent ER (largely versions
of intermittent fasting), could be considered equivalent, but not
superior, alternatives for weight loss.
The
intermittent
approach
in
the
present
study
differs
fundamentally from intermittent fasting. In intermittent fasting
paradigms, weight loss occurs over time if energy intake during ad
libitum feeding periods is not sufficient to compensate for the
substantially reduced energy intake on ‘fasting’ days.45 In contrast,
energy intake was prescribed in both the ER and energy balance
blocks in the present study, to create distinct periods of weight
loss and maintenance. Given that this is the first application of an
intermittent model using 2:2-week blocks of ER and energy
balance, direct comparisons with other studies are not possible.
However, previous studies that have compared continuous ER
with intermittent approaches using ratios of ER to energy balance
of 5:5-weeks over 25 weeks46 or 1:1-week over 8 weeks47 have
reported no advantage of intermittent ER (although the energy
deficit in the latter study was not matched between groups). In
addition, weight loss was not different following 14 weeks of
continuous ER, and 14 weeks of ER interrupted by either a single
6-week break or 3 × 2-week breaks of ad libitum intake.48 Given
these findings, it is interesting to consider possible reasons for the
superior weight loss in the INT vs CON group in the present study,
in which both groups were exposed to the same ‘dose’ of ER.
Importantly, the average weight change (a proxy measure of
energy balance) during the seven energy balance blocks in the INT
group was only 0.0 ± 0.3 kg. Therefore, the greater weight loss in
the INT group can be attributed to a higher rate of weight loss
during the 8 × 2-week ER blocks, and not simply continual weight
loss over a longer (30-week) intervention period. Indeed, it is
possible that the attainment of energy balance during the ‘breaks’
from ER may be critical to the success of this approach. Allowing
relatively uncontrolled or ad libitum feeding during the ‘breaks’
from ER often results in a hyperphagic response which may
compromise weight loss.41,49 On the other hand, simply alternat-
ing
between
different
levels
of
energy
intake
(while
still
maintaining a degree of ER) during a dietary intervention appears
to be no more effective than using a continuous fixed level of
ER.50,51 As such, incorporating periods of controlled energy
balance, not simply variations in energy intake, may be necessary
to realise the beneficial effects of intermittent ER.

home (N = 20 except N = 19 for ER5, EB5, EB6, ER7 and EB7, and N = 17 for ER8). Weight change is calculated as the difference in weight
measured from Day 1 of one block (for example, ER1) to Day 1 of the subsequent block (for example, EB1). Participants were instructed to
record weight daily throughout the study. The majority (80% or 256/312) of measurements were taken on Day 1 of the block (as instructed),
and 93% (299/312) of measurements were taken within ± 1 day of Day 1.

 We hypothesised that intermittent ER would attenuate the
decrease in REE. In support of this hypothesis, REE (adjusted for
FM and FFM) decreased to a lesser extent in the INT group such
that it was ~ 377 kJ d − 1 lower in the CON than INT group at
Wk16ER. This is consistent with the 2-week blocks of energy
balance functioning as ‘metabolic rest periods’, attenuating the
compensatory reduction in REE associated with continuous ER.
There is scant evidence on changes in REE with intermittent ER9

 but these findings are broadly consistent with the work of Jebb
et al.41 who reported no change REE/kgFFM following an 18-week
intervention consisting of repeated cycles of 2 weeks of a very low
energy diet alternating with 4 weeks of ad libitum intake.
However, a continuous comparison group was not investigated
in that study, and participants regained weight during the ad
libitum periods such that the ~ 10.7 kg lost during ER periods was
reduced to 5.9 kg over the entire intervention. Importantly, in the
present study, the preservation of REE during ER in the INT group
was achieved without compromising weight loss.
Weight regain following successful weight loss through dietary
intervention is common, and for decades there has been a
concerted effort to find strategies to prevent recidivism.52 Follow-
up data were only available for a subsample in the present study,
although these participants did not differ appreciably from the
total cohort at baseline, nor in their magnitude of response to the
intervention. While both the CON and INT groups regained weight
over the 6-month follow-up, the smaller (albeit non-significantly
smaller) regain in the INT vs CON group resulted in a widening of
the difference in weight loss between groups from ~ 5 kg at
Wk16ER to ~ 8 kg at the 6-month follow-up. Indeed, weight at
follow-up was not significantly different from weight at the end of
baseline in the CON group (signifying almost complete weight
regain), whereas it remained significantly reduced relative to
baseline in the INT group. This suggests that the intermittent
approach employed in this study may have benefits over
continuous ER that extend beyond the period of active ER.

 overweight or obesity should aim to lose 5% of initial weight as
this can result in significant health benefits. To achieve this level of
weight loss it took, on average, 8 weeks of continuous, but only
4 weeks of intermittent ER. Furthermore, at the 6-month follow-up,
only the INT group had an average weight loss above this 5%
threshold.
A strength of this study was the tight control of dietary
prescription and food provision which ensured that the CON and
INT groups received the same ‘dose’ of ER by: (1) matching energy
deficit over the 16 weeks of restriction, and (2) achieving weight
stability in the intervening energy balance blocks in the INT group.
A further strength of this study is that it used the 2:2-week
intermittent model, which was designed based on empirical
evidence of the time course of adaptation to changes in energy
intake, as a framework to investigate the mechanisms underlying
any differences in weight loss between groups. In contrast, most
studies comparing intermittent and continuous ER have been
designed only to determine whether various forms of intermittent
ER produce superior weight loss. This study also has several
limitations. Firstly, as a very demanding study for participants,
there was some attrition (Supplementary Item 3). However, it did
not differ appreciably between groups, and was comparable to
other studies using intermittent ER.47,52,54 Furthermore, although
higher retention would have increased statistical power, we have
shown from completers and ITT analyses that the main findings
remained significant despite attrition. A second limitation was the
small weight loss in the 4-week baseline phase. We can only
speculate that the small weight loss was an acute response to
changes in diet composition. Despite this, we are confident that
our determination of energy requirements was robust for three
reasons: (1) weight stability was achieved in the INT group during
the seven energy balance blocks; (2) weight change over the 4-
week baseline phase in the combined cohort was lower than has
been reported in other free-living studies where energy require-
ments were calculated from published REE equations;55 and (3)
weight change in the last 2 weeks of baseline was comparable to
that reported in a recent study in which participants were

Weight and body composition in the subsample (CON: N = 13, INT: N = 15) of participants with data at all the following time points:
baseline, during and end of energy restriction (ER), during and after 8 weeks of energy balance immediately post-ER-intervention, and follow-
up 6 months later. (a) Weight loss (kg; mean ± s.e.m.). Significant difference between groups * Po0.05, ** Po0.01, *** Po0.001. Different
letters indicate significant differences between time points within each group (Po0.05; CON: α,β,χ,δ,ε; INT: a,b,c,d,e). (b) Changes in FFM and
FM (kg; mean ± s.e.m.). # FM significantly different from baseline in CON; * FM significantly different from baseline in INT (Po0.05). Note:
N = 13 for CON, except N = 12 for Wk1 and Wk2 of EB (Weeks 17 and 18) and N = 15 for INT, except N = 14 for Wk1, 2, 4 and 8 of EB (Weeks 17,
18, 20 and 24).

 determined from metabolic chamber measurements.56 A third
limitation was that we did not measure REE and body composition
during energy balance blocks in the INT group. We are currently
undertaking a follow-up study (Australian New Zealand Clinical
Trials
Registry
ref:
ACTRN12615000116527)
including
these
measurements in both ER and energy balance blocks to provide
more detailed information about the effects of repeated cycles of
ER and energy balance. While not a limitation, it is also important
to acknowledge that we cannot determine from the present data
whether 2 weeks is the optimal duration for ER and energy
balance blocks, only that this intervention resulted in more
effective weight loss than continuous ER. Indeed, it may be useful
to investigate different durations and ratios of ER to energy
balance, given the recent findings of Muller et al.,26 suggesting
adaptive thermogenesis may be completely manifest within just
one week of ER.
In conclusion, intermittent ER, delivered as alternating 2-week
blocks of ER and energy balance, resulted in greater weight loss
(fat loss) without greater loss of FFM, attenuation of the reduction
in REE, and superior weight loss retention after 6 months,
compared with an equivalent ‘dose’ of continuous ER. While
adaptive reductions in REE were attenuated using this 2:2
intermittent ER approach, it is possible that greater weight loss
in the INT group may also be due to reduced compensation in
other energetic functions such as the thermic effect of food and
activity energy expenditure. Additionally, there is the need to
investigate the effectiveness of this dietary approach when
individuals are not provided meals in a tightly controlled
metabolic study. Therefore, while additional work is needed to
further investigate the mechanistic bases for this novel inter-
mittent approach, these findings provide preliminary support for
the model as a superior alternative to continuous ER.
