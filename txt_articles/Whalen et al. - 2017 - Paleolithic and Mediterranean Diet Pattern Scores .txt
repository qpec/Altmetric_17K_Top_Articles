Abstract
Background: Poor diet quality is associated with a higher risk of many chronic diseases that are among the leading causes
of death in the United States. It has been hypothesized that evolutionary discordance may account for some of the higher
incidence and mortality from these diseases.
Objective: We investigated associations of 2 diet pattern scores, the Paleolithic and the Mediterranean, with all-cause and
cause-specific mortality in the REGARDS (REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) study, a longitudinal
cohort of black and white men and women $45 y of age.
Methods: Participants completed questionnaires, including a Block food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ), at baseline and
were contacted every 6 mo to determine their health status. Of the analytic cohort (n = 21,423), a total of 2513 participants
died during a median follow-up of 6.25 y. We created diet scores from FFQ responses and assessed their associations
with mortality using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusting for major risk factors.
Results: For those in the highest relative to the lowest quintiles of the Paleolithic and Mediterranean diet scores, the
multivariable adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality were, respectively, 0.77 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.89; P-trend < 0.01) and 0.63
(95% CI: 0.54, 0.73; P-trend < 0.01). The corresponding HRs for all-cancer mortality were 0.72 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.95; P-trend = 0.03)
and 0.64 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.84; P-trend = 0.01), and for all-cardiovascular disease mortality they were 0.78 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.00;
P-trend = 0.06) and HR: 0.68 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.88; P-trend = 0.01).
Conclusions: Findings from this biracial prospective study suggest that diets closer to Paleolithic or Mediterranean diet
patterns may be inversely associated with all-cause and cause-specific mortality.

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease and cancer are the 2 leading causes of
death in the United States (1). Diet is strongly associated with
risk for these and other chronic diseases (2–4), and as reviewed
elsewhere (5–7), investigations into which dietary constituents
may be protective have led to several large studies of the effects
of various nutritional supplements hypothesized to lower risk of
cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mortality. These trials yielded
mostly null, or sometimes adverse, results. Given these findings,
nutritional supplements are not generally recommended for
preventing cardiovascular disease or cancer (5). There are several
potential explanations for the null results from supplementation
trials, including an inability of supplements to mimic the
complex composition and interacting components of whole
foods and diets (3, 8–10).
To assess the totality of diet rather than the influence of single
nutrients, foods, or other individual dietary constituents,
nutrition researchers have utilized dietary pattern analysis.
There are several methods for constructing or representing
dietary patterns for analysis, from agnostic data-driven
methods, to a priori methods in which food groups and
consumption patterns are characterized based on, for exam-
ple, published dietary quality indexes or current dietary
recommendations (3, 11, 12).

 A dietary pattern of growing interest is the Paleolithic diet
pattern. The consequences of the discrepancies between the diets
and lifestyles of Homo sapiens before the agricultural revolution
and those during the modern era is referred to as evolutionary
discordance, and has been proposed to account for some of the
dramatic increase in chronic disease in the past century (13). The
Paleolithic diet of preagricultural hunter-gatherer humans was
estimated from anthropological evidence from fossils and extant
hunter-gather groups (14). The diet pattern is characterized as a
predominantly plant food–based diet, with a wide diversity of
fruits, nuts, and vegetables, including wild-plant foods that
contained high amounts of calcium and other minerals (14). It
also includes lean meat, and is low in dairy, grains, sugar, and
salt. Although several clinical studies reported beneficial effects
of a Paleolithic-like diet on cardiovascular and other metabolic
risk biomarkers (15–21), few studies explored associations of a
Paleolithic diet pattern with chronic disease endpoints (22).
A more commonly studied dietary pattern with many
similarities to the Paleolithic diet is the Mediterranean diet
(17, 22–44). It has been strongly and consistently linked with
health benefits (45), especially in relation to cardiovascular
disease, in randomized controlled trials (46, 47) and observa-
tional studies (27–30, 44). These apparent health benefits make
the Mediterranean diet pattern a model with which to compare
the Paleolithic pattern. The many similarities between the
Mediterranean and Paleolithic diet patterns include a high
consumption of fruits, vegetables, and nuts and lower intake of
added sugar. However, the idealized Mediterranean diet pattern
includes grains and moderate amounts of alcohol and dairy
foods, whereas the Paleolithic diet includes none (27, 31, 46).
We previously reported similar inverse associations of the
Paleolithic and Mediterranean diet scores with incident colo-
rectal adenoma (22) and biomarkers of inflammation and
oxidative balance (48). Motivated partly by these results, and
by the growing popularity of the Paleolithic diet, we investigated
associations of both the Paleolithic diet score and the Mediter-
ranean diet score (as comparison) with all-cause and cause-
specific mortality endpoints in the REGARDS (REasons for
Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) study, a prospec-
tive cohort of 30,183 white and black adults predominantly
from the Southeastern United States.
Methods
Study population and data collection. The study design and
recruitment for REGARDS was described previously (49–53). Briefly,
REGARDS is a prospective cohort study designed to investigate the
causes of racial and geographic disparities in stroke. The national cohort
(from all lower 48 US states) was assembled by using stratified random
sampling with oversampling from the US ‘‘stroke belt’’ (North Carolina,
South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana)
and so that there would be equal representation by sex and by white or
black ancestry. From January 2003 to October 2007, 30,183 individuals
$45 y of age were enrolled. Of these participants, 8547 did not complete
the FFQ at baseline, and an additional 213 were lost to follow-up and
excluded from the present analyses, leaving an analytic cohort of 21,423
individuals. The institutional review boards of all participating institu-
tions approved the study methods, and all participants gave written,
informed consent at the time of enrollment.
Computer-assisted telephone interviews were conducted to collect
demographic and medical history information, followed 3–4 wk later
by an in-home visit during which study staff conducted medical
assessments, including anthropometry. At the in-home visit, self-
administered questionnaires, including a Block 98 FFQ that included
109 food and beverage items to assess habitual consumption over the
past year (54–56), were provided for participants to complete and return
by mail.
Assessment of exposures. The Paleolithic and Mediterranean diet
pattern scores were constructed in a similar manner as described
previously (22). Briefly, by using the habitual food-consumption infor-
mation obtained at baseline, each study participant was assigned a
quintile rank (a score from 1 to 5) based on the sex-specific distribution
of intake for each food group included in the score. As shown in
Supplemental Table 1, generally, more points were assigned for higher
intakes of foods considered characteristic of a diet pattern, and fewer
points were assigned for higher intakes of foods considered uncharac-
teristic of that pattern. For the Mediterranean diet this scheme was
modified in relation to dairy, grain and starch, and alcohol intakes as
noted in Supplemental Table 1. For the Paleolithic diet score 2 unique
variables were created. The first, a fruit and vegetable diversity score,
was created by summing the total number of responses on the fruit and
vegetable sections of the FFQ that indicated that the participant ate >1–3
servings of a given food item per month. More diversity was considered
desirable. Second, because the Paleolithic diet had little dairy but high
amounts of calcium (from wild plant foods) (14), to consider dietary
calcium separately from dairy products we used the residuals of a linear
regression of total (i.e., dietary plus supplemental) calcium on total dairy
intake to represent calcium intake independent of dairy consumption.
The points for each of the food groups composing a diet score were then
summed, so that the final Paleolithic diet score (14 components) could
range from 14 to 70, whereas the Mediterranean diet score (11
components) could range from 11 to 55.
Cohort follow-up. Study staff contacted cohort participants by
telephone every 6 mo to ascertain any stroke events or deaths. If a
death occurred, the death certificate and any associated medical records
for the 28-d period before death were collected. Identifiers of partici-
pants who could not be contacted, and thus considered lost to follow-up,
were sent to the social security death index and/or the National Death
Index to identify deaths in this subpopulation.
Causes of death. Cause of death was adjudicated by a committee of
physicians using information from death certificates, hospital records,
and proxy interviews (57). We defined cardiovascular disease mortality
as death from a myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, heart
failure, pulmonary embolism, other cardiac causes of death, and
noncardiac but other cardiovascular disease deaths. We defined cancer
mortality as death attributed to any type of cancer. We also created a
category that included all other noninjury or accidental deaths, most of
which were caused by respiratory illness, infection, liver disease, or
kidney failure.
Statistical analysis. The characteristics of the study population at
baseline, by quintile of each diet pattern score, were summarized and
compared by using chi-square tests for categorical variables and ANOVA
for continuous variables that were normally distributed, or the Kruskal-
Wallis nonparametric test for continuous variables that were not.
Correlation between the 2 scores was calculated with a Spearman
correlation coefficient. HRs and 95% CIs for mortality were estimated
with Cox proportional hazards regression models, with participants� age
as the underlying time scale (the results calculated by using time in the
study after adjusting for age were similar to those using age as the
underlying time scale). We tested each exposure and potential covariate
for the proportional hazards assumption using Log-Log Kaplan-Meier
curves, goodness-of-fit tests, and extended Cox models.
Based on previous literature and biological plausibility, potential
confounding variables considered included sex, race, smoking, BMI (in
kg/m2), waist circumference, regular aspirin use, regular other nonste-
roidal anti-inflammatory drug use, hormone replacement therapy use (in
women), physical activity, income, health insurance coverage, region of
residence in the United States, rural or urban classification, personal history
of one or more major comorbidities such as cancer or diabetes,
education, self-reported health, vitamin or mineral supplement use,
total energy intake, and physical activity, all measured at baseline. The
Paleolithic and Mediterranean diets and mortality

 criteria for inclusion in the final models included biological plausibility
and/or whether inclusion or exclusion of the variable, singly or jointly with
other covariates, from the model changed the adjusted HRs for the
primary exposure variable by $10%. The final, multivariable-adjusted
model controlled for sex, race (black or white), total energy intake
(kilocalories per day, continuous), BMI [categorized by WHO criteria (58)
into underweight, normal, overweight, and obese], physical activity (0, 1–3,
or $4 exercise sessions on average/wk), smoking (current, former, and never),
annual income (refused, <$20,000, $20,000–$34,000, $35,000–$74,000,
and $$75,000), and hormone replacement therapy use (in women).
To assess potential effect modification by various risk factors, selected
based on biological plausibility, separate analyses for all-cause mortality
were conducted within categories of race (white or black), sex (male or
female), age (#65 or >65 y), self-reported health at baseline (poor, fair or
good, very good, excellent), BMI (underweight and normal or overweight
and obese), time since start of follow-up (#6.25 or >6.25 y), smoking
status (never, former, or current), and region of United States (Southern
United States or Western, Midwestern, and Eastern United States).
We conducted several analyses to assess the sensitivity of the
observed associations to variations in score definition and other
considerations. We removed and replaced each individual component
one at time from each a priori score to determine whether any one
component overly influenced the observed associations. Diet scores were
also constructed with the use of the medians rather than the quintiles of
the distributions of the components, by using an alternative construction
of the fat ratio variable (monounsaturated + polyunsaturated:saturated
fats) in the Mediterranean diet score, and by using sex- and race-specific
cutoffs of food group consumption to create the final scores. We
examined associations excluding BMI from the models because it could
be considered both a confounder and a mediator of the association of
diet with mortality. Finally, we excluded deaths that occurred during the
first 1–3 y of follow-up and excluded participants with comorbidities at
baseline to assess the potential influence of premorbid health conditions
on diet reporting. We conducted all analyses using SAS statistical
software (SAS version 9.3; SAS Statistical Institute). Two-sided tests were
considered statistically significant if P # 0.05.
Results
Selected characteristics of the participants by diet score quintiles
are presented in Table 1. Compared with those in the lowest
quintile of the Paleolithic diet score, those in the highest quintile
were, on average, older, and were more likely to be female,
white, obese, and a nonsmoker; to exercise more frequently,
regularly take aspirin, have a higher annual income, have health
insurance, and have been previously diagnosed with cancer or
diabetes; and if a woman, to be more likely to currently take
hormone replacement therapy. In addition, reported total energy
consumption was lower for those in the lowest quintile of the
Paleolithic diet score than for those in the highest quintile. The
distribution of baseline characteristics across Mediterranean
diet score quintiles was similar to that of the Paleolithic diet
score, except that age and total energy intakes were more similar
across quintiles of the Mediterranean diet score, the proportion
of men and women in each quintile was similar, and those in the
upper quintile were less likely to reside in the Southern United
States or to have previously been diagnosed with cancer or
diabetes. The Paleolithic diet scores ranged from 21 to 65 (range
of possible scores: 14–70), whereas the Mediterranean diet
scores ranged from 14 to 50 (range of possible scores: 11–55).
These ranges did not differ appreciably by sex or race, and the 2
scores were moderately correlated (r = 0.64, P < 0.01). The
concordance of quintile rankings for each diet score is shown in
Supplemental Table 2, and the study specific semiquantita-
tive score components� quintile cutoffs and mean values are
presented in Supplemental Table 3.
During the 11 y of follow-up (median: 6.25 y), 2513
participants died. Adjusting only for age, sex, race, and total
energy intake, there were statistically significant trends for
decreasing risk for all-cause mortality with increasing Paleolithic
and Mediterranean diet scores. Among those in the upper
relative to those in the lowest quintiles of the Paleolithic and
Mediterranean diet scores, risk was statistically significantly
41% (HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.67) and 51% (HR: 0.49;
95% CI: 0.42, 0.56) lower, respectively (Table 2). After
additional adjustment for potential confounders, particularly
smoking status, the association of each score with all-cause
mortality was somewhat attenuated [to 23% (HR: 0.77;
95% CI: 0.67, 0.89) and 36% (HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.74)
lower risk for those in the upper relative to the lowest quintiles
of the Paleolithic and Mediterranean diet scores, respectively],
but the point estimates for the extreme quintile comparisons and
the tests for trend remained statistically significant. For each diet
score, the findings for cardiovascular-specific, cancer-specific,
and other noninjury or accident mortality were similar to those
for all-cause mortality.
The associations of the Paleolithic diet score with all-cause
mortality stratified by various participant characteristics at
baseline are summarized in Figure 1. The associations comparing
those in the upper with those in the lowest quintile differed
minimally across the various strata. One exception was that
among never or former smokers the score was inversely
associated with mortality, but directly associated among
current smokers. Although the test for multiplicative interac-
tion for this finding was statistically significant (P = 0.04), the
95% CIs for the point estimates for the strata of current
smokers included 1.0.
The associations of the Mediterranean diet score with all-cause
mortality according to selected participant characteristics are sum-
marized in Figure 2. The findings for those in the highest relative to
those in the lowest quintile differed minimally across the various
strata except that the inverse association tended to be stronger
among men than among women (P-interaction = 0.10). Associations
of both diet scores with all-cause and select cause–specific mortality
across race were similar (Supplemental Tables 4 and 5).
In sensitivity analyses, removal of individual score compo-
nents one at a time did not materially alter the results. However,
for the Paleolithic diet score, removal of the nuts and the red and
processed meats components attenuated the observed associa-
tions for all-cause mortality for those in the fifth relative to those
in the first quintile by 15.6% and 14.3%, respectively, to
HR: 0.89 (95% CI: 0.77, 1.02; P-trend = 0.04) and HR: 0.88
(95% CI: 0.76, 1.02; P-trend < 0.01), respectively. Removal of
nuts and red and processed meats from the Mediterranean diet
score also attenuated the observed associations, but more
modestly, by 8.6% and 4.5%, respectively (Supplemental Tables
6 and 7). Modifying the construction of the scores by using 2
rather than 5 categories for each component, by using sex- and
race-specific quintile cutoffs, or for the Mediterranean diet by
using an alternative fat ratio variable did not materially alter the
associations. Finally, excluding persons with chronic diseases at
baseline, removing BMI from the models, or excluding those
who died during the first 1–3 y of follow-up did not materially
affect the associations.
Discussion
Our results suggest that diets that are more Paleolithic- or
Mediterranean-like may be associated with a lower risk of all-cause,
614
Whalen et al.

 cardiovascular-specific, cancer-specific, and other noninjury or
accident-specific mortality, although the observed inverse asso-
ciations were slightly stronger for the Mediterranean diet pattern.
To our knowledge, the current study is the first investigation of an
association of a Paleolithic diet pattern with all-cause or cause-
specific mortality.
The Paleolithic and Mediterranean diets may reduce the risk
of chronic disease mortality by several potential mechanisms.
The foods that characterize both diets, including high intakes of
fruits, vegetables, fish, and nuts, are associated with lower
inflammation and less oxidative stress, biochemical processes
that are associated with cardiovascular disease and cancer (45,
59). Also, the Paleolithic and Mediterranean diets, relative to the
Western diet (60), feature more low energy–dense foods, thereby
facilitating a healthier energy balance. Indeed, in previous pilot
trials it was found that participants on a Paleolithic-like diet
relative to a standard diet reported greater satiety (61) and had a
greater release of anorectic gut hormone (21). Adiposity is
associated with higher systemic inflammation and oxidative
stress and may influence chronic disease risk by other, indepen-
dent mechanisms (62, 63). To address this, in the present study,
we included BMI in the models for our primary analyses as a
potential confounder but also excluded it in our sensitivity
analyses because it could also be a mediator of the associations.
Inclusion or exclusion of BMI from the models had no material
impact on the estimated associations, suggesting that the
possible effects of the Paleolithic and Mediterranean diets on
chronic disease mortality may indeed include mechanisms
beyond improving energy balance, such as reducing inflamma-
tion and improving oxidative balance.
There have been few reported studies on the health effects of
following a Paleolithic diet pattern. Reported studies include 7
small pilot trials and one slightly larger, long-term weight-loss
trial (15–19, 21). Most of the pilot trials examined the effects of

 the diet on cardiovascular and glycemic control biomarkers,
including glycated hemoglobin, plasma insulin, and serum
lipids as well as on satiety; in general, all reported improved
values and effects (15–22), although only 4 of the trials had a
control group. A larger study (n = 70) of the effects of a
Paleolithic diet on long-term weight loss in postmenopausal
women found statistically significant weight loss at 6 mo
relative to those in the control group, but this difference
became attenuated and was no longer statistically significant
after 24 mo (20).
The Mediterranean diet has been associated with lower
mortality (64), mainly through lower risk of cardiovascular
disease (30, 46, 47, 61, 65–69) and possibly cancer (40, 70).
There have been several trials of a Mediterranean diet to
improve health and prevent cardiovascular disease. The Lyon
Diet Heart study (47) randomly assigned 605 free-living
individuals who previously had a recent myocardial infarction
to receive either dietary advice to follow a Mediterranean-type
diet or standard care, which included the general recommenda-
tion to follow a ‘‘prudent diet’’ for the secondary prevention of
myocardial infarction. After a mean follow-up of 46 mo, 58
recurrent nonfatal and fatal cardiac events occurred—14 in the
Mediterranean diet group and 44 in the control group (RR: 0.28;
95% CI: 0.15, 0.53) (47). Also, a second, larger trial (n = 7447)
of the Mediterranean diet for cardiovascular disease primary
prevention in at-risk individuals, PREDIMED (Prevenci´
on con
Dieta Mediterr´
anea), found reduced cardiovascular disease risk
in the 2 study intervention arms, which included following a
Mediterranean diet and supplying participants with either nuts
(83 events; HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.96) or olive oil (96 events;
HR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.92), relative to the control arm (46).
The results of the current study support these earlier trial results.
Given the well-known inverse association of moderate alcohol
consumption with cardiovascular disease and total mortality
(71), one might expect alcohol consumption to contribute to our
finding of a slightly stronger inverse association of cardio-
vascular disease mortality with the Mediterranean diet than
with the Paleolithic; however, when we removed alcohol
from the Mediterranean diet score, it did not change the HRs
appreciably.
We found no substantial differences in associations of the diet
patterns with all-cause mortality within subgroups of partici-
pants except for an estimated direct Paleolithic diet score–
mortality association among current smokers. However, this
latter finding was not statistically significant, although the test
for multiplicative interaction was, and there were multiple
comparisons and few smokers in the upper quintile of the diet,
and any possible biological plausibility is unclear, suggesting
that it resulted from chance.
Although our findings support our hypothesis that multiple
aspects of diet, via multiple mechanisms, collectively affect
risk for chronic disease–related mortality more strongly than
does any single aspect of diet, we do note that we found that
higher consumption of nuts and lower consumption of lower
red and processed meats more strongly contributed to the
inverse associations of the scores—especially the Paleolithic

Paleolithic and Mediterranean diets and mortality

 diet score—with mortality than did other individual compo-
nents of the scores. Higher nut and lower red and processed
meat consumptions have both been associated with lower
mortality (72–75), possibly via their contributions to intakes
of a healthier balance of FAs. Further exploration of Paleo-
lithic diet components and their relation to each other as well
as to the overall score is needed.
This study has several strengths and limitations. Strengths
include that it is the first investigation of associations of a
Paleolithic-like diet pattern with all-cause or cause-specific
mortality, its prospective design, the diverse study population,
and the rigorous ascertainment of causes of death (57). The
Paleolithic and Mediterranean diet pattern scores were con-
structed by using similar methods so that differences in the
observed diet-mortality associations between the 2 diets would
be attributable to differences in what was included in each score
and how components common to both scores were weighted
rather than to the score-construction methods. Limitations
include the potential for residual confounding from insuffi-
ciently characterized or unmeasured aspects of a healthy lifestyle
and that the results may not be generalizable to the entire US
population (76). In addition, because we used relative scoring
rather than absolute cutoffs, few participants� diets were likely
to have been strongly concordant with either diet pattern
(i.e., few people were eating a true Mediterranean or Paleolithic
diet), likely resulting in underestimating the potential of the diets
for reducing risk for chronic disease mortality. Although using
self-reported FFQs in prospective cohort studies is well
established, and the commonly used Block FFQ was used in
the REGARDS cohort to assess various diet-outcome associ-
ations (49, 77, 78), FFQs have known limitations, such as
reliance on participant memory and generally, as in our study,
are not specifically designed to probe adherence to a particular
diet pattern. In addition, FFQs contain a limited number of
specific food items, limited differentiation of food types
(e.g., fat content of meat, types of nuts and oils), limited
ability to capture food growing or grazing conditions, and
limited information on food cooking methods. Finally, while
cause-specific mortality is subject to competing risks, all-cause
mortality is not, and the consistency of our findings across
types of mortality outcomes lends support to the validity of the
cause-specific associations.
In conclusion, our findings, taken together with those from
previous studies, suggest that diets that are more Paleolithic- or
Mediterranean-like may be associated with lower risk of all-
cause, cardiovascular-specific, cancer-specific, and other nonin-
jury or accident-specific mortality.
