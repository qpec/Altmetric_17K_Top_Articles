 ABSTRACT
Background
There are mixed findings on the relationship between ADHD and younger relative age in class. This
study examines whether relative age is associated with ADHD diagnosis in a country where treatment
prevalence rates are low and whether any such association has changed over time or relates to
comorbid disorders.
Methods
Using nationwide population-based registers, all Finnish children born between 1991 and 2004 who
were diagnosed with ADHD from age 7 years onwards (school starting age), between 1998 and 2011,
were identified (n=6136). Incidence ratios (IRs) were used to examine the inter-relationships between
relative age, actual age at ADHD diagnosis, and year of diagnosis (1998-2003 vs. 2004-2011).
Findings
The cumulative incidence of ADHD diagnosis was greatest for younger children within the school-
year - IRs of 1.26 (boys) and 1.31 (girls). The association between relative age and ADHD diagnosis
reflected children diagnosed before the age of 10 years. The strength of this association increased
during recent years – for 2004-2011, IRs were 1.37 (95% CI 1.24,1.53) for May-August and 1.64
(95% CI 1.48,1.81) for September-December compared with January-April births (oldest). The
relative age effect was not explained by comorbid disorders.
Interpretation
In a health service system with low prescribing rates for ADHD, younger relative age is associated
with an increased likelihood of receiving a clinical diagnosis of ADHD. This influence has increased
in recent years. Teachers, parents and clinicians should take relative age into account when
considering the possibility of ADHD in a child or encountering a child with a pre-existing diagnosis.

 INTRODUCTION
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterised by behavioural symptoms
involving hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention that are inappropriate for the child’s
developmental level and result in functional impairment.1 Epidemiological studies suggest that
prevalence rates world-wide are fairly uniform, affecting around 5% of school-aged children,
however, there is considerable international variation in rates of clinical diagnosis and treatment.2-5
Although this might partially reflect the availability of and access to services, the perceptions and
expectations of adults such as teachers and parents also play a role in the awareness and recognition
of possible ADHD.6 As part of the clinical assessment, information about symptoms and impairment
is gathered from these adults and, for school-aged children, their responses may reflect peer
referencing against the developmental expectations and abilities of other children within the same
class or school-year. However, many countries have a fixed school starting age and date, resulting in
a variation of up to 12 months in age between children within the same school-year. In many countries
(such as the UK or US), the school starting age is typically the academic year in which the child turns
five or six, when ADHD may still be difficult to diagnose. Although immaturity may impact on school
readiness at a young age, by the age of 7 years there are likely to be increasing teacher and parent
expectations that children are more able to settle and focus at school.
Over a decade ago, findings from the large nationally representative British Child and Adolescent
Mental Health Survey (B-CAMHS) highlighted relative age as a risk factor for child mental health
problems (Goodman, 2003).7 More recently, there has been increasing interest in the contributory
role of young relative age within the school-year towards the diagnosis of ADHD. This work is
important because of the potential implications for diagnostic practice and educational advice and
policies. In particular, epidemiological studies from countries, such as the United States, Canada,
 Iceland and Israel, where prescribing rates for ADHD are relatively high have shown a relative age
effect whereby younger children in a school year are more likely to be diagnosed with and treated for
ADHD than their peers in the same school year.8-11 These findings have led to concern that ADHD
might be over-diagnosed or misdiagnosed in these countries.12,13 In contrast, there are mixed findings
from large-scale studies from Nordic countries (such as Denmark and Sweden) and Taiwan where
the prevalence rates of ADHD treatment in children are lower.14-17 Hence, it is possible that a relative
age effect may partially be an artefact of national patterns in the recognition and treatment of ADHD.
There is also a suggestion of changes over time. Although some studies have not found a consistent
year-trend pattern,9,17 a Danish study suggested changes in the strength of association over time with
a relative age effect that was present between 2000-2004 subsequently disappearing and then
becoming reversed,15 perhaps reflecting an increased awareness amongst parents, teachers and
clinicians about the possibility of mislabeling. A particular gap in previous research is that the
potential contributory role of common comorbid disorders such as conduct disorder or oppositional
defiant disorder (CD/ODD) and specific learning (developmental) disorders (LD) has not been
investigated.
We aimed to examine whether a relative age effect exists within a national context traditionally
involving low rates of ADHD diagnosis and treatment and, if so, whether this has changed over time.
Within the Nordic countries, Finland has the lowest prevalence rates of medication prescribing for
ADHD.18 This suggests that ADHD diagnosis might be relatively conservative (although clinician
and family treatment preferences also influence prescribing decisions).3 Using a large population-
based birth cohort in Finland, the present study adds to previous research by investigating ADHD
diagnoses made over a 14-year period (1998-2011) to examine whether there is an association
between relative age and ADHD and, if so, whether: a) it operates more strongly at the younger end
of the school age-range; b) there is a temporal effect and c) comorbid disorders play a role. Based on
 findings from previous research,7,9,11,15-17 we hypothesised that any relative age effect would operate
more strongly at younger ages and that there would be a relative age effect in the earlier but not the
later study time period.
METHODS
Case identification and registers
The source population reflects all singleton live births in Finland between 1st January 1991 and 31st
December 2004 (n=870,695). From this sample, the cases were people registered in the Finnish
Hospital Discharge Register (FHDR) with a diagnosis of ADHD (International Classification of
Diseases (ICD-10) codes: F90.0, F90.1, F90.8 and F90.9) by 31st December, 2011. In Finland,
primary school enrollment begins during the calendar year in which a child turns 7 years of age, with
the school year starting in mid-August. Therefore, the eldest in a school-year are born in January and
the youngest in December (aged 7 years and 7 months; 6 years and 7 months, respectively) i.e. relative
age reflects the child’s age within their school-year. Given the aim of investigating the influence of
relative age after starting school, children diagnosed with ADHD from the age of seven years onwards
were included in the study. After excluding children (n=13) with severe or profound mental
retardation, this resulted in a total sample of 6136 children with ADHD. The mean age at ADHD
diagnosis in the sample was 9.4 years (standard deviation: 2.4; range: 7-19 years).
The study utilised two Finnish Nationwide registers, the FHDR and the Population Register Centre
(PRC). The FHDR includes all medical diagnoses given in hospitals in Finland, including inpatient
diagnosis from 1969 and outpatient coverage of specialised hospital services since 1998. In Finland,
the diagnosis of ADHD is made in outpatient clinics by a specialist and children’s healthcare services
are available free of charge. The FHDR was used to identify cases with ADHD, the date the register-
 based ADHD diagnosis was given and whether they have been diagnosed with comorbid CD/ODD
or LD (see below). The validity of the diagnosis of ADHD in the FHDR has been demonstrated.19
The Finnish healthcare system uses the ICD-10 classification as the prevailing diagnostic system,
which refers to the term ‘hyperkinetic disorder’, but for convenience in this article we refer to it as
‘ADHD’. The term ‘ADHD’ for ‘hyperkinetic disorder’ has also been used in previous Nordic
studies that use the ICD classification.16,20,21 The PRC is a digital national archive containing basic
information on Finnish citizens and permanent residents. Individual data filed in the register contains,
for
example,
name,
personal
identity
code,
citizenship,
date
of
birth/death
and
emigration/immigration (as noted above, both the source population and ADHD cases were children
born in Finland). The PRC was used to identify the number of children born in each birth month
during the study period. Permission to use data from the national registers was obtained from the data
protection authorities and ethical approval for this research was provided by the Ethics Committee of
Hospital District of Southwest Finland.
Comorbid disorders
Initially, all ADHD cases were analysed regardless of comorbidity (see below). Following this, to
assess the possible contribution of comorbid disorders, the cases were stratified according to the
presence of: a) any lifetime comorbid CD/ODD (ICD codes: F90.1, F91, F92) and b) comorbid LD
(ICD codes F80–F83, reflecting specific developmental disorders of speech and language, scholastic
skills and/or motor function) if diagnosed before age 7 years – this was done to minimise the
possibility of ADHD being conflated with LD (i.e. key adults are already aware of the existing LD
diagnosis when considering the possibility of comorbid ADHD).
Statistical analyses
Cumulative incidence
 Cumulative incidence and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of ADHD were
estimated with a Poisson-regression model, assuming a Poisson error distribution. Initially, the
cumulative incidence in the total sample, and separately for boys and girls, of ADHD/1000 births was
calculated for each month of birth and also by blocks of four months i.e. January-April, May-August
and September-December. The numerator was the number of ADHD cases born in a specific time
period and the denominator the total number of children born during the corresponding time frame.
Next, to assess whether a possible relative age effect was a function of the presence of a comorbid
disorder, the cumulative incidence was estimated for cases with and without comorbid CD/ODD and
comorbid LD.
Incidence ratios (IRs)
First, IRs of ADHD were estimated, separately for boys and girls, for each birth month compared
with births in January. Second, to improve the precision of these estimates and better reflect the way
in which adults might conceptualise children within a school year (i.e. as one of the eldest or one of
the youngest in the class) the IRs among births in the different four-month periods (May-August,
September-December) were estimated compared with births in January-April (eldest group). Third,
to examine whether any relative age effect was influenced by actual age at diagnosis (with a greater
effect at the younger end of the school age-range) or by a temporal pattern, the sample was stratified
by ADHD diagnoses made between 1998-2003 and 2004-2011 (these cut-offs reflecting findings
from the literature).7,15 Within each strata, based on the median age at diagnosis (9 years), the age of
ADHD diagnosis was categorised as diagnosed: a) between 7-9 years of age or b) from age 10
onwards. The IRs of ADHD were estimated, comparing the youngest and middle groups, by relative
age, with those born during January-April. Children diagnosed between 1998 and 2003, aged 7-9
years at diagnosis were born between 1991-1996 while those aged 10 years or older were born
between 1991-1993. Similarly, children diagnosed between 2004 and 2011, aged 7-9 years were born
between 1994-2004 and those aged 10 years or older were born between 1991-2001.
 A number of sensitivity analyses were also conducted:
1) As the main analyses restricted the sample to those diagnosed with ADHD from the age of 7 years
onwards (potentially missing the very youngest starters), we also included children diagnosed with
ADHD from the age of 6 years and 7 months onwards (youngest school-starting age) to assess the
impact on the IRs for each birth month.
2) To address the possibility that later-born children, through being followed up for less time
(Supplementary Table 1), might have influenced the findings, we restricted the sample to those born
between 1991 and 2001 to ensure that everyone was followed up for a uniform period of time (three
years i.e. until their 10th birthday).
3) To address the possibility that the approach to investigating the impact of comorbid LD was too
restrictive, by only including children diagnosed with an LD before age 7 years, we repeated this
analysis after including all children with a lifetime LD diagnosis (i.e. regardless of the age of
diagnosis).
Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software (Version 9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the ADHD IRs per 1000 births for each birth month among boys and girls. Compared
with births in January (reference category), the IRs for ADHD diagnosis among those born later in
the year were generally higher. Among boys, the IRs increased from 1.19-fold (95% CI: 1.04,1.37;
p=0.014) for those born in July to 1.45-fold (95% CI: 1.26,1.66; p<0.0001) for births in November.
Among girls, increased IRs were observed among those born in the last three months i.e. October to
December. The highest IR (1.59, 95% CI: 1.15,2.17; p=0.0050) was among girls born in October.
Figure 1 provides a visual presentation of the cumulative incidence of ADHD among boys and girls
born in each month.
 Table 1 and Figure 1 about here
Table 2 shows the IRs of ADHD among births in different birth periods (January-April, May-August,
September-December). Among boys born between September to December, the IR increased 1.26-
fold (95% CI: 1.18,1.35; p<0.0001) compared with those born during January to April. The
corresponding IR among girls was 1.31 (95% CI: 1.12,1.54; p=0.0070).
Table 2 about here
Table 3 shows that, amongst children who received a diagnosis of ADHD between the ages of 7-9
years, there was an effect of relative age. In contrast, there was no increase in IR among children
diagnosed at a later age (10 years or older). This effect was seen in both cohorts of year of ADHD
diagnosis (1998-2003 and 2004-2011) and, contrary to the hypothesised direction, the relative age
effect was more prominent among those diagnosed from 2004 onwards compared with those
diagnosed in the earlier time period (1998-2003).
Table 3 about here
In terms of the sensitivity analyses, when expanding the sample to include children diagnosed from
age 6 years and 7 months onwards (Supplementary Table 2) and also when restricting the sample to
enable a uniform period of 3 years follow-up, the pattern of findings was similar. In the latter analyses,
compared with the main findings reported in Table 1, there was an increase in the magnitude of the
incidence ratios (Supplementary Table 3).
Comorbid Disorders
Figure 2 (and Supplementary Table 4) show the cumulative incidence of ADHD by birth month
among children with and without a comorbid CD/ODD. Among boys who did not have a comorbid
 CD/ODD, there was a pattern of an increased cumulative incidence of ADHD diagnosis amongst
those born later in the year (with the highest proportion observed among those born in November).
Among boys with comorbid CD/ODD (27% of boys), the cumulative incidence of ADHD was
greatest for those born between September and December, peaking among births in November i.e. a
relative age effect was observed regardless of whether comorbid CD/ODD was present. For girls,
small numbers limit conclusions. The cumulative incidence among children with and without LD is
shown in Figure 3 (and Supplementary Table 5). The highest cumulative incidence of ADHD was
seen among boys without LD, peaking among births in November. For both boys with LD, and for
girls, small numbers limit conclusions. The sensitivity analysis including all children with a lifetime
LD diagnosis shows that, for boys, there is a relative age effect regardless of whether comorbid LD
was present (Supplementary Table 6). For girls, small numbers limit conclusions with no consistent
evidence of a relative age effect. Collectively, these findings suggest that any observed relative age
effect was not explained by whether comorbid CD/ODD or LD was present.

DISCUSSION
The findings from this study contribute to the literature by demonstrating an association between
younger relative age and the diagnosis of ADHD within a national healthcare context where
prescribing rates for ADHD are low compared with other Western countries as well as the
epidemiological prevalence of ADHD.3 Although this study confirms a relative age effect, there have
been mixed findings from other countries with low prescribing rates.14-17 It is possible that this
discrepancy reflects our specific focus on the receipt of ADHD diagnosis whereas studies from
 Nordic countries which did not find a consistent relative age effect used medication data as the ADHD
outcome.14,15 In both boys and girls, we found a greater cumulative incidence of clinically diagnosed
ADHD amongst younger children within the school-year. There appeared to be a dose-response
relationship in that, compared with January-April births, the strength of association with relative age
was greater, in turn, for children born during May-August and September-December. As
hypothesised, we demonstrated that the relative age effect was influenced by actual child age,
particularly affecting the youngest children (aged 7-9 years) in this sample. This suggests that relative
age has a greater impact on clinical diagnosis at younger school-attending ages and might be
interpreted as a marker of neuro-developmental immaturity. Contrary to our hypothesis and previous
research which focused on medication data as the ADHD outcome,15 our findings also revealed a
temporal pattern with the strength of the association involving relative age increasing in the more
recent time period under study. This research spans a 14-year time period during which,
internationally, the awareness and clinical recognition of ADHD has increased considerably.3,4
The observed relative age effect was specific to ADHD and was not influenced by the presence of
comorbid disorders (CD/ODD or LD) i.e. the association was not an artefact of whether these
comorbid disorders were present. Where there was a comorbid LD diagnosis at a young age, although
conclusions are limited by small numbers, it is possible that key adults take this into account when
considering the possibility of ADHD. Furthermore, when lifetime comorbid LD was considered, the
observed relative age effect (in boys) was not influenced by comorbidity. The finding that there was
a relative age effect influencing ADHD diagnosis regardless of whether CD/ODD was present
contrasts with comorbidity effects highlighted in previous aetiological research using data from this
register which, for example, has demonstrated a stronger association with prenatal maternal smoking
among children with ADHD and comorbid CD/ODD.21
 Methodologically, this study has a number of significant strengths. First, the use of a population-
based register enabled a focus on the receipt of a diagnosis of ADHD rather than relying on
prescription data. Some previous studies10,11,14 only utilised medication prescription data and not all
children who receive a diagnosis of ADHD are prescribed medication because of family or clinician
preferences. Second, the nationwide coverage of the two registers enabled a nationally representative
study involving a large sample size in a country where healthcare is free at the point of delivery with
no regional differences or socio-economic barriers in terms of access to and availability of publicly
funded healthcare and education services. Third, the study was able to assess temporal patterns in the
diagnosis of ADHD over a 14-year period. Fourth, in terms of the analyses, we were able to
investigate whether the presence of comorbid ODD/CD or LD influenced the findings. Fifth, the
sensitivity analyses highlighted that the findings from the main analyses were robust to a number of
assumptions and may have reflected an underestimate of the magnitude of the association.
Furthermore, as part of the month-by-month comparison of the cumulative incidence, the direct
comparison of December against January suggests that a season of birth explanation for the findings
is extremely unlikely.
The study also has some limitations. First, we did not have information on whether any relatively
young children were educationally held back a year and therefore potentially misclassified in the
analyses i.e. although actually the oldest in their year group, they would be misclassified as being one
of the youngest. However, this possibility of exposure misclassification may have reduced the ability
of this study to demonstrate a relative age effect. The possibility of some flexibility in school-starting
dates might explain why the IRs for December-born children (the relatively youngest) were slightly
lower than those for children born in October and November. Second, by relying on clinical diagnosis
of ADHD as our main outcome measure, this study is unable to disentangle the extent to which
relative age is a risk factor for having ADHD, regardless of whether it is clinically recognised.
 However, findings from a recent study indicate that parent ratings of relative immaturity compared
with peers are associated with ADHD symptoms.22 Third, the study relied on register-recorded
diagnoses of ADHD and although the FHDR reflects children referred to publicly-funded specialised
services which are free at the point of access and captures most children who receive a diagnosis of
ADHD, it misses those who were diagnosed in private practice.
Teachers are important adults in considering the possibility that a child might have ADHD,23 having
initial discussions with parents and facilitating the referral of children to services. With a relative age
effect, it is possible that the youngest in the class are more likely to get referred and, conversely, older
children in the class with possible ADHD might get missed. Once referred, the next consideration is
whether the child meets criteria for ADHD. However, we do not know the extent to which actual
neuro-developmental immaturity, regardless of relative age, plays a role in the clinical diagnostic
decision-making process. Alternatively, given an age variation of up to 12 months, misattributions
by adults of immaturity relative to older children in the same class could be paramount. Although this
study is unable to distinguish possible mechanisms underlying the findings, reflecting actual neuro-
developmental immaturity in the child or the misattribution of immaturity by adults, there is more
support for the latter possibility as the strength of the association with relative age has increased in
recent years. If a relative age effect contributes to a referral and diagnostic bias, it could be speculated
that a clinical and education service system that does not account for this may contribute to false
positive diagnoses, especially as younger children in the class are also more likely to be at an
educational disadvantage,10,24 which may be misinterpreted as ADHD-related academic impairment.
Conclusions and Implications
 These findings extend previous research by demonstrating a relative age effect influencing ADHD
diagnosis in a country with relatively low prescribing rates for ADHD (0.64% in 7-15 year olds,
2007)18 and also by highlighting that the strength of this association has increased in recent years.
The association is not contingent on the presence of comorbid CD/ODD or LD. In terms of clinical
and educational implications, these findings suggest that key adults (teachers and parents) might
interpret behaviour differently of children who are younger than their class-mates. When clinicians
ask parents or teachers to provide information about ADHD symptoms or impairment, the informant
should be asked to keep the child’s relative age in mind. Clinicians who are conducting ADHD
assessments or who are treating young people with a pre-existing childhood diagnosis of ADHD
should also be mindful of, and perhaps consider recording, the person’s relative age in relation to
their country’s school-starting age and cut-off date. Within classrooms, teachers might consider
seating arrangements or composition of small groups that reflect the child’s relative age. From a wider
education perspective, it is important that a range of options are available and that there is flexibility
within the system so that an individualised approach can be offered based on the child’s needs and
the resources available to the school and family. Depending on what might be best for the individual
child, these might include, for example, behavioural approaches through key adults to assist with
school readiness and classroom behaviour or offering the possibility of flexibility around school-
starting dates. However, it may not be straightforward to implement these approaches in practice and
evidence for effectiveness is required - the possible benefits or harms associated with different
intervention approaches are important research questions which ideally require testing through RCT
methodologies and the consideration of a range of outcomes, including educational and wider mental
health outcomes.
