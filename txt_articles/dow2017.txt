Background: Tafenoquine is a new drug for malaria prevention. The goal of the present work was to
conduct a specific neurobehavioral study in rats with histopathological assessment of the brain.
Methods: The clinical, hematological, behavioral, motor activity, and neurohistopathologic changes
induced by different dose levels of tafenoquine were evaluated following single super-therapeutic dose
administration. Toxicokinetic data were generated to allow extrapolation to clinical exposures.
Results: At the highest dose (500 mg/kg), two animals (of 12) died. Surviving animals showed clinical
signs of toxicity and had reduced body weight 7e8 days after dosing. Decreases in motor activity were
observed on more than one occasion at doses > 9-fold higher than the clinical exposure. No statistically
significant changes were observed for other behavioral endpoints. No neurohistopathological changes
were noted. Changes in hematological and clinical pathology endpoints were observed at the lowest dose
level (125 mg/kg). For context, the human dosing regimen is a 10 mg/kg load followed by 3.3 mg/kg
weekly (in a 60 kg person).
Conclusions: As in humans, adverse events other than neurotoxicity were dose-limiting for tafenoquine
in rats. This raises the prospect that a new weekly prophylactic, without neurologic liability, may become
available in the near future.

1. Introduction
Tafenoquine is an 8-aminoquinoline analog of primaquine in
late stage development for various malaria indications by Glax-
oSmithKline, Medicines for Malaria Venture, the U.S. Army and 60
Degrees Pharmaceuticals (60P). The conferment of breakthrough
therapy designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [1]
suggests that substantial public health benefits may accrue if
tafenoquine is approved by regulators.
The long half-life of tafenoquine allows for more convenient
dosing regimens. The anticipated clinical dose of tafenoquine will
be 200 mg/day for three days (total of 10 mg/kg over three days in a
60 kg person) followed by 200 mg maintenance doses thereafter
(3.3 mg/kg weekly in a 60 kg person [2]). In the context of travel
medicine, tafenoquine would become the only available once
weekly regimen useful for malaria prevention in areas of the world
with chloroquine or mefloquine-resistant malaria. It would also
provide travel medicine practitioners the option of being able to
prescribe a chemoprophylactic agent with a weekly dosing
regimen, but without the neuropsychiatric adverse event profile
associated with mefloquine [3]. In some jurisdictions, concerns
regarding the neuropsychiatric effects of mefloquine have resulted
in very restrictive prescribing rules and there is concern that in the
future this drug may not be available for special populations [4].
Dow et al. [5] reported that mefloquine, the weekly prophylactic
antimalarial for which tafenoquine could be an alternative, induced
degeneration of brain stem nuclei and neurobehavioral changes at
threshold doses with exposure levels relevant to human dosing in
female rats. The general methodology employed in that study is

 required by regulators as a component of the core non-clinical
safety battery included in regulatory filings [6]. Recently, 60P, as
one of the commercial sponsors of tafenoquine, updated its non-
clinical dossier by conducting a specific neurobehavioral study in
rats with histopathological assessment of the brain. The results of
this work is reported herein.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. MTD rat study
With the goal of identifying the maximum tolerated dose,
groups of 5 male and 5 female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were
administered a single oral dose of 0 (vehicle), 125, 250, 400 or
700 mg/kg tafenoquine succinate (dose expressed as free base) in
1%/0.4% methylcellulose/Tween 80 in water, at a dose volume of
10 mL/kg [Note the 400 mg/kg dose group was administered an
actual dose of 506 mg/kg due to a higher concentration dose
formulation being prepared whereas all other groups were within
12% of nominal dose]. The day of dosing was designated Day 1.
Animals were observed for 7 days following dosing.
Animal viability checks and physical observations were made
daily, body weights were recorded pre-dose and twice during the
study, and clinical pathology parameters were assessed on Day 7.
Following Day 7 assessments animals were euthanized without
further examination, although any animals dying earlier than the
scheduled end of study were grossly examined at necropsy. The
dose formulation for each group was analyzed to confirm the
absence (control) or actual concentration of tafenoquine.
2.2. Neurobehavioral, histopathologic and toxicokinetic study
Based on the rat maximum tolerated dose study results, three
groups of 12 male and 12 female SD rats were dosed once orally
with 125, 250 or 500 mg/kg tafenoquine succinate (dose expressed
as free base). The highest dose was anticipated to be the maximum
tolerated dose. The lower doses were selected because they exceed
therapeutic doses, were well tolerated in the maximum tolerated
dose study, and allowed dose response to be explored. A group of 9
male and 9 female SD rats were dosed concurrently with vehicle i.e.
1%/0.4% methylcellulose/Tween 80 in distilled water.
Six rats of each sex in the control and tafenoquine-treated
groups were used to assess neurobehavioral effects following
dosing while the remaining 3/sex in the control group and 6/sex in
the tafenoquine-treated groups were included in the toxicokinetic
investigations. Blood samples (~0.5 mL) were collected from
tafenoquine-treated toxicokinetic group animals (3/sex/group/time
point) at 1, 3, 5, 8, 24, 48, 72 and 168 h after dosing. Blood was
collected 8 h post dosing in control animals. Blood was placed in to
K2EDTA anticoagulant tubes and stored on wet ice prior to plasma
separation
by
centrifugation.
Plasma
was
stored
frozen
at
approximately �80 �C (±10 �C) within 2 h of collection until
analysis. Plasma was analyzed by high performance liquid chro-
matography with mass spectrometric detection.
All dose formulations were analysed to confirm absence (con-
trol) or concentration of tafenoquine and the homogeneity of
mixtures. Daily viability checks were performed morning and
evening along with general clinical observations prior to dosing
and at least twice following dosing on all animals along with body
weights pre-dose and on the day of necropsy. A functional obser-
vation battery (FOB) [7] was performed on neurobehavioral group
animals by trained observers with no prior knowledge of treat-
ment, pre-dosing (Day �1) and at 0.5, 3, 6, 24 and 48 h after dosing.
After the FOB, pretest and at 6, 24 and 48 h post dosing, horizontal
and vertical motor activity was monitored for 60 min (divided in to
12, 5 min intervals) using an automated motor monitor system.
Animals from the neurobehavioral groups were necropsied on
Day 4 and 8 (3/sex/time point), i.e. 72 h and 168 h after dosing,
respectively. Animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium
pentobarbital before whole body perfusion via the ascending aorta
with ~100 mL of saline followed by ~500 mL of 0.1 M phosphate
buffer (pH 7.4 ± 0.1) containing 4% paraformaldehyde. The brain
remained in situ and the carcass was refrigerated for 3e6 h, then
the heads removed and post-fixed for 24e48 h with neutral buff-
ered formalin before removal of the brain from the skull and stor-
age in the same fixative as needed until processing.
All fixed brain tissues were processed to paraffin blocks. Rat
brains were gross-trimmed according to the guide provided in
Bolon et al for the ‘best practice’ approach to neuropathologic
assessment in developmental neurotoxicity [8]. Since the gracile
and cuneate (and potentially other brainstem) nuclei were targets
for mefloquine [5], depending on the amount of tissue after the 8th
slice as depicted in the Bolon et al recommendation, a 9th slice was
taken caudal to the 8th slice and placed face down in the block. Two
sections were taken from the blocks at each of levels 1 to 7 and
stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and Bielschowsky's
silver stain. The 8th and 9th (if present) blocks were step sectioned,
first taking 4 serial sections on separate slides (2 stained with H&E
and Bielschowsky's stain, the remaining 2 as spares) and then
microtoming 50 mm deeper to take another 2 sections for H&E and
Bielschowsky's staining.
H&E and silver-stained sections from control and high-dose rats
were evaluated by a board certified pathologist with knowledge of
dose groups. The study protocol called for blinded examination of
all tissues in all dose groups if differences were noted between the
high and vehicle-dosed groups.
3. Results
3.1. Maximum tolerated dose study
The dose formulation analysis confirmed the actual dose con-
centrations were within 12% of target concentration except for the
400 mg/kg dose group, where the formulation was 126% higher
than the nominal solution concentration of 40 mg/mL thus
achieving a dose of 506 mg/kg as opposed to 400 mg/kg (Note the
results for this group are referred to by the nominal dose of 400 mg/
kg). This was not considered to have adversely affected the aim of
the study.
Clinical
and
physiological
changes
following
single
dose
administration of tafenoquine are summarized in Table 1. One male
died on Day 6 following the single oral administration of 700 mg/kg
on Day 1. Clinical signs following the single administration of
tafenoquine were whole body pallor (all animals at �400 mg/kg),
dark or dull bilateral eyes at �400 mg/kg and thin appearance (2
females), staining on head (abnormal red color, in 1 female) and
rales (1 female) at 700 mg/kg. No clinical signs were noted at 125 or
250 mg/kg. Dose related statistically significant decreases in body
weight was seen at all doses in males, and at 700 mg/kg in females.
Food consumption was decreased at 400 and 700 mg/kg in males
and females compared to pretest baseline values. One male rat
dosed with 700 mg/kg was found dead on Day 6 and had gross
pathology of enlarged liver, small right testis and thymus with dark
areas.
The main clinical pathology changes included decreases in red
blood cell (RBC) parameters, increase in neutrophils as well as in-
creases in liver enzymes, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and
aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The decreases in red blood cell
mass (hemoglobin, hematocrit, and RBC count) at all doses in fe-
males were associated with a regenerative response (increased

29
 reticulocytes). The increases in AST and ALT activities at � 400 mg/
kg were considered adverse due to their larger magnitudes of
change. The majority of other changes were noted at the higher
doses of 400 and 700 mg/kg and included decreased lymphocytes
in males at 400 and 700 mg/kg and females at 700 mg/kg, increased
large unstained cells in males at 400 and 700 mg/kg, increased
monocytes in males at 700 mg/kg, increased blood urea nitrogen in
both sexes at 700 mg/kg, decreased cholesterol in males at 700 mg/
kg, and decreased total protein and albumin. Other than the liver
enzyme changes, all changes, were considered non-adverse due to
their relatively small magnitudes.
In summary, the nominal dose of 400 mg/kg (achieved 506 mg/
kg) was associated with moderate toxicities. At 700 mg/kg, similar
clinical signs were noted as in the 400 mg/kg group with additional
findings of change in breathing pattern, thin appearance and dark/
dull eyes as well as death in one of 5 males on Day 6. The dose of
700 mg/kg was considered to exceed the maximum tolerated dose.
At single doses of 125 and 250 mg/kg, there were no adverse
clinical signs, minimal effects on body weight, and small changes
on red blood cell parameters.
3.2. Functional observational battery, motor activity, histology and
toxicokinetic assessments
All dose formulations were homogeneous mixtures and within
±8% of the nominal concentrations of 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/mL. The
control formulation showed absence of tafenoquine.
Two animals (one male TK animal and one female main study
animal) were found dead on Day 7 or 8 following dosing with
500 mg/kg and showed no gross tissue pathology at necropsy.
Clinical signs following a single administration of tafenoquine at
500 mg/kg were piloerection, decreased fecal pellets, hunched
appearance, irregular breathing, and red staining on head on Days 7
and/or 8. At 500 mg/kg, there were decreases in body weights in
males (�18%) and females (�16%) at termination on Day 8 when
compared to the control group. The FOB performed pretest, 0.5, 3, 6,
24 and 48 h post-dose showed no significant tafenoquine-related
findings relative to control rats of either gender. This is illustrated
in Table 2 where the main FOB parameters are summarized for
male rats at pretest, 24 and 48 h time points. The earlier time points
and female rats showed similar results (data are not presented).
Motor activity was reduced at 24 h after dosing, for at least one
5 min interval during the 1 h observation period, in males dosed
with 500 mg/kg and females dosed with 250 or 500 mg/kg,
although changes only reached statistical significance in females
(data not shown). At 48 h after dosing, motor activity was
decreased in males at all doses and females dosed with 250 or
500 mg/kg (Figs. 1 and 2). The effect was more pronounced at 48 h
at 500 mg/kg and in male animals with a greater number of
observation intervals showing a significant change (Figs. 1 and 2).

 There were no drug-related findings in the brain sections of
animals dosed with 500 mg/kg tafenoquine compared to control
rats. H&E sections showed no evidence of neurodegeneration or
other morphological abnormalities, and axon morphology as
demonstrated by Bielschowsky silver stain was comparable be-
tween tafenoquine-treated and control animals. The gracile nu-
cleus, cited by Dow et al. [5] as a potential target for toxicity, was
identified in at least one sectioned level from all animals and
showed no abnormalities.
Tafenoquine was measurable in all the plasma samples collected
from tafenoquine dosed animals but in none of the control animal
samples (Cmax data summarised in Table 3).
4. Discussion
Here we report that tafenoquine at doses up to the minimum
lethal dose (500 mg/kg single dose) in adult rats did not exhibit any
dose-related histopathological changes in the brain. A Good
Manufacturing Practice batch of tafenoquine, synthesized using the
intended commercial process, was utilized in the studies. Both
studies were conducted at a global toxicology house and the neu-
robehavioral study was conducted under Good Laboratory Practice
conditions. The methodology used was broadly similar to that used
previously to demonstrate histopathological changes due to mef-
loquine in the central nervous systems of rats, and was consistent
with regulatory guidance's for conducting such studies. Our data
suggest that tafenoquine does not cause histopathological changes
in the central nervous system of the rat.
In adult rats, there were no statistically significant changes in
any functional endpoints other than on motor activity. There was a
general dose-related decrease in motor activity at later (24 and
48 h) time points. A dose-related decrease in weight loss was also
observed in the behavioral study and the maximum tolerated dose
study. In fact, the main adverse effects noted in the maximum
tolerated dose study were dose-related reductions in red blood cell
parameters, and increases in liver enzymes with threshold doses as

125 mg/kg; 3 M, 250 mg/kg; 4 M, 500 mg/kg. An a, b, or c on the graphs indicates the mean value of the 125, 250 or 500 mg/kg is statistically different from the mean value of the
vehicle control group.

 low as 125 mg/kg. Collectively, these data suggest that clinical
pathology-related adverse events should be dose-limiting upon
translation into man.
The adverse events commonly seen in clinical trials involving
tafenoquine have predominantly related to gastrointestinal dis-
turbances, reversible vortex keratopathy (corneal deposits; sec-
ondary to phospholipidosis), and hematologic changes particularly
in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency [2,9,10].
Gastrointestinal disturbance is the dose-limiting toxicity in in-
dividuals who are G6PD-normal while hemolytic toxicity is the
dose-limiting toxicity in G6PD deficiency [2,9,10]. Keratopathy had
no effect on vision acuity and fully resolved within 6e12 months
[2].
In summary, our data suggest that in rats, super-therapeutic
doses of tafenoquine appear to be free of neurologic toxicity, in
contrast
to
some
other
antimalarials,
including
mefloquine.
Furthermore, as with clinical studies, adverse events other than
neurologic toxicity are dose limiting in rats dosed with tafenoquine.
