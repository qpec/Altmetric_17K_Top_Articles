severe dengue disease in humans

For dengue viruses 1 to 4 (DENV1-4), a specific range of antibody titer has been shown
to enhance viral replication in vitro and severe disease in animal models. Although
suspected, such antibody-dependent enhancement of severe disease has not been
shown to occur in humans. Using multiple statistical approaches to study a long-term
pediatric cohort in Nicaragua, we show that risk of severe dengue disease is highest
within a narrow range of preexisting anti-DENV antibody titers. By contrast, we observe
protection from all symptomatic dengue disease at high antibody titers. Thus, immune
correlates of severe dengue must be evaluated separately from correlates of protection
against symptomatic disease. These results have implications for studies of dengue
pathogenesis and for vaccine development, because enhancement, not just lack of
protection, is of concern.
D
engueviruses1 to4(DENV1-4)aremosquito-
borne flaviviruses that cause 50 to 100
million cases of dengue fever (DF) and
~500,000 hospitalizations annually (1, 2).
Dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock
syndrome (DHF/DSS) is the most severe form
of dengue disease and is characterized by vas-
cularleakage, hemorrhagicmanifestations, throm-
bocytopenia, and hypotensive shock, which can
lead to organ failure and death (3). Heterotypic
secondary DENV infection (with a DENV type
distinct from the primary infecting type) is the
greatest risk factor for DHF/DSS (4, 5). Age,
interval between infections, antibody charac-
teristics, viral factors, and host-specific genet-
ics are contributing factors (4–6). The theory of
antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) posits
that at a specific concentration, heterotypic anti-
bodies bind but do not neutralize virions of the
subsequent infecting DENV type. These virus-
immune complexes are recognized by Fcg recep-
tors that facilitate virus entry and replication
in target immune cells. This initiates an immune
cascade that results in vascular leak and severe
dengue disease (5, 7). In vitro and in animal
models, a peak enhancement titer (i.e., a specific
concentration of antibodies that most efficiently
enhances DENV infection) has been observed. By
contrast, higher antibody concentrations effec-
tively neutralize virions, whereas lower concen-
trations poorly enhance infection (8, 9).
However, there is no conclusive evidence in
humans of a peak enhancement titer asso-
ciated with the greatest risk of severe dengue
disease. In a recent phase 3 clinical trial, young
dengue vaccine recipients had elevated risk
of dengue hospitalization >1 year after vacci-
nation compared with placebo controls (10),
raising concerns, but not confirming, that vac-
cination of DENV-naïve individuals induced
poorly neutralizing anti-DENV antibodies that
increased the risk of severe dengue disease (11).
Further, the unexpected number of DHF/DSS
cases in 6- to 12-month-old infants, when mater-
nal derived–antibodies have decayed below
neutralizing levels (12–18), is consistent with
the concept of a peak enhancement titer for
DHF/DSS. However, attempts to relate in vitro
peak enhancement titer to disease severity in
infants or older children have been inconclusive
(13, 15, 17–19).
We directly studied the relationship be-
tween preexisting anti-DENV binding anti-
bodies (DENV-Abs) and dengue disease severity
in a large, well-characterized pediatric cohort
study in Managua, Nicaragua (20, 21). From
August 2004 to April 2016, 8002 children aged
2 to 14 years were enrolled; 6684 children had
at least one DENV-Ab titer measurement and
were included in our study (41,302 samples in
total) (fig. S1 and table S1). DENV-Ab titers
were measured with the inhibition enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) and es-
timated as the geometric mean of replicate
titrations (quality control and reproducibility
data in figs. S2 and S3) (22). In the iELISA,
serially diluted serum antibodies compete with
DENV-specific peroxidase-conjugated immu-
noglobulin G for binding to a balanced mix-
ture of DENV1-4 antigens (21). The iELISA
measures antibodies binding cross-reactive epi-
topes, such as the fusion loop in the envelope
protein as well as the prM protein (table S2), that
induce ADE in vitro and in vivo (8, 9, 23). For
comparison, iELISA titers are reliably (Pearson’s
correlation r = 80) a twofold dilution higher
than hemagglutination inhibition assay titers
(24) and are correlated {Pearson’s r = 0.80
[95% confidence interval (CI): 0.77 to 0.83]}
with the geometric mean of neutralizing anti-
body titers to DENV1-4 (figs. S4 and S5 and
table S3). As per the cohort protocol, children
who became febrile visited the study health
center, and those meeting the case definition
for dengue or presenting with undifferenti-
ated febrile illness were tested for dengue
using molecular and serological diagnostic
methods; those who developed warning signs
for severe dengue disease were referred to the
study hospital (618 dengue cases studied in
total) (table S4) (20). Disease severity was ini-
tially classified using 1997 World Health Orga-
nization (WHO) criteria for DF and DHF/DSS
(table S5) (3).
We first compared individuals with differ-
ent levels of preexisting DENV-Ab titers (binned
by fourfold serum dilution) to DENV-naïve
individuals using a Cox proportional hazards
model (25) adjusted for sex, epidemic season,
age, and number of previous infections. Hazard
ratio estimates of DHF/DSS across the range
of DENV-Ab titers resembled the canonical
ADE curve obtained in vitro (Figs. 1 and 2 and
table S6) (21). The hazard of DHF/DSS was sim-
ilar in children with no (DENV-naïve) or high
(>1:1280) DENV-Ab titers. However, in chil-
dren with preexisting DENV-Ab levels of 1:21
to 1:80, the hazard of DHF/DSS was 7.64-fold
higher [95% CI: 3.19 to 18.28] (Fig. 1A). These
effects remained significant when adjusted for
age or number of previous infections (fig. S6)
and when analyzed with alternative DENV-Ab
titer binning methods or sampling of indi-
vidual iELISA titer measurements (figs. S7 to
S9). During the 12 years of the cohort studied,
a child with preexisting DENV-Ab titers of 1:21
to 1:80 had a cumulative hazard of 11.4% for
DHF/DSS. This is nearly twice as high as for a
child with a prior DENV infection but low
DENV-Ab titers (<1:21) who had a cumulative
hazard of 6.6% of developing DHF/DSS (Fig.
1B). For DENV-naïve children and children with
high DENV-Ab titers (>1:1280), the cumulative
hazard was 1.6 and 1.5%, respectively, indicat-
ing that high antibody levels did not provide
any greater protection against DHF/DSS than
having no preexisting DENV-Abs. On aver-
age, in the Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study,
the DENV-Ab half-life was 4.00 years [95%
CI: 3.81 to 4.20], and by 3 years postinfection,
an estimated 22% of children had DENV-Ab
titers of 1:21 to 1:80 (table S7). Children with
subsequent severe dengue cases had lower
but not more rapidly decaying DENV-Ab titers
(table S8).
In 2009, WHO revised the classification
guidelines for severe dengue to improve clinical
management of dengue patients and to capture
other complications. The 2009 guidelines replace
the category of DHF/DSS with “Dengue with
Warning Signs” (Dengue+Warning Signs) and

 “Severe Dengue” (table S5) (2). We evaluated
whether there is also a peak enhancement
titer for Dengue+Warning Signs/Severe Dengue.
Again, we observed that the highest hazard
ratio, 1.75 [95% CI: 1.11 to 2.74], occurred among
children with DENV-Ab titers of 1:21 to 1:80
(Fig. 1, C and D, and table S9). In children with
higher antibody levels (1:321 to 1:1280 and
>1:1280), the hazard ratios of Dengue+Warning
Signs/Severe Dengue were less than those for
DENV-naïve children, indicating that a pro-
tective effect against Dengue+Warning Signs/
Severe Dengue is also dependent on antibody
titer. We also estimated hazard ratios for hospi-
talization admissions with dengue. Similarly,
a peak enhancement titer was observed at
DENV-Ab titers of 1:21 to 1:80, with protection
observed at higher titers (Fig. 1, E and F, table
S10; previous infections–only model, P < 0.05,
fig. S6).
Hence, the magnitude of the observed enhance-
ment effect related to how specific the definition
of severe dengue disease was to the classical patho-
physiological classification of DHF/DSS (26, 27).
When we relaxed the case definition criteria fur-
ther and modeled the hazard of having any den-
gue case, we did not observe a peak enhancement
titer: Children with a prior DENV infection and
DENV-Ab titers <1:21 or 1:21 to 1:80 had compara-
ble hazard ratios of dengue to DENV-naïve chil-
dren (Fig. 1, G and H, and table S11). However, a
protective effect was evident at DENV-Ab titers
above 1:320.
Continuous hazard ratio curves for DHF/DSS
rise and fall symmetrically around a peak haz-
ard ratio of 5.95 [95% CI: 1.86 to 19.06], which
occurred at a DENV-Ab titer of 1:34 (Fig. 2A)
(28). When we controlled for prior DENV in-
fection, children with DENV-Ab titers below

 this peak enhancement titer still had a lower
hazard of DHF/DSS than those at the peak
enhancement titer (Fig. 2B and fig. S10). Haz-
ard ratio curves modeled on the basis of the
WHO 2009 guidelines of Dengue+Warning
Signs/Severe Dengue and hospitalization also
peaked at 1:30, although the magnitude of the
effect was smaller than for the DHF/DSS clas-
sification; again, protection was seen at higher
DENV-Ab titers (Fig. 2, A and B).
To further test whether preexisting DENV-Ab
levels explained our observations of a peak en-
hancement titer, we compared severe secondary
dengue cases, each with five matched controls
drawn randomly from the cohort. Controls were
matched to cases by sex, age, and evidence of
prior DENV infection but had not experienced
dengue in the epidemic season of the case. Con-
ditional logistic regression was used to compare
the preexisting DENV-Ab titers of the severe
cases with those of matched controls having
titers >1:320. Again, a peak enhancement titer
was observed at DENV-Ab titers of 1:21 to 1:80,
with reduced odds ratios observed at lower and
higher DENV-Ab titers (Fig. 3A and figs. S11
and S12), and the strongest enhancement ef-
fect was seen for the DHF/DSS classification
(Fig. 3, A to C; titer distributions in Fig. 3, D
to F). By contrast, when nonsevere secondary
cases were compared to their own matched con-
trols, no peak enhancement titer was observed
(Fig. 3, A to C). We also observed the same peak
enhancement titers when we directly compared
severe to nonsevere dengue cases according to
preinfection DENV-Ab titers, using logistic re-
gression and accounting for known covariates
(Fig. 4 and tables S12 to S14).
Thus, we have established that antibody titer
does predict enhancement of severe dengue dis-
ease in humans. This association is seen most
strongly for DHF/DSS, which is defined by the
pathophysiological entity of DENV-induced vas-
cular leak. By contrast, the 2009 WHO criteria,
which are intentionally broader than DHF/DSS
as they are meant improve triage and case man-
agement, encompass severe dengue cases caused
by mechanismsotherthanvascularleak syndrome.
The correlate of risk for DHF/DSS and severe
dengue disease (DENV-Ab titer 1:21 to 1:80) is
distinct from the correlate of protection (DENV-
Ab titers above 1:320) against symptomatic
dengue. To date, dengue vaccine manufacturers
have only been required to demonstrate induc-
tion of detectable neutralizing antibodies. With
recent evidence of possible vaccine-enhanced
dengue disease (10), this assumption is being
revisited. A vaccine that induces antibody titers
at or near the peak enhancement titer may
place vaccinated individuals at greater risk
of severe dengue than if they had never been
vaccinated (11). Further, immune correlates of
severe dengue need to be estimated separate-
ly from correlates of protection against any
dengue disease in vaccine trials and natural
infection studies, an observation that may
also be relevant to studies of Zika disease and
vaccines.
We show that the iELISA, a simpler assay
than neutralization tests (29, 30), is a tool for
detection of elevated risk of severe disease as
well as protection against symptomatic disease,
making it a promising alternative method for
measuring biologically predictive serological
responses. Further, the iELISA measures anti-
bodies targeting cross-reactive epitopes im-
plicated in ADE in vitro and in vivo (8, 9, 23).
The iELISA may directly measure the mecha-
nistic correlate of enhancement and protection
or may measure antibodies indirectly asso-
ciated with the causal underlying immune de-
terminants (31). Critical next steps toward
identifying mechanistic correlates of protec-
tion and enhancement, as well as of safe, pro-
tective dengue vaccines, include development
of serological assays that distinguish protec-
tive from enhancing antibodies; determina-
tion of how the sequence of infecting DENV
types modifies disease; and integrated evalua-
tion of cellular, innate, and humoral immunity
to DENV infection and disease (32, 33).
In sum, we verify enhancement of dengue
disease in humans and show that the level of
preexisting anti-DENV antibodies is directly
associated with the severity of secondary den-
gue disease in humans. We also show that the
immune correlate for enhanced severe dengue
disease is distinct from that for protection.
These observations are important for future den-
gue and Zika vaccine trial design and evaluation,
as well as for further studies on the mechanisms
of ADE in relation to severe dengue and Zika
disease.
