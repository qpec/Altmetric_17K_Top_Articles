Abstract
Background: Single-cell micro-metastases of solid tumors often occur in the bone marrow. These disseminated
tumor cells (DTCs) may resist therapy and lay dormant or progress to cause overt bone and visceral metastases.
The molecular nature of DTCs remains elusive, as well as when and from where in the tumor they originate. Here,
we apply single-cell sequencing to identify and trace the origin of DTCs in breast cancer.
Results: We sequence the genomes of 63 single cells isolated from six non-metastatic breast cancer patients.
By comparing the cells’ DNA copy number aberration (CNA) landscapes with those of the primary tumors and
lymph node metastasis, we establish that 53% of the single cells morphologically classified as tumor cells are
DTCs disseminating from the observed tumor. The remaining cells represent either non-aberrant “normal” cells
or “aberrant cells of unknown origin” that have CNA landscapes discordant from the tumor. Further analyses
suggest that the prevalence of aberrant cells of unknown origin is age-dependent and that at least a subset is
hematopoietic in origin. Evolutionary reconstruction analysis of bulk tumor and DTC genomes enables ordering
of CNA events in molecular pseudo-time and traced the origin of the DTCs to either the main tumor clone,
primary tumor subclones, or subclones in an axillary lymph node metastasis.
Conclusions: Single-cell sequencing of bone marrow epithelial-like cells, in parallel with intra-tumor genetic
heterogeneity profiling from bulk DNA, is a powerful approach to identify and study DTCs, yielding insight into
metastatic processes. A heterogeneous population of CNA-positive cells is present in the bone marrow of
non-metastatic breast cancer patients, only part of which are derived from the observed tumor lineages.

 Background
Cancer is a disease of the genome, arising through the
accumulation of somatic driver mutations, leading to
successive clonal expansions [1, 2]. Somatic mutations
can
take
many
forms,
including
single
nucleotide
changes, small insertions and deletions, genomic rear-
rangements, copy number aberrations, and epigenetic
changes. While the majority of these mutations are in-
nocent passenger mutations, a small subset are drivers,
conferring a selective advantage on the cells that carry
them and sparking clonal expansions. Cancers develop
through Darwinian and punctuated evolutionary pro-
cesses in which early
clonal expansions represent
complete selective sweeps [3]. As a result of these early
clonal expansions, the driver and passenger mutations
in the originating cells are inherited in all cancer cells.
The cell of origin that prompts the last complete select-
ive sweep can be termed the most recent common an-
cestor (MRCA), the one cell from which all cancer cells
in a tumor sample derive. Later driver mutations may
result in incomplete clonal expansions, resulting in a
patchwork of genetically related but competing subclones.
In breast cancer, assessment of variant allele frequencies
in bulk DNA samples has allowed determination of the
subclonal architecture of the tumor [4, 5]. Parallel ad-
vances in single-cell isolation, DNA amplification, and
computational approaches have recently enabled single-
cell genome sequence analyses, providing unprecedented
power to dissect intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity [6–11].
Cancer cells may intravasate from a solid tumor, travel
through the blood stream as a circulating tumor cell,
and subsequently extravasate in distant organs like the
bone marrow. These disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in
the bone marrow may remain dormant for years, pro-
viding a reservoir of progenitors for distant metastases
[9, 12]. Patients diagnosed with non-metastatic breast
cancer still have a significant risk of relapse, even after
complete surgical removal of the tumor, most likely due
to the existence of DTCs, reported in up to 40% of
cases [13, 14]. Their presence in bone marrow aspirates
at the time of diagnosis or following treatment is a
prognostic marker for poor survival [13–19]. DTCs can
be refractory to therapy due to their dormant cell state
or other cellular features, such as overexpression of the
Her2 proto-oncogene [20, 21]. The concentration of
DTCs in the bone marrow is typically estimated at one
cell per 107–108 blood cells in patients with advanced
disease [13]. These cells are usually identified using
immunocytochemistry or immunofluorescence for epi-
thelial (e.g., cytokeratins, EpCAM) or breast tissue
markers (e.g., human mammaglobin) [13].
Exactly when and where DTCs arise during tumor
evolution, as well as the molecular mechanisms involved,
remain largely elusive. Two main models have been
proposed for dissemination of tumor cells [22]. The par-
allel progression model hypothesizes that cancer cells
leave their site of origin early, resulting in largely inde-
pendent evolution of the primary tumor and the dissem-
inated cells. Under this model, the primary tumor and
DTCs can present with profoundly different genomes. In
contrast, the linear model proposes a sequential process
whereby tumor cells disseminate from major or minor
subclone(s), leading to at least partly identical genomic
profiles for DTCs and the primary tumor.
Previous genomic analyses of cells, immunocytochemi-
cally classified as DTCs in bone marrow aspirates, pri-
marily employed comparative genomic hybridization. In
patients with non-metastatic breast cancer, the majority
of identified cells displayed either a normal euploid pro-
file or an aberrant DNA copy number landscape seem-
ingly unrelated to the primary tumor [23, 24], suggesting
parallel evolution. Additionally, copy number aberrations
(CNAs) detected among DTCs from the same non-
metastatic patient were generally non-recurrent [23, 25].
In contrast, DTCs isolated from the same patient bur-
dened with metastatic disease frequently shared CNAs,
also with the primary tumor and/or the lymph node me-
tastasis, fitting a linear progression model [26, 27].
In this study, we applied single-cell sequencing to pro-
file the genomic landscape of cells isolated based on im-
munocytochemical and morphologic parameters from
bone marrow aspirates of six breast cancer patients.
We correlated their profiles with the (sub)clonal CNA
architectures and somatic single nucleotide substitution
profiles—obtained by SNP-array and exome-sequencing,
respectively—of the primary tumors as well as one lymph
node metastasis. Copy number and somatic single nucleo-
tide variant genotyping analyses reveal that only a fraction
of the cells commonly selected as DTCs from bone mar-
row aspirates in breast cancer derive from the same
lineage as the observed tumor clones. The cells exhibiting
copy number neutral or aberrant profiles dissimilar from
that of the primary tumor do not derive from the observed
primary tumor. Additionally, by combining single-cell
sequencing with subclonal reconstruction of the bulk
tumor, we construct detailed phylogenetic trees of the
breast cancers and trace the origins of the genuine
DTCs. Our results support a model where tumor cells
disseminate relatively late, from observable subclones
in the primary tumor or metastasis.
Results
Immunocytochemical and sequencing-based molecular
classification of single cells in the bone marrow
Following the established immunocytochemical staining
for putative DTCs (“Methods”) [17, 28–30], we isolated
56 single cells from seven bone marrow aspirates of six
breast cancer patients (six aspirates taken at diagnosis
Demeulemeester et al. Genome Biology  (2016) 17:250 
Page 2 of 15
 and one taken 3 years after; Additional file 1: Figure S1;
Additional file 2: Table S1). We also isolated seven con-
trol cells after staining each sample with an isotype
control monoclonal antibody (mAb) instead of the anti-
cytokeratin mAbs. Based on previously described mor-
phologic parameters, the single cells were classified as
tumor cell (TC), probable hematopoietic cell (PHC),
hematopoietic cell (HC), or uncertain cell (“Methods”)
[29]. The patients included in this study had not previ-
ously been diagnosed with any type of cancer and had
localized or regional disease and no distant metastasis
at diagnosis. Four of the six patients were diagnosed
with invasive lobular carcinoma and the remaining two
with invasive ductal carcinoma (Table 1). All patients
had grade 2 tumors; five had hormone receptor-positive
tumors with confirmed axillary lymph node involve-
ment. Two patients had Her2-positive tumors. Four pa-
tients developed systemic recurrence, three of which
died of breast cancer and one was still alive at last
follow-up 241 months later. Two patients died of other
causes. For all patients, putative DTCs were collected at
diagnosis as well as a sample from the primary tumor. For
one patient, MicMa107, a synchronous axillary lymph
node metastasis was sampled as well, and DTCs were ob-
tained again 3 years after diagnosis (Additional file 2:
Table S1). The bulk primary and lymph node samples
were subjected to SNP array profiling and whole exome
sequencing.
We amplified the genomes of these 63 single cells
using a modified GenomePlex approach (“Methods”)
and performed low coverage paired-end sequencing,
resulting in 1.7× (±1.2×) coverage depth (average ±
standard
deviation)
and
23.7%
(±15.4%)
coverage
breadth across the cell’s genome (Additional file 2:
Table S2). Following read depth analysis, we observed
different relationships of the DNA copy number pro-
files of the cells to the clonal copy number profiles of
the bulk primary tumors and lymph node metastasis as
assessed by SNP array (Table 2, Fig. 1). Eleven single
cells presented with CNAs similar to the primary
tumor or the lymph node metastasis and were classi-
fied as genuine tumor-derived DTCs. Other single
cells, however, demonstrated either copy neutral pro-
files or CNAs that were distinct from the bulk tumor.
These cells were labeled, respectively, as “normal” cells
(N; n = 16) and “aberrant cells of unknown origin”
(AU; n = 24) (Table 2, Fig. 1; Additional file 2: Table S3).
Six of the aberrant cells, including one control, and five of
the normal cells exhibited increased noise in the read
depth profiles, which may induce false positive CNAs
(“Methods”; Additional file 1: Figure S2). The aberrant
cells with increased noise were excluded from our analyses
as they could not be unambiguously assigned to the N or
AU category. In a few cases, a CNA in an AU cell over-
lapped a CNA in the corresponding bulk tumor. However,
in all cases where the breakpoints were identifiable (i.e.,
not at a centromere or a telomere), they were demon-
strably distinct, indicating that these represented inde-
pendent CNA events (Additional file 1: Figure S3).
Additional investigation of the micrographs of each cell
along with their respective CNA profile revealed that in
about one isolation out of five, two or more cells were
likely collected rather than just one (Additional file 1:
Figures S1, S4 and S7; Additional file 2: Table S3).
These were annotated as “doublets” (D; n = 12, includ-
ing two control cells), several of which are likely to
contain a tumor-derived DTC based on their CN land-
scape (e.g., 003D, 107N).
To assess whether generalizable conclusions can be
drawn from the remaining 45 single cells, we per-
formed a retrospective power analysis [31]. Specifically,
we plotted the cumulative number of unique CNAs as
a function of the cumulative number of single cells
(Additional file 1: Figure S5). In those patients where
genuine DTCs were identified, the curve consistently
flattens off, indicating that sufficient cells have been

 sequenced to capture the diversity of the existing DTC
population. In MicMa107, the 3 year after diagnosis
time point has a much steeper rarefaction curve com-
pared to the one at diagnosis, suggesting that add-
itional samples are more likely to reveal novel clones.
Most of the 11 single cells categorized by sequencing
as DTCs were classified by morphology and staining as
TCs (n = 10), while the remaining single cell was inter-
preted as a HC (n = 1) (Table 3). The 18 AU cells,
encompassing all four remaining control cells, were
morphologically and immunocytochemically classified as
TC (n = 3), uncertain (n = 4), PHC (n = 8), or HC (n = 3),
while the 16 N cells were typed as TC (n = 6), uncertain
(n = 5), or PHC (n = 5). Six cells were consistently classi-
fied as N/HC after morphology and CNA analyses. In
summary, the seven control cells represented five AUs,
one of which was excluded from further analyses, and
two Ds. The 56 isolated anti-cytokeratin stained cells
constituted 11 genuine DTCs, 19 AUs (five of which
were excluded), 16 Ns, and 10 Ds.

somatic single nucleotide substitutions. Following fil-
tering of the variants called by MuTect (“Methods”),
we retained 239 somatic substitutions in the seven
bulk cancer exomes (Additional file 2: Tables S4 and S5),
of which 103 are non-synonymous, four are nonsense, 40
are synonymous, and 92 are present in introns or
intergenic regions. These included driver mutations in
ERBB2 in patient MicMa019 and in PIK3CA and TP53 in
patient MicMa044. Subsequently, we genotyped the
substitutions in the sparser single-cell data: 117 of the
239 positions were covered by at least one read in at
least one cell (Fig. 2; Additional file 2: Table S4). The
DTCs of patient MicMa003 displayed four out of six
covered tumor bulk somatic substitutions, those of
MicMa083 displayed ten out of 21, and those of
MicMa107 displayed six out of 20. Conversely, the AU

each row represents either a single somatic substitution called on the corresponding bulk exome and the matched blood (a) or a random

that tumor. Tile colors reflect the detection of the variant allele (orange), of the reference allele only (blue), or whether there was no coverage
at that position (white). Only DTCs, but no normal or AU cells, share mutations with the tumor. A single mutation shared between normal cell
107B and the tumor of MicMa107 was later confirmed as a missed heterozygous germline variant (indicated with an asterisk). For clarity, loci
with zero coverage in all of the single cells of that patient are omitted. c Modeled probability of observing an at least equally extreme pattern of somatic

encoded as heat maps of − log10(p)

 and N cell data did not contain a single read reporting
any of the 117 somatic substitutions. Note that one
normal cell (107B) from patient MicMa107 appeared to
contain a single somatic substitution (Fig. 2). However,
by PCR-based genotyping in the primary tumor and
blood sample, we confirmed this substitution to be a
germline SNP that was miscalled as a somatic variant
due to low coverage in the matched normal sample.
The occurrence of single-cell sequence reads reporting
a substitution known from the tumor bulk provides
strong evidence for its presence in the single cell despite
false positive substitutions that occasionally result from
whole-genome amplification (WGA) or sequencing arti-
facts (the false positive rate over all single cells was
0.0017 ± 0.0026). The detection of multiple somatic sub-
stitutions in most DTCs further substantiates that they
indeed originated from the patients’ tumors. In contrast,
the sparse coverage, together with the possibilities of
complete locus dropout and allelic dropout, do not allow
us to ascertain whether a somatic substitution is absent
from a single cell (locus dropout rate 0.6907 ± 0.1485,
false negative rate 0.4405 ± 0.1495). However, the con-
sistent lack of single-cell reads reporting any mutant
allele across all bulk somatic substitutions in the AU and
N cells suggests that they do not share a lineage with
the observed breast tumor (Fig. 2; Additional file 2:
Table S4). As opposed to the somatic substitutions,
which were undetectable in the AU and N cells, detec-
tion rates of alternative alleles of germline SNPs (Num-
ber of alternative/Total number covered) were similar
across all single cells, irrespective of their classification
(Fig. 2, “Methods”).
To quantify the confidence which the genotyping re-
sults provide regarding single cell origins, we calculated
per-cell false positive and false negative error rates of
genotyping
germline
homozygous
and
heterozygous
SNPs, respectively. Using these estimates as proxies for
the corresponding error rates of genotyping somatic sin-
gle nucleotide substitutions, we modeled the pattern of
reference and variant somatic alleles per cell as a beta-
binomial distribution. DTCs generally have p values
≤10−2 for the false positive model, indicating that it is
unlikely they do not have any of the tumor’s somatic
single nucleotide substitutions, i.e., they likely derive
from the tumor lineage. Vice versa, where we have the
power (enough somatic variants and coverage, e.g.,
MicMa019 and 044), the false negative error model
shows that the AU and N cells are unlikely to share the
tumor’s single nucleotide substitutions, i.e., they most
likely derive from another lineage.
Along with inspection of their CNA landscapes, geno-
typing somatic variants in the doublets allowed us to
build confidence and classify at least one of the constitu-
ent cells (Additional file 1: Figures S7 and S8). The
doublets of MicMa003 include another two DTCs (one
with genotyping evidence) and at least one AU. Those
of MicMa017 comprise no less than three AUs, and
those of MicMa107 contain four DTCs (two with geno-
typing evidence) and at least one AU (Additional file 2:
Table S6). Taken together, tumor bulk and single-cell
mutation analysis corroborated the CNA-based classifi-
cation of the cells. Including cells captured in doublets,
we observed five DTCs from patient MicMa003, three
DTCs from patient MicMa083, and nine DTCs from
patient MicMa107. In all patients, the cells identified as
N or AU did not share any somatic mutations (neither
CNAs nor single nucleotide substitutions) with the bulk
tumor samples and are therefore unlikely to share a
breast tumor lineage.
Lineage of the aberrant cells of unknown origin
Although the immunocytochemical staining of AUs (and
Ns) suggests that they derive from an epithelial lineage,
false positive staining cannot be ruled out. Specifically,
plasma cells directly reactive to alkaline phosphatase
have previously been found to contribute false positive
results [32]. Interestingly, the four control single cells,
stained using the isotype control mAb instead of anti-
cytokeratins, were classified as AUs. Since most of these
cells were also morphologically classified as HCs, it is
likely that at least a subset of all AUs derives from the
hematopoietic lineage. Looking across AUs, 44% of the
cells show gains on 1q and 22% have a gain of chromo-
some 5 (Fig. 3a). While the former is commonly ob-
served in various cancer types, the latter is rare in breast
cancer but more frequent in liver cancer and multiple
myeloma, a cancer of plasma cells (Mitelman Database of
Chromosome Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer,
http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Chromosomes/Mitelman). Several
AUs within patients share copy number aberrations,
hinting at an ongoing process of clonal expansion and
evolution of some of these cells: 1q gain in 019A-D,
chromosome 5 gain and chromosome 9 loss or copy
neutral loss of heterozygosity in 044A and 044D, re-
spectively, and chromosome 5 gain in 107F and 107G
(Figs. 1 and 3a). In line with this observation, the frac-
tion of AUs over total cells tends to increase with pa-
tient age (Fig. 3b, slope = 0.013 ± 0.004, p = 0.026). In
summary, the classification of control cells, the typical
and recurrent CNA landscapes, and the correlation with
patient age suggest that at least part of the AUs derive
from clonally expanding hematopoietic cell populations.
Tracing the origin of disseminated tumor cells in
breast cancer
To evaluate the existing cancer progression models and
provide insight into breast tumor evolution, we next re-
constructed the phylogeny of the tumors in patients

 MicMa003 and MicMa083 and traced the origins of
their DTCs. To this end, we compared the CNA land-
scape of the DTCs with the (sub)clonal CNA architec-
ture
of
the
corresponding
primary
tumors,
as
determined by the Battenberg algorithm [4] (Fig. 4; Add-
itional file 1: Figures S8 and S9). In both patients, the
cancer exhibited a linear progression model. Specifically,
in patient MicMa003, the bulk primary tumor contained
clonal 1q and 17q DNA gains as well as a loss of
chromosome 4 and segmental deletions -6(q12-q25.1),
-16q, and -17(p13.3-p11.2; p12; q12-q21.31). A further
subclonal gain of the 1q-arm was detected in 38% of
tumor cells, demonstrating ongoing evolution. The
DTCs from this patient (003A, 003C, and 003E)
shared all clonal CNAs but lacked the subclonal 1q
gain or any private CNAs, supporting their origin

 from the most recent common ancestor (MRCA)
and not from the more recent subclone (Fig. 4a;
Additional file 1: Figure S8a and S9a, b).
In patient MicMa083, DTCs 083A/D/G shared all
clonal CNAs from the primary tumor as well as the
gains of 1q, 16p, and chromosome 13, which were sub-
clonal in the primary, occurring in 50, 30, and 21% of
the tumor cells, respectively (Fig. 4b; Additional file 1:
Figure S8e, S9c–f). The presence of these aberrations in
the DTCs allowed us to confidently nest the different
subclones within one another and derive a linear tree.
DTCs 083A and 083G demonstrated further aberrations,
not observed in the primary tumor. Both cells have an
additional trisomy of chromosome 21, but only 083G
has gained another copy of 16p, chromosome 19, and
X(p11.4-q21.31). These results show that the primary
breast cancers of patient MicMa003 and MicMa083 both
display linear evolution. DTCs either disseminated from
the MRCA observed in the primary (MicMa003) or from
subclones in the primary (MicMa083) that either did
(083A) or did not (083D) evolve further.
Tumor cell dissemination from axillary lymph node
metastasis subclones
We subsequently used similar principles to reconstruct
the evolutionary history of the primary tumor, axillary
lymph node metastasis, two DTCs harvested at diag-
nosis, and three DTCs harvested 3 years after diagno-
ses in patient MicMa107. This revealed a complex
progression model with DTCs originating from mul-
tiple subclones in the lymph node metastasis (Fig. 4c;
Additional file 1: Figure S8f, g and S9g–o). The pri-
mary tumor and axillary lymph node metastasis exhib-
ited distinct but clearly evolutionarily related CNA
profiles. While the MRCA of the primary tumor con-
tained CNAs on chromosomes 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15,
and 16, the “MRCA” of the lymph node metastasis had
several additional aberrations (Fig. 4c; Additional file 1:
Figure S8f, g and S9g–o). Interestingly, the
CNAs
-10(q25.3-q26.3), -14(q24.1-q32.33), and potentially also
-17p and +17q were clonal in the lymph node metastasis
but define a subclone of 88% of cancer cells in the primary
tumor. Furthermore, in the primary tumor, Battenberg
identified a large number of CNAs present in smaller sub-
clones, suggesting substantial intratumor heterogeneity.
The axillary lymph node metastasis also showed extensive
subclonal variegation (Fig. 4c; Additional file 1: Figure S8f,
g and S9g–o; Additional file 2: Table S7), with many
CNAs absent or below the detection limit in the primary
tumor. Nevertheless, independent but similar subclonal
CNAs were present in the primary and lymph node me-
tastasis on 1q, 2q, 8q, and 18q, suggesting convergent evo-
lution. Notably, the level of amplification of 8q, possibly
driven by MYC, seemed to vary between subclones and
DTCs. Subclonal CNAs +18(q21.1-q23), +8(q11.22-q12.1)
and -18(p11.32-p11.22) were detected in 89, 39 and 25%,
respectively, of the cancer cells in the lymph node metas-
tasis as well as in the single-cell sequences of the two
DTCs isolated at the time of diagnosis, 107A and 107D.
Coexistence of these subclonal CNAs in both DTCs to-
gether with all clonal CNAs unique to the lymph node
metastasis allowed us to resolve the phylogenic tree by
nesting the three subclones within one another under the
lymph node MRCA. DTCs 107A and 107D contained
additional DNA gains, +9(q22.33-q34.3) and +19(q13.32-
q13.43), and a loss of part of a previously gained segment,
-8(p11.32-q21.3), not observed in the bulk data. Hence,
these two DTCs disseminated to the bone marrow only
late, from a small subclone in the axillary lymph node me-
tastasis and not from the primary tumor.
The population of disseminated tumor cells 3 years after
diagnosis
The DTCs isolated 3 years post-diagnosis (107H, 107J,
and 107M) presented all clonal aberrations of the lymph
node metastasis, as well as the subclonal +18(q21.1-q23)
gain, showing that also these cells did not directly derive
from the primary tumor. They did not share the private
CNAs of 107A and 107D. DTC 107J additionally con-
tained a gain, +17(q11.2-q25.3), and a loss, -2(p25.3-
p22.2). While the latter was private, the former was de-
tectable as a subclonal CNA in 16% of the lymph node
cancer cells at the time of diagnosis. DTCs 107H and
107M were more closely related to the DTCs isolated at
the time of diagnosis and appear to be derived from the
same 25% subclone in the lymph node, sharing all of its
CNAs. Cells from this subclone seem to have evolved
further, acquiring the unique gains +3(p26.3-p21.31),
+6(q24.3-q27), and +14(q11.2-q24.1) as well as a loss of
chromosome 1. DTC 107H showed an additional gain,
+X(p11.21-q21.33), and loss, -5(q14.3-q22.2), while DTC
107M was likely tetraploid with additional gains of
9(q21.11-q34.3) and chromosome 12, and an 8(p23.3-
p22) loss. The large number of new CNAs identified in
these
three
DTCs
highlights
ongoing
processes
of
chromosomal instability and subclonal evolution during
follow-up. Indeed, the steeper rarefaction curve derived
for the sample 3 years after diagnosis compared to the
sample at diagnosis confirms that the population of
DTCs in MicMa107 has diversified over time (Additional
file 1: Figure S5). In summary, these results show that all
DTCs isolated from patient MicMa107 are descendants of
subclones in the axillary lymph node metastasis, which
have survived therapy and continued to evolve.
Discussion
Bone marrow provides a reservoir for DTCs that may
evade therapy, remain dormant, and can cause overt

 metastases over time [9]. Hence, developing our under-
standing of the origin, nature, and biology of this cancer
cell “type” is important. In contrast to previous studies
that
primarily
applied
low-resolution
metaphase-
chromosome
or
microarray
comparative
genomic
hybridization, we employed single-cell genome sequen-
cing to shed new light on the cells isolated as “DTCs”
from bone marrow aspirates according to established
immunocytochemical and morphologic criteria. Specif-
ically, we demonstrate the existence of three major
classes among the isolated cells: (i) true DTCs, which
share both CNAs and single nucleotide substitutions
with the tumor; (ii) aberrant cells of unknown origin
which have CNA profiles that do not match those of
the observed tumor or metastasis and that lack the
somatic substitutions of the tumor; and (iii) normal
cells having copy neutral genomes without tumor-
specific mutations.
Of the 19 single cells immunocytochemically and mor-
phologically classified as TCs, ten could be conclusively
categorized as true DTCs (14 out of 24 including dou-
blets). In contrast, only one of the 21 single cells classi-
fied as uncertain, PHC, or HC turned out to be a true
DTC (three out of 26 including doublets). While the
adaptation of the staining—as required for downstream
genomic analysis [26]—may have affected the precision
of
the
morphologic
classification
of
the
immuno-
detected single cells, these findings still underscore its
value (true positive rate 52.6 ± 11.5%, false negative rate
4.8 ± 4.7%). Notably, we found true DTCs for only three
patients (MicMa003, 083 and 107), all of which went on
to develop distant metastases (Table 1). In contrast, only
AU and N cells were found in MicMa017, 019, and 044,
of which only MicMa019 showed systemic recurrence.
Our results suggest that previous studies based on
morphologic criteria may have been underrepresented
for “true DTCs”, as defined here by genetic profiling.
Cells identified in those studies, usually from patients
without distant metastases, carrying a smaller number of
chromosomal aberrations [23, 25, 33] distinct from
one another and from those in the tumor under con-
sideration [23, 33], and usually consisting of whole-
chromosome gains or losses [23], likely correspond to
AUs. These cells may have been interpreted as genuine
DTCs, thus supporting a parallel progression model of
the disease. The idea has been put forward that AU-like
cells, in their ectopic site, obtain a genomic landscape
similar to the primary tumor in a macroevolutionary
process resulting from evolutionary shifts as could be in-
duced by telomere crisis or the inactivation of a tumor
suppressor such as TP53 [34]. To the best of our know-
ledge, we provide the first comprehensive investigation
with modern sequencing technologies of these cells. Our
data show a complete absence of tumor-specific truncal
mutations in the AUs, supporting the notion that these
cells do not derive from the MRCA nor any other observ-
able progenitor of the sampled breast tumor. Indeed, dir-
ect evidence implicating AU-like cells as the precursors of
overt metastases is scant [35].
The AUs (and perhaps also the normal cells) in our
study may either represent a likely epithelial cell type of
breast or non-breast origin homing to the bone marrow
or derive from the hematopoietic cell lineage. Alterna-
tively, these cells may originate from another neoplasm
in the patient, an undetected synchronous primary
breast tumor, or an undetectable or unsampled tumor
cell clone residing in the primary tumor. Our results
suggest that at least part of the AUs derive from
hematopoietic cell populations, most likely plasma cells.
Interestingly, studies employing single nucleus sequen-
cing have previously reported cells with random gains or
losses of single chromosomes or chromosome arms in
diploid genomes, similar to many of the AUs [6, 36, 37].
These “pseudodiploid cells” were observed at rates of
1–6% in different normal tissues (brain, liver, skin, and
breast) and 6–8% in breast tumor stroma, suggesting
that even normal tissues display low-level aneuploidy,
likely due to mitotic segregation defects. While pseudo-
diploid cells may account for about half of the AUs,
those harboring recurrent CNAs (e.g., gain of chromo-
some 1q or 5 and loss of 9) are more likely to represent
clonal expansion of a (pre)malignant subpopulation. At
least two studies using SNP-array analyses of bulk
DNA have now documented the emergence of subclo-
nal hematopoietic cell lineages containing large CNAs
within the blood of cancer cases as well as cancer-free
controls [38, 39]. Like the fraction of AUs, the fre-
quency of this subclonal genetic mosaicism increased
with age in cancer-free individuals. By using single-cell
sequencing, we may be witnessing the diversity of geno-
mically aberrant hematopoietic cells that exist in low
numbers within the bone marrow.
Using the CNAs as a guide, true DTCs were mapped
onto the phylogenetic trees of the breast cancers, in-
ferred by Battenberg from the bulk tumor DNA, expos-
ing their evolutionary origins. The single-cell genome
sequences enabled us to add considerable detail to the
phylogeny of the solid tumors of patients MicMa083
and MicMa107. For patient MicMa083, the 50, 30, and
21% primary tumor subclones could only be nested con-
fidently within one another because the single-cell DTC
sequences reported coexistence of all three CNA events.
Without knowledge of co-occurrence of these rare
CNAs in the same cell, it would have been impossible to
order these events in molecular pseudo-time. Similarly,
the phylogenetic tree of the lymph node metastasis in
patient MicMa107 could be reconstructed in more detail
owing to the single-cell DTC sequences.

 Our results provide clear insights into the origin of
DTCs in breast cancer. All true DTCs in this study de-
rive from either the MRCA (MicMa003), subclones of
the MRCA (MicMa083), or subclones in an axillary
lymph node metastasis that was seeded by a subclone of
the MRCA of the primary tumor (MicMa107). We did
not observe any DTC that carried only a subset of som-
atic changes present in the MRCA of the primary tumor,
which would point towards early dissemination. Taken
together, these results support a model whereby the
ability of breast cancer cells to disseminate to the bone
marrow arises relatively late in tumor evolution. How-
ever, we cannot rule out the possibility that continuous
seeding and replacement is occurring: early disseminat-
ing tumor cells are replaced by new arrivals from the
tumor as they compete for a bone marrow niche.
Interestingly, in patient MicMa083, all DTCs origi-
nated from the same 21% subclone. In MicMa107, how-
ever, multiple subclones hold the ability to disseminate
to the bone marrow. Notably, only subclonal populations
in the lymph node metastasis that have undergone con-
siderable evolution since the MRCA are observed in
the bone marrow. Hypothetically, metastatic potential
(or the ability to disseminate to the bone marrow as a
proxy to that) emerged with the MRCA in MicMa003
and significantly later in MicMa083 and MicMa107.
While our sample size is small and further study is
needed, these results raise the hope that early detection
strategies can lead to diagnosis and treatment before
the emergence of such metastatic clones.
Conclusions
Single-cell sequencing of cells isolated from bone mar-
row aspirates of patients with localized breast cancer, in
parallel with intratumor genetic heterogeneity profiling
of the bulk tumor DNA, is a powerful approach for the
identification of genuine DTCs and the subsequent study
of their biology and tumor progression. Additionally, the
single-cell sequences of the DTCs help resolve the
phylogenetic tree structure by evidencing co-occurrence
of rare subclonal CNAs—presenting with different low
allelic frequencies in the bulk—in the same single cell.
Finally, our data uncover a heterogeneous class of CNA-
positive cells isolated as DTCs but unrelated to the
breast cancer lineage, warranting further exploration.
Methods
Patient material
Primary tumor tissue and bone marrow aspirates were
obtained from six distant metastasis-free breast cancer
patients included in the Oslo Micrometastasis (MicMa)
project [18]. For one patient we also retrieved a lymph
node metastasis biopsy. Biopsies were fresh frozen at
−80 °C. Clinical classification of the patients and tumors
is described in Additional file 2: Table S1. DNA was
extracted using an ABI 341 Nucleic Acid Purification
System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Bone marrow aspirates were taken at the time of sur-
gery, and, for one patient, also 3 years after diagnosis.
DTC isolation, detection, and classification
The DTC isolation and detection procedures have been
described in detail previously [26]. In brief, after bone
marrow mononuclear cell isolation and cytospin prepar-
ation, single cells were analyzed by immunocytochemical
staining either for cytokeratins using the AE1/AE3 mAb
combination, which covers a broad spectrum of cytoker-
atins (CK10, 14–16, 19 (AE1) and CK 1–8 (AE3)) or the
MOPC 21 isotype negative control mAb, and the stand-
ard APAAP (Dako, Denmark) detection system [26]. The
cytospins were screened manually using light micros-
copy, and detected immuno-stained cells were morpho-
logically classified according to a current standardized
and clinically validated procedure into four groups:
tumor cell (TC), uncertain cell, probable hematopoietic
cell (PHC), and hematopoietic cell (HC). Cells with a
clearly enlarged nucleus compared with the neighboring
HCs are classified as TC, in addition to cells appearing
in clusters. Also, cells lacking these pathognomonic TC
features and having HC-sized nuclei may be classified as
TC if no recognizable hematopoietic features can be
identified. Most often such cells show strong and irregu-
larly stained cytoplasm, often partly covering the nu-
cleus, and an atypical appearance. On the other hand,
typical HC features are low nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio,
with nuclear size similar to that of the neighboring bone
marrow cells, weak or moderate staining intensity, and
an evenly stained cytoplasm, often with microvacuoliza-
tion; some have a recognizable plasma cell appearance.
The detected cells, however, cover a continuous mor-
phologic spectrum, with overlapping features between
TC and HC. We have here classified as PHC the more
anonymous cells with an intermediate appearance, show-
ing both some TC and some HC characteristics, and as
“uncertain” the cells with morphology in between PHC
and TC. Clinical validation supports the assumption that
TC mostly represent real TC, in addition to a proportion
of the PHC, while HC are false positive hematopoietic
cells [30]. This does not exclude the possibility of false
positive HC classified as TC or vice versa. For the
present study, nuclear staining was omitted and a BCIP/
NBT blue substrate solution was used for visualization
of antibody binding to prevent interference with the
subsequent genomic analysis steps. This yields a less
complete rendering of cytological details than the
standard hematoxylin nuclear staining and the red New

 Fuchsin solution, a fact that may have increased the
chance of misclassifications of the identified cells [29, 30].
Following microscopic identification of the desired
cells, the single cells were isolated using a CellTram
Vario Microinjector and Eppendorf Transferman NK 2
micromanipulation equipment (Eppendorf, Hamburg,
Germany) combined with an inverted Axiovert 40 C
microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Jena, Germany).
Whole genome amplification
Following isolation of the selected cells from the
cytospins, the single cells were lysed and their DNA
amplified using the GenomePlex® Single-Cell Whole-
Genome Amplification Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) but using the Titanium Taq DNA polymer-
ase (BD Biosciences Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany)
instead of the kit’s standard polymerase, as described
by Mathiesen et al. [26].
Library preparation and sequencing of DTCs and primary
tumors with matched blood
The first steps of the whole genome- and exome-
sequencing library preparation for the single cells and
primary tumor with matched normal, respectively, were
similar. DNA (1 μg) was sheared using the S220
Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA).
The sample was column cleaned using a Qiaquick PCR
purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and eluted
in 36 μl elution buffer (EB), followed by fragment end
repair using the End-It™ DNA End-Repair Kit (Epicenter,
Madison, WI, USA). The end repair master mix (MM)
was made as specified by the manufacturer and 16 μl
mixed with 34 μl sheared DNA and incubated at room
temperature for 45 minutes. Subsequently, each sample
underwent column cleaning and was eluted in 34 μl EB
followed by A-base addition using an A-addition master
mix and incubated at 37 °C for 30 minutes. The A-
addition master mix consisted of 5 μl 10× NEBuffer 2
(New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), 10 μl dATP
(1 mM; Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA), and 3 μl Klenow
[3′- > 5′ exo-] (Thermo Scientific). Following A-base
addition, samples were column cleaned and eluted in
40 μl EB. Adaptors were ligated onto the DNA frag-
ments using an adaptor ligation master mix and each
sample was incubated at 16 °C for 20 minutes. The
adaptor ligation master mix was made out of 5 μl 10×
T4 Ligase Buffer (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA,
USA), 5 μl adaptor (50 μM), and 2 μl T4 DNA Ligase
(2000 U/μl) (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA)
for each sample. Samples were column cleaned and ex-
ome- and whole genome libraries were eluted in 20 μl
and 50 μl EB, respectively. Size selection (150–350 bp)
of exome library fragments was then performed using
an E-Gel® electrophoresis system with a 2% agarose gel
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). Exome sequen-
cing libraries were bead cleaned using Agencourt
AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA) and eluted
in 50 μl EB. Subsequently, both the exome- and whole
genome-sequencing libraries were PCR-amplified; the
whole genome libraries have been described in detail
previously [40]. Exome libraries were amplified using
an amplification master mix consisting of 1.5 μl uni-
versal primer, 1.5 μl index primer, 125 μl 2× iProof
High-Fidelity
Master
Mix
(Bio-Rad
Laboratories,
Hercules, CA, USA), and 72.5 μl MQ water. The MM
was added to the template and spread across five wells
at a reaction volume of 50 μl and run for 12 cycles.
After PCR amplification, quality assessment of sam-
ples was performed using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Tech-
nologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Exome capture was
performed using NimbleGen capture hybridization
beads (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). For each sample,
100 μl of blocking primer master mix was added to a
tube of 5 μl dried Cot-1-DNA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA). The MM was prepared by adding 10 μl of
each blocking primer: B01.P5.F, B02.P5.R, B01.P5.F,
B03.P7.part1.F,
B04.P7.part1.R,
B05.P7.part2.F,
and
B06.P7.part2.R (100 μM). Blocking primer MM (60 μl)
and template DNA (1 μg) were added to the dried
Cot-1-DNA, resuspended, and dried by speed-vacuum
at 45 °C. The hybridization MM was prepared by
adding 7.5 μl 2× Hybridization Buffer and 3 μl
Hybridization component A and added to the tem-
plate and resuspended. The mixture was denatured at
95 °C for 10 minutes. Capture probes (4.5 μl) were
added to the mixture and samples were incubated at
47 °C for 64–72 h. Post-capture, the samples were
washed using Streptavidin Dynabeads (Termo Fisher
Scientific, MA, USA) following the manufacturer’s
protocol. Subsequently, post-capture PCR was per-
formed for ten cycles. Exome- and whole-genome li-
braries were sequenced on HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, San
Diego, CA, USA).
For single cells 003G–L, 017E–I, 019B–D, 044G–H,
083G–I and 107R–U, 0.5 to 1 ng of amplified gDNA
was used for library preparation using the Nextera
XT kit (Illumina) following the manufacturer’s in-
structions.

Copy number analysis of primary tumors
DNA from the primary tumors or lymph node metasta-
sis was analyzed for CNAs using the Genome-Wide
Human SNP array 6.0 platform (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA, USA). The data were normalized to the

 HapMap samples using Affymetrix Power Tools. The
Battenberg algorithm [4], an extension of the Allele-
Specific Copy number Analysis of Tumors (ASCAT)
algorithm [41], was used to estimate the aberrant cell
fraction and tumor ploidy and call (sub)clonal CNAs.
Briefly, Battenberg employs Impute2 [42] with the 1000
Genomes haplotypes as a reference panel to phase het-
erozygous SNPs [43]. Phased SNP B-allele frequency
(BAF) values are then segmented using piecewise con-
stant fitting (PCF) [44], resulting in segmented BAF
values for each segment. Each identified chromosomal
segment is then checked for deviations from clonality
using a standard t-test comparing the fitted BAF value
to that of a clonal solution. Clonal copy number and
Battenberg (sub)clonal copy number analysis results are
included in Additional file 3.
Copy number analysis of DTCs
Copy number analysis of the DTCs was performed as
previously described [40]. The single-cell sequencing
reads were trimmed for putative WGA adapter se-
quences and aligned to the GRCh37 human reference
using
Burrows-Wheeler
Aligner
(BWA)
[45].
LogR
values were calculated for genomic bins of 500,000
uniquely mappable positions, corrected for GC bias, and
segmented using PCF (the penalty parameter, γ, was set
to 25) [44]. Copy number was estimated per segment as
2logR × Ψ, where Ψ is the ploidy of the cell (Additional
file 3). The BAF was calculated for each SNP position
from dbSNP (dbSNP build 135). To measure noise in
the single-cell read-depth profiles, we determined the
median absolute pairwise distance (MAPD) value, which
is a measure of the median distance between two con-
secutive GC-corrected logR data points genome-wide.
Power analysis
The retrospective power analysis was performed in ana-
logy to rarefaction analysis in ecology. The cumulative
number of unique CNAs was plotted as a function of the
cumulative number of single cells, resulting in a saturation
curve. The order of the cells was randomized 100,000
times, and mean and standard deviations were calculated.
If the curve flattens off, a reasonable number of cells have
been sequenced and including more cells is likely to yield
only few additional CNAs/clones. To decrease the influ-
ence of noise, CNAs <5 Mb were excluded. Unique CNAs
were defined as those of which at least one breakpoint
was >5 Mb away from those of another, overlapping CNA
and it had a different total copy number state.
Mutation calling on bulk tumor exomes and subsequent
genotyping in single cells
From the exome sequences of bulk primary tumors and
matched normal samples somatic mutations were called
using MuTect [46] on tumor-normal pairs using only
those reads with a mapping quality ≥30. The resulting
somatic mutations were further filtered against germline
variants present in: 1) any of the bulk normal exomes
from the six patients in this study and a deep sequenced
whole genome from a normal B-lymphoblastoid cell line
(HCC38-BL); 2) an open source project, NGS-logistics,
which provides the frequency for given loci in unrelated
and unaffected individuals [47] and an in-house panel of
350 unrelated and unaffected individuals. Mutations fall-
ing within centromeres or in intergenic regions or re-
peats were discarded as well, as were those with an
allelic fraction <15% or displaying complete strand bias.
Finally, all remaining somatic mutations were visually
validated using IGV [48] and likely false positives were
discarded (Additional file 1: Figure S10). GATK [49] was
used to genotype the primary tumor (or lymph node me-
tastasis) somatic mutations in the single-cell sequences.
One variant called as a somatic mutation by MuTect
was found present in normal cell 107B but was subse-
quently validated to be a germline SNP as follows. DNA
from both blood and tumor from patient MicMa107 was
genotyped using a TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assay
C_175074794_10 (Applied Biosystems by Thermo Fisher
Scientific) in a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System.
The reaction was carried out in 25 μl total volume with
1× TaqMan® Genotyping Master Mix, 1× TaqMan® SNP
Genotyping Assay, and 1.5 ng of DNA. This assay con-
firmed that both tumor and normal cells were heterozy-
gous for this SNP.
Genotyping germline SNPs in single cells and
construction of error models
To assess the power of our approach to detect single nu-
cleotide variants in the single cells, we checked the dis-
tribution of germline heterozygous SNPs in all the
patients and respective cells. In contrast to the somatic
substitutions, which are exclusively detected in the
DTCs, the germline SNPs should be largely uniformly
distributed over all single cells, irrespective of their clas-
sification. We hence constructed a gold standard set of
heterozygous germline SNPs based on those SNPs that
had a B-allele frequency between 0.3 and 0.7 in the
SNP-array data of the matched blood sample and a het-
erozygous genotype in both blood and tumor exomes
(minimum coverage of 10×). We similarly constructed a
gold
standard
set
of
homozygous
germline
SNPs,
selecting those that had a B-allele frequency ≤0.1 or
≥0.9 in the matched blood SNP array data, were homo-
zygous in both blood and tumor exomes (minimum
coverage of 10×), and were located in an area with nor-

 GATK [49] was employed using UnifiedGenotyper with
the –EMIT_ALL_SITES option.
We further leveraged the resulting SNP data to obtain
estimates of the (per cell) false positive and false negative
rates of our approach. The former we define as the de-
tection in a single cell of the alternative allele for a
homozygous reference SNP and is likely due to sequen-
cing or WGA errors, e.g., at position “x” the genotype is
AA (homozygous reference) as observed in the bulk, yet
we find at least one read containing a T (the alternative
allele) in a single cell. Instead, the false negative rate
considers the failure to detect the alternative allele of a
heterozygous SNP due to low coverage or WGA-
induced allelic dropout; e.g., at position “y”, the genotype
is AT (heterozygous) as observed in the bulk, yet we
only find reads reporting A (the reference allele) in the
single cells. The locus dropout rate was computed as the
fraction of gold standard heterozygous SNPs demon-
strating no single-cell sequence coverage.
The estimates can be used to model the observed pat-
terns of detected reference and somatic variant alleles as
deriving from a binomial distribution B(n,p) where n is
the number of loci with coverage (Bernoulli trials) for
that single cell and p is the false positive or false negative
error rate (pfp and pfn). However, to take the uncertainty
on the parameter estimates into account (we have p and
var(p) instead of p), we adopt a beta-binomial model in
which the binomial probability of success p is not fixed
but follows a beta distribution Beta(a, b) such that μ =
p = a/(a + b) and σ2 = var(p) = ab/((a + b)2(a + b + 1)).
We then compute the probability of observing at least
equally extreme patterns of somatic reference and vari-
ant detections given n under the false positive and false
negative models. In case no germline SNP loci in a cell
have a false positive or false negative genotype call, we
employ a worst-case estimate of pfp and pfn by adding,
respectively, one false positive or negative pseudocall.
Reconstructing DTC origins and tumor evolution
Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the clonal and
subclonal aberrations called by Battenberg on the tumor
bulk SNP-array data. Nodes in the trees correspond to
detected (sub)clones and are placed according to their
estimated cancer cell fraction (CCF; the fraction of can-
cer cells carrying the specific aberration) so as to satisfy
the pigeonhole principle, as previously described [4]. Ap-
plied to CCFs, the pigeonhole principle dictates that if
two CNAs have a CCF >0.5, then there must exist at
least a subset of cancer cells that contains both aberra-
tions. Therefore, the smaller subclone (lower CCF) must
be nested in the larger (higher CCF) and both are collin-
ear on the phylogenetic tree. Including the DTCs in tree
construction allowed for extensive refinement by reveal-
ing shared and mutually exclusive CNAs, resulting in
linear (e.g., patient MicMa083) and branching (e.g., pa-
tient MicMa107) trees.
