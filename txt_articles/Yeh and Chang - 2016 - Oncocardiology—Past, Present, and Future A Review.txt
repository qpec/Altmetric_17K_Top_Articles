Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Oncocardiology is a medical discipline that focuses on the identification, 
prevention, and treatment of cardiovascular complications related to cancer therapy. This 
discipline has gained interest from the cardiology community in recent years because of a 
remarkable increase in the number of cancer survivors and the proliferation of new cancer 
therapies causing cardiovascular complications, such as hypertension, heart failure, vascular 
complications, and cardiac arrhythmia. In this review, we provide historical perspectives, highlight 
new discoveries, and speculate on the opportunity created by merging the research interests and 
clinical practices of cardiology and oncology.
OBSERVATIONS—The old paradigm of anthracycline cardiotoxic effects is replaced by new 
insights that anthracycline targets topoisomerase II β to cause DNA double-strand breaks and a 
profound change in the transcriptome leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species and the 
development of mitochondriopathy. Prevention of anthracycline cardiotoxic effects should be 
based on inhibiting or degrading topoisomerase II β. New challenges were posed by the 
introduction of trastuzumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors that revolutionized cancer therapy. The 
on-target cardiotoxic effects of trastuzumab were owing to a prosurvival benefit of Her2 that binds 
to neuregulin, whereas the off-target effect of multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be 
mediated by disruption of the vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway or the stress-
induced angiogenesis. Sensitive imaging techniques, such as global strain, and biomarkers have 
allowed for early detection of cardiotoxic effects. Early treatment with heart failure medications 
may be beneficial in preventing the development of late cardiotoxic effects.

 CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Close collaboration between cardiologists and 
oncologists is required to meet the demand of an increasing number of cancer survivors. New 
insights based on mechanistic studies or genetic discoveries will pave the way for better 
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer therapy-induced cardiovascular complications.
We will discuss the old problem of anthracycline cardiotoxic effects with new insights, the 
new challenge of anti-HER2 cardiotoxic effects, the off-target effect of targeted therapies, 
and the development of a new clinical discipline, oncocardiology.
New Insights in Anthracycline Induced Cardiotoxic Effects
Daunorubicin, the first anthracycline isolated from cultures of Streptomycespeucetius, was 
reported in 1963 by French and Italian researchers (Table 1).1,2 An early clinical study3 
showed that pediatric patients with leukemia could achieve partial or complete hematologic 
remission from a single dose of daunorubicin; moreover, prolonged remission could be 
obtained by maintenance therapy. However, patients of-ten developed heart failure with 
maintenance daunorubicin therapy (Table 2). In a retrospective analysis,4 the cumulative 
probability of congestive heart failure (CHF) was shown to be dependent on the cumulative 
dose of doxorubicin. Long-term follow-up data5 from adult survivors of childhood cancer 
showed that upto 30% of patients treated with doxorubicin had signs of cardiac dysfunction 
when more sensitive detection techniques were used.
Doxorubicin targets topoisomerase II to block DNA replication.6 Because cardiomyocytes 
were considered to be terminally differentiated, researchers believed that doxorubicin could 
not cause cardiotoxic effects by inhibiting DNA replication. Therefore, the reactive oxygen 
species (ROS)/iron hypothesis was proposed because doxorubicin is capable of causing 
redox changes in an iron-dependent manner to produce highly toxic hydroxyl radicals.7,8 
Thus, inhibition of ROS formation and iron chelation were tested as strategies to prevent 
doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxic effects. Although N-acetylcysteine was effective in 
quenching ROS in tissue cultures, it was not effective inpreventing doxorubicin-induced 
cardiotoxic effects.9 Furthermore, iron chelation failed to prevent doxorubicin-induced 
cardiotoxic effects in an animal model.10 Remarkably, dexrazoxane, the only effective 
protect antagainst doxorubicin cardiotoxic effects, was shown to be acatalytic inhibitor of 
topoisomerase II.11
There are 2 topoisomerase II isozymes. Topoisomerase II a, highly expressed in cancer cells 
and required for cell division, is the target for anthracycline’s antitumor effect.12,13 
However, adult cardiomyocytes express only topoisomerase II β, which is not required for 
cell division.14 Since dexrazoxane binds to topoisomerase II β and inhibits doxorubicin-
induced DNA double-strand break, it is likely that doxorubicin causes cardiotoxic effects by 
targeting topoisomerase II β. We generated a mouse model in which topoisomerase II β 
could be genetically deleted in adult cardiomyocytes and showed that both doxorubicin-
induced DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis were blunted.15
Doxorubicin also causes a profound change in the transcriptome of cardiomyocytes because 
topoisomerase II β/doxorubicin binds to selective promoters to regulate gene transcription.

 cardiomyocytes with intact topoisomerase II β. This explains why doxorubicin-induced ROS 
production is dependent on topoisomerase II β. Interestingly, peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor- coactivator1a (PGC1a) and PGC1β, 2 key transcription factors important 
to mitochondrial biogenesis, are also decreased in the doxorubicin-treated cardiomyocytes. 
As a result, mitochondrial electron transport proteins are decreased. Electron microscopy of 
heart samples showed classic histological changes in the mitochondria of cardiomyocytes 
treated with doxorubicin, but not in topoisomerase II β-depleted cardiomyocytes. Together, 
these findings show that topoisomerase II β is the molecular basis of anthracycline-induced 
cardiotoxic effects. This new paradigm retains the old observation of doxorubicin-induced 
ROS generation and mitochondriopathy but explains them in terms of topoisomerase II β 
(Figure).15,16
The identification of topoisomerase II β as the molecular basis of anthracycline-induced 
cardiotoxic effects leads to 3 useful predictions. First, a new anthracycline specific for 
topoisomerase II a, but not for topoisomerase II β, should have antitumor activity but no 
cardiotoxic effects. Second, determining a patient’s topoisomerase II β expression level may 
be useful in predicting the patient’s susceptibility to anthracycline-induced cardiotoxic 
effects before chemotherapy is initiated. Finally, inhibition of topoisomerase II β should be 
the most effective strategy to prevent anthracycline-induced cardiotoxic effects.17 However, 
an early clinical trial showed that patients who received dexrazoxane and doxorubicin had 
reduced objective response rate, but time to progression and survival were not different 
compared with placebo and doxorubicin.18 Thus, the US Food and Drug Administration 
limited the use of dexrazoxane to metastatic breast cancer patients who have already 
received 300mg/m2 of doxorubicin. Since doxorubicin causes subclinical cardiac damage 
even at low doses, the use of dexrazoxane in patients who have received more than 300 
mg/m2 of doxorubicin is clearly too late. With the new understanding of the pathogenesis of 
anthracycline-induced cardiotoxic effects, further clinical trials of dexrazoxane in 
cardioprotection is warranted.
Harnessing the Cardiotoxic Effects of Anti-HER2 Therapy
Cancer treatment underwent a remarkable revolution in 1998 with the approval of 
trastuzumab (herceptin) for the treatment of meta-static ERBB2 (HER2)-positive breast 
cancer.19 ERBB2 belongs to the family of human epidermal growth factor receptors 
(EGFRs). In cancer cells, amplified ERBB2 binds to ERBB3 to form an oncogenic ERBB2/
ERBB3 complex.20 Trastuzumab inhibits ERBB2/ERBB3 dimerization by binding to 
domain 4 of ERBB2 to block phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase signaling. However, ERBB2 is 
also expressed on cardiomyocytes and deletion of ERBB2 gene in the cardiomyocytes led to 
development of dilated cardiomyopathy in the mouse model.21,22 In cell cultures, adult rat 
ventricular myocytes (ARVMs) treated with doxorubicin showed a concentration-dependent 
increase in myofilament disarray. Concomitant treatment of myocytes with anti-ERBB2 and 
doxorubicin caused a significant increase in myofibrillar disarray compared with 
doxorubicin treatment alone.23 Furthermore, HER2/ERBB2-deleted cardiomyocytes were 
more sensitive to doxorubicin.22 Thus, trastuzumab has the potential to cause cardiotoxic 
effects with or without doxorubicin.

 In the pivotal trastuzumab trial,19 New York Heart Association class 3 or 4 heart failure was 
observed in 27% of patients receiving anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, and trastuzumab; in 
8% of patients given an anthracycline or cyclophosphamide alone; in 13% of patients given 
combined paclitaxel and trastuzumab; and in 1% of patients given paclitaxel alone. Thus, 
trastuzumab can induce cardiotoxic effects by itself, and the severity of these effects is 
compounded by concomitant use of anthracycline.19 The alarming incidence of cardiotoxic 
effects prompted a call to more cautious use of trastuzumab.24
The high incidence of heart failure in the metastatic breast cancer trial19 prompted institution 
of intensive cardiac monitoring in the subsequent adjuvant trials. Newer clinical trials25 
avoiding concomitant use of anthracycline and trastuzumab had much lower incidences of 
heart failure. The manifestation of cardiotoxic effects is different between anthracyclines and 
trastuzumab. Cardiac biopsy of trastuzumab-treated patients did not reveal the classic 
changes of myofibril disarray and mitochondriopathy associated with anthracycline 
cardiotoxic effects. Clinically, trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxic effects also differ from 
anthracycline-induced cardiotoxic effects. In contrast to cardiotoxic effects induced by 
anthracycline, trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxic effects is not dose-related; it is often 
reversible with cessation of therapy and initiation of conventional heart failure therapy.26 
Furthermore, rechallenge with trastuzumab is generally well tolerated.
Other anti-HER2 therapies have been developed that showed less cardiotoxic effects. T-DM1 
is trastuzumab linked to an antimicrotubule drug, emtansine.27 No significant cardiotoxic 
effects were observed with T-DM1 in patients previously treated with trastuzumab and a 
taxane.28 Pertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody binding to domain 2 of ERBB2 to inhibit 
ligand-dependent ERBB2 dimerization.29 Pertuzumab prolongs the survival of patients 
diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer when added to trastuzumab and anthracyclines.30 In 
clinical trials, pertuzumab has emerged as a safe drug, with little or no cardiac toxic effects.
31 Thus, we have learned to harness the toxicity of anti-HER2 therapy, by intensive 
monitoring, by avoiding concomitant use of anthracyclines, and by introducing antibody 
targeting a different domain of ERBB2.
Targeted Therapy With Off-Target Effects
Another major advance in cancer treatment was the approval of imatinib (Gleevec) in 2001 
for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia.32 Imatinib, an inhibitor of BCR-Abl, 
was touted as a magic bullet in cancer therapy and heralded the development of a large 
number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in clinical use today.33 Some of these TKIs have 
specific targets, whereas others can target multiple kinases. Thus, off-target effects can result 
in off-target toxic effects. For example, Force et al33 reported 10 patients who developed 
severe CHF while receiving imatinib therapy and showed that imatinib-treated mice 
developed left ventricular contractile dysfunction.34 A more extensive review35 of patients 
treated with imatinib showed that, of 1276 patients, only 22 (1.7%) developed systolic heart 
failure; of these 22 patients, 11 continued to receive imatinib therapy with dose adjustments 
and were monitored for CHF symptoms without further complications. Thus, the initial 
report of potential cardiotoxic effects of TKIs needs to be validated by larger clinical trials,

 and early identification of toxicity or dose-reduction may allow a lifesaving drug to remain 
on the market.36
Sunitinib, approved for treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal 
stromal tumors, caused hypertension in 47% of treated patients and CHF in 8% in a small 
study37 of 75 patients. In a larger meta-analysis38 of 6935 patients, the incidence of all-grade 
and high-grade CHF in patients treated with sunitinib was 4.1% and 1.5%, respectively. 
Congestive heart failure was reversible by withholding sunitinib therapy and/or initiation of 
heart failure therapy in 56% of patients in a retrospective adjudication of comprehensive 
cardiovascular adverse events from 2 phase 3 trials.39 Sunitinib is a multikinase inhibitor 
that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs), fibroblast growth factor 
receptors, and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs). Thus, it is not surprising 
that hypertension can result from inhibition of multiple receptors involved in the 
homeostasis of the vasculature.40 In an animal model, PDGFR-β is required for 
cardiomyocytes to respond to stress-induced cardiac angiogenesis.41 Mice that underwent 
cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of PDGFR-β developed heart failure when exposed to load-
induced stress, such as hypertension. Thus, hypertension and heart failure caused by 
sunitinib and other TKIs that target the VEGF signaling pathway can be explained 
mechanistically and prevented by aggressive treatment of hypertension.42
Recently, ponatinib (iclusig), a TKI approved for imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous 
leukemia, was pulled from the market temporarily owing to a 27% incidence of arterial and 
venous thrombosis or occlusion.43 However, ponatinib was shown to inhibit platelet 
aggregate formation in whole blood under shear stress.44 Similar to ponatinib, nilotinib has 
also been associated with increased incidence of arterial and venous thrombosis. Further 
studies are needed to clarify the mechanism of action contributing to accelerated 
atherosclerosis and thromboembolism in patients treated with ponatinib and nilotinib. 
Regardless of the mechanism of vascular toxic effects, careful modification of cardiac risk 
factors and close follow-up are required in patients treated with selected TKIs, especially 
TKIs targeting the VEGF signaling pathway.40 It is clear that the off-target effects of TKIs 
provide an opportunity for both basic and translational research in our field.
An Emerging Field: Cardiologist Collaborating With Oncologist
The use of targeted therapy in the past 15 years has converted several cancers from a 
terminal illnesses to a chronic diseases, vastly increasing the number of cancer survivors. In 
2012, there were 12 million cancer survivors in the United States. This number is estimated 
to double by the end of the next decade.45 Among cancer survivors, half will die of cancer 
recurrence, but a third will die of cardiovascular disease. Thus, the need for optimal cardiac 
care in the cancer population has become evident. Chemotherapy can cause myriad 
cardiovascular complications, including hypertension, CHF, thromboembolic diseases, 
ischemic heart disease, QT prolongation, and bradycardia.46 Radiation therapy can cause 
acute complications, such as pericarditis and long-term complications, such as accelerated 
coronary artery disease, valvular disease, and restrictive or constrictive pericarditis.47 Thus, 
cardiologists could play a pivotal role in the care of cancer patients undergoing 
chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

 Early detection of cardiotoxic effects requires timely imaging studies and monitoring with 
biomarkers. Determining left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with the use of 
noninvasive techniques, such as echocardiography or multiplegated acquisition (MUGA) 
scanning, during chemotherapy is recommended by all guidelines.48,49 Because of radiation 
exposure, echocardiography is generally preferred in cardiac monitoring over MUGA 
scanning. In a large population-based study50 of patients diagnosed with breast cancer aged 
66 years or older, adequate cardiac monitoring was obtained in only 36% of patients. In a 
retrospective study,51 early detection of LVEF reduction followed by intervention was shown 
to improve long-term outcome. A recent consensus from the American Society of 
Echocardiography (ASE) went beyond LVEF to recommend monitoring of global 
longitudinal strain (GLS).48,52 Although GLS is more sensitive than LVEF, technical 
limitations and general availability may not allow for this measurement to be used for all 
cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Both the ASE and the European Society for 
Medical Oncology recommended troponin for detection of early signs of cardiotoxic effects 
during chemotherapy.49 A combination of troponin and GLS could be a more powerful 
predictor of early cardiotoxic effects.52 Further studies are required to determine the best 
frequency of monitoring during chemotherapy.
In the past decade, cardiologists have carried out multiple small clinical studies with drugs 
used in heart failure therapy, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), 
angiotensin II receptor blockers, or β-blockers (BB), to provide either primary or secondary 
prevention for anthracycline-induced cardiotoxic effects.53–56 Many of these studies showed 
benefit; however, the short-term benefits may have been owing to changes in hemodynamics, 
not a result of true cardioprotection. Larger and more long-term clinical studies are required 
to demonstrate true efficacy. This is important because in a pediatric study, the short-term 
benefit of ACEIs disappeared with long-term follow-up.57 However, ACEIs in this study 
may not show efficacy because the drug was started a median of 8 years after chemotherapy. 
Taken together, the best evidence for primary prevention of anthracycline-induced 
cardiotoxic effects is dexrazoxane based on its mechanism of action.11,15 At present, ACEIs, 
BB, aldosterone antagonists, or statin cannot be recommended in primary prevention owing 
to insufficient evidence.
Because cancer is usually a criterion for exclusion in cardiovascular trials, there is a paucity 
of evidence-based recommendations for diagnosing, preventing, and treating cancer therapy-
induced cardiovascular complications. A number of guidelines have been published, based 
primarily on a consensus of committee members.48,49 However, these guidelines are not 
routinely followed by clinicians. We must carry out clinical studies and establish registries to 
address specific issues that are pertinent to our unique practice rather than relying on 
consensus or inadequate clinical studies. Furthermore, oncocardiology is not limited to 
clinical studies; basic research exemplified by the discovery of the molecular target for 
anthracycline-induced cardiotoxic effects provides a new playing field for physicians and 
scientists.15 The National Institutes of Health has conducted a workshop, published a white 
paper, and established a funding mechanism (PA-16-035, PA-16-036) for the study of basic 
and clinical research relevant to oncocardiology.58

 In a study59 of childhood cancer survivors, the overall mortality ratio was 8.3-fold higher 
and the cardiovascular mortality ratio was 5-fold higher in cancer survivors than in the 
general population. In another large study60 that compared childhood cancer survivors with 
their siblings, the cumulative incidence of coronary artery disease, CHF, valvular disease, 
and arrhythmia in survivors by age 45 years was much higher than those found in their 
siblings. Cancer therapy greatly accelerates the development of cardiovascular diseases, 
which can be reduced by lowering the intensity of radiation therapy and anthracycline 
exposure.61 Further improvement in quality of life in cancer survivors can be achieved 
through exercise, weight control, dietary discretion, and complementary medicine.62
Recent advances in oncology are rapidly developing personalized cancer therapies based on 
the identification of driver mutations and the application of targeted therapy. We may be able 
to identify the driver mutations that cause cardiotoxic effects in susceptible individuals to 
make decisions on anticancer drug choices. For example, patients with high topoisomerase 
2β levels in peripheral blood may be more susceptible to anthracycline-induced cardiotoxic 
effects. In these high-risk patients, we can consider nonanthracycline alternatives or provide 
early cardioprotection with dexrazoxane. With better understanding of the genetics of dilated 
cardiomyopathies, we may consider patients with positive family history or with susceptible 
genes to be at high risk for developing cancer therapy-induced cardiotoxic effects. These 
patients should be monitored closely and treated with less aggressive radiation or 
chemotherapy. These are exciting challenges and opportunities that will test the ingenuity 
and persistence of the next generation of oncocardiologists.

 Figure. Doxorubicin Induces DNA Double-Strand Breaks Though Inhibition of Topoisomerase 
2β, Activating the Apoptotic Program
Doxorubicin-bound topoisomerase II β also binds to promoters of genes encoding PGC-1 
and antioxidative enzymes, causing mitochondriopathy and an increase in reactive oxygen 
species (ROS).
