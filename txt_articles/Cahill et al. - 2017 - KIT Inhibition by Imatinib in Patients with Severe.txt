Abstract
BACKGROUND—Mast cells are present in the airways of patients who have severe asthma 
despite glucocorticoid treatment; these cells are associated with disease characteristics including 
poor quality of life and inadequate asthma control. Stem cell factor and its receptor, KIT, are 
central to mast-cell homeostasis. We conducted a proof-of-principle trial to evaluate the effect of 
imatinib, a KIT inhibitor, on airway hyper-responsiveness, a physiological marker of severe 
asthma, as well as on airway mast-cell numbers and activation in patients with severe asthma.
METHODS—We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-week trial of 
imatinib in patients with poorly controlled severe asthma who had airway hyperresponsiveness 
despite receiving maximal medical therapy. The primary end point was the change in airway 
hyperresponsiveness, measured as the concentration of methacholine required to decrease the 
forced expiratory volume in 1 second by 20% (PC20). Patients also underwent bronchoscopy.
RESULTS—Among the 62 patients who underwent randomization, imatinib treatment reduced 
airway hyperresponsiveness to a greater extent than did placebo. At 6 months, the methacholine 
PC20 increased by a mean (±SD) of 1.73±0.60 doubling doses in the imatinib group, as compared 
with 1.07±0.60 doubling doses in the placebo group (P = 0.048). Imatinib also reduced levels of 
serum tryptase, a marker of mast-cell activation, to a greater extent than did placebo (decrease of 
2.02±2.32 vs. 0.56±1.39 ng per milliliter, P = 0.02). Airway mast-cell counts declined in both 
groups. Muscle cramps and hypophosphatemia were more common in the imatinib group than in 
the placebo group.

 CONCLUSIONS—In patients with severe asthma, imatinib decreased airway 
hyperresponsiveness, mast-cell counts, and tryptase release. These results suggest that KIT-
dependent processes and mast cells contribute to the pathobiologic basis of severe asthma. 
(Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
NCT01097694.)
MANY PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ASTHMA do not have adequate disease control despite 
the use of high-dose inhaled or systemic glucocorticoids.1 Severe asthma is associated with 
airway hyperresponsiveness — that is, an exaggerated response to a bronchoconstrictor 
stimulus — and airway inflammation, both of which persist despite high-dose glucocorticoid 
therapy.2,3 Increased airway hyper-responsiveness is associated with a progressive loss of 
lung function,4 and, among patients with moderate-to-severe asthma, those with airway 
hyperresponsiveness have a poorer quality of life than those without this trait.5 In addition, 
studies have shown that treatment targeting airway hyperresponsiveness leads to more 
effective control of asthma6 and reductions in airway remodeling.7
Mast cells are long-lived, tissue-dwelling, hematopoietic effector cells that are implicated in 
the pathobiologic basis of asthma8 and can persist in the face of glucocorticoid therapy.9 
Their presence correlates with airway hyper-responsiveness and asthma disease severity.9,10
Stem cell factor and its receptor, the KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase (hereafter 
referred to as KIT), are essential for normal mast-cell development and survival in the 
tissues.11 Levels of soluble stem cell factor are increased in the serum of patients with 
asthma and correlate with asthma severity.12 Imatinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of 
KIT13,14 and, as a consequence, markedly reduces bone marrow mast-cell numbers and 
serum tryptase levels in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia15 and reduces serum 
tryptase levels in patients with pulmonary hypertension.16 Tryptase, a mast-cell granule–
associated protease, is a marker of mast-cell burden and activation when detected in 
extracellular fluids. Tryptase levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of patients 
with difficult-to-control asthma exceed those in patients with well-controlled asthma.17 
Therefore, we conducted a proof-of-principle trial, involving patients who have severe 
asthma and airway hyperresponsiveness despite treatment with maximal conventional 
therapy, to test the hypothesis that KIT inhibition, achieved with the use of imatinib, would 
improve airway hyper-responsiveness and decrease airway mast-cell counts and activation.
METHODS
TRIAL DESIGN AND OVERSIGHT
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-principle trial in 
seven academic centers in the United States from November 2010 through July 2015. The 
screening and run-in period lasted for a minimum of 4 weeks, after which the patients were 
randomly assigned to a 24-week intervention period. Randomization was performed 
centrally by the Brigham and Women’s Hospital investigational drug pharmacy. Novartis 
provided imatinib tablets in bulk free of charge, and the imatinib and placebo were prepared 
and packaged by the Brigham and Women’s Hospital investigational drug pharmacy. 
Novartis reviewed the protocol and the manuscript before initial submission but had no other

 role in the trial. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and the 
fidelity of the trial to the protocol, which is available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org.
The patients were stratified according to their use of omalizumab and then were randomly 
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the imatinib group or the placebo group. The details of the trial 
design, screening, and randomization are shown in Figure 1. This trial was approved by the 
institutional review board at each study site. All the patients provided written informed 
consent.
PATIENTS
We enrolled patients 18 to 65 years of age who had severe, refractory asthma that was not 
controlled despite continuous treatment with inhaled beclomethasone at a dose higher than 
960 μg per day or equivalent and at least one additional controller medication. To be eligible 
for participation, patients were required to have score on the six-item Asthma Control 
Questionnaire (ACQ-6) of at least 1.5 (scores range from 0 to 6, with lower values denoting 
better control; minimally important difference, 0.5)18,19 and a provocative concentration of 
methacholine causing a decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 20% 
(PC20) that was 10 mg per milliliter or lower. Additional inclusion criteria were an FEV1 
that was at least 40% of the predicted value and adherence of at least 80% to peak flow and 
diary recordings during the screening period. The full inclusion and exclusion criteria are 
provided in the protocol.
INTERVENTIONS
The patients were randomly assigned to receive imatinib or placebo once daily. Imatinib 
treatment was initiated at an oral dose of 200 mg per day for 2 weeks, after which the dose 
was increased to 400 mg per day, which is the dose that has been shown to inhibit the KIT 
receptor.20 During the trial period, the patients underwent prerandomization bronchoscopy 
with airway biopsy, which was repeated at week 24 of the intervention period (Table S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org).
OUTCOMES
The primary outcome was the change in airway hyperresponsiveness, assessed as PC20, from 
baseline to 3 and 6 months of therapy in the imatinib group as compared with the 
corresponding changes in the control group. We also assessed other physiological and 
patient-reported measures of asthma control as secondary outcomes, as detailed in the 
protocol, including FEV1, peak expiratory flow, the number and localization of mast cells in 
the endobronchial-biopsy samples, tryptase levels in serum and BAL fluid, and asthma-
related quality of life. For exploratory prespecified analyses in the imatinib group, we 
examined, in a correlative manner, the relationship of changes in airway 
hyperresponsiveness and FEV1 to neutrophil and eosinophil counts in BAL fluid; tryptase-
positive mast-cell counts in total airway and smooth-muscle endobronchial-biopsy samples; 
eosinophil counts in blood; levels of the mast-cell–related mediators histamine, 
prostaglandin D2, and cysteinyl leukotrienes in BAL fluid; and levels of cysteinyl 
leukotriene E4 and prostaglandin D2 metabolite in urine.

 MEASUREMENTS
Allergy skin testing was performed with the use of the Multi-Test II device (Lincoln 
Diagnostics). The fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) (NIOX MINO, Aerocrine) and 
patient-reported outcomes (the ACQ-6, the Asthma Quality-of-Life Questionnaire [AQLQ; 
scores range from 1 to 7, with higher values denoting better quality of life; minimally 
important difference, 0.5], and the Asthma Symptom Utility Index [ASUI, an assessment of 
asthma symptoms and treatment side effects weighted according to patient preferences; 
scores range from 0 to 1.0, with higher scores indicating better control of symptoms and side 
effects; minimally important difference, 0.09]) were assessed with the use of validated 
instruments and measures.18,19,21–23 Asthma exacerbations were defined as an increase in 
asthma symptoms leading to an emergency department visit or hospitalization, initiation of 
oral glucocorticoid treatment in the patients who were not regularly taking oral 
glucocorticoids, or a doubling or an increase of 10 mg per day in the dose of glucocorticoids 
in the patients who were regularly taking glucocorticoids.
Biologic fluids were assessed for the mast-cell activation markers tryptase, histamine, 
cysteinyl leukotrienes, and prostaglandin D2.24–26 Computed tomographic (CT) assessment 
of airway-wall thickness was performed with the use of three-dimensional multidetector CT 
methods in conjunction with advanced image-processing tools. Airway-wall area and 
thickness percentages were calculated as previously reported.27 Details of the above 
methods are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The primary outcome was the between-group difference in the change in airway 
hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. We compared the change in log-transformed 
methacholine reactivity (PC20) in the imatinib group versus the change in the placebo group 
from baseline at months 3 and 6. We used a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis for 
comparisons between the groups. The primary analysis was performed with the use of a 
modified per-protocol population, which included all randomly assigned patients for whom 
there was at least one postbaseline observation. The target enrollment was 60 patients, under 
the assumption of a 10% dropout rate, which would result in 54 patients completing the trial; 
this provided 80% power to detect a doubling-dose change in PC20. We also used a linear 
model to assess, as secondary outcomes, differences in the mean change from baseline 
between the groups (with adjustment for baseline values) in physiological and patient-
reported outcomes. We compared FEV1 with a mixed model to assess the between-group 
difference in the change from baseline over weeks 8 through 24. Values are reported as 
means and standard deviations unless otherwise noted. The Spearman’s correlation 
coefficient was used to assess the association between specified variables. SAS software, 
version 9.4 (SAS Institute), was used to perform these analyses.

A total of 176 potential participants were screened, 62 of whom underwent randomization 
per protocol (32 in the imatinib group and 30 in the placebo group) and 50 of whom

 completed the trial (Fig. 1). The baseline characteristics of the patients who underwent 
randomization are summarized in Table 1. There were no significant differences in baseline 
characteristics between the groups. A total of 12 patients discontinued participation in the 
trial, 5 of whom stopped because of adverse events (Fig. 1B).
PRIMARY OUTCOME
Imatinib reduced airway reactivity to a greater extent than did placebo. Imatinib increased 
the methacholine PC20 by a mean (±SD) of 1.20±0.52 doubling doses from baseline to 
month 3 (P = 0.03) and by 1.73±0.60 doubling doses from baseline to month 6 (P = 0.008), 
as compared with increases of 0.03±0.42 (P = 0.94) and 1.07±0.60 (P = 0.08) doubling 
doses, respectively, in the placebo group (P = 0.048 for the difference between imatinib and 
placebo over the course of the trial) (Fig. 2).
SECONDARY OUTCOMES
Imatinib reduced the evidence of mast-cell activity. At baseline, the mean tryptase level in 
serum was 4.75±2.59 ng per milliliter in the imatinib group and 4.86±2.13 ng per milliliter 
in the placebo group. The total tryptase level in serum decreased by 2.02±2.32 ng per 
milliliter (42.7±31.6%) in the imatinib group, as compared with 0.56±1.39 ng per milliliter 
(11.5±31.0%) in the placebo group (P = 0.02 for the between-group difference in the change 
from baseline) (Fig. 3). Tryptase levels in BAL fluid tended to decrease with imatinib, 
whereas they increased with placebo (a decrease from 1.34±2.19 to 0.60±0.86 ng per 
milliliter in the imatinib group vs. an increase from 0.96±0.91 to 1.39±2.2 ng per milliliter in 
the placebo group, P = 0.12 for the between-group difference in the change from baseline) 
(Table 2). Total and smooth muscle–associated mast-cell counts in endobronchial-biopsy 
samples had decreased in both groups, with a non-significant trend toward a greater 
reduction in the imatinib group (Table 2).
Although results of airway reversibility tests were not among the criteria used when patients 
were screened for the trial, at week 24 there was a difference of 46 ml (95% confidence 
interval, 36 to 56) in the change from baseline in mean FEV1 between the imatinib group 
and the placebo group (P = 0.04) (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The patients 
who were treated with imatinib had numerically fewer asthma exacerbations, greater 
reductions in airway-wall thickness, higher morning and evening peak expiratory flows, and 
greater improvements in patient-reported outcomes as assessed by the ACQ-6,18 AQLQ,19 
and ASUI22 than did the patients who received placebo, but none of the differences were 
significant (Table 2). There were no significant differences between imatinib and placebo 
with regard to effects on eosinophil counts in peripheral blood and BAL fluid, FeNO, urinary 
leukotriene E4 or prostaglandin D2 metabolite levels, or cysteinyl leukotriene, prostaglandin 
D2, or histamine levels in BAL fluid (Table 2).
A total of 27 secondary outcome measures were prespecified in the protocol; we report data 
for 21 of these outcomes in this article and in the Supplementary Appendix. The data and 
status for all primary and secondary outcomes are available at ClinicalTrials.gov (https://
clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT01097694).

 TERTIARY ANALYSES
In the imatinib group, decreases in airway hyper-responsiveness were inversely correlated 
with baseline peripheral-blood eosinophil counts (r2 = 0.218, P = 0.03). We found a 
nonsignificant trend toward correlation between reductions in total airway mast-cell counts 
and increases in FEV1 (r2 = 0.163, P = 0.06) (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Increases in FEV1 were positively correlated with baseline BAL neutrophil counts (r2 = 
0.441, P = 0.003). We found no correlation between changes in airway hyperresponsiveness 
or FEV1 and baseline eosinophil counts in BAL fluid, tryptase-positive mast-cell counts in 
endobronchial-biopsy samples of total airway and smooth muscle, or levels of the mast cell–
related mediators histamine, prostaglandin D2, and cysteinyl leukotrienes.
SAFETY
The number of total and severe adverse events did not differ significantly between the 
groups (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Imatinib was associated with a higher 
likelihood of muscle cramps and metabolic abnormalities, specifically hypophosphatemia. 
Two patients in the imatinib group discontinued participation in the trial because of adverse 
events (neutropenia in one patient and leg cramps in the other) that were thought by 
investigators, who were unaware of the study-group assignments, to be related to the study 
agent (Fig. 1B). Overall, 7 severe adverse events were reported in three patients during 
imatinib therapy, and 10 severe adverse events were reported in five patients who received 
placebo. When asthma exacerbations were not counted as severe adverse events, there were 
5 events in the imatinib group and 3 in the placebo group (Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
DISCUSSION
Patients with severe asthma often have airway hyperresponsiveness and poor disease control 
despite the use of high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids and additional controller medications. 
They have a high airway mast-cell burden — a feature linked to airway hyperresponsiveness 
— as compared with patients with milder asthma,3,28 which suggests a possible 
pathobiologic role for mast cells in these patients. In this proof-of-principle trial, we sought 
to determine whether inhibition of KIT could reduce the mast-cell burden and thereby 
reduce the airway hyperresponsiveness and secondary outcomes associated with clinical 
asthma. We used the KIT inhibitor imatinib to treat patients who had severe, poorly 
controlled asthma and methacholine reactivity despite receiving maximum guideline-
directed therapy.29
We found that imatinib reduced total serum tryptase levels to a greater extent than did 
placebo, a finding consistent with decreases in mast-cell numbers and possibly with 
reductions in mast-cell activation. Imatinib also tended to reduce the tryptase levels in BAL 
fluid, whereas the levels increased slightly in the placebo group. At the same time, imatinib 
decreased airway hyper-responsiveness and produced a small but significant increase in 
FEV1.

 The effect of imatinib on airway hyperresponsiveness was apparent at 3 months, at which 
point the increase in methacholine PC20 was more than 1 doubling dose greater in the 
imatinib group than in the placebo group; 1 doubling dose is considered a clinically 
important difference for an individual patient.6 Airway hyperresponsiveness continued to 
decrease during the next 3 months, such that at the end of the trial, the PC20 in the imatinib 
group had increased to 330% of the baseline value. Airway hyperresponsiveness also began 
to decrease in the placebo group after 3 months. This improvement is consistent with the 
delayed long-term improvement in airway hyperresponsiveness in response to treatment with 
inhaled glucocorticoids that has been noted by others30 and may be due to persistent 
adherence in both the imatinib group and the placebo group as a result of the patients’ 
participation in the trial.
We noted that increases in FEV1 in the imatinib group tended to correlate with reductions in 
endobronchial mast-cell counts, a trend that was not observed in the placebo group. 
Although the increase in FEV1 may not seem substantial, it suggests that mast-cell–
dependent processes contribute to airway obstruction in these patients despite high-dose 
antiinflammatory glucocorticoid therapy. The near-50-ml difference in the change from 
baseline in FEV1 between the imatinib and placebo groups is small, but it is likely to be 
important in light of the population we studied. The patients in our trial population had less 
than half the baseline bronchodilator response of patients who are enrolled in most trials of 
new biologic agents,31 and 50 ml was proportionately half the response shown in those 
trials.31
It is important to highlight the fact that mast cells can survive for months to years in tissue 
and that their numbers are increased in states of inflammation. Our data (tryptase levels and 
endobronchial-biopsy mast-cell counts) show that 6 months of imatinib therapy reduced but 
did not completely eliminate mast-cell counts in the airways of patients with severe asthma. 
Data from studies of other diseases have shown that treatment with imatinib for more than 1 
year reduces numbers of resident mast cells more than do shorter durations of treatment.15 
Thus, larger and perhaps longer clinical trials will be required in order to understand 
whether specific mast-cell–targeted therapies will be clinically effective.
In addition to effecting classical IgE-mediated activation, mast cells can also serve as 
effectors of innate and type 1 immune mechanisms and can amplify airway 
hyperresponsiveness, airway remodeling, and neutrophilic airway inflammation in animal 
models.32 In exploratory analyses, the decrease in airway hyperresponsiveness associated 
with imatinib was negatively correlated with baseline blood eosinophil counts, and baseline 
numbers of neutrophils in BAL fluid were strongly correlated with increases in FEV1 (r2 = 
0.441, P = 0.003). Together, these findings support a role for mast cells in noneosinophilic 
asth ma. Since almost half of the patients with severe asthma have neutrophilic airway 
inflammation,33 we speculate that KIT inhibition might represent an important approach to 
treatment for this group.
Several caveats need to be considered. It is possible that some of the positive effects seen in 
this trial are not related to mast-cell inhibition. KIT is expressed by both group 2 and group 
3 innate lymphoid cells, which can produce cytokines that drive eosinophilic and

 neutrophilic inflammation, respectively.34–36 Imatinib also inhibits platelet-derived growth 
factor receptor signal transduction, which can mediate airway smooth-muscle proliferation 
and contractility.37 It is also possible that the effect we found with regard to airway 
hyperresponsiveness will not translate into a clinical benefit in larger studies.
Imatinib was associated with adverse effects that resolved with discontinuation of treatment. 
The side-effect profile of this particular KIT inhibitor needs to be taken into account in the 
design of larger and longer trials of this therapeutic strategy in patients with severe asthma.
In conclusion, this proof-of-principle trial showed that antagonism of KIT and decreases in 
mast-cell counts were associated with reductions in airway hyperresponsiveness and small 
increases in FEV1 in a group of patients with severe asthma who were already taking 
maximal therapy. These data are not clinically directive, but they set the stage for follow-up 
studies targeting mast cells in patients with severe asthma.

 Figure 1. Trial Design, Randomization, and Follow-up
Panel A shows an overview of the trial design and procedures. Blue vertical lines denote 
study visits. The period between screening and initial bronchoscopy, urine testing, and blood 
testing was a minimum of 2 weeks in duration; during this period, other tests (computed 
tomography [CT], fraction of exhaled nitric oxide [FeNO], maximum bronchodilator 
response [Max BD], and methacholine challenge [Mch]) were performed at intervals that 
differed among the patients. Spirometry was performed at each study visit. Blood denotes 
blood testing (assessments of serum tryptase and peripheral-blood eosinophil counts),

 Bronch bronchoscopy, R randomization, and SPT skin-prick testing. Panel B summarizes the 
numbers of patients involved in screening, randomization, and trial completion. In the 
imatinib group, 24 patients completed the trial procedures through the second bronchoscopy 
and biopsy. In the placebo group, 26 patients completed the trial procedures through the 
second bronchoscopy and biopsy. Scores on the six-item Asthma Control Questionnaire 
(ACQ-6) range from 0 to 6, with lower values denoting better asthma control. The minimally 
important difference is 0.5. ECG denotes electrocardiographic, FEV1 forced expiratory 
volume in 1 second, and PC20 the concentration of methacholine required to decrease the 
FEV1 by 20%.

 Figure 2. Change in Airway Methacholine Reactivity
Shown is the mean change (±SE) in the concentration of methacholine required to cause a 
20% decrease in FEV1 from baseline (PC20) at month 3 and month 6 relative to the baseline 
methacholine PC20 obtained before the administration of imatinib or placebo. The P values 
shown are for the paired t-test evaluating the difference between the indicated time point and 
baseline. The P value for the between-group difference in the change in values, determined 
by a mixed-model analysis, is 0.048.

 Figure 3. Total Tryptase Levels in Serum
Shown are the mean total tryptase levels (±SE) in serum, as measured by immunoassay 
(UniCAP, Pharmacia). The P value is for the between-group difference in the change in 
values from baseline. A 42.7±31.6% decrease in the serum tryptase level was observed in 
the imatinib group, as compared with an 11.5±31.0% decrease in the placebo group.
