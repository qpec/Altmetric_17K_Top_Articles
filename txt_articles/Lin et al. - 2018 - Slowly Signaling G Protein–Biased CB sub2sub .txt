ABSTRACT
The CB2 cannabinoid agonist LY2828360 lacked both toxicity and
efficacy in a clinical trial for osteoarthritis. Whether LY2828360
suppresses neuropathic pain has not been reported, and its
signaling profile is unknown. In vitro, LY2828360 was a slowly
acting but efficacious G protein–biased CB2 agonist, inhibiting
cAMP accumulation and activating extracellular signal-regulated
kinase 1/2 signaling while failing to recruit arrestin, activate inositol
phosphate signaling, or internalize CB2 receptors. In wild-type
(WT) mice, LY2828360 (3 mg/kg per day i.p. � 12 days) sup-
pressed chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain produced by
paclitaxel without producing tolerance. Antiallodynic efficacy of
LY2828360 was absent in CB2 knockout (KO) mice. Morphine
(10 mg/kg per day i.p. � 12 days) tolerance developed in CB2KO
mice but not in WT mice with a history of LY2828360 treatment
(3 mg/kg per day i.p. � 12 days). LY2828360-induced antiallodynic
efficacy was preserved in WT mice previously rendered tolerant to
morphine (10 mg/kg per day i.p. � 12 days), but it was absent in
morphine-tolerant CB2KO mice. Coadministration of LY2828360
(0.1 mg/kg per day i.p. � 12 days) with morphine (10 mg/kg per
day � 12 days) blocked morphine tolerance in WT but not in
CB2KO mice. WT mice that received LY2828360 coadministered
with morphine exhibited a trend (P 5 0.055) toward fewer naloxone-
precipitated jumps compared with CB2KO mice. In conclusion,
LY2828360 is a slowly signaling, G protein–biased CB2 agonist that
attenuates chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain without pro-
ducing tolerance and may prolong effective opioid analgesia while
reducing opioid dependence. LY2828360 may be useful as a first-
line treatment in chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain and may
be highly efficacious in neuropathic pain states that are refractive to
opioid analgesics.
Introduction
Morphine suppresses many types of pain, but tolerance,
physical dependence, and unwanted side effects limit its
clinical use (Trang et al., 2007). Identification of therapeutic
strategies for blocking opioid tolerance and dependence has
therefore evolved as an area of intense research interest
(Habibi-Asl et al., 2014; Mansouri, et al., 2015; Hassanipour
et al., 2016; Hosseinzadeh et al., 2016). Adjunctive pharma-
cotherapies that combine mechanistically distinct analgesics
represent one such approach. Opioid and cannabinoid CB1 G
protein–coupled receptors are often coexpressed in the cen-
tral nervous system (CNS) (Pickel et al., 2004) and can
functionally interact by receptor heterodimerization or sig-
naling cross-talk (Bushlin et al., 2010). Although activation of
both receptors produces analgesia, undesirable pharmaco-
logic effects limit their use (Manzanares et al., 1999; Massi
et al., 2001). An alternative approach aims at harnessing the
therapeutic potential of cannabinoid CB2 receptors to sup-
press pathologic pain without producing CB1-mediated can-
nabimimetic effects (for review, see Guindon and Hohmann,
2008; Dhopeshwarkar and Mackie, 2014). CB2 receptors are
primarily expressed on immune cells but may be induced in
the CNS in response to injury (for review, see Mechoulam and
Parker, 2013). Activation of cannabinoid CB2 receptors pro-
duces antinociceptive efficacy in many preclinical pain models
without the unwanted side effects associated with CNS CB1
receptor activation. CB2 receptors have also been implicated
in facilitating morphine antinociception in normal and in-
flammatory conditions (Lim et al., 2005; Merighi et al., 2012;
Desroches et al., 2014); however, whether CB2 agonists

pain models is unknown.
LY2828360 (Fig. 1) is a potent CB2 receptor agonist with
similar affinity for human and rat CB2 receptors (Hollinshead
et al., 2013). In a human CB2 functional assay, approximately
87% maximal stimulation of CB2 was observed at 20 nM
concentrations, whereas only 15% maximal stimulation of CB1
was observed at 100 mM concentrations (Hollinshead et al.,
2013). LY2828360 showed good CNS penetration and potent
oral activity in a preclinical model of joint pain induced by
intra-articular monoiodoacetic acid (Hollinshead et al., 2013).
In the monoiodoacetic acid model, LY2828360 (0.3 mg/kg p.o.)
produced a dose-related reversal of pain using incapacitance
testing, demonstrating equivalent efficacy to the nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (Hollinshead et al., 2013).
No specific risks or discomforts associated with LY2828360
were observed in patients with osteoarthritic pain who have
taken LY2828360 up to a dose of 80 mg for 4 weeks (Pereira
et al., 2013) (www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01319929).
Unfortunately, LY2828360 and placebo treatments did not differ
in achieving the primary endpoint in patients with osteoarthritic
knee pain in this phase 2 clinical trial. Evaluations of LY2828360
antinociceptive efficacy have not appeared in the published
literature despite that LY2828360-associated improvements
were noted in exploratory pain models (clinicaltrials.gov
identifier: NCT01319929) (Pereira et al., 2013).
The signaling profile of LY2828360 is unknown. We there-
fore performed a thorough characterization of the signaling of
LY2828360 with stably expressed mouse and human CB2
receptors by using a range of cell-based in vitro signaling
assays: arrestin recruitment, CB2 receptor internalization,
inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP (cyclase) accumula-
tion, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) phos-
phorylation, and myo-inositol phosphate 1 (IP1) accumulation.
Moreover, to our knowledge, LY2828360 has never been evalu-
ated in an animal model of neuropathic pain. Our previous
studies showed that the CB2 agonist AM1710 suppressed
neuropathic pain induced by the chemotherapeutic agent pacli-
taxel through a CB2-specific mechanism without producing
tolerance or physical dependence (Deng et al., 2015). We
therefore used the same paclitaxel model of peripheral
neuropathy to evaluate whether LY2828360 would suppress
chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain in a CB2-dependent
manner using both CB2KO and WT mice. We investigated
whether repeated administration of LY2828360 would pro-
duce tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of the CB2 agonist
in paclitaxel-treated mice. Comparisons were made with the
opioid analgesic morphine administered under identical con-
ditions. In addition, we evaluated whether LY2828360 would
produce antiallodynic efficacy in mice that were rendered
tolerant to morphine and, conversely, whether development of
morphine tolerance would be attenuated in mice with a
history of chronic LY2828360 treatment. We also evaluated
whether coadministration of a low dose of LY2828360 with a
maximally efficacious dose of morphine would attenuate
morphine tolerance. In all studies, pharmacologic specificity
was established using WT and CB2KO mice. Finally, to assess
physical dependence, we challenged mice with either vehicle
or the opioid antagonist naloxone to evaluate whether
LY2828360 would impact naloxone-precipitated opioid with-
drawal in mice previously rendered tolerant to morphine.
Materials and Methods
Subjects. Adult male CB2KO mice [B6.129P2-CNR2 (tm1Dgen/J),
bred at Indiana University] and WT mice (bred at Indiana University
or purchased from Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) on a C57BL/
6J background, weighing 25–33 g, were used in this study. Animals
were single-housed several days before initiating pharmacologic
manipulations. All mice were maintained in a temperature-controlled
facility (73 6 2°F, 45% humidity, 12-hour light/dark cycle, lights on at
7 AM); food and water were provided ad libitum. All experimental
procedures were approved by the Bloomington Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of Indiana University and followed the
guidelines of the International Association for the Study of Pain
(Zimmermann, 1983).
Drugs and Chemicals. Paclitaxel (Tecoland Corporation, Irvine,
CA) was dissolved in a cremophor-based vehicle made of Cremophor EL
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.9% saline
(Aqualite System; Hospira, Inc., Lake Forest, IL) at a ratio of 1:1:18 as
previously published (Deng et al., 2015). LY2828360 (8-(2-chlorophenyl)-
2-methyl-6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-9-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)-9H-
purine) was obtained from Eli Lilly and company (Indianapolis, IN)
and synthesized by Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN) as previously described
(Hollinshead et al., 2013). Morphine (Sigma-Aldrich), or LY2828360,
was dissolved in a vehicle containing a 2:1:1:18 ratio of dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich), ALKAMULS EL-620 (Rhodia, Cranbury, NJ),
ethanol, and saline. Naloxone (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in
saline as indicated. Drugs were administered via intraperitoneal
injection to mice in a volume of 10 ml/kg. CP55940 [(2)-cis-3-[2-
hydroxy-4-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)phenyl]-trans-4-(3-hydroxypropylcy-
clohexanol] was obtained from the National Institute of Drug Abuse
Drug Supply Service (Bethesda, MD). Pertussis toxin (PTX; cat. no.
BML-G100-0050) was purchased from Enzo Lifesciences (Farm-
ingdale, NY).

 Cell Culture. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably
expressing mouse CB2 receptors (HEK mCB2) or human CB2
receptors (HEK hCB2) were generated, expanded, and maintained
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum
and penicillin/streptomycin (GIBCO, Carlsbad, CA) at 37°C in 5%
CO2. For ease of immunodetection, an amino-terminal hemagglutinin
epitope tag was introduced into the CB1 and CB2 receptors.
Arrestin Recruitment. To determine arrestin recruitment, as-
says were performed using an enzyme complementation approach
(Dhopeshwarkar and Mackie, 2016). PathHunter Chinese hamster
ovary (CHO) K1 CNR2 (cat. no. 93-0472C2) cells were purchased from
DiscoveRx (Fremont, CA). This cell line is engineered wherein an
N-terminal deletion mutant of b-galactosidase (b gal) enzyme acceptor
is fused with arrestin while a complementary smaller fragment
(C-terminal) is fused with C-terminal domain of the mouse CB2
cannabinoid receptor. Upon receptor activation, recruitment of
arrestin leads to the formation of an active b galactosidase enzyme,
which then acts on substrate to emit light that can be detected as
luminescence. These cell lines were thawed, grown, and maintained in
Pathunter AssayComplete media (cat. no. 92-0018GF2).
Quantification of cAMP Levels. cAMP assays were optimized
using PerkinElmer’s LANCE ultra-cAMP kit (cat. no. TRF0262;
PerkinElmer, Boston, MA) per the manufacturer’s instructions. All
assays were performed at room temperature using 384-optiplates
(cat. no. 6007299; PerkinElmer). Briefly, cells were resuspended in
1� stimulation buffer (1� Hanks’ balanced salt solution, 5 mM
HEPES, 0.5 mM IBMX, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), pH 7.4,
made fresh on the day of experiment). Cells (HEK CB2) were
incubated for 1 hour at 37°C, 5% CO2 and humidified air and then
transferred to a 384-optiplate (500 cells/ml, 10 ml), followed by
stimulation with drugs/compounds and forskolin (2 mM final con-
centration) made in 1� stimulation buffer, as appropriate, for
5 minutes. For time-course experiments, cells were treated with
CP55940 or LY282360 (in the presence of 2 mM forskolin final
concentration) for defined times. For experiments with PTX, cells
were treated overnight with 300 ng/ml PTX at 37°C in 5% CO2. Cells
were then lysed by addition of 10 ml Eu-cAMP tracer working
solution (4�, made fresh in 1� lysis buffer supplied with the kit,
under subdued light conditions) and 10 ml Ulight anti-cAMP working
solution (4�, made fresh in 1� lysis buffer) and further incubated for
1 hour at room temperature. Plates were then read with the TR
FRET mode on an Enspire plate reader (PerkinElmer).
Detection of Phosphorylated ERK1/2. HEK-mCB2 or hCB2
were seeded on poly-D-lysine coated 96-well plates (75,000 cells/well)
and grown overnight at 37°C, in 5% CO2 humidified air. The following
day, media was replaced by serum free DMEM, and plates were
further incubated for 5 hours at 37°C in 5% CO2 humidified air. For
experiments involving PTX, cells were treated overnight with PTX
(300 ng/ml) and the next day serum-starved for 5 hours. After serum
starvation, the cells were challenged with drugs/compounds for the
indicated time. After drug incubation, plates were emptied and
quickly fixed with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes,
followed by ice-cold methanol with the plate maintained at 220°C for
15 minutes. Plates were then washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS)/
0.1% Triton X-100 for 25 minutes (5 � 5-minute washes). The wash
solution was then replaced by Odyssey blocking buffer and incubated
further for 90 minutes with gentle shaking at room temperature.
Blocking solution was then removed and replaced with blocking
solution containing anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody (1:150; Cell Sig-
naling Technology, Danvers, MA) and was shaken overnight at 4°C.
The next day, plates were washed with TBS containing 0.05% Tween-
20 for 25 minutes (5 � 5-minute washes). Secondary antibody, donkey
anti-rabbit conjugated with IR800 dye (Rockland, Limerick, PA),
prepared in blocking solution, was added, and plates were gently
shaken for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were then again
washed five times with TBS/0.05% Tween-20 solution. The plates were
patted dry and scanned using LI-COR Odyssey scanner (LI-COR, Inc.,
Lincoln, NE) phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) activation (expressed
in percentages) was calculated by dividing the average integrated
intensities of the drug-treated wells by the average integrated
intensities of vehicle-treated wells. All assays were performed in
triplicate unless otherwise noted.
On-Cell Western for Receptor Internalization. HEK CB2
cells were grown to 95% confluence in DMEM 1 10% fetal bovine
serum 1 0.5% Pen/Strep. Cells were washed once with HEPES-
buffered saline/BSA (BSA @ 0.08 mg/ml) with 200 ml/well. Drugs were
applied at the indicated concentrations to cells, after which they were
incubated for 90 minutes at 37°C. Cells were then fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes and washed four times (300 ml per
well) with TBS. Blocking buffer (Odyssey blocking buffer; LI-COR,
Inc., Lincoln, NE) was applied at 100 ml per well for 1 hour at room
temperature. Anti- hemagglutinin antibody (mouse monoclonal, 1:
200; Covance, Princeton, NJ) diluted in Odyssey blocking buffer was
then applied for 1 hour at room temperature. After this, the plate was
washed five times (300 ml/well) with TBS. Secondary antibody diluted
(anti-mouse 680 antibody 1:800, LI-COR, Inc.,) in blocking buffer was
then applied for 1 hour at room temperature, after which the plate was
washed five times (300 ml/well) with TBS. The plate was imaged using
an Odyssey scanner (700 channel, 5.5 intensity, LI-COR, Inc.,).
IP1 Accumulation Assay. Accumulation of IP1, a downstream
metabolite of IP3, was measured by using IP-One HTRFkit (cat. no.
62, IPAPEB; Cisbio, Bedford, MA). Functional coupling of CB2
receptor to Gq G protein leads to phospholipase Cb (PLC) activation
and initiation of the IP hydrolysis cascade. Accumulated IP3 is quickly
dephosphorylated to IP2 and then to IP1. This assay takes advantage
of the fact that accumulated IP1 is protected from further dephos-
phorylation by the addition of lithium chloride, and IP1 levels can be
easily quantified using an homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence
(HTRF) assay. HEK mCB2 cells were detached from ∼50% confluent
plates using versene. Cells (10 ml, 5000 cells) were resuspended in
1� stimulation buffer (containing lithium chloride, supplied with the
kit) and were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C, 5% CO2, and humidified air
and then transferred to a 384-optiplate, followed by stimulation with
drugs/compounds made in DMSO/ethanol as appropriate, for defined
time points. Cells were then lysed with 5 ml of IP1-d2 dye (made fresh
in lysis buffer, supplied with the kit), followed by the addition of 5 ml
Ab-Cryptate dye (made fresh in lysis buffer). Plates were incubated
further for 60 minutes at room temperature and then read in HTRF
mode on an Enspire plate reader. All cell-based assay experiments
were performed in triplicate unless otherwise stated.
General In Vivo Experimental Protocol. In all studies, the
experimenter was blinded to the treatment condition, and mice were
randomly assigned to experimental conditions. Paclitaxel (4 mg/kg
i.p.) was administered four times on alternate days (cumulative dose,
16 mg/kg i.p.) to induce neuropathic pain as described previously by
our group (Deng et al., 2015). Control mice received an equal volume of
cremophor-vehicle. Development of paclitaxel-induced allodynia was
assessed on day 0, 4, 7, 11, and 14.
Effects of pharmacologic manipulations were assessed at 30 min-
utes after drug administration during the maintenance phase of
paclitaxel-induced neuropathy (i.e., beginning day 18–20 after initial
paclitaxel injection).
In experiment 1, we assessed the dose response and time course of
acute administration of LY2828360 on mechanical and cold allodynia
in WT (C57BL/6J) mice treated with paclitaxel or its cremophor-based
vehicle.
In experiments 2 and 3, pharmacologic manipulations were per-
formed once daily for 12 consecutive days in each of the two phases of
chronic treatment. Four days separated phase 1 and phase 2 chronic
dosing in all studies comprising two phases of chronic dosing.
Experiments 2 and 3 were performed concurrently using overlapping
cohorts that were tested with a single vehicle (phase 1), vehicle
(phase 2) group.
In experiment 2, we examined the antiallodynic efficacy of chronic
systemic administration of LY2828360 (3 mg/kg per day i.p. � 12 days)
or vehicle administered during phase 1 using paclitaxel-treated WT

 and CB2KO mice. We then assessed the antiallodynic efficacy of
chronic systemic administration of vehicle or morphine (10 mg/kg per
day i.p. � 12 days) administered during phase 2 in the same animals.
Responsiveness to mechanical and cold stimulation was evaluated on
treatment days 1, 4, 8, and 12 during phase 1 and on treatment days
16, 19, 23, and 27 during phase 2 (i.e., phase 2 started on day 16).
In experiment 3, we assessed the antiallodynic efficacy of chronic
administration of LY2828360 (3 mg/kg per day i.p. � 12 days in
phase 2) or vehicle in paclitaxel-treated WT and CB2KO mice that
previously developed tolerance to morphine. To induce morphine
tolerance, mice received repeated once daily injections of morphine
(10 mg/kg per day i.p. � 12 days) in phase 1 treatment; vehicle or
LY2828360 (3 mg/kg per day i.p. � 12 days) was administered
chronically in phase 2.
In experiment 4, we evaluated the impact of coadministration of
morphine (10 mg/kg i.p. � 12 days) with a submaximal dose of LY
2828360 (0.1 mg/kg per day i.p. � 12 days) in WT and CB2 KO mice.
In experiment 5, we evaluated whether chronic administration of
LY2828360 would attenuate morphine-dependent withdrawal symp-
toms that were precipitated using the opioid receptor antagonist
naloxone. After the last injection of morphine (on day 28 for two-phase
treatments, on day 13 for coadministration treatment), we challenged
WT or CB2KO mice from experiments 2, 3, and 4 with vehicle, followed
30 minutes later by naloxone (5 mg/kg i.p.) to precipitate opioid
receptor-mediated withdrawal. Mice were video-recorded for sub-
sequent scoring of withdrawal-like behaviors for a 30-minute interval
after challenge with vehicle or naloxone.
Assessment of Mechanical Allodynia. Paw withdrawal thresh-
olds (grams) to mechanical stimulation were measured in duplicate for
each paw using an electronic von Frey anesthesiometer supplied with
a 90-g probe (model Alemo 2390–5; IITC, Woodland Hills, CA) as
described previously (Deng et al., 2012). Mice were placed on an
elevated metal mesh table and allowed to habituate under individual,
inverted plastic cages to the testing platform for at least 20 minutes
until exploratory behavior had ceased. After the habituation period, a
force was applied to the midplantar region of the hind paw with a
semiflexible tip connected to the anesthesiometer. Mechanical stim-
ulation was terminated when the animal withdrew its paw, and the
value of the applied force was recorded in grams. Mechanical paw
withdrawal thresholds were obtained in duplicate for each paw and
are reported as the mean of duplicate determinations from each
animal, averaged across animals, for each group.
Assessment of Cold Allodynia. Response time (seconds) spent
attending to (i.e., elevating, licking, biting, or shaking) the paw
stimulated with acetone (Sigma-Aldrich) was measured in triplicate
for each paw to assess cold allodynia as previously published (Deng
et al., 2012, 2015). An acetone bubble (approximately 5 to 6 ml) formed
at the end of a blunt 1-ml syringe hub was gently applied to the plantar
surface of the hind paw. Care was taken not to apply mechanical
stimulation to the hind paw with the syringe itself. The total time the
animal spent attending to the acetone-stimulated paw (i.e., elevation,
shaking, or licking) was recorded over 1 minute after acetone
application. Acetone was applied three times to each paw with a
3-minute interval between applications. Values for each animal were
calculated as the mean of six determinations of acetone responsive-
ness derived from each mouse.
Evaluation of Opioid Receptor-Mediated Withdrawal Symp-
toms. WT (C57BL/6J) mice and CB2KO mice that received either
vehicle or morphine (10 mg/kg per day, i.p.) or a combination of
morphine with LY2828360 (10 mg/kg per day i.p. morphine coadmi-
nistered with 0.1 mg/kg per day i.p. LY2828360) for 12 days were
challenged with vehicle followed by naloxone (5 mg/kg i.p.) to induce
opioid withdrawal beginning 30 minutes after the last injection of the
test drugs. Mice were video-taped, and the number of jumps was
scored in 5-minute intervals for a total observation period of 30 min-
utes after challenge with either saline or naloxone (5 mg/kg i.p.).
Statistical Analyses. Paw withdrawal thresholds (mechanical)
and duration of acetone-evoked behavior (cold) were calculated for
each paw and averaged. Analysis of variance for repeated measures
was used to determine the time course of paclitaxel-induced mechan-
ical and cold allodynia. One-way analysis of variance was used to
identify the source of significant interactions at each time point and
compare postinjection responses with baseline levels, followed by
Bonferroni’s post hoc tests (for comparisons between groups). Appro-
priate comparisons were also made using Bonferroni’s post hoc tests or
planned comparison t tests (unpaired or paired, as appropriate). All
statistical analyses were performed using IBM-SPSS Statistics
version 24.0 (SPSS Inc., an IBM company, Chicago, IL). P , 0.05
was considered statistically significant. Sample size calculations and
power analyses were performed using Statmate 2.0 for windows
(Graphpad Prism Software, San Diego CA, www.graphpad.com).
Results
LY2828360 Displays a Delayed, G Protein–Biased
Signaling Profile at CB2 Receptors. A range of cell-based
in vitro signaling assays were used to dissect the signaling of
LY2828360 at CB2 receptors.
In an arrestin recruitment assay evaluating mouse CB2
receptors, CP55940 recruited arrestin in a concentration-
dependent manner, whereas LY2828360 failed to do so after
a 90-minute drug incubation (Fig. 2A). Recruitment of arrestin
is necessary for many forms of receptor sequestration and
internalization (Luttrell and Lefkowitz, 2002). In congruency,
LY2828360 failed to internalize the receptor (Fig. 2B). Strik-
ingly, CP55940 (1 mM) induced a rapid (∼5 minutes) and
efficacious inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase,
and LY2828360 (1 mM) induced an efficacious inhibition only
after 30 minutes (Fig. 2C). CB2 receptor inhibition of adenylyl
cyclase is mediated by inhibitory Gi/o G proteins (Dhopeshwarkar
and Mackie, 2014). Thus, to confirm whether delayed inhibition
by LY2828360 was mediated by Gi/o proteins, cells were pre-
treated with PTX, 300 ng/ml, overnight). After PTX treatment,
LY2828360nolongerinhibitedcAMPaccumulationat30minutes
(Fig. 2D), confirming involvement of inhibitory G proteins. Next,
full-concentration response experiments were performed two
times when maximal inhibition of forksolin-stimulated cAMP
accumulation was observed. At 5 minutes, CP55940 potently and
efficaciously inhibited cAMP accumulation, whereas LY2828360
had no effect (Fig. 2E; Table 1). Conversely, at 30 minutes,
LY2828360 was potent, efficacious, and CB2 receptor mediated
(Fig. 2F). CP55940 (1 mM) was efficacious in stimulating ERK1/2
phosphorylation (pERK1/2) at 5, 10, 30, and 40 minutes, whereas
LY2828360 (1 mM) increased pERK1/2 only at later times (20, 30,
and 40 minutes). ERK1/2 activation by LY2828360 was com-
pletely abolished by pretreatment of cells with PTX (300 ng/ml;
overnight) (Fig. 3, A and B), demonstrating G protein dependence.
In contrast, only the early phase of CP55940 stimulation of
pERK1/2 was PTX sensitive, consistent with the delayed phase of
pERK1/2 activation by CP55940 being arrestin-mediated. A full
concentration response experiment revealed that LY2828360
failed to increase pERK1/2 at 5 minutes but was potent and
efficacious at 20 minutes and required CB2 receptors as it was
blocked by SR144528 (Fig. 3, C and D; Table 1). To determine
whether the slow, biased signaling of LY2828360 was specific for
mouse CB2 receptors, we next evaluated LY2828360 signaling
via hCB2 receptors. As with mCB2, LY2828360 failed to in-
ternalize hCB2 receptors (Supplemental Fig. S1A) and exhibited
time- dependent delayed inhibition of cAMP accumulation
(Supplemental Fig. S1, B, D, and E) and ERK1/2 phosphorylation
(Supplemental Fig. S1, F, G, and I). As with mouse CB2, these

 effects were abolished by PTX (Supplemental Fig. S1, C and H)
and blocked by SR144528 (Supplemental Fig. S1I), confirming
the involvement of Gi/o proteins and CB2 receptors respectively.
Finally, LY2828360 did not affect IP1 accumulation via mouse or
human CB2 receptors (Supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). Potencies
and efficacies of CP55940 and LY2828360 in the signaling assays
described at mouse and human CB2 receptors are summarized in
Tables 1 and 2, respectively (Tables 1 and 2).
Effects of Acute Administration of LY2828360 in
Paclitaxel-Treated WT Mice. Paclitaxel decreased paw-
withdrawalthresholds (F1, 10 5 249.98, P 5 0.0001) and increased
acetone-evoked behaviors (F1, 10 5 342.95, P 5 0.0001), consistent
with our previous studies showing development of mechanical
and cold allodynia after paclitaxel treatment in mice (Deng et al.,
2015). Thus, mechanical (Fig. 4A) and cold (Fig. 4B) allodynia
developed by day 4 (P 5 0.0001) after initial paclitaxel dosing and
was maintained with high stability in paclitaxel-treated WT
mice relative to cremophor-vehicle treatment from day 7 onward
(P 5 0.0001).
In WT mice, acute systemic administration of LY2828360
suppressed paclitaxel-induced mechanical (F1, 10 5 125.902,
P 5 0.0001; Fig. 4C) and cold (F1, 10 5 29.167, P 5 0.0001;
Fig. 4D) allodynia in a dose-dependent manner. The high dose
of LY2828360 (3 mg/kg i.p.) fully reversed paclitaxel-induced
allodynia and normalized responses to pre-paclitaxel baseline
levels (P 5 0.167 mechanical; P 5 0.53 cold) (Fig. 4, C and D);
Fig. 2. LY2828360 displays a delayed
signaling profile at mouse CB2 receptors.
(A) In CHO cells stably expressing mCB2
receptors, CP55940 recruited arrestin in a
concentration-dependent manner, whereas
LY2828360 failed to do so after 90-minute
drug incubation. (B) In HEK cells stably
transfected with mCB2, CP55940 concen-
tration
dependently
internalized
the
mCB2; LY2828360 was less potent and
efficacious. (C) In a forskolin-stimulated
cAMP time course assay, CP55940 (1 mM)
was efficacious and rapid in inhibiting
forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation
at 5 minutes, whereas LY2828360 (1 mM)
was efficacious only after 30 minutes. (D)
After PTX treatment, CP55940 (1 mM)
modestly increased cAMP accumulation at
5 minutes, whereas LY2828360 (1 mM)
failed to affect cyclase levels at all time
points examined/tested. (E) CP55940 was
potent and efficacious in inhibiting forsko-
lin-stimulated
cAMP
accumulation
at
5 minutes, whereas LY2828360 failed to
affect cAMP levels at this time point. (F)
After
30-minute
incubation,
however,
LY2828360
concentration
dependently
inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accu-
mulation, and this inhibition was com-
pletely blocked by 1 mM SR144528(SR2).
Forskolin-stimulated cAMP assays were
performed in duplicate. All other assays
were performed in triplicate. All data were
plotted and analyzed using GraphPad
Prism 4.

 however, neuropathic pain was prominent in paclitaxel-
treated mice receiving doses of LY2828360 lower than
0.3 mg/kg i.p. compared with control mice that received the
cremophor-vehicle in lieu of paclitaxel (P 5 0.001 mechanical;
P 5 0.044 cold).
To

the

of
antinociceptive
action
of
LY2828360, the maximally efficacious dose (3 mg/kg i.p.)
was administered to paclitaxel-treated mice and responsive-
ness to mechanical and cold stimulation was evaluated at 0.5,
2.5, 4.5, and 24 hours postinjection. LY2828360 produced
time-dependent suppressions of paclitaxel-evoked mechanical
(F1, 10 5 38.604 P 5 0.0001; Fig. 4E) and cold (F1, 10 5 4.993,
P , 0.05 cold; Fig. 4F) hypersensitivities and suppression of
allodynia was maintained for at least 4.5 hours postinjection
(P 5 0.001 mechanical, P 5 0.022 cold) relative to drug
preinjection levels (i.e., Pac). At 24 hours postinjection,
paclitaxel-induced
mechanical
allodynia
had
returned
(P 5 1 mechanical; P 5 0.125 cold) to drug preinjection levels
of hypersensitivity (Fig. 4, E and F). Residual suppression of
cold allodynia was absent by 72 hours after LY2828360
treatment (data not shown).
Previously Chronic Administration of LY2828360
Blocked the Development of Tolerance to the Anti-
allodynic Effects of Morphine in WT but Not in CB2KO
Mice. To study the effects of LY2828360 treatment on the
development of tolerance to morphine, pharmacologic manip-
ulations were used in two phases of treatment during the
maintenance of neuropathic pain (Fig. 5A). In WT mice, phase
1 treatment with LY2828360 (3 mg/kg per day i.p. � 12 days)
suppressed paclitaxel-induced mechanical (F2, 15 5 183.929,
P 5 0.0001; Fig. 5B) and cold (F2, 15 5 64.218, P 5 0.0001; Fig.
5C) hypersensitivities relative to phase 1 vehicle treatments.

Fig. 3. LY282360 displays a delayed CB2 receptor– and G
protein–dependent signaling profile in activating pERK1/2.
(A) In HEK cells stably expressing mouse CB2 receptors,
CP55940 (1 mM) increased phosphorylated ERK1/2 at 5-,
10-, 30-, and 40-minute time points, whereas LY2828360
(1 mM) had no effect at 5- and 10-minute time points but
increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation at 20, 30, and 40 min-
utes. (B) PTX treatment abolished the 20-minute phosphor-
ylation of ERK1/2 by LY2828360 (1 mM) and abolished the
CP55940-mediated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 at the
5-minute time point, but it was retained at the 40-minute
time point after PTX treatment. (C) CP55940 concentration
dependently increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation at 5 min-
utes, whereas LY2828360 failed to affect pERK1/2 levels at
this time point. (D) Conversely, after 20 minutes of treat-
ment,
CP55940
decreased
ERK1/2
phosphorylation,
whereas LY2828360 increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation,
in a concentration- dependent manner. Both effects were
blocked by the CB2 receptor antagonist SR144528 (1 mM)
(SR2). All pERK1/2 assays were performed in triplicate. All
the experimental data were plotted and analyzed using

 (i.e., baseline; P , 0.005 mechanical, P , 0.006 cold). In
paclitaxel-treated WT mice, chronic morphine treatment dur-
ing phase 2 of mice previously receiving vehicle during phase
1 [WT/Pac: Veh (vehicle) (1)-Mor (morphine) (2)] only sup-
pressed paclitaxel-induced mechanical and cold allodynia on
day 16 (P 5 0.0001 mechanical, P 5 0.0001 cold) and then failed
to suppress paclitaxel-induced mechanical (P 5 1) and cold (P 5
1) allodynia on subsequent test days (i.e., days 19, 23, and 27)
relative to vehicle-treated mice [WT/Pac: Veh (1)-Veh (2); Fig. 5,
B and C]. Thus, morphine tolerance rapidly developed to the
antiallodynic effects of phase 2 morphine in paclitaxel-treated
mice receiving vehicle in phase 1.
By contrast, in WT mice receiving LY2828360 during phase 1,
phase2morphine[WT/Pac:LY(1)-Mor(2);10mg/kgi.p.� 12days]
sustainably suppressed paclitaxel-induced mechanical (F2, 15 5
91.428, P 5 0.0001) (Fig. 5B) and cold (F2, 15 5 40.979, P 5

with vehicle in phase 1 [WT/Pac: Veh (1)-Mor (2); P 5 0.0001]
(Fig. 5, B and C). This suppression was present and stable
throughout phase 2 for both mechanical (P , 0.05) and cold
(P , 0.009) modalities compared with drug preinjection levels
in phase 2 (i.e., day 15). Morphine-induced antiallodynic
efficacy was stably maintained throughout the observation
interval after LY2828360 pretreatment for each stimulus
modality (P 5 0.222 mechanical, P 5 0.535 cold). Thus, a
previous history of chronic treatment with LY2828360 pre-
vented the development of morphine tolerance in paclitaxel-
treated WT mice for both stimulus modalities.
In paclitaxel-treated CB2KO mice, phase 1 LY2828360
(3 mg/kg per day i.p. � 12 days) treatment failed to suppress
mechanical (P . 0.05) or cold (P . 0.05) allodynia relative to
vehicle treatment on any day (Fig. 5, D and E). In these same
CB2KO mice, subsequent phase 2 morphine treatment

 (P 5 0.0001) and cold (P 5 0.0001) allodynia on the initial day
of morphine dosing (i.e., day 16) relative to vehicle treatment
[CB2KO/Pac: Veh (1)-Veh (2)]. Paclitaxel-induced allodynia
was fully reinstated at subsequent time points (i.e., on days
19, 23, and 27; P 5 1 mechanical, P 5 0.269 cold). The
antiallodynic efficacy of initial morphine administration (i.e.,
on day 16) was similar in WT mice and CB2KO mice (P 5 0.203
mechanical; P 5 1 cold). Phase 2 morphine administration
continued to suppress paclitaxel-induced allodynia (P 5 0.0001
mechanical; P 5 0.0001 cold) in WT mice previously receiving
LY2828360 [WT/Pac: LY (1)-Mor (2)] but not in the CB2KO mice
at subsequent time points (i.e., days 19, 23, and 27), suggesting
that pretreatment with LY2828360 did not block the develop-
ment of morphine tolerance in CB2KO mice.
Chronic LY2828360 Treatment Suppresses Paclitaxel-
Induced Mechanical and Cold Allodynia in WT Mice but
Not in CB2KO Mice Previously Rendered Tolerant to
Morphine. To evaluate whether LY2828360 has antiallo-
dynic efficacy in morphine-tolerant mice, we first dosed
paclitaxel-treated WT and CB2KO mice chronically with
morphine during phase 1 (10 mg/kg per day i.p. � 12 days)
and continued with chronic LY2828360 administration (3 mg/
kg per day i.p. � 12 days) (Fig. 6A) in phase 2. In phase 1,
morphine administration suppressed paclitaxel-induced me-
chanical (F1, 10 5 83.817 P 5 0.0001) and cold (F1, 10 5
99.443, P 5 0.0001) allodynia relative to vehicle treatment.
On day 1, morphine fully reversed paclitaxel-induced allo-
dynia and normalized responses to pre-paclitaxel levels (i.e.,
baseline; P 5 0.062 mechanical; P 5 1.0 cold) but not on
subsequent test days (i.e., day 4, 8, 12; Fig. 6, B and C).
Antiallodynic
efficacy
of
morphine
was
decreased
on
subsequent test days relative to pre-paclitaxel levels of
responsiveness (P 5 0.005 mechanical; P 5 0.0001 cold).
Thus, tolerance developed to the antiallodynic effects of
morphine (i.e., on day 4, 8 and 12) (Fig. 6, B and C).
To evaluate whether LY2828360 produces antiallodynic
effects in mice previously rendered tolerant to morphine,
LY2828360 (3 mg/kg per day i.p. � 12 days) was administered
during phase 2 to paclitaxel-treated mice that previously
receiving morphine during phase 1. Phase 2 LY2828360
(3 mg/kg per day i.p. � 12 days) treatment fully reversed
paclitaxel-induced allodynia and normalized responsiveness
to pre-paclitaxel baseline levels in WT mice that previously
developed morphine tolerance in phase 1 (P 5 0.112 mechan-
ical; P 5 0.103 cold; Fig. 6, B and C). Thus, prior morphine
tolerance does not attenuate LY2828360-induced antiallo-
dynic efficacy in phase 2 in WT mice. Antiallodynic efficacy
of LY2828360 was also stable throughout the chronic dosing
period (P 5 1.0 mechanical; P 5 1.0 cold), suggesting that
tolerance did not develop to phase 2 LY2828360 treatment in
WT mice (Fig. 6, B and C).
To further evaluate the mechanism of action underlying the
antiallodynic efficacy of LY2828360, we compared the efficacy
of phase 2 LY2828360 treatment in CB2KO and WT mice that
were rendered tolerant to morphine during phase 1. Acute
morphine increased paw withdrawal thresholds and reduced
cold response times in paclitaxel-treated CB2KO mice relative
to the vehicle treatment on day 1 of phase 1 dosing (P 5 0.0001
mechanical; P 5 0.0001 cold) (Fig. 6, D and E). The anti-
allodynic effects of phase 1 morphine were attenuated on
day 4 (P 5 0.058 mechanical; P 5 0.992 cold) and morphine
antiallodynic efficacy was completely absent on day 8 and day
12 of chronic dosing (P 5 1.0 mechanical; P 5 1.0 cold; Fig. 6, D
and E). Chronic administration of LY2828360 in phase
2 (3 mg/kg per day, i.p. � 12 days) did not alter responsiveness
to mechanical or cold stimulation in paclitaxel-treated CB2KO
mice relative to the vehicle treatment at any time point (P 5
0.252 mechanical; P 5 0.299 cold) (Fig. 6, D and E). Thus,
chronic administration of LY2828360 produced antiallodynic
efficacy in paclitaxel-treated WT mice but not CB2KO with the
same histories of morphine treatment (P 5 0.0001 mechanical,
P 5 0.0001 cold).
Chronic Coadministration of Low-Dose LY2828360
with Morphine Blocked Morphine Tolerance in WT but
Not in CB2 KO Mice. In WT mice, coadministration of a
submaximal dose of LY2828360 (0.1 mg/kg per day i.p. �
12 days) with morphine (10 mg/kg per day � 12 days) sup-
pressed paclitaxel-induced mechanical (F3, 20 5 111.039 P 5
0.0001) (Fig. 7A) and cold (F3, 20 5 56.823 P 5 0.0001; Fig. 7B)
hypersensitivities relative to vehicle treatment (P 5 0.0001).
Coadministration of the CB2 agonist with morphine fully
reversed paclitaxel-induced mechanical allodynia and nor-
malized responses to pre-paclitaxel baseline levels through-
out the observation period (P 5 0.078). Coadministration of
the CB2 agonist with morphine also normalized cold respon-
siveness on days 1 and 4 (P 5 0.156) of chronic dosing to
pre-paclitaxel baseline levels. By contrast, in CB2KO mice,
sustained antiallodynic efficacy was absent in paclitaxel-treated
mice receiving LY2828360 coadministered with morphine; the
combination treatment reversed only paclitaxel-induced me-
chanical (P 5 0.0001) and cold (P 5 0.0001) allodynia relative to
vehicle on day 1 (Fig. 7, A and B). Antiallodynic efficacy of
morphine coadministered with LY2828360 was greater in WT
mice relative to CB2KO mice on subsequent days of chronic
dosing (i.e., days 4, 8, and 12; P 5 0.0001 mechanical; P 5 0.0001
cold) (Fig. 7, A and B). In paclitaxel-treated WT mice, the
combination of morphine with LY2828360 produced a stable,
sustained antiallodynic efficacy throughout the dosing period
(P 5 0.344 mechanical; P 5 0.995 cold), demonstrating that
morphine tolerance failed to develop in the coadministration
condition (Fig. 7, A and B).
Naloxone-Precipitated Withdrawal is Attenuated in
Morphine Tolerant WT but Not CB2KO Mice with a
History of LY2828360 Treatment. In paclitaxel-treated
WT mice, naloxone challenge produced characteristic jumping
behavior that differed between groups (F3, 22 5 5.657, P 5
0.005)
(Fig.
8A).
Post
hoc
comparisons
revealed
that
paclitaxel-treated WT mice that received morphine during
phase 2 but vehicle during phase 1 [i.e., WT/Pac: Veh (1)-Mor
(2) group] exhibited a greater number of jumps relative to
paclitaxel-treated WT mice that received vehicle during both
phases [WT/Pac: Veh (1)-Veh (2); P 5 0.007]. The number of
naloxone-precipitated jumps did not differ between groups
that received phase 1 LY2828360 followed by phase 2 mor-
phine treatment [WT/Pac: LY (1)-Mor (2)] and those that
received phase 1 vehicle followed by phase 2 vehicle treat-
ment [WT/Pac: Veh (1)-Veh (2); P 5 0.3]. Also, the number of
jumps did not differ between phase 2 morphine-treated
mice that received either LY2828360 or vehicle during
phase 1 [WT/Pac: Veh (1)-Mor (2) vs. WT/Pac: LY (1)-Mor (2),
P 5 0.831]. Naloxone challenge did not precipitate withdrawal
in paclitaxel-treated WT mice receiving morphine in phase
1 [WT/Pac: Mor (1)-LY (2) vs. WT/Pac: Veh (1)-Veh (2) P 5 1]

 Similarly, naloxone challenge altered the number of jumps
in paclitaxel-treated CB2KO mice (F3, 21 5 5.696 P 5 0.005;
Fig. 8B). In paclitaxel-treated CB2KO mice, naloxone injection
precipitated jumping in mice receiving phase 1 vehicle fol-
lowed by phase 2 morphine treatment versus mice receiving
vehicle during both phases of chronic dosing [CB2KO/Pac: Veh
(1)-Veh (2) vs. CB2KO/Pac: Veh (1)-Mor (2), P 5 0.044]. The
number of jumps trended higher in paclitaxel-treated CB2KO
mice receiving LY2828360 in phase 1 and morphine in phase
2 relative to CB2KO mice that received vehicle during both
phases [CB2KO/Pac: LY (1)-Mor (2) vs. CB2KO/Pac: veh
(1)-Veh (2) group; P 5 0.057]. In paclitaxel-treated CB2KO
mice, the number of jumps did not differ between phase
2 morphine-treated mice that received either LY2828360
or vehicle during phase 1 [CB2KO/Pac: LY (1)-Mor (2) vs.
CB2KO/Pac: Veh (1)-Mor (2), P 5 1]. A trend toward fewer
naloxone-precipitated jumps was observed in WT relative to
CB2KO mice (P 5 0.064; Fig. 8C) that received the same
histories of phase 1 LY2828360 followed by phase 2 morphine
treatment. Similarly, coadministration of LY2828360 with
morphine also trended to produce a lower number of naloxone-
precipitated jumps in WT compared with CB2KO mice (P 5
0.055; Fig. 8D). The observed power of the marginally significant
unpaired t test comparing impact of LY2828360 on morphine-
dependent WT and CB2KO mice was 40%. A sample size of
20/group would be required to detect a statistically signifi-
cant impact of LY2828360 on WT and CB2KO animals based
on the observed S.D., sample size and magnitude difference
observed between means.
Body weight change from baseline (i.e., postvehicle) differed
as a function of time after naloxone challenge (F1, 48 5 144.18,
P 5 0.0001) but did not differ between groups, and the
interaction between time and group was not significant. A
trend toward group differences in post-naloxone body weight
was observed at 2 hours (F8, 48 5 2.033, P 5 0.062) but not at
0.5 hour (F8, 48 5 1.460, P 5 0.197) postinjection (Fig. 8E).

 Discussion
Here we show that the CB2 agonist LY2828360 is a slowly
acting but efficacious G protein–biased CB2 agonist that
inhibits cAMP accumulation and activates ERK1/2 signaling
in vitro. In vivo, chronic systemic administration of the CB2
agonist LY2828360 suppressed chemotherapy-induced neuro-
pathic pain without producing tolerance. The observed anti-
allodynic efficacy was absent in CB2KO mice, demonstrating
mediation by CB2 receptors. Sustained efficacy of LY2828360
was observed in mice with a history of morphine tolerance.
Moreover, both chronic LY2828360 dosing completed before
morphine dosing and coadministration of LY2828360 with
morphine strongly attenuated development of tolerance of
morphine. LY2828360 also trended to decrease naloxone
precipitated withdrawal signs in WT but not in CB2KO mice.
LY2828360 also displays an intriguing, yet interesting,
signaling profile at mouse and human CB2 receptors. Our
results suggest that LY2828360 is a slowly acting CB2-
receptor agonist strongly biased toward Gi/oG protein signal-
ing with little effect on arrestin or Gq signaling, which
contrasts strongly with the balanced agonist CP55940, which
rapidly inhibited cAMP accumulation and increased pERK1/2.
This ability of a ligand to selectively activate a subset of
signaling pathways is termed biased agonism or functional
selectivity (Kenakin, 2011) and has emerged as an important
pharmacologic concept. For example, a “biased” agonist may
activate a pathway that is therapeutically more relevant and
shun pathways that lead to untoward effects. More recently,
“kinetic bias” has emerged as another important pharmacologic
concept that emphasizes the time scale of the activation of a
particular pathway (Klein Herenbrink et al., 2016). It remains
to be determined whether the marked kinetic and G-protein
bias of LY2828360 explains either its remarkable opioid
sparing property or its failure in clinical trials for osteoarthritis
pain (Pereira et al., 2013).
Tolerance limits therapeutic utility of an analgesic (Rosenblum
et al., 2008). In the present study, the antiallodynic efficacy of
LY2828360 was fully maintained in neuropathic mice that
received once daily administration of the maximally effec-
tive dose of LY2828360 over 12 consecutive days. Antiallo-
dynic efficacy of LY2828360 (3 mg/kg i.p.) lasted more than
4.5 hours after acute administration. Responsiveness to
mechanical and cold stimulation returned to baseline after
1 and 3 days, respectively. Our data are consistent with our
previous studies showing that CB2 agonist AM1710 sup-
presses paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain without pro-
ducing tolerance or physical dependence after either 8 days
of once daily (i.p.) dosing (Deng et al., 2015) or chronic
infusion over 4 weeks (Rahn et al., 2014).
A striking novel observation of our study was that prior
chronic treatment with LY2828360 for 12 days prevented
subsequent development of tolerance to the antiallodynic
effect of morphine. By contrast, tolerance to morphine de-
veloped in CB2KO mice identically treated with chronic
LY2828360 in phase 1 followed by chronic morphine treat-
ment in phase 2. Moreover, in paclitaxel-treated WT mice,
coadministration of morphine with a low dose of LY2828360
was fully efficacious in alleviating neuropathic pain and
blocking the development of morphine tolerance. These
observations suggest that analgesic efficacy and, potentially,
the therapeutic ratio of morphine could be improved by
adjunctive treatment that combines an opioid with a CB2
agonist to treat neuropathic pain while simultaneously limit-
ing the development of tolerance, dependence, and potentially
other adverse side effects of the opioid analgesic. Our results
are in line with a recent study suggesting that coadministra-
tion of a low dose of the CB2 receptor agonist AM1241
combined with morphine reduced the morphine tolerance in
Walker 256 tumor-bearing rats (Zhang et al., 2016), although
mediation by CB2 receptors was not assessed. AM1241 pro-
duced a modest enhancement of opioid-mediated antinocicep-
tion in the hotplate test and in a test of mechanical sensitivity
in tumor-bearing rats (Zhang et al., 2016); however, tolerance
developed to the antiallodynic effects of the combination
treatment assessed with mechanical but not thermal (hot
plate) stimulation, suggesting that therapeutic benefit of
the adjunctive treatment may be ligand- and/or modality-
dependent. Coadministration of CB2 agonist JWH133 also
exhibited opioid-sparing effects in the formalin model of
inflammatory pain (Yuill et al., 2017). The mechanism un-
derlying these therapeutically advantageous properties re-
mains incompletely understood. In tumor-bearing mice,
AM1241 upregulated m-opioid receptor expression in the
spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) (Zhang et al.,
2016). Another study suggested CB2 agonist upregulated
m-opioid receptor expression levels, whereas the CB2 antago-
nist inhibited m-opioid receptor expression level in Jurkat
T cells (Börner et al., 2006) and in mouse brainstem (Páldy
et al., 2008). Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) acti-
vation and glial proinflammatory mediator release have also
been linked to morphine tolerance (Raghavendra et al., 2002;
Mika et al., 2007). CB2 agonists could alleviate morphine
tolerance by an interaction between microglial opioid and CB2
receptors and/or by reduction of glial and MAPK activation
(Badalà et al., 2008; Tumati et al., 2012). CB2 activation is

 correlated with increasing anti-inflammatory gene expression
in the dorsal horn and reductions in mechanical and thermal
hypersensitivities. Coadministration of morphine with the
CB2 agonist JWH015 synergistically inhibited preclinical
inflammatory, postoperative, and neuropathic pain in a dose-
and time-dependent manner (Grenald et al., 2017). The
observed synergism may involve activation of CB2 receptors on
immune cells and subsequent inhibition of the inflammatory
process coupled with morphine’s well characterized ability to
inhibit nociceptive signaling (Grenald et al., 2017). In kerati-
nocytes in peripheral paw tissue, AM1241 stimulated the
release of the endogenous opioid b-endorphin, which acted at
local neuronal MORs to inhibit nociception through a
naloxone-dependent mechanism (Ibrahim et al., 2005); how-
ever, naloxone sensitivity is not a class effect of CB2 agonists
and cannot account for AM1241 antinociception (Rahn et al.,

tone.
Some effects of cannabinoid receptor agonists and antago-
nists on morphine antinociceptive tolerance remain contro-
versial. Coadministration of the CB2 receptor agonist JWH-015
with morphine increased morphine analgesia and morphine
antinociceptive tolerance (Altun et al., 2015). By contrast, the
CB2 receptor antagonist JTE907 decreased morphine analgesia
and attenuated morphine antinociceptive tolerance in rats
using tail-flick and hot-plate tests of antinociception (Altun
et al., 2015). Differences in experimental paradigms, biased
signaling of the CB2 agonist used, or the presence or absence of
a pathologic pain state could account for these disparities.
An emerging challenge for pain management is how to treat
pain in the morphine-tolerant individual. Dose escalation is
typically used in early unimodal treatment (de Leon-Casasola
et al., 1993), which may enhance potential for abuse (Rosenblum
et al., 2008). The combination of two or more analgesic agents
with different mechanisms was proposed as an analgesic
strategy (Raffa et al., 2010). Our study has important implica-
tions for the clinical management of neuropathic pain because
chronic LY2828360 treatment showed sustained antiallodynic
efficacy in neuropathic mice previously rendered tolerant to
morphine. This observation is unlikely to be due to pharma-
cokinetic factors because morphine dosing ceased for 4 days
in our study before introduction of phase 2 LY2828360
chronic treatment.
Physical dependence is another major side effect of opioid
treatment, which can lead to a withdrawal syndrome when the
user stops taking the drug; however, most studies of opioid
dependence have used naïve animals rather than animals
subjected to a neuropathic pain state (Lynch et al., 2010). The
opioid receptor antagonist naloxone precipitates a spectrum of
autonomic and somatic withdrawal signs in morphine-
dependent animals (Morgan and Christie, 2011). In the pre-
sent study, in paclitaxel-treated WT mice, chronic phase
1 pretreatment with LY2828360 produced a trend toward
reducing naloxone-precipitated withdrawal jumps without
reducing pain relief in the same animals where LY2828360
blocked development of morphine tolerance. This trend was
absent in CB2KO mice receiving identical treatments. In fact,
our studies raise the possibility that CB2 receptor signaling
may attenuate opioid antagonist-precipitated withdrawal
because CB2KO mice trended to show higher levels of
naloxone-precipitated jumping compared with WT mice when
pretreated with CB2 agonist. Moreover, coadministration of
low-dose LY2828360 with morphine mimicked these effects
and trended to decrease naloxone-precipitated withdrawal
jumping in paclitaxel-treated WT mice compared with CB2KO
mice (P 5 0.055). Thus, LY2828360 may be efficacious in
decreasing morphine withdrawal symptoms. Variability in
withdrawal jumps and inadequate statistical power could
account for the failure to observe more robust statistical
differences in jumps between groups; the primary endpoints
evaluated here were mechanical and cold responsiveness, not
naloxone-induced jumping. Observations from both these
studies are, nonetheless, broadly consistent with the hypoth-
esis that CB2 receptor activation may attenuate signs of opioid
withdrawal. Stimulation of microglial CB2 receptors by the
CB2 agonist suppressed microglial activation (Ehrhart et al.,
2005), which has been linked to morphine withdrawal behav-
iors. Thus, depletion of spinal lumbar microglia decreased
withdrawal behaviors and attenuated the severity of with-
drawal without affecting morphine antinociception (Burma
NE, et al., 2017). The mechanism underlying these observa-
tions remains to be explored.
In summary, our observations suggest that CB2 agonists
may be useful as a first-line treatment of suppressing
chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. Our results suggest
that CB2 agonists may be useful for suppressing neuropathic
pain with sustained efficacy in opioid-recalcitrant pain states
without the development of tolerance or dependence.
