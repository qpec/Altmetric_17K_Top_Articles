Cutaneous melanomas arise through causal pathways involving interplay between exposure to UV radiation
and host factors, resulting in characteristic patterns of driver mutations in BRAF, NRAS, and other genes. To gain
clearer insights into the factors contributing to somatic mutation genotypes in melanoma, we collected clinical
and epidemiologic data, performed skin examinations, and collected saliva and tumor samples from a
community-based series of 414 patients aged 18 to 79, newly diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma. We
assessed constitutional DNA for nine common polymorphisms in melanocortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R). Tumor
DNA was assessed for somatic mutations in 25 different genes. We observed mutually exclusive mutations in
BRAFV600E (26%), BRAFV600K (8%), BRAFother (5%), and NRAS (9%). Compared to patients with BRAF wild-type
melanomas, those with BRAFV600E mutants were significantly younger, had more nevi but fewer actinic kera-
toses, were more likely to report a family history of melanoma, and had tumors that were more likely to harbor
neval remnants. BRAFV600K mutations were also associated with high nevus counts. Both BRAFV600K and NRAS
mutants were associated with older age but not with high sun exposure. We also found no association between
MC1R status and any somatic mutations in this community sample of cutaneous melanomas, contrary to earlier
reports.

INTRODUCTION
Melanoma is a potentially lethal cancer arising from the
pigment cells, melanocytes. Although UV radiation from
sunlight is the principal environmental cause for these
cancers, there is increasing evidence that the effect of UV
radiation on melanocytes is not the same for all people
(Whiteman et al., 2011). Epidemiologic observations origi-
nally led to the concept that melanomas may arise through
one of several pathways under a divergent pathway model for
melanoma (Whiteman et al., 2006). This model suggested at
least two different causal pathways to melanoma develop-
ment, one pertaining to host susceptibility and nevus preva-
lence and the other associated with chronic sun exposure.
Subsequent
investigations
strongly
suggested
that
the
molecular profile of tumors for several oncogenes, including
BRAF and NRAS, reflected these causal pathways (Curtin
et al., 2005; Landi et al., 2006; Thomas et al., 2007;
Whiteman et al., 2006). Several studies have now shown
that melanomas arising on the trunk tend to occur in younger
individuals and are associated with adjacent melanocytic
nevi and BRAF mutations, and these appear biologically
distinct from melanomas arising on chronically sun-exposed
sites, such as the head and neck, which tend to occur in older
individuals carrying other mutation profiles, including NRAS
mutations (Curtin et al., 2005; Hacker et al., 2010, 2013; Lee
et al., 2011; Maldonado et al., 2003; Thomas et al., 2007;
van Elsas et al., 1996; Whiteman et al., 2003, 2006). More
recent data have emerged suggesting that different genotypes
exist within BRAF mutant melanoma, and that melanomas
harboring BRAFV600K mutations are associated with older
age, male sex, higher levels of sun exposure, and poorer
prognosis than BRAF V600E melanomas (Jewell et al., 2012;
Mar et al., 2015; Menzies et al., 2012). Thus, there appear
to be marked differences in the associations between sun
exposure, melanocyte susceptibility, and host characteristics

 with a suite of melanoma mutations, strongly suggestive of
different causal pathways to melanoma development.
The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene is a key deter-
minant of human pigmentation with specific variants linked
to red hair and melanoma risk (Palmer et al., 2000; Sturm
et al., 2003). An interaction between germline MC1R vari-
ants and somatic BRAF mutations was reported in tumors
from US and Italian populations (Fargnoli et al., 2008; Landi
et al., 2006), suggesting that people carrying germline MC1R
variants had a greater risk of developing a melanoma
harboring a BRAF mutation in skin not damaged by sunlight.
Analyses of Spanish and Austrian samples found no associ-
ation between germline MC1R variants and somatic BRAF
mutations across all tumor samples, but they did observe a
modest trend between germline MC1R status and somatic
BRAF mutations in melanomas of the trunk (odds ratio [OR]
1.8 [0.8e4.1], P ¼ 0.1) but an inverse association between
MC1R and BRAF for melanomas of the head and neck (OR
0.3 [0.1e0.8], P ¼ 0.02) (Hacker et al., 2013). However, the
association between germline MC1R variants and somatic
BRAF mutations has not been replicated in other populations,
including studies from the United States (Thomas et al.,
2010b), Australia (Hacker et al., 2010), and Germany
(Scherer et al., 2010). Indeed, Scherer and colleagues (2010)
observed significantly lower frequencies of somatic BRAF
mutations in carriers of MC1R variants. These conflicting
findings
across
different
populations
underscore
the
complexity of gene-environment interactions for melanoma.
Given the emergence of novel therapies targeting somatic
mutations in melanoma, coupled with the desire to develop
evidence-based primary prevention programs, there is a need
to catalog the frequency of mutations in large samples of
melanoma patients and to understand the mechanisms
through which they arise. Here, we present the findings of an
investigation into the epidemiologic, histologic, and geno-
typic associations with melanoma mutations, comprising a
large, community-based sample of 414 primary cutaneous
invasive melanoma patients arising in a high-incidence
population exposed to very high levels of ambient UV
radiation.
RESULTS
Subject characteristics
A total of 766 patients with primary invasive melanoma (32%
female, mean age 58 years) were recruited for the parent
epidemiologic study (Kvaskoff et al., 2013). The majority of
melanomas
were
classified
histologically
as
superficial
spreading melanoma (72%), with the remainder classified as
lentigo maligna melanoma (13%), nodular (5%), or unclas-
sified (10%). Tumors were generally thin; 65% were Clark
level II, and 82% had Breslow thickness �1 mm. The ana-
lyses presented here were restricted to 414 patients for whom
sufficient material was remaining for somatic mutation
analysis (see Supplementary Figure S1 online). There were no
significant differences between those genotyped (n ¼ 414)
and those who were not (n ¼ 352) in terms of sex (71% vs.
65% males) or melanoma thickness distribution (84% vs.
81% �1 mm), but participants not genotyped were slightly
older (56.3 years vs. 59.8 years, P ¼ 0.04) and were more
likely to have melanomas of the head and neck (9.2% vs.
17.6%, P < 0.001) and of the lentigo maligna subtype (15.7%
vs. 24.7%, P ¼ 0.005).
Mutation frequencies
Mutations were identified using the MelaCarta multiplex
assay (Agena Bioscience, San Diego, CA). Mutually exclusive
BRAF mutant and NRAS mutant tumors occurred at fre-
quencies of 38.7% (V600E 67%, V600K 31%, other 12%)
and 9.2% (Q61H 5%, Q61K 37%, Q61L 24%, Q61R 34%),
respectively (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1 online).
Further statistical analysis was performed for the BRAF and
NRAS mutant samples because of the low frequencies of
mutations in other genes.
Clinical and pathologic characteristics of lesions
Overall, patients older than 70 years were significantly less
likely to have BRAFV600E mutant melanomas than BRAF wild-
type melanomas [OR 0.08, 95% confidence interval (CI)
0.03e0.19] but were more likely to have melanomas
harboring BRAFV600K or NRAS mutations (Table 2 and
Supplementary Table S2 online). BRAFV600E mutations were
significantly more frequent in melanomas from women
(P ¼ 0.01), whereas NRAS mutations were more common in
melanomas from men (P ¼ 0.01). We observed that
BRAFV600E (P ¼ 0.01) and BRAFV600K (P ¼ 0.047) mutant
melanomas were more likely to harbor somatic mutations in
other genes on the melanoma panel than NRAS mutant
melanomas (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S2). Although
numbers were small, melanomas carrying somatic mutations

 in KRAS or EPHB6 were more likely to carry additional
mutations than melanomas without these mutations (see
Supplementary Table S3 online). Although the prevalence of
BRAF and NRAS mutations differed somewhat by histologic
subtype and anatomic site, the differences were not statisti-
cally significant. We found no statistical evidence that the
risks of BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K mutations differed by Clark
level
or
tumor
thickness;
however,
somewhat
against
expectation, we found melanomas with NRAS mutations
were significantly less likely to have marked dermal elastosis
(OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.07e0.95, P ¼ 0.03). Melanomas with
BRAFV600E mutations were significantly more likely to have
contiguous neval remnants than wild-type melanomas (OR
1.94, 95% CI 1.14e3.31, P ¼ 0.02), but melanomas carrying
other BRAF or NRAS mutations were not significantly asso-
ciated with this feature.
Phenotypic and environmental factors associated
with BRAF and NRAS mutations

mutations
(Table

and
Supplementary Table S4 online), but no associations with
NRAS mutations. In contrast, there were inverse associations
between the numbers of excised skin cancers and BRAFV600E
mutational status (p-trend ¼ 0.04). The numbers of skin
cancers were also inversely associated with BRAFV600K
mutations, although the trend was of marginal significance
(p-trend ¼ 0.06). The measure of cumulative sun exposure
(summed from a matrix capturing recreational and occupa-
tional sun exposure for all career episodes since leaving
high school) showed an unusual pattern of association
with BRAFV600E and BRAFV600K mutations. Although not

 statistically significant, relative risks of BRAF mutant mela-
noma were higher for patients with intermediate categories of
cumulative sun exposure than for those with the highest
levels of sun exposure. No consistent associations between
markers of cumulative sun exposure and risks of NRAS
mutant melanoma were observed, although it was notable
that risk estimates were less than unity for all categories of
solar keratosis counts and for having three or more skin
cancers excised (Table 3). There were no consistent associ-
ations between hair or eye color and risks of any type of
BRAF mutations or NRAS mutations. However, patients with
BRAFV600K mutant melanomas were significantly more likely
to have blue/gray eye color (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.00e5.65,
P ¼ 0.049). In addition, patients with BRAFV600E mutant
melanomas were significantly less likely (p-trend ¼ 0.02) to
report having any extent of facial freckling as a teenager
compared with patients with BRAF wild-type melanomas;
associations between freckling and other mutation types
were not significant. A family history of melanoma was
associated with BRAFV600E mutation status (OR 1.85, 95% CI
1.06e3.21, P ¼ 0.03). Other characteristics were assessed for
associations with BRAF/NRAS mutational status, but in the
main these were unremarkable (see Supplementary Table S5
online).
Somatic mutations and MC1R variants
In this series, 84% of melanoma patients carried one of the
nine common MC1R variants, with 53% carrying red hair
color (RHC) variants and 31% carrying non-red hair color
(NRHC) variants (see Supplementary Tables S6 and S7

samples
overall
(Table
5
and
Supplementary Table S8 online). In site-specific analyses
(trunk melanoma; head and neck melanoma), we found no
evidence that the risks of BRAF mutations were associated
with MC1R variants, regardless of the type of variant. We
repeated the analyses by excluding patients with lentigo
maligna melanoma subtype, but this made no material
difference to our conclusions (see Supplementary Table S9
online). We also observed no association between the
number of MC1R polymorphisms and either BRAF (P ¼ 0.38)
or NRAS (P ¼ 0.83) mutation status.
DISCUSSION
We assessed the frequency of somatic mutations in 25 putative
melanoma genes in a large community-based series of 414
primary cutaneous invasive melanomas. Mutation prevalences
were <2.5% for all genes except BRAF and NRAS, which
occurred mutually exclusively at frequencies of 39% and 9%,
respectively. Previous community-based series of primary
cutaneous melanomas have reported BRAF mutations at fre-
quencies ranging from 32% to 39% in Australian populations,
20e22% in Spanish, Austrian, and German populations, 44%
and 64% in Italian populations, and 43% in the United States

 2010; Thomas et al., 2007). In all prior series, BRAFV600E
mutations were at least three- to fourfold more common than
BRAFV600K mutations, as we found. Importantly, we found that
BRAF mutant melanomas were significantly more likely than
wild-type BRAF melanomas to carry mutations in other genes
on the MelaCarta panel (Agena Bioscience), whereas NRAS
mutant melanomas were not.
As expected, we found that the somatic mutation status of
melanomas was correlated with a number of clinical and
phenotypic features. BRAFV600E mutant melanomas were
more likely than wild-type BRAF melanomas among women,
younger patients, and those with high nevus counts, contig-
uous neval remnants adjacent to the tumor, and a family
history of melanoma. These findings are in accordance with
previous studies examining BRAF status and characteristics of
patients with cutaneous melanoma (Fargnoli et al., 2008;
Thomas et al., 2007). In addition, patients with BRAFV600E
tumors were less likely than those with wild-type BRAF
tumors to have phenotypic features indicative of high
cumulative sun exposure, such as high numbers of actinic
keratoses or a history of prior skin cancer excisions.
Earlier reports have suggested that melanomas carrying
BRAFV600K mutations have been exposed to higher levels of
cumulative sun exposure than other melanomas, but we
found no evidence supporting that conclusion (Jewell et al.,
2012; Mar et al., 2015; Menzies et al., 2012). In our large
series, patients with BRAFV600K melanomas were significantly
less likely than patients with wild-type BRAF melanomas to
report prior history of non-melanoma skin cancer and were
not significantly different in terms of self-reported lifetime sun
exposure, numbers of actinic keratoses, or dermal elastosis
adjacent to the melanoma. Even though the series reported
here is the largest and most comprehensively annotated to
date, the number of cases with BRAFV600K mutations was still
modest (n ¼ 33), so our study suffers from a lack of statistical
power to explore these associations fully. Pooling data from
comparable studies to increase the sample size would permit
more definitive assessments of the role of cumulative sun
exposure in the development of BRAFV600K melanomas. We
note with interest, however, that BRAFV600K melanomas were
even more strongly associated with total nevus count than
BRAFV600E melanomas, providing strong evidence that these
tumors arise through a nevus-prone pathway.
A synergistic relationship between germline MC1R variants
and somatic BRAF mutations was suggested by Landi and
colleagues (2006), in which people with MC1R variant
genotypes carried a significantly increased risk of developing
BRAF mutant melanoma in skin not damaged by sunlight.
Analyses of Spanish and Austrian samples found a modest
trend between germline MC1R status and somatic BRAF
mutations in melanomas from trunk sites with an inverse
association between MC1R and BRAF for melanomas of the
head and neck (Hacker et al., 2013). Other studies conducted
in North Carolina (Thomas et al., 2010b), Australia (Hacker
et al., 2010), and Germany (Scherer et al., 2010) have not
observed associations between MC1R status and increased
risk of somatic BRAF mutations. This latest investigation,
comprising a community-based sample of 414 patients with
cutaneous melanoma of predominantly Northern European
and Anglo-Celtic ancestry exposed to high levels of ambient
UV radiation, also found no association between germline
MC1R variants and somatic BRAF mutations. These con-
flicting findings across different populations highlight the
complexity of gene-environment interactions in the devel-
opment of melanoma. The model proposed by Thomas et al.
(2010a) to explain this discordance illustrated opposing
effects of MC1R status and highlighted a role for pigmenta-
tion in photoprotection and generation of oxidative stress.

 cohorts, with >60% of the Australian, US, and German
cohorts carrying one of the MC1R RHC variants, whereas the
Spanish, Austrian, and Italian cohorts carrying MC1R RHC
variants only accounted for <45% (Supplementary Table S6).
The downstream effects of MC1R on cellular function
appears to vary depending on the polymorphisms, thus it is
possible that the discordance between studies could relate to
the variation in MC1R allele frequencies in the different
populations as well as the differences in environmental
conditions and patterns of UV radiation exposure.
Melanoma risk is intricately associated with pigmentation
characteristics, and genomewide association studies have
revealed a number of genetic variants involved in pigmen-
tation, including MC1R, ASIP, OCA2, SLC45A2, TYRP1, and
TYR (Bishop et al., 2009; Duffy et al., 2010). The discordant
results across studies examining solely MC1R status as a
determinant for developing somatic BRAF mutant melanoma
may also be due to the confounding role of other pigmenta-
tion genes. It must also be noted that given the relatively
small sample size of all studies examining the association of
MC1R variants and BRAF mutant melanoma, we cannot rule
out the possibility that the differences in results are attribut-
able to chance alone. To expand this work, our future focus
needs to be on modeling the complex regulation of
pigmentation as a factor of genetic interactions and through
larger studies or meta-analyses.
Strengths of our study include the population-based sam-
pling frame and the detailed epidemiologic data (including
physician counts of nevi and actinic keratoses, blinded to
genotype status) accompanying the tumor specimens. The
call rate for somatic mutations was high using the MelaCarta
platform (Agena Bioscience), with mutation status deter-
mined for 98% of samples genotyped. Although we did not
fully sequence the entire MC1R gene, the variants genotyped
in this study comprise >95% of the nonsynonymous changes
observed (Kanetsky et al., 2006). We do not believe that
further sequencing to identify rare MC1R variants could
materially alter our null findings. A potential weakness was
the relatively limited number of samples for analysis because
of insufficient tumor material remaining for mutation analysis
after sections had been cut for diagnostic purposes. This is to
be expected from a community-based study conducted in
Queensland, Australia, where the majority of patients present
with thin melanomas (<1 mm). To assess possible selection
bias, we compared the prevalence of phenotypic (including
skin type, hair and eye color, freckling density, and counts of
nevi and actinic keratosis) and histologic (contiguous neval
remnants, thickness, anatomic site) characteristics as well as
the age and sex among those participants with and those
without tumor blocks available for analysis. We found that
the participants whose tumors were not genotyped were
slightly older, were more likely to have melanomas of the
head and neck, and were more likely to be of the lentigo
maligna subtype than those who were genotyped, but in
other respects they were not significantly different. Given
these features, it is possible that our sample had a higher
prevalence of BRAF mutations than melanomas arising in the
general population, although there is no reason to conclude
that the associations between BRAF mutation statues and
phenotype or other factors would differ.
In conclusion, these data from a large, well-characterized,
community-based sample of cutaneous melanomas provide
robust estimates of the somatic mutation frequencies of
putative melanoma genes. The study confirmed that BRAF
mutant melanomas differ from wild-type melanomas with
regard to associations with sun exposure, nevus propensity,
and host characteristics, with largely similar patterns of
association for BRAFV600E and BRAFV600K melanomas. There
was no evidence that MC1R status conferred particular risks
of mutations in BRAF, NRAS, or other genes. Taken together,
these findings highlight the diversity of mutation profiles in
melanoma and the heterogeneity of pathways through which
these cancers arise.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
We compared the prevalence of BRAF and NRAS mutations in
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded melanoma specimens from 414
patients ascertained from southern Queensland (latitude 27 degrees
south), Australia. Detailed descriptions of subject selection and data
collection for this study have been described previously (Kvaskoff
et al., 2013, 2015). Briefly, eligible patients were residents of
greater Brisbane, Australia, who were diagnosed between April 1,
2007, and September 30, 2010, with a histologically confirmed
primary invasive cutaneous melanoma arising on the head, neck, or
trunk. Those with metastatic melanoma or a previous diagnosis of
melanoma were not eligible. No acral lentiginous melanoma,
spitzoid, or nevoid lesions were included in this study. Of 1,456
eligible patients for the initial epidemiologic study, 808 (55%)
completed questionnaires, 766 (53%) provided written informed
consent to obtain specimens of archived melanoma tissue, and 414
(28%) patients had sufficient tissue remaining for mutation analysis
(Supplementary Figure S1). The age, sex, site, and histology subtype
distribution of the 414 patients who were genotyped differed from
the 352 patients who were not, as described earlier.
Approval to perform this study was given by the Human Research
Ethics Committee of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute.
The study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki, and all participants
gave written informed consent to take part in the study.
Histologic assessment
At the time of histologic diagnosis, collaborating dermatopatholo-
gists assessed the extent of solar elastosis in the skin adjacent to the
melanoma using a scale of four categories (nil, mild, moderate, and
marked) as previously described (Kvaskoff et al., 2013, 2015). In
addition, they assessed each tumor’s histologic type, tumor thick-
ness, and presence of neval remnants adjacent to the tumor. The
anatomic site of each melanoma was abstracted from the pathology
report and was confirmed directly with the patient.
DNA isolation
Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of each patient’s melanoma
were assessed for areas of normal and tumor tissue, and the
percentage of tumor cells was recorded. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded tissue sections were dissected to select areas in which
melanoma cells dominated over stromal cells. Punch biopsies
(2 mm) were taken from each tumor block, deparaffinized in xylene,
and washed twice in absolute ethanol. DNA was isolated using
Qiagen GeneRead DNA FFPE Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), with
additional proteinase K digestion at 56�C for 3 hours. DNA quan-
tification

 Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Saliva samples were also collected,
and DNA was extracted for MC1R genotyping from saliva samples
using Oragene saliva kits (DNA Genotek, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada)
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Genotyping
Genotyping was performed on the mass spectrometric genotyping
platform using an optimized multiplex assay of 25 common muta-
tions found in melanomas (MelaCarta Panel, Agena Bioscience),
which includes AKT3, BRAF, CDK4, CXCR4, CTNNB1, EPHA10,
EPHB6, ERBB4, GNA1, GNAQ, KIT, KRAS, MEK, MET, NEK10,
NRAS, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, PTK2B, ROR2, EGFR, IDH1, JAK2, ATK1,
and ABL1. An optimized multiplex assay of all nine common vari-
ants of MC1R (I155T, R142H, D84E, R160W, D294H, V92M,
R163Q, V60L, R151C) were used as previously described (Duffy
et al., 2004). Participants with none of the MC1R variants listed
were classified as wild type (WT) for these analyses. People carrying
one or more of the RHC alleles (R142H, D84E, R160W, D294H,
R151C) were classified as RHC variants, and people carrying one or
more of the NRHC alleles (I155T, V92M, R163Q, V60L) were
classified as NRHC variants (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7).
People carrying both RHC and NRHC alleles were classified as RHC
variants (Supplementary Table S7).
Phenotypic characteristics and sun exposure history
Relevant exposure data (including sun exposure history and skin
sensitivity) were collected from study participants through a self-
completed,
structured
questionnaire
as
described
previously
(Kvaskoff et al., 2015). After completing the questionnaire, each
participant was examined by the same dermatologist, who recorded
hair and eye color and counted the number of melanocytic nevi
(defined as brown to black pigmented macules or papules of any
size that are darker than the surrounding skin). Using a standard
international protocol (English et al., 1990), nevi were counted on
the back, neck, face, and upper limbs (left and right) using a trans-
parent plastic stencil. The numbers of actinic keratoses (defined as
superficial, rough scaly areas with erythematous background and
ill-defined margins) were counted on the dorsum of hands and
forearms, and on the face.
Statistical analysis
We performed simple cross-tabulations and calculated Pearson c2
and/or Fisher exact test (for cells with expected count <5) as a
measure of statistical association. We used multivariable logistic
regression to calculate ORs and 95% CIs as measures of association
between patient/tumor characteristics and mutation status. We
included terms for age stratum (<40, 40e49, 50e59, 60e69, 70þ
years) and sex to control for possible confounding introduced by the
study design. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant, and
all such tests were two sided. We tested for trend by including each
category as an ordinal variable in the multivariable model, with
category values taken as the midpoint of the range. All analyses were
performed using the SAS 9.4 statistical software package (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC).
