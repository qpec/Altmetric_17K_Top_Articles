Abstract
Background: Excess fat consumption has been linked to the development of obesity. Fat and salt are a common and
appetitive combination in food; however, the effect of either on food intake is unclear. Fat taste sensitivity has been
negatively associated with dietary fat intake, but how fat taste sensitivity influences the intake of fat within a meal has, to
our knowledge, not yet been investigated.
Objectives: Our objectives were, first, to investigate the effects of both fat and salt on ad libitum food intake and, second,
to investigate the effects of fat taste sensitivity on satiation responses to fat and whether this was affected by salt.
Methods: Forty-eight healthy adults [16 men and 32 women, aged 18–54 y, body mass index (kg/m2): 17.8–34.4] were recruited
and their fat taste sensitivity was measured by determination of the detection threshold of oleic acid (18:1n–6). In a randomized
2 3 2 crossover design, participants attended 4 lunchtime sessions after a standardized breakfast. Meals consisted of elbow
macaroni (56%) with sauce (44%); sauces were manipulated to be 1) low-fat (0.02% fat, wt:wt)/low-salt (0.06% NaCl, wt:wt), 2)
low-fat/high-salt (0.5% NaCl, wt:wt), 3) high-fat (34% fat, wt:/wt)/low-salt, or 4) high-fat/high-salt. Ad libitum intake (primary
outcome) and eating rate, pleasantness, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness (secondary outcomes) were measured.
Results: Salt increased food and energy intakes by 11%, independent of fat concentration (P = 0.022). There was no
effect of fat on food intake (P = 0.6), but high-fat meals increased energy intake by 60% (P < 0.001). A sex 3 fat interaction
was found (P = 0.006), with women consuming 15% less by weight of the high-fat meals than the low-fat meals. Fat taste
sensitivity was negatively associated with the intake of high-fat meals but only in the presence of low salt (fat taste 3 salt
interaction on delta intake of high-fat 2 low-fat meals; P = 0.012).
Conclusions: The results suggest that salt promotes passive overconsumption of energy in adults and that salt may override
fat-mediated satiation in individuals who are sensitive to the taste of fat. This trial was registered at the Australian New Zealand
Clinical Trials Registry (www.anzctr.org.au) as ACTRN12615000048583.

Introduction
Excess dietary fat consumption is recognized as a strong
contributing factor in the development of overweight and
obesity (1, 2). Foods high in dietary fat have a weak effect on
satiation and easily lead to overconsumption of energy due
to their high energy density (3–6). Fat and salt (sodium chloride)
provide a common and appetitive combination in highly
consumed foods such as crisps, chips, meat, cheese, and various
fast foods (7).
The role of salt in the overconsumption of energy and the
development of obesity deserves more attention (8, 9). A recent
Korean survey showed that, when corrected for energy intake,
obese persons have higher intakes of salt (10). Moreover, a liking
for salty and fatty foods was associated with higher total daily
energy intakes in adults (7), uncontrolled eating (11), and overweight
in children (12) than was a liking for sweet and fatty foods.
When salt is added to food, palatability increases, which
consequently leads to greater food intake (13–15). The role of
fat on palatability and food intake is complex (9, 16, 17).
Increases in fat content do not always lead to increases in
pleasantness but seem to depend on combinations with either
salt or sugar (18–20). We recently found that variations in salt
content are more closely related to food pleasantness than
variations in fat content (21). Therefore, salt may act as a vehicle
that stimulates the intake of fatty foods.
Satiety responses to dietary fat vary between individuals (22–
24). Oral and gastrointestinal sensitivity to FAs appears to be

 one factor influencing the satiating efficiency of dietary fat. Some
studies have found that fat taste sensitivity (i.e., oral sensitivity
to FAs) is related to dietary fat intake, with those who are more
sensitive to fat habitually consuming less dietary fat than those
who are less sensitive (25, 26). Changes in fat taste sensitivity
have also been seen after manipulation of dietary fat intake over
4-wk (27) and 6-wk (28) periods. A recent study found that
individuals who are more sensitive to fat taste have stronger
satiety responses to fat (i.e., the capacity of a food, in this case
fat, to control subsequent hunger and eating) (29). To our
knowledge, it has not yet been investigated whether fat taste
sensitivity influences satiation (i.e., meal size or intrameal satiety)
from fat. If there is an effect of fat taste sensitivity on satiation
from fat, it is not known whether this effect is influenced by
increasing palatability by the addition of salt.
We hypothesized that salt plays a major role in ad libitum
food intake, whereas fat has a more passive role but a greater
impact on energy intake. Second, we hypothesized that individ-
uals who are more sensitive to the taste of fat will have stronger
satiation responses to fat in foods [consuming less of high-fat
(HF)4 than of low-fat (LF) meals] than less sensitive individuals.
In addition, we hypothesized that the effect of fat taste sensitivity
on fat-mediated satiation is weaker in high-salt (HS) foods than
in low-salt (LS) foods.
Methods
Experimental design. This study was designed as a 2 3 2 crossover
study in which participants consumed 4 lunches ad libitum—1) LF/LS, 2)
LF/HS, 3) HF/LS, or 4) HF/HS—on 4 separate days after a standardized
breakfast. The order of the 4 lunches was randomly assigned between
participants according to the Williams design. The LS meals did not
contain any added salt, and the salt concentration in the HS meals was
estimated to have optimal pleasant saltiness on the basis of previous
studies (15, 21, 30). In addition, fat taste sensitivity was established in
duplicate by determination of the threshold of oleic acid (18:1n–6),
which was assessed in 2 separate sessions.
Participants. The number of participants needed was calculated to be
49 on the basis of a 10% difference in intake (in g) between LS and HS
meals (15), with the following assumptions: a = 0.05, 2-sided, power of
80%, and a variation of 25%. Fifty-six participants between 18 and 55 y
of age were recruited (January–April 2015) at Deakin University,
Victoria, Australia; and data collection occurred between 17 February
and 21 May 2015. Exclusion criteria were as follows: smoking, gained or
lost >5 kg weight during the past year, lack of appetite, difficulties with
eating or swallowing, pregnancy, and breastfeeding. Three partici-
pants dropped out before the commencement of the study, and 5
participants dropped out after the first session because of work-related
issues, wheat intolerance, or dislike of the food. The remaining 48
participants (16 men) were aged between 18 and 54 y (mean 6 SD: 25 6
6 y). The BMI (in kg/m2) range was between 17.8 and 34.4 (mean 6 SD:
23.8 6 3.9). The dietary restraint score of participants was measured
according to factor 1 of the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (31). The
mean 6 SD restraint score was 8.2 6 3.8. Participants were informed
about the procedure of the study and gave written consent before participa-
tion. This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the
Declaration of Helsinki, and the Deakin University Human Research Ethics
Committee approved all procedures involving human participants. The
checklist published in the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting
Trials) statement (32) was used for preparation of this report. This study was
registered at the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR,
ACTRN12615000048583).
Test foods. The ad libitum lunch consisted of 750 g cooked elbow
macaroni (Coles home brand) with 600 g sauce. The nutrient compo-
sitions of the meals were calculated by using Foodworks7 (Xyris
Software) (Table 1). The LF/LS sauce consisted of 100% (600 g)
tomato passata [0.2% fat, 0.08% NaCl, wt:wt; Remano (ALDI)]. The
LF/HS sauce consisted of 100% (600 g) tomato passata with 3.3 g
NaCl (0.2% fat, 0.5% NaCl, wt:wt). The HF/LS sauce consisted of
60% (360 g) tomato passata, 30% (180 g) canola oil (Coles home
brand), and 10% (60 g) thickened cream sauce (34% fat, 0.06% NaCl,
wt:wt; Coles home brand). The HF/HS sauce had the same ingredients
as the HF/LS sauce with the addition of 3.3 g NaCl (34% fat, 0.5%
NaCl, wt:wt). The HF sauces were homogenized for 3 min at 10,000
rpm (Silverson L4RT homogenizer). A concentration of 0.5% NaCl in
the sauce was expected to be an optimal pleasant salt concentration
(15, 21, 30).
Plain mini-croissants (Coles home brand) were used as a standardized
breakfast. The macronutrient composition was as follows: 8.5 g protein,
46.8 g carbohydrate, 26 g fat, 382 mg sodium, and 1800 kJ (429 kcal)
energy/100 g. The number of served croissants was calculated for each
subject separately on the basis of 18% of energy of daily energy needs.
The daily energy needs for each subject were estimated by the Schofield I
equation (33), taking into account sex, age, and weight.
Procedures. Participants attended 6 sessions over 6 d at the Centre of
Advanced Sensory Science at Deakin University. In 4 sessions, separated
by ;1 wk, participants consumed a standardized breakfast at either
0830 or 0930 h and an ad libitum lunch at either 1230 or 1330 h,
respectively. Fat taste sensitivity was assessed in the other 2 sessions,
as described below. Participants� height (cm) and weight (kg) were
measured at the first visit.
Participants were required to consume all of the served breakfast
(croissants) and were allowed to drink water. Participants were
instructed not to eat or drink (except for water) between breakfast
and lunch. In the ad libitum lunch sessions, participants completed
a questionnaire to determine whether they ate or drank anything
between the meals.
At the ad libitum lunch sessions, participants were served macaroni
with sauce and were instructed to eat until comfortably full. The total
amount served was 1350 g, so that participants could eat as much as they
wanted without asking for more; this excessive amount was expected to
diminish the effects of self-monitoring the amount consumed (34). In
addition, participants received a jug of water and were allowed to drink
as much water as they wanted.
Ad libitum intake, eating rate, and appetite and hedonic ratings.
The ad libitum food intake was calculated as the difference in the weight
of the bowl with food before and after intake. The intake in grams was
used to calculate the energy intake expressed in kilojoules. The eating
rate (g or kJ/min) was calculated by dividing the ad libitum food or energy
intake by the total eating duration (min). Participants were instructed to
turn on a light as soon as they started eating, and as soon as they had
finished the researcher assessed the eating duration (s) by using a stopwatch.
In addition, the amount of water that participants drank was reported by
weighing the jug with water before and after the lunch.

 Participants completed several appetite and hedonic questions before
and upon completion of the lunch by using Compusense Five Software
version 5.2 (Compusense, Inc.). They rated their feelings of hunger,
fullness, prospective consumption, and thirst. When the food was served,
subjects tasted 1 bite of their meal and rated the perceived pleasantness
of and their desire to eat the served meals. All of the questions were
answered by using a 100-mm visual analog scale that was scaled from
‘‘not at all’’ (0) to ‘‘very much’’ (100).
Fat taste sensitivity. The threshold for oleic acid was assessed by an
ascending method of the 3-alternative forced-choice test, in duplicate, in
2 different sessions (35). For test sample preparation, oleic acid was
mixed at varying concentrations (0.02, 0.06, 1, 1.4, 2, 2.8, 3.8, 5, 6.4, 8,
9.8, 12, and 20 mM) with long-life skim milk (99.9% fat-free;
Devondale). Textural cues were minimized with an addition of 5% (wt:
vol) gum acacia (Deltagen) and 5% liquid paraffin (vol:vol; Merck). To
prevent oxidation, samples were mixed with 0.01% (wt:vol) EDTA
(Merck). Samples were homogenized for 30 s/100 mL solution (Silverson
L4RT homogenizer). Control samples were prepared in the same manner
but without the addition of oleic acid.
Participants were instructed to refrain from drinking (except for
water) and eating at least 1 h before the start of each session. To prevent
confounding from nonoral sensory inputs, participants wore nose clips
and milk samples were presented under red-light conditions. Participants
were presented with 3 milk samples [1 sample that contained the FA
(starting with the lowest concentration) and 2 controls] and were asked
to select the sample that tasted different from the other 2. After an
incorrect response, a higher FA concentration was presented. After a
correct response, the same FA concentration was presented. The
detection threshold was defined as the concentration that was identified
correctly 3 consecutive times. Eight participants showed a detection
threshold that differed by >3 concentrations when measured in 2
different sessions. These participants were invited for a third session,
after which the 2 closest measured detection thresholds were averaged
and the outlying measurement was omitted (35).
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed by using SAS
version 9.3 (SAS Institute). Data are presented as means or adjusted
means 6 SEMs. P values <0.05 were considered to be significant. Effects
of fat (LF compared with HF) and salt (LS compared with HS) and their
interaction on ad libitum food and energy intakes, eating rate, pleasant-
ness, and desire to eat were tested in a mixed linear model (PROC MIXED)
that included the participant as the repeated factor. Sex had an effect on
intake, pleasantness, and desire to eat, although only for fat and not for salt
(see Results); therefore, sex 3 fat was included as a covariate in the mixed
linear model. The order of presentation had an effect on intake only for fat;
therefore, order 3 fat was also included as a covariate in the mixed linear
model on intake. Dietary restraint score, age, and BMI did not affect ad
libitum intake and were therefore not included in the mixed model.
Appetite ratings from before compared with after lunch within a
session were assessed with paired t tests. The effects of fat and salt and
their interaction on delta appetite ratings (after intake – before intake)
were tested in a similar mixed linear model as described above.
The effects of fat taste sensitivity (detection threshold of oleic acid),
salt, and salt 3 fat taste sensitivity on delta food intake of HF compared
with LF meals were assessed in a generalized linear model that included
order and sex. The delta food intakes of HF compared with LF meals
between the most sensitive participants [expressed in different percent-
ages (25–75%) for who had the lowest detection threshold of oleic acid]
compared with the remaining participants were assessed in generalized
linear models (separately for LS and HS) that included order and sex.
Tukey-Kramer adjustments were used for all post hoc comparisons.
Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess relations
between various outcome measurements.
Results
Effects of fat and salt on ad libitum food and energy
intakes. The HS meals resulted in an ;11% higher food intake
(P = 0.022) and energy intake (P = 0.031) compared with the LS
meals (Figure 1). Fat did not affect food intake (P = 0.60), but
the HF meals resulted in an ;60% higher energy intake
compared with the LF meals (P < 0.001) (Figure 1B). No salt 3
fat interactions were observed for food (P-interaction = 0.95) or
energy (P-interaction = 0.61) intakes. There were sex 3 fat
effects for food (P-interaction = 0.006) and energy (P-interaction
< 0.001) intakes, with the differences between men and women
reported below. In addition, there were order 3 fat effects on
food (P-interaction = 0.023) and energy (P-interaction = 0.003)
intakes; participants consumed less food and energy with the HS
meals when presented for the second time than when served the
first time. Salt did not interact with sex or meal order to affect ad
libitum food or energy intake.
Participants drank 166 6 20 g water with the LF/LS meal,
226 6 25 g water with the LF/HS meal, 182 6 20 g water with
the HF/LS meal, and 262 6 41 g water with the HF/HS meal.
Water consumption was affected by salt (P = 0.002) but not by
fat (P = 0.15). Water intake (in g) and food intake did not
correlate in any of the 4 meals (LF/LS: r = 0.15; LF/HS: r = 0.10;
HF/LS: r = 0.03; HF/HS: r = 20.08; all P > 0.3).
Pleasantness, eating rate, and BMI. There was a main effect
for salt (P < 0.001) but not for fat (P = 0.90) on pleasantness
(Figure 2). Ratings of desire to eat the meals also showed a higher
desire for the HS meals than for the LS meals (P = 0.033), but no
effect of fat was observed (P = 0.83). The eating rate expressed as
g/min was not affected by fat or salt content (Table 2); however,
eating rate was affected by fat when expressed as kJ/min.
Food intake was positively correlated with eating rate (g/min;
LF/LS: r = 0.56; HF/LS: r = 0.52; HF/LS: r = 0.69; all P < 0.001);
however, this was not significant for the LF/HS meal (P = 0.18).
Food intake was positively correlated with pleasantness ratings,
although this was significant only for the HF meals [r = 0.50

 (P < 0.001) and r = 0.32 (P = 0.028) for the LS and HS meals,
respectively]. Eating rate (g/min) was positively correlated with
pleasantness; however, this was significant only for the HF meals
[r = 0.35 (P = 0.016) and r = 0.34 (P = 0.019) for the LS and HS
meals, respectively]. BMI was positively correlated with food
intake for the HF/HS meal (r = 0.34, P = 0.019) but was not
significant for the other meals. BMI was not significantly
correlated with delta food intake of HF compared with LF meals
(i.e., difference in food intake of HF and LF meals) for both LS
and HS meals (both P > 0.19) but was positively correlated with
eating rate (g/min) for each meal (r = 0.29–0.37; all P < 0.05).
Sex differences. Sex effects were found for fat on food intake,
pleasantness, and desire to eat. Significant interactions of sex 3
fat were found for food and energy intakes as described above.
Women had 15% less intake by weight of the HF meals
compared with the LF meals (P = 0.036), but men did not (P =
0.55) (Figure 3). Moreover, both pleasantness and desire to eat
showed sex 3 fat interactions (P-interaction = 0.016 and 0.006,
respectively). Post hoc comparisons showed higher desire to eat
for the HF meals than for the LF meals for men (P = 0.046) but
not for women (P = 0.17). Eating rate (g/min) was not affected
by sex (P = 0.50) or sex 3 fat (P = 0.12). There were no sex 3
salt interactions on food or energy intakes, pleasantness, or
desire to eat (all P > 0.18). Dietary restraint scores did not differ
between men and women (7.9 6 1.1 compared with 8.4 6 0.6,
respectively; P = 0.65).
Appetite ratings. Ratings of hunger, fullness, and prospective
consumption before lunch did not differ between meals (Table
3), indicating that participants were in a similar state of satiety
before ad libitum intake. Hunger ratings decreased, fullness
increased, and ratings of prospective consumption decreased
significantly after ad libitum intake of each meal (all P < 0.001).
Thirst decreased after the LF/LS, HF/LS, and HF/HS meals (P <
0.05) but not after the LF/HS condition (P = 0.20). There were
no main effects of fat on decrease in hunger (delta), increase in
fullness, or decrease in ratings of prospective consumption
(Table 3). HS meals resulted in a stronger decrease in prospective
consumption and tended to result in a stronger decrease in
hunger (P = 0.20) compared with the LS meals (Table 3).
Fat taste sensitivity and food intake of HF compared with
LF meals. The intraclass correlation for the 2 measured
detection thresholds of oleic acid between participants was 0.84
(95% CI: 0.70, 0.90; P < 0.001). The frequency distribution of
the mean detection thresholds is shown in Supplemental Table 1.
The mean detection threshold for all participants was 4.6 6
0.35 mM. Fat taste sensitivity did not significantly differ between
men and women (men: 4.5 6 1.1 mM; women: 4.7 6 0.9 mM; P =
0.92). There was no correlation between fat taste sensitivity and
BMI (r = 0.03, P = 0.83). To assess the effects of fat taste sensitivity
on differences in food intake of HF compared with LF meals, the
delta food intake (intake of HF meal – intake of LF meal) was
calculated for both LS and HS meals. There was no main effect of
fat taste sensitivity on delta food intake (P = 0.18) and no main
effect of salt (P = 0.92); however, there was a significant fat taste
sensitivity 3 salt interaction (P-interaction = 0.012).
Figure 4 shows the delta food intakes of the most sensitive
participants against the remaining less sensitive participants.
The most sensitive 25% [n = 12 (3 males), threshold oleic acid
#1.4 mM, Figure 4A] and 33% [n = 15 (4 males) threshold oleic
acid #1.7 mM, Figure 4B] consumed less of the HF meals
compared with the LF meals than the least sensitive participants
consumed, but only for LS meals. Despite differences in food
intake, changes in appetite ratings (i.e., decrease in hunger and
prospective consumption and increase in fullness) after con-
sumption of the HF/LS meals did not differ significantly between
the 25% or 33% most sensitive participants compared with the
remaining participants (all P > 0.30). Figure 5 shows the delta
food intake (HF meals – LF meals) plotted against percentages of
the most sensitive participants for both LS and HS meals
separately. The difference between HF and LF meals disap-
peared when the sensitivity decreased (increasing percentage of
the most sensitive participants) in the LS meals, whereas this
effect was not observed in the HS meals.
Discussion
The results show that salt increased food and energy intakes by
11% independent of fat concentration. The addition of salt, but
not fat, increased pleasantness, which probably explains the
higher food intake due to salt. The higher intake of the HS meals

Salt promotes passive overconsumption of fat

 was accompanied by stronger decreases in ratings of prospective
consumption and hunger, whereas this was not influenced by fat.
The excessive increase in fat content (0.6 compared with 15.5
g/100 g and 6% compared with 62% of energy from fat) hardly
affected intake in grams but led to a 60% higher energy intake.
The present study emphasizes how dietary fat easily leads to
overconsumption of energy within a meal. However, the partic-
ipants with the lowest fat taste thresholds (most sensitive to fat)
consumed less of the HF meals than of the LF meals, but only in
the LS condition. In addition to the overall effect of salt in driving
passive overconsumption of fat, these results suggest that salt
overrides fat-mediated satiation in fat taste–sensitive individuals.
We did not find interaction effects of salt and fat on food
intake, which indicates independent effects. The present study
shows that fat does not necessarily need salt for the consumption
of excess energy. However, in real-life situations, foods high in
dietary fat are most likely accompanied by a salty, savory, or
sweet taste and are not just a fatty tasting food (7, 36–38). In this
perspective, salt does promote overconsumption of dietary fat,
simply because fatty foods without another dominant taste are
not common and are unlikely to be consumed. In line with this,
others have proposed that sugar may act as a vehicle that drives
fat intake (38). Meals containing mostly salty/savory foods and
high-fat foods at meals were found to have greater potential to
influence daily energy intake than were snacks (5), probably
because meals are larger eating episodes and therefore give
greater opportunity to overconsume. This suggests an important
role for salt in the overconsumption of dietary fat.
As expected, the HS meals led to greater water consumption
than the LS meals. Participants were free to consume as much
water as they wanted. The results showed no relation between
food and water intakes, which is in line with a study that clearly
showed that drinking water with meals does not interfere with
food intake (39).
In the present study, the 33% of participants who were most
sensitive to fat taste consumed less of the HF meal than of the LF
meal. This is in line with previous studies showing that fat taste
sensitivity is negatively related to intake of dietary fat (25–28).
The present study showed stronger satiation responses to fat in
fat taste–sensitive individuals, in addition to stronger satiety
responses, which has previously been shown (29). Sensitive
individuals consumed less during lunch after a fixed high-fat
breakfast than after a high-protein and high-carbohydrate
breakfast, whereas less sensitive individuals did not show this
effect (29). Fat taste sensitivity may be related to satiety
responses from FAs in the gastrointestinal tract, because both
oral and gastrointestinal responses to FAs were weaker in obese
compared with lean individuals (24). Together, this suggests
that the lower intake of dietary fat in fat taste–sensitive
individuals is possibly regulated by fat-mediated satiation, as
suggested in the present study, in addition to fat-mediated

 satiety (29) and possibly also to a lower attraction to fatty
foods in general.
However, we found that salt overrides the fat-mediated
satiation in fat taste–sensitive individuals. This overruling effect
of salt on fat taste perception was recently shown, whereby fat
taste sensitivity was inversely related to the most preferred fat
content (i.e., sensitive individuals preferred lower fat contents
than did less sensitive individuals); however, this relation was
nullified when salt was added (21). As discussed earlier, fatty
foods in real-life situations do not just taste ‘‘fatty’’ but generally
have another dominant taste such as salty, savory, or sweet. This
means, in practice, that fat-mediated satiation in fat taste–
sensitive individuals may play a minor role in adjusting for fat
intake. Therefore, foods high in dietary fat are also a risk factor
for overconsumption of energy for individuals with sensitive fat
taste due to the other tastes or flavors present.
The role of dietary fat on the overconsumption of energy has
been suggested to mainly act via satiation rather than satiety
(40); however, it has been suggested that, joule-per-joule, fat also
has a weak satiety efficiency compared with carbohydrates (41).
The present study clearly shows that intake within a meal is not
controlled by energy density, in accordance with many other
studies (e.g., 39, 42–45). Given the fact that fat is the most
energy-dense macronutrient compared with proteins and car-
bohydrates, it is easily overconsumed within a meal or snack, in
line with studies showing that excessive fat intake from a single
meal or snack leads to marked short-term positive energy
balances (4, 5, 40, 46–48).
The relation between BMI and fat taste sensitivity remains
contentious. The present study and others did not find this
relation (29, 49, 50), whereas other studies did (25, 26, 51, 52).
The overconsumption of energy from dietary fat acts mainly via
satiation or acute food intake (40). We showed that fat-mediated
satiation in fat taste–sensitive individuals is easily overruled by
salt and probably also by other taste qualities or flavors in real-
life situations. Therefore, the weak action of fat on satiation and
the overruling factors of other flavors could be a possible
explanation why relations between BMI and fat taste sensitivity
are not always found.
The present study showed that women consumed less of
the HF compared with the LF meals by weight, but men did not.
In addition, only men but not women preferred HF meals over
the LF meals. Higher liking for and intakes of fat (7) or salty and
fatty foods (11) in men have been shown before. In 1 study (7),
the authors explained this by a stronger dietary restraint
behavior generally found in women (53). However, we did not
find differences between men and women on restraint scores or
an effect of restraint 3 fat on food intake. The differences in
visual appearance of the LF and HF meals were obvious, and
awareness of fat plays a role in food intake (54), which possibly

 affected women more than men. Sex effects in response to fat
intake may also be explained by hormonal differences in satiety
responses. Fat intake stimulates the satiety peptides cholecysto-
kinin (CCK) and peptide YY (PYY). Estradiol was found to
affect the meal intake and increased the vagal sensitivity to CCK
(55). Reports on sex differences of postprandial and fasting PYY
concentrations showed conflicting results and did not focus on
acute meal responses (56). However, it should be noted that the
sex effects of the present study need to be interpreted with care
due to the low number of men compared with women.
A limitation of the study is that we measured the intake of
only 1 food. We did not find a main effect of fat on pleasantness;
however, this depends on the type of food. Generally, higher
amounts of fat seem to be better liked in solid than in liquid
foods (19, 20). Moreover, the excess fat in the HF meals was
unrealistic but stresses the lack of satiation signals from the
excess amount of fat in most individuals. Another limitation is
that we did not measure energy compensation after the meal, but
this excess energy intake was unlikely to be compensated for, at
least not within a day. Others have shown that HF, energy-dense
meals led to a markedly higher daily intake of energy (3, 5, 57).
This is in accordance with other studies that showed poor
compensation after energy overconsumption in general (58, 59).
In conclusion, an excessive increase in dietary fat (from 0.6 to
15.5 g/100g) did not have a main effect on food intake by
weight; however, it led to a 60% higher energy intake. The
addition of salt increased pleasantness and food and energy
intakes independent of fat concentration. Therefore, salt pro-
motes passive overconsumption of dietary fat. Individuals with
sensitive fat taste are able to adjust for fat intake, although this
effect seems to be overruled by the increase in pleasantness due
to the addition of salt.
