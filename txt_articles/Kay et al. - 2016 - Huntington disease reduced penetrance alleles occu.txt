Huntington disease reduced penetrance
alleles occur at high frequency in the
general population
ABSTRACT
Objective: To directly estimate the frequency and penetrance of CAG repeat alleles associated
with Huntington disease (HD) in the general population.
Methods: CAG repeat length was evaluated in 7,315 individuals from 3 population-based cohorts
from British Columbia, the United States, and Scotland. The frequency of $36 CAG alleles was
assessed out of a total of 14,630 alleles. The general population frequency of reduced pene-
trance alleles (36–39 CAG) was compared to the prevalence of patients with HD with genetically
confirmed 36–39 CAG from a multisource clinical ascertainment in British Columbia, Canada.
The penetrance of 36–38 CAG repeat alleles for HD was estimated for individuals $65 years of
age and compared against previously reported clinical penetrance estimates.
Results: A total of 18 of 7,315 individuals had $36 CAG, revealing that approximately 1 in 400
individuals from the general population have an expanded CAG repeat associated with HD
(0.246%). Individuals with CAG 36–37 genotypes are the most common (36, 0.096%; 37,
0.082%; 38, 0.027%; 39, 0.000%; $40, 0.041%). General population CAG 36–38 pene-
trance rates are lower than penetrance rates extrapolated from clinical cohorts.
Conclusion: HD alleles with a CAG repeat length of 36–38 occur at high frequency in the general
population. The infrequent diagnosis of HD at this CAG length is likely due to low penetrance.
Another important contributing factor may be reduced ascertainment of HD in those of older age.

Huntington disease (HD) is a dominant neurodegenerative disorder marked by motor abnormal-
ities, cognitive impairments, and behavioral disturbances.1 A CAG repeat longer than 35 trinu-
cleotides in exon 1 of the Huntingtin gene (HTT) defines an allele capable of causing the HD
phenotype, with reduced penetrance at 36–39 CAG repeats.2–4 The frequency of repeat alleles
$36 CAG in the general population is unknown. Although many control cohorts have been
assessed by exome or whole-genome sequencing,5 short-read technologies are unable to accurately
assess HTT CAG repeat lengths.6 In this study, we estimate the frequency of individuals in the
general population with $36 CAG repeats in several large, randomly ascertained samples from 3
Western countries, using current genetic diagnostic standards for HD.4
The smallest CAG repeat length associated with the HD phenotype is 36, but repeat lengths
of 36–39 CAG have been found in asymptomatic elderly individuals, indicating that the lower
end of the HD CAG repeat range is incompletely penetrant over the average human lifespan.7,8
Using our general population frequency of reduced penetrance CAG repeat alleles, we directly
estimate the penetrance of 36–38 CAG repeats among individuals $65 years of age. We
compare our direct penetrance rates to estimates from clinical cohorts in order to evaluate
penetrance bias that may result from clinical ascertainment. To our knowledge, this study offers

 the first large-scale assessment of $36 CAG
repeats in a randomly selected control popula-
tion, and the first attempt to directly assess the
penetrance of alleles in the reduced penetrance
range.
METHODS Study populations. A total of 3,952 saliva-
extracted
DNA
samples
were
obtained
from
the
Coriell
Personalized
Medicine
Collaborative
(CPMC)
Community
Cohort.9 The CPMC advertised to health care providers at local
hospitals as well as to the general public through coverage in local
media and by word of mouth. Participants were 18 years of age or
older. Participants were not recruited based on the presence or
absence of any disease phenotype. Samples used for this study
were limited to those who explicitly consented to have their
samples used in research beyond the scope of the CPMC.
Samples were anonymized before use in this study.
A total of 2,016 anonymous general population samples were
obtained from a population-based research DNA sample set held
by NHS Grampian, Scotland. All DNA was originally extracted
from buccal swabs taken from participants of a historic antenatal
cystic fibrosis screening study conducted in Aberdeen, Scotland.
General population controls from British Columbia, Canada,
were obtained from a large archived cohort of samples previously
collected for the purpose of lipid screening as part of routine clin-
ical bloodwork. Donors were not recruited or collected on the
basis of any specific lipid profile or disease and were reported to
be representative of British Columbia’s general population in that
they were largely Caucasian individuals of Northern European
ancestry. A subset of 1,600 permanently anonymized samples was
randomly selected from the archived collection of approximately
6,000 DNA.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. For the CPMC, saliva samples were collected in person
following a group informed consent session. Only individuals who
consented to share their DNA were included in this analysis. The
CPMC protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional
review board (IRB) of the Coriell Institute for Medical Research.
In addition, the use of samples in this analysis was also reviewed
and approved by the IRB of the Coriell Institute for Medical
Research. Ethical approval to share fully anonymized material
from the archived University of Aberdeen cohort was obtained
from North of Scotland Research Ethics Committee (13/NS/
0025). Ethical approval for the secondary use of archived anony-
mous samples from British Columbia was obtained from the
University of British Columbia Children’s and Women’s Health
Centre Clinical Research Ethics Board (UBC C&W CREB)
(H06-70356). Ethical approval to examine CAG size distributions
in all 3 populations was obtained from the UBC C&W CREB
(H05-70532).
CAG and CCG repeat sizing. All samples in this study were
sized by an identical assay at the Centre for Molecular Medicine
and Therapeutics at UBC in Vancouver, Canada. CAG and
CCG repeat sizes were determined as previously described10
using fluorescently labeled primers flanking the CAG repeat
(HD344F,
5’-HEX-CCTTCGAGTCCCTCAAGTCCTTC-3’
and HD450R, 5’-GGCGGCGGTGGCGGCTGTTG-3’) and
CCG repeat (HD419F, 5’-AGCAGCAGCAGCAACAGCC-3’
and HD482R, 5’-6FAM-GGCTGAGGAAGCTGAGGAG-3’).
A third PCR encompassing both CAG and CCG sequences
(HD344F,
5’-HEX-CCTTCGAGTCCCTCAAGTCCTTC-3’
and HD482R, 5’-GGCTGAGGAAGCTGAGGAG-3’) was used
to exclude allelic dropout and to phase CAG and CCG sizes from
the first 2 sizing assays.3,4,11 Sizing was performed relative to a con-
trol panel of sequenced CAG and CCG repeat lengths. CAG repeat
alleles were classified as normal (,27 CAG), intermediate (27–35
CAG), or HD-associated ($36 CAG). HD-associated CAG repeat
alleles were classified as reduced penetrance (36–39 CAG) or full
penetrance ($40 CAG). From the original DNA sample sets, 46
CPMC samples, 201 University of Aberdeen samples, and 6 UBC
samples failed CAG repeat sizing.
Haplotype analysis. General population individuals with at
least one CAG repeat $36 were genotyped at a minimum of
63 single nucleotide polymorphisms across the Huntington gene
as previously described.12 Reconstructed risk haplotypes (A1, A2,
or A3a) were phased to CAG repeat length by haplotype-specific
CCG
and

described10,12 or by haplotype homozygosity.
Frequency and age-dependent penetrance estimates.
Bayesian binomial 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all CAG allelic
and genotypic frequencies were calculated using binom and ggplot2
in R. For allelic frequency differences between general population
samples, x2 tests were performed using contingency tables. The
number of individuals $65 years old in British Columbia was
derived from Statistics Canada for the 2012 prevalence year and
multiplied by the genotypic frequency of CAG 36, CAG 37, and
CAG 38 in our general population sample to estimate the number
of individuals $65 years old in British Columbia with each geno-
type. Patients ascertained in our 2012 British Columbia prevalence
cohort with diagnostic CAG repeat lengths confirmed by the
Molecular Genetics Laboratory at the British Columbia Children
and Women’s Hospital were included for estimates of age-
dependent penetrance of CAG 36–39 alleles.13 To derive age-
dependent penetrance, the number of clinically ascertained,
genetically confirmed patients $65 years old with each reduced
penetrance CAG repeat length was divided by the number of
individuals $65 years old expected to have that repeat length in
British Columbia in 2012. Extrapolated clinical penetrance rates for
CAG 36, 37, and 38 by age 65 years were taken from multicenter
data published by Langbehn et al.14
RESULTS We assessed HTT CAG repeat length in
3,906 individuals from the adult general population
of the United States, 1,815 individuals from the
North of Scotland, and 1,594 previously reported
individuals from British Columbia, Canada.10 Out
of a total of 7,315 individuals (14,630 alleles), 18
individuals had HD-associated CAG repeat lengths
$36 (0.246%, 95% CI 0.151%–0.380%) (table 1).
Among individuals with HD-associated alleles, CAG
36–37 genotypes were the most common (36,
0.096%; 37, 0.082%; 38, 0.027%; 39, 0.000%;
$40, 0.041%) (figure 1A). Approximately 1 in 16
individuals (6.20%) have an IA genotype (453/
7,315; 95% CI 5.66%–6.76%), a small fraction of
whom carry 2 IAs (5/7,315; 0.068%). Across all 3
populations, IAs occurred at an allelic frequency of
3.13% (458/14,630; 95% CI 2.86%–3.42%). HD-
associated allele frequency (p 5 0.485, x2) and
intermediate allele frequency (p 5 0.080, x2) did
not significantly differ between samples from the
United States, Scotland, and Canada.

 We additionally sought to determine whether the
randomly ascertained $36 CAG repeat alleles found
in our general population sample occur on the same
genetic background as those found in patients with
clinically manifest HD. We performed HTT haplo-
type analysis in all 18 general population individuals
with alleles $36 CAG repeats. All but one general
population $36 CAG chromosome conformed to
our previously established HTT haplotypes of
disease-causing mutations in patients with manifest
HD of European ancestry, A1, A2, or A3a (figure
1B),12,15 suggesting that HD-associated CAG repeat
alleles in the general population occur on a similar
cis-genetic background to those in patients from the
clinic.
Fifteen of 18 (83.3%) incidentally ascertained
$36 CAG repeats are considered HD alleles of
reduced penetrance (CAG 36–39) by current Amer-
ican College of Medical Genetics diagnostic criteria
(table 2).4 However, in our recent multisource prev-
alence study of HD in British Columbia, Canada,
a much smaller proportion (15/353; 4.25%) of
genetically diagnosed patients with validated CAG
repeat lengths have CAG repeats in this range (figure
2A). Onset of HD typically occurs in adulthood, with
length of the expanded CAG repeat inversely related
to mean age at disease onset.14,16 Average age at onset
is latest in patients with CAG repeats between 36 and
41, suggesting that individuals with reduced pene-
trance alleles are more likely to manifest HD in old
age. Indeed, among symptomatic patients with a con-
firmed reduced penetrance genotype in British
Columbia, 80% (12/15) were $65 years of age as
of the April 1, 2012, prevalence date. We therefore
sought to estimate the minimum penetrance of this
allele class among individuals $65 years of age by
dividing the number of clinically ascertained, symp-
tomatic patients with each reduced penetrance CAG
genotype by the expected number of individuals with
each genotype in British Columbia (figure 2B).
CAG 37 is penetrant for HD in a minimum of
0.2% (95% CI 0.1%–0.4%) of individuals $65 years
of age. CAG 38 is penetrant for HD in a minimum of
2.0% (95% CI 0.6%–9.8%) of individuals $65 years

 of age. No patient with a validated CAG 36 genotype
was identified in our clinical prevalence cohort, pre-
cluding a penetrance estimate at this CAG length.
However, one deceased patient with confirmed
CAG 36 has been observed in the province since
genetic testing began in 1995, and 7 CAG 36 alleles
were observed in our general population sample, sug-
gesting that the penetrance of this allele for the HD
phenotype is less than CAG 37 but greater than zero.
No CAG 39 alleles were observed in our general
population control sample, and thus no expected fre-
quency of CAG 39 genotypes among individuals
$65 years of age could be calculated for a penetrance
estimate. However, two-thirds (10/15) of genetically
diagnosed British Columbia patients with validated
36–39 CAG repeat lengths were CAG 39, suggesting
that the penetrance of this allele for HD is greater
than for CAG 38. Extrapolated CAG 36–38 pene-
trance rates for HD by 65 years of age, derived from
survival analysis of a large, multicenter clinical cohort,
exceed our direct penetrance estimates across the
entire reduced penetrance allele class, at 6%, 10%,
and 19% by age 65 years for CAG 36, 37, and 38,
respectively (figure 2B).14
DISCUSSION We report an unexpectedly high
frequency of HD-associated alleles in the reduced
penetrance range of 36–39 CAG repeats. These
data suggest that approximately 1 in 400 individuals
have an expanded CAG repeat associated with HD in
Western populations and that approximately 1 in
2,500 have an HD allele in the full penetrance range.
Previous attempts to calculate the frequency of the
HD mutation have relied upon indirect methods of
extrapolating heterozygote frequency from the preva-
lence of diagnosed HD.17 Our direct estimates show
that the heterozygote frequency of $36 CAG in the
general population is up to 10-fold higher than indi-
rect estimates, but that the majority of these are HD
alleles of reduced penetrance (CAG 36–39). The fre-
quency of reduced penetrance alleles in the general
population thus appears to be underestimated by clin-
ical ascertainment, and individuals at risk of develop-
ing HD may be more numerous than previously
believed. Low clinical ascertainment of CAG 36–38
alleles is supported by an inferred ascertainment rate
of #5% in mutational flow models.18 It is notable
that the frequency of fully penetrant HD alleles in our
sample (0.041%; 95% CI 0.012%–0.109%) is

ber of symptomatic patients $65 years of age in BC in 2012 with each CAG repeat geno-
type divided by the number of individuals $65 years of age in BC expected to have each
expanded CAG repeat genotype.

 compatible with prior indirect estimates.17 For exam-
ple, we estimate that approximately 1 in 2,500 indi-
viduals have a full penetrance HD allele in the general
population, or approximately 3.0 times the multi-
source prevalence rate for British Columbia.13
Our data also suggest the penetrance of CAG 36–
39 for the typical HD phenotype may be lower than
estimated from clinical datasets. CAG-specific pene-
trance rates of HD alleles have been attempted using
clinical cohorts of mutation-positive individuals both
with and without clinical signs of HD,14,19 but these
estimates are thought to be biased for symptomatic
individuals, resulting in a corresponding bias toward
higher penetrance rates.20 Analysis of clinical records
of manifest and premanifest individuals with 36–39
CAG approximated a 60% chance of clinical diagno-
sis by 65 years of age.19 We show a much higher
frequency of 36–39 CAG repeat alleles in our general
population sample than are clinically ascertained at
this rate. For example, 15.8% of the population of
British Columbia was $65 years of age in 2012.
Given a 0.205% prevalence rate of 36–39 CAG gen-
otypes in the general population, approximately
1,400 British Columbians $65 years of age would
have had a 36–39 CAG allele in 2012, and at least
840 would have shown signs of HD given a 60%
penetrance rate by age 65 years. In contrast, our com-
prehensive 2012 prevalence study of HD in British
Columbia revealed only 15 affected patients with
CAG 36–39, comprising only 4.25% of all verified
genetic diagnoses of HD in the province, 13 of which
were in patients $65 years of age.13 This modest
proportion of 36–39 CAG alleles among genetically
confirmed patients is comparable to clinical cohorts
in Portugal, the Netherlands, and COHORT sites
across the United States, Australia, and Canada.21–23
Expanded CAG repeats between 36 and 41 result
in the oldest average age at onset in clinical cohorts,
with many patients manifesting motor symptoms
when older than 60 years.14,16 Late-onset HD may
also be characterized by milder signs and slower pro-
gression, which elude diagnosis as HD and may be
confounded by comorbid diseases of aging.24,25 The
absence of family history or overt motor features may
further prevent clinicians from considering a diagnosis
of HD in late-onset cases. It is therefore possible that
some individuals with reduced penetrance alleles
escape diagnosis or do not seek medical services for
early signs of HD. Given the high frequency of
reduced penetrance alleles in our study, genetic test-
ing for HD should be considered in those who pres-
ent with suggestive but mild clinical features,
particularly among the elderly. In premanifest indi-
viduals with $36 CAG repeats, clinical diagnosis of
HD is known to be preceded by a prodromal stage of
subtle motor and behavioral signs associated with
neuronal loss in the caudate nucleus.26 At present,
only individuals with clinically ascertained $36
CAG repeats have been evaluated for progressive pro-
dromal phenotypes.27,28 It remains unclear how many
elderly asymptomatic individuals with CAG 36–39
genotypes show prodromal signs of HD, and whether
such individuals would inevitably progress to HD
with increased longevity.
As sequencing technology improves, premanifest
individuals without a family history of HD could
incidentally discover the presence of an HD-
associated allele in their genome. In the absence of
population-based penetrance estimates for inciden-
tally ascertained HD alleles, particularly in the 36–
39 CAG repeat range, it will be challenging to counsel
these individuals about their chance of developing
HD.21 In this study, we estimate that 0.2% of indi-
viduals with CAG 37 and 2.0% of individuals with
CAG 38 are symptomatic for HD among individuals
$65 years of age. It is crucial to note that the number
of individuals who manifest HD with a reduced pen-
etrance allele will change with age structure, both
within the $65 years of age category and in the pop-
ulation as a whole. Our penetrance estimate should
therefore be considered in the context of the demo-
graphic structure of a specific population in a specific
year. Additionally, our penetrance estimates only con-
sider patients with a CAG 36–38 repeat allele con-
firmed within British Columbia. Some patients in our
prevalence cohort with strictly clinical diagnoses or
out-of-province genetic tests may have CAG 36–38
but are not included in our penetrance estimates. Our
data nonetheless show a bias toward higher pene-
trance estimates derived from clinical onset data,
and argue that the age-specific penetrance of $36
CAG repeat alleles for HD, particularly alleles CAG
36–38, may be lower than previously reported.
The frequency of intermediate alleles reported in
this study is comparable to smaller samples.10,22 It is
established that rates of paternal germline CAG repeat
instability increase across the intermediate allele
range, leading to a higher risk of expansion to $36
CAG repeat alleles in offspring.29,30 The unexpectedly
high frequency of individuals with CAG 36–37 in
this study suggests that fathers with reduced pene-
trance alleles, while at relatively low risk of developing
HD themselves, may play a larger role in transmitting
full penetrance HD alleles to the next generation than
previously appreciated.
It is unclear why some individuals bearing HD al-
leles with reduced penetrance (36–39 CAG) manifest
the classic HD phenotype as early as midlife, while
others
remain
asymptomatic
through
advanced
ages.19 Age at onset can vary widely between patients
with the same expanded CAG repeat allele.16,31 The
comparatively high frequency of reduced penetrance

 alleles in the general population suggests that addi-
tional genetic and environmental factors may modify
the likelihood of manifesting HD from these alleles
within a normal human lifespan.32 Given the small
proportion of individuals with CAG 36–38 repeat
alleles who manifest with clinical HD, genetic back-
ground may play a major role in the likelihood of
developing the disease in patients with reduced pen-
etrance genotypes.
We have shown an unexpectedly high frequency of
HD alleles with reduced penetrance (CAG 36–39) in
the general population. The manifestation of HD in
individuals with CAG repeat alleles in the reduced pen-
etrance range is likely low, but prodromal disease phe-
notypes may be underascertained among the elderly.
Individuals with reduced penetrance alleles may also
have an increased role in the expansion of CAG repeats
into full penetrance alleles in their offspring.
