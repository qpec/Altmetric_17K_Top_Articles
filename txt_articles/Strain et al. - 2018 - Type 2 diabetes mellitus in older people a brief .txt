Abstract
Rates of population ageing are unprecedented and this, combined with the progressive urbanization of lifestyles, has led
to a dramatic shift in the epidemiology of diabetes towards old age, particularly to those aged 60–79 years. Both ageing
and diabetes are recognized as important risk factors for the development of functional decline and disability. In
addition, diabetes is associated with a high economic, social and health burden. Traditional macrovascular and
microvascular complications of diabetes appear to account for less than half of the diabetes-related disability observed
in older people. Despite this, older adults are under-represented in clinical trials. Guidelines from organizations such
as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the European Association for the Study of Diabetes,
and the American Diabetes Association acknowledge the need for individualized care, but the glycaemic targets that are
suggested to constitute good control [HbA1c 53–59 mmol/mol (7–7.5%)] are too tight for frail older individuals. We
present a framework for the assessment of older adults and guidelines for the management of this population according
to their frailty status, with the intention of reducing complications and improving quality of life for these people.

Impact of diabetes in an ageing population
Rates of population ageing are unprecedented and this,
combined with the progressive urbanization of lifestyles, has
led to a dramatic shift in the epidemiology of diabetes
towards old age, particularly to those aged 60–79 years [1].
Both ageing and diabetes are recognized as important risk
factors for the development of functional decline and
disability [2], which are often compounded with impaired
quality of life [3]. In addition, diabetes is associated with a
high economic, social and health burden [4]. Traditional
macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes
appear to account for less than half of the diabetes-related
disability observed in older people [5], and it is now
acknowledged that frailty and muscle loss (sarcopenia) are
important new complications of diabetes, and are major risk
factors for disability. Their importance lies in the observation
that they are ‘pre-disabling’ conditions capable of therapeutic
intervention [6].
Current availability of clinical guidance and
recognition of complexity of illness issues
Effective management of diabetes in older adults requires the
appreciation by both clinicians and policy makers that care
has to take into account the increasing complexity of the
illness and that such care may need to operate over four
decades (60–90 years and older) and respond to the changing
circumstances of an individual’s health status [7]. People in
this age group are, however, routinely excluded from clinical
trials: indeed only 1.4% of clinical trials explicitly recruit

 older adults, and a smaller percentage still work specifically
with the frail [8]. This notwithstanding, several international
guidelines have been published, providing useful frameworks
for enhancing diabetes care for this population, albeit based
predominantly on consensus and opinion. Many of these
contain an indication of workable metabolic targets for older
adults [9–11], but, for a variety of reasons, these have failed
to have a widespread impact on glycaemic control in our
population of interest.
General lack of recognition of tailoring
goals of care to functional status and
presence of frailty
Diabetes management strategies for high-functioning older
people with an anticipated long life expectancy are similar to
those for younger people. Such strategies, when applied to
functionally impaired or frail individuals, however, may be
inappropriate and potentially unsafe if interventions with
more immediate adverse effects are used. Further, generic
metabolic targets with regard to glycaemia, lipid levels, or
even blood pressure, ignore the importance of holistic
personalized care in the presence of multi-morbidity or
moderate to severe frailty. This frailty is now seen as a major
factor in the increased risk of death and disability in older
people with diabetes [12]. It is of concern, therefore, that
frailty is not a routine part of reviews for older people with
diabetes. The recent launch of international guidance on the
management of frailty in older people with diabetes is timely
[13], and can be seen as a stimulus to identify what measures
are now needed within the National Health Service (NHS) to
create a ‘frailty-diabetes’ care pathway. Frailty can be
assessed routinely in clinical practice with minimal addi-
tional training for the workforce.
There is growing recognition that intensive glucose-
lowering treatment in Type 2 diabetes has limited benefits
and may in fact be dangerous for older people [14]. This
recognition should prompt clinicians to modify HbA1c targets
in those with limited life expectancy or living with severe
frailty; however, decades of ‘treat to target’ and ‘pay for
performance’ have resulted in many algorithms which do not
fully consider the individual requirements of older adults.
Further, the focus on traditional targets distracts attention
from optimizing quality of life or preparing for end-of-life
scenarios [7,11].
Need for closer working between primary
care teams and specialist care: problem of
communication, overprescribing and
avoidable hospital admissions
In younger people with diabetes, it is likely that any quality of
life impairments will be driven by either the consequences of
metabolic syndrome or the complications of diabetes itself.
For these people, a formulaic approach can be very successful
and many clinical trials using a step-wise algorithm have
achieved excellent glycaemic control in both active and
placebo groups. Managing the older complex person with
diabetes, however, may require a far more collaborative
approach between primary care and specialists working in the
community or hospital settings. Specialists in healthcare for
older adults bring additional expertise to the multidisciplinary
team, particularly given their greater experience in balancing
risk of multiple comorbidities, de-prescribing and community
management of conditions in order to reduce hospitalization.
Once appropriate teams are established, individualizing
care requires significant time investment, both in the assess-
ment of the person with diabetes and in the subsequent
discussions with the person with diabetes and their relatives.
Medical records will need updating to explain the approach
adopted and to ensure that this is shared with other health
professionals. It is important that establishing less aggressive
targets is not regarded as a decision ‘not to treat’; indeed, it
could be argued that failure to establish individualized
targets represents a dereliction of appropriate care. Experi-
ence has taught, however, that individualizing targets is far
from easy. To date, only one study has even attempted to
individualize care for older adults [15]. That study group
subsequently reported that, when asked to and given training
about how to personalize glycaemic goals for frail older adults
aged 70–98 years, experienced healthcare practitioners set a
mean target HbA1c of 53 mmol/mol (7.0%), despite the
clinical trial setting affording them the luxury of increased
consultation time and exemption from traditional algorithms
[16]. This put less emphasis on age, frailty measures,
comorbidities and polypharmacy in favour of considering
baseline HbA1c and local guidelines when target setting.
Purpose of ‘brief’
In the light of these urgent prevailing issues, and in
recognition of the limitations of current approaches to
What’s new?
• The population of older adults with diabetes is rapidly
growing.
• Older adults have a different natural history of disease,
attributable, in part, to shorter life expectancy, greater
comorbidity and increased risk of complications from
interventions.
• We present an updated approach to the assessment of
frailty in older adults with diabetes.
• Once evaluated, we provide guidance for establishing
individualized targets and suggest treatment algorithms
for both onward prescribing and de-prescribing thera-
pies for older adults in order to improve the quality of
life for these older adults with diabetes.

 managing older people with diabetes, we have felt it
imperative to develop a clinical framework in the area of
diabetes in older people, as part of a national stakeholder
initiative. This brief will serve three main purposes:
� To
emphasize
the
importance
of
routine
clinical
assessment for frailty in diabetes care systems which
provide a basis for a high utility, fit-for-purpose ‘assess-
ment toolkit’.
� To identify what the key priorities should be for promot-
ing high-quality individualized and safer care of older
people with diabetes.
� To establish clear goals which will act as framework for
physicians working with older adults with diabetes upon
which to base their collaborative targets.
Detecting frailty in the community and
development of an assessment toolkit
A number of approaches are available to detect the presence
of frailty in community-dwelling older adults which are
applicable to adults with diabetes [17]. These have been
subject to feasibility and validity reviews [18–21].
A general frailty assessment pathway for people diabetes
has recently been described (Fig. 1) [13]. The importance of
detecting frailty lies with the opportunity to consider
targeted interventions that reduce functional decline and
the risk of disability. NHS England and the British Medical
Association have recently offered to support the early
identification of frailty in people aged ≥65 years in the
2017/2018 General Practitioner Contract using a validated
tool such as the electronic Frailty Index [22] in the early
stages of the condition. In later, more severe states of
frailty, an additional clinical judgement by the practitioner
is required to confirm the severity of frailty and hence the
need for additional care/support. This should be comple-
mented by additional validated tools such as gait speed
assessment and application of the Clinical Frailty Scale [23].
The five-item FRAIL score (a questionnaire comprising five
components:
Fatigue,
Resistance
(difficulty
walking
up
stairs), Ambulation, Illness, and Loss of weight) has also
been widely validated in multiple countries and is increas-
ingly being used [24].
We suggest that these developments should be adapted
into diabetes care systems/pathways in both primary and
secondary care. They can be implemented with minimal
training and lead to a framework for the initial management
plan. Our recommended steps for detecting frailty in older
adults with diabetes are outlined in Fig. 1, including the
additional roles of specialist review.

 Priorities for improving high-quality
diabetes care
An NHS commissioning framework for older people with
diabetes has been available since 2010 [25]. Despite this, the
holistic management of older people with diabetes is often
inadequate and inappropriate because it fails to take account
of three important elements of care: complex illness man-
agement; the need for an individualized approach to care;
and an appreciation of age-related physiology and pharma-
cology which increase the risk of iatrogenic adverse drug
reactions [15,26].
The key features of a modern diabetes service sensitive to
the special needs of older people is summarized in Fig. 2. The
service will employ some members of its workforce trained in
comprehensive geriatric assessment, and have effective com-
munication channels with other agencies in social and
tertiary care including users to optimize the possibility of
quality diabetes care. In addition, such a service will need to
advocate management plans that set appropriate metabolic
goals according to functional status, assess hypoglycaemia
risk adequately to prevent unnecessary hospital admissions,
and emphasise the importance of maintaining or improving
functional health to reduce disability, reducing dependency
levels and ensuring best use of resources [7].
Framework for individualized goal-setting
The stakeholder group wish to acknowledge the increasing
concerns about inappropriate polypharmacy in older popu-
lations. This pharmaco-intervention can increase the risk of
falls and functional impairment, and lead to non-adherence,
adverse drug events and often both [27]. Although guidelines
from organizations such as the National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence (NICE) [28], the European Association
for the Study of Diabetes [29], and the American Diabetes
Association [30] acknowledge the need for individualized
care, the glycaemic targets articulated as constituting good
control [HbA1c 53–59 mmol/mol (7–7.5%)] are too tight for
frail older individuals.
We wish to establish guide treatment targets, therefore, for
the frail older adults who have been through our suggested
assessment process. It is important to acknowledge that these
targets are currently consensus- rather than evidence-based
because, currently, there is an absence of outcome data for
individualized goal setting. The lack of evidence, however, is
not a reason to maintain the status quo pending further
research; waiting for these data is often an implicit decision
not to act, or to act based on past practice rather than
attempting to modify our approach based on the best
available evidence. Our emphasis, therefore, is on frail older
adults, who are at an increased risk of over-treatment with
glucose-lowering medications [31]. We include recommen-
dations for de-prescribing, that is the process of withdrawing
inappropriate medications with the clear goals of enhancing
clinical outcomes and improving patient safety, in a manner
that may be undertaken without harm, whilst supporting
those practitioners who wish to optimize care for the people
with diabetes with whom they work [32].
Establishing targets for older adults
As previously stated, ‘biologically young’ older adults may be
regarded as having similar needs to adults aged <65 years. For
these individuals, a glycaemic target of 59 mmol/mol (7.5%)
remains the standard (Table 1). Practitioners should be
mindful of the risk of hypoglycaemia in these individuals
when adding in therapies, as the consequences of hypogly-
caemia may be just as significant in the fit as the frail older
adult with diabetes. We would therefore caution against the
Key features are:
•
Inter-professional ac�vity leading to an agreed diabetes and frailty care plan
•
A medica�on risk minimisa�on strategy to decrease unwanted adverse drug events, 
hospitalisa�on and hypoglycaemia
•
An ac�ve deprescribing policy that avoids over-prescribing of glucose-lowering and other 
medica�ons without compromising pa�ent safety
•
A review of diabetes and frailty status at the �me of care home residency
•
An easy access pathway to Pallia�ve Care Services when End of Life issues arise
•
Use of addi�onal outcomes of clinical care that can form the basis of mul�-professional 
audit (and na�onal audits of care) and be more aligned with the needs of the older adult 
with diabetes, e.g. quality of life, change in func�onal status, falls rate, admissions to 
hospital for hypoglycaemia

 introduction of insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas or glin-
ides) or short-acting insulins for these adults; however, an
individual who has good glycaemic control would not
necessarily require de-escalation of their medical regimen
unless there is evidence of overtreatment. Very few people with
diabetes aged >70 years would be anticipated to benefit from
intensive intervention to targets below 53 mmol/mol (7.0%).
This is not to suggest that a person treated with agents such as
metformin or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors that
are weight-neutral and have a low risk of hypoglycaemia
should have treatment de-escalated or the provision of
lifestyle advice abandoned, but interventions associated with
hypoglycaemia, weight loss or that otherwise limit the quality
of life may reasonably be discontinued. As with all people
with diabetes, communication can play a key element in the
effective management of older adults with diabetes. This is
particularly relevant at the key transition stages from a
regular clinic for people with diabetes into services more
focussed on frailty assessments. Another key area, as frailty
progresses, where communication requires additional empha-
sis pertains to the need for de-prescribing. In many individ-
uals who have fastidiously been adhering to their treatment
regimens for years if not decades, the transition to being told
to reduce or stop therapy can increase disease-related anxiety.
In this setting, the only potential intervention that may be of
use is additional time spent discussing the care, specifically
the changing physiological demands in ageing and the
increased risk of side effects from treatment [33].
Treatment of the mild to moderately frail
The mild to moderately frail population represents the
majority of older adults who have additional comorbidities
[34]. Their comorbidities and concomitant polypharmacy
place these individuals at increased risk of drug interactions
and adverse events. Also, on experiencing side effects, their
biological reserve may be depleted, reducing their ability to
respond. These individuals are not routinely included in
outcome studies; they are excluded because of their comor-
bidities, polypharmacy or generally poor prognosis, there-
fore it is impossible to attribute any benefit to treatment
robustly, and the timescales of even microvascular benefit in
studies, such as the UK Prospective Diabetes Study for
newly diagnosed people with diabetes and ACCORD,
ADVANCE and VADT in more advanced disease, suggest
that benefit from tighter glycaemic control is unlikely to be
achieved within anticipated life expectancy. HbA1c levels >
64 mmol/mol (8.0%) are associated with increased symp-
toms of polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia (particularly pertinent
in men who are often also experiencing the effects of benign
prostatic hyperplasia), and increased risk of urinary infec-
tions, candidiasis and impaired response to systemic infec-
tions.
They

with
infections,
hospitalizations,

suggest a level of ≤64 mmol/mol as a usual target for older
adults with mild to moderate frailty. Conversely there are

achieving
glycaemic
control below 59 mmol/mol (7.5%). If this goal is attained

life, these may be continued, but careful consideration of

course, the risk of hypoglycaemia with sulfonylureas and
shorter-acting insulin can have devastating consequences. As
such, we would recommend the evaluation of the symptoms
of our older adults with diabetes, with a very low threshold
for withdrawal of drugs in anyone with a HbA1c <59 mmol/
mol (7.5%).
Management of the very frail
Frailty itself is the most important prognostic indicator.
Many of the diagnostic elements of frailty, however, may
themselves represent side effects of interventions for dia-
betes. These include iatrogenic weight loss, hypoglycaemia-
induced cognitive impairment or depression associated with
polypharmacy of diabetes. A rational approach must be
employed, therefore, to ensure that whilst symptoms remain
controlled, over-aggressive pharmacotherapy is not attenu-
ating functional ability. Long-term protection ceases to be
a concern, as the prognosis of the very frail is such that
benefit is unlikely to be realized within the anticipated life
expectancy; therefore, it becomes desirable to review and de-
prescribe any treatment that does not serve to improve the
quality of life of the older adult with diabetes. With regard to
thresholds for the active de-intensification of therapeutics for
these individuals there are few, if any, data to support
ongoing treatment when HbA1c levels are below 64 mmol/
mol. It has been demonstrated, albeit in an observational
study, that functional outcomes over 2 years are better in
frail older adults with an HbA1c >64 mmol/mol (8.0%) than
those with values between 53 and 63 mmol/mol (7.0–7.9%)
[37]; therefore, because of the increased risk of side effects
from any intervention, we would recommend discontinuing
oral therapy for any severely frail person with an HbA1c <
64 mmol/mol (8.0%). Similarly, there is no evidence to
support intensive management of prandial glucose, therefore
short-acting insulins should also be discontinued because of
their significant risk of hypoglycaemia, unless there are
apparent
symptoms of postprandial hyperglycaemia. If
administration of fast-acting insulin analogues is required it
should be administered after meals on an ‘as required basis’
based on postprandial monitoring, in order to account for
the variable and unpredictable calorific intake when frailty
ensues.
Provision of education about diabetes and hypoglycaemia
both to the people with diabetes and to their carers remains a
principal
mechanism
to
bring
about
improvements
in
hypoglycaemic prevention and treatment, although currently
there is no common pathway, nor a validated approach to
provide this.
With regard to establishing targets to stimulate interven-
tion, again longer-term benefits of good glycaemic control
should not play a part in our decision making, but that is not
to say there should be no glycaemic targets at all. Chronic
hyperglycaemia
itself
has
negative
physiological
conse-
quences impairing the quality of life of the person with
diabetes; with osmotic diuresis leading to dehydration,
impaired vision and decreased cognition [35]. As a result,
we recommend HbA1c targets of <70 mmol/mol (8.5%) for
even the very frail older adults.
The choice of agents to achieve these targets are limited.
Whereas metformin is the logical choice given its low
frequency of hypoglycaemia and good cardiovascular profile,
up to 50% of very frail older people will have a contraindi-
cation to use, predominantly because of a reduced estimated
GFR. In addition to the risk of hypoglycaemia with sulfony-
lureas, their utility in the frail older adult developing b-cell
failure is limited. DPP-4 inhibitors have proven safety even in
the very frail, and have similar efficacy in the older
population to that in younger adults, and hence may be a
suitable option for those who are within 11 mmol/mol (1%)
of their goal. The use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor
agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones is limited
for the reasons described above. As a result, the use of insulin
becomes the logical intensification step in order to treat the
osmotic symptoms which lead to weight loss or lethargy or
other uncomfortable non-specific symptoms.
When prescribing insulin for frail older people with
diabetes, considerable thought should be given to the most
appropriate regimen. Choice may range from combination of
basal insulin and oral hypoglycaemic agents, through to
mixed insulin or, very rarely, a basal-bolus regimen. The
latter, of course, is the optimal regimen for the growing
population of older adults with Type 1 diabetes. For the
majority of frail adults, a simple approach of once-daily
isophane insulin in the morning, would provide a modest
peak in insulin availability after ~ 4 h, coinciding with the
main meal of the day. Because of the half-life of this insulin,
there will be negligible activity overnight. This minimizes the
risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia, but may increase risk of
nocturia,
with
associated
incontinence
and
candidiasis
caused by fluctuating hyperglycaemia. Should nocturnal
insulin be required, a once-daily regimen of long-acting
analogue insulin may be associated with a lower risk of
hypoglycaemia than twice-daily isophane insulin, which
would be relevant in this frail group [38]. The newer ultra-
long acting analogue insulin degludec has been reported to
lead to further reduction in severe and nocturnal hypogly-
caemia in younger populations compared with insulin
glargine [39], but this has not been explored in our
population of interest. Where self-injection is not possible,
community nursing support may be required to administer
insulin. In these cases, the protracted duration of insulin
degludec that has been demonstrated in younger adults [40]
may facilitate more flexibility in scheduling for community

 staff should the extended duration of activity be verified in
this population.
Conclusions and way forward
We agree that providing better care and support for people
living with frailty is both a key challenge and opportunity for
the NHS, as recognized in the ‘NHS Five Year Forward
View’ [22]. Diabetes is the most common chronic metabolic
disorder in the UK and is an important risk factor for the
development of frailty. The focus for diabetes healthcare
professionals, in collaboration with older adults with dia-
betes, should be on preventing diabetes-disabling states in
older people which lead to dependency and institutionalisza-
tion and rising health and social care costs. Our proposal to
promote the introduction of a frailty assessment scheme as
part of routine diabetes management should allow more
appropriate and safer treatment strategies to be employed for
this continuing relatively neglected older population.
