Stress during pregnancy widely associates with epigenetic changes and psychiatric
problems during childhood. Animal studies, however, show that under specifi
c postnatal
conditions prenatal stress may have other, less detrimental consequences for the
offspring. Here, we studied mental health and epigenome-wide DNA methylation in
saliva following intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy in São Gonçalo, a
Brazilian city with high levels of violence. Not surprisingly, mothers exposed to pregnancy
IPV expressed elevated depression, PTSD and anxiety symptoms. Children had similar
psychiatric problems when they experienced maternal IPV after being born. More
surprisingly, when maternal IPV occurred both during (prenatal) and after pregnancy
these problems were absent. Following prenatal IPV, genomic sites in genes encoding
the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) and its repressor FKBP51 (FKBP5) were among the
most differentially methylated and indicated an enhanced ability to terminate hormonal
stress responses in prenatally stressed children. These children also showed more DNA
methylation in heterochromatin-like regions, which previously has been associated with
stress/disease resilience. A similar relationship was seen in prenatally stressed middle-
eastern refugees of the same age as the São Gonçalo children but exposed to postnatal
war-related violence. While our study is limited in location and sample size, it provides
novel insights on how prenatal stress may epigenetically shape resilience in humans,
possibly through interactions with the postnatal environment. This translates animal
fi
ndings and emphasizes the importance to account for population differences when
studying how early life gene–environment interactions affects mental health.

Prenatal Stress Epigenetically Shapes Resilience
INTRODUCTION
Psychological stress during pregnancy, like maternal depression
and intimate partner violence (IPV), has widely been associated
with detrimental effects in the child (Monk et al., 2012). Effects
on child mental health over-represent the literature, such as
increased risk of psychiatric problems like attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia,
major depression and anxiety related disorders (O’
Connor et al.,
2005; Lupien et al., 2009; Fine et al., 2014; Babenko et al., 2015;
O’
Donnell et al., 2017). However, not all individuals exposed
to stress develop stress-related problems. Many appear to have
psychiatric resilience, showing no or better outcomes despite
severe stress exposures (Rutter, 1999; Russo et al., 2012).
In animals, prenatal stress sometimes leads to general shifts
toward what appears to be adaptations in the offspring to the
stressful environments (Bateson et al., 2014). In these studies
outcome is highly dependent on the postnatal environment,
where for example prenatal stress in rodents leads to behavioral
changes that are beneficial in predator rich environments but
not otherwise (St-Cyr and McGowan, 2015). Analogies have
been reported in several taxa including primates, but in humans
they remain speculative in nature (Sheriff et al., 2009; Giesing
et al., 2010; Nettle et al., 2013; Berghänel et al., 2016). The
best human example can be seen in infants consistently exposed
to maternal depression, both pre- and postnatally, which are
protected against the negative mental effects seen in infants
of mothers with depression either pre- or postnatally (but not
during both periods) (Sandman et al., 2012). This indicates that
an interaction between the pre- and postnatal environments may
shape mental health also in humans. A reason why evidence is
mostly lacking in humans could therefore be that prenatal stress
studies rarely target postnatal exposures in environments with
high levels of stress. Growing up in communities characterized
by poverty, crime and violence predicts stress related disorders
such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and
conduct problems (Elbert and Schauer, 2002; Fowler et al., 2009).
Studying the consequences of prenatal stress in communities with
high levels of violence could therefore yield unique insights into
the interactions between the pre- and postnatal environments,
insights that could be particularly important for understanding
human mental disorders.
Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, are
important for reprogramming the genome following early life
stress (Oberlander et al., 2008; Monk et al., 2012; Babenko
et al., 2015; Serpeloni et al., 2016; Vangeel et al., 2017), and
are believed to shape psychiatric resilience (Rutter et al., 2006).
A well-known example is the epigenetic regulation of the
glucocorticoid receptor (GR; gene: NR3C1) and its chaperone
FK506 binding proteins 51 (FKBP51; gene: FKBP5). Both
proteins have been studied extensively for their involvement in
the hypothalamic–
pituitary–
adrenal (HPA) axis, a physiological
pathway that mediates key elements of the stress response.
GR uses the stress hormone cortisol as a ligand, and when
activated represses the stress response, while FKBP51 exerts
a short-loop feedback by inhibiting the nuclear translocation
of GR (Zannas and Binder, 2014). Epigenetic dysregulation of
NR3C1 and FKBP5 have repeatedly been observed in psychiatric
disorders following early life stress (Binder et al., 2008; McGowan
et al., 2009; Spijker and van Rossum, 2012; Klengel et al.,
2013). The reprogramming of specific genes may, however, only
represent pieces of the full epigenome-wide consequence of
stress (Hunter et al., 2015). Cortisol exposure in young children
is, for example, associated with genome-wide loss of DNA
methylation in repetitive heterochromatin-like regions, which
are genomic regions normally silenced by DNA methylation
(Nätt et al., 2015). How stress-related genes and epigenome-
wide mechanisms interact in shaping human mental health is
poorly understood.
Here, we aimed to investigate the psychiatric and epigenome-
wide consequences of prenatal stress, in the form of IPV during
pregnancy, in a human population exposed to high levels of
violence. IPV affects one third of the women worldwide (Devries
et al., 2013). In the present study, we targeted women and
children in São Gonç
alo, a city located in Rio de Janeiro state
in Brazil. São Gonç
alo’
s population exceeds one million, with
high proportion of low-income families and high levels of
community/domestic violence (CDV) (Assis et al., 2009). In a
previous study targeting the same population, we showed that
the epigenome-wide consequences of IPV and CDV in this
population can be detected in grandchildren of grandmothers
exposed to violence (Serpeloni et al., 2017). Here, we focus on
the more immediate epigenetic and psychiatric consequences
of IPV, by obtaining epigenome-wide saliva DNA methylation
and psychiatric profiles of children exposed to prenatal IPV.
We hypothesized that exposure to prenatal IPV in the high
violence communities of São Gonç
alo will have different
consequences than what has been reported in studies of less
violent communities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
São Gonç
alo subjects, 122 grandmothers, 122 mothers, and 120
children were recruited via the “
Family strategy program”of the
city of São Gonç
alo (Brazil) as described before (Serpeloni et al.,
2017). Children (46% male) mean age were 13.1 (range = 8–
18);
mothers 37.9 (range = 25–
51); grandmothers 64.0 (range 46–
88)
years. Sociodemographic variables of mothers and children can
be found in Table 1.
Pre- and Postnatal Stress
All São Gonç
alo participants were interviewed individually
in their homes. Measures of interpersonal violence during
pregnancy focused on the periods before, during, and after
pregnancy, as described in Radtke et al. (2011). We used two
instruments: the Composite Abuse Scale (CAS) (Hegarty et al.,
1999, 2005) and the Things I Have Seen and Heard Scale
(TSHS) (Richters and Martinez, 1990). CAS measures the degree
of IPV through 30 items scaled from 0 (never) to 5 (daily)
that together form four dimensions: severe combined abuse,
physical abuse, emotional abuse and harassment. An IPV/CAS
score >3 was used as cut-off for generating IPV+ and IPV−

groups, which previously been shown to represent consistent IPV
(Hegarty et al., 2005). Life time exposure scores used the weighted
summarization method described in Radtke et al. (2011). TSHS
(Richters and Martinez, 1990) contains 20–
26 items that measure
exposures to community and domestic violence (CDV). Items
are presented in a 5-point format ranking from zero (never) to
four (many times). Experience of IPV is not included in TSHS,
with exception of witnessing parental interpersonal violence.
Trauma exposure was measured through a checklist of 16 items
(e.g., natural disasters, physical assault, sexual assault) adapted
from Neuner et al. (2004). Maternal care was assessed using the
Parental Bonding Instrument (Parker et al., 1979).
Stress-Related Disorders
Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in the children was
measured using the University of California at Los Angeles Post-
traumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index for DSM-IV (Steinberg
et al., 2004). For adults the Post-traumatic Stress Diagnostic
Scale (PSSI) was used instead (Foa, 1995). Depression and
anxiety were assessed using the Patient-Health-Questionnaire
(PHQ-9) (Richardson et al., 2010) and the 7-item scale for
generalized anxiety disorders (GAD-7) (Spitzer et al., 2006).
Behavioral problems in children was measured using the Strength
and Difficult Questionnaire (SDQ), (Goodman et al., 1998)
which allocates behavioral attributes to five subscales: emotional
symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity, peer problems, and
prosocial behavior.
Generating DNA Methylation Data
For the São Gonç
alo subjects, saliva samples (2 ml) were collected
and DNA isolated using the Oragene-Discover (OGR-500)
Collection Kit (DNA Genotek, Ottawa, ON, Canada). DNA was
bisulfite-converted and analyzed using HumanMethylation450
BeadChips (Illumina, Inc.) at the Queen Mary University
of London (United Kingdom) according to manufacturer’
s
protocols. Targeted bisulfite resequencing was used to technically
validate 10 CpGs on the BeadChips in 33 randomly chosen
individuals, using a service provided by Zymo Research
Corporation (Irvine, CA, United States). This involved bisulfite
conversion using EZ DNA Methylation-Lightning Kit (Zymo),
followed by Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Results and primer
sequences are found in Supplementary Table S2.
Preprocessing and Quality Control of
DNA Methylation Data
A chart of the full bioinformatics analysis is available in
Supplementary Figure S1. Preprocessing and statistical analysis
was carried out in R 3.3.2 or SPSS (IBM, v.23). An R script
is available in Supplementary Text S1, which automatically
performs all preprocessing steps given the input files in
Supplementary Data S1–S4. Instructions on how to use the
script are contained within the script itself.
The hg19 human reference genome was used in all analysis.
Raw São Gonç
alo bead array data (idat files) were imported and
preprocessed in R using different functions available in minfi
package as described in Aryee et al. (2014). Successful bisulfite
conversion and hybridization were verified using minfi/qcReport.
We used the recommendations by Chen et al. (2013) to
filter probes known to cross-hybridize with multiple genomic
locations (nprobes = 30,969), contain or neighboring common
polymorphisms (nprobes = 162,255), or were annotated to the
X/Y chromosomes (nprobes = 8,360). Probes with low detection
signals (p > 0.01; nprobes = 5,526) in any of the samples were
also excluded (Aryee et al., 2014). The final São Gonç
alo dataset
contained 272,636 high quality CpGs after filtering.
Confirmation that individuals were assigned to unique
families was done using the 65 SNP probes available on the
beadchip. We also confirmed that all subjects’sex, age, and
sample type (saliva) matched the predicted epigenetic sex, age
and sample type estimated by minfi (Aryee et al., 2014). In
total, the São Gonç
alo dataset contained 120 children (prenatal
IPV+ = 21, IPV− = 99) and 122 adult women (prenatal
IPV+ = 23, IPV− = 99), of which most were mothers to the
children (pregnancy IPV+ = 18; IPV− = 104; full families = 115).
Genome-Wide Differential DNA
Methylation Analysis
Filtered data were quantile normalized using default settings
in minfi/preprocessQuantile. Logit-transformed beta values (M-
values) were subjected to a robust linear regression model
to identify significantly differentially methylated (DM) probes
in association with prenatal IPV, adjusted for multiple testing
(Benjamini–
Hochberg method), using the Limma package
(Ritchie et al., 2015). To minimize the effect of outliers due
to the presence of rare SNPs in target CpG sites, we used the
robust method in the lmFit function in limma (for more details,
see Supplementary Figure S4). For the São Gonç
alo children
and women the model had prenatal IPV exposure (IPV+ versus
IPV−) as main effect, and age, biological sex, prenatal CDV, and
prenatal trauma scores (maternal exposures during pregnancy)
as covariates. Again an IPV/CAS score >3 was used as cut-off
for generating prenatal IPV+ and IPV− groups (Hegarty et al.,
2005). An extended model with additional covariates is present
in Supplementary Table S1. The covariates in the analysis of
the contrast datasets may have differed (see section “
Analysis of
Contrast Datasets”below).
To generate the genomic context graphs of NR3C1 and FKBP5
(Supplementary Figure S5), data were downloaded from UCSC
genome browser (hg19). Histone and transcription factor binding
data were taken from the default Integrated Regulation from
ENCODE Track (Layered H3K4Me1, H3K4Me3, H3K27Ac,
and Txn Factor ChIP) which contains data from multiple
cell lines. For the Txn Factor ChIP, only the areas closest
to candidate CpGs were considered, and due to the relative
abundance of peaks at the NR3C1 CpG, only transcription factors
with at least two peaks was retained for this gene (links to
original graphs see Supplementary Figure S5). To generate
heterochromatin/euchromatin coverage graphs (Figure 2D),
ENCODE data for PBMC specific H3K9me3 and H3K4me3
ChIP-seq experiments were downloaded from the SYDH Histone
Track in the USCS genome browser (GEO access: GSM788075
and GSM788084). To minimize differences in background noise

between H3K9me3 and H3K4me3, the y-axes of these graphs
were set by the average signal of the first and last bp of
the 6,000 bp window (±3,000 bp relative CpG location). The
same approach, but using genomic ranges downloaded from the
ChromHMM Core 15 dataset (Ernst and Kellis, 2012) (Roadmap
Epigenomic Project1), was used to visualize the overlap with
defined chromatin states in cells present in saliva (for details, see
Supplementary Figure S6). To partly control for polymorphism
acting in trans we searched the mQTLdb database2 (accessed
07/15/2018) for previously identified methylation QTLs in the 31
differentially methylated CpGs reported in Table 2 (see footnote
2). The PLINK childhood (age 7) and adolescence (age 15–
17) datasets (at any genomic distance) were used since these
were corrected for sex, batch effects, cellular heterogeneity and
genetic structure.
Stress-Induced Methylome Switching
and Retrotransposon Analysis
The R script available in Supplementary Text S1 will perform
a methylome switching analysis on normalized beta-values
from the São Gonç
alo samples (Supplementary Data S1), as
well as downloaded data from the Grady Study (see section
“
Analysis of Contrast Datasets”below). Methylome switching
was calculated by classifying each CpG into two categories:
>50% or <50% methylation (hetero- and eu- chromatin-like,
respectively) based on mean percent methylation of each CpG
across subjects. We used K-means clustering analysis (K = 2),
in the children and mothers, respectively, to validate the
50% cut-off. All classification was done within cohorts. As a
result, the number of CpGs in each category differed slightly
between datasets, since some CpGs may have been classified
as heterochromatin-like in one cohort, but euchromatin-like in
another. In downstream analysis, we further divided these two
categories into those CpGs with or without a repeat region
within ±50 bp, using the GenomicRanges package (Carlson et al.,
2014) and repeat coordinates from RepeatMasker3. Average DNA
methylation of each category were then calculated for the top 1%
differentially methylated CpGs in respective dataset. We choose
to rank the CpGs by Bayesian B-values instead of p-values,
to circumvent any issue with p-value cut-off levels. The 1%
threshold was chosen based on previous data (Nätt et al., 2015),
as well as observations in Figure 2E. The progressive proportion
graphs (Figure 2E) were constructed using information from
RepeatMasker (repeat class; see footnote 3), and UCSC genome
browser (CpG islands and exons). Since CpGs available on the
Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChips are not a random
subset, we choose to normalize the graphs so that all category
lines originated from a 50% ratio at the level of all probes
(100% top ranked). Bootstrap resampling to generate expected
distributions given the CpG panels available on the beadchip was
conducted using the boot package in R. Information in RepBase
(Bao et al., 2015) was used to extract probes within ±50 bp of
recently active L1 retrotransposons unique to the human linage.

Cell Type and Genetic Ancestry
To control for genetic structure and cell type heterogeneity
bias between IPV+ and IPV− groups in São Gonç
alo children,
we extracted the minfi beta-values, imported them into GLINT
1.0.3 (Rahmani et al., 2017b) and attained the factor scores
from the methods listed below. Analysis within GLINT used the
default settings. For genetic ancestry analysis EPISTRUCTURE
was used (Rahmani et al., 2017a), while ReFACTor was used
for reference free cell type analysis (Rahmani et al., 2017b).
Since, saliva contains white-blood cells (Theda et al., 2018) we
used the Houseman (Houseman et al., 2012) blood reference
available in GLINT, as well as a custom-made reference for panel-
based cell type analysis. The custom reference was built using
the Houseman method (Houseman et al., 2012), but was based
on CpGs differentially methylated between saliva, buccal and a
pool of the other tissues available in GEO dataset GSE48472. The
reference panel can be found in Serpeloni et al. (2017), imported
into GLINT and integrated into Houseman pipeline for saliva
cell type analysis.
Statistical Models
For
an
overview
of
the
statistical
models
used,
see
Supplementary Figure S1. Following the initial genome-
wide analysis in R/limma, we applied general linear models
(GLMs) in SPSS 23 for all group comparisons. Care was taken to
assure that the data met GLM assumptions. For the São Gonç
alo
dataset, model design was the same as for genome-wide analysis,
using the same IPV classification (main factor) and covariates
(age, sex, prenatal trauma, and prenatal CDV). Models of the
contrast datasets are presented below.
Analysis of Contrast Datasets
If not otherwise stated, sample handling, preprocessing and
genome-wide analysis of the contrast datasets were performed the
same way as for the São Gonç
alo children and women datasets.
For consistencies, we only analyzed CpGs that were in common
with the São Gonç
alo datasets.
Refugee children presented in Figure 3 came from war
refugees that migrated to Germany between 2010 and 2016
(n = 48; 60% females; 11–
19 years old; 75% middle eastern;
83% Islamic). Bisulfite converted saliva DNA was hybridized to
Infinium MethylationEPIC (Illumina, Inc.), and was therefore
separately analyzed compared to the other contrast datasets.
239,442 CpGs were in common with the São Gonç
alo datasets
after filtering. To test differences between IPV+ (n = 15) and
IPV− (n = 33) we used a similar statistical model as for the São
Gonç
alo children, with the same IPV threshold (CAS score > 3).
As covariate, instead of prenatal CDV, we used prenatal scores of
organized violence calculated using the Event Checklist for War,
Detention, and Torture Experiences as described in Onyut et al.
(2009). Results were not affected by cell-type heterogeneity and
genetic ancestry as described above.

signal threshold across all cohorts including the São Gonç
alo
children (nCpGs = 235,960). The São Gonç
alo women (mothers)
dataset was presented above, with the São Gonç
alo children.
The Grady dataset has been described in details previously
(Zannas et al., 2015). Files were downloaded as Illumina
HumanMethylation450 BeadChips raw signals from Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO, accession number: GSE72680). Only
samples with sex, age (co-variates) and information on whether
the participant had undergone psychiatric treatment (main
factor) were retrained and imported into R. Quality control,
filtering and normalization were performed as for the São
Gonç
alo dataset. The final dataset contained 367 individuals
(70% females; 18–
77 years old; 91% African American).
Groups were generate according to psychiatric treatment of
either depression, bipolar disorder, PTSD or anxiety disorder
(nyes = 140, nno = 227). We did not observe group differences
in cell-type heterogeneity and genetic ancestry as described
above. The R script available in Supplementary Text S1 will
automatically download, preprocess, and perform an epigenome-
wide association and methylome switching analysis on the
Grady data, using the input files in Supplementary Data S1–S4.
Instructions are contained within the script.
Ethics Statement
Approvals were obtained in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki by the Ethical Committee of the University of
Konstanz (Germany; permit UNIKON IRB st No. 4/2015) and
the National Commission for Ethics in Research (Brazil; permit
CAAE 16375413.1.0000.5240). We obtained written informed
consent from adults/parents and written assent from children.
RESULTS
Psychiatric Burden in Children Exposed
to Prenatal IPV
For an overview of all analysis, see Supplementary Figure S1. In
the São Gonç
alo samples, 19% of all mothers reported IPV during
their pregnancy (n = 244; both maternal and grand-maternal
generations included). As expected, IPV during pregnancy in
the maternal generation (n = 122) was positively correlated with
exposure to lifetime trauma, and community/domestic violence
(CDV) other than IPV, as well as depression, PTSD and anxiety
symptoms (Table 1). Children exposed to lifetime trauma, and
CDV also showed the expected psychiatric problems, which
validated the collection methods. Against previous findings in
humans, however, children exposed to prenatal IPV did not
present mental and behavioral problems (Table 1). Only a weak
relationship with emotional symptoms (e.g., expressing more
fears and worries) was present.
As described by Hegarty et al. (2005), an IPV score of
more than 3 in CAS reliably detects IPV exposure. We used
this threshold to generate groups that had or had not been
exposed to IPV. Only 22% of the mothers that experienced
pregnancy IPV had been exposed to prenatal IPV themselves,
confirming the low correlation between pregnancy and prenatal
exposures reported in Table 1. Pregnancy IPV in the São
Gonç
alo mothers often coincided with IPV before and/or after
pregnancy (Figure 1A). Several children, however, had mothers
that experienced IPV exclusively after birth. These children had
similar load of maternal IPV after birth, and their mothers
experienced similar lifetime IPV exposure, as children that
experienced maternal IPV prenatally (Figure 1B). Nevertheless,
only children experiencing maternal IPV exclusively after birth
expressed elevated levels of mental symptoms compared to
controls (Figure 1C). This implies that prenatal IPV in the São
Gonç
alo children may have led to some sort of resilience against
experiencing/witnessing maternal IPV.

BeadChips
(children

women = 122; mother/children family pairs = 115). To
validate the arrays, we technically replicated 10 CpGs covered by
the BeadChip in 33 randomly chosen individuals (children = 18;
women = 15) using targeted bisulfite resequencing, which
showed strong inter-assay/subject reliability (subject mean
r2 = 0.94; max = 0.96; min = 0.90; each subject had p < 0.001;
Supplementary Table S2). Furthermore, we applied established
practices to exclude CpGs with common polymorphisms and
without reliable detection signals in all samples (see section
“
Materials and Methods”
). Since the children samples contained
both males and females, we also excluded the sex chromosomes,
resulting in a final dataset of 272,636 CpGs.
After correcting for multiple testing using the Benjamini–
Hochberg procedure, 31 CpGs (Table 2 and Figure 2A) were
differentially methylated between children exposed to prenatal
IPV (IPV+, n = 21, mean age = 13.4 ± 0.5) and controls
(IPV−, n = 99, mean age = 13.7 ± 0.3 SEM) using the Hegarty
threshold described above (Hegarty et al., 2005) and a false
discovery adjusted p-value < 0.1. To increase specificity toward
IPV, the analysis was corrected for the covariates sex and age,
as well as maternal exposures to pregnancy trauma and other
types of CDV. Supplementary Table S1 shows a comparison
between this model and an extended model including several
more possible confounds like cell-type heterogeneity, genetic
structure, family income and maternal smoking/alcohol use
during pregnancy, which showed limited effects on the results.

Figure S2), reported age/epigenetic age (Supplementary Figure
S3), and other possible confounds (Table 1) confirmed that these
variables had limited effects on the results. We also applied
a statistical strategy called robust statistics, to limit loss-of-
methylation site polymorphism bias between the prenatal IPV+
and IPV− groups (for more information, see Supplementary
Figure S4). To partly control for distant polymorphisms affecting
DNA methylation, we searched the mQTLdb/PLINK database
(see footnote 2) for previously identified methylation QTLs
affecting these 31 CpGs. Only one of the 31 CpGs, cg04967982,
had previously been associated with trans-acting polymorphism

type of genomic interaction.
Ranked 1 of 272,636 CpGs analyzed was a CpG in the gene
body of FKBP5 (Table 2 and Supplementary Figure S4), which
codes for FKBP51, the chaperone protein for GR which was
presented in the text above. Also, a CpG in the promoter of the
gene coding for GR, NR3C1, was top ranked (rank 39; Table 2).
In both genes, the significant CpGs were in regions previously
characterized by histone H3K27 acetylation and H3K4 mono/tri-
methylation, which are histone marks commonly associated with
active transcription (Supplementary Figure S5). While DNA
methylation at the NR3C1 CpG supported an active promoter, by
being poorly methylated, FKBP5 showed higher levels of DNA
methylation, suggesting local silencing (Table 2). The FKBP5
CpG, however, showed substantial variation, and has a plausible
binding site for the activator protein 1 (AP1) complex: a potent
activator of gene transcription following dimerization of c-Fos
and c-Jun (Supplementary Figure S5). A qualitative guess is
therefore that the FKBP5 site is located within an enhancer
region, but more evidence is needed.
Many other differentially methylated CpGs were located
in or close to genes previously associated with stress and
psychiatric disorders, such as the genes for oxytocin (OXT)
and DLG Associated Protein 2 (DLGAP2) that have commonly
been associated with deficits in social behavior and autism
spectrum disorder (Marshall et al., 2008; Feldman et al., 2016).
Furthermore, a subunit for GABA receptor 1B (GABBR1), DTW
Domain Containing 2 (DTWD2), and DISC1-Binding Zinc-
Finger Protein (ZNF365), have been associated with multiple
often comorbid disorders, including addiction, bipolar disorder,
and schizophrenia (Ayyappan et al., 2009; Fatemi et al., 2011;
Pan et al., 2013; Augier et al., 2018). Of interest for our
study, polymorphism in DTWD2 has shown to interact with

Prenatal Stress Epigenetically Shapes Resilience
FIGURE 1 | Missing psychiatric problems in São Gonçalo children following prenatal IPV. Most mothers experiencing pregnancy IPV were also exposed to IPV before
conception or after giving birth (A). A substantial number of mothers experienced IPV only after birth. Despite similar maternal IPV exposures after birth in both
prenatally and only postnatally exposed children, and even higher lifetime trauma exposures in mothers experiencing IPV during pregnancy (B), only children living in
families with mothers exposed to IPV only postnatally expressed more depression and PTSD symptoms (C). Results in (B,C) originates from Bonferroni corrected
post hoc tests, using general linear models with age, sex, pregnancy/prenatal trauma and CDV scores as covariates. Error bars indicates ±SEM. ∗∗∗p < 0.001,

associated with DNA methylation changes in newborns following
maternal anxiety during pregnancy (Vangeel et al., 2017).
Furthermore, the high number of psychiatrically relevant genes
may indicate co-regulation involving, for example, common
transcription factors. This was consistent with high inter-
subject correlations across many of the differentially methylated
sites (Figure 2B).
Since the maternal generation was also assessed for genome-
wide DNA methylation, we cross-examined the children results
in their mothers. No correlations within families (n = 115
mother/child pairs) were found for the 31 significant CpGs
identified in the children, providing evidence against either
genetic or intergenerational epigenetic inheritance. Changes
in the children following prenatal IPV were therefore likely
independent of the changes following the same exposures
in their mothers.
Stress Tolerance and Methylome
Switching in São Gonçalo Children
Similar changes in FKBP5 and NR3C1 DNA methylation reported
by others (Binder et al., 2008; McGowan et al., 2009; Spijker
and van Rossum, 2012; Klengel et al., 2013; Zannas and Binder,
2014) suggest that prenatal IPV exposed São Gonç
alo children
would have higher availability of GR, resulting in enhanced
negative feedback of the HPA-axis, and therefore faster stress
recovery than controls. While this may explain why these
children seemed protected from the psychiatric consequences
of prenatal IPV, only studying brain receptor function may
fully addressed this hypothesis. Considering the challenges
to study the São Gonç
alo population this was out of our
scope. Furthermore, while DNA methylation in NR3C1 and
FKBP5 have been suggested to be indicators of mental burden,
inconsistencies between studies have questioned their biomarker
potential (Palma-Gudiel et al., 2015; Argentieri et al., 2017).
Therefore, we sought to explore epigenetic indicators of stress
tolerance that are not dependent on single CpGs, but instead
averages information across genomes. Analyzing our data this
way, would make our observation more robust against technical
noise and decrease the risk of making false discoveries due to
multiple testing.
Exposures to stress, aging and disease have been shown
to associate with genome-wide losses of DNA methylation in
heterochromatin-like genomic regions rich in DNA methylation
(Jones et al., 2015; Nätt et al., 2015; Nätt and Thorsell, 2016).
More DNA methylation in heterochromatin-like regions would
therefore indicate stress/disease resilience and deaccelerated
aging. Based on this, we simply categorized all analyzed CpGs
into hyper (>50%) or hypo- (<50%) methylated (Figure 2C).
The seemingly arbitrary 50% cut-off overlapped to >98.7%
with two clusters, independently replicated in the São Gonç
alo
children and women, and unbiasedly generated using K-means
clustering analysis (K = 2). Clusters were also inversely
associated with the heterochromatin marker H3K9me3, and
euchromatin marker H3K4me3, as previously measured in
mono nuclear leucocytes (Figure 2D). Inversed chromatin
states of these clusters were also confirmed in relevant cell
types using ChromHMM data downloaded from the Roadmap
Epigenomics Project, which reports chromatin states based
on machine learning of five different chromatin markers
(Supplementary Figure S6).
Exploring the hetero- and eu-chromatin-like clusters revealed
a never described phenomena following prenatal stress in
humans. In heterochromatin-like regions, the number of
hypermethylated CpGs in prenatal IPV exposed children
compared to controls progressively increased the closer to the top
most differentially methylated CpGs that was targeted (top graph
Figure 2E). The gain in DNA methylation of heterochromatin-
like regions was accompanied by a rebound in euchromatin-
like regions (bottom graph Figure 2E). This resulted in what
appeared to be a methylome switch, where prenatal IPV
exposure led to more methylation in heterochromatin-like and
less methylation in euchromatin-like regions of the top regions
affected by prenatal IPV. The switch affected many types of
genomic regions but was most pronounced in several classes of
transposons and other repetitive genomic elements (Figure 2E).

regions appeared slightly protected against the switch, at least in
euchromatin-like regions.
Given the explorative findings in Figure 2E, we looked
more closely at the 1% top differentially methylated CpGs
between IPV+ and IPV− children (Supplementary Data S1).
The proportion of hypermethylated regions in IPV+ children
was far greater than what was expected by confidence intervals
generated using 10,000 bootstrap resamples of the original
272,636 analyzed CpGs post filtering (top graph Figure 2F).
While not as pronounced, the opposite relationship was observed
in the eu-chromatin like regions (bottom graph Figure 2F).
This confirms statistically the overrepresentation observed in

CpGs in heterochromatin-like regions of the top most differentially methylated CpGs between prenatal IPV+ and IPV– children (top graph). This was accompanied by
a reduction of hypermethylated CpGs in euchromatin-like regions (lower graph). CpGs were categorized by being within ±50 bp of repetitive genomic features (SINE,
LINE, LTR, DNA transposon, other repeats) or gene associated features (exons and/or CpG islands; no repeat within ±50 bp). (F) Comparing the observed number
of hypermethylated CpGs in the top 1% differentially methylated CpGs with confi
dence intervals of the expected distributions generated by resampling 1% randomly
from all analyzed CpGs (10,000 resamples), confi

hypermethylated CpGs in euchromatin-like regions, compared to controls. (G) Averaging the top 1% CpGs into either heterochromatin-like CpGs with or without

heterochromatin-like regions may partly involve a mechanism
that reactivates intact retrotransposons (Wood and Helfand,
2013; Gorbunova et al., 2014; Nätt and Thorsell, 2016). These
virus-like elements are often found in repetitive genomic
regions and are normally silenced by DNA methylation. It
is believed that when this epigenetic control mechanism is
compromised, these elements may reactivate, spread to other
genomic locations, leading to disruption of genome integrity,
and increased nuclear instability (Nätt and Thorsell, 2016).
Since the strongest effect by prenatal IPV was found within
repetitive heterochromatin-like regions (Figures 2E–G), we
therefore limited our analysis to only involve known recently
active L1 retrotransposons specific to the human linage. As
expected, prenatal IPV exposed São Gonç
alo children showed
more DNA methylation in these regions, suggesting that these
children may have stronger protection against nuclear instability
caused by reactivation of retrotransposons compared to the
controls (Figure 2H).
Children Exposed to Both Prenatal IPV
and Postnatal Violence Share a
Unique Relationship
To put the findings in the São Gonç
alo children into a wider
context, we compared the results with three other datasets
relevant for prenatal IPV and psychiatric burden.
Firstly, we tried to validate the main analysis in saliva
samples from an independent juvenile cohort of war immigrants
with primarily Middle Eastern origin (IPV+ = 15, mean
age = 14.7 ± 0.6; IPV− = 33, mean age = 15.4 ± 0.4 SEM).
This cohort had also experienced high levels of violence both
in the maternal and juvenile generations (Figure 3A). While
the refugee children did not present as pronounced resilience
in their psychiatric profiles following prenatal IPV as their
São Gonç
alo counterparts (Figure 3B), the data still showed
a similar methylome switch with the strongest effect observed
in repetitive heterochromatin-like regions, thus replicating the
Brazilian results despite the limited sample size (Figure 3C).
Secondly, we used the material collected for the São Gonç
alo
maternal generation, and investigated prenatal IPV in adult
São Gonç
alo women, where the grand-maternal generation
was exposed to IPV during pregnancy (IPV+ = 23, mean
age = 37.5 ± 1.3; IPV− = 99, mean age = 38.3 ± 0.6 SEM).
Surprisingly, women in this population showed the opposite
methylome switch (Figure 4A) compared to the São Gonç
alo
children (Figure 4B) following prenatal IPV. These inversed
relationships were, however, only present when the analysis was
done on the 1% top differentially methylated CpGs identified
within each cohort. Thus, São Gonç
alo children did not express a
methylome switch on the CpGs affected by prenatal stress in adult
women, and vice versa. This result indicates that prenatal IPV
may have unique epigenome-wide consequences across lifespan.
Thirdly, to explore how a methylome switch may appear
in subjects with confirmed psychiatric burden we acquired a
freely available subset of the Grady dataset (Zannas et al., 2015).
This dataset contains 367 individuals, primarily of African-
American origin, with white blood cell DNA methylation profiles
and information on whether the participants have undergone
treatment for psychiatric disorders or not (for more information,
see Supplementary Figure S7). We motivated a comparison
between blood and saliva with a high density of white blood cells
previously observed in saliva (Theda et al., 2018), something that
was confirmed in our samples (Supplementary Figure S2). We
hypothesized that if a methylome switch truly is a suggestive
biomarker for stress exposure and psychiatric vulnerability,
patients with a documented history of psychiatric disorders
(nyes = 140, nno = 227) should show the opposite relationship
compared to the São Gonç
alo children. As hypothesized,
psychiatric burden in the Grady cohort showed a similar
methylome switch as the São Gonç
alo women (Supplementary
Figure S7), which was the inverted relationship compared to
the São Gonç
alo children (Figures 2G, 4B), and the refugee
replication cohort (Figure 3C). For regenerating the complete
Grady/São Gonç
alo comparison, we provide an automated R
script in Supplementary Text S1.
Importantly, as indicated by the women/children comparison
in Figure 4, the methylome switch observed across the
different
cohorts
were
induced
at
independent
genomic
sites, where each cohort generated highly unique top 1%
subsets with very few overlaps across cohorts (Supplementary
Figure S8). In fact, none of the differentially methylated
CpGs following prenatal IPV in the São Gonç
alo children
(Table 1) where among the top 1% differentially methylated
CpGs in the other cohorts. This confirms what others have
indicated, that single CpGs are relatively poor biomarkers
for stress and psychiatric burden (Palma-Gudiel et al., 2015;
Argentieri et al., 2017).
DISCUSSION
We provide both psychiatric and molecular evidence that
prenatal stress in humans may have different consequences
on mental health depending on the postnatal environment.
Children living in the high violence communities of São
Gonç
alo seemed more resilient to the epigenome-wide and
psychiatric consequences of prenatal IPV reported repeatedly
by others (Lupien et al., 2009; Fine et al., 2014; Babenko
et al., 2015). We found similar effects in an independent
sample of children exposed to war violence. Furthermore,
consistent with prenatal IPV exposed São Gonç
alo children
showing
more
resilience,
these
children
presented
the
opposite relationships in their epigenetic profiles compared
to United States patients with documented history of psychiatric
disorders. Together these effects involved hundreds of subjects
and thousands of methylation sites, where a clear impact

Prenatal Stress Epigenetically Shapes Resilience
FIGURE 3 | A methylome switch in prenatally stressed war-exposed refugees. Graphs show results from an independent study in refugees primarily born in
countries of the Middle East which migrated to Germany between 2010 and 2016. (A) Refugee mothers and children had higher life-time exposure to violence than
reference groups born in Germany. Community violence scores used for the São Gonçalo samples was not available here. Instead graphs indicate organized
violence scored using the Event Checklist for War, Detention, and Torture Experiences, as described in Onyut et al. (2009). (B) Using the same methods for scoring
symptoms of PTSD and depression as were used for the São Gonçalo samples, refugee children that experienced prenatal IPV (IPV+) did not show more symptoms
of PTSD and depression compared to controls (IPV–). (C) Just like the São Gonçalo children, refugee children that experienced prenatal IPV had more DNA
methylation in heterochromatin-like repetitive regions than controls, accompanied with what appeared to be a rebound in euchromatin-like repetitive regions.
Analysis was done on CpGs in common post fi
lter between refugees and São Gonçalo cohorts (n = 239,442). General linear models were used with age, sex and
prenatal exposure to trauma and organized violence as covariates. ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗p < 0.05.
was found in two well established stress response genes,
FKBP5 and NR3C1.
The FKBP5 and NR3C1 findings are consistent with a
reprogramming of the HPA-axis, resulting in an enhanced
negative feedback and a faster stress recovery in prenatal IPV
exposed São Gonç
alo children (Zannas and Binder, 2014).
This interpretation should be made with caution, firstly since
HPA axis feedback is primarily mediated at the levels of the
pituitary, hypothalamus and hippocampus, and secondly since
these candidate CpGs are poorly characterized in terms of
mechanism. Support for this interpretation is, however, found
in our study of peripheral cells populations. Specifically, São
Gonç
alo children whose mothers were exposed to IPV during
pregnancy had more DNA methylation in retrotransposons
and heterochromatin-like regions, profiles that previously have
been associated with slower aging and lower risk of disease
(Wood and Helfand, 2013; Gorbunova et al., 2014; Jones
et al., 2015; Nätt and Thorsell, 2016). Chronic cortisol
exposures in children (Nätt et al., 2015) and endogenous
hypercortisolism (Glad et al., 2017), also associates with similar
changes in DNA methylation, which links our findings more
directly with stress physiology. It must be noticed, however,
that while most studies have reported a relatively linear
relationship between stress exposure and age acceleration,
one recent finding shows that war-veterans with PTSD can
show epigenetic age-deceleration (Verhoeven et al., 2018). Thus,
under some circumstances, what appears to be resilience
on a molecular level may be associated with a psychiatric
disorder on the macro level, which may indicate a non-linear
relationship.
If
interactions
between
the
prenatal
and
postnatal
environments are important for shaping mental resilience,
this may explain the absence of stress-related mental illness
in other prenatal stress studies targeting juvenile populations
exposed to violence (Roth et al., 2014) or other types of postnatal
stress (Sandman et al., 2012). It must, however, be emphasized
that although we believe we have one of the first and largest
epigenome-wide studies targeting cohorts with consistently high
exposures to prenatal IPV, defined as a Hegarty IPV score >3
(Hegarty et al., 2005), each individual cohort represented only
a limited amount of prenatal IPV exposed cases. As such, our
study should be considered a pilot study for a much larger study
involving thousands of subjects, differing on their exposures to
prenatal and postnatal violence. Given the available evidence
and without acknowledging possible molecular mechanism, we
propose three models that should be further investigated in such
future research.
Programmed epigenetic resilience suggests that the effects of
prenatal IPV always turn from being advantageous in childhood
to becoming disadvantageous in adulthood. This would explain

Prenatal Stress Epigenetically Shapes Resilience
FIGURE 4 | Comparison of the methylome switches in São Gonçalo children and women. Graphs show the methylome switch analyses of the top 1% differentially
methylated CpGs affected by prenatal IPV in (A) saliva of São Gonçalo children, where the maternal generation was exposed to pregnancy IPV, and (B) in saliva of
São Gonçalo women, where the grand-maternal generation was exposed to pregnancy IPV. Analyses were done using CpGs in common across all datasets
(n = 235,960). General linear models were used with age, sex and prenatal exposure to trauma and community violence as covariates. ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗p < 0.01.
the inversed relationships seen between São Gonç
alo women and
São Gonç
alo children living in the same environments, but will
have a hard time explaining the differences with previous research
(Lupien et al., 2009; Fine et al., 2014; Babenko et al., 2015).
Temporal environmental resilience suggests that the São
Gonç
alo communities have changed dramatically during the
last decades, thus the environmental factors that shape present
day youth were not present when the adult women were
in the same age.
The third model we call, Dynamic environmental resilience.
Here, the present-day São Gonç
alo communities must be viewed
as a composite of juvenile and adult subcultures, which clearly
separates the generations and provide opposite environmental
feedbacks to the epigenome. According to previous research
(Fine et al., 2014; Babenko et al., 2015), prenatal stress
associates with more emotionally impulsive behavior and less
response to social cues (including suffering of others), which
likely are advantageous traits in juvenile subcultures influenced
by gang mentality. Our results indicate that prenatal stress
may epigenetically affect emotional behavior (Table 1) and
genes controlling social behavior, such as the oxytocin gene
(Table 2). Social and emotional problems may, however, be
disadvantageous in more societally accepted adult and juvenile
subcultures (e.g., work environments), characterized by needs
for adhering to social norms, following through with tasks
and reacting emotionally to the plight of others. Thus, in
this model prenatal stress originally induces the same early
life phenotypes across populations (e.g., deficits in social and
emotional behavior), which later may be shaped into problems
by feedbacks from the postnatal environment (e.g., bullying and
social exclusion). While we think this model holds promises for
a novel syntheses in molecular psychology, it is in desperate need
of further support.
We
did
not
observe
any
difference
in
exposures
to
maternal behavior between prenatal IPV exposed children
and controls (Table 1). While our genetic structure analysis
(EPISTRUCTURE) partly controls for genetic paternal effects,
the effect of the father is a possible confound that also needs to be
better addressed in future studies. That the paternal contribution
would explain the suggestive effects on psychiatric resilience
in the São Gonç
alo children is, however, a controversial idea
that conflicts with the consensus within child/adolescence
psychiatry. This would imply that the fathers, which often are the
perpetrators in IPV, may have (epi)genetic benefits in relation to
fathers of controls.
We are aware that our results may be viewed as evidence
for the Predictive Adaptive Hypothesis (PAR) (Bateson et al.,
2014), suggesting that the prenatal environment, experienced
by the mother, prepares/adapts the fetus for postnatal life.
While we acknowledge this possibility, we recommend caution
here. Firstly, our data were collected in humans and therefore
are correlational in nature. Secondly, we have no evidence
that our observations are adaptive over a life cycle. Thirdly,
due to the complexity of human social behavior, subcultures

that promote behavioral phenotypes generated by suboptimal
brain development (maladaptive traits) are likely to occur.
As outlined by the Dynamic environmental resilience model,
the violent juvenile subcultures that we studied here may
represent such a niche.
CpGs previously associated with stress and psychiatric
disorders, including CpGs in NR3C1 and FKBP5, replicates
poorly across studies (Palma-Gudiel et al., 2015; Argentieri
et al., 2017) and have so far failed to translate into reliable
clinical tests. Our result confirms this. We have here presented
a novel marker that appears to associate with mental burden,
namely the stress-induced methylome switch. Fully developed
this marker may provide a more robust alternative to candidate
CpGs. Like the epigenetic clock (Horvath, 2013), the methylome
switch relies on broad epigenome signatures, making it less
affected by populational structure and measurement artifacts,
such as fluctuations in cell-type heterogeneity. Used properly
this marker allow for epigenome studies in relation to more
stochastic models of stress and aging, such as the allostatic
load (McEwen and Stellar, 1993) and epigenetic drift (Jones
et al., 2015) concepts. In such models, it is expected that broad
genomic mechanisms, such as a loss of genome integrity, can
disassociate the impact of stress at single CpGs (Nätt and
Thorsell, 2016). While our methylome switch marker is robust
for this kind of stochasticity, it instead suffers from a small
effect size. A successful biomarker, however, should primarily
rely on the power to detect a true difference. Whether it shows
a 0.5% or 50% effect size does not matter given that precision
is high. The precision of the methylome switch is high since
it summarizes hundreds of measurements at individual CpGs.
Future studies must therefore aim to evaluate and refine our
suggestive biomarker, rather than dismiss it for being biologically
irrelevant due to a low effect size.
CONCLUSION
We
provide
human
evidence
that
children
exposed
to
prenatal stress may experience resilience driven by epigenome-
wide interactions. This plausibly translates animal findings
and
suggests
that
prenatal
psychiatric
risk
factors
may
have different, and maybe even opposite, consequences in
different
world
populations.
Our
findings
therefore
call
for
more
research
on
personalizing
psychiatric
practices
according
to
social
and
community
backgrounds.
By
studying
the
gene–
environment
interactions
in
some
of
these world populations, we have also discovered a novel
phenomenon that may be refined into a biomarker for
mental
burden,
namely
the
stress-induced
methylome
switch.
We
hope
that
this
discovery
may
lead
to
innovative molecular diagnostic tools in psychiatry, with
profound impact on our understanding and treatment of
mental disorders.
