IMPORTANCE The appropriately coached implementation of surgical safety checklists (SSCs)
reduces the incidence of perioperative complications and 30-day mortality of patients
undergoing surgery. The association of the introduction of SSCs with 90-day mortality
remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE To assess the association between the implementation of SSCs and all-cause
90- and 30-day mortality rates.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Evaluation of the outcomes of surgical procedures
performed during the 6 months before (January 1 to June 30, 2010) and after (January 1 to
June 30, 2013) the introduction of SSCs by retrospective analysis of administrative databases.
The study was conducted in a public, regional, university-affiliated hospital in Italy. Data were
collected from October 23, 2013, to November 12, 2014, including 90-day all-cause mortality,
30-day all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, and 30-day readmission rate among
patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Patients undergoing surgery during the 6-month
periods before and after the implementation of SSCs were compared. Data were analyzed
from September 17, 2014, to July 31, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Risk-adjusted rates of 90- and 30-day mortality,
readmission rate, and length of stay.
RESULTS The total study sample of 10 741 patients included 5444 preintervention and 5297
postintervention patients (5093 [47.4%] male and 5648 [52.6%] female patients; mean [SD]
age, 53.0 [23.0] years). Ninety-day all-cause mortality was 2.4% (129 patients) before
compared with 2.2% (118 patients) after the SSC implementation, for an adjusted odds ratio
(AOR) of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.56-0.96; P = .02). Thirty-day all-cause mortality was 1.36% (74
patients) before compared with 1.32% (70 patients) after the SSC implementation, for an
AOR of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.56-1.11; P = .17). Thirty-day readmission occurred in 797 patients
(14.6%) in the preimplementation group vs 766 patients (14.5%) in the postimplementation
group, for an AOR of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.81-1.01; P = .79). The adjusted length of stay was 10.4
(95% CI, 10.3-10.6) days in the preimplementation group compared with 9.6 (95% CI,
9.4-9.7) days in the postimplementation group (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The data cannot prove causality owing to the study design.
The implementation of SSCs was associated with a 27% reduction of the adjusted risk for
all-cause death within 90 days but not within 30 days. The adjusted length of stay was
reduced after implementation of SSCs.

A
t present, inpatients worldwide may expect a 30-day-
mortality of 1.5% after noncardiac surgery,1 depend-
ing on the region where surgery is performed,2 the sur-
gical procedure,3 and the patients’comorbidities. Data from
theUnitedStatesrevealedahighvariabilityofthehospitalmor-
tality for inpatients after oncologic and high-risk surgery,4,5
whereastheincidenceofoverallcomplicationswaslessskewed
andremainedconstantamongUSMedicarepatientsfrom2005
to 2011.6 Consequently, effective risk management for pa-
tients undergoing surgery is crucial. This risk management re-
quires an interdisciplinary, process-oriented approach to over-
come barriers between single disciplines. Checklists aim to
reduce risk and prevent patient harm by recognizing high-
risk situations and optimizing communication, by minimiz-
ing the incidence of errors, and by improving latent condi-
tions.ThefirstexperienceofachecklistelaboratedbytheWorld
Health Organization (WHO)1 and a more comprehensive peri-
operative checklist (the Surgical Patient Safety System
[SURPASS])7 reported significant reduction in mortality and
morbidity, contrary to a retrospective study on the implemen-
tation of WHO checklists within Ontario.8 These studies ana-
lyzed in-hospital mortality or 30-day mortality but not inter-
mediate-term outcome variables. Almost one-quarter (23.6%)
of the deaths within 30 days after surgery occurred after dis-
charge, and 39.7% of patients undergoing surgery experi-
enced only postdischarge complications.9 Ninety-day mortal-
ity often doubles 30-day mortality.10,11 In-hospital mortality
and 30-day mortality might therefore underreport the real risk
to these patients, especially after tumor surgery or among the
elderly.12 Studies of the effect or the association of the imple-
mentation of surgical safety checklists (SSCs) on 90-day mor-
tality are lacking.
As our primary aim, we assessed the association of the in-
troduction of the adapted WHO SSC and 30-day or 90-day all-
causemortalityamongpatientsundergoingsurgeryattheCen-
tral Hospital of Bolzano (CHB) in Italy. We defined the
association of the implementation of SSCs and the hospital
length of stay (LOS) and 30-day readmission rate as second-
ary study aims.
Methods
We designed a retrospective comparative effectiveness analy-
sis of administrative databases to investigate the association
of the implementation of SSCs and outcome data. Study de-
sign and reporting were performed according to the Strength-
ening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiol-
ogy(STROBE)statement.13Thestudywasapprovedbythelocal
institutional review board of the public health care system in
South Tyrol, Italy. The data in the deidentified analysis were
exempt from informed consent.
Setting
The study took place at the CHB, a 715-bed inpatient facility
that serves as a referral hospital for the public health care sys-
tem within the Autonomous Province of South Tyrol, and, in
case of major complications, for private hospitals in South Ty-
rol. The Italian government highly recommended the imple-
mentation of the WHO checklist in a ministerial decree re-
leased in 2009.14 Each Italian hospital must implement an SSC
containing the 3 steps proposed by the WHO and a final dis-
cussion of the management of the prophylaxis for thrombo-
embolism.
Intervention
Until April 2010, a modified version of the checklist was de-
signed for the surgical departments of the CHB (general, pe-
diatric, vascular, thoracic, gynecologic and obstetric, neuro-
surgery, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, traumatology and
orthopedic, and urology) by an interdisciplinary committee.
In particular, we anticipated the items antibiotics and preop-
erative imaging in the first section of the SSC before the induc-
tion of anesthesia. In September 2010, we introduced a com-
prehensive SSC containing 24 items for standard surgical
procedures and a modified checklist containing 17 items for
short-term or same-day surgical procedures in the single sur-
gical departments using a step-by-step regime. Cesarean sec-
tions were accompanied by a dedicated 22-item SSC that in-
volved the obstetric, anesthesia, and neonatology teams (the
3 SSCs are described in the eFigure in the Supplement). As pro-
posed by the WHO, all the SSCs follow the 3 sign-in, time-out,
and sign-out phases and are completed in the operating room
by physicians and nurses caring for the patient. The imple-
mentation of the SSCs was accompanied by guided supervi-
sion and assistance. During the introduction period, we ana-
lyzed the performance of execution of the checklists by
evaluating compilation of the items and clinical process flow.
Each SSC contained a table on the back (eFigure in the Supple-
ment) where the staff in the operating room reported on per-
formance errors. We judged the SSC to be performed cor-
rectly when the following criteria were fulfilled: each item was
correctly filled out, no performance errors were noted on the
back sheet, and the analysis of the SSC provided clinical evi-
dence of its correct performance. The performance of the SSC
in each operating room was presented officially to all the per-
sonnel working in the operating room in monthly intervals. We
required an 80% rate of correctly executed SSCs for the offi-
cial declaration of successful implementation in the single dis-
ciplines (achieved in October 2012).
Study Design
We performed a retrospective analysis of administrative out-
come data before and after the implementation of the SSCs. A
3-month period before the implementation and another after
the successful introduction of the SSC constituted consolida-
tion periods. We chose a 6-month period for data collection
to enroll a minimum sample size of 9750 patients (1.5%-0.8%
reduction of 30-day mortality as reported by Haynes et al1;
α = .05; 1 − β = 0.90). Consequently, we evaluated the out-
come of surgical procedures performed from January 1 to June
30, 2010, as the preintervention period and the outcome data
of surgical procedures performed from January 1 to June 30,
2013, as the postintervention period. We randomly selected
500 general SSCs and 10 SSCs for cesarean section performed
during the postintroduction period for quality control. These

SSCs were chosen by one of us (I. S.-C.) blinded to the date and
type of surgery.
We extracted data from the official database of the local
government and classified the surgical procedures accord-
ing to the 2007 file of the International Classification of Dis-
eases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM).15
Patients undergoing elective and emergency surgical proce-
dures with ICD-9-CM codes 01 to 34 and 40 to 86 at the CHB
were eligible. Cardiac (ICD-9-CM codes 35-37) and diagnos-
tic (ICD-9-CM codes 87-99) procedures constituted exclu-
sion criteria. We further eliminated procedures performed
outside the operating room (ie, in the radiology and gastro-
enterology departments) because the SSC was not used in
these departments during the study period. The procedures
were coded as proposed by the National Healthcare Safety
Network16 and grouped into various categories of surgical
procedures (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Data were col-
lected from October 23, 2013, to November 12, 2014.
We assessed 30- and 90-day all-cause mortality rates by
matching the date of the surgical intervention with the local
registerofmortality.Weperformed2differentanalysesofmor-
tality that considered the first or the last surgical procedure
as reference in the case of multiple procedures. For the evalu-
ation of secondary study aims, we analyzed the first opera-
tion in the case of multiple procedures.
We defined LOS as the days from the date of admission to
the date of discharge. The readmission rate was judged by cal-
culating the admissions for short-term treatment in a public
health care facility of each included patient within 30 days af-
ter the original discharge from a public health care facility. For
this analysis, we excluded transfers within a facility and ad-
missions for rehabilitation, psychiatric therapy, radiotherapy
or chemotherapy, dialysis, or pregnancy and/or labor.
Covariates
We defined a priori elective (planned admission) and emer-
gent (urgent admission) surgery, patient age class, and pa-
tient sex as covariates. We classified the surgical procedures
for their risks and confounding factors similarly to classifica-
tion in previous research.8 We further considered the clinical
risk factors oncologic and cardiovascular comorbidity and dia-
betes mellitus, whose criteria had to be fulfilled by data ob-
tained from official South Tyrolean registries and databases.
Statistics
Data were analyzed from September 17, 2014, to July 31, 2015.
Statistical evaluations were performed with SAS software (En-
terprise Guide 4.3; SAS Institute, Inc). We used multiple logis-
tic regressions and generalized linear models for the analysis
of the impact of the introduction of the SSC. Poisson general-
ized estimating equation models served to estimate LOS; lo-
gistic regression was used for mortality and readmission analy-
sis. The final effect of the introduction of the SSC in the
subgroups of age, sex, type of admission, type of procedure,
and comorbidity was calculated using a planned contrasts
analysis.
For estimation of the propensity score, we used a logistic
regression model with preintervention and postintervention
as the outcome variables and the baseline characteristics (ad-
mission category, procedure type, age, sex, and comorbidity)
as explanatory variables. We weighted the entire study sample
by inverse probability of treatment derived from the propen-
sity score (eTable 2 in the Supplement). We estimated the re-
duction in the probability of mortality and LOS using the
method described by Lunceford and Davidian.17
Patient characteristics and the details of admission were
depicted using descriptive statistics (frequencies and percent-
ages, means [SDs], and 95% CIs) as appropriate. We used the
2-tailed t test, simple logistic regression, or analysis of vari-
ance to determine whether the means were significantly dif-
ferent between groups. For all analyses, significance was set
at P < .05 using 2-sided tests.
Results
The study sample included 10 741 patients (5093 [47.4%]
male and 5648 [52.6%] female patients; mean [SD] age, 53.0
[23.0] years), with 5444 before and 5297 after the interven-
tion. Patients in the postintervention group were older, were
more frequently male, and had a higher prevalence of onco-
logic and cardiac diseases (Table 1). We found no significant
difference with regard to the type of recovery (elective or
urgent) or prevalence of diabetes mellitus. The surgical pro-
cedures differed significantly between groups, mainly owing
to an increase in vascular, thoracic, and cranial procedures
(Table 1).
A total of 340 patients in the preintervention group and
348 patients in the postintervention group underwent mul-
tiple procedures. A total of 447 of the 500 SSCs (89.4%) se-
lected for quality control were filled out completely and free
of errors in process flow. Ten SSCs for cesarean section cho-
sen for quality control were correct.
Raw data revealed a 90-day all-cause mortality of 2.37%
(129 of 5444 patients) before implementation of the SSC
compared with 2.23% (118 of 5297 patients) after introduc-
tion of the SSC, respectively (P = .62). The 30-day all-cause
mortality rate was 1.36% (74 of 5444 patients) before and
1.32% (70 of 5297 patients) after implementation of the SSC
(P = .87). We found no significant differences in the 30-day
readmission rate or in LOS (Table 2) between preinterven-
tion and postintervention groups. Data after univariate
analysis are depicted in eTables 3 to 6 in the Supplement,
whereas eTables 7 to 10 in the Supplement depict the data
after multivariate analysis.
Comparison of Preintervention and Postintervention Groups
Effect of Introduction of the SSC on Mortality
The introduction of the SSC was associated with a significant
reduction of 90-day all-cause mortality (adjusted odds ratio
[AOR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56-0.96; P = .02) (Table 3 and Figure 1).
In addition, the implementation of the SSC was not associ-
ated with a reduction of 30-day all-cause mortality (AOR, 0.79;
95% CI, 0.56-1.11; P = .17) (Table 3 and Figure 2).
These data on mortality did not change when a second
procedure was considered determinant in case of repeated

surgical procedures. We found no significant difference in
risk for death after 30 days (AOR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.53-1.05;
P = .09) after the introduction of the SSC, whereas the risk
for death after 90 days was significantly lower in the post-
implementation period (AOR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53-0.90;
P < .01).
Effect of the Introduction of the SSC on 30-Day Readmission Rate
and LOS
The 30-day readmission rate (AOR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81-1.01;
P = .08)didnotchangeafterimplementationoftheSSC(eTable
11 in the Supplement). The mean adjusted LOS was signifi-
cantly lower after the intervention at 9.6 (95% CI, 9.4-9.7) days
compared with 10.4 (95% CI, 10.3-10.6) days before the inter-
vention (P < .001) (eTable 12 in the Supplement).
Discussion
We observed a 27% reduction of risk-adjusted all-cause
90-day mortality after implementation of SSCs. Adjusted all-
cause 30-day mortality remained unchanged. The introduc-
tion of SSCs was associated with a reduction in LOS but not of
30-day readmission rate.
Postoperative 90-Day All-Cause Mortality
To our knowledge, this report is the first on the association of
SSCs and 90-day all-cause mortality, which might be even
more important than 30-day all-cause mortality. Thirty-day
all-cause mortality might fail to capture intermediate-term
complications, such as anastomosis leakage or pulmonary

embolism, which occur despite prophylaxis late after
trauma18 or genitourinary and general surgery.19 Ninety-day
all-cause mortality included predominantly surgical compli-
cations after colectomy, whereas deaths related to the under-
lying oncologic disease occurred later.10 Patients 85 years or
older had an elevated 90-day but not 30-day all-cause mortal-
ity after radical cystectomy.12,20 Ninety-day all-cause mortal-
ity almost doubled 30-day all-cause mortality after
pancreatectomy,11 cancer surgery,21 lung resection,22 and
renal mass resection.23 Moreover, 30-day all-cause mortality
or in-hospital mortality might depend on discharge practice,21
an important aspect because 23.6% of the deaths within 30
days occurred after hospital discharge in the United States.9
Comparison With Other Studies
Reduction of mortality, the most important outcome, is diffi-
cult to achieve in areas with a high standard of care. In-
hospital mortality dropped from 1.5% to 0.8% (P = .003) in the
original trial on the effectiveness of the WHO SSC,1 but no sig-
nificant reduction of mortality in high-income countries was
noted (0.9% to 0.6%; P = .18). The investigators of the Key-
stone Surgery program,24 an intensively coached quality im-
provement program focusing on infectious complications,
might have failed to demonstrate a reduction of mortality be-
causetheyanalyzedonly30-dayandnot90-dayall-causemor-
tality. A stepped wedge cluster-randomized clinical trial re-
ported a reduction of the complication rate and LOS of surgical
patients in the 2 participating hospitals after the introduction
ofanSSC,butin-hospitalmortalitydecreasedinonly1facility.25
Like other investigators,24,25 we failed to observe reduced 30-
day all-cause mortality, which is mainly caused by cardiopul-
monary or renal complications. The successful implementa-
tion of interdisciplinary guidelines, especially on the
perioperative management of cardiopulmonary risks, in coun-
tries with a high standard of care might explain this aspect.
The SURPASS checklist7 addresses more aspects of peri-
operative safety and might have therefore produced a substan-
tial improvement of in-hospital mortality in the Netherlands.
Baseline characteristics differed between various trials. We in-
cluded patients with same-day surgery, whereas the SURPASS
trial analyzed only inpatients, who constituted a higher-risk
class. An analysis on SSC implementation among cases en-
rolledintheEuropeanSurgicalOutcomeStudy2reportedanas-
sociation of SSC use and a reduced risk for 60-day in-hospital
mortality26 without further specifying the checklists and their
implementation. However, that study was limited to patients
older than 16 years and excluded patients undergoing same-
day and obstetric procedures, cardiac surgery, or neurosur-
gery. Two systematic reviews27,28 published before the On-
tario study8 concluded that the introduction of SSCs was
associated with a reduced incidence of complications. Only 1
study28 reported a significant decline of in-hospital mortality,

but notably both studies27,28 excluded the SURPASS trial7 from
analysis. Like other investigators,1,7,25,29 we accompanied the
introduction of the checklist with a formal training of the staff,
followed by a reporting of clinical performance. These aspects
might explain the lack of decline in 30-day all-cause mortality
and the risk for perioperative complications after the introduc-
tion of SSCs in Ontario,8 where a guided implementation was
not obligatory. Compliance in the execution of SSCs, often re-
quiring a strategic multifactorial approach,27,30 is difficult to
achieve,29,31,32 but it is crucial for the success of the measure.33
In the trial by van Klei et al,33 adjusted 30-day all-cause mor-
tality decreased after implementation of the SSC among 25 513
adult patients scheduled for inpatient surgery (AOR, 0.85; 95%
CI, 0.73-0.98), an effect that strongly depended on SSC com-
pliance. Kwok et al34 observed a reduced complication rate af-
tertheintroductionoftheWHOSSCandpulseoximetryinaMol-
dovan hospital. The high completion rate during the study

Strengths and Limitations
Thesingle-centerdesignandthelackofacontrolgrouparelimi-
tations of our study. The study design highly reduces the risk
for observation bias (Hawthorne effect). Furthermore, we did
not inform the staff about the purpose of our study. We ana-
lyzed only objective outcome data to reduce reporting bias as
much as possible. Contrary to most other studies, ours took
into consideration the first or the last surgery as reference in
case of multiple procedures. Our database does not distin-
guish between programmed repeated surgery (diagnostic pro-
cedure preceding the curative procedure) and reoperations for
the treatment of complications.
Our database is more comprehensive than those analyz-
ing in-hospital mortality because it includes the total num-
ber of deaths within our region (ie, includes those occurring
after discharge or transfer to another hospital). We cannot
exclude dropouts in the mortality rate if patients were not
residents of South Tyrol, but this lack would have affected
both groups. Moreover, the percentage of these patients
would be considerably low owing to the local public health
care system. Staff changes appeared only in case of natural
fluctuation during the study period, and no changes in
health care policies or hospital management have occurred.
Secular trends in improvement of care might have interfered
between groups. Owing to its design, our study demon-
strates an association between the implementation of the

proof of causality.
Implications for Further Research
The observed decline in LOS suggests potential cost savings af-
tertheimplementationofSSCs.Furthertrialsshouldaddressthis
hypothesisandtheeffectonqualityofcareowingtoareduction
of the costs of complications37,38 or unplanned reoperations.38
Conclusions
The implementation of SSCs was associated with a 27% reduc-
tion of the adjusted risk for all-cause mortality within 90 days.
The risk for all-cause mortality within 30 days remained un-
changed. Adjusted LOS was reduced after implementation of
SSCs.
