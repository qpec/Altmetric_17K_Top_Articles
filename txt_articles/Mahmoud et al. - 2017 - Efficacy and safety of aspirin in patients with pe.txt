Abstract
Background
Although considered a cornerstone therapy, the efficacy and safety of aspirin for prevention
of ischemic events in patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD) remains uncertain.
Thus, we aimed to evaluate aspirin use in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients
with PVD.
Methods
An electronic search of databases was conducted from inception until January 2017 for all
randomized trials comparing aspirin with either placebo or control (no aspirin) in patients
with PVD. The primary efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality, and the primary safety
outcome was major bleeding. Other outcomes of interest were major adverse cardiac and
cerebrovascular events (MACCE), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and intracranial hemor-
rhage. Random-effects summary risk ratios (RR) were calculated using Der-Simonian and
Liard model. The quality of evidence was assessed by GRADE tool and Cochrane risk of
bias assessment tool.
Results
A total of 6,560 patients from 11 trials were included. Only two trials were considered to
have low risk of bias. Compared with control, aspirin was associated with similar incidence
of all-cause mortality (RR = 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8–1.1), MACCE (RR = 1.0,
95% CI 0.83–1.20), MI (RR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.67–1.23) and stroke (RR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.43–
1.22), major bleeding (RR = 1.59, 95% CI 0.96–2.62) and intracranial hemorrhage (RR =
1.38, 95% CI 0.59–3.21).

 Conclusions
Aspirin use in PVD might not be associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes or
worse bleeding outcomes. Larger randomized trials assessing the efficacy and safety of
aspirin in the contemporary era are mandatory to confirm the current findings. Guideline rec-
ommendations regarding the use of aspirin among patients with PVD need to be updated.
Background
Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) remains a prevalent disease worldwide, and carries signifi-
cant morbidity and mortality [1]. Anti-platelet agents, particularly aspirin, have long served as
the cornerstone in therapeutic management of patients with PVD [2, 3]. The benefit of aspirin
as secondary prevention therapy in patients with atherosclerosis has been clearly demonstrated
in patients with prior ischemic stroke or acute myocardial infarction (MI) [4, 5]. However,
benefit in patients with established atherosclerosis without evidence of an ischemic event has
recently been questioned [6]. Prior meta-analyses have yielded inconsistent findings with
regard to the benefit of aspirin in PVD [7–9]. One reason for the disparate results of these
meta-analyses is the heterogeneity of patients enrolled in the studies as well as the inclusion of
studies with other antiplatelet agents, such as cilostazol or clopidogrel, as comparators. More
recently, the Aspirin for Asymptomatic Atherosclerosis (AAA) trial, one of the largest ran-
domized control trials on this topic, also failed to show a statistically significant reduction in
vascular events in asymptomatic patients with PVD, adding more to the current debate [10].
Furthermore, the Examining Use of Ticagrelor in Peripheral Artery Disease (EUCLID) trial
compared ticagrelor to clopidogrel in symptomatic PVD patients and failed to show any
reduction in cardiovascular events with ticagrelor, questioning the general concept of anti-
platelet therapy in those patients [11]. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a comprehensive meta-
analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aspirin in patients with PVD.
Methods
Data sources and study selection
As part of a project for evaluation of aspirin efficacy and safety in patients with atherosclerosis
(CDR42016041548 registered on PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic
reviews, https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.asp?ID=CRD42016041548),
an electronic search of major scientific databases including MEDLINE (S1 File), Web of Sci-
ence and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) was conducted from
inception until January 2017 without any language restrictions. The search was limited to ran-
domized clinical trials comparing aspirin mono-therapy to placebo or no aspirin control. The
following keywords were used: “aspirin”, “prevention”, “risk”, “cardiovascular”, “coronary”,
“ischemia”, “stroke”, “myocardial infarction”, “carotid”, and “peripheral”. The bibliographies
of the included studies and prior meta-analyses on the same topic were also screened for trials
not included by this search strategy. A stepwise approach was adopted for including the final
studies. First, all records were screened by the title and abstract. Studies that were potential
candidates were retrieved and evaluated by two authors to insure that it would satisfy our
inclusion criteria. Lastly, only studies with a primary interest of PVD were included. The cur-
rent meta-analysis was conducted in concurrence with Preferred Reporting Items for System-
atic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [12].

data and materials. The other authors have no
conflicts of interest to declare.
 Inclusion and exclusion criteria
A study was included in the final analysis if it satisfied the following criteria: 1) a randomized
controlled trial 2) comparison between aspirin therapy in one arm (i.e. without any other anti-
platelet agent) versus either placebo or no aspirin control (i.e. no antiplatelet agent), 3) in adult
patients (>18 years old), 4) with known history of PVD and 5) reporting cardiovascular out-
comes. Exclusion criteria were: 1) patient population different than the intended focus, such as
heart failure or exclusively coronary artery disease, 2) aspirin use in both arms and 3) anti-
platelet agent other than aspirin in either the intervention or control arm. A more detailed list-
ing of the study inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in Fig 1.
Data extraction
Two teams of independent authors extracted the data regarding the baseline studies character-
istics, baseline patients’ demographics, studies quality data and outcomes of interest. The num-
ber of clinical events in each arm was tabulated. The first author (ANM) crosschecked all
extracted data and discrepancies were resolved by consensus among authors. Outcome events
were reported at the longest follow-up duration whenever possible.
Outcomes and definitions
The outcomes of interest were categorized into two main groups; safety outcomes and efficacy
outcomes. The primary efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality. All-cause mortality was cho-
sen to represent efficacy, as it is the most robust outcome to analyze with the least degree of
heterogeneity, given its universal definition. Other secondary efficacy outcomes assessed were
MI, stroke and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). The primary
safety outcome was major bleeding. Intracranial hemorrhage was also assessed as a secondary
safety outcome.

 The definition of each outcome was reported per the individual studies (S1 and S2 Tables).
As most of the studies were older publications, prior to the release of consensus outcomes defi-
nitions (i.e., the universal definition of MI or Bleeding Academic Research Consortium
[BARC] bleeding risk score), we included events that would reflect such definitions as much as
possible. MACCE outcome was reported as the composite including: mortality (cardiovascular
or all-cause), MI, or stroke, whenever possible. Major bleeding compromised any bleeding
that resulted in significant drop of hemoglobin (Hb) >2 gm/dL, blood transfusion, hospitaliza-
tion, operation, intracranial hemorrhage or death. MI and stroke outcomes were calculated
using highest number of reported events, irrespective to fatality (fatal and non-fatal).
Quality assessment
The quality of each study included was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool [13].
This consists of seven points that test for selection, performance, detection, attrition and
reporting biases. The overall level of evidence strength of each outcome was reported accord-
ing to the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)
tool [14]. This tool reports 4 levels of quality, high, moderate, low, and very low depending on
the type of studies included (e.g. observational versus randomized clinical trial). More details
regarding both the Cochrane and GRADE tools are reported in the S2 File.
Statistical analysis
For all descriptive analysis purposes, weighted frequencies were calculated for categorical vari-
ables and weighted means with standard deviations (SD) were calculated for continuous vari-
ables using the sample size of each trial included as the weight. Summary random effects
inverse variance weighted incidences of all outcomes of interest with 95% confidence intervals
(CI) were calculated using Metaprop software [15]. This method was used for calculation of
pooled proportions in prior studies [16]. Summary random effects risk ratios (RR) were calcu-
lated for all outcomes of interest by Der-Simonian and Liard model [17]. Fixed effects odds
ratios (OR) were calculated as a secondary confirmatory analysis for both primary efficacy and
safety outcomes by Peto model [18]. The heterogeneity between studies was assessed using I2
statistic with values 0–30%, more than 30% to 60% and more than 60% corresponding to low,
moderate and high degree of heterogeneity [19]. Publication bias was evaluated by Egger’s test
with P-value of <0.05 corresponding with significant heterogeneity between studies [20].
For both the primary efficacy and safety outcomes, sensitivity analyses were conducted by
excluding the largest trial [10], for low risk of bias trials, for trials explicitly reporting patients
with no prior history of an ischemic event (i.e. stroke or MI), and for placebo-controlled trials
only. Subgroup analysis was performed according to symptoms, that is, symptomatic or
asymptomatic PVD. Random-effects meta-regression was performed for both primary out-
comes according to the dose of aspirin used, percentage of diabetes mellitus, smokers, hyper-
tension and mean age in the intervention arm. A two-sided P-value of <0.05 and CI of 95%
was considered statistically significant, and all statistical analysis was performed with use of
STATA software version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).
Results
Studies included
A total of 2,553 records were initially retrieved from the electronic database search, of which
2,478 records were excluded based on review of either the title or abstract, and 75 records were

 retrieved for full-text review. A final number of 11 trials reporting outcomes in patients with
PDV were included in the analysis [10, 21–30] (Fig 1).
Three of the eleven final trials were reported in a prior meta-analysis and were not
retrieved by our database search [28–30]. Two of the included trials employed factorial
design and thus each trial was divided into two sub-studies for analysis purposes. The Criti-
cal Leg Ischaemia Prevention Study (CLIPS) trial randomized patients to aspirin versus pla-
cebo and aspirin plus vitamin E versus vitamin E only, while the Prevention Of Progression
of Arterial Disease And Diabetes (POPADAD) trial randomized patients to aspirin versus
placebo and aspirin plus antioxidant versus antioxidant only [21, 22]. Three trials had mul-
tiple comparison arms and thus only the aspirin and placebo arms were included [23, 25,
26]. Three trials were multicenter and reported outcomes exclusively in patients without
prior history of an ischemic event (including prior stroke or MI) [10, 21, 22], and 4 trials
included low-dose aspirin (� 325mg per day) [10, 21, 22, 24]. All of the trials included
chronic stable PVD patients except one trial [25] that assessed the use of aspirin in setting of
acute lower limb ischemia. The rest of studies’ characteristics are illustrated in Table 1. The
primary outcome assessed by each trial is reported in S3 Table.

 Patients’ characteristics
A total of 6,560 patients with PVD were included in the final analysis, with 3,290 patients in
the aspirin group and 3,270 patients in the placebo or no aspirin group. The mean age of the
included patients was 62 (SD = 1.7) years old, 60% of the patients were women, 32% were dia-
betics, and 67% were smokers (current or ex-smokers). Table 2 lists reported baseline
characteristics.
Quality assessment
At the individual study level, two trials were considered to have low risk of bias assessed with
use of the Cochrane risk of bias tool [10, 21]. One trial was considered to have high risk of bias
[22], and the remaining trials had unclear risk due to lack of reporting of detailed methods (S4
Table). At the outcomes level, the level of evidence was considered low to moderate in strength
as assessed with use of the GRADE assessment tool (S5 Table).
Primary efficacy outcome
Nine trials reported the outcome of all-cause mortality [10, 21–24, 27–30]. At a weighted mean fol-
low up duration of 6.1 (SD = 2.9) years, the incidence of all-cause mortality was similar in both the
aspirin and control groups, 7.7% (95% CI 4.3–11.1%) versus 8.5% (95% CI 4.6–12.5%) (RR = 0.93,
95% CI 0.8–1.1, P = 0.33, I2 = 0%) (Fig 2). The same was true by fixed effects (OR = 0.92, 95% CI
0.78–1.09, P = 0.36). Sensitivity analyses yielded similar results after exclusion of the largest trial
(RR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.69–1.17, P = 0.44, I2 = 0%), when low risk of bias trials were evaluated indi-
vidually (RR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.81–1.10, P = 0.44, I2 = 0%), when limited to trials explicitly reporting
patients without prior history of ischemic events (RR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.81–1.11, P = 0.51, I2 = 0%),

 and when limited to placebo-controlled trials only (RR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.80–1.12, P = 0.52, I2 =
0%). The same was true for the subgroup according to symptoms (S1 Fig). Meta-regression by the
dose of aspirin used, percentage of diabetes mellitus, smokers, hypertension, and mean age in the
intervention arm did not show any evidence of effect modification by such variables with P-values
�0.05. There was no evidence of publication bias by Egger’s test (P = 0.77).
Secondary efficacy outcomes
Eight studies reported the incidence of MI [10, 21–23, 25, 28–30]. At a weighted mean follow
up of 6.2 (SD = 2.9) years the incidence of MI was similar in both the aspirin and control
groups, 3.6% (95% CI 1.63–5.5%) versus 5.5% (95% CI 3.15–7.86%), respectively; RR = 0.91,
95% CI 0.67–1.23, P = 0.54, I2 = 16%. Stroke was reported by 7 trials with a weighted mean fol-
low up duration of 6.2 (SD = 2.9) years [10, 21–23, 28–30]. The incidence of stroke was 3.2%
(95% CI 1.3–5.1%) in the aspirin group versus 4% (95% CI 2.0–6.0%) in the control group
(RR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.43–1.22, P = 0.22, I2 = 45%). MACCE was reported by 9 trials at a
weighted mean follow up duration of 6.1 (SD = 2.9) years [10, 21–24, 28–30]. The incidence of
MACCE was similar between both groups, 9.3% (95% CI 4.8–13.9%) versus 11.6% (95% CI
7.2–16.0%), respectively, (RR = 1.0, 95% CI 0.83–1.20, P = 0.96, I2 = 16%) (Fig 3). There was
no evidence of publication bias for any of the secondary efficacy outcomes (P-values of 0.51,
0.46 and 0.38 for MI, stroke and MACCE, respectively).
Primary safety outcome
The primary safety outcome of major bleeding was reported by 7 trials [22, 25, 26, 28–31]. At a
weighted mean follow up duration of 5.9 (SD = 3.3) years, there was no difference incidence of
major bleeding with aspirin (1.3% [95% CI 0.3–2.3]) compared with controls (1.1% [95% CI
0.7–1.6]), by either random effect (RR = 1.59, 95% CI 0.96–2.62, P = 0.07, I2 = 0%) (Fig 4) or

 and sensitivity analyses could not be performed, as AAA was the only high quality trial, report-
ing outcomes in asymptomatic patients and explicitly reporting outcomes in patients without
prior history of ischemic events subgroups [10]. Meta-regression analysis by the dose of aspirin
used did not show any evidence of effect modification (P = 0.50); other variables were limited
to conduct a meta-regression analysis. There was no evidence of publication bias by Egger’s
test (P = 0.54).
Secondary safety outcome
Only two trials reported the outcome of intracranial hemorrhage [10, 21]. At a weighted mean
follow up of 7.8 (SD = 0.7) years the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.7% (95% CI
0.3–1.0%) in the aspirin group versus 0.4% (95% CI 0.2–0.7%) in the control group (RR = 1.38,
95% CI 0.59–3.21, P = 0.46, I2 = 0%).
Discussion
In this meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials, we compared aspirin mono-therapy
to either placebo or control (no aspirin) in patients with PVD, and demonstrated lack of bene-
fit of aspirin in these patients. The incidences of all-cause mortality, MACCE, MI, and stroke
were similar between both groups across a wide range of aspirin dosages. At the same time,
aspirin was not associated with an increased risk of either major bleeding or intracranial
hemorrhage.
Aspirin use in PVD was recently endorsed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) /
American Heart Association (AHA) PVD guidelines in both symptomatic (Class I, level of evi-
dence A recommendation) and asymptomatic (Class IIa, level of evidence C) patients [2].
However, these recommendations were based mainly on 3 studies: a single randomized trial
[22] which had a high risk of bias by the Cochrane risk assessment tool; a meta-analysis by Ber-
ger et al [7] that showed a trend of reduction in the composite of MI, nonfatal stroke, and car-
diovascular death with aspirin that did not reach statistical significance; together with older
evidence from the Antithrombotic Trialists’ Collaboration (ATC) meta-analysis [4]. The ATC
meta-analysis, which consisted of 42 trials including 9,717 patients, established the effective-
ness of anti-platelet therapy by showing a 23% reduction in adverse cardiovascular events in
patients with PVD treated with anti-platelet agents as compared to controls. However, the
majority of the PVD trials included in the ATC meta-analysis consisted of anti-platelet agents
other than aspirin and hence the effectiveness of aspirin was brought into question [4].
Indeed, the current meta-analysis of randomized trials has some major differences com-
pared to the meta-analysis by Berger et al. [7]. Although the former analysis showed a trend
toward benefit of aspirin in reducing the composite of MI, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular
death, together with a significant reduction of non-fatal stroke, it did not include the largest
trial to evaluate the benefit of aspirin in PVD patients [10] and excluded fatal stroke from the
analysis of stroke outcome. Our analyses showed a trend toward risk reduction of stroke that
did not achieve statistical significance by random-effects model, when both fatal and non-fatal
stroke events were included.
Interestingly, the dose of aspirin appeared to have a minor effect on major bleeding in
our analysis. Although this might seem to be counter-intuitive, given prior evidence of
higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding with increasing aspirin doses [32], this might be
explained by the low number and small size of the included trials. An estimated trial with
sample size of approximately 7000 patients in each arm would be required to calculate a sta-
tistically significant 50% increase in major bleeding in the aspirin receiving arm, with 80%
power and 0.05 alpha. Similarly the current sample size of this meta-analysis was enough to

 evaluate a 20% decrease in mortality in the aspirin arm compared with controls. However, a
larger sample size is required to evaluate aspirin benefits at lower rates. This mandates the
conduction of a larger randomized clinical trial to further assess both the risk and benefit of
aspirin in PVD patients.
It is worth mentioning that more than 90% of the current analysis weight was contributed by
3 trials explicitly reporting outcomes in PVD patients without prior history of an ischemic
event with the majority of patients being asymptomatic [10, 21, 22]. This is concurrent with
prior evidence from large observational studies illustrating the lack of aspirin benefit in patients
with known history of coronary artery disease with no prior ischemic event (i.e. MI or stroke)
[6]. With that being said, the results of the current meta-analysis should not be generalized to
cover all patients with PVD, as the majority of PVD patients had asymptomatic disease with
small number of patients with symptomatic or acute disease.
To fit the current findings into clinical practice, several factors should be taken into consider-
ation including: benefit-risk balance of aspirin therapy and possible non-cardiovascular or cere-
brovascular benefits of aspirin in the general population. Although the results of the current
study showed a neutral effect of aspirin from a cardiovascular and major bleeding standpoint,
the use of aspirin might be advocated for alternative factors, such as its anti-inflammatory and
anti-tumorigenesis effects. One example is the prevention of colorectal cancer, as outlined in
the 2016 United State Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [33]. At the
same time, aspirin therapy is considerably cheaper than alternative antiplatelet and anticoagu-
lant agents, which are sometimes used for treatment of PVD, a factor that may potentiate com-
pliance issues in patients with low socioeconomic status. Another important aspect to consider
is the possible association of increased risk of recurrent ischemic events following abrupt dis-
continuation of aspirin, especially in patients with recent acute ischemic events or percutaneous
coronary interventions [34].
To our knowledge, the current meta-analysis of randomized trials represents the most
updated analysis comparing aspirin mono-therapy to placebo or no aspirin control. Despite
the large number of patients, the vigorous selection criteria and the conduction of various
sensitivity and meta-regression analyses, this study is not free from limitations. Limitations
of the current meta-analysis include the large weight of a single trial that might have driven
some of the outcomes toward its side. We attempted to overcome such limitation by con-
duction of a sensitivity analysis excluding this study and showed similar results. Some of the
outcomes, such as stroke had evidence of moderate heterogeneity. We used random-effects
models to account for such heterogeneity. Moreover, we conducted various meta-regression
and sensitivity analyses to explore the heterogeneity. Most of the included trials were older
publications prior to the statin era. Another limitation was the lack of outcome definition in
many of the included trials, which were conducted before the establishment of consensus
outcome definitions, such as BARC for major bleeding or the universal definition of MI.
We attempted to overcome such limitation by including reported outcomes that closely fit
those definitions whenever feasible. Finally, the lack of patient level data hindered the
assessment of aspirin efficacy and safety in certain patient subgroups such as the elderly,
women, or diabetic patients.
In conclusion, aspirin use in PVD patients might not be associated with improved cardio-
vascular outcomes. However, most of the trials addressing the topic appear to be older trials
with unclear risk of bias and outcomes definitions. Thus, larger randomized trials assessing the
efficacy and safety of aspirin in the contemporary era of statins use are mandatory to confirm
the current findings. The universal recommendation for aspirin therapy among patients with
stable PVD needs to be re-examined.
