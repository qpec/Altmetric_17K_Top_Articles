Grafting in Women and Men With Heart Failure and Preserved Versus
Reduced Ejection Fraction

Background-—Heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (rEF) is a widely regarded prognosticator after coronary artery
bypass grafting. HF with preserved ejection fraction (pEF) accounts for up to half of all HF cases and is associated with
considerable morbidity and mortality in hospitalized cohorts. However, HFpEF outcomes have not been elucidated in cardiac
surgical patients. We investigated the prevalence and outcomes of HFpEF and HFrEF in women and men following coronary artery
bypass grafting.
Methods and Results-—We conducted a retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada, between October 1, 2008, and March 31,
2015, using Cardiac Care Network and Canadian Institute of Health Information data. HF is captured through a validated
population-based database of all Ontarians with physician-diagnosed HF. We defined pEF as ejection fraction ≥50% and rEF as
ejection fraction <50%. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Analyses were stratified by sex. Mortality rates were
calculated using Kaplan–Meier method. The relative hazard of death was assessed using multivariable Cox proportional hazard
models. Of 40 083 patients (20.6% women), 55.5% had pEF without HF, 25.7% had rEF without HF, 6.9% had HFpEF, and 12.0% had
HFrEF. Age-standardized HFpEF mortality rates at 4�2 years of follow-up were similar in women and men. HFrEF standardized
HFpEF mortality rates were higher in women than men.
Conclusions-—We found a higher prevalence and poorer prognosis of HFpEF in women. A history of HF was a more important
prognosticator than ejection fraction. Preoperative screening and extended postoperative follow-up should be focused on women
and men with HF rather than on rEF alone. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:e008902. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.118.008902.)

H
eart failure (HF) is a known complication of coronary
artery disease (CAD) that is commonly treated with
coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). HF with reduced
ejection fraction (HFrEF) is a widely accepted risk factor for
operative and long-term mortality1,2 and has been the focus of
perioperative screening and optimization.3,4 HF with preserved
ejection fraction (HFpEF) is nearly as prevalent and fatal as
HFrEF5,6 but is poorly recognized in the perioperative realm.
The diagnosis of HFpEF is based on the presence of signs
and symptoms of HF and left ventricular ejection fraction (EF)
of ≥50%.7 There is regional variability in the prevalence of CAD
in patients with HFpEF.5,8,9 In addition, population-based
reports suggest that HFpEF can be associated with CAD and
is more prevalent in elderly women with a history of
hypertension or diabetes mellitus.10 Despite the importance
of HFpEF,11,12 its epidemiology has not been elucidated in the
diverse ethnic mix of surgical patients in North America, nor
have sex-stratified analyses of long-term outcomes of patients
with HFpEF who have undergone CABG ever been performed.
We investigated the prevalence and prognosis of HFpEF and
HFrEF in men and women who underwent CABG in Ontario,
Canada, from 2008 to 2015.

 Methods
Design and Study Population
We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study
in Ontario, Canada, between October 1, 2008, and March 31,
2015. The research ethics board of Sunnybrook Health
Sciences, Toronto, Canada, approved this study and waived
the need for informed consent. The data, analytic methods,
and study materials will not be made available to other
researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or
replicating the procedure.
Included were adult patients 40 years and older who
underwent primary isolated CABG in Ontario. We excluded
patients who were non-Ontario residents, who had a history of
cardiac surgery, or who had missing information regarding
age, sex, and left ventricular EF (Figure 1). During the study
period, Ontario was Canada’s most populous province with a
public-funded universal healthcare system that reimbursed all
healthcare providers and services.
Data Sources
The authors used the registry data of the CorHealth Ontario
and population-level administrative healthcare databases with
information on all Ontario residents available at the Institute
for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES). Individuals who
underwent primary isolated CABG were identified from the
CorHealth Ontario registry. The CorHealth Ontario registry is a
network of 18 hospitals that maintains a detailed prospective
clinical registry of all patients who undergo invasive cardiac
procedures in Ontario. It captures demographic, comorbidity,
and procedural-related information and has been validated
through selected chart audits. In addition, CorHealth Ontario
registry EF and angiographic data undergo core laboratory
validation.13
Administrative databases were linked deterministically
using encrypted unique confidential codes that preserved
patient confidentiality. The authors first linked the CorHealth
Ontario registry (date and type of cardiac procedures, left
ventricular function data) with the ICES Congestive Heart
Failure database to classify patients with CABG by EF and HF
status. The database is derived from physician billings based
on either 1 documented admission for HF alone or 1
outpatient claim for HF that was followed by at least 1
additional outpatient HF claim within 1 year. This algorithm
was validated in primary care patient records and shown to
have 85% sensitivity and 97% specificity in identifying HF
events.14 These data were then linked to the Canadian
Institute for Health Information’s Discharge Abstract Data-
base (DAD; comorbidities and hospital admissions) and Same
Day Surgery (SDS) database (comorbidities), Ontario Health
Insurance Plan (OHIP) database (physician service claims),
Registered Persons Database (RPDB; ascertainment of vital
statistics), and Canadian census. While lacking physiologic
and laboratory measures, these administrative databases
have been validated for many outcomes, exposures, and
comorbidities.15–18

Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• In a population-based retrospective cohort study of patients
undergoing isolated primary coronary artery bypass grafting,
we observed a higher prevalence of heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction in women.
• In addition, both the operative and long-term mortality rates
were higher in women with heart failure with preserved
ejection fraction.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Our findings highlight the need for a paradigm shift in
Western countries to improve the preoperative screening of
heart failure symptoms, regardless of ejection fraction.
• Specifically, further studies are required to incorporate heart
failure into cardiac surgical mortality prediction scores.
• Women and men with heart failure with preserved ejection
fraction should be the target of extended postoperative
follow-up and personally tailored interventions.

 Classification of HF by Left Ventricular Function
Preoperative EF was obtained from the CorHealth Ontario
registry and classified as preserved EF (pEF) if EF was ≥50%
and reduced EF (rEF) if EF was <50%. The authors then
categorized patients into 4 groups by EF and HF status:
HFpEF, HFrEF, pEF without HF, and rEF without HF.
Covariates
Comorbidities were identified from the CorHealth Ontario
registry and supplemented with data from DAD, SDS, and
OHIP using International Classification of Diseases––10th
Revision (ICD-10) codes19 within 5 years before CABG and
using validated algorithms (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease
[COPD],
asthma,
hypertension,
diabetes
mellitus).15,17,20,21 We estimated socioeconomic status based
on patients’ neighborhood median income in the Canadian
census and determined their residence (rural versus urban)
using Statistics Canada definitions.22 Emergent procedural
status was ascertained from the CorHealth Ontario registry
and

claims
data,
where
the
anesthesia provider identified the surgery as emergent under
the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status
classification. Height, weight, and body mass index identified
from the CorHealth Ontario registry were used to define
morbid obesity (weight >159 kg or body mass index ≥40 kg/
m2). Frailty status was identified using the Johns Hopkins
Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty-defining diagnoses indicator,
which is an instrument designed and validated for research of
frailty-related outcomes and resource utilization using admin-
istrative data.23–27
Outcome
The primary outcome was death from any cause. We
confirmed in-hospital mortality using the DAD and post-
discharge mortality using RPDB.
Statistical Analysis
L.Y.S. and A.B.E. had full access to all of the data in the
study and take responsibility for its integrity and for the data
analysis. All analyses were performed in the overall cohort
and then stratified by sex. Continuous variables were
expressed as mean (SD) and categorical variables as number
(proportions). Mortality was assessed at 30 days postoper-
atively and through March 31, 2016. Patients were censored
at the front end when they lost possession of a valid Ontario
health insurance card for 2 consecutive eligibility quarters
(ie, have left the province of Ontario). Survival time was
defined as date of index surgery until date of death or date
of last follow-up. Event rates in each group were calculated
using the Kaplan–Meier method and presented graphically,
with the significance of differences in mortality between
groups assessed using the log-rank test. Sex-specific long-
term mortality rates were standardized by age, and pooled
long-term mortality rates were standardized by age and sex
using the 2011 Canadian population as the reference. The
risk of death was assessed using Cox proportional hazard
models with multivariable adjustment. We explored the
modifying effect of sex and identified sex-specific risk
factors for long-term mortality using multiplicative interac-
tion terms.
We performed 2 sensitivity analyses. First, we used
generalized estimating equations to determine the adjusted
association of patient-level characteristics with 30-day and
long-term mortality while accounting for clustering of patients
within hospitals.28 Next, we added completeness of revascu-
larization to this generalized estimating equations model to
evaluate the impact of incomplete revascularization on early
and long-term mortality. Incomplete revascularization was
defined as presence of ≥1 ungrafted vessels with ≥70%
stenosis in the left anterior descending, circumflex, or right
coronary artery territories.
The measure of association was hazard ratios (HRs) with
95% confidence intervals (CIs). Analyses were performed
using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute), with statistical significance
defined by a 2-sided P value of <0.05.
Results
Prevalence of pEF and rEF
A total of 40 083 consecutive patients who underwent CABG
from 2008 to 2015 were included in the study. Of these
patients, 8248 (20.6%) were women. Demographics and
comorbidities of patients with pEF and rEF with and without
HF are summarized in Table 1. Overall, 22 231 patients
(55.5%) had pEF and no HF, 10 284 patients (25.7%) had rEF
and no HF, 2752 patients (6.9%) had HFpEF, and 4816
patients (12.0%) had HFrEF. Patients with HF were older, were
more likely to be female, were of lower income status, had
hypertension, and had atrial fibrillation, cerebral and periph-
eral vascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes
mellitus, hypothyroidism, anemia, or renal and liver disease.
Of all patients with HFpEF, 873 (31.7%) were women.
Women with HFpEF were more likely than men to be older, of
lower income status, to undergo emergent surgery, and to
have comorbidities such as recent myocardial infarction (MI),
hypertension, COPD/asthma, diabetes mellitus, hypothy-
roidism, and anemia, but less likely to have undergone
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or to have remote
MI, atrial fibrillation, morbid obesity, chronic renal disease,
and dialysis (Table 2).

 Of all patients with HFrEF, 1090 (22.6%) were women.
Women with HFrEF were more likely than men to be older, to
be of slightly lower income status, to undergo emergent
surgery, and to have comorbidities such as recent MI,
hypertension, COPD/asthma, diabetes mellitus, hypothy-
roidism, and anemia, but less likely to have had a remote
MI, atrial fibrillation, and morbid obesity (Table 2). Rates of
previous PCI were no different between women and men with
HFrEF.
30-Day Mortality
The proportion of deaths at 30 days was highest in patients
with HF, especially in those with HFrEF (5.1%; 244 of 4816

 patients). Kaplan–Meier survival estimates for each of these
groups are illustrated in Figure 2. At 30 days, 90 patients
(3.3%) with HFpEF died; this was nearly 5-fold the proportion
of deaths in the group with pEF but no HF (0.7%) and 2.5-fold
that of the group with rEF but no HF (1.3%; Table 3). Similarly,
the adjusted risks of 30-day mortality were higher in patients
with HF. After multivariable adjustment of all variables listed
in Table 4, the HRs for rEF without HF, HFpEF, and HFrEF
were 1.56 (95% CI, 1.23–1.97), 2.60 (95% CI, 1.98–3.40), and
3.92 (95% CI, 3.15–4.90), respectively, compared with those
with pEF and no HF. Female sex was associated with a higher
risk of mortality at 30 days (adjusted HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.26–
1.78). The association of sex and early mortality remained
robust in the sensitivity analyses that accounted for clustering
of patients within hospitals and completeness of revascular-
ization. Of note, incomplete revascularization was associated

 with a higher risk of early mortality (adjusted HR, 1.24; 95%
CI, 1.06–1.46).
Table 3 and Figure 3 summarize the mortality statistics in
men and women. Overall, there was a higher proportion of
deaths in women than men in the early postoperative period.
Women with HFpEF had double the mortality rate compared
with their male counterparts, while women with HFrEF had a
mortality rate that was 1.5-fold that of men. After multivari-
able adjustment, the early mortality risk was 2.89 (95% CI,
1.91–4.37) in women with HFpEF and 2.32 (95% CI, 1.62–
2.34) in men with HFpEF. In patients with HFrEF, the adjusted
HR was 3.51 (95% CI, 2.38–5.17) in women and 3.96 (95% CI,
3.03–5.18) in men.
Sex modified the correlation between past PCI and 30-day
mortality (Table 5). Specifically, a history of PCI was corre-
lated with an increased mortality risk in women (adjusted HR,
1.84; 95% CI, 1.30–2.61) but not in men (adjusted HR, 0.89;
95% CI, 0.67–1.18).

 Long-Term Mortality
The mean follow-up period was 4.0�2.0 years. The median
follow-up time was 3.9 years (interquartile range, 2.3–5.6).
The maximum follow-up period was 7.5 years. The total
follow-up time was 58 081 087 person-years. During the
follow-up period, a total of 4423 (11.0%) patients died. These
deaths included 1440 (6.5%) of pEF without HF, 1037 (10.1%)
of rEF without HF, 594 (21.6%) of HFpEF, and 1352 (28.1%) of
HFrEF. The Kaplan–Meier survival estimates for each of these
groups are illustrated in Figure 4. The age- and sex-
standardized long-term mortality rate per 1000 person-years
was highest in the HFrEF group (69; 95% CI, 59–80). The
standardized long-term mortality rate in patients with HFpEF
(42; 95% CI, 36–50) was 3-fold that of patients with
pEF without HF (14; 95% CI, 12–16) and nearly 2-fold that
of rEF without HF (22; 95% CI, 18–25). After multivariable
adjustment of all risk factors listed in Table 6 and with pEF
without HF as the reference group, the HRs were 1.36 (95%
CI, 1.25–1.48) for rEF without HF, 2.06 (95% CI, 1.86–2.27)
for HFpEF, and 2.78 (95% CI, 2.57–3.02) for HFrEF. Female
sex was associated with a small increase in long-term
mortality risk as compared with men (adjusted HR, 1.07;
95% CI, 1.00–1.14). The association of sex and long-term
mortality remained robust in the sensitivity analyses that
accounted for clustering of patients within hospitals and
completeness
of
revascularization.
Of
note,
incomplete
revascularization was associated with a higher risk of long-
term mortality (adjusted HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.12–1.26).
Table 3 summarizes the mortality rates and adjusted HRs
in men and women, while Figure 5 demonstrates the
estimated long-term survival stratified by sex. Women with
HFrEF had higher standardized long-term mortality rates than

 men. While the adjusted HRs for long-term mortality were
similar between the sexes in the HFpEF subgroup, women
with HFrEF had a slightly lower risk of death compared with
men.
Sex modified the correlation between long-term mortality
and age, recent MI, COPD/asthma, and anemia (Table 5).
There was no sex-based difference in long-term mortality in
patients younger than 75 years. Although age older than 75
years was associated with a higher risk of death in both sexes,
this risk was higher in men compared with women. In
addition, COPD/asthma were associated with a higher
mortality risk in men, while recent MI and anemia were
associated with higher mortality risk in women.
As a post hoc analysis to investigate factors that
contributed to poorer outcomes in women, we examined the
sex differences in HF onset and severity before and following
CABG (Table 7). We found that women had higher rates of HF
admissions before CABG and experienced significantly longer
intervals from onset of HF symptoms until CABG compared
with men. In the year following CABG, women had significantly
higher rates of MI, repeat revascularization, stroke, new-onset
dialysis, HF admission, and admission to long-term care
facilities compared with men.
Discussion
This population-based study found that a history of HF was a
more important prognosticator than EF in patients with CABG.
Four main findings were derived from this study. (1) The
prevalence and long-term mortality rates of HF were higher in
women than men. (2) Women had a higher adjusted risk of
30-day and long-term mortality compared with men. (3) A
history of PCI was correlated with an increased risk of 30-day
mortality in women but not in men. For long-term mortality,
age 75 years and older and COPD/asthma were associated
with increased risk in men, while recent MI and anemia were
associated with increased risk in women. (4) Women had
higher rates of HF admissions in the year leading up to CABG
and experienced a longer delay from HF onset until revascu-
larization when compared with men.
Sex Differences in HF Prevalence and Mortality
Our investigation is the first population-based study to
address the sex differences in HFpEF prevalence and
outcomes in patients with CABG. Congruent with previous
reports, we found a greater proportion of women in the HFpEF
subgroup (31.7%) than the HFrEF subgroup (22.6%).5,6,11
Studies of hospitalized patients with HF found that HFpEF
contributed to nearly half of the HF cases and was nearly as
fatal as HFrEF.5,6 In our study, the overall prevalence of HFpEF
was only half that of HFrEF. Our finding possibly suggests the
presence of a natural selection bias, whereby patients with
CABG were more likely to present with HFrEF as a result of
CAD being a stronger risk factor for HFrEF than HFpEF.
However, we cannot rule out the possibility of under-

 recognition of the HFpEF syndrome in the perioperative
setting.
In addition, we found that in the HFpEF group, the 30-day
mortality rate was higher in women than men. This is an
important observation as nearly 50% of all HF cases occur in
women, but HF in women remains a poorly recognized and
understood syndrome.29 Despite better outpatient survival from
HF in women compared with men, we found this pattern to be
reversed in the perioperative setting, especially in those with
preserved EF. Our post hoc analysis further characterized HF by
sex in surgical patients. We found that women had higher rates
of acute HF admissions both within 90 days and 1 year before
CABG. In addition, there was a longer delay from HF onset until
CABG in women compared with men. These findings suggest
that in addition to potential delay in definitive treatment of
ischemic heart disease, women likely also present with more
advanced stages of HF at the time of surgery, which would
naturally have an impact on their post-CABG survival. Our
findings also suggest that regardless of HF status, there was a
higher rate of complications in women that had not only led to
poorer survival but also had implications on their quality of life.
There is therefore an urgent need for improved recognition of
the sex differences in HF presentation30 and research to inform
tailored perioperative management and follow-up.
CAD is a leading cause of HF for both sexes. The severity
of CAD is often underestimated in women compared with
men, possibly because of the likelihood for an atypical
presentation to CAD for women.31 When diagnosed with CAD,
women are less likely than men to undergo cardiac catheter-
ization and revascularization.32 This is an important observa-
tion, especially since patients with HFpEF with incomplete
revascularization displayed greater deterioration in EF and
increased mortality.8 Notably, the better prognosis of HFpEF
observed in the current study is likely in part caused by a
higher proportion of the HFpEF group having previous PCIs
than the HFrEF group. In a small study of patients with HFpEF
with CAD, those who underwent CABG had similar short-term
mortality but better long-term survival than those who
underwent PCI.12 This study and ours support the importance
of timely revascularization in women with HFpEF.
We found that the adjusted risk of mortality differed in
HFpEF versus HFrEF, especially over the short term. These
findings are congruent with the Swedish CABG study,11 with
the observation that the risk of 30-day mortality was higher in
Swedish patients with rEF without HF (adjusted HR, 2.25 [95%
CI, 1.86–2.73] compared with 1.56 [95% CI, 1.23–1.97] in our
cohort). Conversely, the risk of 30-day mortality in Swedish
patients with HF (adjusted HR of 1.83 in HFpEF and 2.52 in
HFrEF) was much lower than in our cohort (adjusted HR of
2.60 in HFpEF and 3.92 in HFrEF). These observations could
reflect regional differences in management of chronic HF and
HF risk factors, as well as perioperative management of
patients with HF. The HFpEF comorbidities found in the
present study (ie, older age, female sex, frailty, hypertension,
absence of previous MI, diabetes mellitus, and obesity) were
consistent with previous studies.5,33

Post-CABG Survival in Patients With Heart Failure

 HFrEF is a well-recognized risk factor for short- and long-term
mortality after CABG surgery,2–4,11 although the prognostic role
of sex is still poorly understood in this group. A post hoc analysis
of the IMAGINE (Ischemia Management With Accupril Post
Bypass Graft via Inhibition of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme)
trial found female sex to be a nonsignificant predictor of death
after multivariable adjustment and concluded that definitive
answers regarding sex differences in long-term outcomes after
CABG should come from future pooling of studies comprising a
larger number ofwomen.34Our studyprovides, sofar,the largest
cohort to evaluate the differences in CABG outcomes in men and
women with rEF. We found that although the short- and long-
term mortality rates were higher in women, the adjusted risk of
death was lower in women with HFrEF and similar between the
sexes in rEF without HF. This possibly reflects the longer life
expectancy in women, as well as the widespread recognition of
theimportanceofHFrEFmanagementintheperioperativeperiod
and in long-term follow-up.
EF and Perioperative Management
Perioperative risk stratification and management have been
“EF-centric,” with much attention being dedicated to the
optimization of rEF. Nonetheless, HFpEF remains a deadly yet
neglected syndrome. Similar to a recent Swedish population-
based study,11 our research found the adjusted mortality risk to
be higher in HFpEF than in rEF without HF and higher in HFrEF
than HFpEF. On the contrary, a small Japanese study found no
difference in 5-year survival post-CABG in patients with HFpEF
and HFrEF.12 This discrepancy is likely attributable to regional
and ethnic differences in HF risk factors and outcomes, as well
as possible increased awareness of the HFpEF syndrome in
Japan. These findings highlight the need for a paradigm shift in
Western countries to improve the preoperative screening of HF
symptoms, regardless of EF. Specifically, a history of HF is not
included in commonly used cardiac surgery mortality risk
scores. The EuroScore II35 incorporates preoperative EF but
does not account for HF in the calculation of early operative
mortality. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk model36
includes preoperative EF and New York Heart Association
functional status (a classification of physical activity limita-
tions) but not a history of HF. Our study highlights the need to
revise the current risk scoring systems and improve the
recognition and management of HFpEF, especially in women.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the sex differences in
outcomes by HF status are representative of perioperative
practice in Ontario. Similar research needs to be conducted in
other settings to confirm the generalizability of our findings.
Second, our data sources lacked some relevant detailed
information such as smoking history. The inability to measure,
and thereby adjust for, differences in such characteristics
could have explained, in part, the differences in mortality rates
observed in this study. Third, the lack of natriuretic peptides
measurements precluded the use of this biomarker as a third
diagnostic criterion for HFpEF7 and possibly contributed to
misclassification of HFpEF as pEF without HF. However,
biomarker measurements are not a routine practice in
Ontario, and whether BNP would further improve risk
stratification in patients with HF, above and beyond physi-
cian-diagnosed HF, remains to be determined. Fourth, our
reporting of sex-specific risk factors is to be interpreted in the

 context of multiple testing. Finally, cohort studies are by
nature subject to residual confounding.
Conclusions
In a large cohort of patients who underwent primary CABG, we
found a higher prevalence of HFpEF in women and a higher
risk of operative mortality in women compared with men with
HFpEF. HFpEF is an important predictor of operative and long-
term mortality. Rather than being “EF-centric,” efforts should
be given to earlier recognition of HF symptoms in women and
timely referral of these patients for revascularization. Simi-
larly, perioperative risk stratification and extended postoper-
ative
follow-up
including
tailored
therapy
and
home
monitoring should be focused on women and men with signs
and symptoms of HF rather than on reduced EF alone.
