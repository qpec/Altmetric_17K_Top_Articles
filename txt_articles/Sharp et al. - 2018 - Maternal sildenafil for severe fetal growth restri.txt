Summary
Background Severe early-onset fetal growth restriction can lead to a range of adverse outcomes including fetal or 
neonatal death, neurodisability, and lifelong risks to the health of the affected child. Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase 
type 5 inhibitor, potentiates the actions of nitric oxide, which leads to vasodilatation of the uterine vessels and might 
improve fetal growth in utero.
Methods We did this superiority, placebo-controlled randomised trial in 19 fetal medicine units in the UK. We used 
random computer allocation (1:1) to assign women with singleton pregnancies between 22 weeks and 0 days’ gestation 
and 29 weeks and 6 days’ gestation and severe early-onset fetal growth restriction to receive either sildenafil 25 mg 
three times daily or placebo until 32 weeks and 0 days’ gestation or delivery. We stratified women by site and by their 
gestational age at randomisation (before week 26 and 0 days or at week 26 and 0 days or later). We defined fetal growth 
restriction as a combination of estimated fetal weight or abdominal circumference below tenth percentile and absent 
or reversed end-diastolic blood flow in the umbilical artery on Doppler velocimetry. The primary outcome was the time 
from randomisation to delivery, measured in days. This study is registered with BioMed Central, number ISRCTN 
39133303.
Findings Between Nov 21, 2014, and July 6, 2016, we recruited 135 women and randomly assigned 70 women to sildenafil 
and 65 women to placebo. We found no difference in the median randomisation to delivery interval between women 
assigned to sildenafil (17 days [IQR 7–24]) and women assigned to placebo (18 days [8–28]; p=0·23). Livebirths (relative 
risk [RR] 1·06, 95% CI 0·84 to 1·33; p=0·62), fetal deaths (0·89, 0·54 to 1·45; p=0·64), neonatal deaths (1·33, 0·54 to 
3·28; p=0·53), and birthweight (–14 g,–100 to 126; p=0·81) did not differ between groups. No differences were found for 
any other secondary outcomes. Eight serious adverse events were reported during the course of the study (six in the 
placebo group and two in the sildenafil group); none of these were attributed to sildenafil.
Interpretation Sildenafil did not prolong pregnancy or improve pregnancy outcomes in severe early-onset fetal growth 
restriction and therefore it should not be prescribed for this indication outside of research studies with explicit 
participants’ consent.

Introduction
Severe early-onset fetal growth restriction and subsequent 
preterm birth are associated with a range of adverse 
pregnancy outcomes including fetal and neonatal death,1–3 
necrotising enterocolitis,3 respiratory complications,3 
neurodisability,4–7 and lifelong risks to the health of the 
affected child, such as obesity and hypertensive disease.8–10 
No effective treatment for fetal growth restriction is 
available and the mainstay of management is intensive 
surveillance to optimise the timing of delivery.11 In a similar 
patient group at the threshold of viability, it has been 
suggested that the overall survival increases by 2% for each 
extra day in utero.2 Delaying delivery, however, might 
increase the risk of long-term adverse outcomes because of 
prolonged exposure to a hostile uterine environment.
In normal pregnancy, trophoblasts invade and remodel 
maternal spiral arteries resulting in a low-resistance, 
high-flow placental bed circulation.12 Failure of this 
remodelling process is a predominant feature of fetal 
growth restriction.13,14 Retention of vasoactive smooth 
muscle cells within spiral arteries promotes placental 
under-perfusion and hypoxia-reperfusion injury.15
Placental perfusion is enhanced by nitric oxide (NO), 
which promotes vasodilatation of maternal vessels. The 
NO second messenger cGMP is degraded by the 
phosphodiesterase enzyme class. Sildenafil citrate is an 
inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5), the 
predominant PDE type found in the reproductive tract.16 
Sildenafil has shown promise in cohort studies and 
randomised studies of fetal growth restriction,17–20

Global interest in sildenafil as a potential treatment for 
fetal growth restriction has led to several coordinated 
national studies that are embedded in the Global 
Obstetric Network (GONet). This initiative includes 
harmonised data collection and a commitment to a 
prospective individual patient data meta-analysis.30 In 
this study, we aimed to report the results of the first study 
from this initiative—a randomised trial hypothesising 
that sildenafil can delay the birth of the severely growth-
restricted fetus by at least 1 week by increasing blood 
flow to the placental bed with subsequent improvement 
in fetal growth and wellbeing in utero.
Methods
Study design and participants
The study was designed as a randomised controlled trial 
with sildenafil, or the placebo equivalent, prescribed at a 
dose of 25 mg three times per day. This dosage regime 
was based on previous studies18,21 by the collaborators on 
this project. We recruited participants from 19 fetal 
medicine units in the UK. All women had a singleton 
pregnancy between 22 weeks and 0 days’ gestation and 
29 weeks and 6 days’ gestation with a diagnosis of fetal 
growth restriction and had agreed to expectant 
management. For the purposes of the study, we defined 
fetal growth restriction as a fetus with abdominal 
circumference or estimated fetal weight below the tenth 
percentile using local charts and absent or reversed end-
diastolic flow in the umbilical artery on Doppler 
velocimetry. We excluded women from the study if they 
were younger than 16 years old, had a known 
contraindication or allergy to sildenafil, had known or 
suspected significant chromosomal or structural 
anomaly, reported current cocaine use, or had a 
condition which was likely to require delivery within 
72 h (such as severe pre-eclampsia).
Ethical approval was given by the North East Research 
Ethics Committee (14/NE/0011) in the UK. Each par-
ticipating site provided a site-specific approval and all 
participants 
provided 
written 
informed 
consent. 
An Independent Safety Data Monitoring Committee 
(ISDMC) was established to review the safety and efficacy 
data. The protocol was first registered on July 31, 2014, 
4 months before the first patient was recruited (number 
ISRCTN 39133303).
Randomisation and masking
We used a web-based application to allocate treatment 
(1:1) with randomisation stratified by site and gestation 
(<26 weeks and 0 days and ≥26 weeks and 0 days). 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
When we designed this study, antenatal treatment was not 
available for early-onset fetal growth restriction due to 
placental insufficiency. To date, management strategies involve 
only intensive fetal surveillance with elective delivery, done 
when presumed fetal acidosis or distress is evident. We 
hypothesised that sildenafil has the potential to increase 
utero-placental perfusion, resulting in improved fetal growth 
and wellbeing. Our previous animal and in-vitro human studies 
supported this concept. Our interest in the use of sildenafil for 
the treatment of placental ischaemic conditions first led to a 
small randomised controlled trial (RCT) in women with 
early-onset pre-eclampsia. Although pre-eclampsia did not 
improve, we observed an increase in the median birthweight in 
the sildenafil-treated group. Patients could be offered 
innovative therapy through formal information sharing and 
consenting process within the British Columbia Provincial 
Health Services Authority. In this setting, sildenafil treatment 
was included in the management of a series of ten women with 
severe early-onset intrauterine growth restriction and 
compared with 17 women who fulfilled the treatment criteria, 
but either declined or were not offered sildenafil. Women 
treated with sildenafil had fetuses with increased fetal 
abdominal circumference growth velocity after treatment, and 
these fetuses tended to be more frequently liveborn and able to 
survive intact to primary hospital discharge. Similar 
improvements in fetal blood flow have been observed in 
another small RCT of fetal growth restriction fetuses. On the 
basis of this evidence, an international collaboration (STRIDER) 
was established with the aim to evaluate the effectiveness and 
safety of sildenafil for fetal growth restriction in a prospective 
individual patient data meta-analysis from a series of national 
RCTs using similar protocols and a common dataset.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first RCT of sildenafil for severe, 
early-onset fetal growth restriction from the international 
STRIDER collaboration. Our study shows no evidence of 
beneficial effects in terms of prolongation of pregnancy, 
neonatal survival, morbidity, or feto-placental perfusion. 
Long-term benefits or harm for children cannot be excluded 
at this stage and are being investigated with long-term 
follow-up of survivors and planned prospective individual 
patient data meta-analysis.
Implications of all the available evidence
Contrary to some smaller studies that suggest possible 
improvement in utero-placental perfusion in fetal growth 
restriction pregnancies with sildenafil, our study showed no 
such effect and no indication of efficacy. Therefore, clinicians 
worldwide should stop prescribing sildenafil for this 
indication outside of research studies with explicit 
participants’ consent. Studies should include long-term 
follow-up assessments of surviving children.

Gestational age was confirmed by first trimester 
ultrasound and, in each case, the diagnosis of severe 
early-onset fetal growth restriction was confirmed by a 
fetal medicine expert having excluded fetal anatomical 
abnormalities. In addition, a full history was taken, 
measurements of maternal cardiovascular parameters 
(pulse and blood pressure), fetal biometry, and Doppler 
velocimetry were taken, and maternal venepuncture for 
angiogenic biomarkers was carried out at randomisation. 
Randomisation lists were pregenerated using randomly 
permuted blocks of size two and four.
All participants had a further assessment of blood 
pressure, pulse rate, and a blood sample taken 2 h after 
receiving their first oral dose. Subsequently, women were 
followed up within 3–4 days and at weekly intervals 
thereafter, or earlier when clinically indicated. The rest of 
clinical care was at the discretion of the local fetal 
medicine experts and included regular ultrasound 
assessment of growth and Doppler blood flow and 
antenatal cardiotocography. The consensus was reached 
that an expectant management is considered standard of 
care and that, whenever possible, the fetal growth 
restriction management would be consistent with the 
TRUFFLE study protocol.11
Medication was overencapsulated (Sharp Clinical 
Services, Crickhowell, UK) to ensure that patient, 
clinicians, and pharmacists were masked to the study 
drug. All participants received oral medication, 
sildenafil 25 mg or placebo, three times a day. 
Medication was dispensed in 10 day supplies with a new 
supply being provided every week to ensure there was 
no period when medication was missed. We used 
pharmacy logs to monitor adherence. We stopped 
treatment at 32 weeks and 0 days or delivery, whichever 
came first. We advised women of potential side-effects 
and their family physician was informed by letter of trial 
participation.
We collected data on pregnancy outcome prospectively 
from the clinical maternity notes and entered them on a 
secure electronic database. We monitored data quality 
and protocol compliance regularly with both central and 
on-site monitoring methods.
Outcome measures
The primary efficacy outcome was the time from 
randomisation to delivery, measured in days. We chose 
this outcome because any safe prolongation of 
pregnancy is likely to be beneficial for the fetal growth-
restricted fetus, with a reported daily increase in 
survival2 and both short-term neonatal adverse outcomes 
and neurodisability being closely correlated with 
gestation at birth.2,31,32 We considered other strong 
predictors of adverse outcomes in fetal growth-restricted 
fetuses, which include abnormal blood flow in the

umbilical artery and estimated fetal weight below third 
percentile,33 but a consensus was reached that, given the 
severity of fetal growth restriction in our cohort, these 
other parameters would be less responsive to any 
potential beneficial effect of sildenafil.
Secondary outcomes included livebirths, fetal and 
neonatal deaths, birthweight, neonatal morbidity (any 
intraventricular haemorrhage, oxygen dependency at 
28 days and 36 weeks corrected gestational age, necro-
tising enterocolitis, or retinopathy of prematurity), use of 
surfactant, ventilator dependency, admission to neonatal 
intensive care unit, time to newborn discharge, and 
maternal side-effects.
To elucidate the mechanism of sildenafil action, we 
planned to compare the changes between two randomised 
groups in the uteroplacental and fetal circulation 
assessed by Doppler ultrasound and in the concentrations 
of angiogenic biomarkers; placental growth factor 
(PlGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 
soluble endoglin (sENG), and soluble fms-like tyrosine 
kinase 1 (sFlt-1). Four vessels were examined serially with 
Doppler ultrasound, umbilical artery, middle cerebral 
artery, ductus venosus, and uterine artery, at least weekly 
from randomisation until delivery. In addition to the 
pulsatility index, umbilical artery end-diastolic flow, 
ductus venosus a-wave and bilateral uterine artery 
notching was recorded. We have defined an improvement 
or deterioration as a significant change in the Doppler 
findings between visits. For umbilical artery, the 
abnormal findings were raised pulsatility index, absent 
end-diastolic flow, or reversed end-diastolic flow; for 
middle cerebral artery, pulsatility index was either normal 
or low (<5th percentile); for ductus venosus a-wave was 
either present, absent or reversed, and for uterine artery 
Doppler findings were recorded as abnormal if mean 
pulsatility index was more than 1·45 or if bilateral 
notching was present.
We collected serum and plasma samples (≥2 mL) 
serially for 2 weeks. A maximum of six samples were 
taken during the antenatal period: immediately before 
drug administration, 2 h after, and on days 3, 7, 10, and 14, 
in line with a standardised operating procedure. All 
samples were analysed retrospectively and were not 
revealed to the clinicians. We determined maternal serum 
concentrations of sFlt-1 and PlGF (pg/mL) using the 
automated Elecsys electro-chemiluminescence immuno-
assay platform (Roche Cobas, Mannheim, Germany) and 
used these concentrations to calculate sFlt-1:PlGF ratio. 
Additional analysis of PlGF was done on baseline 
(pretreatment) plasma samples using the Alere Triage 
system (Alere, San Diego, CA, USA). We analysed 
maternal serum concentraitons of VEGF (pg/mL) and 
sEng (ng/mL) using human Quantikine enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assays (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, 
MN, USA).
Adverse events and adherence
We assessed and recorded adverse events and adherence 
at weekly clinical visits from recruitment to delivery. We 
encouraged participants to record any side-effects or 
adverse events that would then be reviewed and docu-
mented during each clinical visit. We assessed adherence 
weekly during clinical review and recorded any temporary 
discontinuations in treatment. We considered adherence 
to treatment to be good if the reported intake of tablets

was 90% or more of the total expected to have been taken 
between randomisation and the date of the visit.
Statistical analysis
We derived the recruitment target from audits of outcomes 
of severe fetal growth restriction from four participating 
hospitals in which potentially eligible pregnant women 
remained undelivered for a mean of 20 days (SD 11). To 
confirm that sildenafil can prolong pregnancy by 7 days, 
we needed to recruit a total of 104 women (α 5%, 
power 90%). Although we did not anticipate any loss to 
follow-up, we planned to recruit 112 women, which was 
later increased to 135 women in consultation with the 
ISDMC to account for lower than expected livebirths 
(protocol was updated). Although the power for the 
primary outcome increased to 94% (post-hoc calculation), 
this increased sample size would still not have adequate 
power to detect clinically important differences for most 
secondary outcomes.
We defined participants’ groups for analysis on an 
intention-to-treat 
basis. 
We 
presented 
unadjusted 
estimates with Kaplan Meier estimates and analysed with 
linear regression techniques, including the stratification 
factor as a main effect. We reported the treatment effect as 
the mean difference between groups. We determined 
statistical significance as p=0·05 or less. We included 
women randomised before week 26 and 0 days and at 
week 26 and 0 days or later in the subgroup analyses.
For continuous data, the analysis of secondary outcomes 
matched the analysis for the primary outcome. We 
compared binary data across treatment groups using a 
χ² test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate and reported 
using relative risk [RR] with 95% confidence intervals. We 
analysed biomarker data (PlGF, sFlt-1, sENG, and 
sFlt-1:PlGF ratio) using repeated measures ANOVA 
methods including terms for time, treatment allocation, 
and their interaction. Model results are presented in terms 
of means and 95% CIs. We did all analyses with the 
statistical software package, R (version 3.3.3).

Results
We recruited 135 women between Nov 21, 2014, and 
July 6, 2016, from 19 fetal medicine units within the UK 
(figure 1). 75 women were recruited before 26 weeks and 
0 days’ gestation and 60 women between 26 weeks 
and 0 days’ gestation and 29 weeks and 6 days’ gestation. 
We randomly assigned 70 women to sildenafil and 
65 women to placebo. None of the women withdrew their 
consent nor were lost to follow-up; therefore, we did not 
do additional per-protocol analysis.

pre-eclampsia, but more women self-reported smoking 
in pregnancy in the sildenafil group than the placebo 
group (table 1).
The median gestation at randomisation was 24·4 weeks 
(IQR 24·0–27·5; table 1). At randomisation, reversed 
Doppler umbilical artery end-diastolic flow was detected in 
44 (33%) participants (table 1). The remaining participants 
all had absent umbilical artery end-diastolic flow. The fetal 
ductus venosus a-wave was absent or reversed in 
eight (6%) participants (table 1). The estimated fetal weight 
at randomisation was 445 g (IQR 344–608; table 1). 
69 (51%) fetuses had an estimated fetal weight below 500 g 
(table 1). Two babies were postnatally diagnosed with 
Down’s syndrome (one allocated to the placebo group and 
the other to the sildenafil group) and two had confirmed 
cytomegalovirus infection (one allocated to the placebo 
group and the other to the sildenafil group); all four were 
included in the intention-to-treat analysis.
The median time between randomisation and delivery 
was 18 days (IQR 8–27) days: 17 days (7–24) in the 
sildenafil group and 18 days (8–28) in the placebo group 
(p=0·23; table 2, figure 2) and linear regression showed 
time to delivery did not differ between the treatment 
groups for all participants (2·7 days, 95% CI –1·3 to 6·8; 
p=0·19; figure 2). 
Of the 135 participants, 98 (73%) women had at least 
two separate umbilical artery Doppler measurements 
a minimum of 48 h apart: 93 (69%) for ductus venosus, 
90 (67%) for middle cerebral artery, and 87 (64%) for 
uterine arteries (table 3). Ductus venosus a-wave 
deteriorated over time in more women treated with 
sildenafil than with placebo (table 3). 18 (95%) of 
19 babies in whom ductus venosus deteriorated were 
randomly assigned before 26 weeks’ gestation (table 3). 
Between-group differences were not observed in the 
pattern of Doppler changes in uterine arteries or the 
other two examined fetal vessels (umbilical artery and 
middle cerebral artery; table 3).
The 
exposure 
to 
antenatal 
corticosteroids 
and 
magnesium sulphate given for neuroprotection was 
similar in both groups (table 3). Caesarean sections did not 
differ between the two groups (table 3), with 98% (90 of 92) 
of all livebirths delivered by caesarean section (table 4).
Livebirth rates and neonatal deaths did not differ 
between treatment groups (table 4). 43 (72%) of the 
60 deaths occurred in utero and 48 (80%) deaths occurred 
in the subgroup randomly assigned before 26 weeks 
(table 4). Differences were not clinically significant 
between groups for any other prespecified secondary 
outcomes (table 4).
Eight serious adverse events were reported during the 
course of the study; none of these were attributed to 
sildenafil. 
Three 
(38%) 
were 
maternal 
hospital 
admissions in the placebo group; one for antepartum 
haemorrhage, one for being generally unwell, dizzy, and 
light-headed, and one following a stillbirth with 
drowsiness. Two neonatal severe adverse events were 
reported in the sildenafil group; the baby with Down’s 
syndrome had an atrioventricular septal defect and fetal 
intracranial haemorrhage grade 1 detected on antenatal 
research MRI done in the context of a separate research 
study. In the placebo group, three severe adverse events 
were reported; one baby had Down’s syndrome, a fetal 
intracranial haemorrhage was reported, and one baby 
had bone fractures that were postnatally attributed to 
osteopenia or metabolic bone disease (data not shown). 
Overall, 42 women reported 94 side-effects: 24 (34%) in 
the sildenafil group and 18 (28%) in the placebo group 
(RR 1·24, 95% CI 0·74–2·06; p=0·41). Most side-effects 
were reported as facial flushing (45 [48%] of 94), and 
others included nasal congestion, dry mouth, and 
headaches (appendix). 
Good adherence was reported; of the 265 recorded 
cycles of therapy, 257 (97%) reported that drug adherence 
was at least 90%. At a participant level, 130 (96%) of the 
135 participants had study drug compliance of at least 
90% for all cycles of therapy (data not shown). 
Angiogenic biomarker data did not change either over 
time or because of the administration of sildenafil 
(appendix). VEGF concentrations were found to be below 
the lowest assay standard (30 pg/mL) in all cases and 
were therefore not included in the analysis.
Discussion
Sildenafil did not result in prolongation of pregnancy 
when administered to pregnant women with a severely 
growth-restricted 
fetus. 
No 
clinically 
important 
differences in mortality or short-term neonatal morbidity 
occurred between the two groups, although the trial was 
not adequately powered for these secondary outcomes.

We anticipated a beneficial effect on placental function 
if sildenafil treatment was effective, as assessed by 
uteroplacental and fetal Doppler studies and angiogenic 
biomarkers, even in the absence of a clear benefit on 
substantive clinical outcomes. The observed higher 
proportion of babies in whom Doppler findings in ductus 
venosus deteriorated with sildenafil treatment might have 
been a chance finding, but is also potentially worrying, 
particularly if linked to the slightly shorter randomisation 
to delivery interval in this group. We found no such

adverse effect from sildenafil on the blood flow in uterine 
arteries, umbilical artery, or middle cerebral artery. 
Although we could not obtain two separate measurements 
for all babies, in this placebo-controlled study, the Doppler 
measurements were very unlikely to be systematically 
biased. At present, we cannot offer a plausible 
pathophysiological explanation for the possible adverse 
effect of sildenafil on the fetal blood flow in our cohort.
Our findings are in contrast with animal and several 
previously reported clinical studies.17–20,23–29 The sildenafil 
dose used in our study was based on the consensus from 
researchers with most experience in clinical evaluation of 
sildenafil in pregnancy at the time18,21 and a higher dose 
could possibly have been more effective. A systematic 
review34 identified 16 studies of sildenafil in human 
pregnancies, of which only four exceeded our daily dose of 
75 mg in three divided doses. Three reports17,19,20 of 
improved uteroplacental perfusion in fetal growth 
restriction pregnancies used a 50 mg dose once daily and 
recruited women at later gestations with umbilical 
end-diastolic flow present in most cases. As pharma-
cokinetic studies of sildenafil in pregnancy are not 
available, it would be difficult to determine an ideal dosing 
schedule for future studies. More importantly, a possibility 
that the 25 mg dose three times daily might have a 
deleterious effect on blood flow in the ductus venosus 
would require extreme caution in any future studies with 
a higher dose, particularly in fetuses with absent or 
reversed end-diastolic flow in the umbilical artery.
Another possibility is that our definition of growth 
restriction included fetuses with such advanced disease 
that it was not possible to improve or reverse the process. 
We recruited more than half of the fetal growth-restricted 
babies before 26 weeks’ gestation and all fetuses had 
severely compromised umbilical circulation with absent 
or reversed end-diastolic flow; overall mortality was 
around 45%. In comparison, the average gestational age 
at randomisation in the study17 by Dastjerdi and 
colleagues was 35 weeks. The authors did not report the 
proportion of babies with absent or reversed umbilical 
artery food flow, but given the reported gestation, these 
babies would have been likely to have been delivered 
rather than recruited.17 El-Sayed and colleagues19 reported 
that only 11 (20%) of 54 babies developed absent or 
reversed end-diastolic umbilical artery blood flow at 
some point after randomisation, whereas in the study20 
by Trapani Jr and colleagues, reversed umbilical artery 
blood flow was, in fact, an exclusion criterion. None of 
the studies reported any perinatal deaths or long-term 
follow-up data and it is, therefore, far too early to 
speculate 
that 
the 
reported 
improvements 
in 
uteroplacental perfusion in less severe fetal growth 
restriction at later gestation would lead to improved 
survival and better long-term outcomes.
Although we had no firmly agreed fetal monitoring 
protocol 
or 
uniform 
triggers 
for 
delivery 
of 
compromised babies in our study, all participating 
units had access to fetal medicine experts, detailed 
Doppler assessment of fetal and uteroplacental 
circulation and antenatal cardiotocography. Therefore, 
the broad agreement of overall survival in our study 
with other studies1,11 that included severe early-onset 
fetal growth restriction with abnormal umbilical artery 
Doppler is not suprising. We have already started 
long-term follow-up for infants who survived and plan 
to combine our data in a prospective individual patient 
data meta-analysis to look for any possible long-term 
effect of sildenafil, particularly on neurodevelopmental 
and cardiovascular outcomes.30
The absence of substantial changes in angiogenic 
biomarkers in the interval between randomisation and 
delivery and between the two trial groups is disappointing 
and consistent with clinical results. However, angiogenic 
markers might improve the prediction of favourable 
short-term and long-term outcomes and this improve-
ment is an area that we aim to explore further.
In summary, when sildenafil was administered to 
pregnant women with a severely growth-restricted fetus, it 
did not prolong pregnancy, improve survival, or reduce 
short-term neonatal morbidity.
