Wearable contact lenses which can monitor physiological parameters have attracted sub-
stantial interests due to the capability of direct detection of biomarkers contained in body
fluids. However, previously reported contact lens sensors can only monitor a single analyte at
a time. Furthermore, such ocular contact lenses generally obstruct the field of vision of the
subject. Here, we developed a multifunctional contact lens sensor that alleviates some of
these limitations since it was developed on an actual ocular contact lens. It was also designed
to monitor glucose within tears, as well as intraocular pressure using the resistance and
capacitance of the electronic device. Furthermore, in-vivo and in-vitro tests using a live rabbit
and bovine eyeball demonstrated its reliable operation. Our developed contact lens sensor
can measure the glucose level in tear fluid and intraocular pressure simultaneously but yet
independently based on different electrical responses.

earable electronics are designed to be worn on a
person to continuously and intimately monitor an
individual’s activities, without interrupting or limiting
the user’s motions1–8. Especially, wearable electronics detecting
physiological changes for the diagnosis of diseases have recently
attracted extensive interests globally9–13. Contact lenses, currently
worn mainly for vision correction and cosmetic reasons, make
continuous contact with our tear fluids and thus provide a unique
wearable platform for ocular diagnostics. Electronics on soft
contact lenses pose demanding challenges because the system
requires
reliability
upon
repeated
eye-blinks,
flexibility,
stretchability and optical transparency for unobstructed vision.
Even the most advanced contact lens sensors, however, rely on
opaque electronic components constructed on lens-shaped plastic
substrates with low oxygen permeability, instead of on actual soft
hydrogel lenses, which can limit the safe operation of the devices
on a live eye14–18, as summarized in Supplementary Table 1.
Therefore, to overcome these problems and produce a wearable
sensor, the substrate should be commercialized contact lens that
can be wearing and the materials constituting the sensor and
antenna must be transparent, stretchable and harmless to human
body.
Among various biomarkers, glucose is particularly important
for the diagnosis and management of diabetes. Currently, the
finger prick method is commonly used daily by diabetes patients
for monitoring the glucose level in blood, but the method
accompanies pain and inconvenience during sampling19. Instead
of detecting the glucose in blood, monitoring the glucose level in
other body fluids (for example, urine, saliva, intestinal fluid or
tear fluid) may enable noninvasive diagnosis and diabetes
control20. Tear fluid, in particular, has emerged as a promising
body fluid for continuous monitoring of glucose level by recently
developed sensor designs21. Another significant health indicator
that can be obtained from human eyes is the intraocular pressure.
Elevated intraocular pressure is the largest risk factor for
glaucoma17,22–24,
a
leading
cause
of
human
blindness.
Therefore,
early
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
glaucoma
is
important, which is however challenging due to the slow and
symptomless progression of the disease.
Here, we report transparent and stretchable, multifunctional
sensors on wearable soft contact lenses for the wireless detection
of glucose and intraocular pressure with high-sensitivity. The key
components are graphene and its hybrid with metal nanowires,
providing sufficient transparency (491%) and stretchability
(B25%) that ensure reliability, comfort and unobstructed vision
when the soft contact lens is worn by users. By integrating the
components into a resistance (R), inductance (L) and capacitance
(C) circuit operating at a radio frequency, we demonstrate real-
time in-vivo glucose detection on a rabbit eye and in-vitro
monitoring of intraocular pressure of a bovine eyeball wirelessly.
Power sources, associated circuitry and interconnect electrodes
thus are not required in this system. By multiplexing various
sensing elements, the contact lens sensors would ultimately
enable wireless, continuous and noninvasive monitoring of
physiological conditions, as well as the detection of biomarkers
associated with ocular and other diseases.
Results
Fabrication and characteristics of sensors. Schematic image of
the all-in-one multifunctional sensor composed of a field-effect
sensor and antenna on a soft contact lens is given in Fig. 1a.
Materials for biosensors operating on soft contact lenses require
transparency and stretchability, as well as reliability upon repe-
ated
bending
and
stretching.
Candidates
satisfying
these
requirements
include
graphene25–28,
carbon
nanotubes
(CNTs)29,30,
metal
nanowires
(mNWs)29,31,
metal
mesh-
structures32,33,
conducting
polymers34–36
and
their
hybrid
structures37–39. In particular, we previously reported that the
graphene-silver nanowire (AgNW) hybrid structure has enhanced
electrical
and
mechanical
properties
without
sacrificing
transparency, and is thus suitable as stretchable, transparent
electrodes37. Here we further verify its reliability by building fully
functional integrations of the sensors with circuits on wearable,
soft contact lenses using this hybrid (Fig. 1a). The graphene-
AgNWs hybrid formed by transferring graphene onto random
networks of AgNW (Supplementary Fig. 1). As shown in the
picture of the system (Fig. 1b), all the device’s components are
transparent, with slightly visible spiral antenna (inset). Compared
to the single material of graphene or AgNW, the hybrid has
significantly reduced sheet resistance (Supplementary Fig. 2) with
slightly lower optical transmittance and haziness (Fig. 1c).
Furthermore the negligible transconductance of this hybrid
structure37 enables its use as electrodes to build passive
electronic components. For example, the hybrid can serve as
stretchable and transparent source/drain (S/D) electrodes of a
field-effect transistor (FET) with graphene as a channel. This
graphene FET (with the hybrid S/D) which are formed on a Si
wafer with a 300 nm-thick SiO2 layer shows semi-metallic
characteristics with a mobility ofB2,850 cm2 V � 1 s � 1 and
Dirac
voltage
of
30 V
(Supplementary
Fig.
3).
Electrical
properties of the device in response to mechanical strain are
further investigated for reliable operation on soft contact lenses40.
The devices on the plastic substrate such as polyethylene
terephthalate and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) were bent on
cylindrical supports with various radii of curvature, completely
folded inducing a crease or stretched up to 25% of uniaxial tensile
strain (Supplementary Fig. 4). The resulting increase of resistance
was negligible (o10%) due to the large elasticity of graphene41
and the mesh structure of AgNW (ref. 31) (Fig. 1d and e).
Resistance of the hybrid remains almost constant (DRo6%) even
after 5,000 cycles of stretching (25% tensile strain) and relaxation,
while the value increased to 20% at 10,000 cycles (Fig. 1f). These
results suggest that the graphene-AgNW hybrid is a promising
component of wearable electronics on soft contact lenses.
Real-time detection of glucose using graphene sensors. Among
numerous biomolecules included in tear fluid, glucose is an
important biomarker for the diagnosis of diabetes. However, the
current finger prick method for monitoring the glucose level in
blood accompanies pain during blood sampling19. Furthermore,
it provides only a temporary glucose value, even though
continuous
monitoring
is
essential
to
make
an
accurate
diagnosis. Glucose sensors based on the FET that consists of
the graphene channel and hybrid S/D can potentially serve as a
pain-free and convenient alternative to the existing approach,
especially when integrated onto a wearable contact lens. For
selective and sensitive detection of glucose, glucose oxidase
(GOD, b-D-glucose from Aspergillus niger)42,43 was immobilized
on the graphene channel using a pyrene linker via p–p stacking.
Here GOD was attached to the pyrene linker by the amide bond
from
nucleophilic
substitution
of
N-hydroxysuccinimide42
(Supplementary
Fig.
5).
Atomic

microscopy
(AFM)
images confirm that the GOD selectively binds to the surface of
graphene channel as described in Supplementary Fig. 6. The
detection mechanism of glucose is illustrated in Fig. 2a. GOD
catalyses oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid and reduction of
water to hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide, a reducing agent
in our system, is oxidized to produce oxygen, protons and
electrons. The concentration of charge carriers in the channel,
and thus the drain current, increases at higher concentration of

 glucose18,44. As illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 7, we fabricated
a block array of 9 FET sensors consisting of graphene for the
channel and the hybrid for S/D electrodes and interconnects. The
hybrid electrodes and interconnects were passivated with a
500 nm-thick epoxy layer (SU8, Microchem, Inc), except the
square-shaped areas which were used for exposing the graphene
channels. Here the SU8 as a diffusive barrier lowers molecular
concentrations at the already impermeable graphene surface38,
ensuring that no damaging molecule from tear fluid reaches the
AgNWs. Grain boundaries in graphene may lower effectiveness of
the seal, in particular when the lens is worn for extended periods
of time, but the two-layer passivation can provide reasonable
protection of the sensor against tear fluids for daily disposable
contact lenses. The formation of AgCl, insoluble salts which could
be harmful to the human eye, is also prevented by protecting
AgNWs from tear fluid which contains chloride ions. Transfer
characteristics under various glucose concentrations are given in
Fig. 2b. Compared to the buffer-only case (black curve), the drain
current increases with glucose concentration due to the positive
charge transfer effect of protons (H þ) generated from the
oxidation
of
hydrogen
peroxide.
Based
on
the
transfer
characteristic, the drain current under glucose concentrations
from 1 mM to 10 mM was measured in real-time at zero gate bias
(VG ¼ 0 V) (Fig. 2c). The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) measured at
1 mM was about 7.34, and the limit of detection at S/N of 3 was
0.4 mM. The device detected glucose concentration of as low as
1 mM, indicating a 10 times improvement over previously
reported
contact
lens
sensors
made
by
evaporated
metal
electrodes18. As shown in the calibration curve (Fig. 2d), the
sensor was also highly responsive to the typical range of glucose
concentrations in tear fluid (0.1–0.6 mM)18. Repeating the
measurements in artificial tear fluids slightly increased the
baseline
current
but
did
not
degrade
the
sensitivity
(Supplementary Fig. 8). The results confirm that our glucose
sensor operates even in the presence of ions and other interfering
molecules in tears. We investigated the long-term stability of our
sensors with application in a real contact lens in mind. We stored
unused sensors in artificial tear solution for up to 24 h, and tested
their
responses
to
glucose
at
varied
concentrations
(Supplementary Fig. 9). No degradation of the sensitivity after
24 h suggests that the enzymes remain active for at least 24 h. The
simple
pyrene-chemistry
tunes
the
molecular
binding
on
graphene, and accordingly the multiplexed array of graphene
sensors would enable detection of numerous disease-related
biomarkers in tear fluid. Although precise diagnosis of glucose
may require further development of the sensor, the contact lens
sensor can be sufficient for screening prediabetes and daily
monitoring of the glucose level.
In-vivo test of wireless monitoring of glucose. In addition to the
transparency and stretchability discussed above, the contact-lens
device should also have a high-oxygen and water permeability to
be compatible with the wearable soft contact lens, instead of lens-
shaped polyethylene terephthalate or PDMS substrates14–18.
Furthermore, since connecting wires to the lens device is not
practical, both powering the device and recording the sensor
response should be performed wirelessly45. Figure 3a illustrates a
schematic diagram of the device attached to a soft contact lens in
which the graphene-AgNW electrodes and the graphene channel
are lithographically patterned on an ultra-thin parylene substrate
(B500 nm-thick). Parylene was chosen as substrates instead of
other plastic materials due to its intraocular biocompatibility and
mechanical superiority such as strength and stretchability46. Also,
high transparency and conformal pinhole-free deposition make it
an ideal substrate for electrical components on the contact lens.
All the components of the device are transparent, with slightly
visible spiral antenna, and conformably wrap the curved surface
of the contact lens (radius of curvature B1.4 cm, thickness
B85 mm). The sensor can be modelled as an electrical RLC
resonant circuit, comprised of the resistance (R) of the graphene
channel, the inductance (L) of the antenna coil made of the
graphene-AgNW hybrid and the capacitance (C) of graphene-
AgNW hybrid S/D electrodes. A wireless operation can be
achieved by mutually coupling the sensor with an external
antenna, as described in Fig. 3b. These circuits are connected via a
magnetic field, which can be characterized by a coupling
coefficient47,48. Therefore, the wireless sensing antenna analyses
how the reflection condition depends on the resistivity change of
the sensor. At varied glucose concentrations, a reflection value
(S11) of the wireless sensor was measured at the resonant
frequency of 4.1 GHz (Fig. 3c). The reflection was enlarged at
higher glucose concentrations, caused by reduced resistance of the
graphene upon glucose binding (Fig. 3c; Supplementary Fig. 10).
The sensor responds specifically to glucose even in the presence
of interferents (50 mM of ascorbic acid, 10 mM of lactate and
10 mM of uric acid) in the tear (Supplementary Fig. 11). Also,
these reflection values of the sensor almost accord with the
simulation results (Supplementary Fig. 12; Supplementary text).
Figure 3d shows a live rabbit wearing the contact lens sensor for
an in-vivo recording. For the in-vivo test, we put the contact lens
in the rabbit eye, gave about 3 h for the rabbit to recover from
stress, and fed the rabbit. Considering the delayed increase of the
blood glucose after the food intake, we measured the reflection
(S11) after 5 h of the rabbit wearing the lens, or B2 h after
feeding. The rabbit showed no sign of abnormal behaviour, and
the
sensor
remained
stable
during
repeated
eye-blinks
(Supplementary Movie 1). After 5 h, the contact lens sensor
detected the glucose concentration of the rabbit, and we wirelessly
measured the reflection value of sensors, while the rabbit was
wearing the lens. As shown in Fig. 3e, the device on the contact
lens still functioned and showed a higher reflection than the value
before wearing, presumably because of the glucose binding in tear
fluid of the rabbit. Our sensing platform integrated onto the
contact lens enables wireless and real-time monitoring of the
glucose level in the tear fluid, a technology that potentially
replaces the current finger prick method.
In-vitro test of wireless monitoring of intraocular pressure.
Utilizing the inductance (L) and capacitance (C) in the RLC
circuit adds another mode of detection to the resistance-based
glucose sensor discussed above. Here we demonstrate wireless
recording of intraocular pressure using the contact lens sensor.
Intraocular pressure is the main factor in the pathogenesis of
glaucoma17, which eventually leads to the loss of vision. Although
the intraocular pressure peak occurs at night rather than daytime,
it is frequently measured when patients visit the hospital during
daytime due to the time and place limitations, which therefore
accompanies possibility of misdiagnosis. Beyond this limitation,
in order to continuously measure the intraocular pressure for
24 h, a wearable and transparent intraocular pressure monitoring
sensor on a soft contact lens may be one feasible solution. To
monitor intraocular pressure, we placed a layer of silicone
elastomer (ecoflex) between the two inductive spirals made of
graphene-AgNW hybrid electrodes in a sandwich structure.
Figure 4a illustrates how the contact lens sensor responds to a
raised intraocular pressure, termed ocular hypertension. High-
intraocular pressure increases the corneal radius of curvature,
which in turn increases both the capacitance by thinning the
dielectric and the inductance by bi-axial lateral expansion of the
spiral coils. As a result, ocular hypertension shifts the reflection

 spectra of the spiral antenna to a lower frequency10. For in-situ
wireless intraocular pressure sensing, the external reader coil was
aligned over the contact lens sensor along the same axis (Fig. 4b).
The readout system was able to detect the resonance frequency,
fsensor, a function of inductance and capacitance as described in
the Methods section10,17. The contact lens sensor was tested in-
vitro on a bovine eyeball because of its structural resemblance to
the human eyeball. As presented in Fig. 4c, the sensor on the
bovine or mannequin eye has sufficient transparency without
obstructing the field of vision. Figure 4d shows the reflection
spectra wirelessly collected from the contact lens sensor worn by
the bovine eyeball. The value for fsensor down-shifted at higher
intraocular pressure, caused by the raised inductance and
capacitance as described above. Here the resonance frequency
of the sensor is inversely proportional to the square root of
pressure, fsensorBP � 0.5, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 13. In
this graph, the frequency response is almost linear for relatively
small pressure (below 50 mm Hg). In the physiologically relevant
range of intraocular pressure, 5–50 mm Hg (ref. 17), the fsensor
decreased
linearly
with
pressure
by
the
slope
of
2.64 MHz mm Hg � 1 (Fig. 4e). Also Supplementary Fig. 14
shows a linear relationship of the relative capacitance change by
pressure for this intraocular pressure range (CBP). As shown in
Fig. 4f, the frequency response to intraocular pressure is
reproducible with negligible hysteresis. Measured pressures were
highly correlated with the real intraocular pressures, which were
examined by a pressure sensor inserted into the eyeball. The
frequency responses were consistent even when the device slipped
to different locations on the eyeball (Supplementary Fig. 15). This
is because of the layer that prevents the active components of the
device from making direct contact with the eyeball. As the two
sensing modes in principle operate independently of each other,
the sensors can be potentially multiplexed for simultaneous
detection of glucose and intraocular pressure. This wearable
smart contact lens will be a promising application in wireless and
real-time ocular diagnostics without obstruction to vision.
Discussion
We have demonstrated a wearable smart contact lens with
highly transparent and stretchable sensors that continuously
and wirelessly monitors glucose and intraocular pressure, which
are the risk factors associated with diabetes and glaucoma,
respectively.
In conclusion, compared to the existing contact lens sensors
made of conventional opaque materials, the breakthrough was
made by the hybrid structure of 1D and 2D nanomaterials,
which adds reliability and robustness to the high conductivity,
flexibility and transparency of each material. Among the three
elements in the demonstrated RLC circuit, R responds to
molecular binding, whereas L and C vary with structural
changes of the device, thus enabling the detection of intraocular
pressure. Here, the simple pyrene-chemistry allows selective
binding of target biomarkers onto graphene, which can be
tuned for a wide range of analytes. Furthermore, the change of
reflection coefficient by R, and the shift of resonance frequency
by L and C operates independently of each other. Therefore,
this multiplexed contact lens sensor indicates substantial
promise for next-generation ocular diagnostics, which not only
monitors disease-related biomarkers but also evaluates ocular
and overall health conditions of our body.
Methods
Preparation of AgNW films. AgNWs (Nanopyxis Co. Ltd,) with average diameter
of 30 (±5) nm and length of 25 (±5) mm were dispersed in deionized water
(3 mg ml � 1). The dispersion was spin-coated on a target substrate for 30 s at
500 r.p.m. to get the lowest sheet resistance. The substrate was then annealed at
150 �C for 90 s to completely evaporate the water.

 CVD synthesis and transfer of graphene. A Cu foil (Alfa Aeasr, item No.: 13382)
cleaned using acetone, IPA and deionized (DI) water was loaded into the CVD
chamber. After pumping the chamber down to 10 mtorr, the furnace was heated up
to 1,000 �C under 200 s.c.c.m. Ar and 500 s.c.c.m. H2. Graphene synthesis was
carried out for 5 min under 12 s.c.c.m. of CH4 and 500 s.c.c.m. of H2. Then the
chamber was cooled down to room temperature with Ar flowing at 500 s.c.c.m. To
transfer the synthesized graphene onto a target substrate poly (methyl methacry-
late) (MicroChem Corp., 950 PMMA) was spin-coated on the graphene-on-Cu foil.
Floating the foil on a diluted etchant (FeCl3: HCl: H2 ¼ 1:1:20 vol%) completely
removed the foil, and a layer of PMMA-coated graphene remained. After rinsing
the graphene-PMMA with DI water, the layer was transferred onto a target sub-
strate, followed by removal of PMMA by acetone.
Fabrication of field-effect transistors. Photoresist was patterned on spin-coating
AgNW films, and AgNW electrodes were made by removing the unprotected
AgNW films via both dry-etching using oxygen plasma in reactive ion etching
(RIE) (50 W, 60 s.c.c.m., 240 s) and wet-etching using H3PO4: C2H4O2:
C6H4NO5SNa: H2O (55:1:4:40 vol%) for 10 s. After removing the PR in acetone,
graphene was transferred onto the AgNW electrodes and patterned by photo-
lithography and RIE for the hybrid electrodes and channel. The width and length of
the channel were 5 and 50 mm, respectively.
Electrical characterization. We used a probe station (Keithley 4200-SCS semi-
conductor parametric analyser) to measure sheet resistance, and transfer and
output characteristics of devices (back- and solution- gated characterizations). In
solution-gated characterization, we used Ag/AgCl wire as a reference electrode. All
devices were characterized at 0.1 V of drain bias.
Optical characterization. Optical transmittance measurements were conducted
by ultraviolet–vis-NIR spectroscopy (Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR, Agilent) with the
transmittance of the substrate subtracted. Electron micrographs of our samples
were obtained with scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi, S-4800).
Immobilization of glucose oxidase. The sensor was immersed in 1 mgml� 1
solution of 1-pyrenebutanoic acid, succinimidyl ester (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in
methanol for 2 h at room temperature and further cleaned with methanol. The sensor
was then placed in 10mgml� 1 GOD (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in deionized water for
18 h at room temperature, rinsed with DI water and dried with nitrogen gas.
Microfluidic platform for real-time glucose sensing. Field-effect transistor
(FET)-type sensor was fabricated using graphene-AgNW hybrid as S/D electrodes,
graphene as an active channel layer, Cr/Au as interconnect and SU8 as a passi-
vation layer. This passivation layer was a square of side 40 mm. A 5 mm- thick
PDMS block (Sylgard 184 silicone elastomer: curing agent ¼ 10:1 wt%), which
contains a micro-fluidic channel, was punched out for the inlet, outlet and gate
terminal, and then Ag/AgCl wire as a reference electrode was inserted into the
channel. After that, the PDMS block was physically fixed on the sensor. A buffer
solution (Samchun Pure Chemical Co., pH 7.00±0.02) containing glucose at
various concentrations was passed through the microfluidic channel at a constant
rate (1 ml h � 1) with a syringe pump (New Era Pump Systems, Inc., NE-300). The
sensor was characterized with a semiconductor parameter analyser (Keithley 4200-
SCS). For real-time sensing the drain current was recorded versus time at fixed
drain voltage (VD) of 0.1 V and gate voltage (VG) of 0 V.
Fabrication of intraocular pressure sensor. A Cu foil was coated with parylene
(B500 nm-thick) using a parylene coater (Alpha plus). AgNW suspension was

 spin-coated and annealed on the parylene substrate, and AgNW spiral coil was
patterned by conventional etch-back process using photo-resist and reactive ion
etching process. Then Ecoflex (Smooth-On Ecoflex 0030) was spin-coated above
the bottom AgNW spiral coil. Afterwards, top AgNW spiral coil was formed by the
same methods as the bottom coil, followed by passivation of the device by another
layer of parylene. The bottom Cu foil was etched by Ni etchant, and the device was
transferred onto a contact lens. Finally, the central area of the sensor was punched
to allow permeation of oxygen and water.
Wireless sensing measurement. The wireless sensor was designed to have an
RLC passive circuit. The helix coils were made of an electrically conducting and
optically transparent graphene-AgNW hybrid including three turn helix in an
outer coil with a width of 500 mm and a single turn helix in an inner coil with a
width of 120 mm. The wireless sensor was tested by a network analyser (Roh-
de&Schwarz, znb 8) at various glucose concentrations from 1 mM to 10 mM and at
intraocular pressures ranging from 5 to 50 mm Hg. A reader antenna was used to
inductively couple and power the remote sensor. The distance between the contact
lens sensors and the reading antenna was 10 mm. The resistance change of gra-
phene in response to glucose causes changes in the reflection value (S11 parameter)
at resonance frequency. The resonance frequency is shifted by the change of
capacitance with the same reflection value by following the equation. By using
the Kirchhoff’s circuit laws, the S11 is related to the channel resistance (Z3) by
equation (1),
S11 ¼

where Mxy, and Zx are the coupling coefficient, and resistance of reader coil (1),
resonate receiver coil (2) and load coil (3), respectively.
The resonance frequency is shifted by the change of capacitance with the same
reflection value by following the equation (2).

Rabbit experiment. For in-vivo glucose sensing we used a male New Zealand
white rabbit. The test was performed according to the guidelines of the National
Institutes of Health for the care and use of laboratory animals, and with the
approval of the Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee of UNIST (UNI-
STIACUC-14-024). Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee of UNIST is
ethics review committee.
Selectivity test. For the selectivity test, the sensor is tested by the solution of
0.1 mM glucose, 50 mM ascorbic acid (Product #PHR1008, Sigma-Aldrich, USA),
10 mM lactate (Product #PHR1113, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 10 mM urea (Pro-
duct #PHR1406, Sigma-Aldrich, USA).
Bovine eyeball experiment. The in-vitro test was performed using the bovine
eyeball. The intraocular pressure of the eyeball was measured by a pressure sensor
(Testo 511) inserted into the eye chamber, and also controlled by a syringe pump
with a needle inserted into the eyeball. The change of resonance frequency was
characterized wirelessly using the network analyser (Rohde&Schwarz, znb 8).
