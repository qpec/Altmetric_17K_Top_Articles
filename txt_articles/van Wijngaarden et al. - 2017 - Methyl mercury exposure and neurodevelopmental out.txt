Abstract
Background—All fish contain methyl mercury (MeHg), a known neurotoxicant at adequate 
dosage. There is still substantial scientific uncertainty about the consequences, if any, of mothers 
consuming fish with naturally-acquired levels of MeHg contamination. In 1989-1990, we recruited 
the Main Cohort of the Seychelles Child Development Study to assess the potential developmental 
effects of prenatal MeHg exposure. We report here on associations with neurodevelopmental 
outcomes obtained at 22 and 24 years of age.
Methods—Neurodevelopmental tests at 22 years included the Boston Naming Test, Cambridge 
Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), and the Profile of Mood States. At 24 
years, we administered the Stroop Word-Color Test, the Barkley Adult ADHD Rating Scale, the 
Test of Variables of Attention, and the Finger Tapping test. We also administered a healthy 
behaviors survey at both ages. Primary analyses examined covariate-adjusted associations in 
multiple linear regression models with prenatal MeHg exposure. In secondary analyses we also 
examined associations with recent postnatal MeHg exposure.
Results—We did not observe adverse associations between prenatal MeHg exposure and any of 
the measured endpoints. Some measures of attention, executive function, and delayed recall 
showed improved performance with increasing exposure. Secondary analysis did not show 
consistent patterns of association with postnatal exposure.
Conclusions—Our cohort has been examined at ten different ages over 24 years of follow-up. 
Findings suggest that prenatal and recent postnatal MeHg exposure from ocean fish consumption

 is not adversely associated with neurobehavioral development at levels that are about ten times 
higher than typical U.S. exposures.
1. Introduction
All fish contain a small amount of methyl mercury (MeHg) that is naturally present in the 
environment. MeHg is a known neurotoxicant in adequate dosage and has been associated 
with severe neurological deficits in children exposed prenatally when their mothers 
consumed heavily contaminated seafood or seed grain (WHO, 1990). Fish also contain 
nutrients that are essential for maternal and fetal health and are the primary source of 
preformed docosahexanonic acid (DHA), a major lipid in the brain. DHA is essential for 
normal brain development and function and the human body has a limited capacity to 
synthesize it from precursor lipids (Kuratko et al., 2013).
There is still substantial scientific uncertainty about the consequences, if any, of mothers or 
children consuming fish with naturally-acquired MeHg contamination. In 2004 the EPA and 
the FDA jointly issued fish consumption guidelines for women on the possibility of adverse 
health consequences for the developing fetus (EPA/FDA, 2004). These guidelines were 
based on studies in the Faroe Islands and New Zealand that reported some adverse 
associations between prenatal MeHg exposure and developmental outcomes (Crump et al., 
1998; Grandjean et al., 1997). However, evidence from studies of populations consuming 
only fish with naturally-occurring MeHg contamination and not sea mammals does not 
support those conclusions. Our studies in the Republic of Seychelles (Davidson et al., 1998; 
van Wijngaarden et al., 2013b) and those of others in the UK and Spain (Daniels et al., 2004; 
Llop et al., 2012) have found no consistent evidence of adverse consequences on children’s 
development associated with prenatal MeHg exposure. Recent advisories from U.S. and 
international agencies have encouraged fish consumption by women of childbearing age 
based on the beneficial nutrients present in fish and their known association with improved 
child development (EPA/FDA, 2014; FAO/WHO, 2011).
While regulatory fish consumption guidelines in the U.S. have also addressed fish intake in 
children, they are based on the same assumptions as guidelines for women of childbearing 
age. There are no studies that have been designed specifically to evaluate postnatal MeHg 
exposure in children, but a number of studies have included a biomarker of postnatal 
exposure in their analyses. Associations of increasing exposure with developmental 
outcomes have been inconsistent with some studies reporting worse performance (Freire et 
al., 2010; Hsi et al., 2014; Myers et al., 2009; van Wijngaarden et al., 2013b), some 
reporting better performance (Davidson et al., 1998), and others reporting no associations 
(Cao et al., 2010; Deroma et al., 2013).
Brain maturation develops throughout childhood and well into adolescence and young 
adulthood. Associations may not become apparent until the children mature or reported 
associations at early ages may not be present at older ages. Therefore, longitudinal studies 
are essential to determine if there are long-term consequences of prenatal or postnatal 
exposure. The Seychelles Child Development Study (SCDS) was designed specifically to 
address the question of whether MeHg exposure from fish consumption during pregnancy is

 related to children’s development. It is a prospective, longitudinal observational study in the 
Republic of Seychelles where fish consumption is daily, maternal MeHg exposure is about 
10 times that in the US, and MeHg contamination in fish is from natural background levels. 
Levels of MeHg in fish consumed in Seychelles are similar to those found in ocean fish in 
the U.S. (unpublished data). Marine mammals, which can contain polychlorinated biphenyls 
(PCBs), other toxicants, and much higher MeHg concentrations than fish, are not consumed 
in the Seychelles. Environmental assessments have indicated relatively low exposure levels 
to other pollutants and contaminants in Seychelles, such as lead, PCBs, and pesticides 
(Shamlaye et al., 2004).
We recruited participants in the Main Cohort of the Seychelles Child Development Study in 
1989-1990 to study the potential developmental effects of prenatal MeHg exposure, and 
have evaluated them 10 times during 24 years of follow up. Throughout 19 years of follow 
up, we have found no consistent evidence for adverse associations with prenatal exposure. 
However, in secondary analyses we have found some adverse associations with a measure of 
concurrent postnatal exposure (Davidson et al., 2011; Myers et al., 2003; Myers et al., 2009; 
van Wijngaarden et al., 2013b). We report here on associations of prenatal and recent 
postnatal MeHg exposure with developmental outcomes at 22 and 24 years of age.
2. Methods
2.1 Study Population
In 1989-1990, the Main cohort of 779 mother and their children were enrolled at 6 months 
(+/- 2 weeks) postpartum from among the women who had, during or after their pregnancy, 
agreed to give a hair sample. Participants were excluded if there was inadequate maternal 
hair to recapitulate prenatal MeHg exposure, were twins, or had illnesses or injuries known 
to adversely affect neurodevelopment (e.g. prematurity, severe perinatal illness, closed head 
trauma with loss of consciousness, encephalitis, and meningitis). There were 740 children 
eligible for further study. Cohort children were previously evaluated at 19, 29, 66, and 107 
months of age, and at 10.5, 17, and 19 years of age (van Wijngaarden et al., 2013b). All 
study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of 
Rochester and the Research Review Board of the Republic of Seychelles.
2.2 Neurodevelopmental and Behavioral Assessment
Our neurodevelopmental and behavioral battery at 22 years assessed specific and subtle 
developmental and learning behaviors that are part of more global developmental functions, 
such as intelligence, cognition, memory, language ability, fine motor coordination, and 
emotional and social adjustment. Neurodevelopmental tests at 22 years included the Boston 
Naming Test (BNT) which measures language and executive functioning (Kaplan et al., 
2001); the Profile of Mood States: Bipolar Version (POMS-Bi) which assesses mood and 
feeling including both positive and negative affect (Lorr et al., 1982); and a confidential 
healthy behaviors (HB) questionnaire adapted specifically for the Seychellois culture with 
items from the WHO global school-based student health survey and the US Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention Youth Risk Behavior Survey. (Davidson et al., 2011). We 
also administered the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) 
van Wijngaarden et al.

 which is sensitive and specific for detection of subtle deficits in all components of complex 
cognitive function (Ismatulina et al., 2014). The administered battery included Reaction 
Time (RT), a measure of attention; Intra-/Extra Dimensional shift set (IED), a measure of 
executive function; Paired Associates Learning (PAL), a measure of executive function; 
Delayed Match to Sample (DMS), a short-term memory task; Rapid Visual Information 
Processing (RVP), a measure of memory function during performance of executive task; 
Spatial Working Memory (SWM), a short-term memory task; and Stockings of Cambridge 
(SOC), a measure of executive function. Participants who were colorblind did not complete 
the CANTAB assessment.
At 24 years of age, we focused on measures of attention to follow up on reports that prenatal 
Hg exposure may be associated with attention deficit disorder-related behavior (Sagiv et al., 
2012; Yoshimasu et al., 2014). Accordingly, the 24-year battery included the Stroop Word-
Color Test (for participants who were not colorblind), a measure of directed attention 
(Homack and Riccio, 2004); and the Barkley Adult ADHD Rating Scale IV (BAARS-IV) 
which assesses current and childhood ADHD symptoms and was administered in either 
English or Creole based on participant preference (Barkley, 2011). If BAARS-IV data were 
missing on one item of the full scale, a value of 1 (never or rarely) was imputed; if data on 
more than 1 item were missing the BAARS-IV test was considered invalid. We also 
administered both the auditory and visual components of the Test of Variables of Attention 
(TOVA) which is a non-language-based computerized and standardized continuous 
performance test (measuring attention and impulsivity). Outcome measures included are D 
Prime (d’), mean response time (milliseconds), response time variability (milliseconds), 
omission errors (%), and commission errors (%). (Greenberg and Waldman, 1993). Finally, 
we administered the Finger Tapping test (FT) for dominant and non-dominant hand as a 
measure of subtle motor and cognitive impairment (Schatz, 2011), and repeated the HB 
survey with the exception of questions on injury risk to reduce the length of the 
questionnaire and overall test battery.
Tables 1 (22-year battery) and 2 (24-year battery) indicate whether higher or lower test 
scores are indicative of better performance. Training procedures and reliability checks 
followed standard SCDS protocols. Participants and evaluators were blinded to pre- and 
postnatal MeHg concentrations and evaluators were specifically trained on the administered 
tests (Davidson et al., 1995).
2.3 Exposure Measures
Prenatal exposure to MeHg was determined by measuring total maternal hair Hg in the 
sample that best recapitulated growth during pregnancy using cold vapor atomic absorption 
spectroscopy with previously-described quality control procedures (Cernichiari et al., 1995). 
Over 80% of Hg in hair is known to be organic. We assumed a hair growth rate of 1.1 cm per 
month and a delay of 20 days between current blood concentrations and appearance of Hg in 
the first centimeter of scalp hair (Cernichiari et al., 1995). Recent postnatal MeHg exposure 
at 22 and 24 years of age was measured using the same approach in a 1 cm length of each 
participant’s hair closest to the scalp taken at the time of testing.

 2.4 Covariates
In addition to pre- and postnatal Hg, covariates were chosen to be consistent with analyses 
of the same or similar outcomes in this cohort at previous ages (Davidson et al., 2011; 
Davidson et al., 1998; van Wijngaarden et al., 2013b) and included child sex, socioeconomic 
status, maternal and child IQ, and life course stress. As in previous recent analyses of this 
cohort (Davidson et al., 2011; van Wijngaarden et al., 2013b), child sex was a covariate for 
all outcomes and socioeconomic status (SES) at 9 years of age was included as a covariate 
for all outcomes except POMS because the association between SES and measures of 
positive and negative affect, especially as measured by POMS, is currently not clear (Chiang 
et al., 2015). We operationalized SES through the use of the Hollingshead Social Status 
Index modified for use in the Seychelles (Davidson et al., 1998; Hollingshead, 1975). The 
Hollingshead Index is a measure of social status based on educational attainment (seven 
codes; no education to postgraduate) and occupational prestige (nine codes; menial service 
to higher executive). Higher codes indicate higher educational attainment or higher 
occupational status. We combined occupational and educational codes through a weighted 
formula into a continuous score (Hollingshead, 1975). Maternal IQ, determined by the 
Matrices subtest of the K-BIT given to mothers at the child’s 10-year evaluation, was 
included in CANTAB and Finger Tapping analyses as a continuous variable (Davidson et al., 
2011; van Wijngaarden et al., 2013b). Child full scale IQ as measured by the Wechsler 
Intelligence Scale-III at 9 years of age was a covariate for HB outcomes and for attention 
outcomes at 24 years (Davidson et al., 2011; Weyandt et al., 2002). Life course stress up to 
22 years of age was included as a covariate for POMS outcomes and was defined here as the 
sum of significant life events (separations or divorces, death of someone close to the subject, 
severe illness in the immediate family, and household disasters) throughout the duration of 
follow up reported by the mother up to 17 years of age, which was subsequently updated 
with information provided by the participant (19 years and older) at the time of 
developmental testing at 19 and 22 years of age (van Wijngaarden et al., 2013b). At each 
follow up period, we inquired about new events since the last time the participant was tested 
in order to not double-count events.
2.5 Statistical Analysis
Descriptive analyses of endpoints, primary predictors and covariates were conducted on non-
excluded subjects with data on at least one outcome separate for the 22- (n=571) and 24-year 
(n=577) assessments. The mean, median and standard deviation for continuous measures, 
and proportions for nominal and ordinal variables were computed.
A priori multivariable regression models tested the associations between endpoints and 
prenatal MeHg exposure. As mentioned above, CANTAB models adjusted for child sex, 
maternal IQ and SES; POMS models adjusted for child sex and lifecourse stress; BNT 
models adjusted for child sex and SES; and all remaining models adjusted for child sex, 
child IQ, and SES. We did not evaluate sex-MeHg interactions because analyses of previous 
developmental evaluations in this cohort have shown no consistent evidence for the presence 
of such interactions (Davidson et al., 2011; Myers et al., 2003; van Wijngaarden et al., 
2013b).

 Prenatal and postnatal exposures were modeled separately. Consistent with recent analyses, 
our primary prenatal exposure models did not include recent postnatal exposure as a 
covariate (van Wijngaarden et al., 2013a). Secondary postnatal models did include prenatal 
exposure as a covariate, and we present prenatal results from both models. A two-tailed 
alpha level of 0.05 was used to determine the significance of independent variable effects.
Regression assumptions were checked for each model. Continuous outcomes were modeled 
with linear regression. For models in which the assumption of normally distributed errors 
with constant variance was violated, the dependent variable was transformed to stabilize the 
variance and produce more normally distributed errors. These transformations consisted of 
either the natural logarithm or the inverse of the outcome variable. Statistical outliers 
(defined as observations with standardized residuals greater than 3 in absolute value) and 
influential points (defined as observations with a Cook’s distance larger than 0.50) were 
identified for each model, and models which contained influential points or extreme outliers 
relative to other observations (such as standardized residuals greater than 4 in absolute 
value) were then run with and without these values. Regression results for two 24-year 
outcomes are presented without one extreme value on the TOVA D-prime visual measure 
and without a different extreme value for the TOVA D-prime auditory measure. After 
outcome transformations (when necessary), there were no other extreme outliers or 
influential points for continuous outcomes. Models for categorical outcomes were 
proportional odds (PO) models; the PO assumption was assessed by visual diagnostics as 
recommended by Harrell (Harrell, 2015). For some outcomes, extreme categories with small 
numbers of participants were collapsed, resulting in fewer categories; results were 
unaffected by this collapsing. After collapsing, when warranted, none of the models showed 
violation of the PO assumption. The beta coefficient in a PO model represents the increase 
in log odds of having a more adverse developmental outcome per unit increase of a predictor 
variable.
3. Results
3.1 Descriptive Analyses
Characteristics of study participants at 22 years (n=571) are presented in Table 1. Slightly 
more than half of the participants were female. The average prenatal MeHg exposure was 
6.8 ppm in maternal hair. Recent postnatal MeHg exposure in the participant’s hair was 
lower with an average of about 5 ppm; exposure was significantly greater for men (6.57 
ppm) than for women (4.05 ppm). Pre- and postnatal exposure was not associated with any 
of the other covariates of interest. The correlation between prenatal exposure and recent 
postnatal exposure was low (r=0.11). Men performed somewhat better on several CANTAB 
measures (e.g. intra-extra dimensional shift, delayed matched to sample, spatial working 
memory) as compared to women. Women less frequently reported substance abuse, 
antisocial behavior and injury problems on the healthy behavior questionnaire but reported 
more mental health problems on this questionnaire as well as on the POMS.
Descriptive statistics of study participants at 24 years (n=577) are presented in Table 2. 
Demographic and exposure characteristics were similar to those at age 22. Recent postnatal 
exposure was again greater for men (6.28 ppm) than for women (3.87 ppm). As at 22 years,

 other covariates were not associated with exposure and the correlation between prenatal and 
recent postnatal exposure was low (r=0.07). Men had worse scores than women on the 
BAARS (total, inattention, and hyperactivity) but scored better on the Finger Tapping test 
and most of the visual and auditory TOVA measures (data not shown). Similar to 22 years, 
women less frequently reported substance abuse and antisocial behavior but reported more 
mental health problems. Data suggest that risky behaviors, in particular substance abuse and 
antisocial behavior, declined between 22 and 24 years of age.
3.2 Regression Analyses
Associations between prenatal and recent postnatal MeHg exposure and cognitive and 
behavioral outcomes at 22 years of age are presented in Tables 3 and 4. Primary regression 
analyses were based on 439 to 560 participants at 22 years and 478 to 521 participants at 24 
years who had complete information on cognitive endpoints and covariates, with the sample 
size varying depending upon the specific outcome measure and relevant covariates. Prenatal 
MeHg exposure was associated with several of the developmental outcomes assessed (5-
choice reaction time, DMS % correct 12 ms delay, and SOC 5-move problem), but all 
regression coefficients indicated improved performance with increasing prenatal exposure. 
Postnatal MeHg exposure was associated with one of 26 outcomes at age 22 years; higher 
hair MeHg levels were associated with worse performance on the IED total errors adjusted 
measure.
24-year associations for outcomes are presented in Table 5. There were no clear patterns of 
association with either prenatal or recent postnatal MeHg. Only the TOVA auditory mean 
response time showed improved performance with increasing prenatal MeHg exposure.
4. Discussion
Prenatal MeHg exposure at ages 22 and 24 years in the SCDS Main Cohort was not 
adversely associated with neuropsychological endpoints in this study. Maternal consumption 
of fish (about 12 fish meals per week) and prenatal MeHg exposure in our cohort is higher 
than in many other epidemiological studies addressing low-level MeHg exposure (Karagas et 
al., 2012). Because our population does not consume sea mammals, co-exposure to PCBs 
and other toxicants is of little concern. Developmental examinations have been extensive and 
have successively increased in sophistication and complexity, and the test battery reported 
here is one of the more detailed and sophisticated evaluations of our cohort to date. After 24 
years of follow up of the SCDS Main cohort, our findings show that prenatal MeHg 
exposure from fish consumption during pregnancy is not adversely associated with 
neurobehavioral outcomes in offspring. These results are consistent with those we reported 
after each of the previous eight evaluations, and the probability that we have missed adverse 
associations in this cohort appear to be increasingly small.
Other studies of large fish consuming mother-child cohorts in the United Kingdom, (Daniels 
et al., 2004) and Spain (Llop et al., 2012) have also reported finding no adverse associations 
between prenatal MeHg exposures and subsequent developmental testing. In contrast, 
studies in the Faroe Islands, New Zealand, and elsewhere have reported finding adverse 
associations at lower levels of exposure than those found in Seychelles (Crump et al., 1998; 
van Wijngaarden et al.

 Grandjean et al., 1997; Oken et al., 2005). In the Faroe Islands study, adverse associations 
were reported at 22 years of age but were smaller than associations reported at younger ages 
(Debes et al., 2016).
The reason for differences in findings is not entirely clear. However, the association between 
MeHg exposure from fish consumption and child developmental outcomes is complex, and 
different findings across studies may be partially explained by variability in the 
developmental test battery and measures of MeHg exposure used. Findings may also be 
inconsistent due to variation in concomitant exposure to other contaminants (e.g. 
polychlorinated biphenyls) and nutrients (e.g. polyunsaturated fatty acids or selenium) in 
fish and other seafood that may influence MeHg associations with developmental outcomes. 
(Strain et al., 2015) Finally, evidence is accumulating that genetics influencing the 
metabolism of MeHg (Julvez et al., 2013) and nutrients (Yeates et al., 2015) in fish may 
result in geographic variability in MeHg associations due to differences in the distribution of 
relevant genes in the different study populations.
Rather than adverse effects of prenatal MeHg exposure, throughout follow up we have 
observed improved performance on some developmental tests with increasing exposure (van 
Wijngaarden et al., 2013b). Our current study continues this pattern with improved 
performance on some CANTAB and TOVA measures, although these beneficial associations 
are relatively few given the large number of outcomes assessed and they span various 
cognitive domains. We have surmised that these associations reflect the presence of possible 
beneficial nutrients also present in fish that confound any MeHg associations. We did not 
measure maternal nutritional status during pregnancy in the current cohort, but we did ask 
the mothers at enrollment 6 months postpartum how many fish meals they consumed per day 
at that time. The response to this question was not correlated with hair MeHg levels covering 
the prenatal period (r=0.05). However, we have investigated this hypothesis with maternal 
biomarkers in two subsequent nutrition cohorts enrolled in 2001 and 2008-2011 (Davidson 
et al., 2008; Strain et al., 2015). Findings from these younger cohorts suggest that nutrients, 
in particular long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), are capable of modifying the 
association between prenatal MeHg and developmental outcomes with possible adverse 
MeHg associations at high n-6/n-3 PUFA status, a marker for a pro-inflammatory milieu. As 
in the Main cohort, however, we have not found consistent overall associations with MeHg 
exposure in these nutrition cohorts and associations have not meaningfully changed after 
adjusting for biomarkers of maternal nutrient status such as PUFAs, selenium and vitamin E 
in multivariable models (Strain et al., 2015). This suggests that these nutrients are not strong 
confounders and cannot entirely explain the improved performance on some developmental 
tests with increasing exposure found in the current cohort. Alternatively, while biomarkers 
provide a direct indication of nutritional status as opposed to measures of self-reported fish 
intake which are less reliable, our nutritional assessments may not have fully captured the 
nutritional benefits of fish consumption resulting in residual confounding. Further study of 
factors that may influence the toxicokinetics and -dynamics of mercury and nutrients, such 
as the role of genetics, may shed additional light on the associations reported here. 
Nevertheless, SCDS findings to date do not provide a clear explanation for the observed 
associations suggesting better test performance with increasing MeHg at the exposure levels 
being studied.

 Throughout the study in secondary analyses we have also measured recent postnatal 
exposure at eight of ten developmental assessments and examined its association with 
developmental outcomes. Postnatal exposure has repeatedly been adversely associated with 
developmental outcomes, including measures of attention (Connors Teacher Rating Scale 
ADHD Index) and motor coordination (Grooved Pegboard) at 9 years (Myers et al., 2003; 
Myers et al., 2009), reading comprehension at 17 years (Woodcock-Johnson (W-J) Test of 
Scholastic Achievement-II Passage Comprehension) (Davidson et al., 2011), and motor 
speed (Finger Tapping) and problem solving (Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT) 
Matrices) at 19 years of age (van Wijngaarden et al., 2013b). We also found an adverse 
association with IED total errors adjusted, a sensitive measure of executive function, at 22 
years of age. We did not observe associations with any of the measures in the 24-year 
battery. Although we did not obtain nutritional biomarkers at 22 or 24 years of age, analyses 
at age 19 years showed that concurrent PUFA status did not confound postnatal MeHg 
associations (van Wijngaarden et al., 2013b). While one adverse association amongst 
numerous outcomes assessed at the two time points may indicate a spurious finding, it 
continues the pattern of sporadic postnatal associations seen in previous examinations of this 
cohort. Future studies should add to the currently inconclusive literature on postnatal MeHg 
exposure by using more comprehensive exposure metrics to better capture longitudinal 
variability in exposure and associations with developmental outcomes.
Postnatal MeHg studies have been limited by the lack of a comprehensive postnatal MeHg 
exposure profile (Grandjean et al., 2014). The one-time assessment of postnatal exposure 
used in nearly all studies, including ours, is not likely to be an adequate reflection of lifetime 
exposure or temporal variability in exposure (Myers et al., 2009). In the current cohort, 
recent postnatal exposure increased from an average of about 6 ppm in childhood to 8 ppm 
at 17 years of age and 10 ppm at 19 years of age (van Wijngaarden et al., 2013b) before 
declining to about 5 ppm in this study. The reasons for this fluctuation are not known. 
Although men at 22 years of age consumed on average two more fish meals than women 
which may partially explain why men have higher postnatal exposure, the higher MeHg 
levels in late adolescence cannot be explained by increased fish consumption (data not 
shown). There is a need to better account for temporal variability in exposure. Furthermore, 
most studies were done in children of elementary school age and did not evaluate whether 
adverse associations persist or appear later in adolescence when more detailed 
neurodevelopmental testing can be performed. Finally, despite growing evidence that 
genetics influence MeHg metabolism and therefore body burden (Julvez et al., 2013), none 
of the earlier studies have evaluated whether genetic susceptibility may explain population 
differences. Future targeted studies of postnatal MeHg exposure need to include a more 
extensive longitudinal characterization of exposure and determine its association with 
developmental outcomes throughout childhood and adolescence, and evaluate the impact of 
genetics on MeHg body burden and developmental outcomes.
Clarkson and colleagues have proposed that the Seychelles population can be considered a 
sentinel one for the study of MeHg toxicity from consumption of fish with only natural 
background levels of contamination. The Seychelles population consumes ocean fish daily, 
the fish MeHg content is similar to that consumed in the U.S., sea mammals are not 
consumed, and MeHg exposures are about ten times higher than in the U.S. (Clarkson et al., 
van Wijngaarden et al.

 1998). Additional strengths of our study include minimal exposure to other pollutants and 
contaminants that can adversely influence children’s neurodevelopment and confound MeHg 
associations (Davidson et al., 1998), repeated examinations using developmental tests that 
increase in specificity as the children have aged and that have both clinical and 
environmental validity (Davidson et al., 2006), and successful follow up with over 80 
percent of eligible participants examined at 24 years of age. Very few, if any, cohorts have 
been characterized this extensively with respect to environmental and social factors that may 
influence child development. Further, the study has been double blind from its inception and 
all primary analyses have been pre-specified. Study limitations are those inherent to all 
observational studies, and include the potential for measurement error and residual 
confounding due to omission of important covariates.
In conclusion, results from the SCDS Main cohort followed for 24 years suggest that 
prenatal exposure to MeHg from ocean fish consumption at the levels studied here is not 
adversely associated with neurobehavioral development. Further studies of postnatal MeHg 
exposure with improved exposure metrics are needed to better guide evidence-based public 
health advice on fish consumption in childhood and adolescence. The SCDS continues to 
provide policy makers with comprehensive evidence to guide public health advisories 
concerning fish consumption based on balanced scientific findings.

 Highlights
•
Studies of prenatal and postnatal exposure to MeHg and 
child development are inconclusive
•
We found no adverse association between prenatal and 
postnatal MeHg exposure and development in young 
adults
•
Study strengths include the prospective design, high 
follow-up rate, and high hair MeHg levels
