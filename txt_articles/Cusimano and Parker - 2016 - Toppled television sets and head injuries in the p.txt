elevisions can be dangerous to children and es-
pecially to toddlers between the ages of 1 and 3 
years.15 These devices are present in 99% of Amer-
ican and 95% of Canadian homes and have become larger 
over time.33,34 Newer televisions, such as wide-screen 
plasma TVs, are heavy and are often not well fixed to a 
stable base. A typical 36-inch-wide TV falling just 1 m 
creates the momentum equivalent to a 1-year-old child 
weighing 10 kg falling from 10 stories.4 Small children 
injured by falling TVs usually suffer head and neck in-
juries such as fractures and intracranial hemorrhages, 
which can be fatal.4,38,54 Such injuries are not rare events 
in developed countries where TVs are commonplace: TV 
toppling is ranked third in the top 5 hidden home hazards 
in the US,8,37 and the US Consumer Product Safety Com-
mission (CPSC) reported 19,200 injuries between 2008 
and 2010, up from 16,500 from 2006 to 2008.18,19 Over 
the last decade TV-related injuries have become more 
common, a trend that is likely to continue as TVs increase 
in size and more households globally are able to afford a 
TV.33,35,42,47

Toppled television sets and head injuries in the pediatric 
population: a framework for prevention

Injuries to children caused by falling televisions have become more frequent during the last decade. These injuries can 
be severe and even fatal and are likely to become even more common in the future as TVs increase in size and become 
more affordable.
To formulate guidelines for the prevention of these injuries, the authors systematically reviewed the literature on injuries 
related to toppling televisions. The authors searched MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL (Cumulative Index 
to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar according to the Cochrane guidelines 
for all studies involving children 0–18 years of age who were injured by toppled TVs. Factors contributing to injury were 
categorized using Haddon’s Matrix, and the public health approach was used as a framework for developing strategies to 
prevent these injuries. 
The vast majority (84%) of the injuries occurred in homes and more than three-fourths were unwitnessed by adult 
caregivers. The TVs were most commonly large and elevated off the ground. Dressers and other furniture not designed 
to support TVs were commonly involved in the TV-toppling incident. The case fatality rate varies widely, but almost all 
deaths reported (96%) were due to brain injuries. Toddlers between the ages of 1 and 3 years most frequently suffer 
injuries to the head and neck, and they are most likely to suffer severe injuries. Many of these injuries require brain imag-
ing and neurosurgical intervention. Prevention of these injuries will require changes in TV design and legislation as well 
as increases in public education and awareness. Television-toppling injuries can be easily prevented; however, the rates 
of injury do not reflect a sufficient level of awareness, nor do they reflect an acceptable effort from an injury prevention 
perspective.

toppling of televisions, it is primarily epidemiological 
or clinical in nature, without a focus on prevention. De-
spite annual warnings on the US CPSC website about TV 
tipover and Health Canada website warnings of TV tip-
ping accidents, the rate of injury remains high and appears 
to be increasing. 9,11,12,18,19,24,25 The goal of this study was to 
systematically review the literature on injuries related to 
toppling TVs and to formulate a framework for the pre-
vention of these injuries.
methods
Using the Cochrane guidelines for systematic re-
view, we searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, 
CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied 
Health Literature), the Cochrane Library, and Google 
Scholar using the following terms: “head injury,” “neck 
injury,” “cranial injury,” “skull fracture,” “brain injury,” 
“cerebral contusion,” “cerebral laceration,” “subdural he-
matoma,” “subarachnoid hemorrhage,” “epidural hema-
toma,” “diffuse axonal injury,” “traumatic brain injury,” 
“TBI,” “crush and static head injuries,” “TV,” “television,” 
“infant,” “child,” and “youth.” We also searched the US 
CPSC and Health Canada websites using the same key 
words. Hand searches of the journals Injury Prevention, 
Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics, and the Journal of 
Pediatric and Child Health were performed, starting with 
publications from 1988 (the initiation of the first study of 
injuries related to falling TVs, by DiScala et al.,15 which 
was published in 2001) through December 28, 2014. 
We included all studies involving children 0–18 years 
of age who were injured by toppled TVs. Studies investi-
gating household furniture injuries including televisions 
as furniture were also included in the literature review. 
Studies with no mention of head injuries inflicted by 
toppled televisions were excluded. Studies with injuries 
inflicted by television components in the absence of a top-
pling event were also excluded. A combined total of 4163 
article titles and abstracts were read and screened accord-
ing to the aforementioned criteria. Thirty-three articles 
met these criteria and were selected for full manuscript 
review. Of those 33 articles, 29 studies met the criteria ful-
ly and were selected for inclusion in the literature review. 
Four articles were excluded after full manuscript review 
because the reported injuries were inflicted by televisions 
but did not result from a tipover, or they were studies using 
the same group of injured individuals. The diagram of the 
systematic search and review is found in Fig. 1.
Factors contributing to injury were categorized using 
Haddon’s Matrix and the public health approach (PHA) as 
the framework for developing a strategy for the prevention 
of these injuries. Haddon’s Matrix has a systematic setup 
for identifying risk factors, whereas the PHA outlines a 
method for developing a plan of action to prevent inju-
ries.30 The PHA has 4 levels: surveillance, identification of 
risk and protective factors, implementation, and develop-
ment and evaluation of interventions. The data in the Had-
don’s Matrix are divided into 3 phases: pre-event, event, 
and post-event. Columns labeled “host,” “agent,” and “en-
vironment” are used to organize the factors based on the 
injured party, the vehicle causing the injury, and the social 
and physical situation surrounding the incident. In the case 
of TV-toppling injuries the hosts are children, particularly 
toddlers (children between the ages of 1 and 3 years); the 
agent is the television set; and the environment includes 
both the physical surroundings, such as the TV support 
furniture, and the social environment, such as caregiver 
supervision. From the factors presented in Haddon’s Ma-
trix and the PHA, we systematically derived a set of strat-
egies for the prevention of these injuries. Gray literature 
from conference abstracts and presentations, public alerts, 
articles, and blogs, was also considered in the construc-
tion of prevention strategies. Screening of these articles 
was subject to the same inclusion criteria mentioned above 
and any pertinent information on the mechanism of injury 
and prevention was collected and considered. Discussion 
of prevention is subdivided into 4 categories: engineering 
and design; legislation and enforcement; education; and 
systems.
results
Twenty-nine studies from 7 countries met the selection 
criteria. Information on head and neck injuries from the 
articles reviewed is summarized in Table 1. According to 
the data from these studies, of all age groups involved in 
TV-toppling incidents, toddlers most frequently suffer in-
juries to the head and neck, and their injuries are most 
likely to be severe, with an Injury Severity Score > 15.22 
The case fatality rate varies widely, but almost all deaths 
in these series (96%) were due to brain injuries. Murray et 
al. used only population-based estimates in their review of 
the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, which 
surveys approximately 100 US hospitals.35 These investi-

to systematically review the literature. Reasons for not including articles 
that received full manuscript review are also provided. Of 4163 articles 
initially found using the search terms, 29 met the criteria for inclusion in 
this review.

gators reported a nationally estimated 42,122 TV-toppling 
injuries between 1998 and 2007, 44% of which were head 
injuries. National estimates of TV-toppling injuries re-
ported by Gottesman et al. included 125,280 injuries be-
tween 1990 and 2007, and De Roo et al. reported 380,385 
between 1990 and 2011.12,21
Data from multiple studies regarding the characteristics 
of the events that led to TV-toppling injuries are summa-
rized in Table 2. Most (84%) of the injuries occur at home 
and more than three-fourths are unwitnessed by caregiv-
ers. The TVs are most commonly large (median size 27 
inches) and elevated off the ground 1–5 feet. Dressers 
and other furniture not designed to support televisions 
were commonly involved in the TV-toppling injury. The 
most commonly reported event leading to television top-
pling was a child climbing onto often unstable furniture 
to reach the TV or an object on top of the TV, although 
many studies did not report the number of incidents. There 
were also frequent reports of children pulling the TV onto 
themselves or colliding with the TV stand and thus caus-
ing the TV to topple.
A total of 160 TV-toppling cases had a specific mecha-
nism of injury stated. Of those 160 cases, collision of the 
child with the stand was most common cause precipitat-
ing injury from a falling TV (Table 2). However, in the 
majority of studies (19/29), climbing was identified as the 
most significant cause of injury, but many reports did not 
state the number of injuries related to this mechanism. 
Thus, the values reported in Table 2 for events leading to 
TV tipover may be skewed by the few studies (n = 9) for 
which the number of cases for each mechanism of injury 
was reported. In some cases the events leading to injury 
were vaguely described (e.g., TV/stand tipping), resulting 
in their exclusion from analysis. Toddlers were reported to 
have higher rates of climbing injuries than older children 
(> 4 years old), who were more likely to collide with the 
TV stand.21,35,46
The wide variety of cranial pathologies caused by top-
pling TVs is summarized in Table 3. Superficial injuries 
included contusions, ear/nose/throat bleeds, abrasions, lac-
erations, ecchymosis, and other nonintracranial injuries. 
Neurological deficits included any temporary or perma-
nent cranial nerve palsies as well as cognitive and memory 
deficits. These injuries can clearly be devastating or fatal.
discussion
Haddon’s Matrix (Table 4) was used to organize the fac-
tors associated with toppling injury during 3 time periods: 
pre-event, event, and post-event. This matrix was derived 
from the results of our review, and factors are discussed in 
order of host, agent, and environment. From these factors 
prevention methods were devised. 
analysis of host Factors
The “host” in Haddon’s Matrix refers to the typical 
victim of a particular injury.41 In the case of TV-toppling 
injuries, young children—specifically toddlers—are at the 
highest risk of injury. Factors in the host occurring before, 
during, and after the event contribute to the risk of injury 
in this group.

 toppled tv sets and head injuries in the pediatric population
J Neurosurg Pediatr Volume 17 • January 2016

Pre-Event Host Factors
There are 3 major factors preinjury that make toddlers 
more susceptible to television-toppling injuries. First, 
young children lack the perception and awareness of many 
risks.20 At such a young age, toddlers’ cognitive ability to 
recognize and avoid danger has not fully developed, leav-
ing them much more vulnerable to injury. Studies confirm 
that climbing television support furniture is a common ac-
tivity leading to injury.4,35,45 Second, uncoordinated infants 
and toddlers can unintentionally collide with unstable 
stands while playing in the vicinity of the TV, causing top-
pling accidents.22,33 Third, these children are exposed to 
the risk of television tipovers for extended periods of time 
every day. Not only are televisions becoming more ubiqui-
tous, it is estimated that children 2–5 years old spend more 
than 32 hours per week watching TV.32 The combination 
of a susceptible host with significant exposure to risk pro-
vides opportunity for preventive approaches.
Event Host Factors 
At the time of the television toppling, the factor con-
tributing to head injury is the television toppling onto an 
unprotected head. Because a toddler’s height is shorter 
than most TV stands, the head is most often the first point 
of contact from a TV-toppling event. Protecting the head 
may prevent or reduce the severity of injury. However, 
head protection may not be the most suitable means of 
prevention for this injury mechanism. Although head in-
juries cause the most deaths from toppling TVs, multiple 
injuries sustained in different body regions also increase 
injury severity. A study by Güloğlu et al. found that tod-
dlers 1–3 years old were more likely to sustain injuries to 
multiple body regions than any other age group.22 Small 
children may sustain secondary brain injuries or death 
caused by mechanical asphyxia because of their small size 
in relation to the television.
Post-Event Host Factors
Small children often have a limited ability to verbalize 
symptoms. In the case of mild head or neck injuries the 
child may underplay the severity of the damage, and the 
injured child or other children who were present may not 
inform a caregiver who has not witnessed the event. This 
can be dangerous and allow minimal damage to progress 
into a more serious condition. The case report by Lam 
and Place shows how injuries that are seemingly minor 
initially can progress to severe symptoms: a 12-month-
old child initially presenting with mild symptoms expe-
rienced rapid deterioration and cranial nerve deficits in a 
short time.29 Table 3 shows the range of head injuries that 
can occur and that many of those injuries require neuro-
surgical intervention. 
analysis of agent Factors
The agent factors refer to energy that is transmitted to 
the host through a vehicle.41 The agent in this case is the 
television and the physical energy it transmits to the child, 
causing the injury. Recent changes in TV style and stabil-
ity have not reflected awareness of child safety but instead 
have contributed to the increasing numbers of injuries 
caused by TVs (Table 1). 
Pre-Event Agent Factors
Over the years the physical composition of the TV set 
has changed. The once popular bulky cathode ray tube 
(CRT) TV has given way to the less space-consuming 
flat-panel TVs (FPTVs). The base to which the TV is at-
tached has also changed dramatically over the last couple 
of decades. Gone are furniture-style CRTs inserted into a 
rectangular wooden box with 4 short and stable legs pro-
viding 4 points of contact with the floor and a center of 
gravity that is largely in the center of the furniture. Newer 
CRT TVs have forward-shifted centers of gravity, increas-
ing the chance of tipping,36 and also in fashion are large, 
poorly supported FPTVs that are frequently mounted 
above toddler head height. 
FPTVs are thin, wide, and tall, with fairly central cen-
ters of gravity; however, even if properly secured, FPTVs

one study, Dotchin and Gordon found that 31 of the 49 
televisions within their Nova Scotia pediatric hospital 
were not secured in any way. In fact, 90% of all the TVs 
in this medical facility could be tipped over by children 4 
years or younger.16 
Consumers could be made aware of the hazard through 
warnings on televisions or the packaging in which they 
are sold, but in North America such warnings are not en-
forced, and the only mandatory labels on electronics (in-
cluding TVs) are fire hazard warnings.51
Event Agent Factors
Several agent factors contribute to injury at the time of 
toppling. The sheer mass of television sets can cause a lot 
of damage to a child’s head. TVs are now flatter and lighter 
than in the past, but they can still weigh more than 40 kg, 
which is nearly 3 times the size of the average 3-year-old 
child (14 kg).14,33,35 In addition, the pointed corners of the 
television set can cause penetrating injuries, leading to lac-
erations of the face or scalp, and more severe blunt-force 
skull fractures. Changes to the design of TV sets can be 
made to help make them safer and prevent injury.
Post-Event Agent Factors
After a television has fallen onto a child, further crush-
ing damage to the head or asphyxiation may occur if the 
object is not promptly removed. In older television sets, an-
tennae are another possible source of penetrating injuries. 
A case report by Al-Sebeih et al. described a penetrating 
oral-facial injury caused by a TV antenna, which fortu-
nately didn’t cause severe damage.1 Glass TV screens can 
shatter, depending on the force of impact, causing lacera-
tions and penetrating injuries.
analysis of environmental Factors
Environmental factors can be physical or social. These 
are the objects, people, and social concepts associated with 
the vehicle and host. In cases of TV-toppling injuries, the 
role of parents and caregivers who create the environment 
around TVs and must respond when injuries occur is chief 
among these factors. 
Pre-Event Environmental Factors
Several environmental factors play key roles in TV-
toppling injuries. Chief among these is the role of parents 
and caregivers who create the environment around TVs 
and who may be unaware of the high risk posed to toddlers 
from falling TVs. The resulting lack of safety precautions 
and inadequate supervision of small children are critical 
concerns, given that 77% of TV-toppling injuries are un-
witnessed by adult caregivers.
Another risk factor is the placement of desirable objects 
on top of the TV, which can entice children to climb the 
support furniture. Stands with drawers or other compo-
nents easily climbed by toddlers are more likely to lead to 
toppling injuries. Kodikara and Pollanen describe a case 
in which a 2-year-old girl attempting to climb a stand to 
reach the TV controls suffered a fatal toppling accident, 
and there are many more children who have met the same 
fate.28 
Event Environmental Factors
The higher the stand, the more velocity the TV picks 
up before impact with the child’s head. Thus, lower stands 
and those bolted to walls are safer.2 Unfortunately, far too 
many households have not taken these factors into consid-
eration when making decisions about TV placement.
Post-Event Environmental Factors
Many studies show that time to medical attention after 
a head injury influences outcome from that head injury.46,55 
Many people from low- and middle-income countries are 
now buying televisions, but these countries rarely have 
well-developed first response systems that service all ar-
eas.39 This lack of timely medical attention may lead to 
delays in treating primary and secondary effects of head 
injuries in these toddlers.

 toppled tv sets and head injuries in the pediatric population

clearly outlined by Haddon’s Matrix, the next step in pre-
vention, as the PHA suggests, is devising a plan of action. 
In this section we discuss prevention methods being used 
currently, ways in which these methods can be improved, 
and additional prevention methods not currently in prac-
tice. The topic of prevention of TV-toppling injuries in the 
pediatric population has been organized into 4 categories: 
engineering and design; legislation and enforcement; edu-
cation; and systems. A list of methods of prevention is pro-
vided in Table 5.
Engineering and Design
Throughout the literature, comments about the en-
gineering of newer generations of CRT televisions have 
emphasized the problem with their forward-shifted center 
of gravity.28,31,33 This engineering issue causes major in-
stability in CRT TVs. The FPTVs have a more balanced 
center of gravity and are much lighter than CRT TVs of 
equivalent screen size.12,31 The thin, light design of FPTVs, 
however, make them more susceptible to tipping with less 
force applied, and much easier for children to grasp. Also, 
FPTVs can still weigh upward of 40 kg, with the possi-
bility of inflicting significant damage on children. Recent 
studies have reported tipover injuries caused by FPTVs 
leading to pediatric head injuries.3,12 Efforts should be 
made to design lighter TVs with evenly distributed weight 
and built-in anchoring systems.
Another design and engineering concern around TV-
toppling events is the support furniture on which televi-
sions are placed. The decrease in popularity of CRT TVs 
is not actually reducing the amount of injury.12 This may 
be due in part to TV owners placing older CRT TVs in 
less supervised rooms and on furniture that was not built 
to withstand the weight of the TV, thus increasing the risk 
of toppling events. Dressers, armoires, and bureaus are 
reported as the most common furniture involved in TV-
toppling accidents.12,19,22,31,33,54 Although regulations are in 
place for testing of dressers and other household furniture, 
they are not tested to withstand the weight of TV sets be-
cause that is not their primary use.2,51 The CPSC, along 
with the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) 
and the Underwriters Laboratory (UL), have regulations 
on the manufacturing and testing of furniture often used 
to support televisions. Because consumers do not always 
place their TV sets on the manufacturer’s recommended 
stands, there is a greater risk of tipping. To address this 
issue of TV support furniture from an engineering and de-
sign point of view would be only half the battle, and so this 
issue is also discussed in the Legislation and Enforcement 
section. Ultimately, lower, wide-based stands will reduce 
the risk associated with toppling because a TV falling 
from a lower height obtains lower velocity before impact, 
and increased stability will decrease the risk of toppling 
from collisions with the stand. As climbing support furni-
ture is reported as a major contributor to toppling events 
(Table 2), designing stands with fewer knobs and drawers 
will reduce the potential for children to climb, thus reduc-
ing toppling rates.
Legislation and Enforcement
Currently there are regulations on the stability of 
TV stands as well as testing of TV stability. Testing of 
stands is routinely done postmanufacturing.51 However, 
as previously mentioned, many other pieces of household 
furniture are used to support televisions. In light of the 
increased tipping accidents, ASTM revised the ASTM 
F2057 standards for dressers, chests, and door chests, 
implementing 2 new tests for stability of these furniture 
pieces.2 The US CPSC has regulations on the testing and 
safety of “Children’s Products,” which include television 
sets.10 Health Canada Consumer Product Safety and the 
government of the United Kingdom (UK) also have gen-
eral regulations for household electronics.6,40,52 The UL is 
a global company contracted to test the safety of manu-
factured products. The UL has its own safety regulations 
in conjunction with regulations set by the country distrib-
uting the product. Regulations on TVs and stands are in 
place, but the incidence of injuries is still high. Therefore,

10. Objects desirable to children, such as toys or remotes, should not be placed on top of TVs.
11. Caregivers should increase supervision of children around the home.
12. Caregivers should refrain from removing objects that deeply penetrate the head & wait for medical professionals to assess the  
   injury.
13. Have parents/caregivers learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
14. Increase the number or speed of first responders, thus shortening the time between injury & treatment.

improvements in these regulations and better enforcement 
is needed.
There are areas in which legislation on TVs and TV 
stands is lacking and improvements could potentially 
serve to reduce toppling accidents. Current legislation re-
garding warnings placed on TVs focuses on fire hazard la-
bels.6,51 Implementing legislation requiring that mandatory 
warning labels for tipping be placed on televisions could 
be beneficial. Mandatory provision of proper anchoring 
brackets and TV straps at the point of sale should also be 
implemented. Along with anchoring devices there should 
be clear instructions on how to properly anchor TVs and 
stands. Another option is to sell TV-specific stands in 
conjunction with the television. This would increase the 
chances of televisions being placed on the proper support 
furniture; however, accomplishing this without other con-
sumer costs would be important.
Education
Improved public education is important for the pre-
vention of TV toppling. Parents, caregivers, teachers, and 
medical professionals should be educated on the strate-
gies that can be used to reduce the risk of television in-
juries. These strategies include increasing and improving 
supervision of children within the home, restricting play 
around TV sets, anchoring of TVs and TV stands, never 
placing televisions on dressers and other household furni-
ture, selecting stands that are short with wide bases, plac-
ing TVs as far back from the edge of the stand as possible, 
and never placing desirable objects for children on top of 
the TV. Once a toppling event has occurred, an injured 
child’s outcome can be greatly improved by parents and 
caregivers previously educated to speedily remove a fallen 
TV from the child’s body, to administer first aid such as 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation tactics, not to remove any 
deep penetrating objects, and to seek medical attention 
immediately.
Efforts to educate the general public through national 
campaigns can be improved. The US CPSC and Health 
Canada issue annual warnings. The UK’s Home Accident 
Surveillance System (HASS; http://www.hassandlass.org.
uk) was terminated in 2002, but this system previously re-
ported TV toppling as a large contributor to pediatric head 
injury.40 The Royal Society for Prevention of Accidents in 
the UK also warns the public about TV-toppling accidents.
Increasing awareness and prevention are occurring but 
are failing to reach a large audience. As Ota et al. report-
ed, 85% of caregivers were unaware of TV toppling as a 
potential hazard.36 Placing warnings on more high-traffic 
websites should increase the number of people exposed to 
the warnings. Another option is to distribute educational 
pamphlets at the point of sale. Also, simply placing labels 
warning of toppling on TV sets increases awareness, as 
addressed in the Legislation and Enforcement section.
Systems—First Responders
Although TV-toppling injuries may not be severe in 
all cases (Tables 1 and 4), seeking medical care for head 
injuries is important. Even with seemingly mild injuries, 
progression into more severe conditions may be avoided 
if medical care is sought.29,46,55 Thus, caregivers should 
take an injured child to the nearest emergency depart-
ment or call for emergency assistance. Cases that need 
emergency medical attention would benefit from fast, or-
ganized, emergency response systems. However, in many 
developing countries, and even in rural areas of developed 
countries, emergency first response is nonexistent or is not 
timely.39 Adding to the issue is the affordability of CRT 
TVs in developing countries.17,47 Families of lower socio-
economic status in these countries are more likely to buy 
unstable heavy TVs, and in the unfortunate event of a top-
pling accident they may not have the benefits of an emer-
gency medical care system. Although these system factors 
have larger implications than timely care of TV-toppling 
injuries, they are worth mentioning in the prevention of 
this mechanism of injury.
limitations of the study
Our review of the literature was systematic and thor-
ough; however, all of the papers that we identified were 
case series or case reports. The papers reviewed provided 
little focus on the prevention of head injuries. The US 
CPSC and Health Canada warnings have never been eval-
uated for their impact, and it is unclear how many consum-
ers actually read these websites. Properly designed studies 
from different jurisdictions that address the effectiveness 
of the types of interventions that we have suggested are 
required.
conclusions
Television-toppling injuries can be easily prevented; 
however, the rates of injury do not reflect a sufficient level 
of awareness, nor do they reflect an acceptable effort from 
an injury prevention perspective. Amendments to current 
legislation and implementation of additional regulations 
are suggested to reduce injury rates. Improvements in the 
design of television sets and stands as well as better tactics 
to educate the public are recommended. Also, the effort 
to prevent these injuries would benefit from prospective 
studies to better understand the injury mechanism. Future 
implementation of the aforementioned prevention recom-
mendations would go a long way toward reducing head 
and neck injuries from TV-toppling events.
