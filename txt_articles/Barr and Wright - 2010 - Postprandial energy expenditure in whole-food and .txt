implications for daily energy expenditure

Abstract
Background: Empirical evidence has shown that rising obesity rates closely parallel the increased
consumption of processed foods (PF) consumption in USA. Differences in postprandial thermogenic
responses to a whole-food (WF) meal vs. a PF meal may be a key factor in explaining obesity trends, but
currently there is limited research exploring this potential link.
Objective: The goal was to determine if a particular PF meal has a greater thermodynamic efficiency than a
comparable WF meal, thereby conferring a greater net-energy intake.
Design: Subjective satiation scores and postprandial energy expenditure were measured for 5�6 h after
isoenergetic meals were ingested. The meals were either ‘whole’ or ‘processed’ cheese sandwiches; multi-grain
bread and cheddar cheese were deemed whole, while white bread and processed cheese product were
considered processed. Meals were comparable in terms of protein (15�20%), carbohydrate (40�50%), and fat
(33�39%) composition. Subjects were healthy women (n�12) and men (n�5) studied in a crossover design.
Results: There were no significant differences in satiety ratings after the two meals. Average energy
expenditure for the WF meal (137914.1 kcal, 19.9% of meal energy) was significantly larger than for the PF
meal (73.1910.2 kcal, 10.7% of meal energy).
Conclusion: Ingestion of the particular PF meal tested in this study decreases postprandial energy expenditure
by nearly 50% compared with the isoenergetic WF meal. This reduction in daily energy expenditure has
potential implications for diets comprised heavily of PFs and their associations with obesity.

ithin the last 30 years the obesity rate for adult
Americans has more than doubled from 15 to
32% and currently it is estimated that two-
thirds of Americans are either overweight or obese, a 42%
increase since 1980 (1). A primary cause of this obesity
epidemic is thought to be gross caloric intake (2, 3),
which has risen by an estimated 300 calories per day in
the past 25 years in the USA (4). This has a strong
association with increased consumption of pre-prepared
processed foods (PF) (2, 5, 6) and insufficient consump-
tion of whole foods (WF), such as fruits, vegetables, and
whole grains (7). These trends call for more research into
the physiological consequences of PF consumption and
its possible relationship to net-energy balance.
Metabolic energy expenditure can be broken down into
three processes: basal metabolic rate (BMR), diet-induced
thermogenesis (DIT), and active metabolic rate (AMR)
(8). BMR is the energy cost associated with keeping
the body functioning at rest and AMR is the energy
expenditure resulting from daily physical activities (8).
DIT � also referred to as the thermal effect of foods (TEF)
or specific dynamic action (SDA) � is the body’s increase in
metabolism following the ingestion of food. It accounts
for the energetic costs of postprandial processes such as
food breakdown, enzyme synthesis, peristalsis, nutrient
uptake/assimilation, and secondary metabolism (e.g. urea
synthesis) and is typically responsible for about 10% of
daily energy expenditure in humans (9).
DIT varies depending on the macronutrient content of
the food ingested. Metabolism of carbohydrates is more
energetically expensive than that of fats, and protein
metabolism is the most energy-demanding of all (10�12).
In general, DIT will be higher, and net assimilated energy
lower, when a meal comprises more complex substrates

 requiring greater enzyme synthesis and more extensive
secondary metabolism in the liver (8, 13, 14). When
compared to whole foods, PFs characteristically have a
lower nutrient density (i.e. a lower content and diversity
of nutrients per calorie), less dietary fiber, and an excess
of simple carbohydrates (15�17), which makes them
structurally and chemically simpler than whole foods
and predictably easier to digest (15, 16, 18).
Surprisingly, very little research has evaluated the
effects of food processing on digestion. Most DIT studies
involving humans have focused on DIT energy expendi-
ture for meals of differing macronutrient content (10�12).
To our knowledge, none has measured DIT in response
to complete meals that are similar in macronutrient
composition but differ in the degree of processing.
It is hypothesized here that more extensively processed
foods have a greater thermodynamic efficiency (and thus
a greater metabolic disadvantage) than less processed or
whole foods. The present study tests this by comparing
the DIT responses of two isoenergetic meals.
Methods
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Pomona College. All participants were
at least 18 years of age and provided written informed
consent.
Participants and recruitment
Eight to fifteen subjects are needed to obtain statistically
significant differences in mean postprandial data when
using a crossover design (19). Thus, 18 eligible subjects
(12 females, six males) were recruited for the study. Fifteen
subjects were college students (aged 18�22 years) and
three were adults aged 47�56 years. Subjects with severe
dietary allergies, eating disorders, or regular use of
medications (with the exception of birth control), or other
serious health issues were excluded from participating.
One subject (male, 20-year old) was excluded from final
analyses because he contracted an illness during the time
of the study. The subjects self-reported their body mass
(kg) and height (m) for the BMI calculation (Table 1).
Fourteen subjects had a BMI within the normal range of
18.5�25. One female was slightly below at 17.7, one female
was slightly above at 25.8, and one male was slightly
above at 26.3. These subjects were included in analyses
because slight deviations outside the normal BMI range
commonly occur (20).
Meals
The subjects completed two trials where they ingested two
meal types, differing in degree of processing. Both meals
consisted of bread and cheese sandwiches. The whole-
food meal (WF) was comprised of multi-grain bread
(which contained whole sunflower seeds and whole-grain
kernels) and cheddar cheese, while the PF meal was
comprised of white bread and a processed cheese product
(Table 2, see Appendices A and B for ingredients and
nutritional information). Paired WF and PF meals were
isoenergetic and consisted of 600 kcal portions (2,520 kJ,
1½
sandwiches)
or
800
kcal
portions
(3,360
kJ,
2 sandwiches). Each subject was asked to choose a
preferred portion size and consumed this portion size
for each meal. Energy contents were derived from the
food labels. These list the estimated available (not gross)
calories using the nutrient information and assimilation
coefficients for different foods compiled in the USDA
1973 report by Merrill and Watt (21). Seven females
elected to eat the 600 kcal portion, while the five males
and the remaining five females elected to eat the 800 kcal
portion. Independent of portion size, each meal derived
the same proportion of energy from both the bread and
cheese (60% bread, 40% cheese). WF meal composition
was 40% carbohydrate, 39% fat, and 20% protein; PF
meal composition was 50% carbohydrate, 33% fat, and
15% protein (Table 2). The WF meal had approximately
three times the amount of dietary fiber than the PF meal.

 Experimental protocol
Each subject participated in two trials that were either
performed on consecutive days or no longer than a week
apart. The average duration of DIT for humans ranges
from 3 to 6 h (8); thus there is no carry-over expected for
subjects who participated on consecutive days. The
basic protocol was identical for both days. Subjects
were instructed to fast for 12 h prior to the beginning
of the trial, and not to participate in any strenuous
exercise during the day of the trial. Two BMR measure-
ments were taken on the morning of the trial day,
approximately 30 min before and immediately prior to
eating the prescribed meal. The order in which the
prescribed meals were eaten (i.e. WF or PF for the first
trial) was randomly chosen for each subject. Subjects
ingested the prescribed meal within a 20-min period and
were asked to return for six metabolic rate measurements
at hourly intervals. Some subjects only required five
measurements because their metabolic rate had returned
to BMR by the fourth measurement. All meals were
ingested between 9:15 and 11:15 am and each subject
ingested their meals at approximately the same time on
each test day (930 min). During each measurement,
oxygen consumption was recorded (VO2, L min�1) and
subjects were asked to record their satiety on a scale of
1�10. After the trial was complete, subjects were asked to
rate the palatability of the meal and their perceived
energy level on a scale of 1�10.
VO2 measurements and energy expenditure
Before beginning each measurement, subjects were in-
structed to sit resting for approximately 2 min to ensure
their breathing was not affected by physical activity. All
measurements were taken while the subjects were sitting
in a room maintained at 228C.
VO2 was measured by indirect calorimetry using an
iWorx 2116 interface spirometer and Labscribe software
(iWorx Inc., Durham, NC), and a Qubit Systems S102
Flow-Through Oxygen Sensor and Logger-Pro software
(Qubit Systems, Kingston, Ontario, Canada). The spiro-
meter was used to measure breath rate (BR, breaths
min�1) and average breath volume (BV, L). The oxygen
analyzer was used to measure total oxygen uptake (1O2).
Rate of O2 consumption:
VO2 (L min�1)�BR�BV�1O2
Total oxygen uptake: @O2�[O2 ambient]�[O2 exhaled]
At each measurement, subjects were asked to breathe into
the spirometer for 2 min using a nose clip to direct total
airflow through the spirometer. The last minute of breath-
ing was used to measure breath frequency and mean breath
volume. For measurements of 1O2, subjects were asked to
exhale 5�6 breaths into a gas bag, exhaling for 10 s for each
breath, and following each one by two to three normal
breaths. The contents of the gas bag were then drawn
through the oxygen sensor by means of an air pump. Gas
bags were vacuum extracted between measurements. The
oxygen sensor was calibrated with pure nitrogen (0%) and
ambient lab air (20.95%).
Metabolic rates for each hourly measurement period
during the DIT response were calculated from the
determined VO2 values using a modification of Wier’s
equation (22):
Metabolic rate (kJ min�1)
�4:184 [4:686�1:096 (RQ�0:707)]VO2
The energy expenditure derived from this formula is
established to have an errorB1% (22). RQ is the
respiratory quotient, which was estimated for both meal

and using published RQ values for carbohydrates: 1.0;
proteins: 0.81; and fats: 0.70 (23). The calculated WF
RQ�0.831 and the calculated PF RQ�0.844.
Data analyses
BMR was determined by averaging the two pre-meal VO2
measurements. The DIT response was considered to be
complete when VO2 returned to within one standard
deviation of BMR. Thirteen subjects recorded 6 h of
postprandial measurements, while four recorded for 5 h.
Duration of DIT (h), DIT metabolic scope (VO2 max/
BMR), and Tp (time to VO2 max, h) were collected for all
trials. Total DIT energy expenditure (kJ) was determined
by fitting a quartic equation to the DIT response curve,
and calculating the area underneath the DIT response
curve and above BMR. The DIT coefficient (%) was
calculated by dividing total DIT (kJ) by the total energy
content of the meal. Comparisons between WF and
PF meals for all subjects combined were analyzed using
pair-wise t-tests. The pair-wise differences between the
WF and PF data were, in turn, compared between sexes
and the two age-groups using a two-sample t-test. All
statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS Version 16
(SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) and were considered significant
at PB0.05.
Results
Subjects rated the WF meal as more palatable than the
PF meal (P�0.005), but post-meal energy ratings did not
differ (Table 3, P�0.22). Participants described their
average daily diet as 72% whole foods and 28% PFs.
Satiety ratings are shown in Fig. 1. The satiety ratings
showed no significant difference between the two meals
when compared over the entire monitoring period (P�
0.78) or when compared at any of the specific time
periods (P�0.10).
DIT response curves are graphed as the average
increase above BMR to control for inter-individual
variation in the subject’s metabolic rates (Fig. 2) and
metrics from these curves are summarized in Table 4. The
PF curve actually drops below BMR during the 6th hour
post-meal, while the WF curve never falls below BMR.
Although the Tp and DIT metabolic scope did not differ
significantly
between
WF and
PF
trials
(P�0.73,
P�0.053), the total DIT (kJ) and DIT coefficient (%)
were significantly greater with the WF trials (P�0.0009,
P�0.005). The duration of the DIT curve for WF was
also significantly greater, lasting on average a full hour
longer than that of the PF curve (P�0.001).
Analysis of total DIT and the DIT coefficient show
clear differences between WF and PF. On average, WF
DIT was nearly double PF DIT (Table 4). Taking into
account different serving size portions for different
subjects, the corresponding mean DIT coefficients are
19.9% (92.5%) for WF, and 10.7% (91.7%) for PF
(Table 4). Thus, the metabolic processes associated with
DIT consumed approximately twice as much energy for
the WF meal compared to the PF meal.
A difference between the sexes was apparent only
for DIT metabolic scope which showed a larger mean
difference between WF and PF in females than males
(0.156 vs. 0.062; P�0.047). Comparisons of the various
DIT parameters between the two age groups (data not
shown), and for both the WF and PF meals, showed no
significant differences with the exception of duration

 which showed a sparingly significant difference for the
WF meal only (6.0 h for the older age group [n�3],
5.71 h for the younger [n�14]; P�0.040).
Discussion
The results of this study suggest that this PF meal is more
thermodynamically efficient than the comparable WF
meal, and thus confers a metabolic disadvantage in
relation to obesity. The DIT of the PF meal was 46.8%
lower than the DIT of the WF meal. When the calculated
DIT values for the two meals (i.e. expended meal calories)
are subtracted from the total meal energy in each case,
the difference in DIT results in a 9.7% increase in net
energy-gain for the PF meal.
Macronutrient composition
The meals selected for this study were standardized for
overall energy content, which resulted in a small dis-
crepancy in the macronutrient composition. Protein
is generally accepted to require the greatest energy
expenditure in DIT (20�30%), followed by carbohydrates
(5�10%), and fats (0�3%) (9). Taking this into account,
the significant findings of this study could be influenced
by the 5% greater protein content of the WF meal
(Table 2). However, the difference in protein content is
much smaller than the observed difference in DIT and
will be partly offset by the lower carbohydrate/fat ratio of
the WF meal. Further, other studies have tended to show
a relatively small effect of protein content on overall DIT
(12, 14). Most processed meals in the typical American
diet are higher in carbohydrates and lower in protein
than comparable WF meals (17). Consequently, even if
reduced protein content is only a minor contributor to
differences in DIT, it will tend to exacerbate, rather than
offset, the metabolic disadvantage of PFs.
Palatability
LeBlanc and Brondel (24) suggested that a highly
palatable meal elicits a greater DIT response than a
tasteless,
unpalatable
meal
consisting
of
the
same
ingredients. However, subsequent studies have found
that DIT does not vary with palatability or meal
sweetness (25, 26). Although subjects in the present study
rated the WF meal as more palatable, we think it is
unlikely that this has a significant effect on the DIT
differences, particularly since the ratings for both meals
were not very disparate (Table 3), and the PF meal was
not ‘tasteless’ as in the aforementioned study (24).
Food composition and nutrient quality
Quality differences between WFs and PFs help to explain
why more energy would be needed in the digestion of WF.
Most PFs contain refined grains (17); the milling used
to produce refined grains removes most of the bran and
germ, and the accompanying nutrients that they offer,
such as B vitamins, phytonutrients, phenols, minerals,

 fiber, and proteins. The removal of germ contributes to
the lower protein content of refined grains and the
removal of fiber-rich bran makes the remaining starch
more readily digestible (18).
The mechanized preparation of PFs may also cause the
loss of many potentially health-promoting components
such as bioactives (i.e. isoflavones and antioxidants),
phytochemicals, amino acids, and fiber (15�17). This is
partially due to the removal of the bran fraction in wheat
milling, which is associated with reductions in diverse
phenolics, total antioxidant capacity, and b-carotene (15,
27). Consequently, PFs tend to have fewer metabolites,
and thus require less enzyme production and peristalsis,
simpler absorption, and less secondary metabolism, all of
which demand energy expenditure (8, 28). Further, PFs
have been shown to have a higher glycemic index than
non-processed counterparts (18, 29, 30), and the loss of
fiber tends to decrease meal bulk and slow satiation �
both of which result in increased daily caloric intake
(29�31).
The role of fiber
The WF meal tested in this study has approximately three
times the amount of fiber as the PF meal (Table 2, see
Appendices A and B for nutrition details) and although
the exact relationship of meal fiber content and DIT is
poorly known (31, 32), high-fiber diets are known to
decrease the assimilation efficiency of foods (33). Accord-
ing to FDA and USDA guidelines, the calories on
food labels list only assimilated calories, so this does
not introduce a known discrepancy into our calculated
isocaloric meal sizes (21). However, assimilated products
from fermentable fiber tend to make accurate assessments
of overall caloric assimilation difficult (32). This should
be a minor problem for the present study given that the
primary fiber source, wheat bran, is mainly insoluble and
subject to less breakdown than more fermentable fibers
(i.e. those found in fruit) (34). Bran-fiber does contribute
to some short-chain fatty acid absorption by the colon,
but to a small degree that would not significantly impact
our results (34, 35).
Study limitations
It is important to recognize that the WFs and PFs used in
this study represent different degrees of food refinement.
A more strict WF would be one devoid of any processing,
such as a specific fruit, vegetable, or meat. However, for
the present study, we sought to compare two meals that
were familiar to the Western diet, and could be easily
interchangeable.
Because the results of this study are based on only a
single meal comparison, appropriate caution must be
applied when extrapolating the findings to other meals or
to the Western diet in general. However, if future studies
indicate that reduced DIT is a common characteristic of
PFs, this suggests a simple means by which to alter
dietary habits to counter weight gain.
Conclusions
A higher thermogenic response was observed after a meal
composed of whole foods than after an equivalent and
isocaloric meal comprised of highly PFs. The lower DIT
of the PF meal indicates greater net-energy assimilation.
These findings are currently relevant only to this type of
meal, and future studies are required to determine
whether a reduction in DIT is characteristic of PFs
generally. Such a pattern is, however, predicted on
thermodynamic grounds. If the findings of the present
study are supported by future work, this would indicate
that diets with a high proportion of PFs will result in
increased energy assimilation and may be a contributor
to weight gain.
