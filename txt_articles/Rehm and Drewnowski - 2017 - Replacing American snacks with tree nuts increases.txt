Replacing American snacks with tree nuts
increases consumption of key nutrients
among US children and adults: results of an
NHANES modeling study
Colin D. Rehm* and Adam Drewnowski
Abstract
Background: Replacing typical American snacks with tree nuts may be an effective way to improve diet quality
and compliance with the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAs).
Objective: To assess and quantify the impact of replacing typical snacks with composite tree nuts or almonds on diet
metrics, including empty calories (i.e., added sugars and solid fats), individual fatty acids, macronutrients, nutrients of
public health concern, including sodium, fiber and potassium, and summary measures of diet quality.
Methods: Food pattern modeling was implemented in the nationally representative 2009–2012 National
Health and Examination Survey (NHANES) in a population of 17,444 children and adults. All between-meal
snacks, excluding beverages, were replaced on a per calorie basis with a weighted tree nut composite, reflecting
consumption patterns in the population. Model 1 replaced all snacks with tree nuts, while Model 2 exempted whole
fruits, non-starchy vegetables, and whole grains (>50% of total grain content). Additional analyses were conducted
using almonds only. Outcomes of interest were empty calories (i.e., solid fats and added sugars), saturated
and mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, fiber, protein, sodium, potassium and magnesium. The Healthy
Eating Index-2010, which measures adherence to the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, was used as a summary
measure of diet quality.
Results: Compared to observed diets, modeled food patterns were significantly lower in empty calories
(−20.1% and −18.7% in Model 1 and Model 2, respectively), added sugars (−17.8% and −16.9%), solid fats
(−21.0% and −19.3%), saturated fat (−6.6% and −7.1%)., and sodium (−12.3% and −11.2%). Modeled patterns
were higher in oils (65.3% and 55.2%), monounsaturated (35.4% and 26.9%) and polyunsaturated fats (42.0% and 35.7%),
plant omega 3 s (53.1% and 44.7%), dietary fiber (11.1% and 14.8%), and magnesium (29.9% and 27.0%), and
were modestly higher in potassium (1.5% and 2.9%). HEI-2010 scores were significantly higher in Model 1 (67.8) and in
Model 2 (69.7) compared to observed diets (58.5). Replacing snacks with almonds only produced similar results; the
decrease in sodium was more modest and no increase in plant omega-3 fats was observed.
Conclusion: Replacing between-meal snacks with tree nuts or almonds led to more nutrient-rich diets that were lower
in empty calories and sodium and had more favorable fatty acid profiles. Food pattern modeling using NHANES data
can be used to assess the likely nutritional impact of dietary guidance.

 Introduction
Between-meal snacks represent an important source of
solid fats, added sugars, and sodium in the American
diet [1–6]. The USDA has identified solid fats and added
sugars (SoFAs) as the main sources of “empty” calories,
contributing ample energy but few nutrients [7, 8].
Snacking between meals is consistently listed among
potential causes of obesity and weight gain [9–11] and is
an issue of public health concern.
Healthier snacking patterns could improve diet quality
by reducing empty calories and sodium, and increasing in-
takes of some insufficiently consumed nutrients [12, 13],
including fiber and potassium [14]. Healthier snack
patterns may also shift the fatty acid ratio away from solid
fats towards oils, by increasing mono- and polyunsatur-
ated fats (MUFAs and PUFAs), and plant-based omega-3
fatty acids, and reducing saturated and trans fat consump-
tion [15, 16]. In the United States, consumption of added
empty calories (e.g., added sugars and solid fats) and
sodium is much higher than recommended, while con-
sumption of some food groups, including whole grains,
plant and seafood protein, whole fruits and vegetables lags
well below recommended levels [17–19].
Tree nuts, including almonds, walnuts, and cashews,
have been featured prominently in multiple dietary
recommendations and guidelines [14], as well as consumer-
facing recommendations regarding healthy snacking from
numerous profesional and advocacy groups, including
the
American
Heart
Association,
the
American
Diabetes Association and Academy of Nutrition and
Dietetics
[20–22].
In
the
nationally
representative
cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Surveys (NHANES), tree nut consumption
was associated with better nutrient adequacy, higher
diet quality, and improved health risk markers [15, 16, 23].
Prospective cohorts have also observed that consump-
tion of tree nuts reduces the risk of all-cause mortal-
ity,
deaths
due
to
heart
disease,
cancer
and
respiratory disease, the incidence of heart disease, and
may reduce the likelihood of weight gain [24–28].
Analyses of dietary trends suggest that the consump-
tion of nuts/seeds among US adults has risen from
0.43 to 0.69 oz-equivalents per day from 1999–2000
to 2011–2012. In 2011–2012, just over 30% of adults
consumed ≥5 servings of nuts/seeds per week, the
recommended
amount
per
2000
kcal/d
from
the
2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans [14].
While no specific recommendation exists for tree
nuts, the trend in their consumption has been par-
ticularly strong, increasing 145% from 0.11 to 0.27
oz-equivalents per day from 1999–2000 to 2011–2012
[17]. Among the reasons for the substantial growth in
tree nut consumption may be their well-documented
health
benefits
as
well
as
the
certification
of
a
qualified health claim for nuts and heart disease in
2003 [29].
Following earlier studies on food pattern modeling
[30, 31], we sought to quantify the nutritional impact of
replacing
between-meal
snacks
with
tree
nuts
or
almonds. First, a tree nut composite was created based
on the relative frequency of consumption within the
population (e.g., a weighted average of almonds, walnuts,
pecans and other tree nuts). In substitution models, be-
tween-meal snacks (excluding beverages) were replaced,
on a per calorie basis, with this weighted tree nut
composite. One model replaced all solid snack foods
and a second model replaced all solid snacks, with
the exception of whole fruits, non-starchy vegetables
and whole grain foods. Based on the well-documented
high nutrient density of tree nuts [32], we expected
to observe measurable improvements in the quality of
food patterns generated. The primary goal was to
quantify the impact of such a replacement on key
dietary constituents of public health interest, includ-
ing added sugars, solid fats, empty calories, fatty
acids, sodium, potassium and magnesium.
Methods
Study population & dietary data
Dietary data were drawn from two cycles of the
nationally representative National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey
(NHANES) for
2009–2010 and
2011–2012. Data were available for 17,444 children,
adolescents
and
adults
age ≥ 1y.
Any
children
who
consumed breast milk were excluded. The sample included
6,881 children and adolescents (age 1–19y) and 10,563
adults (age ≥ 20y). At the time of study initiation (late
Summer 2015), these were the latest NHANES dietary
data available.
Data from two non-consecutive 24-h recalls were
used. The first 24-h recall was completed in-person at
the Mobile Examination Center with a trained inter-
view.
The
second
recall
was
completed
over
the
telephone many days later. The 24-h recall queries all
foods/beverages consumed by participants from mid-
night-to-midnight on the previous day [33]. Eighty-five
percent of respondents completed two dietary recalls
and the remaining 15% completed a single dietary
recall.
Nutrient data was obtained from the Food and Nutrient
Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS); FNDDS 5.0 for
2009–2010 data and FNDDS 2011–2012 for 2011–2012
data were used [34]. Data on consumption of food groups
of interest (e.g., nuts/seeds), added sugars, solid fats, and
oils were obtained from the Food Patterns Equivalent
Database (FPED); the cycle-specific version of FPED was
used for each NHANES cycle (e.g., FPED 2009–2010 for
2009–2010 data) [35].

 Modeling strategy
Two models were developed. Model 1 replaced all
between-meal solid snacks with tree nuts on a calorie-
per-calorie basis. Model 2 exempted between meal
snacks consisting of whole fruit, non-starchy vegetables,
or grain products containing more than 50% whole
grains. The models were applied to solid snacks only
and did not replace between-meal beverages, whether
fruit juices, soft drinks, cola, or alcohol. Between-meal
beverages were not included in the substitution models
for two reasons. First, we wanted the substitution
models to be a like-for-like comparison, where solid
foods were replaced with other solid foods. Second, we
wanted to keep the amount of energy being replaced to
levels that could feasibly be replaced with tree nuts, by
including beverages in the substitution models the
amount of energy being replaced would lead to infeasible
intakes of tree nuts. Beverage additions (i.e., sugar added
to coffee) were not replaced. Diets of individuals already
consuming tree nuts as exclusive snacks were not
modified. Foods were replaced on a calorie-per-calorie
basis to observe the impact on diet quality within an
isocaloric context.
A composite tree nut was created based on current
consumption patterns. First, a list of all tree nuts
consumed by NHANES participants from 2009 to 2012
was made (n = 21). Second, the weighted frequency of
consumption was estimated and a weight was assigned
to each tree nut corresponding to its frequency of
consumption.
For
example,
“almonds,
not
formally
specified” were identified as the most frequently con-
sumed tree nut and contributed a weight of 0.268 to the
composite tree nut. Other important components of the
composite
tree
nut
were
walnuts
(weight = 0.208),
pecans (0.088), dry roasted almonds (0.086), cashews
(0.076), dry roasted almonds without salt (0.071), and
pistachio nuts (0.069) (see Fig. 1). The nutrient profile
for the composite tree nut (per 100 kcal) was then
estimated based on these weights. The nutrient profile
of the composite tree nut was then used in the
models based on the amount of snack energy eligible
for
substitution.
Because
almonds
were
the
most
frequently consumed tree nut (~44% of all tree nuts),
secondary analyses were conducted with a composite
almond alone.
The primary outcome measures were dietary outcomes
based on nutrients of interest, selected based on their
overall importance to current dietary recommendations
[14, 36]. Nutrients of interest included dietary fiber,
potassium and magnesium; each of which are undercon-
sumed
per
the
2015–2020
Dietary
Guidelines
for
Americans and the first two are nutrients of public
health concern [14]. Furthermore, the 2010 Healthy
Eating Index (HEI-2010) was examined as a summary
measure of diet quality to measure the global impact
of the models on diet quality. The HEI-2010 is an
energy-adjusted measure of diet quality based on 12
components, including 9 components to encourage,
including
total
fruit,
whole
fruit,
total
vegetables,
greens and beans, whole grains, dairy, total protein,
protein from plant and seafood sources and the fatty
acid ratio (favoring higher ratio of mono- and polyun-
saturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids); and 3
components to discourage, including refined grains,
energy from solid fat and added sugars, and sodium.
Details on the HEI-2010 algorithm have been previously
described [37]. A version of the Healthy Eating Index

but
the
2010 and
2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines are generally in alignment
regarding
nutrients/food
groups
whose
consumption
should be encouraged and/or limited [14, 38].
Analyses
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) method was used
to characterize the usual intake of nutrients and food
groups of interest as observed and for each of the two
substitution models [39, 40]. This method can be used
to estimate the usual intake of nutrients and food
groups, including the population-distribution of intakes.
Two models were fit using this method; one for ubiqui-
tously consumed nutrients (i.e., foods/nutrients con-
sumed by most individuals on all days, such as fiber)
and another, which incorporates both the mean and
probability of consumption for episodically consumed
foods/nutrients (i.e., not consumed by most individuals
on all days, such as whole grains). Additional covariates
were included in the model to account for whether the
recall data were from a weekday or weekend and
whether
it
was
the
first
or
second
recall,
which
accounted for mode (e.g., telephone vs. in-person) and
order effects. Estimates of the population mean and
standard error and distribution of intakes were con-
ducted for observed diets and each modeling scenario
for the entire population and by age group. The NCI
method makes uses of both the first and second recall,
and includes all individuals regardless of whether they
completed a second recall. To estimate population
means for the HEI-2010, the population ratio method
was used, which uses a single recall [37, 41]. Code devel-
oped by the United States Department of Agriculture
was used to estimate the population average HEI-2010
and HEI-2010 component values for the observed diet
and two models [42].
In order to account for the complex survey design of
NHANES data, balanced repeated replication (BRR)
weights
were
constructed
using
WesVar
software
(Westat, Rockville, MD, 2012) and a Fay’s adjustment of
0.7. A total of 32 BRR runs were repeated for each
analysis, making the results representative of the US
population. To determine if mean intakes differed for
the different models as compared to the observed we
conducted
survey-weighted
t-tests
with
an
unequal
variance, comparing the results of each model to base-
line intakes. To place the results in context, we defined a
relative change of less than 5% to be “marginal” if the
difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Statisti-
cally significant differences (p < 0.05), for which the
relative change was between 5% and less than 10% (or
between −5% and greater than −10%), are described as
“modest”
or
“moderate”
changes,
while
statistically
significant changes greater than 10% (or less than −10%),
are described as “strong” or “dramatic”. Ten percent was
selected as the cut-off for “strong” effects as it corre-
sponds to the definition of a “good source” of nutrients
or minerals according to the US Food and Drug Admin-
istration [43]. A reference line corresponding to the
Daily Value (DV) for nutrients with a daily value in units
consistent with our analysis are included in all graphics
[44]. All output for this paper was generated using SAS
software, Version 9.3 and are representative of the US
population (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA).
Data availability and ethical approval
The necessary IRB approval for NHANES had been
obtained by the National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS) [45]. For adult participants, written informed
consent was obtained directly from the participating
adult. For child participants, parental/guardian written
informed consent was obtained and children/adoles-
cents ≥ 12y provided additional written consent. All data
used here are publicly available on the NCHS and USDA
websites [46]. Publicly available data, such as those used
here per University of Washington policies, do not
involve “human subjects” and their use requires neither
IRB review nor an exempt determination. According to
University of Washington policies, these data may be
used without any involvement of the Human Subjects
Division or the University of Washington Institutional
Review Board.
Results
Among the 17,444 study participants, 76.9% consumed a
snack on their first recall day (defined as any energy
from any food or beverage identified as a snack). Overall,
mean energy from all snacks was 303 kcal/d, whereas
the median was 204 kcal/d. Among snack-consumers,
mean energy from snacks was 394 kcal/d, whereas the
median was 293 kcal/d. Mean energy from solid snacks
eligible for substitution was 252 kcal/d and the median
was 148 kcal/d. For Model 1, the amount of solid snack
energy in kcal/d that was eligible for substitution
depended on age: 250 (ages 1–3y), 341(4–8y), 374
(9–13y), 350 (14–19y), 316 (20–30y), 309 (31–50y), 285
(51–70y), and 206 (71 + y). Median energy from snacks
(293 kcal/d) corresponds to 51 g of almonds or 45 g of
walnuts.
The distribution of calories from solid food snacks is
presented in Table 1 for snacks eligible for replacement
under Model 1 and Model 2, respectively. Under both
substitution scenarios, cookies and brownies, ice cream
and frozen dairy desserts, cakes and pies and candy con-
taining chocolate were the primary sources of snack cal-
ories from solid food. Popcorn, apples, bananas and
other fruits and fruit salads each contributed more than
1% of snack calories from solid foods.

 Results of primary models
The nutrient content of modeled food patterns is pre-
sented in Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 5 for the entire population
and by age group. Model 1 and Model 2 showed signifi-
cant declines in consumption of empty calories (−20.1%
and −18.7%), and a significant drop in solid fats (−21.0%
and −19.3%) and in added sugars (−17.8% and −16.9%).
Consistent with the decline in solid fats, consumption of
saturated fatty acids (SFA) declined modestly in both
models (−6.6% and −7.1%). By contrast, the consump-
tion of oils (+65.3% and +55.2%), total polyunsaturated
fatty acid (PUFA, +42.0% and +35.7%), alpha-linolenic
acid (ALA, +53.1% and +44.7%) and monounsaturated
fatty acid (MUFA, 35.4% and 29.6%) all increased. The
significant increase in total fat (+20.5% and +16.8%) was
accompanied by a greatly improved mono- and polyun-
saturated to saturated fat ratio. Dietary carbohydrates
dropped significantly (−13% and −10%), whereas a small
but statistically significant increase was observed for
protein (+2.6% and +1.7%).
Sodium declined from 3,518 mg/d in observed diets
to 3,086 mg/d (−12.3%) and 3,124 mg/d (−11.2%) in
Model 1 and 2, respectively. For dietary fiber, an
11.1% and 14.8% increase was observed compared to
observed
diets.
Small
changes
were
observed
for
potassium (not shown, +1.5% and +2.9%) and strong
increases
were
observed
for
magnesium
(+29.9%
and +27.0%).
Change in percent of population meeting
recommendations
A change in the proportion of individuals meeting pre-
specified dietary recommendations is an alternative way
of assessing diet quality. For sodium, the percent of the
population consuming less than 2300 mg/d nearly dou-
bled from 11.7% as observed to 21.6% and 20.4% in
Models 1 and 2, respectively. For dietary fiber, the per-
cent of the population consuming more than 25 g/d in-
creased from 10.7 to 15.9% and 18.8% in Models 1 and
2, respectively.
Age-specific results
Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5 also show the nutrient quality of
modeled food patterns for specific age groups. Age-
specific effects were impacted by a number of factors,
including the frequency of snacking within that age
group and the types of snacks typically consumed within
that age group. For example, children 4–8y and 9–13y
were most likely to consume candy/confectionary as
snacks, so their models had a more dramatic impact in
reducing sugars. By contrast, older adults were least
likely to consume between meal snacks, so the results of
snack substitution tended to be weaker in this popula-
tion as compared to younger adults. Significant declines
in empty calories, solid fats and added sugars were ob-
served for all groups, but were most profound among
children 4–8y and 9–13y.
Results of almond-only modeling
Sensitivity analyses evaluated the impact of a snack sub-
stitution model using almonds only. Almonds were the
most frequently consumed type of tree nut during the
NHANES 2009–2012 data collection period (see Fig. 1).
Substitution modeling using the tree nut composite and
almonds-alone
produced
very
similar
results
(see
Table 2). Significant declines in empty calories, added
sugars, and solid fats were observed for modeled food

 patters in both models. A drop in sodium in the
almond-only model was weaker but statistically signifi-
cant. The only difference was a decrease in dietary
alpha-linolenic acid (plant based omega 3 essential fatty
acid) in the almond-only model as compared to the
composite model. This is likely due to the fact that
walnuts contain high
levels of alpha-linolenic acid
whereas almonds do not.
Impact of models on healthy eating index-2010
To measure the total impact of the substitution models
on diet quality, the HEI-2010 was examined (see Fig. 6).
Based on observed diets, the population mean HEI-2010
value was 58.5 (95% CI 57.4, 59.7). For both models, the
HEI-2010 values were significantly higher, 67.8 for
Model 1 and 69.7 for Model 2 (p < 0.001 for each). For
all age groups, the HEI-2010 score was significantly

 higher in both Model 1 and Model 2 as compared to
observed diets. The effect was particularly profound
among children and adolescents due to low HEI-2010
baseline values and higher frequency of consuming lower
quality snacks. As expected, the results of Model 2 tended
to be stronger than for Model 1. When evaluating
individual HEI-2010 components (see Fig. 7), modest but
statistically significant declines were observed for total
vegetables, total fruit, whole fruit, whole grains and dairy
comparing observed diets to Model 1. However, compo-
nent values for seafood and plant protein, fatty acid ratio,
sodium, refined grains, and energy from solid fat and

Discussion
Faced with the need to improve US diets, the 2015–2020
Dietary Guidelines for Americans stressed that making
small shifts in eating patterns can make a big difference
in diet quality overall [14]. One recommendation was to
improve the nutrient quality of between-meal snacks,
replacing high-calorie snacks with more nutrient-rich
options [14]. In a parallel effort to improve diets of
children, new federal rules require healthier snacks in
schools [47]. Quantifying the impact of replacing typic-
ally consumed solid food snacks with tree nuts was the
primary purpose of the present study. For the same
amount of calories the modeled food patterns replacing

 currently consumed solid food snacks with tree nuts
were more nutrient dense. First, there was a significant
reduction in empty calories. Second, there was a shift in
dietary fat profiles. The modeled diets had much less
saturated fat and a more favorable fatty acid profile,
characterized by more oils, more MUFAs and PUFAs,
and more plant omega-3 s (alpha-linolenic acid). The
ratio of PUFA and MUFA to saturated fatty acids was
much more favorable than in observed diets. Total fat
content was higher, as might be expected after replacing
many refined grains or sugar-sweetened grains with nuts
containing fat, fiber, and protein. Overall, Healthy Eating
Index-2010 scores improved in the modeled compared
to observed diets.
Frequent between-meal snacking has long been an issue
of public health concern [48, 49]. In several past studies,
increased snacking frequency has been linked to rising
obesity rates [9, 10]. First, more frequent snacking has been
associated with consuming more calories overall [8].
Second, some of the commonly eaten snacks were of low, if
not minimal, nutritional value [8]. Foods and beverages
consumed as snacks provided higher proportions of
alcohol, carbohydrates, and total sugars relative to calories,
while providing lower proportions of many other nutrients.
On average, US adults consumed 24% of daily calories as
snacks [49]. Consistent with prior reports [3, 50, 51], the
most commonly eaten snacks in the US were sweet desserts
high in carbohydrates, sugars, and saturated fats. The top
items in the 2009–2012 NHANES were cookies, brownies,
cakes and pies, ice cream and frozen dairy desserts,
chocolate candy and doughnuts, pastries and sweet rolls.
Also on the list were corn chips, crackers and potato
chips. Between-meal snacks consisting of apples, bananas,
yogurts and other fruit were eaten less often.
Substitution modeling of dietary patterns offers a
compelling way to test the nutritional impact of dietary
guidance [30]. When based on nationally representative
dietary data, such models can provide insight into the
impact of federal dietary guidelines on the diet of the
entire population or specific population sub-groups
[30, 31]. The modeled food patterns can be used to evalu-
ate, compare, and rank the impact of following dietary
advice on measures of diet quality at the population level.
Results of modeling studies can be used to inform effect-
ive nutrition communications and the sub-populations
that may benefit most from such efforts. For example, we
observed the greatest impact of replacing snacks with tree
nuts among children and adolescents, as they tended to
consume proportionally more nutrient sparse and less
healthful snacks as compared to adults. In addition,
children/adolescents are less likely to consume nuts/seeds
both overall and as a snack [14].
With that said, such models also have limitations.
First, for any substitution model, the units of the
Fig. 7 Healthy Eating Index-2010 components in modeled and observed diets. Model 1 is substitution of all solid snack foods with the composite
tree nut and Model 2 is substitution of all solid foods except for whole fruit, non-starchy vegetables and foods where more than 50% of the total
grain comes from whole grains. P-value of difference comparing each model to observed value is indicated by asterisk (***p < 0.001; **0.001 < p-value
< 0.01; *0.05 < p < 0.01). Hypothesis testing comparing Model 1 to Model 2 was not conducted

Page 11 of 15
 substitution model are critical (e.g., whether foods are
replaced
on
per-calorie
or
per-serving).
Given
the
diverse number of foods in the present study and the
arbitrary nature of serving sizes, we opted for an isocalo-
ric substitution model. In simple terms, such a model
would result in no change in energy intakes, and there-
fore no change in body weight. However, if applied in
practice, given the relatively high satiety of nuts com-
pared to commonly consumed solid snacks, we might
expect fewer calories to be consumed [52, 53]. However,
this assumption is not verifiable, so relying on an isoca-
loric model seems most appropriate. Beyond impacts on
weight, substantial improvements to the diet independ-
ent of energy changes is likely to have considerable
population health benefits. Second, as evidenced by the
impact of the models on Healthy Eating Index-2010
component scores, replacement of all solid snacks with
tree nuts resulted in modest declines in whole fruit,
vegetable, whole grain and dairy intakes. Model 1 was
agnostic as to the foods being replaced; both less healthful
and more healthful snacks were replaced. As expected
Model 2, which did not replace whole fruits, non-starchy
vegetables or whole grain snacks with tree nuts, resulted
in better improvements and no significant declines in
HEI-2010 component scores, with the exception of total
dairy. However, because it is important to quantify both
the positive and potentially negative impact of any model,
we opted to use two models, one that universally replaced
solid snack foods and another, which more judiciously
replaced
snack
foods.
Despite
major
improvements
observed for many of the modeled dietary constituents
evaluated,
in
many
cases
population
mean
intakes
remained
well below recommended
levels
(e.g., for
sodium, fiber and potassium), suggesting that multiple
other changes would need to be implemented simultan-
eously. For example, increasing whole grain, whole fruit or
vegetable consumption, specifically through replacing re-
fined grains and foods high in empty calories would also
have tremendous population health impact. As such, these
models should be viewed as an approach for quantifying
and comparing the impact of various strategies, not as a
prescription for specific changes an individual should make.
Substitution modeling complements and builds upon
past studies comparing the diets of tree nut consumers
and non-consumers. In past studies, based on 2005–
2010 NHANES data, usual diets of tree nut consumers
were also determined using two 24-h dietary recalls and
the NCI Method [16]. That study assessed diet quality
based on percentages of tree nut consumers below the
estimated average requirement (EAR) or above the
adequate intakes (AI) relative to non-consumers. Diets
of tree nut consumers showed more favorable intakes
for vitamins A and C, folate, calcium, iron, magnesium
and zinc as well as potassium and fiber. The Healthy
Eating Index 2005 score (HEI 2005) was higher for tree
nut consumers as compared to non-consumers.
In cross-sectional studies, tree nut consumers and
non-consumers were of necessity different people, who
may differ by both observed (e.g., age) and unobserved
or difficult to measure factors (e.g., health-seeking
behavior). By contrast, substitution modeling offers some
insight into how diets of individual consumers can be
improved by making some small changes in food choices
that are based, in part, on the existing eating patterns of
the broader population as the tree nut composite was
tailored based on population consumption patterns.
Past studies of tree nut consumers and non-consumers
found that the two groups did not differ in their usual
sodium
intakes
and
both
exceeded
recommended
adequate intake [16]. Given that tree nuts are generally
very low in sodium, nut consumers, typical of the
American diet consumed excessive amounts of sodium
from other sources. In some past studies, tree nut
consumers had lower sodium intakes than did non-
consumers [15, 54]. Consistent with those data, the
present modeling study showed that the sodium content
in modeled diets was much lower than in observed diets.
Given that a small increase was observed for potassium,
there was a decline in the dietary sodium to potassium
ratio,
another
index
of
diet
quality.
Comparable
patterns were observed for almonds only modeling.
These modeled data counter the perceptions that
tree nut snacks may act as a vehicle for increasing
dietary sodium.
The present study quantifies the impact of replace-
ment of solid food snacks with tree nuts, suggesting that
such a replacement may have a profound effect on
population diet quality. However, the critical question
moving forward is what policies and interventions may
be most effective at increasing consumption of tree nuts
at the population-level. Schools and childcare settings
may be one environment where tree nut consumption
could be increased. A number of tools were recently
made available online by the US Department of Agriculture
to help schools identify those food items that meet Smart
Snacks Standards, which were implemented in 2014–15
[55]. Based on these Standards, almonds, dry roasted
without salt in 1 oz packages (167 kcal) are compliant with
the school guidelines, providing <200 kcal per serving [56],
as nuts/seeds are exempt from the total fat threshold.
Products consisting of only dried fruit with nuts and/or
seeds with no added sugars or fats are also exempt from
the saturated fat standard [57]. Additional policies that may
promote nut consumption include the adoption of healthy
vending policies, though the contribution of vending
machines to snack intake at the population-level re-
mains limited. Additional strategies to increase nut
consumption may include social marketing and/or
Rehm and Drewnowski Nutrition Journal  (2017) 16:17 
Page 12 of 15
 mass communication efforts to increase awareness regard-
ing the health benefits of nuts or address potential
misconceptions (e.g., that nuts consumption may lead to
weight gain) [58]. In addition, targeted subsidies to reduce
their cost in comparison to less healthful snacks might be
an additional approach to increase their intake [59]. The
efficacy of these approaches specific to increasing nut
consumption has not yet been established.
The present study had a number of strengths. First,
the data are nationally representative and we used the
NCI method to estimate usual intake distributions for
the entire population and by age group. Second, same-
person replacement modeling complements past studies
based on consumers and non-consumers of a specific
food. Third, we used a composite tree nut, based on
existing nut consumption patterns, which allows for a
more precise assessment of the potential nutritional
effects of behavioral changes. Further, the tree nut com-
posite included both salted and unsalted nuts, weighted
by consumption frequency. Therefore, the modeled
results are representative of what would be observed if
current consumption patterns continued.
Numerous limitations are also worth noting. First, all
NHANES data were based on self-reports. Proxy reports
were used for young children [60] and some foods may
be under-reported, either through omission or error in
recording portion sizes [61]. It is also possible that some
participants reported tree nuts, while eating peanuts
[15]. In addition, the results presented here are based on
models and do not reflect actual behavior of individuals.
Nonetheless, substitution modeling in the context of a
specific meal or eating occasion, offers one way to test
the potential nutritional impact of dietary guidance.
Conclusion
Based
on
present
modeling
analyses,
widespread
replacement of solid food snacks with tree nuts or
almonds would improve the quality of the diet. Even
a partial replacement, exempting already nutrient rich
snacks, had a significant positive effect on diet quality.
Substitution modeling can provide added insight into the
likely impact of following 2015–2020 DGAs on diet
quality in the US.
