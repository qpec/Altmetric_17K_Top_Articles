Aims
To date, clinical evidence of microvascular dysfunction in patients with heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection
fraction (HFpEF) has been limited. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of coronary microvascular dysfunction
(CMD) and its association with systemic endothelial dysfunction, HF severity, and myocardial dysfunction in a well
defined, multi-centre HFpEF population.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
This prospective multinational multi-centre observational study enrolled patients fulfilling strict criteria for
HFpEF according to current guidelines. Those with known unrevascularized macrovascular coronary artery disease
(CAD) were excluded. Coronary flow reserve (CFR) was measured with adenosine stress transthoracic Doppler
echocardiography. Systemic endothelial function [reactive hyperaemia index (RHI)] was measured by peripheral ar-
terial tonometry. Among 202 patients with HFpEF, 151 [75% (95% confidence interval 69–81%)] had CMD
(defined as CFR <2.5). Patients with CMD had a higher prevalence of current or prior smoking (70% vs. 43%;
P = 0.0006) and atrial fibrillation (58% vs. 25%; P = 0.004) compared with those without CMD. Worse CFR was
associated with higher urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and NTproBNP, and lower RHI, tricuspid annu-
lar plane systolic excursion, and right ventricular (RV) free wall strain after adjustment for age, sex, body mass
index, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, revascularized CAD, smoking, left ventricular mass, and study site (P < 0.05 for all
associations).
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
PROMIS-HFpEF is the first prospective multi-centre, multinational study to demonstrate a high prevalence of CMD
in HFpEF in the absence of unrevascularized macrovascular CAD, and to show its association with systemic endo-
thelial dysfunction (RHI, UACR) as well as markers of HF severity (NTproBNP and RV dysfunction). Microvascular
dysfunction may be a promising therapeutic target in HFpEF.

Introduction
Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) has been proposed to
be a novel mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of heart failure
(HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)1–5—the dominant
form of HF for which no treatment has yet been proven to reduce
morbidity and mortality.6 Paulus and Tschope5 hypothesized that
comorbidities common to HFpEF (e.g. obesity, diabetes, chronic kid-
ney disease) lead to systemic inflammation and coronary endothelial
inflammation and CMD, which reduces endothelial nitric oxide bio-
availability and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production
by adjacent cardiomyocytes. This process results in downstream titin
hypophosphorylation and increased cardiomyocyte stiffening, cardio-
myocyte hypertrophy, myofibroblast activation, and interstitial fibro-
sis. Both cardiomyocyte and extracellular mechanisms lead to
increased left ventricular (LV) diastolic stiffening, a known hallmark of
the HFpEF syndrome.7
Coronary microvascular dysfunction could also explain other dele-
terious effects in HFpEF such as exercise-induced myocardial ischae-
mia, subendocardial LV systolic dysfunction,8–10 and poor cardiac
systolic and diastolic reserve.11,12 Several preclinical studies support
the hypothesis that CMD plays a key role in HFpEF pathogen-
esis.1,4,13–17 However, clinical evidence of CMD in HFpEF has been
largely indirect and limited to relatively small prospective studies or
retrospective studies involving convenience samples referred for
nuclear imaging for the evaluation of coronary artery disease
(CAD).16–20 Exercise studies implicate vascular stiffness and impaired
exercise vasodilation and suggest that impaired diastolic reserve may
be related to endothelial and microvascular dysfunction.12 An aut-
opsy study provided convincing evidence of coronary microvascular
rarefaction in HFpEF.4 While supportive of the presence of CMD in
HFpEF, the prevalence of CMD in HFpEF remains unknown, and the
clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic correlates of CMD in
HFpEF have not been adequately studied. Understanding the factors
associated with CMD in HFpEF could provide insight into the patho-
genesis of HFpEF and may help inform the design of future clinical
trials of pharmacotherapies designed to ameliorate CMD in HFpEF.
We, therefore, designed a prospective, multi-centre, multinational
study of CMD in HFpEF using a comprehensive functional imaging ap-
proach combining detailed echocardiography and adenosine-based
transthoracic Doppler echocardiography-assessed coronary flow
reserve
(CFR)
measurement
[PRevalence
Of
MIcrovascular
dySfunction in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction
(PROMIS-HFpEF)]. The key goals of the study were to evaluate (i)
the prevalence of impaired CFR in HFpEF; and (ii) potential correlates
of reduced CFR in HFpEF, including systemic endothelial dysfunction,
clinical factors, laboratory markers, and echocardiographic indices.
Methods
PROMIS-HFpEF study design
Between December 2015 and January 2018, patients with a confirmed
diagnosis of chronic HFpEF who met pre-defined inclusion and exclusion
criteria (see Supplementary material online) were prospectively enrolled
at five centres [Karolinska Institute (Stockholm, Sweden); Sahlgrenska
University Hospital (Gothenburg, Sweden); Turku University Hospital
(Turku, Finland); Northwestern Memorial Hospital (Chicago, USA); and
National Heart Centre Singapore (Singapore)]. Major inclusion criteria
included a prior history of symptomatic HF, stable New York Heart
Association (NYHA) Class II–IV symptoms on the most recent clinic visit,
ejection fraction (EF) >
_40%, and at least one of the following criteria: (i)
elevated natriuretic peptides; (ii) prior HF hospitalization with evidence
of either LV hypertrophy or left atrial (LA) enlargement; (iii) elevated pul-
monary capillary wedge pressure at rest or with exercise; or (iv) E/e0 ratio
>15. All patients underwent evaluation for epicardial CAD according to
current guidelines. In patients who had suspected ischaemic heart disease,
stress testing and/or coronary angiography was performed to exclude sig-
nificant epicardial CAD. Patients with known unrevascularized macrovas-
cular CAD were excluded. All study participants gave written informed
consent, and the institutional review board at each of the participating
sites approved the study. The PROMIS study complies with the
Declaration of Helsinki.
Study procedures included a history and physical examination; fasting
blood and urine testing; 6-min walk test (6MWT); EndoPAT (peripheral
arterial tonometry) testing; Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire
(KCCQ21); comprehensive echocardiography; and Doppler echocardiog-
raphy measurement of left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery
flow velocity at rest and during adenosine infusion. The Supplementary
material online contains the collected clinical characteristics, laboratory
tests, definitions of comorbidities, and a description of EndoPAT testing.
Echocardiography
All study participants underwent comprehensive two-dimensional echocar-
diography with Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging using commercially
available ultrasound systems with harmonic imaging (Vivid 7 or Vivid E9, GE
Healthcare, General Electric Corp., Waukesha, WI, USA). The test was
performed with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position. Blood pres-
sure was recorded at the time of echocardiography using a digital blood
pressure monitor with a brachial cuff. Cardiac structure and function were
quantified as recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography/
European
Association
of
Cardiovascular
Imaging22–26;
non-invasive
pressure-volume analysis was performed using echocardiographic and
blood pressure data27; and speckle-tracking analysis of the echocardio-
grams was performed as described previously.8 The echocardiography
methods are further detailed in the Supplementary material online.
Measurement of coronary flow reserve
A dedicated research sonographer from each study site underwent a cen-
tralized, in-person, intensive 1 week training and standardization pro-
gramme at Sahlgrenska University Hospital for the acquisition of LAD
Doppler flow signals at rest and during adenosine infusion. Coronary
flow reserve testing was performed using a previously published and vali-
dated protocol.28 Briefly, the mid-to-distal portion of the LAD coronary
artery was identified using high-resolution (3.0–3.5MHz) colour Doppler
in the interventricular sulcus in a modified apical two-chamber view.
Pulse wave Doppler was used to sample flow velocity signals at rest and
during adenosine infusion (140lg/min/kg) over 5–10min. During the en-
tire procedure, blood pressure and electrocardiography (ECG) were
monitored. All studies were digitally stored for offline reviewing and
measurements. Coronary flow velocity data were analysed offline using
the ultrasound software Image Arena (TOMTEC, Unterschleißheim,
Germany). Mean diastolic flow velocity at baseline and during peak hyper-
aemia was measured by manual tracing of the diastolic Doppler flow sig-
nals. Baseline coronary flow velocities were calculated by using the mean
value of three representative cardiac cycles. The mean hyperaemic cor-
onary flow velocity during adenosine infusion was calculated as the mean
of the three highest values. For patients with atrial fibrillation, 10 beats
were averaged at both rest and during hyperaemia. Coronary flow

reserve was calculated as the ratio between the hyperaemic and baseline
mean coronary flow velocity values. A coronary flow velocity ratio of
<2.5 was defined as reduced and diagnostic of CMD based on prior stud-
ies that have established Doppler-based CFR <2.5 as the optimal thresh-
old.29 However, given the continuum of risk associated with reduction in
CFR (without a specific threshold) in other cardiovascular syndromes,
we also examined CFR as a continuous variable (see Statistical Analysis
section). All CFR measurements were performed by a single, blinded in-
vestigator at an experienced core laboratory at Sahlgrenska University
Hospital (Sahlgrenska, Sweden). Details regarding the validation and feasi-
bility of the echocardiography Doppler-based CFR measurement are
provided in the Supplementary material online.
Statistical analysis
Using CFR <2.5 as a cut-off to define CMD, we first calculated the preva-
lence and 95% confidence interval (CI) of CMD in the enrolled HFpEF
patients. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Heart Failure
Association Pre-test probability, Echocardiography, Further advanced
work-up, and Final etiology (HFA-PEFF) score—a tool based on echocar-
diographic and natriuretic peptide data, created to verify the diagnosis of
HFpEF—was calculated for all patients. Next, we divided the PROMIS-
HFpEF study participants into those with vs. without CMD and compared
clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and echocardiographic measures.
We used the t-test (or non-parametric equivalent, when indicated) and
the v2 test (or the Fisher’s exact test, when indicated) to compare con-
tinuous and categorical variables, respectively.
We used multivariable linear regression (using CFR as the dependent
variable) to identify the clinical correlates of CMD. We also used un-
adjusted and multivariable-adjusted linear regression analyses [using
KCCQ,
6MWT,
urinary
albumin-to-creatinine
ratio
(UACR),
NTproBNP, and various echocardiographic parameters as the dependent
variable in each model] to determine the independent association be-
tween CFR and these variables. Covariates were selected on a basis of
clinical relevance and known association with CMD. We also included
study site as a covariate in all multivariable analyses. Covariates included
age, sex, body mass index (BMI), atrial fibrillation, diabetes, CAD, LV
mass, and E/e0 ratio. Formal interaction testing with multiplicative inter-
action terms was used to determine whether certain study (site) or clinic-
al (age, sex, atrial fibrillation, and BMI) characteristics modified the
identified factors associated with CMD in the HFpEF patients.
Multicollinearity was examined in all regression models using the
Variance Inflation Factor and correlation between variables included in
the models. We used 200-fold bootstrapping of the multivariable-
adjusted linear regression models to provide bootstrapped CIs.
A two-sided P-value < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical signifi-
cance. All analyses were performed using Stata v.12 (StataCorp, College
Station, TX, USA).
Results
As shown in Figure 1 (patient flow diagram), a total of 263 patients
were enrolled at the five study sites. Of these, CFR testing was
attempted in 233, of whom 202 (87%) underwent successful CFR
testing. As shown in Supplementary material online, Table S1, there
were few significant differences between those who did vs. did not
undergo successful CFR testing. Those who did not undergo success-
ful CFR testing were more likely African American, less likely Asian,
less likely taking a loop diuretic, had higher heart rate and high-
sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), and had a lower 6MWT
distance.
The 202 HFpEF patients studied were distributed across the five
study sites [n = 56 (28%) from Stockholm, Sweden; n= 51 (25%) from
Chicago, USA; n= 40 (20%) from Turku, Finland; n= 35 (17%) from
Sahlgrenska, Sweden; and n= 20 (10%) from Singapore]. Of the 202
study participants who underwent successful CFR testing, we found
that 151 (74.8%; 95% CI 68.7–80.8%) had evidence of CMD (defined
as CFR <2.5). Supplementary material online, Figure S1 displays the cu-
mulative distribution of the CFR values across the PROMIS study par-
ticipants. The mean6 standard deviation CFR in the study cohort
overall was 2.13± 0.51, median 2.08 (25th–75th percentile 1.78–2.50).
Clinical (Table 1) and echocardiographic (Table 2) characteristics
are presented stratified by presence or absence of CMD. Overall, the
enrolled participants had multiple indicators supportive of the diag-
nosis of HFpEF—they were elderly (mean age 74years), 55% female,
and had multiple comorbidities. Mean KCCQ score (66± 22) and
6MWT distance (328± 118 meters) were both consistent with prior
HFpEF studies and indicated a poor quality of life and reduced exer-
cise tolerance, respectively. NTproBNP values were elevated [me-
dian 953 (25th–75th percentile 349–1765) pg/mL], LV EF was
preserved (59± 8%), 162/202 (80%) had evidence of LV hypertrophy
or concentric remodelling, and LV diastolic dysfunction was present
in the majority [increased LA volume, reduced tissue Doppler e0
velocities, and elevated E/e0 ratio (Table 2)]. The mean HFA-PEFF
score was 6.1± 1.6, and the majority [165/202 (82%)] had a score of
>
_5, indicative of definite HFpEF based on resting echocardiographic
and NTproBNP data obtained as part of the present study. The ma-
jority of those with an HFA-PEFF score <5 had a prior history of ele-
vated LV filling pressures on invasive haemodynamic testing [22/37
(59%)], and the rest had a prior history of HF hospitalization,
increased natriuretic peptides, and/or increased E/e’ ratio.
Patients with CMD were more likely to have a history of atrial fib-
rillation (and taking anticoagulants) and were more often current or
former smokers (Table 1). Participants in the CMD group had slightly
lower BMI and higher heart rates, but other vital signs and physical
characteristics were similar between groups. On laboratory testing,
UACR, troponin, and NTproBNP were all higher in the CMD group
compared to the non-CMD group. High-sensitivity CRP, a marker
of systemic inflammation, was not associated with either CMD or
CFR (P = 0.95).
Conventional echocardiography (resting 2D, Doppler, and tissue
Doppler) parameters were similar between groups except for lower
stroke volume, reduced longitudinal systolic function (s0 velocity) of
the left ventricle and right ventricle, greater right ventricular (RV)
hypertrophy, and higher estimated pulmonary vascular resistance in
participants with CMD (Table 2). Non-invasive pressure–volume ana-
lysis revealed stiffer left ventricle and aorta, and evidence of worse
RV-pulmonary artery coupling (lower ratio of tricuspid annular plane
systolic excursion (TAPSE) to estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure) in the CMD group. On speckle-tracking analysis, longitu-
dinal systolic strain of the left ventricle, left atrium, and right ventricle
were all lower (worse) in the CMD group compared with the non-
CMD group (Table 2).
When examined as a continuous variable, participants with a history
of current or former smoking, and those with a history of atrial fibrilla-
tion, had lower CFR values (Figure 2). In a multivariable model including
age, sex, BMI, diabetes mellitus, history of revascularized CAD, smok-
ing, and atrial fibrillation, both smoking [beta-coefficient -0.20 (95% CI

-0.34 to -0.05), P= 0.007] and atrial fibrillation [beta-coefficient -0.17
(95% CI -0.31 to -0.03), P= 0.02] were still associated with lower val-
ues of CFR. Lower CFR was also associated with higher UACR and
NTproBNP, and lower reactive hyperaemia index (RHI), TAPSE, LV
global longitudinal strain, and LA reservoir strain on univariate analysis
(Figure 3 and Supplementary material online, Table S2). Coronary flow
reserve was not associated with either KCCQ score or 6MWT.
Worse CFR was still associated with higher UACR and NTproBNP,
and lower RHI, TAPSE, and RV free wall strain after adjustment for
age, sex, BMI, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, revascularized CAD, smoking,
left ventricular mass, and study site (P< 0.05 for all models) (Table 3).
Tests for multicollinearity showed that atrial fibrillation and LA reser-
voir strain were highly correlated (r = -0.75); indeed, CFR remained
associated with LA reservoir strain after multivariable adjustment
when atrial fibrillation was excluded from the multivariable model.
Bootstrapping results were similar to the primary results overall
(Supplementary material online, Table S3). Formal interaction testing
by age, sex, site, BMI, and atrial fibrillation revealed no statistically sig-
nificant interactions except for the interaction by BMI on the associ-
ation between CFR and RHI (BMI � CFR interaction term P= 0.03).
There was a stronger association between CFR and RHI in those with
obesity (BMI >30kg/m2; r= 0.40, P= 0.01) compared with those with-
out obesity (BMI <
_30kg/m2; r= 0.16, P= 0.09).
Discussion
In PROMIS, the largest prospective, multi-centre study of CFR
in HFpEF, we found that the prevalence of CMD was high (75%).
The comorbidities most closely associated with CMD were a history
of smoking and atrial fibrillation. In addition, we found that HFpEF
patients with CMD had higher UACR and lower RHI, markers of sys-
temic endothelial dysfunction, even after adjustment for potential
confounders. Furthermore, we found that CFR was still associated
with markers of HF severity (NTproBNP and RV dysfunction) after
multivariable adjustment. These data support preclinical findings that
suggest that HFpEF is a systemic disorder associated with endothelial
dysfunction and microvascular disease in the heart and other organs.
As shown in Table 4, while other studies of CMD and HFpEF have
been published,4,16–20 these prior studies are either small (n = 30 or
less with HFpEF) or are retrospective and based on convenience sam-
ples of patients who underwent nuclear imaging for other reasons
(e.g. evaluation of CAD). PROMIS builds on these important prior
studies by demonstrating the high prevalence of impaired CFR
in
a
prospective,
multi-centre,
and
multinational
study
with
rigorously defined HFpEF. Furthermore, PROMIS is the first study to
demonstrate an association between reduced CFR and peripheral
(systemic) endothelial dysfunction (as measured by the EndoPAT) in
HFpEF patients. Furthermore, using systematic and comprehensive
echocardiography, we found that reduced CFR is associated with mul-
tiple indices of abnormal longitudinal (subendocardial) myocardial
dysfunction.
Doppler echocardiography for assessment of CFR has been vali-
dated and is reproducible, comparable to positron emission tomog-
raphy (PET)-based CFR, and has been endorsed by the European
Society of Cardiology.29–31 Compared with other methods Doppler
echocardiography-based CFR assessment is relatively inexpensive,

raphy, PET imaging, or invasive coronary evaluation, is a marker of
CMD and is known to reflect endothelial dysfunction (though it can
also be influenced by non-endothelial factors, capillary rarefaction,
myocardial fibrosis, and elevated LV filling pressures).32 While frac-
tional flow reserve reflects severity of focal coronary artery lesions,
CFR is a measure of the global coronary vascular function. Reduced

CFR has been shown to confer prognostic information for cardiovas-
cular outcome in various conditions.32
Reduced CFR is also present in patients with systemic inflamma-
tion and improves after immunomodulatory treatment, and is
reduced in comorbidities associated with and potentially driving
HFpEF, such as diabetes and hypertension. In the present study, we
did not find an association between reduced CFR and these factors,
possibly because of the high prevalence of these comorbidities in
patients with established HFpEF, or because reduced CFR was due to
resultant myocardial fibrosis (with extrinsic compression of the cor-
onary microvessels) and coronary microvascular rarefaction rather
than the comorbidities themselves. The association of reduced CFR
and elevated NTproBNP supports this hypothesis as the latter is
a measure of HF severity and may be reflective of significant myocar-
dial disease (e.g. myocardial fibrosis and capillary rarefaction). We did
find an association between smoking and reduced CFR in HFpEF,
which is consistent with prior studies that have found that smokers
have endothelial dysfunction and CMD.33,34 Our finding that atrial fib-
rillation is strongly associated with impaired CFR is consistent with
other studies in the absence of HFpEF; factors mediating this associ-
ation may include the arrhythmia itself, sympathetic innervation, neu-
rohormonal activation, endothelial dysfunction, or myocardial
remodelling, all factors that could be present in both HFpEF and atrial
fibrillation.35
In our study, we also did not find an association between impaired
CFR and quality of life (as measured by the KCCQ) or 6MWT dis-
tance. Reasons for the lack of association are unclear, but one possi-
bility is that in elderly HFpEF patients, qualify of life and reduced
exercise tolerance are multifactorial, and are likely due to both CMD
and other cardiac and non-cardiac factors.
Several studies have previously found that systemic endothelial
dysfunction, quantitated by EndoPAT RHI, is abnormal in HFpEF and,
when reduced, is associated with a worse prognosis.12,36,37 Our
results add to these prior studies by demonstrating an independent
association between reduced CFR and reduced RHI. Given these
findings, for future clinical trials targeting CMD in HFpEF, assessment
of RHI is an attractive method to identify patients who are most likely
to have CMD without having to perform detailed coronary flow
assessments. This may be especially important for large-scale pivotal
studies, where CFR assessment may not be feasible. Alternatively, if
HFpEF is defined according to the rigorous but universally available
criteria used here, investigators may assume that a majority of, but
not all, patients will have reduced CFR.
We found that of all echocardiographic parameters, impaired CFR
was most associated with longitudinal fibre systolic (contractile)
abnormalities in multiple cardiac chambers (left ventricle, left atrium,
and right ventricle). Longitudinal systolic function is reflective of the
health of the subendocardium; thus, it is not surprising that CMD is
most associated with these abnormalities given the fact that the sub-
endocardium is most affected by CMD. Indeed, we have previously
found that increased UACR, a marker of systemic endothelial dys-
function, is associated with LV longitudinal strain in individuals at risk
for HFpEF38 and in overt HFpEF.39 We also found an association be-
tween reduced CFR and worse LA strain, which is associated with
worse outcomes, higher pulmonary vascular resistance, and reduced
peak VO2 on cardiopulmonary exercise testing in HFpEF.8
Approximately 25% of the HFpEF patients enrolled in our study
did not have evidence of CMD. There are several potential explana-
tions for this finding. First, HFpEF is a heterogeneous syndrome; it is
possible that these patients have a more ‘extra-cardiac’ cause of fluid

overload instead of a myocardial-specific phenotype. The lesser de-
gree of impairment in longitudinal systolic strain of the left ventricle,
left atrium, and right ventricle in these patients supports this hypoth-
esis. Second, given similarities in diastolic dysfunction between the
two groups, it may be that other factors besides endothelial dysfunc-
tion are the cause of the HFpEF syndrome in these patients.
Strengths and limitations
Our study has several strengths. First, the multi-centre, multi-
national, prospective evaluation of a large number of HFpEF
patients increases the generalizability of our findings. Second, we
successfully enrolled patients who met criteria for definite
HFpEF, as indicated by the high HFA-PEFF score, and the fact
that all patients met contemporary criteria for the HFpEF diag-
nosis.
Third,
we
performed
multimodality
assessment
of
patients, which provided novel insight into type of HFpEF
patients who have CMD, as summarized in the data from two ex-
ample patients from our study shown in Figure 4.
Our study is limited by lack of longitudinal outcomes and
comorbidity-matched controls, such data could have enhanced our
study by allowing us to determine the prognostic utility of CMD, and
would have allowed us to definitively prove that CMD is much higher
in HFpEF than in those who have multiple cardiac risk factors but no
HFpEF. However, several prior studies have examined the presence
of CMD in non-HFpEF populations, and we found that the prevalence
of CMD is much higher in HFpEF compared with the prevalence of
CMD in the setting of stable CAD, diabetes, and hypertension. In
addition,
even
though
each
site
strictly
followed
guideline-
recommended investigation of CAD when suspected, we did not col-
lect detailed data on how many patients underwent coronary angiog-
raphy, coronary computed tomography, or stress testing. We are
also unable to exclude diffuse coronary artery atherosclerosis as po-
tential reason for impaired CFR in the HFpEF patients. Systematic
coronary angiography in all patients to exclude macrovascular CAD
and invasive coronary assessment of the index of microvascular re-
sistance would have been difficult in a study the size of PROMIS, but
both could have added an additional dimension to the evaluation of
CMD in HFpEF.18 However, our finding that peripheral endothelial
dysfunction (i.e. RHI) correlates with Doppler CFR argues that irre-
spective of macrovascular CAD, there is a widespread endothelial/
microvascular dysfunction present in the majority of patients with
HFpEF.
Conclusions
Impaired coronary microvascular function is highly prevalent in
HFpEF patients and is associated with NTproBNP (a marker of HF
severity), systemic endothelial dysfunction, and cardiac dysfunction
(Take home figure). Microvascular dysfunction may be a promising
composite risk marker and therapeutic target in HFpEF.
