Internet-Based Vestibular Rehabilitation for Older Adults 
With Chronic Dizziness: A Randomized Controlled 
Trial in Primary Care
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Vestibular rehabilitation is an effective intervention for dizziness due to 
vestibular dysfunction, but is seldom provided. We aimed to determine the effec-
tiveness of an Internet-based vestibular rehabilitation program for older adults 
experiencing dizziness in primary care.
METHODS We undertook a single-center, single-blind randomized controlled 
trial comparing an Internet-based vestibular rehabilitation intervention (Balance 
Retraining, freely available from https://balance.lifeguidehealth.org) with usual 
primary care in patients from 54 primary care practices in southern England. 
Patients aged 50 years and older with current dizziness exacerbated by head 
movements were enrolled. Those in the intervention group accessed an auto-
mated Internet-based program that taught vestibular rehabilitation exercises and 
suggested cognitive behavioral management strategies. Dizziness was measured 
by the Vertigo Symptom Scale–Short Form (VSS-SF) at baseline, 3 months, and 6 
months. The primary outcome was VSS-SF score at 6 months.
RESULTS A total of 296 patients were randomized in the trial; 66% were female, 
and the median age was 67 years. The VSS-SF was completed by 250 patients 
(84%) at 3 months and 230 patients (78%) at 6 months. Compared with the usual 
care group, the Internet-based vestibular rehabilitation group had less dizziness 
on the VSS-SF at 3 months (difference, 2.75 points; 95% CI, 1.39-4.12; P <.001) 
and at 6 months (difference, 2.26 points; 95% CI, 0.39-4.12; P 
= 
.02, respec-
tively). Dizziness-related disability was also lower in the Internet-based vestibular 
rehabilitation group at 3 months (difference, 6.15 points; 95% CI, 2.81-9.49; P 
<.001) and 6 months (difference, 5.58 points; 95% CI, 1.19-10.0; P 
= 
.01).
CONCLUSIONS Internet-based vestibular rehabilitation reduces dizziness and dizzi-
ness-related disability in older primary care patients without requiring clinical sup-
port. This intervention has potential for wide application in community settings.

INTRODUCTION
D
izziness is a highly prevalent symptom1,2 responsible for nearly 7 
million consultations per year in the United States.3 In primary 
care, the majority of dizziness is caused by vestibular dysfunction, 
including benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.4 Dizziness in older adults 
is associated with falls, fear of falling, anxiety, and depression, contributing 
to substantial disability, increased frailty, and loss of independence.5,6 With 
a growing aging population, the health burden will steadily increase.7 
Although dizziness has higher prevalence in older adults, more than 1 
in 10 people of working age experience dizziness that causes dysfunc-
tion or leads to medical consultations.8 Often going untreated, dizziness 
can become chronic; in a recent primary care trial including adults of all 
ages, the mean duration of symptoms was 5.5 years.9 Medical and surgi-
cal interventions offer limited benefit10; however, there is evidence that 
vestibular rehabilitation exercises are the most effective treatment for

dizziness caused by vestibular dysfunction.9,11 Ves-
tibular rehabilitation promotes central nervous system 
compensation through sets of simple exercises involv-
ing head movements, and research suggests primarily 
self-directed vestibular rehabilitation interventions can 
be effective.4,9
Internet use among older adults continues to 
steadily increase; 59% of individuals aged older than 
65 years in the United States reported using the 
Internet in 2013, compared with just 14% in 2000.12 
Consequently, vestibular rehabilitation delivered via 
the Internet, if shown to be effective, could potentially 
have a major impact in increasing access to low-cost 
treatment for dizziness. However, it is critical to 
determine the effectiveness of unguided, Internet-
supported self-management in older adults. In this ran-
domized controlled trial, we aimed to determine the 
effectiveness of fully automated Internet-based ves-
tibular rehabilitation in improving dizziness symptoms 
in primary care patients aged 50 years and older.
METHODS
Setting and Participants
Detailed descriptions of the methods used have been 
published in the trial protocol.13 We undertook a 
single-center, single-blind randomized controlled trial 
among patients from 54 primary care practices in the 
south of England, United Kingdom. To be eligible for 
inclusion, patients had to have consulted their general 
practitioner with symptoms of dizziness over the last 
2 years and still be experiencing dizziness made worse 
by head movements; had to have access to the Internet 
(and an e-mail account); and had to be aged 50 years 
or older. On the basis of a search of medical records, 
patients were excluded by practice staff if they had an 
identifiable nonlabyrinthine cause of dizziness; medical 
contraindications that would affect the required head 
movements, such as a severe cervical disorder; or seri-
ous comorbidity, for instance, a life-threatening condi-
tion or a progressive central nervous system disorder. 
Eligible patients were then sent information about 
the study, including a trial information sheet. Inter-
ested patients contacted the research team, and were 
further screened over the telephone to ensure that 
they were still currently experiencing dizziness and 
that this dizziness was made worse by head movements 
(indication of vestibular pathology). Patients were also 
excluded if their dizziness had been treated by the 
Epley maneuver in the previous month, or if they had 
a future appointment scheduled for this treatment. 
Patients provided consent online before completing 
baseline measures, and were recruited and followed up 
between September 2013 and June 2014. This trial was 
approved by a National Health Service Research Ethics 
Committee (REC Reference: 13/ SC/0119).
Randomization and Interventions
The randomization allocation process was automated 
and occurred online. Patients were randomized evenly 
to 2 conditions: Internet-based vestibular rehabilita-
tion or usual care. The randomization sequence was 
generated by the Internet intervention software and 
was concealed from the trial team. The automated ran-
domization algorithm stratified patients by dizziness 
severity using a cutoff of 12 or greater on the Vertigo 
Symptom Scale–Short Form (VSS-SF). An indepen-
dent research assistant who collected outcome data 
over the phone, the trial statistician (B.S.), and a health 
economist (D.T.) remained blinded to allocation until 
analyses were complete.
Internet-Based Vestibular Rehabilitation
The Internet-based vestibular rehabilitation interven-
tion, called Balance Retraining (freely available from 
https://balance.lifeguidehealth.org), has been described 
elsewhere13 and its development has been detailed by 
Essery et al.14 Vestibular rehabilitation consists of spe-
cific exercises including nodding and shaking the head. 
Repeated practice of these movements promotes adapta-
tion and the gradual reduction of movement-provoked 
dizziness. Importantly, the exercises also lead to psy-
chological habituation to the symptoms and reductions 
in avoidance behaviors. Using vestibular rehabilitation 
booklets developed by Yardley et al4,9,15 as a starting 
point, we created an automated, 6-session, Internet-
based intervention to be completed over 6 weeks. The 
intervention tailored advice and vestibular rehabilita-
tion exercise prescriptions based on individual patients’ 
symptoms each week, and featured video demonstra-
tions with audio descriptions of all vestibular rehabilita-
tion exercises. Each week, cognitive behavioral coping 
strategies such as relaxation, breathing techniques, and 
cognitive restructuring were integrated with the ves-
tibular rehabilitation material. Self-regulation theory16 
and cognitive-behavioral theory15 guided the behavior 
change principles of the intervention, and self-efficacy 
was targeted by encouraging graded goal setting and 
tailored feedback. The intervention was developed and 
delivered using the freely available LifeGuide software 
(http://www.lifeguideonline.org), and was fully auto-
mated and delivered online, without therapist support. 
Patients in the intervention group also had access to 
usual primary care throughout.
Usual Care
As this was a pragmatic trial, patients randomized to 
the usual care group continued to receive primary care

for their symptoms as normal over the trial period. 
Usual primary care for dizziness in the United King-
dom typically consists of reassurance and symptomatic 
relief (eg, medication for nausea). Some general practi-
tioners may provide additional educational information 
(eg, leaflets). After completing the trial, patients in this 
usual care arm were offered access to the Internet-
based vestibular rehabilitation intervention.
Outcome Measures
Outcomes were measured at baseline and at 3 months 
and 6 months after randomization. All data were 
collected online. The primary outcome was the fre-
quency of 15 dizziness-related symptoms at 6 months, 
as measured by the total score on the VSS-SF.17 The 
higher scores on the VSS-SF represent higher levels 
of dizziness. Secondary measures included the vertigo 
and autonomic symptom subscales of the VSS-SF; the 
Dizziness Handicap Inventory,18 which measures the 
functional, physical, and emotional impact of dizziness; 
a single-item measure of subjective improvement in 
dizziness15; and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale19 which measures symptoms of anxiety as well 
as depression. At baseline, we collected demographic 
information including age, sex, and educational attain-
ment, along with years since diagnosis. Objective 
website use data were collected to determine adher-
ence to the Internet-based vestibular rehabilitation 
intervention.
Statistical Analysis
The sample size was based on an effect size (Cohen d) 
of 0.45 drawn from the findings of previous booklet-
based vestibular rehabilitation trials.9 With 90% power 
and a 5% significance level, 105 patients per group 
were required. We allowed for 20% loss to follow-up, 
giving a total sample size of 262 patients (131 per 
group).
Data were analyzed using Stata/SE version 13.1 
(StataCorp LP). The distribution of the primary 
outcome measure and its residuals were examined 
for deviations from normality and tested using the 
Shapiro-Wilk test. The same tests were carried out 
on the continuous secondary outcome measures. The 
outcome data were not approximately normally dis-
tributed and were therefore analyzed using quantile 
regression. Logistic regression analysis was used for 
binary outcome measures. All analyses controlled for 
the potential confounding effects of baseline covariates 
(including severity, age, age when patient left educa-
tion, sex, and time since diagnosis), and the standard 
errors were adjusted to allow for any clustering by 
practice. Cluster robust standard errors for quantile 
regression20 were calculated using Stata’s qreg2 com-
mand. Models were fitted backward, retaining only 
covariates significant at the 5% level. To avoid model 
overfitting, we eliminated in a stepwise fashion the 
least significant variables. To avoid removing variables 
that might have a weak effect on the model as true 
confounders, we retained any that were associated with 
the outcome with a P value of at least .20. All covari-
ates were included as potential confounders in the mul-
tivariate analyses.
The primary analysis was on an intention-to-treat 
basis, with participants analyzed based on their ran-
domization group. A secondary per-protocol analysis 
was carried out to explore the effect of the interven-
tion in those who adhered to treatment (defined as 
completing at least the first exercise test in session 1). 
To assess the sensitivity of the results to missing data, 
we completed multiple imputation analyses based on 
a linear multiple imputation model with 50 imputa-
tions. The imputations were undertaken using chained 
equations.21 A linear model was assumed for missing 
outcome data and appropriate distributions for any 
missing covariates. The model included all sociode-
mographic variables, baseline values, and the outcome 
measures at all time points. The imputed data sets 
were then analyzed using nonparametric models as 
per the primary analysis. This method may have intro-
duced bias, however, particularly given the nonnor-
mality of the data; therefore, we recommend caution 
in its interpretation. This method is presented here as 
a sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS
Patients
We recruited 296 patients from 54 general practices. 
Table 1 gives the baseline characteristics of the inter-
vention and usual care groups. The median number of 
patients participating at each practice or clinic was 21 
(interquartile range, 11-40). The groups were gener-
ally well balanced with a slight difference in the years 
since diagnosis. 
Figure 1 shows the flow of patients through the 
trial. Dropout varied between the groups and was 
higher in the intervention group at both 3 months 
(23.1%, 37 of 160 patients) and 6 months (30.0%, 48 of 
160 patients) compared with the usual care group at 3 
months (6.6%, 9 of 136 patients) and 6 months (13.2%, 
18 of 136 patients). The majority of the dropout 
occurred by 3 months. Differences between those who 
completed all follow-up assessments and those who did 
not are shown in the Supplemental Table (available at 
http://www.annfammed.org/content/15/3/209/suppl/
DC1). Allocation to the intervention group was the 
only significant predictor of noncompletion.

Primary Outcome
In all, 250 patients (84%) completed the VSS-SF at 3 
months and 230 (78%) did so at 6 months. The inter-
vention group showed statistically significant improve-
ments in dizziness symptoms compared with the usual 
care group (Table 2). In multivariate analysis, the 
median VSS-SF score in the intervention group was 
lower than in the usual care group by 2.75 points (95% 
CI, 1.39 to 4.12; P <.001) at 3 months and by 2.26 
points (95% CI, 0.39 to 4.12; P = .02) at 6 months.
Repeating the analysis with missing data replaced 
based on a multiple imputation model, as a sensitivity 
analysis, yielded more modest differences. The median 
VSS-SF score was 2.57 points (95% CI, 0.85 to 4.28; 
P = .003) lower in the intervention group compared 
with the usual care group at 3 months, and 1.86 points 
(95% CI, –0.59 to 4.32; P = .14) lower in the interven-
tion group compared with the usual care group at 6 
months (data not shown).
For the 160 patients in the intervention group, per 
protocol was defined as completing at least the first 
exercise test in session 1. Objective data on use of the 
intervention showed that 99 patients (61%) reached this 
point in the intervention. In the per-protocol analysis, 
the VSS-SF score was not significantly lower in those 
who had reached this point in the intervention than in 
those who had not (including all those in the usual care 
group) at 3 months (1.27 points; 95% CI, –0.31 to 2.85; 
P = .12), but it had reached significance at 6 months (2.11 
points; 95% CI, 0.23 to 3.99; P = .03) (data not shown).
Secondary Outcomes
As shown in Table 2, there was a signifi-
cantly greater reduction in the intervention 
group on the autonomic symptoms subscale 
of the VSS-SF at both 3 and 6 months. On 
the vertigo subscale, there was a signifi-
cantly greater reduction in symptoms at 3 
months, but this difference did not persist 
at 6 months. There were also significant 
differences between the intervention and 
usual care groups on the Dizziness Handi-
cap Inventory at 3 and 6 months, showing 
substantially greater reductions in dizziness-
related disability for the former group. The 
intervention group had a greater reduction 
in anxiety at 3 months, but this difference 
was not sustained at 6 month. There were 
no significant differences between groups in 
depression at either time point.
Compared with the usual care group, the 
intervention group reported significantly 
greater subjective improvement in dizziness 
at both 3 months and 6 months (Table 2). At 
3 months, 62.3% of the intervention group 
(76 of 122 patients) reported their dizziness 
symptoms felt a little or much better, compared with 
32.8% (42 of 128 patients) in the usual care group. 
These findings were replicated at 6 months with 
64.2% (70 of 109 patients) in the intervention group 
feeling a little or much better, compared with 41.0% 
(50 of 122 patients) in the usual care group feeling a 
little or much better. 
There were low rates of perceived harm in both 
groups at 3 and 6 months, with 9.8% and 6.4% of the 
intervention group and 14.8% and 20.5% of the usual 
care group reporting that they were a little or much 
worse, respectively (see Supplemental Figure 1, avail-
able at http://www.annfammed.org/content/15/3/209/
suppl/DC1).
Exploratory Analysis by Age
Although our trial was not powered to detect interac-
tions, we carried out a planned exploratory analysis to 
see whether there were any differences in the response 
to the intervention according to participant age above 
and below the median of 67 years (Table 3). At 6 
months, in the younger age-group, the effect of the 
intervention compared with usual care was not sig-
nificant (univariate median difference = 1.00; 95%, CI, 
–1.77 to 3.77; P =.48); however, in the older age-group, 
the effect of the intervention compared with usual care 
was significant (univariate median difference = 3.00; 
95% CI, 0.14 to 5.86; P = .04). This pattern suggests 
the improved dizziness in the intervention group was

more likely to be sustained at 6 
months among the older adults 
(aged >67 years) in our sample.
Adverse Events
A total of 18 non–dizziness-
related hospitalizations were 
identified in a review of general 
practitioner notes undertaken at 
the end of the trial (8 in the usual 
care group, 10 in the interven-
tion group). No dizziness- or 
intervention-related serious 
adverse events were reported 
during the trial or identified from 
the notes review.
DISCUSSION
Access to an unsupported 
Internet-based vestibular reha-
bilitation intervention signifi-
cantly reduced chronic dizziness 
and dizziness-related disability 
compared with usual primary 
care among the older adults in 
our study. This benefit persisted 
for at least 6 months. With the 
increasing Internet use being seen 
in older adults,12 our Internet-
based vestibular rehabilitation 
intervention could enable clini-
cians to provide broad and rapid 
access to low-cost, evidence-
based treatment for their patients 
experiencing dizziness. The mean 
age of our sample was 67 years, 
suggesting that provision via digi-
tal technology may not be barrier 
to effectiveness in older adults, 
particularly if attention is paid 
to accessibility when developing 
such interventions.14
Our findings are consistent 
with the findings of trials of 
booklet-based vestibular reha-
bilitation.4,9,15,22 Provision via the 
Internet has substantial benefits 
over use of booklets, which may 
have limited penetration even in 
clinical settings and even less in 
community settings, reducing 
the likelihood of a significant 
impact on the health burden

of chronic dizziness. The size of the effect on the 
primary outcome, the VSS-SF, was comparable to 
the effects achieved in a trial by Yardley et al9 where 
booklets were provided with health care professional 
support (1.79 to 2.52 points). It is also comparable to 
mean VSS-SF reductions after a 9-week, face-to-face 
group session vestibular rehabilitation intervention 
(2.4 points).23
Although the difference in dizziness symptoms 
remained significant, the size of the difference 
between the intervention and usual care groups 
decreased from 3 months to 6 months. This dimin-
ishing difference was driven by improvements in the 
control group rather than by worsening symptoms in 
the intervention group, where improvements in diz-
ziness persisted. Our trial’s pre-randomization entry 
procedures for all patients may have been reassuring, 
describing vestibular rehabilitation as simple head 
movements that may reduce dizziness. Dizziness is 
closely related to anxiety and avoidance behaviors; 
therefore, reassurance is a key component in manage-
ment strategies for dizziness.6
This trial had some limitations. Loss to follow-up 
in the intervention group was relatively high. Some 
patients may have found the dizziness-inducing head 
movements off-putting and dropped out. The Balance 
Retraining intervention provides explicit reassurance 
regarding these dizziness symptoms; nonetheless, 
it is important that physicians provide reassurance 
regarding what to expect when patients engage in this 
program. Although the difference between groups 
in the multiple imputation analysis was significant at 
3 months, it did not reach significance at 6 months. 
We suspect that the prominence of patients’ baseline 
score in the imputation model (other covariates were 
limited) and the extent of the imputation required may

have attenuated differences; we also reiterate that cau-
tion is required in the interpretation of these analyses 
because of the nonnormality of the patient data. As 
with previous vestibular rehabilitation trials,9 overall 
uptake after our primary care list search and mailing 
was low (fewer than 10% of patients offered partici-
pation enrolled); however, it is possible that a large 
proportion of nonresponders were no longer dizzy9 
or simply did not want to take part in a research trial. 
We were unable to consider our results in relation to 
specific diagnoses, as those data were not obtained. 
Nonetheless, our trial approach was consistent with 
the conduct of a pragmatic trial in primary care, 
where definitive diagnoses of dizziness symptoms 
are rare in day-to-day practice.24 Finally, harms data 
were examined primarily through a review of family 
practice notes, or when reported directly to the study 
team. As minimal contact was made with the trial 
team, some harms may have gone unreported.
In conclusion, this trial has demonstrated that 
Internet-based vestibular rehabilitation is effective in 
reducing dizziness symptoms and dizziness-related 
disability in primary care patients. Internet-based 
interventions may provide a promising means of 
greatly increasing the provision of evidence-based self-
management strategies for older adults in primary care.
