Geographic Variation in Pediatric Cancer Incidence —  
United States, 2003–2014

Approximately 15,000 persons aged <20 years receive a 
cancer diagnosis each year in the United States (1). National 
surveillance data could provide understanding of geographic 
variation in occurrence of new cases to guide public health 
planning and investigation (2,3). Past research on pediatric 
cancer incidence described differences by U.S. Census region 
but did not provide state-level estimates (4). To adequately 
describe geographic variation in cancer incidence among 
persons aged <20 years in the United States, CDC analyzed 
data from United States Cancer Statistics (USCS) during 
2003–2014 and identified 171,432 cases of pediatric cancer 
during this period (incidence = 173.7 cases per 1 million 
persons). The cancer types with the highest incidence rates 
were leukemias (45.7), brain tumors (30.9), and lymphomas 
(26.2). By U.S. Census region, pediatric cancer incidence 
was highest in the Northeast (188.0) and lowest in the South 
(168.0), whereas by state (including the District of Columbia 
[DC]), rates were highest in New Hampshire, DC, and New 
Jersey. Among non-Hispanic whites (whites) and non-Hispanic 
blacks (blacks), pediatric cancer incidence was highest in the 
Northeast, and the highest rates among Hispanics were in the 
South. The highest rates of leukemia were in the West, and 
the highest rates of lymphoma and brain tumors were in the 
Northeast. State-based differences in pediatric cancer incidence 
could guide interventions related to accessing care (e.g., in 
states with large distances to pediatric oncology centers), clini-
cal trial enrollment, and state or regional studies designed to 
further explore variations in cancer incidence.
USCS includes incidence data from CDC’s National 
Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and the National Cancer 
Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 
program (1). Data on new cases of cancer diagnosed during 
2003–2014 were obtained from population-based cancer regis-
tries affiliated with NPCR and SEER programs in all U.S. states 
and DC. This study included incidence data for all registries 
that met USCS publication criteria* during 2003–2014, which 
represented >99% of the U.S. population, excluding data only 
* Cancer registries’ incidence data met the following five USCS criteria: 1) ≤5% 
of cases ascertained solely on the basis of death certificate; 2) ≤3% of cases 
missing information on sex; 3) ≤3% of cases missing information on age; 
4) ≤5% of cases missing information on race; and 5) ≥97% of registry’s records 
passed a set of single-field and interfield computerized edits that test the validity 
and logic of data components. https://nccd.cdc.gov/uscs/.
from Nevada, which did not meet criteria in 2011. This report 
includes all cases of malignant† cancer diagnosed among per-
sons aged <20 years; it includes first primary cases only and 
excludes recurrent cases. Diagnosis histology and primary site 
were grouped according to the International Classification of 
Childhood Cancer (ICCC).§
Pediatric cancer rates were expressed per 1 million persons 
and were age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population.¶ 
Rates were estimated by sex, age group, race/ethnicity, state, 
U.S. Census region,** county-level economic status, county-
level rural/urban classification, and ICCC group.
During 2003–2014, CDC identified 171,432 new cases of 
pediatric cancer (Table 1). Overall incidence was 173.7 cases 
per 1 million population. The cancer types with the highest 
incidence rates were leukemias (45.7 per 1 million), brain 
tumors (30.9), and lymphomas (26.2). Rates were higher in 
males (181.5) than in females (165.5) and in persons aged 
0–4 years (228.9) and 15–19 years (213.3) than in persons aged 
5–9 years (122.6) and 10–14 years (133.0). Among all racial/
ethnic groups, the highest incidence rate was among whites 
(184.4), and the lowest was among blacks (133.3).
Rates were highest in the Northeast U.S. Census region, 
followed by the Midwest, the West, and the South. Rates 
were highest in the Northeast across all age groups and among 
whites and blacks. Among Hispanics, rates were highest in the 
South. Pediatric cancer incidence rates were highest in the 25% 
of counties with the highest economic status and were higher 
in metropolitan areas with populations ≥1 million than in 
nonmetropolitan areas.
By state, pediatric cancer incidence rates ranged from 
145.2–205.5 per 1 million. Rates were highest in New 
Hampshire (205.5), DC (194.0), and New Jersey (192.3) 
and lowest in South Carolina (149.3) and Mississippi 
(145.2) (Table 2). Incidence among whites ranged from 
157.0 in Montana to 255.2 in Hawaii; among blacks, from

Pediatric cancer incidence rates varied by state within each 
cancer type (Figure). Incidence rates were highest in the West 
for leukemias, myeloproliferative diseases, and myelodysplastic 
diseases (ICCC group I) and in the Northeast for lymphomas 
and reticuloendothelial neoplasms (group II) and central ner-
vous system cancers (group III). Rates were also highest in the 
Northeast for neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, bone tumors, 
soft tissue sarcomas, and thyroid cancer (Supplementary 
Table 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/53586). Renal cancer 
rates were highest in the Northeast and South; hepatic tumor 
rates were highest in the Northeast and West. Germ cell tumor 
rates were highest in the West (Supplementary Table 2, https://
stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/53586).
Discussion
This study used recent data with greater population cover-
age than past studies (4,5) to document geographic variation 
in pediatric cancer incidence rates by sex, age, type, and race/
ethnicity. Consistent with past reports (1,4,5), pediatric can-
cer rates were highest in males, persons aged 0–4 years and 
15–19 years, whites, and the Northeast U.S. Census region. 
Rates were highest in metropolitan areas with populations 
≥1 million; state-based rates were highest in New Hampshire, 
DC, and New Jersey.
A strength of this report is the use of extensive population-
based surveillance data (>99% coverage§§), which permits a

detailed description of state-based cancer incidence variation. 
Geographic variation in rates might account for differences 
in results from previous studies that were based on different 
populations such as state data (2,3), SEER registries (which 
cover 9%–28% of the U.S. population),¶¶ or other large data 
sets (6). A 2016 study specific to Delaware assessed pediatric 
cancer incidence by demographic group and ZIP Code; the 
study commented on local environmental exposures and pos-
sible incidence disparities based upon sex, age, race/ethnicity, 
geographic location, and economic status (2). USCS data 
provide states with a standardized way to gauge whether local 
pediatric cancer incidence rates differ relative to other states 
and might prompt states to conduct investigations similar to 
the one performed in Delaware.
Geographic variation in pediatric cancer incidence might be 
influenced by several factors.*** First, variation in childhood 
cancer incidence might be related to differences in exposures 
to carcinogenic chemicals (e.g., air pollution, secondhand 
smoke, food, or drinking water) or radiation (7). Second, 
genetic variation in certain populations (e.g., prevalence of 
cancer predisposition genes) (2,4,5) might contribute to 
geographic differences in cancer incidence. Third, the rates of

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Past research on nationwide pediatric cancer incidence 
described differences by U.S. Census region but did not provide 
state-level estimates.
What is added by this report?
During 2003–2014, the pediatric cancer rate was highest in the 
Northeast, lowest in the South, and highest in metropolitan 
areas with populations ≥1 million and counties in the top 25% 
economic status. Incidence rates by state ranged from 145 to 
206 per million and were highest in New Hampshire, the District 
of Columbia, and New Jersey. The highest rate of leukemia was 
in the West; the highest rates of lymphoma and brain cancer 
were in the Northeast.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Knowledge of these geographic differences in childhood cancer 
incidence can be used to enhance provider awareness, 
treatment capacity, survivorship care, and cancer surveillance.
certain cancer types might vary by race/ethnicity. For example, 
Hispanic children have the highest rate of the most common 
type of leukemia, pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 
states with a higher proportion of Hispanics might have higher 
rates of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (8). Fourth, incidence 
of some types of cancer (e.g., thyroid carcinoma) might be

related to enhanced detection and access to care, which can 
vary by geographic location (5,9).
In addition, geographic variation might be affected by age, 
economic status, or rural/urban classification (4,8,10). Similar 
to the findings from this report, recent data detailing adult 
cancers also indicate that the highest cancer incidence rates are 
in the Northeast (10). Rates of cancer types mostly affecting 
adults also varied by rural/urban status; some of these differ-
ences in adults might be related to factors such as obesity or 
smoking (10), which might or might not also explain rural/
urban variation in pediatric cancer.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita-
tions. First, Nevada was excluded because data for 2011 did 
not meet quality criteria, which limits the representativeness 
of the findings. Second, differences in diagnosis and cancer 
reporting among states might contribute to variation in cancer 
incidence rates (8). For example, states that were early adopters 
of electronic pathology reporting might report increased rates 
because of increased case ascertainment compared with other 
states. Finally, misrepresentation of race and ethnicity might 
exist; rate numerators might underestimate American Indians, 
Alaska Natives, and Hispanics, which could artificially lower 
rates among these groups; and U.S. Census populations used in 
rate denominators might undercount children and Hispanics, 
which could artificially increase rates in these populations (8).†††
Knowledge of pediatric cancer incidence variation by state 
and cancer type can prompt local and state cancer registries 
to evaluate reporting and diagnostic standards. Understanding 
geographic variation in incidence rates can help cancer control 
planners and clinicians address obstacles in access to care, which 
is especially relevant to states with large distances to pediatric 
oncology centers (3). Because 5-year pediatric cancer survival 
is >80%, and most cancer survivors require close monitoring 
by specialists throughout life (5), state-specific data by cancer 
type and patient age might help public health planners address 
ongoing chronic care needs. In addition, state-specific data by 
cancer type and patient age might help clinical trial organizers 
predict patient accrual. Finally, health care practitioners and 
researchers can use these data to guide investigations related to 
causes of pediatric cancer incidence variation (2,3). Continued 
surveillance will be needed to further validate findings and 
track geographic incidence patterns over time.
